2635046,5,B000HEVZ9E,"In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a ""cure"" is found that makes all mutants human.

Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such is the view of the mutant self-proclaimed leader Magneto. In the final chapter, Magneto fears that the ""cure"" will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way.

All three movies are suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in these films. New mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in X3). Special effects are 5-stars.

If you've not seen any of the movies (or all of the movies) in the trilogy, this 3-pack is a great opportunity to see a classic tale in chronological order and own a classic 3-part tale in the genre that belongs in any sci-fi fan's collection.

Hugh Jackman is excellent in the tough-guy roll as Wolverine (we like you better as a tough guy, Hugh); Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) are all spot-on too. And Famke Janssen is Phoenix whose character is key to the trilogy.

Beast is in X3 too, actually played by (to my surprise in the rolling credits)...Kelsey Grammer! Now there's a real mutation!

All in all a very entertaining 6 hours of movies here. X fans won't miss these, and you shouldn't either if you're into the action, sci-fi or fantasy genres.",1160006400,20,1630,4.603448275862069
2635047,4,B000HEVZ9E,"While it'd be impossible for any films to do justice to Marvel's legendary team of super-powered mutants, I really feel that these films are almost as good an adaptation as we could have hoped for.  The casting was strong, the action was solid, most of the characters were portrayed memorably, and the stories largely stayed true to the spirit of the X-men. The first film felt a little rushed due to the sheer number of characters introduced, but all things considered it was a very enjoyable film for both the uninitiated and old-school X-fans. Hugh Jackman was spot-on as Wolverine, the most iconic X-man and arguably the hardest to cast and Famke Jansen was a fantastic Jean Grey for at least the first two films.  Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellan (Magneto), and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique) also delivered outstanding performances playing their respective comic icons.  The story was a nice update of the comics and followed Rogue's induction into Professor X's school for mutants and Magneto's first big terrorist attack on mankind. All-in-all, a satisfying start to the series.  The second film really kicked the series into gear and introduced more of our favorite X-men, including Nightcrawler (whose opening sequence was the highlight of the film), Pyro, and Iceman. The story involves Wolverine's past and the government's attempts to control the ever-growing mutant population.  The result was one of the greatest comic book films ever made that firmly cemented the developing series as one to watch.  For some ridiculous reason, at this point the powers that be decided that the third film would be the last.  This was a bad choice that made no kind of sense, upset the films' fans, and severly hurt the quality of the third film.  Ah, the third film; a mixed bag to say the least.  The plot deals with two classic storylines involving a cure for mutants and the legendary Dark Phoenix.  My personal list of complaints is a long one, but I'll just hit a few in this review.  ""X-men: The Last Stand"" tries to cram two movies' worth of material into one film that is too short to begin with.  The introduction of the Phoenix was obviously forced and no care was taken in this storyline which is one of the all-time classics in comic history, and the result is several pointless character deaths and gaps in logic, like why an all-powerful entity is content to hang out at an aging terrorist's side and just look menacing for most of the story.  The series' former darling, Rogue, is reduced to a brooding plot-nuisance, has no real influence on the story, plus she never gains the fantastic powers she obtained in the comics that made her such a powerhouse of a character and a personal favorite of mine.  On the other hand, more classic characters are given parts such as fan-favorite Kitty Pride and Collossus (both of which had cameos in X2), Angel, Multiple Man, Beast (played nicely by Kelsey Grammer), and the almighty Juggernaut (whose battle with Kitty was as awesome as it was unexpected).  But as many characters as there were that made it into the three films, there were so many great ones that were reduced to either tiny, unnamed cameos in the series, or forgotten altogether. No Gambit, Emma Frost, Sinister, Apocalypse, Scarlet Witch, or Havok to name just a few.  Furthermore, the final film's resolution in extremely unsatisfying and leaves little doubt that this franchise as we know it is dead, though they do leave us a glimmer of hope.  There are talks of Wolverine and Magneto spin-offs and possibly a New Mutants project; promising ideas, but hardly a substitute for the ensemble we know and love.  Still, in the end, I really did enjoy X3 as a film as it did have several great stand-up-and-cheer moments; it just upset me as a fan of the comics and as a fan of the the movies because there wss so much more that could have and should have been done with this series.  In the end, whether you're a fan of the comics, the cartoons, or just a fan of sci-fi or fun movies in general, you really shouldn't miss out on these three movies.  The series is full of memorable characters, fantastic battles, sly humor, references for hard-core fans, and, of course, the classic X-men social commentaries about discrimination and the importance of both individuality and cohesiveness.  There doesn't appear to be much in the way of special features from the first two films on this edition; but for about $10 a flick, I'll let it slide since it is still a hell of a bargain.  Highly recommended set.",1159488000,41,4539,4.784891165172855

2635056,5,B000HEVZ9E,"This is the Blu Ray set to get. It has all of the extras that the new Blu Ray version omits. Each movie has it's own case and bonus disc which has making the film featuretts and interviews  from X-Men comic writers.

The movies are great and are the roots that launched the comic book movie Hollywood takeover. Fun fact Marvel's Kevin Feige was involved in all 3.

X1 gets the best Blu Ray upgrade. Being a movie from 2000, it has been cleaned up greatly. X1 is a bit dated however.

X2 is the premier movie in this set. Based on the popular God Loves Man Kills story arc this movie is widely considered the best of the original trilogy. Great action, special effects hold up surprisingly well (Nightcrawler's white house attack, so GOOD). Say what you will about Bryan Singer as a writer but when it comes to action scenes and camera position and camera shooting (LOOKIN AT YOU RUSSO BROTHERS WITH YOUR INABILITY TO SHOOT NON CLOSEUPS...) he's gold. In my not so humble opinion X2 ranks just as high as much of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

X3.... Where to begin with this one. It's a maligned movie but I don't know if I'd call it bad per say...Every problem this movie has form  their beginning with Fox's piece of crap former head Tom Rothman. This detestable man hates comic book movies. He cut the X1 and X2 budgets and advanced X1s release. Miracle it turned out so well. Greveous of all he chased Bryan Singer away from X3. Singer was working on Superman but Rothman wouldn't wait for him to finish it. Instead he rushed X3 into production to compete with Superman as some type of punishment. It wasn't ready actors were all busy Singer had taken Marsden (Cyclops) with him which is why he was in so little of X3 and also why a certain part in the early movie happened. X3 was set to start shooting and still had no director. Bret Ratner came in last minute to direct. Ratner wanted to adapt The Cure story arc from the comics. While Singer and his producers had been setting up Dark Phoenix in X2. See the problem...We ended up with an okish cure plot but Dark Phoenix set a new definition of butchering source material. The 2 stories just didn't mesh together. One or the other would have been better.

That being said I still enjoy X3. It has the best action/powers effects of the original trilogy. It's cool. I like the fights scenes as well. And we can't leave out the awesome bridge scene. The movie has grown on me since it's been written out of current X-Men timeline lore. Knowing that these events are now a 'what if' scenerio make the film more watchable and enjoyable knowing that it no longer screws up the core team (see Days of Future Past). At least to me anyway.",1509840000,7,2689,4.442190669371197

Luckily, the terrible events of X-3 were later ""fixed"", though I won't say how as it kind of falls into spoiler territory.

The first two movies were fine and I was looking forward to watching the third one, ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" However, when I opened it I was surprised to find that there were 2 copies of Disc #2 (the extra features disc), but there was no Disc #1 (the movie disc). Unfortunately, I had purchased a complete TV series at the same time, which I watched first... so by the time I discovered the problem with the X-Men Trilogy set, it was well beyond Amazon's time limit for returning it. So if I want to watch ""The Last Stand"" my only option now would be to buy it again and pay for something I've already paid for. Buyer beware!",1414108800,,760,4.212328767123288

I thoroughly enjoy watching and re-watching these films.",1400976000,,376,4.420289855072464
2635452,5,B000HEVZ9E,"The movies are great fun, a bit preachy at times, but in a controlled relevant way. the X-Men were more or less a morality tale about tolerance from the beginning. So nothing new here. I like the fact it is three standard cases in a slipcover as opposed to slimline cases as when the slip cover goes it ruins the set. The movies look and sound great and there's tons of extras included. A great action series with strong characters and strong performances all around. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan being the standouts among a stellar cast. This is a  great way to own the movies at a reasonable price and if they make more movies in the series (aside from the spin-offs) then you can easily take out the discs and place them alongside the new additions. Unfortunately they all include a digital copy disc with codes that are expired. While that isn't a deal breaker for me I know people who love the fact they get the digital copies. I still think movies should all go to ultraviolet or at least make the digital copy a digital download, because once the code expires that disc is useless and simply just takes up too much room). Or the should include a dvd copy with the digital copy on the same disc, as other companies do. Sorry to vent, but the digital copy disc is something they should have done away with as soon as ultraviolet started. It's a waste of materials and for those who forget to read the really fine print on a dvd case it can be really annoying when you try to upload it. Also if you reformat your computer you may lose your authorization to play the movie as well. But, I digress, this is a great series, all of the movies in the series including First Class and the two Wolverine movies are excellent. Very well done. First Class didn't feel like a reboot as much as it was just a prequel. It didn't feel like a cash grab. It felt organic and added more depth to the series. So I'd highly recommend this set for anyone wanting to catch up on the series before the new movie comes out. The price  is more than reasonable.",1399248000,,2059,4.359375

The other two movie's digital codes expired some time in 2011.

So unless your computer has a Blue Ray reader in it, you can't watch these movies on your computer. I am super disappointed because I only have my computer in my bedroom and not a Blue Ray player or even a TV.

I gave this product two stars because I do love these movies and I can watch them on the Blue Ray player in our common room but I am steamed that I bought this in December of 2013 but the code expired in 2010/11.

2635502,5,B000HEVZ9E,"X-Men Trilogy is a great combo pack in a Blu-ray format.  With this combo pack you get the original first three x-men movies ( X-Men, X2, and X-Men: The Last Stand).  If you are not familiar with these films I have included a quick summary of each movie.

- X-Men is a 2000 Co-written and directed by Bryan Singer, the film stars Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Bruce Davison, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, Ray Park and Tyler Mane. It depicts a world in which a small proportion of people are mutants, whose possession of superhuman powers makes them distrusted by normal humans. The film focuses on the mutants Wolverine and Rogue as they are brought into a conflict between two groups that have radically different approaches to bringing about the acceptance of mutantkind: Professor Xavier's X-Men, and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto.

X2 is a 2003 American superhero film, based on the fictional characters the X-Men. Directed by Bryan Singer, and stars Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Brian Cox, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Kelly Hu. The plot, inspired by the graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills, pits the X-Men and their enemies, the Brotherhood, against the genocidal Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox). He leads an assault on Professor Xavier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer Cerebro, in order to destroy every mutant on Earth.

X-Men: The Last Stand is a 2006 American superhero film that was directed by Brett Ratner and stars Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry. The film's script is loosely based on two X-Men comic book story arcs, ""The Dark Phoenix Saga"" by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne, and ""Gifted"" by writer Joss Whedon and artist John Cassaday, with a plot that revolves around a ""mutant cure"" that causes serious repercussions among mutants and humans, and on the resurrection of Jean Grey.

Here are the additional features included in this combo set:

DISC 1- X-Men = (2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen presentation, Deleted Scenes, Charlie Rose Interview, Mutant Watch featurette, -Hugh Jackman Screen Test, Storyboards, Art Gallery, Animatics, Trailer).

DISC 2- X2: X-Men United = (2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen presentation, Commentary by Director and Cinematographer, -Commentary by Producers and Writers).

DISC 3- X-Men: The Last Stand = (2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen presentation, Commentary by Director and Writers, -Commentary by Producers, Deleted Scenes with optional Director Commentary, Alternate Endings with optional Director, Commentary).

2635551,4,B000HEVZ9E,"With the new X-men movie coming out in a few months and set to unify the old X-men movies with the new series, I decided to buy this set for my wife and daughter to watch before going to the new series.

Readers can look for reviews of each movie on online sites, so I will stick with the product at hand.

I bought this boxed set very cheap from the Amazon Warehouse deals. The box didn't come wrapped in plastic, and I found that even though the box had some small damage, each blu ray package was in perfect condition.

The set has a lot of extras, and digital version of the movies. This is great for any fan that wants some extra tidbits on the productions of movies. The quality on the movies is great and the audio is pretty good. You have many languages to chose from as well.

I haven't still checked all the content, but so far, so good. I can recommend this set to any fan of the Xmen series, but you can always wait for big discounts on Amazon like this one, and you will be happy with the product. In this specific case, Amazon Warehouse sure provided a good product for a very low price.",1384300800,2,1101,4.154929577464789

The Adamantium Collection includes all six X-Men films on Blu-ray in a 7-disc set spanning 2000-2013 (X-Men, X2, X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, X-Men: First Class, The Wolverine). The Adamantium collection includes a cool claw and a bonus disc (with roughly an hour of supplements). There is also an open slot for X-Men: Days of Future Past to complete your X-Men collection. The films have not been remastered for the Adamantium Collection. Admittedly, they still look and sound great but the exclusive content for fans really comes down to the claw and Legacy X bonus disc (55-minutes). My main concern is that it's missing some bonus discs from previous releases so not all the extras have been ported over and The Wolverine is not in 3D. I rate the films 4 stars but this Collector's Edition only 2 stars. If you don't own these films yet it could be a worthwhile purchase. Some fans may prefer to wait for a more deluxe collection loaded with supplements (not to mention Days of Future Past) before upgrading. Hang onto your old bonus discs if you buy the Adamantium Collection.

Buy the X-Men Trilogy on Blu-ray. This release has held its value but it is expected to decline as new X-Men Collections become available on Blu-ray with additional films.",1380153600,5,2285,6.027692307692308
2635568,5,B000HEVZ9E,"I bought this on sale so the price was the biggest reason I purchased this. That and I knew the quality would be good (I recommend bluray.com for checking out video and audio quality of blurays).

Thankfully each movie is individually packaged. By that I mean they all have their own bluray package if you don't want to leave them in the cheap paper box holding them all together (which I think is unnecessary and a waste of space).

The added features are okay. Nothing extraordinary, but at least they do exist. It's not just a completely stripped down release with only the movies.",1380067200,,584,4.605769230769231

2635572,4,B000HEVZ9E,Love the X-Men since I was a kid. But what gets on my nerves is the fact that the three movies focus to much on Wolverine and how they change the original stories.

The scene with the Phoenix in Jean's childhood home comes to mind.

Action, Comedy, Romance, Great Characters, Social Themes and Ethical questions, and more.  The films are supported by amazing talent and are very well crafted.  I HIGHLY recommend you give the X-men a shot, even if it's not your cup of tea.  At least try the first two movies. (I happen to love the third one as well, but I truly believe X2 stands out as a classic and one of the best films in recent history).

Don't bother renting.  For this price there's no reason not to just go for the purchase.  You'll get all the special features, and the chance to watch the movies again (I bet you'll want to!!) for just a few dollars.  And all this on very high quality blu-rays.

So basically... just buy it!  There's no reason not to.

2635659,5,B000HEVZ9E,"Some twenty years ago, I often collected comic books, getting my hands on every one of the Marvel Comics, including ""The X-Men."" The decade of 1990s marked the era of new x-comics, lulling artworks, and incredible story arcs. Having watched the ""X-Men"" Trilogy when they first came out in the last decade was outstanding with interesting story lines.

""X-Men"" (2000) was such an enjoyable watch and exceeded my expectations of the story. It was an excellent first film of this superhero team. This story focuses on Rogue and Wolverine in Canada as they met and were eventually attacked by Sabretooth and saved by Cyclops and Storm. They soon swayed into a conflict with Magneto, who's trying to convert all humans to being mutants, but that experiment would prove fruitless. In my opinion, Hugh Jackman was an excellent choice for the character Wolverine.

""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) was another enjoyable action film with much added characters, such as Nightcrawler and Deathstrike. This film's story begins with Nightcrawler's attempt to assassinate the President, which sends a great fear among the populations about the mutants and also gave a covert government operative, William Stryker, an authorization to ""seize and detain"" the mutants at the mansion. Logan returns to the school from his failed search for answers to his past and ended up babysitting the youngsters and protecting them from the government. Professor X was captured and being used to kill the mutants through Cerebro. This film also shows the past of the Wolverine and his connection with Stryker. I think this film is pretty good, considering a reasonable storyline and how so many characters were able to fit into it.

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006) was an interesting yet so overwhelming dark action film but quite enjoyable. It has so many characters from the comic books that I had some difficulty keeping track of, but the story itself is focused on the return of Jean Grey and an emerging of Dark Phoenix as well as the deaths of certain principal characters. I just couldn't believe my eyes when I experienced the latter deaths as if saying, ""No, it can't be!"" This film's story is about the struggles between good and evil, nature and nurture, love and hate. The story brought out the ""cure"" to eradicate any mutant abilities that one have had and the fight occurs between the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. The fight ended with drastic consequences, and the survivors find their ways to move on and to live peacefully. Like I said, the story is interesting but it has more deaths and actions than I would care for.

Of all three films, they surely are entertaining. I just found it interesting that Wolverine was certainly a strong central character of all of the X-Men characters across the board, and it made sense as he exhibited both animal and human sides and often showed an inner conflict that other mutants usually experienced on some level.

Personally, I don't have a ""favorite"" but all three films are magnificent in their own rights.",1362441600,,3037,4.935420743639922

2635744,5,B000HEVZ9E,"I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.

The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.

Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).

""X-Men"" naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the plight of the mutants. Wolverine and Rogue are presented and slowly develop an interesting big brother/little sister type relationship. They come into contact with both Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's school and understandably opt for the latter. Magneto's bunch includes Sabertooth, Toad and Mystique, while Xavier's team includes Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm, as well as Iceman and Pyro. Both groups meet and tussle at Liberty Island in New York Harbor. When I saw ""X-Men"" in the theater in 2000 it was easily the best comic-to-film adaption since ""Superman"" (1978) and ""Superman II"" (1980). It was the precursor to all the great superhero films that came out in the 2000s and has only lost some of its allure due to the great quality of many of those flicks.

""X2"" is generally considered the best of the three and goes deeper into the conflict of Xavier's school, Magneto's Brotherhood and the US Government's increasing involvement. More mutants are introduced. On Xavier's side: Nightcrawler, Colossus and Shadowcat. On the villain side: Lady Deathstrike and Government agent William Stryker. ""X2"" has the most depth and features numerous interesting character-defining moments along with great action scenes, like the one between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike near the end. There's also a particularly notable clash when Wolverine and others are forced to confront Federal agents as they storm Xavier's school. Interestingly, the US Government becomes the proverbial ""bad guys"" but this makes no difference to Wolverine, who ""pulls no punches,"" to say the least. Unfortunately, the film overstays its welcome and goes on and on well after Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike, but I'm not complaining. I like the emphasis on depth.

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is generally well-regarded but has a very vocal segment of fans who revile it. This makes little sense since, despite having a new director, the film has the same tone and principle actors as the previous two and brings to culmination the ideas presented therein. Aside from the final fight between Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men we get the resurrection of Jean Grey and her struggle with the dark side of her psyche. Some complain of the deaths of two prominent characters, but how often are characters resurrected in comics? Wasn't one significant character resurrected in this very film? Others complain about the supposed short runtime and lack of depth but X3 has the exact same runtime as the first film (104 minutes) and there's plenty of depth to mine, take Rogue's dilemma, Phoenix's incredible inner conflict, Cyclop's grief, Pyro's moral degeneration, Mystique's plight after getting kicked out of the Brotherhood and Wolverine's struggle to do the right thing despite his deep love, to name just six.

All three films proved hugely popular at the box office and each movie out-performed the former (even adjusted for inflation). In other words, ""The Last Stand"" was the most successful

I'm hesitant to call them ""superhero"" movies, because more than anything they are speculative sci-fi. Like the comics they are based on, these films chronicle a band of not-so-merry mutants who are tasked with protecting a world that hates and fears them, although in the films they wear leather uniforms instead of colorful tights. A lot of fans throw hissy fits about the third film for a variety of reasons (most of which you will not understand unless you're an avid comic reader), but personally I like it quite a bit and I consider all three films to be a solid arc.

Got the trilogy in time with the release of x-men first class.

2635778,4,B000HEVZ9E,"I am a long time X-men fan; everything from comics to the games, I eat it up. I picked this up for $14.99, and for that amount the lack of extras is pretty much null. There is nothing extraordinary that blew my pants off, the transfers were all very high quality, and the sound superb. So, I'll just go ahead and review the movies themselves:

X1: The best of this trilogy and as a stand alone movie (seperate of being a ""comic book movie""). Has a strong story, relevant message, believeable/relateable characters and genuine humor (When Wolverine says to Cyclops ""Keep your eye open"").

X2: 2nd favorite, it loses a bit of the authenticity and feels a bit more ""phoned in"" acting-wise. The story is classic X-men ally with bad mutant vs ""Fantacial Humans with political power"" and by the end it's a cliff hanger, but luckily you can jump right into...

X3: 3rd Favorite, a lot of people say they hate this movie. But I think that is mainly just because it strays FAR FAR aways from the comic book stories. It's still very enjoyable and besides jugggernaut the FX are the best here.",1313452800,,1082,4.538461538461538
2635779,5,B000HEVZ9E,"I really had my hopes set high before purchasing this blu-ray set, and let me tell you, all those hopes were not only met, but exceeded!

This mainly has to do with the amazing transfer of the first film. Now, don't get me wrong, all three look stunning, but the first movie certainly appears much clearer and sharper than I'd have expected (maybe I'm just used to my old DVD, which didn't really impress me), and I noticed no degradation in picture quality even in scenes that take place at night (which make up a good portion of the film). ""X-Men 2"" and ""The Last Stand"" both look beautiful as well, but the first film is really the one that shines here. It should also be noted that the first movie has the highest bitrate of the three at 31 Mbps, while the second two are encoded at 23 Mbps and 20 Mbps, respectively.

The audio is excellent. The first two films are mastered in 5.1 DTS-HD and sounded amazing on my friend's surround-sound speakers, particularly the second movie. The third movie is mastered in 6.1 DTS-HD, but I cannot really compare as I watched this one on my own, with my TV's lousy built-in speakers.

This set also has a good amount of bonus features, which certainly increases the value of this trilogy for those interested in that. They don't matter to me (but I would probably rate this set 4 stars if none were included at all), but I will update this review once I check them out.

All three movies are on 50 GB dual layer BDs, and each also includes a second disc with extra features (on 25GB single layer BDs), as well as digital copies, for a total of nine discs (six BDs and three digital copy discs).

There is absolutely no reason not to buy this set!

2635792,3,B000HEVZ9E,"As far as boxed sets go, this is very fairly priced and the movies themselves are fantastic. But the product description is inaccurate, especially for X2. None of the movies come with an insert, though the product description for each mentions them. I was very disappointed with X2 because the only special features are two commentary tracks; all the other extras are missing. When X2 was first released to DVD, the two-disc set had a disc that was the movie with two commentaries and a second disc that had all the special features. This set has the first disc from that edition rather than a re-worked DVD that includes the special features listed on the product description.

If you're looking to add the movies to your collection, you can't go wrong with this set. But if you're like me and want the special features, give this set a miss and buy the movies separately. It costs a little bit more but you get a lot more for your money than you do with this set.",1310428800,9,965,4.514285714285714

2635794,5,B000HEVZ9E,"What we have here is a simple boxset for the X-men Trilogy of movies.  You get X-Men , X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand.  While the box-set itself is not very impressive, the quality of the DVDs is.

The package comes in a simple laminated box with each DVD having its own standard sized case.  Each disk looks great on my DVD player(1080p up-scaled) and the audio is crisp.

SPECIAL FEATURES
DISK 1:  X-Men
- Deleted Scenes**  - Animatics  - Art Gallery  - Storyboards  - Trailers & TV Spots  - Hugh Jackman Screen Test  - ""Metant Watch"" Featurette  - Charlie Rose Interview

**The Deleted Scenes are part of a 10 minute addition of the film.  To view them you must watched the film in ""Branching"" Mode (in the options).  This is perhaps the weakest part of the DVD as instead of smoothly transitioning the scenes into the movie they are loaded in.  What this means is when a deleted scene comes up, the DVD stops playing a moment(black screen) and loads the deleted scene, which has the X-Men symbol in the corner.  When finished the DVD goes to a black screen again and reloads where you were in the film.  It makes for a very clunky play-through.  On Older DVD's you could select the scenes individually.  On the DVD I got you are unable to.

Disk 2: X2: X-Men United
- Audio Commentary by Bryan Singer & Newton Thomas Sigel
- Audio Commentary by the Writers & Producers
* Outside of the commentary there is no bonus features what-so-ever on the disk I received.  The movie itself was great!

Disk 3: X3: The Last Stand
- Audio Commentary by Director/Screenwriters and Producers
- Deleted Scenes
- 3 Alternative Endings

OVERALL: If you are looking to own all 3 movies then this set is a great deal, as you get all 3 movies for a fair price here.  While this does not constitute a complete collection, since there are special features are missing (especially the 2nd movie) you can't go wrong with this set.",1309392000,,1907,4.486880466472303
2635795,5,B000HEVZ9E,"Okay, all three X-Men movies were wonderful!

1. X-Men;
What was good about the movie:
1. The cast was excellent!
2. The special effects were hard core!
3. The set designs were great (especially in the Statue Of Liberty)!

What I didn't like:
1. There was not enough action in the movie!
2. The pace was slow!
3. The movie's wrap-up at the end left the movie too wide open!

If you read the comics you sould know that the action was a major part of the X-Men world, and this movie didn't have enough action in it! Oh, well...
My grade: B or three-and-a-half stars!

2. X2: X-Men United;
What was good about the movie:
1. The action was hard core!
2. The cast all returned fior the sequel!
3. The movie's pace kept going and going!
4. The special effects were better and more convincing than the first one!
5. The movie was also more suspenceful than the first one!

This movie kept true to the fans of the first one and did a better job than last time! My grade: A- or four-and-a-half stars!

3. X-Men: The Last Stand;
What was good about the movie:
1. The action just kept getting more and more exciting!
2. The cast was excellent!
3. The visual effects just get more and more convincing!
4. The movie focused well on it's two main plots (the dark phoenix and the mutant cure)!

What I didn't like:
1. Nightcrawler was not in the movie!
2. Colossus and Angel were not givin enough to do!

This movie had a new director, and for the most part he did a good job!

Bottom line: Fans of the comic books will love this collection!",1308700800,,1526,4.270833333333333

and
3. Three Digital copy discs!
Quality is really good for all of them. What more do you want at this price? (I got it in 30 bucks!). Its a steal for the fans. Just get it before april 2011 as the digital copy code expires then. After that, all you will get is 6 discs for the same price.",1289952000,3,539,4.046728971962617

2635857,4,B000HEVZ9E,"This is a review of the three X-men movies, X-men, X2 X-men Unintied, and X-men The Last Stand.

-X-men
This was VERY well done. YES alot of things are different then the comics, but then I could say the same thing about Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. whats important is that the movie captures enough of the essence of the comics and I feel this movie did that well. I thought it was a good movie to make Rouge younger, it links mutation much more to puberty. also its very good that she is the main focus of the story. through her we meet the X-men, we see how mutants are cast off from humanity, and can't interact with them. Wolverine of course gets alot of spotlight but thats because he's allways been a mojor X-man. Most of the charterisastions are spot on. Magneto and his motives are very relatible. True this Sabertooth may not be as beastil or intelligent as his comic counterpart, but he isn't all that bad. he does a good job for the most part. yes I admit Storm's charture is undervalued and she has that STUPID line. baring that its a good movie. good aciton, story telling, and effects. all in all its the Best X-men movie. Mystique also looks dramticly differnt then her comic counterpar, but thats no big deal. also neither she nor Sabertooth ever worked with Magneto. but no big deal, it works for this movie. Basicly this movie is introducing us to the X-men. we start of Rouge fininding about her powers, meeting Wolverine and then the X-men. Magneto has his plans set out and Proffessor X trys to stop them. there is a great action sequence at the statue of libarty and a good end result.

-X-Men United.
A Great follow up. in the first movie we are introduced to the mutants and the X-men. here we see how humans react to the mutants and how some humants go out of their way to kill the mutants. Brian Cox excells as Stryker! this movie is very loosly based off the X-men graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills. at least a few story elements are the same. X-men face Stryker (here a devout catholic who wants to destroy mutants), the X-men team up with Magneto, Stryker wants to use Prof. X to kill all mutants, etc. this movie expands and adapts these elments quit well. we get some new mutants this time round. Nightcrawler is well played by Cumming and well realised. Pyro is well done, as is Iceman. we get to see glimses of Colossos and a few other X-men. due to Berry's objections Storm is fleshed out a bit more, but not quit as well as in comics. There are hints at the Dark Phoneix storyline, but nothing more then that. mainly the story foucus on Stryker's plan to destroy all mutants. Magneto wants to alter that plan to destroy all humans. there are some wonderful sceans in this. such as when Bobby 'comes out' to his parents about being a mutant. Wolverine finding about bits of his past and his encounter with Stryker. how he finaly decids who he wants to be. Jean's sacrifice is well played. the movie dosent pick up on the fact Mystic is Nightcrawler's mom, but no bigy. Lady Deathstrick is different in this, but she is defitly a visuly threating villiean. the fight with her and Wolverine is great. all in all this was a great sequil.

-X-men Last Stand.
I can only ask, What went wrong? I would say it's because Bryan Singer wasn't involved, but then Superman Returns wasn't all that. I was disapointed by this one. the storyline didn't entirly make sense and the chartures were not fully devloped. most dissapointing of all is that Angel just watlzes along in this movie. we don't really get to know him. he just appears in one scean and then in the next. thats about it. the orgin of Dark phoneix is naff and unconvincing. as is her desire to have Wolverine kill her. Charles motives in this movie are unforgivible and very underhanded. Beast looked good but didn't do much. What got me was here are the humans ready to 'cure' all mutants. Dark Phoneix kills a buch of humans. wovlie kills her. then all of a sudden the humans are ok with mutants. they don't want to take repisels nothing. What the heck?! It makes no sense. we get to see alot of cameos of other mutants here. various x-men, Morlocks, the Brotherhood, Juggernaut, and so on. however in the end I was disspointed by this movie. it was an unworthy follow up to the first two movies. if a future X-men movie is made i honestly hope its better then this.

(Just when I thought Last Stand was bad along comes the abismal Wolverine Orgins which made less sense and was horrible.)

any way... in my opinon the First two X-men movies were VERY well done and worth seeing more then once.
the thrid is not. personly I'd say don't bother.",1277769600,2,4638,4.438967136150235

2635907,4,B000HEVZ9E,"It was an ambitious undertaking to do justice to this fantastical comic book franchise from the fertile mind of Stan Lee and company but I think all things considered,the producers got it pretty spot on.
Patrick Stewart is Prof. Xavier who runs a school for mutants. He has the power of super mind control and through his Cerebro chamber he can reach both humans and mutants at will,anywhere in e world. His counterpart and the running villan through all of these films is Magneto played by Ian McKellan. While Xavier prefers the non-violent solution to living with humans,Magneto prefers the path of direct confrontation and overthrow,leading to world domination(what villain doesn't?).
Each movie has its' strengths and weaknesses of course but I think the series goes from strongest to weakest in the order they were made. The first two were directed by Brian Singer and the first movie is a slam-bam winner all the way. The introduction of characters and side plots never interfere with the telling of the story. X2 slows down slightly as we get intro'd to some new characters and lose one in the end. Overall it's not as satisfying as the first but still good. The last was helmed by Brett Ratner. While some blame must go to the director for its' comparative lacklustre execution,Last Stand is just too ambitious,i.e it tried to do too much. There seems to be more plots,sub-plots,back stories and character introductions than the previous two put together. This slows the pace down as all strings endeavour to be tied and every ""T"" dotted,while the action has to stop or slow down to do so.
What doesn't vary throughout all these movies however are the special effects. There is no shortage of action in any of these films and the special effects are,overall,quite seemless and very effective and engaging. No complaints whatsoever.
Technically the DVDs have all been transferred beautifully and all are in their widescreen glories. Disc one has a myriad of special features such as so called ""branching"" scenes(extra scenes filmed but not included originally),a Charlie Rose interview,the Hugh Jackman screen test,a featurette,story boards,art gallery,animatronics,the trailer and some TV spots(phew!).Disc two has only a commentary track(which I found very odd)and it is to be found in,of all places,the ""languages"" section ! Disc three has director commentary,producer commentary,numerous deleted scenes and three alternate endings.
The DVD cases themselves are the newer cheaper kind snap cases that alot of the ""big boys"" are using now. Instead of the inner case being solid plastic,one side has a recycle sign cut into it and the side the disc sits in is spoke like,radiating out from the spindle. The spaces existing on both sides reveal the back side of the outer descriptive paper cover.
Of course there will be X-men-iacs who will find countless faults with these movies as far as characterizations and continuity from the long running comic book series. But for most casual readers and  uninitiated(to X-men)Sci-Fi/action lovers,I think you will be quite pleased with the overall result produced here. Creator Stan Lee himself had his hand in this series all the way so some modicum of accuracy to his ""child"" had to have been extant.
As a sidebar Fox has produced a Wolverine back story recently but it remains to be seen if anymore movies will be forthcoming from them re the X-Men,as the franchise rights will revert back to the hands of its' new owners,The Disney Corp.in a few years. Marvel also has some property deals going with Paramount and Sony which will also revert back eventually. It's amazing just how much product Disney will ultimately control with its'Marvel acquistion. Who would have thought that a little comic book company called Marvel would grow that big and be bought in the future for an approximate cool $4 BILLION(!).The mind does boggle.
This set is definitely worth owning,not only as the generally good films they are,but if only for its' price as it would cost you much more to but them individually. All the special features included on them sperately are all here in this set. So if you have been hedging whether to buy I would urge you to drop your nickel now when the price is right and get yourself a VERY entertaining trio of great Sci-Fi flicks courtesy of comic writer supremo,Stan Lee.",1258243200,,4344,5.0

2635946,5,B000HEVZ9E,"When it comes down to comic book movies, it's kind of strange that so far, the best has always been the first 2. Batman, Spider-Man and now the X-Men have had stellar movie and sequel only to have the third not be made as in Batman's case or the third being very underwhelming as in the case of X-Men and Spider-Man 3. Strangely enough, as with the case of Spider-Man 3, X-Men: The Last Stand had potential a really solid entry considering the storyline chosen. Spidey finally got to tangle with the Symbiote and Venom whereas X-Men 3 brought in the Dark Phoenix Saga, one of the best comic arcs ever so where'd it go wrong? Well even though it might be unfair to say this but it can largely be centered directly on Brett Ratner. Ratner is....how shall I put it, a serviceable hack, someone who can deliver entertainment but nothing more and that's kind of what separates him from the other better action directors, especially in the arena of comic book movies. At least Christopher Nolan and Bryan Singer brought in some food-for-thought notions as well as summer fun, Ratner seems purely interested in the fun and only barely skims on more weighty topics. Which makes this trilogy set not necessarily disappointing but lacking the grand finale it needs.

Bryan Singer, best known at the time for directing the Usual Suspects was hired to direct the live-action adaptation of the popular ""X-Men"" comic and many at the time were thinking ""this better not be terrible"". Imagine most people's surprise when it wasn't as it was actually good and not good in that wasn't-that-terrible way but it was legitimately fun. Casting worked, effect worked...mostly (that spin around the torch looks phenomenally fake as far as the character model) and that ""line"" by Storm is still cringe-worthy. But with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor X, the casting was quite spot-on and the fight scenes and set pieces are still quite dynamic. Not completely flawless but start of a successful franchise.

With ""X2"", Singer returns and in a way nearly makes a perfect comic book movie with only slight complaint I have is a small pacing issue. The characters open up, people get more comfortable in the roles and some new ones are interested, most notable being Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) who participates in probably the coolest opening sequence in awhile. Also new is ones such as Pyro and the supremely hot Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) but it also adds more to the mythology and bringing in characters and storylines from the comics. Colossus makes a brief appearance, as does the 2nd of 3 Kitty Pryde's and you got the making of an even better comic book movie.

In a strange role reversal, Ratner was supposed to do the next Superman while Singer was going to do X-Men 3 but then because of other commitments/troubles, they switched places and not to say Singer did a bad job with ""Superman Returns"" but the more mature and not as ""fluffy"" storytelling for a comic book movie probably turned people off but with X-Men 3, the movie did offer a lot more big-budget entertainment yet critically wasn't that well-received and really it's one of those movies that's not quite love-it-or-hate-it but rather a ""I don't want to hate it but I can't love it"" one as the action and events feel a bit more intense, the Dark Phoenix storyline is here (though it takes a backseat to the ""Mutant Cure"" one) and several characters make appearances and even expansions such as more screentime for Colossus and Kitty Pryde. But then again, the dialogue is a bit more awful, the handling of one character's death is a misstep with an understatement and the movie deals with the topic of mutant curing and what that can mean to a population and yet it's only surface level. So that's kind of the problem, Singer brought entertainment and brain food, Ratner just brought the popcorn.

With the release of the recent X-Men Origins (which again suffered from a lack of direction), we have this trilogy set that isn't as flawless as the original Star Wars or Lord of the Rings but rather like Spider-Man, a good first movie, an excellent second and a tolerable third.",1253491200,,4151,4.761111111111111

Thanks!

These movies are decent enough, but altogether infuriating for long term fans of the X-men. The director didn't seem to have any understanding of the characters and certainly not the fans. This is a lowbrow interpretation of what has for a long time been one of the most interesting and well-thought out comic book series.

Whoever was in charge of the casting should never be allowed to work in movies again; the feral-like short guy Wolverine was changed into a good looking actor who towered over the rest of the cast. Singer completely missed the importance of the physical attributes of the wolverine character- he is meant to be a grunt, a short guy who you underestimate. The makers of these movies simply decided to get a distinctly average actor to play the part mainly because of his appearance as a rugged clint easton type.

Next we have Jean Grey- whose entire character in the comics was based mainly on being the All-American girl who develops into the strong-willed soul of the team. So what do the makers do? They employ a 35 year old dutch actress to play the part. Honestly a 12 year old could have done a better job, but once again the makers of the movie went for a generic looking representation of the character that would appeal to general movie goers, rather than actually pay any attention to the comics. The actress playing Jean is actually older than the guy playing wolverine so the relationship between Wolverine and Jean Grey is never fully realised in the same way as it is in the comics. The makers have simply missed the nucleus of this relationship; Wolverine represents the side of Jean that even she isn't aware of. He is an annoyance to her, but she slowly realises that his emotive nature is as much a strength as a weakness. this was played out perfectly in the comics when they culminated in the Dark Phoenix saga. In the hands of the movie makers this storyline is disjointed, out of character, and plays out as little more than a cliched love story.

The other actors/actresses were similarly poor choices. James Marsden not only lacks the screen presence for a feature film, but his portrayal of the cyclops character misses the mark. Cyclops is the heartbeat of the team; he makes the decisions and is a natural leader. Marsden's character however is ponderous bore who couldn't lead to save his life. He isn't the all american guy, the one who is like a son to Xavier. In fact we never really see this part of his relationship, as he just seems to play the role of an inconvenient barrier to the (unnecessary and overplayed) love story between jean grey and wolverine. This is perfectly demonstrated by the third movie, when he finds his supposed lost love and is apparently killed by her offscreen. we simply get a gravestone at the end of the movie to signify how important he was to the plot that was 'developed' in these movies.

Storm was simply another example of lazy casting. The Storm character is one of the most important in the comics; she truly represented the underlying message of the x-men, which was the search for equality in the face of prejudice. At the time the character was introduced America was (and some say still is today) facing racial and cultural divides. Storm was not simply a strong female black character, like most of her teammates she wasn't even American. She went on to become leader of the X-men; a role she was reluctant at first to take, but in time she grew into. Her culture and her strength are therefore integral to the character. So why on Earth was an American actress given the role, and an American actress who didn't even try to make it sound like she had at least some kind of generic African accent (as the animated series had done so)? The casting of Berry also seems to be very lazy; did the makers simply ask who was the most famous Afro-American actress and is she pretty? The casting of Berry would suggest so; Storm is supposed to be a tall dark character. Is it any wonder that the character recieved minimal stage time and no character development? Once again the makers of these movies simply had no desire to pay any credence to the source material.

We can take further exception to the other actors involved. They employed a clearly English actor to play Xavier, when Xavier is meant to be American. This wasn't to change any part of the story, but simply because he is the most famous bald actor they could find. Well done. And for Magneto they chose an ageing Ian McKellen who simply didn't look like he would scare you. Also once again an English actor, to play a character from Poland/Germany who spent his subsequent years in Russia and Israel. Yet he souunds like he has spent all of his life in an English public school. It appears that the reputation and star-billing of the actors was more important than their ability to represent the character.

Moving away from the poor casting decisions, the unnecessary liberties taken with the basic plot were ill-thought out. The approach to telling this (and many other film's) story is to use a foil; a character whose introduction to the others mirrors that of the reader/viewer. This was originally played by the Kittie Pryde character, who went on to become one of the most popular X-men characters of all time (she turns up in the third movie, but her role at this point is only a minor one.) Kittie doesn't have the best of powers, she can walk through tangible things. But her role as the foil allows for her character to develop from almost naiive innocent, into a strong-willed independant young girl. She also takes on Wolverine as almost a father-like figure. Which is exactly what the first movie does; but for some reason Kitty isn't used, and instead the makers chose Rogue to play the part. Which was not only unecessary but also short sighted. Rogue is meant to be a former enemy of the X-men, a misguided soul who had stolen the powers of one of Wolverine's oldest friends. She is one of the most powerful characters in the comics, but her inaibility to tough others creates a a contrasting vlunerability to her character. She was given a place in the team through charity of their leader and against the better wishes of the X-men including Wolverine. When he begins to trust her this creates a strong bond between the characters and allows her to become an integral part of the team. Without this plot the character is pretty useless. She has no real power except to absorb memories, and can only play an introductory role for the other characters. Therefore by the second movie there is nowhere for the character to go, and unsurprisingly none of the scenes involving Rogue in the second and third movies are relevant or even remotely interesting.

Importantly Kitty Pryde, unlike the Rogue character, had an integral role in the development of the Magneto character. Like him she is Jewish, and when his actions in the comics endangers her life, he realises that he is going down the path of those who persecuted his own kind. But such a plot development could never work in the hands of a distinctly average director such as Singer. Character development and intricately intertwined plots are beyond the capabilities of the makers of these movies.

Moreover it is slightly frustrating for fans to have to put up with an introductory movie. Introducing characters can actually be done in a way which doesn't patronise the viewer; the Hellboy movie for example showed that you do not need an hour and a half to introduce five or six characters. By the time the second movie comes along thankfully the pace is somewhat quicker. But once again you are left with the feeling that the story simply doesn't go anywhere. There is the requisite face-off between Wolverine and a similarly powered enemy (which is little more than a rehash of the fight scene in the first movie against Mystique) but there are convenient plot twists that don't really make sense such as an entire valley being flooded and the absolutely unnecessary sacrifice of the Jean Grey character. It is fair enough that the makers might have felt that it would be too costly to recreate the comic storyline where Jean Grey lost her life in space, but they could have made this more compelling by having a necessary sacrifice for the character. By the time of the third movie, the arrival of the Dark Phoenix is not only unnecessarily rushed, but also absolutely misses all of the integral plot devices and overall message of the original Dark Phoenix story. Whereas Jean Grey is pushed away from her humanity by the hands of one the X-men's enemies, this Jean Grey has for no apparent reason becomce the embodiment of evil and has lost all of her humanity. The other part of the story involves Magneto attacking a research lab that is developing a 'cure' for the mutant gene. It isn't really very interesting, but is simply an excuse for a supposedly climatic brawl. The overtly political and liberal message of the comic books is simply nowhere to be found in these movies, except for unsubtle analogies to racial discrimination in parts of the first and second movies. They aren't handled very well at all, which is a shame when comparing these movies to the comic books.

Lastly a point also has to be made about the presentation of these stories. It probably might not have looked as gritty or real if the makers had tried to recreate the appearances of the comic books characters. Yet there isn't any effort at all to even capture the look of these characters. The X-men have always been one of the most vibrant and colourful teams in the world of comics, yet the movie takes this away and for some reason dresses them up in equally ludicrous latex suits. While Spiderman was able to capture the essence of the character and at the same time to add a sense of realism, the X-men movies don't even bother to try. For a fan of the comics, this is the killer blow. It is not only annoying and frustrating that the characters are poorly represented and the storylines fail to capture the essence or messages of the comics, but it is unforgiveable that it doesn't even capture any of their vibrancy or eye-catching qualities.

In short these movies are an absolute disappointment and a missed opportunity. Taken as a straightforward action trilogy with science-fiction elements they are decent. but when compared to the source material they are somewhat of a travesty and a clear example of lazy, lowbrow filmmaking that sticks two fingers up at the real fans to make unecessary and ill-concieved changes to the X-men. If you are in anyway interested in the X-men you would be better advised to wait for the animated series to be released. Although the animated series also has many unecessary plot alterations, the voices are well cast and the main storylines from the comics are actually incorporated very well into the series.

If you want to see the X-men done justice stick with the comics,the X-Men 90's animated series, and X-Men Evolution.",1250553600,12,11300,4.681429290387519

2635953,4,B000HEVZ9E,"I have to first say this is a very well presented trilogy.  The packaging is very nice, and includes all three X-Men movies, plus a bonus disc for each and a digital copy...that's 9 discs in the package!

I'm gonna break this down into Movie<BD Picture<BD Sound just to give a quick overview of each.

X-Men:  I was actually really impressed with this first film, I'm pretty new to the X-Men movies and finally decided to pick this trilogy up for my collection.  Its action packed and tells a pretty good story of the ""mutants"" and how they must hide from the regular humans who look down on them because of their advanced evolution. I won't give away any movie specific details, cause its kinda nice to see it for yourself.

Video:  Blu-ray transfer on X-Men was very well done, beautiful colors, crisp blacks, and decent whites...though some were a bit bright and almost washed out.  The outdoor scenes really popped off the screen, with sharp details really coming out...especially in the pine needles (very defined and great color)

Sound:  Sound was pretty decent, although some scenes had a bit of trouble with dialog (center) being faded and quiet during some action scenes...I found this surprising since BD seemed to fix this problem, which I found really annoying on DVDs in the past.

_______________________________________________________________________

X2:  Movie wise this was my least favorite of the 3.  I think the story was mediocre, and it almost seemed like they struggled with ideas.  I also was kinda mad about some of the old classic characters not being introduced or even having short cameo appearances.  All and all though pretty decent movie, and worth a watch...to get the whole story.

Video:  Very nice scenery in this one, the outdoor scenes are awesome as the camera pans over at a high angle!  The special effects are very well done and blend with the film very well.  I noticed a bit of grain in some darker scenes but that's understandable.  Again another very nice Blu Ray transfer here.

Audio:  About the same as above, action scenes are loud and punchy, with only one scene struggling from the sound drowning out main character voices...not a deal breaker though.

________________________________________________________________________

X-Men United:  Fun film, pretty good story, although the way the villains and hero's are brought together seems a bit distracting.  Id have to say this was my second favorite in the trilogy finishing out the story, but leaving enough wiggle room for a possible 4th movie?!?!  Shocker I know, but at the end credits I must say I was very happy with what I had witnessed, and actually took the final disc out thinking ""wow that was a pretty damn good experience""

Video:  A trifecta of good visuals is certainly delivered with this movie.  I was again very impressed by the small details, trees, rocks, etc that just really came off the screen.  The good thing is it didn't feel over done, and special effects again blended very well into the actual footage.  Bright colors, sharp edges, and crisp movement round this disc out well.

Audio:  This one seemed to have the best audio, for my ears at least.  The surrounding sounds and little details (glass breaking, debris falling, etc) were all very clean and sharp.  One scene near the end of the movie shows a structure being ""relocated"" and its excellent hearing the steel girders bend and snap, steel cables stretch to their breaking point, and concrete shattering and falling all around you.

Overall this is a very impressive audio/visual journey, the story is a bit slow at times but its a really nice trilogy to own, with great packaging and extras (namely the 3 full bonus discs, and digital copy of each film!)",1247011200,3,3748,4.909235668789809

2635975,5,B000HEVZ9E,"I got to hand it to Fox, they really mastered this blu-ray trilogy.  I was unimpressed by the lack of the Spider-man trilogy's special features.  I think anything being re-released onto blu-ray should have something new besides video and sound quality.  This box set is almost overloaded with features that kept me watching for hours and hours.

I found some of the features to repeat themselves, but for the most part they were worthwhile.  My absolute favorite was the one-hour special on the history of X-men comics found on the X3 special features disc.  I felt that alone gave me the ultimate satisfaction for purchasing this set.  I had the previous dvd copies, and this was a huge step in the right direction.  Thank you Fox!

Your blu-ray quality is about what you would expect for the series.  The first movie was in 2000 so I was most interested in that transfer. X-men had the most apparent positive transfer.  The other films have your standard blu-ray quality.  I wouldn't necessarily rate the films individually because you have all seen them by this point.  It is a great trilogy, with a rough third part.  I enjoyed the Singer movies a lot more than Brett Ratner's take.

If you're looking for a feature-packed blu-ray boxed-set this is a must have.  Don't buy in to those empty box trilogies they put out with nothing on them.  They will release a better version in time and it will aggravate you that you didn't wait.  I give my example on the Spider-man trilogy.  Will all these movies being such great hits, I can comparitively say that 20th Century Fox really did us justice on this release, and I hope more distribution companies recognize the bar that they have set.  Remember for those of you who dislike the features in the first place, it makes everyone happy to have an abundance of them.  The regular movie watchers can watch the film occasionally and be done.  Then the nerds like me can watch all the features and get our moneys' worth.  Putting out these box sets with nothing on them only satisfies a certain audience.

The picture quality and audio were great, they made it feel like they all were newer movies made for Blu-ray.  Definetly worth getting and even double dipping if at all possible.  The movie ticket is a nice touch as well.

I came out a few years ago but since I had a blu-ray player I held out for this collection. Any TV picture clarity expert will tell you that upscalling your dvds to 1080p won't look as good as a bluray movie.  The whole boxset is great! including the behind the scene action.

2636008,5,B000HEVZ9E,"Since the early sixties, the exploits of the X-Men have thrilled fans in one form or another. It was then that an up and coming comic book company changed formats and began telling stories that seemed more like real life. The X-Men was their look at racism as genetically different humans called mutants were hunted and hated for being who they were.

The stories continued when the comics got hotter in the late seventies and eighties and then it truly X-ploded in 2000 when Twentieth Century Fox released the first film called X-MEN. This was followed in 2003 by X-2 and in 2006 by X-MEN: THE LAST STAND. And on May 1st the latest in the series arrives with X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.

But that's not all that arrives this week. Fans of the films will be delighted to know that all three films will be released this week in blu-ray format in X-MEN TRILOGY. For those who love films this will be a major step up for the films that they have taken to heart. And for blu-ray fans it means you now have something special to add to your collection.

Let me start off by saying if you're not aware of blu-ray you need to be and soon. The format uses a different laser lens that offers more information and quality on the disc one normally uses in a DVD player. This means you get better quality picture with brighter brights and darker darks. It means a crisp, clear picture that is so sharp you could see pores on skin. And it means the highest quality sound you'll ever experience.

So a quick run down of the movies themselves and then what's been added here. X-MEN initiates the series with the introduction of two new members to the X-Men, Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman in a breakout performance). On the run they are aided by Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. This school actually hides, trains and helps mutants feared by the world. Xavier's nemesis is Magneto (Ian McKellan), another mutant who has formed the Evil Brotherhood of Mutants with the hopes of changing every human into a mutant.

The best part about this initial entry into the series was that it set up the world of the X-Men comic fans had been witness to for years. While complex to some, the story was actually quite simple. We were being offered a metaphor for the world of racism seen in the sixties. While Xavier was the representation of Martin Luther King, Magneto was Malcolm X. How to deal with being treated as unacceptable was shown by both these paths as either make people understand and force them to bear witness to your power. The X-Men told the tale for a generation not exposed to those times.

The movie was a landmark in special effects as well, offering the mutating abilities of the heroes and villains in a way not possible years before. Wolverine's trademark 3 admantium covered claws finally snikted their way out as did Cyclops eye popping laser like blasts. One of the biggest faults with comics to screen transitions in the past were the poor quality effects used. Between this film and SPIDER MAN, all that changed and comics leapt off the page and onto the screen. The current line up of films owes much to both films.

X-2 picked up where the first film left off with Wolverine searching for his past. A shadowy figure from that past, Col. Styker (Brian Cox) has made it appear that mutants are trying to kill the President. This gives him the chance to try and capture the students at the school and to take hold of Cerebro, Xavier's super computer that allows him to find mutants world wide. Stryker wants to use it to kill all mutants. An escaped Magneto gathers more mutants to him to stop Stryker along with Xavier and the X-Men.

Racism destroyed by genocide. Once more a ponderous question is lifted from headlines and inserted into comics then film. This movie played less with setting up the X world and delved deeper into the characters. While Wolverine was not around in the early X-Men comics, he did become perhaps the most popular character later on. The films have helped keep it that way, as much do to the popularity of the character as the actor who plays him, Hugh Jackman.

One of the nice things in this film was that in the tradition of the comic, new characters were introduced. Rather than sit back and retain the small crew of the first film, side characters from the first were given more on screen time and fan fave Nightcrawler was introduced as well. Unfortunately due to the desire for more cash, he disappeared by the third film.

X-MEN: THE LAST STAND introduced Hank McCoy, aka Beast, played by Kelsey Grammer. This time around when a cure for the mutant gene is found, Magneto asks why anyone would want to change from what they are. Recruiting an army of mutants, he sets out to capture the most powerful of them all to use as his personal weapon. Briefs summaries, yes, but they tell the story so far and the latest promises to give us more history on Wolverine and several new characters fans have been clamoring for like Deadpool and Gambit.

Many fans were left disappointed by this last entry. As a fan of both the comics and the films I think they're nit picking. The movie delivered the popcorn punch that most movie goers wanted to see and from the things I've read it has only been the die hard comic lovers who walked away finding it lacking. I will grant that most people in Hollywood can take something wonderful and thinking they can make it better, more often than not make it dreck. I just don't find that the case here as the film offers more characters and a continuing theme that runs throughout, the end of racism in any form.

So what else comes with this new blu-ray set? Not just the movies but tons of extras on each set including interviews, making of documentaries, behind the scenes documentaries, character development, audio commentaries, deleted scenes, theatrical previews, X-Men history, stills and more. And each of the three films comes with not only the movie and the extras but a digital copy of the film as well so you can download and watch them on any playback system you might own as well.

You might already own these films in your DVD library. And they each have most of the extras that are found here. But the chance to see these films in blu-ray perfection is a sight for tired eyes. I own both formats having collected the originals before, but in comparison this new format outshines normal DVDs by miles.

I've always felt that special effects films and high action films are what big screen televisions and blu-ray players were meant for. A low end drama will appear good on any screen and rarely heightens the drama by being increased in size and contrast. Special effects/action films are larger than life. They deserve the larger than life on screen treatment as well.

If you haven't purchased a blu-ray player or larger screen TV the time is now. Prices are dropping. The format wars between blu-ray and HD-DVD are over. And the DVD companies are making the best of it by offering some fantastic films. Consider the X-MEN TRILOGY one that needs to go to the top of the list. Fans and semi-fans will definitely be pleased.",1242604800,4,7169,4.594214229867084

A worthy collection, the special bundles thrown in along with this 9 pack disc is awesome.  Another noteable feature is to see the depth of Hugh Jackman maturing with each movie in leaps and bounds, i am sure 2009-2010 will see him emerge as the top 3 heroes in Hollywood",1242000000,,551,4.045871559633028
2636011,5,B000HEVZ9E,"Marvel Comics' popular mutant superheroes jumped to the big screen to become one of the most successful series of comic book films. Under the leadership of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), a group of mutant outcasts with amazing powers known as the X-Men, protect the humans who fear and hate them from their rival Magneto (Ian McKellen). This exciting trilogy also stars Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn, Shawn Ashmore and Anna Paquin. Both ""X-Men"" (2000) and X2: X-Men United"" (2003) were directed by Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects). ""X-Men"" well introduces the characters and the conflict between Xavier and Magneto. The solid storyline and some realistic human tension set this movie higher than previous campy superhero action films. ""X2"" is a big improvement over the original and certainly the best of the trilogy. The sequel has a complex but well-structured storyline and strong emotional subplots. The action sequences and visual effects are outstanding. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006) was directed by Brett Ratner (Rush Hour 1, 2 & 3). Though the second sequel lacks the strong emotive mood and rich character development of the first two films, ""The Last Stand"" does features some cool eye-popping visual effects, terrific action sequences and many new characters.

With the big theatrical release of ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" a few days away, 20th Century Fox delivers the blockbuster comic book trilogy on Blu-Ray and gives it the full ""Five Star"" treatment to become one of the must-have Blu-Ray box sets available. The entire trilogy is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture falls short of reference quality but all three movies look really great. The 5.1 DTS-HD audio is excellent. The entire trilogy box set comes fully loaded with special features including audio commentaries by the films' directors and production crew, behind-the-scenes footage, special effects featurettes, picture galleries, animatics, theatrical trailers, TV spots and deleted and extended scenes with optional audio commentary track. Overall, ""X-Men Trilogy"" scores an ""A-"".",1241136000,,2144,5.496969696969697
2636012,4,B000HEVZ9E,"""X-Men Trilogy"" ports over all the extras for all three films from DVD. Almost all of them are presented in standard definition. The only things I haven't been able to find just yet are the Easter Eggs from the previously issued versions on DVD. The third one does have some new extras on a second disc and also ports over the previously released extras. All three films have two commentary tracks that were on the original DVDs. I suspect that the high def transfer used for the box set two years ago were probably used here as well.

The first two films are the best of the lot--it's a pity that Bryan Singer chose to do ""Superman Returns"" rather than ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (or whatever his version of the early script was called)while Brett Ratner does an OK job with the material he's given, Singer had an innate sense of what worked best for the X-Men saga. Add in the fact that the original script conception was going to be much closer to the Dark Phoenix saga portrayed in the comic books and we have a missed opportunity with ""X3""

All three films look from very good to exceptional and have a natural film look to them. Nice detail, a sharp looking presentation and a strong color scheme are highlights for all three with the last of the three looking the best of the bunch. That's not to suggest that the first two look less than optimal--they look terrific.

Audio sounds terrific with strong 5.1 DTS lossless presentations that nicely capture the original theatrical presentations of the film.

All three films come with digital copies of the movies as well (something I don't have much use for but others might). Early editions of this also have a digital ticket that can be used for ""Wolverine: X-Men Origins"", ""Ice Age 3"" and ""A Night At The Museum 2"" you'll need to go on line and print up the actual ticket however. This is a very nice set.

You can also access an exclusive sneak peak of ""Wolverine: X-Men Origins"" using the Blu-ray Live special feature.

""X-Men""-4 stars for the movie, 3 stars for the SD DVD extras
""X-Men: United"" 5 stars for the movie for the SD DVD extras
""X-Men: The Last Stand"" 2 stars for the movie, 4 stars for the high def transfer and 3 stars for the SD DVD extras.",1240704000,11,2213,4.478908188585608
2636023,5,B000HEVZ9E,"Now this is the way Blu Ray sets should be done,this X-Men Blu Ray set is loaded and should satisfy X-Men fans,this is an obvious tie in with the upcoming Wolverine movie,dont be suprised if another Blu Ray set w/ the Wolverine film included will be available by holiday time though! This IS a great Trilogy!!!",1240444800,3,310,4.553571428571429
2636024,5,B000HEVZ9E,"Finally the X-Men moves made their transfer to hi-def and they look great. Nothing like seeing Wolverine go crazy on some baddies. The first of the films has the lowest ratio at 2.35:1 and looks a little less crisp than the other 2 films but still has good color and the black levels look great.

For those complaining that Fox is double dipping because they already released the 3rd film on Blu-ray. Well your in luck. You can buy the other discs separately. The new copy of the last stand is an even better transfer visually then the first version. So for those HD lovers out there it looks better.

If you already own the Last Stand on blu-ray this box set is still worth the price as it also includes digital copies of all 3 films.

2636025,5,B000HEVZ9E,I was waiting for this for long time. I have all the parts on DVD but i will get this trilogy and watch it again. If you like SF movies you got to have this one. Nice work again. Can wait to have this on my colection,1240012800,3,216,3.617021276595745
2636026,5,B000HEVZ9E,"For quite a while, if you wanted to see a good superhero movie, you needed to watch one based on a DC hero.  In particular, Superman and Batman dominated the box office (although the quality of the movies would be sporadic).  Movies based on Marvel characters were clearly second-rate.  That would change in 2000, when X-Men came to the screen.

Based on Marvel's most successful franchise, the movie followed the concept of the original comic book by focusing on a private school that is also a refuge for mutants.  Running the school is Charles Xavier, a wheelchair-bound telepath whose last initial would provide the name for the X-Men.  Although there are other superpowered mutants, clearly the focus of the story is Wolverine, an antiheroic loner with a hazy past, an incredible healing ability and an adamantium skeleton complete with retractable claws.  Opposing them is Magneto, a powerful mutant who, having been understandably scarred by the Holocaust, is now intent on not only stopping persecution of mutants but putting ""homo superior"" in power.

The success of X-Men came about for a number of reasons.  First of all, it was based on a hit comic book.  Second, it had good special effects, something that had not been available (either technologically or financially) to earlier Marvel adaptations.  Ultimately, casting would be the big difference.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen give classiness to the major roles of Xavier and Magneto and Hugh Jackman is wonderful as Wolverine.  The supporting roles are also ably played, and include once-and-future Oscar winners Anna Panquin and Halle Berry and even Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the thoroughly nasty Mystique.

Bringing all the elements together was director Bryan Singer, who would also handle the sequel, X2: X-Men United.  This follow-up story has Wolverine learning more about his past while the team contends with a rogue government operative who is intent on killing all mutants.  He does this by framing mutants for an attack on the president.  Singer would not be around for the third movie, having moved on to do a Superman movie with decidedly mixed results.

Instead, it would be action movie director Brett Ratner who'd do X-Men The Last Stand, which does indeed feel like the final chapter in a trilogy.  The plot in this story focuses on a supposed ""cure"" for mutants, which some feel should be forced on all superpowered folks.  Magneto is back and does not take kindly to the idea that being a mutant is an illness.  He becomes the leader of a resistance movement.  Caught in the middle is Famke Janssen's Jean Grey, who has acquired powers that make her nearly omnipotent, but also has caused her to become mentally unstable.

All three movies are pretty entertaining and well-made, so the X-Trilogy boxed set is a nice set to have.  It also represents the renaissance of the superhero picture, with not only other good Marvel movies (most notably Spiderman and Iron Man) but good DC ones as well (particularly Batman).  If you're a fan of this type of movie, the X-Trilogy is a pure pleasure to watch.",1239494400,,3088,4.97270955165692
2636027,3,B000HEVZ9E,"The rating is for the shoddy way the release is handled. I give the films 4-5 stars!

Ok, I love the looks of this set but since I already own the last X-Men flick on blu-ray, give me a reason to purchase the box set over buying the other films separately saving me about $10 bucks. Are there enough extras on this box set to warrant a purchase consisting of a disc I already own?

FOX is horrible about double dipping. Star Wars comes to mind!! For those of us fervent movie lovers, how about putting out a really great all inclusive box set so we can buy it once! Then for those happy with the bare bones film put it out as a single dvd! It's bad enough that our loyalty is abused by dropping the price 6 months later to half of what we paid for it. If we didn't support the releases of these films at the initial sales date, it is doubtfull the studios would make the effort to release them at all!!! FOX should offer a rebate for those who purchased the previous version included in the new box set!! By the way, FOX is doing the same with the Mary Tyler Moore series. Those of us who bought the first 4 seasons are now going to have to buy the whole series box set to complete our collection!",1239408000,10,1197,4.111111111111111

2636029,4,B000HEVZ9E,"I still remember when the studios announced that X-Men would be made into a movie. Now, several years down the road, the trilogy is complete.

For the movies, I'd say that X-2 is the strongest, followed by X-Men, with X-3 being the weakest of them all. Still, seeing my favourite superheros brought to life was good enough and they did a pretty good job with these movies.

For the product itself...again, a very typical boxset. There's nothing special about it...it's just a hard paper box with three regular-sized DVD cases with a single disc in each. There are no extras to speak of.

I like to collect things in sets so I opted to buy the boxset. However, if you're expecting anything special or bonus material, don't even bother.",1232496000,,734,4.674418604651163

2) This does not include the two-disc edition of X2, just the single-disc barebone version.

3) There will eventually be a two-disc version of X3.

4) Ummm... you do realize that a bunch of new X-Men movies under the moniker of ""Origins"" are being made, right? Why not wait for a box that includes ALL of the movies?

This is basically the X-Men equivalent of the Batman Legacy... wait for the Anthology.",1223596800,10,492,4.620689655172414

The other two movies are alright, but I don't know why, the second movie is in FULLSCREEN version, which I didn't like at all... The box is not too fancy compared with, say, The Lord Of The Rings Special Extended Edition, but what matters is what is inside. More extras would be great, but for the price is O.K. Don't get fooled by the ""alternative endings"" in the third movie, they don't change anything relevant in it. They are just scenes that didn't make it to the final edition. SPOILER: maybe the only difference is the scene in which Rogue changes her mind and tells Iceman she couldn't take the cure and remains a mutant.

PATRICK STEWART AND HUGH JACKMAN in particular. all in all these are some of the most enjoyable movies i've seen in quite sometime. if you pick this box up now while it's selling for 17.49, that's less than 6 bucks a movie. it's a tremendous bargain for 3 very enjoyable movies.",1204502400,,681,4.3700787401574805

I think every kid dreamt of seeing them on the big screen, but thankfully it wasn't done until all the tricks of cinematography were apt for such a task.  Patrick Stewart is a legend in every facet of the word.  He is an icon in acting and always steals the scenes with his genuine portrayal of his character.  Without an adequate Professor X, this would have been a HUGE FLOP!  Hopefully we can get a Hulk remake sometime but that's another story altogether.  I was kind of disappointed that Cyclops was so limited but I guess he had to be for the whole Phoenix / Wolverine story line worked into the movie.  Cyclops is massive in the comics!  Oh well.  I guess thats' where I have to allow for artistic liberties when the guys who own the story are translating from paper to film.

I want the most out of my box, give me the whole thing and I will buy, so I recommend against the collectors and completists like myself buying this set.

2636111,4,B000HEVZ9E,"Alright, here it goes.

Xmen 1 was terrible. Sorry. They chose a very good wolverine but the movie could have been so much more than it was. Isn't cyclopes the leader of the Xmen? Yeah I thought so. Isn't Wolverine the mean, could care less, arrogant, 5-foot-3, massive built killing machine? Yeah, but Hugh Jackman still played him well. Storm is such a loser in this movie. Sorry Halle. Perfect Prof. X. Bad Magneto, Sorry, er whatever ur name is. Mystique...um...was weird...and naked...and ugly. All the action was saved till the end. C'mon. And it seems they took these x-men from the Ultimate Marvel Universe instead of regular Marvel which was mistake number 1. This movie gets a 2 out of 5.

X-men 2 was way better. Again Cyclops is played as the wimp in the background and Wolverine seems to be the leader of the X-men. The school being attacked was great. Storm got a little better, but still lame. Rogue is such a loser and so is Iceman. Doesnt Rogue fly? Yeah I thought so. Is Iceman really gonna do nuthing the whole movie? Yeah pretty much. They should rename this movie, Wolverine and the X-men because that's what it is. And Jean? Pheonix? For real? Was that a huge giant fire-bird image in the water? Yep. Can't wait for X-3! 4 out of 5 stars.

X-men 3 is an action-packed thriller no matter what anyone sais. The action is non-stop from beginning to end. It's straight out X-men, juggernaut, Brotherhood of Mutants, police, and everybody else BRAWWLL!!That's what I'm talking about. Too bad they killed of punk-Cyclops in the very beginning. Singer took him and went to work on Superman and it's apparent that he is not very much into action-packed thrillers. Anyway, this is a must have. Halle yelled at the producers so they gave her a bigger role. Seriously. Anyway,although a depth of story isn't explored the action makes up for it ten-fold and I forgive them. Great scenes. Only one thing. Remember Pheonix. Well...the bird isn't there. How can you have a pheonix without the bird. Obviously they got this silly idea from Ultmate X-men comic books. Pheonix is not supposed to be a level of Jeans power. Pheonix is the bird, guardian of that crystal thingy from outer-space who comes and takes over jeans body and causes major problems for the x-men. But given my take on X-1 and X-2, I forgive them because this is much better. Truthfully, I would just get the third one if youve seen the previous ones already. 4 out of 5 stars.",1179878400,2,2453,4.63448275862069
2636112,2,B000HEVZ9E,"Intra galactical space travel with twisted plots, too long, too boring, too sleepy. Mediocre acting, missing plot continuity and light-years away from STAR WARS quality. If wasting time is not your goal, don't waste the money !!!!!",1179792000,,231,5.27027027027027
2636113,4,B000HEVZ9E,Great special effects and story line.  The character of Hugh Jackman leaves much to be desired.  His person who is supposed to be a leader with integrity comes off as self centered and not admirable. Magneto on the other hand is a true villan who has a good end.,1179100800,,262,4.326530612244898
2636114,4,B000HEVZ9E,"I never read the X-Men comics, so I have no comparison to make me a genious on the characters and their history when it comes to determining how the movies add up.  Based on other reviews from those who are well versed in the comics' background, it seems that these movies were a flop, especially part 3.  Based on what I know from the films, I wouldn't let part 3 keep me from investing in this box set.

I thought Bryan Singer did an amazing job of finally getting X-Men to the big screen.  For those like me who were experiencing X-Men for the first time, I was well pleased overall with the first and second films.  I was highly disappointed that Singer would not be returning for the 3rd installment, but he too had given up on X-Men and moved on to the Superman sequel (which was excellent, by the way).  In passing it off to Brett Ratner, I had high expectations since I thought Ratner did a great job with Red Dragon.  However, that was not the case.

In part one, we are introduced to a handful of the X-Men characters including favs like Jean Gray, Cyclops, Storm, and Wolverine making up an excellent team to do battle against the bad guys, Toad, Saber Tooth, Magneto, and Mystique.  The special effects were pleasing and the hopes of a sequel were undoubtedly there.

However, the problem with part two is that all the old guys are back along with the hint of a lot of new characters that are being ""taught"" by Professor X.  These include Iceman and Pyro.  The problem is that the big name actors get all the screen time, leaving these ""new"" X-Men characters badly underdeveloped.  The obvious age difference between the original cast and the newcomers makes this very clear.  The one exception to Part 2 is Alan Cummings playing Nightcrawler.  He is a superb addition to the cast and his storyline fits perfectly, adding spice to the overall movie.

Unfortunately, Nightcrawler is not even mentioned in Part 3.  And all those ""new"" X-Men still don't get much screentime.  Although there is one cool fight scene between Pyro and Iceman, the screen is still cluttered with pubescent X-Men characters waiting to shine.  Wolverine and Storm smother the screen. Cyclops and Professor X are killed off. Mystique's powers are stripped. Jean Gray returns as the Phoenix.  The scenes you saw in the trailor with Angel are actually the only scenes in the movie of him.  It was practically a cameo. All of these storylines going in every direction, and yet the special effects are extremely lacking.

My hopes is that like the Batman franchise, X-Men will be left alone for a few years and a new director and a new production company will bring it back a few years from now with a whole new outlook, finally giving some of those underdeveloped characters a chance onscreen.  Rumor has it that Hugh Jackman will be back next year for a Wolverine movie all to himself.  Will we see Storm in her own film as well (Hello! Did anyone see Halle in Catwoman?)?

For those who enjoy comic book hero movies, there's no reason not to buy this set and add it to your collection.  As a trilogy, they are good movies that yes, don't relate well to one another as far as continuous character or plotlines; they aren't as blockbuster strong as the Spiderman movies, but they don't get as silly as the third and fourth Batman movies did either.  I think they are just the victims of either bad writing, poor budget, or too many big name actors wanting to be the center of attention.

2636145,4,B000HEVZ9E,"Brett Rattner and Bryan Singer, as directors, have entirely different takes on the mythology of the X-Universe.  While watching the first two, Singer takes you on a journey, bending a LOT of rules, but with reverence to get the main idea across.  Then you come sliding into third and CRASH!  Rattner slams you over the head with over-the-top action, shocking murders, destruction of a kind by the Phoenix never imagined by the comic book.  Phoenix was definitely unleashed in the movie, but the action was so jarring, so many different things were going on with the mutant cure, Phoenix's resurrection and subsequent ""trance"" since all she did was stand around and look forbidding, suspected love triangles with Bobby, Rogue and Kitty that the movie lacked reasonable coherence.  If you are an X-fan who loves anything anybody throws at you with no regard for respect, this is the trilogy for you.  If you are an X-fan who won't like ""just anything"" but still love the X-men in any incarnation this is for you.  If you are an X-fan who won't like just anything but just likes to pick stuff apart, this is for you.  And if you're not an X-fan but like lots of action, this is for you.  If only Rattner hadn't blown it!  The brightest spot in X-3 was Kelsey Grammar's take on Beast.  ""Fascinating!""  And the first two--HUGH JACKMAN as Wolverine-didn't think he could pull it off but he does.  The extras are boring IMO though, since I tend to not care about extras.
