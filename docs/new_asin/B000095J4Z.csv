7989615,2,B000095J4Z,"Simply put, this movie lost me fairly quickly.  For one thing, a nineteen year old cannot pass for a thirteen year old no matter how young she may look.  The characteristic thirteen-year-old outbursts seems over acted when done by an adult.  Then there was the utterly self centered lifestyle of all the adults.

One could hardly find a family that more thoroughly and consistently violated about every traditional family value there is.  If you like a believable heroine in your movies, and if you care at all about unnecessarily exposing your kids to immorality, you'd do best to skip this loser of a movie.",1269475200,9,609,4.8173076923076925
