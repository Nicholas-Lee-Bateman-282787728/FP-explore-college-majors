7817066,5,6301919106,"The dim-witted Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties has this video to himself, with a few guest appearences, of course.
Vol. 6, Canadian Gothic includes:
Four fabulous episodes of Dudley, from marrigolds to tying ladies to railroad tracks. Mr. Peabody even get into the mountie spirit when he and Sherman visit the first mountie. Witches are all over the place in Fractured Fariy Tales, and Rocky and Bullwinkle make a guest appearance.",1003968000,,431,5.084507042253521
7817067,5,6301919106,"This is the perfect addition to the Rocky & Bullwinkle collection.  In volume 6, there is more focus on Dudley Do-Right with four episodes of the  loveable dim-witted mountie.  Don't worry, Rocky & Bullwinkle show up  in Bullwinkle's corner and Mr Know it all.  Also included are Fractured  Fairy tales, Aesop and son, and Mr Peabody and Sherman.  This is one of the  shortest of the tapes, clocking in at 39 minutes, but you won't regret  making it part of the collection.  Warning: Laughing will occur!",967420800,3,504,4.755813953488372
7817068,5,6301919106,"This one is an odd-ball in the series in that it doesn't have a Rockie & Bullwinkle episode on it, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. Personally, Dudley is my favorite of the little shorts used to break up the  R&B episodes, so having a tape dedicated to Dudley was a plus for me.  In addition to the 4 Dudley-Do-Right episodes, you also get Aesop and Son  talking about barking dogs, Simple Simon on Bullwinkle's Corner, Fractured  Fairy Tales take on a Bewitched Prince Charming, Mr. Peabody and Sherman  travel to Toronto (fitting for Canadian Gothic, isn't it?), and Mr. Know-It  -All shows How To Be A Stunt Moose!",964569600,,621,4.6
