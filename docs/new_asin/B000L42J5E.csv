I found ""The Plow That Broke the Plains"" especially riveting.  The black and white presentation further lends barrenness to these accounts and focuses the viewer more closely on the mechanized devastation.  The films demonstrate to what extent the federal government involved itself in national environmental crises in the 1930's, an involvement which may not be possible to repeat today in spite of a much higher environmental awareness across the population.  Conservationists, environmentalists, and political historians should enjoy and learn from these documentary films.",1179273600,21,703,5.730769230769231

2699783,5,B000L42J5E,"Pare Lorentz's two groundbreaking 1930s documentaries, paid for by the US government and making no apologies for their propagandist intentions, are here presented with the evocative scores by composer Virgil Thomson played in modern sound by the Post-Classical Ensemble with Angel Gil-Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez conducting. There are unnerving modern resonances in these two films, one about the plow's partial destruction of the great plains that led to the Dust Bowl (reminding us of the modern near-depletion of the Ogalalla aquifer in that same area), and the other about upstream flood control containment by dikes and levees of the Mississipi for 1000 miles of its length, touted as a great marvel of man's taming of Nature but as we now know contributing to such things as the awful destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina.

The black-and-white films themselves are visually beautiful. The cameramen sent to photograph scenes used in the film included such luminaries as Paul Strand. The narration, written by Lorentz, is poetic.

Thomson's music is simple-sounding and triadic in the extreme, making use as it does of such tunes as the Doxology ('Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow', scored differently and aptly at different points in 'The Plow') and 'Go Tell Aunt Rhody.' And it is both esthetically and emotionally satisfying. The DVD makes use of a modern re-recording of Thomson's scores, and the new recording of the original voice-over narration is nicely done by Floyd King. There is, however, the option to play both films with the original scores' 1930s soundtrack music conducted by Alexander Smallens. We also get a couple of interviews with George Stoney, later himself a distinguished documentarian but in the 1930s a PR person for the government; he showed the films to groups of citizens in the Southeast and recalls many details about the films' origins and their initial reception. Joseph Horowitz talks with composer Charles Fussell, a student of Thomson's, about the scores. (It might be noted that there has been a recent CD on the Albany label that presents both Thomson's and Fussell's cello concertos, and very nicely done, too.) There is a 1979 audio-only interview with the late Virgil Thomson in which  he talks about the two films and about film-scoring in general.

I had been familiar with the scores of these two films for many years. As I grew up in the Dust Bowl area, I remember many stories of that awful period and had been particularly interested to see 'The Plow'. (As a small bit of irony, I now live in the Vermont town where the inventor of that plow, John Deere, learned the blacksmithing trade.) I must say that I was thrilled with both films. These are important documents restored to their original luster.

Enthusiastically recommended.

2699804,5,B000L42J5E,"Contains the two most famous Pare Lorentz documentaries ""The Plow that Broke the Plains"" (1936) and ""The River"" (1937). Both were paid for by the federal government, done as collaborations, and are at the same time obviously Pare Lorentz' individual creative works of love. Given the year, both are of course Black and White with 4/3 aspect ratio. Quoting the jacket: ""...landmark American documentary films. Aesthetically, they break new ground in seamlessly marrying pictorial imagery, symphonic music, and poetic free verse, all realized with supreme artistry.""

The films are famous for photographers shooting without any clear instructions or even a general story line, and being constructed almost entirely during editing and composition. While breaking new ground aesthetically, the films conformed to the canonical ethics of documentary filmmaking of that time. Those ethics have shifted over time, so some nowadays could be upset that there are some re-creations, some staged sections, some bits of stock footage of questionable provenance, and even one bit that's in fact excerpted from a feature film. But these things that might excite film historians are not even noticeable to the average viewer.

The compositions and contrast in the pictures are remarkably good. Although they're three quarters of a century old, they don't take a backseat to anything, and they don't feel like something discovered in the musty archive vault of a library that you ""should"" see. Objects like running water, clouds, grass, fur, mud, and flames that once might have been difficult are pictured with no problem at all. There are lots of striking compositions and lots of motion. (There are a few stills that ""move"" too. Obviously the ""Ken Burns effect"" is a lot older than Ken Burns, as it's used unobtrusively here.) Bits of film were gathered from many different sources; some bits are of significantly higher quality than others. There are almost no scratches or blotches. In a few places both films suffer from a little bit of flicker in light intensity, or some broad vertical streaking, or ""crawling"" of visually monotonous areas  ...but these problems are not overly noticeable. I don't know which of these were in the original, which are due to ""age"", and which are transfer artifacts.

New soundtracks were performed from the original score and script by a new orchestra and narrator, are available on the DVD in both 5.1 and stereo downmix, are high quality orchestrally, and are recorded in very high fidelity (the old original stereo soundtracks are also available as a DVD alternative). Only the one bit of ""location"" sound on the original soundtrack (wind) is missing from the new soundtrack  ...and even on the original soundtrack its quality was distinctly less than the music and narration. (The last DVD alternative [four in all] is the new soundtrack in DTS, so if you have a high end system and want to really crank it up, you can.) The new soundtracks are actually slightly longer, because three brief bits of scored music that weren't used originally have been restored. The music is based on common American tunes of the time (including hymns) and is deceptively simple. If you've wondered what were the ancestors of the style of music in the musical ""Oklahoma!"", here's one. ""The Plow that Broke the Plains"" music was written after the film was edited; ""The River"" music was composed and the film edited together - in both cases the music matches the images quite closely.  The new soundtrack is extremely well done; in fact it's the standout feature of this DVD. The original soundtrack isn't half bad either - good recording technology back then had not that much more distortion than we expect today, and had no pops or hisses at all.

The films were closely associated with the New Deal (nowadays we might more likely classify them as some of the first [wrongheaded:-] glimmers of environmentalism). ""The Plow that Broke the Plains"" is about the ""dust bowl"", and ""The River"" is about the need for massive Mississippi watershed flood control programs that cross state lines. They were originally didactic, almost propagandistic. Yet they stay far away from blatant pandering or advocating for any particular plan or action (except brief sections on Robert E. Lee and on the TVA in ""The River""). They do contain a few startling sequences -such as the repeated cuts that equate WWI tanks with tractors, but these felt isolated to me.

Separated from the specific political environment the films were released into so many years ago, they felt ""mild"" to me - I was expecting something much more forceful, but it isn't here. (Except the bit on Robert E. Lee -having no real connection to the theme of the film- was obviously added to ""The River"" to make it more acceptable to Southern audiences.) Either styles have changed a lot, or I have significantly less context than I'd like to think. It's still a bit of a mystery to me why the federal government paid for public relations films with so few specifics or calls to action. (""The Plow that Broke the Plains"" earilier had an ending with specifics about federal dust bowl programs, but that was changed before that film was ever released. And the specific and propagandistic Tennessee Valley Authority segment of ""The River"" was excised from many copies only a few years after the film's initial release  ...although it's still in its original place in ""The River"" on this DVD.)

The DVD menus are not fancy, but are adequate to get the job done without error or confusion. DVD extras include some insightful oral essays and interviews, and some commentary by Virgil Thomson (the composer) himself. (One of the Virgil Thomson extras is audio only over a black screen.) The DVD is ""dual layer""  ...as are many these days, although few say so explicitly. A booklet with six pages of text of notes and comments accompanies the DVD.",1365379200,4,5900,4.991861648016276

2699806,5,B000L42J5E,These stories of the breaking up of the middle of our country and a river which drains it should be viewed by every American. The music by Virgil Thompson is not very well known outside of a pretty limited audience of 20th Century enthusiasts. Both documentaries are vivid portrayals of important facets on our country. Virgil Thomson's music is quite simply wonderous. If you are familiar with the work of current American composers you will hear where many of them got their ideas about scoring and context. This man deserves to be better known -- I am glad I happened upon this DVD. Hearing the music in it's original form and purpose was illuminating. I focused on the music here but the visual and informational aspects of these documentaries are exceptional too. The Naxos DVD production is flawless. Kudos to them for this offering as well as the City DVD with music by Copland. My Oh MY--  Naxos has come a long way from the budget purveyor of classical music it used to be. What a great label !!,1355011200,2,1004,4.608938547486034
2699807,4,B000L42J5E,"The Plow That Broke The Plains and The River are two unforgettable Pare Lorentz's documentaries about the Dust Bowl where the land was ruined, dust storms, sand storms, drought, poverty, and hunger existed in the plains to drive hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to California.

While the DVD is excellent, there are some extras that they could have added to make it more special. While the Dust Bowl is a part of American history of weather, soil conversation, and the Great Depression, there could have been more features to make the documentaries more interesting.

It's ironic that the man on the cover of the DVD is the father of a dust bowl survivor in the PBS documentary, ""Surviving the Dust Bowl (The American Experience)."" They could have discussed or brought how the films helped shape American understanding. The extras included interviews including an audio interview with the late Virgil Thomson. While the film director, Pare Lorentz, and music director, Virgil Thomson, are both geniuses in helpnig explore the Dust Bowl.

The ""Plow that Broke the Plains"" is a black and white classic that returns the viewer to the dust bowl of the Great Plains during that time, and documents the migration of people in search of jobs primarily in the Western United States.

""The River"" chronicles natural disasters that befell other parts of the country, and shows how nature was eventually harnessed to benefit all.

Hard to believe what the video reveals and what you read in the book, but the video gives the sad 'spin' that was promoted at the time.

2699812,4,B000L42J5E,"I recently read ""The Worst Hard Time,"" a books about the Dust Bowl years that mentioned this Depression-era, government-funded movie. One of the book's recurring characters, Bam White, also appeared in the film -- playing himself, a farmer trying to coax life from a parched, dusty earth. The film is pedantic by today's standards, as it tells the story of the cattlemen and farmers who made a living from the Great Plains. It takes us from the boom years of the First World War, when high wheat prices encouraged settlers to populate the plains, to the post-war years when overfarming caused the soil to blow off the farms. That makes ""Plow"" fascinating, in that it did not shy from showing the plain truth that individuals can be affected by government policies and world events that are beyond their control.

""The River"" tells a similar story about the deforestation and flood control along the Mississippi. The lumber industry in Minnesota and other northern states stripped the land of its water-holding power, which resulted in loss of topsoil and increased flooding downriver. The last part of the film is a paean to New Deal efforts to correct the damage, including efforts by the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) to replant denuded acres, and by the Tennessee Valley Authority to tame the river's precarious nature and generate electricity.

Great period films with a somewhat heavy handed message, but great first-hand photography about an important era in American history. The film's video and audio have been restored, and won't detract from the experience of those with modern audio-visual expectations.",1249603200,,1619,5.128787878787879

And, for the content?  These films should be shown in every U.S. History class in every school in the country every year.  Five stars aren't enough to rate this DVD.  It deserves a 6 or 7.  (Technical quality is excellent, too.)",1490227200,2,573,4.549019607843137
8160076,5,B000L42J5E,"These are two documentaries about the ravages of the land by poor land management.  The first documentary is ""The Plow That Broke The Plains"".  It is about the devastation of the Great Plains during the ""dust bowl"" era of the Great Depression.  The documentary was commissioned by the Roosevelt Administration.  This documentary predates ""The Grapes of Wrath"" novel and movie.  It is a great study aid.  I, as an adult, completely enjoyed it.  However it is painful and stark.

The second documentary is ""The River"".  It is about The Mississippi River Network.  The documentary is not only about the rivers.  It is about the exploitation of the land.  It is painful to watch the results of poor land management and the over harvesting of the forests.  There is film footage about flooding.  Presumably the flooding resulted by the ravages of deforestation.  I loved the film footage and the narration.  But it is not fun to watch.

Watching both of these documentaries is well worth the time and effort.  Thank You...",1478044800,,1017,4.882352941176471
8160077,5,B000L42J5E,"Virgil Thomson is not very well known today. Even when he was known beyond the borders of the music profession, it was mainly as the very opinionated music critic of the New York Herald Tribune  it was virtual blasphemy in those days not to accept the popular view that Arturo Toscanini was the greatest living conductor, and Thomson did not accept it. He wasn't even overly impressed with Jascha Heifetz, generally acclaimed as the reincarnation of Paganini. Yet he remained an important presence for the entire fourteen years of his tenure at the Trib.

As a composer, he was known mainly as the creator of the opera Four Saints in Three Acts with libretto by Gertrude Stein. He actually composed a great deal more, which was not surprising given his years of study, especially in Paris with Boulanger and others. The scores for these two films represent his most successful works, widely heard and praised. They create an atmosphere of Americana comparable to the compositions of Charles Ives and Aaron Copland with many references to cowboy songs, traditional spirituals and hymns, and songs popular in the nineteenth century.

Thomsons harmonies in these scores are more conventional than in other of his works. Since they were designed to enhance the frankly propaganda effects of these New Deal documentaries, it was essential that they be readily accessible to wide audiences, typically made up of people who had never heard of serial technique and other modern forms. He does allow himself a few dissonances and a fugue or two, but overall this music would not be shocking to Schubert. Thomsons scores are easy-going, tuneful, worth repeated hearings. This recording does them proud, as do the sound engineers.

Both films became very popular and may well have helped implement aspects of FDRs economic policies. The River actually came in first at the Venice Film Festival of 1938 for best documentary, beating out Leni Riefenstahls spectacular study of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Olympiad. That an American, indeed an American government film could come ahead of a Nazi film in Fascist Italy in 1938 was really remarkable.

8160079,5,B000L42J5E,"""The Plow That Broke the Plains"" did in a number of ways break new ground. For a government-sponsored film that's very definitely advancing a particular administration's agenda, it's remarkably shaded, complex and ironic. (Some of that ambiguity may have been generated by the conflict between Lorentz and his cinematographers, Paul Strand and Ralph Steiner among them, who threatened to walk away from the film if it didn't make it clear that the Dust Bowl was a man-made ecological disaster--a pretty standard interpretation of events today.)

There are any number of remarkable sequences, some of which rely heavily on stock footage. It would have been almost impossible for Lorentz to have made his low budget film without recourse to this material. Hollywood, however, was loathe to lend any aid or comfort to a project it regarded as a potentially mortal threat: a film with a political agenda made (in part) with government money. Renegade director King Vidor was instrumental in clearing the rights for a lot of this stuff.

The film's most outrageous use of black humor comes when our narrator, Thomas Hardie Chalmers, informs us of a grand piece of luck that will soon rescue the poor famers of the Great Plains: ""a day of new causes . . . new profits . . . new hope!""--all thanks to the outbreak of the First World War. This completely cheerful news is announced with a brilliant fanfare and a massive explosion. ""Wheat will win the war!"" Chalmers predicts with glee, as a sure and steady military march accompanies a montage pitting American farm tractors against the enemy's tanks.

Of course wheat *does* help win the war. All the same, it takes a particularly skewed point-of-view to celebrate the economic wel-lbeing of the American wheat farmer at the cost of 37 million casualties worldwide. Lorentz was particularly fond of the unreliable narrator--there are moments in his films where his narrators come off like used car salesmen--and he employed this device often when he wanted us to question an old line of thinking.

Even when he wants us to be moved, Lorentz and his composer Virgil Thomson aren't shy about using irony. During a haunting montage surveying the utter desolation wreaked by the Dust Bowl, the worst man-made ecological disaster in American history, Thomson quotes the 1674 Thomas Ken hymn ""Praise God, from whom all blessings flow."" It's a wry commentary on this great vast grassland paradise we managed to lay to waste, without even trying, in less than 40 years.",1439251200,2,2505,4.985645933014354
