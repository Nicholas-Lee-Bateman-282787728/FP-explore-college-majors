3045997,5,B00104AYQU,I have always liked the Dragnet TV series.  i beleive that the origional series in the 1950'S was away ahead of it's time.  Jack Webb knew how to reach the public with an adult TV series in the 1950'S.  It was not a violent shoot em up series but a factual account of real life happenings of on the street crime in Los Angales.  I would give this TV series at least 5 stars.,1300665600,5,374,4.013513513513513
3045998,1,B00104AYQU,"I read the only review on this product, but was wanting this set so bad, that I ignored the review.  I was expecting Seasons 1-6.  But what I got was 6 DVD's with 4 random episodes on each DVD. What a disappointment.  At them same time, I ordered the Sanford and Son DVD Set.  It has 6 seasons, but 146 episodes.  Its my own fault.  I thought Volumes was the same as Seasons.  But I love Dragnet.  I just wished I owned all of the episodes.",1277078400,68,440,4.034883720930233
3045999,1,B00104AYQU,"Am I missing something? 24 shows on 6 DVDs? And these episodes ran for a half hour on TV, so that means they're really about 22 - 24 minutes without commercials. So, that's 4 episodes per disk...and all this for almost fifty bucks. No way! They could have fit all of the episodes on two disks for about $20, and left room for special features.

Hold off for a special edition, or something like that. Dragnet (the 1950's version) was much too good of a show to get this type of treatment!

UPDATE - Feb 2011:

Since I wrote this review in 2008, they have knocked off about twenty bucks from the price and are offering it today (2/8/11) for $29.99. That's still a little steep, but better than the $50 price tag back in 2008.",1229904000,101,724,4.3088235294117645
