8070433,5,B0009YDRSO,"Mikki Senkarik is one of the very best fine artists in America today.  In this DVD her work is beautifully displayed and the presentation is both tasteful and clever. The music is tasteful but a little slow for my taste.  Overall I really liked the DVD and I play it from time to time.  I may purchase her new coffee table book when it comes out.  If you have never seen a Mikki Senkarik painting, be aware the colors on her work is both vivid and exquisite.  I think she uses the best color palette in america.",1142208000,2,511,4.22680412371134
