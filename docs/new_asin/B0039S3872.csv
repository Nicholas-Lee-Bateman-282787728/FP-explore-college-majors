And also commendable racial diversity.  If your tired of seeing women of color in sexless sidekick roles, Lola is the movie for you.

Ashleigh Sumner (Lola) is the real deal.  Jill Bennett has to be one of the most beautiful women on the planet.  Did I mention sexy?  Yes.  Yes I did.  Buy it now.  You'll watch it more than once.

It is injected with humor, even cartoon wizardry, as Lola tries to make her life right while literally racing against time as she navigates the steep hills and sidewalks of scenic San Francisco. With all odds against her, she attempts to complete a task which tests her stamina and commitment.  Sure it is a lesbion version, but even straight folks like me will get a kick out of it!

The whole movie takes place in like 5 locations. There doesn't appear to be a sound effects budget and scenes are animated where they couldn't shoot.

The entire plot appears to be that every lesbian wants to sleep with every other lesbian.  The movie is full of unnecessary sex scenes. The characters feel objectified. The craptastic sound track only makes the nightmare worse. Why are so many of the actors sporting terrible tattoos?",1450310400,,565,4.6767676767676765

Poorly written dialog.  Very one dimensional wooden performances.  The story manages to be tired, uninspired, and self indulgent all at the same time.

The women had great faces, beautiful in some cases, which is not necessary but nothing wrong with a great face once in awhile, right? I think they were counting on the great faces to carry the plot though. It doesn't happen like that, well, at least for me. I need an intelligent, snappy, get to the point conversation, a intriguing plot right from the get-go, or at least to get me through the first 15 minutes, and enough chemistry between the actors to set the set on fire. This did none of that, and I'm very sorry, because I just wanted to love it. That's all. But I didn't and I confess I couldn't make it to the end because I had to watch too much running in SF, not enough scenery to make me even near homesick, and too much ridiculous give and take conversation with the ladies trying so hard to achieve ""coy"",(not coitus!). Coy is just unbelievably stupid in the over 14 crowd. To see grown women act like they've never flirted with another woman in their lives is just dumb. Coy is SO not a goal, nor an MO for grown women, please, people, do you not see that? Its embarrassing to sit through, I'm hoping that my straight friends aren't watching (I'm guessing they are not, but still) this and judging us all by it.

The main star spent her time under deadline running to a print shop, and then running to the studio where the two smoochie characters were, and confronting traffic.

If you like conventional narratives that resemble a Lifetime Original (with lesbian characters) then this is definitely NOT the movie for you.  But, if on the other hand, you've watched the German cult classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Run-Lola-Run/dp/B000021Y77/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Run Lola Run</a>&nbsp;and have a sense of humor then you'll probably enjoy this film.  It's nice to see lesbian characters who don't appear to display any angst about being lesbians and the tale is told with a lightness and humor that's often lacking in lesbian fare.  It's unconventional, but that's what makes it fun and if you have watched ""Run, Lola, Run"" you'll probably appreciate many of the film's deliberate references to it.  In fact, I'd strongly recommend watching the German classic before taking on this film so you can enjoy that aspect of it.  Think of ""And Then Came Lola"" as light, late-evening snack.

4097333,4,B0039S3872,"This romantic comedy follows the perennially late Lola (Ashleigh Sumner) on a race through the streets of San Francisco in an effort to help her girlfriend Casey (Jill Bennett) secure an advertising contract with winery executive Danielle (Cathy DeBuono). Just like dj vu, Lola has three chances to reach Casey on time, in each sequence, she encounters a variety of people and situations along the way that help and hinder her.

It's hard not to root for Lola as she races against time, all the while sexy Casey and Danielle (real-life couple Jill Bennett and Cathy DeBuono) flirt and reminisce about old times. Will Lola arrive on time to save her relationship with Casey or is she back to square one?

Director/writer's Megan Siler and Ellen Seidler add a playful quality by interspersing Jett Atwood's animated sequences of Lola flying through the streets of San Francisco into the film. And Then Came Lola is a film about the trials and tribulations of relationships and commitment.

Jill Bennett is sexy and entertaining as the frustrated Casey, unsure whether choose between the stunning Danielle or her unreliable girlfriend Lola. Ashleigh Sumner hits the mark as the commitment phobic Lola on the verge of losing the love of her life.

Stars Franka Potente (Bourne Identity) as Lola and Moritz Bleibtreu as her boyfriend Manni who accidently leaves 100,000 Deutchmarks he is delivering for a mobster on a subway train.  The rest of the plot is similar to And Then Came Lola including occasional use of animation and a clever device of multiple possible outcomes.  You decide which is your favorite outcome. Both films also use some appearant first person commentary by the actors during the film to explain their motivation or thought processes.  I think both films are fun, charming and whitty.  I recommend both films.  Run Lola Run is in German and English, And Then Came Lola just English.

Don't bother with this.  Watch the original movie.  Great sound track keeps it moving, although the plot on that one does fine all by itself, too.  It had nothing to do with love.  It had to do with someone's life, hanging in the balance.  And it worked.",1352419200,,506,4.252631578947368

The shot in one of the scenes of Lola in Delores Park on 16th and Delores, one of my favorite places in the world, being an example of that.

Personally while I enjoyed the pulsing soundtrack of the German film Run Lola Run I found this relationship and social circle centric remake more than the crime and violence centric Run Lola Run. I also like the open homage  this film paid to Run Lola Run in ways such as using comic character sequences illustrating the running scenes.

I'd put in the fun light hearted romantic comedy genre of appeal to those in the artistic, LGBT, or 20's 30's dating scene rather than bridge and tunnel set or less urban viewers.",1350518400,2,836,4.450980392156863

On the way there she runs around San Francisco, encounters various obstacles, does some soul searching, and gets to repeat the same journey in three different versions. Because it's about lesbian characters set in North America, sitting in front of a psychotherapist at some point is inevitable. What is absolutely amazing about this film, however, is that a movie about lesbians with San Francisco as the location has not one, single dyke in it -- not even in the background of the lesbian bar where Lesbian B hangs out for most of its 71 minutes. In Trendy Lesbian Planet, the main characters can pass for straight (in comfortable shoes, of course), have fashionably slender figures, and dildos are never too far from reach.

First of all, is it me or does Lola seem a bit old to be hightailing it through the streets of San Francisco? What I saw here was a middle aged woman in twenty something clothing running like the mad hatter in a Richard Simmons video under the premise of saving her ""relationship"" with a girlfriend who may or may not really be her girlfriend.  I must return to the mindless running which I assume was some half assed homage to Parkour which is also known as Free Running or Urban Acrobatics.  In ""Lola's"" case animation (really subpar animation) was thrown in when the going or running got too tough. Even the sex scenes were trite and lacking. I am a fan of lesbian movies - at least those that have a script.  This one unabashedly missed the mark as well as its target audience.",1310515200,4,1072,4.313432835820896

4097378,5,B0039S3872,"""A little bit of L-Word, a little bit of Groundhog Day, and a whole lot of fun"" is the best way I can describe this entertaining little film.

Ashleigh Summer plays Lola, a photographer who has had a notoriously poor record when it comes to relationships.  Most of the time, she's had a problem with prioritizing her lovers high enough in her life to make them feel truly special.  Her relationship with Casey (Jill Bennett) is new, and also very important to her.  So she's making a special effort to be there for Casey.  When Casey calls her and tells her that she needs some photographs delivered asap, and that an important client's business is on the line, Lola races against time to get them to her.  However, one thing after another gets in her way, making a simple trip across town into a harowing affair.

In a twist that only indie film fans can really appreciate, Lola gets to make the trip over and over (a-la Bill Murray's Groundhog Day).  Will she get everything right before she runs out of chances, or will she fail Casey and send her into the arms of her sexually aggressive client Danielle (played by Bennet's real-life partner Cathy DeBuono)?  Watch and see...

While this film lacks the gravitas (The Kids Are All Right) or the romanticism (Imagine Me & You) of other lesbian film, it was a cute and enjoyable romp.  Daring and adventerous in composition, ""And Then Came Lola"" is an indie film fan's delight!  The Heathen Hippy gives it 5 second chances.....",1296518400,2,1478,4.620689655172414
4097379,5,B0039S3872,"This is a creative, fun, and sexy flick. It's loosely inspired by the wonderful German film ""Run, Lola, Run."" I think ""loose"" is the operative word. While Run, Lola, Run, is a rather dark film, this lesbian twist on it is definitely a romp. In the German film Lola must save her boyfriend from a drug-deal gone bad. In this film, Lola must ""save"" her girlfriend from a former flame. As with the German Lola, our lesbo Lola has three chances to get it right. Does she get the girl and save her from the clutches of the evil-ex? Well, I'll never tell. What I can tell you is that the film features a lot of attractive OUT actresses, beautiful San Francisco scenery, great music, clever photo-montages and animation. It also features some very, very hot love scenes. A must see. The DVD extra feature interview with star Ashleigh Sumner is also worth watching. Sounds like it was a fun set.

That's over an hour of my life that I will never get back.
