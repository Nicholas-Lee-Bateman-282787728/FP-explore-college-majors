In today's world of high definition TVs, the grainy video quality is obvious.  On a smaller TV or computer screen, the lower video quality isn't as obvious.  If you rip the DVD to a video iPod, the lower video quality isn't noticeable.  In fact, the lower video output makes ripping the DVD much quicker.

The 50 music videos on this DVD are all good selections from some of the most popular Latin singers / groups, e.g., Mana, Juanes, Christian Castro, Thalia, Marc Anthony.

If you do an Internet search, you can buy this DVD for less than $10.  At that price, it's an outstanding buy regardless of the video quality.  That .20 cents per music video.",1232668800,,830,4.372549019607843
