7979263,5,B000087EYQ,"Out of all the manga I own or have ever seen, this first series still does it for me. The English dub is awful, though, and if that's the only way you've seen any of this series, trust me when I say the original Japanese with English subtitles is like night and day. This series has been as influential in Hollywood in reverse ratio to its lack of popularity among the US public; most if not all of the bad reviews I've seen for this and other installments comment directly on how bad the English dub is and pronounce doom on the entirety for that reason alone. So yeah, if you can't read subtitles or their mere presence ruins your movie experience, then this is not for you.
But if subtitles are not a dealbreaker for you, then the cycles of history idea is worth sitting through the battle-heavy rock-scored mayhem that takes the vast majority of the screen time; a very taught script combines with fast-paced action to deliver a message of hope in mankind's darkest hour.",1368576000,,975,4.48314606741573
