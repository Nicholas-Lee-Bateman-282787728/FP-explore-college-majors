920609,4,6304699093,This is one of those great movies that you have to see a couple of times to get the full effect.  I would have given it 5 stars if Jesse Emery had gotten more screen time.,947030400,3,171,3.75
7876754,4,6304699093,"This movie is a decent enough anthology film with five stories and a wrap around. Its was a really low budget film so the special effects and the acting weren't the greatest.  But the film was interesting and fast paced. The stories are short and too the point. While I liked some better than others, none of them dragged. While not scary they were fun to watch. I almost wished that they made a sequel.

The only issue I had was the sound. On my copy there were bits of dropped dialogue or the conversation was difficult to hear. This problem was evident during the first story, the one about a haunted a pool.

The trailer was included as an extra.",1469577600,,650,4.355371900826446

7876757,3,6304699093,"Production values about on par with four episodes of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE strung together, with really fun synth music (not too OTT or abrasive).

I liked the film a lot, though some of the stories were better than others (the Scout leader one is definetely my favourite). I have it on DVD from the Brentwood set, will this September 2012 disc have extras? If so, I'm a getting it!",1346976000,2,384,4.485714285714286
7876758,3,6304699093,"A group of five passengers are waiting for their bus as they tell each other ghost stories. The first story deals with a swimmer who has been in love with a dead swimmer all the time, second story has a young boy who has been on a camping trip with his friends as he finds himself in what Weird Al Yankovich refers to in his song from the 3D album ""Nature Trail to Hell"". Third story has a woman who meets a late night anchor, only he is a vampire then with the fourth story has a man who has the gift to bring the dead back to life including his dead brother and the final story is about an Aztec curse.

A rather decent attempt to be a Tales From The Crypt and Creepshow style horror anthology, this is one of the better Troma distributed efforts so far. There's the typical low budget acting with some ok make-up and production values, but there is an ok twist in the end.

Close but no cigar.",1318896000,3,896,4.114285714285714
7876759,1,6304699093,This is with out a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen..These people who left all these raving reviews must have been part of the making of this trash. And whats up with these ppl talking about that kid like if he's the greastest actor ever! Thats just f***kin strange cause this is the only movie he ever made and he wasn't even good in this one!,1217030400,,356,4.173913043478261
7876760,5,6304699093,"search ""Toxie's Triple Terror vol. 2"" on amazon DVDs...it's a series of 3 disc sets, each featuring 3 Troma releases. Chillers is on volume 2. Each boxed set is crazy inexpensive...got mine at Best Buy for 9.99",1108425600,6,210,4.702702702702703

7876762,5,6304699093,"I thought Jesse Emery exuded a raw sexual power that is incredibly unusual for an 11 year old. I have had to purchase 5 copies of this movie because the tape wears out at about the 800th viewing. If anyone has any info on this movie being released on DVD, let me know. I need a good screen shot for my artist to complete my Jesse Emery portrait tattoo.",1090022400,2,352,4.115942028985507
7876763,3,6304699093,"Chillers was Danny Boyd's first crack, and probably his most well-known.  It is a series of horror vignettes told by a group of stranded travellers in an Appalachian bus station.  This movie doesn't have the tongue-in-cheek quality of Space Preachers, nor is it of the same quality as his poignant Paradise Park.  Performances are good, but not up to the cast's potential (as I said with Space Preachers, they are so much better on stage).  Some vignettes (like the Indian Burial Mound) are extremely well done, while others (the pool) are - on the whole - tedious.  However, this film becomes more entertaining with each viewing, so I will recommend it.",999129600,,654,4.8558558558558556
