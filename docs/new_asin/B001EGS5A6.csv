8298021,5,B001EGS5A6,"I still remember seeing this performance in my youth where I was knocked out by Dudley's impish wit and stylish jazz piano playing, together with the other trio members.  Don't worry about it being in B & W just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1240185600,3,240,4.333333333333333
8298022,5,B001EGS5A6,"Some men have so many talents that it is does not look fair to ""normal"" people.
In the world of music, someone like singer, composer, writer, drummer, pianoplayer, arranger, actor, filmstar, etc. Mel Torm comes to mind, who wrote ""Christmas Song"" while he was still a schoolboy, wrote several great books, among these a fine biography about another ""wonderboy"" Mr. Drums, Traps or as we know him: Buddy Rich.
But Mel could handle the drumsticks himself very well too!

Another man with so many talents was most certainly Dudley Moore, comedian, actor, filmstar, married 4 times to the most beautiful women (and that requirs some talents too)and both a classical and jazz pianist.
During this his very first visit to Australia in 1971 he combines several of his talents, and people like Victor Borge - who combined his pianotalents with humor in the classical field, come to mind.
Dudley combines his humor with both classical and jazz music, and even sings a soprano if needed.
For those who only knew him as a comedian, or a rather famous moviestar, this dvd + cd must come as a surprise.
Indeed it is a small wonder that these tapes even survived, and the black and white dvd is very good, both in picture and soundquality.
For jazz lovers there is much to enjoy: great swing in ""The Moore I see you"", ""The Look of Love"" and ""Yesterdays"", while Dudley does a splendid tribute to one of his favorite pianoplayers: Erroll Garner in ""Moon River"".
Good idea of the record company to do two records: a DvD with all the comedy and the complete show, while the included cd has only the music, of course with loads of humor.
The record company was raised by Dudley to research the rare PSP, Progressive Supernuclear Palsy. who took Dudley away from us in 2002, only 66 years old.
So buying this dvd + cd serves a good purpose too.
Although there are already several other great cd's out in this series, and I most certainly recommend ""Jazz Jubilee"" and ""Jazz, Blues & Moore"", [...]

There was a great Gershwin show released in the past on VHS, and during this show Dudley had great bassist Ray Brown at his side.
But this Australian show will open a lot of eyes.
I can not think of a better introduction to jazz at the moment.
So jazzlovers, here is your oportunity to introduce your favorite music to everybody you love and care.

8298023,5,B001EGS5A6,"It is amazing that this recording has survived at all. Think how many great programs from the same era in the UK were wiped. For it to be released now is an added bonus. This features the Dudley Moore Trio recorded for ABC TV in Australia in 1971. They play a mixture of Jazz standards, Dudleys own compositions and some of Dudleys finest musical comedy routines. The full list is:

La Nuit s'Epanouit
The More I See You
Chimes
Love Song for an Imaginary Musical
The Look of Love
Madrigal
Moon River
The Swan
Bedazzled
Song For Suzy
Die Flabbergast
Yesterdays
Fanfare
Strictly for the Birds
Goodbyee

The DVD runs to 61mins, is in black and white, but for its age, the sound and picture quality are very good. Dudley is in superb comedic form inbetween the numbers and the Trio perform brilliantly throughout. On first viewing my favourite comedy performance is Dudley's performance of Saint-Saen's 'The Swan'. I'd never seen Dudley perform this before. Of the serious (ish) numbers I've always love 'Strictly for the Birds' and Dudley's tribute to Errol Garner on 'Moon River' is a marvellous performance.

There are no extras with the DVD. However a surprise bonus when I received my copy is that there is an audio CD of the musical numbers (without Dudley's comedy inbetween) which runs to 45 mins.

This is a rare treat both from a musical point of view and a comedy point of view, and if you didn't know already, it will make you realise just how hugely talented Dudley Moore was.",1223251200,9,1485,4.656488549618321
