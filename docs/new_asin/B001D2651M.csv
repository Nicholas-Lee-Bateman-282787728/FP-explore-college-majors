It's really just a matter of perspective; you can either sit down and view this as a bishie drama that does such a terrible job at telling its story that you're desperate for a reason to hit stop or you see it as a bishie drama that is filled with so many plot holes that you can't help but laugh and be entertained. This is not a great example of a bishie drama but for the right audience, it could be entertaining. The rest of us will be busy finding something else.",1227484800,2,595,3.8852459016393444
