6754830,4,B00OKB80KW,"This is a pretty basic formula plot which some people might consider to be spoilers.

1) Teens play with Ouija board.

2) Demon is contacted.

3) Demon kills Teens

4) Teens fight back without Roddy McDowell

I enjoyed the first killing with the lights still being on. Where can I get Christmas lights that strong?

I enjoyed the second killing when our teen does a Charpy V-notch test on the bathroom sink. The ""doink"" sound had me laughing.

I particularly liked the first three outlined aspects. The last one, ""teens fight back"" could have been better written. The film has all your typical scare/jump tactics as the ghost demon suddenly appears and moves things around.

Worth a rental. Could be fun with the right crowd in a movie theater.

Parental Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Not much in blood or gore.

Ouija tips: preferably knees should be touching, with board on laps.
A black mirror is needed as a portal for the spirits, unless you got one still in the house, then that is all you get.
And if the pointer moves and you aren't moving it, it is the other guys who claims they aren't moving it.
All dead hate all living, especially loved ones. Play it with someone you don't like and contact their loved ones.
For best results do it on acid in a graveyard at night. (I'm kidding. Just say ""No."" and stay in school.)",1415404800,,1333,4.516666666666667
6754831,3,B00OKB80KW,"Hi Friends. Be it video games or boardgames, Movies based on games are inherently unsuccessful (excluding Resident Evil). Time will tell whether this extends to films based on 19th century spirit board patents as well. Although 1986's Witchboard did well enough to warrant  2 sequels. ""Ouija"" sadly lacks Tawny Kitaen or the T&A of the genre of that decade (although a bath too is careful filled up as an homage or possibly a red herring.) That being said, 2014's Ouija is not that bad especially relative to this October's offerings but it may put you off flossing and pool maintenance for a bit. It's predictable and has quite a few cheesy jump scares, faux endings and tension hooks. The acting is at times old-school genre bad, ok our lead was adequate enough. I almost didn't recognize Bates Motel's Olivia Cooke without her oxygen tubes and surrounded by her cannon-fodder friends who want her to just ""move her mourning over her friend's mysterious suicide along already, I mean it's been like 3 days."" Time for a seance already people! Let's go! Screenwriter /Production coordinator Stiles White has his directorial debut here with a Hollywood take on a Filipino film of the same name. Finally, it's not the straight possession film I was worried it could have been... More of a ""young people unwittingly unleashing evil upon themselves forcing them to go to various old people for help"" sort of film. Bye Friends.",1415404800,5,1422,4.9004149377593365
6754832,2,B00OKB80KW,"With the write-up on this one being teenage girls mess with board and get terrorized I was expecting some fun. But the girls clunk around their houses with several layers of clothing as if it's constantly mid-Winter and they have no heating, and one girl takes a bath in her underwear and socks. The dudes talk about surfing but the girls ain't interested, and that swimming pool never looks like shedding its cover. Mummies and the undead appear but without a ripple of tension, and the whole film looks as if it's made for the lowest possible budget with actresses who seem ashamed of their bodies(barefoot for 2 secs in one scene is all you get in this film). There is some depth to the storyline, but film makers don't seem to realise that females go to the theater to be frightened and to identify with the sexy actresses, and males go for female flesh and excitement. Until they do realise that the films will not make so much money. 2013 was an excellent year for sexy horror with the likes of Carrie, Last Exorcism 2, No One Lives, Maniac, Excision and Dracula(o.k. a couple of these films were made in 2012 but they weren't on the main dvd markets until 2013), but 2014 looks as if its going to fire a blank.

6754833,4,B00OKB80KW,"After watching this film, I've learned never to judge a horror film by its rating. For a PG-13 movie, this film gave me some serious chills. Easily one of the scariest films since The Conjuring. (Some friends and I played with an ouija board before, so some scenes kinda hit close to home)

When Debbie supposedly commits suicide, Laine and her group of friends play with an ouija board as a way to communicate with Debbie and say goodbye, but what they get is a supernatural force too powerful to imagine. Laine must solve the mystery and rid themselves of the ghost before it's too late. I highly recommend OUIJA!!!",1415059200,,617,4.609090909090909
6754834,4,B00OKB80KW,"Overview: Remembering using a Ouija board years ago when she was very young,  A woman discovers a dusty Ouija board
in the attic. She makes the mistake of playing it again only to discover that what is labled as only a toy, unleashes something
more than she and her friends ever bargained for.

Spook Meter:  3/5  A solid 3/5 stars on my spook meter... this film uses a fair amount of loud bang, jump scares to try and scare the audience which personally I don't find scary but more of a natural reaction that the viewer might jump a bit merely from the sudden
BOOM when something happens.  This to me is not what is scary about this film however... what I did find scary is the fact that you either believe that the Ouija Board is more then just a game or you don't. Having delt with spiritual demonic forces in my life over the years in areas that I won't go deep into... I'm fully aware that this is more then just a game.  With that said.... what I found scary is that demons can haunt a persons home and yes the connection can and will become stronger over time the more a person plays with the Ouija Board.  Keeping this in mind as I watched the film, seeing things happen such as the stove burner turning on made me spooked since it's all to real in many ways.  So although parts of the film was not as scary, the overall concept and some of the parts are very scary.

Violence/Gore Meter:  2/5  Not much in the way of gore.... as for overall violence, this film is fairly tame.  A possessed woman hangs herself but there is no blood and not overly graphic and more of a distance shot.  A man is drowned in a pool, a woman is levitated off the floor and her head slammed onto the bathroom sink to give the viewer an idea. Some violence but little blood overall and nothing overly graphic or extended torture scenes to be found in this film.

Profanity Meter: 2/5  The word Oh My G*D is used twice...  Sh*t is used a few times along with a use of the word H*ll and D*m
Overall this film is fairly mild for overall swearing which I always find to be a good thing.

Sexual Meter:  1/5  The girls kiss their boyfriends a few times and they wear some somewhat revealing tops that show a little
cleavage.  There are no sex scenes of any kind,  half naked or anything graphic as far as sexual content.

Overall Final Thoughts:  4/5  Overall I really enjoyed this film.  A few areas I thought the acting was excellent and other parts
left me thinking it felt a little weak. The story was great and the overall flow of the film worked very well.  As I walked out of the theater I noticed some people looked downright horrified by what they seen.  My guess is maybe some of those people may have been having issues in their own life from playing the board themselves.  Overall a well done, spooky, enjoyable true to life to some degree film.

Extended Thoughts:  The story really hit home with me and delivered what the film intended to do which really was I feel to make people think twice about playing around with a Ouija Board.  I have never played a Ouija Board nor do I ever intend to.  I do know a lot about spiritual warfare and about what it's like having to get these things out of your house. Take it for what you will but be warned, when you use a Ouija Board, you're not contacting friendly spirits but demons that pretend to be someone they are not.  They can and will become a presence inside your home and there is no controlling them since a person who uses the  board is essentially opening themselves up to spiritual demonic powers to come into their lives.  These spirits will seem harmless at first but they will begin to take hold of the person and the person will begin to notice a presence enter and stay in their home.  There is NO saying ""good bye"" once that demonic force is welcomed in, they will stay.  The only way to overcome this evil is by calling upon the name of Jesus Christ, calling and trusting fully in Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit will remove the evil.  Take it as a warning though.... it's not a game
and the spirit world is very real and not something to take lightly.",1414886400,,4117,4.284974093264249
6754835,5,B00OKB80KW,"""Ouija"" is what you would expect from a modern horror film these days, but is able to present watchable content while not dwelling to far out of the ordinary. You'll probably already know the story about the ancient spirit board that can have supernatural abilities linked to the dead, but Ouija manages to make them interesting and fun to watch. Not only that, but it seems as though the producers and directors knew exactly how to coordinate the plot in order to make the film robust. Unlike other horror films these days that go so far out to stand out, Ouija a uses a simple premise that just works. The acting is good, the story is good, and the scares might sometimes lift a hair up from the back of your neck.",1414800000,3,716,4.431818181818182
6754836,1,B00OKB80KW,"What is it about toys and board games that make such great antagonists in horror films? Is it that these inanimate objects are designed for fun and enjoyment, but really have deep connections to the foulest of evils? Whatever the reasons are, Hasbro hasn't found them in Ouija, a painfully dull attempt to turn their supposedly-supernatural party game into a low budget scarer. On the surface it seems like a sound idea; a lot of people have had some frighteningly good fun with Ouija boards over the years, and they're probably better off inviting friends over to play it than sitting through a film this tired and rote.

By comparison, Ouija makes Hasbro's last attempt to adapt a board game look like pure genius. That would be last year's noisy and stupid Battleship, which you could never snooze through no matter how sleepy Brooklyn Decker's line delivery got. Drifting off into slumberland is pretty easy during Ouija, though, which conjures up zero scares and never deviates from a bland playbook. The film begins with best friends Debbie and Laine happily playing with their Ouija board as kids, only to be interrupted in their fun by the arrival of one's sister. But it was enough for the girls to make a connection with something terrible, and years later as the girls are grown up, its presence has only gotten stronger. They may think it's ""only a game"", but clearly something disagrees.

When teenaged Debbie (Shelley Hennig) dies under mysterious circumstances, and is revealed to have been something of a Ouija addict, her best friend Laine (Olivia Cooke) gathers a few friends to communicate with Debbie...through the board, of course. Along with her ill-tempered sister Sarah (Ana Coto), Debbie's boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith), Laine's boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff) and close friend Isabel (Bianca Santos), they reach out to Debbie but end up contacting something far worse. Predictably, people start dying and it's up to them to figure out why.

There's a pretty good chance for Ouija to offer up some Final Destination-style dark comedy, the path a film like this absolutely should have taken, but instead what we get is a deadly serious and frightfully dull bore. You won't be surprised by anything screenwriting and directing duo Stiles White and Juliet Snowden come up with as they basically rip off every horror you saw a decade ago. Spooky dead kids, a scorned mother, and deep family secrets literally buried in the attic are what's in store. Nothing to see here, folks. Although the film is shot well enough it never stops looking like something that should be airing on the CW, not on the big screen. There's never a sense of terror; never a sense that anybody is in real danger, and nothing the filmmakers tries to do changes that. Part of the problem is the wooden performances by much of the cast, with only Cooke capable of holding our attention for more than a few minutes. She's genuinely great on the hit Psycho spinoff, Bates Motel, and maybe her familiarity with the genre is why she stands out from her co-stars.

Most importantly, it's hard to figure out what Hasbro gets out of a movie like this. Unlike Transformers,  GI Joe, or Battleship which were clearly designed to sell toys, who's going to run to their local Wal-Mart and pick up a Ouija board? Certainly they won't based on this utterly forgettable movie.",1414454400,14,3359,4.865384615384615
6754837,3,B00OKB80KW,"The Movie Review by Andy McKinney

Ouija

 Scary movies should scare us, and Ouija does.  It also reminds us that teenagers are not fully formed humans and need to be watched over.  Their brains almost force them to make errors in judgment.  And we can think of the film as a cautionary tale for those who might take a chance with the Hasbro game of the same name.  No body has ever made a movie about a Ouija board user who was instructed to go to the Library at 12 noon and find his life mate.  The stories are always about getting mixed up with hostile spirits.
 But first time director team Juliet Snowden and Stiles White do a good job of building the suspense for us.  Lots of creepy stuff happens as a build up to the infrequent scares, what I call the Boogey Man jumps.  When something suddenly pops into the shot scaring the actors and the audience, that is a Boogey Man jump.  The two directors are better known for their collaboration as writers.  They co-wrote Knowing, The Possession and Boogeyman.  Snowden also wrote Ouija.
 In the story a high school girl plays with a Ouija board alone, a violation of safe Ouija board practices.  She unknowingly does so in a house with a grim past.  When she ends up dead her teenage friends want to find out what happened to her.  The bright, happy girl was not, in their estimation, a candidate for suicide.  The find out, to the permanent detriment of several of their number.
 The casting director mined the world of TV for the actors in Ouija.  The star, or at least main protagonist, is played by Olivia Cooke.  Her supporting cast includes Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Bianca A. Santos and Shelley Hennig.  All of them except Coto have plenty of experience on the small screen.  Hennig particularly turns in a fine performance.  She is 27 and her extra experience shows in her brief moments on screen.
 Genre films like this must be predictable or they would not be genre films.  We have all the traditional elements in Ouija that we would expect.  Within the limits of the horror film trope, we call Ouija a success with an average three saw blade rating.  The PG-13 film has no bad language or naked people but it is scary and deals with evil spirits and will scare little kids.  It runs for one hour and 29 minutes so you can get in and get out quickly.  The tight tightfisted producers allowed only a tiny $5 million for a budget but it opened at number one  and they should do very well.
 Juliet Snowden herself is among the producers as is the enormous talent, Michael Bay.  Platinum Dunes, Bay's company, had the lead on production.  Platinum Dunes has made two successful Purge films and re-makes of such films as Texas Chainsaw Massacre,  Friday the 13th and The Hitcher.
 Fun fact-the word ouija is a compound word made up of the French and the German words for yes, oui and ja.
 Use the Ouija board with care or better yet stick to Chutes and Ladders.  Evil spirits never attacked people playing Chutes and Ladders.",1414281600,2,2982,4.492537313432836
6754838,2,B00OKB80KW,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Ouija"" (USA, 2014)

1. This is just another lazy, uninspired jump flick. In fact, I finished seeing it 30 minutes ago, but I have to hurry up and write these Nine Things because I'm already starting to forget it.

2. It's painfully obvious how this movie was made: The producers got together and said, ""We need to get some Halloween dollars from the kids. Let's make a movie about that toy, the Ouija board. It hasn't been the subject of a major Hollywood movie since`Witchboard' back in `86, so kids today will think it's fresh. Who has the rights to the Ouija board now? Hasbro? The `Transformers' people? Ok, somebody call them.""

3. So that's what we have: a generically random script with generically attractive actors who wander around getting scared (and sometimes killed). When the ""plot"" needs to move along, a prop or character will suddenly appear and provide enough information for everyone to move to the next period of wandering around and getting scared.

4. If you really need to know the plot, it's about a girl that kills herself after playing with the Ouija board. Her best friends think it's a good idea to find out what happened - by using the same Ouija board.

5. This is the first horror movie I've seen where the evil spirit tries to be scary by writing ""Hi friend"" everywhere.

6.  I know characters in horror movies are supposed to make stupid decisions. That's part of the genre. But the characters in this movie make so many stupid decisions that I started laughing in the theater.

7. News flash, Hollywood: making people jump doesn't mean you made a horror movie. I can suddenly scream `Boo!' in front of a friend to make him jump. That doesn't mean I just made a horror movie. Even if I charge him for it.

8. What's funny is that a small scene actually explains how the Ouija board works - the ideomotor effect. The movie debunks itself, and then goes on to pretend it's real anyway.

9. There are a few individually interesting scenes that prevent it from being the worst movie of the year, but it's definitely not good. If you're desperate to throw your money at a horror movie, then I'm not going to stop you. Otherwise, go buy your own Ouija board from the toy store, get stoned, and scare yourself instead.",1414281600,72,2273,4.5763546798029555

__________________________________________________

One of the oldest parlor games going back to the 19th century has captivated skeptics on whether or not spirits could be conjured up with a Ouija board. And now Hasbro and  Universal brings us a full length feature film about the dangers of contacting the other side and why sometimes its best to the leave the dead alone. As the classic board game reincarnations continues, director Styles White and screenwriter Juliet Snowden presents a story that hits the fears of many people who are swayed away by the dangers of using the Ouija board and telling a haunting tale just in time for Halloween. Mostly intended to spook younger audiences, Ouija will resonate with those whos belief in the power of the board and how its perceived in Western cultures.

After her best friend Debbie is found dead, Laine and her friends grieve for her loss as they revisit her home from time to time. It isn't until Laine discovers the truth that Debbies fixation on the Ouija board leads to more questions than answers about her death. When Laine and her friends gather to try and contact Debbie through the use of the Ouija board they presumably speak with whom it looks to be their best friend. But when everyone begins to notice signs that they are being followed by an unknown presence and Laines friends begin to fall one by one, she races to figure out who they're really dealing with as it may be too late to close the portal that they initially opened in the first place.

Watching the trailer it reminded me of 1987s Witchboard and how Kevin Tenney brought about the first feature length movie about the Ouija board. Except this time it looked like Hollywood was going for more scares than substance to scare audiences for Halloween. After watching the film, my gut instincts that were telling me it would be another cliched film with jump scares after jump scares would come to be true. For the first 45 minutes, Laine (Olivia Cooke) and her friends are reeling from Debbies death. The movie takes its time in trying to build around this mysterious death that she committed suicide and with a creek here and a creek there your lauded into a straight to DVD/TV story.

As the film went on I couldn't help but reference back to Tenneys Witchboard where the rules of using the board were abundantly clear and also presented dangers should anyone try using it alone. In Ouija your given half of the equation and what happens is your dumbfounded by how ridiculous the actions of the characters take when they try using the board to contact Debbie. Immediately your to assume that if you make a connection with a spirit its presumably the person your trying to contact. It isn't until Douglas Smiths character of Pete realizes that the spirit theyve been speaking to the whole time turns out to be someone other then Debbie. But its to no ones surprise when weird things begin happening to them. This is a lazy way of getting peoples attention thats already common sense by the time the revelation hits you.

It has to be mentioned again how the jump scares were rampant throughout the movie. Even one of the death scenes was so silly that your left to laugh rather then be in fear of what happened. The scene involves Bianca A. Santoss character of Isabelle as she is in the bathroom where her death takes place. Not to give too much away but it seemed like they weren't sure how they wanted Isabelle do die and the decision they went with was more laughable. None of the characters encounters is built up to so that when they come into contact with a spirit your left shrugging off their existence.

Something interesting happens during the movie as a twist is thrown in there that is clever but has been used before in the past. When the twist is revealed your immediately reminded of The Ring and how the characters assumed whom they were trying to save is innocent but come to find out they hold dark secrets. Id appreciate it more if they had added more depth to the characters and not put it in so late in the game. Its funny because Lin Shaye makes an appearance in Ouija and she plays a character reminiscent to that in James Wans Insidious franchise. When I saw her I smirked because its as though shes type-casted for these roles. Nonetheless it was great to see her in the movie as small as her role was.

This was a quick way to make a buck and Universal cashed in as many people will go out to see Ouija for the mere fear they have about the stories theyve heard about the Ouija board. Hasbro has been on a role lately by turning their properties into cash cows even though they haven't been as successful as they couldve been. Same can be said here as nothing in Styles Whites Ouija is inventive or can conjure up the screams effective enough to leave audiences spooked. If your looking to jump and just want to break away from reality for a bit then the movie might work for some, but for others it will make you just turn to Tenneys Witchboard for a more creative and terrifying take in contacting the dead.",1414108800,5,5122,4.577971646673936

But what didn't make sense, was they both used the board as young kids, but then when the other girl finds a video of her first time playing it, she was playing alone and a teenager when she found it in her house and had no idea what the game even was before her teen years, making it seem like hee friend didn't play at all until Debbie's death. And at the beginning Debbie was saying they played it a long time ago.  Debbie is not very smart from what it seems like when she messes with it, while her friend never wanted to. But nothing seemed scary. The main thing is that it's a horror movie with nothing scary in it. A 5 year old could watch this whole movie and say it's not scary.

Its is a PG-13 horror film so don't expect any major blood/gore or anything too over the top scary but whats there works. One of things I did like was the atmosphere in certain scenes, especially in the dark house. Basic plot is a girl uses the Ouija board, dies & her friends use one to try & contact her to see what might've really happened. The cast did a mostly good job & look for a special appearance by Lin Shaye (Elise from the Insidious films) who is good here also, even though her role is short. As with most horror films its best not to try & overthink things for maximum enjoyment. There is a sequel plannedfor release this year (2016) & after giving this one a chance im looking forward to what the sequel might be have to offer. The film also follows the old ""less is more"" approach when it comes to the ghosts & stuff. Go in not expecting a masterpiece but a fun way to pass some time & you may not be disappointed.

It is as if 'Scream', the movie, became more ridiculous which itself is already ridiculous but make it more ridiculous and you have this movie. The end of the film would make you think that a sequel will be soon, but I hope not because the film is poorly done and poorly written. Towards the end there is a slight unpredictable part but it ends the way I thought it would. It is like other films that tries to be scary by showing you images related to something that scares the actos and showing you fear in the faces of the actors to get you excited to think this is scary but is not. It is also like the movie, 'The Blair Witch Project,' which is not truly scary  but  ads  would have you think it is scary and maybe intrigued so you would think  you decided well to  spend your money but, of course,  you didn't .

6754976,3,B00OKB80KW,"""Ouija"" has a pretty cool and creepy story to work with, an old spirit board discovered in the attack, suicides and haunting, a creepy legend that connects the board to the house of the suicide girl, it is all perfect horror subject matter. Unfortunately there is something missing from ""Ouija"" that makes it more spectacle than horror. The scenes build nicely through suspense, shadowy, eerie atmosphere, and great sound effects, but the end result falls flat. The big scares aren't really scary.

The cast give well enough performances of these haunted characters. The direction and cinematography are equally stellar. You can tell money was well spend in production, ""Ouija"" has all the right components to be a real good horror film, unfortunately it all stays pretty PG. The horror seems almost pulled back into safer zones when they should have took that thrilling momentum and gone for some major scares. Not sure why they chose to keep things subdued. I mean really for what ""Ouija"" is it is a nice, creepy Halloween horror film based on an occult staple-the spirit board. And there are a few scare-ish moments that use the sudden shock gimmick to get a jump out of the movie-goer but still this film is far less exciting than say ""Insidious"" or ""The Conjuring"".",1445472000,,1270,4.87962962962963

6754984,2,B00OKB80KW,"The movie was just okay. It was somewhat predictable, didn't allow time to build suspense, and didn't have much character development. I wasn't invested in anything about it and the plot was clumsy and feels like it's been told a hundred times before. The acting was okay, but these actors didn't have much to work with in the way of the script. The main thing that made me lose interest in the movie was how arbitrary it was that the main character felt so compelled to NEED to use the ouija board and use it inside the house of her dead friend. There was no explanation for why she wanted to do this, other than they had played with it (once? Maybe more?) as kids. What would have made the movie more entertaining would have been if they provided more creepy incidents and hints leading her to feel the need to use the ouija board. I can usually enjoy any amount of cheesiness, don't mind graphic horror, like fast paced as well as slow movies, but this one didn't have a feel, it just felt like nothing that happened had any motivation, rhyme or reason, but managed to be predictable.",1444262400,,1087,4.44

6754989,2,B00OKB80KW,"Like Battleship made in 2012, a supernatural horror Ouija is based on a Hasbro board game. I am not really sure if a supernatural horror movie is the best kind of marketing for this product, but anyway Michael Bay and other producers thought it worth a try to make one. Well, the result is just another horror film that is not very scary.

From the beginning the films story is far from compelling. In Ouija, in order to know what really happened to her best friend Debbie (Shelley Hennig), who died in a strange way, Laine (Olivia Cooke) uses an Ouija board with Sarah (Ana Coto), Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), Pete (Douglas Smith) and Isabelle (Bianca Santos).

OK, so what happens to these cardboard characters? Nothing surprising or interesting. One interesting thing is that nowhere in the film is any attempt at making the story more involving, or characters more attractive. Some films may rely on clich and tired formulas, but they try to interest us in some way or other. In Ouija this does not happen.

Despite its fine photography and decent production designs, Ouija offers little that you have not already seen.",1443830400,,1119,4.787564766839378

I saw potential in the movie being good but it was an unfortunate let down. I was in shock at how much I was disappointed with this movie. The movie suffers from boring/bland characters. The only character that has SOME development is the main character Laine Morris, but even she's kind of boring. Another flaw this movie has is that the movie is very predictable. My biggest complaint with this movie overall is the fact that the movie WASN'T scary. Anytime a scene shows up that tries to be scary, it's overshadowed by irritating jump scares.

6755081,3,B00OKB80KW,"Could be worse, but could've been a lot better.  To be fair, most horror movies would be lucky to get three stars from me, but I was hoping I could give this one higher marks than I did.  The plot/concept had so much potential, which is why I was excited to watch it.  The storyline idea was great, the acting was pretty good, but overall, it's the writing that ultimately bored me throughout most of the film.  Most flicks of this nature have enough humor thrown in to keep things interesting, even during the horror down-time.  Not so much here.  Serious tone all the way through.  Any jokes attempted fell flat, and I don't think it was so much the delivery as it was the writing.  As for scary stuffs, there were some jump-worthy moments and decent suspense sprinkled throughout, but that alone isn't enough to make this movie a good one.  I really wish I could give this more than three stars... As I said, the storyline idea is a great one; I just wish it could have been better executed.  I do appreciate the fact that this movie was made for audiences of a broad-spectrum demographic, as there is little bad language and no overt sexual tones.  Parents can feel comfortable with their kids watching this and may even enjoy sharing the film as a family.  Another positive note is that there is a very touching moment toward the end, amidst the horror climax.  That made it worth the watch for me.  It's worth renting, but I wouldn't buy it.  'Oiija' isn't terrible; it just isn't that good.",1433635200,,1497,4.492592592592593

6755083,3,B00OKB80KW,"This one earns my sympathy vote more than anything. You can tell that everyone involved tried *really* hard to make a scary movie. The teenage actors did their best to look terrified, the special effects team did their best to create scary monster/ghosts, etc. Unfortunately it just didn't quite make it.

It's kind of surprising that this was so tame, considering the producers' previous experience (PA, Insidious, Texas Chainsaw Massacre). Maybe they have *too* much experience (?) because everything in this movie felt incredibly recycled. Every visual effect has been done before, and it was pretty obvious where they borrowed/stole from. The plot was also extremely predictable. Maybe I've just seen too many horror movies (lol!), but this one was about as ho-hum as they get.

If you're new to horror movies, Ouija might give you a few jumps and thrills. If you're like me and have seen most of the ""scary"" movies out there, then this one is worth a rental *if* you don't have high expectations. The acting and visual effects are well done, but overall it's boring and predictable. It's a good ""there's nothing to watch on TV tonight and I don't feel like doing anything else"" kind of movie.",1433376000,,1197,4.891625615763547
6755084,2,B00OKB80KW,"If possible, I would give this 2.5 stars. No, it's by no means a cinematic masterpiece, but it served its purpose--a creepy film to set the mood during an uneventful, stormy night in with the family (a family primarily composed of tweens that will get creeped out watching an episode of Goosebumps alone, but I guess that's beside the point.) I feel like if you've seen Insidious, The Conjuring, Annabelle, and many of the other horror films to come out from this production team over the past couple of years, you will be familiar with the style of this film (they contain very similar effects, music, etc).

The film starts out solid (albeit a bit predictable). After making communication with a malevolent spirit via ouija board, teenager Debbie (Shelley Hennig, Teen Wolf) commits suicide by hanging herself from the chandelier in her home. Naturally, her best friend Laine (Olivia Cooke, Bates Motel) has questions surrounding her friend's demise and feels as if she needs to gain closure. In true horror movie fashion, all parental figures suddenly find a more pressing matter than the violent death of their child's good friend to draw them away from home, and they leave the teens alone to grieve. Cue bad decision making. Left with the mundane tasks of watering plants, checking locks, and the like while Debbie's parents are out of town, Laine discovers the ouija board while perusing her deceased friend's bedroom. Rather than remembering the worried conversation she had with Debbie the night that she died regarding ""the game"" they used to play when they were kids, Laine recalls only her fond memories of their time with the ouija and decides to use it to make contact with Debbie. She gathers a group of close friends, ranging in attitudes from ""They sell these in toy stores"" to ""I'm not touching that damn thing"",and they try to communicate with their late friend in the empty home in which she took her life. A few lights go out, a pointed ""Goodbye"" message is left, and Laine is satisfied now that she got to talk to Debbie one last time. Of course, that wouldn't make for a very scary movie ending.  All of those who took part in the seance later receive an eerie message, which leads them to conclude that Debbie is still trying to get through to them and that they need to ""play the game"" again. Things quickly escalate during the second round, leading to the discovery of the grisly history of the home's previous occupants, serial deaths among the group of friends, a visit to a relative of the former owners in an insane asylum, and a mad dash for advice from the token Sage-Grandmother-Who-Conveniently-Knows-All-There-Is-To-Know-About-The-Otherside when sh*t gets too real.

While Ouija started out about as believable as a teen flick about a spirit board can be, the final half of this movie was downright hokey. Clues were too easily stumbled upon and conclusions reached. I found the back story involving ""Mother"" and Doris to be very contrived and, quite honestly, downright lame. It's kind of like those haunting documentaries on TV. You can believe a few bumps in the night and moving objects--maybe even the occasional sighting. But when things escalate too far (i.e, being tormented in a dark basement by a poorly designed child corpse), you start to feel ashamed of yourself for even giving it the time of day, despite knowing it's fiction.

If you are bored,  in the mood for a few cheap jumpscares, have an hour and a half to kill, and can view this for very little money to absolutely free, why not?",1433376000,,3538,4.8125

6755099,4,B00OKB80KW,"*The Crowgrrl finally got around to watching the movie Ouija. Despite the fact that it was a formulaic, almost totally predictable teen horror flick, (I had no expectations of anything else, although we can always hope for something a little off the beaten path) I still enjoyed it! The Horror genre has long been bread & butter for Universal Pictures, and they have their formula down pat.

The flicks tagline is Keep telling yourself its just a game and the official synopsis is, A group of friends must confront their most terrifying fears when they awaken the dark powers of an ancient spirit board.

The movie starts with young friends Laine and Debbie playing with a Ouija Board. Segue to their teen years, and Debbie (Shelly Hennig) is playing with the board by herself. Something disturbs her, and she throws the board into the fire. Mysterious things happen like the fire on her stove coming on by itself, and doors opening by themselves. She goes upstairs and finds the board she threw in her fire there on her bed, intact. She then goes into a possessed/trancelike state and hangs herself with a string of lights.

Laine (Olivia Cooke) is devastated, and wants to contact Debbie with the Ouija board. She gets her sister Sarah (Ana Coto) and their friends Trevor (Darren Kagasoff), Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos), and Pete (Douglas Smith) together for an impromptu sance. A spirit answers them via the planchette claiming to be Debbie, and has the signature phrase, Hi, Friend.

Isabella saw Hi Friend on the window of her car, and Pete had the same phrase burned onto his desk. Thinking Debbies still trying to contact them, the group goes right back to the board. Pete asks a trick question, and finds that the spirit communicating with them pretending to be Debbie is not her at all.

Laine finds a USB with a video of Debbie holding the antique Ouija board she found in her attic, and tries to find out what disturbed her when Debbie was playing with the board. She found that Debbie indeed woke something up from the Other Side, something that is not exactly benign. Next thing you know, Isabelle goes into the same possession-like trance, and also ends up dead.

Laine ventures up into Debbies attic to find what else might be there that would lend a clue as to who or what the spirit plaguing them is. She finds photographs of a family who lived in the house circa the 1950s. She and Trevor find old newspaper articles of a Zander family who lived there, and one of their daughters, Doris (Sierra Heuermann), went missing.

Laine finds Doris sister Paulina (Lin Shaye), now in a nursing home, who revealed that their mother (Claudia Katz) was a medium, and she used Doris as a vessel for the dead to speak through.  It became too much hearing all the voices of the spirits, and one day their mother went insane. She sewed Doris mouth shut, killed the girl, and the sister killed the mother. The sister then told Laine to find the secret room in the basement where Doris body is, and unstitch her mouth  but not to go alone. There are very dangerous entities  including the medium mother  that will try to stop that from happening.

Albeit formulaic as Ive already mentioned, Ouija still had a few scares up its sleeve and delivered plenty of chills. Not a bad way to spend a couple of  hours with a bowl of popcorn!",1432512000,,3330,4.633276740237691

There's nothing new so the story runs along the usual tried-and-true-but-by-now-boring formula.  There are some good bits of acting, however, and a few scary moments in a house which apparently has no electric light and everyone has to use a flashlight to see by, even in the daytime.  I simply wonder how families can go away and leave their children, even teenagers alone for so long without even bothering to call and check on them, especially after the tragedy which begins the film.  Why would someone ask a teenager to ""look after"" her house while she was away...not that someone not an adult couldn't do it, but generally, someone older is asked.  Oh, well..that wouldn't fit the outline.

This one is OK for killing a few hours when you've nothing else to do on a Friday night.  From the ending, Ouija 2 will probably be on its way soonh. Then you can while away another hour and a half on it.",1430352000,,1028,4.524324324324325

Truth is if we tell people now how we care about them there is no need to wonder those kinds of 'what ifs'. Anyway the detailed old photographs were a good touch. And the crazy old lady in the mental home was a nice touch.

Perhaps younger kids might get more out of it and enjoy it more since it's possible they haven't seen the hundreds of other movies or read the books with the exact same plot where a bunch of school kids decide to play with an Ouija board on the off chance they can communicate with a fellow student who killed herself. Nothing of course bad can happen by doing that! Being its the same old tale means it's predictable what's going to happen and the supposed twist halfway through, well a twist is only a twist if it hasn't been done countless times before. The final scene also made no sense. Spoilers - if the original film's victim could come back to help her friend fight the ghost villain, why would she wait until then and not do that immediately after being killed. I mean someone just killed you in an unprovoked attack and you're not going to be at least a little bit annoyed about that, and delve out a bit of justice of them in the dead world. You'd at least drag them out of your parents house leaving them with an understanding of what you'll delve out to them if they even think of messing with your alive friends or family members?",1428969600,,1214,4.352422907488987

As an avid, and discerning, horror film buff, I can often find some value in even the worst films of the genre. This is by no means the worst film, but it will leave you underwhelmed and disappointed. The acting is tepid, and uninspired. The cliches (especially in the dialogue) are piled high. And the scares...non-existant. I was more horrified by the cost of a large tub of popcorn. Sadly, its not even that the scares don't work (they don't. Not even a little), but there are barely any attempts. The film is mostly an angsty teen drama with a transparent plot, and absolutely nothing new to offer. Honestly, you'll get more bang for your buck from Boogeyman ( and we all know what a spectacular crap fest that was).

6755194,2,B00OKB80KW,"Back in 1986 a movie came out called WITCHBOARD concerning an Ouija board that released an evil spirit. It had several sequels that never did as well as the initial release which was middling to begin with. Most talk about Ouija boards these days runs back and forth from those who think its a good way to reach spirits to others who feel that it opens a doorway to demons posing as said spirits. Ive always thought why invoke trouble?

Due to a lack of fresh ideas in some areas of Hollywood the Ouija board was found trying to make a comeback with this movie. Fortunately it didn't do too well at the box office and the DVD release didn't take long to happen. Is the movie really that bad? Maybe not but it isn't a good example of horror either.

The film opens with two young girls playing with an Ouija board and talking about how to use it. Fast forward to years later when one of the girls does the unthinkable by using it while alone. Shortly after that she walks to the top of the stairs and hangs herself from the chandelier. Disturbed by her death the group is determined to find out what happened and why she did this to herself.

To find out why they search her room and discover the old Ouija board they once played with. As is usually the case is horror films, the kids think they know more than they do and decide to gather together at their deceased friends house to use the board when her parents leave to get over their loss. Thinking theyve reached their friend they later discover that theyve actually discovered a spirit that lives in the house. As they try and find freedom for this troubled soul they are each forced to confront their deepest fears as a malevolent force in the house attacks each of them, taking them out one by one.

This film feels so familiar that its not funny. While watching I thought I was seeing a movie from my past, actually several movies from my past, that all used the same sort of concept and follow through. While this version seemed to have a larger budget than some of those it felt wasted with a movie that moves along at a snails pace with nary a scary moment in sight. And most of those scary moments are telegraphed so far in advance that the jumps you would have associated with them you experienced long ago in some other movie.

I will give them credit for a twist in the story late into the film. The problem is that by that time you no longer care about these characters or what happens to them. They become those people you think of in terms of Darwinism where you hope to thin out the herd by having the weak and stupid killed off. That twist I mentioned comes along far too late to save this film and it really does need saving.

After first watching the movie I thought of being kind to it and giving it a better rating. But the longer I thought about it the more I found the film to be one that is not only forgetful but should be forgotten. The fact that at the end there was one of those hints at a possible sequel made my insides twist hoping that it didn't do well enough at the box office to warrant one. Then again a sequel might turn out to offer a much better movie than we find here.

If I want to watch a movie about an Ouija board I think Ill track down a copy of WITCHBOARD. Even if its a VHS copy it has to be better than this one. With all the potential stories there are to be told this movie was one that left me wondering why they weren't made while this one got a green light.",1428537600,10,3465,4.201503759398496

6755236,4,B00OKB80KW,"When her friend Debbie (Shelley Hennig) dies in what appears to be a suicide, Laine (Olivia Cooke) thinks theres more to her death and it may involve the Ouija board that was in her house. Laine then enlists the help of her boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), her sister Sarah (Ana Cato), her friend Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos), and Debbies boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith). The friends decide to use the same Oujia board the home where Debbie died. When they think theyve made contact with Debbie, they feel they can finally put things to rest. However, something dark and sinister has broke through and they must figure out how to stop it.

Ouija is made from the much hated company known as Platinum Dunes, and it is a PG-13 horror film. This alone makes the horror community already hate it. However, this viewer found the film very entertaining film. It takes a simple idea as a Ouija board thats been used in several supernatural films and throws into a very well-executed script. It does feature a few horror cliches such as people suddenly appearing, doors slamming, and even the cliche of the parents conveniently going out of town right when things are about to go down. However, the overall story is interesting and features a pretty decent, although not totally surprising twist. One thing I always give Platinum Dunes credit for is their excellent use of setting, filming style, and atmosphere. All of which shows up here. Many of the settings the characters find themselves help boost the the spook/creep factor, as does the cinematography and set design. The film isn't scary, but it does a great job of providing just enough a creep factor to put the viewer in the right mind-set. And it does have seem genuine creepy moments, especially in the final act. The young cast also does very well with their roles, we believe them as a young group of kids, and they come off as pretty realistic. Olivia Cooke in particular who is known from the popular series Bates Motel shows that she can definitely pull of the role of the main girl. We really believe her as a girl wanting to know the truth and eventually wanting to save her friends. Definitely one actress to keep an eye on. One thing that particularly makes the film enjoyable is an excellent cameo made by an actress very well known in the horror genre.

Ouija may be made by a company with a bad rep in the horror community, and its PG-13, featuring some horror cliches. But it is a very entertaining film with a fun story, a great cast, excellent and creepy atmosphere/settings, and some genuinely spooky moments. Easily the most enjoyable PG-13 horror film since Insidious.

Considering the obvious major film budget, the film had some really slow parts and assumed that the movie-goer would either know, or make assumptions about certain things that nobody could have known, unless of course, they'd read the script and screen direction notations.

All in all, I like some of the actors in other roles, so I didn't want to rate this lower than a 3, (because I felt that the slow scenes were the obvious fault of editing and poor story direction, not the actors), but had I not been familiar with any of the cast, I probably would drop it to a solid 2.

I didn't know that spirits needed to open doors and why turn a stove gas burner on (for tea maybe), and didn't know they needed lights (either on or off). Don't people who hang themselves go through a muscle spasming? (Actor & director should learn to do some research.) Usual boring funeral gathering reminiscing scene and especially the tiresome going into the decease's bedroom and looking at photos, etc. Usual family members of previous tenants had an untimely death or two with the customary body still hidden somewhere in the house along with the usual relative in a mental institution (with wheelchair of course).

Yes, The death scenes could've been better but it was made for a younger audience so i'll let it slide. The story was easy enough to follow and was pretty good.

6755316,3,B00OKB80KW,"Okay, so here are my two cents on the film Ouija. If you have read the other reviews on Amazon, the prime complaint seems to be this film is not scary. I tend to agree and disagree. Basically, it depends on who you are.

For a seasoned horror fan, this film is the diet of sodas with watered down ice cubes and the promoted slogan ""from the producers of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and the producer of INSIDIOUS"" is misleading as it tends to advertise the film as something darker and macabre. For some, the Ouija board is something dark and macabre, or rather calling on spirits from beyond can be labeled as such. However, anyone going into this film knowing full well about the PG-13 should have little to complain, especially when this is a film based on a kids game. Likely, the producers intended this film to be just scary enough to motivate kids to go buy the real Ouija board game.

Having said that most typical kids (ages 9-12) will like the movie because they are not interested in plot development and have not seen movies with a similar formula. For those of us who have, the plot devices are tiresome and the film does not stand out from the rest. Also, for those parents who would like to treat their kids to a thrill without worrying about excessive gore, blood and violence this is a good option. Also, there is no sex or nudity.

On a side note, I was picking up on some strange (intentional, unintentional?) commentary toward male characters in the film - there's the absent father, the male creeper driving around, the disengaged male school representative and the useless boyfriends.

Bottom line: I gave it 3 stars rounding up because I really wanted to give it 2 and a half. Nobody likes to watch a mediocre clone of a similar film and this is what Ouija comes down to unfortunately. Had there been something notable, I would recommend it to new and old fans of the horror genre. As is, I believe only a certain age bracket would enjoy what this movie has to offer. Zoinks Scoooob, GhOOAAASTS!!! Yep, that is the general feel. :)",1426032000,3,2053,4.510752688172043

6755406,1,B00OKB80KW,"I never considered the Ouija game to be all that scary when I was a kid.  Heck it was made by Parker Brothers and sold right there on the shelf at Toys-R-Us along with Monopoly and Chutes and Ladders.  It might be one of those games you pull out of your closet a couple of times a year for a sleepover but I recall it eliciting more giggles than chills.  The Ouija board has largely garnered its more sinister image through films over the years.

The plot of these types of films is inevitably the samea group of teenagers is playing with one and unwittingly makes contact with an evil spirit.  This is where we begin in Ouija as a teenaged girl named Debbie plays the game alone and is later found dead in her home, hung by the neck by a strand of Christmas lights.

Her best friend Laine (Cooke) finds the Ouija board in her room and decides to gather the rest of Debbies friends together to hold a s&eacute;ance with the board and try to contact her spirit.  They make contact with another spirit whose name is only D and are too terrified to continue the s&eacute;ance.  Over the course of the next several days each begins to receive messages from the spirit saying Hi Friend.  Their investigations lead them to discover that there was a series of murders that took place in the house in the 1950s.  They also find that a survivor still lives in a nearby mental hospital.  As the spirit begins to kill the group one after another, the rest have to discover the terrifying secret of the vengeful spirit in order to put a halt to her wrath.

Ouija has very little going for it from start to finish.  The plot is silly and riddled with holes.  The main issue is that the spirits powers are wildly inconsistent.  It shows the ability to grab grown men and women and drag them down tunnels or hurl them against the wall into unconsciousness.  Yet when Laine has to burning the rotting body of the ghost and the board to finally put it to rest, the spirit cannot manage to stop her.

The movie is littered with one-dimensional performances from the entire cast who can add little to the paltry script.  The one bright light is the always enjoyable Lynn Shaye who has a small role as the woman living in the mental hospital.  And I mean come onNo one has ever been bored enough to play with a Ouija board by themselves.  Everyone knows you need at least another person to blame for moving the planchette around on the board.

If you are expecting an eye shutting seat gripping movie choose something else. If you want a good entertaining movie with a supernatural twist, this one is great.

I know it's an easy trick to set up for a mainstream film with a decent budget, but it was nice to see - even as a novelty - the planchette appear to move on its own with the actors' fingers clearly not moving it.

6755541,2,B00OKB80KW,"When horror fans complain about movies being over-reliant on cheap jump scares, this movie is a prime example of what that means. There are jump scares aplenty in Ouija, and the reason they're cheap is because all of ones in the first half of the film turn out to be nonsense. The viewer gets so inured to reacting to jump scares that when the real danger finally rears its head, the jump scares are no longer effective. That said, I suspect that the people complaining that this movie is just about a board game haven't actually seen this movie. If they had, they'd know it's a lot dumber than that. How dumb? One important plot point relies on these jerks NOT reporting a dead body to the cops. I can't give it less than two stars though, because it does show flashes of competence. The cinematography is excellent. The editing is terrible, with sudden transitions leaving the viewer wondering what the heck just happened, but when you are immersed in the scene, everything looks great. The CGI is very good. The acting is not nearly as bad as it could have been. There are a number of familiar faces from TV in this flick, which is casting tradition for a 'teens get picked off one by one' horror movie and not in the least unwelcome. Their reactions to certain events lack a sense of urgency, but that still has entertainment value, if only for all the wrong reasons. There was one scene in a high school hallway that made me laugh out loud. That's worth something. And there's Lin Shaye classing up the joint in a couple of scenes. It becomes painfully obvious that she is way better than the material she was given, but that doesn't make her performance any less enjoyable. Still, the story. This is not just a movie about a board game. This is a movie in which entire mise en scene from The Ring has been lifted and whole plot points from (spoiler!) The Grudge 2 have been shamelessly cribbed. If they had cribbed the scares from The Grudge 2 as well this might have been a better movie. Seriously, the Asylum mock-buster might turn out better than this. The Lifetime movie Secrets In The Walls is better than this. Supposedly there is a sequel to Ouija in the works. The ending certainly leaves room for one. The bar is set very low for Ouija 2 to be the rare sequel that is better than the first movie in a series.",1423612800,3,2323,4.455399061032864

6755550,2,B00OKB80KW,"I just finished watching this film earlier today. I have to say, I was a little disappointed.

When the film starts off, it's rather promising. Two girls fooling around with a Ouija Board, late at night, grabs your attention. Then the film flashes forward to when they become teens. One of them is acting a bit strange due to an old Ouija Board she's been messing around with in her house. But after the first death scene occurs, the film begins to spiral downward into a murky pool and never recovers.

One of the things that struck me about this movie, was how much it starts off like The Ring. A girl dies, and then there's a gathering at her home after the funeral. Other plot elements seem to shadow The Ring too, especially later on in the film. I don't want to give everything away, but if you watch both films together, you'll see what I mean.  I can't say Ouija totally ripped off The Ring 100%, but it sure seems like it borrowed ideas from it.

Ouija does try to become it's own story at some point. But even the Ouija Board sessions are a bit dull, if you can believe that. It's hard to put into words. But basically this film manages to make the idea of using a Ouija Board as a game with rules, that have to be followed by the ghost. I found that dumb. It also tries to get us to believe that a house, with a ton of extra space in it, was never discovered by the owners. I know we're talking about a horror movie here, but I wasn't buying into it for a minute. It just seemed like a convenient plot point, to move the story forward.

The Horror with the ghosts was subpar in my opinion, although there were a few jump scares throw in. In any case, they weren't enough to make the film, over the top, scary. I don't know what to say, it just seems like there were so many more directions the film could have gone in, but it picked the dullest direction it could find, stuck with it, and borrowed from The Ring to get it there. And in the end, The Ring is a much better ghost story.

Well that's my peace.  I'm giving Ouija two stars. It has a few good points to it, but really, I think it could have been much scarier, considering we're talking about an Ouija Board. It didn't do the idea of fooling around with a Ouija Board any justice.

This may be worth a rental if you're interested in it, but it's not really worth a purchase. You can give it a try, but keep expectations low.",1423440000,2,2395,4.18004338394794

I'm kind of glad that it wasn't just them playing around being stupid, rather they had a reason for doing what they did.  But this definitely has a ""Final Destination"" feel to it, and, frankly, I'm sick of those movies too.

I think what would have helped this movie is a little more build up.

I would still recommend watching it if you like horror films.  I already knew that it is not a good idea to play with the Ouija board so I already had an expectation of what was going to happen in the movie.  Points for not going over the top with the blood and guts.  Truly good horror film does not have to resort to the gross out effect to shock its audience.  Suspense is the key and this movie did have some very suspenseful moments.

Bottom line:
Rent the movie first.  If you liked it, then buy to add to your collection.

Like they could do any better half of yall can't even spell and the other half are just so stuck up there own ass that they can't appreciate a movie let alone anything. So think about this its a movie about a board did you obviously think it was gonna make movie of the year no. So just be happy someone went out there way to even make a movie to try and satisfy yalls ungrateful ass selfs.,1422662400,2,536,4.163461538461538
6755575,2,B00OKB80KW,"Ouija is somewhat of a paradox of a film. Imagine a movie made by the makers of a game warning you not to play the game. Now imagine the makers of a game warning you not to play it, but double-dog daring you to play it. Ive pretty much just described Hasbros supernatural horror dud Ouija.

A girl is mysteriously killed after recording herself playing with an ancient Ouija board. A group of her friends investigate the spirit board. They soon find out some things aren't meant to be played with when they awaken the dark powers of the other side.

Ouija is one of those movies where the kids involved do incredibly stupid stuff, make all the wrong decisions, and then die because of their bad choices. Unlike most teen slasher films, theres nothing fun or humorous here to be found. Its just one predictably bad action after the next resulting in death for whoever committed the transgression against the dead.

Set up like a visual instruction manual, Ouija teaches you how to play the board game you know you shouldnt. Its like they're taunting you to play with fire. Imagine someone telling you not to do something, but then giving you exact guidelines on how to do it. The actors say the words they're supposed to and follow the rules to communicate with the dead which is never a good idea, by the way. It all plays out like an over-extended TV commercial to sell the game.

The ultimate message of Ouija is you shouldnt play with the occult. Unfortunately, the message gets a little jumbled up when the friends use it to do battle against the spirits. Okay so don't use it unless you need to use it to fight the bad guys? Am I getting this right?

Ouija is rated PG-13, of course. Why wouldnt it be since its target demographic is plainly teens looking for mild scares. It includes disturbing violent content, frightening horror images, and thematic material.

The only special features included for Ouija is a bland Making of featurette. Its around three minutes long and consists of the cast and crew yammering about being scared on the set. They also talk about playing with the board for a movie that tells you not to play with the board while being a commercial for it. I digress much like the movie.

Any Christian is going to have problems with watching Ouija. Were all warned from childhood not to play with the occult or communicate with the dead and with good reason. Its pretty cut and dry in the Bible. When my wife found out I watched the movie in our home, she made me immediately take it out of the house and put it in the car. The film really does send a mixed message to younger viewers.

Ouija is obviously an attempt at both promoting a Hasbro board game and creating a teen version of Insidious or The Conjuring. However, theres nothing to be found here that is even half as endearing or memorable as either of those two films. Even the little twist during the climax cant save the movie in the end.",1422576000,,2927,4.499058380414312

Scary spirit starts to kill them off so they must banish her. It wasn't scary at all. I don't get the flossing scenes. Why are there two of them? Aside from that there were two things that really really bugged me. Okay, maybe three. 1. You can't just ring the doorbell at a mental hospital and announce you are there for visiting hours and they let you in. Also, they don't warehouse people in hospitals like that anymore. 2. The opening to the attic is a small square that a person barely fits through. So how did they get all that large stuff up there? Also, you can barely negotiate the cross beams...but they still store things there even though they have a huge empty basement. 3. There is no way a teenager is happily mAking a video about cleaning the disgustingly dusty and cobwebby attic.
It seemed to me they just put things in the movie without caring whether it made sense or not.

6755597,4,B00OKB80KW,"I really liked this movie! Ouija proves that teen horror movies can still be done decently. From the story to special effects, ""Ouija"" delivers a rollercoaster of horror, mystery and panic among the characters played by very talented teen actors like the lead, Olivia Cooke (Bates Motel, The Quiet Ones), who already proved that she can be a scream queen with her former projects, and Shelley Hennig (The Secret Circle, Teen Wolf), who shines as Debbie on every scene she's in.
The only problem with this film, is that it takes like thirty minutes to get actually really great. The beginning is amazing, but then it gets a little slow before it gets as great as the opening scene (they could have deleted some scenes in order to keep the energy), but overall, ""Ouija"" is a decent flick. You get to care for the characters, (all of them are likeable, even the ones you're supposed to hate), and at the end I actually wanted more.
This film is a refreshing break from other horror movies that came out last year, I'm a huge slasher fan, so I was glad to see teens for a change, and I can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray. ""Ouija"" is a keeper!",1421539200,,1135,4.461538461538462

Overall the movie isn't bad and the actors are obviously serious about their craft and this isn't such a bad debut for young aspiring actors in a major feature.

It's well directed for the most part but the ending was a little too predictable and cliche for my taste.

I was rather amused at the suicide hanging in the opening scene; first of all that was a real long string of Xmas lights even with extensions and they were still lit when she hung herself. Also, I thought it was quite a testament to the construction of the ceiling which never buckled while she's hanging from the chandelier; just some nit picking on stupid details.

seeing spooky things through the magnifier was a nice special effects touch.

All in all, the basic plot is OK and stays on track without any tiresome bedroom scenes and the usual silliness viewers have to put up with in lesser productions. It does make a solid attempt at being a serious horror film with integrity.",1421280000,3,1090,4.48989898989899

What I mean is, it's a fun movie to watch with friends and constantly make fun of.  Sort of the way I felt about ""You're Next"".  Some of it was so cheesy, that you had to laugh, but then there'd be a nice jump scare and it would balance itself out.  Honestly, it reminded me of a ""crappier"" version of Final Destination, but with better looking actresses.  I do enjoy Olivia Cooke.  She's probably my favorite character on ""Bate's Motel"".  I hope to see her in far more movies in the future, because I think she's a great actress.  There's just not anything terribly original in this movie.

It centers around two childhood friends, Laine and Debbie (Cooke and Shelly Hennig).  In the past they have played around with a Ouija board and had some fun, but have since discarded it as they got older.  While cleaning her attic, Debbie REdiscovers the board and without thinking, begins playing alone.  Apparently this is a big NO NO?!  I've never heard of any actual ""rules"" to these boards, but according to this movie, there a quite a few.  Long story short, Debbie makes her exit from the movie and Laine (along with her friends) set out to uncover the reason(s) behind her untimely death.

The cast is game (Lin Shaye, from ""Insidious"" fame, absolutely steals the show with her delightfully off the rails role) and tries to do the best with the hollow and one dimensional characters they were given, it's occasionally mildly fun in the way it embraces its ""shadows in the dark"" cliches( which still work surprisingly well and dominate the first hour of the film) but it never really tries to break out of the mold and be remotely terrifying. This is most obvious in its limp and rushed finale that feels like an afterthought or as if the filmmakers themselves just wanted to get it over with (much like the audience in its much padded 89 minute run time). Of the few positive things I can say the filmmakers were wise enough to keep the atrocious C.G.I. to a minimum until the last act.

Oh wait, its actually called Ouija; and its supposed to be a horror film. My bad.

What is correct about the film is that everyone in this wreck is so absolutely brain-dead, its a miracle that the audience and myself remembered how to exit the theater, much less walk in general. Of course, with it being a Michael Bay production, thats a given.

The rundown for the film is this: Some girl messes with a spirit board, kills herself, and now its up to her sister to unravel the mystery behind her death. But how would one accomplish such a feat?

By trying to contact her using the exact same spirit board that killed her, isn't it obvious? Whats the worst that could happen when contacting benevolent demons from beyond our realm?

At the risk of sounding redundant, nothing good, apparently. Apologies for spoiling the plot twist.

The acting, however, is a different story. The mannequins that try to portray human beings in Ouija try their best with what theyve got, even with the enormous setbacks that hinder their bodies. If it weren't for that, they couldve easily perfected the style of showing actual human emotions, traits, maybe even personalities.

Is that asking too much? Probably, but one can dream.

But no film of this magnitude would be complete without its fair share of laziness and cheap jump scares, due to the painfully obvious fact that this was slapped together to pay off some parking tickets. Any semblance of horror, or anything that would evoke a reaction from someone with a functioning brain for that matter, didn't seem to appear in the consciences of the writers.

Ouija is the embodiment of every single tired and beaten cliche, stereotype, and trope that has been endlessly parodied in every shape and form. All due to Bays inability to use his vast amount of wealth and influence to produce anything even remotely decent or watchable instead of throwing it at a rubber wall to see if itll stick.

In the end, its is just another defective product off of Michael Bays assembly line, which is somehow still functioning. Unfortunately, there are no refunds given in this type of business.",1415577600,7,2387,4.8861386138613865
