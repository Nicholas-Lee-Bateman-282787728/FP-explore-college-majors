6680562,3,B00NUYG8WW,"As a dad, I cannot think of anything more horrific than something bad happening to one of my kids.  The possibility of this haunts me sometimes during the day and has caused more than a few sleepless nights.  So when I run across horror movies that deal with kids, I always try to take a look.  After all, what is the point of watching a horror movie, if not to scare yourself?  SPEAK NO EVIL deals not with one, but all of the children in a rural midwestern town.  And although its not an excellent film, it still merits a look.

The first time I read the plot synopsis, I immediately thought of films like COME OUT AND PLAY and ISLAND OF THE DAMNED.  Kids going crazy and killing adults is a chilling concept, and every parent probably feels like I do, in that its a terrifying scenario with a no-win ending.  If you cant restrain or subdue a child that is trying to murder you, then what do you do?  Kill him?  A reprehensible option, but it does beg the question.

SPEAK NO EVIL delves into this situation, however the film never fully fleshes it out.  As a result, the story feels a bit choppy here and there.  One minute the townsfolk are trying to subdue their kids, and the next, they're shooting them down in the street or burning them alive.  I scratched my head as this quick transition emerged; it just didn't feel right.

The acting is pretty good, especially when considering the leads haven't done much in the past (per their IMDB pages).  Young Olivia Cavender, who portrays the main possessed child, Joey Girl, does a fantastic job in her role.  I had no problem believing she was overtaken by demonic forces.  I hope to see more of her in the future.

Likewise, the cinematography in SPEAK NO EVIL is impressive as well.  There are several well-crafted surrealistic scenes that leave the viewer feeling uneasy.  This helped set the dark tone for the film, especially those that featured the horse/dog-headed demonic images.  THOSE were truly creepy.

But the storyline is where this film falls short for me.  Several things happen that are not explained, and this immediately makes me frown while watching a film.  For example, the preachers assistant acts homicidal from the minute he steps onscreen for the first time.  He seems eager to shoot the children before any signs of demonic possession pop up.  And we never see how he convinces the townspeople to kill their own kids.  Like I mentioned before, it seems like one minute the parents are worried, and the next they are loading their shotguns.

Still, SPEAK NO EVIL is a truly chilling film that horror fans should enjoy.  It is relatively short, clocking in at 74 minutes, but it packs enough of a punch in that small time to provide some scares and entertainment.  Despite its flaws, I liked it, and I recommend giving it a try.  It releases today, so make a note.",1417478400,4,2843,4.568316831683168

6680565,1,B00NUYG8WW,"Not even worth your time.  Very graphic, but in a stupid way.  I quit watching 3/4 into the movie, so I don't know how it ends.  Worse part is that I saw the ratings before renting, and thought the commenters were exaggerating.  They are not exaggerating!",1420416000,3,255,4.478260869565218

6680567,1,B00NUYG8WW,"Don't be fooled by the trailer like I was, I just watched this idiotic thing the plot if you can call it that is moronic all the towns kids mysteriously disappear in one day then all come back with their tongues cut out possessed by demons. I'd rather watch roach porn than subject myself to the torture of watching this soiled diaper again, whoever wrote this crap must have over dosed on moron pills and was in a semi conscious crack coma

This thing is confusing, you have the preacher dude praying doing his version of an exorcism while they held a girl down who was violently reacting to the prayers preacher dude tells them to release her they do and she goes on a rampage, ah duh not supposed to let the possessed one up till the demon is gone prevents serious carnage. The guy who wrote this should have watched The Exorcist and took notes before making this garbage. If you like movies where children go bad try Children Of The Corn  it is great with an excellent plot and so are it's sequels",1419724800,2,1001,4.376344086021505

And they are like shot on video by college students with the worst dialogue and acting imaginable. This movie is worth way more than it has been rated here.
