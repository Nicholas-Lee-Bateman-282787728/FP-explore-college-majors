6497720,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"A very young and fresh Queen demonstrate the dynamic stage performance that would later electrify stadiums all over the world.  I read complaints about the quality of the video.  I think it's fine.  It's a live performance, it's early material and it's Freddie Mercury prancing, dancing, swinging and strutting.  I think this is one of the best bands of all time and to be able to have this slice of history captured is a gift.  I highly endorse this to any Queen fan.",1410480000,,468,4.590361445783133

6497722,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"This amazing CD (and its Blu-ray counterpart) essentially servers as a time capsule for Queen fans and rock fans in general. It offers listeners a trip back to 1974, prior to Queen hitting mass success. ""Queen Live at the Rainbow 74"" offers a rare glimpse into Queen's early, heavier style; capturing the group live at time when they were still striving to establish themselves as a truly great rock band.

The first set on ""Queen Live at the Rainbow 74"" (recorded in March of 1974) was originally intended to be released as a live record to help support Queen's first two albums but was shelved in favor of recording their next studio album (which would eventually become ""Sheer Heart Attack"").

That said, the material on the CD may not be familiar to many people who identify themselves as Queen fans (and that's completely understandable). It's easy to forget that Queen was a band that produced 15 studio albums and as a result, many fans are simply unaware of the powerful brilliance and dark intensity of Queen's earliest material. Better stated, ""old Queen"" did not start with ""A Night at the Opera""; it started with Queen and Queen II. When hearing this material performed live you'll not only realize how rich and diverse Queen's catalog of material is; you'll also realize that Queen was a band that had many different musical incarnations and was constantly reinventing themselves while at the same time retaining the stylistic elements that made their sound truly unique.

In addition to the March concert (which was in support of Queen and Queen II), listeners will also have the treat of hearing (and seeing) a November 1974 performance which includes material from both earlier albums and material from ""Sheer Heart Attack"".  In addition to the CD version, this concert is presented in a SD Blu-ray and looks pretty damn good.  The picture not perfect but when considering the equipment that was used (and the fact that the footage is 40 years old), I don't think it can look much better.  It's clear, bright and vibrant and is certainly worth the price.  In addition, you'll have the chance to hear the concert in DTS-HD surround sound.  All in all, it's a pretty awesome experience and a great addition to the CD version.

Looking at the CD / Blu-ray in terms of content; it's simply amazing. What more could you ask for? Both versions include many rarely played Queen songs such as...

Father To Son
Ogre Battle
Son And Daughter
White Queen (As It Began)
The March Of The Black Queen
Great King Rat
The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke
Liar
Flick Of The Wrist
Bring Back That Leroy Brown
Stone Cold Crazy
Big Spender
See What A Fool I've Been

And what's really awesome about this release is that all of the songs are preformed loud, hard and raw with a relentlessness and power that only a young, hungry and talented band could deliver.

Over the course of the two live performances, the group rips through progressive, heavy and melodic progressions with Brian May's roaring guitar riffs paring in perfect sync with the tight and powerful rhythm section provided by Roger Taylor and John Deacon. Freddie Mercury's voice is strong, subtle, passionate and powerful all at the same time. He provides regal phrasing and a vocal command that perfectly blends with the vocal contributions of his counterparts to produce beautiful harmonies that would eventually become a Queen hallmark.

I can go on and on but I think you get the point. The CD (and its Blu-ray counterpart) captures Queen kicking the doors off of The Rainbow Room and taking no prisoners. It displays Queen's ability to rock the stage with the heaviest of bands and do so with precision, style and an uncanny ability to reproduce complex studio recordings in a live venue.

That alone presents a great offering but what makes this offering truly special is its ability to offer its listeners something that most other live recordings cannot; an opportunity to see a different view of a band that most people believe they already know and have known for years.

Maybe you know Queen and maybe you don't. In either scenario, the release of ""Live at The Rainbow Room 74"" gives us all an opportunity to discover (or rediscover) one of rock's greatest bands.",1410307200,49,4232,4.817931034482759
6497723,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"This is a fantastic concert by Queen. Filmed on the Sheer Heart Attack Tour this concert shows Queen doing what they do best & that's kick butt. The audio & picture is awesome & all involved did an excellent job of restoring this concert. If you love either early Queen or just great 70's Rock n Roll, you won't be sorry you got it.",1410220800,6,332,4.203125
6497724,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"A 4.5 star release. It's excellent to have this footage of Queen finally released legally. The visuals, considering the original source (videotape) and the time period (1974), are pretty sharp on the DVD version. I like it that it retains the videotape look (as in a REALLY REALLY GOOD ORIGINAL VIDEOTAPE MASTER), instead of the producers trying to ""change"" it to look like movie film (i.e. The Who's ""Live in Chicago 1979"" DVD; Cheap Trick's ""At Budokan (1979)"" DVD.)

For me, the only flaw in the DVD is that although the bass signals are prominent, there is almost too much of a ""boomy"" sound, which causes some of John Deacon's bass notes to lose some of their clarity. As a result of the slightly murky boomy sound, the instruments do sound live. Roger Taylor and Brian May (and occasionally Deacon) provide backup vocals, and it's only a couple of moments that possibly telegraph that the band may have overdubbed some background vocals onto the recording (the high, eerie backup vocals on ""Now I'm Here"" during Taylor's ferocious drum fills might have been overdubbed.) The cameras give more time to Mercury, but without really ignoring Deacon, May and Taylor. Only a sluggish spotlight or two detract from a strong visual experience (not the fault of the DVD producers.)

Let's face it, this late in the game, even with a couple tiny glitches, ""Live at the Rainbow 74"" is a treasure for us Queen fans. It's nice that Eagle Rock put out a Queen recording other than the (still-great) 1980s concert DVD recordings. I love ""Wembley 86,"" ""Montreal,"" ""On Fire: At the Bowl,"" ""Live Aid,"" etc., but it's cool to have live 70s-era Queen on DVD. Now bring out ""Houston 1977,"" ""Hyde Park 1976"" and something from the Night at the Opera and Jazz tours (and The Beatles' ""Let It Be"" film) onto DVD next.  :)",1409702400,64,1803,4.735668789808917

6497739,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"My friend, if you are a longtime Queen fan who loves those early years when Queen rocked, this performance is a treasure. I am so grateful that Queen hit it big before the advent of the amphetamine-influenced editing so characteristic of the MTV generation. This show was shot the way a show should be shot, where you feel like you're in the audience without some attention whore director jumping to a different camera every three seconds in hopes that he'll be picked up for producing the next video by Berlin or Motley Crue. This footage is not about the director or the producer, this footage is as it should be, entirely about the subject matter - Queen delivering a powerhouse performance.

The video quality is great, although those who think that everything should have digital origins might prefer tidy footage from a Queen tribute band instead. However, the four bonus video tracks from the Queen II tour, I will grant you, are a little more primitive. But for me it's all about the quality of the band and performance, so if a videotape quality capture is the only thing from the tour supporting a legendary album, I welcome it with open arms.

The performance is classic Queen. At this point in time the best front man in the history of rock, Mr. Mercury, does not yet have the expansive arena staging to enable his commanding the thrust stages on stage left and on stage right. It will also be another year or two before he is pirouetting in a jester's diamond-patterned tights. But the limits of the staging do not contain the band's energy.

When I received this as a long-awaited Christmas gift my father-in-law asked me, ""Does it have 'Fat Bottomed Girls""? My wife, a casual Queen fan who thoroughly enjoyed watching this with me, later noticed, ""Hey, they didn't do 'Bohemian Rhapsody', did they?"" One year after this set was recorded, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" would sit atop the UK charts, establishing a long primacy for Queen. But this early material drawn from Queen's first three albums is uniformly strong; there's not a clunker in the bunch. It's a testament to the strength of this material and this performance that my wife didn't even notice the absence of their later hits until hours after we'd enjoyed watching the show. She particularly enjoyed the ferocious delivery of ""Seven Seas of Rhye"". As did I; it was the first time I'd seen this song live. Although I saw Queen four times in the 70s, it makes me sad to think I only had the chance to see a couple songs from ""Queen II"" on the ""Day at the Races"" tour. After that the album disappeared from their live sets, which only emphasizes how much of a goldmine this find is for first generation Queen fans.

I originally got the mp3 version of this show which includes both concerts in full, one at the Rainbow for the Queen II tour and the one shown on this DVD/Blu-Ray from the Sheer Heart Attack tour in November of that same year, 1974. I would recommend both the two-show audio version as well as this one-show video version.

I only wish my old friend Richard could have lived long enough to see the release of this treasure and the official release of the 1975 Christmas ""A Night at the Odeon"" DVD/mp3. Richard made a devout Queen fan of me by introducing me to ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""Queen II"", as well as other favorites like Jethro Tull's ""A Passion Play"". We enjoyed the original US broadcast of that Hammersmith Odeon show together, as well as seeing Queen live during their mid-to-late-seventies heyday. I know my old friend would have had the same enthusiasm for these performances as I do. Here's to you, Richard, and thanks again for introducing me to Queen.",1451088000,,3655,4.642967542503864

6497788,4,B00LOZ9ODY,"Hi Queen fans.

I was happy to see that this was released.  I was 10 years old when I got my first Queen album, and by the time I was old enough to attend a rock concert, Queen really wasn't touring in the U.S.

Now with this release, we can watch Queen before they became hit makers.  With that, we can see them performing some deeper cuts from their first three albums.  For me, seeing them perform the medley, specifically the segment from Bring Back that Leroy Brown is worth the purchase price.  It was also nice to hear Freddy singing before he abandoned hitting any of the high notes in songs, and also hearing Brian sing some backing vocals (which he seemed to back away from in later videos I've seen)

What makes it a 4 star for me is that they obviously used backing tapes in a few places, which is a little weak.  The video quality is good, and the audio quality is good, especially for something so old.",1413763200,,916,4.284883720930233

6497791,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"I was a bit skeptical at first because I thought that the quality of the audio and video from a concert performed in November of 1974 would not measure up to today's standards, especially where Blu-Ray was concerned. OK, so I finally gave in to my curiosity and bought the Blu-Ray. I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that the quality of the audio and video were every bit as good as some of the more recently released concert purchases I've made and actually better than some of the other more recent offerings from other artists. This is Queen in their prime, in rare form, and better than I could ever have anticipated. I was a junior in high school when this concert was recorded and, forty years later, it completely blew me away. The only thing that was a disappointment, and it is a minor one, is that the aspect ratio for the video is 4:3 rather than 16:9. It's precisely because I don't care for the boxy video that I was initially disgruntled but I was able to remedy that disappointment by zooming to the 16:9 widescreen setting and then I just let the show take over. The November concert performance is stellar and it is quite evident that Queen never had to rely on studio enhancements to achieve their majestic sound. Everything, from Freddie's voice to Brian's guitar, John's bass, and Roger's drums, is balanced and brilliant and I am still amazed at how incredible this band was with only three studio albums in their catalog. The bonus tracks from the March concert are also good but the video quality is tainted due to the age of the film and, apparently, the bulk of that particular show is missing. There's a disclaimer and request that anyone with any knowledge of the whereabouts of the missing footage from the concert please contact the band's management. That notice struck me as Monty Pythonesque and quite funny. Anyway, this is a must for every Queen fan, despite the 4:3 aspect ratio of the video, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the power and splendor of an expertly crafted and performed concert.",1413331200,3,2052,4.6401098901098905
6497792,5,B00LOZ9ODY,Outstanding show from 1974. Some audio and visual limitations due to the date of the show but sound overall is excellent. Really highlights queen before they made it big and are really rocking hard at this point in their career. On some of the songs they almost sound like a cross between led zeppelin and Black Sabbath.,1413158400,,320,4.631578947368421

6497797,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"I had the good fortune to see Queen back in early 1974, and they were the opening act.  They were so good that virtually no one stayed for the headliners after a song or two.  This Blu-ray captures the sheer fury of early Queen.  I was always a fan of the band but some of the later work did get a wee fey.  Here we get a large dose of hard rock showcasing Brian May as well as Roger Taylor.  Naturally Freddie Mercury is the star of the show but he gets some competition here.  The audio is loud and proud in 5.1 and the video looks good, with ink black stage lighting.  It is great to have this record of the band before the monster hits piled up and they softened their approach a little.",1412812800,,691,4.036764705882353
6497798,4,B00LOZ9ODY,"Early Queen! Not sure why it took 'em so long to release this (re-release?) but definitely worth the wait. Not sure how much touring the band had done at this point and you can sorta see Freddie searching for the persona of ""Greatest Frontman Ever"" (which he absolutely was, the 20 minutes Queen played at ""Live Aid"" is a Master Class in rock-n-roll)  but he's in very fine voice and flirting up a storm with the crowd. There's a little aftermarket fudgery on the audio, not sure if that was back then as there were plans to release a live record or more recently, most obviously on the backing vocals but not a huge amount. Most unfortunate is the visual--the concert was videotaped and looks it, poor detail and quite dark in places--compared to the ""Hungarian Rhapsody"" concert, not as powerful a performance but just beautiful color and definition. If you're any kind of Queen fan, you've already bought this and watched it 10 times. To the casual listener, maybe not the Blu-Ray to start with as the material is all off the first three albums and other than ""Killer Queen"", light on hits. I personally love it, Brian May is in tip-top game, playing up a storm and Roger and the underrated John Deacon are as tight a rhythm section as you'd want.",1412726400,7,1250,4.580357142857143
6497799,3,B00LOZ9ODY,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned the heavy overdubs that are obvious on almost every song....I would suspect they Re sang the entire show in the studio for purposes of creating a more polished product....as a singer myself I can spot a dub pretty easily....when I hear stacked harmonies in at least two octaves...being sung by as few as two members on some songs....that being said this is still an amazing document of early, hard rocking Queen....just would have been better if it was not so doctored up.",1412726400,7,507,4.7727272727272725

6497801,5,B00LOZ9ODY,Early Queen is my favorite and I have had this concert on vhs for years (a bootleg I picked up at a convention. Was ecstatic when I heard it was being released on blu-ray and it doesn't dissapoint! Great job of remastering both the audio and video!,1412726400,,248,4.297872340425532
6497802,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"Queen is one of those few bands that did nothing wrong! Maybe some little mistakes like ""The Invisible Man"" from The Miracle and ""Back Chat"" from the not so beloved Hot Space. You can count the bad things on one hand! On top of that, Queen in '74 had already an incredible music smartness and tightness, you could feel and see where they were heading to.
Listening to the double CD and then watching the DVD, I have to smile and remind myself how heavy and raw this band was, before the more refined era of the white and black albums. What makes Queen stand apart from Zeppelin, Purple and Sabbath in those days was simply Mercury's theatrical voice, (one of the greatest lead singers of all time!) and May's clean and well calculated guitar work. Combined with an, out of this world and unbeatable vocal unity, this quartet deserves to be among the 5 greatest bands of the past 40 years. I love it!!!",1412640000,2,901,4.466666666666667

6497804,3,B00LOZ9ODY,"Recorded in 1974, this is a very young and unpolished Queen.  The theater sized audience is small compared to their later years.  Long hair, matching outfits, and energy is there.  24 songs from before 1974 from their first 2 albums are performed over a 90 minute period.  Three or 4 songs survive into the 1980s performances.  There are 4 video song extras that run together like 1 song.  It's interesting to compare this to their 1980s DVDs which are much much better.  The video quality is VHS or worse.  The lighting is poor and it makes the video look black and white.  The outfits are B+W which worsens the color effect.  It's a simple stage and uses spot lights that move a lot.  When they are off (often) everything is pitch black.  The drummer is often in the dark.  Very little color shows.  The sound quality is so-so but OK for one viewing.  The audio and video are in sync.  A booklet is included but it contains only pictures.  The songs are listed on the back of the case.  This is more for collectors and you are unlikely to watch it over and over.  Once was enough for me.  I'm happy with the purchase but will continue to watch their 1980s DVDs for the polished performances, selections of performed music, and quality.",1412640000,2,1237,4.486486486486487

6497808,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"Oh my GOD!  Oh my GOD!!!  I am an atheist and I'm screaming Oh my GOD, that ought to be some sort of indication as to the magic and wonder of the contents of this DVD/Blu Ray.  In 1974, Queen were a hungry band, just putting their well glam'd out heel into the history of Rock and Roll, having only recently cracked America with Sheer Heart Attack, which they'd only recently released when this concert took place.  This was not the Queen of Bohemian Rhapsody yet, this, was a band who had their claws out and were coming for your neck and OH MY GOD!!!!!

Where do I even begin?  Well firstly, here is where you get to see just how unreal this band was in terms of how TIGHT they were.  These are complicated songs, borderline Progressive Rock in nature (much of the first two albums, were both Guitar Driven and very long form, with many parts), with vocals harmonies to attack that should you get so much as an atom of a note off, you'd collapse the whole structure, and they were PERFECT.  I don't think I've ever described a band as perfect, but Queen in 1974 are as perfect as a band can get, and they left not one drop of room for error.  Queen were not a band known for jamming out on their material, a la Zeppelin or Purple, but Queen ARE known for very thorough arrangements, and this concert displays this gorgeously, as they took moments of songs and worked them for solos, worked them for interludes, re-arranged pieces here and there to make it more exciting.  In particular a Medley of In The Lap Of The Gods/Killer Queen/March of the Black Queen made me sit and squeal like a 13 year old girl.  Another thing?  This Queen were LOUD.  I mean, Queen were always a Hard Rock Band, but they were HEAVY METAL BAND loud here, Brian May is all the way up, and that signature vibrato of his, on his Red Special is all but coming to lop your head clean off your neck.  GLORIOUS!!  Moreover, they were SINGING ALL THE BACKUP PARTS LIVE (which yes they did, but would do so less and less as the years would elapse).  Yet another thing?  This band looked AWESOME!!! Dressed up in natty quasi Glam Rock attire, Zandra Rhodes's amazing costumery, each member looked positively resplendent, even John Deacon!!!  Roger Taylor is shown off soooo well here, this secret weapon of Queen with a voice of the angels (how many bands do you know of where your drummer is almost every bit as great a singer as your lead vocalist with a highhhhh soprano voice???), looking GORGEOUS, hair long, multiple chains hanging from the neck, and playing drums like a GOD.

It's always amazed me that Brian May, guitar GOD, has been and always has been since, a very elegant stately figure, letting his fingers do the screaming and the rest of him, is just a lovely graceful figure.  In his Zandra Rhodes flowing white cape, his long fingers blazing across the neck of his Red Special, Echoplex turned all the way up for the solo on Brighton Rock's interlude, it's both heartwarming and jaw dropping.  After all, this is Dr. Brian May astrophysicist we're speaking of!  No wonder that he'd go on to be a man of Space, because he took the world to space and back mannnnnnny times with a Pence in one hand, and the guitar in the other.  Brian isn't one of Rock's best for no reason, his playing of a caliber that few would go near, technique, intonation and vibrato on par with future NeoClassical Greats like Yngwie Malmsteen, and even more impressively he'd use the guitar to create......THE GUITAR-ESTRA!!!  A FULL ORCHESTRA MADE WITH GUITAR, just to suit the lofty band arrangements.  Sublime.

From soup to nuts, Queen...thought BIG.  All the way BIG.

Then of course.....there's Freddie.  In a world where every accolade, every praiseworthy sentiment has been made about the great Mr. Mercury, here is....the very reason as to why he earned his crown. This is a performance that will render you to tears, and make you curse a Godless world that this man, is no longer with us.  Freddie here, is on FIRE, his voice absolutely perfect, that signature fast whispery vibrato cutting through the air of London's Rainbow Theater like Itzhak Perelman's violin, a perfect instrument, played by a perfect musician, and the ULTIMATE showman.  From the minute the concert begins to the pulsations of Now I'm Here you are indeed THERE, and Mr. Bulsara is going to take you on an adventure like none you've had before.  Nowhere in any universe can I think of a performer who'd have been comfortable on Broadway, standing Center Stage at The Met, noodling away at the world's great Cabaret's and Jazz Club's and rocking the hell out of Wembley with equal ability and sheer chutzpah, but there, was our star, the greatest star, Freddie showing the full arsenal of all he had to offer, and that, was enough to offer galaxy volumes for aeons.  How lucky the audience in 1974 was to hear brilliant moment followed by more brilliant moments, and then Freddie naturally, and with pure ""Minelli"" confidence address the crowd as ""darlings"" and asking them if ""who wore their ""black nail polish.""  Ironically, I had on black nail polish and found myself screaming ME...to no one at all in the house.  Freddie dazzles on piano, he commands the stage like a panther with full reign to hunt.  He is so good, he makes the best that ever lived pale in comparison, as he prowls the stage like a dancer, unleashing rock's most unique and gorgeous voice upon an audience hungry for it.

In short, this is a concert on par with the best you'll ever see, and if you want to see Queen on the rise, this is both eye opening and pulse quickening.  It's a must see for rock fans, especially Queen fans, most of us would long wondered ""what would it have been like to see this band during the time of their first two guitar driven albums?""  You will likely cry, you will scream, you will be elated, you will be stunned, you will ultimately be exhausted as great shows should make you feel.  Once upon a time, GIANTS walked the Earth, witness one of the biggest bash a stage in London to Smithereens.  As they themselves bellow ""come tonight, come to the Ogre site, come to Ogre BATTLE FIGHT!!!!!!!

I'd give this 100,000,000 stars if I could.  At least three different times I said ""I CAN NOT HANDLE HOW GOOD THIS IS.""  I cried deeply, watching my hero Freddie command like no one ever could.  I felt awe inspiring jealousy, incredulous amounts of sadness knowing that time, is gone forever, the best that ever was....the best that ever could be.  People, buy this, buy for a friend, buy a few copies to have around the house, just GET IT.",1412121600,43,6585,4.551782682512734

I was hooked in 1973 when Queen released there debut album with Keep Yourself Alive. I put the needle down on that vinyl record and Keep Yourself Alive was the first song I had ever heard by Queen and my life was changed forever. Thank You Queen for all the music you gave us. I highly recommend this concert. Do yourself a favor and watch this DVD.,1411862400,,459,4.2272727272727275
6497811,5,B00LOZ9ODY,"What a wonderful concert. Full of energy and great music, as always from Queen.

Soundtrack does not sound as clear as I would have wanted (compared to Rock Montreal), but that's probably because the source was not that great either.
While the performance deserves full 5 stars and that's why I still rate it this way I have a problem with companies releasing blu-ray disks in 2014 in the interlaced format. When this video was remastered and cleaned a good quality de-interlacer could have been used thus improving video quality, even Yadiff in VLC infinitely better than what most TVs can do. Unfortunately my Blu-Ray player (PS3) is unable to perform de-interlacing of 1080i content. The video could have benefited from somewhat more aggressive temporal noise reduction and super-resolution post-processing (although I'm sure some was used to get the results we see on this disk).

The audio, on the other hand is glorious :-) This recording just reaffirms that Freddie Mercury was the greatest singer/front man of all time.
