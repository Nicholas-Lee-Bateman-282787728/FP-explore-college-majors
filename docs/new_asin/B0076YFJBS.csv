5058705,1,B0076YFJBS,I have several UFO dvds and this one by far is the worst.  I had trouble getting it to load!  After several tries I went to disc #2 and the same thing.  I tried disc #3 and it finally loaded and it was very repretitious of other dvds I have.  It looked like this had been recorded in someone's garage copying info from other discs.  I was very disappointed!  Looks like I might use these discs for trap-shooting!  Do not buy this!!!!!!,1335484800,7,435,4.2317073170731705
8511292,5,B0076YFJBS,"It was not what I was expecting.  However, it was very informative.  It was actual seminars taped live.  I leaned a lot from them and would recommend to anyone interested in knowing the truth of things that have been and what may yet come.",1427587200,3,239,4.386363636363637
8511293,5,B0076YFJBS,VERY GOOD,1414713600,,9,4.0
8511294,1,B0076YFJBS,The whole DVD consist of one speaker after another talking in a Dimly lite room from the beginning DVD to the last DVD. They do not interview anyone or talk to people that have experienced an encounter. The cover on the DVD and the rating is a scam. If anyone wrote a good review for this DVD they probably had some financial gain from it.,1402012800,2,339,4.230769230769231
8511295,1,B0076YFJBS,"This is a film of a talk Mr. Stitchin made back in the 70's or 80's (seems like it) and is boring as all get out.  I fell asleep in the the first 15 minutes of it. The visual and sound qualities are terrible.  Unless this is your thing, it's not worth this price of admission even back then.",1390953600,,291,3.9152542372881354
8511296,4,B0076YFJBS,I gave this a four because the presentations do include differing scientific opinions on UFOs and of Zecharia's work. It was good to hear a different opinion instead of an all pro-UFO documentary. I believe this is a good value for the money.,1363392000,7,242,4.651162790697675
8511297,5,B0076YFJBS,I really dig the recent attention on our ancient alien ancestors. Lots of new info here and will give you plenty to think about. I'm hoping for a sequel to this release.,1358121600,2,169,4.3125
8511298,5,B0076YFJBS,I wanted it to add to my reference collection also to increase my knowledge on the subject to Enhanced my collection,1355184000,,116,4.571428571428571
8511299,3,B0076YFJBS,"It was great to finally get a real history lesson!  Sitchin does a great job of leading you through the ages, and makes it so obvious that alien beings had a large role in the formation of our early societies.",1353456000,5,209,4.225
8511300,3,B0076YFJBS,"A three disc set.  Disc 1 - Zecharia Sitchin delivers his lecture on past visitations from space beings in the Ancient Earth.  If you've read his book, the Lost Realms, you know all this, but it's nice to hear the voice and see the man himself.  Disc 2 is Jason Martell and Dr. Tom Van Flandern at the Central Coast UFO-Symposium of 2008 and shows two lengthy lectures/slide shows.  Dr. Van Flandern is a real scientist and an excellent lecturer--it's too bad we don't get the full lecture but what's here is terrific.  His theory that Earth and Mars are broken pieces of the same planet has some real merit, I think.  Disc 3 is another Jason Martell lecture, this one emphasizing the technology of the ancient astronauts he believes visited ancient people.  It's easy to see how the pyramids and other presumably man-made objects might have been constructed instead for extraterrestrial navigation, but the proof is still out there, to my mind.  If you like your information in lecture form, this collection is for you.  It's also a good introduction to three of the main characters in this kind of research.",1340409600,12,1109,4.734375
8511301,3,B0076YFJBS,"This documentary is from the Area 51 Archives and comes from Zecharia Sitchin, author of the series books called The Earth Chronicles. This subject is pretty much his life's work, so what you get is a pretty dedicated view. The cinematography leaves something to be desired, but some might say that just adds to the authenticity. Pretty good price for a 3-DVD set.",1338854400,5,364,4.7936507936507935
