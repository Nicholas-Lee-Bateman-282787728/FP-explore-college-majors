7037276,5,B00UER2N7M,"This is one of my favorite aquarium DVD sets.  There is a total of six different aquariums to choose from that include lots of colorful tropical fish and backgrounds.  I really enjoyed the diversity of the scenes and all the bright colored fish.  There is a fish that looks like a rainbow and no matter how many times I look at this DVD, it still looks amazing.

The sound accompaniment can be aquarium bubbles, music or waves. The sounds are all high quality and well recorded. All the filming is clear and HD high color.  There is no shaking or panning.  It is as if you were watching your own tropical aquarium at your house.

I like that the World Nature Videos/ISIS products don't just give you two or three minutes of a scene and then loop it.  They give you at least ten minutes of a changing scene and then it loops individually or can be looped together with the other scenes.

There is even a night aquarium which is something unusual and beautiful. I love this set and highly recommend it.",1434585600,6,1000,4.420765027322404

7037278,5,B00UER2N7M,"This DVD-Set is really good. The set contains videos of colorful fishes and corals. Both DVDs contain videos of aquariums and also a movie on each DVD. The videos are showing the aquarium from one position (without camera movement), while the movies show different scenes with more camera movement. What I really like about these DVDs is that you can decide which background music you want to listen to. You can mainly choose between ocean sounds, piano music or bubble sounds. But also mixes of music and natural sounds are possible. This way, you can decide for yourself whether you want to listen to relaxing sounds or music. The DVDs are amazing for home usage, but I can also imagine them in public places, like waiting rooms. A great variety of aquariums with tropical and colorful fishes.",1428969600,5,795,4.810218978102189
8705524,2,B00UER2N7M,"I did not like this dvd.  The water background sound did not match the picture.  It sounds like waves at the beach, not an aquarium.  The picture was not very clear.  I purchased a item like this in a blue ray disc and it was much better.  I would not recommend this dvd. I returned it the same day that I got it.",1498262400,,313,3.9047619047619047

8705527,5,B00UER2N7M,Love!! I use it in my salon on my flatscreen TV that hangs on the wall way easier than keeping a real aquarium the colors are amazing and the kids that come in absolutely love it. I find it very relaxing .if we want to listen to the music or the sound of the beach or the bubbles it's really nice I kept the other one for my house because it comes with two discs great purchase,1480982400,,377,3.909090909090909
