8744411,4,B0198PQ858,"The name John Knox is one that elicits a diversity of reactions. Though a domineering, authoritative, and difficult man, he is often regarded as one of Presbyterianism's greatest heroes. Relying on multiple interviews with pastors and scholars this film presents a captivating portrait of the life and times of Knox. Viewers will be introduced to the reluctant man who became a preacher, a galley slave, and went on to be Scotland's central figure in the Reformation.

The production and editing of this biography is high-quality and the content, though introductory in nature, is informative. Viewers, I trust, will appreciate this. However, two comments seem warranted to demonstrate potential shortcomings. The first, is that the documentary though marketed in such a way to promote relevance, does not, in the mind of this reviewer, make itself very practical. It collates facts but never really gets around to informing Christians of a contemporary context what helpful lessons we may learn from Knox's life and times. The second, and this pertains more to the audience than the film itself, is that viewers should be encouraged to not be caught up in a certain kind of idealization of Knox. It is easy to romanticize the man who brought a sharp sword and even sharper tongue to the Reformation. Nevertheless, as the interviewers demonstrate, this did not come without some disagreement even from contemporaries like John Calvin.",1474588800,3,1434,5.207792207792208
