8010731,4,B0001DCYE6,"The girls in this movie will remind you of the ""it"" girls in your highschool days. I thought that this movie was quite effective in creating a spooky atmosphere although it was too vague at the end. It would have been nice if they explored the ""twist"" more. Flawless editing helped to keep me watching as did the stylish cinematography. The acting was mostly good from everybody. The cop could have showed a little more range of emotions. All in all, this movie is a good rental to watch when you're in the mood for something suspenseful with a twist at the end.",1097625600,4,562,4.466019417475728
8010732,2,B0001DCYE6,"This movie is rude. All 4 characters are unlikeable and immature. It had the atmosphere of GINGER SNAPS, but none of the style, ambition,  or clarity of the story telling. by the end of POSERS, I could care less who was trying to backstab and set up who. In fact, I'm still not sure who all killed whom. The character's better-than-thou attitudes was a bit much. The one answered her phone everytime ""Talk!"". If it were me calling her, I'd have an airhorn on my end. Better yet,I'd kill her off first.",1078012800,5,501,4.445652173913044
