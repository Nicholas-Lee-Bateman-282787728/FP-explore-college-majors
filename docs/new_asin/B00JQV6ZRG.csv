8653372,4,B00JQV6ZRG,"Great movie.  Sadly, not pressed, or burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

This is a Great Movie.  The image quality is excellent. Humorous and well acted.",1518566400,,705,4.682926829268292

8653378,4,B00JQV6ZRG,"This very interesting time capsule film represents that late 40's, early 50's period of American optimism. Rooney and Bracken are excellent. The cars, the business ideas, the motorcycles and the girls are great. Worth seeing.",1402617600,,225,5.457142857142857
