Poetry is at once the most artful and most elemental form of literature. Its conventions of rhyme, meter, metaphor and the like distinguish poetry unmistakably from the prose we use all the time, and this contributes to the erroneous view of poetry as artifice, as frills or luxury item. The truth is that poetry goes to the heart of human existence, with a purity and power akin to surgery. The ""thickened"" language of poetry, the economy of verse, the startling vistas of metaphor and simile, the play of rhythm, the sheer concentration of vision, all make poetry into a privileged form of expression, a mode of discovery that bids to challenge and to change the way we customarily do business. From Shakespeare's Sonnets through the great Romantic poets Blake and Whitman, including the iconoclastic visions of Dickinson, and moving into our own century with Frost, Stevens and Adrienne Rich, we shall see what a bristling human document the poem can be, how it offers a unique portrait of private psyche and public setting. More than any other art form, poetry capture the dance of the human mind, displays for us the way meanings are made, and makes us understand just how precious a resource language itself is, in our lives.
