8189121,2,630428697X,"This video seems to be only for people who have never stretched before.  Being someone who has been active and played sports her entire life, I found this video consists of basic stretches that any active person would  instinctively do before or after any workout.  There are some stretches  that are more closely associated with yoga positions and are not normally  in a stretch routine.  Anyone with an athletic background could do this  routine without the aid or instruction of the video.  I felt that this  video moved too fast, especially since it is entitled ""stretch.""  Most stretches should be held for about 15 seconds while this video allowed  barely half that time.  It is hard to concentrate on and regulate breathing  with the pace it sets; just as you are settling into your pose, they  instruct you to move on.  Who wants to be constantly hitting the pause  button?  This video would be good for someone looking for instruction in  stretching basics or someone who wants a methodical routine to follow.  While stretching is great and necessary (especially in preperation for  yoga), don't expect this video to be actual yoga -- it is only stretching.  For a really great beginning yoga video, try Kathy Smith's Yoga Basics.",958262400,12,1239,4.860576923076923
