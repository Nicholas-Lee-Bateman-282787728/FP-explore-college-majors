2195832,4,B0006U5V58,"This series is great for teaching Character Education. You have the concept/Character Trait, then the story centered around the topic/concept, followed by music.

This a a great teaching tool!",1181174400,,192,5.620689655172414
2195833,5,B0006U5V58,This is a great release of a classic cartoon series. I love that they added the cd with all the songs from these episodes. What happened to vol. 3 It was to be released and it disappeared? Bummer!,1176768000,2,196,4.184210526315789
2195834,5,B0006U5V58,"The tape came in perfect brand new condition.  My grandson loved it -

good, funny family entertainment.  Excellent!!

2195835,5,B0006U5V58,"I like the animation, I like the characters, the stories usually have a moral and are very entertaining.  It makes me wish I knew who the kids were that inspired these stories, assuming they are kids who grew up with Bill Cosby in Philadelphia.............",1167868800,2,256,4.818181818181818
2195836,4,B0006U5V58,"The storylines are great and the shows are very entertaining. Unlike most of cartoons on television today, these episodes are very wholesome and you don't need to worry about your kids hearing inappropriate language. My 11 and 8 year old kids like the shows but they don't crave them like some of the other DVDs we have. In the words of my children, ""They're pretty good."" We all like the uniqueness of each character. The only down side of each show is the music with the moral message at the end. No one in my house is crazy about them. That being said, I think there is a strong possibility we will buy the second season.",1142294400,4,624,4.387931034482759
2195837,4,B0006U5V58,"Those of us who grew up in the seventies will always have fond memories of watching the Fat Albert cartoons on CBS-TV; this budget-priced DVD collection features the first dozen episodes as aired in the fall of 1972. Bill Cosby hosted each show and also provided a few of the characters' voices, but his greatest contribution to the series may have been his insistence on high-quality writing in collaboration with professional educators. Fewer episodes were produced as a result, but the attention to quality made the shows surprisingly durable over seven years of reruns on Saturday morning TV.

Cosby had tremendous respect for young children, and his segments in the series demonstrate his gift for being able to talk to children without talking down to them. Like a good teacher, Cosby addressed his young viewers not as immature troublemakers, but as the young adults they would one day become. His presence was more than just a gimmick to keep animation costs down; he actually gave instant credibility to the lessons that were being taught in every episode.

This DVD package includes an audio CD of the songs from each episode, but the sound quality is poor; what you're hearing is the original tinny-sounding TV soundtrack with extra bass added. Sadly, the only way you can hear these songs in stereo is to hunt down a copy of the ultra-rare 1973 soundtrack LP. Hopefully, someone will dig up the original studio tapes for a CD boxed set soon, and I hope it includes the soulful instrumental themes as well.

In its day, the series was widely praised by parents and educators for its positive portrayal of black teenagers as role models for young viewers. Three decades later, these shows are still considered the standard by which all other animated series are judged. In fact, I can't think of a cartoon series on the air today that combines education and entertainment as skillfully as the Fat Albert series. Watching these cartoons again for the first time in 25 years brought back many pleasant memories from my childhood. I recommend it highly to parents looking for an educational show that can teach without the preach.",1111881600,30,2137,4.897790055248619
2195838,4,B0006U5V58,"I always enjoyed watching ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"" when I was young.  Not only was it funny and imaginative (some of Rudy and Russell's slams on each other were hysterical), but each episode always contained a good moral lesson and great music to boot!  This 2-disc DVD set contains the first 12 episodes broadcast on CBS in 1972.  I'm not sure how the publisher went about acquiring the films to transfer to DVD, though.  Some of the episodes clock in at around 19:30 and contain the original opening and closing sequences, while others clock in around 21:30 and appear to be the 1984 syndicated versions (with the 80's style ""FILMATION Presents"" tag and an older Bill Cosby with shorter hair in the intro.)  I don't know if the syndicated versions had footage added to them later, or if the original versions presented here are cut.  Because of all that, something does not totally jive with the way this set is presented.  However, it is a great buy for fans of the show or for anyone who enjoys classic cartoons that are not only fun to watch (even as an adult), but teach a good lesson as well.  Let's hope enough future volumes are released to make up a complete 110 episode set!",1110585600,20,1192,4.537383177570093
2195839,5,B0006U5V58,"This time, they got it right on putting FA&TCK on DVD!

This has the good stuff from the Golden era. Great stories interwoven with stuff from Cosby's classic routines, the wonderful songs of the Junkyard Band and the voice of Micheal Gray (note to FA novices-the Junkyard Band was the Cosby Kids band that provided the cool music for the show-and an additional CD of the songs to boot!) memorable characters (Begging Benny, Scrap Iron Yates, Dumb Donald's cousin Betty, Lying Edward, etc.)

""Moving,"" what I consider to the their all-time best episode, is included here. In 30 minutes, Albert and crew play out Bill Cosby's classic BUCK BUCK and GO CARTS routines within the context of the story, as well as a really beautiful song called ""Friends"" that holds up well years later.

""Fish Out of Water"" has the gang meeting some white kids at a summer camp (surprisingly, the difference in the character's race as a source of their antagonism is deftly underplayed). But the thing to watch out for in this one is an animated version of the greatest of all Bill Cosby routines-THE CHICKEN HEART as Cosby's younger animated self scares his friends with this tale around the campfire.

""Creativity"" tells the tale of the forming of the Junkyard Band, and includes Bill Cosby's ""Mudfoot Brown"" character (one wonders if this was the source of Richard Pryor's legendary ""Mudbone"") telling Albert and Weird Harold a tall tale about bear fighting. This bit has nothing to do with the story in question, but it's a really cool scene as children today rarely experience the pleasure of having an old man in their neighborhood entertain them with wild stories.

These epsiodes played well to us seventies children, and I have noticed that their effect on children of today has not diminished. Like ""Bullwinkle"" and ""Garfield and Friends,"" (and as ""Kim Possible"" will surely be to future generations), it's a timeless classic.

Two more volumes of these classic first 36 episodes of FA&TCK are on the way, so save your piggy banks. HOWEVER-beware of the post 1979 Junkyard Bandless episodes with the sorry ""Brown Hornet"" episodes and overbearingly unfunny stories. Don't waste your time or cash with any of that shark-jumping junk.

It would be great to see the 1969 FA pilot/debut HEY! HEY! HEY! IT'S FAT ALBERT and the almost-forgotten 1970 sequel WEIRD HAROLD (which, as I vividly recall, was based entirely on the GO CARTS  routine and was only shown once afterward around 1973) on one of the future Fat Albert DVDs. Just a suggestion, but in the meatime, get with the kids and enjoy as a family some really great stories and songs together.",1110412800,22,2633,4.861607142857143

Such as if a mother & father have enough affection to love all their children.  Or how lying can cause problems, practical jokes, safety and many other circumstances.

First they set up the story by Bill Cosby talking about the topic, then they show the animated feature involving the children in the situation, then Bill Cosby talks about the end results and then it is presented through a song.  Very good for children.",1390608000,,538,4.752688172043011

But the genius of Bill Cosby is evident here. The jokes are still funny, the slapstick still works, and the characters are very human.

Yes, at least two of these episodes even feature that elusive ""duck"" character (apparently, a pet of Russel's) that was seen during the initial opening credits from the 1972-'73 seasons. Sure some of the production material used in this DVD release include the iconic ""Filmation Presents"" bumpers (meaning that they used the syndicated, reran versions of the episodes from the '80s where they added an additional moral segment after the musical number to make the episode roughly two minutes longer). Still, the Junkyard Band's all back again to teach a new generation or allow old fans to revisit lessons about the consequences of lying and playing pranks and to use creativity and be careful who you put up on a pedestal as a hero.

The twelve episodes are hosted by Bill Cosby (he has a doctorate of education) in the early seventies. Each episode has a lesson for the young viewers and even adults.

I enjoyed watching the DVDs again. I always loved Fat Albert but I never understood why Bill Cosby or Dr. Cosby was there in the first place until now as an adult. He is sort of the narrator of the series. I loved the Cosby kids especially Fat Albert and Smush Mouth. Twelve classic episodes with a purpose and a new song to go with it. I enjoyed the CD as well.
