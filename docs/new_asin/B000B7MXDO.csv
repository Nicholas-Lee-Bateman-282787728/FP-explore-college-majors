2404709,4,B000B7MXDO,"We have never seen Season 1 of the Doodlebops and it is quite different than Season 2.  This DVD has 2 episodes from Season 1 and 2 from Season 2.  The Doodlebops look different in the first season and there is a ""Mazz"" and not a ""Jazz"" (Jazz is way better!!!)  In Season 1, the Bops wear mask like head gear with fake ears which makes them a lot stiffer and freakier.  Deedee's dress is different too.  Bottom line, Season 1 does not hold my 2 year old's attention as well. I wish I had known it was a mixture of both seasons as I might have held off. However, for the price, it is still good entertainment! We love Rooney!",1184198400,5,624,4.12396694214876

2404712,5,B000B7MXDO,"The Doodlebops have had to grow on me. We catch it on Saturdays and I've had some difficulty sitting through it. However, my daughter, 18 months, loves it. I bought this for her and it's by far the best 4 episodes that I've seen. The more she watches it, the more I enjoy it. Now I watch it and can see the appeal. They are adorable little characters. The music is upbeat and fun. They dance, play instruments, etc. It really is an adorable act. This video is definitely worth having.",1165276800,6,484,4.329670329670329

2404715,5,B000B7MXDO,"My 2 1/2 yr old son has been OBSESSED with the Doodlebops for over 6 months now!  He has his own version of their dances memorized, and does them ALL the time!  He knows all of their songs, and is really into the Doodlebop Pledge.  We don't have cable, but from seeing it on at other peoples houses (maybe once a month), he started doing the dances.  It took over a month to figure out what he was doing all the time.  I finally bought the cd to play in the car, and a couple of the dvd's so he can watch it at home.  What I love about this show, is he is active while watching, dancing around the living room.  It is not something where he just sits there.  It is also educational, and the songs are easy to learn and catchy.  He loves it soo much, I bought him a Moe costume on Ebay for Halloween, and for his next birthday (not till april) I am taking him to their concert in St Paul.  I have no doubt he will still love them by that time.  I don't know any 2 year olds who DON'T love the Doodlebops!  We brought the DVD to daycare for share a movie day a few weeks ago, and I still have toddlers coming up to me every day saying thanks for bringing the doodlebops and telling me they like doodlebops.  His whole class (about 14 kids) all loved it, and ask the teachers to watch it all the time!  A great buy for anyone with a toddler!",1160265600,,1338,3.981203007518797
2404716,2,B000B7MXDO,"My family are big fans of kids music. We listen to XM Kids all the time. My youngest caught the Doodlebops on Disney and liked the Get on the Bus Song. My husband and I on the other hand can barely tolerate the show.

Once we got the DVD, both girls found it average at best which is telling when kids want to play things they like over and over. This DVD has been played twice.

The biggest problem I have is the music and the whole show is so contrived. The actors don't actual play music. The actors I am sure do not write any songs. At least the Wiggles wrote their own music and could play instruments. It just seems dishonest.",1153872000,,632,4.130081300813008
2404717,5,B000B7MXDO,This is an excellent buy for any toddler who loves to sing and dance.  The tunes are easy to learn and you will be humming along as well.,1137283200,8,137,3.892857142857143
2404718,5,B000B7MXDO,"I am telling you!!!  The Doodlebops are so much fun for my 21 month old!  He loves dancing when they sing and loves Bob the bus driver.  He is mezmerized by the lively colors and how much fun they are.  He also learns alot as well from them.  They teach young children how to play together, how to count, and so many other developmental skills that are important in their growing years!  I highly recommend the Doodlebops to everyone that have young children.  I even catch myself singing their songs as well!",1134086400,13,509,4.467391304347826

2404731,4,B000B7MXDO,I was familiar with the doodlebops and wanted to see if my 4 and 2 year old would like them. Success! Now the three of us are annoying my husband with the songs who can't seem to stand them. ;) This dvd has three episodes.,1468713600,,222,3.9555555555555557

2404778,5,B000B7MXDO,"My 3 year old loves the Doodlebops! They are a very bright, colorful and entertaining trio and keep my daughter engaged for the entirity of the video. The reason we purchased this DVD is because we lost our Where's Moe DVD and my daughter kept asking for it. When I read the reviews for all of the Doodlebop DVDs there was a lot of discussion about the ""old"" and ""new"" Doodlebops. I have only seen one type of Doodlebop (judging by the descriptions in the reviews I think we are watching the ""old"" version) and they are great! So I'm not sure your little one will mind the differences. This is a great DVD for little kids (although, I do catch my 6 year old watching it with her sister).",1319587200,,687,4.292307692307692

2404791,5,B000B7MXDO,"My two year old daughter became a fan of this group since she was about six months old. She has four of their DVDs, and she loves them all. However, I find that kids that have not previously seen the TV programs show little interest for the Doodlebops, so the DVD might be good for kids already familiar with the group, but not so good for those who have no idea of who these guys are.",1234051200,,385,4.078947368421052
2404792,2,B000B7MXDO,"This DVD is of the ""old"" Doodlebops.  They look like they're wearing masks with big ears.  DeeDee has a very big, unflattering costume on.  Jazzmin is a thinner woman who's name is Jazz.  Very different from the current Doodlebops seen on TV.  Would not recommend this, they've changed for a reason.  My daughter loves the Doodlebops, but will not watch this DVD.",1231891200,3,363,4.774193548387097
