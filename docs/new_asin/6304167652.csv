803551,5,6304167652,"Netflix describes this movie: ""This Oscar-nominated film follows a self-described talent scout as he travels the back roads of Sicily. Armed with a camera, he sells screen tests to poor village folk, who are only too eager to fall for the promise of movie stardom. Men, women and children swarm to him, turning their tests into confessions that are tragic, comic, rhapsodic and revealing. But the gambit takes an unexpected turn when 18-year-old orphan Beata enters the picture...""
The premise is odd, but it's played out in a marvelously quirky fashion.  The lead actor has a face that reacts subtly but completely to everyone around him, while the scenery and supporting cast are Sicily personified.  The action and plot move gently as befits the time and place.  Definitely worth watching.",1044835200,5,792,5.076923076923077
803552,2,6304167652,"In general, I'll sum up the ""The Star Maker"" by reiterating what other reviewers have stated here: if you rented this movie because it was the director's follow-up to the incredible Cinema Paradiso, you've set yourself up for a huge disappointment.
But my big complaint has to do with the misleading cover box art (i.e., alluring woman with eyes peering out over sunglasses, ruby red lips, etc.). This has NOTHING to do with the movie. Such a character never appears. This image is about as far from the actual content of the film as you can get. I've lodged similar complaints about ""Brassed Off"" and ""East is East,"" both described by insipid marketers as ""wacky comedies."" Each is a great movie in its own right, but neither is a wacky comedy by any stretch. My question is: are the people that design these boxes for the American market just flat-out dumb, or are they simply completely cynical about the intelligence of the American audience?",999648000,7,946,4.774390243902439

803556,5,6304167652,"Set sometime in the early post-WWII era, a con-man travels the Italian countryside with a movie camera and prop truck, masqerading as a talent scout from Universal Studios in Rome. He promises people in local villages  the opportunity to be discovered by ""Italy's greatest directors and  producers, and even those from America"". A short screen test is all it  takes, requiring an investment only of their ""obvious"" talents,  their time and a ""small bit"" of money. The simple people are  easily seduced by his promises of fame and fortune, and for the man's  camera (it has no film!), they open their hearts, their dreams, their  memories and, unfortunately, their wallets. The man is not all bad,  however, and he meets several people who profoundly affect his opinion of  himself. Finally, a beautiful young woman forces him to reconsider his  life. The story is at once hilarious, sentimental, touching, sad, and  thought-provoking. Shot entirely in quaint Italian villages and the  beautiful Italian countryside, the scenery is spectacular. I  whole-heartedly recommend this film, even to those who don't speak Italian.  I don't speak Italian, and I hope you won't let the need to read subtitles  cause you to miss this wonderful film.",914803200,12,1238,5.12

But here the innocence of Paradiso is offset by a con man, Morelli, who travels through Sicily and convinces villagers they can be a star, earn millions and be successful.  He charges the villagers for the screen test that involves a reading from Gone With the Wind.  But as he films the villagers eager for stardom, and they strike the various poses.  Not only do they recite the scripts, they bare their soul to the camera, while opening up with their confessions.

803634,5,6304167652,"Joe Morelli (Sergio Castellitto) is a flimflam man who is driving around the rural villages of Sicily shortly after World War II selling potential stardom for fifteen hundred lira.  He has a motion picture camera and loudspeaker on his truck.  As he drives through the villages he broadcasts to the people that he is from the film industry of Roma and he is giving screen tests in order to discover natural talent.

He sets up his truck and tent typically in the town square.  His technique is to tell everyone that they have a wonderful face, hidden talent, that they are naturals and diamonds in the rough.  He hands out fliers with some dialogue from ""Gone with the Wind"" on them that they should practice reading before appearing before his camera.  He has discovered that people will fall for his flattery and pay him for the fake screen tests.

As we watch the film we discover that people will put their hearts and souls into the experience of appearing before his camera.  They don't just read the lines from Gone with the Wind.  They tell their life stories in miniature.  They bare their hearts and souls to the flimflam man in the hope that someone will hear and see their anguish, their pain, their experience.  To Morelli, who has been to Hollywood and failed, this is just a way to make a lira.  He has a gift for the hustle and is blind to the real emotion that he evokes.

A woman believes her teenaged daughter has the talent to make it in the movies.  She begs Morelli to take her to Roma.  She even has sex with him and promises to allow him to be her daughter's first lover.  But Morelli moves on to the next town.  He is stopped by the local police chief, but Morelli manages to flatter him into appearing before his camera and then applauds the chief's performance.  Three highwaymen stop to rob Morelli.  He is able to convince them that Roma longs for their raw talent.  And so on, as he travels over the cobblestones and over the winding roads.

Finally he meets beautiful Beata (Tiziana Lodato) who is 15 or 18.  She isn't sure.  She works in the convent, bathing the sick and scrubbing the floors.  She exposes herself to the local tax man to raise the 1500 lira needed for Morelli's screen test.  She is strikingly beautiful from head to toe, and the tax man exclaims, ""You are a statue!"" when he sees her body.  Morelli is reluctant to get involved with someone so young even though she throws herself at him.

What happens after this I will not say since it would spoil the film for those who have not seen it.  But watch for the con man to get conned, among other things.  Despite his villainy, there is a sense that Morelli is a man that we can identify with and understand.  I think it is this quality that director Giuseppe Tornatore has developed in his character that carries the film, and Sergio Castellitto whom I saw recently in Non ti muovere (Don't Move) (2004) really becomes the part.

Tornatore, who made a splash with the critically acclaimed Cinema Paradiso (1988) wrote the original material here and worked on the script in addition to directing.  While I thought Cinema Paradiso was an excellent film, I liked this one even more.  Both are original works of art, but I found L'uomo delle stelle more engaging.  Particularly striking are the beautiful village scenes, the faces of the people, and the photography of the Sicilian countryside and ruins.",1200960000,2,3399,4.5636363636363635
803635,5,6304167652,"Another one of Tornatore's journeys, beutifully filmed and narranted. This time, it's a con man travelling through Sicilly (Tornatorre's birthplace) following the war. As usual, that's the canvas over which Tornatorre paints a critical picture of Italy of the period - full of hope (all towns and village people who want to try out for the movies), satire (the bandits, who also want to pose for the camera) and tragedy (a love story).

Tornatorre remains true to his exceptional skill to weave the beautiful, the profane and the ugly - all with a blend of sarcasm, nostalgia and human understanding.

This is another wonderful of Tornatore's movies - fans of the director will appreciate it subtle beauty, as will the general viewer who is looking for a richly painted canvas of Italian life in the poor south following the war. For the Tornatore fans, I also recommend ""Everybody's fine"" if you can find it (""Cinema Paradiso"", ""Malena"" and ""The Legend of 1900"" being the more well known of the director's movies).",1184544000,,1015,4.9298245614035086

803638,4,6304167652,"Ever since Miramax edited the dark last act out of Cinema Paradiso to make a more sentimental film, Giuseppe Tornatore has been written off by many as something of a lightweight. On the face of it, The Star Maker would seem to have the perfect setup for a whimsical comedy of love and redemption as it follows a conman winding his way through post-war Sicily charging the locals 1,500 lira for screen tests he never even bothers to develop. The locals unburden their souls and confess their desperation to him as his camera becomes a confessional, building up a vivid portrait of a desperate place in a desperate time, but it makes little impression on him. In fact, despite the beautiful photography and the `cute' setup as one simple local girl follows him in the hopes of stardom and escape, it's resolutely unsentimental - redemption is denied and he never really learns anything from the experience. Even in the final scenes, he never really gets it.

Unfortunately, this very misleadingly packaged DVD appears to be cut by some seven minutes from the Italian version (with one of the most gaping jumps in continuity I've seen in a film since Tom Horn), but there's more than enough surviving to mark this out as a winner, more bitter than sweet.

No extras (aside from some promos for other Miramax releases) but the good subtitled 2.35:1 widescreen transfer shows off the ambitious and accomplished camerawork well.",1166227200,4,1422,4.847736625514403

i know that every copy other than the italian original and the korean version of ""Malena"" (highly reccommended for tornatore fans) were shortened by 11 minutes by miramax..  perhaps there was too much sex in the film for american censure; perhaps now there's not emough character development in the movie to completely fall in love with it. the other reviewers hit the nail on the head about the sobering effect of witnessing people expose their lives for the chance at fame, but either way, before the cutting room floor or after, there's something missing from the main character of this film. if any of you know where it is please tell me.",1079913600,9,1037,4.4526315789473685
803640,4,6304167652,"No, this is not a chic little euro-comedy like the picture on the front cover might suggest, or a charming new bent on ""The Music Man"" as implied by the plot outlined on the dvd box. In fact, it isn't funny or romantic at all.
That said, like ""The Music Man,"" this is also the story of a con man. He travels from town to town, promising to make people stars, taking their money, auditioning them for star quality, advising them on how to make themselves more appealing, then going along his merry way. But in this case, he devirginizes your underage daughter, steals your wife's jewelry, then charges you for telling you that your nose is too big for the Hollywood screen. (Well, perhaps that all didn't happen, but it just as well could have with the inscrupulous nature of the film's antihero.)
The interesting and sad aspect of the story, and what should have been advertised about the film, is its demomstration of how people, desperately in need of hope in a time a great depression, will allow themselves to be fooled into believing anything to keep their hopes alive -  even if it means buying the dreams spun by a corrupt ""Star Maker.""
It's a good film, but be warned, it is sobering, not lovely.",1078185600,8,1204,4.522935779816514
803641,5,6304167652,"It didn't surprise me that few Americans appreciated this film.  Unless you know something about Sicily or have traveled there, you might not appreciate the full scope of this film, which is understandable -- but still, it is a fantastic and highly original movie that stands easily on its own merits.
Set in the late 1940s or early 1950s, the story revolves around Morelli, a conman from Rome who steals a truck, camera, and discarded film from the movie company he works for and drives down to Sicily.  Posing as ""Dr. Morelli"", the conman (played by Sergio Castellitto) convinces whole towns of ordinary Sicilians that he is really a talent agent scouting out new genius in the poverty-stricken island of he south.  He could have stepped out of the dream world of the circus.  Charging 1,500 lire for a chance to pose before his camera and take a stab at making it as an actor, Morelli offers these Sicilians a chance of fame and fortune in the glitzy world of Rome and America that also means an opportunity to escape the impoverishment of their homeland.
In incredible scene after incredible scene (made even better by a phenomenally good screenplay), Morelli gets these Sicilians to open up.  Although they aren't actually being filmed (they don't realize that the film Morelli is using is junk), they think this may be their chance to break into acting, so they spill out their inner worries and life stories as though they were talking in front of a psychiatrist.  What results is not only a panoramic and extremely original portrayal of the Sicilian people (including the mafia, bandits, an old Spanish Republican, a 112-year-old Garibaldino, a harassed homosexual, and a beautiful but naive teenage girl whom Morelli falls in love with).  It is also a blisteringly sharp attack on the causes of backwardness in Sicily (which still exists today), as well as the sneering attitude of many northern Italians toward the South.  While he initially took them to be just ""idiotic rednecks"" ripe to be ripped off, Morelli slowly discovers the Sicilians' humanity without this film being in any way a quaint or ""cutesy"" portrayal of how a man discovered the natives in ""quaint, sun-baked Italian villages"".
""The Star Maker"" is full of humor as well as tragedy.  As the great Sicilian writer Leonardo Sciascia wrote, humor is a staple of life in Sicily as in few other places -- it has to be in order for survival to go on.  Moreover, unlike the stereotypical Hollywood portrayals of Sicily in ""The Godfather"" movies, ""The Star Maker"" has a very profound social message.  As the girl, Beata, says at the end of the film, ""I like movies with a happy ending, where lovers kiss in each other's arms"".  Unfortunately, in Sicily, a happy ending just would not tell the entire story.
I was flabbergasted and sobered by this film.  I was even more flabbergasted by its lame critical reception in the United States and by reviewers at Amazon.com.  If moviegoers in this country go on thinking that ""Legally Blonde"" is the supreme height of cinematic achievement, I really think we're going to go totally brain-dead.

SM started out with little main character development which is forgivable, but I never really got a sense of Joe's initial ambition. Things started to move fast village to village as it was obvious that his fraudelent pose as a talent scout was getting out of trouble. The back-to-back-to-back Cop/bandit/mafia scenes were a little to preposterous, unless Tornatore was attempting humor, and if so, it was a little to strung out and ultimately fell flat, and if not, it was just to simple of an illustration of how one's ambition of fame teases them into forgetting their duty or nature. An otherwise touching scene is undermined by a non-existent soundtrack. Not a bad soundtrack, it's Ennio after all. But as a scene unfolded that was intended to imply that Joe was becoming emotionaly engadged with a story, there was no slow attack of any musical score, and with only occasional abprupt close-ups on the subjects faces (no slow zooming in), just made me have to work to become emotionally invoved myself. Frankly, it got boring with every screen test. And when I finally thought Joe has discovered an ominous subject that would tip his/my emotional scale, the apparent War vetran mute approached him that night in the tent asking for a chance to tell his story in front of Joe's camera The scene was gripping me all the way to his turn left/right/center seat while he was preparing to tell what was promising to be a movie direction changing story, only to end in a incoherent regiment chant which Joe, as usual, dismisses as more wasted film. The most compelling part of the film comes at toward the end after Joe comes to terms with his love for Beata, afterwhich he almost immeditely gets arrested,sent to prison, and they're separated for a long length of time (about 4 minutes movie time). He gets released, looks for her at her old convent, movie theatre, while chowing down, get's told she's in a asylum, finds her, makes a promise, drives away having screen test flashbacks then the credits roll (this literally took all of about 10min). The best part of the movie was the last 13min or so.  Keep in mind, I'm a huge Paridiso and Malena fan, but this Tornatore effort just seemed amature by comparison. Abysmal pacing, horrible English translation, and foregettable characters.

7864118,4,6304167652,"A memorable and heart wrenching tribute to Sicily! This film captures the soul of the Sicilian post-WWII experience, candidly revealing its peoples joys and sorrows, desires and dreams. The Roman con-man, Morelli, drives through Sicily posing as a film talent scout, charging 1500 lire for a screen test. Traveling through the island's rugged, natural beauty, we observe an agricultural economy, devastated by war and peppered with villages, dominated by a church, piazza and, sometimes, a tiny cinema. This is an older, harder way of life, entrenched in poverty and corruption. And, the faces, the faces stamped by experience, so many, varied and revealing faces: the young and old, rich and poor, crazy, the `seduced and abandoned,' whore, and homosexual; the carabinieri, the mafia, monarchists, anarchists, fascists, communists, and Christian Democrats. Every townsperson has a dream to escape for a better life.

Appearance and performance are embedded in Italian culture: All Italians are born actors! Many American viewers may not realize that the possibility of starring or participating in movies was a very real one at the time. By definition, the neo-realist directors used natural settings and non-actors in their films; People were selected for their faces and distinct characteristics. Female, Italian screen stars, such as Magnano, Bose, Lollobrigida, Loren and Cardinale, launched their film careers by winning regional beauty contests. Some auteurs actually preferred non-professional actors to achieve their cinematic visions because they required minimal coaching and could be directed.
Rossellini tied a string to a non-professional's toe and tugged on it when he wanted him to move. Fellini was notorious for providing no dialogue until shooting the scene and posing his characters, earning him the moniker of puppet master.

So, although Morelli exploits the Sicilians' hopes, he also makes no promises. His crime is not the swindle, but his disrespect for his inadvertent role of confessor. He is imprisoned for violating trust and dishonoring the Sicilian people. Morelli's return to the mainland of Italy is a poignant, poetic, unifying and redemptive montage of Sicilian experience, national identity and humanity.
