Plot is simple(group of fellow  travelers are stranded at a-you know--OLD DARK HOUSE), but plot is not what  is important here.

688988,4,6303626475,"Let's present this movie as a test for the 2000 movie buff. If he can  stand THE OLD DARK HOUSE until its end without ejecting the DVD, he can  undoubtedly consider himself as a real movie lover. Why ? Because it takes  a lot of self-control not to laugh at the conventional plot involving a mad  butler, a chorus girl, a depressed Lord (hilarious Charles Laughton !) and  finally a schizophrenic * guess who he is ? * trapped in a labyrinthic  house during a stormy night. Once you've accepted the situation, you can  enjoy James Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE.
Not ONE single drop of blood in  the movie. Even if there a lot of knives waiting over the only table of the  main set for a mad murderer. The fact that THE OLD DARK HOUSE is a 1932  movie shot in black & white isn't an excuse. No, James Whale believes  in the power of shadows to suggest fear and also in the extraordinary  presence of Boris Karloff . The unforgettable Frankenstein's creature  mumbles a few words and that's it. A great make-up, a strange look and a  robotic way to walk are enough to create uneasiness in the audience.
One  can also have a great pleasure to rediscover such interesting actors as  Raymond Massey, Melvyn Douglas and Gloria Stuart in superb close-ups which  the restored version of THE OLD DARK HOUSE is offering you without too many  white spots. The sound is also very good, with just a little buzz annoying  your speakers. Extra-features at the best.
A DVD for the movie lover.",958003200,2,1474,4.473684210526316
688989,4,6303626475,This is one of the best of the old horror movies about some people getting stranded near an old house.  There are many great things showing the fear and insecurity of the dark.

688990,4,6303626475,"When I first saw this film in theatres in a recent revival of Universal Horror films, I was surprised, pleasantly.  It was one of the few films from that era that succeeded in getting me to jump in my seat, once.  I was  therefore excited when the DVD was released with all the wonderful extras.  However, there is something curious I've found on many Image DVD's, that  the sound level on this film is so low that I can only hear it at an  acceptable volume if I pump it through my stereo amplifier at maximum  volume.  (I never listen to music louder than level 3, and I have to pump  it up to level 10 to hear the dialogue on this DVD, and Mad Max, and  others.  Has anyone else had this problem?)",944784000,5,700,4.149253731343284

Boris Karloff is masterful as well as the mute servant who turns the tables on the guests literally.

689147,5,6303626475,"I grew up ONLY watching 'old' movies (B&W).
My friends would tease me, but, I know good and bad movies alot better than they.

I had never heard the term ""Old Dark House"" type movies; I believe it's a 'sub-genre' of old spooky house movies.

But, the TITLE was Old Dark House.

First, first, first......MELVYN DOUGLAS.

You might not think you know him....have you ever seen ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dreamhouse'?, the best friend, Jim, is Melvyn Douglas.

Also, I believe Melvyn Douglas appeared in some little movie with some adequate actress....oh what's the name?

NINOTCHKA....with.....GRETA GARBO.

For those not 40 years old.....this is the almost equivalent of Laurence Fishburn and Don Cheadle with Julia Roberts and Angelina Jolie.

I'm sorry for my digression.

The movie (and it's early 30's, 1932 IIRC) starts with Melvyn and a few others, driving in one of those winding roads that are in Middle Europe (and not ment for automobiles).

Thankfully, they come across a home/inn?

They go in, get to dry off. The 'butler' is played by BORIS KARLOFF. He's not like anything I'd seen him in.

I forget lots of parts; but, about halfway through the movie, we get another two misdirected travelers. The man is Charles Laughton. In the 30's, Charles Laughton would be Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Sydney Potier (do you follow).

I'm rambling.

BUY IT!!

689283,4,6303626475,"The Old Dark House(released Oct/32)stars,among others,Boris Karloff,Lilian Bond,Melvyn Douglas,Charles Laughton,Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart. This film just oozes atmosphere like few others you will ever see. It has a fantastic cast and was director Whale's second offering after his and Karloff's classic Frankenstein ,about a year earlier.
The story finds a lost trio in a car on a very dark and stormy night;the kind you wouldn't send a dog out in. Massey is driving,Stuart is the snapping passenger,and bringing up the back seat is a poop-disturbing Douglas. They eventually come upon a dark old mansion and seek shelter there. A deformed and dumb Karloff,the butler, answers the door and lets them in. They are met by a rather imperious host one Horace Fem,and soon after by his almost deaf and bossy sister. After the initial formalities are dispensed with, Stuart is accompanied to a room by the sister,to get out of her sopping wet clothes. The sister talks about the sins of former household members past and of other house secrets. She ends up scaring Stuart so much she runs back down to Douglas and Massey.
Soon the guests are invited to partake in some victuals. As they eat a knock is heard and two more guests arrive. It is Laughton and Bond,the former an aristocrat and the latter the chorus girl he supports. The two seem  not to have a care in the world as they  barge in on everyone and make themselves at home. However as they sit in on the meal ,they settle down and become more somber in tone and action. Douglas and Bond form a friendship and the two at one point steal away to the stables outside, where Douglas has a bottle of whiskey sitting in the car.
Meanwhile Horace is almost dared by his sister,to go fetch a double headed lamp which sits aloft a small table a couple of flights up. Horace is accompanied by Massey, but he(Horace) only can go so far as he is too scared. He eventually persuades Massey to do the deed alone. On the way up Massey hears a voice coming from a room. At the top he finds the lamp and it sits beside a door which has two steel locks on it. Down below Karloff,who has been drinking,starts to approach Stuart, in a not kindly fashion. She runs into Massey on the way down who ends up smashing the lamp over Karloffs head after a struggle between the two. Massey tells Stuart of the strange noise he heard and the two climb the stairs and open a door to find a 102 year old family patriarch lying in a bed. They talk to him and learn of yet more secrets. There is another member of the household living in a room above,the locked room Massey saw by the lamp. It is Saul,Horace`s brother, who would like nothing better than to get out and set the house aflame.
Back down stairs the five guests and Horace and his sister are suddenly confronted by an upset Karloff on the stairs,and behind him stands the mad brother Saul. As Karloff attacks, all the men but Douglas try to subdue him. At the sister`s urging they take him to the kitchen. The sister locks Stuart and Bond in one room and flees to hers, while Douglas and Saul are by themselves in the living room which is now locked. Saul asks Douglas not to leave him alone as he is afraid. He also claims Karloff beats him and he wants Douglas to take him away with him. It soon becomes apparent though that Saul is not all there and Douglas tries to talk him down,but to no avail. When Saul makes his move the two struggle,ending up on a landing above. The wooden railing gives way and the two fall hard to the floor below,as the group reunites back in the room. Karloff enters and finds Saul dead. Tears filling his eyes,he carries him up in his arms to his room. Bond,coddling the head of Douglas in her arms,thinking he is also dead ,suddenly detects a spark of life. She yells out ""he's alive""(mimicking the famous line from Frankenstein a year earlier, i.e. ""It's alive!"").
The next day dawns and Massey and Stuart leave to bring back help for Douglas who needs medical attention. A groggy Douglas proposes to Bond as Laughton,now alright with their relationship,looks on.
Before the films debut there was controversy(mostly studio driven)about what part Karloff would be playing in this film. There is an opening statement presented laying out the ""truth"".It also mentions,in error,of Karloff having portrayed the ""mechanical monster"" in Frankenstein. I like  Whale's direction here,as he opens the film in a humorous vein,then slowly brings us down and in to the spooky atmosphere of the house and its dysfunctional inhabitants. Laughton's appearance then mimics the opening,again to lift us out of this oppressive atmosphere temporarily,before lowering us back into it once more and for good. It is as if the house gets a breath of fresh air with each of its guests,sucks it all in,then exhales, turning the good into bad once more.
Technically the film is in the full screen version and is as clear as can be expected. As this print was made some time ago I would like to see a new remastering and/or print struck,as it could greatly improve the image. Included with this release,t/here is some nice commentary by actress Stuart,a photo gallery and an interview with director Curtis Harrington who was the guiding force to save and resurrect The Old Dark House from permanent oblivion. As you will learn a remake was done by Columbia pictures years later who bought the rights and had Universal suppress any release rights to their own film. Years go by and Harrington asks Universal about the film and wants to get a print of it. They look for it unsuccessfully twice but finally find it on the third try. The first reel is in bad shape, so it is Harrington who gets the legendary James Card of the Eastman House to fully fund and restore the film completely. Amazing. It makes you think of what other films we have lost due to studio neglect.
In conclusion,this is a film with atmosphere aplenty and one that will stay with you long after you see it. The cast is A-1, as is Whale's
direction. The film needs a new cleanup,but considering it almost was lost forever,I am just grateful to see it at all. As an aside,see how many former cast members from Frankenstein you can spot in this film. 4 1/2-5 stars.",1449878400,5,6228,4.609009009009009

689364,5,6303626475,"I've had this film in my collection for several years and, at least twice a year, I have to pull it down from the shelves, turn off the lights and watch it again. While today's jaded audiences (myself included) won't consider it scary, ""The Old Dark House"" is an enormously fun, splendidly atmospheric classic from Universal's Golden Age of Horror. James Whale's literate, intelligent direction and the witty, fast-paced script propel the solid cast through a dark and stormy night filled with romance and danger in a rambling old house in the Welsh countryside.

Based on J.B. Priestly's novel, ""Benighted"", ""The Old Dark House"" features Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart as a married couple who, along with bachelor Melvyn Douglas, seek shelter from a fierce storm at an isolated mansion. The occupants of the house--the Femms--are odd ducks whose various eccentricities and secrets are unveiled as the movie progresses. No sooner have the travelers ensconced themselves in the Femm's abode then another couple (played by Charles Laughton and Lilian Bond) shows up, and things quickly get out of hand, first with the Femm's mute and drunken brute of a butler, and then with some other family members that the Femm's have wisely kept out of sight.

At a brisk 71 minutes long, there is not a wasted moment in ""The Old Dark House""--Whale and his screenwriters move the action breezily from one scene to the next but, despite its short running time, the movie never shortchanges the viewer. The acting is topnotch, with standouts being Boris Karloff as Morgan, the menacing, inebriated, seriously horny butler; Charles Laughton, delightful as a gregariously bloviating millionaire; and Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Pretorius in ""Bride of Frankenstein"") spot on and hilarious as the prissy, hand-wringing (and appropriately named) Horace Femm. Gloria Stuart, who made James Cameron's ""Titanic"" at age 87, appears here to good avail in one of her earlier screen efforts; lanky, blonde and sexy, her character makes a splendid foil for Karloff's Morgan and his persistent, increasingly savage advances.

The DVD itself is not exactly pristine, but its restoration from an old print discovered in the 1960's in the Universal vaults is practically a miracle considering that it was once thought lost and had been unseen since it played in theaters. Happily, this little gem of a movie is once again available to new generations of movie lovers.",1436918400,4,2429,5.144303797468354

I would say the most interesting part of the entire movie are the interactions. This movie has great atmosphere as you can imagine with any Universal film. This movie being from the 30's is also probably one of the first of the haunted house genre. Still, this one is different than what I expected. This isn't the run of the mill haunted house movie.

This is a very stylish production, shot in glorious black and white, with an imposing set filled with menacing shadows.  Boris is suitably grim as the mute butler who turns brutish when he drinks too much.  The odds of him not drinking on this night of nights were miniscule.  Disaster is imminent, a sudden romance unlikely but it happens just the same.  The 102 year old father upstairs, Sir Roderick Femm, was played by a woman (Elspeth Dudgeon).

689566,5,6303626475,"Long thought to be a lost film, The Old Dark House was put back into release after the archival work of Curtis Harrington ( an important film director himself). Since it's re-discovery, it's been recognized as one of the finest of the early sound Universal horror films. Filmed right after his triumphal Frankenstein ( 1931), director James Whale was able to show the world what he could do by fusing comedy with horror. It wasn't successful in it's first release, but it's far superior to the 1961 William Castle remake (remarkable only for the Charles Adams credits). It was adapted from the Joseph Priestley novel Benighted ( reviewed on my other blog here).

One dark and stormy night,a group of travelers are stranded in the Welsh countryside at a sinster mansion. The door is opened by a mute butler named Morgan (Karloff). The travelers, two men and one woman, are soon greeted by the matriarch of the family, who owns the house, Rebecca Femm. She is accompanied by her strange brother, Horace Femm. Later the group is joined by another couple. As the evening grows, the visitors learn there are two more people in the house: Sir Roderick Femm, an invalid; and Saul Femm, whom no one wants to talk about.

As in the novel, most of the movie consists of the various characters sitting around talking. Whale is able to make these static scenes shine by using his actors, who would go on to other brilliant roles in cinema. Charles Laughton steals the show as the good-time noveau riche. The director even managed to keep some of his monologues from the book, where you learn about the pain his jocular exterior is hiding. The only character who didn't make the transition very well was Melvyn Douglas, who comes off as a playboy. In the book, he was still shell-shocked from WW1.

As this was an early sound movie, the medium shots work very well. It gives the actors plenty of time to deliver their lines while not having to lug the huge cameras behind them. There's no music score.

It was a real shock to realize the Gloria Stuart in The Old Dark House was the same Gloria Stuart who dropped the diamond in The Titanic. What a difference 65 years can make!

But the real scene stealer is Saul Femm, a character from the book who didn't have any lines in it. In the film version he's one of the creepiest madman imaginable. He makes his entrance slowly down the stairs and claims to have been imprisoned wrongly in the house. But a few minutes into his cry for mercy you quickly realize he's a full-blown lunatic. I don't think I've ever seen such a well-rounded pyromaniac.

Ernest Thesiger, who would go on to play Dr. Septimus Pretorius in Bride of Frankenstein (1935), is my favorite character. You soon learn he's on the run from the police and is hiding out in the house. We never do find out why he's wanted by the law. He plays the role with just the right amount of droll humor to keep it moving. To bad the didn't use the best line he had in the book:

`We'll play Truth,' said Penderel. `It's just the moment for it.'
  `So they have turned it into a game now, have they?' cried Mr. Femm, in his thin, bitter voice. `It was high time they did.

The movie didn't do too well when it was first released. Which is a shame because it's the best example I can find of Universal horror movies from the 1930's.",1376438400,2,3321,4.501661129568106
689567,5,6303626475,"I have watched this 7 times and have yet to tire of it!  Clearly, for me, it rates a 5 plus!

Other reviewers have given detailed descriptions of this movie, so I will limit my comments to the mysterious butler, Morgan (Karloff), a disfigured man who is not ""just"" the butler as the anxiety-prone Horace Femm says.  At no point in the movie does it come out and say just who Morgan is; however, there are clues.  The most telling clue comes from the self-righteous Rebecca Femm - she repeats the clue twice while she watches three men struggle to lock up Morgan in the kitchen.  Tie this clue together with what Morgan does in his last scene should tell you who he is. . . .

689649,5,6303626475,"THE OLD DARK HOUSE

All the elements are here:  a dark stormy night, a group of stranded travelers, and an old gothic house inhabited by an eccentric and slightly disturbed family.  Along with a top-notch cast, terrifying background, and some of the finest script writing ever to blaze the screen of horror, this is one of the greatest films to ever bless the genre.  The whole thing is a gem--from start to finish, and even after several viewings you will still find it highly engaging and original each time.

As simple as the plot is, it's a very fascinating story.  Three lost travelers are forced to find shelter for the night in a large country home that looks like some left over fortress from the dark ages.  Its occupiers are not far off from the dark ages, either.  The butler Morgan is a hulking ape-like half-mute. The man of the house--Horace--is an effeminate smart-aleck bug.  His stooped sister Rachel who runs the house de facto is a religious zealot constantly preaching the woes of youth and feminine allure.  More strangers arrive on the scene to add to the craziness, but it's not until Morgan begins empting gin bottles that the real trouble starts.

The house itself is filled with lots of dark shadows and mysteries.  The camera work is fantastic in working these elements to their best with lots of strange lighting to set the mood, and the house begins to seem alive itself.  The dining area is warm yet emptying, and everywhere the long shadows reflect sinister intentions.  Windows blow open, the wind howls mercilessly, and strange noises emanate from the attic.  The whole place reeks of danger.

Add to this the odd trio who run the house, and the mood becomes more eerie still.  Morgan obviously has ideas about the beautiful blonde, and Horace spews ominous words about something lurking in the upstairs of the house.
The acting in the film is simply too amazing to talk about in this short space.  Everyone is memorable, but in this circle of greats it is Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore as brother and sister who shine bright.  Their characters are so bizarre and deranged and their dialogue so twisted you love every minute they are on the screen.  Boris Karloff as Morgan is interesting, too.  Once more he plays a hulking giant of few words, but his performance composed of awkward movements, intense glares, and one sinister smile speak volumes.

As the night progresses the strangers all get to know each other and a peaceful comfort sets in.  But as Morgan gets drunk things turn ugly.  Things get pretty tense and in his inebriated condition Morgan decides it's time to introduce the thing in the attic to the party.  If you thought the party was fun before, just wait till you see who comes down the stairs and how that changes the coarse of the night for good!

There are too many elements in this movie to talk about in one small review.  The film it littered with lots of cool images and characters, and of coarse lots of classic James Whale humor to lighten the mood.  In fact, some of the most memorable scenes are the ones that will get the most laughs.  It's an intelligently made movie that somehow has faded into obscurity but if you want to see one of the most well rounded horror films produced, check it out.",1328054400,,3261,4.642233856893543

689738,5,6303626475,"""You revel in the joys of fleshly love, don't you?"" -- Rebecca Femm to the horrified, and quite lovely, Margaret Waverton

This wonderful curio from the early 1930's captures all that was best about the old spooky house genre. Director James Whale injected the film with dry, sardonic humor, a dash of romance, and enough thrills to keep audiences in their seats on a rainy night. A hybrid of America and England, it has an odd lineage, and was both successful and a flop all in one go. J.B. Priestley's 1927 novel, Benighted, was actually published in the United States under the title Whale kept for the film. The adaptation to the screen was credited to Benn Levy, but some input was given by R.C. Sherriff. The sophisticated repartee between the characters and the often black humor did not mesh with American audiences expecting perhaps, something closer to Frankenstein. Audiences in England embraced it, however, making it another big hit for the director.

As with many of these early 1930's films, one must view it themselves before dismissing or lauding its merits, either as entertainment, or art. Many films during this period which enjoyed a modicum of popularity prove not to hold up with the passage of time. Other films which may have disappeared quickly, have today attained legendary status. Also, many films often given little consideration by today's critics, which were popular with audiences during their initial release, prove quite charming and entertaining still, reenforcing the belief that critics are sorely out of touch with the public. In the case of The Old Dark House, it is the widely held view of classic film fans and critics that England got it right. Fun, humorous, and with a few creaky thrills, it is fabulous to watch it today. The dust on the story is palpable, but only adds a nostalgic charm for today's viewer. The cast includes screen greats, and soon to be greats, making for a delightful escape into another time and place for the moviegoer.

On a rainy road in Wales, a dashing former soldier with no means of support, and a married couple are forced to spend the night in a gloomy old mansion when their car is virtually washed into it during the storm. Gorgeous Gloria Stuart is most feminine as the scared wife of Philip Waverton, Margaret. Raymond Massey is her husband, and an agreeable Melvyn Douglas is already displaying the light charm which would carry him through decades of great films, as Roger Penderel.

Shelter is sought from the storm also by Charles Laughton. Laughton is businessman Sir William Porterhouse, and Lilian Bond is his platonic companion and ex-chorus girl, Gladys DuCane/Perkins. There to welcome all of the stranded travelers is a gibbering and virtually unrecognizable Boris Karloff as the butler, Morgan. Eva Moore, as Rebecca Femm, nearly drives every one of them mad with her misplaced fervor. Her droll and cowardly husband, Horace, portrayed in winning fashion by Ernest Thesiger, is hiding something as well.

To reveal more might ruin the surprises for those who haven't seen this delightful bit of spooky fun. An old mansion lit only by candles, a voice up the stairs, a dangerous butler, and the storm itself create the chills while Douglas and Bond provide the romance. If that isn't enough to warm you to this film, a frightened Gloria Stuart runs around in scantily clad elegance for nearly the entire film! All the players seem to have understood what they were making here, and it shows in their lively performances. A true early 1930's classic, this one is a must see, and perfect with a bowl of popcorn on a rainy night. Terrific fun!",1311379200,2,3632,4.880064829821718

689743,4,6303626475,"Universal's The Old Dark House, 1932, is a fun old film directed by Frankenstein director James Whale, along with the old favorites Karloff and Ernest Thesiger (from ""Bride"").

This trio is riding through the countryside in the pouring rain and a landslide cuts them off.  They have no choice but to go to an old, broken down house where live strange and broken down people.

Karloff has no lines here since he's dumb (has no voice) and a tough butler character.  Theisger takes the cake as one of the Femm's with his sister who is a cranky piece of work.  Karloff's part is minor.  Charles Laughton as the big man with the ""girlfriend"" was great comic relief.

And there were clearly gay themes towards the end -- Saul, Morgan and their insanity and their obvious affection can be offputting for some viewers.  Also the filming techniques were impressive:  Gloria Stuart's off-kilter look in the cracked mirror was reflective of madness and fear.  Wow!

The flow of characterization between actors is magical to see.  The building of suspense and fright as well and building of curiosity.  Who is locked up in the room upstairs?  Why?  Who is Saul?

The theatrical way the film is done, with the players each having their own idiosyncracies, as they stay overnight in a house of madmen, is fascinating to watch.  This film was originally thought lost until a print was found and restored in 1968.

A confrontation with a madman bent on destroying the house; a few close-calls and some pretty insane dialogue make for a fun, if a bit dated, film.

This film was remade in 1963, same title, by William Castle.

To say it holds up over time is an understatement. The servants are unfriendly, the uninvited guests are a handful, and it between is more stuff and nonsense that will probably get you addicted to these old classics- but you won't find another ""Old Dark House"". Just one example- after the threesome burst in uninvited the butler approaches a side table where there is a vase of flowers. ""My sister was just arranging these"", he says, and then chucks the whole lot into the fire. More inexplicable rudeness and campy, John Waters-esque nonsense ensues- with a wonderful Boris Karloff as a barely intelligible doorman (must have been a hoot for him to play a role like this!) This isn't the sort of wholesome, ""Blackbeard's Ghost"" type of shenanigans the whole family will love (though they probably will)- this is filled with innuendo (note the butler's name is ""Mr. Femme""- hahahah) that probably would never have made it past the Hayes Code folks, and thank god for it. But don't think this is just some ""Rocky Horror"" number with no thrills- it has some genuinely creepy moments, with a definite squeamishly fetishistic overtone.

689745,5,6303626475,"This movie, ""The Old Dark House,"" which I was so fortunate to find on ""Amazon.com, comes closer to perfection than any other movie I've ever seen, either at theaters or on TV.  It is impossible to overrate this absolute gem--a masterpiece destined to be an all-time classic, not only in its genre but overall and covering all categories.  This film is difficult to classify.  It is far more than a mere horror/suspense story; it also includes elements of mystery, psychology, humor and, not least, surprisingly touching, tender romance which is presented in an entirely original and unexpected manner.

Starring Boris Karloff in a vastly different role from the one with which he was for so many years stereotyped.  In this casting, one discovers the depth, sensitivity, and consummate skill of this man--a truly GREAT actor!  In addition, Charles Laughton, Melvyn Douglas, and several ""unknowns"" -- all gave superb performances.  The characters live and breathe for us; they do not seem to be acting but are REAL, in that their lines appear to come straight from the heart.

At its beginning, the plot moves innocuously forward; it amuses and beguiles as it leads the hapless audience toward sudden twists and turns, each of which immerses us subtly and progressively into a dark world of horror and tragedy.  We are unprepared for the shocks and blows that await us.  The ending is bizarre and leaves us dazed.

This is a powerful film that provokes, enlightens, stirs us to the depth of our souls.  There is in it so much food for thought.  It is a movie that will compel us to return to it over and over again, each time experiencing new emotions and finding more and more to contemplate.

The film is flawless in its plot, casting of characters, and direction (by James Whale).  It is a ""generous"" production, in that it leaves the audience feeling strangely fulfilled and edified, as would a traveler returning home from a long, eventful journey to a marvelous faraway land.",1287878400,,1980,4.86865671641791
689746,5,6303626475,"""You revel in the joys of fleshly love, don't you?"" -- Rebecca Femm to the horrified, and quite lovely, Margaret Waverton

This wonderful curio from the early 1930's captures all that was best about the old spooky house genre. Director James Whale injected the film with dry, sardonic humor, a dash of romance, and enough thrills to keep audiences in their seats on a rainy night. A hybrid of America and England, it has an odd lineage, and was both successful and a flop all in one go. J.B. Priestley's 1927 novel, Benighted, was actually published in the United States under the title Whale kept for the film. The adaptation to the screen was credited to Benn Levy, but some input was given by R.C. Sherriff. The sophisticated repartee between the characters and the often black humor did not mesh with American audiences expecting perhaps, something closer to Frankenstein. Audiences in England embraced it, however, making it another big hit for the director.

As with many of these early 1930's films, one must view it themselves before dismissing or lauding its merits, either as entertainment, or art. Many films during this period which enjoyed a modicum of popularity prove not to hold up with the passage of time. Other films which may have disappeared quickly, have today attained legendary status. Also, many films often given little consideration by today's critics, which were popular with audiences during their initial release, prove quite charming and entertaining still, reenforcing the belief that critics are sorely out of touch with the public. In the case of The Old Dark House, it is the widely held view of classic film fans and critics that England got it right. Fun, humorous, and with a few creaky thrills, it is fabulous to watch it today. The dust on the story is palpable, but only adds a nostalgic charm for today's viewer. The cast includes screen greats, and soon to be greats, making for a delightful escape into another time and place for the moviegoer.

On a rainy road in Wales, a dashing former soldier with no means of support, and a married couple are forced to spend the night in a gloomy old mansion when their car is virtually washed into it during the storm. Gorgeous Gloria Stuart is most feminine as the scared wife of Philip Waverton, Margaret. Raymond Massey is her husband, and an agreeable Melvyn Douglas is already displaying the light charm which would carry him through decades of great films, as Roger Penderel.

Shelter is sought from the storm also by Charles Laughton. Laughton is businessman Sir William Porterhouse, and Lilian Bond is his platonic companion and ex-chorus girl, Gladys DuCane/Perkins. There to welcome all of the stranded travelers is a gibbering and virtually unrecognizable Boris Karloff as the butler, Morgan. Eva Moore, as Rebecca Femm, nearly drives every one of them mad with her misplaced fervor. Her droll and cowardly husband, Horace, portrayed in winning fashion by Ernest Thesiger, is hiding something as well.

To reveal more might ruin the surprises for those who haven't seen this delightful bit of spooky fun. An old mansion lit only by candles, a voice up the stairs, a dangerous butler, and the storm itself create the chills while Douglas and Bond provide the romance. If that isn't enough to warm you to this film, a frightened Gloria Stuart runs around in scantily clad elegance for nearly the entire film! All the players seem to have understood what they were making here, and it shows in their lively performances. A true early 1930's classic, this one is a must see, and perfect with a bowl of popcorn on a rainy night. Terrific fun!",1278201600,,3632,4.880064829821718

689826,5,6303626475,"The Old Dark House is one of the best horror films I've seen from this era; the acting is wonderful and the casting couldn't have been done any better. The plot flows along very well so I was never bored; it's not so scary for our times but it did give me the shivers every so often and that's good--it still works! The cinematography and the choreography reflect good forethought; and the script is brilliant. In addition, the quality of the print is quite good.

When the action starts, we quickly meet stuck motorists Philip and Margaret Waverton (Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart respectively). They are traveling along with their friend Roger Penderel (Melvyn Douglas); but the roads are so bad and the avalanche behind them so scary that when they see a large old house along the road they decide to stop for the night and beg for shelter. It's not too long before that two more stranded motorists arrive unexpectedly at the old mansion--Sir William Porterhouse (Charles Laughton) and his friend Gladys Perkins (Lillian Bond); they too are seeking refuge from the intense storm outside with its thunder and lightning. Just like Philip, Margaret and Roger, William and Gladys want warmth, rest and shelter from the storm.

But rest, warmth and shelter are not what they're going to get. It starts when Margaret and Philip are met by the lunatic butler Morgan (Boris Karloff) who groans and mumbles a lot without ever actually saying a word in the entire film. Although they are not too happy to see Morgan--he's quite frightening for them to look at--they then get eerie greetings from Horace Femm (Ernest Thesiger) and his sister Rebecca (Eva Moore) who owns the house herself. Almost from the start, the scary, bizarre behavior of the Femms terrifies Margaret Waverton; and her husband Philip isn't exactly too comfortable, either. To make matters far worse, there's the dangerously drunk Morgan (he drinks heavily when it storms at night); and there are two more members of the Femm family who just might cause more trouble still! Margaret and Philip meet the 102 year old patriarch as well as Saul, the insane brother of Horace and Rebecca who would like nothing more than to set the entire house on fire--and then cause way more trouble than that!

The DVD comes with a few extras. I especially liked the interview with a man who, while he was a director at Universal Studios, made it his ""personal"" mission to locate and restore this classic early horror film; and it's great that he did that because this film is quite good. I also enjoyed the slideshow of drawings for how they wanted the sets to look before they began making this movie.

The Old Dark House was a fine vehicle for Boris Karloff and the other starring members of the cast; they all do an excellent job and that's grand. I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes classic horror movies; and fans of the actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections.",1260316800,,2956,4.733980582524272

After the success of, ""Frankenstein"", director Whale was pretty much given carte blanche to do whatever he wanted. He made this film. It is an interesting combination of ""spooky"" and ""funny"". Sir Ian McKellen, who played Whale in, ""Gods And Monsters""(see below), described it in an interview as ""camp"". A married couple(Massey and Stuart) and a cynical friend(Douglas) are caught in a hellacious storm and seek refuge in an old, dark house, inhabited by the weirdest assemblage of folks imaginable. The head of the household is Thesiger, who lives with his ""religious zealot"" sister(Moore) and two other relatives---one an old man who is bed-ridden in an upstairs room---the other, a pyromaniac brother who is kept in a locked room. Karloff plays a potentially homicidal butler with a taste for booze and pretty young girls. Another couple stranded by the storm soon turn up(Laughton and Bond); we learn that Bond is Laughton's ""kept woman"" and that no real affection exists between them. Laughton plays a loutish, wealthy, ""self-made man"" and turns in one of his typical ""scenery-chewing"" performances. With their arrival, the stage is set for all sorts of bizarre ""goings-on"". Karloff begins ogling Stuart, gets drunk, and starts trying to rape her; the ""firebug"" brother gets loose and starts trying to set everything in sight on fire; Thesiger and the sister run around wringing their hands and trying to get things under control; and, meanwhile, Douglas and Bond fall in love(Laughton seems not to care very much---other than grousing about the inconvenience of having to find another mistress). As screwy as all this may sound, this is actually a pretty good film. Whale creates an appropriately spooky atmosphere with lavish sets and a ""storm from hell"". All the actors turn in admirable performances(even Laughton's ""over the top"" performance is appropriate for his character). Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that things eventually turn out rather well and, as the film closes, the sun shines brightly!",1258243200,3,2197,5.316091954022989

The Old, Dark House offers all of these things and more.  Director Whale keeps one finger on the panic button and one on the laugh meter.  When it comes to horror/comedy, he masterfully goes both ways.

This is a bizarre tale of a trio (or threesome, if you prefer) that seek shelter in a secluded mansion during a horrendous storm.  This safe haven is old.  Plus dark.  And as soon as they step inside, they realize something evil is afoot.

Or is it just something eccentric?  This might be the nuthouse instead of the House of horrors.  The mute butler (Karloff) has a hideous scar and consequential fits of rage after a stiff drink (not to mention something stiff for stranded hot chicks).  There's the loony religious lady, the atheist, the 102-yr-old lady with the beard, the crazy pyro, and more.

It all adds up to a creepy night of fun, mystery, and melodrama.  Great performances, camera work, atmosphere--just a tremendous script and directing.  Classic horror you don't wanna miss...",1229644800,3,1191,4.746341463414634
689833,4,6303626475,"The Old Dark House for me is a tough review to write; while I enjoyed the movie I can't fully explain what it is I loved about this movie. While often lumped into the horror genre, The Old Dark House is actually an offbeat comedy with some touches of horror, but even the suspense scenes are often played with a bit of dark humor.

Several people are forced to take shelter in an old house during a severe rain storm with a creepy family and mute butler (played by Boris Karloff). All the elements for a horror classic are here, but instead it's more laughs than anything else. The Old Dark House is quite a strange little movie and even after all these years it still remains a very strange movie.

The screenplay written by Benn W. Levy was highly enjoyable and well written. While not the greatest script it serves its purpose and works quite well. The characters are a bit annoying and even a bit obnoxious, but yet they work well overall and are mostly likeable.

The Old Dark House was directed by James Whale who is probably best known for the classics Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. James Whale is one of the finest directors of his era and here he delivers one odd, but yet fun movie. The pacing never lags and there's always something happening to keep the viewer interested.

Ernest Thesiger as Horace and Eva Moore as his sister Rebecca are super creepy and weird and both deliver top notch performances. Any scene they have is golden and works well in a weird, creepy, but yet funny way. Even though Boris Karloff has top billing as the mute butler Morgan, truth is he isn't really given that much to do. Karloff was one of those rare actors who without any lines can deliver a performance of a lifetime. Karloff is in the movie early lurking around and being creepy, but he goes MIA until towards the end of the movie.

But when he returns that's where the horror and suspense moments kick in, but don't go in expecting a Karloff movie or you'll be slightly disappointed since this really isn't a Karloff movie. I can't really quite explain what it is about The Old Dark House I liked. It's not one of the best movies from it's time, but yet there is just something so wonderful here that it worked well for me.",1226966400,2,2234,4.452322738386308
689834,5,6303626475,"For the vintage black-and-white mystery-thriller film purist, this 1932 Universal Pictures flick has it all: brilliant casting, stormy night, spooky mansion, vulnerable travelers, crazy residents... what more could anyone ask for? Now, while this is a very old film the sound is pretty darn good and the print quality is much better than what I had expected.

THE STORY: During a raging thunderstorm, several travelers are forced to stop and seek refuge at the Femm Family Mansion due to road wash-outs and landslides. The Femms, all pretty aged (along with their domestic spore), are as wacky as they come. Horace is bug-eyed, skeleton-ish, paranoid, and terrified while his sister, Rebecca, is as venomous as a mamba and notably inhospitable (""NO BEDS! THEY CAN'T HAVE BEDS!"") -- but as it turns out, she's sort of the brains of the outfit. There's also Morgan the Butler (Karloff!), a depraved creature who becomes VERY dangerous to be around when he's drunk (which is most of the time). And, best of all, locked away upstairs is Saul, an ancient psychopathic, conniving, homicidal pyromaniac -- and sometimes he gets out!

The mixed gender travelers (portrayed in part by Raymond Massey and Charles Laughton) try to make the best of their situation by backing up to a blazing fireplace and filling their empty bellies over a meal of roast beef and potatoes, but the combination of the storm (which threatens to wash away the entire mansion!) and the depraved proclivities of the morbid and bizarre house residents take its toll before the night is over. The gothic ambiance of the venue serves to further generate lots of terror and thrills.

In private, Rebecca regales one of the jumpier female guests with a little story: ""They were all godless here. They used to bring their women here - brazen, lolling creatures in silks and satins. They filled the house with laughter and sin, laughter and sin. And if I ever went down among them, my own father and brothers - they would tell me to go away and pray, and I prayed - and left them with their lustful red and white women.""

The story is based upon a 1927 novel by J. B. Priestly, entitled ""Benighted,"" and Benn W. Levey developed the screenplay. The film was directed by James Whale (""Bride of Frankenstein,"" 1935) and the Producer was Carl Laemmle, Jr. (""The Invisible Man,"" 1933). While he was not credited, the (original music) filmscore was composed by David Broekman. The movie runs for 72 minutes and the aspect is full-frame.

If you're into the ""dark and stormy night"" thing and you savor older films, you've hit the jackpot with this one!

689937,4,6303626475,"The Old Dark House (James Whale, 1932)

James Whale, who'd just imprinted his name on the American consciousness with Frankenstein, returned the next year with another Karloff vehicle, The Old Dark House. These days, Karloff's participation is somewhat eclipsed by the fact that this was the first American film to feature the great Charles Laughton, who would win the Best Actor oscar for The Private Life of Henry VIII the next year, as well as the nature of Karloff's role (he never speaks, only mumbles and growls; according to Robert Osborne, Morgan, Karloff's character, was the inspiration for the Addam's Family butler Lurch).

The Old Dark House is a much lighter tale than Frankenstein, and Whale treats it more as a comedy of errors than a horror film (though this is not to suggest that it's not deadly serious at times). The plot concerns said old dark house and its inhabitants, who on the night of a storm are repeatedly plagued by travellers on the road below, which has washed out in a landslide, leaving them with nowhere else to go. To compound matters, Morgan (Karloff), the family butler, has a hatred of storms, and tends to drink heavily when there's thunder in the air. And when he gets drunk, he's not a happy camper. Adding to the weirdness is a locked and barred room on the fourth floor, and no one will tell the guests what's behind it...

Much of the enjoyment of watching The Old Dark House comes from its top-notch ensemble cast, which includes not only Karloff and Laughton, but also Melvyn Douglas, Lilian Bond, Eva Moore, Elspeth Dudgeon (in her first big-screen appearance), Gloria Stuart, Ernest Thesiger, and Raymond Massey. Put them all together and you get, as one critic put it, the most uncomfortable dinner scene ever committed to film. I plan to say ""Have a potato."" to all my in-laws this Thanksgiving, and none of them will get it.

For all that, it's not a very scary film, but then one has to wonder whether it was meant to be. There's some romance, a bit of swashbuckling, and, of course, the mad butler, but when the women go cowering into the cupboard when that locked door on the fourth floor is finally opened, how can the viewer look at the situation with anything but amusement by that time? That may, of course, have been Whale's intention all along. We'll never know. Just the fact that we're still able to see this film is pretty amazing, given that it was lost for so many years. *** ",1194825600,7,2443,4.658932714617169

The film is witty, surprising yet still ""Dark"" in nature.

It even has a little bit of ""gender bending"" -- not to be confused with homosexuality as one reviewer does. But the film soon casts its own spell and you're hooked on its terms. Have a potato! And some gin! Enjoy the ride.

In any case -- this is a minor masterpiece with some great performances. The Femm family are especially good and Charles Laughton is notable for what I think is his first Hollywood role.

The director is James Whale. He did Frankenstein before this then followed up with the incomparable Bride of Frankenstein, and a few other in between, like Invisible Man.

Absolutely as this is one of Whale's masterpieces using humor, some creepy imagery and a great cast (Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey, Gloria Stuart, Charles Laughton, Ernest Thesinger and other notable stage vets) to create a moody chiller with humor.

The extras include a thoughtful trivia filled commentary Gloria Stuart and a second commentary by Whale bigorapher and film historian James Curtis. Curtis Harrington provides a detailed introduction of how he became involved in saving the film, meeting Whale, etc. The video quality of this portion is so-so. The transfer of the film looks solid although it could use more digital cleaning up (like the recently reissued editions of ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula""). Although the film appears a bit unsteady in the beginning, it improves. I personally thought the contrast could have been improved a bit as well. Audio sounds good but the volume is a bit low and probably could stand a bit cleaning up to get rid of some hiss and popping.

The follow up to Whale and his star Boris Karloff's ""Frankenstein"", this witty, cynical horror film is well adapted by writer Ben Levy. Thought lost for years (the original film has been out of circulation for at least 44 years when William Castle made his weak remake), director Curtis Harrington found a copy of the film from which this version is drawn.

The film was almost lost when Universal sold the rights to Columbia in 1963. Luckily director Curtis Harrington (who befriended director Whale late in life)while working at Universal asked to have the negative pulled and duplicated. Otherwise the film would be lost as the firs reel of this classic was in pretty bad shape.

Overall this is a pretty good reissue of a classic Whale film that has been out of circulation for too long. It's a classic right up there with Whale's ""Waterloo Bridge"", ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", The Invisible Man"" and ""Frankenstein"" although closer in tone to ""Bride"" and ""Invisible"" than his straight horror films.",1170547200,6,2203,4.9620596205962055

689944,4,6303626475,"Old Dark House is an early thriller which draws audiences probably because of Boris Karloff's name but which has a great cast. The story goes that several people (including Melvyn Douglas, Gloria Stuart, and Charles Laughton) are driving around in the rain getting more and more lost as time goes by and risking more and more danger as they drive on the muddy ground. They stumble upon an old house with lights in the windows and venture in only to find a very strange family inside. There is a creepy butler (Karloff) who cannot speak except to mutter gibberish, a fanatically religious old woman, and a timid older man. The visitors begin to notice strange things in the house and become more and more frightened when they learn that the circumstances of the night are making the muddy muck outside a bit safer than staying cooped up inside.

The quality of the print I saw was less than great, but it was a cheap bootleg. I would assume that Kino's release has a much better print.

The film is greatly suspenseful because of how confusing it is. We never know, nor do the guests of the house, who is crazy and evil and who is good, so one is constantly on edge.

The cast is very good. Stuart is absolutely gorgeous in her slinky evening gown. Laughton is decent, though he does not have enough screen time to really shine like he normally does.

690018,5,6303626475,"James Whale's masterpiece may be the very finest of all the great Universal horror films of the early 30s, despite the absence of any of its famous stable of monsters. The film is basically an extended meditation on rot and decay--physical, moral, and genetic--, but the screenplay is so fast and funny and scary that you have little time for metaphysical speculation until it's all over. Two groups of travellers find shelter from the Mother of All Rainstorms in a great wreck of an aristocratic manor house in the Welsh one horrible night, and meet the house's occupants: a giant mute butler (Boris Karloff), who becomes violent when he's been drinking, and his masters: a dessicated prissy aristocrat Horace Femm (the brilliant Ernest Thesiger) and his fanatical sister Rebecca (Eva Moore), who refuses the travellers beds for the night. But there are more Femms hidden away in the house, and the film does a superb job allowing the wayfarers (and the viewer) to go further and further in to see the horrors hidden away. The level of acting in this film is unusually high for its period and  largely holds up today: of particular note besides Karloff, Thesiger and Moore are Lilian Bond as a goodtime girl, Charles Laughton as the Yorkshire millionaire keeping her, and Gloria Stuart as an intelligent beauty.",1141084800,8,1312,4.90990990990991
690019,5,6303626475,"Fans of ""Cold Comfort Farm"" by Stella Gibbons will recognize the same sort of humor in this movie: an eccentric rural family, religious mania, characters with Biblical names, etc. The 102-year old Femm family patriarch (played by a woman in a beard!) muttering about the family's dark secrets bears a resemblance to Aunt Ada Doom bedridden after she saw ""something nasty in the woodshed"". Interestingly, CCF was published the same year The Old Dark House was released, so who knows whether Gibbons was influenced by it.",1133308800,6,519,5.046511627906977
690020,4,6303626475,"The Old Dark House is directed by James Whale, which practically guarantees quirky cinema with flamboyant acting.

Definitely atmospheric in the old Universal Monster Movie way, this film was made not in Hollywood but in England.

Karloff has no spoken lines, as he plays a ""dumb"" butler with a penchant for drinking and, when drunk, the potential for being maniacal and murderous.

But there is plenty of dialog to go around - and it goes around quickly.  Lines are shot out so quickly by the actors, it's barely possible to keep up.

Very little of the action takes place outside the Old Dark House.  The visitors who must take refuge there because of a raging storm are welcomed (or are they?) by quite a queer and dysfunctional family, which seems to grow larger and larger (and more bizarre) as the movie goes on.

Other than the fact that the story is told to the audience via a motion picture, the story and the way it is told would certainly work as a stage play.  The dialog, the performances, and the large living space where all the characters interact all lend to the thought one is watching a filmed stage play.

The film, however, was most likely not commercial enough to enjoy widespread success when it was first presented to the viewing public.  The DVD should be purchased by Karloff or James Whale fans - or perhaps by those who enjoy atmospheric dramas that hint at evil doings and insanity.

Technically, the print used for the DVD is wonderful - much better than the print that was used for the VHS tape.

If you think you will enjoy (or do enjoy) this film, I highly recommend ""The Ghoul,"" also starring Boris Karloff.",1129939200,6,1641,4.601374570446735

690022,5,6303626475,"Director James Whale did not break stride after his brilliant 1931 classic ""Frankenstein"" with an almost as brilliant ""The Old Dark House"".

Two groups of travelers traversing the Welsh countryside in a torrential downpour seek refuge in an eerie, desolate and threatening mansion.

Raymond Massey and a stunning Gloria Stuart, who made her movie comeback as the aged Rose in ""Titanic"", playing husband and wife The Wavertons are joined by Melvyn Douglas as the first group of wayfarers.  Their relentless knocking at the front door is met by Boris Karloff playing the scarred, mute and mad butler Morgan.  The hosts of the mansion the peculiar brother and sister team the Horace and Rebecca Femm greet the wet and weary travelers.  The neurotic Horace played by Ernest Thesiger and the deaf Rebeccca played by Eva Moore commence revealing some chilling oddities surrounding their family. They are soon joined by a thickly accented Charles Laughton and his girlfriend Gladys played by Lilian Bond.

The group is subjected to a scary overnight stay as they wait out the passing of the storm.  Exploration of the upper floors of the mansion reveals the presence of the bed ridden 102 year old father of the Femms played by white whiskered actress(!)Elspeth Dudgeon.  She reveals that the mad oldest son Saul, a pyromaniac is locked in his room.  She fears that the drunken Karloff will release him to wreak havoc on the house and its visitors.

Whale using his horror flick regulars Karloff and Thesiger successfully creates a romantic yet anxiety laced flick using an effectively constructed setting to evoke feelings of dread.  The fine cast expertly captures the spirit with which Whale desired the film to be portrayed.",1119830400,,1721,5.045936395759718
690023,5,6303626475,"Not only is there an OLD DARK HOUSE, there's also a dark and stormy night outside said house, a heavy rain that causes mud slides and has turned the roads into quagmires.  It's so bad that travelers Roger Penderel (Melvyn Douglas) and Philip and Margaret Waverton (Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart) swallow their fears (how would YOU like it if your knock at the door of a scary old house was answered by Boris Karloff?) and seek refuge there. They are followed soon enough by portly and high-spirited Sir William Porterhouse (Charles Laughton) and fiery young Gladys DuCane (Lilian Bond).  Nobody in their right mind would consider spending a night in the spooky old place unless forced by the sharpest contingency.  Nobody in their right mind, we soon learn, inhabits the house, either. It's the residence of the Femm family, aged siblings Horace and Rebecca (Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore) and a brace of unseen, but not unheard, relatives locked in upper story rooms.  Boris Karloff plays Morgan, a butler or sib (never explained either way), who's scarier than all get out.
  THE OLD DARK HOUSE is a horror movie, of sorts.  It doesn't indulge in splatter-gore or supernatural head-twisting to shock and thrill.  Rather, it relies on high shadows and sardonic dialogue, strange characters and menacing situations.  The movie contains no character stranger than Karloff's Morgan, a hulking mute brute glowering from behind a bolshie beard and a few deep and delicately placed scars painted in by Universal make-up genius Jack Pierce.  Morgan develops an overarching attraction to pretty young Margaret Waverton.  Director James Whale makes Margaret undergo the only costume change in the film, a move that accomplishes a number of things.  Undressing down to her slip, Margaret is at once sexualized and made vulnerable.  It gives deaf old Rebecca Femm the opportunity to deliver lines at once darkly comic, sardonic, and deeply disturbing.  As Gloria Stuart, who recently played the 100-year-old survivor in TITANTIC, tells us on the easy and informal commentary track, Whale wanted her to appear a `flaming dagger' when Karloff chased her about the dark mansion, hence the pink Jean Harlow-ish silk gown.  Rebecca Femm, fondling the gown's silk, declares ""Fine stuff, but it'll rot.""  Touching the young woman's skin beneath the gown, she says ""Finer stuff still, but it'll rot, too!""  Whale intercuts the scene with images of Margaret and Rebecca and Margaret looking at herself in an old and distorting mirror.  It's a brilliant sequence, transcending and enhancing the horror simultaneously.
  THE OLD DARK HOUSE is filled with twisted, dark comedy and grand performances.  Whale, of course, had earlier directed Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN, and would work yet again with him in a few years on THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  Thesiger would join them as the demented Dr. Pretorius.  If you've seen that movie and enjoyed its singular brand of humor, you'll enjoy THE OLD DARK HOUSE as well.  HOUSE lacks BRIDE'S humanity, there are no noble monsters in this one, but its comedy is more finely honed and definitely of a darker hue.  And the ensemble cast is as good as it gets.  I loved this movie.
  Included on the Image dvd is Gloria Stuart's informal and personal commentary, a nine-minute stills gallery (button free, it runs on its own) and an eight minute interview with director Curtis Harrington, who was a friend of Whale's and the man most responsible for preserving, and restoring, THE OLD DARK HOUSE as it lay mouldering in the Universal vaults in the 1960s.",1114473600,140,3571,5.0374787052810905
690024,5,6303626475,"I bought the DVD edition of this film, here at Amazon, three or four years ago, a great buy by all means, and it's became a favourite film.

It seems that the film's rights were sold by Universal Pictures to Columbia Pictures, when they made an (inferior) remake in 1963, directed by William Castle (another favourite of mine). The copy I bought is the one issued by KINO-thanks a million to KINO.

""The Old Dark House"" is one of director James Whale's most offbeat films along with ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (IMHO his masterpiece). It's based on the J.B. Priestley novel and it was filmed during the Pre-Code Era.

I'd say it's a mixture of horror film, spoof and black comedy/humor...in some aspects it's related to ""Arsenic and Old Lace"", although it has a ""darker mood"". By the way, both Raymond Massey and Boris Karloff act in the film; Karloff played the role of Jonathan Brewster (from ""Arsenic and Old Lace"") on the Stage and Massey played it on-screen.

In a very stormy night, a group of travelers find shelter in an eerie and scary welsh manor, inhabited by the ""weird"" Femm family, and there begins a quick chain of events (the film lasts only 72 minutes) which last until the very end of the film.

The weary and wet travelers include Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart (who was nominated for an Oscar for her role of ""old"" Rose in the 1997 Blockbuster ""Titanic"" and looks ravishing in this film) as a married couple who are traveling through the country with happy-go-lucky friend Mr. Penderel, played by Melvyn Douglas.

Other travelers who arrive to this Huge House, are Charles Laughton, playing a rich businessman of humble origins with his lover, Lillian Bond, who's great and very sexy in her role of a joyous chorus-girl.

Then we have the Femms: Religion fanatic Rebecca Femm, who has an obsession with ""sinners"", expertly played by sinister-looking Eva Moore; her wishy-washy brother Horace Femm, played by the great Ernest Thesiger, who impersonated ""Dr. Pretorius"" in ""Bride of Frankenstein""; 102 years old Sir Roderick Femm, who is played by actress Elspeth Dudgeon, who's listed in the cast as ""John"" Dudgeon (creepy character!) and ""seemingly harmless"" psychopath and pyromaniac Saul Femm, played by Brember Wills.

Mention apart deserves Boris Karloff, who impersonates the scarred butler, Morgan, who lusts after Mrs. Waverton (Gloria Stuart), perhaps because she gets to wear a sexy 1930s low-cut dress, the type which used to wear Pre-Code Jean Harlow.

Horror fans, Pre-Codes film buffs, this one's for you.

The DVD edition includes two audio-commentaries by Gloria Stuart and by James Curtis (author of James Whale's Biography) and a short-filmed interview by Curtis Harrington, who tells us how he rescued this film from Universal's Vaults, from permanent oblivion and ultimate destruction.",1109462400,4,2822,5.0235546038543895
690025,5,6303626475,"In the 30's and 40's there arose a sub-genre of horror films that would be come to known as ""old dark house"" thrillers.  The plots of these films varied slightly but always involved a group of people gathering at a creepy old house or mansion.  Perhaps for a party or reading of a will and then strange things ensued in the house.

This film was not the first, but it became perhaps the definitive work.  Directed by James Whale who also directed Frankenstein and Bride of FRankenstein, whale would be reuited with his Frankenstein star, Boris Karloff.  This movie was thought to be long lost until a copy was found and restored in the late 1960's.

The story concerns 5 travellers who must take refuge in a creepy old Welsh estate when they are caught in a terrible storm.  The Guests include Phillip and Margaret Waverton (Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart) their travelling partner Roger Penderal (Melvyn Douglas) and Sir William and his friend Gladys Perkins (Charles Laughton and Lillian Bond).

The house is inhabited by a family that would make the Addam's family look normal by comparison.  There is the matriarch Rebecca Femm...a hell-fire and brimstone religious zealot with disdain for the female guests especially.  Then there is her brow-beaten, timid, prim and proper brother Horace (played deliciously by Ernest Thesiger).  Upstairs is their aging father sir Roderick...bed-ridden and living in fear.  Then there is whatever lies behind the locked and bolted door upstairs where Horace refuses to go.

Karloff gets top billing even though he has no dialog.  In one of make-up artist Jack Pierce's greatest works, Karloff is almost unrecognizable under a thich mat of black hair, thick black beared, and scarred face as the hulking, brute of a butler named Morgan.  Karloff merely grunts his way through the role and menaces Gloria Stuart at every turn.

The movie is thick with terror and threats as the storm deepens, the lights go out, and people begin disappearing at every turn.  Douglas and Laughton throw themselves into their roles and seem to be enjoying things at the expense of the rest.  Stuart does a great job as the threatened damsel and is quite beautiful although Massey is rather dull as her husband.

Whale gets in his usual bits of humor under the radar, such as when Gladys who travels with Sir William tells Penderal that William give her money but ""doesn't expect anything"" in return.  And that he want's people to think of him as being ""gay"".  And of course, laughton in real life was gay even though he was married to Elsa Lanchester.

The DVD is a good Transfer by Kino although the sound is a bit dim.  The DVD comes with two commentary tracks, one by surviving star gloria Stuart, who although in her 90's still vividly recalls the details of making the movie.

Highly recommended!",1104105600,3,2822,4.83125

The queer in-joke of the family Femm of the titular home.  The head of the Femm Family Roderick is played by actress Elspeth Dudgeon which is just the pinnacle of the queerness abound.  Boris Karloff's psychotic Morgan who is in a deadly attraction to Melyvn Douglas as Roger Penderel.  Their elaborate courtship is fraught with sexual tension with homicide as the only climax possible.  Ernest Thesiger chews the scenery shamelessly as the strange and effeminate Horace Femm.

690129,5,6303626475,"Director James Whale deftly combined dry, sardonic humor with classic horror elements to produce the richly entertaining black comedy ""The Old Dark House"".  By turns darkly witty and genuinely creepy, the film benefits from a razor-sharp script, moody cinematography, and uniformly fine performances in addition to Whale's creative directorial flourishes.  Simply summarized, the plot involves a group of stranded travelers who take refuge in an isolated Welsh mansion owned by a dangerously eccentric family during a terrific storm; before the night passes, members of the group will encounter terror, romance and even death as the thunder, wind and rain rage outside.

Among a distinguished cast that includes such luminaries as Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, and Gloria Stuart, the acting honors are stolen by Ernest Thesiger playing the pinch-faced, hollow-eyed lord of the manor.  Thesiger manages the difficult task of being very funny and vaguely menacing at the same time; in his first scene he introduces himself in a sepulchral but prissy tone as, ""Femm ... Horace Femm"", and the effect is both marvelously silly and discomfortingly shivery.  Eva Moore also makes a distinctive impression in the role of Thesiger's sharp-tongued sister whose begrudging hospitality to her guests does not include ""beds ... they can't have beds!""  She is particularly ominous as she fingers the fabric of Gloria Stuart's low cut evening gown, noting ""fine stuff, but it'll rot"", and then proceeds to put her hand on the exposed flesh above Stuart's chest, adding ""finer stuff still, but it'll rot too!""

The Kino DVD offers a beautiful video transfer of this film which was once considered lost.  After the film's negative was discovered moldering in a vault, and then painstakingly restored, a copy was shown a very few times on pay cable TV channels back in the early 1990's; unfortunately, that print was so dark that the movie was virtually unwatchable.  The Kino version features correctly balanced contrast and a clearer, crisper soundtrack.  As far as extras go, there is a wonderful photo gallery; excerpts of an interview with Curtis Harrington, a long-time acquaintance of James Whale who initiated the long search for the film's missing negative; and a commentary by film historian James Curtis.  Best of all is a second audio commentary by actress Gloria Stuart who with great intelligence and charm reveals fascinating tidbits about the film's production, the other cast members, and the shooting of individual scenes, as well as general stories about Hollywood and her own career.

The 1962 Hammer remake of the same title, directed by William Castle, bears very few similarities with Whale's production; Castle's version is almost devoid of horror and emphasizes broad comedy which sometimes veers into the realm of slapstick.  Both are entertaining films in their own ways, but I personally prefer Whale's original and heartily recommend that you add it to your home DVD library.",1095206400,65,3005,5.28781512605042

Old Dark House never had the airplay that the other classic universal monster films enjoyed, this was actually my first time seeing it.  Despite its eclectic cast of horror film luminaries including Karloff, Charles Laughton, and the inimitable Ernest Thesiger, the movie drags a bit without a clear-cut antagonist.  However, the mood and atmosphere is classic gothic horror hearkening back to Poe's `Fall of the House of Usher' and it's easy to see the clichs that numerous other films borrowed from down the line all the way to Texas Chainsaw.  Rain drenched travelers arrive at night where they're greeted at a run down mansion by a mute and deformed manservant.  In short order they meet the brother and sister owners, their parent, and finally most dangerous sibling.  Everything in the house is decaying and breaking down, and Thesiger as the highly strung brother steals the show with his drier than dust humour.  Modern audiences will chuckle at the saccharine love story that develops in an evening, but one can't deny that this was a fine example of the genre back in 1932 and probably scared the wadding out of folks.

Those who don't like their wit dry need not apply, but those who do are in for a real treat. Charles Laughton's blustering but good natured Yorkshireman channels more than a pinch of George Formby, but it's Ernest Thesiger who steals the show even more wholeheartedly than he did in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN - never has one man got so much comic mileage with so little visible effort from the words ""Have a potato."" Forget Dr. Pretorius, this is the absolutely unique Thesiger's finest hour. There are plenty of good lines to go round the rest of the tremendous cast (""Not even Welsh should sound like that,"" notes Melvyn Douglas when confronted with Karloff's grunting), the characters are really rather likeable for a change, and even the wildly unconvincing casting of an actress to play the family patriarch does not detract.

Also in the family is their ancient bedbound father---an androgynous 102 yr.old crumbling creature (played by actress Elspeth Dudgeon--billed as ""John"") who knows the family's decadent secrets. Kept locked away upstairs is the wild pyromaniac brother Saul, tended to by the facially disfigured butler Morgan (Boris Karloff) who is mute and a vicious drunk. They all reside in an old dark house, off the beaten path in the English mountains. One dark and stormy night, two sets of travelers are stranded by a landslide on the doorstep of this maniacal abode. And thus begins an unforgettable night of terror. No electricity, howling winds, pounding rain, lightning and a family of grotesques so weird only a writer could have made them up beset our travelers with primitive (and deadly) hospitality. Brilliantly directed by James Whale, the film is a rare treasure of the old Universal 30's horror films. Bizarre, grim and laced with black humor throughout, ""House"" features Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Lillian Bond, Raymond Massey and Gloria (""Titanic"") Stuart as the rain-soaked travelers who find themselves at the mercy of the psychotic Femms.

One could see in Boris Karloff's character of Morgan (one that he was reluctant to play because) a Frankenstein monster, particularly since, again, he cannot speak and produces a mumbling sound. His part add some meanace to the story.

James Whale meant this film to be  dark comedy with an old broken down house as the center of the action inhabited by people who resemble gargoyles as opposed to the people who are forced to take shelter.  The cast is simply wonderful: Ernest Thesinger (an old friend of Whales'), Eva Moore (as his domineering sister), Raymond Massey, Melvin Douglas, Gloria Stuart (better known for Titanic)and Elspeth Dudgeon as the 102-year old father of the Fleem household.

690138,4,6303626475,"Tales about sinister, creepy mansions were already cliched by the time director James Whale directed THE OLD DARK HOUSE--and instead of presenting the piece as a straight-forward thriller he mixed the film's very atmospheric cinematography with a wild strain of parody.  The result is a movie with a bizarre camp humor that foreshadows Whale's slightly later and even more bizarrely camp THE BRIDE OF FRANKESTEIN.  The plot, based loosely on a J.B. Priestly novel, is perfunctory, existingly only to throw together an ensemble cast of already-famous and soon-to-be-famous stars.  Five motorists are trapped in the wilds of Wales during a horrific storm and are forced to seek shelter at, of course, an old dark house... but their unwilling hosts are a neurotic Ernest Thesiger, his religious fanatic sister Eva Moore, and their hulking, deformed, and mute butler Boris Karloff.  Before the night is over the storm-weary travelers experience everything from a hellish meal to religious lectures--not to mention assault, attempted rape, mysterious cackling, a bit of arson, and a touch of homosexual hysteria (courtesy of Thesiger, Moore, and a surprise male character who is actually played by a woman) thrown in for good measure.
The cast is exceptional; in addition to Karloff, Thesiger, and Moore, we have Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey, Charles Laughton, Gloria Stuart, and Lilian Bond, and they wring the most from the covertly wicked script, with Eva Moore ranting about ""laughter and sin,"" Thesiger inviting Raymond Massey into his room ""to see a few things,"" and one of the most socially awkward meals ever put to film.  But the film's real power is its cinematography: when they say old DARK house, they really mean it, and the look of the film is just as disorienting for viewers as for the characters; particularly noteworthy is the scene in which Moore lectures Gloria Stuart, with their faces distorted by the bedroom mirror, and the sequence in which Karloff pursues the white-clad and wind-whipped Gloria Stuart with mayhem in mind. Viewers who expect ""Universial Horror"" fare will probably be disappointed by THE OLD DARK HOUSE, and director James Whale would create a still more memorable combination of horror and high-camp with THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN.  But THE OLD DARK HOUSE is an overlooked jewel of unusual quality: a sardonic parody of a famous theme, well played, filmed and scripted.  Recommended.",1016150400,5,2424,5.2

The film depends on two major elements for its appeal.  On the one hand, a carefully cultivated and sustained atmosphere, and in this Whale is amazingly successful.  From the movie's first moments, when an early 1930s automobile--sans side windows!--lurches and lunges through a torrential downpour, to the climax of the film, Whale is masterful in sustaining the mood of the film.
The second element is a magnificently balanced ensemble cast.  This is a film with no ""star"".  Instead, a number of strong characters balance one another.  Ernest Thesiger, Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey, the incredibly beautiful Lillian Bond, Boris Karloff, all round out a superb cast.  I should add that I found Charles Laughton somewhat disappointing.  As perhaps the finest ""ham"" actor in the history of film, I expected something a little more interesting out of him.  He usually manages to take over a film like this one, but instead is merely another adornment.
All in all, a fabulously entertaining film.  Perhaps not as well known as some of Whale's other films, but certainly every bit as excellent.",1014422400,,1327,5.073732718894009
690270,5,6303626475,"Some might say this is not horror, but viewing the film and every aspect of it, this is horror! It's ashame this film didn't get the recognition it truly deserves. Jame Whales made a great film. It is about a couple, with others don't think it's a good idea to drive much ahead being caught in the middle of a terrible storm. So they think going in a house like that is a better idea, hehe good move! In this house could be some of creepyest people in a horror movie, especially the one locked up in the room! Please get this movie, it would have been a lost film!",1010966400,,564,4.136363636363637
690271,5,6303626475,"Based upon the novel BENIGHTED by J.B. Priestly, THE OLD DARK HOUSE characteristically begins in the midst of a raging thunderstorm as a lone automobile, lost in the Welsh mountains, tries to make its way through the primitive dirt roads.  Inside are a bickering, nerve-wracked young couple, Philip and Margaret Waverton (Raymond Massey and Gloria (TITANIC) Stuart) and their war-disillusioned friend, Roger Penderel (Melvyn Douglas).  Deciding it is too dangerous to continue, the trio arrive at an imposing stone house, the only shelter in sight......................A thoroughly delightful diversion in the comic/horror genre, this film is a largely (and unjustly) forgotten gem.  The movie is perhaps an acquired taste, but its a film that grows in stature with each viewing.  This classic flick from the depressed year of 1932 boasts a gallery of memorable performances, even though Laughton is a bit overripe even by his standards!  Ernest Thesiger steals the film as the sniffish, craven Horace Femm; he is nothing short of the ideal materialistion of the Priestly character.  As Morgan, Karloff makes a surprisingly brief appearance, and, wisely, there was no attempt to beef up his rather uninteresting stock brute character.  Raymond Massey is merely competent as Waverton, while the great Melvyn Douglas does good work in his role as the acerbic, world-weary Roger Penderel.  For the role of Sir Roderick, the ancient partriarch of the Femm clan, Whale took a gamble by casting a veteran British stage actress, Elspeth Dudgeon (her name was changed to John in the credits!); the gamble was victorious.  Unbelievably, Elspeth made her last film in 1949!........ The film's wit is so dry and so gently self-mocking, that a casual viewer might easily laugh the dialogue off as being ridiculous; this input was courtesy of screenwriter Benn W. Levy.",1005782400,14,1856,5.285714285714286
690272,4,6303626475,"Though James Whale is better know for directing FRANKENSTEIN and THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, genre fans who appreciate his work on those films will probably enjoy THE OLD DARK HOUSE. In a way, its best to think of THE OLD DARK HOUSE as Whale's dry run for THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, as it contains many of the elements that made the latter such a success: a dark, gothic set; macabre humor juxtaposed with genuine creepiness; and great performances from Boris Karloff and Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Pretorious in BRIDE).
The story involves a group of travellers who are forced by inclement weather to spend the night in--you guessed it--an old, dark house, the rightful inhabitants of which are eccentrically bizarre beyond description.  (Thesiger portrays the acting patriarch of this peculiar family, while Karloff plays their brutish butler.)  Though the plot may sound cliche now, it was the first of its kind in 1932, making it the standard by which all to follow should be compared. (Genre fans will probably agree that most of its imitators fall short of achieving the same level of quirkiness and creepiness.)  Even in this day of cinematic carnage and graphic gore, THE OLD DARK HOUSE can stir up both genuine laughs and equally authentic chills.
A must-see for fans of Whale's genre flicks or any fan of classic horror.",1001548800,11,1322,4.9192825112107625
690273,5,6303626475,"This 1932 James Whale classic is just perfect for a pitch-dark stormy night's entertainment. All the elements are here for a great scary flick: You've got a stormy night, several stranded travellers, flickering lights, howling winds, an assortment of unorthodox [let's face it, weird] characters, and of course ""The Old Dark House""!  The only thing that could cap it off might be Chris Lee and Vincent Price.  Although those two horror legends are not really needed here. This standout cast does just fine on its own. I especially enjoyed Ernest Thesiger's performance as the timid and creepy [yet quite sensitive] Mr. Femm.  This film has withstood the test of time. It still holds up very well in the 21st century. Great fun no matter how many times you've seen it.",996796800,,767,4.884615384615385

690275,5,6303626475,"Haunted houses don't normally exist with heavenly hosts who can be accurately described as peculiar, whimsical, eccentric, and strangely charming.  A dark stormy night is the catalyst as weary travelers arrive and enter the mysterious old mansion hoping to avoid the lesser of two evils (being stranded in a car stuck in the mud on an unpaved country road).  Despite the looming threat of unimaginable horror, the movie remains essentially passive.  It turns out to be quite an intelligent collection of unconventional characters who combine to assure a ""5-star"" rating for this quirky, comedic melodrama.  A highly unique and creepy spook house atmosphere is enhanced by a sinister and downright nasty lady of the house.  But it's all in good fun, and the acting is brilliant (Gloria Stewart is my personal faviorite but the entire cast is great!).  DVD quality is very good here, especially considering this 1932 production was almost lost forever (more details provided in the special DVD ""extras"").",970099200,14,1002,5.192546583850931
690276,1,6303626475,"All reviews (including this one) can be wrong. I relied on reviews from  all sources to decide to buy this DVD.
The feeble attempt to link the  quality of the original ""Frankenstein"" to this film via a  graphics screen between the titles and the film itself says it all: no one  saw it.
The print is often inadequate. The script puerile. The plot short  and shoddy except for atmospheric changes which may be mistaken for bad  image treatment.
Without Karloff (who's wasted as a drunk) and the recent  release of James Whale's autopix 'Gods and Monsters' no one would care any  more about this film than they would George W. Bush without his father's  presidency.
Melvyn Douglas' performance is the DVD's one saving grace.  Why Melvyn?
Film restoration is priceless. Given the content, so is this  DVD.",968716800,7,802,4.781021897810219
690277,4,6303626475,"Although I am one of Amazon's best customers, I'm sure, I came here simply to give my thoughts on this movie, since I was rather ""bowled over by it,"" and I'm VERY critical.  I am an absolute devotee to this old  cultesque genre of films.  Give me a stormy night, lots of screams, new  corpses (and/or old), secret panels and passages, and such, and no REAL  violence, and I have something though occasionally chilling just highly  entertaining.  Pure entertainment without what we see too often in  present-day films.  I am a scholar of live drama and cinema and can only  say this is perhaps, of all I've seen, the best in this genre an all  accounts:  writing, acting, directing, photography--name it.  If you have a  love for these often trite movies, you'll find this one to be  extraordinary.  I only gave it a four-star rating, since a better film may  (doubtfully) come along--but would it be in the wonderfully stark  black-and-white, which adds so much to the effect?  This is an all-time  classic with all the finest elements and techniques.  Buy it.  Now.  It may  not be available long.",964569600,5,1098,4.6878306878306875
690278,4,6303626475,"Out of the four classic 'horror' films James Whale directed for Universal ('Frankenstein', 'The Invisble Man', and 'Bride of Frankenstein' being the others) this movie is certainly the odd one out. There are no monsters and  no mad scientists, just a collection of extremely strange characters. For  once Boris Karloff is upstaged not by one, but two of his fellow cast  members. Ernest Thesiger gives a wonderfully weird performance throughout  and larger than life Charles Laughton dominates every scene he appears in.  Because of the lack of any 'monster' and the fact that virtually the whole  film takes place inside the house, it is the dialogue and characters that  make this film so truly memorable. If you've heard that 'The Old Dark  House' was a 'lost' film then you needn't worry about picture or sound  quality. The film's restoration work has produced a very good quality  print. Unusually for me, I watched this film 3 or 4 times within a week of  receiving it, not least because of the great commentaries provided by James  Curtis and especially Gloria Stuart. 'The Old Dark House' certainly demands  multiple viewings, which is the best praise I can  give it.",961891200,47,1176,4.933673469387755

""The Old Dark House"" (1932) is a terrific film, set in the ever popular haunted house on a dark, spooky rainy night. Horace and Rebecca Femm, brother and sister, are the owners of a drab mansion. However, they definitely do not play the good natured hosts when stranded travellers are forced to stay there because of the terrible storm. Ernest Thesiger gave a terrific performance as the pessimistic Horace Femm, who constantly worries about the worst that could happen. Fans of Charles Laughton might be surprised to see him playing an arrogant loud mouth that only believes in making money in order to ""smash people"". Frightening as ever, Boris Karloff gives a tense portrayal of Morgan, the frequently inebriated butler who is described by the Femm family as ""an uncivilized brute"" and ""a savage"". Like most horror films of this era, ""The Old Dark House"" has a devious surprise appearance of something which is only slightly hinted at during the film, and finally comes out in the open towards the end. I thought this film was very well written and performed, quite unlike the scary films of today that spend more money for the gore.",1485820800,12,1244,4.817757009345795
