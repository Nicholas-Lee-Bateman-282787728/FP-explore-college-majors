8166285,5,B0002S9QR8,"The first DVD is much better than the new edition DVD Dieux du Stade, best photography, best scenes, I really think you're watching Rugby players and not boring models. Until the 2007 it seemed to me a good job. You really think you're in the locker room of young athletes, including some frontal nudity, as occurs in reality when someone out of the shower in the gym.

8166286,5,B0002S9QR8,"Recipe for pleasure: Take 46 gorgeous rugby men, shed their inhibitions, position accordingly & then just shoot, you get the official French Rugby Calendar 2004, in all its glory. How do you top that? Release the DVD - In the making, 'Dievx Dv Stade ' - the Gods of the Stadium. The name says it all. Every girls dream & every gay man's fantasy. Leave it to the French to do everything with a touch of class. Shot casually in black & white, it is both artistic and exotic, the camera angles leave little to the imagination. It succeeds in walking that thin line, leaving the viewer eager for more, yet curiously satisfied - a momentary sense of bliss. If ever there were a film made that epitomizes male beauty without the pretenses, in its pure undiluted state, this would be it. Going beyond the male body, it captures a variety of human emotions with a rare mix of raw innocence & sexuality.
Whether its a quiet night of viewing pleasure, a gathering of friends or a tasteful backdrop for a martini party of sorts, this DVD is a well worth addition to a collection. Definitely not for everyone, it's a treasure for any admirer of the male form in all its glory.
