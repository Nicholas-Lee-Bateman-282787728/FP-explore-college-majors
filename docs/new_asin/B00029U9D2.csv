8024926,5,B00029U9D2,"Wow. I have loved the x-files since it first premired. i watched it as a little kid, and i still live it. X-Files is arguably the best cult classic television series of all time, with the characters of Mulder and Scully still influencing today's programing. When i found out that the first eight seasons were on sale together for such a cheap price, i was overwhelmed. Now i just need some way to get the 200-some odd dollars to buy them, which is not much when you see each season as eighty dollars most places. Definately worth the buy if you can afford it.",1161302400,,559,4.384615384615385
8024927,3,B00029U9D2,"I've never watched THE X-FILES barely when it was on back in 1993 year and 2002. The movie, ""THE X-FILES"" (Most notablly titled ""THE X-FILES - FIGHT THE FUTURE"") is what realy got me into watching the series when I was much older. I watched little bits and pieces of the show during 2003/2004 (seasons 1 through 9 respectively), and really got the jest of it in all reality, though the plotlines or non-conspircies were lost on me cause I could never catch the show on SCI-FI in order. I'm not educated in the happenings around THE X-FILES outside the show itself (I.E. David D. asking for more money and wanting to leave the show early on, Moving from Canada to LA (who would want to? LA's a wasteland in all honesty. Less trees there than there is in New York. It resembles Los Vagas in all reality), Gillian wanting to leave as well, etc.) or the gossip that would circulate in magazines and newspapers. But I do know, from what I saw, TXF was slowly decling down in the realms of Boredom and JUMP THE SHARK-NESS much like ER did when they killed off or got rid of all the actual actors and interesting characters on their show, the last ones being Susan Liews and John Carter (Dr. Pratt is probably the last of the remaining good actors/characters on the show that are interesting. Who cares about Luka Kovac or Kerry Weaver). Getting back on subject, it can be said THE X-FILES ""Jumped the shark"" in several of the newer seasons during late 2000 after season 7, the departure of Mulder as the main character. Also when Mulder got abducted by the very aliens he was searching for. If he had not found about his sister beforehand and if this episode had been the series finale it would've ended with a very X-FILES-ISH ending: Things left undone, the truth never found out, and the Mulder/Scully romance would've never blossomed.

Because if Mulder didn't find out about his sister, I think he would've been more than too eager to get beamed up to their spaceship just to find her. I seriously didn't like when they made Scully pregnant with MULDER's CHILD! I was sickened by the very thought of Mulder and Scully being together because it just reminded me of a blood-related brother and sister becoming romantically invovled with eachother (sorta how I felt with the Sam/Jack relationship in SG-1, Stargate). I know rabid fangirls/fanboys of the fanfiction realm and beyond were hooting with cheers but that just made me queezy --- how'd they get Mulder's Sperm into Scully anyway? On second thought I don't wanna know. The humorous episodes didn't fit with the Mysterious/Horror/sci-fi atmopshere of the series, the actors exlcuding new ones, did look a bit bored with their roles(Buffy - ANGEL - XNEA - STARGATE - MACGYVER - SMALLVILLE, are prime examples) as Angents constantly bickering about logical boundries and paranormals. The show did slip for me completely when AD Skinner because paraoid beyond belief when he saw Mulder abducted. The arrival of the blonde ""MULDER/X-FILES FANATIC"" rookie FBI agent along with Agent Doggett (who seems confused about everything that goes on around him, barely mocking Scully's former ""disblief"" status) and Agent Reyes didn't help either.

The only saving grace of Season Nine was ""Nothing important happened today 1/2"" due to Lucy Lawless' appearance in the episodes, but even her character and talent seemed poorly utilized throughout the episode (I'm a die hard Lucy Lawless fan, so you know I was po'ed). All she did was walk around with her trademark ""Xena-brooding"" expression and proclaim that she was the first breed of supersoldiers, and an answer to the abnormality in Scully's baby. Scully becoming the sudden believer in the paranormal only after Mulder leaves was pretty off beat. The slight appearances of Mulder sitting at his desk looking bored with his work being reopened and closed, reopen and closed, appearing at scenes were paranormal activites took place and then never seen again throughout the episode after the credits was also off kilter. I didn't like the fact that the entire show becoming about ""SCULLY, DOGETT, & REYES"" trying to find out what was wrong with Baby-William instead of ""MULDER & SCULLY"" following one of Mulder's ""non-exsistent"" legends, UFOs and the overall ""Truths"" while Scully tried to get Mulder to believe otherwise.

The entire show was built around Mulder's belief in the paranormal, Scully's doubt. Take that away and you've got nothing left but a melodrama based around Scully's problems. Another oddity is when Scully would constantly remind Dogett that ""they were looking for Mulder"" but in reality, Mulder was easily forgotten and the two of them chased around one of his paranormals. Scully becoming pregnant and all the ""bad guys"" wanting to get their hands this unborn child for their hidden agenda, --which seemed to be the latest fad in drama-tv ever since Xena did it in season 5--, was also jump the shark material. She became this week woman complaining about morning sickness and deined the fact that her babay wasn't normal until season nine (when MULDER LEFT).

Dogett and Reyes never really seemed to do anything besides fuss over Scully's condition before and after, complaing about Mulder like he was a babiesdaddy son of a creep, and stand around scratching their heads after chasing the perp whom they scared off with their ""FBI, FREEZE!"" trademarks. It can also be noted that the ""paranormal"" and ""the truth"" became a low factoid when they arrived as well. It was more about government comspircies, putting alien babies in unsuspecting woman, than the PARANORMAL and ""the truth."" Mulder's return was also a stab to the heart of the show that suffered from his disappearance. Daid D. seemed to try not to yawn throughout every line he had, the chemistry between him and Anderson had fizzled out much like the Spice Girls chemistry when Jerry spice left and their final CD (which seemed to sing about only getting guys into their pants and rooms) failed in sales. Both actors seemed out of it, espically when they kissed in the season 8 finale. The so called ""sexual tension and Romancatic atimosphere"" wasn't there. It was more or less like the actors were saying ""Okay man, let's get this over with."" Also the loss of the Smoking Man, Well Manicured man, Mr. X, and all those other men that no actual name was a loss to the show since they practically started all the mess with the Aliens being on earth. For me X-Files will always be one of shows that suffered from bad writting in later seasons but a good run on TV during the 1990s overall when America wasn't numbed by hordes of ""unorignality"" coming in forms of American Drama provided by NBC, FOX, ABC, and THE WB Nights. ---- [A 3 out of 5]",1133654400,,6721,4.8164502164502165
8024928,5,B00029U9D2,"There are no words good enough to qualify this enormous enterprise. I just finished a marathon, spending several weeks watching the whole series. I was in awe and have only words of admiration for such a talented cast, such brilliant writers, producers, technicians, etc. All, with no exceptions, are superb.

Any good criticism would be useless without low points. Oh, yes, some chapters are failures, notably the one where they pretend to be ""Bad Boys,"" like the TV show. That one was a dog, but it was also exciting. You figure.

I wish they would have incorporated some of the deleted scenes, instead of offering that lame ""we loved it, but we had to cut it."" Well, splice it back on. They probably thought they had to be consistent, and so on. Whatever.

I wish they had edited out the series logo after the beginning of each chapter. Again, the integrity of the series prevailed. Besides, all you have to do is press the skip button on your remote.

And that should be all my low points. Nothing, really. Against that, we have the best, the greates TV series in the history of TV. There will never be a better one. The reason? Very simple: this series opens your mind, brings new ideas into your brain and erases, at least partially, the brainwashing you have suffered for years and years.

I should also mention that nobody smokes in this series, with the exception of the evil ""cigarette smoking man."" Monica used to smoke but was quitting. All that adds to the good points. Quite remarkable.

Maybe we could bring back the concept in big screen format with multiple spin-offs. They did it with ""Start Trek,"" right? Why not? After all, we would like to know about little William. And what happened to Doggett and Monica? And what would Mulder and Scully do about the alien invasion coming up? We are now (2004) only 8 years from it! They should come back on the big screen and make us happy!",1097539200,4,1899,4.587020648967552
