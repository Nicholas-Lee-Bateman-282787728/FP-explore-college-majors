This was a bizarre, cult flick and definitely worth watching.  It was a little hard to follow at first, but the plot came together and despite its ""low-budget"" affect--it was most entertaining.

Kreskin, decked out in an Andy Warhol style wig, was fantastic.  He appeared to be having the time of his life playing an odd psychologist/hypnotist.  The most memorable part of the film was Kreskin walking into a parking lot with great purpose that resulted in his conquering any number of thugs and evil doers.  It was reminiscent of an old time comic book hero and viewers just had to believe, Kreskin was having a good time.

The film is a mixture of interesting plot, spirituality, surrealism and humor.  Fans of The Amazing Kreskin will enjoy everyone's favorite mentalist in a new light.  He delivers his lines well, is successful with an odd, campy sense of humor and makes his character believable with a slight hint of danger.

In essence, that is the gist of the film--a surreal episodic fantasy, with a dangerous center made enjoyable with tiny blasts of off beat humor.

8302168,1,B001FOM5AS,"Ordinarily, I wouldn't have bothered writing a review for this movie, but given it has two positive reviews so far (presumably from friends or family of people involved in its production) I thought a more cogent review was in order.

Compared to ""Wake-up Callz,"" ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" seems brilliantly written, even Oscar-worthy.  The plot of ""Wake-up Callz"" is worse than incoherent, it's like a bad dream that you seem to run around in for hours only to wake up thinking ""What was that all about?""  Except, unlike a nightmare, the movie creates no tension, inspires no fear, and is totally uninvolving.  Even with writer/producer/""star"" Adrian Horodecky's character periodically explaining to female lead (soft-core porn actress Danielle Ciardi) what's going on, it makes no ultimate sense. It's as if twenty or thirty strange but not particularly interesting ideas were thrown into a blender and whipped together.

Had the movie been half an hour shorter it might have risen to the level of ""so bad it's funny,"" where the audience isn't laughing with it, but at it (including much of the acting).  But in this digital age, where you don't have to worry about the cost of film stock, this vanity project was able to just keep going and going and going.

For those of us old enough to remember ""The Amazing Kreskin"" in his heyday on numerous ""Tonight Show"" appearances with Johnny Carson, it's a bit sad to see him in a bad wig mugging his way through this mess.  But it's understandable that (as of this writing) Kreskin hasn't listed ""Wake-up Callz"" under ""FILM CREDITS"" on his official web site.",1229731200,3,1604,4.8713235294117645

Lots of little jokes that probably fly over most people's heads. Definitely worth seeing! Intriguing and good twists in the ending.",1226275200,2,182,4.71875
