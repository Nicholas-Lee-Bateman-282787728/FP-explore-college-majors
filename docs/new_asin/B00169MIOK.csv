The scenery shown on the Siberian river along which this ""agitbrigada"" (propaganda brigade) travels is so similar to Lapland in Finland, including in the houses along the shore.

The people are a primitive and poor lot, which I found enjoyable to watch.  True Russian peasants, not all of them loyal to Stalin and faraway ""tsars"".  The  climate in summer as they travel with their portable camera, showing war documentaries to these simple villagers, is certainly entertaining, depending on tastes.

One old villager refuses to have the church turned into a club, and holds back.  The crowd of younger folks win.  She climbs the steeple and cuts down the cross!

Well, exciting this ain't, but interesting, scenic, slow and moody, my style, yes.",1299110400,,873,5.091549295774648
