Alternative Cinema presents Susie Heartless and Phoenix in anamorphic widescreens that frame image at a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. Suzie Heartless is a shot on digital video productions. The transfer looks very good with strong colors and black levels throughout. The transfer only flaw is that some images in the background come off looking overly soft. Phoenix was shot on 35mm and in black & white. The transfer has strong shadow detail and gray levels. Overall both transfers fare well all around.

Extras for Suzie Heartless include a deleted scene (2:27) and an extensive photo gallery (4:25) with fifty two images. The photo gallery plays like a featurette with music from the film playing in the background.
