7844791,1,6303367534,Poor casting of characters. Lee plays off strong women and this actress was a disappointing choice for the part of his wife. Horsley doesn't seem to be able to pull his part off. Very disappointed Horsley would choose such a part. Had a hard time getting through the movie was hoping it would get better.  Nice boat though.,1337644800,,323,4.568965517241379
