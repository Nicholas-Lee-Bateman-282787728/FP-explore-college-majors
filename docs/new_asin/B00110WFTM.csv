8239764,5,B00110WFTM,"Korda's name has become famous because of one photo of Che, which is probably the most reproduced image in the history of photography. Korda is a lot more than one image. His photography set the stage for the fine journalistic photography era, which set Cuban photographers apart from their global counterparts before and after the Cuban revolution. The Kordavision movie is about a man, who not only made great photos but lived a multi-textural life, while doing his craft. He was a man of ethics and a clear moral definition. It certainly was not about the money, as he never received a penny of wealth for his Che image.  Pay attention to the extras, which introduce other great Cuban photographers from the same era, including Roberto Salas, Lioborio Noval, and Raul Corrales. Here is where great photography and a history lesson meet for a fine documentary experience.",1388016000,,873,4.938775510204081
