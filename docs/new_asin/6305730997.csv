1060966,5,6305730997,"This film is truly superb!  The filmmakers did a great job of contrasting Eliane DeVrie's opulent life to Indochina's suffering under colonial rule.  Moreover, although DeVrie leads a somewhat shallow existence, I couldn't help but feel her inner depth.  It was as if the rubber trees held her sorrow and wept for her - after all, the land and the people that she had come to love were on the verge of a major change of path.  This film is also interesting because of the love triangle that takes place.  Both DeVrie and her young daughter, CAmille love Jean-Baptiste.  DeVrie, however, represents the old Indochina, and Camille represents the new emerging Indochina.  And this is the conundrum of the film.  While, I don't want to give away more of this film than necessary, ""Indochine"" is definitely a moving and intense story that is full of one of the most important emotions of the heart - love.",1046736000,6,900,4.7243589743589745
1060967,5,6305730997,"I was AMAZED at some of the reviews I read. The simple fact of the matter is that this is one of the BEST films I have ever seen. It is sweeping in its beauty. The characters are strong, the scenery is beautiful, and story is enchanting!!. I LOVED it!",1046131200,2,251,4.04
1060968,5,6305730997,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen.  It combines great acting, beautiful scenery, and a political background that provides a full(as full as they can get with the length of the movie) perspective while drawing the viewer in.  Catherine Deneuve is spectacular all throughout this romance/drama/time period piece.  Also the clever blend of odd and sometimes naive characters mixed in gives it a realistic touch.
  It seems, in fact, to be two movies woven together.  They fit so perfectly together, though, because of the way the plot unravels.  The first portion centering around the female plantation owner and her relations with a soldier, and the second portion which focuses more on her Indochinese adopted daughter who chases after her first love--the same soldier.  Tied in is the sentimental story of Sao and her family.
  Everything about this movie is marvelous.  The only thing that may scare away some of the viewers is the length of the movie, which I think just allows it to be more in depth.  Indochine is A MUST SEE, especially for foreign-flick fans.",978480000,16,1075,4.911111111111111
1060969,5,6305730997,"Besides being a moving and beautiful film, I also noted that the life of the young Vietnamese daughter of Denueve was a clear metaphor for Marxists in general.  Or, this film's writer's idea of them at least.  To fight oppression and evil the young woman must become cold-hearted and give all to the cause and ""the people"", and she is baptized in violence.  Although this is a debatable stereotype of Marxists and revolutions, it does make for an excellent human story.",971654400,3,469,4.765432098765432
1060970,5,6305730997,"Sometimes I don't think the critics watch the films they review.  I was stunned by this film.  The cinematography is brilliant--the colors, the pagentry, the filth, the blood, the dreamy quality of a boat with two  lovers drifting through those thousands of little vertical islands that lie  off the coast of Asia so faithfully depicted in Chinese brush paintings and  Blue Willow porcelein.
Catherine Deneuve is gorgeous. If any criticism  can be leveled at the film it is that she is so beautiful, and her clothing  so stunning it can be distracting at times.  Her young lieutenant lover  whose name excapes me (Queen Margot's lover) is smoldering. Her adopted  (Vietnamese) daughter is a China doll.
The story takes place in what was  French Indochina before WWII, and later became the countries of Viet Nam,  Cambodia, and Thailand. The story centers on a rubber plantation owner  (Deneuve) and her relationship with her adopted daughter. Deneuve raises  the girl to have the European values. The daughter falls in love with a  young French Lieutenant who has been until then the mother's lover.  The  mother does not want her daughter to be involved with this man for a  variety of reasons.  The daughter runs away and links up with the  Lieutenant. On her journey, she sees first hand the plight of her native  people. She becomes pregnant by the Lieutenant. Events lead her to become  involved with the revolution against the French. If this film had been  shown to American audiences back in the 1960's it would have been  inflammatory. Might have started a peace movement.",960422400,90,1581,4.923954372623574

1061071,3,6305730997,"Granted the scenery is beautiful, and the pace perfect for a romantic film as long as this.

The most significant part for me was when three of the main French characters are drinking at the Continental Hotel and one of them points out that everything the French do to keep the Vietnamese oppressed produces more fighters against the French.  I remember thinking the same thing about the Americans when I was in Vietnam during 1968..

And then there was the scene of the slave market, as horrifying as anything I have ever seen on film.  This gave the lie to French claim to be a ""civilizing and beneficial"" power in it's colonies.  But whilst they believed it, the French thought they were in the right, and kept on killing those who wanted freedom from enslavement and exploitation.

The ending is biased, giving the implication that just because a woman is a communist she would not want to see her own child.  That the son would not be touched by what his mother had gone through,  and proud of what she had achieved, is a striking condemnation of how he had been brought up.  But then again, we know who had brought him up !

Vietnam is a beautiful country, the French were cruel masters, but, unfortunately, the story did not end with the film.  For me the film cannot be reviewed without the knowledge of what came after influencing the review.

Her feminine soul laid bare - is the dominant theme in this European classic ""Indochine"" (In French, 1992, Academy Award and Golden Globe Awards for Best Foreign Language Film); with renowned actress Catherine Deneuve (as its centerpiece). In the Prologue, liane Devries (Deneuve) is a French plantation owner, who adopts a Vietnamese orphaned daughter Camille (Linh Dan Pham). The setting is colonial French Indochina during the 1930s. This 159 minute epic tragic-drama so adheres to the natural principles of story-telling: it is easy to get lost in the political chaos, mayhem, upheaval, violence, and restoration of a country beset with revolution and war. Yet we rise above the turmoil to relish the dramatic turns by the brilliant, formitable acting of Deneuve (at her very best), driving the plot, character, and theme (as only a gifted actress can); investing of herself - heart and soul as a flawed but noble matriarch - what surely must be her crowning glory as a film thespian. Unities of plot and character run strong throughout. Ironies run full hilt. Emotive, natural acting achieved with finesse by Vincent Perez, Linh Dan Pham, Jean Yanne, Dominique Blanc, and a truly fine cast of character actors.

Superlative direction by Rgis Wargnier, music by Patrick Doyle, cinematography by Franois Catonn, editing by Agns Schwab and Genevive Winding; original novel by Erik Orsenna; screenwriting credits by Louis Gardel, Catherine Cohen, and Wargnier.  liane Devries in her torment, straight out of Dante's Inferno, displayed `her ascending nobility' so precisely: it sustained the central meaning within this film, namely that the human spirit cannot always be conquered by war or strife.

1061216,5,6305730997,"""Indochine,"" (1992), is a more recent-day color classic of the French cinema, a romantic, panoramic, somewhat sentimental, dramatic epic.  It is intelligently, and gorgeously filmed, and centers on beautiful, locally-born and raised, plantation owner Eliane Devries, (Catherine Deneuve--&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Umbrellas-of-Cherbourg/dp/B0001BMLUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Metro-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B001O549EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Metro (The Criterion Collection)</a>). Eliane, who never married and is without children, has adopted Vietnamese orphan Camille (Linh Dan Pham), whose parents, a local prince and princess, were killed in a plane crash.  Mother and daughter live on a 15 thousand acre rubber plantation, in French Indochina, when civil war erupts. Both women have fallen in love with the same French naval officer - who was first Eliane's lover- Jean-Baptiste de Guen, (Vincent Perez,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swept-from-The-Sea/dp/0767812115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swept from The Sea</a>). The relationship of the two women then inevitably becomes tumultuous.  This lavish, elegant film, with a cast of seemingly thousands, was directed by R&eacute;gis Wargnier.  It won both the Oscar and Golden Globe awards for Best Foreign Language Film as well as numerous French Academy of Cinema prizes.

Jean Yanne (title part in the French film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Butcher/dp/B00007G1Y1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Butcher</a>) plays Guy, local police chief.  Interesting casting that, as, in that film, which I have reviewed elsewhere, he backgrounds himself by telling villagers he has just come back from serving in Vietnam.  Of course, Americans easily forget that Indochina, as it was then known, was initially a French colony, before the civil war in which the Vietnamese freed themselves, and the French influence still visibly lingers in that part of the world.  In fact, it was only after the French left that often ravishingly beautiful Asian country that America got itself involved there, most people believe to our detriment.  But this film functions as a historical document, and, as such, retains a great deal of its power.  It gives us a thoughtful consideration of the area as a French colony; and provides, I thought, an interesting contrast to the opera Mme Butterfly, which is located in Japan at the turn of the 20th century, when it was certainly under heavy American influence.  Isn't Pinkerton, who marries Butterfly, also a naval lieutenant?

Deneuve, for whom this film was clearly a vehicle, was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for it, though she failed to win.  She is certainly as beautiful as she ever was, and her often- perceived coldness works well for her here.  She plays against it, in a wardrobe cleverly designed to indicate a wealthy and powerful woman, the boss of many men.  But she is a woman who loves her daughter.  I found, among the most quietly affecting scenes, several interludes in which mother and daughter are practicing, and then dancing, the tango together.  It's a film filled with striking moments, great and small that never forgets the human dimension to the greatest historic dramas.",1297987200,2,3453,6.2357894736842105
1061217,2,6305730997,"Never having seen a French blockbuster before I'd been duly saving this one up to watch for a special occasion. Christmas Day therefore seemed appropriate for a two-and-a-half-hour oriental spectacular. But one thing I learned this Christmas (probably the only thing) is that there's a good reason why there aren't any French blockbusters and that's because they don't know how to make them (although seeing all those prize-winning laurels on the front of the box, Oscars included, you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise).

Set in French Indochina in 1936 (though annoyingly we don't find out the year till the very end) Indochine really does have all the makings of an intriguing film. Disappointment soon sets in, however, when you realise that everything, apart of course from the millions it must have cost to make, has been gambled on Catherine Deneuve and this stops the filmmakers from seeing straight. She's okay but she's turning into a bit of a Meryl Streep, in the sense that one is now always watching a performance by Catherine Deneuve, rather than that of the character she's playing.

So, they all think, cast Catherine Deneuve and everything will turn out all right. Except it doesn't. Underneath the twin exoticisms of a leading French actress and travelogue locations Regis Wargnier may be seen to be a competent director but David Lean he ain't. Where Lean would have introduced structure and tautness, well-cast characters and the most refined of scripts Wargnier just can't make it. The film ambles along, flaccid, bloated and peculiarly lacking in tension, especially given the political undercurrents which surely any dramatist should crave; the ignominious presence of the French in this part of the world did, after all, pave the way for the Vietnam war. Instead, we get history-lite by way of seeing a few restless natives looking furtive and acting a bit bolshie so as a result Indochine ends up being the kind of 'historical' film that Richard Attenborough tends to make. Actually, David Lean wasn't too good at this side of things either (he didn't have the intellect required for political awareness) but if you want to see how films like this should really be done then Peter Weir's electrifying 'The Year of Living Dangerously' is the only place to go. And yes, I'd swap an atrocioulsly miscast Vincent Perez for Mel Gibson in a heartbeat (Gibson's finest role, in my opinion) and also relish the prospect of leaving Catherine Deneuve in her trailer while Sigourney Weaver jumps in and gets her hands dirty.

In fact, come to think of it, that's the film I've already decided I'm going to be watching on Christmas Day next year.",1293321600,,2662,4.977528089887641

When she chooses to use her influence to have Vincent Perez (Jean-Baptiste) sent away, I wanted to scream  ""no, no, don't do it, can't you see what will happen?""  No man will choose a woman of a certain age, no matter how lovely and fascinating, over a young woman who can bear him children.  Nature does not allow it.
The loveliest scene is when Jean-Baptiste is baptising their son in the pool; the most horrific the slave market which he witnesses and is supposed to be supporting.

Agreed that there are occassional films that get nominated and/or actually win in other categories (""Life is Beautiful"") but they are the exceptions that prove the rule.  In the category of cinematography, ""Indochine"" is a real award-winner.  Otherwise it is a flim that comes up short on so many levels.

The plot has possibilities but we are left confused at times, bored at times, and disappointed at times.  There is a romantic focus that is, in part, well-stated and, in part, virtually unstated.  There is a revolution that appears to emerge but only when it is convenient to the plot; otherwise it must be happening elsewhere because life switches back to normal.  There's an exodus to freedom that must have been explained in sub-titles I never saw because the characters involved seemed to voluntarily search out a more opressive existance.  (Possibly this was meant to help the revolution but I didn't understand that and, from what I saw, the characters involved didn't either).  Every time it looked as though the film was moving towards a climax, things seemed to either quickly fizzle out or casually change direction.  The acting was good but I was reminded of Shakespeare's ""...full of sound and fury, signifying nothing""  Finally, after the pilot light of all the under-developed aspects blew out, the movie came to an unimpressive ending.

Why did I watch this 2 1/2 hour movie?  The cinematography is beautiful, the sets are impressive, and the costume excellent leaving the eyes satisfied while the ears are disappointed.  For this reason, I am glad that I watched it once.  However, there's no need to watch it again.",1205020800,3,1911,5.057507987220447

1061288,3,6305730997,"In its day a casualty of the chaos and confusion surrounding the frequently ridiculous entry qualifications for the Best Foreign Film Oscar - many superior films were ruled ineligible and those it was competing against were scarcely representative of the world's best - Indochine may not be great art, but it is an enjoyable example of the kind of old-fashioned good storytelling that Hollywood rarely produces anymore.

Set against the last days of the French occupation of what was to later become Vietnam, it uses the relationship between Catherine Deneuve's French plantation owner and her adopted Vietnamese daughter (Linh Dan Pham) as a mirror for the relationship between France and Vietnam. Like the American South, for the privileged few, the French IndoChina is a fairy tale land built on the exploitation of others, which they excuse as 'paternalism.' But the idyll comes crashing down when the daughter runs away from home in search of her lover (Vincent Perez), who had previously had an affair with Deneuve, with tragic consequences.

The film moves between glossy soap opera, political drama and epic romance quite effectively, with strong performances and occasionally striking direction from Regis Wargnier and scoring from Patrick Doyle. Francois Catonne's photography is often disappointing, however, over-fond of the caramel tints that have become something of an unattractive visual clich for period drama with pretensions to the socio-political, at least until the second act where the film really gets into its stride. Heralded by a sinister procession of sampans making their torch lit way through the night, the scenes on Dragon Island are film-making of a very high order bringing the political, emotional and narrative to the fore in a seamless whole.

1061344,4,6305730997,"Into the early 1960's, our geography classes taught us about a land called Indo-China;a land of indiginous Asian people,not exactly Chinese,but a mixture and an inbred type from thousands of years of native Asian dynasty changes and hundreds of years of French colonial rule. We learned about ALOT of these kind of exotic lands (so we thought!) such as French New Guinea,British New Guinea,Belgian Congo,Rhodesia etc. to name but a few. Within years,these lands,their names and their cultural compositions and power structures were to be changed forever. Such was INDOCHINE.

INDOCHINE is a daunting tale of epic ""Gandhian"" proportions covering a span of thirty years in which the collapse of French colonial rule,the end of the Asian Aristocratic Mandarin Culture and the eventual communist/peoples' Revolution that was to result in the land of Indochine becoming the modern day countries of Vietnam,Laos,Cambodia and Thailand.

This herculean struggle is the backdrop for a story of one woman,Eliane Devries (Catherine Deneuve),a very wealthy native French rubber plantation owner,her adopted daughter Camille (Linh Dam Pham) an orphaned Royal Mandarin Princess,and what ends up being a secretly shared lover,the French Officer Jean-Baptiste Le Guen (Vincent Perez).It is this triangle of characters that plays out in an interesting,complex,sensual and often muddled tale of passion,love,lust and greed. I say muddled because if there is one problem with this film,and only one,it is in a narrative that is so overwhelming large and multi-layered with plots and numerous sublots, that even the near three hours of this gargantuan movie still leaves alot of loose ends and short flitting scenes to keep this film from falling into a deep abyss. It is alot to take in and director Regis Wargnier and screenplaywrights Catherine Cohen,Louis Gardel,Erik Orsenna and Wargnier also, ask alot of viewers to preknow alot of historical information in order to follow the superimposed love stories. But,with the necessary knowledge in place,this is a film of such brilliance,scope and magnitude that few if ever now are brought to the large screen.

Cinematography-wise,INDOCHINE absolutely ranks in the top five movies ever to be filmed. Typical words like ""breathtaking""and ""stunning"" (you know...the words critics use?) cannot begin to describe how the senses are totally aroused and satiated with photographer Francois Catonne's shots of the locations used. Colours of such richness are rarely seen in movies today. Put now-veteran Award-winning soundtrack composer Patrick Doyle's thrilling music in the mix to frame all of this nicely and, VOILA!!!,you have a masterpiece.

Having first seen INDOCHINE in 1992 at the theatre and subsequently one other time over  the years,I can now finally appreciate this film in it's entirety. There is alot to know in order to fully and completely know,understand and appreciate INDOCHINE( as the French would as it is a part of their history ,not so for Americans), yet you will be rewarded richly for having seen it. It is an almost unparalleled piece of historically-based Period filmmaking.

Indo-china received it's release from France on July 21,1954. If viewers want to know what happens in the next few years to the fledgling,newly formed ""independent"" nations, watch the 2004 remake of THE QUIET AMERICAN with Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser. It is the perfect sequel to INDOCHINE.Follow that up with any movie concerning the Vietnam War years and  you will laugh at an opening remark in INDOCHINE coming from a French lady rooting for the French Naval Rowing Team to beat an indigenous Indo-Chinese team as she smuggly remarks,""The Indo-Chinese are not built for it!""(beating the French that is).The Indo-Chinese cross the finish line first much to her dismay,and much to the dismay of the rest of the French Imperialists! Yes....the Indo-Chinese were up to it,Madame!

Catherine Deneuve is fantastic here.  Fourteen years after its theatrical release, ""Indochine"" is still well worth putting on your ""gotta see"" list.

Here's a connection I loved discovering:  Linh Dan Pham - who plays Deneuve's adopted daughter Camille here - is (12 years later on) the same actress who portrays piano virtuoso 'Miao Lin' in Jacques Audiard's brilliant ""The Beat that My Heart Skipped.""",1165449600,4,564,5.164835164835165
1061347,5,6305730997,"I would say that this film is a grand mixture of exotic and natural beauty and complexity. The complexity is multifaceted; the complexity of character development, the complexity of an unfolding plot, and the complexity of changing world politics.

Lets start with beauty. The cinematography and art direction in the film is superb, Vietnam is shown to be an amazingly magical land of changing landscapes and architecture. The cast of the film was superb. Catherine Deneuve, plays wealthy rubber plantation owner Eliane Deveries. Ms. Deneuve is a legendary beauty but in this film we see her playing the role of a woman approaching 40 and we see a mature, sophisticated, strong beauty. The front cover of the DVD should give you a clue as you see Ms. Deneuve marching through a courtyard of crouching Vietnamese slave laborers in a low cut bright red dress and pearls! Vincent Perez, as Lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Le Guen, is very handsome but it is his character development that it most importance in this film. LInh Dan Phan, as the young Camille, goes from high school girl to Communist icon. She is youthful perfection and thus the contrast between Camille's soft budding beauty and womanhood is contasted with her adopted mother's cool sophisticated mature grand beauty.

Now for the complexity. Our three main characters are in for some major changes in their lives and world views. We start with Eliane, a woman totally in control of her emotions and source of income, rearing an adopted heiress native girl on the brink of womanhood. Jean-Baptiste, a dashing young Lieutenant, begins the film as an adventuerer, attracted to older rich Eliane, not only for her beauty but because she would be a conquest. He has callous disregard for the Vietnamese people. In an early scene he orders a boat burned with a Vietnamese family aboard because they are in the canal after curfew. Love for Camille jerks him from his existence as a French naval officer to a military deserter traveling with a band of Communist insurgents. Camilla starts the film as a Catholic School girl, an heiress to the vast lands of her natural parents and to her adopted mother, Eliane. She is destined to be the wife of a young Chinese mandarin but her love of Jean-Baptiste moves her to incredible acts of challenge and survival that transforms her from a spoiled young princess to a legendary icon of the liberation movement. There are other characters of importance, but the Police Captain, played by Jean Yanne, is a wonderful character. Whereas the other characters go through vast changes, he remains the same; a cynical, world-weary, wise, older man. He knows the French suppresse the Vietnamese for financial gain, but he is resigned to play his role of trying to identify the insurgents and suppress them. He knows the French have become decadant, but he is no saint and becomes lovers with a night-club singer. It is his commentaries, primarily to Eliane, that tell the story of the rise of the Vietnamese nationalistic and communistic movements and the fall of the French empire in Indochina.

As in many works of great literature, the character development of the main actors is interwoven with historical movement to which they must repond and in responding are transformed.  This is certainly the case here as we see a French colonial empire full of the explotation and racism, social economic suppression, slave labor, classism, and decadence that occurs whenever one group of people exploits and suppresses another group.

Vietnam was suppressed first by the Chinese and thus Chinese mandarin families had remained the upper class in much of Vietnam. The lived there for generations, intermarried some with the Vietnamese, but retained the upper rungs of the economic and social structure. The French allowed these Chinese to remain when they established military and economic control. The nationalistic and communistic movements were against both the Chinese upper class and the French military/economic class.

As American audiences attempt to make sense of the Vietnamese war, it is films like this that reveal to us the historic suppression of these people and their innate desire for self-direction. We entered Vietnam to prop up a corrupt French empire, thus setting the stage for Vietnamese nationalists to seek help from Moscow and to move toward Communism. How foolish we were. It all boils down to those that do not know history are unfortunately fated to repeat it.",1160265600,9,4468,5.039242219215156
1061348,5,6305730997,"""Your Indochine is no more"" replied Camille, the released prisoner, Communist fugitive, and adopted daughter of Eliane, her mother and wealthy rubber plantation owner. Eliane had gone to the prison to rescue her daughter and try to retrieve their old lifestyle but it had died along with the political changes and rebellions against the French colonialists. Camille had been a spoiled rich young girl. She escaped a traditional Indochinese betrothal and marriage to unwittingly participate in an underground Communist movement, while trying to locate Jean- Baptiste, the French Naval officer with whom she fell in love. The film is haunting and beautiful as it depicts a historical era from the 1930s to mid 1955. The upper class French colonial lifestyle is shown in all its opulence. French ex-patriots gather for social events and celebrations while the Indochinese are second-class citizens doing the back-breaking labor in the fields. The educated Indochinese young people go to Paris for education at Universities. There they develop a taste for freedom and rebelllion, as they understand the exploitation of their country ...

Catherine Deneuve portrays Eliane Devries, the unmarried adult daughter of a wealthy rubber plantation owner, who has an affair with a French Naval officer she meets at an auction. After she discovers a serious and personally painful indescretion on his part, she uses her political influence to exile him as far as possible, to Dragon Island, an exotic location in the South Seas which is also a work colony for the French.

The film appeals on many levels: the sensually exotic location of Viet Nam (former Indochina) and the exploration of deep churning divided emotions associated with the consequences of love. The film feels so real because it occurs during a politically unstable time when Communist grass roots insurgent movements threaten the old establishment, wreaking havoc throughout the region. Camille becomes an ordinairy peasant after she elopes from her former life of opulence and wealth. She walks across the country on foot with a family who are looking to find a better life, their destination is Dragon Island. Camille experiences first hand, the exploitation of her people by the French. In one highly charged scene she commits an unexpected atrocity when enraged by the actions of the French toward the family with whom she travelled. Her innocence is lost forever. She becomes a fugitive with someone who is most important in her life. This film has enormous appeal for how it deals with sensitive life issues. The impact of personal and political events on the lives of the characters is superbly conveyed. It has hairpin surprise twists and turns in the plot which keep the viewer spell bound.

The back drop of both Vietnam, Mayalsia and Geneva are stunning to look at. The use of politics and power of the french colonial rulers and rich landowners is both intriuging and a good lesson in the politics of the time.

1061403,5,6305730997,"This movie is one of my most favorites, and it is definitely the best when it comes to Asian-women-related film-making. The love triangle is quite enjoyable to follow and should satisfy all those who seek a romantic epic. The cinematography, the conversations, the directing, etc. are all excellent. And the actors/actresses and their acting are all good as well.

But what really makes movie outstanding is the way it portrays life as it was in Indochina in the 1930s. The movie is neither in favor of the French nor of the Vietnamese nationalists. It's neither in favor of the rich nor the poor. Everyone's life seem hard at the time, although some people's lives were much harder than others'. Everyone seems helpless against history, including the rich and the powerful. For example, that brief part about the slave trader is one of my favorite parts in the movie. Just like in other movies, he is the villain of the story, and he totally deserved to die. But then there was still something helpless about him, as if his life and its ending were not really his choice, as if both of them were just part of how life was at the time.

What I like most about the movie is how it portrays the image of Vietnamese women. I'm so SICK of Hollywood movies in which Asian women are always some sort of prostitues or suppressed/vulnerable women in need of help and protection (""The Quiet American"" is an example of this). Yes, it is true that there are a lot of those women, especially in the old times, but such women are by no means representative of the whole female population. Yet through Hollywood movies, such wrong images about Asian women have somehow become stereotypes. ""Indochine"" is the first and only movie I know of that deviates from this main stream. In ""Indochine"", we see a Vietnamese girl who grew up in wealth and happiness, who might seem weak and vulnerable at first but needs noone's help or protection in the end, not because she comes from high class and is rich, but because she is a woman of strength and courage.

It's beautiful the way she gradually became a nationalist. Throughout her childhood, she was well protected from and hence knew nothing of the sufferings of her native country and people. Still, she is full of passion and spirit by nature, and that's why and how she had the courage to run away to find the man that she loved. Before she was aware of the outside world or of nationalism, all the passion and spirit inside her were directed toward her love for a man. As expected, those same passion and spirit were later on channeled toward her love for her country and people. This is the kind of image of Vietnamese/Asian women that should be represented more in movies.",1134950400,21,2709,4.6161825726141075
1061404,3,6305730997,"Indochine is an epic about the French misadventure in Indochina.  Eliane (a still stunning Catherine Deneuve) is a Frenchwoman who owns a rubber plantation in Vietnam.  She loves her adopted country and her adopted Vietnamese daughter Camille (a luminous Linh Dan Pham).  Trouble starts when Eliane has a fling with Jean Baptiste (Vincent Perez), a young naval officer.  In one of several improbable plot twists, Jean-Baptiste rescues Camille during a street riot, and she falls hopelessly in love with him.  To separate them, Eliane pulls strings to get Jean-Baptiste reassigned to the country's wild northern coast.

Camille runs away to find him, and in the process sees firsthand that the French colonial edifice is propped up by the suffering of the country's peasants.  She and Jean-Baptiste unite, only to be sundered.  Camille turns away from her mother and her mother's way of life, joining the Communists in their successful efforts to drive the French out of Indochina.

The script poses some interesting issues about the moral ambiguities of colonialism, but there might be more brittle irony and Gallic anguish than those from less self-dramatizing cultures want to watch.  While the cinematography captures the lush, mysterious beauty of Vietnam, there are too many long, lingering nature shots. Director Regis Wargnier could have easily chopped forty five minutes worth of travelogue scenery and reaction shots out of this film.

Speaking of culture, with the exception of Jean-Baptiste, the French businessmen, policemen, and administrators never stop believing they're in Indochina to uphold the values of a superior civilization. It's as though Wargnier wants us to sympathize with Eliane and her compatriots and mourn the passing of their colonial way of life.  Indochine is shot through with the same moral confusion as the American movie Gone with the Wind (to which it bears more than a passing resemblance.)  Whether you're a plucky woman on a rubber plantation in Vietnam, or a plucky girl on a cotton plantation in Georgia, exploiting other humans for economic gain is an evil practice.  Using pretty actors in pretty scenery to spin the exploitation story doesn't mitigate the evil, only makes it more difficult to discern.

Two better films about the French experience in Vietnam are the French film, The Scent of Green Papayas and Phillip Noyce's adaptation of Graham Greene's The Quiet American.",1132358400,8,2424,5.259740259740259

Over the course of the movie, Denieuve and her daughter both fall in love with the same military officer (Vincent Perez) and there are many seperations and reunions, in accordance with the conventions of this type of story.

The daughter's political awakening is the most interesting aspect of the story, but it is given short shrift.

1061406,4,6305730997,"I first saw the movie when it was released in France. It differs so much from all the American war movies which were made about Vietnam over and over again... Breathtaking views of the tropical and mountainous Vietnamese countryside and shore were shown/filmed artistically and beautifully.

This is the tale of a forbidden love between a young French army officer (played by the charming Vincent Perez) and his Vietnamese adolescent girlfriend, who happens to be the adopted daughter of a rich expatriate who is the owner of a vast rubber plantation (played by a warmer than usual Catherine Deneuve), who also happens to be his ex-lover...

The love story between the two becomes more complicated when Indochina (""the land in the South"" meaning Vietnam), slowly evolves from servitude, corruption and colonial decrepitude into violence and chaos when the communists take over the French and turns the country into civil war.

In this context, Catherine Deneuve, a bachelor in her forties, tries to continue running her family business ""as usual"" and to maintain a respected standing in society. Her tasks become increasingly difficult, as events and politics turn ugly and everything everywhere start to deteriorate. Things at the plantation turn pretty bad there too when a mysterious arson breaks out in the rubber factory, and later all workers refuse orders to return to work... Her life could hardly become more depressing, but then she discovers that her daughter has fallen crazy in love with her ex-lover!...

The fate of the three: mother, daughter and the army officer who loved them both, becomes tragically extricated to the fate of Indochina....

1061459,5,6305730997,"This deeply felt and emotionally rich portrait of a country about to change forever is one of the most beautiful films ever made. It is elegant and opulent in its visual presentation and subtle in its human tale of heartbreak. This film has the majesty of morning sunlight on water we dare not shield our eyes from for fear we will miss one moment of its glory.

Director Reigis Wargnier has created a masterpiece of epic beauty, showing us the country of Vietnam when it existed as the French colony Indochine. He shows how and why the communist uprising was so popular and the way of life it threatened. It does not make judgements but shows the human drama and the heartbreak caused by a way of life that existed and the one that was coming to change it.

Wargnier accomplishes all this in a slow and visually stunning portrait of one family in Indochine.  The story is centered around the magnificent performance of Catherine Deneuve as French rubber plantation owner Eliane Deveries, and the equally terrific Linh Dan Phan as her adopted Indochine daughter Camille. The contrasts of Eliane's cool elegance and Camille's young and sensual beauty is like a mirror for the country itself as Wargner shows the difference between the French and those that serve them.

Eliane runs her rubber plantation with the help of her 'coolies' and it appears to be her entire life except for her daughter Camille. But Eliane's cool outward elegance only masks the repressed emotions she hides from others. Her affairs have been casual and she believes indifference is the secret to surviving love. But that indifference changes dramatically as she finally falls hard for young French Naval Officer Vincent Perez (Jean-Baptiste Le Guen). She throws herself at him as he draws away and discovers she is not enough for Vincent.

There is much unrest at the class distinctions of Indochine. Eliane's Indochine is one of elegance and self-indulgence. It is a world of Fitzgerald and Gatsby. The world of the Indochene people is more severe. This film takes its time showing us all that is beautiful about the country and slowly begins to show the darkness underneath that beauty when Camille falls in love with Vincent also. Eliane is stunned beyond words but not actions as she uses her clout to have him transferred to the farthest outpost so Camille can go through with an arranged marriage to Tanh (Eric Nguyen).

But Eliane has underestimated her daughter's love for Vincent and she runs away to find him. Vincent has learned about the slave trade which provides Eliane and others like her with their workers in this remote French outpost and sees firsthand its brutality. When Camille finds him it is during the picking of these workers and a tragedy forces both to flee to a place hidden and supposedly cursed, where their love will bloom and a legend will start. There are some tender and moving moments and some true heartbreak involving a baby.

As the communist revolution grows stronger and Camille is imprisoned, Vincent will meet Eliane once more. It is only when Camille is imprisoned that she is even sure she is alive. Her long time aquaintance Guy (Jean Yanne) has been searching for years as the legend of this young beauty has grown so that everyone in the country knows the story. Once released she will be the one to help change the country forever, but not before a heartbreaking meeting with her mother and a sacrifice of love.

This film may indeed be slow but it is emotionally rich and the visual beauty of the country itself is magnificently captured. Deneuve's cool elegance is perfect for the part and her Oscar nomination was well deserved. Linh Dan Phan is wonderful as Camille as she goes from the innocence of dancing with her mother to a symbol for her entire country. There are no judgements made here. This is a human film and not a political one. This film is what a Renoir painting would be if it could leave the canvas and find our hearts. It is an impression of a country and a time rather than a clear photograph.

Those who watch this film and stay with it will be richly rewarded. Few films can make the claim to be art, but this is one. Its quiet beauty and sorrow you will not soon forget. You must see, and own, this magnificent film.",1120003200,107,4266,4.700133868808567
1061460,4,6305730997,"Despite winning the academy award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1992, this film is universally panned by American critics who focus primarily on Catherine Deneuve, the movie's box office draw. But the story is not soley about Deneuve's character, rubber plantation owner Eliane Devries, and is indeed too large for any single character. The story's real focus is most fully developed in the second half of the film as adopted princess Camille (Linh Dan Pham) discovers her true legacy in French colonial Vietnam. During her epic quest to find her to-be lover, French naval officer Jean-Baptiste, the harsh brutality against her people and the startling beauty of her country are revealed through stunning cinematography that is at times cathedral in its beauty. One particularly moving and highly symbolic scene depicts Jean-Baptiste baptizing their infant son just moments before his capture (Baptiste unwittingly becomes a fugitive from the colonial society of which it is his sworn duty to protect). Ironically, the child of this unlikely union is not raised by either parent but by Eliane Devries, and himself symbolizes the mingled, uncertain future of the ""Pearl of the Orient.""

I am deeply moved every time I watch this epic drama which has become hands-down my favortite foreign film, but I'm obviously in the minority, at least among American viewers. The various subplots and central characters subtly yet powerfully symbolize the undercurrents within a French colonial society intent on imposing its identity on the Vietnamese society desperate to salvage its own. I would love to read some reviews by foreign viewers, particularly French and Vietnamese, of whom this tragic history concerns most deeply. In the meantime, check out Dennis Littrellis' review, which is critically insightful, here at Amazon.",1098748800,14,1822,5.348432055749129
1061461,4,6305730997,"Loved the photography and mood, but too many subplots of which many don't contribute or cloud what should be the central theme.
If this movie was limited to the relationship between Jean-Baptiste and Camille it would be perfect.
Flashback?  Occupies about two scenes and not relevant to anything.
Boat race symbolism?  Not really and doesnt tie to the other elements of the film.  Maybe it's a bigger deal in France (though I always thought it was an Oxford-Cambridge thing).
Eliane?  We're supposed to see that her blind and oblivious participation in colonialism contributes to its own downfall and the rise of communism.  Whoopee.  It ties only loosely to the rest of the film; the 'roots of communism' are just as well or better illustrated thru the actions of Jean-Baptiste's navy.  I'm sorry, but trying to make her the focus of the film and everything that happens just doesnt work (and her actings kind of flat too).  Elianes suitor Guy?  Lose that guy (no pun intended) too or change his role, he just gets in the way and confuses things.  Ditto to Elianes father.
Bottom line, Eliane needs to be a supporting character to make this film truly work, not a competing central figure.

But a definite recommend to see.",1094688000,,1224,4.8086124401913874
1061462,5,6305730997,"Few films touch my mind, heart and soul at once.  This one does. It presents strong, multidimensional characters in complex situations, and who change, grow, and cope with challenges and tragedy in sometimes surprising ways. I am stunned to see the reviews that saw the actors as wooden, the directing inconsistent, or the story lacking: they didn't see what I saw, suggesting that different experiences lead to different perceptions.  This film can be seen at many levels and with many interpretations: among them, it showed how individuals may support tyranny with the best of intentions, oppression must fail, and change requires sacrifice...love may conquer, but perhaps not as one hopes for individual joy.  There were no innocents, no ineffably strong heroes in this film.  The characters portrayed people with whom I could relate, and understand, and cry for. Yet all of the central characters had (at least at some point) participated in enforcing oppression, or committed murder for various compelling reasons.  It shows that those who accept the call to fight injustice may be compelled to sacrifice their personal happiness if not their lives-- and their motives are not necessarily noble. The film provides insight to the history that led to the Vietnam war, and relevant perspectives for reflecting on present problems of terrorism, cultural imperialism, and political justifications for war. As in life, there is no single correct view, no one correct line of action, only flawed humans, inadequate policies, and political systems dedicated to reinforcing a status quo. And Indochine shows the failures, the struggles and the human drama...will we ever learn from history?",1087689600,10,1686,5.323308270676692

1061464,4,6305730997,"Indochine is a tragic love story of historic and epic proportions that is set in the 1930s French colonies of Indochina where Eliane (Catherine Deneuve) adopts Camille (Linh Dan Pham) who lost her parents in an airplane accident as a five year old girl.  This adoption increases Eliane's financial power as her family becomes one of the prime natural rubber producers in Indochina.  Through Eliane's assets she can afford to buy art and other expensive luxuries, and at an auction in Saigon she meets Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez).  They become secret lovers, but are discovered by Eliane's father who is afraid of loosing his daughter.  The father attempts to pay Jean-Baptiste to avoid Eliane, however, it does not work.  Nonetheless, their relationship ends and through an accident Jean-Baptiste meets Camille who falls in love with him.  Consequently, Jean-Baptiste is sent to a remote location to serve the French Navy, but the love between Camille and Jean-Baptiste is stronger than any distance.

Wargnier displays an astonishing epic film where the historical socioeconomic status of the people of Indochina is examined through a few characters.  These characters put forward a brilliant performance as they display both strengths and weaknesses that distinguish their class and role in society.  The location chosen for many of the scenes is purely breathtaking as these scenes offer multiple views of the beautiful Indochina.  Wargnier grabs the French colonialism within the moment and depicts a strong visual experience that many will not forget for some time as it provides an excellent cinematic experience.",1084147200,5,1621,5.346456692913386

Elegant and eloquent examination of the futility and brutality of imperialism on every level of consciousness: global, local, and most revealingly, personal.  No one reveals that peculiarly feminine expression of depravity with as much dexterity, rigor, and precision as Deneuve.",1076025600,3,379,5.213114754098361
1061466,4,6305730997,"This 1992 film won an Academy Award for best foreign language film. Starring Catherine Deneuve, it's a sweeping epic set in French Indochina in the late 1930s. The French were colonialists without apology. They felt they were bringing civilization to the country.  We all know what happened later, but the characters don't.  This made me have the persistent feeling throughout about how I knew the style of life displayed in the film would all be swept away.
Catherine Deneuve was almost fifty years old when the film was made and her maturity just adds to her beauty and elegance.  She's cast as a wealthy rubber plantation owner who has never married but has adopted a lovely young Vietnamese girl she raises as her daughter with all the advantages of a French education and beautiful clothes.  Both she and her daughter, played by Linh Dan Pham, fall in love with the same French navel officer, 30-year old Vincent Perez.  And when the lovely Catherine has him sent to a remote outpost, her daughter follows him. There's political upheaval in the air and soon the daughter and the naval officer are on the run.  Eventually they become revolutionaries.  There's much tragedy.  And a child who is left to be raised by his grandmother.
It's a good story, well told.  But it focuses on the romance instead of the revolution.  This makes it a little too sugar coated for my taste although the acting is excellent and the screenplay engaging.  It did hold my interest throughout the 158 minutes, however, and gave me a picture of what Vietnam must have been like for the French.  They lived a fairytale existence in the lap of luxury while all around them people were being exploited and worked to death. I enjoyed the film even though it lacked the bite and emotional engagement that I would have preferred.",1064448000,7,1805,4.75
1061467,4,6305730997,"Catherine Deneuve plays a French planatation owner (Eliane) in colonial Vietnam whose relationship with the Vietnamese orphan girl (Camille) she adopted seems intended to allegorically mirror the political shift also depicted in the movie from a French colonial Vietnam to a nation struggling for liberation and identity. Superbly filmed and accompanied by a lush musical score, the film shows some stunning shots of the Vietnamese landscape particularly as Camille journeys through Vietnam after she flees her home. The movie is long (about 2 1/2 hours), and at times the emotions may seem played over the top. But Catherine Deneuve hits a poignant emotional climax towards the end of the movie, outside of the conference site of the Vietnam War peace talks in Paris. Well worth the over two hour wait.",1063756800,11,803,5.184615384615385

Music was there, the voices were there, the theme was there and everything was so perfect as an Italian opera of the greatest composer.  I took my time, I really did, to find anything wrong with this film and I could not.  Now, let me tell you that I am a picky one.  I can take apart anything if I don't like it and sometimes if I like it.  But this one was so bulletproof that I faild to find the whole in it.
So, I guess, ""Indocine"" is one of very rare accasions in the cinematography when everything is perfect.  How did they do it?  I guess they just lived it.  Well, if you have not seen it, you have to do it.  This is not a movie to miss.",1051142400,15,757,3.857142857142857

As the struggle against European imperialism sweeps Indochina, Jean-Baptiste and Camille have to choose sides and the strong Eliane faces the emotionally difficult challenge of raising the child of her daughter and ex-lover.
