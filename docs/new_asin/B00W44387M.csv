8712070,5,B00W44387M,"Nine out of ten Hindi (Bollywood) films are comparable to junk bonds in quality of script, acting, directing and willingness to spend money on production. Admittedly oriented toward a less educated audience (comparable to American tele watchers, especially the day/early evening time crowd), in providing life's fantasy compensation.
This film breaks the mode; quite a bit of unexpected decision making in this action thriller in which the protagonists/antagonists show some twisty behaviors that should keep the viewer engaged and guessing.
And, surprise, there's a second Hindi, two in one week, that is similarly scripted as an intelligent thriller - ""NH 10"".
These two exhaust Bolly's quality quota for the month.",1434585600,,717,5.527272727272727

8712072,5,B00W44387M,"Sriram Raghavan definitely is fond of edgy movies with a twisted ending, his movies are unconventional but sadly none of them have become cult favorites. I loved Ek haseena Thi, Johnny Gaddar and to a certain extent Agent Vinod.
But Badlapur might just increase his fan club-this is a dark tale of revenge that becomes darker in the hands of Sriram. This is a tale that surprises us until the final frame.
Badlapur was inspired from the noir novels of Massimo Carlotto and the plot is about a bank robbery gone terribly wrong. The movie's tagline tells us not to miss the first few minutes and you shouldn't. They are harrowing to say the least. A woman and her child are held ransom and die at the hands of the kidnapper Liak ( Nawazuddin Siddiqui), and his accomplice, the husband Raghu (Varun Dhavan)is distraught and devastated and he becomes so besotted with revenge that he loses his identity. The victim becomes crazier than the assailant. The first part of the movie sets the tone and the movie gets better in the second part with the appearance of Vinay Pathak.

The movie is not the typical revenge and thankfully the director has to thank the source material for that, and also two great actors - Varun Dhavan delivers an amazing performance, I never thought that this kid could essay this role..he is definitely someone to look out for. Nawazuddin as expected was good but even he over shadowed his past roles- such was his acting - the scene when he says goodbye to Huma Qureshi outside her building - just amazing. Vinay Pathak does another great role and so does Huma Qureshi and Radhika Apte ( Kanchan/Koko).
The landscape of Igatpuri with its heavy monsoon adds another dimension to the film. The music by Sachin Jigar is great.
This is a great film that is not to be missed. (Please be careful when watching with small children as there are many sexual situations and scenes of extreme violence, not suitable for minors) February 20th. 2015",1430611200,4,1958,4.691860465116279
