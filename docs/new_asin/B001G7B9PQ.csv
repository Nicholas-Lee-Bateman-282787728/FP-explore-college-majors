8304186,5,B001G7B9PQ,"I greatly enjoyed this documentary - it's a truly exhaustive work on the historical apparitions of Mary, Mother of Jesus Christ. The documentary includes detailed information on at least over a dozen of well known apparitions throughout the history, four of which were approved by Catholic Church. A&E Television Network has truly done an outstanding job - by taking a neutral position, the authors provide you with a room to arrive at your own conclusions. As to the explanations of apparitions, someone said in this documentary: ""This cannot be explained to those who have no faith; those who have faith, need no explanations."" Very informative and very impressive, it provokes a profound thought about other dimensions of existence, which cannot be fully explained as of yet. Whether you are a scientist, a historian, a student, a Christian, or non-Christian - this documentary is greatly beneficial to anyone.",1221609600,6,913,5.217687074829932
