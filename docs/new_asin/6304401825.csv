861623,2,6304401825,"Although a few of the particularities that distinguish successful director Burt Kennedy's slow paced Westerns are to be found here in this film made for television, they yet are beneath a standard he has established in his most successful works, with a result that the piece is barely tolerable, generating very little of interest that might keep a viewer's attention focussed upon the narrative.  One will be expected to believe that a plot depicting two American adventurers journeying through the heart of civil strife torn 1895 Mexico in a train bearing a large load of dynamite, all the while attempting to evade unfriendly actions of Federale troops, anti-Porfirio Diaz rebels, hostile Apache Indians, and persistent Wells Fargo agents, might promise a great deal of action and suspense, but such fail to develop due to a weakly constructed script.  The American pair, Cross (Willie Nelson) and Boone (Jack Elam), are on the lam from the U.S., having stolen a substantial supply of gold that Cross has secreted, and after they are captured by Mexican police, they are saved from death before a firing squad because of a promise they make to lead their captors to their cache of loot.  On the way to the treasure, the entourage adds on a stranded rail car outfitted to house five prostitutes, and their procuress, played by Delta Burke, the women soon becoming an added but welcome burden to the bandit team during the essentially schematic episodes that follow.  Direction from Kennedy, who as well produces and scripts here, is flabby throughout and the poorly composed screenplay, that includes a surfeit of anachronisms, misses on all cylinders, while Nelson is wooden and attacks his lines, thereby preventing character development.  Elam receives the greatest amount of screen time, as a crusty old bandit.  Burke's madam, in addition to her charges, are always perfectly coiffed, made up, and dressed, and it is a secure presumption that the Old West never saw such bewitching scarlet women, that additionally possess a remarkable talent for remaining clean and well-groomed, an ability shared, albeit to a lesser extent, by low-grade thieves Cross and Boone.  The film apparently is meant to provide comic elements, but there is precious little comedic about the affair, with an unintended exception of a curiously superfluous number of scenes featuring rolling stock, quite as if the film's production team is attempting to establish a milestone figure for the greatest amount of footage involving moving trains, primarily shot in scenic regions of New Mexico and Colorado, to an extent that is more risible than pertinent to the storyline, especially when segments are edited as repeats.  Acting laurels are shared here by Gerald McRaney as leader of the pursuing Wells Fargo riders, and Alfonso Arau as boss of the anti-government fighters, each actor managing to utilize fine technique in spite of being given sub-standard dialogue.",1155859200,2,2949,5.180672268907563
861718,5,6304401825,"Really enjoyed this movie.  Although not given credit for it on the end titles, this movie was filmed largely in the states of Colorado and New Mexico and along the route of the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad.  If you have ridden this train, you will recognize many of the scenes in the movie.
Willie is always great in any movie he has done--in my opinion.",1411516800,,359,4.424242424242424
861719,3,6304401825,"It was OK. If you are a fan of Willie Nelson you will enjoy the film. The best part about it is that much of the film centers around a train ride. The train they rode on is located in the mountains of New Mexico and Colorado. I was able to ride this train several years ago and many of the scenes in the movie I was able to recognize! The name of the train is The Cumbres & Toltec train. It runs from early June to early October. By the middle of October they shut down for the snow season! The train runs through some high mountains.

861723,5,6304401825,"When this first appeared on television a while back I had taped it via VCR.  Unfortunately, tapes don't always last as long as you'd like, and mine eventually went the route of all used tapes.  Finding this on DVD was a boon, and once more I can enjoy the adventure and humor of a fantastic set of actors and actresses.  Willy Nelson, Jack Elam, and Gerald McRainey are excellent in their roles of hunted and hunter, and Delta Burke as the ""soiled dove"" with a heart is also excellent.  I highly recommend this for sharing a bowl of popcorn and just sitting back and enjoying.",1384732800,,576,4.457142857142857

7869930,5,6304401825,I like most all of Willie's movies. The first time I saw this movie I liked it. It has a good plot and good acting in it. One person in it is Jack Elim. He is always funny in westerns. He plays Willie's partner in crime in the movie. I enjoyed watching this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes a good western and likes Willie in westerns.,1417219200,,345,4.0144927536231885
