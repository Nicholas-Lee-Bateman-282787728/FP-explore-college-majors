8001271,3,B0000DJZ9Z,"The irreppressible and sometimes laconic Stephen Baldwin stars in this thriller, which isn't bad for a straight to video movie.  Baldwin plays one of this militant activists who mans an organization called R.A.M.  On one particular mission to prove that water is being tainted, something goes wrong and one of his sidekicks is killed (his girlfriend) and another, Jeremy disappears.  Afterwards, a serial bomber is taking care of those people he or she feels is responsible for ruining the earth.  It's all been done before, but director Jonathan Heap keeps the action tense and suspenseful.  One big problem is there is never any explanation as to how the bomber manages to get a glass paperweight and a glass duck into the buildings of his victims?  Baldwin is appropriately stoic, Kelly Rowan is fine as the ATF agent who becomes his ""friend"";  Tom Skerritt is durable as always as the crusty mentor of Rowan; and D.B. Sweeney oozes righteous insanity as the bomber.  All in all, GREENMAIL is an entertaining if somewhat derivative film.",1115424000,4,1040,4.971098265895954
8001272,1,B0000DJZ9Z,"AN EX-CON [STEPHEN BALDWIN] HELPS THE POLICE GO AFTER A SERIAL BOMBER. HAS A COUPLE OF GOOD ACTORS IN ITS CAST, BUT THE STORY IS POORLY PACED AND THE SCRIPT IS WEAK. NOT TO MENTION, THE ACTION SCENES ARE ALSO BAD. THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. THIS MOVIE AIN'T NO BETTER OR DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF THE OTHER DIRECT TO VIDEO ACTION MOVIES THAT YOU'LL SEE IN THE ACTION SECTION OF YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE.",1074816000,4,411,4.215189873417722
