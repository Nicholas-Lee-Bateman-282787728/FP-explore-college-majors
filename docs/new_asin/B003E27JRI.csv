8395227,4,B003E27JRI,"To be fully honest, I expected this workout to be as hard as a Jillian Michaels workout; this basically means that I expected to not be able to finish it because it was so hard.  While it wasn't that degree of difficulty (I finished it the first time I viewed it without much struggle), it was still a sufficient workout that works the entire body.

Before buying this DVD, I had only had step/dance workouts with the instructor Patrick Goudeau.  It was good to see him in a non-dancey workout environment for once.  Patrick is a phenomenal instructor; he will make you work as hard as you can, but he'll make it a fun experience.  He is extremely silly, giggly, and constantly yelling out,""Oh my gosh!""...if you don't like this type of instructor, you will hate this DVD.  I personally love this personality.

The moves that he does are mostly compound which means that you will work your upper body and lower body simultaneously.  And example would be a squat into a shoulder press.  In between these strength moves, Patrick will do a cardio move, usually using the step to jump off of.  While he doesn't give many modifications, it is relatively easy to modify most of the moves by not adding the jumps or doing the moves on the floor.  Beginner exercisers will probably not like this workout, but intermediates will probably be challenged.  Advanced exercisers will find that it's not incredibly difficult, but it isn't the easiest workout either.

The equipment required is a step, mat, light set of weights, and heavy set of weights.  The step should be long enough for your upper body to lie down on; otherwise, you may have to do some lying down moves on the floor.  The mat should be long enough to cover your step for when you lie or sit down on it.  The heavy hand weights should be enough to challenge you, and the light weights should be enough to challenge you when your arms are getting tired.  You can obviously make the workout more intense by making your weights heavier.

The first half of the workout seems more focused on lower body, while the second half seems more focused on upper body and abs.  I wasn't sore at all the next day, although my muscles did burn quite a bit while doing some of the exercises.  The menu lets you choose to do the full workout, just 30 minutes, just 40 minutes, just the first half, or just the second half.

Overall, I do like this workout.  I use it when I want to work my entire body but don't want something extremely intense.  I definitely recommend it to all.  If you're used to Jillian Michaels, then this won't be a huge challenge, but if you are just a beginner/intermediate exerciser this will be a great workout for you to do.",1315008000,4,2690,4.521739130434782
8395228,4,B003E27JRI,"Patrick Goudeau is an excellent and motivating trainer with lots of positive energy.  I like to use this dvd for days when I want a moderate, not strenuous, work-out.  Worth the purchase!",1310256000,2,187,4.8125
8395229,5,B003E27JRI,"This workout is truly 'hard work conditioning'!  It leaves me sweating after I'm done!  Also one of the few workout dvds that have me smiling and laughing during it because Patrick is so endearing and funny!  So refreshing to have someone working out just as hard as you, feeling 'the pain' too, and having such a great sense of humor to keep you motivated!  Great workout dvd!",1278201600,,377,4.582089552238806
8395230,5,B003E27JRI,"I am not a big at home exercise person. I have tried fittv and exercise tv. I usually end up fast forwarding the segments - I found a fittv personality that I actually did the entire segment to and found that he does at home dvds - Patrick Goudeau.  I tried this video first because I wanted what the title claims, ""Hard Work"" and Conditioning. . I got it plus some extra entertainment. I was never bored, challenged in all the moves, and have consistently done with dvd on business travel and on days when I just really didn't feel like leaving my home, but knew I should do something good for myself. Highly recommend this video and did purchase other videos made by this person Goudeau. The other video is completely different and I alternate between the two now.",1273881600,3,766,4.4714285714285715
8395231,5,B003E27JRI,"If I am going to work out, I want to see results.  With Hard Work Conditioning, I actually saw results.  I found that I grew stronger (I can now lift more than just those 3 lbs weights) and I became more toned (e.g. less flabby).  The workout isn't ""easy"" (believe me that you will sweat), but that's why you see results. It is well worth the sweat.  I think Patrick does an excellent job of explaining and demonstrating the exercises. A good instructor is really important to me. Otherwise, I just will not use the DVD.  I find Patrick to be motivating, knowledgeable and fun. Because of my good experience with this video, I've purchased 2 more of Patrick's DVDs.  I'll review those soon.",1273708800,3,690,4.524193548387097
