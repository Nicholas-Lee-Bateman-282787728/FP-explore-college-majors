8745496,5,B019KWFUIU,I saw a video for this on Total Fitness DVDs and bought it right away-I am an advanced exceriser and have many Barre style DVDs and found this to be challenging but not extreme. I have the Dream Body workouts which are very difficult and many Barlates DVDs which are Challenging yet not as frantic as Dream Body and these are sort middle ground. I felt a good burn and at 50 years old and after many excercise related injuries I found these doable and unlike some workouts was able to do all the moves with no modifying. I also bought Tendu Toning 2 and loved that as well. The instructor was much younger then me and very slim but seemed down to earth and not annoying or condescending .I don't always gel with a Trainer but found her engaging and really enjoyed both DVDs tremendously. Would buy again if she puts out more DVDs,1509667200,2,829,4.354838709677419
8745497,5,B019KWFUIU,"Tendu Toning is amazing. I had my first baby 9 months ago and a friend recommended this workout to me. It was very challenging at first. Now, months later, it is easier because I am so much stronger. I used this DVD about 4-5x week for about 7 months. During that time, I lost 30 lbs, almost all of my baby weight and an incredible 17 inches! I noticed the most inches were lost around my thighs and hips, 2 of my main problem areas. I highly recommend this workout for everyone of all fitness levels. One of the background girls does a modified version of most of the exercises so you can follow her until you are stronger. My legs especially have become so much stronger and toned from this workout and that has really helped me with running. Rachel is very serious that you can get long, lean muscles from this workout. I have seen the results first hand. Thank you for such a great workout!",1475539200,6,894,4.3273809523809526
