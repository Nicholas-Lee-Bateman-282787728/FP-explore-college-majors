8285157,5,B001BXRREC,"I was, and will always be, a SeaBee from, 70-74. Somethings never change, tell us something couldn't done, we did it. Tell us it would take forever, well that took a little longer but we got it done. A lot of us served with Marines, the greatest bunch of guys you'll ever serve with! Course they loved us because we always had ice and cold beer. As far as this movie is concerned, it is made up of film from WWll, so it's all black and white and of course the sound isn't perfect. No special effects, no computer graphics, no rehearsals, and no stuntmen. But you get the idea...",1505952000,3,578,4.263636363636364

8285160,5,B001BXRREC,My Dad was in the Seabees and his battalion is mentioned in this book. I haven't finished reading the whole book but it provides a lot of facts.,1469404800,2,144,4.178571428571429

8285163,3,B001BXRREC,I dunno. Pretty much what you'd expect. Black and white. Archived footage. Lousy music. Narration so-so. Story is strung together like pearls on a string. The usual film for this genre.,1403395200,,185,5.0
8285164,5,B001BXRREC,Nice synopsis. Film footage of the Aleutians I have never seen. Old newsreels from the government make up the majority of the video. Narration by the admiral in charge during WW2.,1362182400,3,179,4.806451612903226
