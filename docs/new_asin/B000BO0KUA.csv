2431288,5,B000BO0KUA,"No kidding, I liked the movie when I saw it in theaters, but this DVD is the best I've bought in a year. This DVD set includes 2 discs: DISC ONE= a raunchier UNRATED version of the movie with 3 audio commentary tracks and a text commentary track that you can watch with the movie as it gives you funny insights into the making of the film and educates you on independent film trivia. DISC TWO= more special features than you can shake a stick at! You get 10  behind-the-scenes featurettes, lots of outtakes, deleted scenes with optional commentary, over a dozen hilarious hidden (but easily found) easter eggs, hundreds of photos from the production, and the shooting script for your PC. But the best part of this DVD is the bonus short film WALKENTALK, which I saw at the AFI Fest in 2003 and thought I'd never find. If you like Christopher Walken, this short alone is worth the price of the DVD!",1138147200,5,897,4.469512195121951
2431289,1,B000BO0KUA,"I saw this in L.A. in October.  There were three other people in the theater besides myself, and two of them left.  There were points where I even fell asleep.  I see what they were trying to do, but ultimately they failed.",1138060800,5,223,4.261904761904762
2431290,5,B000BO0KUA,"This is an industry first, the only true parody of independent films ever made. This film has plenty of laughs; whether you're giggling at the potty-mouthed dialogue or bursting at the seems watching Amelie make out with the answering machine from Swingers (yes, you heard me right, an answering machine voiced by the always vulgar Jason Mewes) or sitting in awe of the greatest Christopher Walken impression you're likely ever to see, this movie has something funny waiting for you.",1137369600,3,483,5.05
2431291,5,B000BO0KUA,"I had a chance to view this movie @ Sidewalk and let me tell you, I laughed so hard it STILL hurts. Chris Gore has done an outstanding job of taking the traditional ""parody"" movie genre to the independent film sense. With Jason Mews (any Kevin Smith movie) and Paget Brewster (""Huff"", ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe"") this movie will have you rolling from open to close!",1136592000,7,375,4.611940298507463
2431296,5,B000BO0KUA,"I love these spoof movies, this one really holds my interest. I can't wait to see how they make fun of my favorite indie movies. I ordered this online a couple days ago, might order another copy for my friends birthday. The trailer makes me become so impatient waiting to get my copy, this movie just looks really funny and exciting!!",1140480000,,334,4.491803278688525
2431297,5,B000BO0KUA,"I think the spoofs in MBFIM are even better than the ones in Scary Movie 1 and Not another Teen Movie. However, I love these kinds of movies. They just make me laugh so much.

The packaging of the dvd is nice.. i like all of the extra feautres that the dvd contains, i think its cool that you get the collectible postcards with the dvd as well, i wish more dvds gave you some sort of collectible items like that.. i cant wait to watch this with my gf, she loves comedies so i know she is gonna like this film & $15 is a great price for this film, that is how much i got it for at best buy.

I loved Not another teen movie and all the scary movies, but this movie is incredible.",1140480000,2,677,3.898550724637681
2431298,5,B000BO0KUA,"As for MY BIG FAT INDEPENDENT MOVIE, it's exactly what it promises to be. Truth in advertising: ""Blazing Saddles did it to the western. Airplane! did it to the disaster flick. Scary Movie did it to the horror film. And now, it's time for independent films to get what they've got comin' to 'em."" Ok? Now watch the trailer and you'll know precisely what to expect if you ever have a bunch of film geeks on your hands looking to imbibe in the poisons of their choice and the movie of yours.

It never ventures below ankle-deep; doesn't need to. There's hardly a narrative arc to speak of; that's partly the point. It's just one damn gag after another. The best performances come from those who've decided to throw pride to the wind and leap in on all fours: Paget Brewster and Eric Hoffman, definitely; and let me tell you, Neil Hopkins's Christopher Walken is alone worth the price of admission.",1140480000,3,894,4.552795031055901
2431299,5,B000BO0KUA,"Whoever wrote a review claiming this movie was a rip-off of DATE MOVIE has obviously drunk the Kool-Aid. Let's set the record straight. MY BIG FAT INDEPENDENT MOVIE came first; it was screening at film festivals almost a year before DATE MOVIE was released. Also, DATE MOVIE is obviously not a spoof of independent films, and it doesn't claim to be. Get your facts straight!

On top of all that, DATE MOVIE isn't funny. I could hear crickets mating through the deadened silence in the theater. To the contrary, I laughed out loud and often during MY BIG FAT INDEPENDENT MOVIE. It combines smart parodies of many independent films with the standard potty-humor of modern spoofs, and it blends the styles pretty well.

The special features are endless. This DVD set includes 2 discs: DISC ONE= an UNRATED version of the movie with 3 audio commentary tracks and a text commentary track that you can watch with the movie as it gives you funny insights into the making of the film and educates you on independent film trivia.

2431300,5,B000BO0KUA,"I don't think the people comparing this movie to DATE MOVIE have actually seen DATE MOVIE. Newsflash, it blows! I could hear crickets mating through the deadened silence in the theater. To the contrary, I laughed out loud and often during MY BIG FAT INDEPENDENT MOVIE. It combines smart parodies of many independent films with the standard potty-humor of modern spoofs, and it blends the styles pretty well.

BEWARE: If you haven't seen any the movies being spoofed there will be fewer laughs for you, but if you like indies this is the only definitive parody of the genre.

HINT: Purchase the 2-disc UNRATED version. It's got some added scenes and a whole 2nd disc of special features that alone are worth the purchase price.",1140307200,,726,4.8
2431301,5,B000BO0KUA,"This movie is worth picking up. Its just one of those funny movies, if your the type that has to have meat to the movie, then its not for you. However a little funny meaningless movie is good every once in awhile.

It is definitely abundant with the cool. I was at Best Buy today and they just got a new shipment in. The box has a bookflap with a velcro seasl that opens to show the some of the cooler shots including a Mewes picture with a thought bubble about how he likes fatties (typical Jay).

2431302,5,B000BO0KUA,"This movie is the only film of its kind, spoofing independent films with the same fervor as Scary Movie or Not Another Teen Movie, but with one major difference-- this movie is spoofing films that are highly regarded (maybe unfairly so) as untouchable works of art. It's job is to remind indie films and the fans who love them that they are not above lambasting. This movie has guts, and it does what most independent comedies fail to do-- it generates laughs.",1139875200,6,460,4.621951219512195
2431303,5,B000BO0KUA,"Philip Zlotorynski and his film, My Big Fat Independent Movie accomplished the humor and wit that the Scary Movie trilogy attempted and failed. This movie is one of the better spoofs that have been created to date. Zlotorynski's knowledge of the indie genre is apparent in this film's plot, which spoofs a variety of the biggest films in the indie genre.

The main storyline is a mixed up version of Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Though we first are introduced to the film's protagonists in a spoof of the naming sequence of Reservoir Dogs, the resemblance of Harvey and Mr. Fuchsia to Pulp Fiction's John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson is unmistakable. The plot of the two films becomes even more intertwined when the audience is told that they are on a journey to an empty warehouse for a robbery (they are supposed to steal a suitcase). Zlotorynski even included the famous cutting of the police officer's ear scene from Reservoir Dogs. As a huge Tarantino fan, I was impressed with the director and author's brilliant portrayal of these two favorites.

Though Tarantino's works are some of the best in the indie genre, My Big Fat Independent Movie would not have been as good without the intrusion of Memento into the plot. Leonard Shelby was the perfect choice for an antagonist and possible foil to the robbery plans of Harvey and his cohorts. Staying true to the plot of Memento, Leonard's character still has little memory and recollection of his past, and is still in search of revenge through his tattoos and photographs. However, this time he believes that Harvey is involved in the murder of his wife. I loved the part in which Johnny has the same pictures as Leonard because they came with his wallet.

Also, one could not discuss this film without mentioning Zlotorynski's use of Pi, though in an extremely distorted fashion. I was upset with the distance in which the director traveled from Pi's plot in his spoof, but that didn't stop me from laughing. Instead of trying to decode the stock exchange and find a number that controls the universe, Maximillian is looking for the secret of the perfect corned beef sandwich recipe. I wish the electric drill gun scene could somehow have been added and spoofed as well in the film.

Lastly, other films that were alluded to in the My Big Fat Independent Movie are Amelie, Run Lola Run, The Good Girl and My Big Fat Greek Wedding, of course. This film is perfect for anyone who loves the indie genre and films in general. Even a non-indie person will laugh throughout the feature due to Zlotorynski's wonderful directing and the writing genius of Chris Gore.",1139875200,3,2633,4.78021978021978
2431304,5,B000BO0KUA,"If you love indie films like Pulp Fiction, Memento, Amelie, Pi, Clerks, Swingers, El Mariachi -- then this is the ultimate comedy!  The opening scene and the cartoon title sequence alone are worth the price of admission.  Plus cameos by Bob Odenkirk, Clint Howard, Pauly Shore and Julie Strain are cool too.  See this movie for what it is -- a fun comedy that doesn't take itself seriously!  Don't believe the haters.  Some people do not have a sense of humor when it comes to their precious art films being spoofed -- get over it!  This is destined to be a cult classic.",1139702400,2,571,4.495145631067961
2431305,5,B000BO0KUA,"NOTE TO READERS- the other user that wrote a review of this movie in my name is an imposter. Here's the REAL DEAL--

Anchor Bay treats the film like an indie classic. The transfer is sharp and clear, and the digital blood effects come off nicely. My Big Fat Independent Movie was shot in HD digital video, so everything looks amazingly polished. The surround sound is punchy, and the climatic shoot-out delivers the appropriate bombast. The ""making of"" featurette is a lot of fun. There's a trailer that is remarkably well cut, and pretty dang funny (they knew where the best jokes are). Click on the guns of the hit men in the special features menu, and you'll find an Easter Egg featuring Jason Mewes recording his part as the ""Swinger's"" answering machine.

The Video:

Presented in a very sharp 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, My Big Fat Independent Movie looks absolutely great with cinematographer Scott Peck's images popping off the screen. Slick and free of any trace of a blemish, this is a sterling visual representation.

The Audio:

A very active Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is included, with an immersive soundfield and clearly heard dialogue. The effects and score don't intrude upon the rapid-fire exchanges, with the occasional gunplay given surprisingly robust life. Dolby 2.0 stereo is also on board.",1139097600,2,1326,5.009090909090909
8089952,1,B000BO0KUA,"I came across a favorable reference to this movie and was hoping for something stupid but fun.  Instead I got a one-note ""comedy"" whose only joke was, ""look how aware we are of all of these movie tropes.""  My expectations were pretty low, but I'm frankly surprised I made it to the end.",1499731200,,286,4.377358490566038

8089955,1,B000BO0KUA,"The most stupids and low quality movies ever.
I have seen very low budjet movies, but the quality of theme and acting was good.
Not even funny",1383955200,,142,4.296296296296297
8089956,5,B000BO0KUA,This is an excellent spoof of some of the more popular independent films. It's humor is based on bad puns and low-brow jokes (as are most parodies) but it executes them well. I'm always a big fan of Paget Brewster and I know Darren Keefe personally so this movie gets 5 stars!,1358985600,,276,4.326923076923077
8089957,2,B000BO0KUA,"Why is it nowadays producers find the need to spoof good movies? That's all this film does in an attempt to be funny. I was already taken back in the beginning when they started off by making fun of Pulp Fiction, one of the greatest movies ever. I'm all for making fun of Bring It On and such but leave the great films alone.
What I don't understand is in order to even understand most of the films they mock, the viewer would have to be in their mid-twenties yet the humor is that of a middle-schooler. Either society is dumbing down with age or the younger are getting old way too fast. The only reason it gets two stars is in hope that whoever watches this will go out and rent the films this ""movie"" trashed on.",1205020800,,715,4.188405797101449
8089958,5,B000BO0KUA,"The most surprising thing about My Big Fat Independent Movie is that no one had made it sooner. Crammed full of every clich it can lay it's hands on, and openly disparaging of every independent movie made from Pulp Fiction to Run Lola Run its crude, disgusting, full of sexual innuendo, stupid dialogue, foul language and is hysterically funny from beginning to end.

Oh sure it's as subtle as a brick wall and as intellectually challenging as professional wrestling, but that's half the fun. Billing itself as the lowbrow comedy for the highbrow crowd, it makes no pretensions to being anything more than a brilliantly stupid movie. High art this isn't and thank goodness for that.

Like a scythe in a cheap horror movie it cuts everything down in size so no ones a head and shoulders above anyone. All your favourites are seen minus their aspirations to art hood. Oh sure some of the jokes are more stupid than funny, but that's to be expected when you're shooting target practice with a grenade launcher. You'll blow everything up, but stuff is bound to be a little messy around the edges.

In case you were wondering, there is a plot to this movie, mainly useful for bringing in the stunning variety of clichs and allusions to other movies that pepper the film, but it does provide a semblance of structure for the fun. Two thugs Sam (Neil Barton) and Harvey (Eric Hoffman) are sent to Las Vegas by their employer to botch a robbery of a suitcase.

On their way, they are supposed to pick up a guy with a guitar case full of weapons. Unfortunately, he has a tragic encounter with a semi-trailer while engaged in conversation with a French girl, Anomalie (Ashley Head) who just wants to make everyone happy. (If their idea of happiness is winding up dead in horrific accidents than she does a bang up job)

Instead, they pick up a guy with a trombone case, with a trombone in it; Johnny Vince (Darren Keefe) He's happy to go along because he's still recovering from breaking up with his girl friend, who he went out with twice five years ago. What with the restraining order and all, it's been difficult to try and get back together with her, and the lure of Las Vegas irresistible to the want to be hep-cat.

What independent movie would be complete without the confused and disillusioned woman who just can't be happy with her lot in life? With that in mind, they kidnap Julianne (Paget Brewster) after some really gratuitous violence in a grocery store. Julianne is so confused that she can't decide if her husband ignored her because he lusted after the male black gardener, or if she was dissatisfied with the life of being waited on hand and foot by a devoted husband.

As they continue along on their trip they stop for lunch at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant (the highest grossing independent restaurant ever), run over a German woman jogging, and meet up with the Lanky Man (Neil Hopkins doing a remarkable impression of Christopher Walken) who has the key to the warehouse where they are supposed to botch the robbery.

He also has the key to their obligatory fantasy scenes, until he gets so disgusted with the clichs involved he throws them all out. One of the sillier aspects, but still nicely done, of the movie is having the characters commenting on the ""independent"" aspects of what's happening in the scene. Whether it's choosing appropriately ironic music for a torture sequence, or deciding on the best way to get the audience to relate to your anti-hero psychotic tendencies, they're very concerned about ensuring that they make the grade.

Along with two sub plots; a trio of Hassidic hit men intent on discovering the formulae for the ideal corn beef sandwich, and a guy who can't remember anything except Kenny G. is responsible for his wife's death, our companions finally make it to the warehouse. After the obligatory surreal dance sequence, the final showdown can take place. Suffice to say it's just what you'd expect, but more.

My Big Fat Independent Movie is stupid, inane, pointless and howling funny. It is obviously made by people who are both fans of independent movies and who are aware of how contradictory that term is becoming. To genuinely appreciate this movie, it will help if you've seen the movies they're teasing. I'm sure part of the fun for some people will be trying to identify the thirty or more features referred to in the movie.

Watching Pauly Shore getting his head blown off with what looked like a rocket launcher, and Jason Mewes as a sex starved answering machine are just added bonuses to this delightfully intelligent, stupid movie.",1143417600,3,4592,4.7203495630461925
8089959,5,B000BO0KUA,"Where My Big Fat Independent Movie really excels is by pulling elements from some very serious dramas and showing how comical they are when tweaked outside of their original contexts. Adding extra kick is the spot-on mimicry of the original films' visual styles that Zlotorynski is able to pull off with efficient shorthand that should tickle the knowledgeable film buffs who've seen the originals.

While the bulk of the humor may be accessible to those who have watched the IFC or Sundance channels occasionally, I should stress that if you don't know which movie had four simultaneous pictures running in quadrants onscreen or where the idea that dream sequences can't happen without a midget was lifted, you may be wondering why your nerdy film geek pals are giggling and you aren't. (To be fair, if you hadn't seen Signs, 8 Mile and The Ring you wouldn't have laughed much at Scary Movie 3 either.) If you find yourself scratching your head too often, that just means you've got some good movies to catch up on.

Unless you're a chin-stroking killjoy who takes their cinema too seriously, you should definitely find some big fat laughs in My Big Fat Independent Movie.",1141084800,,1173,4.86
8089960,1,B000BO0KUA,"I so wanted to like this movie and was looking forward to enjoying a good spoof parody film in the genre of SCARY MOVIE or NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE.  But this film was not one tenth as funny as these examples.  SM and NATM are not great films but they do make me laugh and are better than other similar films like HOTSHOTS, AIRPLANE and POLICE ACADEMY.  I was expecting something within the same ball park from BIG FAT INDEPENDENT MOVIE.  It's seems in theory that this premise could work.  Make fun of all the independent movies of the last 10 to 15 years.  But this was crap because of the lame actors and terrible script which inevitably means bad direction as well.",1140998400,3,667,4.382113821138211
8089961,1,B000BO0KUA,"Disingenuously selling itself as a clever spoof of recently popular independent movies, this film is instead a vile, sophomoric, and idiotic waste of time.  The R rating is, unfortunately, a totally insufficient warning of the crud that marches across the screen from the opening scene, when the viewer, without warning, becomes witness to a male-male scene of simulated anal sex...and goes down hill from there.  Obviously geared for the crude tastes of middle-school bad boys, this mess is an insult to viewers of all ages.",1140652800,8,525,5.1647058823529415
