5838715,5,B00DON8NHM,"There was a great deal of political paranoia to be found in the cinema of the 1970's. To films in particular epitomize that era. Alan J. Pakula's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and Sydney Pollack's THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR are two films in particular that capture and preserve that moment in time. Robert Redford stars in both films and his approach to both characters in each film seems initially like one of indifference with a dash of naivet, but once drawn in he becomes very self reliant. Dustin Hoffman's character in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is more seasoned and cynical and welcomes the confrontation and must bring it to fruition.
THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a complex suspenseful political thriller directed by Sydney Pollack. A shroud of relentless paranoia permeates the entire film from beginning to end. It is set primarily in New York City and Washington DC and this adds to the drama in a very credible way. Robert Redford is a CIA research reader. He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with. Things go very wrong and he soon finds that he is a man on the run and he is a target. Why? That is what he has to find out and turn his situation around if he can. Besides Robert Redford, the cast includes Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Patrick Gorman and Max von Sydow. Redford's character is full of energy and once he directs that energy for his very survival, he becomes a very formidable player in the world of covert affairs. Interestingly, Max von Sydow has such a subtle yet incredibly powerful screen presence. On screen he effortlessly puts Robert Redford's energy and daring aside with such ease that you will be amazed. Max von Sydow's performance is brilliant and he steals every frame of this film that he is in. And on another note, Sydney Pollack once more proves he was on of the cinema's best directors.
ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a very compelling movie. From a historical perspective it is still as fresh as this morning's headlines. I prefer historical films where there is some measure of morality of the participants of events of note to the American experience, and that is sure to be found in this film. At times this seems more like a film with some political message and agenda, but in reality it is simply a tale of unraveling the truth. Ironically, I do not find a strong sense of right or wrong concerning the motives of the main characters. For them, getting the story at anyone cost seems to be their objective, their motivation. The very story they wish to prove and propagate is very political, but still it is about reporting the truth. Hoffman's performance is riveting and believable. Redford is subtle and somewhat humorously stoic. Hoffman and Redford make an incredible team, visually and in every other respect. The direction, cinematography and editing are flawless. Overall, this film genre that was so prevalent in 1970s opened the door both cinematically and in the real political arena for citizens to ask the tough questions of their elected and appointed officials. But, once those questions are answered, doubt still remains it always will.
Modern thinking, from a political perspective, will never return to what it was before the decade of the 1970s partly in thanks to THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. These two films changed the way we viewed the world.",1379289600,5,3499,4.766062602965404

5838730,5,B00DON8NHM,"At the current advertised price it is an excellent value.  The movies come on separate discs.  You get more bonus features with ATPM than with TDOTC.  The visual quality/transfers are very good considering the age of the movies.

My only nitpick, however, is with Faye Dunaway's character in ""Condor"".  Turns out her character is largely inconsequential to the plot.  Her character could be removed completely and the film would not suffer.  I suppose the film, when first made and released, stood a better chance of box office success if a second major star were in it and offered Robert Redford's character a brief love interest.  Fine.  I'm okay with that.  That's the movie business.  But from a structural point of view her character was disposable.  My guess is that her Kathy Hale character gave Redford's character someone to talk to and toss out some plot exposition for the audience's sake.

It wasn't bad writing, though.  Still a good film.  But upon reflection, Dunaway got short-changed.",1471046400,,1001,4.9818181818181815

5838741,5,B00DON8NHM,"I bought this double pack to replace my DVD copy of 3 Days Of The Condor. I've always loved the movie--especially Max von Sydow's suave menace--but always wished the transfer didn't look so grainy and washed-out.

I'm happy to say this Blu-ray of ""Condor"" is a huge visual improvement over the DVD version. To quote other reviewers, it's a great movie made even greater.

All The Presidents Men, however, looks even better. The movie was shot by Gordon Willis. It showcases his taste for dark, saturated colors and ample use of shadow areas. The film has a slight graininess that gives the rich, warm colors a painterly softness.  Redford and Hoffman are great, William Goldman's screenplay has the same propulsion as an action movie, and the many veteran character actors all hit their marks.

The conspiracy paranoia expressed in the movie seems dated to most of us, but healthy skepticism of our government is always in style (as it should be). The only real problem with the movie is that director and writer assume we know all about the major events and major players in the Watergate scandal. If you've seen Oliver Stone's Nixon and J.F.K, you should be ok.",1453593600,,1163,4.8

5838744,5,B00DON8NHM,"I've always meant to buy ""All the President's Men"" on dvd (and probably wanted it on vhs before that, lol), but I'm glad that I waited for the blu ray. Wow, how great it is to see this terrific film in such stellar quality. I bought a (Sony) blu ray player last year for $80 and it was a great decision.

You know, I'm sure, that ATPM is the story of the two reporters that broke the Watergate story and from what I've read (interviews with Woodward, for one) the movie is very true to history. Hoffman and Redford are perfect.

I'm not as enamored of ""Three Days of the Condor"" but it's still a pretty decent mystery. Sometimes though Robert Redford is just to, I don't know, too Robert Redford and I sometimes felt like I was watching him and not the character. But still, a very fine movie and worth owning.

To get both of these films together for an insanely cheap price? Unreal. Now all I need is a 60"" TV to watch them on. :) Buy these if you like either film, you will be glad you did.",1448928000,,993,4.161458333333333

5838746,3,B00DON8NHM,"This Blu-ray disc set, consisting of the films All the Presidents Men and 3 Days of the Condor, is proof positive that one-for-two aint all bad

Let me explain.

On the plus side is All the Presidents Men, the Academy Award-winning film from 1976 that stars Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Robards, Jr. This superb film tells the dramatic true story of how two Washington Post reporters  Bob Woodward (Redford)  and Carl Bernstein (Hoffman)  investigate and uncover the Watergate affair  in 1972-1974.  Although a bit slow moving at times, All the Presidents Men,  is always tense, taut, and thrilling. I watch this film frequently, and never fail to become totally engrossed as Woodstein slowly but surely unravel what became the single biggest political scandal in American history.  All the Presidents Men is one of my all-time favorite films, and should not be missed.

On the flip side is 3 Days of the Condor, a cinematic work of fiction from 1975 that stars Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway, Max von Sydow, and Cliff Robertson. Its a spy story wherein a CIA analyst named Joseph Turner steps out of one of  The Companys clandestine offices in New York City, buys lunch, and returns only to discover that, while he was out, everyone in the office has been shot dead. Fearing that the unknown killer (or killers) will return, Turner goes on the run and eventually finds himself holed up in an apartment with an attractive middle-aged woman named Kathy Hale.

As the bad guys (predictably) search throughout the city for Turner, and his CIA handlers (predictably)  try to talk him into coming in, Turners relationship with Hale (predictably) turns from downright hostility, to civility, to a (predictable) romp between the sheets

Need I say more?

3 Days of the Condor could have been a very good spy thriller if the writers had written a script that was taut, tense, and thrilling; and if the actors had acted like this was a taut, tense, and thrilling spy movie instead of a sleepy, soapy melodrama that just happened to include spies and hit men in it. I watched this film once, and said to myself, never again.

Like I said, one-for-two aint all bad

Buy this set if youd like to see Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway together in a movie, or are just  interested in a bargain; otherwise, I recommend you stick to All the Presidents Men only  on Blu-ray or Amazon Video.",1446768000,2,2382,4.765853658536585

The movie has not lost its relevance in the age of spying, counter-spying, double agents.
