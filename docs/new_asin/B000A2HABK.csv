2350618,5,B000A2HABK,My dad loved getting this collection...he is a huge bonanza fan and had a great time reminiscing on old episodes,1209340800,,112,4.65
2350619,5,B000A2HABK,I enjoyed this collection very much. Used to watch this series as a little girl! All of the episodes I don't remember ever watching. I give it 5 stars.,1181174400,,151,4.241379310344827
2350620,5,B000A2HABK,"While many reviewers are awarding low marks for this edition, please keep in mind that Bonanza itself is 5 star viewing no matter how it is packaged.  If all you have is home-taped versions of Bonanza, by all means buy any and every DVD of Bonanza you can get your hands on.  Whether you buy this edition of 15 or the full 31 public issue episodes is up to you. Just remember that it's Bonanza and TV doesn't get much better than that.",1170201600,10,435,4.228915662650603
2350621,1,B000A2HABK,"...I have it and it's great! The original music, etc. Of course, there is an English option so it is just like watching an American version (except there is no American Season One!).

The menu, though in German, is easy to navigate. Of course, all the sound, etc, is in the original English if you choose the English option.

Just saw episode one: classic! Just wonderful.",1140220800,27,372,4.621212121212121
2350622,1,B000A2HABK,"For those of you, who have an all region dvd-player go to AMAZON.de (Germany) there you will find the complete !!! first season with 32 episode digitally picture and sound remastered and w i t h  the original theme song !!!! Wonderful. It is in German and English, so no problem.",1138406400,59,279,4.470588235294118
2350623,1,B000A2HABK,"If having the correct Bonanza theme music is important to your enjoyment of the episodes, don't buy this. The theme is replaced by different music. I've read elsewhere that the rights to the music and the episodes are separate, so cheap versions have replacement music. This is one such cheap version.",1135468800,70,301,4.921568627450981
2350624,1,B000A2HABK,"Thank you for providing the info.  I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out what episodes were included....you are correct, just a rehash of previously released.  Would also love to get more episodes.  Maybe someday.",1134432000,22,215,5.085714285714285
2350625,1,B000A2HABK,"I'm giving this set 1 star, because the item description doesn't give detail on show titles. I really would love to get my hands on more Bonanza episodes, however, this set is just a repeat of previously released Bonanza shows on dvd sets/collection :o(

Good thing I did my homework before purchasing (and of course I WILL NOT be purchasing this one, as I have the 20 Best Episodes and Best of vol. 1), may I recommend that you please do the same (check the titles BEFORE buying this set)...to save you some time and money and FRUSTRATION, I've posted ALL of the show titles for FOUR popular and separate Bonanza sets/collections on dvd.

2350665,2,B000A2HABK,"This set covers probably the second half of the Season One, and the first episodes of Season Two, which have fallen into the public domain. Paramount didn't renew copyright. The reason for the music isn't the original, is that Paramount keeps its rights over this music. These episodes have been released by many different companies in different configurations and sometimes with substandard picture and sound quality, and by legal necessity with the copyright protected theme song replaced with generic western music. I'd rather buy ""Bonanza The Complete First Season/Second Season"" Value Pack, I have all seasons until Sixth, Best available picture and sound, with the original Bonanza Song.",1393372800,,693,5.425925925925926

2350679,5,B000A2HABK,A gift for my In-Laws. They loved keeping up with Cartright's (not sure about the spelling) and all the activities on the Ponderosa. This keeps them entertained for hours on end. Discs were in great shape and packing was superior. Great seller.,1386374400,,244,4.833333333333333

These should each contain ALL that seasons episodes arranged in the order that they ran the first time. Why should we pay for multiple copies of discs with the same episodes on them.

2350704,3,B000A2HABK,"I'm 21 years old and have grown up watching old westerns such as Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Laramie, Big Valley and Wagon Train. Out of those five, Bonanza is my second favorite (Gunsmoke is my first). I have a lot of Bonanza DVD's and all of them have episodes the others have. As much as I like Bonanza, I will not buy anymore DVD's unless they are season sets or have different episodes. This set has the same exact episodes that all of the other Bonanza DVD's that have been released in the past have. I don't understand why they keep releasing the same episodes over and over again. All they are doing is changing the covers of the DVD cases.

Now if there is someone who doesn't have these episodes, let me tell you they are great episodes and you won't regret buying them. But if you are like me, who have these episodes on other sets, then don't waste your money.

I give Bonanza five stars and usually I give the DVD's that have been released five stars. This one I am giving three stars because of the fact that these episodes are already out there on numerous Bonanza sets.

They need to start with the seasons sets now and if for what ever reason they can't do season sets, I understand but at least release different episodes that people don't have.",1242691200,42,1254,4.396551724137931
