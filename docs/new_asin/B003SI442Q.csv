8593442,5,B003SI442Q,"I saw this film online and thought it was excellent.  It gets a great review.  The photography was incredible, and it preserves part of a culture that is now gone.  I was excited to purchase a copy for myself, but I cannot play the DVD because it is protected by a region code.  This is the first time I have encountered that restriction.  I did not see any mention of that in the description.  Now I won't buy DVDs unless I know they can be played in my region.  While the film gets a great review (online), I cannot rate the DVD since access is prohibited.",1434067200,,558,4.2075471698113205
