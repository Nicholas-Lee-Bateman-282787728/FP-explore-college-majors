8082564,5,B000B6TMYI,"This movie was made over 50 years ago, but the DVD version has the same clarity of visual and sound detail as the original. I am glad I purchased it because Tyrone Power and Maureen O'Hara are top-notch Hollywood stars -- and this movie shows them at their best. This is also a true story about a man who was part of a great institution (West Point) and saw it evolve from the turn of the century up to the end of the great World Wars. And he trained generation after generation of Cadets who became the country's military leaders! A beautiful story and a hi-tech recording -- what more can you ask for?",1336694400,,603,4.298245614035087
8082565,5,B000B6TMYI,"A wonderfully told, true  tale of a West Point man who was not a graduate, but one who spent his his entire adult life shaping and molding the men who shaped the course of America's military history. No fancy special effects or unnecessary subplots, solid acting from a veteran cast that will bring a tear or two when you least expect it.",1252454400,,338,4.451612903225806

A lot of Irish sentiment. Good to see some members of the John Ford Stock
company like Maureen O'Hara, Ward Bond, Harry Carey jr. et all. Entertaining but at times a bit corny.",1220400000,,436,8.71111111111111
8082569,4,B000B6TMYI,"A fine film by John Ford that is know for its sentiment rather than its action.  Tyrone Power protrays Marty Maher, an Irish immigrant who ends up as an enlisted instructor at West Point.  Maureen O'Hara play the woman he marries.  The story is about their relationship over a 50 year period with West Point as the back drop.  Many true historical figures are played or mentioned in the story.  As in ""The Quiet Man"", John Ford is more interested in the story of his two lead characters than fights or war action.  There are quite a few moments of humor and drama just as in one's own life.  Tyrone Power and Maureen O'Hara really shine in this story.  Look for Ford regulars like Ward Bond, Donald Crisp and Harry Carey Jr. in supporting roles.  If you like a well told story of people you would like to know, this is a great movie to watch",1138579200,8,841,4.339743589743589
