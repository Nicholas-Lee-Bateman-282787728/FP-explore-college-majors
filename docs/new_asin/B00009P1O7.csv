8431809,4,B00009P1O7,"World Almanac presents three outstanding VHS documentaries covering the Big Bang creation theory of the universe, creation of the solar system, and search for extra-terrestial life.  Presented in a dramatic fashion that vividly captures the awe of creation and the mind-boggling expansion of the universe, these tapes depict the unfolding science through cosmologists who tell the story of mankind's search for sense in the heavens. It explains basic concepts, like the Doppler effect, in an easy to understand and concise manner. I am not a scientist, but as a person with lifelong interest in outer-space, I rate this product as an ""A,"" and highly recommend it for persons with a general interest.
