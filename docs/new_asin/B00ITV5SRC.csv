6297167,2,B00ITV5SRC,"Hate WB has gone down this path.  This is probably the last Platinum Collection.  I don't understand why WB cannot get their act together and release all of the cartoons.  I wouldn't care if they were not remastered, since money to bring the cartoons into the HD world seems to be the issue with releasing these cartoons.  I would be happy to buy standard def sets if WB would release them all.",1406764800,12,394,4.430555555555555
6297168,4,B00ITV5SRC,"(Revised Aug. 5, 2014)

Noticed that the correction was made about the cartoon ""A Ham in a Role"" (Goofy Gophers cartoon).
WB Home Entertainment is FINALLY releasing Sylvester's cartoon debut, ""Life with Feathers"" (1945) on DVD! His debut has been conspicuous by its absence. The debuts of almost _every_ other WB cartoon star have been available on DVD for quite some time, including those of Bosko and Buddy! Now it's finally ""Thylvethter'th"" turn. (His second cartoon, ""Peck Up Your Troubles,"" is also excellent, but don't hold your breath.)
""Pigs in a Polka"" (1943), with the Three Little Pigs, is also a parody of Disney's ""Fantasia,"" as is ""A Corny Concerto"" from later on that same year. Both are outstanding.
""Dog Gone South"" (1950) features Charlie Dog... finally bothering somebody besides poor Porky. (""Little Orphan Airedale"" - not on DVD, ""Awful Orphan,"" and ""Often an Orphan."" Charlie goes to Italy in ""A Hound for Trouble"" (1951)... That one's on DVD in the Doris Day Collection Vol. 2, with ""On Moonlight Bay."")
""Honey's Money"" (1962) is the only cartoon in which Yosemite Sam stars on his own. There is only one other cartoon with Sam in which he does not appear with Bugs: ""Along Came Daffy"" (1947). Not on DVD. (In that one, door-to-door salesman Daffy encounters _two_ starving Yosemite Sams in a snowed-in cabin! One has dark hair.)
Maybe some of these ancillary comments will encourage WBHE to make some more cartoons available. (Like how about some more Porkys, huh?)",1404000000,11,1489,4.979919678714859
6297169,4,B00ITV5SRC,"WB, If you wonder why these sets are not selling try releasing at least half new content on these sets.  the list of actually great shorts that are still yet to be released is appalling.  The cartoons look great on volume one and two.  better than the golden collections.  it's  really a shame that we collectors keep having to shell out money for the same shorts every couple of years.

I never bought the Academy Award set so this will be a good chance for those, like me to collect the missing gems from that release but now in HD.",1402963200,38,534,4.29
6297170,4,B00ITV5SRC,These are Looney Tunes so they are inherently great fun and the audiovisual quality of the cartoons is excellent. My only issue is that there are a lot of cartoons recycled from earlier collections.,1401667200,16,198,4.852941176470588

The feeling is as fresh today as it was originally even though I wasn't born when these classics were created.

6297197,4,B00ITV5SRC,"Great collection of classic Looney Tunes cartoons. These are the ones that many adults grew up with as children and probably still remember fondly (as we do.) We bought them for our daughter because we feel that the quality of the animation, voice acting (Mel Blanc!!) and classical music soundtracks put these far ahead of most contemporary children's cartoons. Along those lines, it is worth mentioning that these were not meant as children's cartoons when they were produced, and contain material that some might find inappropriate and not politically correct today. Quite frankly, those are also reasons why we wanted our daughter to see them; the ethnic caricaturing that occurs in some episodes is portrayed in good fun (in the eyes of the day) and so presents opportunities both for laughter and for teaching. She will hopefully understand why these portrayals were considered by audiences to be acceptable at the time and also why they generally would not be today.

I would give 5 stars but for the fact that there are no Tex Avery cartoons included, for whatever reason.",1458432000,4,1080,5.0

6297236,5,B00ITV5SRC,"Before a review or critique of these cartoons can be made, the viewer of this material MUST grasp 2 facts about the material:
1) The content was NEVER intended for Children to be the main audience. A lot of (mis-directed) criticism has been thrown towards Warner Bros. for the violence and racial comedy in these cartoons. Although the cartoons are (mostly) appropriate for all ages, the original intended audience was the adult American movie goer. These cartoons were created to be shown at the movie theater, on the big screen, before the main show. it was in the 1940's, 50's & 60's considered to be part of an 'evenings entertainment"" at the cinema.
2) To ""whitewash"" or to pretend that some of the material is obviously racially insensitive and abusive is to ""whitewash"" and ignore the reality of American culture of the time period when these films were created. America at that time was a racist and segregateonal society. This is an undisputable fact and any attempt to downplay or ignore this is an affront to the victims of the abuse.
Racism is wrong, has always been wrong,
But to act as if it has never existed in our culture is even more wrong, it's insulting.

With that out of the way, this wonderful collection of cartoons has to be among the greatest film treasures for ANY fan of comedy. If you are from my age group (mid-30's) then you will no doubt recall some of these cartoons from your Saturday mornings.
When I was young, these cartoons was hilarious. As an adult, the same cartoons are even more funny, and for all different reasons. The ""gang from termite terrace"" were some very funny and clever fellows, and it shows all through this collection.
The blue-ray HD quality of the films is AMAZING. Especially when you compare it side by side to the old TV Show quality. Breathtaking.

And did I mention that these cartoons are SOOOO FUNNY!!!! I am looking forward to sharing these treasures with my newborn son when the time is right, and hopefully, my grandchildren in the future.
In contrast to the garbage that is released as ""comedy"" in modern times, these cartoons are actually FUNNY and will make you LAUGH.",1410739200,38,2139,4.701333333333333
6297237,4,B00ITV5SRC,Excellent extras in this set which is the main reason I bought it.  Every cartoon had previously been released in at least one Golden Collection but having them on Blu-Ray improves the quality.,1410739200,,193,4.848484848484849
6297238,4,B00ITV5SRC,"This would have gotten five stars, but for the fact that all the cartoons had been released in other collections.

6297243,5,B00ITV5SRC,"Blu-ray buyers should be aware that this is a 2-disc set, not 3-discs as listed on Amazon.
Of course, I may have received a bogus edition.  Please confirm that Volume 3 is two discs.
Thanks",1409011200,2,189,4.4
6297244,5,B00ITV5SRC,"Another Great Platinum Collection! I love these Looney Tunes Blu-Ray collections, so I hope this isn't really the last volume and WB will publish more volumes!",1408665600,,159,5.153846153846154

6297246,5,B00ITV5SRC,"Great cartoons! My favorites,very enjoyable!!!!! Classic cartoons at best.watch these cartoons on t.v.,but they don't show them anymore. Buy these BluRays and watch them anytime!! Wha Who !!! That's All Folks!",1408233600,2,209,5.774193548387097
6297247,5,B00ITV5SRC,"These cartoons look amazing on blu ray in all their Technicolor glory.  The sound is also outstanding.  Best of all these cartoons are uncensored and unedited!  These cartoons are mini masterpieces and part of our cultural heritage.  I highly recommend all 3 Platinum Collection blu ray sets, as well as the Tom and Jerry Golden Collection Vol. 1 blu ray set.  Every cartoon on these collections is unedited and uncensored.  I just wish we had even more sets like these to purchase.  A complete Tex Avery set on blu ray is another wish I'd like to see someday.",1408060800,2,560,4.653061224489796
6297248,1,B00ITV5SRC,"Wow! This is the crappiest volume yet!...The first one was so deluxe, the second one wasn't as great as the first, but at least it had a 28-page booklet and high-quality slip-sleeve. This third one is crap...cheap paper-thin slip sleeve and a thin, twelve page booklet - and only three new shorts vs. the Golden Collections. And it cost as much or more than the others. Bad show, WB...you've lost this buyer! Worst one yet out of all the releases.",1407888000,7,447,4.6
6297249,4,B00ITV5SRC,"Picture and sound on the Blu-Rays are excellent. The rationale for including a particular cartoon on this collection appears to be (1) if it hasn't been included on the two previous Platinum Collection volumes; (2) if it was included in Jerry Beck's book from 2010 entitled ""The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes Cartoons"" (40 of these 50 are listed in Beck's book. Of course, so was ""Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs""...); and/or (3) if it was an Oscar nominee or winner. ""Knighty Knight Bugs"" makes its Blu-Ray debut here, but it has appeared on 5 different previous DVD collections (if you count the 2 different WB Oscar collections separately).  Still, these are great films worth owning; our friends at Warner Brothers continue to feel they're worth owning 3, 4, 5, 6 or more times! With over 400 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies yet to see the official-release light of day in the DVD era, including the long-delayed (forever?) so-called Censored Eleven, one does wonder at the long-term strategy at work here.",1407801600,12,1007,4.888888888888889
6297250,3,B00ITV5SRC,"It is a great pity that only a few shorts are new to home video, but I am buying this collection anyway. I want more Looney Tunes not previously seen on DVD or Blue Ray, I want the Bugs Bunny Show from the 60s (even in black and white in case it can't be restored), I want more black and white Looney Tunes on DVD or Blue Ray, I want all the seasons of The Sylvester and Tweety mysteries, I want controversial cartoons such as Bugs Bunny nips the nips, Tin Pan Alley cats, the Inki shorts, etc. (is it possible to release them through Warner Archive?), I want more Looney Tunes from the 60s, I want the animated shorts with Buddy, I want the Warner short with Grampaw Pettibone to be released on DVD or Blue Ray, I want Daffy Duck and Porky Pig meet the Groovie Ghoulies, I want the 1972 short A political cartoon with Bugs Bunny, I want the commercial Ounce of prevention with Bugs Bunny and more commercials with Looney Tunes (Nike commercials with Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny for example).",1407628800,13,994,4.349462365591398
