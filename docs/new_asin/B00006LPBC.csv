7971468,3,B00006LPBC,"Despite the fact that one of these (""Eyes Behind The Stars"") is not in wide circulation, the ALIEN WORLDS 4 Movie Pack has little to recommend it. Viewers have rated every movie here poorly. Scripts and acting tend to try your patience rather than entertain and the transfers are typically budget box quality. The first name of one of the actors here (Hoke) fairly well sums up what you're getting with this one.

A larger BRENTWOOD sci-fi package is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Final-Frontier/dp/B00018WMTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Final Frontier</a>. Got some good stuff on it, too!

None of these films are restored visually or have extras so don't expect too much and seem to be from possibly video dubs or film prints. 4 movies on 2 double sided discs.

3 of these movies are available in multiple other places: ""Alien Species"", ""Cosmos War Of The Planets""- see reviews elsewhere or IMDB for this one..quite (unintentionally?)funny with it's giant boxy evil robot terrorizing our good guy space travellers. The folks working behind the scenes on this one must have been in fits of laughter for the entire production.

Also we have ""Voyage To A Prehistoric Planet""-very good if only for pure nostalgia. This one played on TV allot in the late 60's/early 70's on late night ""Creature Feature"" type shows. I believe it never made it to theatres and is one of those Roger Corman type productions that uses footage from some foreign Sci-Fi movie with added footage of American actors Faith Domergue and Basil Rathbone (quite obviously) added in and was sold directly to TV in the late 60's before the days of cable. I believe the original source of most of the-rather impressive foreign footage was a big budget Soviet Sci-Fi movie from the early 60's which producer Roger Corman ""borrowed"" footage from to make at least 3 movies that I know of (including ""Queen Of Blood"" AKA ""Planet Of Blood"" with a very young Dennis Hopper). Hardly anything special but has great nostalgic value for me, as I spent many  late night Saturdays watching this one at 2 o'clock in the morning.

All 3 of these movies are readily availble elsewhere on budget sets like those mega-50 movie collections, etc.

My real reason for writing this however is quite simply to make note that the 4th movie on here, ""Eyes Behind The Stars"", an Italian flick from the ealy 70's, to the best of my knowledge, is not available elsewhere. It's hardly anything special , the print is very grainy with tons of speckling and at times even ghosts on the image that makes it look like it was recorded from an over the air TV brodcast in the days before cable. Still, this is another movie that played on TV in the NY City area (the local CBS station no less!) multiple times on late night weekends- another favoite to be caught at 2 a.m. It also has American actor Martin Balsam-who's voice is actually dubbed by another actor in English.

If you don't know the movie it's no diamond in the rough, that's for sure. But for others who already know the movie, this poorly dubbed UFO-mystery has a nostalgic value (again, like ""Voyage To A Prehistoric Planet"")and i'm glad to own a copy of it-as far from perfect as it is. For me it certainly is worth the budget price of this set.

But for many folks unfamiliar with these movies I would say this is an easy one to skip. I based my 3 star rating for nostalgic value only plus the fact that the earlier reviewers have rated this package so low..",1147478400,4,2983,4.595864661654136
7971470,1,B00006LPBC,"I bought this set thinking that at least one of the four movies would be worth watching, if only as a goof.  Some of these movies suffer from poor color transfers, all suffer from from lousy scripts and editing that seems to stretch every scene to its maximum length-- grueling.",1047254400,10,278,4.56
