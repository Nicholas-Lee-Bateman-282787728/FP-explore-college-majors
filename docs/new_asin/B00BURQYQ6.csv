8574192,5,B00BURQYQ6,"Once again the crew at Cirque Productions comes through and delivers an incredible story. They launched with their hit documentary Trek: A Journey on the Appalachian Trail and now they have delivered an equally inspiring story with Ride West. To see what this group of high schoolers, boy scouts and friends accomplished over a 10 week period is truly inspiring. By the time I finished watching it I literally want to go pull out my own bike and go for a ride. Not only did they accomplish an amazing feat but they did it for such a noble cause. Raising money for the UNC Lineberger Cancer center. If you are a fan of adventure travel, cycling videos, or just want to see an inspiring story of an amazing group of people that chased a dream. This is the video for you!!",1364947200,,769,4.460992907801418
