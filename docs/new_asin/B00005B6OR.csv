7936933,4,B00005B6OR,"My daghter is two years old and she can watch the Barney ABC video over and over again. In fact I think its a bit addictive. It has great educational value and she can now sing the ABC song. The focus is on the letters not on words or sounds which is great for a two year old. She doesnt love the ""Howdy friends"" video as much, She doesnt quite get the wild west concept, However the package was worth it for the ABC video.",993686400,4,423,3.988235294117647
