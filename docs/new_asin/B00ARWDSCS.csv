his orchestra became a world leader!",1397865600,,173,4.766666666666667
8557248,5,B00ARWDSCS,"Solti's life and work are the subject of this rather misleadingly-titled BBC documentary; while a few members of the London Philharmonic express frustration at Solti's lack of stick technique and/or being made to play ""like Americans"" instead of their British selves, throughout the film Solti himself emerges as an admirable, fascinating, and charismatic talent--and nothing like Mephisto.  Frankly, it's hard to find fault with someone so genuinely driven by a passion for music and excellence in its performance.  The film features a number of interviews, including many with the maestro himself filmed over a thirty year period up until just before his death.  Copious amounts of behind-the-scenes and performance footage give the viewer a fly-on-the-wall perspective of Solti's life, both on and off the podium.  Although it runs only an hour, this well-structured film is highly recommended for classical music and opera lovers.",1364515200,6,934,5.510489510489511
