5469412,3,B00AQ8IXRI,"Don't get me wrong, I love the show and used to watch it all the time when it was showing on local TV. It's the picture quality here that's just awful. If Amazon decides to upgrade it to HD then I will probably watch it, but till then....",1367020800,5,238,3.9791666666666665

5469414,4,B00AQ8IXRI,"These are from the 1970s or maybe early 1980s, and the filming shows it.  But they are nice to watch the birds and worth watching.",1365465600,,130,4.2

5469458,5,B00AQ8IXRI,An old PBS show which is still very good.  Highly recommended,1427587200,,61,4.545454545454546
5469459,5,B00AQ8IXRI,Very educational for children AND adults.,1427328000,,41,6.0
5469460,4,B00AQ8IXRI,"The photography is excellent and the subjects are interesting but 'm a little put off by Marty Stouffer's rather wooden narrative. I've watched the whole series, I just grimmice a little when he's on camera but the story line is well prepared and appears to be factual.",1426636800,,269,4.74468085106383

5469463,5,B00AQ8IXRI,My 4 year old son has learned so much from this show!!! Highly recommend it,1425081600,,75,4.066666666666666
5469464,5,B00AQ8IXRI,Great footage although a little dated (of course!) We like this series a lot!!!!,1424390400,,80,4.785714285714286
5469485,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"Something great from the 80s!  Marty Stouffer's entire ""Wild America"" series is fascinating in its breadth and depth of study of American Wildlife.  Yes, some of the unfortunate 80s fashions show up, and the series is a SD 4:3 TV format, but Marty shows us and teaches us much about the indigenous and imported species of wildlife that can be found in our own country.  Extremely good cinematography, too!  The information provided in this series is helping to inform my own wildlife photography, and I definitely appreciate that.  Thank you, PBS!",1420416000,,547,4.967032967032967
5469486,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"It is an excellent group of programs, although not quite as good as those done by the BBC.  As another reviewer noted, the picture quality would be much better in HD.",1416441600,,166,4.354838709677419
5469487,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"Great AM shows for kids before schoola nature program that stays on subject, and Marty is great",1414368000,,95,4.647058823529412
5469488,5,B00AQ8IXRI,A VERY good show!! Fun to watch and learn about birds I'm not used to seeing!,1413936000,,77,3.875
5469489,1,B00AQ8IXRI,Very disappointing.,1412640000,,19,9.0
5469490,4,B00AQ8IXRI,"It was well done, not as good of photography as BBC but it was fun to watch",1410393600,,75,3.4705882352941178
5469491,4,B00AQ8IXRI,"This is a series filmed in the late 70's, early 80's and is very generalized in the type of information presented. Nevertheless, the photography is gorgeous.  I picked it just to see if my cats would respond to it--and lo and behold, they love it. I enjoyed watching along with them, and watching their response to it. Marty Stouffer has a genial, easy going manner and nothing presented will be shocking or disturbing to young children [ I did skip the raptor episode].

If you are a crazy cat lady like me, and are looking for entertainment for your furkids, I recommend beginning with  the woodpecker episode. The cats seemed to love it best. Interestingly, when Marty comes on, they totally lose focus and begin to doze. Recommended for kids, of the two or four legged variety.",1408406400,,781,4.686131386861314
5469492,4,B00AQ8IXRI,Very interesting,1408060800,,16,7.5
5469493,2,B00AQ8IXRI,"I was hoping for a more in depth program.  It was nice to see the different types of hummingbirds, but I didn't think there was enough on any one species to really get a good picture.  Perhaps I just expected too much, and the idea was to get the viewer to do more research elsewhere.",1400716800,,284,4.1454545454545455
5469494,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"Even though this series is pretty old, it is awesome!! If you're a birder or love nature, this is a series you must not miss!! 5 stars!! I'd give it more stars if I could!! Marty Stouffer is a nature Rock Star!!! Watch any and all of the ""Wild America"" shows, you won't be disappointed!",1400284800,,286,4.218181818181818
5469495,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"I've just started watching this, but I know I will like it. I find birds to be extremely fascinating creatures.",1395360000,,111,4.6
5469496,5,B00AQ8IXRI,I was actually amazed at what I learned in watching some of the episodes. My young daughter has taken an interest in birds and bird watching so this came up in the recommendations during my search of instant videos. Little did I know I would be sucked in as well. We now plan to spend some time bird watching together as a family.,1394755200,,330,4.253968253968254
5469497,5,B00AQ8IXRI,All of Marty Stouffer's products are great for the classroom. I use this video during ornithology week. I am glad I can select only the episode I need and not have to buy an entire season or package.,1394668800,,199,4.2631578947368425
5469498,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"Thought this show would be interesting and it was but it turns out our cat loves to watch the birds, the episode I saw was all about woodpeckers. I never knew how many different ones there are.",1393632000,,193,4.243243243243243
5469499,4,B00AQ8IXRI,"Lots of great information. This was filmed many years ago and the music and intro are definitely from that time period but, still worth watching and learning.",1393372800,,158,4.888888888888889
5469500,4,B00AQ8IXRI,"These are older shows. Marty Stouffer was a main stay when I was younger. I am usually looking for nature shows to have on in the background for about 30min to an hour in the early evening since my young one loves the animal images. Stouffer definitely knows his stuff and there is a diverse amount of topics in the Wild America series. That being said don't expect new state of the art cinematography, and the topics and animals covered may not be all that relevant to today.",1390521600,,476,4.420454545454546
5469501,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"This is a beautiful collection. There are 2 disc's, 5 hours,10 episodes. My favorite when it comes to wild life is north american wild
life. Marty Stouffer does a excellent job presenting it. If you care for birds you will enjoy this collection.",1390348800,2,245,4.72093023255814
5469502,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"I'm on season three now, while I love them all, season two is so far my favorite!

I love all of God's creations, great and small, (well spiders don't always suit well with me) but birds have a very special spot in my heart.  While I have slowed down a bit, at one time you could count over a dozen feeders in my yard.  And I'm talking huge feeders. :)

Hummingbirds are one of the many species that fascinate me.  Actually, here in early January, I still have sugar-water feeders out.

If you love nature, or are just curious, watch this and all the series as you will find that even the most seasoned birder may just discover a few facts they didn't know, as I have.",1390003200,,668,4.2204724409448815
5469503,4,B00AQ8IXRI,It was a little older than I thought. I was hoping for more of a 2006 year of the video. It could  have shown more birds.,1389312000,,121,3.6538461538461537
5469504,4,B00AQ8IXRI,Very well made educational video. Good learning tool for improving understanding of nature. Photography is very good and well documented film,1388188800,,141,5.761904761904762
5469515,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"It is a great Bird video.  It is older, I don't recall the pub. date but it is stand-up-able.  Some of the information was new and exciting such as the thousands of woodpecker holes in giant trees in California ! Just SPECTACULAR ! ! !",1386288000,,235,4.2
5469516,5,B00AQ8IXRI,truly a well made doc.i will continue watching the series until i have seen them all.a well made doc. truly.,1380585600,2,108,4.45
5469517,5,B00AQ8IXRI,If you love birds as I do this is a must see program.  I've watched all the Wild America series they are wonderful for all ages.,1378339200,,128,3.923076923076923
5469518,4,B00AQ8IXRI,"I found the narrator/host's voice to be very irritating. It was hard to get past that, but the series, while nothing particularly new stood out for me, was full of beautiful birds. It was worth watching to see that.",1376092800,,215,4.538461538461538
5469519,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"The pictures are crisp and clear, you fee like you're in the areas with the birds.  Very informational as well.  For those who love creation this is a must!",1373587200,3,156,4.344827586206897
5469520,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"I loved how the focus stayed in the moment. Too often these days programming for children seems to jump all over, action packed and can make you feel dizzy. These shows are in the moment with each bird, teaching not only about the birds but also how to slow down and really watch the animals in real time.",1370649600,2,305,4.275862068965517
5469521,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"Let me tell you how fun to be able to watch Nature Shows at work on my lunch.  They are free with the Prime membership.  The system keeps track of where you stop so one is Abe to resume on the next lunch period.

This show is so awe inspiring that God has such Creatve talent.  I wish my bedroom had this type of color.",1369785600,4,319,3.8615384615384616
5469522,4,B00AQ8IXRI,Loved the different birds and the knowledge there was.  The background on where all these were taken was put together in a way that anyone could understand.,1369785600,,156,4.777777777777778
5469523,4,B00AQ8IXRI,Fun and educational.  A real pleasure to watch.  You find yourself being drawn into their beauty and fascinated by their life styles.  You will smile at their antics and sometimes laugh out loud.  Birds are indeed beautiful and this series does a wonderful job of highlighting our feathered friends.,1369008000,4,299,5.040816326530612
5469524,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"Since I am just a beginner bird watcher, I thoroughly
enjoyed the majestic beauty of these birds.  This
collection is so beautiful and worthwhile to view.

8556262,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"Great series that tells you all about the birds. There's an episode about,
Hummingbirds,
Nests,
Birds of prey,
Owls,
Ducks,
Bills,
Feathers,
Calls,
Woodpeckers,
And wild wings. Loved the series, when it was available.",1485216000,2,217,5.411764705882353
8556263,3,B00AQ8IXRI,Not the best show for kids.,1472774400,,27,3.6666666666666665
8556264,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"The second season on birds is truly a joy.  I always enjoy watching bird nature shows, and Marty certainly does not disappoint.  The Woodpecker episode is brilliance.  Do not let the dated-ness of this show stop you from watching.  If nothing else, the images of these wonderful creatures in our country should be enough to please any nature and bird lover!",1472688000,,357,4.80327868852459
8556265,5,B00AQ8IXRI,The hummingbird documentary was fascinating and beautifully photographed.,1472515200,,73,8.25

8556267,5,B00AQ8IXRI,good,1454976000,,4,4.0
8556268,2,B00AQ8IXRI,Poor quality filming - must have been filmed a whil ago before HD was available. Content ok but a bit aimed at a younger audience I feel.,1453680000,,137,4.111111111111111
8556269,5,B00AQ8IXRI,"Wild America never disappoints for the avid zoological documentary watcher.  Although yhe footage is not as high as quality as modern day documentaries, it is still great and fortunately lacks all of the post production enhancements of modern documentaries.  The narration does not seem aged.  This series is a classic, and must watch for zoological documebtary fans.",1453507200,,367,5.4035087719298245
