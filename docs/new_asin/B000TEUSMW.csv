An off-duty pilot is called to fill in for one who didn't show up for work. He is evidently flying a wealthy young woman on a last-minute change of plans. The plane malfunctions and they crash-land in an isolated spot. By the time they are rescued, they have fallen in love.

Now the fun begins. Her family is in the export/import business but one of her brothers seems to have expanded their product line to include arms and drugs.

The plane had been sabotaged in an attempt on the CEO's life (their father), but he had an emergency heart attack and wasn't on the plane.

Now the story expands to include a terrorist, a gay man, a drug and alcohol addict, infidelities and Who's Your Daddy?

Despite appealing leads: Silvia Navarro is the heiress and Sergio Basaez is the pilot, this story became too busy and too fragmented, consequently it was never involving.",1375488000,,905,4.63125

8208783,2,B000TEUSMW,"I have purchased many subtitled novellas that are edited without making you feel like you are missing anything.  However, this movie has no flow and jumps back and forth so fast after a few lines are delivered that I had to stop watching it.  There is no way to review the actual story.",1312934400,2,286,4.377358490566038
8208784,5,B000TEUSMW,"I really loved this soap.  The characters were great and the acting very good.  I had seen bits and pieces of it in youtube and I would like to say that there should have included more scenes with the two main characters, Antonio and Maria Claudia.  We missed a lot of strong crying scenes between the two of them that showed the complexity of their relationship.  Still very happy I bought it.",1293494400,2,394,4.430555555555555
