There was a Fairlane/a station wagon/a fast 4-on-the-floor one & more I can't remember.  Note:  if you had kids in the '50s - you had a station wagon.

My '94 turned 20 this yr - passed it's smog test w/flying colors & is still purring like a kitten.  Ford makes a damn fine car...",1398211200,,596,4.104347826086957
