If you assume you are riding bicycle you would want to bail out as often you run out of road on the right when the vehicle gets too close to the guard rails or moves the camera for scenery only.",1125187200,,330,3.8955223880597014
8392743,4,6303102018,"I bought this video because it was less about ""how to be an athlete"" than a way to make cycling relaxing and pleasant. After I tried using the video, I discovered the music and scenery did take away the drudgery and help me keep cycling a lot longer than usual. This was a unique experience for me. I got the instruction I needed to get the most out of my workout but never felt pressured to perform beyond what I was comfortable with. Overall I would say that this exercise video really encourages you to combine body and spirit.",1072483200,4,530,4.363636363636363
