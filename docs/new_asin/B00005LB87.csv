1620936,5,B00005LB87,I first saw this movie when it was first released and as a family we truly enjoyed it.  I have tried for the last two years to find this movie at video stores and discount stores and was unsuccessful.  Thank you Amazon for having this video and Thomas and the Magic Railroad.  These are two of my 3 year old's favorite movies.,1127952000,2,326,4.225806451612903
1620937,4,B00005LB87,"I just want to warn any people seeking the spanish audio version of this movie:  the cover says that it has spanish audio, but it does NOT.  You can read spanish subtitles, but there is no spanish audio.  It isn't an option on the disk menu, and my dvd player cannot get it to play a spanish version either.  I've had other people try it as well.  No spanish audio!",1107993600,4,365,4.1571428571428575
1620938,5,B00005LB87,"My two children ages 3 and 4 love this movie. In fact, this is one that they routinely watch, rewind and watch again (when I let them). I have sat down and watched this movie several times over and still enjoy it.
This doesn't follow the original book very well. If you are someone that believes a movie has to follow the book word for word you will be dissapointed. However, if you can get past that, you will enjoy this book.
Louis a trumpeter swan is born unable to talk. He falls in love with Serena and can't court her. He goes to school and learns to read and spell and write. However, as other swans can't read it does him very little good. In the meantime his father gets a trumpet for him. Louis learns to talk through the trumpet and music.
This is a classic video. It is well done. I have read reviews for the dvd that say there is poor pictures and audio. This is not the case for the VHS tape we have at our house.
This movie is about relationships between parents and friends and husbands and wives. It is about music and love and more.
Well worth the money.
Enjoy.",1082160000,7,1079,4.1923076923076925
1620939,5,B00005LB87,"It was with some hesitancy and fairly low expectations that I put Trumpet of the Swan into my VCR. The creators of former screenplays inspired by E. B. White's books have turned literary masterpieces into cinema that leaves the viewer unsatisfied at best and most likely thoroughly disgusted by the unhallowed cinematic treatment of White's literary brilliance. This attempt, however, left me pleasantly surprised. The changes in storyline are minimal and appropriate for moving this work from book to movie format. The animation is lighthearted yet aesthetically pleasing. The vocal talent, particularly of Jason Alexander, is impressive. In short, this is one video adults can thoroughly enjoy along with their children, especially if they have had the pleasure of reading White's book together prior to viewing it.",1008720000,7,817,5.440944881889764
1620940,1,B00005LB87,"There are good animated musicals, and then there's Trumpet of the Swan.  This must have been created to help cash in on the Disney gravy train, because this is a pale imitator.  The musical numbers are lame and arbitrarily thrown into the story, which is written for children with the attention span of a hyper-active gnat.  The animation looks like it was done on the cheap, and the voice talent (which by the list of names is impressive) sounds like they're just doing it for the money.  Adults won't find anything here, unless they are looking for a good night's sleep.",996969600,2,572,4.633663366336633
1620941,5,B00005LB87,"This animated delight is really a treat to watch. It's true to the original story and addresses social and emotional complexities of both wildlife and humans. The theatrical wing-tossing, web-footed pace keeps you on your flippers. The humor is only outdone by the soundtrack. Our kids listened, tapped their toes, and got up and danced at the front of the theater. They loved how the son, Louie tried to get his father's honor back. And, the swan father was a big hit with his funny speeches that no one wanted to listen to.",994723200,3,525,4.655913978494624

The book is full of memorable characters and beautiful moments of Louis playing taps at sunset each night. It is calming, peaceful and full of hope. It's about Louis redeeming his father. This movie is a joke. The characters are flamboyant and silly - nothing like we imagined the real characters in the book. Don't even get me started on the ridiculous songs they break into.

1621011,1,B00005LB87,"Man, if he had lived to see this dreck I...I don't know what he would have thought. (He must be rolling in his grave, however)  Why do the swans have orange bills and feet instead of black (does orange make them look more 'cartoonish and kid-friendly'? More importantly, why do they have 'hair'? Why is Sam Beaver (Louis's human friend) some young hippie-environmentalist and not part-Indian?  Why is Miss Hammerbotham some Miss Frizzle (Magic School Bus) Ripoff?  Why is Applegate Skinner, the boy from Camp, is this fat nerd who makes fun of Sam for liking birds, instead of the one being picked on by the other boys? He's playing tennis, gets sprayed by a skunk, falls in the lake/river, Louis saves him, and Applegate thanks him, saying, ""You're okay--for a bird.""  All in less than two minutes.
{Spoilers}: In the book, when Louis was introduced to the campers, Applegate mentioned he didn't care for birds--nothing against them, just didn't care for them. However, the chief counselor, Mr. Brickle, told him he should still treat the swan with respect. One day a skunk wandered into the area (see above) with its head stuck in a can, and while the boys are thinking of all these unpractical ways of helping it, Sam makes a noose on a stick, climbs on the cabin roof, and slips the noose around the can, pulling it off the skunk, causing it to spray at Mr. Brickle. Sam is praised for aiding a wild creature and 'giving everyone a dash of nature's perfume'.
Later during rest period the boys are making bad puns on Applegate's name (Rotten Applegate, Wormy Applegate, etc.) and he goes down to the waterfront and gets in a canoe. Not wearing a life jacket, he soon finds himself in difficulties and the canoe tips. He yells for help, sending counselors swimming and rowing to his aid.  Louis skims across the water and gets to the drowning boy in the nick of time.
Does Applegate say to Louis, ""You're okay--for a bird""? No--he actually says even though he is grateful to the swan for saving his life, he still doesn't like birds. To me, that's more genuine.
  And the dancing frankfurters???? Seriously????",1373932800,2,2112,4.7073170731707314

1621015,1,B00005LB87,"My 5 and 7 year old read the book with Mom and we were really kind of looking forward to the movie. The movie is maybe 20% like the book. The Serena character is all wrong. It adds in other characters that do not appear in the book. How this movie can even represent itself as 'trumpet of the swan' leaves much to be desired. Oh at the end credits it says ""based on"". Don't get this movie if you expect a faithful retelling of the book. And parents, don't substitute this movie for actually spending time with your children and reading the classic book together.",1365724800,2,562,4.311320754716981

1621018,1,B00005LB87,"I purchased this DVD for my fourth grade class.  We read the novel, and then watched the movie.  The movie is loosely based on the book, and is awful.  The animation looks cheap, and the swans all have weird halloween wig like hairstyles.  The music is bad, despite having a good cast.  I bought this movie after reading other reviews saying how terrible it was, and hope to save someone else disappointment.  The positives were that the students enjoyed it, and it worked well for comparing and contrasting.  Don't waste your money; rent it on Netflix.",1301961600,7,553,4.697916666666667

1621020,3,B00005LB87,"This movie is bad. Its not terrible or the worse movie I've seen. Its just bad. The songs with the exception of the Lil Richard song are all forgettable, and thier not really good either. The song that female swan sung was just awful. It was like nails being driven in my ear. Happy Feet this ain't. Matter a fact alot of this reminds me of Happy Feet. Just not as good or fun to listen to. The swans are just ugly. The fact that they were given hair isn't even half of whats wrong with them. Don't even get me started on the fox in the movie. I also found the characters very bland. I mean really. A hobo finds a swan playing the trumpet in the park and noone seems too surprise at the fact that a swan can play an instrument. I know its a kids movie, but come on! The whole thing about the father stealing a trumpet from a music store was just pointless to me. Why should it even matter? You're a frickin animal. Plus there was a wanted poster for a goose in the town! WTH! Also at the beginning they goofed! There was one egg, then when the dad started his terrible song 3 magically appeared! And notice how the camp in the movie is names camp Koo Koo Koo (coughkkkcough). The CGI animated scenes also look horrible. Its hard to believe the same guy (I think Richie Rich) who did The Fox and the Hound and the Swan Princess made this. Top notch actors also do voices in this movie. What a waste. The animation is also extremely bad. What keeps me from giving this one star is that its far from being the worse movie I've seen and I did like the jazz squirrel in the movie. I wonder who does his voice. Also besides the bad looking swans, fox, and humans the art in some spots isn't too bad. Just meh. An added plus is that I didn't have to pay to watch. Think god for the internet and youtube.",1283990400,,1796,4.119658119658119

1621022,3,B00005LB87,"This movie is plenty entertaining for those who haven't read the book. We read the book as a novel study and then watched the movie as a follow-up comparison.  There is no way to combine all of E.B. White's descriptive talents into a 70 minute movie.  There was not a lot of character development which is one of White's strong points, but there are enough silly jokes and new wacky characters to entertain kids.  The movie hits the major events of the book, but also lacks critical components that tie everything together.  Not a critically acclaimed movie, but plenty of musical fun on a Sunday afternoon.",1272672000,2,607,4.69811320754717

She loved it just as much as the book.  I was not looking for a great movie but was very happy with it.  It was fun for my granddaughter to tell me the parts that were not just like the book.  I was able to explain to her that most of the time, movies are not just like the books they are made about.  I was also able to use this moment to tell her that it is always best to read a story because a book can explain more in words than an movie can show on the screen.
