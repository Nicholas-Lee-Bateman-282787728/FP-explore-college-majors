8337142,1,B001R1N44K,"I was very excited to receive this DVD set. I watch a ton of golf, I play a fair amount, and I couldn't wait to learn about the science behind clubs, balls, fitness, and courses. What I received was a 3 DVD set that is a commercial about what must be the real Science of Golf DVD set. In the DVD they spend plenty of tme at equipment labs, fitness facilities, and courses but in almost every instance they never actually cover the science of what they are doing in those locations or the science behind the products they are working on. There are many times in the series where success is determined by ""imagination"" and ""feel""....the science is not even covered. Overall I was very frustratd with this purchase. It's a crime that they even used the word science in the title. You can get just as much science listening to comentators covering a Sunday round on tour.",1264032000,38,867,4.459119496855346
