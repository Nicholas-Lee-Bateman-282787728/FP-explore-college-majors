1829096,4,B000087LIM,"Im going to review each of the 3 films.

Friday(1995)- 5/5, Great, Chris Tucker & Ice Cube play good as friends together, and Smokey(Tucker), is a little to much of a pot head, so he gets Craig to start smoking too, & it gets them both into trouble, best in the series no question.

Next Friday(2000)- 2.5/5, Ok, I wonder why they would wait 5 years to make a sequel, oh well, any ways, this isn't near as good as the first one, the only thing to save this movie is The joker bro's who are a mexican family that move in the supberbs with Craig & Day Day, They shouldnt have moved Craig outta the hood, not the greatest, but if you want the whole collection, yeah get this too.

Friday after Next(Late 2002)- 4/5, Ok Craig & Day Day get thier own apartment back in the hood, and they get robbed b Santa Clause, so they get jobs as security guards to get money to get thier stuff back & buy thier family christmas presents, BIG inprovement over Next Friday, but still is not the same without Smokey, Next one should be where he gets out of rehab.",1104969600,2,1044,4.21

1829098,5,B000087LIM,"These movies are excellent. Classics in the eyes of some people. Friday was more serious than the other 2, but it was still a hilarious movie. Next Friday changed things up a little bit and took Craig into the suberbs to live with his cousin Day-Day. This one introduced Mike Epps, instead of Chris Tucker, but it was still a great movie. Then in Friday After Next, Craig and Day-Day get their own place in the hood. It was a very funny movie no matter what the critics say. These 3 movies are definetely worth the buy, especially the DVD's. I have all 3, and they have some very interesting extras, as well as superb audio and video quality. Get this collection!

1829213,5,B000087LIM,"This film trilogy is pure comic genious. The only problem I did have with these is the fact that Chris Tucker never came back to play Smokey. Now I did hear a little something on why that was. From what I heard Chris went through a life change in 1997 after the release of his other funny film ""Money Talks"". It looks as though he is trying to live right and that is purfectly fine. We all make our own decesions in life and who am I to judge. But it still doesn't change the fact that he was the most memorable charactor that everyone like the most from the first one. Don't get me wrong. Mike Epps did an excelent job playing Craig's wacky fowl mouthed cousin DayDay in ""Next Friday"" and ""Friday after Next"". Speaking of ""Friday after Next"" Katt Williams deffenatly earned my respect for his role as the pimp. As far as Smokey returning, Ice Cube has been on several talk shows and interviews about a possible forth installment. The working title is suppose to be called ""Last Friday"" and Cube is trying his best into trying to get Chris back. On several occasions Cube has asked him in the past and Chris would just smile and not say nothing. Now apparently Cube is saying that he's just waiting on a call from Chris. The studeo and everyone else is sighned on except for Chris. Let's just hope that Cube will get Chris into doing one....last.....Friday.",1351900800,3,1357,4.432

1829220,4,B000087LIM,"The DVD itself:

I love that they have put all three in a single collection, but I hate the fact that the two latest movies were put on a flippy DVD! I HATE FLIPPIES!!! You know that they tend to get scratched up if you don't handle them with super care and caution!!! Why would you put the oldest movie on a single DVD and the latest two movies on a flippy!? If most people are like me then they will tend to watch the latest two the most!

It could have been my fault for noticing that it was written somewhere on the product description that there was a flippy, but had I known, I would have bought the three on separate DVDs. I guess that is partially my fault and can't hold it against the product.

Friday:

Rating: 3.5
It's true! How do you get fired on your day off!?
The one thing I didn't like about the movie is Chris Tucker.... In my opinion he is a bit of an over-actor! I think if they had used Dave Chappelle as the neighborhood pothead it would have really put this one over the top! When he plays a crackhead he just makes your sides bust from the laughter!! I guess he knows what it's like firsthand! Ha ha ha!

Aside from that, I love the characters in this movie Mr. Willie Jones and his bad guts, not forgetting his job as a dog catcher and the things he gets into!! That is really funny! Debo... now there is a character!! The funny thing about him is that we used to have someone just like him in our neighborhood (minus the crossed eyes) and he also used to be a bully in the same way! So I could really relate to his character and what he was doing in the hood! I absolutely love the scene where they tell the story about he stole the bicycle and punched the guy in the face!! (I've got a huge smile on my face right now as I am remembering the scene and writing this)! I also love the fact that the sound of his squeaking bicycle is sort of a sign for trouble... kind of like that infamous jaws music before the shark attacks! I also love the shot where the camera is strapped to the lower end of the bicycle and Debo comes up to Craig's house on it with that music in the background! Also, the pothead girl (can't remember her character's name) who comes up to Craig and Smokey every now and then trying to mooch some weed off of them!! The way she is dressed and those funky dreadlocks.... Hilarious!

Overall, the movie is funny throughout but there are a lot of laugh out loud scenes in there which make it a good comedy!

Next Friday:

Rating: 5
Cousin Day-day! Mike Epps really nailed this character... I don't think there would have been anyone else who could have nailed this character so well!!!  How do you think of a character like that!? Gold! Pure GOLD!

I love the fact that they have added more depth to the characters from the first movie in the sequel, like Craig's father and his bad guts!! Especially the scene where he is eating a burrito in the van and just smothering it with hot sauce and then his guts kick in in the middle of a traffic jam! Then there is Uncle Elroy and the tension between him and his brother Willie over winning the lotto!! Who is also an old playa' and a freak with Sugar (his woman a worse freak than him). I almost coughed up a lung laughing at the scene in the record shop when the African comes in and starts shooting his mouth off!! Absolutely hilarious!! Let's not forget Pinky! That character is just funny!! No other way to say it!!

This movie is even funnier than the first one and I think it is because of the depth that the characters have gained and the details that are brought out in each character! A hysterically hilarious movie!

Friday After Next:

Rating: 5
Obviously, I love that they have added to the character depth of Day-Day! It just makes his character even more funny (that in itself is an accomplishment)! The same goes for Craig's father and uncle which show more details about their characters!

Now with this movie, some new and equally hysterical characters have been introduced, like Ms. Percy , the building manager and that mustache (yes you read correctly), her son Damon and his weird prison obsessions, Money Mike the wannabe pimp, Moly the doughnut shop owner, and the Santa thief!

This movie has more laugh out loud scenes and is funnier overall! This is a great end to the trilogy!",1307491200,,4295,4.298267326732673
