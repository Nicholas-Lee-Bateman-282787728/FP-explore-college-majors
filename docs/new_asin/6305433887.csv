1032764,1,6305433887,I really hated this... it wasn't even worth my time to TiVo it. It was completely unrelatable and just dragged. It rubbed me the wrong way.,1079827200,,139,4.384615384615385
1032765,4,6305433887,"The movie was very good. And this shows the supurb acting skills of Claire Danes and Jude Law as ""new comers"" to the acting field. I trully enjoy the relationship between all the characters and this movie drew me in from the get go. But, i wish i knew more about Daisy's background and go more into Jude's(Ethan) side of the story. Overall, I own this movie and i've watched it an 101 times and i am still in love.",1074902400,2,414,4.1875
1032766,5,6305433887,"This would be an excellent DVD for teachers or for discussion with a young people's group, christian, Jewish or any faith about how disturbing it can be to deal with the past. In this case, Claire Danes is a young woman plagued with visions about her grandmothr's past as a holocaust survivor and how the stories her grandmother tells her parallel her own life. Not telling anyone even her grandmother of the disturbing line she is walking between feeling mad and sane because of her imagination and desire which she doesn't know how to deal with, the edgeyness of the performances continues to a worthy climax as we learn more.
Her parents are away on a vacation and have left her with her grandmother who is an accepting, loving person, who helps her accept her identity. One great scene, is when Danes, opens to her grandmother and begins to trust another human beng, by revealing what she thinks about sex. Jude Law is okay in his role, but the two women, Claire Danes and Jeanne Moreau, really stand out in this one. Sometimes I wonder if Claire was reading lots of Sylvia Plath for inspiration for at times the movie feels like an untold part of Plath's biography, a missing link, as it were, though it is not at all intended that way. Some of the scenes may not have the smoothest transition. Perhaps the director didn't quite know what was to be done with Jude Law's character, whether to make him a caring human baing or a shallow person who acts as though he has no problems of his own, but perhaps that's part of being a teenager.
It was superb, however in the parallel in the heroine's mind between her life and grandmother's. I gave it five stars for the climax when heroine faces the angel of death and the acting by two female leads. Good as a suspense/romance film, as well.",1036627200,11,1790,4.527777777777778
1032767,2,6305433887,"This is a nice, warm film about a teenage girl, who seems to have many problems, in addition to the usual teenage stuff. The film's flaw is that it raises loads of exceptionally complex issues (first love, peer pressure,  parental neglect, dark family history, dysfuntion in modern familes, etc.),  trying to resolve them all at once. As a result, it resolves none of those  issues. It leaves its viewers wondering about whether they should take this  film as a heart-warming teenage melodrama, pshychosoial study of teenagers  or holocaust drama. So, the film loses its enertaiment value, while viewers  are looking for the answer(s). And good feature films can't afford to do  that, no matter how serious and deep their subject matter is.",957916800,,740,5.016393442622951
7889727,1,6305433887,An emotionally & socially backward 17 years old girl (though pretty) comes to terms with her grandmother who is a Holocaust survivor and her first boyfriend. Jeanne Moreau is a delight.  Claire Danes is hard to watch (so over the top).  Jude Law is a self-absorbed Mr. Popular jock.  James Van Der Beek is a cruel jock follower of Jude Law.,1495065600,,340,4.540983606557377

7889729,2,6305433887,It was like an after school special.  I found Claire Danes' character singularly annoying.  I don't think kids avoided her because of her Jewish grandmother...  I think they avoided her because she couldn't stop talking about her grandmother.,1384300800,,242,5.315789473684211
7889730,5,6305433887,"I really love this movie.  I love Clair Danes and she was great in this.  It is a very sad story, but beautiful.  It is best when you watch it more than once so you can piece it all together.  Worth every penny.  Very unusual movie.  Not everyone would like it.",1362960000,,261,4.019607843137255
7889731,1,6305433887,"Wow, if you've ever been fooled by cover art then I'm not the only one. Cute title, upbeat cover art, respectable actors...too bad the director came off as a no-talent film student on his first project. This movie had absolutely NO fluidity, no plot or substance among many other things and it was depressing throughout the entire thing to boot.  I wouldn't even call it a movie, just a bunch of random scenes strewn together. Weird and difficult to watch. I made myself sit through the whole thing even though I tried to talk myself out of it from about 10 minutes in until it finally gave mercy and ended. Don't even bother!",1297036800,,626,4.539823008849558
7889732,5,6305433887,"i first saw this movie ondemand from comcast. i must have watched it dozens of times. then there came a point in my life where i knew that the emotions surrounding my life's circumstances were similar to the main character Daisy. From then on i knew that by owning my own copy of this film that i could carry with me the life lesson and courage to resolve the conflicts around me, if not all were too similar to that of clair danes character. overall it helped me grow up. thank you for amazons quick delivery of this dvd to me.",1265155200,,528,4.237623762376238
7889733,2,6305433887,"I saw this film on HBO. It was a waste of my time. The ending was weird and I didn't quite get why the girl was so nuts. I wish it would have focused more on what the Jewish people went through in WWII. Trust me, skip this movie!",1233446400,,229,3.693877551020408
7889734,3,6305433887,"This was the 1st movie i saw with Jude Law and i fell in love with him right away. I think this story is very sweet at the begining but it is a little bit weird and confusing.. u gotta keep up with Claire Danes's character which is a weirdo girl. I bought this dvd a while ago but what i didn't like is that there is a part that they edited, where they are in the park and they start kissing and he is about to take off her top and she says ""no, just wait..wait for me"" something like that. THEY TOOK THAT OFF! man!",1175040000,,515,3.822429906542056
7889735,1,6305433887,"I am so angry at this film that it will be very difficult for me to contain the harsh words that are ready to spew from my mouth.  This will not be a review for young readers.  I Love You, I Love You Not was an atrocity from beginning to end.  From both the disgustingly poor editing, to the sloppy acting, all the way to the horrendous themes that seemed to plot two random events together this film screamed ""After School Special"".  In fact, now that I think about it, ""After School Special"" would be too delicate of a summary, it instead felt like a eager undergraduate film student attempting to be smart by attempting to poorly summarize the Holocaust with the turmoil of being a high school student.  Hopefully the professor of this assignment saw the project and properly gave it the ""F"" it deserved.  Hollywood completely outdid itself on this doozy of a film.  I am surprised that the Jewish community didn't find this film offensive in the way that it trivialized the events of the Holocaust and compared them to the social troubles of a High School girl.  I was upset by this occurrence, and I am not even Jewish.  After this short film viewing, I felt dirty, upset by the Hollywood community, and ready to shout obscenities at everyone involved with this project.  I Love You, I Love You Not was just another Hollywood attempt to monopolize on Claire Danes' My So-Called Life popularity while trying to be overly symbolic by involving the Holocaust.  Is anyone else as sick as I am about this disgraceful marriage?

I do not understand at all what director Billy Hopkins was attempting to convey with this film.  The themes were muddled in a slew of choppy editing and horrid flashbacks that left my mind in a confused knot.  In one instance we had Danes unwilling to spend time with her grandmother, while in the next instance she was opening up everything in her life to her, while in the next she was making out with the mirror, and suddenly in the next she was asking Moreau to tell her a nightmarish bedtime story involving Robert Sean Leonard.  Wouldn't that give anyone nightmares?  It did give everyone nightmares and preempts our next step into the randomly anti-Semitic High School in which Danes attends.  Unlike other films that use the Holocaust to show the injustices of the world, like in School Ties, this film randomly interjects the anti-Semitic moments near the end as if only to help strengthen already dead climax.  Like nearly every scene in this film, the supposed ""high-points"" come and go nearly as quickly as modern fashion, leaving the viewer with nothing at all.  I walked away of this film with an embarrassed look.  While there may have been some attempt at meaning behind Billy Hopkins' camera, what eventually was released was a childish attempt to combine the trivial life of a High School girl to that of the monumental disaster known as the Holocaust.  Could you put these two together?  A great director probably could, but Hopkins' could not.  All that it seems that he wants to create are meaningless dramatic plot-holes coupled with beautiful people.

Which, ultimately, leads me to the acting.  While ""abhorrent"" would be a light word summarizing the purely absent acting of Danes, Law, and Van Der Beek, it is the only one that I could think of.  Danes, using the same character structure from My So-Called Life in this film, could not find her way out of a paper bag if she tried.  I could hear Hopkins in the background saying, ""Give me more Angela Chase, I hired you for Angela, I WANT ANGELA"".  Her character is all over the place, manic depressive in one moment, happy the next, chaotic throughout, pitiful entirely.  I loved the fact that she was a ""reader"", but one of the most ignorant characters created.  You would think that with all the books she would have learned from them, sputtering quotes throughout the film, but alas, that never happened.  Again, we were left with only Angela Chase.  Award winning Jeanne Moreau bounces of the non-existent acting of Danes by providing her own character which does not fit into this film.  Obviously disturbed by her time in Auschwitz, Moreau never develops this.  She allows Danes to walk all over her, creating a weak grandmother and a needy, spoiled granddaughter.  Throw in ""boy-toy"" Jude Law only for looks (because his character was as transparent as Saran wrap) and you have the worst cast in cinema.  Nobody did any work with their characters, but instead walked around the set happy to be earning some, if any, money for their roles.  I am surprised that both Danes and Law were able to pull themselves out of the I Love You, I Love You Not rut.

Overall, this was a confusing film that was only proven worse by torrential acting, very ill cinematography, a hasty Hollywood story (very obviously created by the infamous recycle machine), and by combining a trivial moment in a teenager's life with the historical hardships of the Holocaust.  That would be similar to me trivializing the horrible deaths on the beaches of Omaha with me not getting a date for my Senior Prom.  That just is painful to hear and visually see.  The acting was non-existent, but obvious ploys to get a younger audience to attempt to connect with the story.  The direction was nauseating.  The constant flicking between present day and past stories kept me dizzied for days afterwards.  Then, there was the uproarious casting of Robert Sean Leonard, I couldn't help but laugh when I continually saw him on screen.  The only actor worth mentioning in this film was Julia Stiles, but that was because she kept her mouth shut.  This was a disaster from the beginning and should be forgotten by all!

Grade: * out of *****",1139616000,9,5710,4.7154389505549945
7889736,4,6305433887,"How could I resist seeing what the pairing of Claire Danes and Jude Law would be like?  Honestly, I would love to see them together again.  Jude Law is actually not the most important character in this, the relationship that is the glue of this movie is between the Claire Danes character and her grandmother, played by Jeanne Moreau.  They have a great sisterly bond, occasionaly one of them has to play the adult, but often it is just play.  It was really touching to see.

Jude Law is the 'it' boy while Danes is the wallflower he is intrigued by but dissapointed to learn that no matter how charming he is, she is always going to be herself.  Her intense, poetic and mysteriously sad self.

The back of the box really gave no indication of what this story was really about, which was kind of nice, I might not have picked it up, but it was compeltely missleading!

I really enjoyed this movie, and the way it interplayed Daisy's life with her grandmother's experience with being a German Jew during Hitler's reign.  I wouldn't call it sad, but a very contemplative movie.

It would have been nice to see Law's character come to some sort of enlightenment, but all in all it was satisfying, because he isn't the focus.  The focus is between these two strong, surviving women, and their relationship stands the test of the movie. Which I applaud completely.",1115510400,3,1359,4.574380165289257
