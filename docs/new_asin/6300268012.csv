290888,5,6300268012,"I first saw this movie during a college class.  We had all stayed up late the night before, finishing our term papers, and the teacher apologized profusely for showing a long movie after we had a long night.  But by the  time the end credits rolled we were riveted.  This 1972 movie is startingly  relevent when it comes to today's political climate.  As a once-blunt  candidate who resorts to meaningless sound bites to please all of the  people all of the time, Robert Redford's character is reminiscent of the  politicans today who fight constantly for their survival and wind up having  nothing to say.  It appears that this movie is becoming forgotten, which is  a shame.  Rent it at your local store and blow off the dust; it's a  well-kept secret.",916185600,3,754,4.656488549618321

Beyond that, I did not have great concern that this should be The Godfather or anything like that. But, watching this for the first time in 2016, I was really blown away by how much it conveyed a feel of the 1970s, both the cynicism and the optimism, and reminds me that if this is one of the so-so movies from the decade, then I should dive in to the classics much more.",1483056000,,461,4.021739130434782

290953,4,6300268012,"First, let me say, I think firmly that the 1970's were the greatest film decade in history and this film fits squarely in this pantheon.  Secondly, this film is almost MORE relevant today than it was when it was made, illustrating the increasing influence of paid consultants watering down campaign messages to appeal to the lowest common demonenator.  Great performances by Redford and Boyle.  The only drawback is that McKay is in many ways a ""hero"" politician, that is, someone that always does the right thing and appears to be unwilling to compromise, and he is of course rewarded for it.  We of course know that life and the political process are much more complicated than that.  Worth a watch, paced well.",1482019200,,713,4.811475409836065

The campaign rally scenes are excellent as is the behind the scenes maneuvering. And Redford's line after winning, ""What do we do now?"", is a movie classic.",1481241600,,340,4.590163934426229

291023,3,6300268012,"As much as I like Robert Redford I never got to the point of appreciating this film  Similarly, I very much enjoy satire but this film left me indifferent.  The story involves a new politician who has what seem like good ideas but he lets the campaign process compromise his convictions.  He falls prey to all the negatives we see in modern day campaigns, lies,  dislike and even hate,  Constituents do little or no research but are carried away with the emotions of  the show of conflict.

291050,4,6300268012,"Since it is an election year, we decided to watch The Candidate starring Robert Redford.  The tale is about Bill McKay, the son of a politician with no political aspirations of his own, who is recruited to run for office.  He only acquiesces when he is guaranteed that he'll lose.  Based on that promise, McKay is free to buck the system, speak his mind and be unconcerned about offending the reigning machine.  Of course he rises in popularity, despite his unconventional approach to campaigning. As he does, those who wouldn't give him the time of day suddenly can't be supportive enough.

291149,5,6300268012,"The Candidate is as compelling as it was when it came out in 1972. Maybe some things change, but it seems as if politics remains a difficult, confusing, conniving game. While the settings in the film are dated (California does look different now), the issues are similar to those in the 2016 elections (community vs individual freedoms, environment vs oil, workers vs. business, etc.). Redford is always interesting to watch. I am so used to seeing Peter Boyle in Everybody Loves Raymond that it's fascinating to see him excellently play the campaign manager. The pacing is a little slower than current films, but that means you have to pay attention more. When this film is shown on TV, the commercial breaks make it hard to follow, so it's a pleasure to watch it on Amazon without interruption. If you like political films, this one is definitely one worthwhile.",1471219200,,864,4.844594594594595

Think I also watched ""All the Presidents Men"" and then streamed the Aaron Sorkin short-lived series 'The Network' to complete my intake.  Recommend them all if you want to kind of get a feel for the evolution of how we went from a society who's journalist were very precise about their fact-checking to a society that dives in head-first whether they've fact-checked or not ... just to make sure they've got the first blurb about whatever sensationalist claptrap that can be found on twitter, social media or whatnot (especially the case when you compare ""All the Presidents Men"" to what evolves in the Sorkin series.  I know this review is about The Candidate, but there was a method to my madness (if you will), and this one was interesting in seeing how the political world of the 1970s (sans social media storms) differs from the political world of today (rife with social media storms).",1471219200,,1082,4.625

It was indeed.

The primary thing standing out for this movie is although made in the 70s, it has a very modern narrative. I guess the fundamentals of propaganda and media manipulation hasn't changed even though the medium may have changed quite dramatically.

While Mr. McKay is portrayed as having been forced to compromise a great deal of his beliefs, one could argue that the political system in the early 1970s was a far more positive environment then, frequently recognizing the need for bipartisanship, compromise and the need for constructive engagement in addressing national problems. The media campaigns waged by the candidates might have delivered shorthand messages but reflected the basic priorities of the candidates, and the environment was certainly not as ""negative "" as that of today. Changes in the campaign finance laws, the ability of direct voter contact professionals to segment voters with exacting precision, the more diverse structure of the news media and its usage by the public,  have not been positive developments. They have helped to bring about our current dysfunctional political system.  Given all that, the political campaigns of the early 1970s look positively refreshing.

Fascinating depiction of a modern campaign's trajectory, with strong performances by supporting players Boyle, Allan Garfield as a bumptious PR guy, Melvyn Douglas as the candidate's former Governor Father, and Don Porter as the formidable Republican opponent seeking yet another term.

291382,4,6300268012,"Some people might see this as a movie about one would-be politician with a particular ideology challenging the established system with an opposite ideology. Robert Redford plays Bill McKay a young liberal lawyer whose father was governor of the state. McKay challenges a conservative Republican, Crocker Jarman, for senator. Supposedly McKay doesn't have a chance against Jarman who's been in the senate for a long time.
McKay at first resists any modifications to his approach to politics. Gradually, he is seduced by the political game and accepts the changes to his equally hardcore lib/leftist beliefs to have a chance at winning.
So the movie can actually be about any politician who changes his ethics to gain political power. And to be sure plenty of would-be hardcore liberals and conservatives have changed their messages midstream or altered their positions after achieving power.
It's about the corruption of the system. Some people assert that every pol modifies his or her position to pander.  A lot of that is true. Nevertheless The Candidate is a very well made movie concerning the political process.",1425945600,,1116,5.2

291419,4,6300268012,"We were shown this movie by my liberal social studies teacher in my senior year of high school, and he used the movie to make points, such as whether debates really do anything for a candidate besides publicizing them.  Though done in the early 1970's, the movie has avoided obsolescence-unfortunately.

A campaign manager has just come off a losing election in California, and takes on the task of managing the campaign of a challenger to a Congressional seat who is also expected to lose, as the incumbent is supposedly safe in his seat.  He has Bill McKay, the liberal son of the machine politician former governor of California, take the role of the challenger, and McKay is told to go ahead and say what he wants because it won't matter anyway.

But unexpectedly, the incumbent's position turns out to be not so strong.  The story isn't clear as to why; usually an incumbent loses their position by offending their constituency or changing demographics in their district, but that isn't indicated.  Now McKay has a real chance to win-but not enough voters would want a strong liberal.  So the manager coaches McKay to be more vague and avoid answering questions in a way that might alienate potential voters...in fact give cliched responses even the campaign staff laugh at.  McKay does so, being vague in his responses to questions, and basically giving generalized platitudes in his speeches, without being specific about what he intends to do.

The movie is timeless in the sense that there have been plenty of politicians who have made it to office without really saying what they would do once they got in, basically telling the voters to take them on faith.  And the movie does have one very funny moment-when McKay and his staff are told to take a chair, they do so literally.

Republican candidates, in particular, are all lined up desperately trying to see who gets the chance to unseat Obama in the general presidential election.

It's push and shove, he said, she said, charge and countercharge, emerging scandals, and momentary surges. How are they ever going to get this mess straightened out?

All elections seem quite different, yet they all seem very much the same. If you want a good inside look at a fictitious 70s election for the Senate Seat from California, ""The Candidate"" starring Robert Redford presents an interesting and insightful view. Redford is a handsome JFK-type of candidate, at least visually, and he's up against a stale and stogy deeply-entrenched Republican who is the strong frontrunner. The incumbent has all the advantages. The movie follows the challenger. Well, it's committee meetings, insiders, important people, people who think they're important, fund raising, rallies, election managers endless banquets, speeches, newspaper reporters, TV appearances, to and fro travel at the last minute, clashes of egos, and differences in agendas.

The whole thing is just such a melange of overlapping activities that you're left baffled and wondering if anyone is ever going to get anything straightened out and accomplished. Well, something seems to be happening, at last. The Redford challenger seems to be somehow rising in the polls and the incumbent is gradually faltering. Will it be enough? It there enough time left? Will either have a last minute surge? Stay tuned for the exciting photo finish!

Personally, I didn't particularly care for the movie. But that's because I don't particularly care for the way we go about selecting our most important government officials. The movie was rather well done and insightful. The acting was rather good. The action was relentless. Most of the characters  were believable, unfortunately. Even if I didn't care for it, the movie makes for good watching in an election year. Oh, by the way, it's a rather old movie and I purchased my copy in a Ross Store for under four dollars.

Redford's good looks and charisma afford him the luxury of a somewhat stubborn disposition and have allowed him to champion causes that interest him such as environmentalism.  ""The Candidate"" is the product of Redford's interests.  It turns 40 next year and hold up well on DVD.

As Bill McKay, Redford plays a lawyer who works for environmental causes.  His performance is a strong one as we see the strains on his marriage, his desire to speak the truth even when not politically expedient, and some utter silliness as when he has private moments in a car or gets the giggles while trying to tape a TV spot.

Peter Boyle who became a major screen presence due to 1970s ""Joe,"" plays Marvin Lucas, the political strategist who thinks McKay has potential and drafts him into the race, fully expecting him to lose.  Boyle is magnificent as we see the calculated wheeler-dealer politico who also has the soft skills of handling a nervous candidate, who we come to believe he really likes.

Melvyn Douglas plays John J. McKay, the former governor who is a seasoned politician.  Douglas had won one Oscar before this film, ""Hud"" in 1964, and won another supporting actor Oscar afterwards in 1979 for ""Being There.""  He does a great job as the wise but worldly father who comes and supports his son.

Don Porter who may be best remembered as Gidget's TV dad plays Don Porter, a traditional law & order Republican who knows all the angles.  The scene where his helicopter swoops down near a Malibu forest fire and steals the limelight from Bill McKay is a study in one-upsmanship.

Michael Ritchie had previously directed ""Downhill Racer"" with Robert Redford.  That film was considered the first and ""The Candidate"" the second in a proposed trilogy of films concerned with the theme of winning.  Allen Garfield plays the sleazy ad man Klein.  Karen Carlson does a nice job as Bill's wife Nancy, for whom being in the spotlight takes as much getting used to as it does for her husband.

As the film concludes, we get the sense of a political process that seems out of control, propelled by superficialities, where candidates are sold like underarm deodorants.  The many crazy scenes where people jabber over each other without listening is fragmenting and disorienting.  Jeremy Larner who had been a speech writer for Eugene McCarthy won an Oscar for Best Screenplay as well as the Writers Guild award for his work.  ""The Candidate"" remains a strong film, one relevant to watch as we enter another presidential election year.  Enjoy!",1325030400,3,2777,5.167785234899329

I've only seen a few episodes of this from way back, when it was on TV, but I liked what I saw.  If you like giant robots fighting off an alien invasion then this is a show for you.  However, to put to rest all of the complaints here about the ""lack of an ending,"" the Japanese entertainment industry defines a ""series"" differently than we do here in the USA.  They often end a series on a cliffhanger, to build up suspense.  You see, in Japan they often will run what we would call ""season 2"" as an entire different title; usually they jump forward in time a bit and let you guess at what happened between but in many cases the familiar characters (or their descendants) are still there and the story continues in much the same way as before.  A good example of this is with the samurai series ""Kage No Gunda"" or however you prefer to Americanize the title; the first one ended, then the second one picked up with the main character's grandson or some such who was following in his footsteps.  I don't really remember the exact chronology... it's been a while since I saw that particular show.

291479,5,6300268012,"I saw this when it came out and was utterly riveted by it.  It was the first political film I had ever seen and got me interested in politics, of which I became quite the junky.  I believe this was one of the first films to attempt to create a realistic and subtle drama about the political process, at least in elections.

This time around, I got it for my kids.  I admit that I watched it with some trepidation, hoping I would like it as much as I did the first time.  Fortunately, it passed the test!  We all became engrossed and discussed it afterwards, which was exactly what I hoped would happen.

One scary thing about the film, as my left-wing wife put it, is how little has changed - the US has scarcely moved on from the issues as presented in the film.  First, abortion is a big  deal, as is gun control.  Second, there is the issue of government involvement in the economy, decried as socialist etc etc.  Third, there is the environment, also hotly debated in much the same terms as today - developers v. tree huggers.  Finally, the best portrayed issue is the campaign process itself, which transmogrifies the candidate's message with the necessity of TV's dumbing down.  As we can see with the incendiary tactics used today, not even the internet has changed things much.

Warmly recommended.  This film demonstrates the potential that film can have in sparking thought and debate.  That it is so relevant is depressing.",1259452800,22,1434,4.564705882352941

291481,5,6300268012,"Robert Redford was behind the entertaining political movie ""The Candidate"" (1972), which goes a long way towards explaining how the game works. This film is really not a liberal one, which is what makes it worthwhile even after 30 years. It is supposed to be based on Edmund ""Jerry"" Brown, former California Governor Pat Brown's son. Jerry Brown at the time was a youthful Secretary of State who would go one to two terms as Governor. He was a new kind of pol, attractive, a bit of swinger who dated rock star Linda Rohnstadt, and representative of the Golden State image of the 1970s. They called him ""Governor Moonbeam"".
Redford plays the son of the former Governor of California, played by Melvyn Douglas. The old man is old school all the way, having schmoozed his way up the slippery slope through implied corrupt deals with labor unions and other Democrat special interests. Redford is a young man who played football at Stanford and is now a social issues lawyer of the pro bono variety, helping Mexicans in Central California. Peter Boyle knew him at Stanford and is now a Democrat political consultant who recruits Redford to run for Senator against Crocker Jarman, an entrenched conservative Orange County Republican. Jarman could be Reagan, but he is as much a composite of the traditional Republican: Strong on defense, down on affirmative action and welfare, a real ""up by the bootstraps"" guy who emerged from the Depression and World War II to make up our ""greatest generation.""
The film does an about-face on perceptions that, in many cases, turn out to be true. Redford is the rich kid with connections. Jarman beat the Depression like the rest of the U.S., without a social worker.
""How did we do it?"" he mocks.
Redford's film wife is played by Karen Carlson, pure eye candy (but what happened to her career I cannot say?). She has ambitions of her own, and pushes him to do it because he has the ""power,"" an undefined sexual charisma of the JFK variety. Redford plays a caricature of himself, handsome but considered an empty suit. His deal is he can say any outrageous thing because he cannot win anyway, and in so doing shows he has the brains. When he creeps up in the polls, the idealism gives way to standard politicking, complete with deals with his old man's crooked labor buddies.

[Does he remind you of Reagan?] McKay decides to run as a challenger and answers questions from the press. The professionals start to help McKay. [They do not tell about the big money men who support this candidate.] Does Crocker Jarman have the right stuff for today?

There is a banquet for the candidates. Bill McKay makes a speech; he wants power for the people (but will not attack the corporations who hold power). There are topics about Vietnam, Red China, the environment, abortions. We see the candidate being prepared to answer questions. McKay visits people on the beach, the black ghetto, and meets people. He has charisma and wins in the primary. [No mention how the needed funds are raised; it's a good investment for some.] Now McKay must reach to those who can decide the general election. McKay promises ""A Better Way"" for the people of California. [Deliberately ambiguous?] This film explains how a campaign works. A brush fire allows a candidate to speak against policies, but the incumbent can make things happen. Is ""mass transit"" really a fix for placing people far away from their jobs?

There is a problem at home. Will his wife's outfit work to gain votes? Are candidates sold by television advertising? [Ever since 1952.] Ambiguous statements by candidates have been around since Andrew Jackson's time. The professionals have raised McKay's polls by 14 points, closing the gap. They rehearse McKay for his debate with Jarman. McKay says problems can be cured without raising taxes. [Is this still true?] McKay's closing remarks are extemporaneous. Can he cure poverty, unemployment, crime, and unhappiness? The head of the Teamster's Union endorses McKay; they each have something in common: support from the other. Why does California have high unemployment? McKay turns into a rhetorician, asking questions that have no answers but somehow sound good. A parade is scheduled for lunch hour so the streets will be filled with people. Cars are stopped at intersections to create a traffic jam. Election day arrives with projections and early returns. The vote slowly puts McKay in the lead, and he wins. McKay has become dependent on his advisors. What will he do now?

This film as a hit because it showed the scenes that are kept from the public in this story about politics. ""The Selling of the President"" pioneered this approach.

A product of a cynical age and although a bit dated (the film was released in 1972, and Redford would follow with the cynical and conspiratorial  anti-CIA film, ""Three Days of the Condor"" in 1973), ""The Candidate"" is a illustrative vehicle demonstrating how pollsters, admen, press agents, and what we would call now ""spin doctors"" packaged political candidates to an unsuspecting electorate before anyone had ever heard of blogs and the internet.

As the liberal attorney-now Democratic senatorial-candidate, Bill McKay, Redford plays a man whose integrity and ideals fall prey to the American political and media machine that compel him to win. Peter Boyle, as McKay's campaign manager, and Melvyn Douglas, as the candidate's father, contribute vital supporting roles that are are as absorbing as the film itself.

291517,5,6300268012,"I do not have to tell anyone that the look behind the scenes at the fictional California senate race in the 1972 film ""The Candidate"" remains realistic and relevant today.  The sophistication employed by candidates and their supporters in putting together campaign ads has certainly become progressively slicker and sicker, but what we see in Michael Ritchie's drama is essentially what we still get today.  The tagline for ""The Candidate"" was: ""Nothing matters more than winning. Not even what you believe in,"" a sentiment that is certainly true today, Election Day 2004.  Both of the candidates, George W. Bush and John F. Kerry, were nominated by their parties because of the perception that they could win the election.  Bush had been re-elected governor of Texas, so he had the requisite weight to going up against Al Gore.  Kerry had served in Vietnam, so he would be able to talk about national security.  Neither man has ever been accused of being a visionary leader in the mold of John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan.

Since Robert Redford is in the title role he certainly has the requisite charisma to be that sort of candidate.  He is Bill McKay, the son of a former governor, John J. McKay (Melvyn Douglas), and he has been working as a lawyer and trying to get away from daddy's shadow.  McKay is talked into being essentially the sacrificial lamb against the incumbent, conservative Senator Crocker Jarmon (Don Porter), because it will be a way of publicizing the issues he cares about.  Since he is going to lose big-time, the handsome and articulate McKay is given permission to go out and (horrors) say whatever he really wants.  The problem is that his ideas are starting to resonate with the electorate and he is starting to gain in the polls, at which point he starts getting handles by Democratic operative Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle), who knows how to play hardball.  Lucas brings in a ""media specialist,"" Allen Garfield (Howard Klein), who knows how to package a candidate so that it is all about image over substance.  After all, now that he can actually win, young McKay has to pay attention to what he actually says.

Like ""Network,"" this film is something of a satire, but it keeps things pretty realistic and avoids plunging into black comedy.  The closest ""The Candidate"" comes to the edge is in my favorite scenes, which is when Robert Redford's character is in the back of his limo getting a bit silly with his campaign spiel: ""Can't any longer play off black against old, young against poor. This country cannot house its houseless, feed its foodless.""  Then he ends up making weird noises and doing a Nixon impersonation.  There is, of course, an authenticity to this unguarded moment that goes way beyond the well-scripted public performances of the political candidate.

It has been three decades and ""The Candidate"" is still at the top of my list for cinematic representations of the seedy side of politics, assuming, for the sake of argument, that those terms are not redundant.  You really do believe that McKay wants to do and say the right thing, and his compromises are reluctant.  When he makes the necessary deal with a labor leader (Kevin Tobey) to get votes in return for favors, we know that McKay is aware that he has just sold his soul and that he is not at all convinced the exchanged is going to be worth the trade.

The film was scripted by Jeremy Larner, who I understand was a former speech writer for Eugene McCarthy, which explains why it has a sense of authenticity above and beyond what we usually get in such movies.  Larner ends ""The Candidate"" with a true note of horror, as the winning candidate asks, almost helplessly, ""What do we do now?""  Sometime tonight, assuming for the sake of argument that we will actually know who has won the election by the time the clock strikes midnight, that is a question that many of us will be asking, even if we are not the one who has just been given a four year lease on the White House.",1099267200,5,3984,4.692528735632184

291519,4,6300268012,"""The Candidate"" is liberal Hollywood's wet dream of the ""realities"" of a political campaign.
Robert Redford (looking purposely Kennedyesque) is Bill McKay, a young crusading liberal attorney who's persuaded by political operative Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle in a terrific performance) to run for the U.S. Senate against conservative Republican icon, Crocker Jarmon (even the name shows what a stacked deck the picture is), played by 50's TV sitcom star, Don Porter.
Handsome and hip McKay is depicted as pro busing, pro welfare and pro choice...while stodgy old Jarmon is shown mouthing tired old conservative attitudes about Americans working hard and picking themselves up by their own bootstraps.
The cast is uniformly excellent, especailly the great Allen Garfield as Mc Kay's media consultant whose shtick is breaking bags of lollipops with a hammer and sucking on the smashed pieces. Redford gives a slyly appealing movie star performance and is especially superb in one scene in which, completely burned out from campaigning, begins to satirize the platitudes his speechwriters have given him (""when the greatest country in the world can't feed the foodless!"").
One wonders what kind of movie ""The Candidate"" would have been if Mc Kay's opponent was as equally young and hip and spoke with the same fervor as McKay without the tired old right wing cliches.

When the full force of Watergate buried Nixon in scandal shortly thereafter, resulting in his resignation in 1974, the messages presented in ""The Candidate"" became all the clearer as Nixon's hollow facade lay fully exposed.
Jeremy Larner, a former speechwriter for presidential candidate Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1968, used his political savvy to craft a script based on the realism of campaigning in the television age, in which, to use Marshall McLuhan's apt phrase, ""the medium is the message.""  Larner copped a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for his effort.  Robert Redford plays Bill McKay, who runs a poverty law center and has no ambitions to seek political office.  He is urged to do so as the Democrats in California seek an opponent for a solidly entrenched incumbent U.S. Senator played by Don Porter.  Redford, whose father, played by Melvyn Douglas, is a former California governor, agrees to run after being told that he can address topics on his own terms.  The idea is that he is expected to make a decent run but is not expected to win.  Redford articulates ideas near and dear to him that are not embraced by the broad spectrum of California voters.  When he runs poorly in the primary, however, he is informed that he needs to make changes or risk being humiliated in the general election by Porter, a prospect he does not relish.
Redford's ensuing frequent turnabouts on major issues make him anything but the refreshingly candid candidate he sought to become.  As the polls close and there is possible light at the end of the long campaign tunnel, Redford becomes more of a blurry media creation and loses the old image of refreshingly solid commitment he had previously displayed.
Eventually Redford upsets Porter.  By the time the long race ends he is immersed in a total blur.  The film's closing line is a gem.  After winning the race Redford, seated in his hotel room with his campaign staff, asks, ""What do we do now?""
""The Candidate"" was one of director Michael Ritchie's finest efforts.  The pacing becomes gradually stepped up as the campaign moves into its important stretch run.  By the end the viewer is immersed in the same kind of non-stop, frenzied blur as are the candidates and their staffs, providing a graphic display of political realism via the camera's all-seeing eye.",1010188800,62,2576,4.93287037037037
291541,4,6300268012,"The late Michael Ritchie was a criminally underrated director and 1972's The Candidate remains probably his best known film.  Designed to serve as a primer for liberal political candidates, The Candidate tells the story of Bill McKay (Robert Redford), a young activist lawyer who is recruited by a slightly sleazy campaign manager (Peter Boyle) to run for the U.S. Senate against a conservative Republican incumbent (Don Porter, better known as Gidget's Dad).  After overcoming his initial hesitations, McKay becomes a committed candidate and finds himself losing his identity in the process.  Written by a former speechwriter for Eugene McCarthy, the film serves as a strongly realistic look at the state of modern political campaigning and, in typical '70s manner, is surprisingly downbeat.  Redford gives one of his better performances, actually allowing himself to portray a character that some viewers may be surprised to discover they have ambigous feelings towards.  His performance in this film (and other films from this period) stands in sharp contrast to the golden boys he's been concentrating on for the last few decades.  Amongst the supporting cast, strong turns are given by Boyle and Melvyn Douglas as Redford's father -- a former Governor.  Don Porter, on the other hand, is a tad obvious as the Republican Senator.  While its reasonable to assume that Porter's buffoon is the way Hollywood liberals like Ritchie and Redford realistically view conservative Republicans, it hard to take such an obvious clown seriously as an opponent and, unfortunately, this detracts from the overall effectiveness of the film.  Ritchie later said he regretted not exploring more of McKay's family life and, with the exception of the scenes between McKay and his father, the film does, at times, come across as a bit cold and unemotional.  McKay's wife is barely a presence in the film and one never really knows how she feels about his campaign.
Still, its a frequently funny, always fascinating, realistic look at how we elect our government and, in many ways, it was a prophetic film.  1974 would see a huge slew of liberals in the Bill McKay model elected to the U.S. Senate and the character of McKay was supposedly modeled on two of the more succesful California Democrats of the '70s -- Sen. John Tunney and Gov. Jerry Brown.  After watching this film, one can't help but wonder what lay ahead for McKay -- as he himself asked, ""What now?""  Would he be able to survive the sudden drastic turn in the nation's political sentiments just eight years later or would he find himself swept away like Tunney and Brown?",1002672000,3,2619,5.034722222222222

(Examples: busing is no longer a high national issue, politicians are no longer afraid to take an unequivocal pro-choice stand, and the film fails to anticipate the supreme importance fundraising now plays in political campaigns). But the main theme is dead-on and just as fresh as ever: can a good man also be an effective politician? The movie's answer is not what we may want to believe. This is a strikingly effective look into the compromises, deals, and just plain b.s. that a candidate on the national stage must put up with in order to be elected.

Robert Redford, as usual, is an actor extraordinare.  His  performance in ""The Candidate"" was strong, considering it was one  of his earlier films.  Redford's character and philosophy, throughout the  movie, was similar to that of Robert Kennedy.  Perhaps that is why I  enjoyed watching it, because Redford's character was one who truly cared  about the ideals of America and the fundamental rights human beings have.
It was interesting to note, (not a surprise, though, I should add), how  Redford's character changed throughout the campaign, as a result of the way  the political operations - or rather, the political monster -  function.
An enjoyable movie for all who are interested in politics and  the process of campaigning!  Though you can expect what you see in this  movie is no different than what you see happening nowadays.",958262400,6,1217,4.906403940886699
291547,5,6300268012,"12. THE CANDIDATE (drama, 1972) Lawyer Bill McKaye (Robert Redford) heads his own public law firm. He's an idealistic man who comes from a wealthy-political family. Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle) heads a political  committee looking for a 'young, fresh face' to go up against the present  Senator of California, Croker Jarmon (an old And experienced war-horse).  Lucas believes that McKaye has the potential to upset the Senator in the  next elections. Though McKaye he hates the political arena (one of the  reasons he drifted from his father, who was once governor), Lucas convinces  him, telling him that he has nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Setting up a McKaye committee, Lucas sets out to shape McKaye into a  political weapon. His rise (though not meteoric) is nonetheless slowly felt  in the polls. Becoming a surprising contender, he thinks about quitting  (scared at the thought of winning). Nevertheless, Lucas tells him its too  late, since the finish line is close. With the campaign taking a toll on  his homelife, his decision is a difficult one.
Critique:  Serio-documentary, The Candidate is one of those films that should be shown  to students seeking a political career. Its precise depiction of a normal  person into a beauracratic tool is almost too real. Director Michael Ritche  recreates the sometimes absurd, complicated and superficial world of  political inner workings to perfection. Robert Redford is also perfect as a  'wholesome', nave underdog champion (you can almost feel a JFK-esque aura  around him). The film's wonderful parades and interviews further reinforce  the sense of a documentary. An excellently written, 'illuminating'  experience.

7808092,4,6300268012,"The Candidate was one of the first modern political satire films. Made only a few years before Robert Redford catapulted to international fame with All the President's Men, this film shows him in his acting prime. Although the humor displayed in the film is of the exceptionally dry type, it also is a moral allegory on the corrosive power of politics. The plot involves a young and charismatic environmentalist. The son of a former governor, he disclaims any interest in political office, but when a Democratic strategist comes knocking, he grudgingly enters California's Senate race. At first faced with the prospect of defeat in a landslide, Redford's character attempts to save face by slowly reinventing his image and platform. By election night, he is virtually unrecognizable to the public, his wife, and, most importantly, himself.

The DVD itself is a simple one-disc box with a few accompanying special features, such as the trailer, but the main reason you would buy this is for the film. While the format does not have the clarity of most modern films, almost all political satires in the U.S. take their cue from this movie. A great film and decent moral parable on the quagmire that is politics.",1506470400,,1209,4.955665024630542
7808093,4,6300268012,"Review of The Candidate
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

Political scientists and political film buffs need to watch The Candidate. Its one of the greatest classic political films ever made. Ive studied dozens of political campaigns, conducted mock elections during my undergraduate and graduate courses, and volunteered for real campaigns when I was old enough. This movie is very realistic; the only other film that comes close in realism is 2015s Our Brand is Crisis.

Peter Boyle is a Democrat campaign manager, and in the California Senate election, the Republican sitting senator Don Crocker is a shoe-in. Whoever the Democrat candidate is doesnt stand a chance, so no one wants to ruin their career that way. Boyle approaches Robert Redford, the son of former Californian governor Melvyn Douglas. Hes handsome, charismatic, and has name recognitionbut hes a guaranteed loss so theres no consequence to anything he says or does. With the freedom to run as an honest politician, he becomes a very interesting and alluring candidate.

Even though the movie is about an election, it doesnt take too much of a stand about which party is right and which is wrong. Yes, its the 1970s and Robert Redford is the lead, so there will be some environmental and look out for the little guy messages, but mostly, the film comments on the politics in general. Its really funny and sarcastic in the nicest way possible, and it has one of the most memorable last lines ever!",1506297600,,1467,4.931174089068826
