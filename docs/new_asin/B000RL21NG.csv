2868860,1,B000RL21NG,"I bought the individual volumes 1 & 2. Combined, they have the exact same run time as the Complete Series set according to Amazon. However, the episode ""Imprint"" is not included in either volume. I wrote to Starz/Anchor Bay and they claim it IS on the big set. What a ripoff! It's bad enough they said they'd never release the full season in order to sucker people into buying the original individual releases. Now they pull this nonsense.",1198195200,18,439,4.641025641025641
2868861,4,B000RL21NG,"Volume 2 of the first season of Masters of Horror has some of the best episodes.  Particularly good are Deer Woman, Jenifer, Homecoming and Pick Me Up.  Sick Girl is fairly amusing with some very cool make-up effects but The Fair-Haired Child isn't all that good.

I'd rank them up as follows:

1. Deer Woman.  While not a full blown horror flick it more than makes up for that with rip roaring laughter.  Brian Benben excels as the detective on the case, who's handling animal attacks exclusively.  The script is sharp and funny and there's also quite a bit of gore here thrown in for good measure.

2. Homecoming.  Joe Dante's political outburst is well written, funny and somewhat thought provoking.  Not a lot of thrills here but in the end you get a fast moving film which gives you food for thought and some grisly grue.  And some zombies to boot.  Nothing bad to say about this one.

3. Jenifer.  Dario Argento doesn't shy away from sex and truly disgusting gore in this tale about a very unfortunate detective who harbours a mentally challenged sex maniac who's thirstly for human flesh.  And her face isn't all that pretty to look at.  Argento's magic touch comes through on occasion and overall this entry also gives you some food for thought.

4. Pick Me Up.  The tale of two serial killers who cross paths and share an interest in one unfortunate girl.  Pretty good overall with good performances and some icky moments floating around.  The surprise ending caps it off well.

5.  Sick Girl.  Somewhat moving love story between two girls handled as a creature feature flick.  Great make-up effects and some solid old fashioned suspense elevate the film.  Good performances too.

6.  The Fair-Haired Child.  The only dud in the set.  Predictable and without any real suspense this entry fails to raise interest.

I must mention that in the extras department this set is outstanding.  Lengthy documentaries on each segment, commentaries, all the scripts in PDF format and more.  Future sets should have so much bonus material.

Overall this set has some great episodes and knockout extras and if you're interested you shouldn't hesitate buying it.",1196553600,12,2156,4.80327868852459

2868885,5,B000RL21NG,I never watch this show on TV but I love horror films! I truly enjoyed watching it! it was different! I recommend anyone who loves horror to give Masters Of Horror a change!,1415750400,,173,4.2727272727272725
2868886,5,B000RL21NG,"The first tale in the second volume of this horror anthology features a tale called, Jenifer, which represents a fine adaptation by Dario Argento of a tale from the graphic novel Creepy that makes you think twice before empathizing with disfigured individuals and revolves around the story of a cop who rescues a hideously mal deformed girl, Jenifer, from being butchered to death by her foster father, and, feeling sympathy for her, takes her in  much to the disgust of his family, and discovers himself becoming infatuated, with her, despite her hideously mal deformed features,  after being seduced by her and protecting her from the law when she butchers his family, and seeking to start a life with her in the shelter of a shack, until she viciously murders a towns boy, bringing him to the realization that she was evil and had to be killed  only to find himself being shot to death in his attempt to kill her by a sympathetic cop who decides to take her in, thereby, starting the cycle again in what philosophers would call ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

The second tale in this volume, Sick Girl, is arguably one of the best episodes from the Master of Horror series, sold separately as a single movie by Amazon, with a well-acted drama revolving around a lesbian relationship but less than satisfactory special effects. Nonetheless gay rights advocates should love this one.

The story revolves around a biologist specializing in bugs, who overcomes her shyness, under the encouragement of her colleague, to make advances towards a girl - who she later learns to be her ex-professor's daughter, who harbors a secret infatuation with her and also overcomes her shyness to engage in a loving relationship involving sexual intercourse with her; while she conceals her fascination and obsession with bugs from the professor's daughter, under the influence of her colleague, who fears that the discovery of her secret will scare the girl off, only to have the girl stumbling upon her secret and discovering that they both share the same fascination with bugs, given the fact that the her ex-professor was also a biologist who specializes in bugs, and who, due to his daughter infatuation with his former student, sends her an extremely rare specimen of bugs that when bitten induces a gradual transformation in the victim. When his daughter gets infected, she gradually metamorphosizes and, her lover, likewise, begins to gradually transform once the infection is spread to her, imparting in them the ability to reproduce bug off springs.

This movie speaks loads about the right of lesbians to form meaningful and loving relationships with one another which, may or may not involve sexual intercourse, and their right to adopt children or bear children through the use of artificial insemination from male donors.

The third tale in this brilliant horror series, Deer Woman, does not even warrant the time required to write a review; so, I simply wont.

Suffice to say the first two tales justifies the asking price of the disc.

Highly recommended.",1411776000,,3058,5.01577909270217

2868891,5,B000RL21NG,"I loved this show when it aired on Showtime some years ago, but very dismayed when they did not bring it back after the 2nd season. A shame. This show has a great concept of bringing together some of the most influential names in horror. The shows vary from standard fare to political satire. A great set, but I recommend purchasing Volume 1 before this one because the one drawback to this set is that they are not in the order they were aired. I had to Wikipedia the order. Then again, it could be me just being a pureist.",1383177600,,524,4.25
2868902,5,B000RL21NG,"There were three really good tales in this one.  It's probably the best one, although vol. 1 has the best movie on it, Cigarette Burns.

The first tale is Jenifer, directed by Dario Argento, hailed as the Italian Alfred Hitchcock.  He's one of my favorite writer/directors.  This story centers on a cop (Stephen Weber) who stumbles across a man about to take a hatchet to a woman.  He winds up shooting the guy.  It turns out the beautiful-bodied blond has a hideous face.  She is, however, a VERY nice woman. Ultimately he winds up taking her to his house, where she promptly eats the cat.  It all goes downhill from there.\

The second story is Sick Girl. I'll admit you have to have a taste for Lucky McKee/Angela Bettis quirky, weird humor/horror.  Basically, you'll either love this one or hate it, depending on how your tastes run.  Personally, I loved it.  Bettis plays a meek and mousy lesbian entomologist who is looking for love, and finds it sitting on the bench where she works.  At the same time, she receives a package in the mail, a bug specimen.  She gets it inside an looks at it, but she's too busy with other stuff to pay immediate attention.  Too bad for her...but it has a happy ending, so don't worry.{sardonic smile}

The final entry in this frightfest is Deer Woman.  This time it's John Landis, another quirky horror director (maybe it was a mistake putting both of these on the same disc may have been a mistake.  Anyway, this one has multiple deaths by deer, and a rough and grisled detective on the trail of the ""deer woman"", and strange half woman, half deer.  Trust me it's better than it looks.  Plus there's a reference to American Werewolf in London.",1376092800,,1683,4.565217391304348

2868909,4,B000RL21NG,"Volume II of Season One of Masters of Horror contains three of the best episodes: Jenifer, Sick Girl, and Deer Woman. All three make for extremely entertaining viewing, even more so in the Blu-ray format. The quandary these Blu-ray releases presents to the collector is that the extras included on the original DVD releases, with the exception of audio commentaries, are not included. Typically I would say go with the better picture and sound quality, because extras are generally not good for more than one viewing. In this case, however, there is a significant omission: Dario Argento's Jenifer was the only episode to have footage censored at some stage of the production process, and while it only amounts to a few seconds, that footage plus the other Argento extras do represent a significant loss, given his stature as a filmmaker. That said, the audio commentaries for Jenifer and Sick Girl are quite good; Deer Woman's commentary suffers from John Landis' absence. Argento enthusiasts may want to keep their original copy of Jenifer if they purchase disc, so, recommended with caution.",1219968000,24,1094,5.083333333333333

2868911,4,B000RL21NG,"I loved this show.  Everyone complains about dud episodes, but that is the beauty of an anthology series.  Everyone will like something different.  I loved Deer Woman, which managed to be funny but very suspenseful.  Pick Me Up features a freaking amazing performance by Michael Moriarty (from early seasons of Law and Order).  Absolutely top notch going against type portraying a serial killer trucker.  My wife's favorite episode was The Fair Haired Child, while we both got a kick out of the 'zombie movie for liberals': Homecoming.  Some very quirky performances from the two lead actresses in Sick Girl made that episode memorable for me and the premise of Jenifer had my wife talking about that episode for days.  I own both sets from season one, but like this set a little bit more overall.",1208390400,2,797,4.851851851851852

8201237,5,B000RL21NG,"I am so glad they made these into blurays!, i'm not going to go into too much detail, because so many already have. It's a great collection.
I liked Jenifer a lot, i think in the past few movies of Argento's he has been changing, i don't mean that in a bad way, i mean, his style, is still there but it's changing a lot. So it was nice to see Jenifer hold true to older Argento films. It's a pretty interesting story that does make you question a lot of things, i did like it's underlying message that was tangled in there. (i must point out i may have bias because i do love Dario Argento's work)

Sick Girl, i really could go on for days about my love of this one. I also love Lucky Mckee's films, so i may be a bit biased. It's a nice little ""love story"" with some horror mixed in, i do LOVE that in the commentary Lucky mentions that he was so happy to be working with masters of horror that he tried to include all of the masters of horror directors names in some parts of it. I will admit i wish they spent more time with bettis and misty, i do wish this was a full full length movie instead of a made for tv series one, but i'm not sure it would have gotten made otherwise.

Deer Woman. Sigh. It's a comedy/horror/spoof. My least favorite types of movies, and oh! John Landis let his son write this... so we can get the whole clear ""John Landis is my father"" vibes from this (that's good! that's what redeems it, a bit). It's really a terrible movie, but it's 100% watchable, because it is so bad.  I do tell people about this a lot, because whenever a person in a movie or on a tv show does the head mashup with a pair of antlers behind them i gasp out ""DEER WOMAN!"" . It's not good, it's terrible, but i almost like it. almost.

I'm giving this bluray a 5 star, because despite not having the bonus content of all of the dvds, the picture and quality make up for it.",1436572800,,1875,4.059459459459459
