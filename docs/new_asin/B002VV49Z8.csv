8382542,5,B002VV49Z8,"I record this show on TV and it is adorable! No crude language, sweet puppies, (which I love) and beautiful scenes from Oregon. I truly love this show! A few scenes in this series are sad, but hey, the cuteness makes up for it (LOL;).  Plus, during the sad scenes, they play cheerful music, which is why I recommend this for all ages. It is basically a show with cute dogs, e.g., Champson, Girlfriend, Skully, Gunner, Pirate Dog, Rosebud, (really cute) and Abbygail, the most adorable of the bunch! I highly recommend this product. This series is to die for! Creators of this, PLEASE keep making Tails of Abbygail!!! I look forward to episode 8! ... FYI, this is a kid review (via parent).",1387497600,2,689,4.556451612903226
