8168374,5,B000MFI72Q,"It's a wonderful movie for those who grew up in the Soviet Union, very philosophical, about meaning of life and love. A movie director (very famous Mark Zakharov) plays with a story of the visit of count Cagliostro (an Italian magician and fraudster) to Russia in XVIII century. Pieces of this movie's dialogues are heavily cited in the every day Russian language and jokes about life in Russia are right on spot and can be easily applied to today's life. You can't see movies like this one in America... unfortunately.",1445212800,,519,4.777777777777778
8168375,5,B000MFI72Q,"The movie is based on the story ""Count Cagliostro"" by Aleksei Tolstoy.  This Tolstoy was a politically favored writer in the Soviet Union, not the great writer of Anna Karenina.  On the surface it is an amusing story about an 18th Century con man, Count Cagliostro.  There is obviously another story that is being told in parallel.  What it is would only be evident to someone who lived in the Soviet Union at the time.  I don't have a clue about what it was.",1359849600,,459,4.416666666666667
