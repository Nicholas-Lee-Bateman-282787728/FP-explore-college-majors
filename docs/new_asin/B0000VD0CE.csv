That's the fate of these old movies I guess, they get ravaged by time. I wanted to enjoy these, but it's pretty much impossible. Father Time has had his revenge on these babies. Too bad.",1514764800,,357,4.343283582089552

The cover art indicates that two discs are included, yet product data say it's one disc.

8003648,1,B0000VD0CE,"This 2-disc set offers nothing more than John Wayne's most outdated, horrible movies from the 30's. Almost all of these films feature a rather very young John Wayne in various westerns that were almost all made by the long-defunct Lone Star Pictures company. The main thing about these westerns is that they all tend to be almost too similar to each other and they all have very similar plots and almost none of these movies have aged well at all. Of all these movies, Only Lawless Frontier was watchable [Mostly because of Earl Dwire's decent performance as the mexican/indian villain], Angel & The Badman wasn't that bad neither [Being that i actually can't stand romantic westerns]. All of the rest of these movies are extremely boring [Even for their very short running times, All under an hour a piece], Suffer from a lack of action and coherent plotting and thus this 2-disc set is simply not worth owning. Prior to ''Stagecoach'', John Wayne wasn't in too many good movies and this set does nothing but to further prove that claim right by offering this sorry batch of movies. If you can, I'd reccomend you trying to find Lawless Frontier as a seperate title at a very cheap price [No more than $6] and avoid this and other cheap John Wayne sets. For good John Wayne movies, Try these: Stagecoach, El Dorado, MCQ, The Green Berets [One of The Duke's most underrated movies], Mclintock!, The Shootist, Back To Bataan, Sands Of Iwo Jima, Or even The Alamo.",1193270400,3,1461,4.7109375
