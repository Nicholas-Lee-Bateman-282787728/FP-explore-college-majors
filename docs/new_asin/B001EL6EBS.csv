3555678,1,B001EL6EBS,"Although this show was great, I am extremely disappointed in the greed shown by the company to only release season 4 as a box set.  I bought 3 full sets of Seasons 1-3 for my family as well as my brother and sisters kids.  Now HIT is taking my support and trying to get me to buy 3 more full sets of Seasons 1-3 to get the 4th season.  I have never bought bootlegs before because I believe in supporting the company, but this has changed my mind.  Likewise I will never buy another single season set of any HIT product as they are likely to do the same thing with other series.  As my mother always said, ""Fool me once, shame on you, but I won't get fooled again.""  I urge everyone not to buy this set as well and to complain to the company.",1220832000,30,741,4.041095890410959

I can't decide which it is.",1220400000,18,400,4.811594202898551
3555681,1,B001EL6EBS,"--- SEE EDIT AT BOTTOM ---

The first comment is correct: HIT Entertainment currently has no plans to release an individual box set of the fourth (and final) season of Fraggle Rock.  Of all TV series to be released on DVD, this is the first to put out a complete series mega-set without finishing the season-by-season run.

Those of you (and there are MANY) who purchased the first three seasons since 2005 are stuck having to re-buy 75% of the series if you want to finish your collections.

If you want an individual Season 4 box set of Fraggle Rock, please let HIT know!  Fan support (and consumer correspondence) is what convinced them to release season box sets in the first place.  Your support CAN help change their minds.

--- EDIT 6/16/2009 ---

HIT Entertainment no longer distributes Fraggle Rock for the Jim Henson Company. If you wish to see an individual Season 4, the best bet would now be to contact Henson directly. They welcome consumer comments on their Twitter account, which is probably the most efficient way to get in touch with them:

3555682,5,B001EL6EBS,"This item is ideal if you haven't bought the other editions by now or it is indeed a lovely gift to a nephew or niece who is still to discover Fraggle Rock.

I do think Hit should have issued a stand alone edition as well as this box set since not everyone can afford to re-buy what they already own nor should they have too in order to access the last series. As you can see from all these reviews it was possibly not the best marketing venture for Hit to take.

I do believe however that a stand alone edition will be on sale eventually ... I mean, they would be foolish not to do this. I do believe that this box-set is worth every penny and if you did buy this item for your family then it will be worth the cost and no doubt it will be something of a collectors item one day ... however these things are to be enjoyed, life is too short!

So, yes I agree with everyone here but I like to believe that Hit wanted to create something wonderful for the fans and I imagine this is something of a Swans song, for as much as I would love Fraggle Rock to return it may not hit all the right notes again. It will be interesting to see what they can do with the Fraggle world since season four wrapped up many ideas which had been running through out the series ... the Gorgs were at peace with the Fraggles ... the Doozers and the Fraggles understood each other more fully and Doc came to see the wonder of another world and grew, spiritually I would say, as a result of this encounter.

Fraggle Rock has not been released in England in the same fashion, in series box sets, since someone lost all the master tapes and only 12 episodes remain. For me I will always love the idea of Fraggle Rock existing under a light house, just off the coast of Scotland; as this reinforced the idea Fraggle Rock offered, that it was a beacon for a better world and like a light house, guided it's audience to better shores. Falton Mackay was the Captain of Fraggle Rock Light House and Sprocket (puppeteered by David Barclay and Louise Gold over here) still retained his proud, stubborn and playful manner. I also loved the juxtaposition between the real world and the Fraggle World; the light house scenes were airy, with the sounds of seagulls out side and the waves against rocks and this contrasted the subterranean world of Fraggle Rock beautifully. I would still like to think that the British version will one day appear but till then, this is a wonderful reminder and we have at least 12 episodes. So, yes, I have bought this item....",1219363200,11,2525,4.298319327731092
3555683,5,B001EL6EBS,"For all Fraggle fans who have been eagerly anticipating the release of Season 4 (the final season of the series)...  It looks as if you'll have to wait a while longer, that is, if you get it at all.

As of this writing, there are no plans from HIT Entertainment of LionsGate distribution to release a stand alone Season 4 set.  We will be getting the Complete Series boxset this November 4th however.

So, in short, all you loyal fans who have previously purchased seasons 1-3 are stuck having to buy them all over again within the boxset set to get the whole series.  Not very fraggley of them at all.

While I suspect there will eventually be a stand-alone Season 4 set, there's certainly no quaruntee of it happening.

A bit of a suggestion for those who do plan to buy the series set and already own the individual first, second, and third seasons...  Perhaps donating them to your local library so that many more people can enjoy this great show would be a good idea.  Spread the Fraggle joy.  :)

With all that said, we Fraggle fans have every right to complain and be miffed at the lack of a Season 4 set as we are the ones who supported Seasons 1-3 by buying them.  However, we should be at least a little thankful that we're getting Fraggle Rock on DVD at all.  It wasn't all that long ago when it seemed as if that would never happen.",1219276800,18,1344,4.328

3555748,1,B001EL6EBS,"I purchased the Fraggle Rock box set in June 2010.  At that time my daughter was 4 and my son was about to be born.  I figured this would be an excellent set to have in our library and the price was right, so I made the purchase.  In the meantime, before we opened the product, my daughter ended up seeing an episode that had a giant talking pile of garbage, which frightened her, so we kept the unopened product on the shelf for a year until she wasn't freaked out by the idea of watching it again.

People who have reviewed this product mention that the packaging is ""terrible.""  Personally I didn't have a problem with the packaging.  The DVDs were all seated in the set correctly; there were no loose discs, no scratches, no problems whatsoever.  We sat down to watch the first disc, and the first episode was flawless.  During episode two, there was a point where the episode froze.  The only way to get past it was to restart the episode and skip scenes until we were past the part that froze up, so we ended up missing about 3-4 minutes of the show in order to skip past it.  Other than that, episode 2 went fine.

Episodes 3, 4, and 5 were all very problematic, freezing up many times throughout each episode, and seeming very jittery.  These episodes were completely unwatchable.  As you would expect, I was hoping that the problem was isolated to just the first disc, so we attempted to watch disc two.  We had the very same problem with the first two episodes on disc two also.  Looking at the physical discs themselves, there were NO SIGNS of any damage.  No scratches, no warping, nothing.

In the absence of any physical evidence, this narrows things down to 2 key theories:

1.  Maybe I have DVD player issues.  We have one player on the 2nd floor, one player on the main floor, and three players in the basement (a standard player, a Sony PS3, and an xbox).  These discs had identical problems on EVERY player in our home, and these players do not have similar issues with other discs.  I tested the discs on the DVD players of friends and family, and everyone had the same problem.  Clearly the problem was with the discs themselves and not with the DVD players involved.

2.  Perhaps the set was damaged while in my home.  The set was sitting high on a shelf, in the packaging and untouched, for an entire year.  The family room in my basement is kept at about 66 degrees year round.  It is not humid and the temperature never really changes.  The discs remained correctly seated in the cases.  The shelf is full of other DVDs and blu ray discs, and all of those work fine.  Nothing pointed to any post-purchase damage, but a year had passed so I couldn't really rule it out.

Another year and a half passed.  In February 2013, I finally bit the bullet and ordered another NEW set from Amazon.com.  This time I opened it immediately, and yes... you guessed it...  The discs were seated in their cases perfectly (no loose discs, no scratches).  Still, two and a half years after my original purchase, discs 1 and 2 of this set were once again plagued with the same issues.  This time I tested the discs throughout my home and I also brought them to work, and they froze up there too.  I immediately returned the set to Amazon.com and got a full refund.

But I still have the original set that I purchased in 2010.  Yes, I can test the remaining discs in the set, and maybe I will find that the problems are isolated to discs 1 and 2.  But the testing process is highly frustrating.  When these discs lock up, they are completely locked.  You cannot just fast-forward past the issue.  You either have to stop the episode and restart from the main menu, or you have to power down the player completely and start over, every single time, and it happens over and over again throughout the episode.  And if the kids are there with you, hoping to watch an episode, forget about it... they're completely miserable throughout the entire process.  Endlessly frustrating for everyone involved.

If you do take a chance on making this purchase, open the set immediately and test AT LEAST the first two discs right away.  Good luck!",1364169600,2,4137,4.460614152202937

Watching these again with my very young children, I am finding that the music is brilliant. It sounds as if they have the Blues Brother's band jamming on many of these songs. The melodies are great! I was amazed to watch the behind the scenes portions.
For the music and simplistic puppets you can have a 2 year old enjoy the set. Older kids and even us adults can get a lot of good advice and wisdom from the Fraggles as well. Henson was a genius!",1343952000,,561,4.063063063063063

3555842,5,B001EL6EBS,"Here is how I would rate this product:

- Packaging......: 8 / 10
- Video Quality..: 10 / 10
- Arrangement....: 10 / 10
- Overall........: 9.5 / 10

For anyone who purchased the previous Complete Series which was released in 2008, you know how horrible it was arranged and packaged.  Most people who ordered the old version received it in shambles.  The discs were scattered throughout the box and many people reported scratched or damaged discs.

The packaging for this new product is much better.  Each season is packaged in its own rigid plastic case (same style as most DVDs come in).  Each case has an individual cardboard sleeve, and all 4 seasons fit into a simple cardboard cover.

I purchased my copy off a store shelf (I didn't have it shipped).  At the store, there were 3 copies on the shelf, and unfortunately, all three copies ""rattled"" when I tipped them over, which indicated to me that there were probably loose discs inside.  I chose the copy which had the smallest ""rattle"" to it.  When I opened the product, I found that Seasons 1 and 2 were packaged with a foam cushion which prevented them from moving around.  Seasons 3 and 4 had no cushion, and 3 of these discs had come loose. There was no damage to any of the discs.

I found the packaging to be satisfactory, but if I needed to buy a 2nd copy, I would most likely purchase it from a store where I can ""shake"" the product before buying.

In regard to extra features, I personally will not rate this.  I don't usually watch the extras, nor do I care about the table of contents and other inserts that come with these kinds of products.  I was only sharing my experience with the packaging of the product.  I hope this information is helpful to anyone who may be hesitant after the horrible quality of the 2008 product.",1257552000,71,1793,4.467692307692308

3555846,1,B001EL6EBS,"I have not bought this set. I wanted to voice my agreement with many of the rest of you in that this boxed set was poorly thought out and marketed on greed alone.

There is also one important point that I think some of you may have missed. There are in fact 5 seasons to Fraggle Rock:
Season 1: 1983 - 24 episodes
Season 2: 1984 - 24 episodes
Season 3: 1984 to 1985 - 22 episodes
Season 4: 1986 - 13 episodes
Season 5: 1987 - 13 episodes

Seeing how well this boxed set was executed, it makes me wonder if the 5th season will ever see the light of day. Does anyone know if they simple combined the 4th and 5th seasons onto the same final boxed set labeled the 4th season because of the reduced amount of episodes in each? I really hope HIT goes back to the original format they released the first 3 seasons in. My kids absolutely love this series as I did when i was a child.",1252454400,,875,4.022988505747127

  Because its been almost 20 yrs. since we've seen the show & we're glad someone took the time to design this beautiful set & bring this show back to life.

  Howevever I am in agreement with people on these points:

1. HIT Entertainment screwed up by not finishing the indvidual releases first & then the ultimate collection. I feel people should have the choice but because seasons 4 & 5 are only available in the ultimate collection those that can't afford it got shafted.

2. Although the binder is really nice I feel they should have come up with a better way of securing the discs to safeguard from scratching

  Besides those two issues the case is relly beautiful & neat look at & I love the raised 3D Logo, Artwork & Discs are bright & beautiful.
  This show takes us back to our childhood & hopefully takes you back to yours as well.  For those who don't own this set it's a definite must own.

3555849,4,B001EL6EBS,"All right, let's get what everyone else is yelling about out of the way, the makers have left everyone that bought the first 3 seasons hi and dry, there's no question there. (And I have a spare season one laying about too... so I'm no better off.)  I'd not be surprised if that's why they didn't get renewed to continue putting out the DVDs.  Sounds like poetic justice to me.

Now, on to the set I have, First and foremost, I love this set.  The packaging is nice and it is very well thought out.  Too bad the same thought was put into the holding of the discs, I lucked out and found one that didn't have scratched discs, but most of them where not in there slots and I had to put them back in.  I can't imagine being that lucky by mail since there's basically a binder inside of it that could easily break discs.  Also if you hold the box the wrong way they just come flying out of the slots again, a pain if you have friends/kids that just like to pick things up.

So overall, I have to say this, I mainly bought this because I love the show and was able to get it at [...] at the time, thus better then getting two seasons solo and I love it at that price.  I just don't think I would go the whole set at over a hundred.  In the end, four stars for top notch set, not getting the last star for the unsecured discs and for the overly high price point.",1249948800,,1355,4.022388059701493

They just needed to be pushed back down their pockets once it arrived (One was loose but it was on the same page that it was supposed to be, undamaged).

3555851,3,B001EL6EBS,"I can understand, and do truly empathize with the people here who purchased the individual season-by-season packs of this show. There is an unspoken and unofficial understanding between consumers and DVD companies that if they release these season-by-season packs, then they will do it completely, and usually also release a full boxed set once the run is complete for those who didn't buy the individuals. HIT chose not to go that way, and that sucks big time. However, that said, the discs in this set are great. There is ample bonus material, and they didn't leave anything out. However, I also echo some consumer complaints here about the packaging. These kinds of packaging schemes are very annoying, and this one is near the top in annoyance factor. The way it is, you can't really set it in a library in any good way. The front is just a plastic inset that fits inside the box, so if you stand it up to face out, that plastic feels really loose. So, ditch the box you say? Well, not really, since the binder that the DVDs are actually in has an odd moulded shape to it, and wouldn't ""feel"" right just laying around naked and alone. Another case of the art/marketing department run amok, with no real sense for practicality. It actually kind of makes you not want to get them out and watch them, because it's such a hassle. Bad form HIT. That and the cardboard sleeves (as others have said) have a bad habit of letting the DVDs just slip out and rattle around. On second thought, I was going to give this 4 stars, but after writing this I'm changing it to 3. Good show, good DVD production, bad packaging, downright stupid release plan.",1244332800,,1642,4.569491525423729

I bought each of the individual seasons put out by this company, and was very upset when they announced they were not putting out a stand alone set for the last season, but instead would have to purchase the entire series (thereby repurchasing the 3 seasons I'd already bought from them..) This annoyed a LOT of muppet fans.
Anyway, I now have this as well.  A lot of people had problems with disks being scratched to the point where they needed to get replacement disks.  I got lucky and do not seem to have had that problem, though nearly half my disks were loose on arrival.  The packaging looks great, but is really impractical. It does not fit well on most shelves intended for dvd collections, it is a complicated, multi-step process to get in and out, and the disks do not stay well inside the cardboard sleeves. This leads to lots of sliding in and out, causing the disks to be scratched and damaged.
Like most people I've talked to who have this, I've taken the disks out and placed them in a different case and this big piece of art they call packaging, is sitting elsewhere off by itself.
It is a shame that this company made some of the decisions they did.  They alienated a lot of their customers and most of us will think several times before buying any sort of series from them.
The show itself is, of course, as wonderful now as it was originally, and it is a testament to that fact that so many of us have put up with this mess and basically bought the series twice in order to get the final season. I wish I could give this 5 stars.. for the show.. definately rates that, but the packaging and HIT's decisions have to knock a few stars off..",1241222400,6,1680,4.340764331210191

Content wise, this set is great as it comes with all the episodes for all the seasons. I'm not a big fan of bonus materials (who has time to watch all that stuff??), so I can't comment on that. As for packaging, everyone who's written a review on it has been spot on. I don't know who designed this thing, but he was definitely not the sharpest knife in the drawer. The sleeve design is awful. Not only do the DVD's slide out when you receive your package (mine had 3 that came out), I feel like I'm scratching the DVD's everytime I slide the them back into the sleeve. I'm sure it's not doing that, but I definitely feel that way.

It's definitely worth $59, as they are going for more than that on Ebay.

Finally, Amazon has stepped up to the plate where HiT would not.  Amazon has lowered the price of the set to astoundingly only $60!  The single season sets cost around $30 to $40 when they originally were released, so this really is a HUGE bargain.  I want to applaud Amazon for doing this.  It's not their fault that HiT has screwed over so many fans.

When I got to the binder 50% of the discs were loose, every page had the 2nd disc out of its pocket.  Design overall for this set is just terrible.

Bonus material is pretty much non-existent, I have to hold on to my other sets just to keep the cool stuff that came with it.

It has complex themes that children can grasp and doesn't talk down to them. I truly wish there was more than just the four seasons.

Having said that, I'm really disappointed the way the release was handled. It seems like a big money grab where it really doesn't need to be. If I didn't have my kids, I probably would join the big boycott. I'm not willing to wait a couple years for something that may or may not come about, so I purchased it. Fortunately, I got a nice price on it ($58 shipped) ... I would have begrudged the money had I paid list price.

The packaging is so-so. Not nearly as nice as the previous sets. Had they not set such a high standard, I wouldn't have noticed. The molded plastic face of the binder is a little weird - makes it kind of goofy to store. All my discs were loose, but undamaged upon arrival.

So if, like me, you purchased Seasons One through Three you have to BUY THEM AGAIN to get Season 4. The company seems to have no intention of producing a US-viewable Season 4 (even though they did in Region 4 Australia and just would need to recode the DVD regionality). I called the company. The girl was defensive and tried to say ""Well, this is a special celebration DVD"" but, of course, that doesn't address the problem. They really and absolutely broke faith with me and thousands of other buyers. To make matters worse, this ""celebration"" collection has nowheres the production values of the smaller sets. Instead of thick, plastic holders this set has cardboard slotted for the DVDs in a three-ring binder. Instead of nice boxes you get one where you have to remove every time a thin plastic overlay before taking out the binder of DVDs. Almost surely that box will fail soon. In the smaller sets you got physical ""souvenirs"" such as a copy of Jim Henson's notebook, Michael Frith's original sketches and Jim Henson's pitchbook. These are NOT included in this super-special ""celebration"" package. Well, I've decided two things. First, I had to buy this because I just must have Season 4. But I will be double darn dogged if I ever ever ever allow this company to rip me off like this again. I will NEVER again buy season sets from them up until whatever new show's megaset is out and all seasons are available. I hope that enough people will do this that even though they may weasel their way into extra sales on The Fraggles that the overall effect will be to hurt their revenue stream in the future as me and all other offended fans turn away from them -- as they richly deserve.

3555889,5,B001EL6EBS,"I've never written anything up on Amazon before, but I felt compelled to share my opinion of this great set.
First off... yes, it sucks they didn't release season 4 at the same time...they're ripping people off...blah blah blah. In all honesty, I agree with the sentiment, but really people, stop complaining. Looking at it from a pure price point of view, if you buy this you're still getting the entire series for less than buying them all separately. And that's just if you buy it from Amazon... sorry Amazon, but if you do a little shopping around you can get it for as low as $60.00 - and that's brand new, including shipping. Would you rather get each season for $20-$25... or all four for $60? It's actually a great deal.
And let me talk for a moment about the packaging. It's very well-made and sturdy, not to mention it looks great on your shelf. And the complaints about loose discs? Well, it seems HIT entertainment has actually listened to the complaints in that regard - my set was packaged with cardboard AND plastic around the sleeves inside the binder. Needless to say, everything was in its place when opened.
I only have one complaint with the set: the clear plastic front of the box just sort of sits inside the rest of the packaging, making it basically impossible for you to display it in the obvious way - sitting with its front facing outward - without the contents sliding out. Very easy to fix, however: just a little square of Velcro (or two small magnets), cut and super-glued on both sides and then pressed together. This seems to be a common problem with some of these box sets. They go to the trouble to make a nice package, and then forget to include a magnet or fastening device to hold it closed (same deal with the recent Cosby series set). However, most importantly, they included a small embedded magnet inside the binder itself to hold that closed.
All in all, this is really a great product. I mean, if I was paying the full $140 retail price for this, I might be a little more apt to complain about small things, but getting it for the price I got it for (or even Amazon's price) it's well worth the money.",1229817600,7,2145,4.474489795918367

Leave it to greedy corporations to deny me my second childhood without paying a large price.  I want season four now! I'm not going to pay for seasons I already own. Got it?!",1225929600,14,276,4.092592592592593
3555911,1,B001EL6EBS,"To date, I've purchased all released seasons of Fraggle Rock on DVD.  Unfortunately, the last two seasons were not individually released, so I decided to buy the complete series.

I was leery about purchasing the complete series, though.  The images I saw of the packaging left me a little apprehensive.  And, for good reason.  After looking at all discs in the collection, every single one of them is scratched in some form.  Fortunately, those discs with the deeper scratches seem to play all right.  <knocks on wood>

Aside from the scratches due to horrific packaging, the show is still just as brilliant now as it was when I was a child.",1225929600,13,642,4.7207207207207205
3555912,1,B001EL6EBS,"My email to HIT Entertainment:
Your decision not to release Season 4 as a stand alone set is a mistake.  Fans/consumers are posting their disappointment in reviews and ratings across the internet.  In the end you will miss out on a large amount of sales.  How many DVD's do you think have good sales numbers when over 80% of the comments on Amazon and other sites are negative?  You won't be getting my money.  There are plenty of other competing children's shows whose DVD's I can buy.  And I was so looking forward to sharing Fraggle Rock with my new born daughter.  You need to hire children of the 80's who grew up watching Fraggle Rock because your current marketing team is completely out of touch with the consumer.",1225843200,14,722,4.550387596899225
3555913,1,B001EL6EBS,"So i broke down and bought this today. I had originally bought the first five single dvd's that came out (where it all began, dance your cares away, etc.), then rebought most of those epesodes with the first three season releases. I figured, ""What the heck. I'll suck it up and buy it."" Let me tell you that those of you who decided not too are better off.  This is just awful.

First, the packaging is horrible. The binder like book that the dvd's are held in makes it very easy for them to fall out and come loose in the box. When first opened it, about a third of the discs were out of the sleeves.

Second is the Bonus material. there are some new on disc pieces that were not offered on the first three sets, but thats pretty much it.  none of the extra little things that made the other sets fun (like the character art pages from season three). The only non-disc extra in the box is a poster sized concept art picture of ""The fraggle rock universe"".

And third, it even lacks the one sentence synopsis of the episodes that was included with the other season releases. It just lists the names of the episodes on the pages opposite the discs.

It seems that all the thought that went into making the first three season sets special went right out the door when they came up nwith the idea for this set. It's simply a plan to drain money out of fans, and i guess they got away with one here.  I higly reccommend NOT BUYING THIS SET.  rather wait and hope they release the fourth season by itself with some actual thought for the fans.

Hope this helps at least one person.",1225756800,149,1576,4.261744966442953
3555914,1,B001EL6EBS,No stand alone season 4? boilerplate responses that ignore the questions being asked to fans inquiries? O got some friends above ground waiting for the people that made this horrible greedy decision.,1225584000,10,199,5.25
3555915,5,B001EL6EBS,"Yes, I bought the three previous season sets.

And yes, not releasing season 4 separately is a huge marketing mistake, because the last thing any company should do is piss off loyal customers.

I gave it a lot of thought and decided to still buy this set, eBay-ing off the first three volumes. And guess what, I sold the sets for only roughly $20.00 less than the cost of the complete series. So, for me it was a good deal after all. (Not so much for the people who bought them. But hey, I started the auctions at 1.00, so it's really the bidders fault, not mine.)

Now, to the set...

The box is wonderful to behold. The big Fraggle Rock logo inside the transparent packaging is actually three-dimensional and looks like a real piece of the Rock. Simply gorgeous, the pictures on Amazon don't do it justice.

The logo is actually the frontpiece of a sturdy binder that holds ten fold-out cardboard panels. Each of the panels contains wonderful artwork and promotional photos as well as two discs. (Yes, two discs slid out during transport, but there's no big danger of scratching in this set.)

The discs are consecutively numbered 1 to 20, and the different seasons are color-coded.

Even though the printing on the discs is different, the first 15 are exactly the same as the original releases - same menu screens and everything.

And here's the deal: When you pop in the season 4 DVDs, the menu doesn't say 'disc 16' but rather 'Season 4 - Disc 1'. Which means that HIT can sell these as a separate release without having to re-author anything. I guess that's a ray of hope for those that are waiting for a standalone season 4.

I don't have to say anything about the episodes themselves. Especially the last few are absolutely brilliant television, wrapping things up beautifully.

Picture and sound are on par with the first three sets, meaning as good as it can get for a series from the 80s that was recorded on video rather than film. Good job indeed. Still no subtitles though.

Disc 20 holds the bonus material, and this time they have outdone themselves. You get more than 100 minutes of different featurettes: the Gorg puppeteers discussing their roles, puppet design, an overview of season 4 (discussing among other things the final story arc), a small piece about the directors, and 15 minutes about the show's music.

The real gold is yet to come, though: a ten-minute piece on the evolution of the theme song, as well as more than 20 minutes footage from the last day of shooting and the wrap party. The party has the Fraggles appearing live onstage for a song and a speech by Henson.

Almost forgot: The packaging also includes a large print of a Michael Frith illustration showing the Fraggle world (Outer Space, the Rock and the Gorg's castle). Gorgeuos, I'll definitely frame and hang it.

Bottom line: Crappy marketing stragegy... But a gorgeous set, with season 4 it has the best episodes Fraggle Rock has to offer, and a bevy of brilliant bonus material. All in all, a definite five-star product.

So if you can sell the first three sets for a good price, or have them be a gift to someone you like, or even want to donate them to your library - go for this set. Worth every penny.",1225584000,55,3205,4.578671328671328
3555916,1,B001EL6EBS,"This is such a let down if the bottom line is we bought 3 season of F.R. to buy them again in a box set so we could watch the 4th and final one...the greed of these people should make sure they get a new level of hell dedicated just to them.

P.S. you can find the box set CHEAPER @ HITS ENTERTAINMENTS WEB SITE FOR $87.99. But I won't buy it even for that much those basterds!",1225497600,11,377,3.8333333333333335

That after buying 3 season season sets once a year, I will not be able to complete my collection unless I want to shell out another $100 for this box set. Sorry, not going to happen. I lose and they lose. Great way to reward your fans. I thought George Lucas was greedy, but this is worse.

And for people saying not to ""rush"" when buying things, I'm sorry but my crystal ball must be broken so I can't see 3-4 years into the future to predict this. I was prepared for a box set that might have better packaging and a few new bonus features not on the individual sets, but that was to be anticipated. Not getting a season 4 individual release at all was not, so stop acting like you are better because you waited. If you don't buy individual seasons when they come out, often the later seasons never get put on DVD due to poor sales, so you are damned if you do or damned if you don't.

Hopefully poor sales will force a season 4 release at some point. I hope!",1225497600,15,1014,4.090452261306533

I was in a sort of similar situation when M*A*S*H was being released individually. then in their full box set(all we were missing was the bonus material that they released in the box set but not in the season sets,no where as bad as this is I know) & I joined the many fans who wrote,e-mailed & called FOX repeatedly till eventually they released the bonus stuff! Had to repurchase the final episode but was worth it to get the missing material without having to buy the whole box set. Anyway I stand with you all that were in essense given the royal kick in the butt after supporting them by buying the first 3 season sets & then told to go jump in a lake.......I will not buy this till HIT pulls thier heads out of their butt!

How much MORE money would they have made by releasing Season 4 ALONG WITH the complete box set? Compounded sales from the Complete Set for those who waited AND sales of Season 4 for those who supported all along. Win/Win? Instead they decide to create a situation where not only will they lose sales of the Complete Set because those of us who bought 1, 2 and 3 will not buy it, but they will lose future sales of the stand-alone Seasons 1, 2 and 3 if a Season 4 never sees the light of day.

Those of you who are angry about the lack of the 4th season release alone do not worry (be patient and utilize the contact info convienently located within the reviews here and let Hit Ent. know), you most likely make up the majority of fans.  When the Complete Season boxsets do not sell, hopefully they will be forced to sell Season 4 to make up for the money they've lost with the Complete Series production.  I think I am better off waiting for Season 4 as well!  If they choose not to release Season 4 (like they did with the Mokey plush) we can always sell off the single seasons we have on ebay (amazon or your local resell DVD store) and take advantage of the lower price of the Complete Series boxset (once it finally seriously reduces in price, probably within a year or two).

i hate to say this but hit knows there are people like me thats not willing to take the chance on them not releaseing the last set.
its happen to me to miny times.
so im not willing to take that chance.
thats a dirty trick hit.
you dirty the name of fraggle rock.
you should of gave the people the choice of witch they want to get. ill try to sell my 3 set of them but i have a feeling thats not going to be easy with out the 4th one.
and im not going to buy the 4th just so i can sell them if you did later on release it.
i hate greedy people like yall.
well i just about have all the shows i want other then new shows that come out from time to time.
so people like you cant milk me no more. >8-)
ok iv added my two cents in on this ideal.
sorry folks im just not a risk taker.
i feel for yall too.
but i love my shows more then my own life.
for yall takeing the risk i hope you get your 4th later at least. good luck!

here an update... i just got it.
well they goffed it up big time.
there is nothing to hold the disks in place so in shiping they all come out and got messed up.
what was they thinking?
and on top of it you cant set it upright. the cover come off. you can only set it flat. what a joke.
i wish they just released the 4th set id been a lot happyer. geting replacement will not help you they will be the same way. so if you want to wait it out and hope the 4th set comes out that be the best thing to do.
im crazy for doing this but ill keep it just in case they don't release the 4th set. im just not a risk taker.
so if you go for this box set you know what you will get.
all will do the same thing.
its up to you to decide what your going to do now.

I don't see why this couldn't have been handled differently.  Season 4 could have been released this Christmas and the box set released next year for us fanatics.  Following is my letter and I'll post if I receive a response:

Is it true that you are not releasing Season 4 of Fraggle Rock as a stand-alone product?  I have bought the first three seasons for all the children in my life since they became available.  For years, I looked forward to being able to do so and was thrilled when they finally came out on DVD.

Please say that Season 4 will be coming out as a single purchase as it makes no sense environmentally, financially or practically to buy the complete set when you already own the first three seasons.  If this is an example of corporate greed, then you win the prize as the greediest predator of family consumers that I've heard of.  I'm sure plenty of people would still buy the whole set - completists, people who haven't yet bought the first three seasons, and people like myself, who have other youngsters they want to get this wonderful series for.

If this is just a matter of Season 4 not being released before the box set and it is eventually coming out, then please let me know and the thousands of other Fraggle Rock fans who are extremely disgruntled and disillusioned by this thoughtless marketing.

For myself, I will not buy the complete collection until Season 4 is released as a stand-alone.  I went for years without seeing Fraggle Rock while waiting for its release.  I can manage to live without it in the future.  I sure would like to be able to purchase it, but not when it means having several other DVDs that will end up in a box in the garage or worse - the landfill.

Please address this issue and I'd appreciate a reply to my query.

I loved this growing up and my kids love it now and to think I would have to pay 125.00 to finish it well that is just too much. I mean its bad enough that we wait over a year for the next season and now this. I bet if Jim was still alive this would never happen I hope they don't sell even one.",1221955200,29,675,3.598639455782313

3555941,5,B001EL6EBS,Been in the uk i have to buy most of my dvd collection from the rest of the world like the usa and australia because we don't seem to get the same stuff released here. So it's lucky that i got a multi region dvd player that can play R1 to R6 for 20 from my local supermarket. So i was looking into fraggle rock season 4 after hearing the release had been cancelled and i went on an australia website that i had used before that was really good only took 5 days for my dvd's to arrive so i put fraggle rock in not expected to find season 4 but to my surprise i did! The website is [...] and you can buy fraggle rock - the complete 4th season for AU$19.83 plus AU$5.50 for p&p to the USA. So i thought some of you may find this review helpful if you have a multi region dvd player like me or already have the other 3 sets and are not willing to buy the complete box set just for the 4th season because i wouldn't be either.,1221955200,18,921,3.878306878306878
3555942,1,B001EL6EBS,"Like everyone posting on here, I grew up with Fraggle Rock and I was so pathetic as a child that I used to put my tape recorder in front of the TV and then listened to Fraggle episodes in my bedroom (in the early 80's 5-year-olds didn't have their own entertainment center in their bedrooms).

Like everyone else, I also bought the first three seasons on DVD but not just for me--my brother's birthday is actually this week and for the last three years I've picked up a box set for myself and one for him as a gift.  After buying six seasons on DVD at $35 a pop, I can assure you there's no way I would even contemplate buying the complete sets.  And now I have to actually put some thought in what to buy my brother ;)

I wrote to HIT about a month ago expressing my disappointment and reminding them that they are turning off the entire fan base just as the movie is supposedly going through, which is not really a smart thing on their part.  Naturally I got no reply.  I sure hope they are reading everyone's comments on this page.",1221782400,34,1034,4.223350253807107

3555944,1,B001EL6EBS,"I had much admiration for HIT when they started releasing the full season box sets of Fraggle Rock. As each season was released, for 3 years, I faithfully bought each season. Now, they greedily withhold the last season and decide to release this full series box set instead. Shame on HIT. It is truly a slap in the face to the fans who bought all the other series as they released them. We supported them, now they do this to thank us for our loyalty to their company? ARE YOU LISTENING HIT?

A set like this is great - if all the other seasons have already been released. But it's not the case. Although I will have an incomplete set, I WILL NOT buy this just to get the last episodes. I refuse to buy something twice, just to fall into HIT's marketing gimmick. I've already given HIT over $100 - and I won't give them another $100 so they can laugh at how stupid I am would I buy this.

Again, shame on you HIT.",1221609600,30,913,4.181818181818182

***EDIT***

I wound up purchasing this set since I found people to gift my old sets... I truly wish I hadn't. The packaging is HORRID!

13 of the 20 discs were floating free in the box. This will happen with nearly every set as the design has no way to lock the discs into notebook-style sleeves.

There are also no nifty trinkets such as Henson's notebook & pitchbook as found in 1 & 2 and Frith's sketches in set 3. There is a basic map of Fraggle Rock.... big deal.

For those being tempted to give away their old sets to pick this up... DON'T!!!",1221523200,71,678,4.307086614173229

3555947,1,B001EL6EBS,"Below is an e-mail that I just sent to HIT Entertainment (consumerrelations@hitentertainment.com). If you, like me, loyally bought Seasons 1-3 then please do not buy this set! PLEASE BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE AND TELL HIT WHY YOU'RE DOING IT!!

Dear Silly People,

It just goes to show that you really never know what they'll do next. I wrote to HIT once before as part of a campaign to get the wonderfully original and timeless television show 'Fraggle Rock' released on DVD. As soon as it was possible to do so, I pre-ordered each of the first three seasons. As September came nearer, I looked out for Season Four to complete my set only to find that there is no Season Four. Apparently HIT expects loyal fans such as myself who are largely responsible for this series finally being available on DVD to spend an absurd amount of money to get the final installment. That is as ridiculous as it is wrong. I am utterly appalled by HIT's decision to disregard loyal fans in a pathetic attempt to gain a few extra bucks on each sale.

To be clear, I fully intend to buy the complete series for my niece and nephew in the hopes that their childhood is as enriched by 'Fraggle Rock' as mine was. However, I will not purchase a separate set for them nor purchase any other items produced by HIT until 'Fraggle Rock: The Complete Fourth Season' is available individually, just like Seasons 1-3. I'm sure that reading early reviews of the box set on Amazon.com will show that I am not alone in this sentiment.

Regards,

Sami Assaf",1221350400,28,1518,4.5661764705882355

I adore Fraggle Rock and have faithfully bought the 1st 3 seasons every year since 2005. I was looking foward to completing the collection with Season 4 this year, only to find they're not releasing it, but instead are forcing their loyal fans and customers to re-purchase the 1st 3 seasons to get #4 in this box set. No way I'm going to spend $100 to rebuy DVDs I already have. Looks like I'll have to miss out on the finale of my favorite childhood show.",1221091200,26,577,4.401869158878505
