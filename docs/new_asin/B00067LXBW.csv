8039847,3,B00067LXBW,"I LOVE this movie.  I really do.  I have seen it many times.  I purchased this particular version because the subtitles on my other one weren't working, and I am severely disappointed in the subtitles.  They are yellowish and transparent, I guess to keep them from intruding on the scenes, but about 30% of the time they are almost impossible to see.  When the bottom of the screen happens to be a dark color, they are okay.  When it is light, though, you really can't see them at all.  Since I wanted to show this to non-Russian speakers, and the subtitles were the *main* reason I bought this film, I am really disappointed.  They were able to understand the movie but instead of it being relaxing they had to work for it.",1477094400,,724,4.431818181818182
8039848,3,B00067LXBW,"This movie was introduced to me by my Russian friends as a very on-topic work of the inter-family relations.

Briefly, a pre-WarII Soviet Ukrainian country-town - half-village,  so-called pre-Bolshevik-revolution Jewish shtettle-a ghetto Jews existed in the most of then Old World places, was awaken and changed dramatically under new regime, its inhabitants not only communicated with outsiders on personal merits but  freely leaved to bigger industrialized centers (Moscow inclusively) and even traveled round a globe.

Ability to move round then Stalin's USSR was hardly realistic itself even for the youngest viewers of 2004th, while then traveling to Palestine and back was an author's sci-fi surely, a very base for recently producing the philosophic deliberations much more reflecting the factual dissatisfaction of those found themselves back in shtettle in a ""developed civilized world"", more recent waves of the Jewish migrants of the eighties-ninetieth of the last century, grandchildren and children-talented professionals like David/Dmitry, a son of a small plant store-man movie character became.

Since 1956, intentionally or not to, this story has crossed both mere inter-family relation lines and time boundaries, of which demolishing followed collapse of the USSR and reinstating the Russian national statehood.",1310083200,,1329,5.829896907216495
8039849,4,B00067LXBW,"The film ""Papa"" (2004) is based on Aleksandr Galych's play ""Matrosskaya Tishina"" written in 1946. Aleksandr Galich, who had achieved a cult status in the Soviet Union as a dissident-poet, song-writer and singer was forced to leave the country in 1974 and died in exile, in Paris. He never lived to see his play on the stage because it was banned after its dress rehearsal before the premiere in 1956. The commission of Party bureaucrats that saw the play before its release decided that it was not a good idea to make a main character an uneducated Jewish single father with alcoholic problems. ""Matrosskaya Tishina was forbidden and forgotten for about 30 years.

Vladimir Mashkov, the writer/director/producer/star of the film, is one of the brightest and most popular modern Russian actors. He also successfully works behind the camera. Mashkov played the role of Abraham Schwartz on the stage when the play was finally released in the 90s, and to adapt ""Matrosskaya Tishina to the screen was his longtime dream: ""In general I performed this role over 400 times in different countries of the world: in Japan, Germany, France... I believe that a lot was written and said about maternal love. Unfortunately paternal love has not yet been praised enough. And then I realized that I had to make the movie ""Daddy"".

The film honestly depicts the complicated father-son relationship. Abraham Schwartz is not easy to like or respect but he loves his son dearly and dreams of his success as a violinist at the Moscow Conservatory. ""Papa"" realistically presents details of the Soviet realities from the 1930s to the middle of 1940s in Moscow and a small provincial town, as well as the tragic fate of many Soviet citizens including the victims of Holocaust during the long four years of WWII (Great Patriot War). The film which is very personal for its creator who plays against the type and practically lives in the role of an aging Jewish single father is moving, compelling, and treats us with wonderful violin music which is performed by one of the best musicians of our time, Vladimir Spivakov, the celebrated violinist and conductor. ""Papa"" deserves to be seen by many viewers not only in Russia but around the world.",1187136000,,2217,4.9093333333333335
