8596383,3,B00DQNYBHQ,"This is a me-too zombie film. During a viral zombie outbreak, a group of people hold up at a school because the mall has already been done twice. Time passes and relations develop during a music montage. With females in scarcity, this leads to some minor internal conflict as much of the film deals with developing personal relationships.

Zombies need the classic head shot to die. The title is a ""plot spoiler"" if such a thing is possible in a zombie film. What was unusual is that they wasted bullets target practicing on boxes, teaching civilians how to shoot when there were legions of zombies outside the fence. Think ""practice head shot."" It could have been a fun scene too...""Okay, now aim between the eyes of Prince Harry."" The film needed some light dialogue.

Worth a rental.",1414195200,2,786,4.7299270072992705
