7854537,5,6303890350,"Movie making doesn't get any better than ""Two Of A Kind!"" This is one of the most deeply moving films I have ever had the the privilege to watch! The chemistry between Robby Benson and George Burns is magnificent! The acting is so phenomenal,  I'm going to locate any film Robby Benson has ever made! I miss George Burns, and  I have never seen him in a drama before! At first, I almost didn't recognize him! He was that good!

This is a story about two men on the fringes of  American society: an elderly man in a nursing home who is suffering from a deep depression and at the same time,  being over medicated; and his mildly retarded grandson, who also happens to be very clever and tough! He cuts through all the B.S. and gets the job done! He is truly a man!

""Two Of A Kind"" will  remind anyone who has forgotten, in a concrete way, what the power of love and a strong will can accomplish! Lets hope Hollywood starts making more films like this one!  And isn't it about time ""Two of A Kind"" is released on DVD? I think it's very important more people see this subversive film!",1210636800,2,1082,4.269607843137255
7854538,5,6303890350,This movie is something that brings me back to my childhood. I remember watching it for the first time at my grandparents house when it was first released. I would watch it everytime I went over there and loved it. Then it got taped over and it was 18 years later that I decided I needed to find it. I bought it through Amazon and watched it and loved it again. It's such a cute and touching movie. I would recommend this to everyone.,1127779200,3,434,4.178571428571429

7854540,5,6303890350,"This movie is fantastic. George Burns plays the part of lonely old man waiting to die, until his grandson, a 21 y/o who is mentally handicapped, teaches him that he has something to live for. Nollie (the boy) is torn apart by his parents: his father thinks he should grow up and be a man, and his mother wants him to stay a boy forever. When Nollie's mother decides to leave her husband and move away, Nollie steals her car and takes out his grandfather. It's wonderful, trust me.",1028505600,7,480,4.404494382022472
