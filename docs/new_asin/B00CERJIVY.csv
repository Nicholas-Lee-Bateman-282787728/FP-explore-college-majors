5720567,2,B00CERJIVY,"I had such high hopes for this film, but it died before it ever lived. Content to showcase the protagonists emotional trauma over the breeding ground of the mad scientist genre, Eron fails to create anything besides a bit of German eye candy.

In the end, Errors of the Human Body is nothing more a tale of loss with an obligatory dose of irony thrown in to compound the ending. This film doesnt really have a climax, instead, it carries itself much like Eklund, in a kind of sedated sate that walks somewhere between numbness and plot purgatory. D+

5720568,2,B00CERJIVY,"It struck me as a well filmed and lit (cinematography and lighting were good) student film (again with great production values).  The actors were fine, but both the plot line and character development were 2 star.  The ending felt very 'screen tested' as in the makers tried various endings and tagged this one on based on audience (or perhaps personal) approval even though it was a choppy ending.  If they were going to use this ending, they really could have re-edited the film body to so the end could click-into-place for audience impact.",1369785600,2,543,4.817204301075269
5720569,3,B00CERJIVY,"Geoff (Michael Eklund) is an American genetic doctor involved in prenatal testing. He is invited to work in Germany, which he accepts. Here we meet Rebekkah (Karoline Herfurth) who worked as an intern for him, a relationship we immediately can tell was not just professional. We also meet Jarek (Tmas Lemarquis) another scientist who Geoff doesn't like for no particular reason.

The story starts out very simply and then cleverly builds layers while slowly revealing the past and its relevance to current times. I liked the plot construction and its integrate weaving of the past into an ironic ending. The main problem of this tale is that the characters are boring. They lack pizazz. The whole story is humorless, unless you consider the background score as the sound cells make when they divide. The dryness of the story overwhelms the clever plot weave.

5720570,2,B00CERJIVY,"I threw my money away renting this movie.  I thought it would be a taunt medical thriller, instead I viewed a slow moving boring movie.  There was no ""unleashed"" virus, only a researcher who was depressed and a tad unstable.  The actor acted so restrained in this film a person would think this it was a zombie flick...but it was not.  Seriously, it was a waste of money and time. The supporting cast acted fine and the movie had the potential to be a pretty good one, but it just wasn't. Judging from the comments it seems there are people enjoyed it, but I was not one of them.",1368662400,3,579,4.284403669724771
5720571,4,B00CERJIVY,"Well done film, good cinematography and excellent soundtrack. If you like Cronenberg this is a film you will appreciate. Not as creepy as Antiviral or Dead Ringers (or Splice) but still very effective.",1368576000,,201,5.121212121212121
5720572,1,B00CERJIVY,"The trailer was the best part. This is one of those movies that looks like action packed and then you end up sitting there watching them go through mundane tasks the entire movie. Wow, drinking water. Wow riding in a car. Wow having a personal thought. This movie should be called ""errors with bad scripts"".",1366761600,6,307,4.6
5720573,3,B00CERJIVY,"For relatively unknown movies, ""tag"" line descriptions provide vital information for prospective viewers to make a purchase decision. If they deliver what they promise, fair enough. But when they fail to capture the product, whether intentionally or through ineptitude, there's bound to be disappointment. In the world of Amazon movie reviews, such bait tactics can be deadly. However, I will rise above what I believe happened here, because the movie does have merit.

There is no virus released upon humanity. This film is neither a zombie event, nor does it depict a pandemic scenario. Does it have Sci-fi aspects? Okay, I'll give them that one, but only by the barest margin. Rather, the movie is more of a mediocre ""thriller"" mixed with the drama of human loss, wrapped around the dark side of genetic research. The cinematography and acting are decent. Michael Eklund aptly portrays a ""lost"" soul after suffering the death of his child (rare disease)and quid pro quo disintegration of his marriage. The first half paces nicely, with intrigue, character development, a taste of reawakened romance and plot thickening... in fact, I really enjoyed the nefarious lab researcher played by Tomas Lemarquis. His motives and take on corporate research/politics felt real without being over the top.

After an hour-plus into the production, things begin to drag. But not awfully... they just didn't transport the viewer to the next level. It's as if the writers were torn on which direction to proceed. Even to the last fifteen minutes of the movie, they still could have gone full throttle zombie, or horror-fest epidemic, or octopus-like corporate corruption culture - but alas, none of the above. Instead, the film focuses upon Eklund's internal struggle/remorse and finishes abruptly with a wake-up scene that leaves the viewer asking ""what next?"" Upon reflection, it feels a bit like a medical research morality tale. So, temper your expectations, and I would rent this one for the off night, but there are redeeming aspects despite the weak ending.",1366675200,8,2051,5.174698795180723
5720574,5,B00CERJIVY,"Michael Eklund is AMAZING!! Just finished watching with my spouse, and As soon as this is available on DVD I will be purchasing it! I had high hopes since this had Michael Eklund (who was Amazing in THE DIVIDE, and was recently in the Hollywood big-budget film ""The Call""), ...and this movie did not disappoint! An amazing total Thriller mixed with heart-breaking drama and great cinematography (must have had a good Director of Photography).

8581036,3,B00CERJIVY,"3.5 stars: an extra half-star for the interview with writer / director Eron Sheean (more on that below).

This is not quite a thriller (no hanging on the edge of your seat), and don't get the idea it's horror either: ""Error"" is, as another viewer aptly stated, an art house piece. Much was done within the confines of a <$2M budget, and that's with one of Germany's top listed actresses (Karoline Herfurth, picture below) and the not-unknown Canadian actor Michael Eklund who has made a name for himself as [an often villainous] character actor who can also star as the protagonist (he is the central character in Error, not sure you'd exactly call him a protagonist here).
Ill disagree with the reviewer(s) who believe because some unauthorized experimentation happens during the film, this is another example of science is bad; on the contrary, its more of a look how far weve come in science and how much more there is to yet reveal. The director was fortunate in being able to shoot at an operational (as opposed to defunct) research station in Dresden, which provided the absolutely appropriate location and sets for such a story.

The inclusion of Icelandic actor Tmas Lemarquis (who has a distinctive look due to alopecia areata universalis, picture also below) injects an ominous unknown into the tale via his character's radical ideas, yet this is no Frankenstein. Some scenes are tense due to the dark overtones, but this is no horror flick. Its more like science fiction that gets some of the science right but takes plenty of liberties in order to keep the audience awake; that said, Errors clearly contains too little action to engage a larger audience. Additionally, a recurring problem with this brand of screenplay is that authors tend to have ideas that make for a good buildup, but they tend to sputter at the end or become downright puzzling and/or silly. Not to say a movie is required to beat you over the head with an ending you'll find logically and emotionally satisfying (as Hollywood forces upon audiences 90% of the time), but in this case I wanted a different ending than we received.

If you take the plunge and purchase the DVD (it only cost me $5.82, so its more a concern of wasting time than money), be sure to watch the interview: it is unlike any youve seen before. A deformed lab experiment / blob with chompers poses questions to Eron Sheean, and when he answers we see only a stop-motion mouse in an oddly decorated doll house replying to the questions... we never see the face of Eron (a director without an ego problem, which is always a bonus). Im tempted to say watch the interview before the film(since it contains no clips from the movie) because Eron explains his intentions for the audience's perceptions surrounding the mindset, actions, and fate of Michael Eklund's character, and (for example) why a peripheral Japanese character played by Yusuke Yamazaki is an over the top nerdy and eccentric scientist.",1469145600,,2954,4.811023622047244

8581039,3,B00CERJIVY,"EotHB for short is a well made indie flick about a troubled professor turned researcher after the discovery of a genetic mutation in his newborn son. Eklund the professor/researcher and father of the stricken newborn has an affair with one of his star students (Herfurth) who later requests him to help her in Germany on her research a few years after the affair. His failed marriage, death of their son and his failing research are the setup for this story

 Her research is on extremity/organ/tissue regeneration and ? Eklund finds out that his star student isn't the only one working on her research. Eklund has concerns about the research by his former student (Herfurth) and a recent flame/colleague of hers and investigates. This is one of the major flaws in the story because we aren't given any hints as to why he is so suspicious about their research.

The obvious choice of having the story play out in Germany and the odd character traits that are displayed by the former lover/colleague of his former student/lover help to add to the possibility of something more sinister may be at hand with the research.

 This is an overview on the story without giving to much away and omitting certain key elements for the same reason. The story is moody with dark undertones and is deliberately slow paced (some will not like the pacing). The twist at the end helps, but is not enough to raise the story above its shortcomings

 For me the delivery of the story is just off and really hurts this otherwise good movie a lot. The telling of this story is much like the deceiving box cover art that turns people away from watching this movie. The acting is very good and convincing from the key characters as is the direction with the exception of fusing this story into a smooth flowing and coherent (you get it, but the missteps hurt the flow and pacing) storyline. Between the directors missteps and the writing this movie looses some of its appeal. 2.7 stars

Rating 0 to 5 stars

Story = 3 The story suffers from lack of flow and cohesiveness.
Direction = 3 The director does a good job at getting good performances, but can't bring this story together effectively.
Acting = 4 The cast do a great job telling this moody story.
Mood = 4+ This movie oozes moodiness.
Gore = 4  There is disturbing scenes with the deformed newborn that may be hard to watch. There is also some scenes with mice being experimented on that may be hard to watch.
Sex/Nudity = There are nude love scenes and nude scenes with the pregnant wife.
Cursing = 2 There is some foul language and maybe an f word or two, but overall not very much.
Violence = 2 There are a few mild fight scenes, but nothing graphic.
Entertainment value = 2.7 The movie has a great moodiness to it and good acting with an interesting story, but the delivery is off and the movie suffers from it.",1390435200,,2849,4.557729941291585
8581040,4,B00CERJIVY,"""Haunted by a personal loss, a brilliant geneticist working on a top-secret project unwittingly unleashes a virus in this sci-fi thriller"" says the tag line.

It seems from that sentence several reviewers were expecting a zombie movie, some were expecting a medical thriller others, well who knows.  But nothing in the tag line suggests zombie movie or medical thriller.  Some complained they didn't see an unleashed virus creating a global plague.  That's not what this film is about.  It's a pensive, moody, well acted, well written journey into regret.  And yes, if you paid attention you'd realize the virus was unleashed.  The fact that you don't see the outcome, in society as a whole, of that unleashing doesn't mean the infected mouse who scurries away is not the vector.  It is established earlier in the film that they are creating a virus that is blood born and carried by mosquitos, ticks and fleas.  Thus the mouse would infect the fleas that would obviously soon find him and they would in turn infect the human population.  The Easter gene, probably called that because of resurrection being associated with Easter, does not ultimately kill as our protagonist becomes painfully aware.  If you aren't paying attention the nuance of the film may escape you but for those who did pay attention that extra dimension is found there in the tears coming down Rebecca's face when she asks our protagonist, now a patient at the same research institute, why his son didn't recover.  The only answer can be, and one that informs the internal angst of regrets from the first scenes on is that our protagonist must have put his own child out of its suffering.  This film deserves 4 stars for not relying on clichs, tricks and deus ex machina to tell the story.  It is nice and tightly written unlike other sci fi films by better known film makers.

If you need clich's, tricks and special effects to enjoy a film, this isn't for you.  This actually engages several brain cells at the same time and makes them sit up and take notice.  It's nice to find a well written script that doesn't rely on special effects to tell the story as is so often the case with lazy film makers these days.

Bravo.",1390176000,,2196,4.704188481675392
8581041,5,B00CERJIVY,"I've been watching this guy for some time now. He has always been a favorite character actor of mine. I was so excited when I saw that he was headlining this movie...I jumped right on it.
Not only does he do a terrific job, but the movie itself is one of those rare treats that tickle the brain a bit. It's been too long since I've seen a medical horror film that treated you like an adult.
This one does just that.

8581042,2,B00CERJIVY,"Some of the sciences, both theory and lab settings, were better than you typically find in movies.
