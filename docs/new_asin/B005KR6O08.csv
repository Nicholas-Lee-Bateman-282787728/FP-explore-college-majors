8477137,2,B005KR6O08,"""The Night Holds Terror"" is a 1955 black and white low budget hostage drama starring Jack Kelly, Hildy Parks, John Cassavetes, and Vince Edwards. It's based on a true event in February 1953.

Jack Kelly (1927-92) is best known as brother Bart from the popular ""Maverick"" TV series (1957-62). He later transitioned to politics and became mayor of Huntington Beach California, one of the first to make the change from film to politics. Kelly plays a businessman who picks up a hitchhiker who turns out to be a criminal.

Hildy Parks (1926-2004) plays Kelly's wife. She was primarily a TV actress in the 50s and this was her film debut. She later became involved in the Tony award shows where she had a distinguished career and won 2 Emmys as a writer.

John Cassavetes (1929-89) plays the head of the criminals. He was a pioneer of the cinema verite genre, as an actor and a director. He's probably best known for his Oscar nominated role in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967) or as the husband in ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), but these were the roles he took to make the money he needed to produce the films he wanted to make, such as ""Faces"" (1968), ""Husbands"" (1970), ""A Woman Under the Influence"", and ""Gloria"" (1980).

Vince Edwards (1928-96) is best known as ""Ben Casey"" (1961-6). This was one of his first major roles.

Andrew Stone (1902-99) was a writer/producer/director who specialized in low budget films. He was nominated for an Oscar as writer of ""Julie"" (1956). His wife Virginia (1921-97) often worked with him, and for this film served as editor and composer.

The NY Times called it ""far from memorable"" but praised it as a ""tight, economical and steadily suspenseful little picture."" They signed out Parks for her ""outstanding"" acting.

In 1955 ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Mister  Roberts"", ""Guys and Dolls"", ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Picnic"" were the top 5. The Oscars went to ""Marty"" (Picture, Director, Actor), ""Mister Roberts"" (Supporting Actor), ""East of Eden"" (Supporting Actress), and ""The Rose Tatoo"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""The 7 Year Itch"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Oklahoma"", ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""The Virgin Queen"".

This is a pretty ordinary film with nothing special to recommend it, apart from a detailed look at how police and phone company people worked together in the mid 50s in terms of tracing phone calls. Better versions of hostage films include Bruce Willis' ""Hostage"" (2005), ""Panic Room"" (2002), ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967), and several Bogart films including ""The Desperate Hours"" (1955), ""Key Largo"" (1948), and ""The Petrified Forest"" (1936).",1338681600,,2622,4.968036529680365

There were other movies in that era where a gang of criminals invaded a home to threaten the family living there. These movies were both horror stories and crime stories in that what was a safe refuge in now a place of terror. A man made the mistake to give a ride to hitch-hikers who were strangers. They hijack his car, drive to his house to invade and rob him. His wife and two children are prisoners in their home. They live in a new post-war development built on former farmland. This takes place near Los Angeles. The drama comes from the threat from the criminals who plan a worse crime than robbery. But one of the criminals does not want to participate in a major crime, he only met them the other day. The first two take the man away as a hostage. Could this be turned into a kidnapping for ransom for a bigger payoff? The criminals have a short-wave radio in their car to listen to police calls and be forewarned. [Now you know the reason for those cryptic codes to keep information from casual listeners.] The story reads like a guide to a crime, but also shows why crime doesn't pay for most kidnappers.

Kidnapping has a flaw: the criminals must show up at a known place to collect the ransom money, and this leads to the criminals. Worn money may not be obvious, but it is simple to collect the serial numbers. [Cameras with film can do this quickly and accurately.] The police have sophisticated techniques to keep sensitive information from the radio (a teletype network). The love of easy money usually has a hidden price tag. You see obsolete electro-mechanical switching relays used to make dialed telephone calls. They were replaced by digital computers many decades ago. They have faster ways to trace a call (the originating telephone number is embedded within the telephone call). The stories of home invasion grew out of the new suburban living. I don't remember any such stories from earlier times (as shown in the movies from the 1930s and 1940s). The fact is that the home is less safe than a school, office, store, or factory. Most deaths occur in the home from domestic violence or suicide. Children are mostly harmed at home rather than at school, but this is less publicized.
You will recognize some actors who will become more famous in future years. Note how most of these actors look like ordinary people rather than movie stars. Realism?",1320883200,6,2408,4.623831775700935
