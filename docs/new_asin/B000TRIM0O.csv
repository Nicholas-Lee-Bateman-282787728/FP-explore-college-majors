8322819,1,B000TRIM0O,"Extremely disappointed.  If you're not willing or able to present the Art Deco features of the buildings in detail why bother?  Oh! silly me, to make a buck.  Low ball the production and then try to disguise the crap shooting (pssst! hey guys, tripod = good) with cheesy sepia tone scratched film filters in iMovie.  As to the portrayal of Art Deco, for some reason the focus here seems to be only on towers.  Bullock's of course, but how can one do a video on the Art Deco of Los Angeles and leave out the Griffith Observatory?  Hmmm, probably no parking lot three blocks away to sneak bandit shots from because you're too lazy or cheap to do it properly.  Interesting how everyone outside of LA still views it as the media production capital, but the reality is for every talented, skilled professional in LA, there are a hundred wannabe posers.  Guess which group the producers of this video are from.",1189814400,4,904,4.571428571428571
