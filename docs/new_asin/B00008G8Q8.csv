1845799,5,B00008G8Q8,"This is the best kaiju movie I've ever seen. The Gamera and Gyaos legend is given more details here. The creatures known as Gyaos have started appearing in areas outside of Japan. A research team has found a graveyard of Gamera skeletons on the ocean floor, just south of Japan. ...all before the opening credits.
Ayana's parents were killed during the events of the first movie. (She didn't appear in that movie. There's simply a flashback to the events.) She blames Gamera for their deaths, and her hatred causes Iris to be created.
Personally, I happen to like the more metaphysical elements in the story. They also explain why Japan attracts monsters. There is real emotion here. This isn't a shallow plot at all. Even the monsters seem to show emotions. This movie goes far beyond the simplistic kaiju movies of the 1960s and 1970s where there was a pro-wrestling quality to the fights. The Gamera movies have never been tame - even when the special effects were poor. In this newer trilogy, Gamera ends up with serious injuries. In the Godzilla series, Godzilla either bleeds or ends up completely destroyed. In Gamera 2, after defending the helicopter, you can see a chunk of Gamera's shell missing near his shoulder. In Gamera 3, he gets even more serious injuries.
Although there is still the traditional man-in-suit, this movie has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. (This doesn't include the opening titles which use clips from G1.) Gyaos is mainly done with CGI. The images of Iris and Gamera flying are most likely CGI too. The best special effect moments are Chapter 7 (for the fight between Gamera and Gyaos in the Shibuya District) and within Chapter 18 - (air battle between Gamera and Iris) starting at 1:11:36 (hour:minutes:seconds), briefly interrupted by a scene at Kyoto Station, and continues at 1:14:42. That second half has the best example of how much special effects have improved in kaiju films - involving the patriot missles.
Some reviewers feel the effects are better than TriStar's Godzilla. In some ways, I agree. Even the director indirectly admits he was trying to match that movie. I also feel G3 is far superior to Godzilla 2000. Gamera 3 was released March 6, 1999 in Japan. Godzilla 2000 was released on December 11, 1999 in Japan. I have not seen the 3 newer Godzilla movies yet so I can't compare G3 with them. (There are three more Godzilla movies after Godzilla 2000.) I think Shusuke Kaneko directed the one relased in 2001 which had Godzilla, King Ghidorah, Mothra, and Baragon.
Most of the extras are nice. I prefer the real material - the behind the scenes material, interviews, and trailers. I am truly sick of that song that ADV chose to repeat throughout some of the material here and on the G2 DVD. They could have varied the music some. I would have prefered muted music with some subtitled dialogue. We have more of the fake outtakes which I wish they would have called something like Fun In The Studio or anything else. Something similar was done on the DVD for Legend of the Last Labyrinth, but they labeled it as ""Fun In The Studio With Coastal Recording."" I'd rather see real outtakes - like the guy in the Gamera costume slipping on the set perhaps or an actor messing up lines. I'd rather have something real plus the made-up material, not just the made up stuff. I don't want a fake commentary either. I don't want to hear about some fictional person named ""Ralph"" who has appeared off screen in every Gamera movie or the limited casting opportunities for tentacled actors like Iris. If Kaneko or Higuchi have trouble with English, give us some fans or experts on the commentary tracks. The commentaries don't have to be serious like most seem to be, but they should be informative on some level. The Evangelion movies and Red Dwarf had some fun commentaries mixed with real background information.
This is the one movie in the trilogy where I know what was on the Japanese LaserDisc. There are more extras that could have been added like the Juliana music video. She sang the song during the ending credits. I don't know if music videos existed for the songs in the other two movies. I would have liked to have seen more of the public interviews rather just a few minutes.
Among the ADV Previews, there is the Gamera 1 preview with the quotes from reviewers including Roger Ebert's ""Thumbs up!"" (The reviews were for G1's limited US theatrical release.)
I do have a few technical issues with the movie like the graphics from the Dreamcast looking more like a Genesis or PC game and the fact a CD-R is used for the game. I know I'm being picky, but I notice this stuff. I still love the movie.
My issues with the extras aside, G3 is a wonderful movie that I would highly recommend. There is a chance non-kaiju fans may enjoy it too.",1055289600,6,4806,4.675324675324675
1845800,5,B00008G8Q8,"The final film in the Heisei Gamera series, G3 is a jewel. True, the meta-spiritual sub-plot does go a bit ""deep"" ifyaknowhatImean, but overall this is VERY fine movie with good performances and many great SFX shots that Mssr's Devlin & Emmerich should have taken a note or two from. This comes Stratospherically recommended!",1050883200,3,325,5.037037037037037
1845801,3,B00008G8Q8,"While this is clearly the most visually stunning of the three Gamera films--the sequence where Gamera fights Gyaos in downtown Tokyo will set the benchmark of Kaiju battles--the story relies so much on the metaphysical that it's hard to understand.  Add two characters who do nothing but extrapolate this confusing plot just before they die senselessly, and you find yourself scratching your head and wondering how this could come from the same writer/director as the first two Gamera films.  Still the monsters are great, and turning Gamera into an anti-hero--as hinted at with the closing line of Gamera 2--was inspired.  The special effects will knock you out of your seat, and for that alone the movie is worth the purchase price.",1050278400,2,734,5.049586776859504
1845802,5,B00008G8Q8,"Gamera III, directed by Shusuke Kaneko and visual effects by Shinji Higuchi. Gamera III set the high watermark for visual effects in Japanese cinema. With a budget of only 7,000,000 Dollars, they managed to create fantastic action sequences that are orchestrated flawlessly. Some of the SFX are better than the American Version of Godzilla (1998). The movie has this epic tone that makes it seem more than just a monster movie flick. I have seen this movie countless times and I never seem to get tired of it. I recommend this to anyone, not just fans of Gamera or Godzilla. You will not be disappointed. If you are disappointed, I recommend seeking some mental help.",1048809600,11,667,4.808695652173913
1845883,4,B00008G8Q8,"The first time that I saw this movie was at its North American premiere as part of a G-Fest event. My nephew and his parents (who are not big monster enthusiasts) attended the showing and despite it being a Japanese language movie with subtitles my brother and his wife were both quite impressed and came away from the movie surprised that it wasn't a throwaway man-in-suit big battle explosion movie without any story or narrative. As for me, I love me some Gamera and the film didn't disappoint though I do tire of the magical fantasy aspects where the protagonist can overcome anything with the screenplay simply invoking some element of ""magic"" or ""mana"" to cover the gap. But I digress.

Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris is the third and final movie in Shusuke Kaneko 1990's Gamera movies. Gamera is again humanities savior, fighting off a growing flock of Hyper Gyaos which are slightly modified/ evolved Gyaos that were introduced in the first film of this trilogy. This fight that he's involved in causes Gamera to fight without regard to humanity's safety as he usually does and so he ends up reigning down as much terror and destruction as do the Gyaos. In an opening and quite honestly thrilling sequence Gamera shoots some Gyaos out of the sky, with large flaming chunks of Gyaos flesh crashing into city buildings below and scattering the nighttime revelries of the Japanese inhabitants, and then Gamera lands in a blasting, earth pounding crash that shatters windows and sets off alarms for several city blocks around. This is some thrilling stuff, with Kaneko and SPFX director Shinji Higuchi continuing to devote time and attention to drafting new angles and ways to see these titanic beings from different vantage points, including ant's eye (humans) perspectives and they do a great job. The visual effects are a strong point in this feature's favor; Gamera himself has been given another makeover and he looks meaner and fiercer, more streamlined than ever before. The storyline actually bookends the Gamera versus Gyaos contest and inserts another story, another monster, into the mix: the oddly beautiful, ethereal Iris. Iris is another mystical monster of the earth, a demon of death of some ancient clan, and is awakened by a young lass who is at odds with the world due to early childhood trauma (she lost her parents in a fight he had with Gyaos, and she blames Gamera). Just as Gamera had been anchored to humanity by a mystical/ emotional connection with a young girl so too Iris is anchored through this troubled young child and Iris draws on her hate for Gamera as it grows by consuming people and animal's life essences into a creature who threatens to take down the titanic tusked terrapin. The connection that Iris has with its host human is like that of a succubus; it is seductive, strange, and deadly and is sure to generate some strong reactions from viewers. The acting overall is decent for a movie like this though there may not be a whole lot for a western audience to attach to. Director Kaneko gives nods to his former films that only fans are going to pick up on or care about but that shouldn't distract from a casual moviegoer's experience.",1410048000,,3178,4.788706739526412

1845888,5,B00008G8Q8,"The cover is dull. The cover on Gamera 2 is AWESOME.

Gamera looks EPIC and AWESOME it makes Godzilla vs Megalon a run for its money.

I like the concept that Iris feeds on the girl's hatred and vengeance of Gamera to grow in epic proportions, and i like that concept.

The final battle was jaw-dropping

The ending when Gamera walks off to battle the swarm of Gyaos is quite a cliffhanger.

There's a fan-film called Gamera 4: Truth that should have a US release on dvd

Watch this movie, IT IS EPIC :)",1343779200,,503,4.297872340425532
1845889,5,B00008G8Q8,"Simply put, this is the best Gamera movie of them all! The storyline is tight, innovative, and takes the ""Gamera vs. Gaos"" legend to an entirely new level. In addition, as has been mentioned in some of the other reviews here, this movie treats the idea of these creatures battling it out seriously, which really adds a refreshing quality to this movie. I mean, think about it, if Dorothy in the Land of Oz can play it straight with a scarecrow, tin man, and lion, why can't a kaiju movie take its subjects seriously and present them as such?

Watch this movie, enjoy, and consider this - if ""kaiju"" directors would follow this model, people today would be demanding that the studios produce even more flicks starring Gamera, Godzilla, and all the other legendary monster characters.

Gamera rocks!",1295308800,,797,4.768115942028985

1845891,5,B00008G8Q8,"The Gamera trilogy comes to a close in this beautiful movie. Incredible special effects are seen throughout the movie. This movie is considered ""kaiju"" movies at its best. From the beautiful scene of Iris rising out of the clouds to fly in the night's sky to the quiet burning of the buildings in Tokyo, the movie does a good job at setting the moods. A dream come true. Kaneko's masterpiece that even rivals to be better than the Godzilla movies. From the beginning to the end, a real treat to watch and hear. Stay and listen to the beautiful song at the end credits written by the director Kaneko himself specifically for this movie! Amazing, simply amazing. Word of caution, watch the first two movies of the series first because it is a continual story and it could be hard to fully understand the plot if you haven't seen the other two. This is not a childish movie, this movie is more mature. Gamera is a friend to children no more!",1133913600,,938,4.491228070175438
1845913,3,B00008G8Q8,After seeing the first two I was disappointed with the third installment of Gamera. Yes the special effects are BETTER but the story is really weird and Gamera is hardly in it! He shows up at the end for some brutal fighting. What got me the most was the enemy monster which was built up as really creepy and gross- which is great in an alien-esq sci-fi horror movie but here it just drags on and on. What got me into these movies in the first place was that they rewrote Gamera's back story as a lost bio-weapon from Atlantis which I thought was a fantastic idea but this movie waunders way away from that into the supernatural- however they left plenty of room to pull it all back into place with a fourth movie but it look like this is the last one. Plus bringing back the flying lizards birds from the first movie was a drag as they really weren't all that great the first time around. I bought the 3 in one box set which is a great deal and should be grabbed at all cost and I have enjoyed it thoroughly but the third although better special effects wise is the weaker story wise. WE NEED A FOURTH MOVIE TO MAKE IT ALL GOOD!! GET BACK TO ATLANTIS!,1112745600,2,1152,4.193693693693693
1845914,5,B00008G8Q8,"This was f***in awesome! I was always a huge fan of monster movies ... and this one is the bets one i've seen that stays true to the authenticity of the Japanese films (because America sucks balls!) So, man, if Godzilla movies would become this good (like the late 90's Godzilal films) i would need a towel every time i watched them! The aerial fight between Gamera and Iris, America can't do that! Only someone who knew how to make a good monster movie could take Gamera, beef him up, and make this film whip that much a**! (Sorry, i guess i have to censor) But, just get this if you are a fan of Godzilla, or Gamera ... eitehr one, this film impressed me, i Love it! ...

1845915,5,B00008G8Q8,"Shusuke Kaneko's Gamera III has all the best ingredients that make a great kaiju movie. This movie shows how it's supposed to be done. Having seen more than 25 Toho films (Godzilla series, Mothra series, etc), all the King Kong films, a few giant monster spin-offs made from all over the globe, not to mention the horrid 1998 American Godzilla and many other disaster movies, this one takes the cake. Gamera III outdoes them all with a solid, earthly story complete with humanity and heart. Also, the use of special effects is absolutely fabulous; they do not take over the film like the excessive CGI used in Hollywood. I must say that Gamera III has some of most exhilarating monster fights ever put to the screen.

Gamera III is a direct sequel to the first film in the trilogy, Guardian of the Universe. A girl lost her parents during Gamera's final battle with the last Gyaos, and garners a hatred for Gamera. She enounters a tentacle creature whom she names Iris, and it is eventually nurtured to become the monster who faces off with Gamera. What was striking about this movie was how surreal and poetic it was. The story flows brilliantly and sensibly, as the roles of human and monster come together so good. Gamera III is a movie all about personality, something that many monster movies lack. The human characters are wonderfully integrated in the story without their roles becoming too cheesy. Also, Gamera and Iris are enigmatic monsters with true character. They are not mindless, menacing beasts whose purpose is to execute showtime destruction.

Speaking of destruction, Gamera III's fight sequences are some of the best you'll ever see. The special effects are such a huge improvement over the first two Gamera films in the trilogy. They also shame anything attempted by any Godzilla movie of recent times, even Shusuke's own GMK. Adding to the special effects is the showing of the human side of the fights. The battle in Shibuya is one to mention. I was in awe of such a brilliantly staged battle, and also how the film showed the human suffering coinciding with the destruction. Most monster movies sacrifice too much of one side for the other. Gamera III does not.

And finally, one thing that carries this film (and the rest of the series) was the character of Gamera himself. How can the population care so much for such a destructive monster? Does he do good or bad to the people? What constitutes which? After watching Shusuke's Gamera trilogy, you realize how much more personality Gamera has than Godzilla.

Gamera III is such a special movie for its genre. Along with the first two films in the trilogy, it shows that the kaiju genre is here to stay. It ranks up with the best of Godzilla such as Godzilla vs. Destoroyah and GMK: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, perhaps even surpassing them. This is a true kaiju treasure.",1104710400,23,2849,4.761133603238866
1845916,4,B00008G8Q8,"By the time I finnaly saw Gamera 3 I'd already read innumerable reviews, hailing it as a grand cinematic achievment. And when people said that the special effects were better than those in the Lord of the Rings, I knew I needed to see it. Now, maybe because I'm a big fan of Godzilla, in fact a ""loyal"" fan of Godzilla, and that I'd heard all of this praise for it, when I got done watching Gamera 3 for the first time, I felt pretty mislead. Now, don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. Kaneko's directing skills, especialy with pacing and imagery, are great. The special effects were superior to those in any of the recent Godzilla films as well. I mean, it was a pretty good movie. And there's my point. It was a PRETTY GOOD movie. By no means is this a groundbreaking film. Sure, the characters are more believable than the endless number of scientest heroes in the Godzilla films, but their story just wasn't all that engaging. Especialy the two villains, whose dialouge is sometimes embarrasingly moronic, most notably so when they try and explain the entire ""earth spirits"" plot. And the idea of the monster Iris being telepathicly connected to Ayanna, that's right out of the later Godzilla films. And the special effects,while, like I said, supperior to those in the Godzilla films, aren't even close to those in Lord of the Rings. But I think the thing about this movie that annoys me so much is the fact that it takes itself SO serriously. How am I supposed to really be moved by the stories of the characters amidst all this absurdity. Between the fact that the protaganist is a massive tusk-sporting turtle  that flies like a UFO and the earth being drained of ""gaia"", where can I find a reason to take it seriously. Someone might call me a hipocrite for liking the Godzilla movies so much, but those, with the notable exception of Gojira, haven't been  so celebrated for being magnifacent pieces of art, when really, for the most part, they're just as credible as Gamera. It just really annoyed me that this film has gotten so much praise. However, that doesn't mean I'm recommending you don't watch it. It's worth the money for what it is, an entertaining, very well executed monster movie.",1092614400,6,2204,4.6055979643765905
1845917,5,B00008G8Q8,"This, without a doubt, is a masterpeice of, not just the giant monster genre, but films in general. Gamera started back in the 60s with more horrible FX and worse storylines than the infamous later movies of the Showa Godzilla series. However, in 1995, Gamera was resurrected as his main competition died out (seemingly) in ""Godzilla vs. Destoroyah."" The Heisei Gamera trilogy was a fine example of how good japanese monster movies could be if time and initiative are put into them. This film is the best of the trilogy, and shows just how great it is to be able to enjoy kaiju. The SFX are nearly flawless, and even the monster suits portray believable movements, showing that suitmation isn't as terrible as it is so claimed to be. The story of this film makes sense, and one can actually care for the actors. It's a shame that the Shinsei Godzilla series (99-03) didn't take an example from this film. ""Godzilla 2000,"" the reintroduction of the Godzilla series while Gamera was ending, was a major disappointment compared to this film. If you are unsure about the giant monster genre, watch the Gamera trilogy (in order preferably, or else some parts of G3 won't make since) before looking at the Godzilla and Showa Gamera movies (but don't expect anything better unless you are watching the original uncut Japanese 1954 version of ""Godzilla"").",1084147200,7,1347,4.8354978354978355

A young girl loses her family during the first movie when, in the midst of battle, Gamera slams into their building and crushes them.  Filled with anger and a lust for revenge, the girl uncovers a new monster she hopes to unleash on the world's so called 'guardian'.  One of the most impressive things about Gamera 3 is how it shows the horrible fates of the poor humans caught in the middle of the monster battles.  The effects are stunning, the story solid and well mounted enough to deserve a theatrical release in America.  Since foreign genre movies are usually mocked and ridiculed, it is no surprise that Gamera 3 went direct to DVD.  Pity, for this would have looked impressive on the big screen.  Kaneko is truly the Honda of today, every kaiju movie he has made has been an intelligently handled genre film, and Gamera 3 is the best of them.  No fan of Japanese cinema should be without it.

Meanwhile, even though she lost the jewel, Asagi still worries about Gamera, because a powerful foe, more powerful than Legion, is unleashed. This is because of the Gyaos. That's right, Gyaos returns, because Gamera used the ultimate attack called the mana beam to wipe out the Legion. However, the blast sends more Gyaos three years later.

Since Godzilla is a household name and few people actually know who Gamera is i really tought that i was in for some lame special effects, lame fake cities and the rest of the bad effects from the G movies.
Was i in for a surprise when i popped this baby in my dvd.
Gamera is amazing, the first monster you see, the prehistoric bird is so well done. Then the rest of the effects where simply amazing, when Gamera attacks the city, it looks like a city. People actually look at both monster fighting from the city and it really look quit amazing.
Why doenst G movies look like this, and when gamera shoots fire, or lift off to the sky, wow.

But to let you all no up front, the Showa series of Gamera films were decent but were more aimed at kids so they were a little goofy for me. But the Heisei series and especially Gamera 3 are much more adult oriented with great plots, special effects, and acting!

The special effects during the fight scenes, and their view from a person's prospective, are excellent for a japanese monster movie and better than Godzilla 2000, however still not quite up to the American standards. My major complaint is regarding the acting and overall plot which it just does not seem to change much from movie to movie and they are mediocre at best. Also the dubbing to english is not that great either. The dvd picture quality is very good and the sound is good as well. Overall: FAIR.",1067299200,2,634,4.7727272727272725

Gamera III = Unbelievable VisualFX, compelling plot, dynamic (and occasionaly freaky) characters.  Gamera III - Advent of Legion is one of my favorite movies of all time, much less one of my fav creature-features/action flicks.  Destroy any preconcieved notions you may have about ""Campy, bad dubbed (with any Japanese film: ALWAYS WATCH IT IN ORIGONAL JAPANESE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES! >.<  ), rubber monster suit, Japanese monster movies"", and give this one a shot!  PS: If you like this movie, I highly reccomend a few other excellent critter-flicks:  The Relic, The Howling (the first one), Aliens (Directors Cut DVD), Godzilla Vs.

The story is decent and can carry you through the movie without too many cringes.

7983583,5,B00008G8Q8,"The climax of the three movie Heisei Gamera Trilogy Shuske Kaneko proved himself to be one of the worlds best directors with these three and is easily a succesor to Ichiro Honda and shows signs of Kurosawa like story telling. He crafted a wonderful in continuity series of three of the best Kaiju movies ever made. Fantastic Special Effects. Tight gripping story telling with drama, humor, good well rounded characters. A movie to movie consistency with recurring main characters and world.

While each film is a stand alone and may be in theory watched in any order, you will be best served by watching them in order to fully appreciate how some of the characters change and evolve across the full trilogy. The films are dark gritty and brutal with some of the best giant monster fights ever put on film. They don't look like people in suits stomping on models. They are so perfectly shot as to make you feel that the monsters are on the next block.

Revenge of Iris is the third and final movie in the series (sadly the fourth was never made). It deals largely with the aftermath of the battles in the prior movies. A young traumatized girl who lost her family during the earlier Gamera fights stumbles across another ""Guardian Monster"" that was similarly traumatized and damaged by Gamera. They bond and a reign of destruction and revenge begins. The effects in this movie are the best of the servies and quite frankly the best scene in any movie of this type until Pacific Rim and Godzilla 2014 hit the screens. If you enjoy Pacific Rim or Godzilla 2014 you will love these three Gamera movies",1440460800,,1597,4.639575971731449
7983584,4,B00008G8Q8,"After spectacularly reviving the ""Gamera"" franchise and following it up with one of the best kaiju sequels ever made, director Shusuke Kaneko and Daei Studios were on a roll and certainly had both the tools and the momentum to create a fitting end to their trilogy. However, they also had a heck of lot to live up to. ""Revenge of Iris"" is a very unique monster feature and definitely still within the territory of the best ""Gamera"" flicks ever made, but it's also a small step down from the well-rounded masterpiece that came directly before it. It's worthy of a buy, but it makes a few decisions that lessen its appeal to me.

The story: Japan turns against Gamera when his battle with the Gyaos devastates a city. At the same time, an angry young woman (Ai Maeda,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Royale/dp/B006L4MWVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle Royale</a>) raises a monster of her own to reap vengeance on Gamera.

My biggest complaint is that Gamera himself has relatively little screentime, with his scenes relegated to the first and last half-hours of the film. However, this disappointment is softened by the prolonged presence of his enemy, Iris. From a dramatic perspective, I'd argue that Iris is the single best kaiju villain ever created. For a character who doesn't speak, he is perfectly written, with his relationship with Maeda's character being particularly well-conceived. It makes for a unique take on the human-monster bond that other movies of this sort have broached and absolutely hits it home, with one of the most dramatic climaxes I've seen in films like this. The only downside? - about half of all shots featuring him are computer-generated, which more or less demolishes the aesthetic balance established in the previous movie.

Then again, I can't be too critical of the CGI. Its quality is excellent for something produced outside of America in the late 90s, and it occasionally makes for some impacting visuals; virtually all of the above-cloud battle counts. It also helps set a surprisingly sinister tone. Great lengths appear to have been taken to make ""Revenge of Iris"" the darkest and bloodiest of the trilogy. Gamera, for one thing, has been given a revamped design and looks particularly fearsome. His initial CG-enhanced battle and its effect on the city is nothing short of apocalyptic - completely justifying the nation's turn against the monster and making for a scene we had never before seen in his features.

Even outside of the monster battles, the production scenes are surprisingly high. And while the film suffers from a cast way too large for its own good, the dramatic performances are roundly good. I am delighted to see Ayako Fujitani's role return to prominence, though the aforementioned Ai Maeda is the one who really steals the show.

Daiei Studios would not produce any films after this one, which is a major disappointment for a company as storied as it, but the fact that its last effort was such a good one counts for something. Gamera ends this particular stage of his existence victoriously, because ""Revenge of Iris"" - as well as its two predecessors - is a triumph. Again, it's not without its faults, but it leaves an impression that I believe all kaiju films you watch subsequently will be judged by.",1433462400,,3323,5.0787545787545785

7983586,4,B00008G8Q8,"I usually like the old Godzilla, Gamera etc movies the best, but Gamera 2 and the one before this one was really very good.  It has our old friends Osagie, Nagameana (I don't know how her name is spelled) from the first and second Gamera movies. In the first movie Osagie the girl who is connected to Gamera through a bead and helps him fight the bad bird. Doctor Nagameana is the main character in this movie as well as well as our lovable policeman, who has turn bum, but thanks to Doctor N, she finds his right to live and comes to her aid.  The special effects are getting better and better all the time. These three movies are some of the better ones, but I would recommend that you see the all three in order.  The only thing I didn't like about it is the creature and it's connection with the new girl.

7983589,4,B00008G8Q8,"As of this review, this is last Gamera movie that follows the giant destructive monster style of Gamera movies versus the save the children.  Frankly, I prefer the former over the latter.  As for the movie, I rate it #2 of the three 90s Gamera films.  The first film was the best and had the most gore.  This one had some gore, husk people, and monster blood.  If your looking for a story, you are not looking for monster films.  This characters and simple story did not take away from the monsters, like Godzilla (2014), and the monster battles were satisfying and for the best monster battles and overall craziness, see Godzilla: Final Wars.  I would add this movie to your collection if you're a monster buff or rent it, after seeing the first film, if you are curious about this series  The film that follows this one went back to the old model of Gamera saves the children; which, is not relevant in today's declining birthrate Japan.  It is also why it was the last movie they made.

Please make another Gamera movie in this style.",1423785600,,1037,4.497326203208556
