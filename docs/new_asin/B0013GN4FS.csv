Within 10 minutes I contacted the seller to say my church has also just bought all of the Nooma Series. The seller would not allow me to cancel.  All others did.",1278720000,,243,4.260869565217392
8250903,5,B0013GN4FS,"In this video Rob discusses the theology of prayer and in so doing recaps a situation he has mentioned several times in his writings, why does God answer some prayers and not others? Or why does God seem to ""show up"" sometimes as if to imply he was somewhere else? This video is very applicable in our lives because when are we not in prayer for something?

Whenever I ask for prayer, most students just stare back. I usually comment, ""does that mean your lives are perfect?"" They usually laugh and a few hands go up. We are all in prayer.

But don't fall into the trappings of thinking you don't pray ""enough."" I've been there to. I don't think there is a quantity to how much we should pray, let's not beat ourselves up if the Pastor doesn't call us one of his ""prayer warriors."" [I don't even like that phrase] I think you will find that when we are open and honest with God - with sincere hearts and sincere faith the quality of our prayers will be more dynamic.

God is doing something in the world and I want to be a part of it.

Be open to the discussion

Be in prayer",1253491200,2,1075,4.199029126213592

8250905,5,B0013GN4FS,"In the nineteenth installment of the Nooma DVD series, Rob Bell, the preaching pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church, introduces a discussion of prayer that begins in a place that many people, Christians and non-Christians alike, find themselves struggling: the almost seeming randomness of whether prayer is answered and whether God is truly present in the lives of those who reach out to Him.  What is remarkable in his homily is that within the span of twelve minutes, Bell takes the viewer from these questions to a consideration of the broader theology of what prayer is and what it might accomplish, even when our prayers may not seem to be heard.

I think my favorite moment of the entire presentation is when Rob suggests that very often we may be the answer to our own prayers if we are honest enough to look at what we have been gifted with.  As he puts it, ""Don't ask God to feed the hungry when you have enough food.""  Beyond this, Bell discusses the role prayer plays within the idea of having a relationship with a creative God who has imbued His creations with that same power to create.

I unreservedly recommend this short presentation as an introduction to a longer and more involved discussion on prayer.  Bell introduces the topics and the difficulties but he wisely offers no quick and easy answers but invites the viewer to consider the ideas and move into a deeper consideration of the topic.  As with the other Nooma DVDs, this is most likely best used as a discussion starter in a small group setting for those who are willing to search beyond the pat answers and explanations to a difficult topic of faith.  Well done Rob and all the others who work to bring this series to the rest of us.",1211328000,6,1710,4.583606557377049
8250906,4,B0013GN4FS,"Luggage is my favorite in this DVD series, but Open gets right into the top 3 with a great discussion about prayer and the paradoxes of it. Bell's words, along with solid imagery and music, really bring a great message home: We don't know why prayer works to our advantage at some time, but life is more about bowing to the will of God, than getting what we want.",1210809600,4,363,4.27536231884058
