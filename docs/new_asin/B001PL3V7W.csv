8333638,4,B001PL3V7W,Excellent choice if you're a Jodorowsky's fan.....the only thing that doesn't convince me was that it doesn't have any Spanish Subtitles....but it doesn't really matter at all because the important feature is the movie and nothing else!!! (Tell me about it...the movie was filmed in Mexico and it doesn't exist here...how about that??!!),1270166400,,337,5.377358490566038
