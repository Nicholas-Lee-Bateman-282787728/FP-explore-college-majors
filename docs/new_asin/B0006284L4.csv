2158810,2,B0006284L4,"This series is okay as an add on after a more intense workout.  My main complaint is the low intensity.  I thought that the walk jog would be a great one to work up a sweat but it really wasn't.  I also thought the backround music was very difficult to hear and I personally need to hear that music-it's motivating for me. Leslie's voice however comes through very loud which may be why the music seems so low. The backrounds themselves are kind of cheesey, but I can live with that.  I enjoy the express series much more than this one.  It is more of an intense workout, large groups of enthusiastic people and you can hear the music, so you can ""walk to that beat""  as Leslie likes to say.",1106265600,13,691,4.236641221374046
2158811,4,B0006284L4,"I like this new set. I have several of Leslie's tapes and these 3 help alleviate boredom. I especially like the 1 Mile Power Walk and the Walk and Jog. The 1 Mile Power Walk is fast paced and good when I don't have much time. The Walk and Jog uses interval training - some walking mixed with 2 minute spurts of jogging. This one reminds me of the 1989 (I think) tape of Leslie's that is almost entirely jogging. The third tape, Walk and Kick, doesn't interest me as much. In that one Leslie combines her regular core moves with boxing exercises. Overall I am glad I bought them.",1104364800,22,578,4.263636363636364
8036812,4,B0006284L4,"I have many of Leslie's dvds. They are perfect for my 40 year old thighs! I bought this set because I wanted a more intense workout in the morning...I only have 30 minutes to exercise before work. So far I have done ""walk jog"" and ""walk kick"" several mornings and I do work up a good sweat. BUT.....these really need to be updated! First problem...The set is so fake  and cheesy....like you are in some outdoor terrace. Whats wrong with the usual exercise room/gym??? Second problem...some of the moves are not carpet friendly or the transitions are awkward. Third problem...she has several miscues. There are points in the routine where even the assistants are confused. They are either doing moves different from her or they just stop all together. All of this give the feeling of a cheap, quickie production. I am able to ignore these as I love Leslie and I know I am still benefitting from the exercise. But not my favorite set.",1352937600,,932,4.648484848484848
8036813,1,B0006284L4,"I've never tried any Sansone workouts before so I picked these up to give it them a try.  The power mile was so low energy that I didn't even feel as though I was exercising.  The walk/jog made me break a sweat, albeit a small one, and didn't really get my heartrate into an aerobic range.  As stated before, the sets are cheesy and the music is low.  Most of all, at the end of the walk/jog workout Sansone says that you've walked 2.5 miles.  My pedometer measure just 1 mile - now my pedometer may be off some, but no way is it off by over 50%!  I don't know think I'll be trying anymore of the WATP exercises.",1258848000,,612,4.058333333333334
8036814,5,B0006284L4,An exercise for those in between intermediate and expert. There is a bit of exertion but with a little persaverance it can be conquered. It is just enough to make you feel like you got a good work out.,1219363200,,201,4.17948717948718
8036815,5,B0006284L4,"I have used Leslie's Walk Away the Pounds Express series for awhile now and have been doing the three and four mile walks because the shorter walks had become too easy.  I was looking for a quicker workout that still maintains the intensity of the longer walks and this power series provides it.  The Power Mile is a 20 minute work out that I can do in the mornings to really get my blood pumping.  The Walk & Jog and Walk & Kick are each only 30 minutes, still quick, but when you have done them you will feel that you have gotten a real workout.  All the Walk Away the Pounds DVDs have simple moves that anyone can do and Leslie does a good job of demonstrating ways to modify the workout for beginners, if you want a stronger workout just carry 3-5 pound weights (except for the Walk & Kick-you could hurt yourself swinging them).  I would recommend the Power Series to anyone looking for a total body workout that requires no special equipment except a TV, DVD and about 5 feet of room in each direction.",1179100800,2,1008,4.3121693121693125
8036816,2,B0006284L4,"I was hoping this would provide an alternative to the aerobic-dance-kick workout DVDs that end up twisting my knees. The Walk series is probably ok if you're not used to working out, but it doesn't get my heart pumping. I have to modify it as a running in place work out to get much from it.",1171238400,,291,4.214285714285714
8036817,4,B0006284L4,"First of all, I love all of Leslie Sansone's videos and DVDs that I have in my possession.  This Power Series that I recently received is excellent.  The Power Mile is an energizing 15 minute workout.  It is great if you want to get a good workout in a small amount of time.  Walk and Jog takes you through a series of walking for three minutes and jogging for three minutes.  Leslie knows how to do the transition between the two.  Great high impact workout.  There is also low impact on the DVD for people who do not want to go high.  Walk and Kick is walking and kickboxing intervals.  It is a moderate impact exercise and is good if you want to get a good workout, but not work as hard.  Great series from Leslie Sansone.",1170720000,4,725,4.226277372262774
8036818,5,B0006284L4,"Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds: Power Mile is truly energizing and with the energetic fusion of movement and music (electronica/dance style), you will not only burn calories, you will feel an improvement in your mood. This routine has all the classic Leslie Sansone ""walk exercises"" and in 20 minutes, you have walked 1 mile. There are no fancy steps to master and the mood is ""no pressure, no problems.""

This is a perfect addition to any routine and you can spend 20 minutes warming up the muscles and then move from this workout into yoga or pilates. It is also great if you need an energizing break in the afternoon, feel your energy dropping or just want to brighten your day.

If you start with the Power Mile, you can learn all the basic steps and then progress in difficulty to the next two workouts. These workouts get you burning calories fast and then suddenly they are over. You can't believe you just worked out and that you completely forgot the time. It goes so fast, you may want to use the Power Mile DVD twice to walk 2 miles.

I've also enjoyed the ""You Can Do"" series that teaches the basics of Yoga, Pilates and Abs. The workouts are all perfect for anyone who has time constraints and sometimes you just don't want to learn choreography.

To health,

8036819,5,B0006284L4,These DVDs are excellent.  I have several of Leslie Sansone's other excercise tapes/DVDS and have always liked her workouts.  The power mile is good for when you have little time.  The other DVDs are great and gets you moving and sweating.  I recommend these to all.,1168387200,2,266,4.717391304347826
8036820,5,B0006284L4,I think these are great tapes. I love them and do 1 of them a day.,1143244800,2,66,3.1875
8036821,5,B0006284L4,"I've been doing Leslie Sansone videos for years, and have a myriad of DVDs from her Walk Away the Pounds exercise series.  I've grown to depend on the effective, low-impact workouts that Leslie delivers time and again.  This Power Series set is no exception.  The bonus:  since all three of these workouts come in at about 30 minutes or less, it really shoots my ""I don't have time to exercise"" excuse right out of the water! (I have a 20 month old daughter, so time is always an issue for me.)  I have a history of ankle problems that has caused me to stay away from high-impact aerobics most of my adult life, and that was the main reason I held off investing in this series for as long as I did.  However, I'm glad I finally caved and bought it!  While the intensity is bumped up a bit compared to some of her others, I still found all of these workouts completely do-able.  The 'Walk and Jog' workout does incorporate short two minute bursts of jogging during the aerobic portion of the workout, but there is a low-impact alternative shown.  That being said, I can handle the jogging without any trouble, even with my ankle trouble.  The pace moves pretty quick (2.5 miles in about 30 minutes!) and it's quite rewarding to know you've accomplished so much in such a short period of time.  The 'Walk and Kick' video is probably my favorite of the bunch.  It's Leslie's take on kick-boxing.  I have tried other kick-boxing workouts, and have always felt like I was making a fool out of myself (and I consider myself a fairly coordinated person).  This one, however, is lots of fun and easy to follow.  Again, the bulk of the workout is the standard walk aerobics; but Leslie interspurses two minute kick-boxing segments, similar to the format of the 'Walk and Jog' video.  Some of the segments focus on punching, others on kicking.  In my opinion this is one of Leslie's most upper-body intensive workouts, but compromises nothing in the way of aerobics or lower-body activity.  The last video in the series is the 'Power Mile' which I typically use on the mornings when I push the snooze button a couple too many times.  It's shorter than the other workouts--about 20 minutes, including the stretching portion at the end; but I still find it to be a great high-intensity, low-impact routine that's just challenging enough to make me break a sweat.  It's not mentioned anywhere on the discription, but she does use small hand-held weights to help get the upper-body more involved and bump up the intensity a bit.  The weights are not necessary...especially for a beginner.  You can do all the movements without weights to start out, or get creative and grab a couple of soup cans from your cupboard if you don't want to invest in the hand weights.  I really do enjoy each of these workouts individually, and am glad that I purchased them as a set.  Some of the reviews for the individual DVDs point out that the 'Walk and Jog' workout doesn't have a stretching segment at the end, but it does have a cool down.  I typically stretch on my own, anyway, so this isn't a big deal to me. Other complaints were about a couple of cueing errors; and while I do notice them, they don't bother me or disrupt my workout.  Leslie's energy and enthusiasm make these DVDs some of my workout favorites!",1121558400,41,3289,4.5699658703071675
