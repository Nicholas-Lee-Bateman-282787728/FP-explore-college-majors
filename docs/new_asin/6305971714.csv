1108956,5,6305971714,"I have owned this movie from I was 13 when I taped off of TV in 1985. My tape is well worn, since I have watched it every year since then for Halloween.  I was happily surprised when I saw it was released on DVD!  Although, this DVD is lacking on features. (Chapter Selection is the only feature)  This full screen version is very clear, and the sound did quite well on my stereo system.  The liner notes are poignant, and reveal that this film was brought to DVD by someone, like me, who loved it for what it is.  I would kill for some behind the scenes footage, cast bios, closed captioning, or bloopers, etc.  Alas, I imagine TV ""movies of the week"" didn't generate that kind of material, or that it would still be around 15 years later.  I would definitely recommend this film, not for it's DVD features, but for it's sentimental value & quirkiness. It's quite a funny film with a ""star studded"" cast, a cute story (cheesy dialogue that can be forgiven) and a great oldies soundtrack.",979862400,4,988,4.395604395604396
1108957,5,6305971714,"I remember watching The Midhight Hour when I was 6.  I loved it back then, but when I rediscovered it a local video store (the only store I have found  to carry it until the new release)I was in heaven.  It only got better than  I remembered.  It's got a simple charm that movies today seem to have lost.  A great storyline with interesting character developement. Not to mention  a great music soundtrack with oldies and even an original song sung by  Shari Belafonte. As a Film Major in college I can tell you cinematically  that anyone who wishes to enjoy a great halloween classic should see this  movie. I want everyone to go out and find this movie, buy it if you can. You  won't regret it!",967075200,6,696,4.359375
1108958,5,6305971714,"Long before Stephen King miniseries invaded the screen, there was The Midnight Hour. I saw this movie back in 1987 with my dad and we loved it. It was funny and exciting. Filled with a notable cast, this movie is also  able viewing for the entire family. It is not filled with blood and gore,  and does not depend on high budget effects to make it watchable. It is also  filled with good music from the 60s and 70s (even Shari Belefonte-Harper  gets to sing a song in a music video like montage). For my money, this is  one of the better made-for-TV horror flicks. Lots of fun and thrills await  you.",959731200,,600,4.3125

1108961,5,6305971714,"This was the first horror movie I ever saw and I love it. It's blend of comedy, horror, and shock/atmosphere creates enormously scary fun. A group of kids accidentally release a witch's curse on the town of  Pitchford/Pitchfork Cove. Soon vampires, werewolves, zombies, and maniic  killers are loose. Some are frightening, like the Vernon Nester zombie and  the Judge monster, and others are humorous like the midget werewolf and the  alcoholic ghoul. It's Halloween night, and the ghosts and ghouls decide to  create a party of their own! First rate fun with scares and  laughs.

On a side note, if the prices are ever normal again (20 to 25 bucks for instance), I would buy this up quick because I have been looking for it since I was in my early twenties and could not find it anywhere, it's not even on Hulu or anything like that! (Still doesn't make it worth hundreds of dollars) This movie is one of the best, a true classic. I didn't know it was comedic at all when I watched it every Halloween as a kid. I was in love with this movie. They usually showed it paired with another short movie about a boy who was too intelligent and had to be put down because he didn't meet society standards or something (if anyone knows the name of this one, please let me know).

Anyway, if you can find it for a reasonable price, buy it buy it buy it!",1372723200,2,993,4.221052631578948
1109105,4,6305971714,"This review is for the Region 2 Italian release DVD of the classic 1985 TV-movie, The Midnight Hour.

As anyone who has tried to locate an affordable DVD copy of this little gem in recent years has found out, the only official US release by Anchor Bay is long out of print.  That means, of course, sellers are asking exorbitant prices for whatever existing copies might be floating around.  I have also seen other more affordable copies for sale as well, but have been concerned they might be bootlegs, or DVD-R copies from old VHS tapes.

I recently began seeing copies of this Region 2 Italian release DVD advertised for sale, often at very affordable prices.  Being fortunate enough to have a region-free DVD player, my remaining concerns were regarding the quality of the DVD, and, of course, the presence of an English language soundtrack (I don't speak Italian).  Amazon's description of this DVD states that it does have an English language soundtrack, and I am happy to report that is indeed the case.  It also has the dubbed Italian soundtrack as an option, and the subtitle options consist of Italian subtitles or no subtitles at all (none in English).

I believe it is a proper studio produced DVD, though the overall quality is pretty average, probably not much better than VHS quality.  Full frame of course (this is a mid-80s TV movie we're talking about).  The case artwork and DVD label are nothing special, and perhaps even a bit blurry looking, but the disc itself shows none of the tell-tale signs of being a DVD-R.  Once I got it to play, it seemed to play just fine.  No freeze-ups or pixelation, smooth pauses, etc.  Of course, getting it to play was the trick.  I can't say for certain whether the problem is with the disc, or with my older model region free DVD player, but the menu is VERY aggravating to try to navigate.  It had four options (all in Italian, of course) - Play, Scene selection, Setup options, and Extras.  The cursor hardly moves, when it moves at all.  By simply pressing Play, the film began playing in English, but with Italian subtitles.  Returning to the root menu to try and turn off the subtitles, I got it to play in the dubbed Italian without any subtitles.  The problem is the cursor seems to lock up or even disappear half the time, so you can't tell which option you've selected, or if you've even managed to make a selection.  Very exasperating.  Finally after about 10 minutes, I managed to get the movie playing properly, in English with no subtitles, and as I mentioned, it played fine all the way through.

I'm also happy to report that the movie seems to be complete, as least in comparing it to the old worn out VHS copy I have.  I did not notice any missing scenes, and the wonderful musical soundtrack is intact, along with the legendary Wolfman Jack's accompanying radio presence (a huge plus for this little movie).  As I said, it plays fine, once you manage to get through the menu setup.  Just don't expect any sort of remastered crystal clear image.  Also, the so-called Extras are pretty lame.  A text style (again in Italian) background of the movie, along with some nice stills (scenes from the film), and music.  I think the text talks about the director and a couple of cast members, though being in Italian, I can't tell you what it says.  The other so-called extra was simply a DVD authoring credit, so that doesn't even count.  Bare bones, to say the least.

Bottom line is, I've loved this movie for years.  It's great fun, and In my opinion, it's one of the very best Halloween-themed films ever made.  If this were a remastered DVD release with a more user friendly menu (again, it could be my player.  I can't say for certain, though I've had no similar problems with other non-Region 1 discs), I'm sure I would give it five stars, even with the lack of decent extras.  Am I happy with my purchase?  Definitely, considering the ridiculous prices on the original Anchor Bay DVD.  Perhaps I'm just dreaming, but I'm hopeful that we will someday see a Region 1 re-release of this terrific flick, perhaps something with lots of extras.  But until that time, since I have the ability to play multi-region DVDs, I will content myself with this version..  The menu notwithstanding, it's a serviceable enough copy to replace my old VHS tape.  Perhaps I need to learn to curse in Italian for when I'm attempting to navigate the menu.  Somehow, that would seem appropriate.",1372636800,15,4444,4.631713554987212

1109132,5,6305971714,"For the past twenty-seven years, one of my annual Halloween watches is the little known horror comedy The Midnight Hour. It first aired on ABC on November 1, 1985 (Yep, one day after Halloween and two days after Garfield's Halloween Adventure aired on CBS) when I was a four-year-old. At the time my parents and I lived in a two-story farmhouse in the country (which was also haunted) and my parents recorded it onto a VHS tape. I would pester my mother into letting me watch The Midnight Hour, even though The Elf would always freak me out.

The Midnight Hour is set on Halloween in the small town of  Pitchford Cove, New England. Five high school seniors, Phil (Lee Montgomery), Mary (Dedee Pfeiffer), Mitch (Peter DeLuise), Vinnie (LeVar Burton), and Melissa (Shari Belafonte), break into the town's museum. They steal (or should I saw ""borrow"") a few costumes and an old trunk. They open the trunk at the local cemetery, in which they find a mysterious scroll. Melissa reads the scroll aloud, unleashing a horrible curse.

A few minutes after the kids leave the cemetery, the undead rise from their graves. The undead's leader is Melissa's own ancestor, Lucinda Cavender, who was put to death over 300 hundred years ago for being a vampire.

While little kids are trick-or-treating, the teenagers of Pitchford Cove are attending the costume party at Melissa's house. Phil arrives at the party hoping to get the attention of Mary, who he has a crush on, but Mary already has a date. He leaves just as the undead arrive for the party.

On his way home, Phil meets a lost cheerleader named Sandra ""Sandy"" Matthews. The two share a brief romantic encounter, before a werewolf attacks them. Sandy informs Phil about the town's curse and that he must undo the curse before midnight or the undead will walk forever.

The Midnight Hour scared me to death when I was four, but viewing it an adult, it isn't even close to being scary. The movie was briefly released to DVD a few years ago, in which I didn't even know about it, but it is now out of print. A few years back, I dubbed my parents VHS recording onto a DVD with the original commercials intact. The picture quality is good, but I do hope that the movie would be released onto DVD in the near future. What's not to like about the movie? It has vampires, werewolves, and zombies. Yes, there is even a campy dance scene with the undead! There is also a little romance involving Phil and the mysterious Sandy! The Midnight Hour is one of my favorite movies to watch around Halloween!",1351555200,4,2535,4.609756097560975

I've always loved Halloween themed movies: I affectionately refer to them as ""Halloweenies"". Besides John Carpenter's Halloween, The Midnight Hour was always one I looked back on fondly. After VCRs became a dead technology I started looking for it on DVD, finally finding it here a decade later on Amazon. Ironically 4 days ago, when there was 13 days left till All Hallow's Eve, The Midnight Hour came in. It was ironic because it was the 13th Halloweenie I'd gotten this year.

According to some of the other posts the movie was stored in a warehouse that burned to the ground taking the film with it.  I wanted the movie badly, but not bad enough to pay $145.00.  I spent a year on and off looking for anyone that had it cheaper.  Finally I went to a site called Atomic Mall and found a seller with 44 copies New at $15.00 per copy.  I bought 2 (one is going in my safe).  I don't think anyone has even attempted to post a comment on Amazon for about 3 years, but if the copies I get are good then it is coming off my wishlist here.  It is a great 80's movie and I want to share it with my wife and children.",1289520000,,1051,3.8598130841121496

I was seriously in love with Sandy... She seems so beautiful and innocent, yet it always gets me in that scene when her and Phil dance to Sea of Love and she wants to go that bridge and Phil alludes to it not being very exciting any more, the look in her eyes, the way that she looks at him when she says ""Well why don't we go anyway?

However, when I saw it the second time, I observed it a good story that had potential to be an awesome movie.  The basic synopsis is that a group of teens looking for some kicks to add some spice for their Halloween festivities discover that a witch who is an ancestor to one of the teens placed a curse on the town of Pitchford for the dead and undead to arise on Halloween night.  This particular teen and her friends retrieve the ancient 1600's curse by stealing it from a museum, and recited it at the cemetary where the witch was buried. Unbeknownst to them until a short time later when the ghouls, the witch and company are crashing the teens' Halloween party, that the curse came to life.  Now it is up to one of the other teens, named Phil, who is the descendent of the man who put an end to the curse in the 1600's to repeat history before midnight on Halloween or the curse would live out forever. It has its funny parts, scary parts, and sweet romance parts.

1109200,5,6305971714,"Fans of cheesy Halloween movies are thrilled to have their own made for TV favorite from the big hair 1980s returned to them.  In its day it was notable for its smooth mixing of cast members both black and white into one jolly high school-themed spookfest.  The young actors look like they were having a whale of a time.  Even Levar Burton, from ROOTS, was showing a more happy go lucky side to his personality as he essayed Vinnie Davis, one of a bunch of youths who love to go to museums and read out the hieroglyphics on ancient scrolls for kicks.  The lovely Shari Belafonte also gets to read from the scroll as well, and the Halloween curse of Pitchford Cove gets unleashed just in time for October 31.  Belafonte sings, too, and a whole jukebox filled with catchy monster themed pop songs plays all through the soundtrack.

The white stars are charming too, though less memorable.  As the young lovers from different ""time zones"" Jonna Lee and Lee Montgomery have their moments, while Cindy Morgan really looks like a period piece.  They should put a picture of her in the dictionary under the word ""eighties.""  The movie is lightweight, not very scary, it's cute in the way of something like ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING.  Expect no more than that and you won't be disappointed.

William Bleich who wrote this movie was also responsible for the Abel Ferrara big rig trucking movie called THE GLADIATOR with a fanboy cast of Ken Wahl, Nancy Allen, and Stan Shaw (plus 60s icons Rosemary Forsyth and Linda Thorson in smaller roles).  Bleich was a competent scenarist who could keep his audience in the palm of his hand by pressing all the right buttons, and MIDNIGHT HOUR shows him at his best.  Veteran TV director Jack Bender presided, but the juice is largely Bleich's.

First off, this movie has it all!!! It has horror, action, comedy, suspense, drama, & love. The best part about this movie is that it can be enjoyed by everybody. While many people consider this movie to be really cheesy, I think any made-for- TV movie that was made in 1985 and makes it to the DVD platform speaks volumes about the movie.
Asides from it being a great movie, it really opens your eyes to the beauty of music you may not have had a chance to appreciate (because it wasn't from your time).

I turned it on as a lark, since I'm a longtime fan of horror movies. As stated by other reviewers, this movie was definitely influenced by the ""Thriller"" video (I think the same people did effects for both, but don't quote me). The plot revolves around an ancient witch-vampire's curse on the town of Pitchford Cove. It builds as the town quickly succumbs to the vampirism, almost like a virus spreading out of control. Sort of like ""Salem's Lot""- your best friend might now be one of the undead! To me the standout character was Jonna Lee, who played the also risen 1950s Cheerleader. Ms. Lee had a brief career in the 80s, often playing teenage girls in movies, and TV shows like ""Airwolf"" and ""Mike Hammer"". Believe it or not, I guessed the ending when I first saw it.

I thought that this movie was lost and gone into the TV archives like all those other ""feature films"" that we used to see on all those networks in the 80's.
Since i lost my vhs copy of this film when i moved, i have searched high and low for this movie, so you have to understand that when i got my copy delievered to my house, i was at that moment the happiest guy ever..Yes, i know it's just a movie but it also brought back alot of memories!
I first saw this movie on ABC as one their special halloween presentations and i fell in love with it, of course it wasn't scary (ok, some small parts) but that didn't matter because the story was so good, the acting was great, the music in the movie was perfect, and all the characters in the film were so into their parts that it really made this movie seem so real and feel so magical!
The only things that i didn't like about the movie (but it wasn't that big of a deal!) was the DVD cover art which could of been better and that there are no special features except for the usual chapter selections.
One more thing, for all people expecting a bloody horror film, forget it..because you'll be very dissapointed and probably hate the film but if you want to watch an old-fashioned style scary movie with some great music and great fun..YOU GOTTA CHECK THIS OUT!!",1090454400,3,1375,4.292307692307692

My Mom taped it for me the first time it was on, and when my cousin misplaced my videotape, I was shattered!! I found this rare gem one night at a Blockbuster and was absolutely overjoyed!! Now that it is out on DVD I am in heaven!! My only lament is the lack (or absence of is more like it) of extras on the DVD. But I guess being a made-for-tv movie, there really couldn't be much to work with for extras.
This movie is such a rare find. It's a first rate 80's horror movie that encompasses camp, humor, a little scariness and a great soundtrack (another should've been) and of course those laughable 80's fashions: who could forget the pumps worn with white ankle socks?? But this was so cool back then and it's still kinda cool now, in a way that probably only 80's kids can truly appreciate and understand. This is a movie that you wanna show people who've never seen it and you KNOW they'll enjoy. Sure there are a lot of incongruities like why are some zombies not decayed at all?? Well they're main characters of course and for plot purposes one of our unwitting teen characters has to fall in love with them!
For me this move is not only a good horror flick, but it conjures up memories of past Halloweens when Halloween meant having fun and being a little scared--like trick or treating (which at 25 I still miss!!), and staying up late on Halloween night and watching creepy movies with your family; a time when Halloween meant something to you and your friends and you waited all throught the month of October to get to the 31st! And school Halloween parties with cupcakes and goodies.
I know when I watch this movie, I'm that little seven year old again, in her pajamas watching the movie in the dark and getting a little laugh or a little scare here and there.
Living in Salem, MA (the self-proclaimed Halloween capital of the world) is great, but nothing holds a candle to being a kid on Halloween except maybe having ""The Midnight Hour"" to watch over and over again!

The female lead alone is cute enough to keep you watching but it's also has enough comical moments to make even the most disappointed of us let out a great big whopping chuckle every now and then. The one thing this movie could have done without was the cheesy and completely unnecessary musical dance number that for reasons unknown got dropped into the middle of this film.

1109219,5,6305971714,"This 1980's made for TV movie opens on Halloween morning with a paper boy preparing to go out on his route. Adding a baseball card to his bicycle spokes, he accidentally cuts his finger, and with that first tiny drawing of blood (the goriest moment in the film actually), the title ""The Midnight Hour"" flashes on the screen with ""Wolfman"" Jack's voice over, ""Lookout, it's the midnight hour! Owwwooooooooooo!!!""
  Our story begins here in Pitchford Cove, or ""Pitchfork Cove"" as the residents sometimes jokingly call it. As Phil Grenville reads his report on local Halloween history to the rest of his High School class, we are told that a witch named Lucinda placed a Halloween curse on the town hundreds of years ago, and that it was HIS ancestor who stopped it from coming true. Suddenly, Phil's friend Mitch gets the bright idea to sneak into the local witch museum to borrow costumes for tonight's Halloween party, and with his friends eager to do it, Phil reluctantly comes along. In the museum, the group of teens find an old scroll, break the seal, and find an old curse written on it. Off to the graveyard to read it allowed, just for kicks! Unfortunately, their friend Melissa is the descendant of witch Lucinda, and she reads the incantation. Thinking it did not work, the frieds head home to prepare for the party. Meanwhile, all manor of evil creatures, from werewolves, to vampires, to witches, to the bodies in the graveyard, come to life to wreak vengeance on Pitchford Cove. Many comic moments arise from seeing the regular townsfolk interact with zombies they believe to merely be people in costumes, especially at the Halloween party, but some terrifying moments occur too, because while some creatures seem to just be hanging out, the rest came to kill and spread their evil!
  Amongst the horrific creatures however, a beautiful 50's era cheerleader named Sandy has also come to life, looking as cute as ever for some reason. Phil and Sandy meet on the way to the party, and while they fall in love, they also discover the evil that has the town in its clutches, and do their best to stop it before The Midnight Hour, when it will be too late!
  The Midnight Hour is a wonderful TV movie from the mid 80's. I remember seeing it the first time it aired. It's corny, naturally, it's a cheezy 80's move. There are bad lines, the High School Students look like College Graduates, and Shari Belafonte, who plays Melissa, breaks out into a song and dance number at the party for no concievable reason. But in that cheezy, non-gory style of Halloween horror, it is great fun! The love story is sweet and sincere, the constant ""Wolfman"" Jack radio program playing spooky oldies in the background is wonderful, and the monsters are just great! Sure, the fangs look fake, you can see where the ""fog"" is being released from in the cemetary, and the first werewolf looks more like a guy in a bigfoot suit, but if you lose yourself in the story it's really fun and exciting and even can give you chills in some moments, when watched in the proper atmosphere of course. That's why I can't help but give this incredibly fun movie 5 stars, and rank it with my Halloween must watch films like Hocus Pocus, It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown, Sleepy Hollow, Harry Potter, Ichabod and Mr. Toad, and the original The Worst Witch, among others!",1025481600,31,3345,4.680272108843537
1109220,4,6305971714,"Part of the appeal of ""Midnight Hour"" is that it's a good, fun Halloween film for the entire family but also enjoys an almost cult status among the adult set. Though not ultimately destined for a place in the Horror Hall of Fame I look at it like this: ""Midnight Hour"" is like that baseball player who's a hometown hero but never achieves recognition outside those who grew up watching him. Hope that makes sense.
The story is pretty cliche. A bunch of teenagers find a scroll in a museum that will raise the dead when read aloud in a cemetary on Halloween night. They do and hilarity ensues. I hung out with a pretty diverse bunch in high school but I never knew anyone who's idea of fun was getting together to read musty old incantations. Anyway, what follows next is B-movie actors getting zombified for the duration of the movie until the curse can be broken.
What I love most about this movie, though, is its encompassing of age old tradition and classic seasonal imagery. This is partly why it has become inextricably linked with my memories of Halloween.
If you're looking for an enjoyable movie with a fun, if a bit formula plot, for your Halloween party then it doesn't get much better than ""Midnight Hour"". Thank Anchor Bay for bringing this rare Halloween gem back to prominence.",996537600,10,1291,4.593073593073593
