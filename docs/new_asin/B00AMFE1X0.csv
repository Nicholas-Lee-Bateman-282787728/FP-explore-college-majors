8553646,4,B00AMFE1X0,"I like this dvd primarily because of the principle of it. I have extremely tight hamstrings and hips and know I need to stretch but I don't. Having this dvd ready to go means I don't have to think about what stretches to do, I just need to hit ""play."" I also like it because there isn't any time wasted in instructions but that may mean people who have never done yoga are frustrated with little instruction. He holds the poses long enough that it's easy to figure it out before he moves on. He assumes you know a little about form and doesn't give the ""don't let your knee bend past the toes"" warnings. The sound quality is poor but you can still understand him just fine.",1419552000,,673,4.265625
8553647,2,B00AMFE1X0,I did ot think the stretches were very useful for stretching out my back and legs before or after a ride. I would not reccomend it.,1392422400,,131,4.076923076923077
8553648,4,B00AMFE1X0,"This is a great, easy to follow program. Do-able pre and post ride, each in around 15 minutes. A good investment of time to ride and feel better. The audio was a bit difficult to hear clearly, but the video is excellent - simple, well demonstrated moves to get your read to ride and to stretch out afterwards. Makes a difference!",1388966400,,329,4.409836065573771
8553649,5,B00AMFE1X0,I really love this DVD. It has nice clear directions and is easy to follow along with. Great for stretching before and after a road ride. I would have to say that this DVD is definitely one of the best available.,1368057600,3,212,4.195121951219512
8553650,5,B00AMFE1X0,"This DVD is great. I am new to yoga but am an avid cyclist - I usually do about 2 15 mile rides a week. When I started using this DVD about a month ago I was suffering from back pain after my ride, but after using this DVD before and after my ride, no more back pain! I definitely recommend this DVD for those who are suffering from post ride pain or just need a better stretch.",1367625600,2,378,3.858974358974359
