8188473,5,B000P2A5QW,"Introduction to RV by Prudence Calabrese. Technically low quality DVDs from an entertainment point of view (White board talk). It is like a home movie of people in a get together in a Days Inn in California. I was amused by Pru. The ""home movie"" recorded class conducted while there was a power failure in the hotel. The power came back on while Pru was teaching.  Pru presented several techniques not taught in other RV home study courses. She teaches a different resolution to analytical overlay. Pru uses the terms ""weird"" and ""woo woo"" to describe what she is doing. She said she viewed ET children playing with futuristic toys on a planet orbiting a star in the pleiades. She says she contacts para physicals like ghosts. She said one of the woman viewers working with her had a ghost fall in love with her. She has been accused of being self deluded or a fraud. I understand she quit doing RV training.",1282089600,,908,4.570552147239264
8188474,1,B000P2A5QW,"It started out ok with the gingerbread scanning but man did it go off track!  She should have shown more about how to make initial contact with the person to be healed.  She showed alot about remotely scanning a persons body for problems, but nothing as to how to physically heal a person (and thats the main thing)  I can get a regular doctor to tell me whats wrong.  healing the problem is what she left out.  Then to top it off the 2nd half shows  a regular remote viewing session which is a total waste. I would have bought the other discs if I wanted regular rv crap. She should have shown how to access and physically heal a person.",1250899200,,638,4.231404958677686
