8399641,5,B003LCR69C,I was just so happy to buy this! This was the best thing I have ever bought in my life. I just love skins and Amazon was the only place for me to actually buy the dvd's. Thanks,1359331200,,176,3.6578947368421053
8399642,5,B003LCR69C,"All I have to say about this it's a incredible collection! I'm thinking the second part of season 5 will be out when the next wave of SKINS comes out in 2013, maybe mid fall or something like that just remember people region 2 pal format. Don't bust on someones balls because you did not read carefully. Enjoy watching, It's a great series. Steve and heather",1355011200,,358,4.4393939393939394
8399643,1,B003LCR69C,"It was obvious making a purchase from the United States that a region 1 dvd was required but they sent me a region 2 only publication.  Skins UK.  Now I'm looking into region unlockers and switching a player over to region 1 and not having much luck at that either.  Any advice out there?  Thank you, Gary Charlton.

8399644,5,B003LCR69C,I fell in love with show while Vacationing in London the 1st day.  Due to jet lag me and my girlfriend decided to stay in enjoy the hotel and get an early start the next day.  Turned on the TV and saw my first episode!  Great show but do be warned on the region code.  Loved the Naomily story.  Give it a chance and you'll love it!,1301097600,3,331,3.8805970149253732
8399645,4,B003LCR69C,I love this show but the dvds are region 2 and my dvd player only plays region 1 dvds. I suggest getting a region free dvd player unless you don't mind watching on your laptop like me.,1299024000,2,184,4.0
8399646,5,B003LCR69C,"I'd fallen in love with the cast from the first season and bought this to watch the rest. I'm so happy I did! My roommates and I are all HOOKED on Skins. Not to mention, they just recently started a US version of Skins on MTV, and we know that this version is vastly superior!

I'm hearing impaired and love, well need, subtitles which was a motivating factor in buying Skins on disc. It didn't mention in the information whether or not it had subtitles, but I took a chance and got lucky. So for those out there that are like me- there ARE English subtitles! :)

There are about 3/4 CD's a season and the last disc has special features that were actually pretty entertaining. The main menu lets you watch the whole disc, watch by episode, or even find by scene, and has an English Subtitles on/off button.

I'm from the U.S. so I DID have to change the region code on my laptop so I could watch it (and we got an HDMI cord to plug it into the TV). I can only change the region code 4 times before it picks a default and I know this is somewhat the same for others- so heads up!

Each character gets their own episode each season, which I found incredibly cool. A different character perspective helped to reveal information otherwise unknown if the story was presented any other way. You see a more personal side of each and each quickly worm their way into your heart.

Season 1 was what got me hooked on Skins. I fell in love with Cassie, the sweetheart with anorexia, Sid, the virgin, Tony, the top dog, Michelle the hottest girl, Tony's girlfriend, and Sid's hugest crush, Chris the pill-popper and cougar-chaser, Maxxie the sweet gay guy, Anwar, his best friend and Muslim, Jal the sassy clarinet player, and the quiet mischievous Effy, Tony's sister. Season 2 came bursting out through the gate and went even further with each character, sucking you in every single moment.

Season 3+4 have a different cast because each season is a year in college (which is two years- It's not the same in the US), and keeping an open mind you fall in love with the second generation really quickly. Everyone else has graduated, but Effy, the younger sister in the first 2 series, is taking over. She's seemingly perfect and everyone falls in love with her, but you learn what's really going on in her ""clever"" mind. It's also cute because you can catch tiny homages to the first cast.
Cook, JJ, and Freddie are best friends and all fall in love with Effy. Cook is a jerk but somehow you like him because he really just doesn't care. JJ has Autism which was incredibly unique. Freddie is a little romantic and adorable. Pandora, who actually appeared in a few of the last episodes of season 2 returns as Effy's ditsy lovable best friend. Thomas comes from the Congo and is such a warm-hearted kind soul and a good boy. We also have twins, Katie and Emily, who we find out really aren't the least bit alike. Naomi and Emily end up having their own romantic affair.

This is probably the longest review ever- but hopefully helpful nevertheless! Enjoy Skins :)",1297814400,16,3049,4.482882882882883
