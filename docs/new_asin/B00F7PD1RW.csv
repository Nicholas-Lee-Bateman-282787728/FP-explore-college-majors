5969423,5,B00F7PD1RW,Where have all the classic tv shows gone? Excellent writing and wonderful stories for the whole family. I wish there were more to view.,1415059200,5,135,4.666666666666667
5969424,5,B00F7PD1RW,"I loved seeing this ""I remember Mama"" dvd.  Brings back many fond memories.  Keep 'em coming!!",1404691200,8,94,4.8125
5969425,4,B00F7PD1RW,"Good to see this program again, though the quality (probably from film source material) is fairly rough.  Hope some more episodes (with some historical documentation) will be available in the future.  This is the kind of wholesome, family-oriented, values-based entertainment that has disappeared in favor of the ""new normal"" morally-degenerate offerings.",1395878400,11,355,5.9411764705882355
5969426,5,B00F7PD1RW,This program brings back so many memories of my childhood.  Every week the whole family would all sit down and watch this lovely program.,1395187200,13,137,4.708333333333333
5969427,5,B00F7PD1RW,"The problem with ""I Remember Mama"" or just ""Mama"" is that there just weren't enough kinetoscopes made of the episodes.  Starting with the very basic premise of the Kathryn Forbes' novel and play--the relatively minor trials and tribulations of a Norwegian immigrant family in early Twentieth Century San Francisco--the stories have real heart and soul.  The half-hour teleplays (with the Maxwell House coffee commercials built right into the story) were written and directed by some top NYC talents and broadcast live.  The family isn't remarkable.  They are basically good people sometimes capable of being prideful, or selfish, or insensitive, but they face the usual crises that every family faces, and come together as a family in the end.  The reproduction quality of this tape is poor--but I'll take it, alone with every other ""I Remember Mama"" episodes they can deliver.",1394323200,26,877,5.235714285714286
5969428,5,B00F7PD1RW,"i loved the old show and even the poor quality of the video, make it authentic.  i was disappointed there were only 4 episodes on the DVD",1393286400,16,137,4.074074074074074
8612873,5,B00F7PD1RW,"Still my favorite TV show of all time.  Every Friday night at 7 we would hear ""Maxwell House Presents Mama Starring Peggy Wood"".  For several years I would never go anywhere on Friday night.  I always hope that someday more kinescopes will be found so that more episodes will become available.  I wonder if the show would even have a chance for a pilot in this day and age.  At least younger people can see her as the Mother Abbess in THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  Thank you, Robert Wise for that.",1529020800,,488,4.3076923076923075
8612874,5,B00F7PD1RW,"This was the best.  I am Norwegian and as a child always loved this TV show.  When I finally found a few episodes, it was wonderful and great memories.",1509667200,,151,4.172413793103448

8612877,5,B00F7PD1RW,My family watched this show weekly. It's one of my fondest memories since my 4 grandparents were Norwegian immigrants & my mother was born in 1910. I thought the video quality was very good. I wish more shows had been transferred. I found two more. On You Tube with good quality. I was delighted to see some existed.,1462665600,2,316,4.4655172413793105
