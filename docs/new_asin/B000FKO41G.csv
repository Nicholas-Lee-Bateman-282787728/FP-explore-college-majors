2571689,5,B000FKO41G,"I think the coolest part of this package is of course is the feature film SECRET OF THE SWORD.  Of course this is the first five episodes of SHE-RAH.  This is information we all know and anyone who is reading this doesnt' want to read this again..

BUT

I was expecting them to have SECRET OF THE SWORD as it's own release, this really pleases me.

This was a way to release the same BEST OF collection with SHE-RAH as they did with HE-MAN as well as give us the film.

GOOD JOB guys.. they're apparantly not CAPITOLIST PIGS! and trying to drag more money out of us.

Don't have a lot to add, as all the major details have pretty much been covered in previous reviews, but from what I've read, this set is going to be jam-packed with goodies, including artcards from comic book artists Brandon Peterson and Joe Chiodo.  This should be good!",1148860800,7,396,4.72463768115942
2571691,5,B000FKO41G,"It's been a long slow process. Online petitions, the revamp version Cartoon Network attempted(admirably) and constant devotion by fans. But now the saga is ours for the taking as He-Man and his twin sister She-Ra: Princess of Power arrives on DVD. Returning to the small screens, largely thanks to website stir by He-Man.org, BCI Eclipse rereleased a Best Of DVD for the one that started it all, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, as well as two subsequent volumes containing the entire first season of the hit animated series. Then the transition cemented his twin sister as He-Man and She-Ra's Christmas Special recieved the BCI treatment, hinting at the rerelease of the best possible crossover for a spinoff, She-Ra's first five episodes.

That's right. The Secret of The Sword, the compilation into an hour and a half long feature film is being released on DVD alongside the five best episodes of She-Ra: Princess of Power. You cant possibly ask for anything better than that for devotees of Lou and Erika Scheimer, as well as the entire Filmation family. Also, a plus of The Secret of the Sword, is the linking of the voice actors names to their characters on the show. Certainly giving John Erwin and Melendy Britt, but especially Alan Oppenheimer the recognition of their hard work.

Take control of the Power and the Honor of Greyskull and buy this DVD set. Prove that BCI Eclipse as well as fans around the world have done the right thing in bringing back these shows. And remember a time where the animation and stories were worth something. Let He-Man and She-Ra stand up to Spongebob and Jimmy Neutron.

2571692,5,B000FKO41G,"While I love and will always love watching He-Man, I think that I am happy more so that She-Ra is at last coming to DVD. This is because I can clearly remember her. Born in 1980, I watched He-Man and any re-runs, but I was of conscious age when She-Ra debuted, not to mention its reairing on the USA Network's short lived Cartoon Express in the very early '90's. I never missed an episode, even remembering a favorite one, ""The Stone in the Sword""--which is on the ""Best of"" DVD!! She-Ra was a such a staple of mine. Even after buying not-so-great copies of He-Man off a particular site, I'm glad that I didn't buy She-Ra from them. The episodes stank and were all blurry. I was happy soon thereafter to see the actual digitally enhanced version of He-Man to come to DVD. And now She-Ra, too!! *JOY* I'm simply trying to get hold of all my childhood cartoons for the new ages to see, like Thundercats, Fraggle Rock, He-Man, and She-Ra! I say any parent should do the same. I've got a new niece and can't wait to watch with her! Look at it this way--they will never know the joy of waking up early for the infamous ""Saturday morning cartoons""!! Bring it back for them!",1147478400,9,1167,4.382488479262673
2571693,5,B000FKO41G,"When I saw that they were releasing the He-Man series on DVD, along with certain He-Man episodes that were voted the best onto a DVD box set. I suspected that once they were finished with the He-Man series, She-Ra, Princess of Power would be next.

I was OBVIOUSLY RIGHT and I couldn't be MORE HAPPY too. ""IT'S ABOUT TIME"" they released a She-Ra series and I can't wait to see ""Best of She-Ra: Princess of Power"" as well as the series, if it comes out.

2571694,5,B000FKO41G,"My life is complete.

I have spent MANY, MANY YEARS waiting for ""She-Ra"" to come out on DVD, and it's FINALLY happening! HOORAY!

The release of the ""She-Ra"" DVD sets will be similar to that of the ""He-Man"" DVDs. The first ""She-Ra"" DVD set will consist of the movie ""The Secret of the Sword"" (which features He-Man and explains how Adam has a twin sister, how Adora became She-Ra, etc.) as well as five of the most popular episodes from the series, which were voted on by fans at He-Man.org. The five episodes that will be featured on the ""Best of She-Ra"" DVD are ""The Price of Freedom,"" ""The Sword in the Stone,"" ""Horde Prime Takes a Holiday,"" ""Of Shadows and Skulls,"" and (my personal favorite) ""Sweet Bee's Home.""

The quality of the ""He-Man"" DVD sets is incredible, and the ""She-Ra"" DVDs are expected to be just as good, if not better. In addition to the fully restored episodes, the ""Best of She-Ra"" DVD set will include a documentary, feature-length audio commentary, a music video, storyboard spreads, DVD-ROM scripts, ""She-Ra"" trivia, hidden Easter eggs, and two collectible comic book art cards. How cool is that?!

Also, just like the ""He-Man"" DVDs, the complete ""She-Ra: Princess of Power"" series will be released on DVD in three separate volumes beginning this fall. Each DVD set will contain a variety of special bonus features.

Words cannot express how excited I am about this DVD set! I grew up obsessed with She-Ra, and I am STILL obsessed with She-Ra! When I was a young girl I owned all the She-Ra action figures, the Crystal Castle...even that awful Crystal Falls playset that had a pump shaped like a seashell and squirted water all over everything! I had She-Ra books, She-Ra clothes, a She-Ra birthday cake...EVERYTHING! For the past 20 years I've had to settle for watching my treasured yet crappy VHS copies of the series that I always feared would fall apart at any moment. Now I'm finally going to have the entire series on DVD to enjoy in all its glory for the rest of my life! I couldn't be happier!

July 18 is already marked on my calendar...I am probably going to take the day off work so I can sit at home and watch ""She-Ra"" all day! I'll be able to recite the words to every episode, too, since I watched them all about a thousand times! ""I am Adora, He-man's twin sister and defender of the Crystal Castle."" AHHHH! I get goosebumps just thinking about it!

SHE-RA FOREVER!!!",1146873600,94,2409,4.6276346604215455
2571695,5,B000FKO41G,"Ever since I was a little girl I loved watching She-Ra and I loved the toys.  I always remember the first time I got a She-Ra doll for Christmas.  We went to a toy store and my mom told me to choose a Barbie doll for Christmas (I guess I already figured out Santa didn't exist), but instead I remember I walked to another aisle and told her I wanted this other doll.  It turned out to be She-Ra.  Since it was about half the price of a Barbie doll she told me to get two of them; so I got She-Ra and Catra.  On the 24th we were told that we can only open one present and guess which one I chose?!

The cartoon was so fun to watch.  I would hurry from school to watch at least 15 minutes left of the cartoon.  When the Secret of the Sword was aired (during school hours), I was sick so I couldn't go to school for two days; obviously I didn't want to miss any episodes so I kept pretending to be ""sick"".

Me and my sister loved the show!  I loved the powers that the characters possessed and I loved to see She-Ra flying on Swift Wind all the way up in the sky.  I always used to pretend I was She-Ra at home raising a sword and fighting the bad guys.

This is a DVD that I would not miss for the world and I will also purchase all the seasons once they are released.  I also have DVD's of He-man.

I really recommend these two awesome 80 cartoons if in some way you want to relive your childhood. Plus they also have some very good moral values to give.  Totally cool cartoons!  Thanks BCI!!",1146700800,10,1491,3.9696969696969697
2571696,5,B000FKO41G,"BCI The people responcible for He-Man's DVDS are releasing all 93 episodes of She-Ra in 3 volumes like the He-Man sets.

The New Adventures of He-Man will be released in 2 volumes at the same time as the last 2 She-Ra volumes. the Final original He-Man volume will be released at the same time as the first She-Ra Volume.

The Secret Of The Sword was also the first five episodes of She-Ra with a lot of extra scenes on it which will be the first 5 episodes on the first 1 out of 3 She-Ra volumes

She-Ra is one of the best 80's classics. plus it liturally follows on from He-Man as the Secret Of The Sword tells us and now all us fans can finally see what has not been on TV for the past 15 years.",1146700800,42,1159,4.0701754385964914

2571731,5,B000FKO41G,"I've watched both He-Man and She-Ra when I was a young kid. I never understood too much of the storyline to show because I was so young but after I started to collect them on vhs as a little bit old kid (7 years old), I understood them more. After about a year I grew apart from both series and juse forgot about them. I recently (now almost 30) was flipping through channels and I came across the Spanish version and knew I had to watch them.

What gets me is why are the prices so high? Secret of the sword was a great movie, but no one should fork out $99.00 for a dvd movie, NOT even over $20 (at the highest). Sellers are just trying to make a profit over a  hour and some change movie. If this movie came with a bunch of little promo stuff, I could see but for a movie with really no special features or anything to make it this valuable is just foolishness. You would be better off buying ""The Best of She-Ra"" which has the movie as well as 5 fan favorite episodes with a bunch of special features and it's less then $20.00 or you can go with either ""The complete She-Ra Collection"" which is the complete series or ""She-Ra Season 1 Vol. 1"".

Now for my review. I give this movie 5 stars because it's not only great to relive this classic kids show but the fact the company who released the movie on to DVD did a great touch up on it. Scenes really stand out and colors are vibrant from each and every second of the film. Audio quality is perfect and it has the original theme song ""I have the Power"". If I had to say one thing wrong with the film is that sometimes it does feel lost and if you haven't watched He-Man or She-Ra in years like me, you kind of forget characters names or the plot of the series. Watching how Adora becomes She-Ra is a fantastic way to start the series. You learn more about He-Man and She-Ra's back story as well as a few other characters back stories.

This is a great movie for anyone who wants to relive the nostalgia of the series or anyone who is looking to get their kids involved with the classics. You will not be disappointed! Just remember to go with any of the She-Ra  sets mentioned above and not this over price single dvd.",1446249600,,2172,4.149643705463183

I will say, it seems like one or maybe two of the cartoons might actually be a ""He-Man"" with She-Ra as a kind of main guest, but otherwise, we are all fans!  And He-Man showing up really isn't a bad thing b/c then our son has a good reason to watch it, too.  Just some decent, non-creepy cartooning here.

2571821,5,B000FKO41G,"This 'lead in' to the She-Ra spin off established it as more than either the female version of He-Man or another vehicle to market toys.

In a parallel dimension, an evil army enslaved the good kingdom of Bright Moon, including their queen and her daughter. Conditions are so bad that He-Man is sent to bring a mystical sword (and her real destiny) to his brainwashed sister who currently serves as the Force Captain of the Horde.

Nothing ultimately prevents her from eventually also assuming her rightful destiny as She-Ra, even though she now works on behalf of the Great Rebellion and their fight against Adora's former employers. Like Xena, she is a heroine with a past.

Now having my masters in social science and having done a fair deal of political organizing, such a plot is commendably detailed for what was supposed to have been a children's series.

Instead of going for the cheap 'bang-bang' approach, the series apparently opted to teach viewing audiences a lesson about ethics and justice, believing we'd catch on.

When He-man brings Adora back to the people at the end of the story, they are understandably and initially suspicious of her motives. This is a character who previously had caused great pain and suffering upon them and their families as Horde Force Captain. But having learned her lesson, Adora says she wants to fight for their cause. She herself wants to ensure that the Horde cannot continue hurting Bright Moon.

Another good lesson which the storyline imparts is forgiveness. Going around angry at everybody is counterproductive when the 'real hero' in a community can recognize when forgiveness is appropriate. Therefore, the people of Bright Moon do welcome Adora into their ranks.

The animation is (giving fair warning) not going to be up to 'current standards' of quality. This was the 1980's. However the storyline is what makes the product worth viewing. The writers and production team took time with this part of the product crafting.",1288051200,4,1980,4.9818181818181815

2571854,4,B000FKO41G,"Ten best DVD collections are a smart idea; not only are they much more affordable than a complete season (or series) box set, they usually contain the episodes most loved by established fans of the series. I have often found them an ideal way to sample a program without having to shell out a large initial investment. Keeping this in mind, it is no surprise that BCI has had incredible sales success with their Best of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe DVD. It's only natural that fans of She-Ra: Princess of Power get the same treatment.

The Best of She-Ra Princess of Power contains a full ten episodes despite the fact that it appears to have only 6. The reason for this is that the first five episodes of the program were combined to form a single 100-minute feature film known as The Secret of the Sword. Yes these five episodes do indeed make up the first portion of the She-Ra Season 1 Volume One box set (also from BCI). However, here in this special edition 2 disc set, The Secret of the Sword is retained in its original theatrical format, which means no episode breaks.

For those who have yet to enjoy it, The Secret of the Sword is actually the pilot to the She-Ra series and contains not only her specific background but also her ties with Adam, Prince of Eternia (and He-Man). It is exceptionally well done despite some clearly Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars inspired moments (rather than the Prancing Pony, our heroes meet up at an inn called the Laughing Swan and Bow's introduction can only be described as very Strider-like, minus the pipe of course). On the Star Wars side of things, not only do we discover that our hero and heroine are twins, we also hear about a totalitarian empire, I mean Horde and a rebel alliance formed to restore freedom to the land. The Secret of the Sword even had its own version of Horde Storm Troopers who later become mindless robots clearly due to the ethics of children's programming associated with harming real people (yes, even the bad guys).

The first disc contains the 100-minute feature film (and some extras) while the second contains the remaining five episodes (with more features):

Of Shadows and Skulls
Sweet Bee's Home
Horde Prime Takes a Holiday
The Stone in the Sword
The Price of Freedom

Pattern seekers would be hard pressed to find any sort of common theme between the 5 episodes as they vary greatly in terms of content, writers, and even place in the series order. About the only common ground shared is that they are all solid stories clearly enjoyed by fans.

I don't mean to sound like a broken record in this department (after all, I do say it in every single one of my reviews) but BCI Eclipse (Ink & Paint) has once again created a masterpiece collection in terms of presentation and extra features. Embossed cover art is spot on as is the interior slip-out quad-fold sleeve. Somehow BCI managed to gather up Lou Scheimer, Larry DiTillio, Gwen Wetzler, Alan Oppenheimer, and host Andy Mangles to do a full-length commentary over the Secret of the Sword (that's right folks, a full 100 minute audio commentary- sweet!)

In addition, disc 1 also contains some trivia/ fun facts, and a storyboard comparison (with sheet music) to the ""I Have the Power"" music video. Disc 2 packs in the extras as well with a brand new documentary feature with many of the show's creative forces, some more trivia/ fun facts, and the DVD ROM exclusive scripts for the 5 episodes that make up the best of She-Ra. As always, BCI includes 2 collectable 4 x 6"" She-Ra art cards this time from artists Brandon Peterson and Joe Chiodo.

Once again BCI proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it's undying attention to detail and commitment to fans of the series with this 2-disc collection. Even if you own the full season sets, the extra features (particularly the documentaries) make adding this special edition to your collection a must.",1209945600,,3899,4.632416787264834
2571855,5,B000FKO41G,I think it is great to see he-man and she-ra on the small screen again this is one of three movies released of he-man and she-ra on dvd (the motion picture of he-man and the chrismas special are the other two) she-ra has always been one of my favorites of the 1980's cartoon era the stories are told selfcontained. every episode is no different then the he-man episodes. she-ra fights hordac and his evil horde henchmen sometimes with the help of he-man. There are many many many rumors about a new he-man movie in the works and from what i have seen online it looks like those rumors are 90 percent true. but again those are just rumors if they are true lets hope she-ra is in the new movie.,1194739200,2,692,4.3307692307692305

I was a fan of He-man of course, but when I first saw She-ra I was amazed to see a women who was strong, smart ans beautiful all at the same time, being a boy I never thought a women could do things like He-man could,, and it changed my perspective on females. Anyone who loved the show as a child will enjoy this DVD. I encourge all She-Ra and He-Man fans to buy this DVD, you will not be dissapointed.",1165104000,4,607,4.1525423728813555

With that out of the way, let me tell you how much I enjoyed watching the movie Secret of the Sword again.  The film was even better than I remembered it from my youth.  The animation was better than all other previous He-Man and She-Ra attempts, and the story was very well written.  The commentary track on the DVD movie is a bit plodding at times.  I don't want to hear Lou Schimer talk about production values.  If I had one criticism, it would be that the Episodes DVD focuses too much on the crossover appeal of He-Man without letting She-Ra stand on it's own.  But, I suppose that's the whole point of the series.  Some of the episodes feel more like 22 minute commercials for the toys than a story, but I digress.  I reccomend this DVD if you're feeling a bit nostalgic.",1156291200,3,880,4.343558282208589

she-ra is one of the most underrated shows in the world of cartoons buy this you will not be dissapointed. their is suppose to be a new he-man movie in the works and in think she-ra is going to be in it. but this is ONLY a rumor i have seen things on web sites and chat rooms but nothing more.",1156032000,2,667,3.9776119402985075

2571940,5,B000FKO41G,"First of all this show is a classic sequel to ""He-Man and The Masters of the Universe"" and was sort of aimed at young ladies but boys watched it not only for appearences by He-Man and friends especially Skeletor or the cool bad guys like Hordak which appeared in the ""Masters of the Universe"" comics and action figures but the hot animated and well drawn chicks such as my first crush Adora, Frosta, Catra, Glimmer and such. This has the 1985 full length theatrical animated feature ""He-Man and She-Ra in Secret of the Sword"" which tells the story of the Sorceress whom senses that the long lost Eterian princess Adora is destined to have the power of greyskull just like He-Man, she assigns Prince Adam ( a.k.a. He-Man) and Cringer to Etheria which is in another dimension to find Adora who has a special destiny to become She-Ra yet she doesn't know it, the planet has been taken over by Skeletor's former teacher Hordak and his Horde minions like the goofy-voiced Mantena, the sexy Catra, the mystical Shadow Weaver, the brainless Grizzlor, the tough gal Scorpia, the energy sucking Leech and the silly little flying devil Imp. He plans on enslaving the entire population as there's a band of rebels lead by the courageous Bow and is assisted by the weird flying animal Kowl and the pink haired beauty Glimmer help He-Man/Adam to battle against Hordak as well as Skeletor.

The movie is a fantastic introduction and semi-pilot to ""She-Ra: Princess of Power"" with cool new characters, good animation and nice design especially plenty of action. The second disc has the five best episodes as chosen by fans which are ""Of Shadows and Skulls"" has Shadow Weaver so jealous of Hordak that she summons up Skeletor from Eternia to capture Hordak, ""Sweet Bee's Home"" has He-Man visiting She-Ra on her planet as he falls in love with an alien bee-like woman named Sweet Bee but the beautiful ice warrior Frosta gets jealous of him even though she has a big crush on him and Hordak plans on using Sweet-Bee's people as slaves, next ""Horde Prime Takes a Holiday"" has the dark overlord Horde Prime taking a vacation and having Hordak to be responsible to take care of his spaceship while he's away, until Skeletor shows up as he wants to take over the ship for his purposes as only She-Ra and He-Man must stop them. ""The Stone in The Sword"" has Adora who can't change into She-Ra because the stone in her sword has been cracked and must go through special tasks in order to have the power restored and finally ""The Price of Freedom"" has He-Man comes to Eternia after the Sorceress has recieved a distress signal and there's villagers who have been saved from their burning homes and are trapped in a old mine that might crumble any time as only He-Man and She-Ra can save them.

This 2-Disc DVD set has quality picture and sound with cool extras like trailers, music videos, easter eggs, Scripts, and a featurette. If you liked 80's animated fantasy and He-Man, i recommend this! don't be shy guys, there's plenty of hot cartoon chicks here especially Adora, Frosta and Catra being the hottest babes on the show.",1155945600,4,3102,4.6899082568807335
2571941,5,B000FKO41G,"Finally, many fans of She-ra have been awaiting this release for some time. With Thundercats out, and He-man the original series about complete, She-ra was next up. As a huge He-man fan, and growing up with The He-man toys, She-ra was also a good cartoon, but I never seemed to catch when it was on. It seemed it was on saturdays whereas he-man was run weakday afternoons, so i missed much of she-ra. Now that I have the He-man DVD's, I thought I should look at the She-ra collection, at least see the episodes that crossed over. This set has the Cross over movie: The Secret of the Sword on disc one.  this episode lays the groundwork for the saga of She-ra and the history connecting He-man and She-ra, Adam and Adora as twins. I also forgot the tie in with Skeletor and Hordak. Skeletor was an Understudy of Hordak, Hard to believe, but its explained here.  So for this story alone, He-man Collectors must get this set.

Disc two contains 5 best of episodes , 1. Of Shadows and Skulls, 2.  Sweet bee's Home, 3.  Horde prime takes a holiday, 4. The stone in the sword, 5. The price of freedom.  These cartoon are packed with the same action as the he-man episodes and also have the great lesson at the end.  The best part is, that it revolves around a stong female character, but the resemblence to Barbie (another Matel product) of She-ra was the plot to lure in the Girl market. Unfortunately, She never rose to the sucess of the He-man line, and it the character was developed in the later part of the sucess of the He-man line of toys.  I am glad I get a chance now to see these cartoons. And best part, they are affordable.  I am looking forward to seeing at some point the 93 episodes available. Also check out the He-man, the final 33 of 132 will be out begining of september, can we hope for the release of ""the new adventures of HE-man as well? 64 episodes there as well.

The picture and sound is clear and in all dvd splendor wonderful! (for those of us who have been watching old VHS taped off of the television or poorly burned dvds from these VHS tapes- your going to LOVE this dvd).

The 5 episodes included characters such as Glimmer, Bow, Mermista, Frosta, Sweet Bea, Hordac, Cat-ra, Skeletor & Shadow weaver(from He-man series)and some other vilians-Angellica is in the movie (disc 1) as well as He-man and She-ra's family and roots back in Etheria (He-man's home planet).  3 of the 5 episodes include He-man and She-ra working together- which is great- and shows that fans loved the brother and sister duo working together to fight the evils of Etheria.

On the second disc there is also a commentary (approx 20-30 mins) by the creaters and writers of He-man and She-ra. It's great to hear them talk about the characters and the development of the show.

Any 80s child or fan of the 1980s cartoons will love this edition and should make it a part of their collection. It's well worth the price and great to own. Don't wait for the whole season to come out- the bonus features are worth investing in this dvd.",1153872000,7,1290,4.615720524017467

This is also, in my opinion, American TV animation at its best.

Filmation did not outsource like everyone else; which is why this series has such a unique comic book/barbaric-gothic style that hasn't been replicated. (are there even any non-disney TV American animation studios anymore?).

And that transformation! She-ra was a magical girl before half of those maho-shoujo animes ever hit the scene!

However, since the boxed sets are on their way and those will be the first 5 epsiodes that are included the lapse is entirely forgivable and I suppose if they had to shove Secret of the Sword Lite somewhere the best-of disc compendium is probably a good place for it since people would be unlikely to buy a stand-alone version and there might not be sufficient space on the upcoming box set release.  However, everything else is perfect.  They've included all three versions of the ""I Have The Power"" music video (Sing-A-Long, Extended, and Spanish), two trailers for Secret of the Sword's theatrical release, and some very nice interviews with the Scheimers (Lou & Erika) and many others involved in the project including Babylon 5's J.

I did notice on the second disk there is a bit of a mix up in the chapters section between Sweet Bee's Home and Horde Prime Takes a Holiday. The chapters have been reversed and it is a bit strange. The transfer isn't pristine, but for cartoons 20 years old they look nice. The sound is a bit low and there are no subtitles or closed captioning which disappinted me.

2571972,5,B000FKO41G,"The `girl' spin off of He-man was always so much more than a thinly disguised vehicle to sell toys to myself and other impressionable young girls. Debuting in the full length 1984 animated movie, He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword, the She-Ra series also dared to pose tough questions about ethics and politics--to its predominantly child audience.

Adora is Prince Adam's twin sister however, she was kidnapped at birth and taken to the planet Etheria by a very evil warlord known as Hordak--a partner of Skeletor's, who works for the Horde Prime.

Adora then actually worked for Hordak for a while, conveniently unaware of her true identity and ensuring obligations. However, timely intervention by her brother subsequently sets Adora on the right path---and her horse Spirit can then transform into the Unicorn Swift-Wind.

It's therefore fitting to note that her brother (and his own superhero alter-ego) makes `special guest appearances' throughout several of the episodes which were selected for inclusion on this DVD release. I do want to emphasize though how and why She-Ra is special in its own right, and not just a `girl copy' of an earlier series.

Unlike Adam, Adora is confident, and athletic, this girl readily takes care of herself even when not a `superhero'--and Spirit is also very confident.

It's a good thing too, because ""The stone in the sword"" shows Adora's adventures to get her sword repaired when the jewel ultimately responsible for transforming her into She-Ra becomes cracked. Apparently this subsequent repair job does such a good job because another need for a jewel replacement never comes up again---which you think it possibly could considering all of the `battles' which this character actually has.

I think this series readily transcends `children's fare' because it repeatedly touches on themes of seeking redemption for one's past crimes committed against humanity. Whomever she is, Adora knows what she was personally responsible for in the past, and essentially is now trying to make amends--by working with `the rebellion' a grassroots movement of people who are trying to end the reign of terror which is being inflicted upon them by an oppressive regime. This plot device would somewhat foreshadow Xena, another `warrior princess'.

Another ethical issue arose in ""The price of freedom"". After believing she had saved people from being burnt up in their villages, She-Ra realizes another danger is present. The survivors are now trapped in a mine which could collapse at any second. This episode importantly acknowledges `superheroes' as imperfect beings--Adora is learning that despite her best efforts to do good in the world as She-Ra, she is going to make honest mistakes which inadvertently place innocent people in dangerous situations.

I shudder to think how this still-holds-up series would have been violated (ala He-Man) if a live action movie actually had been made. I'm thinking that the memories of one of my favorite childhood heroines would have been trashed. It ultimately was for the best that we just have the cartoon then.

Women and their powers figure prominently throughout the cartoon, but Bow, the local magic archer is around to provide good advice. Completely egalitarian, he does not assume these women around him are `defenseless', `helpless' or `weak' overthrowing Hordak and his thugs requires everybody's active involvement.

Other pivotal characters include Queen Angela and her daughter princess Glimmer.  Again breaking archetypes, this royalty repeatedly demonstrate themselves just as cable of pitching in against the Horde--they are after all deposed monarchs! However, it's important to clarify they had been taken out of power because of the Horde Prime's actions and not because they were personally mean people to their subjects.

The critical dichotomy of good and bad rulers is further reinforced with the characters of Castaspella, Mermista, and Frosta. These rulers actually are in power of their respective domains--but recognize the inherent danger the Horde Prime poses to freedom, justice and fairness for all. They also have really cool super powers of their own--Having grown up in Colorado, I thought Frosta's powers over cold were the most interesting, but that Castaspella had the better outfit--also because I am a brunette. Mermista was okay, but her ability to grow/ungrow legs for land travel just did not do anything for me.

She-ra's main villain in this series actually is not her `old boss' but Catra--the self-described jealous beauty who actually has an ability to transform herself into a cat-and who also works for the Horde. If She-ra/Adora represents the `good' side of powerful women, Catra represents the corrupted and shallow. Catra certainly is capable of holding her own in a fight, but a preoccupation with looks and vanity clarifies her as `evil'. Good women do not only think of themselves.

Magic obviously features more prominently throughout She-Ra's world. It is clarified though that because she is bad, Shadow Weaver's power only comes through Hordak--and the Horde Prime's approval of using her powers for whatever they say (such as making people deceptively `pass' for others so they provide false and even dangerously misleading information in ""Sweet Bee's Home""). Unlike Madame Razz (who works with the Rebellion--and is one of the keepers of Adora's secret identity), Shadow Weaver's `independent woman' personality actually is a faade and she can be punished for failure to effectively carry out orders as expected. Furthermore, unlike the women of the Rebellion--who can turn to their colleagues without an ever-lurking fear of betrayal--Shadow Weaver has no true friends.

""Of Shadows and Skulls"" is the episode which stands out the most because of how it's `workplace ethics' issues continue being applicable to me and other adults who grew up watching this series. Shadow Weaver enters into a temporary alliance with Skeletor to overthrow Hordak--but then gets trapped by Skeletor himself--who obviously did not want to share power with her even if they had been able to pull off that scenario as was planned.

However, writers aiming for consistency would have then had Shadow Weaver recognize that the Horde Prime is an employer not worth sticking around with---and also had her join the same Rebellion which she formerly had been working to quell. After experiencing such an intra-organization betrayal, this `powerful' sorceress instead stayed on, and the conflict apparently was swept under the rug.

Another power struggle occurs between Skeletor and Hordak in ""Horde Prime Takes a Holiday"" Hordak is temporarily left in charge of a ship called `The Velvet Glove', making Skeletor jealous largely because he just sees another opportunity for increased power and control over others. Although it involves another cross-over, this episode is comparatively very weak because if Skeletor has become so preoccupied with securing resources on Etheria, how will he successfully then conquer Eternia?---still a `free' planet.  Plus, you would figure that Skeletor already has an arsenal of his own and one more battle vehicle really won't make a difference.

Extras include a documentary, feature-length audio commentary, a music video, storyboard spreads, DVD-ROM scripts, ""She-Ra"" trivia, hidden Easter eggs, and two collectible comic book art cards.

I know this will come off as nitpicking to some people considering that any DVD material of She-Ra is at long last finally released, but we need whole entire seasons available. I understand that somebody probably did put time and care into selecting the released episodes, but it had a 1985-1986 season 93 episode run and the package comes bundled with the aforementioned extras.",1153180800,11,7778,5.318403908794788
2571973,5,B000FKO41G,"I also grew up with this cartoon I was She-Ra obssessed and have been for the last 20 years. This cartoon along with He-Man and other Filmation Characters were great  cartoons with simple stories that had a moral lesson simple for kids to understand. Cartoons nowadays are crapy and unsatisfying.

Finally I can survive another 20 years with She-Ra on DVD, with DVD's I will be able to show my kids (when I have some) what great cartoons were made of.

SHe-Ra is the best heroine and great role model for girls. Do you realize that there are no heroines in action movies or cartoons today?!

I had most of the action figures from She-Ra, also I had a gift set of an umbrella with the Sword of Protection shape, purse and coin holder that I loved so much.

I had Swift Wind / Spirit and Silver Storm, never had the Crystal Castle but a friend did.

I loved She-Ra and now I won't have to fear that my old VHS tape with The Secret of the Sword will fall apart.

Long live She-Ra, Princess of Power!!!

This is a great classical treasure worth buying.",1152921600,6,1048,4.338461538461538
