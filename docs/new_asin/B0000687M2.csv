It was slow and monotonous and worked heavily with eery music, storming wind, ghostly like wind and taps on window and the curse word f...to add color to the story along with 1 sensuous scene and 1 argumentative scene. Also what fell short was the magic book. No one ever verbally said what it exactly did. You could only infer by observation something similar to when reading a book. I could only infer that the book gave ppl second chances to do the right thing by having similar situations that they failed in to come upon them again and brings those individuals back into their lives who either they failed or failed them. Still a very weird story bc not explained either the euphoric feeling they got when holding the book.",1468454400,,792,4.468965517241379

7964008,3,B0000687M2,"This made-for-TV-quality movie (but with strong language, oddly) was all over the place. Comedy? Drama? Thriller? Romance? The music seemed out of place, and I have no idea what the magic book had to do with anything. But, I watched/listened while I sorted papers. There were some interesting ideas and characters presented, although not all were developed fully. I can usually glean something from anything.",1419638400,,408,5.292307692307692

7964010,4,B0000687M2,"""Read You Like a Book"" is a highly original gem of a fable with many surprising facets.  Come to it without expectations, then relax and let it happen to you, remembering only that, in a bookstore, anything can occur between the covers of books and behind the book shelves as well. I was charmed by this amusing, mysterious, thought-provoking tale and by its delightful characters who are, each in their own way, captivated by the power of books.",1217548800,,446,4.717948717948718
7964011,4,B0000687M2,"If you're a bibliophile, you will appreciate this movie for the sheer fact that it is centred in a bookstore and revolves around a host of characters, most of whom are booklovers. That being said, the plot does unravel very slowly, and gets a tad tedious at times, yet the cast of characters succeed in working their magic on the viewer, drawing one into the story and engaging one's interest.

The story centers around Black Oaks Bookstore [filmed in  the real bookstore of the same name based in Berkeley] manager Dante [Tony Amendola] who seems happy being amongst books, and finds himself inadvertently coming into the possession of a book titled The Illustrated Book of Failure [the seller, a mysterious character played by Danny Glover disappears soon after giving the book to Dante]. Dante finds himself strangely affected by the book and promptly files it under Esoteric books. He tries to get his co-worker Kate [Karen Black] interested in it, but with so many other things happening, Kate only gets to see the book much later.

There are other characters in the story - Norman [Ricardo Gil] and Marcia [Shaun Landry] who work in the store, regular customers Gina [Catalina Larranaga] who is 'unlucky in love' and an older man named Benny. There are also some fine performances by other minor characters such as Zoe [Barbara Crampton] who chooses the bookstore as the venue for her tryst with a lover, not knowing that her ex-lover Dante is working there.

The story truly takes off when a doctor and his young daughter come into the bookstore. The doctor is a whistleblower and is being hunted by a pair of goons working for a pharmaceutical company - he chooses to hide some incriminating evidence in a particular book and the rest of the story deals with what happens to him and the other characters as they find the mysterious Book of Failures exercising some strange magic on them and their actions - giving some a chance to redeem past failures.

Though it does take some time for the story to gain momentum, it is an engaging watch. The whole movie is set in the bookstore where the main action takes place, and though that may seem a bit claustrophobic, it actually works here - and this is a huge bookstore with many nooks and crannies. Being a booklover myself, I truly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to those who not only love books, but who enjoy movies that unfold slowly, focusing on character development and not so much on action. The rating here is Unrated, and there are some sexual scenes and minimal profanity. Final verdict: an interesting and engaging indie flick!",1214870400,4,2606,4.756637168141593
