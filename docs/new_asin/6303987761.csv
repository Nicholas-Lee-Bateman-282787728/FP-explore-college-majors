763499,3,6303987761,"Drums in the Deep South, 1951 film

This story is set in 1861 Georgia. There is news about the cotton market; the economy of the South is built on it. There is a storm coming up. The militia has been called up. Two men will come for a visit. They are in shipping in New Orleans, sending cotton to England. One man has bought back his father's lands and will be a neighbor. The men talk about business. Thunder and lightning accompany the news of war! The years pass to 1864. Major Clayburn is selected for a mission. General Sherman's army is headed for Atlanta, they must be stopped by 20 men and 4 guns who will blast the railroad from a mountain top. Volunteers are selected. The local guide can't help them. They pass through the Union lines at night to arrive at Devil's Mountain. Their horses will be sent back to General Johnston.

The soldiers explore the limestone caves to find a way to the top. There are hidden pitfalls. Men pull the guns uphill. Clayburn goes to the mansion. Yankee troops are setting a trap for Kathy's husband. The guns and ammunition must be lifted by ropes. A fall means death. Kathy finds a missing man. She later learns about the repairs to the railroad. Can she send a signal? Uncle Albert intervenes, so too the Yankee sergeant. The troops on the mountain top prepare their guns to shoot at the trains. They hit the locomotive! Will this stop General Sherman's advance? Union troops are sent to attack through the caves. A 15-inch naval gun will be used to blast the mountain top defense; it can out-shoot the enemy's 12-inch guns. Can Kathy warn the Confederate troops? What about that piano wire? ""Start loading."" The Union gun opens fire to hit the top. The Confederate's reinforced gun hits the train.

They get bad news about a raid on Sherman's guns. But an officer proposes using spare gunpowder to destroy Devil's Mountain from the inside! They learn about the missing piano wire. Kathy wants to warn the troops so they can surrender. Will this work? The fuse is lit, there is an explosion that destroys the mountain top. This is a victory.

In actual history General Sherman's troops advanced without a supply line and lived off the land until they conquered Atlanta, then continued to Charleston South Carolina. This victory helped to reelect Lincoln. Sherman was considered the best strategist of the Civil War by Liddell-Hart. Sherman copied Hannibal's tactics against the Roman army. Two parallel columns, one of which could encircle any enemy force, proved invincible and won battles.",1335657600,4,2536,4.730769230769231

763503,5,6303987761,There are amazingly few movies dealing with the Civil War that are not either soap operas (such as Gone With the Wind) or just Westerns with Southern and Northern characters (such as Escape From Fort Bravo).  Drums in the Deep South is one of a few movies about the Civil War (along with The Red Badge of Courage for example) that actually have battle scenes that take place in the South (rather than out West).,1230854400,14,411,4.48
763504,1,6303987761,"This DVD is of a very poor quality, looks like reel to reel copy, similar to a home copy. Guy Madison is listed as apparently the main actor, whereas in reality, he is fourth or fifth down the line. I complained of this to your company at the time of viewing, but heard nothing at all, not even a courtesy reply. Hense, after generally good service, as your company did not fulfil what I think is good business, I have not purchased anything since. Not much to your company, but still fair expenditure in the past from my end. A pity, but unless things chance, that is the situation.",1162425600,3,583,4.3577981651376145
763505,1,6303987761,"Although he designed and directed a number of notable films, today William Cameron Menzies is best recalled as the director of the ""so bad it's good"" 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS. His work with the 1951 DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH might be considered a build up to that ham-fisted style, for it has the same flatness. Sad to say, it has none of the same fun.

The story concerns a Confederate effort to thwart Sherman's advance on Atlanta. Strange to say, however, Georgia seems to have been transplanted to the wild west for purposes of the film, which comes complete with a mesa on which the Confederates desire to plant their cannon and fire upon the railroad below. Throw in a love triangle and some of the most uninspired acting you can obtain and you have DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH.

Today the film is best recalled for the presence of actress Barbara Payton (1927-1967), a performer who trembled on the brink of stardom in the late 1940s and early 1950s before she self-destructed in a hog-wallow of sex, booze, drugs, and front page scandal. It is easy to see what the fuss was about: she has a dead-pan sexuality, larger-than-life beauty, and memorable speaking voice. Unfortunately, none of these qualities have much to do with either film or role, and even her cult-status can't make up for what is basically a remarkably shallow, incredibly silly, and deadly dull film.

Unless you are desperate to see what Payton looked like on the screen before she ended up as a five dollar hooker working the Sunset Strip, DRUMS ALONG THE DEEP SOUTH is a film to avoid at all costs. Treat it as you would the plague.

763506,3,6303987761,"Director William Cameron Menzies, set designer for ""Gone with the Wind"" and the original ""Invaders from Mars"" (1953, which he also directed), keeps this modest Civil War story moving along nicely and with sufficient human-interest details.  Guy Madison (TV's ""Wild Bill Hickock"") and James Craig are close friends who end up on the North and South sides, respectively, and who, not surprisingly, must fight one another in the movie's final reels, though they do so out of sight to one another.  Come to think of it, we only see them together some two or three minutes at the start of this reasonably exciting B-epic that belies its budget, courtesy of Menzie's set designs, in spite of harsh early-fifties color and a less than liberal budget.  Nothing profound, but this notable picture does convey some of the tragedy of friends and loved ones torn apart by the most horribly personal war in our history.",978739200,29,906,4.908496732026144

764108,4,6303987761,"There is a lot to like about DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH, which might best be described as GONE WITH THE WIND light, since the director and production designer on the 1951 release is William Cameron Menzies, who won a special Oscar for the 1939 classic.  Aside from the rich look that Menzies gives the film, there is a memorable score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the basic story by Hollister Noble is rather compelling.  In fact, in order to evoke memories of GWTW, the King Brothers, who produced DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH, even cast James Craig, who was the poor mans Clark Gable when he was under contract at MGM, in the leading role.

Craig plays a major in the Confederate Army, assigned to stop supplies getting to General Sherman of the Union Army via rail.  He and twenty men set their cannons atop an almost inaccessible mountain peak in Georgia that overlooks the railroad and successfully set about to bombard and stop the Yanks from getting their needed ammunition.  Guy Madison, a close friend of Craigs before the war, is the Union officer assigned to stop him.

Spying for Craig is Barbara Payton, the wife of a Southern plantation owner (Craig Stevens), but really in love with the Confederate major.  (Anybody familiar with Hollywood history, particularly its sordid scandals, will recognize that this subplot mirrors what was going on in Ms. Paytons personal life at the time.)

Sadly, Menzies was a better art director than he was a director of actors.  The performances, as well as the screenplay by Philip Yordan, are merely adequate.  With a larger budget, another director and a more charismatic cast, this movie could have been quite special, rather than a mildly entertaining action drama.

VCI Entertainment has done a remarkable restoration job on DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH and, although the color hues do not have the richness of Technicolor, the movie looks better than it has in any other home video release.

The story of how a hand full of heroes who blocked Sherman's march to the sea. Two friends from West Point find themselves on opposite sides in the war. The conflicts are not as cut and dry, as it would appear as two things come to mind while watching this movie. One is the basic conflict between friendship and loyalty to a cause; many times this is mistaken resulting in the balance of power changing. The second is a little more superficial but just as intriguing; both sides in the conflict must come up with ways to out gun the other side by using technology outside of its intended purpose. The use of a navel gun on a rail car is one. You will have to watch the movie to see the solution to extending the range of the smaller cannon. Other conditions call for more radical action.

Does the mission succeed and is it worth the price paid on both sides?

I can say the movie is worth the price of repeated viewing.
