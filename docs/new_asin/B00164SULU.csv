8260854,5,B00164SULU,Love the Movie but the DVD had problems at the beginning. Was not recorded right had the picture break down and squares show up at beginning of movie. Once past that it was ok. Great movie otherwise.,1381795200,,199,4.405405405405405
8260855,5,B00164SULU,I liked the actress who played Azumi and the action story that went with this episode......as ridiculously as it may seem for a woman to be this good a swordsman!,1377216000,,162,4.433333333333334

8260857,5,B00164SULU,These are my favorite movies of all time. I have even bought the posters a sword replica and photo books and costume from the movies for a full movie display in my room. Ueto Aya is stunningly beautiful in this and a great lead for both the movies. If you love samurai or ninja movies or just Ueto Aya this is a must see.,1294704000,,321,4.03125
8260858,5,B00164SULU,"Excellent action. A must see in my opinion. Lead character is amazingly beautiful as the heroine, and deadly with the sword. I was very glad to add this to my collection.",1247443200,2,170,4.516129032258065
