898485,5,6304565054,tHIS MOVIE WHILE VERY SAD AND EMOTIONAL IS SUPER SUPERB.  MARIO LOPEZ IS PERFECT AT EVERY GIVEN MOMENT IN EVER FRAME.  YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE YOU ARE WATCHING GREGG NOT MARIO.  MR.  LOPEZ IS AN UDERATED ACTOR - SAW HIM IN A CHORUS LINE AND HE STOLE THE SHOW.  HE HAS THE RARE ABIITY NOT TO BE MARIO LOPEZ - BUT- TO BE THE PERSON HE IS PLAYING.  GREAT GREAT GREAT.,1219276800,,361,4.085714285714285
898486,5,6304565054,"Definately a 5 star. To this day still a masterpiece in my mind. As others have written this is so well written and acted on all fronts. All the parts were right on the money.
If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend it. I saw it back when it first aired on USA network. A very powerful movie and hitting very close to home for me. It ended up being a turning point in my life.
It's so nice that our community has a piece of media like this that fairly depicts Gay life in the USA. Unfortunately we have not progressed very much since this film was made. But I have high hopes.
I hope it is watched with an open heart and mind.
Peace all.",1211068800,3,647,4.023255813953488
898487,4,6304565054,"The film was very well done with great casting. One could easily believe that Mario Lopez really was Greg Louganis; Mario did an excellent job. The photography, with cleverly interwoven footage of the real Olympics, was excellent.

The film does not have an astounding plot filled with either mystery, suspense, romance or intrigue, but that's because it is I believe an accurate recording of a real life and real lives never reach the pinnacle of Hollywood standards.

But it's an overall good film with some valuable life lessons for young men, straight and gay alike. At this point in time it may be a little ""dated"", but some things never change. Young men today are just as naive and vulnerable as Greg was and just as willing to take dangerous risks which could ruin their futures. Feeling that they are immortal; thinking that they will never get sick and never grow old; thinking that THEY are in control, they make disastrous decisions which impact on the rest of their lives.

The film was tastefully done with no ""in your face"" sexuality. It does not promote the gay lifestyle at all but simply exposes how much more difficult it is for gay man to succeed than for a straight man, having to expend a lot of valuable energy simply on covering up and hiding and leading a double life.

It's sad that so many talented young people have to stay in the shadows for fear of exposure because society at large does not want anyone to know that a ""gentle-man"" can be strong, courageous and honorable and can equal or exceed the limits of a straight man. Fortunately, Greg Louganis was not one of the hiders and had the courage to ""come out"" and make life just a little easier for others.",1173744000,8,1689,4.601328903654485
898488,5,6304565054,"This was a very sad story with both tears and joy.  Greg's youth was not what I would call perfect, but he made it through.  Mario Lopez's portrayal of the famous Olympian was superb!  He needs to be recognized for the excellent actor that he is.  If I could have given it 10 stars, I would have.",1162684800,12,296,4.140350877192983

898490,5,6304565054,"While Mario Lopez and his fellow actors all do a wonderful job, the other ""behind-the scenes"" folks all excell as well.  This is an extremely sensitive, well written, well produced, well directed piece, absolutely 1st class from the 1st note of perfect music to the last fade-out.  W-A-Y too good for TV.  One of those ""gems"" which should have found release in theatres!",1128902400,12,370,4.841269841269841

898605,5,6304565054,"Just got back from 4 days in San Francisco to celebrate a birthday and 27 years with my partner. Visited the new GLBT History Museum and realized even more than I had imagined how important it is to have both the ""hard data"" kinds of entries to our collective history and the pieces of creative expression that put flesh and bood on the data and tell the human story. This movie does the latter in a beautiful and moving way. I'm glad I have a copy.",1301788800,,449,4.232558139534884
