8414668,4,B0043CT8SG,"Ive purchased 8 of these play along DVDs and the last four at same time so each is going to have the same review and rating. I had previously rated my first purchase five stars but after reviewing each DVD and agreeing with some other reviews I feel 4 stars is more appropriate. In my opinion Hal Leonard is the best when it comes to publication of Guitar learning and TAB song books for beginners and rare that Ill consider rating anything less than 4 Stars. My guitar status is beginner with approx 14 months of player experience so my review is from that perspective. In General some great songs are on the DVD but its unlikely anyone with less than 3 years of practice will be able to just start playing many of the songs on DVDs considered in this review. The intermediate, experience player will definitely be better served than the beginner. All Im sure will agree that it would have been very helpful if the DVD had included a PDF file of the displayed tab used during the instructional videos. Also a separate track of just the guitar without additional sounds would have been nice. What is demonstrated is done well but some terminology used goes beyond most beginners. I haven't considered returning any and hope that periodic revisits will eventually result in mastering some of these songs. After viewing these DVDs Ive acquired a higher appreciation for the artist that perform the songs and it blows me away to think maybe someday. Reasonably priced so if you're a beginner don't be afraid to give one a try.",1514592000,,1523,4.623616236162362
8414669,5,B0043CT8SG,"A very good instructional DVD.  The lessons on ""Little Sister"" and ""Hound Dog"" are the highlights.  The other six songs lack the dynamics of the two aforementioned songs and thus may be a little disappointing for some.  The real time display of the sheet music in tab form  during the visual display of the instructor playing the songs is a very good idea.",1470960000,,356,4.603174603174603
8414670,3,B0043CT8SG,"The DVD does everything that it advertises, but the lessons are very short (maybe about 2 minutes for each song). If you have a lot of experience playing guitar, then you may like the quick lessons and then watching him play the song. For the beginning player, though, it's not very helpful. For example, he explains in the lesson that Scottie Moore uses a pentatonic scale when soloing in Jailhouse Rock, and then shows you how to play the pentatonic scale. Yet, he doesn't really show you step-by-step how to tear through the solo the way Scottie does. It's hard to learn and develop technique this way. I recommend for beginners ""Getting Started on Electric Guitar"" the Fender DVD with Keith Wyatt.",1317686400,4,701,4.754098360655738
