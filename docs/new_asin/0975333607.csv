8421021,5,0975333607,"I was never really religious before but after seeing ""Joshua and the promised land"" I realized that there is a god. I go to church every Sunday and praise the lord for my restored faith in religion. ""Joshua and the promised land"" has truly changed my life for the better. Every night I  watch ""Joshua and the promised land"" for it gives me religious dreams. I can talk to god in them. I'd highly recommend you check out ""Joshua and the promised land"" because it will truly prove there is a god. My family is worried about me because I talk about ""Joshua and the promised land"" all the time. Every time I'm with them I only speak in quotes from ""Joshua and the promised land"" I printed out all the pictures on the walls of a house in ""Joshua and the promise land"" and put them on my walls. My family went missing and ""Joshua and the promised land"" is all I have",1520208000,5,860,4.2439024390243905

8421023,1,0975333607,"I found this posted on youtube because someone had the sense to buy it from ebay and post it. Pathetic acting, high school level animation, and horrifically ugly character models completely wash over the fact that this is a biblical piece. The message of faith is that over all, genocide is okay if you believe god is on your side. I'm not joking. The main character's moral conflict is whether or not to murder everyone in Jericho. Spoilers: Everyone dies. They depict the citizens of Jericho as red skinned, horned furries who kill babies. It makes the idea of divine justice laughable and makes it seem like any one who kills because God told them to is doing the right thing. I understand that the book of Exodus was not nice. I understand why the characters in Exodus did what they did. But this movie makes a mockery of it. 1/5 as a purchase, 10/10 for making me post this.",1396915200,11,879,4.5
