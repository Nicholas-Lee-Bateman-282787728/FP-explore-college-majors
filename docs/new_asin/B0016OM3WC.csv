3162314,5,B0016OM3WC,"The Fifth and Final Season of The Batman is more of a team-up season. Batgirl and Commissioner Gordon only show up in cameos this season & Firefly becomes Phosphorus. The Joining, who was in the fourth seasons' finale, makes a return in this seasons' finale(which is over 40 minutes long). Batman teams up with the likes of Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkman, Green Arrow, Martian Manhunter &, in the season finale, the entire Justice League. He squares off against the likes of Lex Luthor, Metallo, Mercy Graves, Count Vertigo, Wrath, Toyman, Sinestro, Shadow Thief, Mirror Master and the Terrible Trio. Vocal talents were provided by Rino Romano, Evan Sabara, Danielle Judovits,  Alastair Duncan,  Mitch Pileggi,  Dorian Harewood, Dermot Mulroney, Robert Patrick, Chris Hardwick, Charlie Schlatter and George Newbern. It's a shame that this season is the shows' last. With every season bought, I got to liking it more and more. This season is, perhaps, the best out of them all. I suggest you collect them all while the getting is good.

Meanwhile, next year-look for a new Batman animated series to debut on Cartoon Network called Batman: The Brave & The Bold. It will see Batman team-up with several other DC Comics heroes during the season such as Aquaman, Blue Beetle, Green Arrow, Red Tornado and Plastic Man(just to name a few). The series is being produced by Ben Jones, Brandon Vietti and Michael Chang.",1215648000,4,1422,5.012711864406779
3162315,5,B0016OM3WC,"Seriously, who would have even begun to think that this serious would really last this long? I didn't believe it would, because I wouuld be what you call a Batman: The Animated Series fanatics. I grew up with that Batman series and I was sure that BTAS would be the pinnacle of Batman in animation. I was wrong though, this series was totally different from the original and in some respects this series was even better than it's predecessor.

Now the real shame is that The Batman has figuratively and literally ridden off into the sunset. The cast, producers, directors, animators, etc should all be proud of what they accomplished considering that they had to constantly be compared to very heavily favored Bruce Timm Paul Dini spawn. This show in my opinion will be sorely missed considering that superhero cartoons now are at a premium with that Chaotic and coutnless others that kids really now.

The series really grew into it's own at around the midpoint of season two and it was magic from there. The first season was very mediocre and then it seemed to just flourish with the animation and the writing, the voices were spot on. Rino Romano wasn't that great in the beginning but he really took to a whole new level all the other seasons. You could safely say that Rino Romano and Kevin Conroy in different respects are the voices of Batman.

The fifth season was the best and you would be making a grand disservice to yourself if you don't pick up a copy of this season and enjoy something that was really special.",1215561600,2,1524,4.6162361623616235
3162316,4,B0016OM3WC,"It's not easy following in the footsteps and compared, usually unfavorably, with a series as revered as Batman TAS. From a fan's point of view, and the creators would concur, it's best to judge every endeavor on its own merits. In the case of The Batman this should be doable due to the passage of time and the fact we are evaluating different products. The first observation is The Batman is targeted at a younger audience, which is not only worth considering but one that makes it difficult for adults to critique, since this was not designed with us in mind. However comparisons can provide a framework with a few similar and eye opening. The focus on Robin and Batgirl was reminiscent of BTAS's last, lighter and arguably best season, and may have been a precursor for this incarnation. Another similarity is the exceptional animation and consistency. The emphasis of season 5 is guest stars, noticeably Superman, Hawkman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Green Arrow. This spotlighting of the DCU's best was their way of going out with all guns blazing. The series bowed out exhibiting many of the strengths and weaknesses it debuted with, but fortunately for its fans its final account is balanced on the plus side. Living in the shadows of an iconic cartoon is not easy. BTAS had a stellar run but its time had come. The Batman is a different animal whose time has also come, but for what is was it succeeded. We now have Brave and the Bold on the horizon which supposedly will be aimed at a younger audience. As with The Batman I will maintain an open mind and look forward to its debut next spring.",1215388800,3,1600,4.637323943661972
3162317,4,B0016OM3WC,"The Dark Knight welcomes the Justice League to Gotham City in ""The Batman: The Complete Fifth Season"". As the mysterious crime fighter Batman, young industrialist Bruce Wayne has dedicated his life to protect Gotham City from such dangerous rogues like Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Catwoman and Mr. Freeze, but now he must test his courage and skills along side Earth's greatest superheroes. In this action-packed season, Batman joins the Justice League and teams up with Superman, Green Arrow, the Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman and Martian Manhunter against such villains like Lex Luthor, Mirror Master, Count Vertigo and more. ""The Batman"" is the Emmy Award-winning animated series based on the DC Comic hero created by artists Bob Kane and Bill Finger. The animated series maintains faithful to the comic books. The animation style and character designs are certainly different than previous television shows. The fifth and final season offers plenty of amusement and features guest voice stars like George Newbern, Dana Delany, Louise Gossett Jr., John Larroquette, Dermot Mulroney, Miguel Ferrer and Robert Patrick.

""The Batman: The Complete Fifth Season"" offers a great DVD presentation at an affordable retail price. All 13 action-packed episodes of the final season are presented in their original full screen broadcast format. Like the previous season sets, the picture quality is really good and its 2.0 Dolby Digital sound certainly gets the job done. Its only special features are ""Joining Forces: The Batman's Legendary Team-Ups"" (9 minutes) and ""The Batman: Justice League Profiles"" (12 minutes) featurettes and trailers of other Warner Brother DVD releases and ""Speed Racer"" video game. Despite the lack of solid bonus features, ""The Batman: The Complete Fifth Season"" earns a ""B"".",1215129600,10,1793,5.4496402877697845
3162318,5,B0016OM3WC,"Okay, Season 3 was good and Season 4 was even better. Now here come thirteen more episodes. If you like your Batman integrated into the wider DC superhero universe, then Season 5 will be hog heaven (but don't get it twisted; THE BATMAN is not at all placed in the same continuity as the shows in Bruce Timm's DC Animated Universe). This fifth season finds a darknight detective even more amenable to teamwork, although that's not to say he's all of a sudden the life of the party. Dude still broods muchly and cloaks himself in mystery and intimidation; that's just how he rolls. But, continuing the trend begun in Season 4, Season 5 showcases members of the Justice League. The two episode arc ""The Batman/Superman Story"" kicks it off by teaming up the World's Finest, Batman and Superman, in a nifty story featuring a whole gang of supervillains and the Bat going up against the Man of Steel. I guess it's appropriate that the season (and the series) would close with the two-part ""Lost Heroes,"" a big-scale Justice League adventure.

Superhero cartoon shows don't get a lot of run nowadays, do they? THE LEGION OF SUPER-HEROES animated series just got the axe. And, yes, horribly, this is the last season in THE BATMAN series, so all the more reason to enjoy this one. The best part is Batman and Robin teaming up with various of the Justice League. Robin's awed reactions to meeting these other heroes are priceless. One downside to so many spotlights on the JLA is that less time is given to the Bat family. I miss Batgirl and her sarcasm; here, she's relegated to less face time. We do learn that time hasn't been standing still for Barbara Gordon as she's now old enough to attend college (""Attack of the Terrible Trio""). Speaking of the Bat fam, there's a sighting of Nightwing; unfortunately, he's a character in an Internet game (""The Metal Face of Comedy""). The good news is that Bat Mite doesn't show up at all.

Regarding the storytelling and the visuals, I don't believe Season 5 to be better than the prior two seasons, which are very good. THE BATMAN was always intended for the younger set of kids, so the stories here aren't as dark or psychological or as thematically layered as those in, say, BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES. Should this season find more favor with the viewers, it'll be because of its glittering star power. And if the driving theme song reminds one a bit of Hawaii Five-O, well, that's not such a bad thing, is it?

I can't envision a future in which there isn't an ongoing Batman animated series. Hopefully, the powers that be can dust off Kevin Conroy to do what he does best.

In the meantime, here are the 13 episodes of Season 5 (note that, depending on the reader, the following might contain some minor plot SPOILERS):

- Episodes 1 & 2 - ""The Batman/Superman Story (Parts 1 & 2)"" - Fun two-parter as Superman and the Bat finally meet and fight a lot of super-villains. But then Luthor gets the upper hand.
- Episode 3 - ""Vertigo"" - Green Arrow comes to Gotham to investigate Wayne Labs, which is somehow linked to people suffering mysterious ailments.
- Episode 4 - ""White Heat"" - Firefly and his brainy girlfriend steal radioactive isotopes; the debut of Phosphorus; and, finally, a sighting of Batgirl this season.
- Episode 5 - ""A Mirror Darkly"" - Flash comes to Gotham to help Batman and Robin take down the Mirror Master. One of my favorite episodes.
- Episode 6 - ""Joker Express"" - Get on board the Cuckoo Choo Choo. An outbreak of ""giggle bandits"" sweeping Gotham could only mean the return of the Joker.
- Episode 7 - ""Ring Toss"" - With Sinestro taking Hal Jordan out of action, the Green Lantern power ring ends up in the clutches of the Penguin.
- Episode 8 - ""The Metal Face of Comedy"" - A Joker henchman's invention leads to the formation of a digital Clown Prince of Crime.
- Episode 9 - ""Attack of the Terrible Trio"" - Thanks to Dr. Kirk Langstrom's mutagens, three college outcasts mutate into beasts and proceed to get their revenge on those what done them wrong. Also, Batgirl's a college freshman.
- Episode 10 - ""The End of the Batman"" - Gotham's criminal element gets its own costumed champions: Wrath and Scorn, who seem to hold a personal grudge against the Dynamic Duo.
- Episode 11 - ""What Goes Up..."" - A gravity-defying episode as Black Mask escapes with the help of the Shadow Thief, and the pair goes after a Thanagarian meteorite. Can a certain winged Thanagarian lawman be too far behind?
- Episodes 12 & 13 - ""Lost Heroes"" (Parts 1 & 2)"" - Hugo Strange and the Joining return as, one by one, Justice League members begin to vanish until, finally, only the two least powerful heroes are left - Green Arrow and Batman.",1212883200,48,4690,4.571938168846611
3162319,5,B0016OM3WC,"In Season 4, the writing and art improved.
Also, the last scene of Season 4's final episode introduced the Justice League.
This season will see Batman interacting with both his own Gotham team (Robin and Batgirl), and the Justice League. Superman is added to the cast of characters too.
We can expect a great 13 episodes to wrap up the five season series.
Cover art looks terrific too.
The series has told back stories not covered in the equally addictive (Kevin Conroy voicing:) Batman cartoons of the 1990s. The gradual introduction of the Justice League as semi-regular supporting characters is a plot device in both The Batman Season 5 and Smallville Season 6.
Enjoy them both for comparison.
And Warner, how about throwing in the live 1997 Justice League pilot as an extra in future releases of DC shows. I'm surprised it never made to the Justice League DVDs, when they came out.",1212192000,5,885,4.790849673202614

3162348,3,B0016OM3WC,"The Batman--Complete Fifth Season (2007-2008) has little to recommend for its final season. The animation continues to be poor, and too many of the episodes feature characters from the Justice League or Superman shows. Perhaps this made it more popular with some viewers, but I am one of those who prefer Batman does not have guest stars. Green Arrow appears in Vertigo with his origin story, and he appears in Lost Heroes, parts I & II. Superman appears in the two part Batman/Superman Story, and in the Lost Heroes to parter. Hawkman is in the What Goes Up episode, The Flash in A Mirror Darkly, Green lantern in Ring Toss, Martian Manhunter in Lost Heroes, and so forth.
  Of the episodes in this set, those I liked include White Heat. Here Batgirl has a large role in trying to contain the heat Demon Phosphorus, ex-Firefly. The episode A Mirror Darkly has an interesting fight in an observatory with the heroes fighting mirror images of themselves.
  Attack of the Terrible Trio is of minor interest only for scenes of Barbara at her school. Three misfits use the Man-Bat formula to become monstrous beasts. They take revenge on the popular students including roommates. Barbara spies on them. One of the misfits first is a fox, then later turns into a griffin. Otherwise not too good.
  Joker Express is the only episode which I have watched more than once from this season. It is one of the few good ones. The Joker is mind bending Gotham's citizens into committing crimes for him. Batman, Robin & Batgirl go underground to derail Joker's plot to destroy Gotham City by collapsing the cave system under the city with explosives. Batgirl comes under the influence of Joker's hypnotism lights, starts laughing and stealing jewelry. Robin has to chase and fight Batgirl. Later Bruce and Dick follow her in the daytime as she retraces her steps. She spends hours shopping, especially for shoes. Eventually she takes the subway to school. On the subway, everyone, including Bruce, get hypnotized by the light in the train and they rob a museum while laughing hysterically. Later he ride the train again and discover how it was done. Then there are the scenes underground on a wild ride in a coal car, a time when all three are confined in a giant birdcage. Naturally they defeat the Joker in the end. it is a highly enjoyable episode.
  Most of the other episodes are not to my taste, though a few have scenes of interest. I image the episode Lost
Heroes is probably the most popular and Batgirl did play a significant role in that near the end, but I generally dislike alien invasion films.",1405468800,,2593,4.721238938053097
3162349,5,B0016OM3WC,"Having watched Seasons 3 and 4, I found I really didn't care for ""The Batman"" series. The stories were weak, the series incarnation of the Joker was annoying, and the series incarnation of Batgirl was so annoying to the point of being exasperating -- she was a scrawny, cheesy, one-liner machine who lacked the dignity of previous Batgirls. Most annoying of all was the soundtrack to this series, driven by awful synthesizer music that at times could be so jarring as to distract from the stories themselves.

That said, the fifth season was a pleasant surprise, the only season worth watching, IMO.
The main reason for this is that almost every episode features one member of the Justice
League colleague as a guest star. Superman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Green Arrow,
Martian Manhunter, all of them make an appearance at one point or another (would have
liked to have seen the mighty Wonder Woman make an appearance too, but it was not
to be, unfortunately). It is fun to watch Batman's stoic and analytical personality vis a vis
the colorful perosnalities of the Justice League, from Flash's zaniness to the Martian Manhunter's
otherworldly weirdness. The stories are much more interesting and faster paced. The appearance
of the uber-annoying Batgirl is kept to a minimum, while Robin (a more interesting and likeable
character in this series) is given greater screen time.

I would advise that you skip the rest of this series, and just purchase this last and final season. It will make an excellent addition to your animation collection.",1397520000,,1545,4.961389961389961

There are times when anime style doesn't work when the characters look too generic.  Here they have all their familiar traits.

3162373,4,B0016OM3WC,"(Concluded from my reviews on The Batman - The Complete Season One, The Batman - The Complete Season Two, The Batman vs. Dracula, The Batman - The Complete Season Three & The Batman - The Complete Season Four)

WARNING: This review contains more spoilers than the previous ones.

This is it. The fifth & final season AKA the Justice League season, as many episodes contain at least one member of the League. First the excellent two-part opener, The Batman/Superman Story. Superman, voiced as he was previously in Justice League/JL Unlimited by George Newbern, teams up with Batman to fight Lex Luthor (voiced again by the excellent Clancy Brown), who's heading, what might be called, the Gotham ""chapter"" of the Legion Of Doom. The interesting thing here is Superman is portrayed as the loner, and Batman is more team oriented, due to his experiences with Batgirl and Robin. This is a role reversal from what I've seen previously. Also, there is a key event that comes up again in the finale.

Other heroes we see teaming up (one episode at a time) with the Bat are Green Arrow, Flash, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), and Hawkman. Each of these episodes contains a villain from the featured JL member's rogues gallery. Other standout episodes are one with an AI Joker 2.0, and one which features Wrath and Scorn, evil counterparts to the Batman and Robin.

Lost Heroes is the two-part finale, featuring all eight heroes (counting Batgirl and Robin). Super powered heroes are disappearing, leaving only two JL members, Batman and Green Arrow, to investigate. Of course, I don't want to give the whole story away, but the kidnapped members end up losing their powers to android versions of themselves. Think Amazo, but one set of powers per droid. Batman has the answer, in a twist that reminds me of the recent DCUAOM, JL: Doom, and its source material JLA: Tower Of Babel. It is a fitting end to the season and series. Overall this is my favorite season, though I really like it when heroes (and villains) team up, so I'm probably a bit biased. Being able to pick up the entire series for around $50-60, (lists at over $110, total) was a real plus for me, and well worth it.",1335312000,,2170,4.717678100263853

Those episodes I just mentioned are some of the gems of this series.

Most definitely this series is geared toward the younger crowd, but it also applies to the early adult audience (I'm in my 30's & enjoy it).

3162385,3,B0016OM3WC,"I'll come right out with it; I wasn't enamored with The Batman from the onset.  While it was great that somebody has decided to bring the legend of the Dark Night back to Saturday mornings in a time when the nation was collectively just coming out of the first wave of Japanese-inspired card-based animation (Pokemon, Monster Rancher, Dragon Ball Z, etc.).  The problem of course was that Bruce Timm and company had done such a commendable job of transferring the moody, dark vigilante -style Tim Burton had introduced fans to in his 1988 film in Batman The Animated Series throughout the 90s.  Comparisons were inevitable and while The Batman was brighter and certainly toned down, over time I (like many others) began to come to appreciate the show for what it was (rather than how it compared to TAS).  There were ups and downs along the way; the biggest downer for me personally was the introduction and constant use of the ""Bat Brats"", Robin & Batgirl.  The second came in the form of the Rogue's Gallery: a brood so interesting that I would have imagined nobody could possibly screw it up.  There has traditionally been way too much usage of the dreadlocked Joker while long-standing staples such as Mr. Freeze and Two-Face have been non-entities.

For the 5th and final season, the producers followed in the footsteps of Bruce Timm and company once again by making the transition over to the Justice League (and the Batman's honorary part-time membership).  In and of itself, this was a wise move in my opinion as it opened up a whole new set of situations, partnerships, and villains to battle.  This works brilliantly several times throughout the 13-episode season but for the vast majority of the time, the link-up falls way short of the dynamic the 2000's incarnation of Justice League presented to spoiled fans such as myself.

Rather than a continuing story-arc with the Justice League (and that was entirely possible considering the material), the JL episodes are simple stand-alone encounters separated by very typical blow-off episodes that would have fit in very well in the second or third season.  Again the writers slipped into Joker mode with a whopping triple back-to-back run while veterans like the Scarecrow, Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, Clay Face, and the superbly done Riddler make not a single appearance.  Worse still is the fact that the decently presented Firefly becomes a ball of living radiation early on in the season and is never heard from again.

All in all, in keeping in mind the 6-11 age target demographic, I realize that I'm certainly coming down a bit hard on the show.  That said, it's tough to celebrate concepts such as trying to steal an entire building by floating it away or a runaway mine-cart scene straight out of Indiana Jones certainly don't push the limits of creativity either.  I conclude that this effort is probably most closely on par with the efforts of the second or third season of the show.  The fourth raised the bar so high that I fear there was only one direction for the 5th to follow.  I'll certainly miss The Batman and cling to the hope that Cartoon network's new series: Batman The Brave and the Bold will be adequate enough to satisfy the Gotham fix for those of us who simply can't get enough.",1228694400,4,3261,4.784313725490196

When season four came out I realized how great this series actually was and how well done everything was, the introduction of Robin and Batgirl and the introduction of the Justice League at the end of season four.  Now season 5, the best of what's around, now the Batman teams up with all the memeber of the Justice League one at a time, starting with a reluctant to join Man of Steel.

Previously I had purchased The Complete First,Second,Third,Fourth, and now the Fifth Season on DVD. I have alway loved animation/Cartoons, and with each year they seem too just get better. The art work is incredible to watch. The colors are well used. And the best part is that all of the villians have some depth too them. Each episode is able to stand on its own, due too good script writting. The introduction of other super heroes is well done. Like Green Arrow, John Jones, The Flash & Superman, all leading up too the coming of the Justice League.
Again, The Batman series stands on it's own, but in view of the big picture the Justice League story is nicely introduced without taking away from the Batman.
Although The Batman series is made for children, there are still many one liner that only adults would get.
This may sound cliche, but, it truly is a cartoon that address's Kids of all ages.

3162391,3,B0016OM3WC,"Overall this was one of the most disappointing seasons of The Batman series. It promised so much, but failed to deliver the goods. I asked myself after watching the entire season where their big mistakes were and almost every time it comes back to character. Batman is less brooding and compared to the Superman portrayed in the series they seem to have had a role reversal. I was not buying that at all. Then you have these writer liberties with characters that make no since to the characters at all. One such liberty was the center point to the first Green Lantern story. In this story Sinestro fails in his attempt to get Hal Jordan's ""almost powerless"" ring, and Hal sends it to Batman. I was ok with the story to that point, but then it takes this crazy drive through stupid. Penguin ends up with the ring, don't ask how.  Suddenly it has enough power to rob half of Gotham even though it still has not been charged. Furthermore, anyone half familiar with the Green Lantern could tell you that the Penguin couldn't power the weapon even if it were at full power. Finally Batman ends up with the ring, which still appears to have enough power to take on a planet. Just when you think they may redeem the episode with something cool from the obviously will power full Batman, they totally do nothing with it except fly him around Gotham. It was a very lame episode.  Another similar issue happens in the last two episodes were the writers seem to have forgotten that all the power of Green Lantern is in the ring. The plot has them ""stealing"" the power of Green Lantern and putting it in a ""droid"". If that happened, couldn't Green Lantern just recharge the ring? It is as if the character did not fit the formula for the story they just ignored the character and wrote the story anyway. The same could be said for Hawkman in the same episode. After all it is his Nth metal in his wing harness that allows him to fly. It was never removed and yet he lost the ability, disappointing. The creative team never seemed to get the hang of how to effectively tell a Batman story with another major hero in it. Aside from these very distracting story elements, many stories seemed to be rip offs of other animated cartoon series. One story in particular appeared to be a rip from Batman Beyond's Chimera storyline. The similarities were such that I found it annoying to watch and the worst part was it was not a better version of the story. Another issue was that most of the dialogue seemed tired and used up in every episode. It failed to be funny when it was trying and it failed to be clever when it had to be.

So what is good about it? Well, it is Batman. There are plenty of gadgets. The Batman armor in one show will no doubt remind many of Frank Miller's Dark Knight.  The introductions of Superman, Flash, Green Arrow, Hawkman and Green Lantern brought some giddiness as they should due to some cool design work, but it was massively dulled by drab plotlines and weak dialogue. We get to see a few villains that are rarely seen on TV these days, Mirror Master was one of my favorites.  A few episodes, notably the Joker Express and the Phosphorous episodes were actually pretty good, but that is likely due to the absence of guest stars. The great news is your 6 year old will like it. Mine did. However, your older kid may have a few complaints of his own. My 11-year-old thought the show was ripping off storylines from the other series as well and was not overly impressed with the season at all. Overall this season is worth picking up just to complete the series, but I think you will find yourself thanking them for ending this series with this season.",1220832000,,3664,4.446428571428571

3162396,3,B0016OM3WC,"The 5th (and final) season of KidsWB's ""The Batman"" takes a ""Brave and the Bold"" approach as Batman teams up with Superman, Green Lantern, Flash, and other heroes from the expanded DC Universe. Also featured this season are villains like Shadow Thief, Sinestro, and Lex Luthor.

If you're a comics fan, there's always a decent thrill in seeing characters cross over and interact, and for that alone this set is worth a purchase. But objectively, it's not really one of The Batman's better seasons. The animation is nowhere near as kinetic and thrilling as in the early seasons, and the writing isn't as strong as season 4, arguably the best season of the series. Really, the superhero guest spots fall into a predictable formula: Hero X comes to Gotham to help Batman defeat villain Y from Hero X's rogues gallery. Rinse and repeat. The two best stories of the season are the two that stick to the classic Bat-family: one involving Firefly turning into Phosphorous, the other involving an anti-Batman and Robin team.

Again it's absolutely awesome to see lesser-used characters like Hawkman appear in a Batman series, but it feels like so much more could've been done with this season. With 13 episodes and some brief bonus features ""The Batman: The Complete Fifth Season"" is a worthwhile addition to your Batman library, just be aware that the premise of superhero team-ups is ultimately better than the actual execution.",1215820800,2,1422,4.945606694560669

The Joining, who was in the fourth seasons' finale, makes a return in this seasons' finale(which is over 40 minutes long). Batman teams up with the likes of Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkman, Green Arrow, Martian Manhunter &, in the season finale, the entire Justice League. He squares off against the likes of Lex Luthor, Metallo, Mercy Graves, Count Vertigo, Wrath, Toyman, Sinestro, Shadow Thief, Mirror Master and the Terrible Trio. Vocal talents were provided by Rino Romano, Evan Sabara, Danielle Judovits,  Alastair Duncan,  Mitch Pileggi,  Dorian Harewood, Dermot Mulroney, Robert Patrick, Chris Hardwick, Charlie Schlatter and George Newbern.

3396812,5,B0016OM3WC,"Seriously, who would have even begun to think that this serious would really last this long? I didn't believe it would, because I wouuld be what you call a Batman: The Animated Series fanatics. I grew up with that Batman series and I was sure that BTAS would be the pinnacle of Batman in animation. I was wrong though, this series was totally different from the original and in some respects this series was even better than it's predecessor.

Now the real shame is that The Batman has figuratively and literally ridden off into the sunset. The cast, producers, directors, animators, etc should all be proud of what they accomplished considering that they had to constantly be compared to very heavily favored Bruce Timm Paul Dini spawn. This show in my opinion will be sorely missed considering that superhero cartoons now are at a premium with that Chaotic and coutnless others that kids really now.

The series really grew into it's own at around the midpoint of season two and it was magic from there. The first season was very mediocre and then it seemed to just flourish with the animation and the writing, the voices were spot on. Rino Romano wasn't that great in the beginning but he really took to a whole new level all the other seasons. You could safely say that Rino Romano and Kevin Conroy in different respects are the voices of Batman.

3396813,4,B0016OM3WC,"It's not easy following in the footsteps and compared, usually unfavorably, with a series as revered as Batman TAS. From a fan's point of view, and the creators would concur, it's best to judge every endeavor on its own merits. In the case of The Batman this should be doable due to the passage of time and the fact we are evaluating different products. The first observation is The Batman is targeted at a younger audience, which is not only worth considering but one that makes it difficult for adults to critique, since this was not designed with us in mind. However comparisons can provide a framework with a few similar and eye opening. The focus on Robin and Batgirl was reminiscent of BTAS's last, lighter and arguably best season, and may have been a precursor for this incarnation. Another similarity is the exceptional animation and consistency. The emphasis of season 5 is guest stars, noticeably Superman, Hawkman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Green Arrow. This spotlighting of the DCU's best was their way of going out with all guns blazing. The series bowed out exhibiting many of the strengths and weaknesses it debuted with, but fortunately for its fans its final account is balanced on the plus side. Living in the shadows of an iconic cartoon is not easy. BTAS had a stellar run but its time had come. The Batman is a different animal whose time has also come, but for what is was it succeeded. We now have Brave and the Bold on the horizon which supposedly will be aimed at a younger audience. As with The Batman I will maintain an open mind and look forward to its debut next spring.",1215388800,3,1600,4.637323943661972

In this action-packed season, Batman joins the Justice League and teams up with Superman, Green Arrow, the Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman and Martian Manhunter against such villains like Lex Luthor, Mirror Master, Count Vertigo and more. ""The Batman"" is the Emmy Award-winning animated series based on the DC Comic hero created by artists Bob Kane and Bill Finger. The animated series maintains faithful to the comic books.

3396815,5,B0016OM3WC,"Okay, Season 3 was good and Season 4 was even better. Now here come thirteen more episodes. If you like your Batman integrated into the wider DC superhero universe, then Season 5 will be hog heaven (but don't get it twisted; THE BATMAN is not at all placed in the same continuity as the shows in Bruce Timm's DC Animated Universe). This fifth season finds a darknight detective even more amenable to teamwork, although that's not to say he's all of a sudden the life of the party. Dude still broods muchly and cloaks himself in mystery and intimidation; that's just how he rolls. But, continuing the trend begun in Season 4, Season 5 showcases members of the Justice League. The two episode arc ""The Batman/Superman Story"" kicks it off by teaming up the World's Finest, Batman and Superman, in a nifty story featuring a whole gang of supervillains and the Bat going up against the Man of Steel. I guess it's appropriate that the season (and the series) would close with the two-part ""Lost Heroes,"" a big-scale Justice League adventure.

Superhero cartoon shows don't get a lot of run nowadays, do they? THE LEGION OF SUPER-HEROES animated series just got the axe. And, yes, horribly, this is the last season in THE BATMAN series, so all the more reason to enjoy this one. The best part is Batman and Robin teaming up with various of the Justice League. Robin's awed reactions to meeting these other heroes are priceless. One downside to so many spotlights on the JLA is that less time is given to the Bat family. I miss Batgirl and her sarcasm; here, she's relegated to less face time. We do learn that time hasn't been standing still for Barbara Gordon as she's now old enough to attend college (""Attack of the Terrible Trio""). Speaking of the Bat fam, there's a sighting of Nightwing; unfortunately, he's a character in an Internet game (""The Metal Face of Comedy""). The good news is that Bat Mite doesn't show up at all.

Regarding the storytelling and the visuals, I don't believe Season 5 to be better than the prior two seasons, which are very good. THE BATMAN was always intended for the younger set of kids, so the stories here aren't as dark or psychological or as thematically layered as those in, say, BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES. Should this season find more favor with the viewers, it'll be because of its glittering star power. And if the driving theme song reminds one a bit of Hawaii Five-O, well, that's not such a bad thing, is it?

I can't envision a future in which there isn't an ongoing Batman animated series. Hopefully, the powers that be can dust off Kevin Conroy to do what he does best.

In the meantime, here are the 13 episodes of Season 5 (note that, depending on the reader, the following might contain some minor plot SPOILERS):

- Episodes 1 & 2 - ""The Batman/Superman Story (Parts 1 & 2)"" - Fun two-parter as Superman and the Bat finally meet and fight a lot of super-villains. But then Luthor gets the upper hand.
- Episode 3 - ""Vertigo"" - Green Arrow comes to Gotham to investigate Wayne Labs, which is somehow linked to people suffering mysterious ailments.
- Episode 4 - ""White Heat"" - Firefly and his brainy girlfriend steal radioactive isotopes; the debut of Phosphorus; and, finally, a sighting of Batgirl this season.
- Episode 5 - ""A Mirror Darkly"" - Flash comes to Gotham to help Batman and Robin take down the Mirror Master. One of my favorite episodes.
- Episode 6 - ""Joker Express"" - Get on board the Cuckoo Choo Choo. An outbreak of ""giggle bandits"" sweeping Gotham could only mean the return of the Joker.
- Episode 7 - ""Ring Toss"" - With Sinestro taking Hal Jordan out of action, the Green Lantern power ring ends up in the clutches of the Penguin.
- Episode 8 - ""The Metal Face of Comedy"" - A Joker henchman's invention leads to the formation of a digital Clown Prince of Crime.
- Episode 9 - ""Attack of the Terrible Trio"" - Thanks to Dr. Kirk Langstrom's mutagens, three college outcasts mutate into beasts and proceed to get their revenge on those what done them wrong. Also, Batgirl's a college freshman.
- Episode 10 - ""The End of the Batman"" - Gotham's criminal element gets its own costumed champions: Wrath and Scorn, who seem to hold a personal grudge against the Dynamic Duo.
- Episode 11 - ""What Goes Up..."" - A gravity-defying episode as Black Mask escapes with the help of the Shadow Thief, and the pair goes after a Thanagarian meteorite. Can a certain winged Thanagarian lawman be too far behind?
- Episodes 12 & 13 - ""Lost Heroes"" (Parts 1 & 2)"" - Hugo Strange and the Joining return as, one by one, Justice League members begin to vanish until, finally, only the two least powerful heroes are left - Green Arrow and Batman.",1212883200,48,4690,4.571938168846611

3396845,3,B0016OM3WC,"The Batman--Complete Fifth Season (2007-2008) has little to recommend for its final season. The animation continues to be poor, and too many of the episodes feature characters from the Justice League or Superman shows. Perhaps this made it more popular with some viewers, but I am one of those who prefer Batman does not have guest stars. Green Arrow appears in Vertigo with his origin story, and he appears in Lost Heroes, parts I & II. Superman appears in the two part Batman/Superman Story, and in the Lost Heroes to parter. Hawkman is in the What Goes Up episode, The Flash in A Mirror Darkly, Green lantern in Ring Toss, Martian Manhunter in Lost Heroes, and so forth.
  Of the episodes in this set, those I liked include White Heat. Here Batgirl has a large role in trying to contain the heat Demon Phosphorus, ex-Firefly. The episode A Mirror Darkly has an interesting fight in an observatory with the heroes fighting mirror images of themselves.
  Attack of the Terrible Trio is of minor interest only for scenes of Barbara at her school. Three misfits use the Man-Bat formula to become monstrous beasts. They take revenge on the popular students including roommates. Barbara spies on them. One of the misfits first is a fox, then later turns into a griffin. Otherwise not too good.
  Joker Express is the only episode which I have watched more than once from this season. It is one of the few good ones. The Joker is mind bending Gotham's citizens into committing crimes for him. Batman, Robin & Batgirl go underground to derail Joker's plot to destroy Gotham City by collapsing the cave system under the city with explosives. Batgirl comes under the influence of Joker's hypnotism lights, starts laughing and stealing jewelry. Robin has to chase and fight Batgirl. Later Bruce and Dick follow her in the daytime as she retraces her steps. She spends hours shopping, especially for shoes. Eventually she takes the subway to school. On the subway, everyone, including Bruce, get hypnotized by the light in the train and they rob a museum while laughing hysterically. Later he ride the train again and discover how it was done. Then there are the scenes underground on a wild ride in a coal car, a time when all three are confined in a giant birdcage. Naturally they defeat the Joker in the end. it is a highly enjoyable episode.
  Most of the other episodes are not to my taste, though a few have scenes of interest. I image the episode Lost
Heroes is probably the most popular and Batgirl did play a significant role in that near the end, but I generally dislike alien invasion films.",1405468800,,2593,4.721238938053097
3396846,5,B0016OM3WC,"Having watched Seasons 3 and 4, I found I really didn't care for ""The Batman"" series. The stories were weak, the series incarnation of the Joker was annoying, and the series incarnation of Batgirl was so annoying to the point of being exasperating -- she was a scrawny, cheesy, one-liner machine who lacked the dignity of previous Batgirls. Most annoying of all was the soundtrack to this series, driven by awful synthesizer music that at times could be so jarring as to distract from the stories themselves.

That said, the fifth season was a pleasant surprise, the only season worth watching, IMO.
The main reason for this is that almost every episode features one member of the Justice
League colleague as a guest star. Superman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Green Arrow,
Martian Manhunter, all of them make an appearance at one point or another (would have
liked to have seen the mighty Wonder Woman make an appearance too, but it was not
to be, unfortunately). It is fun to watch Batman's stoic and analytical personality vis a vis
the colorful perosnalities of the Justice League, from Flash's zaniness to the Martian Manhunter's
otherworldly weirdness. The stories are much more interesting and faster paced. The appearance
of the uber-annoying Batgirl is kept to a minimum, while Robin (a more interesting and likeable
character in this series) is given greater screen time.

I would advise that you skip the rest of this series, and just purchase this last and final season. It will make an excellent addition to your animation collection.",1397520000,,1545,4.961389961389961

There are times when anime style doesn't work when the characters look too generic.  Here they have all their familiar traits. To top it all off Batman gets to team up with lots of the members of the newly formed Justice League just like he did in The Brave and the Bold!  The voice acting and themes are all top notch.

WARNING: This review contains more spoilers than the previous ones.

This is it. The fifth & final season AKA the Justice League season, as many episodes contain at least one member of the League. First the excellent two-part opener, The Batman/Superman Story. Superman, voiced as he was previously in Justice League/JL Unlimited by George Newbern, teams up with Batman to fight Lex Luthor (voiced again by the excellent Clancy Brown), who's heading, what might be called, the Gotham ""chapter"" of the Legion Of Doom. The interesting thing here is Superman is portrayed as the loner, and Batman is more team oriented, due to his experiences with Batgirl and Robin. This is a role reversal from what I've seen previously. Also, there is a key event that comes up again in the finale.

Other heroes we see teaming up (one episode at a time) with the Bat are Green Arrow, Flash, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), and Hawkman. Each of these episodes contains a villain from the featured JL member's rogues gallery. Other standout episodes are one with an AI Joker 2.0, and one which features Wrath and Scorn, evil counterparts to the Batman and Robin.

Lost Heroes is the two-part finale, featuring all eight heroes (counting Batgirl and Robin). Super powered heroes are disappearing, leaving only two JL members, Batman and Green Arrow, to investigate. Of course, I don't want to give the whole story away, but the kidnapped members end up losing their powers to android versions of themselves. Think Amazo, but one set of powers per droid. Batman has the answer, in a twist that reminds me of the recent DCUAOM, JL: Doom, and its source material JLA: Tower Of Babel. It is a fitting end to the season and series. Overall this is my favorite season, though I really like it when heroes (and villains) team up, so I'm probably a bit biased. Being able to pick up the entire series for around $50-60, (lists at over $110, total) was a real plus for me, and well worth it.",1335312000,,2170,4.717678100263853

If I remember correctly, they even do some flashback episodes of Batgirl & Robin. They also do (one of my favorites), an episode of Batman in the future. Those episodes I just mentioned are some of the gems of this series.

Most definitely this series is geared toward the younger crowd, but it also applies to the early adult audience (I'm in my 30's & enjoy it).

3396882,3,B0016OM3WC,"I'll come right out with it; I wasn't enamored with The Batman from the onset.  While it was great that somebody has decided to bring the legend of the Dark Night back to Saturday mornings in a time when the nation was collectively just coming out of the first wave of Japanese-inspired card-based animation (Pokemon, Monster Rancher, Dragon Ball Z, etc.).  The problem of course was that Bruce Timm and company had done such a commendable job of transferring the moody, dark vigilante -style Tim Burton had introduced fans to in his 1988 film in Batman The Animated Series throughout the 90s.  Comparisons were inevitable and while The Batman was brighter and certainly toned down, over time I (like many others) began to come to appreciate the show for what it was (rather than how it compared to TAS).  There were ups and downs along the way; the biggest downer for me personally was the introduction and constant use of the ""Bat Brats"", Robin & Batgirl.  The second came in the form of the Rogue's Gallery: a brood so interesting that I would have imagined nobody could possibly screw it up.  There has traditionally been way too much usage of the dreadlocked Joker while long-standing staples such as Mr. Freeze and Two-Face have been non-entities.

For the 5th and final season, the producers followed in the footsteps of Bruce Timm and company once again by making the transition over to the Justice League (and the Batman's honorary part-time membership).  In and of itself, this was a wise move in my opinion as it opened up a whole new set of situations, partnerships, and villains to battle.  This works brilliantly several times throughout the 13-episode season but for the vast majority of the time, the link-up falls way short of the dynamic the 2000's incarnation of Justice League presented to spoiled fans such as myself.

Rather than a continuing story-arc with the Justice League (and that was entirely possible considering the material), the JL episodes are simple stand-alone encounters separated by very typical blow-off episodes that would have fit in very well in the second or third season.  Again the writers slipped into Joker mode with a whopping triple back-to-back run while veterans like the Scarecrow, Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, Clay Face, and the superbly done Riddler make not a single appearance.  Worse still is the fact that the decently presented Firefly becomes a ball of living radiation early on in the season and is never heard from again.

All in all, in keeping in mind the 6-11 age target demographic, I realize that I'm certainly coming down a bit hard on the show.  That said, it's tough to celebrate concepts such as trying to steal an entire building by floating it away or a runaway mine-cart scene straight out of Indiana Jones certainly don't push the limits of creativity either.  I conclude that this effort is probably most closely on par with the efforts of the second or third season of the show.  The fourth raised the bar so high that I fear there was only one direction for the 5th to follow.  I'll certainly miss The Batman and cling to the hope that Cartoon network's new series: Batman The Brave and the Bold will be adequate enough to satisfy the Gotham fix for those of us who simply can't get enough.",1228694400,4,3261,4.784313725490196

When season four came out I realized how great this series actually was and how well done everything was, the introduction of Robin and Batgirl and the introduction of the Justice League at the end of season four.  Now season 5, the best of what's around, now the Batman teams up with all the memeber of the Justice League one at a time, starting with a reluctant to join Man of Steel.

Previously I had purchased The Complete First,Second,Third,Fourth, and now the Fifth Season on DVD. I have alway loved animation/Cartoons, and with each year they seem too just get better. The art work is incredible to watch. The colors are well used. And the best part is that all of the villians have some depth too them. Each episode is able to stand on its own, due too good script writting. The introduction of other super heroes is well done. Like Green Arrow, John Jones, The Flash & Superman, all leading up too the coming of the Justice League.
Again, The Batman series stands on it's own, but in view of the big picture the Justice League story is nicely introduced without taking away from the Batman.
Although The Batman series is made for children, there are still many one liner that only adults would get.
This may sound cliche, but, it truly is a cartoon that address's Kids of all ages.
I highly recommend it for all Super Hero Fans and Collectors.

Batman is less brooding and compared to the Superman portrayed in the series they seem to have had a role reversal. I was not buying that at all. Then you have these writer liberties with characters that make no since to the characters at all. One such liberty was the center point to the first Green Lantern story. In this story Sinestro fails in his attempt to get Hal Jordan's ""almost powerless"" ring, and Hal sends it to Batman. I was ok with the story to that point, but then it takes this crazy drive through stupid. Penguin ends up with the ring, don't ask how.  Suddenly it has enough power to rob half of Gotham even though it still has not been charged. Furthermore, anyone half familiar with the Green Lantern could tell you that the Penguin couldn't power the weapon even if it were at full power. Finally Batman ends up with the ring, which still appears to have enough power to take on a planet. Just when you think they may redeem the episode with something cool from the obviously will power full Batman, they totally do nothing with it except fly him around Gotham. It was a very lame episode.  Another similar issue happens in the last two episodes were the writers seem to have forgotten that all the power of Green Lantern is in the ring. The plot has them ""stealing"" the power of Green Lantern and putting it in a ""droid"". If that happened, couldn't Green Lantern just recharge the ring? It is as if the character did not fit the formula for the story they just ignored the character and wrote the story anyway. The same could be said for Hawkman in the same episode. After all it is his Nth metal in his wing harness that allows him to fly. It was never removed and yet he lost the ability, disappointing. The creative team never seemed to get the hang of how to effectively tell a Batman story with another major hero in it. Aside from these very distracting story elements, many stories seemed to be rip offs of other animated cartoon series. One story in particular appeared to be a rip from Batman Beyond's Chimera storyline. The similarities were such that I found it annoying to watch and the worst part was it was not a better version of the story. Another issue was that most of the dialogue seemed tired and used up in every episode. It failed to be funny when it was trying and it failed to be clever when it had to be.

So what is good about it? Well, it is Batman. There are plenty of gadgets. The Batman armor in one show will no doubt remind many of Frank Miller's Dark Knight.  The introductions of Superman, Flash, Green Arrow, Hawkman and Green Lantern brought some giddiness as they should due to some cool design work, but it was massively dulled by drab plotlines and weak dialogue. We get to see a few villains that are rarely seen on TV these days, Mirror Master was one of my favorites.  A few episodes, notably the Joker Express and the Phosphorous episodes were actually pretty good, but that is likely due to the absence of guest stars. The great news is your 6 year old will like it. Mine did. However, your older kid may have a few complaints of his own. My 11-year-old thought the show was ripping off storylines from the other series as well and was not overly impressed with the season at all. Overall this season is worth picking up just to complete the series, but I think you will find yourself thanking them for ending this series with this season.",1220832000,,3664,4.446428571428571

3396891,5,B0016OM3WC,This third TV series of Batman is highly imaginative -- an important contribution to animated art! Rates triple A+++++.,1218240000,,119,5.315789473684211
3396892,4,B0016OM3WC,"Yeah, I pretty much like anything Batman.  However, this series was well done, from the music to the villians.  I was excited (as were my kids) when a fifth season was released.",1218240000,,177,4.5
3396893,3,B0016OM3WC,"The 5th (and final) season of KidsWB's ""The Batman"" takes a ""Brave and the Bold"" approach as Batman teams up with Superman, Green Lantern, Flash, and other heroes from the expanded DC Universe. Also featured this season are villains like Shadow Thief, Sinestro, and Lex Luthor.

If you're a comics fan, there's always a decent thrill in seeing characters cross over and interact, and for that alone this set is worth a purchase. But objectively, it's not really one of The Batman's better seasons. The animation is nowhere near as kinetic and thrilling as in the early seasons, and the writing isn't as strong as season 4, arguably the best season of the series. Really, the superhero guest spots fall into a predictable formula: Hero X comes to Gotham to help Batman defeat villain Y from Hero X's rogues gallery. Rinse and repeat. The two best stories of the season are the two that stick to the classic Bat-family: one involving Firefly turning into Phosphorous, the other involving an anti-Batman and Robin team.

Again it's absolutely awesome to see lesser-used characters like Hawkman appear in a Batman series, but it feels like so much more could've been done with this season. With 13 episodes and some brief bonus features ""The Batman: The Complete Fifth Season"" is a worthwhile addition to your Batman library, just be aware that the premise of superhero team-ups is ultimately better than the actual execution.",1215820800,2,1422,4.945606694560669
