8438033,5,B004QC6HR8,"I would give this DVD a 4 star review is because a few on the videos lack luster to me. I feel like they really go slow and don't have enough to capture a student's interests.

But Musical Max is amazing! I LOVED this video so much I give it more than 5 stars! Pushing the rating of this DVD up to 5 stars!  So cute and some entertaining reading!",1462838400,,346,3.9285714285714284

8438040,5,B004QC6HR8,"This video contains the following books:

Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin (by Lloyd Moss)
Musical Max (by Robert Kraus)
The Star-Spangled Banner (sung by Aretha Franklin, with a detailed historical explanation afterward)
Keeping House (by Margaret Mahy)
Patrick (by Quentin Blake)
Apt. 3 (by Ezra Jack Keats)

I think this video is great! I'm a music teacher, and I have read the book ""Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin"" to my first graders, but this version helps them understand what the instruments sound like (same with ""Musical Max"").

""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is great too, because it illustrates what the words actually mean, and it has 3 of the 4 original verses, as well as a very detailed historical explanation that was perfect for my third graders when we had an America-themed concert.

""Keeping House"" isn't really about music, but it's a cute little story. I like ""Patrick"", which is a nonverbal story. The title character plays classical music on his violin, which I am a big fan of. ""Apt. 3"" is a great story as well, I'm a big fan of Ezra Jack Keats.

I highly recommend this DVD. It's my first read-along DVD I've ever experienced, but I will be getting a lot more!",1329868800,7,1168,4.705882352941177
