I decided to watch it, little did I know that I was going to be so absorbed  in it. I loved the way the story always had you thinking you knew who the  murderer was but then the police found a new suspect. And speaking of  police this movie was especially great because of Cadet Cutie Tony(Kevin  Dillon)and Alicia Silverstone,who executed her catholic  school-girl  innocence well. Oh and the murderer turns out to be . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . .  you think I'm going to tell you,watch the movie and you'll find  out!",956102400,12,666,4.022900763358779
193143,3,157362554X,"High school girl who wants to be a detective like her father goes in over her head when she gets involved with one of the new deputies and ends up sticking her nose where she wishes she hadn't. Nice little thriller that  flaunts it's name too many times in the beginning. Silverstone delivers as  usual and the carnival scene, which is shorter than the video box  describes, is the highpoint.",946425600,2,392,4.571428571428571
193144,4,157362554X,"All Alicia fans will be delighted with this if they have not seen it yet.  She is at her adorable best and with a suspenseful story to boot, and an OK Devin Dillon as her co star. I don't know why this excellent film was  ignored  by critics, although probably because it was made for TV",936489600,,287,4.089285714285714
193195,5,157362554X,"Alicia Silverstone stars in this 1995 crime thriller as bright, intelligent, adorably cute Catholic schoolgirl, Mary Giordano. She has an obsession with mystery novels and is an occasional reader of a magazine called True Crime--hence the name. Her addiction to mystery novels and such causes her to do her own detective work as she aspires to one day be a police detective.

Mary begins nosing around, trying to assist her mentor, Detective Jerry Guinn on solving the case of the murder of a mutual classmate, Kathleen at the hands of a serial killer who's been murdering teenage girls around the area. One afternoon, she gets into a small altercation with a young man at the market who she later discovers is Tony Campbell; coincidentally a new cadet at the police station being trained by Jerry.

While they start out at first having their differences with each other, they quickly develop a bond and develop feelings for each other. They work together to try and solve the case, despite warnings from police to stay out of it due to not being in a position to get involved with such a situation. Each day that goes by Mary and Tony get closer to solving the crime but unbeknownst to Mary; the closer she gets to breaking the case, the greater danger she puts herself in for becoming the killer's next victim

Overall: True Crime was an enjoyable thriller for me in this Encyclopedia Brown-Nancy Drew mashup of a movie. The movie does its best to keep your attention beginning to end and all characters involved in this film perform fairly well in their roles. Marla Sokoloff (Gia from Full House) plays a minor decent role in this film as the bratty and conceited sister of Mary. The movie tries to throw in twists to make you change your mind on who you think the killer is but really it's kind of obvious from the get-go who it is but that doesn't stop it from being a good film to enjoy. True Crime has been horribly criticized for being a bad film, which would probably explain why it went direct-to-video and never saw the light of day in a movie theater. But really it's not as bad as what the negative critics are saying and it's all simply over exaggeration. Because of that, True Crime is an Alicia Silverstone film that's a bit forgotten. If you're a fan of Alicia Silverstone movies, think she's a cutie (which she is), or are looking for a good crime/thriller film, then give True Crime a watch",1432425600,,2410,4.6

193231,2,157362554X,"I couldn't believe this piece of dumbness.  The Kevin Dillon character escaped from a max security prison and is now about to be given a police job?  Really?  Most of the dramatic entertainment consisted of him deflowering the Catholic School teenage Alicia Silverstone character.  Dunno, my wife is a long time fan of real true crime novels and movies (i.e. ""The Stranger Beside Me"", etc.).  Maybe this flick just needs a new name.  ""Lame Crime"", or some such.",1343260800,,461,4.846153846153846
193232,5,157362554X,"TRUE CRIME with Alicia Silverstone

I saw the trailer and don't understand why  it shows her mother telling her that her father was NOT killed in the line of duty and it shows a policeman's hat burning in a garbage can. What is up with that? It's not in the movie. Why was this picture edited?

Otherwise, it has a lot of meaning because the killer actually told Mary (Silverstone) why he was killing.  He had been humiliated because of his fear of heights. All the killings were connected to the carnival and Kathleen, Mary's classmate's little sister, was a champion swimmer and no doubt an active diver. I think this goes over a lot of people's heads who watch this movie. The killer hangs around the things that set him off-  carnivals and swimming pools with high dives. Mary knew who the killer was the minute she looked at him. But breaking into a detective's office and sneaking through files and sharing them with a cadet who is obviously not a real cop because he is breaking rules himself....she was so desperate to solve the case she put herself at risk and people got killed because of her carelessness. She did stop a killer, though, but had to live with the memories of the people who died. A beautiful soundtrack, great music. Very good movie. Nice location.",1245801600,2,1274,4.5701754385964914
193233,5,157362554X,"I stumbled across this movie on Lifetime Television this morning. What caught my attention initially is how much Kevin Dillon sounds so much like his brother Matt (vocally).
I liked it for a TV movie and I felt for Mary at the end as I think her character really didn't wanna believe the ""twist"" that was taking place.
Kevin makes a good bad boy that's for sure. Both him & Matt play bad duded pretty damn well and they're easy on the eyes too!
Granted I don't think alot of people might feel the same way but I thought it was a neat little thriller that told it's story well in 90 minutes.",1214006400,,590,4.230088495575221
193234,2,157362554X,"The ending has always stuck with me. A young girl following her dad to the police force. Not a great movie, maybe not even very good. But a story good enough to tell. A collrctable movie.",1176163200,,187,4.222222222222222
193235,3,157362554X,"Let's face it sometimes you just need to sit through a bad movie. This one would be a fabulous choice !

Kevin Dillon is, well, Kevin Dillon. At least he remembered his lines.

Alicia Silverstone is an ugly virgin bookworm (yeah, sure).

The big mystery can pretty much be figured out within 10mns and you spend the next 80 screaming at Silverstone ""Don't you GET IT by now, you MORON ????""

All in all a very very very bad flick I really enjoyed.",1111795200,2,447,4.349397590361446
193236,4,157362554X,"I like most of the movies Alicia Silverstone is in. I thought this movie was entertaining but i can see it as just a tv movie, im not suprised it wasn't in the theatres. It is probably on the same level or a little bit better than the babysitter which also starred Alicia silverstone. Movie is about a girl who is fascinated and interested in crime and detective work. Soon a fellow classmate is murdered and she starts to investigate the case along with the police officer played by ( matt dillon). While shes investigating signs are pointing to dillan as the killer and then things get worse from there.  This was a pretty good thriller and if you like this i recomend the crush and the babysitter as well. Overall good story.",1081123200,4,728,4.473684210526316
193237,5,157362554X,"This is a good thriller despite the fact many critics panned it.  Alicia Silverstone is excellent as the virginal Mary Giordano who wants to follow in her dead father's footsteps and become a police officer.  Secretly investigating some recent teenage murders Alicia finds herself in mortal danger from a madman who knows more about her than she realizes. Billy Nunn is great as a cynical older Cop who knew Alicia's father and tries to tell the eager young woman she shouldn't romanticize crime. Aided and abetted by a sexy young cop played well by Kevin Dillon, Alicia is drawn into a web of deceit and desire that just might kill her if she is not careful.  There is a wonderful sting in the tale that will shock you (if you don't work it out first) and the plot and acting is first rate.  Another underrated film that deserves more merit than it is given.",976147200,8,859,4.558441558441558
193238,2,157362554X,"An enjoyable movie that needed a good editor.  If you can tolerate some slow parts, and ignore the sophomoric and silly dream sequences that clutter up the movie, it's very well acted by Silverstone and Dillon.  Bottom line: it's a one hour movie wrapped in a 94 minute package, but the  one hour inside is pretty darn good.",963792000,8,324,4.551724137931035
7798405,4,157362554X,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 1995/1996 and written & directed by Pat Verducci, ""True Crime"" (aka Dangerous Kiss) is a mystery/crime/teen/romance starring Alicia Silverstone as a Catholic school senior in California who befriends a police cadet (Kevin Dillon) to solve a case of serial killings of young women. Their investigations lead them to a traveling carnival. Bill Nunn plays the girls detective friend and the cadets boss.

This came out right after Alicias breakthrough flicks The Crush (1993) and Clueless (1995) and, while entertaining for what it is, it pales by comparison. The main problem isn't the cast, locations or excellent percussion-oriented score, but rather the script; and, more specifically, who the killer turns out being. With just a couple imaginative tweaks this couldve been a very satisfying teen mystery  la Nancy Drew, but with considerable edge. Still, Silverstone makes it agreeable, along with the other highlights noted. If you like those other two flicks, this is a must.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA.

7798408,4,157362554X,"I saw this on TV first, read what it was about, but didn't get to watch it. So I looked up the movie on amazon and google to read reviews about it if it's worth buying and watching. I love mysteries whether from the old classics, 80's, 90's, and current. The killer was predictable and you pretty much know who did it the whole time!! This was good I give it overall 3.5-4/5 because it was a Nancy Drew kind of mystery, but there are some awkward sexual scenes which weren't expected, but it was a good mystery for the price I paid. The mother seemed oblivious the whole time, and didn't really know what her kids were up to?? Alicia Silverstone was great and sleuthing was her best suit in this suspense film.
