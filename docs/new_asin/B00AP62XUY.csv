8555630,5,B00AP62XUY,"great docu-flic, I enjoyed how much of the movie was about the Mexican political landscape that shaped the birth of rock in Mexico and ultimately the rebellious voice of Molotov in recent years. Saw this premier live in Austin at SXSW and then Molotov perform 2 hours later at Auditorium Shores. It was great to see the crowd packed and the energy these guys create. My buddy Tyler watched this with me and said he totally got into the movie even with the English subtitles.",1446681600,3,474,4.588235294117647
