3620108,5,B001GTOABY,"First saw this film in 7th grade when it came out on TV. It's corny and sometimes plays into the stereotypes of Joan of Arc, but overall entertaining and lovely.",1514073600,,161,4.4
3620109,1,B001GTOABY,This film again hijacks the story of this saint as a brutish crude person. This character is impious and conceited. A very poor showing indeed.,1510790400,,143,4.76

3620111,4,B001GTOABY,"Not fully accurate, but it is still an excellent version of Joan of Arc - If you're interested in her true life story, then read the following book by Regine Pernoud: ""Joan of Arc: By Herself and Her Witnesses"" - this is the most accurate account of her life, and it also debunks a lot of misconceptions about her life.",1505520000,,319,4.333333333333333

3620117,5,B001GTOABY,This movie is my favorite. I originally had the VHS version but lost it in a move. I had not been able to find the DVD. I found it on here. The price was a bit steep for the movie but to me was well worth it.,1495584000,,208,3.4468085106382977
3620118,3,B001GTOABY,"Somehow I remembered this being alot better when it aired on TV for the first time way back when. It hasn't necessarily aged well, but does give the basics of the Joan of Arc story in a passably entertaing way. C+",1495497600,,213,4.219512195121951

3620125,5,B001GTOABY,One of the best movies about St. Joan...loved it!,1487894400,,49,4.555555555555555

3620127,5,B001GTOABY,Good movie in spite of its many historical inaccuracies.,1485820800,,56,5.333333333333333
3620138,5,B001GTOABY,"Jacoba Francisca Maria ""Cobie"" Smulders (Robin Scherbatsky on the tv show HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER) would have been a good pick to play the part of Joan of Arc along side her co-star Neil Patrick Harris (King Charles VII, and HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER's Barney Stinson)...
But I liked the gal who played the grown Joan of Arc in this film.  This film is less sexually and physically violent than THE MESSENGER, although the Messenger is more humorous (comic relief).
I would not let a child watch THE MESSENGER.  Both are good films though.

JOKE:  PIC:  Coat of Arms for the Dauphin, heir apparent to the throne of France.  Dauphin is French for Dolphin.

What did Darth Gator say to the Dolphin?
"" 'Fluke'.  You are my fodder.""

What did Joan of Arc's father (Jacques d'Arc, pronounced ""dark"", Dark Vader we''ll call him) say to Charles VII, the Dauphin (Dolphin) heir to the throne of France, whose mother had spread a rumor that the Dauphin might not be the legitimate son of her deceased husband King Charles VI ?

"" 'Fluke'  (Dark Vader's pet name for his illegitimate son).
  I am your father"".

Joan's dark father, Jacques d'arc,  attempts to snuff out the life of the newborn Joan of Arc.  Be sure to get the DVD and not the VHS.
The VHS leaves out this very very important scene.  The VHS also leaves out the very important final scene where Jean d'Metz returns Joan's banner to her parents after her death.  Heartbreaking.

Jacques d'Arc would have been about 22 years old at the conception of Charles VII.  Jacques was born in 1380, and Charles was born on Feb 22, 1403.  Charles VII died on the Feast Day of Mary Magdalene July 22, 1461.  Catch 22.
I always though Joan of Arc was the return of Mary Magdalene just as Elijah had returned as John the Baptist.

MORE FOOD FOR THOUGHT:
Can you imagine the entire cast of ""HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER"" with:
Marshall - as d'Arc Vader (Jacques d'Arc)
Barney - as Charles VII
Robin - as Joan of Arc
Ted - as  Duke d'Alencon or Jean d'Metz
Lily - as the bossy mother-in-law of King Charles VII",1485302400,,2036,4.425876010781671

The DVD could not come in a more pristine distributed case, with an elaborate booklet about the movie inside; beneath a booklet of other Catholic films.

The movie itself receives the one star, because this 'Joan of Arc' movie is NOT the same one distributed by Alliance Atlantis who made the original miniseries - which is what this movie is specifically famous for. ([...])

Ignatius Press has distributed this film - and BUTCHERED it. The editing is uncomfortable, they have omitted famous scenes from the movie and placed outtake footage to fill in the rest; which makes the movie much more dull than it needs to be. The story Ignatius Press tells in their distributed version of this film is not the same story originally produced by Alliance Atlantis films ... because these are two different distributors.

One more time: this movie will not be the best copy to buy; you will be utterly disappointed in the handling of this film; the new distributors of this film have butchered it with numerous outtakes, making their own 'director's cut' style type of film. In fact, this would be the 'editor's version,' because the editor of the copy of this film was made to promote Ignatius Press. You will be disappointed. Please search for the 'Joan of Arc' movie located in the link above. In the credits of this copy of the film, they list three separate people as 'Additional Editors,' who have made this copy more diluted.",1464134400,,1518,4.720754716981132
3620144,5,B001GTOABY,"This story has been in so many ways, but I liked this fresh look at the Maid of Orleans.  Joan began conversing with saints when she was very young and had no doubt what she was being asked to do.

She was wildly successful and united France only to be betrayed by men she trusted.",1463443200,,281,4.090909090909091
3620145,5,B001GTOABY,This is definitely a five star movie to add to your collection and I do not suggest this lightly.  The story is historically accurate for the most part.  The acting is superb.  The life of Joan of Arc is truly inspiring.  Many Catholic or Christian films are B rate but this is hollywood caliber.  Enjoy!,1460332800,,304,4.454545454545454
3620146,5,B001GTOABY,Love this film.  Ms. Sobieski portrays Joan of Arc with confidence and an air of nobility which she needed to persuade the hierarchy of her mission.  Her visions and her faith were her impetus to push forward even to her death as a martyr.  Very good authentic film about the life of this saint.,1459641600,,295,4.425925925925926
3620147,2,B001GTOABY,"Very boring.  I fell asleep.  Good actors don't always make good movies.  The player of Joan of Arc didn't even have a realistic voice.  If you don't know the true story behind Joan of Arc, study it before watching this.",1458518400,,220,4.425

3620155,3,B001GTOABY,"THIS MOVIE HAS SOME GOOD PARTS, BUT THEY WERE RUINED BY THINGS SHOWN THAT WERE COMPLETELY UNHISTORICAL, IF NOT ANTI-HISTORICAL. WHAT REALLY TOOK PLACE IS EASILY FOUND OUT. THE BOOKS OF REGINE PERNOUD SOLVE ALL OF THE HISTORICAL DIFFICULTIES. EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE EXCELLENT ACTORS, INCLUDING PETER O'TOOLE, THEY CANNOT RESCUE THIS GROSSLY  UNHISTORICALFILM. DURING THE ASSAULT ON THE TOURELLES, WHICH GUARD THE DRAWBRIDGE OVER THE RIVER TO ENTRY INTO THE CITY OF ORLEANS, JOAN IS SHOWN DECLARING THAT SHE WILL SEE GLASDALE SENT TO HELL. THERE IS NO HISTORICAL BASIS FOR THIS. A SECOND DUBIOUS TAKE ON EVENTS IS THE BELIEF THAT JOAN WAS FOLLOWING HER OWN  DESIRES, NOT THOSE OF GOD.

THE INCIDENT WERE SHE BEGGED A MAN NOT TO TAKE GOD'S NAME IN VAIN, NOT TO USE IT AS A SWEAR WORD, TO GO TO CONFESSION AND THUS TO PREPARE FOR TOMORROW'S BATTLE, IS NOT SHOWN. THIS MAN LAUGHED OFF HER WORDS, GOT ON HIS HORSE, AND, AS HE WENT OVER A SMALL BRIDGE, HIS HORSE REARED AND HE FELL INTO THE RIVER BELOW, DYING INSTANTLY AS HE STRUCK ROCK. THIS EVENT SUMS UP HER LIFE.

I DO NOT KNOW IF LEELEE IS DESCENDED FROM THE GREAT GENERAL JAN SOBIESKI, BUT IF SHE IS, HE IS TURNING OVER IN HIS GRAVE, FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING.",1453334400,,1205,4.564814814814815

3620167,3,B001GTOABY,"Considering the story of Joan of Arc is historically one of the most-well documented, you would THINK people would appreciate that and make a movie that at least somewhat captures the true story. Sigh.  Keep dreaming. Read Mark Twain's book.",1445212800,,241,5.025
3620168,4,B001GTOABY,A wonderful movie and very entertaining as LeeLee is a very good actor.  The movie was as good as Joan of Arc that stared Milla Jovovich filmed in 1999 known as The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc.  I also have seen the  movie of Joan Of Arc which was made in 1948 and starred Ingrid Bergman and also have a silent version of Joan of Arc made in 1928 that has the best acting I have ever seen with no sound due to her actual suffering seen in her facial expressions due to the director.  That famous star is Maria Falconetti and she is worth reading about.  That movie was name The Passion of Joan of Arc,1444176000,,607,4.067226890756302

3620193,4,B001GTOABY,"A tolerably good film. I won't try to detail its editing of and departures from history, one should read up on the story before seeing the film. Overall, it stuck me as a reasonable portrayal of the ambience of the period, though thankfully with not so much emphasis on the squalor as some ""realistic"" films may have gone for. Ms. Sobieski turns in a fine performance as the mysterious title character, feeling her way to her destiny.

3620220,2,B001GTOABY,"In terms of acting and as a thriller one would give 5 star to the movie. But St. Joan is a saint of the Catholic Church. She is a historical person canonised after much investigation by the Church. Therefore to portray her as one who would lie about St. Michael, to make one believe that it is ok to lie in order to save yours or someone else' skin, or act as though she were deceived by her patrons, all these indeed paint a false image of the saint and of the Church. The true story is quite different. The seeming arrogance in her response is out sync with the true St. Joan. She held the banner always and never used the sword.

What the producers did was sacrifice truth for profit, for filthy lucre's sake.

I gave it 2 stars because the acting was well done.",1409270400,,765,4.197278911564626

Of course, there is quite a bit of artistic license taken in telling this story and it makes the Catholic Church of the time look almost demonic.

It shows what one person can do, even against seemingly impossible odds, if she has faith in God and in her countrymen. Joan is not perfect--she's shown as headstrong and, at times, defiant and proud--but it is clear why this teenage girl truly is a saint. The plot is great, the acting superb, the story inspirational and suspenseful. It's moviemaking the way it should be, but, sadly, seldom is. Sobieski, who is about the same age as Joan herself was when Joan commanded the French army, is magnificent in the title role.",1394928000,,643,4.75

Another example: Bishop Cauchon was not, in fact, present at King Charles VII's crowning. This film, conversely, has Cauchon present there and as a prominent speaker.

3620248,5,B001GTOABY,"This is a really stirring, compelling and majestic movie about the heroism of France's patron saint.

Begins with her childhood as a peasant girl in the French village of Domremy during the Hundred Years War , and awareness of her nation's travails and suffering and the prophecies of the future regarding an evil queen who sold France to her enemies and a maiden and heroine who would deliver her and drive her enemies out.
Lelee Sobieski plays an alluring yet powerful and valiant Joan, a strong combination of attractiveness and toughness.
It is during the sack and burning of her village as a teenager that she hears the voices of saints telling her to free France from the English and help the Dauphin Charles to be crowned king. she at once is a patriot and fighter for the weak. such as where she instructs a man lining up for soup to make way for a little child.

The Dauphin, later King Charles VII of France, is portrayed in his fullness as a cynical and scheming young monarch by Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) while Peter O Toole adds pomp and gravitas in his role as the conniving and treacherous  Bishop Cauchon.
Soul stirring scenes of her recovery after being wounded in battle, and her leadership to the victory of the French forces she leads at the Battle of Orleans. touching scenes of her own engagement with her men and her family, and an intriguing look into the machinations of the King, Bishop Cauchon, the Burgundians and the Inquistion that set her up to be destroyed. Joan comes across played by Sobieski in parts as both vulnerable and strong to the seeming point of invincibility. Strongly admirable is the scene where she defies King Charles in his banquet hall for selling France out to the Bugundians. And harrowing scenes of her interrogation and torture by the inquisition up to her death.

This movie is a thousand times better than the sorry excuse for a portrayal of St Joan&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Messenger-The-Story-Of-Joan-Of-Arc/dp/B003F1FXSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Messenger:The Story Of Joan Of Arc</a>.

3620249,5,B001GTOABY,"When I viewed the miniseries on VHS years ago, I noticed that a scene that had been included in the original airing on CBS was missing from the VHS, and I wondered why. Same thing for the miniseries CLEOPATRA, which aired on ABC that same year. I found out several years later after purchasing both films on VHS that the miniseries' had been cut from their original length on television. I felt cheated. Anyway, I finally just saw the complete miniseries for the first time, and it was excellent. Much better than the truncated VHS edition. Same goes for CLEOPATRA. The DVD versions of the films are the complete and unedited miniseries'.

Leelee Sobieski did a wonderful job playing Joan Of Arc, and the supporting actors played their parts perfectly. The production notes on the DVD give some insight into what went on behind-the-scenes of this incredible film. Shame that there isn't any documentary or featurette on the making of the movie.

This is a movie you can sit down and watch with the whole family. There is violence, but it is not overly graphic, and there's no profanity or sexual situations (though it's implied towards the end that Joan is being sexually assaulted).

SPOILER ALERT!!!

I do have one question, though, that I thought the complete miniseries would answer, but it didn't. What was the outcome of Captain LaHire storming the castle with his army? SPOILER ALERT OVER!!!

Having not seen Jean Seberg, I'm no expert.

Interesting how they cast 2 veterans of the TV-movie 'Masada' (Peter Strauss & Peter O'Toole).
Plus, 'Judgment at Nuremberg' star Maximillian Schell as an 'inquisitor.'
Hard for me to watch battles & inquisitions, but the use of Franck's 'Panis Angelicus,' and the excellent cast make it worth watching.

3620272,5,B001GTOABY,"This movie, although historically very flawed, is so vastly entertaining that I've viewed it over a dozen times. Leelee Sobieski does a fantastic job with this. She is the correct age for Joan,
and although much taller than the real Joan and having light brown rather than black hair as Joan really did, she does a very mature, intelligent portrayal of this famous person. I like the
filming of the movie being in the East Czech Republic, where the original castles from Joan's era are still there and give the film a very strong sense of realism. The writer did make free with
the actual historical facts concerning the raising of the siege of Orleans. For instance, it was Joan herself who insisted upon attacking the English as soon as possible, not wait, like the
French commanders, such as the Bastard of Orleans, wanted to do. It was Joan who insisted that the French troops attack the English positions around Orleans immediately, and it was Joan who
inspired the discouraged French soldiers to rest, eat and drink, and then make one final attack on Les Tourelles on May 7th, 1429. This leadership by Joan proved to be decisive. I do like the way the movie showed the killing of the English commander, Sir William Glasdale, in a much more dramatic fashion that it actually happened (he fell through a burning drawbridge with his full armor on and drowned trying to escape). The medieval battle scenes shown in the raising of the siege of Orleans looked very authentic as well as the use of horses and weapons in a medieval conflict.

The scene of the coronation of Charles VII I also thought was very well done. Joan's capture by the Burgundians, however, was nothing like what the movie portrayed nor were most of the trial scenes accurately shown, but the movie was still very entertaining and close enough to the real history to give a modern audience at least some knowledge of the great story of Joan of Arc.",1350259200,,1920,4.680473372781065

3620275,4,B001GTOABY,"Joan of Arc has always been an icon in history, a woman of great faith as she at only the age of seventeen went after what she believed to be God's will with heart and soul and lead France to its salvation from the tyrannical British rule of the 15th Century. The obvious fascination with her has turned out a number of films, the most impressive of these the television mini-series by Hallmark. In flaming letters on a black background we are introduced to the title of the film and heroine. As it fades away, replaced by a burning pier upon which she stands, lifting her eyes heavenward and whispering, ""Thank you... thank you..."" a shudder, perhaps a deeply felt faith, passes through us.

Joan of Arc  is an unwanted child, born to a family of boys. Her father is a tyrannical, cruel man whose only interest is that of himself and his family. Fortunately her mother (Jacqueline Bisset) is fond of her, and Joan grows into young maturity befriended only by a blind child and the local prior, who sees in her an earnest desire to serve God. As the invading English burn and pillage the villages of France, making their way toward the capital and the home of the Dauphin Charles, Joan (Leelee Sobieski) is visited again by her patron saint Catherine and told that she will lead France to victory. Her way becomes clear after her village is burned and they are refused aid by the landowner, Sir Robert de Baudricourt, one of Charles' many pious land agents who seeks to fill his own stomach rather than serve his king. Robert's men are ordered to take a wagon of food as far as Orleans for the Prince's benefit. Abandoning her family, Joan conceals herself among the wares only to find that the wagon is bound instead for Robert's own kitchen. Taken in to see Sir Robert, Joan is mockingly given the title of ""The Maid of Lorraine,"" the mythical female savior destined to save France spoken of by Merlin in myth. But even as Robert refuses to send her on to Charles, strange things begin happening in his city.

The men follow Jean's guidance without question, strengthening the walls of the city and building up defenses. Robert's chickens also refuse to lay eggs. In desperation, Robert sends her on to Charles with a letter of recommendation... and his chickens begin to lay again. Joan is welcomed by Prince Charles, who finds her something of a commodity, a way to give the people vision; but an advocate against her comes in the form of Charles ""spiritual advisor,"" Bishop Cauchon (Peter O'Toole), who does not believe that a mere girl has the right to determine the fate of France. Yet even he cannot deny the power that radiates from Joan, even as he struggles with his own personal beliefs. Charles has appointed Joan as the head of his armies, but his military advisor gives her a backseat. She's there to cheer the troops on, lead the charge, and ""try not to get killed.""

But Joan is no pushover... and it will be she that will raise a cry against all of England and frame the powerful woman who has become a legend in her own right. Treachery lies in the eyes of someone within the Prince's confidence... and even Charles himself will betray her, though all will regret what they have done as the girl is granted entrance to heaven through the burning pier. But before her lies a great many battles to be fought, a great many people to touch and the faith that inspired France to its victory. Part history, part myth, with a little bit of imagination, this epic miniseries is a masterpiece in its attempt to bring Joan to life in living color... in a way you've never seen her before. Joan of Arc is quite impressive and while not following history exactly it does its best to portray the life of the young woman with clarity and passion, the praise of which belongs solely to the lead actress, Leelee Sobieski. She has the ""look"" of Joan of Arc... innocence mixed with wisdom, passion intertwined with fear. A strict Catholic, her belief in God is strong and her faith in the words spoken to her by the ""saints"" ideally strengthened.

Forced to evaluate her motives at one point, she repents of the sin of pride. Some may shun this film for its devout Middle Ages Catholicism but Joan of Arc was Catholic, and the Church in those days was often corrupted by crooked politicians within the church system. You are drawn into the story early on and kept pinned there throughout the full several hours. The characters all have their own amount of depth, Joan most critically, secondly the spineless and self-centered Dauphin who would betray her, and thirdly the Bishop (Peter O'Toole) who realizes too late that Joan's faith is in the right and questions his own in sending this innocent and trusting girl to an early grave. From the first glimpse into the eyes of Joan to the last moment as she looks heavenward we've been taught a lesson about faith, courage and treachery that we won't soon forget.

While there may be some minor details that are inaccurate, I really don't believe that it takes away any of the purity and faith of the real Joan.

* ""in the summer of 1425,...Joan first became conscious of that manifestation... which she afterwards came to call her 'voices' or her 'counsel'....
* ""a secret sign, communicated to her by her voices, which she made known to Charles, led the king, somewhat half-heartedly, to believe in her mission....
* ""on Sunday, 17 July, 1429, Charles VII was solemnly crowned....
* ""[Moving ahead, Joan was to later be taken prisoner by the beaten English.]. No words can adequately describe the disgraceful ingratitude and apathy of Charles and his advisers in leaving the Maid to her fate....They [the beaten English] could not put her to death for having beaten them, but they could get her sentenced as a witch and a heretic....
* ""On 29 May a court of thirty-seven judges decided unanimously that the Maid must be treated as a relapsed heretic, and this sentence was actually carried out the next day (30 May, 1431)....Her demeanour at the stake was such as to move even her bitter enemies to tears. She asked for a cross, which, after she had embraced it, was held up before her while she called continuously upon the name of Jesus. 'Until the last,' said Manchon, the recorder at the trial, 'she declared that her voices came from God and had not deceived her'....
* ""Twenty-four years later a revision of her trial, the procs de rhabilitation, was opened at Paris with the consent of the Holy See....an appellate court constituted by the pope, after long inquiry and examination of witnesses, reversed and annulled the sentence pronounced by a local tribunal....The illegality of the former proceedings was made clear.... St. Joan was canonized in 1920 by Pope Benedict XV.""

3620307,5,B001GTOABY,"If you are looking for a roller coaster ride with popcorn, watch the Messenger, which isn't a bad movie but a wildly innacurate one. If you want to see a film that blends history with action, ""Joan of Arc"" is your movie. Not perfect, but far more realistic, with Leelee looking and acting a lot more like the teen-age Joan than others have. This doesn't rush through the story as the Messenger does, and doesn't portray her as the gibbering fanatic the other movie does. Joan was always convinced God spoke to her (no matter what the reality was), but she was rational about it, keenly intelligent, and remarkably astute - not the behavior of a raving loon or someone affected by schizophrenia. She also hated violence, only seeing it as necessary to throw the English out of France, and wept openly during battles she participated in at both French and English casualties. She was described by nearly everyone who ever met her (including those in the court who condemned her) as good, virtuous, and openly concerned about the welfare of others.",1226016000,,1045,4.747252747252747

What really bugged me about this movie was how they made it seem so easy for Joan to get the approval of  everybody. Like to convince the people that she is on a quest to save Dauphin Charles and France. Yeah right, it took more than a few days to convince.

3620315,5,B001GTOABY,"While this is not the first nor the last Joan of Arc to be made, this stands at the top with a wonderfully talented cast, an even story, and a wonderful portrail of Joan's odyssey.

Played to perfection by Leelee Sobieski, Joan was, as we all know, a simple peasent girl in the farmlands of France leading an otherwise unremarkable life.  From the time she is a child, Joan hears voices and sees things.  She doesn't know that she alone is seeing these things until she seeks advice from her priest.  When her village is distroyed by invading English armies, she has a new resolve in her strange voices and visions.  She has been ordered by God to go to the French court, appeal to the prince of France, and lead the French army to victory over the English.  Without looking back, Joan leaves home.

While she is ernest in her wants, there are other powers at work.  How could a simple peasent girl hold these powers over others, especially the soon to be king of France?  When Joan meets the Daulphaine, played by Neil Patrick Harris, she presents him proof.  Only Joan and the Daulphaine know what really happened when they retreated to the other room, but Joan is given her army.  In perhaps a fluke or a true divine act, Joan leads the army into victory over the English, the Daulphaine Charles is crowned, and France's joy is restored.

What this movie does as opposed to The Messenger version is deliver both factual information as well as outlining the quick turn of the church and the crown against her, rather than take an artistic turn (although equally as effective).  When Joan's army failed the second time and she began to loose favor in the court and with the church, she was documented as getting before her knees at alters and statues of the saints that she heard.  She begged and cried before them ""Why won't you answer me?! I've done what you asked!!"".  When brought before the councils, she speaks of seeing her visions of the saints.  Saint Michael, for example, she says, wears a crown with six points on his head.  Other established visions of said Saint Michael, have him as wearing a six point crown.  Also, while Joan is confined to her prison, in the Messenger version, Joan is confronted only with her own doubts (in the form of Dustin Hoffman).  Joan was almost certainly raped, as this version shows us.

Perhaps in no other version is Joan's burning at the stake captured so well as it was with Leelee.  She burns, and would be cannonized as a saint hundreds of years later.  Truly a wonderful triumph in cinema as well as our hearts.",1187049600,,2565,4.554585152838428
3620316,5,B001GTOABY,"The beautiful Leelee Sobieski will steal your heart early in this cinematic epic. The compassion and forcefulness she portrays as Joan of Arc is unmatched. This film moves along well, its integrated continuity of suspense and action will not let you leave your seat, and the dramatic intensity of the story will take you back in time. Even though you know how the story ends, you will find yourself yearning for, and even hoping, that the last minute rescue attempt succeeds.

A Featurette on the DVD about the making of the film explains the extraordinary care and in-depth research by the screenwriters to ensure historical accuracy. Filmed by choice in the Czech Republic for its geographic similarity to medieval France, filming took place in several medieval castles. This cinematic version of ""Joan of Arc"" is the kind you will want to watch again and again. Lastly, you will want to have a box of tissues on hand before viewing.

The story is a great re-telling of the story of Joan's calling by God, her work for the crown of France, and her trial for witchcraft. Her mission is to unite France under King Charles. He uses her, as the embodiment of the mythical Maid of Lorraine, to raise an army, and he sends her to the rescue of Orlans. After Charles is crowned, she's captured in Burgundy, sold to the English, examined, found a heretic by the Inquisition, and burned at the stake.

3620320,5,B001GTOABY,"In 1999 ""Joan of arc"" received two updated film adaptions. One was a big budget motion picture titled ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" which starred singer/actress Milla Jovovich. The other was a simple made for TV movie called ""Joan of Arc"" starring Leelee Sobieski. Hollywood's sudden renewed interest in the character of Joan was basically an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the TV series XENA (about a warrior princess).

The film ""The Messenger"" took the ""warrior princess"" approach, concentrating on action over substance. The finished product actually displayed none of the qualities that made Xena a hit TV show and played like a low-grade ""Braveheart meets Conan meets Red Sonja"". Simply put, it's a horrible film.

The writers and producers of the made for TV movie ""Joan of Arc"" decided to take the high road. Instead of churning out just another throw-away ""action flick"", they assembled an incredible cast and then backed them up with an amazing script. The result is perhaps the best film version of the ""Joan of Arc"" story and a movie that anyone can enjoy regardless of religious beliefs.

Leelee Sobieski is perfect as Joan, I cannot imagine anyone bringing more to this role than she does. Peter Strauss proves once again that he's a very underated actor. Peter O'Toole delivers an incredible performance, certainly one of his all time best! Shirley MaClaine, Maximillian Schell, and yes, even Neil Patrick Harris deliver fine performances!

The last half hour of this film will have you riveted to the screen. Not by showcasing mindless action, but by the sheer power of the script and the incredible performances by O'toole and Sobieski. I highly recommend this wonderful film!

Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting.  But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys!  Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!?  Never!

Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird.  Avoid this film today, folks!",1137369600,,510,4.872093023255814
3620323,3,B001GTOABY,"This 1999 TV-movie (frequently abridged; be sure to get the full-length 140-minute DVD or double-VHS tape set)has its moments and looks positively brilliant compared to Milla's ""The MESSenger,"" but on the whole tastes like an open can of house-brand soda left out all night -- flat, tinny, and full of artificial ingredients.

The screenplay takes excessive historical liberties and is generally underdeveloped and a tad unfocused.  The direction is colorless and seems rushed,  the battle scenes in particular looking confused, unrealistic, and cliched.  (Can we PLEASE declare a moratorium on slow-motion combat photography and people screaming ""NOOOOOOooooOOO!!!"")  There is little passion in the ebb and flow of the story arc and attention tends to wander, even in the shortened version.

It is regrettable that Joan's heavily fictionalized conflicts with her father are given so much screentime at the expense of genuine historical events.  (I suspect the producers were aiming for a ""Domremy 90210"" vibe to bring in the teen set.)  The siege of Orleans is over almost before it begins.  We see very little of Joan the war leader, and this is a great shame, seeing as how this was the crux of her mission.  It is hard to imagine what a raw newcomer to Joan's life must think after seeing this production, because a complete portrait was never revealed, only glimpses.  This isn't Leelee Sobieski's fault entirely, although her performance was perhaps a bit underplayed and monotonal.  I am more inclined to blame the director and script, neither of which gave her much to work with beyond lazy melodrama.  Sobieski brings a youthfulness to the role that is refreshing and convincing, and she makes an appealing and sympathetic Jeanne.  I appreciate her vulnerability, but she doesn't display enough steel, compared to the Joan of history, who could be very impetuous and willful.  Why is Joan so reluctant to be seen as the ""maid of Lorraine""?  This is contrary to her own sense of mission as received from her Voices.  The film seems to use them as some sort of magic power -- few other characters demonstrate much religious feeling or motivation, certainly not enough for a film in this setting.

Some of the more specific historical quibbles: the real Joan had a fairly well-defined set of supporting characters, but we don't see much of them in this film. Joan's squire and page are dropped in favor of Olympia Dukakis' nun sidekick, which is fairly silly. The hard-bitten captain La Hire, mysteriously tamed by the 17-year old peasant girl, is the only notable French commander we see, and he is a blank rather than the wily, foul-mouthed Gascon veteran he really was. The Dauphin is unconvincing (it would be hard to top Jose Ferrer's 1948 performance OR physical similarity).  Pierre Cauchon, the bishop of Beauvais  who presided over Joan's trial, did not enter her life until after her capture, and his role as a scheming court minister is inaccurate.  There has been a theory put forward in recent years that Joan was raped before her execution but this is far from proven, and its inclusion in the movie is gratuitously mean and manipulative. Finally, Joan was actually captured in battle beneath the walls of Compiegne (possible betrayed from within the city; the gates were shut against her).  She fought back hard and had to be dragged from her horse. Although she had a vision of her eventual capture, she did not court it, and she certainly did not sit in the middle of her troop and let her enemies swoop in and carry her off unresisting like a sack of hamburgers. I kept expecting her brother to call out after the Burgundians, ""Hey, do you want fries with that?""

If you can't tell a simple and rousing tale like Joan of Arc's and retain your viewer's interest, you have failed Filmmaking 101. Stories don't come any more dramatic or pre-scripted. The rest is a simple matter of making the raw notes sing. This movie doesn't sing.",1130803200,,3954,4.903903903903904
3620324,5,B001GTOABY,"This movie met all my critical expectations in terms of being a well made movie.

The story is very moving and is not sensationalized by this production.

After watching this movie, I read up on Joan of Arc in my encyclopedia and found that the ""facts"" indeed matched up with what this movie presented.

I sure have to wonder if she had that epilepsy syndrome in her Temoral Lobe...which has been known to cause people to have a sincere belief of being chosen by God and living their lives strictly and unwaveringly in accordance with this belief.",1127692800,,547,4.618556701030927
3620335,5,B001GTOABY,"LeeLee Sobeiski is absolutely magnificent as Joan of Arc, the long prophesied 'Maid of Lorraine' who would reunite a divided French nation and lead them to victory and freedom against foreign invasion (the British). While there may be a few historical accuracies in this film, they are more than compensated for with the loving and respectful way in which the material is treated. It successfully accomplishes the difficult task of both providing a wonderful action/adventure film while at the same time serving as an inspirational, spiritual docu-drama.

This is such an emotional, heartfelt production. Even after numerous viewings I'm still moved to tears several times during each viewing. While 'Joan of Arc' boasts a formidable, all-star cast; Peter O'Toole, Powers Boothe, Jacqueline Bisset, Peter Strauss, Shirley MacLaine and more, the two greatest performances are those of LeeLee and Chad Willett as her friend and military companion Jean de Metz. From the moment of their first encounter when Joan is just beginning on her spiritual journey to her tragic burning on the stake, Jean is forever by her side. Their bond of mutual admiration and unspoken love is the glue that ties the storyline together so perfectly.

What an incredible directorial job by Christian Duquay! This may be a made-for-television movie, but you would never know it by the production values; cinematography, special effects, soundtrack and acting couldn't have been better. 'Joan of Arc' is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite religious/inspirational films.",1125878400,,1552,5.35655737704918

I love the acting, the music, the action...and best of all, the spiritual experience they have protrayed. I admit I never did see the movie when it aired on television but by 'mistake' I ended up buying this thing for about $10.00 at an electronics store. What I meant by 'mistake' was that I was looking for another movie I wanted to buy but they didn't carry it. As I was leaving the store, the movie jumped out to me...well not JUMP JUMP, but it was at a place where it wasn't supposed to be. At the time I did hear about the movie and I decided to give it a try, it was only a few dollars...whats to loose? So I bought it and watched it....then my parents found out so I had to watch it all over from the beginning. lol ;) Both of them ADORED it (especially my mother...she ended up buying one for her.)

This movie is a *MUST SEE* for all who need that uplifting spiritual experience...even if it's not all positive. But even through Joan's trials, it led to a admiration and spiritual growth to millions of people throughout the years.

3620338,5,B001GTOABY,"Leelee Sobieski is absolutely superb as the Maid of Lorraine, and exactly the right age to play the part. She brings a sincerity to the role that few others have achieved. She is able to convincingly portray Joan's gentle and kind nature, her determination and hard-headedness, and her fear before engaging in her first battle. She is also able to deliver Joan's often witty and cutting remarks with panache. Along with a great supporting cast and superb visuals (e.g., the entry into Orleans at night is brilliantly filmed), the film is complemented by extraordinary vocals by Charlotte Church. Her rendition of ""Panis Angelicus"" during the attempted takeover of Paris is nothing short of breathtaking. This movie does not revel in excessively gory details of war, and it does not glorify violence. For those reviewers who rated this movie poorly because the battle scenes didn't have enough gore to suit their tastes (!?!) -- you have missed the point of who Joan was and what she was able to achieve. This movie focusses on Joan's character, her faith, and her victories. Like with any historical movie, some liberties have been taken in deviating somewhat from actual historical events, and at 2 hours and 20 min., many of Joan's campaigns have been omitted out of necessity. However, the basic course of her life and achievements in convincingly portrayed. If you listen to the French translation, the script on occasion includes the actual words of Joan as they have been preserved for us in historical transcripts (the English version also, but obviously translated). Forget the abomination by Luc Besson! This is likely to be THE modern standard by which future movies of Joan will be compared.

3620344,4,B001GTOABY,"This is my favorite depiction of Joan of Arc. Leelee Sobieski does a wonderful job of portraying Joan as simultaneously pious and petulant, refusing to waver in the face of opposition to her visions. The Czech countryside is a terrific stand-in for France. Battles are portrayed with terrifying realism and valor. Plenty of blood and dirt for everyone. The acting is occasionally stilted, but the characters are wonderful, especially Peter Strauss as a skeptical La Hire and Chad Willett as steadfast Jean de Metz. Peter O'Toole is his tormented best as Bishop Cauchon, who wavers between fearsome Inquisitor and confused man fearful of losing his soul. Powers Boothe is both tough and tender as Joan's controlling father. A terrific costuming department renders the rough-hewn quality of 14th century armor.

This film doesn't take too many liberties with Joan's story, unlike the execrable ""The Messenger"". I objected a bit to the *obligatoire* scene suggesting a sexual assault in prison as Joan awaits execution. But overall, the film preserves Joan's sanctity without sacrificing her humanity.",1096416000,,1098,5.3468208092485545
3620345,1,B001GTOABY,"This is a sad excuse for a movie; it's terribly uninteresting, uninspired, and bland.  It may be the worst film I have ever seen, at least in along time.  Technically, it's more than flawed, it's broken; shattered really.  First, the acting is awful and inexcusable.  Blame should be spread evenly amongst the whole cast with a huge mound piled on Leelee Sobieski for her role as Joan.  As Joan, she is asked to carry the movie, and she fails miserably.  She lacks charisma and screen presence; there is also the odd way in which she speaks sometimes.  When reciting some of her poorly written lines, she almost closes he mouth and mumbles them out all while making a weird face.  Next problem: 95 percent of the shots are close-ups.  This is not an exaggeration.  The shot selection isn't varied with the only change in the opening, ending, and battle scenes (sometimes).  The film suffers greatly and is a result of a director and cinematographer not suitable to work on second-rate hip-hop music videos.  This made-for-tv movie (very obvious) is a perfect example of everything you wouldn't want to happen in a film including some you wouldn't even think of.  Included are bad costumes, unbelievable sets, and extremely weak writing.  Bad special effects are also present as well as bad music at crucial times.  The cameras can be jumpy, probably due to the cameramen dozing off inbetween takes (no one could blame them).  Plus, the story seems stretched, and that was before I read the factual account.  It seemed like all the facts were skewered with the only thing historically accurate in the name.  One more thing, they are supposed to be French but nothing other then a few over pronounced French words thrown in their conversations suggest that they are.  If they speak English, that's one thing.  But if they all have different English accents (no French accents, not even an attempted one) but the try to throw in French words randomly in their already awkward and cheesy dialogue, that's completely different.  Joan of Arc is unforgivable with all its mistakes, and there was many of them, it led to and excruciatingly bad movie that was way to long (poor editing), one of the worst that I have ever seen.",1081814400,,2218,4.78421052631579

LeeLee brings the human-side of the equation into the young warrior/martyr. Also, it is refreshing to actually have a very young woman played by a young actress. In fact, the whole cast, screenplay, settings, etc were so realistic. In Joan's death scene, LeeLee was the only Joan of Arc who made me cry so deeply. Others have only made me shed a tear or two. But LeeLee, as Joan, showed true fear; crying out for God and Jesus. Her close friend, who helped Joan begin her quest and fought with her in from the very beginning, held a crucifix ""at the level of [her] eyes"", and tried to give her a chance and hope of rescue. Instead, he witnessed her death. The cast is truly amazing. Not only were there semi-known and well-known actors, but also high-profile actors, such as Peter O'Toole, Maximillian Schell, Shirley Maclean. I saw this version of Joan of Arc on televison as a mini-series (and recorded it), as well as bought the VHS tape version (abridged).
If it is at all possible, try to look for the complete version of this epic. PS: This is even better than the one with Igrid Bergman. I also agree with some of the other reviews, The Messenger was dreadful. It depicted Joan of Arc as an obsessive maniac instead of a devoted and determined young woman, who gains wisdom throughout her experiences.",1078099200,,1477,4.577358490566038
3620349,5,B001GTOABY,"As I watched this movie, I was hooked by the minutes that ticked by.  Yes, I have seen The Messanger, and I absolutely hated it.  (I may not, nor does anyone else, know exactly who and how Joan of Arc was really like, but the insane-possessed version of Joan of Arc in Messanger and hard to follow movie was not it).  This version, with Leelee Sobieski was outstanding.  I am aware that the history of the movie is not entirely correct; however, the movie in itself was great!  All I can say, is if you haven't seen it, you need to.  (and don't waste your time and money on Messanger...believe me--don't get me started on that movie.)",1074556800,,634,4.3760683760683765
3620350,2,B001GTOABY,"All in all, I think this movie was another Revolution (1985).  It was a movie that was, in all senses of the word, mediocre.  The battle scenes look fairly well done, the armor and costumes could definitely use some work, and the creators of this film gave a very faint sense of reality.
  I usually enjoy tv movies, but this was an exception.  I honestly cannot imagine why this movie is so well spoken of.  I was not in any way, shape, or form moved by it.  After comparing this to The Messenger, I can see with ease that the Messenger is far more REALISTIC!  The Messenger had gory battle scenes, limbs amputated, arrows piercing chests, men with their faces bashed in, rivers of blood.  Most people seem not to be too fond of that.  But that is what it was like back then!  I am a historian on medieval combat, bare that in mind in this review and I can tell you from a professional standpoint those scenes were very accurate to the time; the rape scenes, the burning villages, the sniveling politics, all that was what it was like.
  Joan of Arc seems to romanticize a dark period in time.  The armor looks cheep, the facts are very misconstrued, and the viewers would rather believe a fairy tail than a dark reality.  La Hire described Agincourt by saying, ""The English outnumbered us.  We numbered in 5,000,"" and later saying, ""Glasdale's sword was the bloodiest.""  Analyzing that, that is 75% lie.  The French outnumbered the English horrendously (25,000 French, 6,000 English) and neither La Hire nor Glasdale was at that battle.
  I also just love how everyone believes Joan of Arc was a charming, inspiring, brilliant, moving, and daring leader.  I must ask: is everyone as ignorant as people in my profession claim?  Apparently.  People like to believe Churchill was a benevolent man, but in reality he was bitter, cynical, had a drinking problem, and cheated on his wife.
  Joan of Arc was not a glowing leader.  She was impatient, impulsive, questionably insane, and would bark at those who defied her will.  And for people who do not believe in God like me, the fact she was sent by God is bull.  Even if God is real, what she did was no miracle.  There is not feat that can be worthy of calling a miracle.  She defeated an overextended army.
  The Messenger is a dark movie, but that Joan is what she was really like; all over the place.  She did not shine in battle, she, like any human, was afraid and uncertain.  You can't expect a teenage girl to act like Saint George in combat, because most strong, butch, able bodied men are as scared as children.
  Back to the movie itself, it is, like I said, mediocre.  The production value was reasonable, the accuracy is way off, and there is slight miscasting, on King Charles' part.  I never saw the show he was in, so I approached it with an open mind to his acting, but it came out scarcely convincing.
  Leelee Sobieski plays the part well, but not accurately.  She plays the time-honored benevolent legend, when in fact she was more likely a slightly insane, charismatic girl seeking to serve her country, and was more a ""for show"" commander than an actual one, (keyword ""likely"" pertaining to the fact this is a more common but less like theory)
  If you would like a good film, this movie is not a bad choice, but do not expect to see the reality of the Hundred Years War.  If you want to see the bloody and gory truth, watch The Messenger.",1073433600,,3410,4.501633986928105

3620353,5,B001GTOABY,"Only rarely does a television miniseries rival the power, beauty, and excellence of Hollywood's most celebrated theatrical releases.  1999's Joan of Arc is one of those rare gems; it is simply an exquisite film of epic proportions, boasting one of the most impressive cast lists I have ever seen.  Yet even among such stellar names as Jacqueline Bisset, Peter O'Toole, Robert Loggia, Shirley MacLaine, and Maximilian Schell, the young Leelee Sobieski keeps all eyes riveted upon herself with her moving, deeply human portrayal of one of history's most famous and tragic heroines.
Over the course of three hours, we follow the young peasant girl who became The Maid of Orleans, Joan of Arc, from the day of her birth to her final fiery moments.  I do not know enough details of the historical Joan of Arc's life to truly judge the historical accuracy of this film, but from what I can tell and have read, it does try mightily to follow the story as closely as possible, working especially hard to recreate the social and political situation of Joan's time.  The historical Joan of Arc remains a controversial figure, with learned men and women interpreting her life and story in a couple of quite divergent ways.  This movie's Joan is the bravest and most pious of souls, and she meets her fate willingly as a martyr and not a victim; her faith in God's plan for her never wavers.  The presentation of her visions is kept low-key and free of creative exploitation.  The compassion of her soul is revealed countless times over the course of the movie, and the incredible humanity of her character is this film's true strength.  Still, it remains difficult to understand exactly how the French nation could turn against and burn at the stake a girl who fought for the unification of the French people.  The film offers some illuminating yet difficult to understand (at least for me) reasons and motivations through the story of Bishop Cauchon.  Peter O'Toole is absolutely marvelous as Cauchon, reflecting much of Joan's tragic end in his own life.  The character remained something of an enigma to me until the end, but no moment was as moving and telling as a short shot of Cauchon privately breaking down in tears as Joan is being executed.  Shirley MacLaine warrants special mention in honor of her memorable cameo appearance toward the end.  Suffice it to say that I could write many glowing paragraphs in praise of all of the incredible performances in this movie.  The only performance that failed to enthrall me was Neil Patrick Harris's portrayal of King Charles; even with his Moe Howard-inspired haircut, all I could see was Doogie Howser, making it hard for me to accept the wiliness and despotism of the character.
No epic is complete without incredible visuals and sound, and Joan of Arc is amply blessed, with an exception or two, in both regards.  The music is just wonderful and soul-stirring, particularly the one battle scene in which the angelic voice of Charlotte Church singing Panis Angelicus looms over the fray.  The 15th century battle scenes were done quite well, as was the look and feel of the mediaeval French setting.  One would never know that filming actually took place in the Czech Republic.  The fact that this is not a big-budget Hollywood theatrical release is apparent in two scenes, though; both of these involve characters standing in the foreground watching a group of people in the background, and it appears obvious to my eyes that what we are seeing in front of our characters is a screen projection.  My only other quibbles have to do with the actual fight scenes.  While men were slashing each other down left and right, I only saw blood appear on one sword over the course of the movie.  Even more interestingly, whenever an important character was killed or injured in battle, both sides seemed to just stop fighting as long as we and the other characters were focused on the injured party.
All in all, though, I was more than impressed with Joan of Arc.  No matter how accurate or inaccurate it might be in terms of the history, it is inarguably a touching dramatic masterpiece.  Even though you know how it will end even before you watch it, the final moments are sure to send tears coursing down your cheeks and move your heart in ways few movies can ever succeed in doing.  Leelee Sobieski is fast becoming one of my favorite actresses, and this movie is one I will not soon forget.",1061596800,,4432,4.7633986928104575

Far better than that abomination, ""The Messenger."" The production value is pretty low for a feature film but since this movie was made for TV it's incredibly good. The locations and costumes they got are amazing. The only bad part about the movie is the stiff actress that played Joan. She didn't look the part and she didn't play it very well either.

3620386,4,B001GTOABY,"It is a very good historical movie about the sad story of a martyr. The performance of Leelee Sobieski is  great ; once again she demonstrates a real talent. Along with it, what I like most is the good depiction of the historical characters and their relationships; there is a great human touch in this movie. It focuses less on warfare and gore, and more on psychology and history (even though the depiction of the battle at Les Tourettes is highly realistic). Among others, the movie shows how France was built from a variety of different regions. The costumes, especially on the french side, are rich and beautiful. The story unfolds in a clear, logical way; the trap in Compiegne is clearly presented. The most interesting dialogue is the one between Joan and the King of France, when she tells him that he should save Compiegne, but he says he has no more budget for that and all his large cities are overrun by the plague. Finally, when the game was over, the English wanted Joan more than the French, got her, had her tried by the local clergymen and burnt. It is astounding to see that Joan never believed she would actually burn when placed on the pyre, because she tought that God would protect her. So there is a terrible and very moving scene when one of the clerymen burns her hand a little to show her what will really happen to her. To summarize it up : it is a superb movie for historians, however I did not give it a 5-star, because the story is a sad one, and the movie would have benefitted from a little bit more glamour sometimes.",1044403200,,1551,4.442105263157894

Anyway a much more convincing performance by all in this TV movie and it impressed me that a TV miniseries could totally capture this tale without going overboard or trivializing the story.

3620388,5,B001GTOABY,"I have watched this miniseries in several formats (original broadcast, heavily edited VHS, and DVD with all the aired scenes restored), and it's one of the best I've ever seen!  From her life as a child in the village of Domremy to her death on the stake in Rouen at the age of 19, Joan D'Arc as portrayed by Leelee Sobieski is absolutely riveting!  Although the miniseries does take some liberties with regard to the actual life of St. Joan, and while Leelee's Joan may not be as ""gritty"" as some would think that Joan really was, I found this to be one of the more honest portrayals of her life that I've seen since Ingrid Bergman's Joan D'Arc.
I also have to give a nod here to an awesome supporting cast.  Neil Patrick Harris is no longer ""that kid from Doogie Howser"" to me--he IS King Charles of France.  Powers Boothe and Jacqueline Bissett as Joan's parents--simply stunning!  Peter O'Toole as Bishop Cauchon--can the man get any MORE magnificent than he already is??  Chad Willett as Jean DeMetz was very good, and Peter Strauss as LaHire was great!  I loved Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine as Mother Babette and Madame de Beaurevoir, and Maximilian Schell's role of Brother Le Maitre is the most devious character I've seen him play since Dr. Hans Reinhardt in The Black Hole.
All in all, Joan of Arc is a good miniseries.  Even the fact that there are virtually no extras on the DVD can't detract from a solid, charming, and ultimately inspirational story.",1041292800,,1472,4.634615384615385

The biography presented in this wonderful TV Movie (I saw it on local TV this year)is pleasantly faithful to what I feel is the ""bible"" of saint biographies - Butler's Lives of the Saints.  Leelee Sobieski, Neil Patrick Harris and Peter O'Toole give stunningly magnificent performances.  This movie, however, was much more forgiving to O'Toole's character Cauchon that Butler's biography of Saint Joan ever was.  The movie presents Cauchon as a man with good intentions but clouded judgement.  Butler presents him as an evil manipulator who sacrificed Joan merely to have the English help him attain the rank of Cardinal.

3620391,5,B001GTOABY,"The movie ""Joan of Arc"" is a wonderfully portrayed film of Jehanne d'Arc.  Leelee Sobieski did a breathtaking job as Christian Duguay's leading lady.  The movie was indeed true to the records of Jehanne's trials and although some may find it hard to believe, Joan's revelations were nothing short of a miracle of God.  Taking into account the movie ""The Messenger,"" one could only conclude that Joan was a victim of a mental disorder.  Let me assure viewers that this is a false ASSUMPTION.  Jehanne was wrongly tried for heresy against the church and witchcraft.  ""Joan of Arc"" did leave out some details of her life, but it did give the true facts.  Besson's movie did a horrific job of portraying Joan, leaving the audience no choice but to think that she really was insane.  I am personally disgusted with Besson's portrayal of Joan but recommend anyone to see both movies for comparison.  However, note that the extremes of personal conflict of Joan is ADDED effect for Besson's movie.  The majority of his movie did not actually occur.",1035676800,,1041,4.797752808988764

I have read a book on Joan of Arc and studied her a little and the movie tells her story wonderfully. Leelee Sobieski, very talented, portrayed her perfectly. She captured Joan's innocence and spirit. I saw the television version. It was split into two different nights, and I was dying to see the end when I wathced it. I am going to get the movie on VHS soon, I can't wait! If you are a fan of Joan of Arc, Leelee Sobieski, or both, like me, you will enjoy this movie to your full extent. WOW!!!",1035331200,,654,4.24
3620393,5,B001GTOABY,"I watched this movie when it was first on TV, and once again just recently.  I was deeply touched by it both times, and I found Leelee Sobieski's performance very convincing and captivating.  She captured the essence of strength and vulnerability at the same time.  Joan's strong faith in God was refreshing to see in a movie, and I'm glad that part wasn't brushed aside as it could have been.
Two parts I found especially moving were when she cried out to God after the death of her friend Emile and later her brother, Pierre.  And then of course, her death, which was amazing.  Even though, according to other reviewers, the rescue attempt by La Hire and Jean de Metz was fictional, I found it to be a very good addition.  Having Mother Babbette and Jean there to witness Joan's death added to the emotion of the scene, as you could identify with what they were going through as well as what Joan was experiencing.  All in all those final scenes, right up to the shot of Joan's banner flying before the church in her home village, were profoundly moving and poignant.
The acting besides Sobieski's was superb as well. Peter O'Toole and Neil Patrick Harris show how ""bad guys"" can be three dimensional too.  Peter Strauss (La Hire) and Chad Willett (de Metz) also stood out, illustrating the devotion Joan inspired in the men she led.
I should add that I have only watched this movie on TV, so I have no opinion as to the DVD's merits.  But the movie itself is a wonderful production!  Once I have a DVD player of my own I will buy it, but if that isn't stopping you, what is? :)",1023926400,,1580,4.43598615916955
3620394,5,B001GTOABY,"After having read at least six books and having seen at least five different films on Joan of Arc over a period of about 5 years, I can say from my own point of view that each has a unique way of interpreting and expressing something that at times seems inexpressable.
That is , the spirit of this young, devoted teenage girl who received deep and subtle messages from a higher source and then had the courage to obey these edicts even though her life was constantly at risk.
To express this and portray this spirit in a captivating yet fairly accurate way, that is, according to the available historical records of the time, is difficult and challenging I am sure. This particualr film with Leeleee Sobieski, in its own stylistic way, has done just that.
Perhaps some people do not like this kind of 'Hollywood' presentation of history which tends to relate it to present day language and style. Regardless of styleI feel that along with the style and attention to detail in the costumes and scenery, the director and the actors and actresses did well in capturing a certain spirit of the time and in Joan herself. I am not a film critic or producer. I can only give my experience in this case from a spiritual point of view.
Consciousness is an important feature of any film according to my standards. I relate to and enjoy more the films that tend to raise the consciouness of the viewer. I can watch a good film many times and never get bored, especially if it is based on reality, as in historical films such as this one. Some of the others fell short in portraying what I felt is the essential ingredient in Joan's character and her life, her spiritual receptivity to a higher voice and command. The writer, producer and director as well as the actors themselves have to have an understanding of this to be able to portray it effectively in film. I feel this version was one of the most successful in doing just that. I have seen it 15 times over the past two years already and I enjoy viewing it with others who appreciate its unique value and wonderful acting roles, especially Leelee.
Congratulations to a truly superb effort of love and dedication. Joan's spirit has obviously helped in the efforts and indeed lives on.",1014768000,,2229,4.561097256857855

3620397,4,B001GTOABY,"Early in the 15th Century, Burgundy and England fought for control of a divided France, while Charles, the dauphin and rightful heir to the throne, hadn't enough power nor the backing to make his ascendancy.  But it had long been prophesied that a maid from Lorraine would rise up to unite France and make the country whole; and in 1429 that prophecy came to pass, when a young woman from the farming country in the north made her way to Charles and convinced him that she was on a mission from God.  Her name was Joan D'Arc; and this is her story.  ""Joan of Arc,"" directed by Christian Duguay, stars Leelee Sobieski as Joan, who-- seventeen-years-old at the time-- through Divine guidance managed to lead an army to victory after victory, and within months was instrumental in placing Charles upon the throne, as King of France.
 When Joan was ten, she first heard the ""voices"" that would ultimately lead her to her destiny.  It was the voice of her patron saint, Catherine; and by the age of seventeen, having been guided by others, including Saint Michael, she was in the court of Charles (Neil Patrick Harris).  How she was able to do what she did still seems inexplicable; and yet it is a matter of recorded history that this maid, Joan D'Arc, did indeed lead the armies of France and helped unite the country.  That she was betrayed by Charles and burned at the stake for heresy when she was nineteen is also well documented, as is the fact that seven years after her death France at last became a whole country, united-- as she had predicted.  And Charles went on to reign for another thirty years.
 Originally made for TV as a miniseries, this film nevertheless is as good, or actually even better, than many projects that find their way into theatrical release.  Well written (by Michael Alexander Miller and Ronald Parker) and directed by Duguay, it presents Joan as a very real person, struggling herself to realize where she fits into the grand scheme of things.  Duguay successfully avoids lapsing into any melodrama, and instead delivers a solid drama that is realistic and absorbing.  But the real strength of the film is clearly Sobieski, who was herself seventeen when this movie was filmed.
 Sobieski, with a maturity beyond her years, keeps Joan grounded with a portrayal that is not only credible, but which makes her extremely accessible to the audience; one with whom you can easily empathize.  Her Joan is strong, yet vulnerable, and Sobieski's ability to capture the complexities of the character is what makes her so good, and makes her Joan so believable.  There is an innocence about her that, along with her maturity conveys an attitude as well as attributes that the real Joan of Arc conceivably would have had.  And Sobieski embodies it all with her engaging, powerful performance, which is arguably the best portrayal of Joan ever brought to the screen, and for which she deservedly received an Emmy nomination.
 The supporting cast includes Jacqueline Bisset (Isabelle), Powers Boothe (Jacques D'Arc), Maury Chaykin (Sir Robert de Baudricourt), Olympia Dukakis (Mother Babette), Jonathan Hyde (Duke of Bedford), Robert Loggia (Father Monet), Shirley MacLaine (Madame de Beaurevoir), Peter O'Toole (Bishop Cauchon), Maximilian Schell (Brother John Le'Maitre), Peter Strauss (La Hire) and Chad Willett (Jean de Metz).  A lavish and emotionally involving presentation of the life of this remarkable young woman driven by Divine providence to carry out a singular mission, ""Joan of Arc"" is an inspirational meditation on the many and varied manifestations of destiny, and those who in rare instances are motivated by forces clearly beyond the comprehension of mortal man.  Riveting and extremely well presented, this is a memorable film that will promote a reflection on life, while providing a true sense of the eternal.",1008720000,,3849,4.9672897196261685

3620416,5,B001GTOABY,The first time that I saw this movie was on TV. I love it. It goes through Joan Of Arc's life right from when she was born until she was burned. The Girl who play's Joan is a wonderful actor and fills the part wonderfully. All of The actor did an excellent job. The last hour is sad because you see how badly she was treated. It is a very long movie so make sure that you put it is early!,990403200,,388,3.802469135802469
3620417,4,B001GTOABY,"Joan of Arc has been the subject of numerous films, probably more than any other medieval figure.  This is one of the best of the lot.  It's generally historically accurate, although it has its flaws.  The acting was solid and the cinematography and technical elements were surprisingly good for a TV movie.
For the actors, LeeLee Sobieski was an excellent Joan.  I have yet to see another actress successfully capture all elements of Joan's personality.  Her spirituality, confidence, strength, and courage are all portrayed very well.  Peter O'Toole is, of course, excellent as Bishop Cochon and Peter Strauss played a convincing, if somewhat subdued Le Hire.  The biggest surprise was Niel Patrick Harris's phenominal performance as Charles.  He turned in a performance that splendidly captured the man who, despite being trapped in a bad situation prior to Joan's arrival, grew into one of the finest kings in French history.
Historically, the movie does an excellent job at portraying the period and the characters.  The writers, director, and Sobieski, for instance, resisted the temptaion to write Joan off as a mindless fanatic she's often made out to be, despite the fact that no such description occurs in any source, French, English, or Burgundian.  Instead, they accurately portrayed her as the charismatic girl who convinced hardened generals to follow her and confounded the judges at her trial with her faith and intellect.  Similarly, the movie captured the despair in France during the losing days of the Hundred Years War, a despair that turned to optimism surprisingly quickly.
However, the movie does have several major historical flaws, and these are the only reasons I feel it doesn't deserve a fifth star.  There was no attempt to rescue Joan from Rouen, nor were any of her key supporters present.  More importantly, the movie tends to combine characters - partly to keep the cast size down and make the movie more watcheable, but also to give some of their big-name actors more to do.  That said, the choices are forgiveable (they arguably make it a better movie).  The movie combines Jean de Metz and Jean d'Aulon.  De Metz, while faithful to Joan, played only a minor role after bringing Joan to Charles. From that point on, the movie uses him in place of d'Aulon.  Similarly, the movie combines Cochon and Reignault of Chartres, Charles's spiritual advisor.  Other deficiencies are minor (Cochon never received an archbishopric and was demoted to a lesser see, Joan is burned in the winter rather than spring, etc.).
What the movie does exceedingly well, however, is create a sense of doubt.  The movie lets the viewer interpret some of the elements for him or herself.  O'Toole, like the historical record, leaves the audience guessing as to whether or not Cochon believed in Joan and was merely following orders, as well as whether or not the trial left him a broken man.  Similarly, the movie leaves the extent of Charles's machinations and the true nature of Joan's belief open to question.  It is a rare movie that captures this fundamental historiographical problem.  For that alone it's worth a watch.",988848000,,3136,5.02321083172147
3620418,3,B001GTOABY,"My apologies, but Medieval History is my academic field and I am a bit of a stick in the mud about historicity.  This version of the Joan of Arc tale is quite entertaining and watchable, don't get me wrong.  But my fingers were turning into vices against my couch pillows at the sacrifice of historical accuracy for ""a good story"".  The big dramatic panorama of Joan's execution in a snowfall, for example, is poignant but wrong--Joan was executed in May, 1431, so snow would have been unlikely.  This version is also perpetrating an idea of Joan which according to historical accounts is inaccurate.  She wasn't some calm, kind, cool-headed individual, but rather an uneducated peasant girl maniacally spurred on by her fanatical devotion.  For what I believe is a more authentic treatment, try The Messenger.",984873600,,810,4.962962962962963

Most are... ...well, simply put, not compelling.  LeeLee's portrayal of Jehanne is riviting.  The movie drew me in from the beginning.  There are slow parts mind you, however the bulk of the movie brings you into the realm of the time.  The scenery is beautiful and there is no scimping on the wardrobe or settings.  The supporting actors and actresses are the icing on the cake.  Peter O'Toole is outstanding in his role as Bishop Causchon.  Although his role is small, Chad Willet shows how Jehanne was supported by those who believed in her.  Neil Patrick Haarris adds a bit of satire to his role that helps with a couple of the slower scenes in the film. This is an outstanding film for students to understand what role Joan of Arc (Jehanne D'Arc) played in the melding of history. My hats off to LeeLee Sobieski for her portrayal.  Innocense, Strength and understanding are her strengths in this film.  Thanks to Christian Duguay for his casting and brilliance in this outstanding life story!!!",984355200,,1166,4.661764705882353

Historical description of Joan D'arc are quite precise on this particular point : Joan was an exalted and fanatical women not the pleasant and delicate women that this movie wants us to believe. From this point, I can only say that the Messenger from Besson remains far ahead of this movie not only because it is more accurate but also because of the superb acting.",984355200,,650,4.564102564102564
3620431,5,B001GTOABY,"After seeing the Messenger only a week after Hallmark's Joan of Arc, I think it's a testimony to the real life enigma that she could be interpreted in such very different ways- from a girl of incredible strength and courage ready to die for her faith to a woman made neurotic by circumstance and visions fueled by her faith in God despite all she had seen.  Leelee vs. Milla?  I think both women simply found a part of Joan they identified with and ran with it, though I must say, I enjoyed Leelee's portrayal more.  We got to see how Joan won the heart of the people and Leelee does it flawlessly, you don't see that in Messenger.  The Messenger skips how she got to be St. Joan in the eyes of the people.  In Leelee's Joan, I can believe she led her people to victory in battle because Leelee is so exceptional in the battle scenes while Milla seemed completely lost.  And visually, it is hard to believe this movie was made for television as it was so beautiful to look at.  Definitely worth the cost of buying.",981158400,,1014,4.333333333333333

O'Toole playes an EXCELLENT Bishop Cauchon.  And Sobieski plays an excellent Joan Of Arc as well.  Not perfect, but then, who is?  :>  A must see by anyone who is interested even remotely in Joan Of Arc and her story.

3620433,5,B001GTOABY,"""Ah! I would far rather have my head chopped off seven times over, than to be burned!"" --- Joan of Arc
I first watched this movie on TV (a two-part mini series), and I liked it.  The DVD runs for 180 minutes (not 140 min) and is essentially the same as what originally showed on TV.  It depictures the life and death of the 15th-century French heroine and martyr, ""Maid of Orleans"".  The movie keeps a good balance for different stages of Joan of Arc's life. The performance is excellent.  Leelee Sobieski's interpretation for Joan of Arc is probably the best, and Peter O'Toole as the Bishop is definitely a plus. Though a TV movie, Christian Duguay did a wonderful job.  The preference between this movie and its competitor, Message, depends on personal taste.  I like ""Joan of Arc"" better because of Sobieski's outstanding performance.  Anyhow, this movie is worth to watch.  Joan of  Arc is the most famous to be burned alive (most died at the stake were actually first strangulated with a rope so that the fire just burned an already dead body).  Her martyrdom and tragic fate is emphasized by starting with the burning and ending with the execution at the market.  Scenes, such as bounded bare feet, cross in front of the victim, surrounding by fire, and crying for the God, are appropriately used for this purpose.",979257600,,1321,4.675324675324675

Anyway that's why I give this DVD 4 instead of 5 stars.
Other than that I love this movie. Very moving and very beautifully filmed. And the music is gorgeous.
Again my only complaint is that they cut out loads of scenes on the DVD.",977270400,,437,4.093023255813954
3620435,1,B001GTOABY,"I find it difficult to believe that I was watching the same film as the other reviewers. I had to give it one star for the fact that somebody actually took the time and raised the backing to make it, not for any kind of cinematic accolade.
An historically innaccurate American flag waving fest - 100 years before America was discovered - and an insult to French history. There are so many things I could say about the lack of attention to detail in the production that 1000 words is probably not enough. The acting is wooden and of a standard you would associate with childrens' television. The screenplay and script appeared to have been written with the vocabulary and complexity that an average eight year old could understand and it took us all of two minutes to realise what a huge mistake we had made in buying this disc. I did give the film a full hour of my time but it was a true test of patience - I really did want to give it a chance - but three hours and twenty minutes of complete dross?
I fear I've already wasted too much time with this film so I'll cut the review here. If you want something to put the kids to sleep of an evening then this could be it! Don't bank on it though and certainly don't show it to any of your French friends - they'll either laugh out loud or be completely disgusted.",975110400,,1312,4.252

There are alot of diffferent film interpretations of Joan's life, but this one is the best. The trial dialog is actuall very close in spirit to the actual transcripts - recorded from those days.  I have recommended this film to many many people.  It teaches, makes a contribution and inspires, all at the same time.  In many ways, we are still all dreaming of a world which serves all people by assuring FREEDOM & PEACE.  It IS possible when we learn from teachers like Joan.

3620437,5,B001GTOABY,"Even though ""Joan Of Arc"" was just a television movie it was  well made. It captured your attention from beginning to end and gave you  some insight on what Joan accomplished in her life. Leelee Sobieski  (actress) intelligently portrayed Joan as an innocent farm girl to a brave,  yet still sweet, leader. In the scenes of Joan's court trials Leelee acted  amazingly. She showed how Joan could be witty while answering questions  from the clergy. The rest of the cast also played there parts well and  helped make the film seem more realistic. It had older, more well known  actors and some great younger actors. This movie was filmed on wonderful  locations, as well. For example, the cathedrals and forts in the battle  scenes looked incredible.
Basically this film was outstanding! I would  have to say that it was much better than ""The Messenger"" in which  Milla Jovavich portrayed Joan as a more disturbed and violent person. Sure,  I agree Joan may have not been as calm as she is in ""Joan of  Arc"", but I refuse to believe that she was as crazy as the person that  was in ""The Messenger"". Based on some things I have read about  the actual trial and life of Joan , I must say that Sobieski captured the  essence of Joan better than Jovavich.

3620438,2,B001GTOABY,"I must say I did not like this movie. We know little about the true Joan  of Arc, but she certainly had fierce charisma as a person and was an  inspiring military leader. This movie's heroine is just young, virginal,  and nice.
I found the movie silly in many respects. The holy apparitions  where Joan is bathed in heavenly light do not really go down well these  days. The slow motion battle scenes with angelic music in the background  are a stupid means to avoid one of the greatest conflicts and  contradictions in Joan's life: how can a person inspired by God lead people  to horrible killing and death.
What most stroke me in this movie are the  parallells between Joan's depiction and the life of Jesus. Both were guided  by heaven of course, both started young and succeeded to move masses of  people against all odds, both tried to establish a kingdom not for  themselves. See Joan be betrayed by a friend and ask their companions not  to defend her against her captors. See Joan being judged by scheming  religious figures who accept foreign occupation. Incredibly, see Joan in  this movie being witnessed at her martyrdom by her substitute mother and a  young disciple. She is even better than Christ: whereas Jesus on the cross  suffered and doubted, in one of the silliest scenes of this movie, Joan  turns her well groomed face heavenward in the middle of the flames and  thanks God. Give me a break. I can accept that Joan of Arc was a saint but  this movie is pure sugar coating. I liked ""The Messenger"" (the  other modern movie about Joan of Arc) much better.",965520000,,1577,4.580645161290323
3620439,4,B001GTOABY,"This movie was my first reintroduction to the story of Joan of Arc since grade school. I loved the film and watched it about 8 times. A great deal of thought and creativity went into the film, especially since, as I found  out later, it is mostly fictitious. The personality of the real Joan of Arc  is impossible to capture on film and I am glad Leelee Sobieski did not try,  but instead put herself into the role in a genuine and honest way. If there  is a weakness in the movie it is that it does not show Joan much as a  military commander. In truth, up to the time of the Coronation of Charles  VI it can be said that Joan of Arc was functionally the Commander in Chief  of the French forces and a captain of vision and genius. In this context  the movie's version of her capture at Compiegne is quite comical. The  proposition that Joan was betrayed by Charles so that he could become a  better king was also a contribution of the screen writers. However it as a  clever enough plot twist and works well enough. The trial scene is  remarkably faithful to the historical record except that it suggest that  Joan was raped in jail. The trial of Joan of Arc, preserved verbatim in the  French Archives, is one of the most fascinating, heroic and incredible  trials in history. The movie does a good enough job of it. The story of  Joan's death is so heartbreaking that we cannot hope to capture it on film.  However it is worthy to note that while in the flames she cried out to  Jesus seven times, a fact which the screen writers unfortunately chose to  omit. The life of Joan of Arc is one of the most incredible lives in  history. Even a pale and timid version, like this film, is a grand tale.",964310400,,1700,4.286163522012578

It wasn't obvious  this was a TV movie until some of the action sequences... it was one of  those deals where all they had to do was CUT out a few shots and they could  have fooled you better.  The fast-motion editing to speed up the sequence  looked terrible.  It was like going from film to video, back and forth  during the battles... I also agree with a previous viewer about the effects  (the spiritual conversations) -- showing LESS is better, and when it was  beams of light, that was perfect (we didn't need to see the angel).  The  costumes and lighting were excellent, the DVD looks very crisp and  clean.
This was a great adaptation of a classic story.  It could have  been a tad shorter, but it kept me going anyway.  At least an excellent  rental.",962064000,,1016,4.429347826086956
3620441,5,B001GTOABY,"I remember seeing this DVD and wondering which one should I get, ""Joan of Arc"" which was a television movie or ""The Messenger"", a big budget movie.  It was a hard decision but what drew  me to purchasing this movie was the cover.
Sobieski's look as Joan of  Arc looked more convincing and she looked so pure and innocent.  I wondered  how this person who projects innocence in the cover will play a military  leader?  Well, I don't know much about Leelee Sobieski and after watching  this movie, now I want to watch the movies that she has appeared in because  on ""Joan of Arc"", you get solid acting.
The long time of this  movie made me wonder if it was going to drag but if anything this movie  drew me in from start to finish and here is why: The good acting by the  cast members, the great scenery and the selection of Leelee Sobieski as the  innocent ""Maid of Lorraine"".  She brought something to this movie  that drew you in.  Her facial expressions and even the ending still stays  in my mind.  Wow!  It's unexplainable but I really enjoyed the movie.  It  was done very well and I'm impressed that it's a TV movie.  The movie gets  an A+.
What about the DVD?  Well, since this is a TV movie, I didn't  expect too much from the DVD.  The audio was good and the video was good  but at times I saw some lines on the screen on parts where there is a lot  of action.  The production notes were nice to see but I have to give the  DVD a D- for no significant extras.
It appears Sobieski had much to say  about the part according to the production notes, why not include a  featurette then?  Or even the television commercials or promotional  features.
So, yes...the extras rating gets a D-. But you know what, the  movie is wonderful and it deserves to be seen and due to it's size, DVD is  the way to go. ""Joan of Arc"" a definite A+.  Highly recommended!",960249600,,1857,4.247838616714698

The interesting part of this movie to me is not what happens while Joan is accepted by the people as their hero and military  leader, but the events preceeding and following that.  I think that the  attention paid to political wheeling and dealing behind Joan's back, and  the jealousy and pious attitude of the king's main advisor from the church  move the story telling to a higher level -- this is not just an action  adventure!
Joan realizes at a young age that she has a special connection  with a matron saint who gives her inspiration and direction.  With that  direction Joan is able to ovecome social and political stigmas related to  her gender and become a force in a France split by dissention and torn by  war.  She shows a steely determination to serve her king as she clears the  way for him to be crowned king over a united France.  She stands up to  royalty and clergy alike as she moves toward that goal.
The acting is  good, the story is believable, and the emotions protrayed ring true.  In  addition, the costumes and backgrounds for the movie are great.

The cuts in the film sequence could have been  improved, but why sacrifice such a small detail when the movie as a whole  was, truly, beautiful?

Furthermore, Leelee Sobieski  was perfectly cast as the young Maid of Lorraine. She was radiant! The  other cast members support this radiance, and give the movie, as a whole, a  very believable atmosphere -- as if you knew the characters yourself,  understood their minds, and wished the same dreams as they.

The  entire movie does not have the smooth transitional feeling one must have in  a piece that covers so much time and I think the director would have been  more the wiser to just leave the image of Joan of Arc's visions up to the  audience rather than interpreting the image through special effects.  And  please do not cast Doogey Howser (Neil Patrick Harris) as a prince anymore.  The poor guy has already been type-cast in my eyes.

It also misrepresents, and  even leaves out key  characters in her life. The cute Leelee Sobieski did not quite convey the  personality of the headstrong, but faithful saint.  Among the most  egregious violations of historical record are Joan denouncing her  ""voices"" because Pierre Cauchon held her hand to a flame (in  actuality, she was afraid of excommunication, and desired to attend Mass),  and yelling out to the English commander, Glasdale, ""I'll send you to  hell"" (which she would never had said).  The film also portrays Pierre  Cauchon as a good guy, while in actuality, he desired Joan's death for  political reasons.  Furthermore, Pierre Cauchon never knew Dauphin Charles,  but the movie portrays Cauchon as part of Charles's court!

I gave this a low rating because the writers  were extremely loose with the accepted events in Joan's life. I could count  about half a dozen events that history has no record of or even hint at  that was included in this version. Although I have no problem with writers  inventing a childhood for Joan, not much was known, or speculate about her  motivations and thoughts, but putting in scenes during her last 2 years of  fairly well documented life was too much for my sensibilities.  Even the  very well documented trial I thought was poorly done with more poetic  license then I could accept.  People have criticized ""The Messenger""  because it portrayed Joan more as a victim of her beliefs, this may or may  not have been the case, at least it remained truer to the accepted facts.  Overall, I feel that ""The Messenger"" with all it's drawbacks is a  much better portrayal of Joan then this film with all it's speculations.",952300800,,1184,4.7073170731707314

Rarely does a TV movie come along that is as well  conceived as its mega budget says it should be. Absolutely stunning battle  scenes (especially for a TV production), rich location shooting and a  superb cast make Joan of Arc unquestionably one of the best TV movies ever  made.
But what crowns Joan of Arc as a ""5 star"" production is it's  outstanding lead, Leelee Sobieski. Perfectly cast, Sobieski brings  qualities to the French saint never seen before - an innocent, yet strong  and commanding personality, a ""virginial"" presence, a face resembling  something of a saint/angel/renaissance painting plus not to mention that  she was ""actually"" the right age to play the legendary teenage warrior.  Sobieski's performance is so exceptional, she holds the entire 4 hours  together, and at the same time, leaves other Joan of Arc interpretations by  the likes of Ingrid Bergman and Milla Jovavich in her wake.
Definitely  the best TV movie I've ever, and a far better bet than Luc Besson's/Milla  Jovavich's version...",952128000,,1261,5.112745098039215
3620462,5,B001GTOABY,"Nowadays with all the technology available in the movie industry, the director tend to relly on the effects and forget the the plot, the story. Fortunately this does not happen with this film. Leelee Sobieski gives a  great performance as The Maid of Loriane. You can feel the inocence, with  Leelee, her desperation when she is sentenced to be burned at the stake and  during the movie you'll always feel sorry for her. Watch this girl very  closely, im betting we'll continue to see very good things from her. Neil  Patrick Harris, does a great job as Charles, a calculist king who plays  with people like their pawns in a game of chess. And finally, Peter O'Toole  is just suberb as the bishop that always knew that Joan was inocent and had  in fact seen the visions and still allows for her to be executed. The  effects were good although the scenes involving crowds could have been  better. If you like films like Braveheart or Rob Roy, then just like Austin  Powers says: ""this thing is your bag, baby"".",951350400,,1009,4.581005586592179
3620463,1,B001GTOABY,"About what you'd expect from a tv docudrama -- cartoonish characters with absolutely no depth or development.  Plays very fast and loose with the facts and all the actors chew the scenery.
The character of Joan is  totally out of place, like she was picked up off some college campus and  dropped 600 years in the past, or like Buffy Saves France.
A real waste  of time.",951004800,,370,4.477611940298507

3620465,5,B001GTOABY,"The portrayal of Joan of Arc in this movie was very touching.  She was definitely NOT a Victim, as she chose to walk into the fire.  Very brave, even when she knew that she would be betrayed, she encouraged others to  BELIEF in her cause - to unite all of France.
Highly recommended!  Not  to be missed, even if you are not a Christian.
This is now my favourite  DVD movie, as the sound and images were very clear.",946771200,,414,4.177215189873418
3620466,5,B001GTOABY,"Better than the film version because it focuses on the betrayal, and the deception Joan encounters with King Charles,  and with the church hierarchy who tries her for heresy. None of her deeds in battle compare to her  heroism displayed while on trial! She is a beloved heroine of mine who I  hope will inspire faith in the children of today.",944870400,,342,4.573770491803279

Leelee Sobieski plays the character of Joan extremely well and it couldn't fit anyone but her. A  wonderful role model for all teenage girls and the perfect patron saint.  She's both to me.",944870400,,304,4.410714285714286
3620468,5,B001GTOABY,"This movie truly inspired me.  I had never given Joan of Arc a second thought until this production.  Since then I have checked out all the books at our local library refering to Joan and I have made only one request for  Christmas; get me Joan of Arc.
This film portrays a martyr and a tool  in the hands of God, unlike ""The Messenger"" which I had anxiously  awaited seeing but left feeling cheated and lied to as Joan was depicted in  that film as a schizophrenic mess.
As I have researched many references  and biographies recounting the retrial after her martyrdom and this film  seems to be about as accurate historically as you could expect in a film  about a person 500 years dead.  In contrast the film ""The  Messenger"" takes many surreal liberties with her legend and even as a  non-Catholic I was deeply offended by the Hollywood production.
The  acting is very good, the scenery, costumes and general feel of the movie is  true to the age and the story is accurate. Each cast member fit their role  perfectly, in particular Peter O'Toole as Cauchon and of course Sobieski as  the Maid.
This movie made me love and appreciate Joan of Arc.  Buy it and  be inspired.",944784000,,1174,4.5095238095238095

We were all crying at the end when they burned her at the stake.  Even the guys in our class  seemed moved by it.  The only complaints I have heard about the movie was  that they didn't like how Joan acted, and they thought that she made bad  decisions.  Well I have news for you.  The movie is a true story, they  can't change the way she acted.  I thought Leelee Sobeski did an awesome  job.  All in all, I loved this movie.  It is my favorite movie of all time.",943747200,,590,3.9655172413793105

8307158,3,B001GTOABY,"Joan of Arc, 1999 film

A peasant woman gives birth in 1412. Soldiers are coming, people move away for safety. People believe a young maiden will save France from suffering. England and Burgundy claim French lands. Refugees beg for food, they are refused. Joan heard a voice that tells her what to do. A messenger warns of the approach of soldiers! Thatch roofs are set afire! Joan is told to go to the Dauphin. The Maid of Lorraine is presented to Sir Robert, who orders her sent back to her father. But she returns and is sent to meet the Dauphin. They pass a devastated village. St. Catherine is her patron saint. There is a battle when they meet enemy soldiers. Charles VII gets a message. Can the Maid of Lorraine rally the people? Joan passes the test in recognizing the Daupin. She gives him a message to attack the English at Orleans. Joan shows him a sign.

Joan passes the test at the Convent at Poitiers. She inspires the soldiers, they are eager to believe. The French will end the Siege of Orleans. A message is sent to the English asking them to leave peacefully. Can they set the hay on fire? The French prepare for battle. Joan exhorts them to do well. The English archers shoot their arrows. One hits Joan! The French fall back. Joan remounts her horse and continues on. The English are defeated! In 1429 the Dauphin is anointed King of France. Is Joan in danger for believing in her voices? Joan disagrees with the Kings policy. She wants to conquer Paris for France. But the attempt failed. Charles VII meets his enemies, England and Burgundy, and makes a deal. Joan visits her parents. Later a letter asks for Joans help. The King ennobles Joan; her village will be exempt from taxes. Joan de Lis is her title. There are no soldiers and taxes to support a war.

Can Joan lead a small army to conquer French lands? They go to Compiegne. But Joan is captured and taken to Burgundy. Her capture was Gods will. The English will first try to destroy Joans reputation by charging her as a witch. Joan will be tried as a heretic. She is examined by religious men. Will torture get the answers they want? The Dominicans investigate heretics. Can Charles VII rescue Joan? Or others? The Church will hand over Joan to the secular authorities for punishment after she recanted. Joan is burned alive at the stake! As Joan predicted, Burgundy allied with France and drove the English out. Charles reigned as King for 30 years. Five hundred years later Joan was canonized as a Saint by the Church that condemned her, posthumous rehabilitation.

This movie runs on too long, its story could be better. That fort in the beginning looked too small to be anything but a gatehouse. Maybe if I knew more about 15th century French history I would like it more. Was there a mention of Gilles de Rais, or Bluebeard, as a backer of Joan of Arc? This was mostly filmed in Czechoslovakia to use its castles and countryside. The actors breaths tell of the cold weather there. When William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066 he brought French lands to the English crown, and influenced the English language, a Teutonic language since the Angles and Saxons invaded England after Rome fell. The original Britons were pushed back into the mountains of Wales (so Welsh must be the original Britannic language).",1521676800,,3301,4.6279863481228665

We got about 10 minutes into the movie and the picture became all distorted with lines.  I fast forwarded and it continued through- out the DVD.  I even tried the movie on another computer.

UPDATE:  After sending back This 2016 print of Joan of Arc I received the 1999 print and it played perfectly and was enjoyed by the whole family. So, be sure to purchase the older version rather than the newer as the newer seems to be consistently corrupted.
