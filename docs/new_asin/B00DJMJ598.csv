8593817,5,B00DJMJ598,"I have loved Johnny Bravo, since it debuted on Cartoon Network. I bought Season One from the Cartoon Network's Hall of Fame Collection, but I was disappointed Season One was the only season offered on DVD. I was apprehensive about purchasing DVD's from Thailand and I'm not certain what (PAL System) means, but I was assured the Season Two and Season Three DVD's would play in my DVD player. My Sony DVD player is designed to play DVD's from all regions, so I can't say, whether or not, these DVD's will play in a Region One DVD Player. When I opened the box the DVD's were mailed in, I was uneasy when I saw almost all of the writing on the cover and on the back was not written in English. When I put the disc in my DVD, I could read enough of the menu to understand I needed to use the language set up feature on my DVD player and choose English. When you choose English, the arrow does not indicate you've clearly chosen English, but when you press ""Play All,"" then you'll hear the classic Johnny Bravo opening theme music and you'll hear his unmistakeable voice in English. At that point, my apprehension turned to joyful anticipation. The video and the audio on these DVD's are virtually identical to the Season One Cartoon Network Season One DVD. These are outstanding quality DVD's and the episodes on each disc are listed in English. I am so happy with my Season Two and Season Three DVD's that I've just purchased Seasons Four and Five. If, you're a true Johnny Bravo fan, then these are must have DVD's. Hopefully, Cartoon Network will release every season of Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory and Camp Lazlo on Region One DVD's in the near future. I'm glad I didn't wait for them to release Johnny Bravo. Ok, pretty Mamas, I'm all done with my review thingy. Do the Monkey with me! Thank you, thank you very much!",1416182400,,1825,4.483483483483483
