3846922,5,B0024LIBDQ,"What a wonderful filmmusic by Walter Scott, what a wonderful cast starring Robert Ryan, Nannette Newman, Chuck Conners and all the others. A film inspired by the book of Jules Verne. Adventures in the underwater city Templemer. A motion picture with a special atmosphere and mood. I promise: you will enjoy every minute of it.
Stunninig visual effects, excellent actors and a very remarkable film music! Just watch!",1251417600,19,415,5.117647058823529
3846923,2,B0024LIBDQ,"I've always liked Robert Ryan, but not as Captain Nemo, and (blue-eyed Geronimo) Chuck Connors looks out of place. A very poor re-make of the Classic with James Mason as Captain Nemo. The special effects in the original were good for their time. These are fair and it appears some are from the original. There are a lot of great DVDs available; I would pass this one by.",1246665600,3,370,4.455882352941177

3846933,5,B0024LIBDQ,"Just finished watching ""Captain Nemo And The Underwater City"" released by Warner Brothers.
""Captain Nemo And The Underwater City"" is one of the favorite movies from my childhood.  I remember when I first saw this movie back on our old black and white console television set in the early 1970s - we didn't get a color television set until around 1980 - didn't really have to since the old black & white set worked fine until it just went kaput.  [While I do have a high-def 3D television set now, I am saving my pennies until the curved tvs go down in price.]
Back to the movie, which starts out with a hurricane at sea in 1864 which causes a ship to sink beneath the waves.  Six survivors are rescued from drowning by mysterious men in scuba gear and brought aboard the Nautilus commanded by none other than Captain Nemo.  He brings them to Templemer - his domed city which resides 10,000 fathoms beneath the sea.
The survivors, while grateful to be rescued, soon learn that they will spend the rest of their lives in an underwater paradise as citizens of Nemo's utopia - with four of them wanting to escape for their own various reasons.
What makes ""Captain Nemo And The Underwater City"" a fun movie is that it's lighthearted fare that doesn't take itself way too seriously.  Now there are two rather gruesome deaths by drowning of two of the survivors in their various escape attempts, but their deaths are caused by their own foolish actions.
""Captain Nemo And The Underwater City"" is not a direct sequel or even a prequel to 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.  Think of it as set in the same universe as....
Of special note, ""Captain Nemo And The Underwater City"" was written by Pip & Jane Baker and R. Wright Campbell - Pip & Jane Baker wrote for the Classic Doctor Who series and are best known for creating the amoral Time Lord The Rani.
Great Saturday Morning Fun!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
FIVE STARS!",1432598400,2,1899,4.55425219941349
3846934,4,B0024LIBDQ,"BOTTOM LINE: I enjoyed CAPTAIN NEMO AND THE UNDERWATER CITY and am happy to have it in my collection. It's an enjoyable, old school-styled adventure story designed to entertain the young - and the young at heart. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Robert Ryan plays the gruff & grumpy Captain Nemo. Here, Nemo and several hundred followers, (where'd they come from?), have constructed the impressive underwater city of Templemer. The captain has long-term plans to build several more such cities and eventually seal them all under one, huge protective bubble and thus have an aquatic nation, comparable to the Atlantis of old. At the film's opening, a handful of surface folk are rescued from a sinking ship and brought back to Templemer. Trouble soon follows. First, there are a pair of brothers; gold-hungry thieves who are almost orgasmic in their lust for the stuff. Imagine their reaction when they discover that Templemer has three huge refineries which manufacture oxygen for the populace, and the byproduct of said process is more pure gold than they know what to do with! There's a determined U.S. congressman (""The Rifleman"" star Chuck Conners), who was en route to Europe to negotiate for help to end the Civil War. He absolutely must to get back to the surface and complete his mission, no matter what. To make matters worse, while Chuck is plotting his escape he becomes romantically involved with the girlfriend, (THUNDERBALL's luscious villainess, Luciana Paluzzi), of Nemo's second-in-command. Hey, THAT's sure to be a big help! A brilliant engineer is also among the rescued, but the poor man has perhaps the world's worst case of claustrophobia, so you just KNOW that he ain't gonna be none too happy trapped in a bubble at the bottom of the sea. In fact, only a steely mother and her clever young son show any interest in staying in Templemer. Nemo takes a shine to the intelligent boy and a decided liking to the mother, though this burgeoning romance is played rather subdued.

THOUGHTS: Attempt by MGM to re-capture the old school grandeur of Walt Disney's 20,000 LEAGUES is a well-intentioned effort. There are lots of amazing sights and gee-whiz whatchamacallits for younger viewers to gawk at and awe over. The production design really stands out here, with lots of big, lavish sets and some pretty impressive miniatures to represent the domed undersea megopolis of Templemer. There's a nifty giant manta ray for our heroes to battle aboard a clunky, decidedly UNimpressive version of the beloved Nautilus. Actually it's a neat take on Nemo's atomic-powered supersub, but it simply pales in comparison the iconic Disney version.  There's lots of innocent, old-fashioned adventure to be had with this MGM motion picture, and it makes for fine escapist entertainment that's suitable for the whole family. CAPTAIN NEMO AND THE UNDERWATER CITY would make an excellent middle feature for a ""Captain Nemo Night"" movie marathon, right after 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and just before MYSTERIOUS ISLAND. :-)

THE DVD: The movie is presented as one of Warner Bros. Archives releases, which means it's an MOD (Manufactured On Demand) DVD-r. It has NO bonus features except the theatrical trailer for the feature film and NO CLOSED CAPTIONS. Being an MOD means that older or finicky DVD players may have playability issues. Newer DVD units and Blu-ray players should have no troubles. Still.. Buyer Beware. Picture looks & sounds fine with no noticeable dirt or debris and there's little or no artifacting or pixelation. Sound is strong & solid with no fading of fluttering and the mix is even so you shouldn't have to keep adjusting the volume between the quieter dialogue scenes and noisy action sequences.",1430524800,,3729,5.038897893030795

3846946,4,B0024LIBDQ,"This movie was made in England and it has nothing to do with Jules Verne, only using the name of Capt. Nemo and his submarine, the Nautilus to fool the movie-goers into thnking that they will be in for a real treat.  The colors in the sets and underwater are beautiful, but this is not a show for the young as there is the sea creature making strange noises and the battle with the rubber shark and the trail of blood that it leaves.  Enjoyable, but, if you don't have a DVD player, you might not be able to see this on a recorder or computer.  +JMJ+",1376784000,,550,4.121495327102804

3846954,4,B0024LIBDQ,"This is good, but not great movie.  Worth watching once.  I probably won't want to watch it again for a long time.  It is the type of movie better gotten from Netflix or iTunes than purchasing the DVD, but it is cheap enough, so you might consider getting it for those times when you want some light entertainment.  It is not at the same level as 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but is still worth a viewing.",1334361600,2,406,4.233766233766234
3846955,3,B0024LIBDQ,"Decent film but lacks the charm and budget of Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. It has the distinct feel of a made for TV production even though it was a theatrical release. This was a Brittish, not a Hollywood, production; so perhaps that has something to do with it. Maybe it is unfair to compare the two films but in reality what I wanted was a worthy sequal with the same charm and tone of that first film and this film, while it tries, misses. The plot moves a bit slowly and the underwater sequences, at least on my home theatre, are very dark and murky (perhaps it's the print as the trailer actually looks better than the film). Robert Ryan as Nemo doesn't do much in the role. Chuck Conners is wooden but it seems as though the role was written that way. Overall it could have been much better but it isn't bad unless you compare this film to it's predecessor.",1334188800,,874,4.335365853658536
3846956,5,B0024LIBDQ,"I love the whole atmosphere this movie has. In my opinion it's a great prequel to 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. I just wish that it came on blu-ray disk. Its not a movie for everyone. Especially since there are a few inconsistencies, but if you don't analyze it I think you'll enjoy it. Happy Viewing!!!",1325116800,7,303,4.428571428571429

3846959,4,B0024LIBDQ,"I saw this movie for the first at the cinema - yes, I was only 9 years old, but I still remembered parts of it years later - mostly the underwater city, Templemer. Remember - it's a model, not computer effects.  The movie is a blatant attempt to capitalize on Verne and Nemo - just call it ""The Underwater City"" and leave Nemo out of it.  It works better that way.

It's still one of my favorite flicks from the 1960's and would be in my top 50 SF film list.  Classic SF fan? You have to see this!  I think Vincent Price would have been a better Nemo.

Here's a bit of trivia - you probably know Nemo translates as ""no name"" - what was the characters ""real"" name?  Prince Dakkar.",1312329600,10,679,4.098484848484849
3846960,4,B0024LIBDQ,"This movie begins with a terrific storm at sea....abandon ship!  The raging wind and rain abruptly give way to the eerie stillness of six bodies sinking beneath the sea (artfully shot by my favorite cinematographer, Alan Hume).  These people are quickly rescued and brought to the titled city, Templemir, home of the infamous Captain Nemo (played with supreme gruffness by Robert Ryan).  They soon learn that they are expected to become permanent guests.  Several of the guests refuse to accept this and almost immediately plot their escape, one, a claustrophobic, with grim results.  Also on hand are two greedy brothers interested in the abundance of gold found everywhere in the domed city.  Rounding out the six survivors are a senator (played by Chuck Connors), and a mother and her young son (plus a cat in a box).  Besides a fabulous tour of the place, including a walk through the underwater garden and fish pens, there's also a couple of minor scuffles with a huge monster called Mobula (basically a very big manta ray with an attitude).
Nothing scary, the excitement level is kept to a minimum.  There's a confusing rant by Nemo against war but in the same breath, he levels threats of death to anyone who opposes him.  There's greed, backstabbing, destruction, and petty jealousy, it's all handled adequately; this is not a great movie.  It's a fun movie.  I've always had a fondness for it and others like it, basic adventure films.  I waited a long time to find a copy so it's definitely a keeper.",1308441600,9,1510,4.810077519379845
3846961,5,B0024LIBDQ,I really enjoyed hearing that this movie was finally put on DVD so that many who remember it will be able to watch it now.  I almost forgot about a scene in the movie where Captain Nemo(Robert Ryan) and his second-in-command were walking in his fantastic undersea city and one of the beautiful female citizens just happens to walk into this scene wearing no panties; literally bottomless and with a child no less(I believe this scene was talked about on certain talk shows of the day).  This movie is a must see for those who enjoy science fiction movies.  I highly recommend it.,1301270400,,579,4.601941747572815

3846963,4,B0024LIBDQ,"""Captain Nemo and the Underwater City"" is a fun movie in the spirit of other Verne movies, such as ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", ""20,000 Leagues ..."" or ""Mysterious Island"".  Robert Ryan, Nannette Newman, Chuck Conners and all the others do a great job entertaining their audience.  The photography and production details are well done, as is the quality of the DVD.  Is it a great Oscar winner?  Of course not.  But, unlike a lot of movies, it has a beginning and an end with character and story development.  It is a nice addition to anyone's collection.",1265760000,17,564,4.646464646464646
