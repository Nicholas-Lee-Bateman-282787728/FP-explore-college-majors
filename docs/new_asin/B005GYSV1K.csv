8472413,5,B005GYSV1K,"""Colors of the Diaspora"" is a compilation of three full-length concerts produced by Regina Resnik Presents. As the sub-heading indicates, it offers a kaleidoscope of Jewish classical song and operatic excerpts drawn from over 500 years. The first concert, titled ""The American Jewish Composers,"" includes the world premiere of ""A Petition to the Governor,"" written by John Corigliano especially for this series. The second concert is ""Covert or Convert,"" examining works by Jews who wrote in secret or were ambivalent about their religious identity, as well as works by converts to Judaism. Composers include Anton Rubinstein, Otto Klemperer, and Felix Mendelssohn. In the final concert, ""Crossing All Boundaries,"" we encounter works on Jewish themes by non-Jewish composers, including works by Glinka, Rimsky-Korsakov, Shostakovich, Schubert, Massenet, Ravel and others. Regina Resnik is the director and narrator; her son, Michael Philip Davis conceived and wrote the program, which includes a lot of fascinating information. The fine group of singers are sopranos Roslyn Jhunever Barak, Katherine Whyte, and Darynn Zimmer; mezzo-soprano Audrey Babcock; tenors Michael Philip Davis and Alex Richardson; and baritone Charles Robert Stephens. The pianists are Vlad Iftinca and Milos Repicky, with brief but welcome contributions by violinist Annaliesa Place and guitarist David Leisner. A highlight is ""Thirst,"" a comic scene with dialogue and music by composer Seymour Barab (b. 1921), in which Miss Resnik breaks out of her role as narrator to perform opposite her son Michael Philip Davis.",1322438400,5,1592,5.665271966527197
