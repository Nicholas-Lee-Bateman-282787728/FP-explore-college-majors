3521613,5,B001D261TI,"I have 70 FIRM workouts and this one is one of, if not the, best. I love it! It's challenging and effective yet Rebekah makes it easy to follow AND fun. I look forward to this one when I have it in rotation (which is often). The title ""Get Chisel'd"" is perfect because that's exactly where it gets you. I'm already starting to see results and I've only had this for about 3 weeks. The combination of sculpt segments with power pushes in between is perfect as each segment leaves you with just enough energy to switch over to the next. I also recommend Rebekah's two prior workouts ""Cardio Core Fusion"" and ""Total Body Time Crunch."" It's obvious this girl just gets better with each workout she leads! I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.",1229472000,46,749,4.39568345323741
3521614,5,B001D261TI,Just tried the dvd today.  I really got a great workout.  It was challenging and I also did the 15 minute bonus workout to get a total of 55 minute workout.  The 15 minute bonus gave me a great sweat.  I definetly recommend this workout.,1228608000,9,237,4.2
3521615,5,B001D261TI,"I love this workout!!! Rebekah is an awesome lead. I really liked that they featured ""firm believers"" in this video but I especially loved the girl who did the beginner modifications, I think she did a great job (and she's so cute)!",1228348800,14,232,4.5476190476190474
3521616,5,B001D261TI,"It's quality over quantity of time in this 40 minute workout led by Rebekah Sturkie.  Rebekah does not waste a moment in this workout.

There is a brief warm-up and then it's down to business with some great new sculpting and cardio combinations.  The great thing is that even though Rebekah threw some very effective new combos in, she is still easy to follow.  The cardio bursts in between sculpting sets are incredibly energetic.  Forget plain old jumping jacks, she has you do a more plyometric version where you really leap into the air.  She even kicks squat thrusts up a notch to keep it interesting and keep your heart pounding.  After all the standing work is done, she continues to innovate in her floor work segment.  On your back, you'll do weighted arm, leg, and ab exercises simultaneously; but of course she layers each new part so it's easy to get it all coordinated.

It's a great, effective workout by a real pro.  I'll buy anything Rebekah is lead in.",1228262400,50,970,4.619883040935672

3521621,5,B001D261TI,"Ok, Let's start with the fact that I'm a ""Firm"" fan and have been for over two decades. This product gives me everything I want in an exercise video. It is quick, easy to scale up by using heavier weights or doing higher intensity aerobics like jumping instead of marching in place which can raise my HR if it isn't high enough. And, I don't find this video boring. I will admit that the earlier Firm videos are more intense and and even less likely to get old/boring, for example Time Crunch which I really love, and is still available. I do them if I have a lot of time. This video is only 40 minutes and I'm sweaty and happy after doing it. Plus there is a 15 minute high intensity aerobic bonus video with this title that is FAST and really burns calories. I don't get as much of a calorie burn on this one because my HR gets too high and I have to scale down my jumping, etc. I think it would be better for younger people who need more intense exercise to get aerobic. This is the second DVD of this particular title that I have purchased as I wore the the first one out. And, I really like Rebekkah, although I want to urge her to eliminate saying ""listen!"" as much as she does.",1489708800,2,1184,4.1521739130434785

3521645,5,B001D261TI,I recently bought this after being a fan of the firm series for several years. I am very impressed. It was super challenging but it was relatively short. The music is fun and the instructor is very good. The moves flow into each other. It might be tricky for beginners to coordinate upper and lower body moves at the same time but I think most people would get it down after doing the workout a couple of times. My legs were on fire and I had to back off some with my dumbell weights because I've recently slacked off on working out as much as I should. I think this video will help me snap into great shape by summer. I have major back surgery for scoliosis and the firm series is easy on my spine yet strengthens my abs and back terrifically. I also like the 500 calorie workout and total body time crunch but I think this might be my new favorite.,1462752000,5,850,4.189024390243903

3521696,5,B001D261TI,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,3,1486,4.427007299270073

3521721,5,B001D261TI,"It's a great workout.  I needed a change in exercise routine so I decided to go ahead and purchase this because I am familiar with the Firm name.  In my first workout I was completely lost but I kept moving and tried to keep up.  Shockingly enough the next day I was sore and it was a good sore.  With that said I decided to give it a go.  After a couple of sessions I got the moves down.  Rebekah has a sweetness about her that makes the workout more enjoyable.  I don't need a drill sergeant, I prefer her tone to exercise any day.  Dont give up after your first try, the first couple of times can be frustrating but once you stick with it and learn the moves you are as good as gold. It's a 40 min workout and it has a 15 min bonus workout if you want to add on or just use to get a quick workout in.  One more thing you DO SWEAT with this dvd.",1392768000,2,847,3.8497109826589595

3521723,5,B001D261TI,"I've used the Firm series for years, off and on, but always come back to it because it works.  I found this dvd a few months ago and it is the best one, hands down.  Short but challenging and the results are fast and amazing.  It really works the back of the thighs and butt like no other.  But all other muscles get toned, too.  If there is any weakness it might be the back but maybe I just need to use heavier weights.  EIther way, it's my go to and I have to force myself to use another dvd in order to cross train.  You can't go wrong with this one.",1382572800,,554,3.892857142857143
3521724,4,B001D261TI,"I originally bought this workout DVD in 2009 soon after it came out on Amazon. I proceeded to do it frequently, but as the years went by, moved on to Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper and Amy Dixon of late. This morning, I felt like changing it up, and was curious how this DVD would stack up against Jillian's Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism, and Amy Dixon's 2 Breathless Body Workouts.

I found the DVD fun, and somewhat challenging, but not as killer as the others. This DVD doesn't hold poses quite as long, which I enjoyed today, but I think doesn't give quite as big a workout. As an example, she has segments mixed in to the workout that are basically HIIT, which I really enjoy in my workouts. She does not hold the high intensity portion of these drills for as long, and so they are somewhat easier than Jillian and Amy Dixon, but that also made them somewhat more enjoyable as an upside. I really enjoy Rebekkah's style and the workout is entertaining. It does feel more ""dancy"" now that I've done the instructors listed above, but that didn't bother me. I actually enjoyed the change of pace. I do feel like I got a solid workout in, so I may add this to the rotation. I was definitely sweating throughout this workout, and the time really flew by.",1379808000,,1251,4.439130434782609
3521743,5,B001D261TI,This is one of my favorite Firm videos. It is a true challenge. When you are done you are proud and feel great. Rebekah is no nonsense but draws you in to do your best and not give up. She is so likable.,1379030400,,203,3.744186046511628

3521745,5,B001D261TI,"I seriously love this workout. Rebekah is awesome- she is so motivating! I love the fast pace of this workout- I don't feel like I'm wasting time doing too many slow stretches, but I still feel really limber after it. Rebekah talks almost the whole video in a really encouraging and interesting way, telling you what muscles you're working, which really helps take my mind off of the pain! This video is high-intensity enough that I can maintain my weight by just doing it a couple times a week, even though I do the low-impact version most of the time because of my knees. I don't even bother with all my other workout videos now- they seem too easy!",1376524800,,651,4.4789915966386555
3521746,5,B001D261TI,"Highly recommend this workout.  I find this fun, no nonsense, thorough and efficient.  I own bajillions of videos and the only one I can sort of compare it to is Ripped 1000 in terms of the intensity, but that one is just not as fun as this one is and this one is way shorter.

It's a little heavy on the lower body action, but I just modify some of the moves.  When I'm pressed for time, I know this one will get both cardio and weights in 40 minutes flat.

Plus the express is great for a HIIT quickie for 15 minutes.",1370131200,,519,4.0
3521747,5,B001D261TI,"when i first heard of the The Firm I was like yeah right. (so many products come out promising results and don't deliver)So before i bought anything I did a little research. When i found out they been around since the late 80s I thought well they couldn't be all that bad. I bought my first workout set in '09 and everyone started telling me I was losing weight literally within the first couple of weeks i saw muscle definition in my arms clothes weren't fitting. I was sore, tired, and huffing. felt like i had been running a marathon.

All of the instructors really break down all the moves for you to understand but its does patience. And it really does help if you change your eating habits. I have one of the Calorie Burn workout with two sessions on it that is like 20 minutes and i can't keep up cause it work the daylights outta me.

The Hard Core Fusion,  Get Chisel'd, and Body Crunch are the best in my opinion! These are ""fusion"" workouts, meaning they are circuits (cycles between resistance with hand weights and cardio without weights). These are not just for the young, I am 52 years old (regular workouts in the last 1.5 years) and I hang with them just fine (although I often do the low option when they get to higher outputs regarding knees, but there is always a ""low"" option shown!).

I've done it only a few times so far, but I can already tell that it will show up in my rotation more often than others.  It is challenging, but fun.  Rebekah is a great instructor and is very likeable.  She is a great motivator too.  I need only look at her abs and I want to keep pushing myself harder.  I definitely recommend this one.  There is one move at the end where she has you in a side plank and then has you lift your dumbbell too.  The first time I did it, I thought she must be crazy.  Now I appreciate that move.  A lot of Firm workouts have the same moves, but this one has a variety of moves that I hadn't seen in other videos, which is a big plus.

Because it works arms and legs and abs (there's a short ab and stretch section afterward) and even does some cardio, you really do get a good workout.  You should easily feel (a good) soreness in your glutes and hamstrings for a couple of days afterward.

It has a great routine for weights and muscle tone plus I really enjoy the intervals between the weights. I find the moves easy to follow yet challenging enough to get my heartrate up. Sure, Rebekah can get a little cheesy but the workout is worth it.

3521789,5,B001D261TI,"Wow, I just finished this video and had to sit down to right the review.  Literally, dripping sweat at my computer, but it's worth it so that I may help others who are wondering about this video.

This video is 40 minutes long and is considered one of their Cardio & Sculpt because of the incorporation of weights and power moves that increase your heart rate.

Like with all Firm videos (obviously I'm a big fan anyway) this video is well choreographed by Rebecca Sturkie, who is just awesome.  She has a great attitude and you can tell she's working right there along with you - and sweating with you too!!

Every single move is modified for beginners, using no weights, as Rebecca points out at the beginning of the video, and you can still work up a sweat following Noel.

Each set incorporates lower body and upper body work for ""maximum calorie burning"" as the Firm is so famous for saying, and they are right!

I workout with a Heart Rate Monitor and was not surprised to see myself on the high end of my Zone 2, which is my fat burning zone, and where I want to be for most of my workouts.  This video, and most Firm videos, help me achieve that fat burning zone quickly and efficiently.

This video definitely has a lot of squats, lunges and dips, so it's very, very important to watch your form, especially before you incorporate weights and before you add the arm work that always accompanies these.

I really liked the power moves - Rebecca would choose a move and tell you how to modify it to help your heart rate climb and it's awesome and hard, but they are over very quickly!

This will be a workout that I keep handy for my monthly rotations, especially because it's such a powerful workout for the amount of time.  I love Rebecca, I love the Firm and I love this workout.

I'm a SAH and WAH mom, with a husband who works long hours, so these workouts have allowed me to change the shape of my body for the better!  I feel great during and after every workout; I look forward to typing up my monthly rotations; and I love checking them off and feeling strong and powerful!

I like serious, efficient workouts.  I don't expect to dislike them or for them to be monotonous, but I don't expect to be entertained.  I get and use different ones for different purposes and variety.  To get the best results, buy the right one for your level and outcome preferences.  This workout is for getting chisled.  It's more for sculpting than cardio but has some cardio - like moving quickly between weight machines in the gym has some cardio.  It's a good sculpting workout.  As your level increases, increase the weights and your effort (squat and lunge lower).
I have used The Firm and Tony Horton workouts (P90x guy) for decades.  They are the best for a home workout.  Rebekah (this workout's Instructor), Allison and Allie (other Firm Instructors) are great no-nonsense instructors.  They are like personal trainers.  They are not like cheerleaders.

3521806,3,B001D261TI,"I am a big fan of the older Firm workouts. They're all no-nonsense, straight to the business of working out, lifting weights, and getting some cardio in while you're at it. The new Firms though? Such as this one? Hmmm I'm not really feeling them. I keep trying, and I keep wanting to like them, but they just ... well to me, they lack continuity and a feeling of being fluid. Exercises are changed out quickly, when really there's just no need to switch moves that often. To make matters worse, all of the segments seem to be performed to one, single, elevator music type instrumental song. I was about to mute the TV while doing the workout because I just couldn't take it a minute longer. Get some better music, Firm! In addition, the cardio isn't comparative in intensity to say a Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, or Jari Love workout. I think in recent years the Firm has fallen behind a bit when it comes to workouts that are fun and get results at the same time. I miss the days of Traci Long and Jen Carmen. That being said, I did sweat doing this one - though it was 80 degrees in my room so I'm not sure how much of this was the result of the workout and how much was the result of the heat. It's not the worst workout I've ever done, but it's by far not the best. It's just ... meh ... okay.",1328054400,5,1298,4.196

Get Chiseld is a low impact cardio video and its segmented in phases of weight training and little low impact cardio. Its a good video for sculpting and combining with other workout, such as running.

I started doing The Firm videos with my mom back in the 90s, I was a teenager. I can tell that The Firm have evolve their sculpting material but I think they can do better in the cardio.

Now I'm about to turn 50, and every now and then I'll pull out one of those old-school workouts and hope my VHS player still works. They are still the toughest, in my opinion, for strength training and muscle toning.

Fast forward twenty years, and as I prepare to enter menopause, I have turned to higher intensity cardio to fight the middle-aged spread.  I have been incorporating The Firm ""Pink"" series into my Body for Life routine on cardio days, and while BFL requires 20 minutes of cardio, with each minute more intense than the last, I feel satisfied that I'm doing Get Chisel'd and some of the other Pinks, and getting the bonus of weight training.  My Firm collection has grown to 60 workouts (including my beloved VHS tapes), and I'm constantly researching and adding newer Firm workouts.  Rebekah provides excellent cuing and motivation in Get Chisel'd, and I am pleased that I can still make it through the power progressions.

PROS:  Worked up a modest sweat.  Rather complicated routine will keep the attention of those easily bored and looking for something more imaginative with less repetition.  Has cardio and weight segments, which I prefer.

CONS:  As others noted, the routines seemed unnecessarily complicated and would have benefited from more repetitions and less switching around.  The challenge for me wasn't as much about stamina as keeping in step with all the changes.  While I was able to follow along the first time I watched this without feeling frustrated, I did wonder ""are all these changes really necessary?"" and had to pay close attention to the tv the whole time.  It felt like they do a move 4 times and then need to switch it up in some shape or form so if that's what you like, this is for you.  I'm sorry to say that the instructor just did not work out for me --- while it is actually a testimony to her being in great enough shape to talk non-stop, I must confess I ended up wondering if she'd ever give us a break and stop talking for 5 seconds.  Most of the time, the moves keep changing so she has to cue or count and during repetition moments she would talk about the muscles being worked or saying her catchphrase (which also didn't work for me) ""that's your move.""  If she must talk, would have been better to keep to counting the reps (which I actually wish instructors would do more of since a lot of time the music isn't audible enough to keep tempo to without cranking up the volume.)",1285804800,7,1598,4.4878892733564015

It looked like the girl that was supposed to do it called in sick and they got a girl from the street to do it!

You can't miss how much this girl messes up. Almost every move she does wrong and even when a move is over she does it for a second before she realizes that it's over. Usually on the Firm work out you have to do it alot before you notice little mess ups hear and there. That means this girl was so bad, they couldn't even edit it out!

I didn't find it confusing to follow, as some have said in previous reviews. Maybe it is because I am familiar with the FIRM. I also think Rebekah is one of their top instructors. She cues well and is not annoying like Ali Del Rio and Annie Lee. While doing this workout, I used 5 lbs weights throughout, and I wore a heart rate monitor. At the end of 40 minutes, my average heart rate was 140. Not great ( I average over 150 bpm when doing the Firm's 500 Calorie Workout) but enough to burn maybe 300 calories. The power moves are the best - my heart rate spiked into the 160's when doing these moves. They are tough! I usually prefer my workouts to be a little longer because I feel like I'm getting more for my money, but this one is still a great one that I will be adding to my routine. I also recommend Total Body Time Crunch and the 500 Calorie Workout for cardio/strength training workouts, and Cardio Dance Fusion for a strictly cardio workout",1283212800,,1077,4.36318407960199

I did this video with Rebecca Sturkie today....all of it...and I am afraid of how sore I am going to be tomorrow.  The first part, the main part, definitely will get you chiseled...but it was not quite enough for my heart rate to get challenged.  But, overall, don't skip this part.  However, the Bonus Part, is very challenging.  If you are not sweating, YOU ARE ASLEEP!  This is a great aerobic workout that adds alot of fun challenging moves to some familiar ones.  I feel extra strong and energized today.  This is just what I needed.

As with all videos, you will have to do it a few times to get the hang of the moves.  But, don't worry about that.

Lastly, the only thing that would be more of a challenge to me would be running a mile on the track and then weight lifting at the gym.  But, this video is much more fun!  Rebecca is cute and has a very chiseled body.  Yes, she breathes alot.  But, you will, too.  I am tired of the videos where the girls hold their breathe to keep their diamond earrings on and a smile on their face.

3521914,5,B001D261TI,"""WOW!!!""  That's exactly what I said out loud after completing my first workout of Get Chisel'd.  This is the 6th Firm workout DVD that I have purchased and this one is by far the most challenging.  I thought the 500 calorie workout with Kelsi was hard; I was wrong!!  Rebekah keeps you moving for 40 minutes straight.  This workout is not for beginners and anyone that said that they didn't feel like they were doing anything, well, you must not have been moving around.  I consider myself an advanced exerciser and I was  huffing and puffing and struggling, but made it through.  It was really nice to do something different from my usual routine and while this workout was very challenging, it was well worth the challenge.

You begin the workout with a short warm-up and go right into the workout.  I used 8 pound weights for my ""heavy"" weights and 5 pound weights for my ""medium"" weights.  I usually use my 8lbs weights all the time, but Rebekah changes it up so much that you really need the medium weights to ensure that you're not over-working your muscles and getting too tired too fast.  Between the sculpting sets are the power moves.  My knees aren't the greatest, but I work out enough to know how to do a proper squat and lunge so that my knees aren't affected too much.  You do jumping squats, lunges, etc.  They're very tiring, but well worth it!

Rebekah is a great instructor.  My only complaint with most of The Firm workout DVD's is that it takes a while to learn the moves and the instructors are not the best at cuing you; however, this was not the case with Get Chisel'd.  Rebekah was huffing and puffing right along with you, she gave clear directions, gave them slow, and everything was very easy to follow.  I am true fanatic of The Firm and can tell you that after one workout of Get Chisel'd, this will be my favorite.

My only true complaint about this particular DVD is the same complaint that other reviewers have mentioned, which is that the Express workout is not included.  I'm not sure why it's missing.  Even though it's not there I gave this review 5 stars anyway because I never use the Express workouts.

If you want results and you want them fast, I highly recommend this DVD.  As The Firm always states, you'll see results in 10 workouts and the same holds true for this one!",1274745600,32,2316,4.485645933014354
3521915,4,B001D261TI,"I'm an intermediate exerciser and try to do a mix of everything.  This workout is definitely efficient and I love the way most of the firm dvds mix resistance training with calorie blasting cardio.

Pluses: workout packs alot into 40 minutes, challenging, & good instructor.
(I also got mine for a good price)

Minuses: Not for a beginner unless you know how to modify the moves yourself (the camera doesn't really show the modified lady and some of the moves she didn't modify at all). Also the power moves include plyometrics which may not be good for some with hip/knee/ankle problems unless you modify it down.

I felt pretty dorky at first, because the moves can be complicated and aren't the same basic moves that other workouts use. I'm guessing I'll need at least two more run-throughs before I feel like I actually know what I'm doing the whole time.

But if it were so easy to follow that I could get it the first time, then it would wind up being really boring really quickly. I'll trade complicated/interesting for simple/boring any day.

If you are looking for a effective, workout that is only 40 minutes, than this is the one for you!! I like to use this on days when I have to be at work early because I can get an effective calorie burn in a short amount of time...It is definitely an intermediate to advanced workout...",1264723200,2,379,4.135135135135135
3521920,4,B001D261TI,"I did this workout yesterday for the first time and while the workout itself is good and I was able to burn a lot of calories, I am not overly drawn to this DVD. It's not a bad workout, nor is the instructor, but I can say that this will be one only done occasionally vs often. I can't quite explain the feeling bc it worked me hard and the moves were varied, I just wasn't excited about it.

The warm up is your first cardio cycle. There are approx 6 cycles total, 3 cardio, 3 with weights. On other sites this is ranked as an Intermediate DVD, I would say though it's closer to Inter/Advanced. There are a lot of high impact options that would give the advanced user a well rounded workout. Burpees are the only exercise in this DVD that I am unable to do. I have to wear a knee brace which takes all pressure off of my bad knee, thankfully as there are a lot of lunges and squats. However, the burpees call for a range of motion that I am not able to obtain with the brace on. If you have knee issues, you will find it best to stick to a more ""beginner"" option by not going down as deep.

You complete your ast cycle on the floor which is strength/toning/abs. You get in some chest work along with abs and even a little balance challenge with side planks. You use your weights throughout the DVD including the floor work and Side Planks. Ab movements are nothing new to the firm and in fact, in this DVD, they seem to be a little easier on the back compared to other workouts like the 500 Calorie Burn. I swear I am the Bionic Woman as I have several old injuries throughout my body including the lower back. Ab work is tricky for me anyhow, so for the average person, the ab work would be decent, nothing too grueling. For ppl like me with lower back issues, you will find that you may have to modify some of the movements by doing a lesser range of motion. To challenge yourself for those of you with strong back, don't put the dummbells down, it'll intensify it.

Compared to other Firm Pinks I was surprised that I had to lower my weight selection. In every other one I have had to increase it to meet my needs. I believe it is bc the pace of the DVD moves you quickly so in order to maintain proper form, it would need to be lowered. The Choreography is typical Firm Style as is instruction. Rebekah is a great lead and a wonderful cuer; I had no issues what-so-ever following along. A movement here or there I had to do a few times for it to flow easily, but nothing that would cause me issue. If I were to look at the choreography alone, it's a fun workout, so I have no clue why I am not drawn more into this. Perhaps doing it a couple of more times would help. I do love Total Body Time Crunch, so if you don't have that, it's really great! The music in this one isn't bad. I have watched a clip of the DVD before purchasing and the Music seemed so dreadful! I avoided getting it for so long bc of that alone. Really though the music sounds completely different, hearing it in it's intended form and not a few second shot, really makes the difference. You're in and out in 42-43 minutes and you get a great workout. This would make a wonderful Cardio-Only DVD if you stuck with 3s and/or 5 lbs weight only. I did this as I was not able to make it to the gym for my weight workout. I don't feel much today, a little soreness in the abs, left bicep/shoulder (another weak area thanks to injury), and a small section of my quads. At this point I know I couldn't go heavier bc of the pace, so for me personally I will use this as a cardio workout with light weights.

It's not a bad DVD, but it's not my favorite or on the favorites list for the Firm. You will get worked out, sweat a lot (I was dripping), and it's worth the money. If you've seen a clip of the workout, those don't do it justice. I personally LOVE the 500 Calorie Burn, Total Body Toner, and Total Body Time Crunch. This is good, but there is just something about it that I can't quite put my finger on, which is why I rated it 4 instead of 5...I'd give it 4.5 if I could. I don't regret this purchase and would recommend it. It's one that will produce results and excellent gains in endurance.

Look to youtube for 1-4 minute length clips of this DVD.

EDIT: There is also a 15 minute Cardio-only add on for this DVD. I did not do it so my review does not include the information for this extended workout.",1263600000,5,4383,4.132473622508792

With that being said, after I was done with the whole thing including the bonus 15 min. workout I felt really great and like it was a good workout.  If you are looking for a huge cardio push this probably isn't the right workout for you. If you want an overall good toning workout with some short bursts of elevated heartrate then it's great!

The DVD--Get Chisled--is very similar to other firm DVD's.  So much so that if you have Hard Core Fusion, The
Firm Bootcamp, or a few of the other sculpt focused titles, you won't need to purchase this one.
Get Chisled does give you an all over workout for each major muscle group and there is cardio thrown in for extra burn.  The instructor cues well, the music is upbeat and it is a nice length (about 45 minute workout), so that's the reason for the 4 stars.

Rebekah is by far my favorite FIRM instructor. She's a great cuer and her body is actually one I'd aspire to, unlike someone like Jillian Michaels who looks kinda butch, Rebekah manages to look very feminine even though her arms and abs are freakin RIPPED! I like her personalty a lot too and I liked when she'd say ""I know you're feelin' this!"" because I was! I used 5lb and 8lb weights which were challenging, so I say if you are new to weight training start lighter or with none to begin with. They have beginner mods but I cant really see those being nearly as effective. I did the 40 minute strength training and the 15 minute bonus cardio because there are only small bursts of intense cardio in between the exercises and I felt I needed a little more. I KNOW that if I continue with this dvd I'll have visible results in no time. Most importantly, it was enjoyable, which means I WILL stick with it.

UPDATE: This is my favorite work-out DVD I own, I literally feel sore for days EVERY time I do it. I never get tired of this one!",1249257600,2,1241,4.280851063829787

3521942,5,B001D261TI,"First of all I am a huge Firm fan. I do a Firm workout 2-3 times per week. I have weighed less (in high school) but I wear smaller clothing than I have since I was about 12. The workouts like this one blow the gimmicky ones (like transfirmer step ones) out of the water in terms of intensity and results. My favorites are this one and the 500 Calorie workout.

To get the best bang out of this (or any Firm) workout you will need 3, 5, & 8 pound hand weights. This one is a short but very effective 40 minutes long.

I hate dancy-fancy aerobics. I just can't follow the moves. I was worried that this one would be too hard to follow. I was pleased to find quite the contrary. It was you basic core full body moves. A lot of dips, lunges, squats, etc. It also has ample weight work that made me SORE--and I do these workouts all the time. This one starts out slow, but don't be fooled. It builds and builds and builds. By the end I am dripping with sweat and can feel the lingering burn in my legs, butt and arms.

The cons on this one: The music is not the best (usually I don't even notice the music--but this struck me as not what I wanted), her beginner is really a beginner and it can be distracting (but it is nice to see someone ""Real""), there are a couple points that she gets a little out of sync at the end, if you have bad knees this NOT a good idea.",1247788800,7,1360,3.9926470588235294

3521944,3,B001D261TI,"I got this DVD because of the good reviews. I usually use yoga or Jillian Michaels' DVDs, and I've never done a Firm workout before, so I have no idea how it stacks up to other Firm DVDs. However, I wasn't too impressed with it as an overall workout.

I'm a straightforward kind of exerciser. I like a lot of bang for my buck, and I'd rather do tough, simple moves than a lot of fancy stuff that doesn't have as much of a pay off. To me, this DVD is a little too full of the latter. Especially with the warm-up--but in the workout as well--there are lots of ""step this way, move your arms over here while stepping back over there"" kind of moves. I felt like it was a lot of confusion just to get a decent sweat going, and I didn't think the cuing was close to being enough to sort things out for me.

The other problem I had with this workout is that when there ARE straightforward moves (and there are several of these as well), the reps are way too low. I believe at one point you do four push-ups before she tries to make it all fancy again. That is just not enough for me to even begin to feel anything. I know that I would have gotten a better workout if we could have just done twenty regular push-ups. I felt the same way about several of the strength exercises here. She changes things up so often that I don't feel like I ever really pushed any one muscle group.

There are some good things about this DVD. I did manage a sweat, which means it must be doing something. And some of the moves in the first few circuits were unique and I could feel them in my butt/thighs especially. The cardio blasts WILL get your heartrate up at least momentarily. And Rebekah is not overly annoying, though she does like to repeat herself a lot. However, I probably won't do this DVD much because I don't feel it really makes the most of my time, and I think it sacrifices effectiveness for frills at times.",1247356800,15,1900,4.185792349726776
3521945,5,B001D261TI,"This video is awesome! I recently purchased it and can say it was a good purchase. The moves are innovative and fun. I like the mix of ""cardio blasts"", which are cardiovascular exercises that are intermingled throughout the video and lasts for about a minute or so.  The purpose of the cardio blasts is to get your heart rate going and to burn extra calories. Afterwards, you transition back to the toning segments.  The instructor's cues are clear and concise. One of my favorite parts of the video is the abdominal section whereby the instructor mixes the arm exercises with the abdominal exercises--talk about challenging!

These 40 minutes are used soo much more effectively than some of my other hour long advanced tapes.  I rotate this with Jillian Michaels 30 day shred and p90x's extreme yoga.
I will say that there are some rather advanced combination moves that really make you concentrate. (especially the plie rotate into row with back leg lift)  It takes about 3-4 times through to learn the ""steps"" but it's well worth it, and even if you're not in perfect time with the instrucor at first, you're still at a high heart rate!

I like the way you start with the moves using weights then do the same move intensified doing cardio. Great high cardio bursts, then the cool down going back to the weights. I would consider this an advanced workout because of the speed and intensity, though they have a person showing a modified version.

3521981,5,B001D261TI,"Honestly, the first time I played this workout, I thought: what have I gotten myself into? I found it hard the first time around to get the moves down because you are utilizing your upper and lower body at the same time - so for uncoordinated exercisers like me, it was a challenge. However, the second time I completed the workout it was a lot easier to get the moves down, it just takes practice.

I personally feel the workout sets target the lower body (especially your butt!) more than the upper body for sculpting. This was a little disappointing because I didn't feel an even distribution of soreness the next day.

This is a 40-min workout and has brief warm up and cool down sessions. The warm up has you moving around a lot and the first time I found it a little chaotic, but it only lasts for a few minutes. The workout is comprised of different sets which include lunges with arm raises, sumo squats with curls, etc. All the sets incorporate the upper body and lower body moves to work together which makes this workout challenging for beginners. The sets require 3 different weights (light, medium, and heavy) and she alternates between all three throughout the sets. However, like I said before, I didn't ""feel the burn"" in my arms as much as I wanted so now I only use medium and heavy weights.

In between these sets are ""Power"" sessions which are your cardio (though my heart rate was up throughout the whole workout) and these sessions have you breathing HARD. Good news is they are very short and there are modifications for those of us who can't add a high jump after squat-thrusts or click our heels together in the air from sumo squat positions just yet. (*raises hand*)

Once you've completed your last power session you have one floor set which focuses on abs but incorporates the arms as well. You do use weights during the floor work portion and it really makes a difference. There is a cool down after the floor work and then you're done!

All of these Firm workouts promise noticeable results in 10 workouts. I'm half-way through and while my clothes aren't fitting any looser, I like the firm and toned feeling I get with this workout.
