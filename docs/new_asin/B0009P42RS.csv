Seeing as I don't have enough PTO to list what's wrong with this movie I'll list what's right: absolutely nothing.  If someone you know puts this on, gouge your eyes out and smear the blood on the tv screen to prevent others from being subjected to it.",1122768000,4,360,4.358208955223881

2308469,4,B0009P42RS,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago and have never laughed so hard all movie long.  Unfortunately, I could not remember the movie's name or Anthony Anderson's name.  I have been searching for this movie the last couple of years to no avail.  Even doing a search on the top black actors, but did not see Anthony Anderson.

About a week ago I was watching Harold and Kumar going to white castle and boom at the burger shack was the guy in the hilarious movie.  Did an [...] and it was ""Anthony Anderson"".  Started looking through the movies and found it ""King's Ransom"".

I told my wife we have got to watch this again.  It has been so long.  I am already laughing.  Can't wait to purchase it here on amazon.com

I don't understand what some of these reviewers are thinking.  All of have to do is sit back, don't think and just laugh at this comedy ""Masterpiece""

Absolutly love it.  If anyone knows other great lesser known movies like this comment them to me!

Thanks.",1333065600,,971,4.376404494382022
2308470,5,B0009P42RS,"I enjoyed this film and Anthony Anderson outdid himself in playing the role of a stuckup,obnoxious business executive with questionable judgement.  He was such a Heel that he attempted to engineer his own kidnapping to get out of paying a high divorce settlment, but he had pissed of a number of others to the extent that his estranged wife engineered  a plan to kidnap him to make sure that he doesnot get out of settlement.  He had passed over promoting his top administrator to being his assistant and gave the assistant position to his emptyheaded mistress.  The offended female worker engineered her own plot with two of her friends to kidnap him as well.  A fellow applying for a job at his company was pressured by his sister who had broken out of jail to get her $10,000  or she was going to tell the law that he was mastermind of the robbery that got her put away in prison,when this fellow applied to mr king for a job.  Anthony Anderson insulted him and turned him dow flat-this fellow engineered his own plot to kidnap him.  So there were four kidnap plots against this one obnoxious man.  The story took on a halarious turn when all of the kidnappers tripped over each other to kidnap the star.  Loretta Divine  kept the comedy alive as well.  That action was improbable but the film will keep you in stiches.",1325376000,,1322,4.531645569620253
2308471,5,B0009P42RS,"throughout this whole film, beginning to end, was comedy!
a lot of black comedy films always know how to bring the funny!!!!
i highly recommend this movie to anyone who would like to have a good laugh on a friday night!
anthony anderson, jay mohr and regina hall were probably the funniest actors in the movie
but overall, everyone was funny and watching the special features adds more to the package!",1311033600,,401,4.661971830985915
2308482,1,B0009P42RS,"Jeff Byrd, the director of this movie, made absolutely clear his lack of any talent whatsoever in making this film- and he has not directed since, thank goodness.

The script, characters, and storyline are high-school caliber; the movie is EXCRUCIATINGLY UNFUNNY to the point of insulting your intelligence. This guy (Jeff Byrd) had no business in film whatsoever. How he managed to convince the studio to give him this job is beyond me.

Mr. Byrd, I hope you've found more gainful means of employment as you've proven without a doubt that you have no place in film. Maybe as a technician pulling cables and/or setting up lights, but should be the extent of your duties.",1289779200,,670,4.817391304347826
2308483,4,B0009P42RS,"Malcolm King is a wealthy and arrogant businessman whose ex-wife to be has plans to take him for everything he's worth in their divorce settlement. Determined to avoid losing his fortune to her, Malcolm plans his own kidnapping with the help of his dim-witted mistress and her ex-con brother. Unfortunately for Malcolm, he is not the only one with a kidnapping plot. This movie is a silly slapstick comedy. You shouldn't watch this movie expecting to be moved to anything but laughter.",1264291200,3,485,4.926829268292683
2308484,5,B0009P42RS,This was a great movie! we had to buy a copy.. It is very funny and has some good lessons... I would recommend this movie. One of my co workers asked me if I had seen this movie and I told them that we have seen the movie. My co worker also thought that it was a great movie and very funny. I am surprised at the reviews. Try it for your self.. great add on to your comedy collection!,1262563200,,384,3.8125
2308485,5,B0009P42RS,"This movie is too funny.  Anderson made an excellent potrayal of a selfish bratty boss who told people what to do.  If you thought that Rush Hour 1 &2 are funny, then you'll think this is too.  But if you think that Dude Wear's my Car is funny, then you may give it a low rating and not really get the jokes.

2308486,2,B0009P42RS,"I happened to be passing through the channels on cable and came across this movie and saw Anthony and decided to watch.  All I can say is Thank Goodness I saw this on cable.  It had a few funny scenes like when Anthony was bossy to Jay, but most of the movie didn't make any sense.  I mean what are the odds of 3 people thinking of kidnapping somebody on the same night, especially since one of the culprits was himself.  Too farfetched and not funny enough to be given more than 2 stars.  Sorry Anthony.",1170028800,3,504,4.208333333333333
2308487,1,B0009P42RS,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen.  It's supposed to be a comedy but this movie was sooooooooo stupid it wasn't even funny.  It's basically about a rich guy who has his own company, I think it's called King Enterprises.  Almost everyone thinks he's arrogant and three female employees plan to kidnap him which I thought was so stupid.  Then the rich guy (played by Anthony Anderson) and his wife are going through a divorce.  So to prevent her from getting all his assets and money he plans his own kidnapping not knowing that his soon to be ex-wife plans to kidnap him as well.

I literally had to force myself to watch this movie.  It was so dumb it hardly kept my interest.  The way the movie was produced it seemed like a retarded person wrote and directed the movie.  The overall concept of the movie didn't make sense at all.  I was surprised at this movie.  It had an all-star cast but this film totally bombed.  If you like black comedies I definately don't recommed that you see this movie.

This movie was just horrible.  As I was watching it I expected it to get better but it just got worse.  As I said AVOID THIS MOVIE, it is a complete waste of time.",1147046400,,1172,4.3119266055045875
2308488,4,B0009P42RS,"2/09/06  Although it was a ""spoof"" on black culture(at the corporate level)(with a Caucasian Alzheimer granny & her confused Causian grandson thrown in for good measure) and it had no redeeming values (unless if one looked for the subtle messages) , due to an excellent acting cast/crew lead by Anthony Anderson  & a few of its ""this can't be happening scenes"" ,it's worth the viewing.",1139443200,,385,4.907692307692308

When you have to rely on a Bobby Brown joke to make people laugh, you know you're in trouble. I remember seeing the previews of this movie, thinking to myself,""I wouldn't waste my money on that! All the funny scenes were just shown in the preview!"" Then again, the scenes weren't really that hilarious. So take it from someone who hasn't watched this flop of a film: This so-called comedy is not worth the time and money.",1135641600,2,517,4.34020618556701
2308490,3,B0009P42RS,"While this movie could not be considered wildly funny it did have funny moments.

Unfortunately the funny moments could not be strung together well enough to make for a funny movie.

The plot, a man arranging his own kidnapping, that goes awry is a good starting point.

However from there the execution goes downhill.",1129248000,,318,4.851851851851852
2308491,3,B0009P42RS,"Malcolm King (Anthony Anderson) has made millions despite the fact that he treats everybody at King Enterprises like dirt and thinks hiring a bimbo to run a key part of his company instead of someone pretends to have a whole bunch of college degrees is a good thing.  His dumb as a post girlfriend, Peaches Clarke (Regina Hall) apparently looks good next to his shrewish wife, Renee (Kellita Smith), and apparently he got his big mouth from his secretary, Miss Gladys (Loretta Devine), who is the only person on Earth who apparently can stand him.  Malcolm is in the middle of an ugly divorce and he is afraid Renee is going to get his fortune, so he decides to fake being kidnapped so he can keep the ransom money.  But then Renee decides she should kidnap Malcolm to make sure she gets his money, as does Angela Drake (Nicole Ari Parker), who lost out on the promotion to the aforementioned Peaches, and Corey (Jay Mohr) who is down on his luck and had his shoes insulted by Malcolm.

Of course, in Wayne Conley's script all four of the kidnapping attempts happen at the same time.  Malcolm thinks he has been kidnapped by the people he wants to kidnap him, but that would make sense and that is not the direction this film wants to go.  Confusion certainly reigns, but really not as much comedy as you would like to see, most of which seems to be pretty heavy handed.  Besides, it is not like any of these characters are worth rooting for, which I find to be the fatal flaw of the film, so there is a basic apathy towards the entire plot.  I knew it was a bad sign when Malcolm's lunch order was pointed out because this was obviously going to be a clue that would come into play later in the film (yep, it sure did).  But then this is a movie that treats foot massage as a sublime sexual experience of the first order.

Not only is ""King's Ransom"" a bad movie, there is so much of it.  The film runs two hours and then there are well over a half-hour of deleted scenes.  I suppose there are plenty of laughs, as long as you enjoy laughing at the characters rather than with them, but the more I watched this film the more I was impressed with ""Ruthless Person,"" a movie that I have not thought about in years but which is clearly a much better example of a kidnapping gone awry comedy.  You will also be thinking of movies like ""Kangaroo Jack,"" ""Barbershop,"" and ""Urban Legends,"" all of which made much better use of Anthony Anderson's talents in decidedly different ways.  Donald Faison and Charlie Murphy are also wasted in this lame 2005 comedy as well, which underscores the great chasm between the talent of the cast and the value of the script.",1122854400,,2654,4.411885245901639

In going back and watching movies I haven't seen in a while I came across this movie here. This film was full of people I love and great actors. All of the actors here are great and I cant believe that I had forgotten about this flick. Anthony Anderson would star here alongside the likes of Jay Mohr, Charlie Murphy, Regina Hall, Loretta Davis, and Donald Faison among others.
The movie is about Malcolm King [Anderson] who plans on kidnapping himself in order to cheat his wife out of a divorce settlement, little does he know that he is not the only one who wants him kidnapped. His wife, co workers and even people he had never met want the same thing but for their own purposes. So when it goes down he believes it is all his plan, but whos plan is actually carried out?

This movie is a fun kidnap flick with some crazy over the top characters. Anderson is wonderful and King, the jerk you love to hate. The same can be said for almost every character in this film. Mohr is fun as the bumbling kidnapper who is more effective than anyone would think. Faison and Murphy are great in their roles as well and the women are great as well. I love Davis in anything as well as the great Regina Hall.

The DVD is excellent and makes this release a five star buy. You get the usual trailers including for this one but you also get a very fun commentary track with Anderson, Mohr and director Jeff Byrd along with an actual behind the scenes making of. I say that because it is actually a little documentary on the making of the film including a real look at the pre production, a lot is touched on here. This is a very worthy DVD release.",1517270400,,1650,4.282051282051282
