3063180,5,B00118DQXI,"This is one of the most dramatically gripping operas on DVD that I have ever seen.  The production from Glyndebourne is conceived to convey the intense drama of this tragic love story visally and musically.  The unit set is unusual, a concentric crescent that changes appearance radically with lighting.  The effect is highly dramatic.  The singers are superb.  Nina Stemme is a fierce, angry Isolde in the first act narrative, but then she and Tristan take the potion.  WOW.  The second act builds beautifully to the love duet and then the discovery of the lovers, in which Rene Pape as King Marke conveys his sense of betrayal with dignity and understanding, a very moving moment.  In the final act, Robert Gambill is heartbreaking as the dying Tristan, and the Liebestod is filmed and sung for stunning dramatic impact as the image fades into a pinpoint of light.  Katarina Karneus (Brangaena) and Bo Skovhus (Kurwenal) are superb in the important supporting roles.  Wagner lovers, do not miss this.",1208736000,29,1002,4.946107784431137
3063181,5,B00118DQXI,"This the the third Tristan to appear this year, not too long after the Met's DVD issue. As usual all of these have something very strong going for them,and for fully committed Wagnerians like myself, we take all three and know I will view them repeatedly.
The Glyndebourne production,minimal, is my choice, as it has the capital virtue of not introducing the distracting gimmicks we find in Bayreuth, where Isolde's train in Act 1 is absurd, and the end is controversial. In Barcelona the sets are rather ugly and nonsensical, and only the third act is relatively free of fault. The Met's presentation is silly and King Marke's crown is objectionable.
When it comes to the leads, Nina Stemme as Isolde trumps all her competition. She has a lovely presence, is a subtle actress, with a wonderful lyrical voice. Polaski is a great artist, but her voice has always had some problematic spots, and Johanna Meier, a very fine artist, pales besides these two.
Robert Gambill's Tristan has to fall second to Treleaven, who in the Barcelona performance, is the only Tristan who in spite of some bizarre gestures and vocal inconsistency, has kept my attention fully riveted to him through what can be an interminable Act. Kollo is too expressionless besides these others. Of course, Ben Heppner has the most beautiful voice, but alas, his Isolde!
The supporting cast in all the three sets is excellent, in Barcelona maybe more than that, especially Eric Halfvarson's Marke. Of course Rene Pape has a marvelous voice, but Halfvarson, more human, and motile, is what I prefer.
As I said, Wagnerians will want all these sets.",1207353600,16,1613,4.890510948905109
3063182,5,B00118DQXI,"After getting the video of the Ponnelle/Barenboim/Johanna Meier ""Tristan und Isolde"" which was delisted many years ago, and while I was waiting for it to come out on DVD cleaned up with a better quality of sound, I bought other versions.  For my taste, I found them all substandard (see my review of the aforementioned ""Tristan"").  Then it was issued as a DVD and judging from the many positive reviews most people found it as excellent a production as I did.

Now there is an embarasse de richesse because another excellent production has been released -- different, but equally excellent.  The Ponnelle is more traditional, with a major twist to the ending; whereas the Lehnhoff is more stylised, but faithful to the stated intention of Wagner.

There is but one set for the three acts, a series of circular and semicircular steps which enclose the stage.  But the very imaginative lighting profoundly changes the space and moods. At times it seems very confining, at others it is liberating; at times dark and brooding, at others warm and optimistic.  But the very spareness of the set keeps the focus on the what and why of this powerful opera.  It is very imaginative and works very well for this production.

Opus Arte, as usual, has served up a technically superlative production with first rate addenda.

I am grateful to Mike Birman for his account of the background to the opera and this production. It saves me from writing something very similar. (Since both of our reviews were written, we have had a correspondence in the ""comment"" section as we straightened out our mutual misunderstandings.  That remains for those interested.  He has since changed a bit of his opening background paragraph, so I am changing my response to it.)  I now fully agree with his facts and tone of his account.  He wrote, ""Tristan is the quintessential opera about eros and it is natural to wonder to what degree these romantic entanglements influenced its genesis"".  I certainly agree, and would like to add another possible example.

Since I referred to the twist in the Ponnelle production ending, and since other commentators in reviewing that production have given it away, as it were, as well as adversely criticised it I feel free to describe it here.  In that version, Isolde does not come to Tristan at the end -- she is an hallucination, Tristan's unfulfilled desire.  As I wrote in response to that criticism:  ""It may be different, but in light of Wagner's life at the time he wrote it, perhaps it makes sense. His relationship with Mathilda Weisendonck had broken up. Many commentators have written that this explains the yearning so powerfully represented in the music. Perhaps subconsciously he never expected that Isolde would turn up. I can invision Ponnelle in Heaven saying to Wagner, as Brunnhilde said to Wotan, ""I might not have done what you commanded, but I did what you wanted"".

I also have no hesitation in giving this production the full five stars.  Where I differ is in a matter of taste.  Mr. Birman says that this is his favourite DVD of this opera.  (Well, as they say on the Canadian East Coast, ""Some likes an apple and some likes an onion"".)  My favourite DVD production remains the Ponnelle/Bareboim/Johanna Meier one.  This, despite my finding Rene Pape's King Marke by far the best I have seen.  Stemme, Gambill and Karneus all sing extremely powerfully and well, and their acting is also first rate; but their interpretations are not as emotionally nuanced as those of Meier, Kollo and Schwarz -- hence my preference.

To repeat, it is a matter of personal taste.  This is a wonderful production in all respects, and it is really unfair to make comparisons -- not that that has stopped me.  I am glad to have both and, unlike all the others I unfortunately purchased over the years, I will return to them both -- often.  I am grateful to Opus Arte and DGG for these wonderful interpretations.

****************************************************

PS August 26 2008  I have just seen the Barenboim/Muller Tristan with Waltraud Meier and Siegfried Jerusalem.  As a result, for what it is worth, that is now my second choice and this drops to third.  The reason is that I have become increasingly less enchanted by Robert Gambill's singing.",1204329600,62,4271,4.860304287690179
3063183,5,B00118DQXI,"By Wagner's own written comments, composition of Tristan und Isolde was inspired by his love affair with Mathilde Wesendonck and the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Mathilde had married the silk merchant Otto Wesendonck, who was a great admirer of Wagner's music, and after he and Mathilde met the composer in Zurich in 1852, he placed a large cottage on his estate at Wagner's disposal. By 1857, Wagner had become thoroughly enamored with Mathilde. Wagner wrote voluminously and admitted to returning the many favors Otto had done for him by seeking the romantic favors of his wife. Wagner maintained a relationship with Mathilde for some time while composing Tristan. Tristan was composed between 1857 and 1859, premiering 10 June 1865 under the baton of Hans von Blow in Munich, despite the fact that Wagner was now having an affair with his wife, Cosima. All three wrote extensively about this strange turn of events. Wagner, of course, was still married to his first wife Minna. Tristan is the quintessential opera about eros and it is natural to wonder to what degree these romantic entanglements influenced its genesis. The complexity of Tristan insured that critical opinion was initially less than favorable. Eduard Hanslick, the most influential 19th Century music critic, said that Tristan ""reminded him of the old Italian painting of a martyr whose intestines are slowly unwound from his body on a reel."" Opinion quickly changed and Tristan has remained in the repertory ever since. These events, all carefully verified as to their factual nature by musicologists, make up some of the historical background to perhaps the single greatest opera, certainly the most influential, of the 19th century. Tristan is without question a brilliant opera and its importance in musical history is without precedent.

The score of Tristan und Isolde has often been called a landmark in the development of Western music. From its opening chord, the famous 'Tristan Chord' f-b-d#-g# which resolves to another dissonant chord, there is a feeling of ambiguous tonality throughout the opera. Techniques used by Wagner were to prove influential in the gradual movement away from tonality that was the hallmark of the 20th Century. Hans von Bulow, who experienced Tristan's creation at close hand, shows how Wagner's contemporaries were aware of the degree to which the opera was the beginning of modern music. In a letter, he wrote 'Nobody had expected Wagner to write such music. It creates a direct connection to late Beethoven .... The musician who still refuses to believe in progress here has no ears!' Every performance of Tristan carries this accumulated historical baggage to some degree.

The 2003 production by Nikolaus Lehnhoff of Tristan und Isolde represents the first introduction of a Wagner opera into the Glyndebourne repertoire. It confronts the historical baggage directly, reducing Tristan's complex web of symbols and meaning into elemental images. The opening act occurs in front of a geometric spiral that represents the womb, a stark clue to the inner-directed and intimate nature of this production. Light and shadow envelop the stage. Settings for the action: ship, garden, castle, are treated as scenic cyphers and are judged as not requiring scenic representation. According to the producer, the setting of the plot is the soul. ""The soul's cosmogony can be experienced even before the realities of time and space are neutralised at the opera's end."" Tristan is about the conflict between night and meaning. Imprisoned in the dungeon of the world, the only freedom is death. Death is revealed as savior and as love's only safe harbor, and its symbol or sign is night. What passes for life and for meaning is bound to light and the daytime. Tristan occurs somewhere in the interstices between light and darkness. We infer it from Wagner's comments and directions.

This production is brilliant in its simplicity: acting and singing are appropriate in their intimacy, superb in their execution. There are no weak links. Nina Stemme is a wonderful Isolde. Robert Gambill an excellent Tristan. Bo Skovhus as Kurwenal and Rene Pape as King Marke are exemplary. The London Philharmonic play magnificently under Jiri Belohlavek. From top to bottom, this production exhibits intelligence and taste. The Opus Arte presentation is excellent, as well. Six hours of material is spread across three discs. The recording in both PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 surround sound is warmly natural and lifelike, complimenting the production's warmth and intimacy. The enclosed glossy booklet is informative. There are more than two hours of film extras included.

Now my favorite DVD of Tristan, this is a brilliant production that treats its audience with respect. Lovingly produced, it invites repeated viewing as a method of enticing Tristan's meaning from beneath the shroud of darkness. Glyndebourne's inaugural Wagner entry is a profound success. Most strongly recommended.

3063194,5,B00118DQXI,"Wagner was a difficult and contradictory Man. His endless talking about his work and himself,he admitted did cause him problems. When not composing he would write about everything, which he thought worked off his spleen. So, there are those who attempt to divorce the Man from  his  music. You cannot. They are both intertwined. But his hard life and suffering,obviously caused by deep psychological problems, did enable him like some shamanic figure to delve deep within, reaching another dimension. For example,Sitting Bull of Custer last stand  fame, could go into trances to foretell the future via rituals of suffering. Wagner was able to go into another world, and create music of other worldly quality. His libretto's had a certain logic to them, as did his music which had a sure hand. He could not hold onto money,no matter how much he borrowed. He was a wanderer with a dream, which he succeeded in delivering. Even when settled with Cosima and his family in Bayreuth, he did venture with them to Italy. A German nationalist, who thought he created Germanic Myths for a new Germany. But he admitted to Lizst, that even he ,Wagner, did not really understand what he had written. About Tristan he wrote, I do not know how I wrote it.

In Zurich 1857, he was given a house by  Otto Wesendonk, which was next door to him. He had an affair with his wife Mathilde. Wagners wife Minna found out about it, and because of the fuss had to leave. Moving to Venice  he continued with Tristan and finished the work in Vienna March 1859. In 1864 in Munich, he came under the wing of his admirer King Ludwig the second. His troubles should have been over. They only begun. The first performance of this work was held at the Munich state opera on the 10th march 1865.

While living in Zurich 1n 1852,  when he wrote to Liszt,he mentioned Schopenhauer and his planned Tristan. Schopenhauer was greatly influenced by Buddhism and Hindu Brahmanism. His philosophy is this, ""the wills free denial of itself. This entails the denial of representations and of the world as representation:hense, the resultant nothingness is a positive gain compared to the misery of existence prior to the will denying itself. Music he wrote does not copy ideas;it is an expression of the will itself"" (D. Hamlyn Routledge 1980 ).In otherwords, the denial of self and renunciation of individuality. Naturally, this is certainly not Wagners life style. However,when his life was at his lowest ebb, he could write the Libretto of the Meistersingers. He could go into another dimension. When he returned, his psychlogical baggage kicked in. This happens when one is distance running. I know, I was a ultra runner for 18 years, running distances over 161 kms. You go into another world of peace and time stands still.

Let us look at the Libretto of Tristan. He sings in the love duet, ""Spiteful day. Its idle pomp,its vainglorious show,is derided by the man whose sight has been blessed by night. The illusions of Day renown and reputation, power and profit, so magnificently glittering disperse like barren particles in the sun  before the Man  who looks with love  upon nights death."" Tristan and isolde"" O sink down upon me, night of love, make me forget I am alive, take me up to your bosom, set me free of the world.""(Cochrane 1961). Once one understands that this is not gibberish, but is Wagners attempt to portray the astral planes. The word astral is mentioned in Turnbulls excellent lecture. In do I hear the light, Aeschlimann set designer of the womb like space on the stage, refers to Buddhism. Lehnhoff refers to the setting of the plot as the soul. For the ship, garden and castle do not require scenic representation. The love duet is coloured by a deep cobalt blue. This symbolises the night,the soul. The day is grey,everyday life. The idea is that Tristan and isolde both enter Nirvana. Where there is nothingness,no rebirth, unless like Buddha, you choose to. Gained when there is no desire,nor materialistic values. Possibly, Wagner misunderstood this state, and saw it as eternal love, without the physical lust.

Wagner did write a sketch for die Sieger,based on an incident in Buddhas life while first reading Schopenhauers philosophy. Which he read and reread. He rewrote the ending to Gotterdammerung, when Brunnhilde sings her last aria. He changed it later on. ""to the holiest chosen land,free from desire and delusion,the goal of world wandering,redeemed from rebirth,the enlightened one now goes."" (Millington 1992 Thames and Hudson pg 298). In Parsival, in the libretto, the word reincarnation is mentioned. So is the rebirths that Kundry has. Millington writes that in a letter to Liszt 7 june 1855,""modern research has shown that Christianity is no more and no less than a branch of that venerable Buddhist religion which following Alexanders Indian campaign, found its way, among other places, to the shores of the mediterranean"".An interesting idea. I hope that this article shows Wagners later operas in a different light. That Tristan and Parsival can be understood.

Although, ten minutes of Act two are cut, still I give it five stars. It has attempted to capture the inner and spiritual side of Tristan. It is not just a story about a woman who hated tristan for killing her beloved. Then looks into his eyes when he is wounded in the fight, as she is about to kill him. When well, he arranges for her to marry his King, Marke. She wants to die with Tristan, so she give him a death potion. But Brangaena gives them a love potion. Hense,they immediately have sex. The love duet, if you can call that, is the sexual act put to music. Eventually at the end of Act three they do die. She sees his ghost,because he dies first. Nina Stemme is brilliant as Isolde. Gambill is quite good as Tristan. Not as good as Jerusalem in the same part,who is. Brangane holds her own. Bo Skovius and rene Pape are a credit to the opera. The London Phil conducted by Jiri Belohlavek is one of the reasons why this is such a great performance. Jiri speeds are right for this piece, swift tempi when required. He keeps the piece tight. Another good performance in the five star bracket, is the Tristan staged by Heiner Muller in 1995. Inspired by Mondrians formalism and Rothko's abstractions. Mullers view is, that no one wants to die. The singing of Jerusalem,Meier,as Isolde,Holle, Priew and Struckmann are perfect. The conductor is Barenboim who brings into place his Furtwangler leanings. Very Beautiful. Get both if you can. The traditionalists will find these DVD's to their taste.",1308528000,7,6575,4.838078291814947
3063195,3,B00118DQXI,"I am a person who hates cuts and am of an opinion that if you don't want to watch/listen to a Wagner opera without cuts then don't watch/listen to it at all. I tolerate it in old recordings (30's and 40's) from the Met and Covent Garden, but most certainly not of something that is from in this day and age.
With this in mind I have to say that this otherwise wonderful performance is cut in the 2nd act. 10 minutes of wonderful music is cut from a performance done in the 21st Century. Incredible, right?
I thought that all the singers, especially Stemme and Pape were wonderful. The sound was good but could be better, not being even in the same league as the wonderful Bayreuth performance with Schneider.
Stemme is such a wonder as Isolde. She projects both strength and power, in addition to beauty and youth, like no one else nowadays. Gambill was quite good and his acting was good. Pape's Marke too was wonderful, so heartfelt and beautiful, like his performance for Levine (but supported by a much better conductor this time around).

Again I wish to stress the fact why I gave it three stars instead of five. The opera is cut. Knowing myself, I wouldn't have bought the Blu-ray if I knew this fact. I find this a serious offense that it warrants the removal of two stars from the rating. If the performance was done of the uncut opera I would have given it five stars. It seems like we still have to look toward Bayreuth to be guaranteed an uncut performance of a Wagner opera.",1302566400,29,1487,4.427007299270073

This one is 3 DVD PCM Stereo and DTS.Stemme is really great in the role of Isolde and Gambill,I have on another with Waltraud Meier,is also good as Tristan.

It's great for a modern production and the singing is absolutely great. I highly recommend it!!! You won't be disappointed at all.

3063197,5,B00118DQXI,"I have never attended the Glyndebourne Festival, but I have seen a number of its productions on video. I've been impressed by the consistently high standard of singing and conducting, and by productions that are interesting and innovative without going off the deep end. These qualities are certainly apparent in this 2007 ""Tristan"". This was the first Wagner opera to be staged at Glyndebourne, after the enlargement of the house made it feasible.
The cast is excellent. Nina Stemme is the real thing as Isolde. She sings with strength throughout her range, with a fine legato line and some lovely soft singing. And she has power in reserve for the big moments. She is also a physically attractive woman and an excellent actress. The Tristan is Robert Gambill, who began by singing Mozart and Rossini but a few years back reinvented himself as a Heldenteonr. He sounds pretty convincing, singing with both power and lyricism. I'm not sure I buy his let-it-all-hang-out approach to the third act delirium scene. I've always thought Tristan should show a certain knightly poise even under these conditions, but Gambill sings persuasively, and his stamina is impressive. Unfortunately, he looks rather awkward on stage, making his heroics less convincing. He is not helped by the stringy, greasy-looking wig the costumer inflicted on him; he loses it for the third act, but the buzz-cut look is no great improvement. Katarina Karn&eacute;us is a lovely Brang&auml;ne, showing off her fine high mezzo-soprano and interacting well with Stemme. Bo Skovhus is a solid, knightly Kurwenal; he conveys his devotion to Tristan without going overboard. I only wish his voice were stonger in the low register, where some notes get lost. Ren&eacute; Pape sings Marke's music beautifully and brings out his utter bewilderment at the turn of events. The conductor Jiri Belohlavek was known to me by name, but I'd never heard his work. He is a fine Wagner conductor, fully expressing the passion and sensuality of the music while keeping a firm hand on the long musical line. His only miscalculation is the appearance of Isolde's ship in Act III, where his tempo is simply too fast. The singers are to be congratulated for keeping up! (Listen to Furtw&auml;ngler's mix of weight and excitement to hear how this passage should be handled.)
The staging is interesting. I think ""Tristan"" responds better than the other Wagner operas to an abstract production because not much ""happens"" in this very internal drama. The single set is a sort of spiral structure, which one reviewer compared to a giant slinky. It can evoke any number of things, and the imaginative lighting allows it to do so. The singers sometimes look uncomfortable moving on the curved surfaces, but on the whole I think it works. There are a few odd things in the production; for example, I can't for the life of me figure out what the Shepherd in Act III is supposed to be wearing on his head. The staging falls down in two passages that need realism - the Tristan/Melot duel in Act II and Kurwenal's battle with Marke's retainers in Act III. Both are perfunctory, especially the latter - Kurwenal goes offstage to fight and then returns to die unconvincingly. It seems that the director is so caught up in his ""concept"" that he can't be bothered with things like swordfights. I did like the final ""Liebestod"", with light only on Isolde, the other characters having vanished into the darkness that finally consumes Isolde as well - very effective.
Opus Arte provides is usual deluxe presentation, including interesting interviews with cast, conductor, and director, and a rather strange lecture on the musical structure by an elderly repetiteur. He delivers it in impenetrable German (thank heavens for subtitles!), and he plays the musical examples on the piano, very poorly, from a score that looks like it dates from Wagner's time!",1282089600,3,3885,4.987673343605547
3063198,5,B00118DQXI,"Tristan and Isolde was composed during a break in the composition of the Ring cycle. Writing the story first as a love poem and then setting the music, Wagner created perhaps the most beautiful love-poem in all opera. This typically lengthy work is almost devoid of action, but the performers need excellent acting skills to convey the emotional and psychological feelings and interactions of the characters. And it goes without saying, that only singers of the highest calibre are capable of handling this most demanding work. For those who lack patience and demand action, this work is not for you - yet. But the listener with a more mature perspective is rewarded with some of the most beautiful music in the operatic repertoire.

A demanding work demands performers of the highest calibre. Nina Stemme as Isolde, and Robert Gambill s Tristan, meet the challenge superbly with brilliant performances that reveal all the psychological subtleties of their characters. And although the cast members are all excellent, Katarina Karn&eacute;us as Brang&auml;ne must also rate a special mention.

For this production, Stage Director Nikolaus Lehnhoff elected to use a simple but exquisite abstract set by Roland Aeschlimann, with its womb-like feel being well-suited to the work. Complimented by subtle but brilliant lighting design, these factors allow the performers to give full expression to this masterpiece. The London Philharmonic rise above themselves, and combined with the Glyndebourne Chorus, respond to every nuance of conductor, Jir&iacute; Belohl&aacute;vek's highly perceptive interpretation.

I have several versions of the work, and I had to discard the Met production for its contrived camera work. No such problems here. Recorded with High Definition digital cameras, the image is very sharp, and camera work and editing have provided the viewer with an excellent perspective of the performance. Sound is simply brilliant. I first had this version on DVD, but it is so close to perfection, that I had to have it on Blu-ray. The DVD was of the highest technical quality, it forebode a wonderful Blu-ray version, and I was not disappointed. Without doubt, this is my number one version of Tristan and Isolde.

Having seen the review claiming this to be significantly cut caused me recently, to do a search. Other performances, Blu-ray or DVD ALL time at around 100 minutes shorter than this version, Now, although unstated, this timing of almost 360 minutes may include the documentary content as well, but although I haven't timed it, I doubt it runs for 100 minutes. The main documentary ony ran for around 15 min., so I am afraid said reviewer is to be frustrated if he thinks he can obtain a ""more complete"" version. And another note. Anyone familiar with opera performances, knows that cuts are a standard event. The conductor makes these to marry the production with his interpretation. This can vary from the odd bar here and there, to complete scenes. One PS. There is a performance (DVD only) available in Europe that is a little longer than this; and its under Barenboim, a brilliant Wagnerian. However, I didn't look to see how much ""documentary"" material is included in the ""longer version"". At its price, I would guess it's not worth the expenditure.

As the opera progressed, I was very impressed at the stamina and careful and thoughtful acting of all of the singers! I was quite amazed at the intensity and careful character development. I did not fall asleep, I remained there transfixed at the glory of Wagner's music, the voices, and the production. True gesamtkunswerk.

Polaski is a great artist, but her voice has always had some problematic spots, and Johanna Meier, a very fine artist, pales besides these two.
Robert Gambill's Tristan has to fall second to Treleaven, who in the Barcelona performance, is the only Tristan who in spite of some bizarre gestures and vocal inconsistency, has kept my attention fully riveted to him through what can be an interminable Act. Kollo is too expressionless besides these others. Of course, Ben Heppner has the most beautiful voice, but alas, his Isolde!
The supporting cast in all the three sets is excellent, in Barcelona maybe more than that, especially Eric Halfvarson's Marke. Of course Rene Pape has a marvelous voice, but Halfvarson, more human, and motile, is what I prefer.
As I said, Wagnerians will want all these sets.",1207353600,16,1613,4.890510948905109
3297679,5,B00118DQXI,"After getting the video of the Ponnelle/Barenboim/Johanna Meier ""Tristan und Isolde"" which was delisted many years ago, and while I was waiting for it to come out on DVD cleaned up with a better quality of sound, I bought other versions.  For my taste, I found them all substandard (see my review of the aforementioned ""Tristan"").  Then it was issued as a DVD and judging from the many positive reviews most people found it as excellent a production as I did.

Now there is an embarasse de richesse because another excellent production has been released -- different, but equally excellent.  The Ponnelle is more traditional, with a major twist to the ending; whereas the Lehnhoff is more stylised, but faithful to the stated intention of Wagner.

There is but one set for the three acts, a series of circular and semicircular steps which enclose the stage.  But the very imaginative lighting profoundly changes the space and moods. At times it seems very confining, at others it is liberating; at times dark and brooding, at others warm and optimistic.  But the very spareness of the set keeps the focus on the what and why of this powerful opera.  It is very imaginative and works very well for this production.

Opus Arte, as usual, has served up a technically superlative production with first rate addenda.

I am grateful to Mike Birman for his account of the background to the opera and this production. It saves me from writing something very similar. (Since both of our reviews were written, we have had a correspondence in the ""comment"" section as we straightened out our mutual misunderstandings.  That remains for those interested.  He has since changed a bit of his opening background paragraph, so I am changing my response to it.)  I now fully agree with his facts and tone of his account.  He wrote, ""Tristan is the quintessential opera about eros and it is natural to wonder to what degree these romantic entanglements influenced its genesis"".  I certainly agree, and would like to add another possible example.

Since I referred to the twist in the Ponnelle production ending, and since other commentators in reviewing that production have given it away, as it were, as well as adversely criticised it I feel free to describe it here.  In that version, Isolde does not come to Tristan at the end -- she is an hallucination, Tristan's unfulfilled desire.  As I wrote in response to that criticism:  ""It may be different, but in light of Wagner's life at the time he wrote it, perhaps it makes sense. His relationship with Mathilda Weisendonck had broken up. Many commentators have written that this explains the yearning so powerfully represented in the music. Perhaps subconsciously he never expected that Isolde would turn up. I can invision Ponnelle in Heaven saying to Wagner, as Brunnhilde said to Wotan, ""I might not have done what you commanded, but I did what you wanted"".

I also have no hesitation in giving this production the full five stars.  Where I differ is in a matter of taste.  Mr. Birman says that this is his favourite DVD of this opera.  (Well, as they say on the Canadian East Coast, ""Some likes an apple and some likes an onion"".)  My favourite DVD production remains the Ponnelle/Bareboim/Johanna Meier one.  This, despite my finding Rene Pape's King Marke by far the best I have seen.  Stemme, Gambill and Karneus all sing extremely powerfully and well, and their acting is also first rate; but their interpretations are not as emotionally nuanced as those of Meier, Kollo and Schwarz -- hence my preference.

To repeat, it is a matter of personal taste.  This is a wonderful production in all respects, and it is really unfair to make comparisons -- not that that has stopped me.  I am glad to have both and, unlike all the others I unfortunately purchased over the years, I will return to them both -- often.  I am grateful to Opus Arte and DGG for these wonderful interpretations.

PS August 26 2008  I have just seen the Barenboim/Muller Tristan with Waltraud Meier and Siegfried Jerusalem.  As a result, for what it is worth, that is now my second choice and this drops to third.  The reason is that I have become increasingly less enchanted by Robert Gambill's singing.",1204329600,62,4271,4.860304287690179
3297680,5,B00118DQXI,"By Wagner's own written comments, composition of Tristan und Isolde was inspired by his love affair with Mathilde Wesendonck and the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Mathilde had married the silk merchant Otto Wesendonck, who was a great admirer of Wagner's music, and after he and Mathilde met the composer in Zurich in 1852, he placed a large cottage on his estate at Wagner's disposal. By 1857, Wagner had become thoroughly enamored with Mathilde. Wagner wrote voluminously and admitted to returning the many favors Otto had done for him by seeking the romantic favors of his wife. Wagner maintained a relationship with Mathilde for some time while composing Tristan. Tristan was composed between 1857 and 1859, premiering 10 June 1865 under the baton of Hans von Blow in Munich, despite the fact that Wagner was now having an affair with his wife, Cosima. All three wrote extensively about this strange turn of events. Wagner, of course, was still married to his first wife Minna. Tristan is the quintessential opera about eros and it is natural to wonder to what degree these romantic entanglements influenced its genesis. The complexity of Tristan insured that critical opinion was initially less than favorable. Eduard Hanslick, the most influential 19th Century music critic, said that Tristan ""reminded him of the old Italian painting of a martyr whose intestines are slowly unwound from his body on a reel."" Opinion quickly changed and Tristan has remained in the repertory ever since. These events, all carefully verified as to their factual nature by musicologists, make up some of the historical background to perhaps the single greatest opera, certainly the most influential, of the 19th century. Tristan is without question a brilliant opera and its importance in musical history is without precedent.

The score of Tristan und Isolde has often been called a landmark in the development of Western music. From its opening chord, the famous 'Tristan Chord' f-b-d#-g# which resolves to another dissonant chord, there is a feeling of ambiguous tonality throughout the opera. Techniques used by Wagner were to prove influential in the gradual movement away from tonality that was the hallmark of the 20th Century. Hans von Bulow, who experienced Tristan's creation at close hand, shows how Wagner's contemporaries were aware of the degree to which the opera was the beginning of modern music. In a letter, he wrote 'Nobody had expected Wagner to write such music. It creates a direct connection to late Beethoven .... The musician who still refuses to believe in progress here has no ears!' Every performance of Tristan carries this accumulated historical baggage to some degree.

The 2003 production by Nikolaus Lehnhoff of Tristan und Isolde represents the first introduction of a Wagner opera into the Glyndebourne repertoire. It confronts the historical baggage directly, reducing Tristan's complex web of symbols and meaning into elemental images. The opening act occurs in front of a geometric spiral that represents the womb, a stark clue to the inner-directed and intimate nature of this production. Light and shadow envelop the stage. Settings for the action: ship, garden, castle, are treated as scenic cyphers and are judged as not requiring scenic representation. According to the producer, the setting of the plot is the soul. ""The soul's cosmogony can be experienced even before the realities of time and space are neutralised at the opera's end."" Tristan is about the conflict between night and meaning. Imprisoned in the dungeon of the world, the only freedom is death. Death is revealed as savior and as love's only safe harbor, and its symbol or sign is night. What passes for life and for meaning is bound to light and the daytime. Tristan occurs somewhere in the interstices between light and darkness. We infer it from Wagner's comments and directions.

This production is brilliant in its simplicity: acting and singing are appropriate in their intimacy, superb in their execution. There are no weak links. Nina Stemme is a wonderful Isolde. Robert Gambill an excellent Tristan. Bo Skovhus as Kurwenal and Rene Pape as King Marke are exemplary. The London Philharmonic play magnificently under Jiri Belohlavek. From top to bottom, this production exhibits intelligence and taste. The Opus Arte presentation is excellent, as well. Six hours of material is spread across three discs. The recording in both PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 surround sound is warmly natural and lifelike, complimenting the production's warmth and intimacy. The enclosed glossy booklet is informative. There are more than two hours of film extras included.

Now my favorite DVD of Tristan, this is a brilliant production that treats its audience with respect. Lovingly produced, it invites repeated viewing as a method of enticing Tristan's meaning from beneath the shroud of darkness. Glyndebourne's inaugural Wagner entry is a profound success. Most strongly recommended.

3297691,5,B00118DQXI,"Wagner was a difficult and contradictory Man. His endless talking about his work and himself,he admitted did cause him problems. When not composing he would write about everything, which he thought worked off his spleen. So, there are those who attempt to divorce the Man from  his  music. You cannot. They are both intertwined. But his hard life and suffering,obviously caused by deep psychological problems, did enable him like some shamanic figure to delve deep within, reaching another dimension. For example,Sitting Bull of Custer last stand  fame, could go into trances to foretell the future via rituals of suffering. Wagner was able to go into another world, and create music of other worldly quality. His libretto's had a certain logic to them, as did his music which had a sure hand. He could not hold onto money,no matter how much he borrowed. He was a wanderer with a dream, which he succeeded in delivering. Even when settled with Cosima and his family in Bayreuth, he did venture with them to Italy. A German nationalist, who thought he created Germanic Myths for a new Germany. But he admitted to Lizst, that even he ,Wagner, did not really understand what he had written. About Tristan he wrote, I do not know how I wrote it.

In Zurich 1857, he was given a house by  Otto Wesendonk, which was next door to him. He had an affair with his wife Mathilde. Wagners wife Minna found out about it, and because of the fuss had to leave. Moving to Venice  he continued with Tristan and finished the work in Vienna March 1859. In 1864 in Munich, he came under the wing of his admirer King Ludwig the second. His troubles should have been over. They only begun. The first performance of this work was held at the Munich state opera on the 10th march 1865.

While living in Zurich 1n 1852,  when he wrote to Liszt,he mentioned Schopenhauer and his planned Tristan. Schopenhauer was greatly influenced by Buddhism and Hindu Brahmanism. His philosophy is this, ""the wills free denial of itself. This entails the denial of representations and of the world as representation:hense, the resultant nothingness is a positive gain compared to the misery of existence prior to the will denying itself. Music he wrote does not copy ideas;it is an expression of the will itself"" (D. Hamlyn Routledge 1980 ).In otherwords, the denial of self and renunciation of individuality. Naturally, this is certainly not Wagners life style. However,when his life was at his lowest ebb, he could write the Libretto of the Meistersingers. He could go into another dimension. When he returned, his psychlogical baggage kicked in. This happens when one is distance running. I know, I was a ultra runner for 18 years, running distances over 161 kms. You go into another world of peace and time stands still.

Let us look at the Libretto of Tristan. He sings in the love duet, ""Spiteful day. Its idle pomp,its vainglorious show,is derided by the man whose sight has been blessed by night. The illusions of Day renown and reputation, power and profit, so magnificently glittering disperse like barren particles in the sun  before the Man  who looks with love  upon nights death."" Tristan and isolde"" O sink down upon me, night of love, make me forget I am alive, take me up to your bosom, set me free of the world.""(Cochrane 1961). Once one understands that this is not gibberish, but is Wagners attempt to portray the astral planes. The word astral is mentioned in Turnbulls excellent lecture. In do I hear the light, Aeschlimann set designer of the womb like space on the stage, refers to Buddhism. Lehnhoff refers to the setting of the plot as the soul. For the ship, garden and castle do not require scenic representation. The love duet is coloured by a deep cobalt blue. This symbolises the night,the soul. The day is grey,everyday life. The idea is that Tristan and isolde both enter Nirvana. Where there is nothingness,no rebirth, unless like Buddha, you choose to. Gained when there is no desire,nor materialistic values. Possibly, Wagner misunderstood this state, and saw it as eternal love, without the physical lust.

Wagner did write a sketch for die Sieger,based on an incident in Buddhas life while first reading Schopenhauers philosophy. Which he read and reread. He rewrote the ending to Gotterdammerung, when Brunnhilde sings her last aria. He changed it later on. ""to the holiest chosen land,free from desire and delusion,the goal of world wandering,redeemed from rebirth,the enlightened one now goes."" (Millington 1992 Thames and Hudson pg 298). In Parsival, in the libretto, the word reincarnation is mentioned. So is the rebirths that Kundry has. Millington writes that in a letter to Liszt 7 june 1855,""modern research has shown that Christianity is no more and no less than a branch of that venerable Buddhist religion which following Alexanders Indian campaign, found its way, among other places, to the shores of the mediterranean"".An interesting idea. I hope that this article shows Wagners later operas in a different light. That Tristan and Parsival can be understood.

Although, ten minutes of Act two are cut, still I give it five stars. It has attempted to capture the inner and spiritual side of Tristan. It is not just a story about a woman who hated tristan for killing her beloved. Then looks into his eyes when he is wounded in the fight, as she is about to kill him. When well, he arranges for her to marry his King, Marke. She wants to die with Tristan, so she give him a death potion. But Brangaena gives them a love potion. Hense,they immediately have sex. The love duet, if you can call that, is the sexual act put to music. Eventually at the end of Act three they do die. She sees his ghost,because he dies first. Nina Stemme is brilliant as Isolde. Gambill is quite good as Tristan. Not as good as Jerusalem in the same part,who is. Brangane holds her own. Bo Skovius and rene Pape are a credit to the opera. The London Phil conducted by Jiri Belohlavek is one of the reasons why this is such a great performance. Jiri speeds are right for this piece, swift tempi when required. He keeps the piece tight. Another good performance in the five star bracket, is the Tristan staged by Heiner Muller in 1995. Inspired by Mondrians formalism and Rothko's abstractions. Mullers view is, that no one wants to die. The singing of Jerusalem,Meier,as Isolde,Holle, Priew and Struckmann are perfect. The conductor is Barenboim who brings into place his Furtwangler leanings. Very Beautiful. Get both if you can. The traditionalists will find these DVD's to their taste.",1308528000,7,6575,4.838078291814947
3297692,3,B00118DQXI,"I am a person who hates cuts and am of an opinion that if you don't want to watch/listen to a Wagner opera without cuts then don't watch/listen to it at all. I tolerate it in old recordings (30's and 40's) from the Met and Covent Garden, but most certainly not of something that is from in this day and age.
With this in mind I have to say that this otherwise wonderful performance is cut in the 2nd act. 10 minutes of wonderful music is cut from a performance done in the 21st Century. Incredible, right?
I thought that all the singers, especially Stemme and Pape were wonderful. The sound was good but could be better, not being even in the same league as the wonderful Bayreuth performance with Schneider.
Stemme is such a wonder as Isolde. She projects both strength and power, in addition to beauty and youth, like no one else nowadays. Gambill was quite good and his acting was good. Pape's Marke too was wonderful, so heartfelt and beautiful, like his performance for Levine (but supported by a much better conductor this time around).

Again I wish to stress the fact why I gave it three stars instead of five. The opera is cut. Knowing myself, I wouldn't have bought the Blu-ray if I knew this fact. I find this a serious offense that it warrants the removal of two stars from the rating. If the performance was done of the uncut opera I would have given it five stars. It seems like we still have to look toward Bayreuth to be guaranteed an uncut performance of a Wagner opera.",1302566400,29,1487,4.427007299270073

3297694,5,B00118DQXI,"I have never attended the Glyndebourne Festival, but I have seen a number of its productions on video. I've been impressed by the consistently high standard of singing and conducting, and by productions that are interesting and innovative without going off the deep end. These qualities are certainly apparent in this 2007 ""Tristan"". This was the first Wagner opera to be staged at Glyndebourne, after the enlargement of the house made it feasible.
The cast is excellent. Nina Stemme is the real thing as Isolde. She sings with strength throughout her range, with a fine legato line and some lovely soft singing. And she has power in reserve for the big moments. She is also a physically attractive woman and an excellent actress. The Tristan is Robert Gambill, who began by singing Mozart and Rossini but a few years back reinvented himself as a Heldenteonr. He sounds pretty convincing, singing with both power and lyricism. I'm not sure I buy his let-it-all-hang-out approach to the third act delirium scene. I've always thought Tristan should show a certain knightly poise even under these conditions, but Gambill sings persuasively, and his stamina is impressive. Unfortunately, he looks rather awkward on stage, making his heroics less convincing. He is not helped by the stringy, greasy-looking wig the costumer inflicted on him; he loses it for the third act, but the buzz-cut look is no great improvement. Katarina Karn&eacute;us is a lovely Brang&auml;ne, showing off her fine high mezzo-soprano and interacting well with Stemme. Bo Skovhus is a solid, knightly Kurwenal; he conveys his devotion to Tristan without going overboard. I only wish his voice were stonger in the low register, where some notes get lost. Ren&eacute; Pape sings Marke's music beautifully and brings out his utter bewilderment at the turn of events. The conductor Jiri Belohlavek was known to me by name, but I'd never heard his work. He is a fine Wagner conductor, fully expressing the passion and sensuality of the music while keeping a firm hand on the long musical line. His only miscalculation is the appearance of Isolde's ship in Act III, where his tempo is simply too fast. The singers are to be congratulated for keeping up! (Listen to Furtw&auml;ngler's mix of weight and excitement to hear how this passage should be handled.)
The staging is interesting. I think ""Tristan"" responds better than the other Wagner operas to an abstract production because not much ""happens"" in this very internal drama. The single set is a sort of spiral structure, which one reviewer compared to a giant slinky. It can evoke any number of things, and the imaginative lighting allows it to do so. The singers sometimes look uncomfortable moving on the curved surfaces, but on the whole I think it works. There are a few odd things in the production; for example, I can't for the life of me figure out what the Shepherd in Act III is supposed to be wearing on his head. The staging falls down in two passages that need realism - the Tristan/Melot duel in Act II and Kurwenal's battle with Marke's retainers in Act III. Both are perfunctory, especially the latter - Kurwenal goes offstage to fight and then returns to die unconvincingly. It seems that the director is so caught up in his ""concept"" that he can't be bothered with things like swordfights. I did like the final ""Liebestod"", with light only on Isolde, the other characters having vanished into the darkness that finally consumes Isolde as well - very effective.
Opus Arte provides is usual deluxe presentation, including interesting interviews with cast, conductor, and director, and a rather strange lecture on the musical structure by an elderly repetiteur. He delivers it in impenetrable German (thank heavens for subtitles!), and he plays the musical examples on the piano, very poorly, from a score that looks like it dates from Wagner's time!",1282089600,3,3885,4.987673343605547
3297695,5,B00118DQXI,"Tristan and Isolde was composed during a break in the composition of the Ring cycle. Writing the story first as a love poem and then setting the music, Wagner created perhaps the most beautiful love-poem in all opera. This typically lengthy work is almost devoid of action, but the performers need excellent acting skills to convey the emotional and psychological feelings and interactions of the characters. And it goes without saying, that only singers of the highest calibre are capable of handling this most demanding work. For those who lack patience and demand action, this work is not for you - yet. But the listener with a more mature perspective is rewarded with some of the most beautiful music in the operatic repertoire.

A demanding work demands performers of the highest calibre. Nina Stemme as Isolde, and Robert Gambill s Tristan, meet the challenge superbly with brilliant performances that reveal all the psychological subtleties of their characters. And although the cast members are all excellent, Katarina Karn&eacute;us as Brang&auml;ne must also rate a special mention.

For this production, Stage Director Nikolaus Lehnhoff elected to use a simple but exquisite abstract set by Roland Aeschlimann, with its womb-like feel being well-suited to the work. Complimented by subtle but brilliant lighting design, these factors allow the performers to give full expression to this masterpiece. The London Philharmonic rise above themselves, and combined with the Glyndebourne Chorus, respond to every nuance of conductor, Jir&iacute; Belohl&aacute;vek's highly perceptive interpretation.

I have several versions of the work, and I had to discard the Met production for its contrived camera work. No such problems here. Recorded with High Definition digital cameras, the image is very sharp, and camera work and editing have provided the viewer with an excellent perspective of the performance. Sound is simply brilliant. I first had this version on DVD, but it is so close to perfection, that I had to have it on Blu-ray. The DVD was of the highest technical quality, it forebode a wonderful Blu-ray version, and I was not disappointed. Without doubt, this is my number one version of Tristan and Isolde.

Having seen the review claiming this to be significantly cut caused me recently, to do a search. Other performances, Blu-ray or DVD ALL time at around 100 minutes shorter than this version, Now, although unstated, this timing of almost 360 minutes may include the documentary content as well, but although I haven't timed it, I doubt it runs for 100 minutes. The main documentary ony ran for around 15 min., so I am afraid said reviewer is to be frustrated if he thinks he can obtain a ""more complete"" version. And another note. Anyone familiar with opera performances, knows that cuts are a standard event. The conductor makes these to marry the production with his interpretation. This can vary from the odd bar here and there, to complete scenes. One PS. There is a performance (DVD only) available in Europe that is a little longer than this; and its under Barenboim, a brilliant Wagnerian. However, I didn't look to see how much ""documentary"" material is included in the ""longer version"". At its price, I would guess it's not worth the expenditure.

8240942,5,B00118DQXI,Outstanding performance by Nina Stemme-one of the great Wagnerian's! Fine performances all around! Great production! The conducting and orchestra sound great!,1378080000,,158,6.571428571428571
8240943,1,B00118DQXI,"Ordered the BD and sat down to watch it last night.

This is a terrible video encode, very disappointing.
Although the low contrast is annoying, what is unforgivable is the weird cross-hatch pattern showing up across the lighter areas of the screen.
It is as though the movie was shot thru a patio screen door.
NOT acceptable and will be sending it back for a refund.",1357862400,6,367,4.5606060606060606
