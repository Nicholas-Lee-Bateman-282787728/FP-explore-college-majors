8057871,4,B00097E6VI,Got this for my sister. We used to watch it a lot growing up. It still has the humor and brings back memories. Some parts are cheesey but that's ok with me. The DVD works great and it arrived sooner than expected.,1431475200,,213,4.095238095238095
8057872,5,B00097E6VI,"I checked several versions of this DVD and found the one by Phil Nibelink's to be the one and only to suite me for my Grand children as well as my Great grandchildred.  I alwalys watch a DVD before I purchase it for them, and I am hard to please, but this was the one.  I thought it was cute and funny, but they loved it and keep watching it over and over.  Can't beat that when it holds a childs interest for a very long time.

8057873,5,B00097E6VI,"This film is definitely old and outdated, but can still be enjoyable among the family. The animation is a bit procrastinated, the lines are a bit cheesy, and yet, it all seems to fit in with the humour of the movie. The DVD shipped was in perfect condition, and brought back cheery memories. I purchased this for my nephew over his first birthday party.",1352332800,,353,4.53125
8057874,4,B00097E6VI,"My 4-year-old son loves this movie... I've had to rent it over and over from the video store, and am finally going to get it for our own library. This, as others have noted, is not your typical high-tech, Pixar quality animated film. But if you appreciate it for it's story and quaint story boarding-type animatics, you're in for a nice treat. One word of caution... there are some scary parts in this if your child is little -- skeletons hanging from trees in one part -- but other than that this is a fun video.",1165881600,3,513,4.354166666666667
8057875,5,B00097E6VI,"Phil Nibbelink has taken a bold step with the animation style of PUSS IN BOOTS, using his characteristically cute character designs in a ""storybook"" style concept quite different from his prior work on ""An American Tale: Fievel Goes West"" or ""We're Back!""  While viewers expecting to see animation comparable to ""Shrek"" are likely to be disappointed, those who sit back and enjoy the story, humor, music and characters are going to be very satisfied.  And speaking of ""Shrek,"" am I the only one who thinks the PUSS IN BOOTS character from ""Shrek 2"" is a CLONE of Nibbelink's design here from six years prior?  Check it out!",1153785600,4,623,4.803738317757009
8057876,4,B00097E6VI,This movie is very well done for a 1999 animation. The voices here do a great job and the songs are wonderful.  Puss in Boots really comes alive!,1137024000,4,145,4.178571428571429
8057877,1,B00097E6VI,"The animation is horrible and the songs are worse.  I can't believe I paid for this, if they would take it back, I'd drive to Wal Mart right now.",1121385600,,145,4.0
