4858237,2,B005QBSSQ6,"This is really more a question than a review as I have not seen the product and I don't think I will based on the information in the product listing.

The description says: ""ONE AND ONLY (unauthorized)is an excellent new documentary about Adele and contains everything you need to know about Adele, the new star in music business.""

The product details also list the running time as 2 minutes.  I'm certain that I'd be interested in knowing more information about Adele than could be presented in two minutes.

Update 2/8/13:  I see that at some point they finally corrected the running time to 44 minutes.  Still, we don't see that many people have viewed and reviewed this, so I'm still not inclined to take a chance, though I'm sure it would be interesting to know more about her life.",1323648000,21,788,4.633093525179856

8483206,1,B005QBSSQ6,"I have not seen this, but unless people are dumber than I already believe! They won't by something for 7 or 8 bucks that they can get of the news stands for  $2-3. This distributer couldn't even find a real picture of Adele. I am an expert by the way. Fake don't waste your money. All you need to know is she is British, Beautiful and extremely talented. Buy her Albums not this crap.",1451088000,3,384,4.1891891891891895
8483207,3,B005QBSSQ6,"Early album that lacks the more powerful enthusiasm of the later works!  Adele had some wonderful songs here but not many that sounded familiar! quick to deliver it so we got to hear it quickly!  As an introduction it has merit!  Amazon was right there, in no time, as always!",1437004800,,276,4.48

8483211,4,B005QBSSQ6,It was very interesting to watch this.  She is a great singer and to hear her life story behind the music is great.,1358985600,,115,4.0
8483212,1,B005QBSSQ6,"This dvd is not what you would expect. It looks like something someone made in their basement. It only has clips from 6 interviews and has no songs etc in here. The last interview is on a talk show and when they announced she was going to sing its cut off, not worth the money that was spent on it.",1330646400,24,298,3.9833333333333334

8483214,5,B005QBSSQ6,"I can't really rank it because I haven't purchase it. So it doesn't count.
But if it's anything that would live up to the immensely talented
Adele, I'm very sure you won't be disappointed if anyone bought this.

I found another link of the same product from a different site.
[...]
It states it's 44 mins long, I'm pretty sure this was a mistake Amazon made.
Unless someone stock up on a 2 min DVD? Which I also found very odd. . . how that clears
anyone's suspicion. I do hope for Amazons sake and our sanity
that if anyone does order it they do get more than 2 mins.",1326844800,4,568,4.163636363636364
