I had this working on an older Mac OS X but recently found that 10.7.5 won't run it...comes up instead with a message about PowerPC apps not being supported.

Secondly, there are break ups in audio, not just at the beginning of clips but throughout them so if the narrator was saying:

""And now let's look at more audio effects."" you might instead hear

""...now....more audio effects.""",1363564800,,455,4.580246913580247
8375923,1,B002OBHULU,"Hi,

I just recently bought Live 8 Tutorial Level 1 & 2 as double DVD package deal thinking I was getting a good deal but unfortunately I'm completely disappointed in the video quality which is in my opinion near vhs analog quality.  I'm running Dell e6420 laptop running Windows 7 64 bit, Intel Core i7 - 2620M CPU @ 2.7 GHz, 4 GB ram, 512 MB NVidia NVS 4200M graphics card which is running the latest video driver, DirectX, and QuickTime and unfortunately the video tutorial is blurry in either minimum or full screen mode on a 24"" monitor display.  The blurriness is still the same even when I'm looking directly through my laptop's 15 lcd screen. I have installed the video tutorial on my work laptop and my personal laptop with the exact same video quality. This is very disappointing and distracting since everything is blurry giving me a headache and causing me to strain my eyes.

Another issue I have is that since I thought this was a DVD tutorial that I would be able to watch it on my home HDTV on my Blu-ray/dvd player but since the files are unfortunately encrypted as avm/mov files I unable to play the DVD tutorial on my dvd player.  It's very disappointing that I can't watch the DVD tutorial on my home Blu-ray/dvd player.

So my only options after spending $80 for this is to either watch this on a pc or mac which has QuickTime media player.  Disappointing since most Windows PC computers use Windows Media Player as default media player.

I was also hoping to save the DVD tutorial videos on my Blackberry Bold device so at least I can try to watch or just listen to the instructional videos but this not an option either.

What a waste of my hard earn money and time!

Please resolve and fix a future resolution to make this DVD tutorial more portable, mobile and useful between any different media devices like a standard dvd player, mobile device, etc..

Thanks",1328832000,,1885,4.530973451327434
