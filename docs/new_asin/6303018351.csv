532722,5,6303018351,"Wild at Heart is less a movie and more a psychological journey. It's hard for me to judge it the way I judge other movies; it simply can't be put under the same standards. Most movies are about entertainment and telling a  story; this movie (like Blue Velvet before it) is about intense emotions,  the darker side of the soul, and the warped mind of director David Lynch.  David Lynch is one of the few directors left who still expresses himself  through his work; he is one of the last true film artists. He indulges  himself here, perhaps to an extreme. I'm not even sure I can say that this  movie ""entertained"" me in the usual sense; but I relished the  experience. His obsessions with Elvis, (impersonated or channeled by  Nicholas Cage in an inspired performance) The Wizard of Oz, (the movie  repeatedly references the classic both concretely and in symbolism) his  desire to opress/victimize women, and the evil inside us all take center  stage here; the story becomes secondary. The story itself is about a couple  whose love borders on an unhealthy obsession, and seems to be founded in  pleasure more than spirit. It is a ""road picture"" if you boil it  down superficially. But this movie is about Lynch's twisted desires and his  desire to twist us as well. The scene where Willem Dafoe's evil,  animalistic character seduces Laura Dern verbally is one of the most  powerful scenes in film. In my mind the release of this movie and the  premiere of ""Twin Peaks"" on television were the events that  started the 90's, at least in an artistic sense. Watch this movie; it is an  intense roller coaster, a visual dream, and an unfiltered look into Lynch's  mind and the American psyche.",911520000,68,1692,4.687074829931973

One: Lula's mother was indeed sexually engaged  ( not specifically shown but implied) with the Cage character at the start of the movie and Two: When the Davoe character enters the motel with Lula, his interaction with her includes a scene where he moves his hand down  her belly and upon her exposed pubic regions..very explicit.  So contrary to other on line comment about censorship of this movie, this movie has been edited and those scenes deleted apparently by Lynch.",1498953600,4,600,4.862745098039215

533055,4,6303018351,"Wild at Heart (1990) stars Laura Dern and Nicolas Cage, with supporting actors Diane Ladd, Isabella Rossellini and Willem Defoe. David Lynch is known for making movies that have a shock element to them, and this one is no exception. The first five minutes of this movie are quite disturbing, and the inclination is to stop watching right then and there. However, the characters in this film are so interesting and real, so it's hard to dismiss this film as just being over the top nonsense. Once again, Lynch is able to pull in the viewer with a story that never ceases to amaze in style, symbolism, and surrealism. The ending of this movie is extra special (I won't reveal it), and is vintage David Lynch, and could arguably add another half a star to the movie. This movie is violent, yet it has a lot of humanity to it. Nicolas Cage's character is a hardened criminal, yet he's likable. This is a love story (unconditional if there ever was), and that's what makes it appealing. This is one of the few David Lynch movies that has a plot that's pretty easy to follow. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, though it can be quite disturbing at times. The special features are nicely done as well. Recommended.",1453420800,2,1203,4.574074074074074

533233,3,6303018351,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Wild at Heart"" [USA, 1990]

1. David Lynch is my favorite director. Wild at Heart is my least favorite of his films. The movie is still good, but Lynch seems to be forcing things together that don't really mesh..

2. This is a darkly comic, punk-rock riff on the American Dream. It is Lynchs funniest film, and has the most quotable lines. Of course, funny is relative with Lynch.

3. The core plot is about Lula and Sailor, two young people in love who are on an us against the world road trip. Lulas insane mother sends her boyfriend off to kill Sailor, and then a hitman off to kill her boyfriend.

4. There are many references to The Wizard of Oz throughout the movie, except the ruby slippers don't work, and you can break down on the yellow brick road, so you have to wander off into the wild. Or small-town Texas.

5. Lula, played by Laura Dern, is the Dorothy character - if Dorothy was raped as a girl and turned into an oversexed chainsmoker that falls for bad boys. Derns real-life mother, Diane Lane, is the Wicked Witch character - if the Wicked Witch was a codependent alcoholic with rage issues.

6. Nicolas Cage plays Sailor, a thief and killer who has an Elvis obsession. And Willem Dafoe steals every scene hes in as a creepy sleazoid. A lot of the rest of the cast comes from Lynchs other projects, Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks.

7. The movie is incredibly over the top. Everyone overacts their characters, but in such a specific way that it forms a complete tapestry.

8. There are plenty of Lynchs trademark visual and verbal non-sequiturs that may or may not make sense, and that you may or may not like.

9. There are several awesome scenes in this movie, and it did win some awards. I really like it, but I cant help feeling that it is missing some unnameable key ingredient that his other films have.",1406246400,5,1852,4.423529411764706
533234,1,6303018351,"Based on the reviews, I thought this movie would be a sure winner. Instead, I think it flopped on many fronts. The story is senseless, the parts overacted, and all of the characters unlikable. It's clear that the director has a cult following who claim to have liked this film, but having seen his other work, I think this one really fell short.",1403049600,,345,4.492063492063492

533305,5,6303018351,"Early in his career, Nicholas Cage only made good films which tended to be edgy and with indie film directors. This came to a crashing halt midway through his career and for awhile his name became synonymous with absolute junk movies. But this was the kind of film he made then and it is wonderful. It is directed by David Lynch and costars Laura Dern as his love interest. Early in the film he has an extremely violent episode and ends up in prison. When he comes out, he wants to reclaim Dern as his girlfriend. But this is a David Lynch film so it is a wild ride to accomplish that task. This was a huge sensation abroad and swept the Cannes Film Festival. It wasn't quite as popular here at home but today is considered one of Lynch's classics. It put Dern on the map for the rest of her career. Willem Dafoe has a small role as a total creep and he is wonderful in it!

533418,2,6303018351,"David Lynch.  What can one say?  I mean, there is rarely a comparison to Lynch when it comes to personal style, flare and signature vision.  Cronenberg, on occasion, has delivered a similar `feel', albeit more singular in stretch and certainly nothing as brazenly masterful as `Eraserhead' will always remain.  And yet, there is something about David Lynch that I have since found almost off-putting.  Possibly his inability to progress and or adapt, something that could and possibly should cause me to praise him.  Sadly, the more I see from him the less I'm willing to embrace.

I won't attest to seeing everything Lynch has released.  I still have yet to see any of his shorts or television work (including `Twin Peaks' in any of its forms) and I have not seen `The Straight Story', but I'd think that `Eraserhead', `The Elephant Man', `Blue Velvet', `Wild at Heart', `Lost Highway', Mulholland Dr.' and `INLAND EMPIRE' constitute as enough in order to base a solid opinion of one's career thus far.

My friends hate me for saying this, and I would probably hate something else for saying it too.  You see, that is the feeling one gets when watching a David Lynch film or when examining his filmography.  Lynch is such a unique presence that one can't help but feel compelled to praise him.  His work can feel self-congratulatory at times, and thus a tad off-putting or purposefully avant-garde, and then one can't ignore the fact that he is always true to his aesthetic and thus deserving of respect and at least a smidgen of admiration, despite what one feels about his finished product.  My issue with Lynch, which was really born after my initial viewing of `INLAND EMPIRE' and continues to spill into my reception of his 90's work, is that he seems to regurgitate too many of his own ideas into mirror images or at least mirrored thematics, and not in an way that feels refreshed or at least necessary.  That isn't to say that films like `INLAND EMPIRE' or `Wild at Heart' are bad films, they just don't feel as connective as they need to in order to justify their stark similarities.  `INLAND EMPIRE' and `Mulholland Dr.' both suffer the most from this particular `fault', to the point where `INLAND EMPIRE' comes across cheap and lazy since it borrow so heavily from `Mulholland Dr.', which was exquisite and borderline perfection (arguably Lynch's most mature work to date).  Films like `Lost Highway' and `Wild at Heart' suffer from Lynch's desire to delve into the bizarre to the point where it overtakes his storytelling abilities; hijacking his films and stunting their lyrical progression.

And that brings me to this review (sorry, but I felt the need to lay down some groundwork).

`Wild at Heart' was one of those films I really felt the need to see.  It was one of those blind spots I had in my attempt to embrace all things David Lynch.  Like I said, more recent viewings of his work had left me hesitant to a degree, but the overwhelming goodwill I have towards the man that brought me `Eraserhead' (still one the greatest films I've ever seen), `The Elephant Man' and `Mulholland Dr.' kept me anxious to see it all.  I knew that this was more in line with his more bizarre work, like `Lost Highway' (which I was not a real fan of) but I wanted to see Dern and her mother soak in the scenery (god, those stills looked breathtaking).  So, I finally got a hold of this after almost two years of trying (Netflix tied up and no video rental having a copy).  I'll say this first, it is beautiful to watch.  From a technical standpoint, I was awestruck.  The costumes, the set pieces, the cinematography, Laura Dern; all of it was just drool inducing.  After that though, things started to fall apart for me.

The biggest issue I have with this film is the script.  I know that have come to appreciate that nothing is EVER as it seems with David Lynch.  He just has this uncontrollable urge to mess with everything to the point where it leaves you completely confused as to what you think you're actually witnessing.  But, with `Wild at Heart', he took things to a point where the senselessness of it all seemed to be rather overbearing.  The pulled in faux restraint that he imbues on every scene (faux because you know that his intentional subtlety is only a ploy to illicit more drama) is distracting and creates a feeling of discomfort.  The way he tries to force on us a contrived interwoven fairytale (those silly `Wizard of Oz' references that fail to implant themselves into the actual fabric of the film itself) feel out of place and confused.  Then you have the performances, none of which truly register outside of Dern (who is deliciously bizarre and completely unforgettable).  Cage is gross, channeling a poor Elvis impersonator with no likability whatsoever.  Diane Ladd is so over the top and unrealistic (I know, this Lynch's universe so that should be expected and yet...) that her awards attention and cult admiration is baffling.  I'm usually in love with Lynch's supporting ladies.  I've always stated that Isabella Rossellini should have won the Oscar in 1986 for her brilliant performance in `Blue Velvet' (she wasn't even nominated) and I'd personally doll out nominations to Jeanne Bates (`Eraserhead'), Anne Bancroft (`The Elephant Man') and Patricia Arquette (`Lost Highway') and yet I cannot embrace Ladd's ridiculous performance.

And god, don't get me started on the preposterousness that is Willem Defoe here.

At the end of the day, I just can't get behind this film.  It doesn't make sense and it doesn't contain enough incentive to actually prod me to try and make sense of it.  I know that there are many, many supporters of this film, most of which consider Lynch one of the greatest filmmakers of our time (and on most days I agree with this for the aforementioned reasons in the outset of this review) but I have to call it like I see it, and I see it like this; `Wild at Heart' is at the bottom of Lynch's list of achievements.",1339372800,,5983,4.714423076923077

David Lynch films always walk the thin line between reality, & surrealistic, nightmarish fantasy. Both can be equally as grim & bizarre, & you know what, some of his scenes hit me like a chapter out of my own book. The weird things you see, & unusual characters you meet on your road through life. A strange dj vu resonates in his films. It feels like a half forgotten dream that you had, that is so blurred, that it may just be reality.

This film is no different, filled with strange characters, surrealism, nightmarish scenes, & one helluva scene stealing performance by William Dafoe, as the physically grotesque, pure unadulterated evil, Bobby Peru. Hired by the equally scene chewing, evil, Diana Ladd, mother to ""Lula,"" (Laura Dern's real life mother) Laura Dern, to kill ""Saylor,"" Nicholas Cage, who has ran off with her daughter, but her reasons for wanting him dead is much deeper than that!

One scene really haunts this film. Lula & Saylor are driving down a lonely desert highway at night, & run upon a car wreck. There is a girl left alive, & the tragic pathos of this scene gets to me every time. It is truly a heart rendering experience, that one will never forget. Those of you who have seen this movie, will know what I'm talking about. I won't say anymore, for those who have not watched this film, other than Chris Issak's song, ""Wicked Game,"" will haunt your mind forever. A brilliant score to this truly transcendently beautiful scene of tragedy.

""Wild at Heart"" is a quasi, nightmarish, ""Wizard of Oz"" road movie in reverse, reverse of everything that movie is & more! This is one of Lynch's most straight forward films. There is no contemplating what this film's message is afterwards. It is a film of love, hate, fear, ambition, & desperation. A film that can in trance the viewer with all it's ugly glory. A film about the baser side of life that most people never see, or pretend it's not there, & one more thing, this is my favorite Lynch film by far! Along with ""A Clockwork Orange,"" one of the most brilliant films in cinema!",1334361600,2,2079,4.595687331536388

533475,3,6303018351,"My introduction to the work of David Lynch came years ago when Eraserhead was first released. Then years later, I saw and liked both Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive. So late last year, after reading quite a few positive reviews, I decided to add Wild at Heart and Inland Empire to my collection. Inland Empire proved to be so unwatchable (I still have yet to sit through the whole thing) that I put off watching Wild At Heart until just last week.
Well, I should have watched Wild At Heart first. Contrary to what some reviewers say, it does have a storyline (a twisted love story) you can follow if you pay close attention. And paying close attention seems to be the key to even beginning to understand any David Lynch film.
Those familiar with Lynch films will not be surprised to find that Wild at Heart is liberally filled with the kind of low-life degenerates and assorted wierdos that typically populate his cinematic world. There is hardly a single likeable character in the film. The average viewer will alternate between feelings of contempt and revulsion as Lynch's characters parade before their eyes.
Despite the convoluted and downright silly ""plot"", some rather decent performances were turned in. Nicolas Cage makes an excellent greaseball with that silly disco-daddy snakeskin jacket and his Elvis affectations. Laura Dern is easy on the eyes as always and pulled off her role as a mixed-up and profoundly disturbed skank quite well. Other key characters were equally on top of their games. But the best performance of all was turned in by Willem Dafoe whose movie character is so very nearly sub-human that the viewer is delighted when he is ultimately ventilated in a hail of police bullets.
Overall, I enjoyed the movie enough to where I wouldn't object if a visitor wanted to watch it, but Wild at Heart doesn't have near the intensity of Blue Velvet or the often morbid sensuality that animates Mulholland Drive. If you get this edition, you may find that watching the extras first enhances your enjoyment of the main feature.",1206921600,6,2048,4.837606837606837

533549,5,6303018351,"A simple film by David Lynch. Of course you have suspense. Of course you have a good thriller. Of course too you have a good love story and gangster story intertwined. But there is something more than that in this simple film. David Lynch, for an unreasonable, i.e. unexplainable, reason decides to have a good sentimental positive ending. That enables us to draw a lesson from the rest of the film and transform a simple gangster story into a philosophical story about family and parents. A possessive mother can destroy everything around her but there is no reason for the daughter to yield and the daughter will always win against her possessive mother. Even evil witchcraft, or mafia gangsters, will not save the mother's stake. On the other side the father is an indispensable presence in the life of a child, be he a boy or she a girl. The possessive mother will get rid of the father if necessary just like she will get rid of her own lover if he stands in the way of her possessive schizophrenia (to commit suicide with lipstick, ah ah ah). But the father will survive for the daughter as a target to attain and recreate in the man she will choose to love, be impregnated by and ""marry"" in a way or another. But what's more the child born from this union will need a father and will recognize him at first sight even six years after his birth or so. Is this line, this thread going along all David Lynch's films? Maybe not so clearly but yes there is a family problem in all films, a link with some kind of a family, a father, a mother, an aunt, or someone else. The happy ending of this film and the way it is constructed at the very last minute in a very spectacular flight and return scene and then exploited through all the credits seem to show this family link is the essential link in the back of David Lunch's (at least ) subconscious mind. Well done and rather entertaining. And I loved the Deep Creek, Gulch, Stream, Bay or whatever, but Deep anyway, in the middle of a desertic nowhere somewhere in Texas, if it is Texas. As for the setting of some deep tragedy in the deepest layers of the minds of the characters or the dregs of society it is perfect with a heroin called Fortune and a hero called Sailor, that is wet with humor and damp with wit.

In this one, Sailor Ripley (Nick Cage) runs away with his girl, Lula Fortune (Laura Dern). Lula's (and Dern's) mother, Marietta Fortune (Diane Ladd) will seemingly stop at nothing to keep the two apart. Her reasons for this aren't the obvious reasons we would assume them to be, though they aren't all that difficult to ascertain either. As with every Lynch creation, this film is replete with oddball characters, and they are one reason his films are always worth watching. Sailor models his life after Elvis Presley and regales us with renditions of some of his songs. His snakeskin jacket is a symbol of his individuality and personal freedom, the fact of which he reminds us multiple times. Dern spends a good part of the film in various states of undress, which never hurts.

There is raw violence and sexuality mixed with a warped 1950s love story feel at times. Things will be normal for a moment but then BAM! another disturbing image or concept.

These are characters I'd never care to deal with, places I'd avoid vehemently. But I guess that's the whole idea, that this is completely larger than life, painted in tones of wildness and abandon.

If you haven't encountered David Lynch's works, try them. Among his best:

Blue Velvet was wonderful, an addictive mystery in which a town's perfect facade is ripped open to reveal its unsavory and dark secrets.

Mulholland Drive is a dream within a dream that leaves you bewildered but glad you took the ride. It is not a straight, simple plot.

Twin Peaks, the tv show, was unlike anything else. Fun and strange. The first episode is probably one of the best pilots ever done for television.

And another Lynch tv show, On the Air, was a wacky comedy that only lasted a few episodes (unfortunately) about a 1950s tv show crew and cast. Amazingly goofy and cheesy. Wish that would come to dvd.",1162684800,,1464,4.582375478927203

There are just too many set pieces populated by bizarre characters, and somehow you just know that eventually everything will turn out all right despite the lovers' cluelessness.

Some of the production is quite lovely; in other places it's just strange. Willem Dafoe shines as the creepy, reptilian Bobby Peru. Harry Dean Stanton, Grace Zabriskie and Crispin Glover do a fine job of bringing minor but memorable characters to life.

Wild At Heart has all the Lynch signatures we've come to expect, gorgeous visual style, senseless violence, surreal characters, plotless structure - or more properly - lack of structure.

WAH came on the heels of Blue Velvet which, though brutal and disturbing, was plot-driven.  There are certainly many memorable characters, most notably Dell, played by Crispin Glover.  This brief, manic performance threatens to walk off with the movie, which is always a bad sign.  Dafoe as Bobby Peru is unforgettably hideous and malevolent, but completely extraneous.  Harry Dean Stanton is great - as always - and J.E. Freeman's Santos is a case study in controlled evil.  Lynch gives Diane Ladd an unbelievably miserable chore in the role of Marietta Fortune, a woman so two-dimensional she seems to have been drawn on a chalkboard.

Macabre touches, like the dog trotting off with the severed hand, are in abundance. These parlor tricks remind one of a little boy picking his nose at the dinner table, specifically to cause his parents disgust and revulsion.  While these flaws are major, ultimately Wild At Heart's overriding failure is found in the characters of Sailor and Lula, and the way they are realized by Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern.  Sailor and Lula appear to inhabit an alternate universe, their actions are beneath stupidity, beneath innocence, beneath pointlessness.  It is as if they are both afflicted with hyper-ADD and exist in a pure state of mental emptiness where there is no motivation for action beyond hedonism and no thought of consequence at all.  As such, it is impossible to feel any empathy for them - they are completely lacking in anything resembling an actual human emotion or coherent thought.

Cage is endlessly boring as he publicly works through his Elvis obsession, and Dern is wasted as a nymphomaniac with the cerebral capacity of a toaster.  That they consider what they are engaging in to be even in the same universe as love is the greatest of all myths in this movie.  The last minute arrival of an angel, suspended on 60' of piano wire, cannot save Wild At Heart.

533597,4,6303018351,"Yes, ""outrageous"" might be the best adjective to describe this sick-but-fascinating David Lynch film, maybe his sickest, although I've never seen Eraserhead.

The most interesting feature of this strange movie, I think, was the weird characters, one after the other. Make that ultra-weird.....and the strangest of them all is ""Bobby Peru,"" played by Willem Dafoe. In all my years of movie watching, I think ""Bobby Peru"" still has to rank in the top five of the creepiest characters. He is so outrageously disgusting and perverted you just have to laugh out loud at him.

This wild and entertaining film sometimes makes me shake my head in disgust that I own it, and at other times makes me just laugh out loud at the absurdity of it. You really have to have a dark sense of humor to appreciate much of it. I do, to some degree....enough to keep viewing this.

Nicholas Cage is particularly fun to watch and provides most of the laughs. Laura Dern is also convincing as a trailer-trash-type. If you want a clue on why Dern would play such a sleazy role, check out her real-life mom in this film, Diane Ladd, who plays her mother in the movie. It looks like Mom passed on her wholesome values.

As with some other Lynch films, the music is outstanding: just a great soundtrack. I bought the CD to this a year after first seeing the movie, and I've always enjoyed it. And, another Lynch trait that certainly is here is the excellent visual style, which is enhanced by the widescreen DVD.

So, if you are looking for an outrageous two hours and you aren't easily shocked or offended, this would be a film to consider.",1146614400,4,1613,4.606271777003484

WILD AT HEART is full of WIZARD OF OZ allusions and references - some subtle, some not-so-subtle.  However, it is not simply an adult allegorical representation of WIZARD. However, it's still fair game to think of WILD AT HEART as a WIZARD OF OZ with T & A.

Laura Dearn plays a character, Luella, who is let's just say....a bit warped.  She is not evil, but she has a bizarre view of reality.  That she is topless through much of the film is a big +!  Nicholas Cage plays Sailor, a fellow who is a LITTLE closer to the real-world than Luella, but he is prone to making bad decisions.

Willem Dafoe plays one of the most radical characters in Hollywood History.  The character probably belongs closer to the Hollywood Hall of Shame rather than the Hollywood Hall of Fame, but Dafoe certainly makes WILD more entertaining!

Characters alone do not make an interesting story. There are plenty of strange, far-out, OK, I'll admit it - interesting, Fellini-esque characters in this movie and David Lynch does have a skeleton of a story working, but it gets lost as a sub-plot is seemingly tacked on to extend a movie that should really end earlier and all these tossed-in Wizard of Oz references that have nothing to do with anything at all, other than to supposedly add ""depth"" to a meaningless film. There are traces of dark comedy exemplifying situations that can arise in new relationships, secrets discovered, parental disapproval, etc. But even that is watered down with scenes that are so disturbing and violent for no real reason, other than again, to add some kind of ""depth."" What type of depth Lych was trying to portray in this movie remains questionable. It almost makes me think that it is all a farce and Lynch's real purpose is to pull the wool over our eyes, making us think it is a very deep and meaningful film, when it really is far from it. What were the French thinking when they gave this best picture at the Cannes? OK - I'll admit when this movie came out, I did like it - but I think I was more blinded by my -ahem- juvenile hots for the lead actor, Nicholas Cage. Now that I am older and wiser, I can see the movie is really not much about anything, only Lynch trying to manipulate his audience for far too long.

533653,4,6303018351,"Shortly after beginning work on the TV show ""Twin Peaks"", David Lynch made ""Wild at Heart"", an adaptation of Barry Gifford's novel. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern play Sailor and Lula, two lovers who are driving cross-country to escape from Lula's mother, Marietta (played by Diane Ladd, Dern's real-life mother). Marietta goes insane at the thought of any boys going near her daughter, but Sailor Ripley especially, because she suspects that he saw her murder her husband years ago.

Marietta has half the country out looking for Sailor and Lula, including the murderer duo of Reggie (Calvin Lockhart) and Juana (Grace Zabriskie); the bizarre hit-man Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe), and his partner, the beautiful Perdita Durango (Isabella Rossellini); and Marietta's ex-lover, the murderous Santos (J.E. Freeman). The only sane person searching for the lovers is Johnnie Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton), a level-headed man completely dedicated to Marietta.

David Lynch is famous for his weird movies, which are often incomprehensible during the first viewing. ""Wild at Heart"" is considerably less weird than Lynch's other movies, but that doesn't mean it isn't weirder than most movies. It also happens to be funny in many scenes. Of course, it can also be disturbing; there are many scenes of violence.

The cast is great. Cage is very funny with his Elvis-style accent. Dafoe is great. Harry Dean Stanton is very fine and quite likable as Johnnie Farragut. Diane Ladd is wonderful as Lula's mother.

Interestingly, there are numerous references to ""The Wizard of Oz"" in here; what made Lynch think of Oz is anyone's guess. ""Twin Peaks"" fans will notice many cast members from the show, including Zabriskie, Sherilyn Fenn, and Sheryl Lee.

The film features a very good soundtrack, a combination of country, Angelo Badalamenti's easygoing score and the occasional heavy metal.

All in all, I think ""Wild at Heart"" is an underrated movie that, while far from Lynch's best, is very enjoyable. It is well-filmed and -directed, and there is a feeling of strength and energy that makes the film even more appealing.

The first time I saw this movie, I was floored.  Few movies excel in creating such an atmosphere of heat and humid drama on screen so well (DO THE RIGHT THING & STRAY DOG come to mind).  Mr. Lynch brings the raw, kinetic lives of Barry Gifford's characters to the screen in his own particular way & everything about this movie just screams rock and roll and dangerous things.  The design of the film recalls elements of film noir, motorcycle and B-movies from the fifties and even a dusting of the gritty seventies.  As for the cast?  Diane Ladd can wear puke & fly on a broomstick with sparkling brilliance.  Harry Dean Stanton ain't nothin' but a hound dog; Willem Dafoe, rivaled only by Dennis Hopper, draws a wicked flame of evil as Bobby Peru - his scene with Laura Dern is incredible; Nicolas Cage channels alot of the same power that E had & Laura Dern fills her red ruby slippers with a delicious, trailer trash sweetness.  Marcello Santos, Drop Shadow, Reggie, Mr. Reindeer, Uncle Pooch - characters all, shipwrecked on planet Earth.  If you enjoy film noir, trashy romances - then say no more - this is just the one for you.  The DVD transfer looks spectacular, the extras are juicy and the only thing lacking would be a commentary track, I guess.  But the movie is certainly good enough to speak for itself.

OK - in reference to another reviewer (ixta coytl) - David Lynch guilty of plagiarism?  A dog with a hand in its mouth is most certainly, most definitely taken from YOJIMBO.  So what, it doesn't warrant ""borderline plagiarism""?  At the end of GOODFELLAS, the very last image of Joe Pesci shooting at the screen is taken from a silent film called THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY (Edwin S. Porter).  GOODFELLAS is now an imitation of that film?  Artists borrow and steal from each other constantly; the above examples are hardly suggesting plagiarism.  Also, checking your characters into a motel isn't grounds for plagiarism either - even if it is from the great TOUCH OF EVIL.  The ""seedy motel"" has a long tradition in films that fall under the genres of film noir, southern gothic or the classic road movie.  Everyone needs to stop somewhere for the night sooner or later.

It is one of Lynch's greatest achievements, although not quite up to the brilliance of ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Mulholland Drive."" You can tell that David Lynch and everyone involved in making this movie had a great time doing it. ""Wild At Heart"" is a movie about ""finding love in hell,"" and Lynch paints an insane, crazyquilt portrait of America while commenting on the escalating violence in the world. Sometimes it is pure fun to behold, other times it will terrify you or break your heart. Fueled by the success of ""Twin Peaks,"" Lynch felt free enough to make his most whimsical movie idolizing American pop culture, chiefly Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, and ""The Wizard of Oz.""

""Wild At Heart"" tells the story of Sailor and Lula, two very passionate lovers played by Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. They are on the run from Lula's crazed mother Marietta Fortune (Diane Ladd, who got an Oscar nomination!) who wants them torn apart, and are being followed by a shaggy dog private detective named Johnnie Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton). On their journey across America, they meet a very weird cast of characters including the sadistic Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe) and the enigmatic Perdita Durango (Isabella Rossellini).

As Sailor and Lula, Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern literally burn up the screen. Their relationship is so perfectly balanced and their sexual passion so believable that you can't help but fall for them yourself. Cage turns in an intense, insane performance as the Elvis-crooning Sailor Ripley, and Dern amazes as she playes wildly against type as the sexually voracious Lula Pace Fortune. Diane Ladd, also Dern's real-life mother, is great as the unstable Marietta. It's a risky, over the top performance that works. Willem Dafoe is creepy, disgusting, and completely mesmorizing as the unsavory Bobby Peru, his ""say it"" scene with Lula is unforgettable. Harry Dean Stanton shines in one of his best roles, and Isabella Rossellini is a delight as Perdita. Grace Zabriskie, Crispin Glover, W. Morgan Sheppard, Sheryl Lee, and Sherilyn Fenn are all wonderful in smaller roles.

David Lynch appeals to a younger and more scarred generation, scarred by the twisted values of my generation, who are trying to deal with scenes of horror in the personal lives and who may find Lynch therapeutic.

Wild at Heart is more mainstream but with genuine moral seriousness worthy of a French film it opposes Diane Ladd as the mother and her sleazy South Carolina manipulation of thug boyfriends, and a genuine innocence represented by Sailor and Lula.

Any man could watch Sailor and listen what he says to Lula to learn how to act right. For example, when she says something really ditzy, just tell her (with sincerity) that her mind is ""God's own misterah"".

Cage was copying the King who was copying African American men who during the Jim Crow era were luckier in love than white men, in compensation for their lack of good fortune everywhere else. This is Camp: it's also all we have.

As to the people who booed at the finish: the attitude of letting evil triumph even in part in order to be ""cool"" is a mechanism for the reproduction of evil. I've seen whole companies destroyed by exceedingly cool people who have never dealt with their hippie fathers.

His television show, Twin Peaks, had captivated American audiences and he was directing a number of commercials and performance art pieces (Industrial Symphony No. 1). This all culminated with Wild at Heart, an adaptation of Barry Gifford's novel, which went on to win the coveted Palme d'Or at that year's Cannes Film Festival. It established Lynch as America's premiere cinematic surrealist.

""Love, Death, Elvis and Oz: The Making of Wild at Heart"" is a fascinating 30 minute documentary with brand new interviews with Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern, Willem Dafoe and, in the biggest coup, David Lynch (who doesn't normally consent to these kinds of things).

This is an excellent retrospective look at the movie that will appeal to newcomers and devoted fans alike.

""Dell's Lunch Counter"" features more interview soundbites that didn't make it into the above documentary. Some highlights include Lynch on Freddie Jones' memorable ""pigeons spread disease"" scene and Cage on the origins of Sailor's famous snakeskin jacket and how it defined the character.

The film starts with Sailor Ripley (Nic Cage) being attacked by a man who was hired to kill him. To make matters worse the hitman was hired by Sailor's girlfriends mother who wants Sailor out of Lula's life forever. Sailor Kills the hitman in a rather brutal fashion and is sent to prison. Once he is released he reunites with Lula to the protest of her overbearing and spiteful mother. The couple then embark on one of the most wild, funny, and moving road trips ever put on film. This film really has to be seen to be understood or appreciated. That doesn't mean everyone who see's it will like it, but you can't knock it untill you give it a try.

Mr. Lynch movies are very special and are not the typical american movies, because have a lot of different elements than ""normal movies"". Mr. Lynch movies requires to pay attention, think, and analize the content. His type of movie is complex, but not impossible to understand, I think Mr. Lynch movies are complex like a dream. In a dream (Or a nightmare) you have different scenes, or strange things appearing from nothing. Maybe a dream have no sense, but if yoy think more deeply, you will find a entire world in a dream. Situations, places and people from different worlds, united under a new laws, and with it's own dream-logic.

Wild at Heart is a romantic tale of a couple of lovers who run away in a very strange USA, with tons of strange characteres in the high way. The characteres Sailor and Lula are unforgettable, same for music, photography and direction. Maybe you think this is an ""artistic movie"". And yes. It is.

Not sure about that, but I love this film just as much as Blue Velvet, Fire Walk With Me, Mulholland Drive etc, and it surprises me that many have such a low opinion of it.  Most Lynch films seem to explore the connection between romance (or at least lust) and darker impulses such as obsession, murder and dementia.  Here the division is very clear; it's a full blown Romantic Epic, with Cage and Dern as the hopelessly-in-love couple on the run.  The classic romance paradigm is done in a very tongue-in-cheek manner here, and Lynch and the actors have a great deal of fun portraying the characters in a cheesy, over-the-top manner.  This is where some people seem to have a problem with the movie: the exaggerated acting of Cage & Dern.  Personally, I think they do a great job-it is meant to be humorous, and it works as a perfectly good counterpoint to the increasingly sinister obstacles they must overcome.  Here is where the movie really shines: Lynch lets his imagination run wild in his depiction of a bizarre and dangerous underworld of criminal activity.  Willem Dafoe is pitch-perfect as the sleazy hitman, and the scene where he tries to seduce Laura Dern in the hotel room is one of the most disturbing moments of sexual tension ever caught on film.  As with most David Lynch films, there are so many small details, so much humor and intelligence (as opposed to your average Hollywood hit) that it can be enjoyed over and over again.  All in all, this is an extremely imaginative and fun movie, and not to be missed!",1101081600,40,1634,4.662020905923345

At long last, MGM decided to get their lazy arses up and release a special edition of this Palme D'or winner. The special features looks enticing, especially when it includes a featurette on the DVD transfer by Lynch. Sigh, looks like the UK region 2 DVD that I bought earlier this year will be collecting dust on my shelf.

After a bit of surfing here and there, I came across a DVD comparison between the region 2 DVD and this edition and to my utter shock, it's censored! To think that this movie's transfer was actually supervised by Lynch and he allowed his own butchering of his film to appease the MPAA?

Throughout just about all of Lynch's films, there has been a dreamlike feel to them that makes his films darkly hypnotic, and Wild at Heart is no exception.  Nicolas Cage and a post Blue Velvet Laura Dern play Sailor and Lula; two star crossed lovers on the run from some dangerous whackos hired by Lula's mother (Diane Ladd) to rub out Sailor.  Along the way they come across an even more dangerous whacko named Bobby Peru (played to absolute perfection by Willem Dafoe, seeing him in this role makes it hard to believe that this guy played Jesus Christ), and in between we are given a near sensory overload of explicit sex scenes between Cage and Dern to go with some horrifying violence.  The dreamlike quality of the film makes Wild at Heart watchable, but as with just about all of Lynch's other films, this is not for all tastes.  Cage seems to be having a lot of fun in his role and the chemistry between him and Dern is more than believeable, while Dafoe chews up all the screentime he can, and the rest of the cast (most of which are Lynch film regulars) include Harry Dean Stanton, Crispin Glover, Isabella Rossellini, Sheryl Lee, and Jack Nance.  All in all, while I don't find this as great as Blue Velvet or Mulholland Drive, Wild at Heart is still a great film, but as I said before, it is not for all tastes.",1047254400,9,1430,4.418250950570342
533825,4,6303018351,"I really can't believe this. This is the uncontestable proof that in America, the so-called 'professionals' of cinema don't really know very much about what good cinema means. Of course the movie was a public failure when it was released in theaters in the early 90s, but this movie won the best Prize in Cannes International Film Festival in 1990 and this should be enough for a DVD release... it's now over ten years old and there's still nothing coming. This is very surprising when you know that Lynch's last movies, ""The Straight Story"" and ""Mulholland Drive"", soon exist in this format...
Of course the story is not very original: a couple of lovers unceasingly pursuited by a bunch of hired, trained, crazy killers. Even if here, the tone and way of storytelling are totally different; we're in a David Lynch movie, filled with bizarre, sordid characters, swimming in a very special, chilling atmosphere, and the soundtrack is everything but heavy and unsurprising. Of course the whole contains a lot of sex and violence, and many uncomfortable scenes, especially the one showing Bobby Peru (great Willem Dafoe) psychologically raping Lula. Of course, there is a happy ending: Sailor is leaving Lula and their son but the Good Witch (played by Sheryl Lee) appears in front of him and advises him to not stay away from love and to return to her, what Sailor does. This happy ending was not in Barry Gifford's novel, finishing with Sailor walking away from Lula. Story told several times before, romance, sex, violence, added happy ending... these are the criterions for an average Hollywood feature film, and ""Wild at Heart"" contains those criterions, even if the treatment is, of course, different. So what's the reason of so much hate? This is 'the' question. Is this movie 'too much'? Does it go too far? I don't think so.",1033776000,10,1831,4.871794871794871
533826,4,6303018351,"The first of three major romance-shockers from three major filmmakers, ""Wild at Heart"" might have served as the basis of and inspiration for both ""True Romance"" and ""Natural Born Killers.""  Focusing not on the media frenzy or the personal relationship between the two leads, ""Wild"" distinguishes itself both as the strongest film in the set of three, and as director David Lynch's weakest project to date.
The story opens with Sailor Ripley (played by Nicholas Cage and his best Elvis accent) killing a would-be assassin with his bare hands while his girlfriend Lula (Laura Dern) and her mother (Laura Dern's real mother Diane Ladd) look on.  Sixteen months later, Sailor gets out of prison and heads to pick up Lula, against her mother's protests.  It becomes clear that Lula's mother doesn't care for Sailor, and the person he killed may have been hired by her to keep Sailor away from Lula by any means necessary.  Sailor and Lula both recognize the danger of staying in Louisiana, and depart first for New Orleans and then California on a roadtrip that leads to a series of unrelated (maybe) events that reveals both the depth of their feelings for each other and the depravity of the world around them.  They dodge Voodoo assassins, psychopaths in all forms, dying automobile accident victims, and fishmarket signs with rude slang written across them, eventually leading to the inevitable conclusion.
Lynch takes an interesting approach to character development here.  Sailor, Lula, and Lula's mother all begin the film as stereotypes (tough guy, trailer-park girl, and overbearing psycho) and eventually flesh themselves out as full characters, even losing their mockeries of Southern accents along the way.  Each has a disturbing past somehow linked with the others, providing the film with some truly shocking moments, and each character's motivations are explored fully, which makes the film's impact all the greater.
The problem is, for a Lynch movie, ""Wild at Heart"" has very little impact.  Most of the shocking scenes seem overdone and, while they at least lend something to the character development (as they did not in ""Natural Born Killers""), they ultimately detract from the film by sacrificing subtlety for overt offensiveness.  One of the things that made ""Blue Velvet"" so effective was that Lynch found a way to communicate his point, and all of its nuances and complexities, without resorting to the ""see, look at THIS!"" approach to filmmaking.  ""Wild at Heart"" takes the latter approach, which weakens what could have been a great film.  Still, it's Lynch, and has a lavish attention to detail unrivaled in most movies of any time, and has quite a bit going for it otherwise, but ""Wild"" is yet another movie that did not realize its full potential, although it could not have been done nearly as well by any other director.

There was TRUE ROMANCE, then came NATURAL BORN KILLERS(both written by Quentin Tarantino!) But before those came David Lynch's WILD AT HEART, perhaps the most bizarre of any of these films.
It is the tale of Sailor and Lula, two star-crossed lovers who hit the road for sunny California in search of a new life. But all is not well, for Lula's witchlike mother does not take much to Sailor, and sends several hitman after them.
Filled with beautfully shot set pieces and several oddball characters(A pair of Voodoo assassins, Willem Dafoe as a brown toothed thug, and Crispin Glover as the weirdo cousin) this uncharacteristically rambunctious effort by Lynch is a wild ride that will leave you breathless.

533861,5,6303018351,"If you've seen one or more films by director David Lynch, such as BLUE VELVET or LOST HIGHWAY, you'll know what to expect in WILD AT HEART. Lynch has certain trademarks, mostly visual images, that occur in his films; Images of fire (like the house burning in LOST HIGHWAY or the numerous close-ups of cigarettes, also in LOST HIGWAY), close-ups of insects (BLUE VELVET), or shots of factory chimneys or other tower-like constructions (the sawmill in the title sequence of TWIN PEAKS and the silo in THE STRAIGHT STORY), and the continual use of provocative sexual images (like Frank Both and his oxygene mask in BLUE VELVET), plus, lastly, the numerous shots of roads and cars (LOST HIGHWAY). A film by David Lynch is not as much about the narrative, as it is about the visuals. You have to appreciate the visuals if you're going to appreciate a Lynchian experience. Take the ""red room"" in TWIN PEAKS; It hardly makes any sense, but it's so fascinating that you can't help being enthralled by it. I guess most directors have a story to begin with, and then they search for the visual means to illustrate it with, whilst David Lynch has the visuals but is always in search of a story to go with them.
WILD AT HEART won David Lynch the ""best picture"" award in Cannes (in 1990, if I'm not mistaking). It's not my favourite film of his, but a lot of Lynch fans will claim that it's certainly theirs; Critically, WILD AT HEART is often mentioned as a peak in David Lynch's career. The story is about two starstruck lovers, Sailor Ripley (Nicholas Cage as an Elvis incarnation) and Lula Fortune (Laura Dern as Dorothy Gale), and their flight from the Wicked Witch Of The West, or in this case Lula's mother, Marietta Pace Fortune (Diane Ladd; Real-life mother of Laura Dern). Lula's mother doesn't really share her daughter's affection for Sailor Ripley, and she has enlisted the aid of a private detective to track the pair down, and a hitman to kill Sailor Ripley. What follows is a Lynchian journey a long the yellow brick road, or just your average Amerian highway, in search of a wizard of Oz, that's not really there; Basically, we see Sailor and Luna jump from one deranged world into an even more psychotic one. I believe that two quotes from the film sums up what all this is about; ""The whole world is wild at heart and weird on top,"" and ""Too bad there's no wizard of Oz we can all go to for good advice"".
The film is, as I've attempted to hint at, full of references to THE WIZARD OF OZ, and it's not a bad idea having seen that film before watching WILD AT HEART. You can thoroughly enjoy the latter without having seen the former, don't get me wrong, but a lot of things in the film will seem strange and ridicilous; For instance, there's a scene at the end which involves the Good Witch Of The North, and you can't really understand how wonderful that scene is if you have no knowledge of THE WIZARD OF OZ. But in any case, WILD AT HEART is a hearty recommandation, just don't expect your average Hollywood movie; This is a David Lynch film, and his films are strange and weird and deranged, and they don't always make sense, but I've never seen a film of his that hasn't fascinated me (even DUNE had its moments).",1010793600,13,3223,4.492333901192504

533866,5,6303018351,"""Wild at Heart"" opened to fantastic reviews at the Cannes Film Festival in 1990, where it won the Golden Palm Award for Best Picture of the year.  Written for the screen and directed by the master of quirk David Lynch, this film tells the wild adventures of a young convict (Cage) who breaks his parole to journey across America with his beautiful gal (Dern) to escape her evil mother (Ladd.)  Whilst regaling us with tales of their recent serendipity, Lynch directs Ladd as she muddles in her morass of bad joss.  Along the way, Cage and Dern cross paths with an assortment of classic Lynchian characters: strange but goofy and friendly at best; strange but evil and murderous at worst.  Most of the heartless half-wits are sent by the evil mother (played insanely brilliant by Ladd) in an effort to sabotage the relationship between Cage and Dern.  The chase across America is played wonderfully by Lynch, in an apparant homage to Homer's ""The Odyssey.""  Cage, as a mondern day Odysseus, has just weathered years of rough adventure in jail and now must make his way to the 'promised land' in the hopes that Dern-his Penelope-will faithfully be there still at journey's end.  There is even a one-eyed cyclops along the way, and a siren or two.  Also, no road trip would be complete without quite a bit of ""Wizard of Oz"" imagery, of which there is plenty of, and quite obviously referred to therein.  All in all, it has exciting action, steaming sex scenes between Cage and Dern (and even an erotic scene between Dern and DeFoe.)  Moreover, the comic wit of the dialogue will have you rewinding the movie to hear your favorite classic lines again: ""We're making this porno Texas-style!""  I look forward to the day it will be released on DVD, as it did in fact win Best Picture in Cannes, Cage is an Academy Award winning actor himself, and DeFoe is a two-time Academy Award nominee!  Buy this film, sit back, and prepare for a whacky adventure, terrifying in parts, strange in others, comical in all parts, but yet surrealy beautiful in still others.  It is one of a kind moviemaking of which Lynch is the master.  I guarantee you that you have seen nothing like it before.  After finishing this film, be sure to rush out and get ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me.""  Great films.  ""When this kind of fire starts, it is very hard to put out.  The tender boughs of innocense burn first, and the wind rises, and then all goodness is in jeopardy.""  from TP:Fire Walk With Me.

533867,5,6303018351,"A viewer below suggests that ""Anyone who gave Wild At Heart a bad review, but liked Dune should be ignored on general principles."" Well, let me tell YOU something, pal: Not only is ""Wild At Heart"" some sort of a brilliant film, but I also think ""Dune"" is one of the most underrated films ever, and I think David Lynch is selling himself short to suggest otherwise. As a fan of Frank Herbert's sci-fi epic, I think Lynch did an admirable job of capturing Herbert's universe given a time frame of only 2 and  hours.
But enough about ""Dune."" I'm ecstatic that ""Wild At Heart"" is about to get its long-awaited DVD release, in part because the film in ANY format has been inexplicably long out of print, and in part because one scene in particular, which had to be ""smoked over"" to avoid the deadly NC-17, apparently has been cleaned up for this edition. When the film was first released in theaters, the climactic scene in which to top of a man's skull is blown off by a shotgun had to have some ""smoke"" added to obscure the graphic scene so that the film could get an R rating. However, anyone who caught the recent broadcast of ""Wild At Heart"" on the Independent Film Channel knows that the ""smoke"" has now been removed, and I assume the DVD release will reflect that.
""Wild At Heart"" reputedly was David Lynch's first intentional foray into ""humor,"" but that's not saying much here. There are some lines, visuals, and other assorted tableaux that are ""funny"" but only in the most absurd, Lynchian way. There are plenty of references to ""The Wizard of Oz.""

Dune was a great book, Lynch is a great director, but the screenplay for Dune was an abject mess (The sets, costumes and casting were excellent though.) The point of all that is this: anyone who gave Wild At Heart a bad review, but liked Dune should be ignored on general principles...  If you liked Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive or Eraserhead; you will most likely enjoy Wild At Heart.  It's the closest to a comedy that he has made, although the blackest kind of comedy.

From Laura Dern moaning, ""Oh Sailor you make me hotter'n Georgia asphalt,"" to Nicholas Cage beating the brains out of a guy, to Willem Dafoe blowing his own brains out, this movie constantly takes you in grandly twisted directions.
It's a good thing I saw this on VHS, rather than in the theater.  Following Crispin Glover's vignette as Jingle Dell -- he thought, among other things, that he was being pursued by aliens wearing black gloves -- I convulsed so hard with laughter that I missed the next five minutes of the story and had to rewind.
If you are a proud member of the Sick Sense of Humor Society, Wild At Heart is one of your keynote films.  Enjoy !",1003795200,4,1050,4.664864864864865
533939,2,6303018351,"If you're looking for another Blue Velvet, Eraserhead, Elephant Man or Dune, this film is not for you.
I think this is a poor representation of Lynch's craft.  I've always liked his penchant for the quirky and bizarre, particularly when interwoven with an intriguing plot (Blue Velvet).  This movie, like the later episodes of Twin Peaks, is an exercise in weirdness just for weirdness sake.
While Nicholas Cage delivers a good performance, the film is otherwise vapid and rather tedious to endure (I had to keep taking breaks from the video).  Laura Dern, while easy on the eyes, began to grate against my nerves as the movie wore on, particularly after the millionth time she screamed ""SAILOR!!!"" with that stupid Greek tragedy mask expression plastered on her face.
I was also disappointed to see Crispin Glover, always a favorite weirdo of mine, had a small part.  Same with Sherilyn Fenn (always favorite eye candy).
I sought this out after it was OOP.  While it didn't break the bank, I do not regard it as money well spent.  Seek out other Lynch's for your video collection.",993427200,13,1081,4.816216216216216
533940,4,6303018351,"This movie is wickedly beautiful and violently satiric, a pulp-fiction extravaganza of murder in 'B' movies. The film's  junkyard-of-the-soul theme wraps like a chain around the sympathetic characters and stories. El Tuna, Texas indeed.",992995200,2,236,5.9411764705882355
533941,2,6303018351,"David Lynch is a talented man. He has a cult following. If you think David Lynch is the greatest thing since night baseball, read the other reviews, this flick is for you.

David Lynch first came to my attention with Elephant Man and I was impressed. I found Blue Velvet disturbing, but intriguing (with some serious flaws that become monumental in his later work). Twin Peaks was fascinating & funny for weeks before it became so obscure and self-referential that it ran out of steam and interest. I even liked lots of Dune. So, I anticipated Wild at Heart.

It began well enough, but then it just went off the page into excess.  Half way through the picture I couldn't stand the vapid and inane couple played by Cage and Dern (two actors I admire greatly). Both of them went over-the-top, if such as thing is possible in a Lynch movie, and became boring and ridiculous. Since the entire rest of the film is peopled with nothing but depraved grotesques and caricatures, t! here isn't a human being anywhere in sight to give a tinker's damn about. So I very quickly didn't give a damn what happened to anyone in this garish nightmare.

I guess you could view this as a ""comedy"" of sorts.  Artsy fartsy bad movies MUST be clever comedies, no? Well, it ain't very funny either.  It is too pointless and idiotic to even qualify as ""black comedy"".

Lynch has a way with the camera and an image. He is a terrible writer, and he gets ludicrous performances from very good actors. I won't even go into the stupid Wizard of Oz references. His in-jokes and his vision is so introverted and personalized as to have little or no meaning or relevance to anyone else but himself. This kind of self-referencing, self-obsessed, mastubatory obscurity becomes indicipherable and tedious.

Some people find art in excrement. Knock yourselves out. I don't think putting arresting or disturbing visuals on screen is enough. Surrealism just to be surreal seems to me! an exercise in narcissism. It would have been nice to find something approximating human life somewhere in here, but I didn't find it in this nonsense.  Nor any point other than bad acting and irrelevent images preserved forever on film.",988588800,10,2184,4.726315789473684

If you are offended by it's treatment of women or racial distortions, you miss it's point entirely. Life is not fair. It's both sweet and primal, brutal and dazzaling, crude and enlightening, depending on the road you take, in various mixtures of each. Much like this film. I forever looked at the world differently; thru Lynch's eyes, a brief glimps of his soul and the metaphores his charactors represent. I could identify with each, and in some ways see myself in all of them... but if anything, I think it encouraged me to hang a little bit looser and attempt to enjoy more thouroghly because that's what life should be. If you haven't loved someone obsessively, you haven't really lived. If you haven't let loose and really partied, you missed something. If you've denied your dark shadow self your entire life, you don't really know who you are.

533945,3,6303018351,"A romantic comedy for people who would never admit they like romantic comedy: a romance for the grunge set replete with lots of flowing blood, guns going off, cigarettes apuffing, and slimy bit characters met on the  lam.  David Lynch directs with snap and shock and a devious sense of humor,  but I think he ought to have the courage to make a romantic comedy straight  out.  He splashes guts and rubs our face in vomit to disguise the simple  love story so his leather and chains audience can imagine they're seeing  life in the raw instead of being seduced as their parents so often were by  yet another Hollywood romance.
Nicholas Cage plays Barry Gifford's Sailor  like a dumbed-down Elvis Presley (and that was before he grabbed the  microphone), and Laura Dern as Lula captures well the mentality of a sweet,  shallow, but meat-eating little thing who just wants to have fun.  When I  first saw her in Smooth Talk (1985) (from a story by Joyce Carol Oates) I  thought she was just flat out sexy, but here she seems a little dull even  if she does have ""breasts that stand up and say hello.""  Diane Ladd, as  Lula's mother, employing some Phyllis Diller shtick, is funny as the wicked  witch of the west on testosterone.
What saves this movie from the  ridiculous is the fact that the poor saps, Sailor and Lula, really love  each other.  He makes her ""hotter than Georgia asphalt,"" and he finds her  ""dangerously cute.""  They have a whole bunch of mindless love-but maybe  that's the best kind.",960422400,3,1501,4.598484848484849

Okay, Willem Defoe has got to be one of the top ten actors around.  He played Bobby Peru (love him, hate him) perfectly.

Too mainstream? hardly. This is definately a weird period in  lynchs career, he was trying formal narratives, and using storys, unlike  ""Eraserhead"", a great film, but essentially it goes nowhere. He  made that, completely surreal, then tried this, which has a moving story,  then decided it would be best to stick with surreal and did Lost Highway.  I'm saying I like all these films, just this one doesn't get the respect it  deserves. It's not as weird as all his other films, but weird nonetheless.  Great performances all around, and in the end when cage is beat up by the  gang for calling them homosexuals, his apology is one of the greatest lines  he's ever delivered.",933206400,,840,4.509933774834437

534012,5,6303018351,"""Wild at Heart"" is probably the last of David Lynch's truly great films. With a career that has since plummeted with ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me"" and ""Lost Highway,"" Lynch's ""Wild at  Heart"" is a great ride on the dirty road of the human soul. For Lynch  fans like myself, it's those bizarre, quirky characters who perform odd and  unusual acts which have causde repeated viewings over the years. A few  examples include a contractor-mafia type who does business over the phone  while on the toilet with two nude girls at his side and Crispen Glover's  brief appearance as a man obsessed with Christmas and Martians who vanishes  after developing strange habitats for cockroaches. ""Wild at  Heart"" has superb casting with Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern, Harry Dean  Stanton, Isabella Rosselini and Oscar-nominated Diane Ladd. The most  convincing performance, however, is Willem DeFoe as the haunting Bobby  Peru. His presence is upsetting, grotesque and at the same time hilarious.  Lynch proves, as he did with ""Blue Velvet,"" that his stories are  character driven. ""Wild at Heart"" is a wild ride, but not  intended for the lighthearted. It's got everything to merit a hard-R rating  which makes it such an unforgettable David Lynch film.",924998400,5,1238,5.029556650246305

It's better and more entertaining than Inland Empire, but I can see how some people hated this movie. It's fragmented, sloppy, slow in some parts, annoying, pointless, redundant, and one of those movies you can watch very once in a while. And if you are a true Lynch fan, you will notice and appreciate his signature filmmaking, quirky characters and direction, stagnant pace, outstanding musical score (thanks to Angelo B), core cast members (the awesome Sheryl Lee from Twin Peaks makes an appearance), and breakout performances -- which one is highly delivered by Willem Dafoe. I certainly love most of Lynch's work, such as; Twin Peaks, Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, A Straight Story, and many of his short films and other work. But Wild At Heart is simply...OKAY, but nothing amazing or deserving of a 5-star movie.
