8081327,4,B000B37XJ2,"I'll be frank: Desire and Hell at Sunset Motel (no definite article precedes the motel's name) is not for everyone. Many will find it confusing, though the peculiar stew of supporting characters should prevent boredom, at least. The film seems as if it were written by taking random headlines out of an issue of Time Magazine from the mid-to-late '50, and constructing a plot that would connect them. Thus, we get beat poetry, cold war fears, Norman Vincent Peale salesmanship, hula hoops, telephones in every room (what an innovation!), subliminal self-help audiotapes (reel-to-reel, presumably), the opening of Disneyland, one-piece bathing suits for women, Ray-Bans, McCarthyist blacklisting, you name it. (We also get cheating wives, murderous husbands, blackmail, and a spice of sexual perversion.) The one major story not mentioned directly is the one pivotal to the plot: the case of Bridey Murphy.

Except that Sherilyn Fenn's character is named ""Bridey.""

I'll say no more about the plot. Reasons to watch: a) you have a pop-culture boner for the 1950s; b) you're a big big fan of Paul Bartel; c) Sherilyn Fenn in a one-piece swimsuit doing the backstroke in slo-mo; d) you're a big big fan of David (New York Dolls, ""Buster Poindexter"") Johanssen; e) how film scripts are constructed interests you.

The DVD seems to be the best available. It is somewhat dark, no worse than a good VHS tape. It is widescreen. There are no special features worth mentioning.",1294617600,2,1467,5.078838174273859
8081328,5,B000B37XJ2,"Okay, I admit that this film is not the easiest to follow, especially with the multiple story lines that emanate from Sherilyn Fenn's character suffering drug induced amnesia.

But admit it.

How can you NOT love a movie that, in addition to featuring the irresistible Sherilyn Fenn, also has the following lines:

1)  ""Did you by any chance kill my husband?""

2)  Q.  Will you shut up, and listen?
  A.  Will you go to hell?

3)  Q.  May I have this dance?
  A.  I've got coodies...

Maybe this movie is difficult, perhaps impossible, to completely understand.  But the visual beauty and puzzling lines absolutely make it a must see.",1286668800,4,634,4.660550458715596
8081329,5,B000B37XJ2,"I have been trying to find that jazzy tune since I first saw this movie in the 90's!! Red lips raven hair pretty much said it all. This is one of my all time favorite movies. I discovered it accidently one day on HBO and taped it on a whim. The mood and feeling invoked by Sherliyn Fenn's character and the sultry music moving in and out of the action are what set this movie apart from others. Halfway through you'll realize you have no idea what's going on. It's intriguing, fun, sexy, and quirky. It should be a cult classic.",1121731200,5,528,4.237623762376238
