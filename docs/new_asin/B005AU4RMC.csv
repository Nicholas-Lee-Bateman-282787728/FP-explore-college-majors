8463668,1,B005AU4RMC,"I don't even know where to start with this movie it takes bad to an entirely different level. Right off the top you can tell this is a movie written by a woman. High drama, emotional characters, with no dots to connect them in between. All you're left is with more questions than answers. The lead female was pleasing to the eye so I kept watching only to find out I wish I hadn't. Isabelle is your average narcissistic female but she comes with the problem of being completely off her freaking mind. In the beginning we see a timid, shy, character that we feel sorry for but in the end you realize she's just another self centered phsyco b-tch with family issues.

Isabelle's mother was a loose woman (more than likely a prostitute) who Isabelle witnessed having sex with random men. One day after running away from her home and coming back home she finds her mother dead (of unknown reasons she looks to have OD'd or been murdered). The neighbor girl witnesses Isabelle's struggle and her family takes poor Isabelle in. FWD to the future Isabelle's foster sister has become the guardian Isabelle needs to protect her from her own destructive self. Always being there for her and babying her and ignoring that Isabelle is mentally unstable and needs help. She holds herself together enough to run her book store and be around her co-workers but she unravels as she begins a relationship with a man that brings up all her weaknesses of having to trust and love someone both mentally and intimately. These are things that Isabelle had trauma from with what she witnessed and experienced with her mother and when reminded about the incidents she freaks out and becomes violent when she starts feeling the same emotions that remind her of who her mother was. Every time Isabelle starts feeling emotions she can't handle them and she becomes self destructive.

She cuts herself, chooses the wrong men that are abusive to her, and does this because she's afraid to actually feel loved or cope with her own decisions. The problem with the movie is that it's not written very well and Isabelle's character contradicts her own behavioral problems. Sadly there are too many Isabelle's out there (women that enjoy being in abusive relationships because they don't like themselves) which gives some realism to the movie. Like those women that stay with men that cheat on them and don't respect them at all yet they fall apart if they can't be with them. The Writer derailed their own story by turning away Isabelle's self destructive behavior to making her a murderer.

 It probably was an attempt to make the story shocking or horror like but really it just made you care less. All we see is that Isabelle drags her foster sister into her problems and doesn't really care about her at all making her a super crazy narcissistic b-tch. Anyhow my review is probably more entertaining than this movie which is like watching icicles melt in 35 degree weather. The movie is extremely dull, boring, and slow.",1394928000,5,2991,4.735124760076776

8463670,5,B005AU4RMC,"Wow this story is super interesting. I never saw the ending coming. The script I feel was amazing, but the execution was a bit underdeveloped. The story is intelligently creepy, it definitely lives up to the psychological thriller genre.

Tinsel's acting was good. She was believable all the way through. I don't think anyone that has watched this film saw the ending coming. I leaves you with wanting more. I hope this film goes far.",1341792000,2,434,4.786666666666667
