8173222,5,B000MWG960,"I just repurchased this shape up program. I first bought it in 1990! I had the tapes until 2007-2008 at which time I sold them as I was tired of the routines. Flash forward to 2015. I am again working out -- and my mind kept thinking of these tapes especially the ""Stretch and Strengthen"" one. In the past few years I have wanted to start stretching again as I get older. I tried different dvds and books but none compared with the workout I got with stretch and strengthen. So I decided to buy it again! Pretty amazing seeing as this came out in 1989!! It was put together by pros who obviously knew what they were doing. All the tapes are excellent and I look forward to getting my ""new"" set. I'm surprised they never reissued this set on DVDS as reading the reviews here I can only guess there are many people (mostly women) who miss having them. I'm just glad I could find them again at a great price on amazon. I was 37 when I first bought them and now I am 61. So I guess this speaks to how good they really were.",1431907200,2,1019,4.125628140703518
