8561604,1,B00B2RC6VQ,This is not the one I wanted I wanted the one that is Ukrainians that came to Canada and were placed in concentration camps because they came from Ukraine that was under Austrian rule.,1407974400,,184,4.4411764705882355
8561605,5,B00B2RC6VQ,"Emotionally evocative and morally profound, Enemy Alien depicts the at times, depressing, but always courageous plight of Farouk Abdel-Muhti on his quest for freedom. Director Konrad Aderer eloquently weaves together Farouk's history, the efforts of his son, and the post-9/11 US immigration policy narrative to provide context for Farouk's story.  Aderer takes a highly ambitious and complex topic and condenses it into 80 minutes of a truly high-level documentary. Enemy Alien is a must-watch film for anyone interested in the post-9/11 challenges of Arab-Americans, the overreaching nature of the increasingly large US federal government, and a basic humanitarian cause...or if you just want to watch an excellent documentary.",1371254400,,729,5.75
8561606,5,B00B2RC6VQ,"Must see documentary for anyone interested in US history, immigration, and homeland security policies.  Very informative and engaging film which shows the parallels between the Japanese interned during WWII and the Arabs, Muslims, and Southeast Asians detained after 9/11.  Riveting account of plight of Palestinian activist Farouk Abdel-Muhti.",1371254400,,344,6.145833333333333
8561607,5,B00B2RC6VQ,"I saw this film a year ago and it was such a disappointing look of what our U.S. government can do to people it just suspects or who just speak against U.S. policy. I have actually seen FBI agents take these type of actions against dedicated U.S. employees, treating them as guilty conspirators but after 5 long years drop the case after huge expense of the employees (for lawyers) and its personal affects on the employee and their families. They can run people into the ground, and also indirectly kill them with impunity. This is an awesome documentary and should be on your ""must see"" list to understand how certain segments of the U.S. government operates.",1370736000,,661,4.706896551724138
