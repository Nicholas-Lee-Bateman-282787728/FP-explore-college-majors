4690493,5,B005GHBL9G,"I love looking at the characters through the actor's eyes.  The respect and depth of their roles makes this so much than a zombie series.

4690498,5,B005GHBL9G,Fun interview show. It's a couple years old but still fun to watch.  This is from their first season. Several of the cast are gone,1387670400,2,130,4.2
4690499,4,B005GHBL9G,"great to see these actors out of character....too bad many of them have been executed from the show.... the director and writer are  very gratuitous with their foul language , be prepared for your ears!  I think that the actors studio series may do a better job....no one has explained about the English/Australian actors involved in this series....",1382400000,,349,5.0

8471579,5,B005GHBL9G,"This was better than the first, the actors had more time to answer questions from the audience and online.",1455667200,,106,4.631578947368421
8471580,2,B005GHBL9G,"Oh look.. it's the Frank Darabonte show.
Look I've defended the guy from a creative perspective but now that I've seen this display of attention grabbing hubris, I have a better picture of what it must have been like for cast and crew behind the scenes. Frank is all about Frank, and the rest of the cast really had no reason to even show up to this event. Irritating.",1450828800,,368,4.3478260869565215
