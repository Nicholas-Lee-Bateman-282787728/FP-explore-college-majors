935619,5,630450392X,"Woody Allen shows life in Manhattan in the nineties through thebrilliant device of the old-school Hollywood musical. Thus thecharacters have modern problems like Reagan-era conservatism, shrinks and attraction to the dark side. What results is incredibly fresh and inspired. The songs and choreography are great, as is much of the singing, especially by Edward Norton and Goldie Hawn. You also get a sense of what many of these stars of today, such as Drew Barrymore, would have been like if they had been born 50 years earlier.",934934400,,528,5.080459770114943
935620,5,630450392X,"A really fine film, touching and with good performances by the actors; but at least they do their own singing, except for Drew Barrymore who apparently was not up to the task.
I think this was Edward Norton's first  film.
I recommend it highly.

935621,4,630450392X,"Why is it that I'm able to remember the songs to this movie long after I've seen it?  How does the sight of Goldia Hawn gliding in the air remain in my mind?  Does the fact that I still sing ""I'm through with  love"" all the time say anything, even if I sing it when I'm completely  in love?  Does the glamour of the movie die when it's over?  I should hope  not, and it doesn't.  Everyone Says I Love You is simply joyous.  It's  uplifting, beautiful, with great cinematography of New York, Paris and  Venice, remarkable in song (how long do you remember top twenty hits  compared to songs you'll hear here), fluid in laughs, and lets love and  life work its own magic, rather than trying to explain it.

935622,5,630450392X,"Fans of old-style musicals, where characters break into song mid-sentence,  should not be put off by fear of having to put up with too much of the  trademark ""Woody whining"".  This movie is in fact a joyous  celebration of loves old and new and the spirit lifting power of song and  music.  Set to the usual array of glorious standards, all the movies'  stars, save Drew Barrymore, croon classic romantic ballads and the result  is wildly, if not surprisingly, successful.  Accomplished vets Goldie Hawn  and Alan Alda are polished; celebrated newcomers Edward Norton and Billy  Crudup can add another talent to their growing resumes; and even the  weakest voices (Tim Roth, Julia Roberts, and Woody himself) acquit  themselves charmingly.  Though a decided departure for Allen, EVERYONE SAYS  I LOVE YOU is a must for his fans and for hopeless romantics as well.  Of  course, that means you.  END",904003200,2,897,4.945945945945946

Do yourself a favor and take a look.  La La Land is a good, if not great, film but it's sad (to quote our current resident of the White House) that so few seem to know it is hardly new or unprecedented.

Tim Roth as comic unreformed thug singing a love song reverses the actor's usual persona hilariously--the essence of the film in miniature. Julia Roberts reverses the movement from psychoanalysis to mythology; Allen Alda becomes a benign pater familias, Goldie Hawn goes from comedy to lyricism, and Frank E.

New viewers may not know that the actors actually sang.  All except Drew Barrymore.  Apparently she is not a singer by any stretch of the imagination.

They can't sing!"" Actually, Alan Alda and Goldie Hawn and whoever dubbed Drew Barrymore's part can sing quiet well; but for the most part, most people that are in this can't sing worth beans, especially Woody Allen.

And this is the charm of the movie! And you know what? It works! It's satisfying. And here's one gigantic benefit for myself: I don't have to feel so bad about the way my own voice sounds when I'm singing! (I always thought it was very ironic that music is my favorite art form, but that I can't sing or dance [two left feet, to be sure].)

Overall, this is one of my top four favorite musicals of all-time (the others include A Hard Days Night, Singing in the Rain, and West Side Story).

935883,3,630450392X,"Based on the raves that this movie received, I gave it a try.  There are a few funny moments but overall, it is as though someone had described what a musical was to Mr. Allen and so he tried to create one secondhand.  The actors, for the most part, are actors and cannot sing or dance at the level necessary to reach the level of a true musical.
  The Hollywood musicals - especially the great ones - had an incredible energy and a sense of panache that is missing from this one.  Looking back at this film, I cannot recall a single close-up on any of the actors.  Mr. Allen, as is his forte, has some wonderfully humorous lines.  I enjoyed the dance sequence at the hospital and the Captain Spauldings.  But there was always a point to the dances in musicals - a way to further the plot or emotional content.
  I applaud the attempt, but this is one movie I won't be watching again for a very long while.",1381536000,,906,4.245614035087719
935884,5,630450392X,Very happy and cheerful movie for Woody Allen.  Star-studded cast ... this is a surprise piece of work who is usually associated with some type of dysfunctional character.  Refreshing for a change.,1379548800,,197,5.125
935885,4,630450392X,"there is a period in woody allen's films where he insists on playing the romantic lead even though it is preposterous.  maybe if he picked an ordinary young person he might convince me but not Julia Roberts in her prime.  many films which were otherwise splendid in this time period suffered from his determination to hang on well past the time when Cary Grant knew he was too old for that role.  and as a romantic leading man, woody allen is no cary grant. however, julia roberts coming to terms with her romantic fantasies is quite good, as in be careful what you wish for in this department. so his writing of this is very good if only another actor had performed it. by contrast, his romancing goldie hawn worked wonderfully, especially their dance along the seine. but goldie hawn is closer to his age. they were a very good pairing.

my only other complaint is that this musical had some of my favorite numbers from the early half of the twentieth century.  thus, i would have liked the people who sang them to at least have average singing voices. edward norton was fine, as was goldie hawn and alan alda.  but woody allen, drew barrymore and julia roberts have ""F"" singing voices.  it was painful to hear them mangle these gorgeous tunes.

these complaints aside, this was a very imaginative musical romantic comedy about people falling in and out of love in new york, paris and venice.  they do so to these show tunes at very creative junctures with my favorite being the musical number at the funeral.  if the entire film had been like the funeral, this would have been five stars.

my favorite bit was tim roth as the prisoner who goldie hawn brings to her home as part of his rehab.  roth is terrific, as usual. and, of course, he starts romancing the family's daughter, drew barrymore, which carries ""bleeding heart liberal"" to the nth degree as to the parents' devotion to the left wing causes.

935890,5,630450392X,"Written and directed by Woody Allen, this incursion into musicals by the great maestro of comedy will go down in history as one of the greatest musicals to have graced the screen since Singing in the Rain and a Woody Allen classic that is infused with witty humour and intricately choreographed dance numbers and songs seamlessly integrated into what seems like a flawless story. Highly recommended.

The main plot revolves around Alan Alda's daughter who is engaged to be married and, anticipating the event, finds her fiance buying a ring which she unwittingly swallows due to the fact that he thought it would be a romantic surprise to put it on top of an ice cream sundae, and having gone through the fiasco, finds himself disappointed when his fiance, played by Drew Barrymore, falls for an ex-convict who was invited to her house by her ultra-liberal mother whose agenda was to improve the living accommodations for convicts in prison.

The ex-convict goes all out to woo Drew and finally succeeds, involving her in a get-away following a heist; and, having found herself unable to fit in to such a morally reprehensible life, Drew finally returns to her former fiance - much to the relief of her parents.

935927,5,630450392X,"As for the movie itself it's becoming one of my favorite Woody movies (which is saying something, I'm a huge fan). The cast is great, and the movie is charming, warm and has several laugh out loud moments. But it's hard to get in the US. We already own the DVD but wanted to upgrade to Blu-Ray, but it was not available in the US. So we took a chance with this Swedish release. The Blu-Ray quality was worth the upgrade. The picture is incredible and even though this is a light musical comedy it really does add to the viewing experience.

935995,5,630450392X,"It has been some time since I have paid attention to Woody Allen, so running into his 1996 musical comedy Everyone Says I Love You on cable left me wondering what else I may have been missing from the increasingly marginalized director. ""I Love You"" fits neatly within Allen's well established adult comedy arcs and, surprisingly enough, the classic architecture of the great MGM musicals of the last century. I have to acknowledge up-front that this film contains so many elements that I personally dislike (e.g. recent-vintage Woody Allen, Goldie Hawn, Drew Barrymore just to scratch the surface) that to consider it a great film by any measure still shocks me - and yet, it is.

In the case of Allen, maybe the definition of true genius is the ability to accumulate plaudits and accolades by the insistent greatness of his work despite the deep misgivings of his audience that his personal conduct should land him in the miscreant hall of fame rather than on any awards podium.

The construction of ESILY is vintage Allen - an omniscient look at the deep dysfunction of stereotypical Upper East Side Manhattanites whose gilded socioeconomic stature does little to immunize them against a litany of self-destructive tendencies and limousine liberal hypocrisies that are his signature.

At the heart of the film is a screwball comedy that takes full advantage of a brilliant screenplay. Although Alan Alda and Goldie Hawn show little chemistry as the husband/wife tandem that are planning a merger/marriage of their daughter to one of New York's most prominent families, the film achieves lift-off only when Hawn champions the cause of a recently released felon whom she believes has been falsely incarcerated - allowing the bleeding heart hi-jinx to really build momentum (and sing.) And of course it wouldn't be a Woody Allen film if his well-trodden neurotic New Yawker schlep-meister persona didn't make an appearance in the guise of Hawn's ex-husband, who to the envy of men everywhere becomes involved in a star-crossed (and ridiculously improbable) romance with Julia Roberts - to the writer/director go the spoils I suppose.

The brilliance of the film is that instead of simply running through the screenplay by rote, Allen has the characters spontaneously and inexplicably break into skillfully choreographed ""big musical"" numbers that would have Gene Kelly nodding in appreciation... who knew that Edward Norton could sing or dance. The smile here is not that the numbers are so good (they are) but that they occur in hilariously discordant settings (the hospital sequence is well worth your time all by itself.) popping up frequently enough to blend away the story-line lulls - they are funny as hell and almost provoke a sympathetic end-note for Allen and his sadly neglected gem of a film. As an aside, ESILY does not shortchange on the gorgeous exteriors (New York and Paris) for which Allen is synonymous.

The plot of the movie is standard Woody Allen; Relationships and their discontents.  Whether drama or comedy, Woody does these very well and this movie is no exception.  There is a particular farcical relationship that involves an ex-con that is hilarious.  However, what makes this Woody Allen movie stand on its' own is the song and dance routines.  The cast is not, to my knowledge, known for their musical talent but they all do a good to very good job.  Check that; Woody's singing in the lone (thankfully) song he sang was dreadful.  Apparently he knew this as well because he politely sang in a whisper.  Three numbers in particular stood out for me.  The best was a hospital scene that broke into a chorus of ""Makin Whoopee"".  The dancing of the patients (in various states of immobility and/or injury) was a great spoof of song and dance routines.  The funeral home was the scene of ""It's later than you Think"" preformed, if you will, as a spiritual.  The final number worth citing was the Groucho ensemble dancing to ""Hooray for Captain Spaulding"".  Someone put a LOT of time into the choreography for these numbers.

Woody has amazed me before on several occassions so I'm stingy with my ""5 Star"" ratings when it comes to his movies.  ""Everyone Says I Love You"" doesn't quite reach that level but it's only a notch below.",1175904000,2,1582,4.514084507042254
936025,4,630450392X,"Watching ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" it is possible to conclude that Woody Allen has gone insane--charmingly and endearingly, but completely, bonkers.  A typical Allen-esque New York comedy of love and romance is given a special charge by turning the film into a musical; though Allen has often used classic jazz and show tunes effectively in his other works (especially the Gershwin score of ""Manhattan"" and the lovely big band tunes in ""Hannah and Her Sisters""), this is his first full-out musical with actors bursting into song to (more or less) further the plot.  Some, like an endearingly game Edward Norton, shine almost in spite of themselves; some, like Julia Roberts, try valiantly but still go down fighting.  (Score at the final: Roberts 6, song 2, audience 0.)  And some, like Goldie Hawn, positively glow given the chance to show off all of her formidable comedic, singing, and dancing gifts in one package again.  Bits of the plot are cribbed from other Allen films (the romances are from ""Manhattan,"" a thread involving a ""reformed"" criminal echoes ""Take the Money and Run""), but the actors--especially Tim Roth as the aforementioned criminal--seem to be having a ball.  When Norton and a never-dewier Drew Barrymore are loose in a springtime New York so enchanting that even the store window mannequins have to strike a special pose for them, you get a happy, fizzy glow.  And when a set of dancing ghosts causes a conga line at a memorial service, all bets are off; Allen may have officially crossed over from neurotic to delusional, but this adorably addle-pated film is never less than endearing.",1154563200,2,1615,4.95925925925926

In this under-rated bauble, the king of neurosis confirms the answer to that question in the first person. The humor is typical Allen --- witty, droll and fast-paced --- and the parody is sufficiently far over the edge to make the point without beating it to death. The concept of a Woody Allen musical only adds to this glorious parody of Allen's New York.

Reading reviews that criticize this film because the singing is less than first-rate, I can only chuckle. The point of the film is absurdity. Pavarotti's rendition of ""I'm Through With Love"" wouldn't cut it. Oh, and by the way, corpses can't actually sing. Whatever flaws the actors bring to the songs help make the point.

Whatever the reason, I loved this movie. I loved that Woody Allen combined his usual genius humor with an even larger stroke of originality by making this movie also a musical. I loved the movie's whimpsical expression of the trials and tribulations of the cast through music. I loved the quirky and perfectly chosen cast comprised of some of my favorite actors and actresses: a younger, pre-'Closer' Natalie Portman (and Julia Roberts), an exuberant Alan Alda, Goldie Hawn, Edward Norton, and, of course, the incomprable Natasha Lyonne.

The story lines were the usual Woody Allen: funny, relateable, and interspersed with the classic Allen neuroses. The musical performances (several performed by the actors themselves) were originally offbeat in a way that only Woody can do, and right up my street- fun, endearing gershwin/ellington/cole porter-esque familiar melodies that even the most hardened ear can appreciate. They had me singing and tapping my feet right along with the cast. I laughed especially hard in the 'taxi cab scene' as well as 'the kitchen scene' where Natalie Portman swears off love, both scenes in which Woody's comedic use of the musical genre were particularly spot on.

936031,4,630450392X,"`Everyone Says I Love You', written and directed by Woody Allen should have been entitled `Fickle, thy name is Woman', as it seem to be about one romantic change of mind after another by the leading female characters in the story.

Woody has parodied virtually every other genre of movie and play, so it was only a matter of time until he got to doing a parody of a musical. Thankfully, the Woodman did not try to write his own original songs for the story. Instead, as he almost always does, he borrowed songs from other Broadway and Hollywood musicals, mostly, I believe, from the Twenties and Thirties. I could have sworn that most of them were written by Cole Porter, but only one was. There was also one song from Rodgers and Hart, but anonymous songwriters from what was once known as Tin Pan Alley composed most others.

What was less fortunate was that all cast members, including the multi-talented Mr. Allen did all their own singing. And, with the possible exception of Drew Barrymore, not one of them seemed to be able to effectively carry a tune. It wasn't that they were off key so much as all their voices were incredibly thin. One expected them to crack under the strain on every line. There are a few numbers done by a standard Broadway type chorus that both work and are immensely funny.

As usual, Allen has his cast of thousands, headed by the likes of Julia Roberts, Goldie Hawn, Alan Alda, Edward Norton and Natalie Portman (in a very young, pre-Star Wars role). Particularly clever was the casting of Tim Roth as an ex-con, playing a role stolen whole from a Quentin Tarantino script.

The story has a sense of being a first draft of `The Royal Tennenbaums', although I confess it is not as good as this dark comedy.

Oddly, very few of Allen's usual subjects and themes make it into this movie. It seems as if he was committed to making the film as lighthearted as possible and he certainly succeeds in that. The danger is that unlike some of his other seriocomic family dramas such as `Crimes and Misdemeanors' and `Hannah and Her Sisters', this movie threatens to float away for lack of substance.

What is going for it mostly are the performances of actors who seem to really be enjoying themselves and the lovely scenery in Manhattan, Paris, and Venice, lovingly photographed by Carlo DiPalma.

This is a movie primarily for Woody Allen fans and Goldie Hawn fans. Fans of musicals will probably be disappointed. The best thing about it is that it succeeds in being funny.",1120435200,5,2499,4.614864864864865

936094,4,630450392X,"By now, Woody Allen fans have learned to take the long view in evaluating his, uh, oeuvre. Those of us who remember such early efforts as BANANAS or TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN--which we loved but no one was about to try and pass off as great cinema--also remember when almost out of the blue, Allen became a filmmaker to be reckoned with.  LOVE AND DEATH was sharp, literate and suggested that could put together a well crafted film.  But ANNIE HALL caused genuine excitement, garnered deserved critical acclaim and (although Allen purportedly could not have cared less) Academy Award nominations.  It seemed, at the time, a quantum leap in terms of sophistication.  It also hinted at artistic problems that would start to surface in later films.
One of the key differences between ANNIE and the earlier comedies was the lightly self-referential touch.  If Allen had always played a nebbishy everyman in his early comedies: he now played--truer to his actual life experience certainly--a nebbishy successful filmmaker and comedian.  The change was crucial.  He was no longer a little man. Alvy Singer may have been a neurotic mess, but, like Woody Allen, he was a real player.
By the time we get to EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU some 20 years later, Allen's milieu is clearly defined--and extended.  The single and childless Alvy and Annie have been replaced by the multi-married, no longer together Joe and Steffi (Goldie Hawn)  and their array of children from their various marriages, blended, by all appearances, more or less successfully.  Like so many of Allen's later films, it takes place in a glowing, warm upper middle class Manhattan (when we're not off to Paris or Venice).  It's a world most of us can only dream of  (as was true of the young and struggling Woody Allen once).
If EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU's setting is a kind of fantasyland, its characters are probably equally fantastic.  Sophisticated, sweetly neurotic, but hardly desperate, these are people who remain best friends with former spouses, with no lingering ""issues"" rearing their heads at odd moments.  College aged children play cupid for their own parents, and go, with a  nod and a wicked wink, way beyond innocent PARENT TRAP territory.  But nothing is done maliciously.  Intentions are sort of good even when they involve such unethical behavior as eavesdropping on a private therapy session.
As warm and engaging as the characters are, and as attractive as their world seems, placing it all in the context of an old-style ""burst into song"" kind of musical belies all that.  If the similar milieu of  HANNAH AND HER SISTERS seemed like a possibility (a real world that we're just not fortunate enough to inhabit), this film's setting is pure fantasy.  It is tempting to say that in his post-Mia period, Allen is projecting a vision of the kind of social world where forgiveness and reconciliation are not only possible, but are a virtual given.
It's probably not wise to rely on a psycho-analytic approach to Woody Allen's films.  It's hard to ignore the fact though that both in real life and in his films, Allen went from dyed-in-the-wool bachelorhood to having an extended, perhaps eccentric family situation.  It cannot be surprising that themes of family and forgiveness should appear in his later films.  What's fascinating here is that these themes are addressed in a normally light-entertainment mode (musical comedy).  It makes the yearning for innocence all the more profound in a way.
The music is pretty good too.  Yes, the untrained voices of the actors work only in the context of the movie and no one's going to rush out looking for the soundtrack, but in that context, the device does work fairly well.  Call it a little ""alienation effect"" or an ""Allen-ation"" effect.  I find the songs effective for the most part, and certainly no more disturbing than some of the more traditional bits of surrealism in Woody Allen films (e.g. Marshall McLuhan jumping out from behind a movie display board in ANNIE HALL to lecture some pretentious buffoon about the real significance of his work).  ANNIE was a great film, EVERYONE SAYS isn't quite on that level.  But in the overall context of his work, it's certainly merits our attention--and our affection.",1068336000,3,4238,4.912921348314606

This movie is set in Manhattan and Paris. It shows all the seasons of New york and Paris. But the winter season of the movie is the most incredible parts of the film. This is one of the things i love about mr. allen he uses new york and his surroundings and shows them in a incredible way.
This movie centers around various members of a madcap Manhattan wealthy- very high society, democratic family, who attempts by turns to find romance. Allen returns to his improvisational comic vein, reportedly springing the musical numbers on his nonmusical stars--only Barrymore was dubbed--shortly before production began.
In this film, director Woody Allen mixes song-and-dance with his usual array of neurotic, upscale New Yorkers suffering romantic woes.
 Allen's character's daughter DJ-(Natasha Lyonne) is the narrator telling stories about her crazy, multi-layered extended family and their love lives.
Her family includes :
her step-father Bob -(Alan Alda)
her mother Steffi-(Goldie Hawn)
her sister Skylar-(Drew Barrymore),
her sister's fiance Holden-(Edward Norton)
her brother scott (Lukas Haas)
her half sister laura-(Natalie Portman)
ex-convict James Ferry-(Tim Roth)
and the object of her father's obsession Von-(Julia Roberts).
 While the impending wedding of young lovers Holden and Skylar is the centerpiece of the film, we also get to know various members of Skylar's family -- and their dysfunctional love lives.
Sklyar( Barrymore) and Holden (Norton) are to get married but things are soon shaken by the fact that her mother invites a just released convict by the name of James Ferry ( Roth) skylar falls for mr. perry and decides to call off the wedding.
that's when the hijinxs begin. But will Skylar choose Holden or Perry ?
Woody allen's character Joe is also in love with Von(Julia Roberts)  who just so happens to attend therapy session with Joe's daughter Dj's step sister's friend's mother dj knows everything
about Von and tutors her father about her likes and dislikes.
Laura (portman) on ther hand is competing with her best friend(Gaby hoffman) for the heart of a rich teenage boy.
DJ(Lyonne) while evryone is looking for love for DJ love comes to her and she falls in love with numerous of men thru out this movie...a italian artist, a man she shares a cab with, a man dressed as one of the marxs brothers at a party.
The only person in the film who isn't in love is lukas haas who plays alan alda's son scott they are sort of butting heads with each other cause they can't see eye to eye cause his father is democrat and scott is a republican.
The characters often express their feelings through
such classic tunes as ""Just You, Just Me"" and ""My Baby Just Cares for Me,"", "" If I had you"" making this one of the more unique movies in Allen's oeuvre.
 Everyone in the movie looks for love in all the wrong places- whether it be in the form of a criminal or neurotic married woman. Three of the best characters is the grandfather- both before and after he dies and the ex convict James Perry- Tim Roth who has a very good singing voice, and drew barrymore who plays a virginal very proper woman ( something we haven't seen drew play) but she shines in this movie.
 The cast really makes this movie special. Allen has made a extraordinary modern musical that still has the old-fashion feel to it, a diffucult thing to do in this day and age.
I give it *****5 Stars! and two thumbs way up!",1062806400,7,3633,4.769475357710652
936096,5,630450392X,"Can I just say that I was 12 years old when I first saw this film, and had no remote idea as to who Woody Allen even was?  After viewing this delight of a movie, I completely fell in love with his style and wit, and I quickly rented his other works such as ""Manhattan"", ""Annie Hall"", and ""Celebrity"". Some were good, some were mediocre, and some were just plain boring. But none of them were like ""Everyone Says I Love You"".
Famous for his all-star casts, ""Everyone"" starts off with - what else? - a couple: Drew Barrymore as the charming Skylar and Edward Norton as the neurotic, albeit determined Holden. Shot in a grainy, peculiar style reminiscent of the 1960s and '70s musicals, the film quickly establshes itself as a romantic musical comedy, and you know you are headed for a magical ride when the mannequins displayed in the posh store windows start singing along with the principal actors.
Narrated by the wonderful up-and-coming actress Natasha Lyonne (in one of her first roles!), the film's plot mainly revolves around a not-so-average Park Avenue family. Kind of a ""Brady Bunch"" for the Manhattanite crowd, the family is both dysfunctional, peculiar, and wildly entertaining. Goldie Hawn plays the liberal mother, married to Alan Aldas, the charming stepfather, and then there's their barrel full of kids. Some, like Drew and Natasha's characters, are from Goldie's previous marriage to Woody's character, a writer living in Paris. Others, like Lucas Haas, Gaby Hoffmann, and Natalie Portman, are children of Hawn's current marriage. And of course, there is the wandering, cranky Grandpa and the foreign dictator of a maid. Playing the part of Drew's fiancee is the sweet Norton. Julia Roberts also makes an appearance as Allen's dream lover. Of course, he knows everything about her from his daughter, who regularly listens in on her therapy sessions.
""Everyone Says I Love You"" features a strong cast, solid performances (an especially great one by Tim Roth, who shows up as a hilarious felon eager for Drew's affection), and wonderful, nostalgic songs from the '30s and '40s (think Marx Brothers). As always, Allen's loving relationship with NYC shines through, and scenes filmed in Venice and Paris are breathtaking. Did I mention this film is magical? Expect singing ghosts, a levitating Goldie Hawn, and a Marx fest at the end. Don't let the weirdness dissuade you - it takes awhile to get into, but the end result is satisfying.

The story makes sense:  these people are muddling through their lives.  That is the great truth of life.  We muddle through our lives in little bits and bites of sincerity smeared with dabs of denial.  All we can do in the whole thing is what Woody's crew manages to do in this movie: do it together.  They not only believe in the project and each other: they believe in the viewer.  They invite us to muddle through life with them, and so they ask us to muddle through life with our own ""each others"".  That is why the movie is so sweet to watch, so excellent a work of art, and so profound an artifact.",1049760000,2,781,4.3310344827586205
936099,3,630450392X,"It's difficult to know what to make of the modern musical, something that has suddenly become a whole lot more popular given the success of movies such as Moulin Rouge and Chicago.  Everyone Says I Love You is a musical of a different kind, evoking the same style of the musicals of the 30's and 40's to produce a nostalgic look back not only at such movies but also at the way they treated love and comedy.
Allen plays a guy who can't find a suitable partner until his daughter's spying at the psychiatrist allows him to recreate all of Julia Roberts' fantasies.  Alongside that we have his ex-wife's (Hawn) typically disfunctional family with daughter Barrymore leaving fianc Norton for ex-con Roth whilst other daughter Portman is infatuated with a boy across town.  All the while husband Alda is trying to keep a tight reign over his children's exploits.  So basically there's plenty of room fo broad farcical comedy, most of which is very effectively done, although typically most of this comes from a sterling cast's excellent performances.  Barrymore is as illuminous as ever when we see her choking on her own wedding ring.  Norton adds another diverse role to his already formidable resum of fantastic turns.  Hawn, Alda and Allen play their respective parts to perfection, managing to subtly suggest the strains that children and work have on their personal lives whilst still portraying plenty of comedy.  It's also more than interesting to see Natalie Portman in a role post-Leon but pre-Star Wars.
If this doesn't click quite as well as it maybe should it's probably because the musical has become such a spectacular event in recent years to make Allen's film virtually incomparable to something as passionate as Moulin Rouge.  At the end of the day this is just a diversion, but it's a very pleasing diversion whilst it lasts and the cast really do fire on all cannons.",1043798400,,1883,4.841121495327103
936100,3,630450392X,"Woody Allen's foray into the musical genre is charming, whimsical and makes for delightful entertainment. Though some have complained that Woody didn't use professional singers, I think such an objection rather misses the point: The use of clearly untrained singers has an endearing effect; it binds us to the characters in many ways, for they are ordinary people like us, not artificial Broadway types. It draws attention to the blurriness between art and life, fantasy and reality, as all of Woody's films do.
Overall, it must be admitted that Everyone Says I Love You is really no more than a pleasant diversion. The characters are too shallow to engage us in the profound way that Woody's other characters do. Nevertheless, it is worth a look from time to time.",1037232000,,765,4.937984496124031
936101,4,630450392X,"Another whimsical Woody Allen.  This time, he trots out another of his semi plot-less epics set in and around upper-crust Manhattan where everybody's lives are perpetually under threat of not being happy enough.  Joe (Allen) loved but divorced Steffi (Goldie Hawn).  Steffi re-married Bob, here played by Alan Alda as another of the guys who is either stealing or has stolen love from Woody's alter ego (he nabbed Mia Farrow in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and remained a wife-grasping presence in ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"").  This time, Allen's on better terms with his extended and disrupted family, which treats him much as the favorite, if befuddled Uncle.  The teenage children of this privileged family conspire with their like-privileged and private-school-educated friends to find love for Allen's pathetic Joe.  Quickly, they settle on Julia Roberts, who receives psychotherapy from the mother of one of these conspirators.  Having an inner window into Roberts' characters' deepest desires allows Joe a romantic opportunity he can't turn down.  Meanwhile, Steffi's eldest daughter, Skylar (Drew Barrymore) is engaged to the ernest and loving, if boring Holden (Ed Burns).  Although they share love, Skylar can't help looking elsewhere.  Meanwhile, Skylar's brother, Scott (Lukas Haas) has suddenly developed into a prudish, right-wing conservative, countering the typically left-wing attitudes of just about everybody else in the surrounding parsec of upper Manhattan.  The efforts of Bob and Steffi to make themselves better liberals by rehabilitating a convicted criminal throw their family into comedic chaos when that criminal is revealed to be played by Tim Roth.
Oh yeah, this is also the Woody Allen movie where everybody sings.  Much of the music is clearly patterned on Allen's love for old films and musicals, and tilts to the whimsical.  The plot is light, but the characters are game.  Because there's little more story than the interactions and duets of the characters, the film is somewhat open-ended.  Still, the film is something of a love song for Manhattan as seen through children (who keep things rolling with their romantic plotting).  The film ends with Hawn and Allen dancing along the Seine - Steffi flying through the air because the laws of gravity have been suspended for her as they have been for the plot.",1026000000,2,2341,5.303523035230352
936102,5,630450392X,"Who woulda thought the Woodman could do something like this? Even as recently as 1996,when this film came out, Woody still had major chops, as witnessed by this perfect musical.  This is a sublime blend of whimsy, romance, and wit.  It's hard not to say that when you see a roomful of ghosts singing and rhumbaing to ""Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think""), or when a hospital staff and crippled patients sing and dance about love, marriage, and parenthood.
It's also touching to see Tim Roth as a tough escaped convict sing a love song to Drew Barrymore; the juxtaposition of these two opposites brings out the feeling much more than a singing citizen ever could have.  And Woody and Goldie's flight-filled romantic rendition of ""I'm Through With Love"" on the banks of the Seine is utterly charming, making the heart float as lightly as Goldie does during her dancing.
Woody evokes Groucho Marx in an ensemble dance number about Captain Spalding (sung in French, no less!), and individually, when talking to Goldie, complete with glasses, eyebrows, and mustache--and he does a more than passing fair version of Mr. Marx himself.
One subplot about a girl in her twenties going through six or seven boyfriends in the course of the film is a hoot, and there's even a tinge of political satire as well--in the shape of a Young Republican who undergoes a magical transformation.
This will make you smile all the way through.  If only Woody had the panache now that he showed so well in this film.  This one's superb Woody Allen.",1025222400,15,1529,4.754716981132075
936143,4,630450392X,"Woody Allen courts Julia Roberts.  (I wonder if Woody writes his own dialogue these days or just chalks it in and improvises.  Maybe he gives a signal to the other actor(s) that it's their turn.)  Yes, I am eating my heart out, but believe it or not-and I swear this is true and Julia Roberts herself will vouch for this-she was once courted by an orangutang.  True story.  You could look it up.  It was a PBS special.  I'm serious.  You think I could make up something like this?  She even held a baby orangutang in her arms and he...well, let's just say he wasn't wearing a diaper.  I kid you not.
Anyway, this is a kind of satirical take off on Broadway musicals, but half on the square.  It features a lot of show tunes and dance numbers, some beautifully choreographed.  Goldie sings, Alan Alda sings, Julia sings and of course Woody sings.  (Drew is dubbed, I understand).  Ed Norton also sings, but the difference is, he's actually good.  Goldie Hawn is the mom, Woody is her ex and Alan Alda is her current.  They are all rich and privileged and spend their time in places like New York and Paris and Venice.  Goldie is a flaming, bleeding heart liberal who thinks that prisons ought to have a cuisine at least, and Alda is an establishment lawyer and doctrinaire liberal.  His son consequently devours the National Review and is a member of the National Rifle Association, and thinks that welfare mothers ought to get a job, etc.  Woody Allen is Woody Allen of course.  I haven't seen one of his films in decades, but watching him put the moves on Julia brings back memories.  You almost believe it.  In fact, you DO believe it.  And lament.
Tim Roth plays an ex-con, just released from prison, invited to a family dinner by Goldie.  (Extended family dinners involving kids and grandparents and eccentric relatives stirred by light-hearted family politics are a staple of the Woody Allen canon, as I recall.)  Roth's ""animal"" magnetism, and his ""interesting"" kiss entice Drew away from her intended (at least temporarily).  The story is narrated by Woody and Goldie's daughter (Natalie Portman, I presume), who finds herself falling in and out of puppy love with the regularity of the rising sun.  Everything is played as a light satire of the intended audience, a technique perfected by Oscar Wilde in his play, The Importance of Being Earnest over a century ago.  In a sense Woody Allen's effort amounts to a gentle massage of psyche of the New York liberal establishment.
Some highlights: The Marx Brothers song and dance number done en francaise near the Seine in Paris allowing Woody to do a fine Groucho impersonation; Drew's peach satin dress; Julia jogging in Venice; the intensive care unit choreography; mannequins coming to life in song and dance..
All in all, there's some cute fun had with Broadway show traditions, people breaking into song at odd moments, mostly standards from the pre-rock and roll era, e.g., ""My Baby Just Cares for Me,"" ""Making Whoopie,"" (yes, that is where Whoopie Goldberg got her moniker), and the beautiful ""I'm Through with Love,"" (sung not badly by Goldie Hawn), a few good gags, a cute cast--enough of interest to divert one after an afternoon of hard-core shopping at Neiman-Marcus and Sak's Fifth Avenue.",1025136000,2,3257,4.757575757575758

There are some Allen touches, like the analyst, and the shaky relationships, but everything works out. Like in Astaire and Rogers film where their down on their luck, they stick through it and it eventually works out. A musical should entertain first and foremost, and this one did that wonderfully. My favorite part is the dancing ghosts singing ""Enjoy Yourself"" or Ed Norton singing "" My Baby Just Cares for Me"" at the ring store.

936146,5,630450392X,"When people are very happy or sad, they do weird things. This is what happens in this Woddy Allen movie: they sing. People in `Eveyone Says I Love You' sing to show their happiness to the world; or to get over with their sadness. And, boy, how good this sing is.
The plot --as if there were one -- follows the ups and downs in love life of a New York family and their friends during the period of one year. The story is narrated by Dj, one of the members of this family. She shows us her stepsister who is about to marry an yuppie, but follows for an ex-con; her daddy who lives in Paris and cannot commit himself for too long, despite falling in love all the time; her mother and stepfater who have an apparently perfect marriage; her two little sisters who falls for the same kid; and she herself loves every new boy she meets. And that is how things go.
The film takes place mostly in New York City, which is beautifully shot through the course of the four seasons in one year. Part of the action trips to Paris and Venice, which are also so beautiful that makes this film a present for the eyes --and, of course, for the ears. And so does the cast, that includes Julia Roberts, Goldie Hawn, Nathalie Portman, Drew Barrymore, Edward Norton, Tim Roth, Nathasha Lyonne and, of course, Woody Allen.
New York has never been so musical. Everybody sings and dance everywhere -- even the corpse in a funeral. That's why the film is so sunny -- even though when the snow is falling -- and funny. Mocking with the musicals in general, made Allen not to be commited to make a `serious' movie. Many times characters stop doing whatever they are doing in order to start  singing, very out of the blue. And definitely, this is where lies most of the charm of the film.
The songs themselves are a show. Allen had the ideia of giving a new groove to old romantic musics. So you may have heard it before, but not in this way. They perfectly match every scene they are in. Virtually, the entire cast sings -- barring Drew Barrimore whose songs were sang by an amateur singer in order to not be so different from the others. Of course, the most strange moment is when Woddy Allen sings -- we have to addimit: he doesn't have a tenor's voice--, but he deliveries very fine.
All in all, `Everyone Says I Love You' is a declaration of love to Love. The songs express many different ways of love and loving. You will smille and laugh. And I dare you to sit still and not sing and dance along.",1014940800,4,2473,4.3068669527897

I have enjoyed his work over the past 25+ years - especially the recent ""Deconstructing Harry"" which was excellent.  Clearly Mr. Allen is at his best when he's being funny - something he does so well.  He also has proclivity for wanting to create films which are nostalgic and romantic.  In my view he is not bad at this but he is not particularly good either.
This film failed to draw me in and I have to admit that I was not sufficiently interested to watch it all the way through.  On that basis I would hesitate to recommend it.

936151,4,630450392X,"I must preface my remarks by admitting I never liked Woody Allen films, his humor and neurotic little guy characterization are simply unfunny -- but, after viewing Everyone Says I Love You, I've changed my mind.
A film that harkens to the wacky musical genre of the past, the outstanding performances by a stellar cast including Allen Alda, Goldie Hawn, Ed Norton, Tim Roth, Julia Roberts, and Drew Barrymore, is nostalgic and entertaining for today's audiences.  Singing and dancing, whining and wineing, the film utilizes New York's spectacular seasonal changes, the romantic canals of Venice, and the beauty of nightime Paris to stage this somewhat simple storyline of boy loves girl,  girl is more neurotic than boy, and the libral Democratats are more neurotic and simple than all the film's boys and girls.
Enjoyable perhaps because Allen does not center the story on himself in every scene, I found myself liking the implausible situations as actors broke into songs of love, which no matter what the setting, seemed thoroughly appropriate for the dramatic situation.  I loved watching Goldie Hawn dancing with her nebbish partner Allen along the banks of the Seine. Her gravity defying graceful steps were matched by the equally graceful Allen.  Alan Alda's serenade to his wife at their anniversary party was both touching and a good rendition.  And, Allen's hysterical New Year's Groucho Marx theme party and musical review had me in tears laughing.  The wit and droll humor of tranlating familiar songs into foreign languages is a brilliant juxtiposition of expectation and surrealism.
This is a wonderful film to spend the afternoon or evening, and while sentimental films are not usually my cup of tea, I found myself enjoying the romantic Allen film moreso than the visual, energetic angst and splendid efforts of the recent Baz Lurhmann musical, Moulin Rouge.  Both directors approach to the musical genre is respectful of the great choreographers and songwriters of the past. However, the differing styles each director brings to the subject is worth consideration.  Everyone Says I Love You is perhaps a bit less energetic and overt, but is equally satisfying as Moulin Rouge.

Although I still think Allen should be looking for stand-ins where he usually plays, he does well in his own film this time; the songs are well-chosen (although we could have done without hearing Julia Roberts' singing); never ill-suited to any scene, and having most of the cast sing the songs in their own voice is a stroke of brilliance.
See this with your significant other on Valentine's day, as I did, and with a group of friends if you can--even non-Woody fans will be hard pressed not to like this film.  It's charming, and in my opinion, one of the best 'date' films of recent memory.

That being said, also allow me to say that this film was one  of my favorite films of the last ten years.  From the very first song until  the song-and-dance at the end, I couldn't stop smiling.  The film was  utterly delightful and harkened back to the golden days of the movie  musical, where the fun and the the spirit of the musical were more  important than big budget stereophonic extravaganzas.  Woody Allen uses a  whole batch of classic-if-somewhat-forgotten tunes to complement his light  and fluffy love story.  Practically everyone in the movie is given a chance  to sing (except Drew Barrymore, who was dubbed).  Some are better than  others, but the overall effect is quite magical.  My favorite tune was the  simple ballad that Alan Alda sings to Goldie Hawn during their characters'  anniversary.  It was touching and just quite romantic.  And it's quite  amusing (in a good way) to watch Edward Norton(!) and Tim Roth(! ) sing.  This is easily one of the best musicals to come out in an extremely long  time.  As for Woody Allen, he plays...Woody Allen, but for once, I didn't  mind at all. I was simply too enthralled by the spell his film was casting  over me.
As for the DVD, the transfer is quite acceptable.  The picture  looks good, and the sound, while monophonic, is crystal clear.

But that's the whole point. Woody Allen has always been an  exploring sort of director and in this one, he explores the realm of  musical, which became old news by the late 70's. But still, this movie is  worth a look, especially if you're a fan of movies like 'Singing in the  Rain' and 'My Fair Lady'.  What really suprised me was that the actors  (most of them anyway) had good singing voices. I wasn't suprised really  that Goldie Hawn could belt a tune like the rest of them, but Edward  Norton?  The guy is notorious for the meaty roles like in 'Primal Fear'  and 'Fight Club'. But he's got a wonderful singing voice. As does Natasha  Lyonne, and whomever sung for Drew Barrymore. The only ones I wasn't wild  about were Woody Allen's (sorry buddy) and Julia Roberts (love ya, call me  when you aren't doing a romantic comedy). But that comes with the  territory.  The premise is that the narrator is a rich girl who can't make  up her mind about romance. Her name is DJ (played by Natasha Lyonne, for a  better movie starring her I suggest you rent 'Slums of Beverly Hills'). She  has a sister named Skylar (played by Drew Barrymore) who is engaged to  Holden (played by the adorably bumbling Edward Norton). Her biological  father is Woody Allen and he is currently residing in Paris. Her mother is  Goldie Hawn, who got remarried to Alan Alda. From a previous marriage he  has two daughters (played by Gaby Hoffman and Natalie Portman) and a son  (played by Lucas Haas). Despite the somewhat confusing start, the movie  flows eloquently and you even find yourself enjoying the cheesy dancing.  Overall, it's a pretty good movie, and some of these actors should consider  signing up with Virgin Records!",961804800,,1867,4.615853658536586
936251,3,630450392X,"This film has only one really funny scene in it.  The ""everyone sings"" gag just doesn't work.  Lucky for Allen he can keep doing a movie a year and lose money 80 per cent of the time.  This one has an army  of ""names"" in the cast, which is a growing trend in Woody's  films.  This one is a rental at best I think, particularly since it's $9  more than ""Manhattan"".",960940800,,364,4.042253521126761
936252,4,630450392X,"In Woody Allen's film Everyone Says I Love You, one of the century's great filmmakers gets to make his own dream come true. Just take a listen to the soundtracks for Manhattan or Radio Days and you realize that all the  Woodman's ever wanted to do was make a musical.
He's finally found a  way. And by taking those timeless songs of Gershwin and Porter and placing  them in the context of modern family life, Allen has created one of his  most innovative comedies ever.
By its very nature, musicals showcase  fabulous singers who are able to stop the world and belt out a tune. Not  exactly in the realm of the possible. But by filling his scenery with  non-singers, or actors who aren't known for their singing, Allen creates  the possibility of song in everyday real life.
Take Holden (Edward  Norton), for example. What he lacks in fashion sense, he makes up for in  heart. When he goes to buy a rock for his lady love Skylar (Drew  Barrymore), the jewelry store becomes a Gene Kelly musical, except Holden's  no hoofer. He stumbles awkwardly through the dance number while the jewelry  store employees play to the camera.
If it sounds fun, it is. But the two  young lovebirds are but a minor diversion. Skylar's mom Steffi and husband  Bob (Goldie Hawn and Alan Alda) are trying to keep their family together.  Grandpa's gone daffy, their teenage son has up and joined the young  Republican's (ick!), and Goldie's ex, Joe (Allen), is living in Paris and  wooing an art historian (Julia Roberts).
Even the worst singing, that of  Allen (a mouse squeak) and Roberts (can you say tone deaf?), works somehow.  In Everyone Says I Love You the commonplace collides with the extraordinary  in an alternate universe that's just this side of heaven.",958089600,3,1744,4.68976897689769

Anyone who loves the music of the 30's and 40's like me is bound to  enjoy this film. There are so many classic,and familiar songs you might  find yourself humming along. The songs include ""I'm Thru With  Love"",""Just You,Just Me"",""Makin' Whoopee"",and  ""Looking At You"". The acting is great,and Allen's directing is  terrific. The movie is about how a bunch of Manhattaners try to find love  in the big apple and in Venice. Allen makes wonderful use of Venice by  showing just what kind of charming place it is.

936256,4,630450392X,"Woody Allen delivers one of his finest films ever. Even though the man as an actor gets annoying after a while, I still have to give him credit where its due.  The cast was incredible, even Goldie Hawn, whom I normally can't  stand, was likable.  Alan Alda is alwasy great, and his left wing liberal  ideals clashing with his son's (played by a very funny Lucas Haas) very  right wing ideals is a great joke througout.  Drew Barrymore is cute as  hell, Tim Roth is funny as he has ever been, and narrator Natasha Leonne (I  think thats her name.)is a delight to have around. The Muscial numbers are  very clever and fit in well as Woody pays homage to the classic style  Hollywood Musical Comedy. Edward Norton, once again, gives a grand,  impressive performance.  This was NOT his first film though.  Edward  Norton got his start in the Richard Gere drama ""Primal Fear"", for  which he recieved his first Academy Award nomination (and he should've won,  too!!)",937267200,,960,4.625

The fine cast (Alan Alda, Julia Roberts, Edward Norton), the incisive process of deconstruction and reaffirmation of a family.  in N.Y:C. where the dreams, hopes and fantasies are intermingled with caustic situations and unforgettable musicals.

Hint: There is a small detail that I could capture. Watch the sequence in Venice when Julia crosses the small bridge (It is a tongue in the cheek to a memorable film of the past Summertime of David Lean )(In this case it is Katherine Hepburn)",1514678400,,585,4.83

Several other studios canceled musicals already in production -- today it's a big hit on Broadway. Of course Woody went ahead anyway and made this wonderful flop.  It deserves a second look.  Maybe it will make it to Broadway, too.  I've seen La La Land and, believe me, the music in this film is far superior. And Goldie Hawn and Alan Alda are far superior at singing off-key than Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.  And no one can pick great songs like Woody. The production numbers -- Making Whoopee, My Baby Just Cares for Me -- are amazing.  Hooray for Captain Spaulding in French! And the final dance with Woody and Goldie is unbelievable. The cast is incredible with unknowns Natalie Portman and Gaby Hoffman in key parts. Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore and Edward Norton round out the cast. The plot is absurd, but it doesn't matter. To round it out, Paris, Venice and New York are all gorgeous.",1496707200,2,1068,4.56544502617801
