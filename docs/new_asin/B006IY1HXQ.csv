8499063,4,B006IY1HXQ,"The third and final installment of Fsudol's Animated horror trilogy (City of Rott and Dead Fury being the other two). The story follows Ral Foster (played by Max Bludeharte, voiced by Frank Sudol) trying to survive a sudden alien invasion that occurred on night. He goes through his journey to get to a military base his neighbor Ruford Hoist (also voiced by Frank) once worked in while also figuring out what causes the red shock waves that paralyzes everyone and how to counter it.

First off I'm a huge Fsudol fan (one of my biggest inspirations to be an animator) so I really liked this movie when it first came out on Filmbaby. The story was simple and straightforward, the violence is over the top, the soundtrack is once again amazing due to Sudol's brilliant taste in music. The animation isn't the best per say (just like his other two movies) but it has a certain charm to it which is why I don't fault how limited the animation was.

I only give this movie four stars out of five due to a few complaints. First, I didn't like how they already figured out how they were not affected by the red shock so early in the film. Second, lack of female characters, Frank does know how to make interesting designs for his female characters but unfortunately he usually tends to kill them off or voice them himself, I suggested he should of hired a friend to voice the girl characters in his work, not to mention the girl in this movie had no purpose in the movie, (spoiler alert) she instantly died in the next scene after the mall scene where she was introduced, it's like he could've scrapped her out of the movie entirely. Other than that, it's a film worth watching at least once.",1448236800,,1685,4.485342019543974

8499065,5,B006IY1HXQ,"I love F.Sudol's work. In true, Romero-like fashion, his animated gore films are always bleak. This is no exception. I bought it a few weeks ago, and it is swiftly becoming the favorite. If you like his work, let him introduce you to his version of a Science Fiction/Horror film! Fun times.",1399852800,2,290,4.596153846153846
