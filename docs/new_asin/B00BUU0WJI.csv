8574211,5,B00BUU0WJI,"If you work in the trauma field and want to move toward ""trauma competence, then this is a must watch video. The EFT master - Gary Craig takes tough cases of PTSD in veterans and treats them with Emotional Freedom Techniques over a 5-day period and achieves what traditional cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic models may take years to achieve.  Excellent video.",1417305600,7,365,5.083333333333333
8574212,5,B00BUU0WJI,"I bought the DVD in 2012 for use with my clients and had no problem playing it on my DVD player.
This is an excellent movie clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of using EFT Tapping in treating vets and their spouses for PTSD (and yes spouses can be stressed just from dealing with a partner who has severe PTSD).
It is a follow up to the clinical study done by Dr. Dawson Church with vets where, even after 6 months, the PTSD symptoms had not returned in a large percentage of the vets treated.
Additional support for vets can be found at www.stressproject.org, which is mentioned on this DVD, but worth mentioning here if you have a problem getting this DVD.  There are some videos on this on You Tube as well.
June 27th is National PTSD awareness day in the US.",1412640000,5,767,4.439716312056738
8574213,5,B00BUU0WJI,"Although it surprised me that this DVD is not playable in a USA zone DVD player, it is worth watching if you have access to a DVD player that can be used for zone 4 DVDs. It is a really good documentary account of the value of using EFT with military veterans and their families.",1401494400,3,279,4.090909090909091
8574214,5,B00BUU0WJI,"This documentary, by Eric Huurre, is an amazing illustration of how combat veterans, who had given up hope of ever recovering from PTSD, had their hopes returned.  Seeing them and their families after the final treatments, I rejoiced with them for their renewed faith in themselves and their futures.

After viewing the film, I felt that if EFT could help these severely troubled veterans, I had to see what it could do for my own much less severe emotional issues.  I am grateful that his film led me to seek out EFT myself. Now I use it on my own when stressful issues arise.

While this film should be a ""must see"" for veterans, their families, and those currently serving in combat areas, it is just as beneficial to any other viewer like me, who may be searching for answers to help resolve some of their own emotional issues.",1364860800,7,831,4.557046979865772
