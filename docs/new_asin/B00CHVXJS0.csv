8581892,1,B00CHVXJS0,"Beware. The description of this DVD is NOT accurate.  Firstly it cannot be played on NTSC players.  It's region 2 not region 1.
Secondly even if you have a universal player or try to play it through VLC media player, there is no English selection.  There are no English subtitles nor is there English dubbing as the listing claims.  It's German or French. That's it.",1423180800,,366,4.584615384615384
8581893,4,B00CHVXJS0,"I would love to write a review of this film.  I was really looking forward to receiving it...but I may never see it.  Although the description clearly says the DVD is NTSC format (US and Canada only), and that the DVD has English subtitles, the format of the DVD I received is PAL and there are no subtitles listed in the description on the back of the case.  The description of the film is also in German.  (I speak a little, but not enough to carry me through the entire movie.  How disappointing!  Given the cast, I'm sure this film is good.  It may even be great...but I may never know.

Unfortunately, a star rating is required.  Since it's difficult to rate a film I can't watch, I ordered it because I was pretty sure I would like it, so I am giving it 3 stars.",1393200000,,768,4.205479452054795
