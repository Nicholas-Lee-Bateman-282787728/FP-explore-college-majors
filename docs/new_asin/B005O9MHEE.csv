8480960,1,B005O9MHEE,"The master hated Stalin. The cruise was a clumsy russian bear propanganda doucmentary.
The master was obviously not well and trying mightily to field banal questions. This was a wonderful man shown in a sad and dark light-- like Palmer's films---say, maybe palmer should have done this documentary.

Of course just seeing Shostakovich was a thrill in and of itself. But the outer world is a facade of sorts. I would do a film on this man and balance his glacial adagios--so deeply introspective ( sometimes too long like Mahler), and the joie de vivre of his happy splendid moments. The second movement of the 6th, the third and fourth of the 10th.

There are moods in music just as in regular life the vicissitudes and exigencies--but in that sacred world of the supreme creative mind is the elation of expression often wrapped in turbulence. There are storms in the mind and there are the most peaceful calm seas--- sometimes dolphins spring in the air to delight us and crash back into the frothy waves. Music is a discipline as well as an art form no doubt. Trick is to have the power to control what issues into the regular world of sound, sight and perception.

 Shostakovich smoked alot, sat alot, created alot--BUT at the body's expense. But that is their way, aside from devine Verdi, longevity is usually not in the cards for great composers. They give too much of themselves in honest and unrelenting dedication to their art.

There is power in Shostakovich and there is no doubt of that, but there is also happiness and joy. The tenth was written while Stalin was dying--poor man---perhaps he died before the last movement was written for it is among the most powerful and gorgious movements ever penned in the 20th century. What a relief for Shostakovich that that insane madman was gone ( Pay back for Stalin not liking his ninth?)

But the docuemntary in question- it brought us Shostavocih in the flesh. I love the man. I love his music. God Bless him and keep him forever.

Perhaps they will do a film on the explosive embrace of Bernstein and the master after a live performance of the fifth. The first perfomance of the cello cenocerto---holding hands afteward with ormandy ( he was shostakovich's favorite american conductor--so don't knock Eugene anymore), and Rostopovich.  Catch some exciting and happy moments--don't be a dark dungeon mind film maker like Palmer.",1338681600,4,2387,4.804878048780488
8480961,5,B005O9MHEE,"This is an artful documentary, visually vibrant and interesting, focusing on just one small part of Shostakovich's life -- his voyage to New York toward his final years. It uses a large variety of old film footage. We see some intriguing footage of Shostakovich. We are also treated to some old footage not directly related to Shostakovich. This gives the film a dream-like and timeless feel.

The combination of the whilwind of old film footage, the probing narrative, and the personal nature of Shostakovich's motivation for his voyage... together these things makes the film feel a little like a Shostakovich symphony; it is quirky, emotional, dark, and touching.

Both sides of my brain got a memorable glimpse into some personal and intriguing aspects of the composer and his world.",1334275200,12,787,5.093023255813954
8480962,4,B005O9MHEE,"Stalin's shadow remains cast over this production, even a half-century after his death.  The producers and directors of ""A Journey of Dmitri Shostakovich"" were not interested in motives or continuity, so you will need to review the entire story of the American journey --- from at least two unbiased sources --- before you attempt to watch this remarkable, unique, one-of-a-kind fragment of history.  Most valuable to me were the video captures of Shostakovich, footage I had never before seen.  If you are interested in this unusual detail of Shostakovich's life, by all means buy the DVD, but you will be sometimes surprised and sometimes disappointed.  I think it's worth the money for those who want to know more about the life of this Russian genius.",1330646400,12,755,5.016
