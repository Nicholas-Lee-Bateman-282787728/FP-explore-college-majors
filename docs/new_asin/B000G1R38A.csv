8128722,1,B000G1R38A,"Not only the acting is performed badly here, but the director wasn't up to his job either. The film shooting is boring and the script below all measurable quality levels.
This wasn't worth producing anymore than the local school play.
If you're willing to sit out all these major let-downs, maybe there is a message underneath worth hearing. I wouldn't know: I quit at 13 minutes. There it became too ridiculous for me.",1384300800,,419,4.7534246575342465
8128723,5,B000G1R38A,This movie teaches that God values you and he wants us to value others and ourselves. Only God can cause you to have life and live it to the fullest.,1276646400,,149,4.0

8128725,5,B000G1R38A,"I thought this was a great feel good movie.  It was interesting (and realistic) how the main characters conversion to Christianity effects so many people in her life, even if they seem hopeless.  This movie was very well done and I'd reccommend it to anyone looking for inspiration!",1253664000,,282,4.854166666666667
8128726,1,B000G1R38A,"living water didnot turn out to be the movie i expected. The acting is poor and the setting isn't quality. i will give it credit for having a message of keeping  faith in God.
But it isn't a movie i would recommend to someone.keep in mind that customers pay for quality.",1204156800,7,270,4.294117647058823
