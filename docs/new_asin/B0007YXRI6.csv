8054250,5,B0007YXRI6,"Loved this series.  Great acting, good comedy, good drama.  What's not to like?  I would totally buy the other seasons if they were available based on the quality of season one.",1438214400,,177,4.645161290322581
8054251,5,B0007YXRI6,I'm waiting for the next season. I can't believe they cancelled it on TV.  It's such a humanly humorous or would that be humorously human show. I loved it. Of course Mickael Riley makes any show he's in.,1430006400,,203,4.342105263157895
8054252,5,B0007YXRI6,"Every so often, I check back to see, if by any chance, seasons two and three of this wonderful Canadian TV show have yet been released. For reasons utterly mysterious to me, they have not, and the years just keep rolling by. However, even if all you can get is Season One, you are in for the joy of watching a marvelous cast give you a glimpse of life in all three dimensions--comedy, tragedy, humanity. Don't say you don't like lawyer shows--this is no more a lawyer show than A Christmas Carol is about counting-houses. However, it WILL make you think about justice and ""justice.""",1400198400,,582,4.552380952380952
8054253,5,B0007YXRI6,"Alice is a recent law school grad (played by Cara Pifko) accepts a position with a law firm working at the courthouse in Toronto, representing her firm's clients.  The senior attorney that hired her and was supposed to show her the ""ropes"" had a nervous breakdown prior to her first day and when she shows up at the courthouse she has to figure everything out on her own.

Great permanent cast and guests that are regulars on the Canadian acting circuit. Cases run the gamut from funny to ""gut wrenching"".  There is a male Prosecutor that likes to cut Alice's hair, a judge that is returning form a nervous breakdown, a mercenary assistant that works for the firm, though is only interested in how she can advance her own career and not helping Alice.  Cases can be both funny and heart wrenching.

The series ran for 3-years, though only the 1st year is commercially available.

Highly recommended.",1336435200,,899,4.694267515923567
8054254,5,B0007YXRI6,"As I write this, this set is almost out of print. I say almost, because while most Canadian retailers don't have it available any longer, the CBC's own shop site does have it, and for $40 Cdn., new.
That sure beats paying $90ish US...",1234828800,,234,4.340909090909091
8054255,5,B0007YXRI6,"This program is amazing! The characters are full of depth and humor and pathos. The stories are true slices of life; full of the incredible complexities of real human experience. I love that the stories are not neat little packages to be tied up at the end of the episode. The dialog rings true every time. While there is sorrow and angst in the character's lives, the wry humor in this series is intelligent and very enjoyable.
I only wish there were more seasons available and even more I wish CBC in its infinite wisdom had not cancelled it.",1188604800,7,544,4.505050505050505
8054256,5,B0007YXRI6,"I'm not a fan of lawyer shows, but this is a show about human beings, some of whom are lawyers, some of whom are judges, some of whom are accused and all of whom are changed by the experience. Funny and heart breaking and educational about what it's like to live underneath the headlines.",1174608000,5,288,4.351851851851852
