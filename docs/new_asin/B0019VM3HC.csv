This version has English subtitles and is longer by 20 minutes than what you find on Netflix. There are some scenes that this Turkish version has that I think are important and I wanted to see them. NOTE: Those missing scenes are ON THIS VERSION, so I bought this instead of using Netflix. (It works fine for me in the US on a Samsung DVD player.)

This is one of my top 5 favorite films and I don't even speak Turkish. (I watch it about every 6 months, and I almost NEVER re-watch films.) If you enjoy films that explore issues of culture, tradition and justice (or lack thereof), you will certainly find this a stimulating watch. I bet this film eventually makes it into some global top 10 list of all time best endings.

It is THAT good.",1434931200,,878,4.3090909090909095
