8454649,5,B000N9AOR2,"I own several instructional videos from many famous guitarists covering progressive rock, jazz and blues genres. When it comes to covering theory, this is the best by far. Scott really goes deep into scale and arpeggio options for both major and minor chord types in the first section. The second section strongly emphasizes phrasing and building runs that sound fluid and cohesive over chord progressions. Lots of other very helpful material here. This DVD will keep me busy for a long time to come. Definitley a must have for somebody wanting to expand their chops beyond your basic pentatonic and major and minor scales.",1174003200,2,623,5.0
