I decided to purchase this to watch it, but it wasn't worth it. It doesn't come divided in episodes like in the TV, and there's a bunch cut scenes in the DVDs. I were able to watch from episode 1 to 18 on internet and I know there's a lot of cut scenes on the DVDs. Definitely not worth it.",1468195200,,456,3.913978494623656
