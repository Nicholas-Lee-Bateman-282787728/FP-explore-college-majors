educational books I've ever read. This guide for
parents, teachers and communities is very helpful
in understanding why children shoplift- steal and how
to educate them in 'a supportive manner with practical
advice and strategies'.
You frequently see a group of youngsters roaming aimlessly
around the mall looking to get into mischief, to have fun.
In more occasions, than we would like to admit, that outing
ends in one or some of the group shoplifting. They are
shocked when they are caught and their parents and the
police are called. They believe that they were just having fun.
or abiding by a dare. What is wrong in taking an object without
paying for it - 'not such a big deal'. 'What is all the fuss about'
these children claim.
Judy Whalen's clarifies the problems and issues of shoplifting
for all parents, educators, guidance counselors and anyone else
who would like to change this atrocious situation.
I was shocked to read that 6 million shoplifters in the USA each year are children.
This fact is mind-blowing, so read this book and get insight into what
to do to stop this.",1416441600,,1141,4.767676767676767
