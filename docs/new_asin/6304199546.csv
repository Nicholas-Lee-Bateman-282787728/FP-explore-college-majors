809896,5,6304199546,"The above review describes, Yesterday's Assassins, this movie is Yesterday's Target.  Are these the same movie? (There are some movies with more than one title and both of these titles make sense for the movie, Yesterday's Assassins)  I couldn't find Yesterday's Assassins under that name at amazon.com.  Yesterday's Assassins was a terrifc movie. And ""the mutants"" were very different from the X-men.  The ""mutants"" in this movie are actually closer to the talented in Anne McCaffrey's series (The Rowan, Pegasus in flight, etc.)  Also, there was nothing at all the matter with the acting in the movie.",1094083200,,603,5.175257731958763
809897,1,6304199546,"This movie is basically a cheap rip off of the whole X-Men mutants story. Billy Balwin, and two cohorts are mutants sent back in time to help thwart disaster in the future. Of course, since Baldwin is involved, you know the acting is horrible. The dialogue is wretched at times, and the special effects (especially the fire effects) are totally cheesey. Save your money and buy both X-Men movies instead.",1093737600,5,404,4.785714285714286
7864876,2,6304199546,The movie was so darkly lit that sometimes the characters looked little better than a silhouette on the screen. Poorly shot and lit. LaVar Burton just didn't seem like the right casting for an evil bad guy. Premise/plot of the film was okay but really forced at times and I never really felt for any of the characters.,1523577600,,318,4.5
7864877,1,6304199546,The picture quality is so poor it looks like they shot it with an old camcorder in front of an old TV screen,1521417600,,108,3.739130434782609
7864878,2,6304199546,Ehhh....  do not bother....,1516406400,,27,5.75
7864879,2,6304199546,A marginal story presented by marginal actors results in a boring marginal movie. If you suffer through it to the end you will definitely know you never want to see it a second time.,1513900800,,182,4.382352941176471
7864880,4,6304199546,"This movie came out several years Before the first Xmen .
So needless to say it did not rip that series off. Perhaps the opposite!?
Sure it is a little dated but I still found it to be entertaining and a watchable""B"" movie.
It was kind of fun watching Levar Burton play a ""bad guy""
My 2 cents.",1513641600,,293,4.068965517241379
7864881,4,6304199546,"This film is almost 20 years old and is showings its age. However, even by the standards of the time, it wasn't a masterpiece of cinematography. That said, the story was decent and the cast features several quality actors who do the best they can with an uninspired script. I'm giving it four stars primarily for the underlying story, cast and satisfying ending. It has moments of realistic behaviors where human fallibility and nobility rear their heads. Better than 90% of science fiction films made during the 90's but could've been so much better in more capable hands.",1513209600,,573,4.857142857142857
7864882,3,6304199546,very good acting talent but not great acting.  pretty weak script and/or directing.  not exactly an original premise,1512172800,,116,5.388888888888889
7864883,3,6304199546,"...This movie could have been so much better if the 'movie magic' would have been properly used. As it stands, this movie is poorly written and poorly produced. The acting by the 'regulars' was pretty decent, but I must say, watching Levar Burton as the bad guy was a bit too much. This is one of those sci fi movies which relies too heavily on the bang, bang shoot'em up genre style action. I gave it three stars because I could at least watch it without fast forwarding too much... Give it a watch if you're a true die hard sci fi fan, otherwise skip it.",1511136000,3,556,4.254716981132075
7864884,5,6304199546,"One of the treatments for the Mutant X series, a copycat of the X-Men.  Like it!!",1510963200,,81,4.0625
7864885,4,6304199546,good,1508025600,,4,4.0
