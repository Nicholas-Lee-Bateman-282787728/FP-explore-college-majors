2440568,1,B000BTGY46,"If you have seen the most dry and amateur of stand ups you have seen a stand up comedian much better than mike epps. Im actually kind of angry that this guy took an hour of my life while i waited for him to say something funny and then said GOOD NIGHT and it was over! Horribly unfunny.... lame jokes.... dry.... boring.. and NOT FUNNY WHATSOEVER. No wonder why this guy never did stand up before. If you are silly enough to pick this garbage up pay attention to the audience.. 90% of the time these guys are laughing before he says the punch lines of his boring jokes. I think they are either A. very drunk ""which you can see lots of drinks when the camera zooms in on the audience"" or B. Paid ""because this guy is about as funny as a funeral procession"". HORRIBLE!",1149724800,2,766,4.217687074829932
2440569,1,B000BTGY46,"When I first saw this, I could never remember ever seeing Mike Epps doing any stand-up comedy, and after seeing this ridiculous show, I saw why. The man just wasn't funny. The jokes were dry and his routine was just flat out boring. This dvd really dissapointed me since I'm a really big Mike Epps fan and heard he was gonna be in a biographical movie about Richard Pryor. He should just stick to playing the crazy characters he always plays in movies and leave the stand-up to those who know what they're doing.",1149465600,2,512,4.457446808510638
2440570,1,B000BTGY46,"This was really bad. I'm a big fan of stand-up comedy, so I tried hard to laugh, at least once. Not possible.",1149292800,3,109,4.0
2440571,2,B000BTGY46,"This joint was not funny.  I was really surpised at how boring Mike Epps was.  I loved him in Friday but after seeing this on HBO I was  dissapointed.  The crowd in the audience looked I looked at home, bored.",1148169600,2,209,4.15
2440583,5,B000BTGY46,This was a funny DVD. I played during a recent get together and everyone enjoyed it and we even rewind it to see it again.,1355356800,,122,3.92
2440584,4,B000BTGY46,very funny.  i chose it because it had a bay area angle (and because my son is in the audience!),1268438400,,96,3.8
2440585,5,B000BTGY46,You have to give this one a chance. This was under rated. My family and I enjoyed this comedy... I even took the cd to work and everyone enjoyed this and had great laughs.. This was awesome.. I see some of the reviews are hard on this.. but Mike Epps deserves a chance.. This is funny! You will be entertained!,1258675200,,310,4.183333333333334
2440586,4,B000BTGY46,"Mike Epps is a funny dude. He's no Katt Williams but he's funny.

I'm very happy with this product. Received very quick also. Will do business again.",1234396800,,149,4.518518518518518
2440587,4,B000BTGY46,"Mike Epps has a differant kind of comedy style. Some hate it , some love it. I like it !",1232323200,,88,3.45
2440588,5,B000BTGY46,This man is halarious. The things he says will blow you away; at least they blew me away. He is a total nut. Genuine Comedy from the heart. I loved it.,1219708800,,151,3.903225806451613
2440589,5,B000BTGY46,"I'm pretty much the sort of person who laughs at pretty much anything, but I am literally clenching my sides everytime I watch the DVD. I even play the CD version when I'm driving in the car!!!!!!!",1218499200,,197,4.351351351351352
2440590,3,B000BTGY46,"Ok i thought this dvd would be really funny ,but i was really wrong it was like mike was looking for jokes to say... Not his best work ...stick to acting.",1213574400,,154,4.0
2440591,2,B000BTGY46,"I was never really a huge fan of Mike Epps. He, like Jim Carrey, only lands roles because people can count on him to make a complete fool out of himself to make you laugh. That works in a comedy movie.

So what happens when you take away the script, the supporting cast, and multiple takes to get it right? You end up with Mike Epps: Inappropriate Behavior.

I wanted to like it. I tried my hardest to like it and trust me, I will laugh at the crazy ways people die in today's ""horror"" films.....but this dude is VERY corny. He is not like any comic out there....which is a relief becasue I am tired of seeing the same recycled jokes.....but he also ain't that funny.

I DID laugh out loud a maybe 3 parts of the whole movie. The first day of school (I'ma KILL em in the morning!! was CLASSIC!!,  the TV talk shows with Montell and Joe Brown, and his real life experience of when he was in the Special Class with the football helmet and the desk bell. Other than that, I really just waited for the joke to be over. That whole ""Bad Boys"" song........if you see the stand up, you will totally understand.

I rated the stand up 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1 star because it wasn't ALL corny....just about 94% of it was. Everybody has their own laugh-o-meter so what's not so funny to me may be hilarious to you. Please watch it for yourself and be sure to rate it!",1199232000,2,1361,4.179389312977099
2440592,5,B000BTGY46,"Dude this is funny as hell. Although the middle of the dvd kinda lulls, it finishes pretty good. Impressions of Judge Joe Brown and Montel Williams are dead on, and talking about James Brown and someone stealing Michael Jackson's giraffe are pretty funny",1198022400,2,254,4.930232558139535
2440603,3,B000BTGY46,"Overall I can say that this was funny. Mike Epps had his moments where you can tell he was trying to think of something to say so he would bust out with something he said in one his movie roles, but he did say some funny junk and this was my first time seeing him do standup so I feel he did rather well. He knows how to keep his crowds attention even if he has to say something stupid and off the wall.",1192665600,,403,3.8095238095238093
2440604,1,B000BTGY46,"I like Mike Epps, in every movie I've seen him in he does a good job, BUT this dvd has nothing funny to it, he uses a lot of material from his movie parts that worked fine then but don't come across in a stand up bit. So overall if you want something funny, this aint it.",1184716800,,271,3.7719298245614037
2440605,5,B000BTGY46,For those who think this man is not intelligent; the joke is on you.  Mike Epps is definitely the best comic out today.  I watched his routine closely several times.  I caught him break character once or twice and he recovered nicely.  His genius is that he is believable as the court jester.  Would you call Gilbert Gotfried ignorant?  How about Frank Fountaine as crazy gougenheim on the old Jackie Gleason show? The brother has honed his craft well.,1178236800,,452,4.658227848101266
2440606,5,B000BTGY46,"I was totally blown the first time I watched this DVD.  As a matter of fact I turned it off about 10 minutes into his routine.  Epps is quick to let the audience know that he is only working to earn back the money he'd already spent from his first films- I can't imagine that he's broke but anyway that's not why you're reading this review.  A week went by and I decided to give Epps another chance... He is ignorant as HELL but hilarious.  Definitely not your Rock or Chappelle kind of humor, Epps is straight 'gutter'.  Perhaps that is the reason I was first turned off.  When I attempted to watch the DVD again knowing what to expect I have to tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Yes, Epps is a bit slow at times- and this he admits- but having been forewarned I'm sure you'll too enjoy yourself (especially if you are an Epps fan).  On a final note you get both a DVD and CD for your money.",1173312000,2,898,4.1502890173410405
2440607,1,B000BTGY46,"I was so disappointed with Mike Epps because I love him. I there was a zero star rating thats what this dvd would get. But like someone else said, stand up isn't for everyone. It was horrible I haven't even watched the whole dvd yet. I would go out and buy Katt Williams The Pimp Chronicles instead.",1170288000,,299,4.2631578947368425
2440608,4,B000BTGY46,Mike Epps is really funny and keeps you laughing the whole time.  He is a great comic.,1169078400,,86,4.0588235294117645
2440609,3,B000BTGY46,I AM A HUGE FAN OF MIKE EPPS. I HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF HIS STAND UPS. BEFORE HIS DEBUT IN FRIDAY HE DID A SHOW HERE IN ST. LOUIS THAT WAS SO HILARIOUS. THE NEXT TIME I SEEN HIM IT WAS BEYOND HILARIOUS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR.,1166572800,2,252,3.8653846153846154
2440610,1,B000BTGY46,"Mike Epps is on of my favorite comedienns, but this was TERRIBLE

I think he should stick to doing comedy movies.. Standup is not for everybody

I love mike, But i wouldnt watch this again for free",1161820800,,197,4.297297297297297
2440611,4,B000BTGY46,"If you love Mike Epps, you will love the DVD! He's funny.",1155859200,,57,3.8333333333333335
2440612,4,B000BTGY46,"This is one of the funniest shows Ive seen.  His standup is so on-topic, so real, so very honest that the laughter I found myself sharing with friends was that ""its funny because its true"" not ""funny like Elmer Fudd"" humor.  He discusses without apology or any attempt to hide or disguise the very real racist elements in our society, ""white people, loan a brother something, will you?"" Is a hysterical bit, illustrating not only the white guilt/cant say no, cant collect on outstanding debts issue, but he also hits on what its like if you are a brother and have loaned another black man something - in this case money.  He had me in tears, as this humor - as all good humor does - has its basis in reality.  My own experiences with these issues struck all to close to home.  And the disenfranchisement of black america, the complete and utter disregard of this entire segment of our nation, is delt with in the same direct way.  I guess if you don't find the image of Condi Rice lap dancing for GW Bush while the Pentagon is attacked, the image of GW snorting coke off Condi's body, and his reaction, ""what! what *TIME* did they do it?  When did they do it?  We still had two hours!"" was hysterical.  Or ""George Bush is a Pimp.  He says, ""I don't care if you like me, or voted for me, I am in charge and you will do what I say!""  NOW THAT is Pimp talking!""

I could go on.  Best I dont, as I cant possibly do it justice.  If you are young, democrat, not a republican, have a sense of humor, and find Chris Rock, Robin Williams, David Cross, and Eddie Griffith etc funny, I cant imagine you not liking this.

Jim",1150329600,8,1613,4.259868421052632
