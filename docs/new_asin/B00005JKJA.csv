1481471,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch's Mulholland Drive takes its place on the roadmap of L.A. noirs, right next to Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard and Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Starting with the opening shot of a sleek black limo snaking its way uphill on Mulholland Drive, I found myself riveted to the edge of my seat by this superb film. Mulholland Drive is self-consciously a David Lynch film - he seems to parody himself here as auteur along with other auteurs, notably Fellini, Bergman, and Hitchcock. There were several scenes that had the audience snickering and laughing out loud - in those scenes (my favorite involved a Hoover), Lynch seemed to be aping the Coen Brothers.
There are two femmes fatales, Betty/Diane (Naomi Watts) and Rita/Camilla (Laura Elena Harring). Betty begins her role as a perky starry-eyed blonde  - she has an uncanny resemblance to Tippi Hedren in The Birds - and unravels into a scary psychopath. Sexy brunette Rita wanders in with amnesia and winds up with a blonde wig. There's a movie within the movie, directed by Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux). Characters and caricatures, plots and sub-plots abound, but there's no book here. It's like opening a set of blue lacquered Chinese boxes, each with its own mystery inside.
What I enjoyed most about Mulholland Drive was the sound design by David Lynch. The sound editing was flawless, too. The low-key lighting added a creepy suspenseful touch. The odd camera angles that I expected from Lynch were there, along with icons of the Southland - palm trees, Hollywood sign, dark over-furnished apartments facing in on overgrown courtyards, old over-tanned actors and garishly made-up actresses, house in the hills with pool and view. I got lost on Mulholland Drive, but the sights and sounds were spectacular!",1003363200,26,1769,5.058219178082192
1481472,5,B00005JKJA,"I am so pleased that David Lynch is out there making films. His unique deconstructive approach to storytelling takes an ordinary tale of pristine innocence gone bad and turns into to a multi-layered social commentary of the dark side of society and humanity.
""Mulholland Drive"" at first seems like a very straight forward story that flows like a LA soap opera or a Sirk film. Characters are introduced and appear to be going in very unrelated directions. Some develop and some vanish only to return later on. The two female leads are on an apparent search for the missing identity of 'Rita,' while a young, hot shot director is being manipulated by the LA underground to cast a no-talent in his latest film against his wishes, etc.  When all of a sudden (almost 3/4's in), everything changes. Pandora's Box literally opens and all the ills of mankind spill out for the audience to see. What was stable and familiar to the audience for the last hour and a half is nothing more than a fantasy world projected by a young, wannabe starlet trying to make sense of her life before completely going over the edge. Another victim consumed by the City of Angeles.
""Mulholland Drive"" is yet another powerful tale of the dark and seedy realm that lies underneath the superficial world of innocence and hope. Instead of Lumbertown or Twin Peaks, it takes place in the very 'real' world of LA. Like most of Lynch's films ""Mulholland Drive"" is very a complex, multi-layered psychological mind trip dripping with rich symbolic elements that demands multiple viewings to fully understand what is going on. But once it sinks in, you will be amazed on how comprehensive it is.",1003190400,4,1658,4.7770034843205575
1481473,3,B00005JKJA,"What is the point? Well, no one is really sure (maybe Lynch knows)... but the film seems to be about Hollywood's corruption of innocence and artistic integrity.
Ok, if you'd like to make such a point, why do it in such a convoluted way? Well, apparently David Lynch thinks it's great art to leave the audience confused. That is, to to make a film so surrealistic that there is really no logic, and therefor it leaves critics unable to attack the lack of structure in the story.
It's really a worthless experimental piece. Much like the exploration of jazz music in the 60's that slowly peeled away the structure of music, to the point that one is left with incomprehensible and chaotic noise. Guess what? Random noise is not music ... and incoherent structure is not great art!
Lynch spends a great deal of time developing interesting characters in the first half of the film. A comedic bent is shown with the hit man who has everything go wrong, and with the sinister cowboy Bob. But do these sub-plots go anywhere? No, they don't really... after Rita wakes up muttering ""silencio"", everything in the movie turns into a dream sequence. And all the sub-plots are tied together in a cursory and non-sensical way, as is often the case in a dream.
Does non-sensical dreams make great art? I don't think so ... and neither is this movie.",1003104000,2,1333,4.628691983122363
1481474,4,B00005JKJA,"It's always been a mystery to me how a film director can win a Best Director award for a film and yet the film itself will not be awarded Best Film.  This happened this year at the Cannes Film Festival when David Lynch won for Best Director but ""Mulholland Drive"" did not win the Best Film (Palme D'Or)award. Curious, especially when the Director calls all the shots: screenplay, casting, cinematography, costumes, etc.  It's also interesting to note that ""Mulholland Drive"" had originally been commissioned by ABC TV for viewing on the network...until they saw the finished product, that is.  What did ABC expect?  They had already dealt with Lynch on ""Twin Peaks,"" probably the greatest and strangest TV series ever.  Lynch actually understood and adhered to the drama series format with it's pauses for commercials, etc and formatted ""Twin Peaks"" appropriately. ""Mulholland Drive"" is another kettle of fish, though.  It is brilliant, energetic, sexually explicit, exotic and too long.  What it isn't is..........boring. And this is saying a lot as Lynch taxes your mind as well as your gut. ""Mullholland Drive"" is very much like a great Hitchcock film in that the actors are merely pawns in the propulsion of the plot: Naomi Watts, Laura Herring (ex-Miss Universe), Ann Miller (?) and Justin Theroux are only as effective as Lynch will allow them to be. (Noami Watts is a talent to be reckoned with, though).  The plot itself is non-linear and flashes forward and back and up and down and down and out as is expected from David Lynch.  Don't go to ""Mulholland Drive"" expecting to feel satisfied at the end...because you won't.  What you will feel is challenged, upset, anxious, perplexed and slightly nauseous. You'll have at least a week's worth of water cooler debate fodder. This is a movie for Adults.  All others are hereby warned.",1002844800,6,1839,4.938311688311688
1481475,3,B00005JKJA,"If you're a big fan of linear storytelling, you probably already know to avoid David Lynch films, but here's my warning anyway-- this movie does not have a completely coherent plot.  It tricks you too, because it does make sense for about the first two-thirds.
Be that as it may, I thought this film was still a lot of fun.  Naomi Watts gives a stellar performance as Betty, an aspiring starlet on her first visit to Los Angeles, who develops a friendship with a mysterious amnesia victim played by Laura Elena Harring.  Harring's a bit vacant as an actor, as is Justin Theroux, who plays a young film director struggling to understand why production on his latest film has been shut down.  I'm guessing they were directed to deliver their lines in such a flat way, but the two aren't quite skilled enough to pull this off in a manner that holds the audience's interest.
All quibbles aside, there are some genuinely hilarious moments in this movie (check out the cameo by a certain one-hit-wonder country singer), and these serve as a nice counterpoint to the suspense that gradually builds throughout.  Angelo Badalamenti's music is haunting, as always, and I agree with my fellow reviewer who praised the sound design.
On the whole, it's not my favorite Lynch movie, but it's definitely in the better half of his canon.  I would have loved to see it as a tv show.",1001548800,8,1365,4.666666666666667
1481476,5,B00005JKJA,"The young and beautiful but naive Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) leaves her home in Ontario for Hollywood and immediately finds herself mixed up with a mysterious amnesiac woman who calls herself Rita (Laura Harring).  Betty has come to tinseltown hoping to become an actress, and, while trying to help Rita recover her identity, Betty crosses paths with film director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux).  Slowly a bizarre love triangle unfolds between the three characters, and Betty finds herself in an inescapable nightmare that may just be of her own making.
After his surprisingly successful experiment with sentimental American heartland drama in ""The Straight Story,"" director David Lynch returns with panache to the psycho-surreal territory he has claimed as his own.  ""Mulholland Drive"" creates a new neighborhood in Lynchville bordered closely by ""Fire Walk With Me"" and ""Lost Highway,"" and echoes of those two films are heard throughout ""Mulholland Drive.""  Here are eerie archetypal messengers, an illusionist, mysterious puzzles and keys,  an inexplicable corpse, malignant evil, and the most terrifying of dreams.
Lynch's cast is, as usual, excellently suited to the strange goings-on.  The three leads give subtly nuanced performances and are surrounded at all times by a number of excellent supporting actors.  Dan Hedaya and Robert Forster have very small parts, as do Michael J. ""Twin Peaks"" Anderson, Ann Miller (a veteran of old Hollywood), and Lynch's longtime musical collaborator Angelo Badalamenti--but all of them add a wonderful spice to their scenes.  Richard Green as the Magician and Layfayette Montgomery as the Cowboy both create defining and unforgettable Lynch characters.
Two other spectacular features of the film bear mentioning.  First is the soundtrack, which does a great deal to enhance the film's mood, from Badalamenti's typically brooding numbers and supporting tunes by Lynch and John Neff to the heartrending performance of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" sung in Spanish,  a capella, by Rebekah Del Rio.  Second is the delicious non-linear plot, evoking inevitable associations with ""Lost Highway.""  Anyone who had trouble with ""Lost Highway,"" however, should not stay away from ""Mulholland Drive.""  While one cannot promise that ""Mulholland Drive"" will be easier to swallow, comparing the two films will certainly do much to illuminate the exquisite madness of Lynch's method.",1001376000,27,2402,5.512261580381471
1481477,5,B00005JKJA,"Ever since ""Eraserhead"" David Lynch has the notorious reputation of being the king of weird and the paranormal. Mulholland Drive just adds more icing to the cake as once again he tinkers with our mind and takes us so far passed the line that we forgot what it looked like. I caught Mulholland Drive at the Toronto international film fest and liked it alot. While it does take a good half hour to really get into it, after that your hooked. Naomi Watts performance deserves an Oscar nod if I ever saw one. If you were to close your eyes her performance would still blow you out of the water. However, where Lynch still shines bright is in the sound department. He's always been good with it and has made it his top priority but this soundtrack will be a must buy.
So if you like your Lynch raw and gritty, take Mulholland Drive into consideration. You won't regret it.",1001203200,10,867,4.425
1481478,5,B00005JKJA,"I'll make this very short.
The film is brilliant, and it's everything you would expect David Lynch to make.  It's intelligent, beautiful and it incorporates every genre in one.  Many people will not ""get it"" and the people who do will love the heck out of it.  If you like Wild at Heart or Blue Velvet, or anything else that Mr. Lynch has done, go out and see the movie when it hits theatres.  There is only one David Lynch, and there will never be another artist of his calibre.  He is a genius.
I just want to address a complaint I read in other reviews.  The movie does NOT play like a cancelled television pilot, and everything makes perfect sense with a bit of thought.  Every character serves his/her purpose.
If you know of David Lynch's work, you know that he has an amazing sense of what is ""cool"".  The music, dialogue and environments used in this film are totally David Lynch.  You won't hear dialogue like this from any other director, because only someone as intelligent as David Lynch could or would speak like this.  It works in this film, as it worked in Hotel Room, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet and Lost Highway.",999993600,13,1128,4.432038834951456

If I hadn't rented this before I saw the Horrific Non-ending of Twin Peaks season 3, I would Never have wasted my money! As it was, I waited until the last possible day to watch it, and almost didn't. Wondering why Lynch likes to leave viewers confused, up in the air and completely unsatisfied.

1481576,2,B00005JKJA,"Although Mulholland Drive starts off pretty well and is somewhat interesting at the start, with a rich woman about to be murdered who is saved by some drunk teen hoons on a mountain, who then stumbles down the hill into suburbia where she sneaks into a unit complex and is discovered by Naomi Watt's character when she arrives at her aunt (who is away)'s unit to try and make it in Hollywood as an actress. It becomes confusing and a frustrating watching experience after that.  I got the version (region 4 DVD) with two discs, the second DVD being a bunch of extras, and the first extra you get is a French look at the film interviewing Americans (so spoken English, French subtitles) where everyone says they don't understand the film, one guy even claims to have seen it 47 times and still has no idea what happened.  Another extra has the director telling us only the last couple of scenes were reality, the rest of the movie before that was just various fantasies.  Maybe watch the extras first and the put the movie DVD in your player, otherwise you're just going to be confused.

Saying that Naomi Watts does some brilliant acting in this.  The audition scene alone has a lot of dialogue to remember and looks like it was done in one shot.  Can't her or the other actors, it's those who made the film who could have done a better job.",1507939200,,1341,4.475409836065574

1481579,5,B00005JKJA,"No, you won't quite know ""what's going on"" here, and if that's what you expect out of your entertainment, then avoid all of David Lynch's oeuvre. My my humble opinion, Lynch reaches peak artistic weirdness with Mulholland Dr., sort of a surreal, magical realism-esque Pulp Fiction. The movie refuses to settle into one tone, lurching from dark comedy (watch for the scene with a man who kills someone only to have to kill two more innocent witnesses who stumble upon the scene, and then who accidentally sets off the fire alarm) to horror (is there anything creepier than Naomi Watts committing suicide as an elderly couple cackle at her?) to everything in between.",1505088000,,665,4.893805309734513

1481633,5,B00005JKJA,MULHOLLAND DRIVE (2001) had me on the hook the first two times that I watched the film. Lynch had baffled me before but this story was so rich and so lean while capturing the tone of the Hollywood that I do wished to have lived in that I kept wanting to learn and to feel more and as the ending approached I felt certain that I was set to get what I desired . . . right up until the last twenty minutes began. In twists crueler to the audience than to the characters in the story MULHOLLAND DRIVE teaches that the illusion is not made to bend to the will of the audience but rather that the audience must bend to the will of the illusion. And so I have again and again. That the ending is bewildering and nearly (nearly) unsatisfying is secondary to what is great about the film. For his work on MULHOLLAND DRIVE David Lynch was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director even though the film was not nominated for Best Picture. That foreshadows accurately the experience that is in store. Recommended.,1501804800,2,1009,4.343915343915344

It requires an attention to detail and thoughtful analysis that most movies won't dare to even try. Even if you don't ""get it"" (as I certainly didn't the first time) it's still an enjoyable dark and twisted tale with classic themes. Love, hope, jealousy, betrayal and revenge.

1481710,1,B00005JKJA,"I hated this film upon watching it, but I struggled to think exactly why. Technically, I think it should be at least a decent film because of its unique structure, but something about it was so off-putting.

About 2/3 to 3/4 of the film is all just the protagonist's imagination. She is putting herself in the place of her lover. So it isn't the cliche ""it was all a dream and meant nothing"" but then again, it also was; there are parts of this film that leave you scratching your head until the credits when you realize they never will be explained. For the majority of the time you are watching it, this film messes with you, making you think it is about something it isn't. The main story might take just 30 minutes without everything else in between.

And this leads me to what I finally realized makes me dislike this film. I watched for so long bored out of my mind until near the end when everything changed and I was supposed to just accept it I guess? But I could not. The film itself comes across as pretentious. As if not liking it means I don't understand. The thing is, I understand the story and still cannot stand it.

Maybe it just isn't my kind of film, but I think that for anyone who doesn't like ""art films,"" this is especially not for you. I generally enjoy ""art films"" and especially love surrealism, but I couldn't stand Mulholland Dr.",1486252800,4,1358,4.380952380952381

When you  understand the gimmick, that is when the apartment literally changes into a different one about 2/3 of the way through, then you see that everything that came before that--after the crash-- is a reverie, hallucination, or dream, whatever you want to call it.

Ingmar Bergman made some excellent films with two  or more women as the leads, like Persona and Cries and Whispers. But this film is just very shallow psychologically and it tries to cover that up with portentous apparatus, as in the worst of Bertolucci. And as in those films, it all comes to so little.  But American films have become so bad, that, as with Heaven's Gate, there seems to be  movement to try and elevate this thing to high status. This tells us a lot about both the state of American films and the poverty of American film criticism today.
It was bombastic, and arty in the worst sense.  And  underneath artiness, there is always the whiff of stupidity.",1478563200,,1039,4.701657458563536

1481883,1,B00005JKJA,"This movie reminds me of one of Pollack's splatter paintings. You know the paintings the ""artist"" himself doubted as actually being art. I believe I know how this movie was made. The story was written in a  sequitur manner then chopped up into bits; then the bits put in  bowl; then the bits were drawn from the bowl and glued together in the order drawn. Sure, there had to be some control over where the bits went so that it wasn't completely rubbish; but essentially it is a movie made in the style of picking pieces of it randomly from a bowl. No genius here, just gimmick. As a sequitur story it is not even interesting; actually rather unimaginative. In the end it is like Pollack's splatter paintings--it is a bunch of splatter about which one can assign meaning after meaningless meaning ad nauseum.",1476230400,,807,4.597222222222222

From the force of the impact, she suffers a concussion and amnesia afterwards. She has no memory of who she is and wanders off into a vacant, munificent apartment. Betty (aka Diane - Naomi Watts) is in the process of moving into the apartment when she discovers this beautiful but child-like occupant hiding there. Betty suspects Rita is in some sort of danger and wants to help her regain her bearings. Betty searches through Rita's belongings with her permission to try and find her identity. Instead, they find a stash, bundles of cash which Rita has no clue as to why she has it. A friendship and innocent romance blossoms as Rita slowly regains her memory. Later, Rita, to Betty's dismay, recovers her full faculties and is no longer dependent on Betty's nurturance. Betty even becomes furious when she is made privy and sees that Rita has taken another lover, replacing her.

It's often also referred to as film noir; I agree that it has definite noir characteristics, but imho it is far too surreal, too inexplicable, to be put in that category.  There is no crime that gets solved, mystery that gets resolved, good guys or bad guys getting what they deserve, justice exacted by someone or by fate, etc.

Viewers who are receptive to such a movie should, I think, find this one to be one of the best.  Many critics have said that it's David Lynch's best; for me I think it's somewhere very near his Blue Velvet, which is easier to understand but not as weirdly beautiful.

One gets the impression that it is not a cheap, gimmicky mystery but rather it is somehow coherent and that makes it open to rewatchings and discussion. It is like a jigsaw puzzle you cannot finish, because it seems like pieces are missing from it, but you later come back and find there are few more and fit them in.

1482473,1,B00005JKJA,"I would normally flag this as containing spoilers, but although I talk about events in the film here, they're not spoiling anything because each of these events are irrelevant to the plot.  The very weak plot is surrounded by nonsensical, inconcluded events that seemingly will attach to the main plot at some point, but never do, so talking about them can't possibly spoil the ending.  The only real spoiler is this: the main plot doesn't actually have a conclusion at all.

I saw the ratings and figured it must turn around by the end, bringing all of the confusing events to a close.  There isn't even a theory that comes close to explaining what was on the screen.  I even went and read fan theories and reviews to try to understand what made this movie good.  The first 3/4 of the movie is fairly ordinary as we gather a handful of people and evidence as it all looks like it's coming together into one coherent explanation... the movie seems fairly ""realistic,"" with minimal supernatural or unrealistic components at all, then suddenly there are (I am not kidding) little people crawling through the gap under the door!  This is then followed by a handful of other events entirely uncharacteristic of the world that was built by the first 3/4 of the movie.

It's just another one of the movies from the early 2000s that showed a handful of difficult to explain events as if they're a great mystery, and in the end, the character was just dissociating, dead, delusional, in a simulation, etc, etc.  Even though most of these movies failed in making you go ""Oh I didn't see that"" at the end, this one is THE ABSOLUTE WORST.

1482673,2,B00005JKJA,"Like the foulest cheese or the most experimental jazz, this oddball movie will only be enjoyed by aficionados with either very distinct or indiscriminate tastes for the bizarre and illogical. While Lynch is often lauded for his stylish weirdness, this particular work fits right into his usual oeuvre of quirky, tense, pseudo-thriller/horror films chockfull of reality-bending strangeness and delusional lunatics. Defenders of the film try to define the logic of the film with various cheats like dreams, insanity, and demons, but it is still a mismatched mash of ideas.

This particular entry features some light meditations on identity and celebrity, but most of the legwork is left to the viewer to make sense of its nightmarishly incongruent scenes. One can respect any original efforts from increasingly bland Hollywood filmmaking, but the final efforts are sloppy and mismatched, subsisting on tone and feel over any coherent logical structure. Also, while the movies sound and lighting are laudable, the film otherwise has the production value of cable porn, featuring the typical hallmarks of stiff dialog, stagnant camera work, and bad overacting.

There are a few quality moments that successfully elicit fear and tension from the viewer, but otherwise the filmmaker is content to allow for odd and oblique dialog and actions to constitute the substance of the film. A viewer will either enjoy the abstract/avant-garde non-sequiturs or be grossly perturbed by them.",1429747200,2,1475,5.408695652173913

1482708,5,B00005JKJA,"One of my favorite movies of all time.  Naomi Watts delivers one of the best performances ever.  She plays two distinct characters, and with so much aplomb.  She is diabolical to the extreme in each one.

Everything about this film is deceptive.  From the jitterbug at the opening to the dark abrupt closing.  I've delved into explanations, and read critiques of the film, which provided me some comfort in understanding the film.  Regardless of how baffled I initially was, I was enchanted, enraptured, and amazed throughout.  The film is that engrossing.

How deceptive is Betty!  So innocent but she wants to be an actress, and she delivers one of the most seductive hottest auditions ever.  Her connection with the director Adam Kesher/Justin Theroux is one of the sexiest things I've ever seen.  Their eyes catch; they are hooked; each senses the connection, and neither can look away.  There is something blaring in the background, but only the two of them exist.  No words are spoken  it is just their eyes, and the screen just oozed heat.

The songs are so good, and Naomi Watt's performance as Betty is beyond amazing.  Probably the best of the year, and how she was not even nominated for an Academy Award was a travesty.  Yes, Halle Berry gave a solid performance in Monster's Ball, but it was nowhere as nuanced and complex as what Naomi Watts's delivered in Mulholland Dr.  I actually feel that Halle Berry, as a glamorous Hollywood star, was awarded for just being credible.  Halle Berry was very good, but I found her performance inconsistent and without much depth.  Naomi Watts did not miss a subtle beat.  She added layers to her character.  From her passion to Rita, to her predatory pounce on Camilla Rhodes to even seducing Adam Kesher.

I love David Lynch's baffling, pointed touches, and the way he directed the film.  This film is an absolute masterpiece, and I was hooked from beginning to end.  Yes, it is confusing and strange, but it was absorbing, engrossing, and totally fascinating to watch.

1482792,5,B00005JKJA,"After living in LA for two years as a struggling musician who dabbled in background work, acting, and other sectors of the entertainment world, I can humbly say that this film holds a close place to my heart... it reminds me to never take ""making it"" too seriously. Basically, if you make it: awesome. If you don't make it: congratulate yourself for trying.

I've read over 100 Amazon reviews about this movie now. Many go into great detail about their thoughts and the meaning of the film. However, each review forgets to mention one of the most essential aspects of the film: the ending, which has the affluent female spectator (dubbed as the ""Blue-Haired Lady"" in the credits) sitting in the upper-balcony of Club Silencio looking down at the stage whispering ""Silencio"" (""be quiet"" in Spanish). This enigmatic ending to Mulholland Dr. solidifies an overarching theme that keeps getting missed in reviews. Although the film is open to interpretation that has confused a lot of people (reports even state that the film was hurried and created on the fly as they were filming) they edited it with a tangible plot that ends at Club Silencio for a reason.

When people think ""Hollywood"" they tend to think ""glitz and glam."" Of course, if you live in Hollywood or just pass through it a few times, you'd know that Hollywood is a dirty, broken-down, and even dangerous town (along with several other parts of LA). As you move further West, it cleans up with hints of a Third World nation sprouting here and there. As you move North up the hill, LA suddenly turns into luxury at its finest, and there are only a select few wealthy enough to make a living around Mulholland Dr.

*Spoiler Alert*
After Lynch shows us Diane's real world of not making it, she breaks down into disillusionment and kills herself. The movie transitions into nostalgic imagery of the city, of Diane, and of Camille glowing like ghosts who've passed away... we see them with looks of innocence, starry-eyes, and laughter, almost as if they've forgiven each other for all the pain and suffering they caused each other; they are the once-beautiful souls Lynch wants us to remember them by rather than the heartless competitors that they turned into.

Soon, the film crossfades into a matching blue aura that transitions from Diane's ending to Club Silencio's stage and the glowing mic (remember: ""it's all just a tape""). The blue aura is like a mirage suggesting that the entire film preceding the blue aura has been a mirage/tape/recording/illusion the whole time. We are brought to the present at Club Silencio with the Blue-Haired Lady (visibly distraught and almost breaking the fourth wall) looking down at the stage whispering ""Silencio"" in a very trance-like state.

What does this ending mean? At first I didn't get it, but after living in LA submerged in the entertainment industry for awhile, I get it now: the Blue-Haired Lady is telling us (the audience/spectators/the world) to be silent about the horror we just saw, a.k.a. the dark side of LA, otherwise, Hollywood would lose it's mega-star appeal. If people knew just how messed up of a town LA can be, then it'd look more like the ghoul behind Winkie's. If everyone saw the hidden parts of LA for what it can truly be, then Hollywood and its global draw that fuels the sense of hope and success it personifies would be lost, which is the same hope and success Diane fantasizes and daydreams about throughout the movie. Hence, it's a part of Hollywood's culture to sweep the madness under the rug and to be quiet about the countless failed attempts at stardom, like that of Diane's tragic ending, which helps keep the whole party going. Keep in mind that LA is a ""transient"" town where every year tens of thousands of people come in and out of LA trying to make their dreams a reality. Inevitably, a vast majority won't make the cut. To an extent, we are all audience members of Club Silencio just like the Blue-Haired Lady, many of us are unaware of its own subtle propaganda and its nature to keep us silent: we quietly watch other people's story unfold as other's watch our own story unfold -- reality is relative and how much of our life is real versus illusion (or ""maya"") is at times debatable --  just who is truly pulling the strings and who isn't is part of the illusion that many people will find themselves struggling with as they try to create success in their own life.

All in all, Mulholland Dr. is as uplifting as it is tragic. The fact that Naomi Watts has publicly stated that she can relate to the struggle of her character in the film after trying to build her success in LA and film for years makes it that much more special of a production.",1424044800,15,4697,4.6860606060606065
1482793,5,B00005JKJA,"Some of the other reviews on this film try to sort out this puzzle on Amazon, and they do such a good job that I will not repeat their analysis. Let me just say that this is a work of genius of a master filmmaker who is not afraid to run separately from the Hollywood pack and actually challenge his viewers. Never expect easy answers from David Lynch, only an original experience that will have you thinking and talking for a long time after you see it -- however many times you see it.

For me, there cannot be too many times. Don't waste your time with LOST HIGHWAY or INLAND EMPIRE but reward yourself with this demanding work of cinematic art.

After TWIN PEAKS ended, Lynch made a prequel of the TV show in the form of a theatrical film. It was somewhat disappointing, making one wish that he would make a true sequel to TWIN PEAKS as a cable film or another theatrical film. Too many elements were left hanging. In MULHOLLAND DRIVE.you might find yourself wishing he would make a sequel here.",1423872000,2,999,4.394594594594595

1482796,5,B00005JKJA,"While happening upon a copy of David Lynch's ""Lost Highway,"" my interest piqued in the peculiar director's films after watching that film and a Netflix binge marathon of ""Twin Peaks."" I'd seen some of the director's other movies, most notably ""Dune,"" which I've heard called the ""runt of the Lynch litter,"" and of course ""Eraserhead,"" but it wasn't until watching ""Lost Highway"" that I decided to sit down and give ""Mulholland Drive"" another chance. I had tried watching it once about ten years ago, when I was seventeen or eighteen and I remember not 'getting' it and giving up about fifteen or twenty minutes in. But now, ten years and hundreds of movies watched later I got to look at it with a fresh approach.

I'm not going to describe the plot, if you're reading this review, chances are you already know what the movie is about: Weird goings on in Los Angeles. On a sidenote, this movie is the second in David Lynch's ""Los Angeles Trilogy,"" which is comprised of ""Lost Highway,"" this film ""Mulholland Drive"" and the finale ""Inland Empire."" Of the plot, I will say this: upon finishing the film, I was shocked at the similarities this film shares with Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction."" Now, it's not a rip-off of ""Pulp Fiction,"" or even an homage to Tarantino, in fact, I think it's quite the opposite, I think this whole film is David Lynch's way of criticizing Quentin Tarantino-- here's why:

Justin Theroux's character, Adam, a film director, dresses in a similar manner to QT, so much to the point that his hair is even done up like the man's. The true nature of the film within the film he's working on is never revealed, but the character's countenance and demeanour is so evenly parallel with Tarantino that I found it hard to ignore. The second thing I noticed about this film was that it was unusually chatty for a Lynch movie. I think the only other David Lynch movies this talky are ""Dune"" and ""Fire, Walk With Me,"" but with ""Mulholland Drive"" the dialogue is witty and sticks in your head unlike other David Lynch movies where the focus is on the scenery and symbolism. Quentin Tarantino is heralded for his dialogue and David Lynch usually tells his stories with imagery, not words. But in the scene where Adam meets the Cowboy, the dialogue is so unusually sharp that I found myself thinking I was watching another movie by an entirely different filmmaker at the moment.

Then there's the other, more common similarities, the movie has bookends in a cheap greasy diner with two characters talking, the focus is shifting around a lot between characters in a similar manner to ""Pulp Fiction"" and it's told out of order, in a non-linear manner very similar to Tarantino's style. Of course it's still filled with Lynch's bizarre symbolism, the old folk, the tape recorded theatre, arching lights flickering to life and far more sexual imagery than even Quentin Tarantinto is usually comfortable with, but Lynch is definitely trying to say something if not about QT than about Hollywood and filmmaking in general, the latter is fairly obvious, but for some reason I put two and two together and got Tarantino out of the equation.

The DVD has English subtitles, which is good, because most of the characters in the movie mumble and you'll find yourself rewinding to understand what they said. The special features are practically non-existent, just some information on the cast and crew and the theatrical trailer. That's okay, though. I definitely liked the movie a whole lot, which is more than I can say for my impatient eighteen year old self. I know I sound like a broken record, but ""Mulholland Drive"" feels like a psychological horror thriller version of ""Pulp Fiction"" and frankly I think that's a really cool idea and that it was executed very well by David Lynch.

1482873,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive might be Lynch's masterpiece. It is an opaque--although not as incomprehensible as Lost Highway--drama about the soul-sucking region of Los Angeles known as Hollywood. In it, a young actress ventures to Hollywood to carve out a career as an actress. She stumbles upon a mysterious woman with amnesia who calls herself Rita. They begin a quest to discover ""Rita's"" identity. This is a Lynch film, though, so there are plenty of quirky characters and bizarre scenes. Later, the film shifts, and the viewer is forced to question what came before. Perhaps the splendid dream of stardom is more of a tragic nightmare. You decide. Watch it once for the amazing cinematography. Watch it again for the wonderful performance by Naomi Watts. And watch it a third time to try to unravel the mystery.

1482876,5,B00005JKJA,"This review is for the more casual movie-goer who doesn't necessarily want to make a study of a film or fit it into a director's larger oeuvre, but who wants entertainment and an emotional experience. As hard to figure out as ""Mulholland Drive"" is sometimes, it really delivers on that score.

I'm grateful to other reviewers who have lived with this film for a while and have sorted out what might be its its dream inclusions, its chronology, the identity of its characters, and its overall plot and meaning. Many of those who have analyzed this film in that way have found it to be a masterpiece. However, even if you are like me and generally don't want to exert yourself making sense of a movie, you're still likely to find this one's scenes individually memorable and mesmerizing.

Just to cite a few scenes that I found unforgettable: There's Naomi Watts' character's two renditions of her audition reading. Her first practice reading in her apartment is well-done and engaging, but it's a rather straightforward reading of rather banal material. However, her second, presumably at-the-casting-offices reading with Chad Everett, adds a breath-taking erotic twist of interpretation to the words. There was a hint of interpreting such a conventionally scripted scene in that way in the 1940's movie Gilda. But this more sustained reading gives the viewer time to be drawn into such a possibility of meaning the opposite of what you say. This scene should be required viewing in every acting class. It will open aspiring actors up to the possibility of new levels of meaning in any script.

The scene in the all-night vaudeville theater is heart-breaking, and offers a telling philosophical view of the nature of life and illusion.

Virtually every scene is a glittering gem in its own way, so you don't need to care exactly why they are strung together the way they are to make this a worthwhile experience. Even the more prosaic scenes, such as the early one showing two men chatting in a diner, the one man narrating his frightening dream to the other  are so steeped in some larger atmosphere of menace and amazement, that they are riveting. They give the initial impression of being set in the real, everyday world, but as you get into them, you are overcome with a sense of being in some bizarro, mirror-image reflection of everyday life.

It amazingly captures the fear many of us might have of that cheery, apple-dumpling, seemingly encouraging grandmotherly figure in our lives. It intimates we might have reason to suspect that behind that facade, there's a character of ghastly malevolence.

Hardly anything could be more menacing than the soft-spoken, matter-of-fact cowboy who arranges a meeting at night in an old corral outside of town with its guttering light bulb over the ranch gate. You are left with an inner quaking apprehension that no mere gun threats could effect when the cowboy says, If you do good, you will see me one more time. If you do bad, you will see me two more times.

If any movie could convert me from being a casual movie-goer to a student of film, this would be the one to do it. It inspires me to want to see it over and over and more deeply each time. It is magnificent.",1419724800,,3215,4.76978417266187

I tend to be a literal, left-brain person, don't necessarily ""get"" symbolism and allegory immediately, often takes me considerable reflection and repeated viewings to get it.  Somehow I hadn't seen Mulholland Drive, and hadn't heard anything about it.  But a few weeks ago I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-From-Titov-Veles/dp/B00GG1QH6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am From Titov Veles</a>&nbsp;(IAFTV), a  haunting, surreal, VERY sensual film focusing on the life and inner realities of Afrodita, one of three Macedonian sisters, which I loved, and got immediately.  It's about the allure and value of escaping into fantasies and dreams, but as in Mulholland Drive, there are also nightmares and potent, disturbing imagery.  And the cinematography is spectacular, from the smallest of details to cobblestone streets to shots of a far-off, unreachable sea.

I saw Mulholland Drive after this, and though I still went online and read people's interpretations of the film, I think I got it MUCH better after having seen IAFTV, it primed the symbolic pump.  Unlike Mulholland Drive, ***SPOILER ALERT*** in which the entire film is from one character's POV, IAFTV also shows what's ""actually"" occurring.  One is rarely afforded such a rich and complementary view of events and a person's interpretation of them, how events and circumstances became transposed in a person's imagination and guide subsequent, often bizarre behavior- no small feat to do, especially seamlessly so.  (Labina Mitevska, who plays Afrodita, reminds me very much of Nastassja Kinski in her sensuality and physicality.)  If you like Mulholland Drive I'll bet you'll also like I Am From Titov Velez- it too operates on a nearly subliminal level.

Mulholland Drive, like IAFTV, reveals the depths and range of human experience, though it isn't until later you realize that MD inheres almost entirely in the mind of one character, and is non-linear (out of chronological order), revealing- in a kaleidoscopic fashion- the mercurial nature and fragility of one person's psychological integrity as fortunes change from one precarious moment to the next. How many shattered/thwarted dreams can such a person endure?

If you like dramas that lay bare others' experience of the world and the workings of troubled minds, especially through the use of POTENT imagery and symbolism, you'll love this, though there's SO much going on that like me you may want to see it more than once.

Mulholland Dr. (2001) is a David Lynch movie that has a story/plot that is kind of hard to follow, but for me the most important thing when it comes to this movie is that it's kind of bizarre, twisted, and offbeat - three qualities that I like in movies occasionally.  This movies stars Naomi Watts, Laura Elena Harring, Justin Theroux, Ann Miller, and Robert Forster.  The acting is great, especially by Watts and Harring.  I've always liked Naomi Watts, so it's a huge bonus that she's in this movie and gives a really great and bold performance on top of it.  This movie screams David Lynch - the camera angles, soundtrack, eroticism, twisted plot, stunning visuals, danger, etc.  The early part of the movie (the accident) reminds me of the beginning of Carnival Of Souls (1962).  If you've seen that movie, you'll know what I'm talking about.  This movie might be an acquired taste for some people, but for me it grabbed me immediately for all of the above reasons.  Definitely a classic in my book.  No matter what, this movie will stay with you (good or bad) after you see it.

It clocks in at 2 hours, 27 minutes.

It's quite a shame that this film wasn't a box office hit, though it was profitable. I'm guessing that people only like easily assimilated plots these days. I found this film to be extremely enjoyable, despite being hard to follow at times. Naomi Watts gives a spectacular performance in her first real opportunity in the movie business; she was very believable in her role, as was Laura Elena Harring. These two ladies have remarkable chemistry- for verification, see around the 1 hour and 40 minute mark! Overall, Mulholland Drive is David Lynch at his best.

1483166,5,B00005JKJA,"Although it disappeared fairly quickly when it was released in 2001, David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" has grown in critical stature over the years and is now seen as one of the key films of the 2000s. Both a neo-noir and a surrealist nightmare, the film features Naomi Watts as an aspiring young Canadian actress who comes to Los Angeles hoping to break into movies and Laura Harring as a mysterious amnesiac brunette who turns up in her apartment and who might spell danger. Related (or not) to this is another story concerning an arrogant director (Justin Theroux) who imperils his film and his life after he refuses to cast an actress chosen by a mysterious power broker (or mafioso, or whomever).

Lynch has consistently refused to explain what this film is about. Throughout there are asides that appear to have little relation to the main storylines - a botched hit job, a recounting of a nightmare set in a diner, an eerie club that the two women visit for reasons unknown. And, at about the two hour mark, the film pulls a dramatic shift that up-ends everything we've seen to that point. Yet the film's opacity never becomes off-putting; instead, it pulls us even further into its mysteries. As the late Roger Ebert put it, this is the one Lynch film where he doesn't overload the circuits, he maintains a smooth, assured control for all of its short 147 minutes.

The film is a deserved critical darling but not really a popular favorite, unlike Lynch's ""Twin Peaks"" or ""Blue Velvet."" (And Lynch himself hasn't been too active in features lately; he's made only one film since, the maddening ""Inland Empire."") But ""Mulholland Drive"" certainly merits a far better release than the bare-bones DVD that Universal put out twelve years ago. The transfer is good but doesn't really bring out the sumptuous color scheme that Lynch devised for the film's first part. A Criterion restoration would not only do this film justice but also increase its visibility. Some may dismiss it as pretentious drivel, but for me at least this film has a spell to it that keeps beguiling me to re-watch it. It's an epic song about the dark side of Hollywood, and Watts and Harring are its two stunning sirens. This great film deserves to stand among such other modernist masterworks as ""Persona"" and ""Belle de Jour"" in its ability to intrigue and engage us the more perplexing it gets.",1398988800,3,2371,4.766423357664234

1483282,5,B00005JKJA,"I wrote same review on IMDB - thought it'd be worth it to post here as well.

First things first: This Movie is a must see - Even if you hate it afterwards. The story of Mulholland Drive is built and woven with layers. Each layer when peeled off takes viewers a step closer to the conception of ""truth"" or perceived truth.

When watching this movie, one must be very very careful in not judging it at first by simply viewing it at face value, if you do so, you'll be surely disappointed and be scratching your head over what you just witnessed. Every scene, every moment, every act(s) is a consequence of previous act for sure, but also has deeper layers (deeper causes), To describe the layer/deeper causal example in a practical way: if you were driving on the street and suddenly a bank robber stops you and gives you a 100$ note and you gleefully accept his generosity because you are in dire need to do so, is the cause of your glee bank robber giving 100$ bill, or his insidious agenda to take money away from someone and make others happy? or is it simply play of events and its a coincidence and your ""luck"" that caused all of it; Or is it that you drove on the street hoping that perhaps today is the day when someone will come and help you since you are dire need... As we can probably make out that there are different sides, different causes of a simple event, how we perceive such events and are affected by it is what makes our reality. Like if we go in even further, what motivates us to act or participate in the event and affect our own reality?

Mulholland drive is a that confusing road that leads to nowhere until some agent flushes our misperceptions and takes us to the ""higher truth"" whatever it be using a secret path, and perhaps when all of it plays out, our illusion gets over. To all viewers, I won't talk further in riddles, but there are some important elements you need to consider when you watch this movie:

1. Each segment is important, so be careful to watch and let it run through your minds.

2. This movie relates and centers around a woman and what goes on in her mind, and beyond the conjured up world. Understand that sometimes thoughts running in mind are hard to describe in their physical sense of meaning so a lot of expression that comes out in the movie maybe hard at first to fathom, but movie is clearly able to distinguish between: correct, incorrect, devoid of thought patterns (blankness)/deep sleep, imaginary(hallucinatory) and memories. Not only that sometimes colorings of thoughts, our state mind (one-pointed, dullness etc.) are very hard to describe in their physical counterparts: movie to some extent is able to put that forward as well.

3. Movie centers around how other characters spun out from the woman's mind and how she ""feels"" about those characters (this can be far from truth), characters like betty or Rita or characters like ""the girl"" for example. (No Spoilers for you guys reading this and have come this far).

4. Movie can be complete but still incomplete - that is how mind works and there is a limitation on how all things/patterns fit together based on observer and what is being observed and what are the colorings of the thought stream that have been witnessed thus far.

5. Movie has some sexual acts that some may find disturbing, but again its mind field, in the world of mind-field anything is possible, we all have fantasies, we all have hallucinations, we all have objects of affections.

Many of the elements seem apparent but they really have deeper meaning to them, like ""It is an illusion ..."" or Silencio... at the end. Overall I would say, this movie requires a lot of patience to understand and grasp, if you are looking for pop-corn drama, go watch inception or some other flick that gives you just that, there's a lot of those out there (nothing against those as well, they are fantastic but they are too apparent and too easy to follow). Movie often is like life - it can be as easy as you make it to be, or as hard as you make it out to be... Overall a fantastic value for money.",1390348800,2,4078,4.492577597840755

The minimum wage rack filler in charge that night refused to rent me the DVD.  He had even cleared all the copies from the racks and was holding them in the back room.  There was no way he was going to rent this -- by his assessment the worst movie ever made -- to me or anyone else in the Garden State.  He was actually angry about the film's existence.  Why?  He was adamant that there was absolutely no story to be had in the whole film.  The movie was just a jumble of disjointed and pointless images and vignettes meaning absolutely nothing.  The whole thing was obviously some sick Hollywood freak's practical joke on America -- stealing 2 hours from all our lives for a tossed garbage salad, 2 hours of precious life we would never get back.  In his opinion, director David Lynch should be prosecuted post haste.  The overwrought clerk finally agreed to let me have a copy at no charge.  If I could, upon the morrow upon returning the movie, relate to him any shred of story, plot or meaning in the mess, he would put the movie back out on the racks.  In the morning I told him:  It's a sardonic black-humored modern update of ""The Wizard of Oz"" with Wendy being a wannabe actress in Hollywood.  A car accident on Mulholland is the ""tornado"" that kicks off her extended ""moment-before-death-by-suicide"" (the Ambrose Bierce ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" construct) moment of her hallucinating the ""reasons"" for her not becoming the hottest new movie star in town.  The hallucinatory narrative goes back and forth between the true ""reality"" of her failure (she's a mediocrity, not particularly talented, special or connected) and her wounded ""alibi"": She imagines she has been sabotaged by dark forces of both movie industry and possibly supernatural variety actively conspiring against her.  In a weird way, this movie is a far more ""realistic"" fictional documentary of how dreams are sucked to a dry desiccated death by the Hollywood machine than other more conventionally-told cautionary tales.  If viewed through this ""Alternative Oz"" lens, the movie is quite sad, fun and hypnotically watchable.  Well, the Blockbuster clerk would have none of my slick West Coast/L.A. explanation, so the DVDs stayed in the back room -- and New Jersey remained protected from Lynch's evil film assault on logic, rationality and American goodness.

1483593,5,B00005JKJA,"This is one of the (sadly) few films that commands multiple viewings. I won't spoil any of the plot details but it's one of those movies where everything comes together at the very end, practically forcing you to re-watch again and again. I first watched this when I was a pre-teen and rediscovered it last Spring Break. Since then I've seen it about ten times and I still discover new things every time I watch it.

When I re-watched it tonight, I found several new details: a woman asks her neighbor for her hold lamp back (possibly linking her to a web of crime), a man's associated with a cup of coffee at a dinner party (which comes into play earlier in the film). At face value it may not sound like much, but this movie is a wild psychosexual ride through the dreams and desires of a young Hollywood hopeful. Every individual and every detail comes into play and manifests itself in intriguing and significant ways.

What I appreciate so much about this film, and its filmmaker David Lynch especially, is that it rewards multiple viewings. On the surface the movie is two unrelated mini-films, with a handful of cross-references, but you gather more clues and piece together more and more of the puzzle with each additional viewing. I can't pretend I understand Mulholland Drive 100% but I come closer every time I watch it.

Even taking aside the mesmerizing storytelling and unique structure, this movie is nonetheless entertaining and thrilling. It can best be described as a neo-noir thriller, though it is at times terrifying (with the scariest scene I've ever watched, I can't even look at the screen) and heartbreaking. It also has what may be the healthiest and most honest love story I've seen at the movies.

What makes Mulholland Drive so exceptional is its metafictional self-awareness. At its core, it is a mystery involving two women, one grappling with amnesia and the other a rising Hollywood actress. It plays with all the standard Hollywood cues we've seen for decades: the femme fatale, the wide-eyed optimist, the cynical Hollywood elite, and many others; but the way the action plays out distorts the grasp you think you have on the story.

It initially clings to all the rules of Hollywood only to break them halfway through; the film hinges on a haunting scene at a nightclub where the emcee emphasizes that everything they are hearing is a tape recording; it is all an illusion. From this pivotal moment, all bets are off, as the film throttles in a totally different direction and plunging the characters into a gritty and seedy Hollywood underworld and an ultimately tragic conclusion.

This fantastic manipulation with the audience's expectations and the immeasurable depth of the colorful Hollywood the characters reside in bring me back to this movie every month or so. I can never turn down another trip up Mulholland Drive.",1369440000,4,2861,4.840490797546012
1483594,5,B00005JKJA,"If you have seen any of the of the other films by MR. Lynch you may agree he uses a fair amount of dreamworld aspects mixed in with reality.  Previously mostly in and around small towns and lonely spaces.  But with MD he flips the camera around and sees Hollywood itself as a strange place mixed with dreams and nightmares.

Major bummer that this film/show did not get to be made into a series.  Its pretty clear from the film that he did his best to use what he had and put his ideas into just a few hours....when it should have been spread out over at least 8 to sixteen episodes. [btw: there is a version of the twin peaks pilot that tried to do the same thing and crunch it all down to two hours with just ok results].

I noticed alot of people trying to solve this movie like it was a crossword puzzle but I think DL doesnt want everything to be solved.  So as much as I liked this movie its mostly because it points to what could have been developed over more shows (the strange old couple that seem so happy to throw ""betty"" into a town that could eat her alive (and later come back to taunt her in a very bizarre sequence that to me hints they are crazy spirits of some kind; the cowboy; the director, the police, the thugs and the strange gangsters).

Well lots worse things happen in this world than a show being cancelled before it even starts so I just have to deal with it.  But for me part of the fascination with this film is imagining what more could have been involved (on the other side twin peaks and other shows went on too long and tried to reveal/explain too much).

Its worth seeing this film with DL's Inland Empire which also deals with a women caught in the bizarre world of hollywood. Despite his dark humour, DL seems to really care about the people in his movies (though they go through a lot).  I for one think he was both films were a slight change in his vision.  MD and IE start really talking about hollywood being vortex of human desires and dreams and people damaged very badly by desires (in particular women who are the center of the desires)...and this vortex spreads back out over space and into the past (back to Europe, the old country).  But that is a big oversimplification.  The ghouls, the creeps and angels (some applying to the same character) all have a story to be told as well .  Its a very strange world and a place like hollywood is where the strangeness is even greater.",1367798400,2,2425,4.277899343544858

1483597,3,B00005JKJA,"Oh come on. This film makes sense only if the story is explained to you. The cues for the dream passages are simply not articulated well. It's like the director didn't really care if you understand what's going on. And why is this girl even dreaming? Where are we going? Storywise there's no THERE there. The movie doesn't end, it simply stops. It's like the film broke mid-reel and both the audience and take-up reel are left spinning in perpetuity. Still, it's David Lynch, and there's wonderful film making -if not story telling- taking place.

If you loved Twin Peaks you will likely love this film. If you were disappointed by the untidy loose ends of Twin Peaks... the pointless plot points, the surrealistic path that leads nowhere, and the unresolved elements of the last episode, then you may be equally disappointed in Mullholland Drive, which was initially devised as a TV pilot. The pilot was rejected, so Lynch tacked an ending on to it. What ending? What got resolved?

David Lynch is a brilliant film maker, rendering unparalleled mood and intensity on the screen. But he has some internal compulsion that pushes him too far. He's creative enough to invent new metaphors, but he sticks with the old ones, as with the dwarf and the draped room (Mullholland Drive is arguably the opening episode for season 3 of Twin Peaks). Surrealism is great, but give it meaning David... even 'pretend' meaning. We want to go for the ride, but you never get us to the destination. That would be OK too if you would at least give us something to wrap our willingness to suspend-our-disbelief around. But there's just too many needless sub-mysteries and we lose interest.

When the unsatisfactory ending to Mulholland Drive arrives you almost don't care because it's clear that the investment you've made in following the story turns out to be nothing more than mental masturbation. The film's got some great moments though, and still worth the view. Just temper your expectations. For me Lynch is at his best when someone hands him the story and he simply makes the movie.

The film certainly doesn't take the viewer by the hand and lead them through step by step, instead it leaves things up to their own interpretation, making it necessary for their own neurons to participate in the process of creation, not unlike in an abstract painting.

We see movies all the time with plot holes the size of mac trucks and silly premises, but this is not what we have here. Instead this is a very simple and common story told in a very unconventional way, with a skillful blurring of the lines between fantasy and reality, thereby letting our own minds make connections that might be unexpected. What more could you want from art or a film?

Beyond this the acting is incredible, especially by Naomi Watts, who not only has to act, but also has to act like she is acting, which she does in one very memorable scene, which is just one of many scenes you won't easily forget.

Final advice: Watch this movie as you would look at a piece of art. Let your mind go where it wants, without regard to whether it makes sense at the moment, and you might begin to understand the acclaim this film has received. Multiple viewings wouldn't hurt either.

Diane wins a jitterbug dancing contest in her native Deep River, Ontario, Canada  which creates the opportunity for her to pursue her career ambitions in Los Angeles, California, USA.  This is determined in retrospect by what she says at a dinner party (Clue #10).

3.)  The Bedroom.  Immediately following the jitterbug scene, but much later in her life, that's Diane heading to bed (make a mental note of the red sheets and pillowcases and the green blanket).  This becomes clear in retrospect (Clue #6).

4.)  Diane's Dream.  As soon as her head hits the pillow, Diane's dream begins with someone riding in a limousine at night along Mulholland Drive in Hollywood, California (this dream lasts for about two hours).  Some people are skeptical about this being a dream segment because, when it was shown in the pilot episode of the television version of ""Mulholland Dr.,"" it wasn't presented as a dream.  While that's true, it doesn't change the fact that, in the movie, it's been repurposed as a dream.  It's like someone who built a restaurant later converting it into a nightclub.  Well, once the conversion is complete it's a nightclub because it's been repurposed to be one.  The dream segment is determined by comparing Clue #3 with Clue #6.

5.)  The Story in the Dream Versus the Plot of the Movie.  The simple and unambiguous plot of ""Mulholland Dr."" is revealed during the last 30 minutes of the movie, not in Diane's dream.  Though fascinating to watch and though it has some interesting parallels to her waking life, in the last analysis, Diane's dream is just a dream.  Therefore, conflating the story in the dream (based on subjective dream interpretation) with the plot of the movie (based on facts) results in unnecessary complexity and ambiguity.

6.)  The Neighbor.  As Diane awakens to the sound of her neighbor knocking on her front door (which she began hearing unconsciously shortly before she woke up), notice the red sheets and pillowcases and the green blanket (see Clue #3).  Aside from this scene establishing that Diane Selwyn is the dreamer, here are the three most important points to get from the neighbor's visit:  1.)  notice that the neighbor takes her ashtray from Diane's coffee table, 2.)  notice that there is a blue key sitting on the coffee table near where the ashtray was, and 3.)  make a mental note of the last thing the neighbor says to Diane just before she leaves (or if you think you might forget, pause the movie and write down the last thing the neighbor says before leaving).

7.)  Diane Hallucinates Seeing Camilla.  After the neighbor leaves, when Diane sees Camilla Rhodes (Laura Harring) in the kitchen, she's hallucinating (Camilla is not really there).  This will become apparent in retrospect (Clue #13).

8.)  Flashback.  While wearing a white bathrobe, Diane makes herself a cup of coffee and carries it to her living room.  When she gets to her couch, the scene abruptly changes to her wearing short blue jeans and nude from the waist up and carrying a glass (instead of a coffee cup) with some other type of beverage.  On her coffee table, the neighbor's ashtray is there and the blue key is missing.  This means that we have switched from Diane's present to her past (see Clue #6).  In this scene, Camilla is really there.

9.)  The Flashback Sequence.  The plot of ""Mulholland Dr."" is revealed during the last 30 minutes of the movie and most of this time is devoted to a series of flashbacks (starting with Clue #8).  Generally, the last half hour shows events from Diane's waking life that really happened (exceptions are noted, such as the hallucination in the kitchen).  To understand the plot, keep this in mind:  it's all about Diane Selwyn, Camilla Rhodes, Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), and the unnamed man Diane meets with at the diner.  All you have to do is learn who these people are, the actions they take, and the impact those actions have on one another.  The narrative is easy to understand.

10.)  Adam Kesher's Dinner Party on Mulholland Drive.  In my opinion, this is the most important scene of the movie and why the film bears its name.  At this dinner party, the conversation becomes significant as soon as everyone is inside the house (especially the dialogue between Diane and Coco, Adam`s mother).  There are two things that happen at this dinner party that particularly impact Diane (one regarding something Camilla does and one regarding an announcement that Adam makes just as this scene abruptly ends).  This pivotal dinner party scene more fully establishes the identities/backgrounds, personalities, character, and motivations of Diane, Camilla, and Adam.

11.)  The Diner.  The final flashback scene (and, in my opinion, the second most important scene in the movie) occurs in a diner called Winkies on Sunset Blvd.  Having seen what happened at the dinner party, you'll understand who the unnamed man is Diane is meeting with and why she's meeting with him.  You'll also understand the significance of the blue key that you saw sitting on Diane's coffee table (Clue #6).

12.)  Symbolic, Not Real.  The scene that immediately follows the diner scene is a cinematic device that signals Diane's impending descent into madness (Clue #13).  Although interesting to ponder, everything shown in this scene is not necessary to understand the plot of ""Mulholland Dr.""

13.)  Descent into Madness.  This scene returns us to Diane's present where we see her sitting on her couch while still wearing her white bathrobe.  The coffee cup we saw her carrying earlier is now sitting on her coffee table.  Notice that her neighbor's ashtray is gone and the blue key is sitting on the coffee table (Clue #6).  Diane stares obsessively at the blue key (Clue #11), fully realizing what it signifies.  Soon, as we hear the sound of someone knocking loudly on her front door (which Diane could be merely imagining due to her paranoia or someone could really be there possibly related to the last thing her neighbor said before leaving--Clue #6), Diane`s mounting guilt and fear get the better of her.  Because of the serious consequences of her action at the diner, she suffers a psychotic breakdown, which we see from her mental perspective. According to an online medical dictionary, (paraphrasing) people suffering from psychosis are unable to distinguish personal subjective experience from the reality of the external world. They experience hallucinations and/or delusions that they believe are real and may behave erratically.  That description fits this scene to a tee.

14.)  Another Symbolic Scene.  This brief, symbolic scene features one of the figures we saw in the last such scene.

15.)  Two Lovers.  Kind of an epilogue, this brief, poignant scene (either a flashback or symbolic) shows a happy time during the lives of two very familiar people who were once lovers.

16.)  The Silencio Nightclub.  The final scene.  ""Silencio"" means ""silence"" in Spanish.

In my opinion, ""Mulholland Dr."" is David Lynch's greatest film and one of my personal favorite movies of all time.",1354665600,6,8970,4.9206137424949965

I was suckered,yes. This over-reach turns out to be a stilted exercise in ill-wrought  symbolism, too much of it feeling distant and abstract, the entire affair confusingly nonsensical.  Perhaps if I really understood the obtuse plot line, were that even possible, I might recant.  I have no desire to try.  The movie fails, I believe, because of its lack of realistic specificity; it is a con.  Lynch, straining for creativity (what a grand imposter he is) stoops to trying to appropriate ""Day of the Locust"" end-point imagery.

1483766,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is a psychological thriller. In this case I subscribe to the notion that the film depicts the dream sequences of a woman who can't live with herself after her murder of another woman over a man. Whatever happened to the young woman who was once so hopeful and confident? How did she ever become so unsure of herself? Betty finds Rita hiding in her aunt's apartment. Rita can't remember anything. Together they begin following the clues towards Rita's identity which gradually lead to the awful truth about both of them. Betty is Diane Selwyn, a lonely, depressed woman, whose career as an actress is pretty much finished and in love with a woman, Camilla Rhodes a.k.a. Rita, who now scorns her. How did two such lovely young women lose their lives?? Diane put out a contract on Camilla and received a blue key when the deed was done but now she can't live with herself and takes her own life. Martin Scorsese finishes the thought in his film, Shutter Island, before they take him away for a lobotomy Teddy Daniels remarks, ""one can live as a monster or die as a good man"".

1483840,1,B00005JKJA,"Though I loved Blue Velvet - at least with this one you could follow its convoluted plot amid all the ""weird"" goings on - I'm afraid this one left me cold. At first, I found myself irritated by the leading character's ""naivete"" - why didn't she just call the cops? But I know this never happens in movies. In Blue Velvet, the main character gets into deep waters as he takes it upon himself to ""investigate"" something he has no business getting involved in to begin with. Typical suspense ploy done to death by Mr Hitch, that requires the viewer to end up identifying with the main character's jeopardy - and one always does, that's the power of movies - and clever directors. Well, by the time I realized that Mullholland Drive was, first, the idealized fantasy the main character has about herself (helping another female in distress to the point of falling in love with her), then a nightmare about guilt, and that she in fact had caused the demise of the ""one that got away,"" I thought to myself, oh, here we go again, another cliched swipe at lesbians. Though this one dispenses with the usual icepick, she nevertheless hires a hitman to take care of her treacherous innamorata. And this took two and a half hours to tell. Yes, it's all dazzling to look at, spookily scored, and with the usual Lynchesque gallerie of grotesques, but it's way too long for the tale told. Sometimes Weird for its own sake can be its own worst enemy. I'm afraid that's the case here. Strictly for fanatical Lynch fans and straight men who get off watching Saphic sex in all its splendor, then fantasizing that one of the gals will end up ""doing the right thing"" and marrying a guy, and that the one dumped goes bonkers and kills the ""object of her affection"", rather than see her ""be happy,"" - thus ""proving,"" I guess, that Lesbians are sore losers.

To find out why this is, go to wikipedia and check out the extensive discussion about the film and you'll learn that it was intended as a TV pilot and eventual TV mini-series.  With that knowledge in hand it is easy to see that the end result was NOT the mind-blowing, surrealistic ride of a film genius (i.e. Lynch) ... rather it's just a number of scenes intended for an extended TV series that were cobbled together with an additional $7 million of additional filming ... sad but true.  I'm a film lover and student of film (studied editing in college) but Lynch's Mulholland Drive is a not the masterful suspense film that many viewers here believe ... rather, it's just a fake (albeit one I like) that sucked us in and has kept us guessing ... just my humble opinion",1324252800,5,1051,4.463541666666667

 I am dubious about the fortuity, and think definitely that this film, Mulholloand Dr, was not made fortuisously but very deliberately. The storyline is, of course, as anticipated, very much twisted, but very well structured.

Other reviewers here have given this movie a very thorough explanation and I am very appreciative for their contributions. Prior to reading them I was quite lost with everything.

Once you get into this movie with the understanding of complex details then it's like enjoying an opera. However, it is like an opera that you've already seen once and now know what to expect. However, more details come through and you gain a deeper appreciation for it more and more with each viewing experience. It's fascinating that a director would go through so much effort to create a very complex film. But on the flip side it creates a bit of effort for the viewer. For instance, I had to read several reviews here to understand the basic premise of the movie. Then I watched it again two more times. So, in viewing this movie three times, reading and writing and rewriting my reviews I've spent more than ten hours on this movie.

1483910,4,B00005JKJA,"Many of us have seen bad movies: movies that exhibit the director's lack of visionary technique. I must say that Mulholland Drive is not one of those films, because it seems this film has a strong intention. David Lynch is a visionary director, and sometimes his aesthetic presentation supercedes his ability to tell a good story; but sometimes--for me--when one element of a film is done extremely well, it drowns out some of the film's other shortcomings. For example, his adaptation of Dune was awful. I'll admit, the film sported some interesting effects for its time, but the film's execution was very poor, as certain details were too diluted and certain characters presented and then forgotten. In Mulholland Dr. it almost seems that Lynch pays a homage to his ability to create effective mood and his sometimes inability to tell a coherent story. There are so many great scenes in this film that could have led to so many other plot turns, but don't seem to tie into the film as a whole.-- I began watching it expecting one thing, and once the credits rolled, I realized that coming into this movie with expectations was a waste of time.

I read a review by Roger Ebert, who raved about this film, and he pointed out that Lynch is creating dreamscapes in Mulholland Dr.: scenes that work single-handedly but do not continue into the thread of typical narrative. It seems Lynch is taking a daring step here, because a movie like this has never been done before. I enjoyed this film primarily on an aesthetic level. While watching it, I felt like I was in a dream, and that was perhaps what the director was attempting to do: transport --the viewers--into a living dream.

Do I agree with many that maybe this movie was overspeculated and that Lynch is propbably in his work study, laughing at all of us for overanalyzing his film? Probably. But a movie like Mulholland Dr., despite its purpose, should be analyzed because that is why it was made. We can all probably agree that the film is not mainstream; it does not follow the typical Hollywood narrative formula. It can be analyzed as a cynical director's idea of poking fun at the whole idea of criticizing and dissecting film, or it can be viewed as a narrative experiment, in which case other elements of the film need to be allowed to resonate above the overall script.

All in all, what I can definitely say is that Mulholland Dr. is like no movie-viewing experience you've ever had before. Will you be confused? Probably. Will you jump to random (maybe fruitless) conclusions as to what you feel the ending meant? Definitely. But, to me, that is part of the entire experience. Let Lynch have a good laugh, because, let's face it, I had one hell of a great laugh after watching the garbage that was his film, Dune (which was an attempt to be coherent, but was not...and I doubt the director was making a social commentary there), but Mulholland Dr. is more tonally immersive and, after viewing it, you'll literally feel like you have just stepped out of a beautifully haunting nightmare.",1299369600,,3052,4.700934579439252
1483911,5,B00005JKJA,"This is easily my favorite contemporary movie.  Spoiler alert: some of these reviews have a lot of detail that will impact your viewing.  It's better to go in cold and be shocked like the rest of us were.  Spend some time thinking about the movie and watch it a couple of times before reading the excellent interpretations others have here.

This movie is extraordinary.  Don't worry about how the movie began or whether it was always intended to be like this.  Just enjoy it.  The pacing, characters, dialog, scenery, music and plot are all excellent.  When this movie came out, I wasn't yet a fan of David Lynch.  I remember seeing trailers for the movie and not being interested.  I picked up a copy of the movie years after it debuted and I was blown away.

This is not a movie you will watch once and forget about.  There are no scenes that feel out of place or could be excluded.  I watched this again with a friend of mine and we had a long discussion after it was over.  A few months later she texts me in the middle of the night with more thoughts about the movie.  It's one of those movies.",1299024000,9,1100,4.323529411764706
1483912,1,B00005JKJA,"Yes, I get the film.  And I like convoluted movies.  However I have never seen such wooden acting.  Perhaps David Lynch intended that to seem dreamlike, however it doesn't convey ""dream sequence"" to me- it just reminds me of really bad D-- movies I have seen in the past - made on 3 digit budgets. Also, the slow disconnected performances and delayed responses are not really consistent with the theme - so as an artistic form it doesn't work.  If the main character were OD-ing on drugs maybe.

There are many very cool movies where the viewer has to work to figure out what is real and what isn't.  To me this one seemed lame in the extreme.",1296864000,3,643,4.406779661016949
1483913,5,B00005JKJA,"I had to purchase a second copy since my first one began to skip. This work of art got under my skin like no other. Someone recently posted a review here which reminded me that I had wanted to  update my thoughts on this film which seems like a never ending journey. I am writing more an alternate way to view the film rather than a review. It is likely I will be unable to express this in a way others will be able to relate to  but here goes...

My appreciation and perspective continue to evolve as I explore further the wondrous world of Mulholland Drive. Conceptually for me, Lynch has created a beautiful and surreal picture of the mysterious workings within the psyche and all of the films characters  ultimately can be seen as interacting  mental forces within the subconscious mind. I further interpret it as a masterfully creative representation of Eastern based philosophical concepts like ""oneness"", and ""desire being the basis of suffering"" and ""the path to nirvana is within each person"". I almost imagine a tiny grain of truth wrapped in infinite layers of illusion, representing a conceptual model pertaining to Eastern philosophy. The title ""Mulholland Drive"" can bring forth many possible interpretations, one of which is ""Material Ambition"" where the self centered dream/desire (Hollywood) of material success (Mulholland and Hollywood) becomes the drive/ambition which leads to suffering.

Many may know of David Lynch's lifelong practice of Transcendental Meditation or TM. It led to his establishing the David Lynch Foundation, which seeks to promote TM with the goal of spreading world peace. Please check  this on the web if you are unaware of how committed he is to TM and consider how it could inform and inspire his work. Perhaps some may also be aware of his thoughts regarding the comparison of TM  to something in physics called the ""unified field theory"".  My admittedly limited understanding of this ""unified field theory"" as it applies to TM, suggest that there exist an essence of ultimate awareness or enlightenment laying at the center of many layers of consciousness (this may not be exactly correct). Devotees suggest TM can allow an individual to begin to reach for this ultimate level within (and more).

Anyway, I have begun to experience the film as an infinitely layered symbolic representation  of concepts related to Eastern philosophical thought like ""desire is the basis of all suffering"". The model might be extended to represent the unified field theory too but I am not exactly sure exactly what it is. From this POV, there exist any number of  layers of multiple ""outside solutions"" wrapped around layers of ""inner interpretations"" further wrapping  a center ""point"" of ""inner enlightenment"" or ""ultimate reality"". The  ""outer"" layers are illusionary stories, where viewers extrapolate their own personal solutions outside of the films actual content. These are mostly regarding what I consider a physical reality based story of a woman's Hollywood experience and involve deducing scenarios not contained within the film, to arrive at what the viewer considers a logical ""real world"" solution. Though I believe these are never complete, many apparently are satisfied at that point though will have had to create something not explicitly shown in the film or have some questions remaining. These deduced explanations might be comparable to ""illusions"" of the physical world where what we expect will provide ultimate happiness are false paths, never leading to complete contentment.  These outside layers wrap around more non-physical dreams and mindscapes which begin to increasingly rely more on the films literal content with more elements remaining ""inside"" the film.  This can be reinforced once discerning a film ""language"", made up of every element and includes lighting, names, locations, colors, wardrobe, dialogue, sequencing, editing, props, titles, sounds, music, credits etc. as well as DL's own history. This ""language"" is elegant and wonderful once the willing viewer is able to let go of conventional viewing and grasp the simplicity of it. Perhaps that too is a philosophical connection which might suggest enlightenment is simply ""seeing what is"". If one simply sees what is in the film, a new enlightenment, interpretation or understanding is possible.

Delving deeper into the mindscapes and metaphor, the film can suddenly open up to where everything begins coming together to reveal a wondrous symbolic allegory illustrating the unseen internal danger possible when choosing a self centered material existence over a more loving and compassionate one. All characters could be imagined as representing various identities inside of ""one"" being,  interacting within a mental world inside ""the mind"".  Think beyond guilt, desire, id, ego  and super ego. Think beyond male and female or young and old. Think beyond dream and reality, into the most fundamental element of our humanity and existence (or perhaps the unified field). For me, Lynch has painted a beautiful and surreal picture of the mysterious workings within our heads where all of the characters represent interconnected  mental forces within the subconscious mind. These are the very real forces that somehow create the electric impulses that lead to the decisions we make and affect how our lives will be. We expect the physical and material world of ""the good life"" to provide happiness at the risk of our inner well being and the ""good life"". Deciphering the ""language of the film"" can allow the viewer to gain a more ""unified"" understanding...similar to what some suggest occurs when learning the language of Transcendental Meditation or seek Nirvana.  I get a feeling of the film representing an adult lifetime of desire and a guilt born of remorse that results in an empty, lonely and frightened inner reality being forever replayed, never to attain a permanent state of contentment. It can be imagined that the physical layers surrounding this depiction of the repetitive mental allegory may be analogous to the way Lynch may view the unified field theory at the center of all being.

Okay, I know it may sound crazy. I know next to nothing of Eastern Philosophy and I believe there exists many parallels in the film which I will never be aware. But for me, this view has resulted in the film blossoming in seemingly endless ways which build on each other with detail upon detail becoming somehow wondrously connected to the whole. This takes Mulholland Drive into a realm beyond cinema to become (for me at least) a unique and thought provoking experience. Perhaps even ""mind expanding"". I DO NOT claim to have a complete understanding, but every viewing brings some further observation or ""enlightenment"", enriching the experience for me. It also has made me curious about TM and other meditative paths. I am aware that many consider TM a cult or religion of sorts and warn of the dangers if one is susceptible to certain sales techniques. It is my nature to be skeptical and resist being led, but I also like to ""keep an open mind"".

An ultimate coalescence of David Lynch's surrealist and mainstream talents, MULHOLLAND DR. can certainly be explained and understood. It's all here . . . All the familiar Lynch-isms sewn into a bizarre, tight package (Labyrinthine structure, hot sex, oldies music and large red, velvet curtains on-board, Captain). Witness our trusty auteur perform the expert trick of accurately translating the possibilities of ""Dream-Time"" to film.

Starting from frame one (including the groovy 50's dancers), the viewer becomes submerged in Naomi Watts' dream (notice the pillow shown for a few seconds). The dream is based on her recent experiences with people she knows well or has merely glanced at briefly (Cowboy, Espresso-dude, Winkies diner guy) dwelling in her dream chambers with elaborate storylines. Her wish for stardom, girl-on-girl lust and shameful, murderous guilt fuel Watts' visions. Although she's not in many scenes, every scene is wholly part of her dream and moves towards one conclusion: Her object of desire is slain and she is responsible for the vile crime. The drop-dead beautiful Laura Elena Haring utters her final line ""Donde estas?"" before vanishing from Naomi's sub-conscious and existence all-together. After Diane Selwyn awakens, all action takes place mostly via flashback as we learn piece by piece how the elements of the dream formed. The only ""real-time"" shown is her final hour, in the apartment.

In a nutshell, she's love-sick and insane, went ahead and hired a hit-man to murder her ex-lover (Rita/Camila) and kills herself with the police banging on the door. The ""little"" old people are hallucinations perhaps representing her conscience like a Lynch-ian ""Jiminy Cricket."" As for the grimy, scary homeless guy behind Winkies, well, by Diane's dream logic, this handsome fellow exists as the puppet-master of her fate and is ""making it all happen."" After all, he does possess the magic box . . . You know, all simple as a TV sitcom!

After comparing breast sizes, both woman fall into a deep sleep. Betty is woken by her lover muttering the words ""Sinatra"" over and over. Most male members in the audience eagerly expect this to be a precursor to further breast comparisons and maybe some decent girl on girl action but instead we are transported, with the girls, to a night club wherein a magician magically disappears and a spanish singer sings a Roy Orbison song in spanish which makes the girls very upset.

OK, so I won't get into the plot again. Suffice it to say that there will always be haters of this masterpiece, just like there will always be haters of ""2001, A Space Odyssey"", and others of its ilk. Why? Because some people just want to be entertained, and be spoon-fed a story that they don't have to put any effort into understanding. They tend to get angry about things that they can't understand easily. Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Yes, this movie is just about impossible to fully understand, or put together, on the first viewing (unless you read about it ahead of time, and that really does take away all the fun). The story is not told in a linear fashion. This is rendered further complex because you don't realize the extent of this until the movie is over. Not that the ending explains anything, like, for example, it does in ""The Sixth Sense"".  You have to put it together. Yes, when I saw it the first time it was a total mind screw that I did not understand. But, it was so compelling that I simply had to figure it out. So, after reading reviews, discussions with others, and rewatching, I began to see it clearly. The more times I watched it (over a period of time) the more its magnificence (yes, magnificence) unraveled in a way that was absolutely mesmerizing! If you were a fan of the TV show ""Lost"", and tend to like stories that you have to put in mental effort to figure out, then this is the film for you. It is innovative, rich, powerful, emotional, intense, stark, erotic, and so incredibly sad. Naomi Watts- phenomenal in what is ultimately revealed to be an extremely complex and difficult role to play. The beauty of this film is in the unique way that it will ultimately unravel for you, bit by bit.  Kind of like a classicist looking at modern art for the first time, and simply dismissing it as stupid- that is who the haters are, and I get that.  But to me, the fact that Lynch's mind came up with such a fascinating and completely different way of telling a story is what gives the movie its true value. It made most critics lists of the top 10 films of the decade (2000-2010) and deservedly so. But if you are the kind who simply wants to have a story told to you without having to put in any of yourself, don't bother, you won't like it.

I thought it would be like the pilot of Twin Peaks that they was shot for release in French movie theaters. Anyone who has seen it knows what I'm talking about. They take the greatest pilot of all time and try to wrap it all up in three scenes. It's pretty bad, but at least it got Lynch to create The Man From Another Place. David Lynch added the end scenes on Twin Peaks because of a deal that was written into his contract. Thankfully he wanted to finish Mulholland Drive properly. Instead of adding three scenes, he was given seven million dollars to flesh out the ninety-minute pilot into a two-and-a-half-hour movie. The result gave David Lynch some of his best reviews since Blue Velvet. Words like masterpiece and brilliant were being thrown around.

""Mulholland Drive"" is the best of Lynch's strange movie making efforts. However the viewer must give this work their full attention from opening to end.  It is one of the few movies I ever watched that demanded an immediate second viewing, as I did not understand it fully until the very end which was, for me, a Eureka moment.

I consider this movie ""great"" because it has all the elements that in my opinion make it worth watching.  It grabs ones attention at the very beginning and holds it throughout. Mr. Lynch never talks down to his audience, on the contrary he assumes the viewer is a bright, intelligent, inquisitive person and he constructs his entertainment in such a manner as to tax that intelligence and reward the curiosity. Additionally this movie is simply great fun.  In trying to figure out what's going on and why, the viewing time of 2-hours and 27-minutes, passes like the speed of light.

1484067,3,B00005JKJA,"Lynch is certainly in control of this film from every angle, and it is a carefully crafted noir that is haunting, hypnotic, and wildly inventive. I understand that is about Diane's dream and its fractured nightmare logic, but it seems to be more about pure mood than anything else. Lynch is certainly a master of evoking a sense of paranoia and fear, but the film, like many of his others, left me thinking, so what? I've seen it three times through and there are certainly clues to its oneiric logic, and it doesn't really ""cheat"" the viewer with contrived twists out of left field (not a shaggy dog story). But, that being said, it comes off as more of an expert exercise than an unforgettable experience. Again, the exercise is handled skillfully, but ask yourself, so what? Is it another example of excessive style over substance? Do we ever really care about these characters? And if some of us eventually do, does it not come long after having to rummage through all of Lynch's tedious individual scenes, some with characters and narrative threads that never go anywhere? There are other stylistic exercises full of nightmare logic, like Scorsese's ""After Hours,"" that work wonderfully; something about ""Mulholland Drive"" just keeps me from jumping on the bandwagon. I sometimes think Lynch's film are dark in-jokes told for exclusive kicks, irrespective of the audience. There is a gentleman on youtube who I've heard explain otherwise impenetrable films like ""Lost Highway"" with recondite discussion that seems both post-modern and quasi-spiritual. If what he expounds is truly Lynch's philosophy, than I fear only Lynch and coffee shop regulars interested in esoteric academia will ever know what exactly is going on in some of these films. Don't get me wrong, I find 'Mulholland Drive"" much more fascinating than both ""Lost Highway"" and, I'm sorry to report, ""Blue Velvet."" The former seems incomprehensible, and the latter needs to decide what kind of movie it wants to be (I may be one of the few who agree with Ebert on Velvet, even though I disagree with him on Mulholland).

1484068,5,B00005JKJA,"Like life, this film gives us a swirling soup of experience from which we have to construct a meaning. That the meaning we arrive at is by no means predetermined & unambiguous, as well as the fact that we first have to undo the macrame Diane has woven from the strands to justify herself makes this gem of a film linger in the mind.

While many reviewers seem to throw their hands in the air & claim that this film is not meant to have any real coherence, just atmosphere, I disagree. There are certainly thought-provoking ambiguities, but there is also deep structure that keeps us enthralled by the story. The hero arcs, just not happily.

There seems to be some common confusion about a number of the scenes & characters. Here are my interpretations of some of the most frequently asked questions. Beware of spoilers!:

This film has been called a dream by several reviewers, but to me it's more just the way the mind works all the time, constantly mashing things up, rewriting events until a final version of history is reached, usually on reflection & in consultation with others. Especially if--like our protagonist--you are wigged out about broken love, probably on drugs, & seriously depressed about your career. For instance, how many times have you worked out this kind of detail with your significant other?: so, who was that person at the party? Oh, I thought he was her brother. No? Her boyfriend? Didn't she work for Xerox? Oh, it was Kodak. Wasn't that the other girl? I thought he had dark hair. His name is Dave, right? No, John...etc. Now turn that process into pictures & it looks a lot like Mulholland Drive.

How do we know that Diane was involved in prostitution?

Did you notice that the prostitute in the scene with the hitman [pimp?] matched the general description of Diane, i.e. blond, passive, young? Did you wonder how a struggling actress might have known a hitman to call to bump off her ex-lover? In fact, there are a lot of blonds in this movie, & they all seem to represent Diane--either her delusional ideals or her reality.

Why is Camilla/Rita such a darling of the mafia dons who are pushing to get her in the lead role of ""The Sylvia North Story""?

I found the power-brokers to be far more symbolic than real. They were Greek Gods, dispensing favor capriciously, spurning sincere burnt offerings [espresso, I love it!], & selecting favorites more or less on whim. At least that was Diane's perception of things, although the audition scene clearly suggests that Camilla's acting chops & screen sexuality were much stronger than Diane's, even though we saw the scene as though Diane was the actress. The theme of Greek mythology was hit on in the opening scene as well, as the man in the coffee shop acts out a convincing oracle, & later, as the Lee Grant character predicts impending doom to deaf ears like Cassandra. There's also something vaguely Odyssean about the pool guy & unfaithful wife grappling with the indifferent giant.

How do we know that Aunt Ruth was dead in real life?

Diane tells us at the dinner party. Also, where else would a struggling actress have gotten a large amount of cash to slide across a table to a hitman if not from that inheritance? Maybe having spent her last resource helped push her over the edge.

Why did Rita feel compelled to cut her hair after the ""Silencio?""

Diane was putting things back together in her mind, realizing the consequences of her actions, separating the reality of herself from the fairytale version conflated from her initial naivete & inflated perception of her talent, talent that was actually Camilla's. The two characters beginning to look alike demonstrates this recognition, as does the final disappearance of Rita.

What was the purpose of the older couple she met on her flight into Hollywood & at the end of the film?

To me, the old couple seem to symbolize hope--the hope of a naive young actress just arriving in Hollywood, the hope that was the only thing that Pandora managed to hold in the box after she released all ills on humanity [Greek mythology again], & the hope that escaped that blue box when it was dropped in the brown paper bag by the beast behind Winkie's near the end [perhaps also a comment on Diane's substance abuse]. The torment of failed hope in the form of the fluttering hands of the old couple was what finally caused Diane to pull the trigger.

In addition to the repeating Greek mythology theme, something I haven't heard other reviewers mention is how blatantly referential the imagery of this film is to Hollywood. Diane's early outfits [& hair] look like they were done by Edith Head for a Hitchcock film; the early scenes of the dance contest look like Annette Funicello will appear any second; Cowboy looks like a live-action Howdy Doody; & actors seem to have been chosen for their industry resonance: Ann Miller, Chad Everett, Billy-Ray Cyrus.",1265500800,2,4890,4.724178403755869
1484069,5,B00005JKJA,"Here's the deal; David Lynch is an acquired taste, so much so that many, many people will never acquire the taste needed to appreciate him.  The best thing about Lynch is the fact that he doesn't care.  From the very beginning, with his BRILLIANT debut film `Eraserhed', Lynch proved that he has a unique visionary style and point of view that he is not willing to bend or compromise just to receive commercial success.  `Mulholland Drive' is about as unconventional a film as you can get, and because of that many people are scared of it or turned off by its complexity.

Don't be afraid.

What I admire about Lynch is that he is very willing to use his talent to make a statement, no matter how bold it may be.  In `Mulholland Drive', Lynch makes many statements and layers them with enough mystery to keep the audience baffled from beginning to end, which only adds to the importance of a film like this.  It will keep you guessing, which will keep you talking, which will keep you interested.

Some have claimed this to be boring.  I think they need to watch it again.

Part of me is chomping at the bit to get into just what this film `means', but I really fear that someone who has yet to experience this film will find my rambling to divulging and may in turn feel the need to watch this film null and void.  There is so much to say about this film but what can you say without giving away too much of the experience.

The film has been dissected numerous times on this site.

The basic plot is this:

Betty is a young and beautiful aspiring actress who moves to Hollywood and is currently staying in her Aunts home while she is away.  After a car accident (portrayed in the films open) a young and beautiful woman named Rita shows up, cursed with amnesia, and Betty decides that she is going to help Rita regain her memory.  Rita only remembers two things, `Diane' and `Mulholland Drive'.

Unlocking those secrets is going to take you places you never imagined.

I idea of mirrored dreams is very prominent in this film, for everything you think you see is a stark contrast to the realities the final 30 minutes unveil to us.  Exact scenarios and situations appear reversed as Diane's identity is revealed and her life is examined for us.  What we are left with is a harrowing discovery that may leave questions unanswered for the `first time viewer', but those questions are easily answered upon repeat viewings.  This is a film that really demands your time in order to appreciate it.  Lynch feels that it must be seen in one viewing, not paused or stopped for any reason, and I concur, for taking yourself away from the film for merely a moment can cause you to leave the world Lynch is drenching you in.  There is a moment, in the film, where a woman sings the song `Crying' and that moment is really the crux for the entire film, explaining so much while seemingly saying so little.

When you watch the film for a second time it will make so much more sense, I promise.

But, truth be told, it is the mystery that makes this film so startling.  The interpretations of this film and the personal feelings towards Diane's predicament really play heavily into how much you will or won't accept the film.  Your love and hate will depend entirely on your willingness to explore the many twists and turns presented in this film.  If you like your entertainment quick and easy then stay away, but if you enjoy taking a film apart, frame for frame, in order to uncover tiny trinkets of deeper meaning then this film will fascinate you.

Oh yeah, and Naomi Watts is a revelation here, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise!",1259107200,,3633,4.487062404870624

Some will enjoy the music, the colors, the lighting, the pacing etc.

Others will enjoy Naomi Watts incredible performance where she has to convey the full spectrum of human emotion.

Think about it...the first part of the movie she plays a perky, naive idealist and by the end of the movie she is equally impressive as a burnt out, suicidal depressive. Anyone who has ever acted can tell you how hard that is to do in the same film.

This is one of Lynch's best films. It is filled with unforgettable scenes (Club Silencio, The audition, The casting meeting with the director and the mobsters).

This is one of those films that will stay in your head.",1258156800,4,714,4.546875
1484071,5,B00005JKJA,"From the outset I must confess that this review is not so much a conventional movie review per se but rather a deeper character and
plot examination/analysis, which I hope will unveil and perhaps shed
some new light on the meanings behind David Lynch's supreme film noir mind bender - Mullholland Drive.

So if you want to experience the thrill of unravelling and 'investigating' the myriad jiggsaw puzzle-like aspects of this movie
for yourself then proceed no further. For those of you familiar or even
well acquainted with the Mullholland Drive universe you may be intrigued
by the theories I present here - so here goes.

First of all, I have not found on any Mullholland Drive internet forums or  chat groups discussion about how crucially important a part the 'Cowboy' character plays in the story and in solving/unlocking the various plot threads of the puzzle. How understanding who he is and more importantly who he represents and or symbolizes in Dianes' dream and waking life/reality allows all the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place.

The 'Cowboy' has to be one of the most bizarre, chilling and creepiest of creeps in the history of cinema and one that only could have been spawned from the mind of David Lynch ( it's my belief that Lynch has created some of cinema's most diabolically perverse and just plain nasty bad guys or creeps - think Frank Booth in Blue Velvet or Bobby Peru - Wild At Heart - truly sinister).

So lets look more closely at the 'Cowboy' character . It is revealed to us the viewer that the 'Cowboy' holds ultimate control and power over
all the movie's characters and most likely Hollywood. He is the one who is controlling everything - from his underling mob henchmen - The Casiglieri brothers to Camilla Rhodes' bodyguards to the midget Mr Roake.

He is the head honcho, the one calling all the shots from up high in the
Hollywood hills from his 'Corrale'. He has the power to close down the
production of a feature film and he has the power to recast a starring actress (Camilla) in his movie - and it is his movie.

Lynch makes it very clear to us that this is the case. The Cowboy basically uses extortion and threats to strongarm the Adam Kesher character into agreeing to his terms - 'You can ride along with me'.

Now if you accept my theory that he is the ultimate antagonist in the
film and therefore in Diane's dream - pulling all the strings as it were, then we must examine and analyze this character even further.

You will need to watch the film perhaps a few more times to pick up these
details however I will point out some here:

a) Pay special attention to what the 'Cowboy' says and how he says it.

  You will notice that he speaks with a 'Southern' accent (possibly Texan) - this is important.

b) Also, look closely at his outfit. No mistaking he's a cowboy alright

with his 10 gallon hat and all. Is it much of a stretch for us to imagine he could also be wearing a Sheriff's badge? Could it be that the
'Cowboy' is also some kind of 'Old Western' stlye Sheriff or U.S Marshall
maybe even a Texas Ranger?

He certainly weilds his power, authority and clout as if he were some
type of high ranking law enforcer - that is clearly evident.

Lynch uses all manner of clever cinematic devices to weave his intricate tapestry. His use of symbolism, metaphor, omens, dream interpretation, psycho-analysis, American History, fable, myth, allegory, cautionary tale, alter ego, dual character, reference/homage to 'Old' Hollywood -
particularly The Wizard of Oz, magic and many more is all here and laced throughout Mullholland Drive.

So if we accept that the 'Cowboy' is not a minor character and is more significant in the context of the plot than what he appears to be at face value, then literally a whole other Pandora's box opens up, with truly new meanings and earth shattering implications unfolding.

I will briefly outline some here.

I believe that the 'Cowboy' is represented not just as the 'Cowboy' but as
2 other characters in the dream section of the movie. They are, can you guess? Gene the Pool Man played by well known country music popstar Billy Ray Cyrus - no less. Making the connection now? And the other manifestation of the 'Cowboy' is the creepy man Betty (Diane) performs
the audition scene with - Wally I think his name is.

Again, if you watch Wally carefully in this scene you will see that he speaks and acts very much like a 'B' grade 'Western' actor from the 1950's and 60's. In the scene they are rehearsing in front of the small group of Director, Producer, Casting Agent etc etc, and in the script Wally plays the part of the girl's incestuous uncle - now this is a key clue. If we apply the logic that the 'Cowboy' is actually being represented or embodied as 3 characters-Cowboy, Gene (Poolman)and Wally then we can begin to see how Lynch is carefully laying the groundwork for us to pick up the true identity of the 'Cowboy' and his real relationship to Diane.

 After careful deduction we can see that the 'Cowboy' is a symbolic dream representation of Diane's real-life evil and incestuous Uncle who was the corrupt town Sheriff with Mob connections and who sexually abused her as a young girl.

I believe Lynch does this with all the other main characters in the movie. In Diane's scrambled dream-logic section of the film (first Three Quaters)characters merge, blur and morph and swap around as they do in actual dreams. However, the fundamental attributes of any particular character remains consistant despite them alternating and changing shape and form. In other words every character depicted in the dream section of
the movie can be directly tranlated as someone from Diane's real life and or past.

By applying this logic I believe Lynch has quite clearly layed out how the puzzle of Mullholland Drive can be solved - everthing is symbolic of
something or someone who is important to the logic of the story. I don't
think Lynch has left any aspect of the film to chance. Nothing has been left unanswered under his masterly direction.

I've run out of time and space here but I would like to continue this
essay and reveal more findings, such as how I believe Adam Kesher is a symbol or metaphor for Diane's father. Details about Diane's sad past-
including how she is actually from the South not the North. I believe
Deep River is really a reference to the South's great Missisippi River.

The true meaning of the Blue Box and many more.

Donnie Darko, Memento, The Machinist, Vanilla Sky, The Others, Seven, Psycho, The Sixth Sense, 12 Monkeys, Frailty, Fight Club, and Existenz. In Jacob's Ladder, it was all a dream, but was way better than this crappy movie. All of these movies were different, cool, and awesome ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE, with a deeper message. I'd like anyone to argue Mulholland Drive is better then any of these movies. People are talking about how this movie has deep, significant meaningfulness and how this movie is special because it's different.

It's definately different because I haven't seen such a bad movie since ""Don't Mess With the Zohan,"" which I left 15 minutes in to get my money back. First off, you don't start a movie with 2 minutes of dumb dancing. I almost turned it off there, but then I said to myself ""give the movie a chance."" So I waited and I saw some kids get in a car wreck, which was kind-of cool, and this guy who sees this weirdo who looks exactly like the mummy behind a dumpster which was really weird.

But then NOTHING happens. It was so boring. Their was no COMPELLING deeper meaning, no matter how hard you try to tell yourself, because the movie doesn't make you care about what is going on or make you think differently about life, which is what GOOD movies do. I understood what the director was trying to do (portray the darker side of the human mind in dream/really weird way), but he failed.

I love it when people (anyone who says this movie is good-emo's) try to show off and act original, mysterious, and different by saying they identify with something few people understand, even though the thing they love so much is really dumb (this movie).

When making a GOOD movie, you have to keep the audience interested ALL THE WAY THROUGH. You can't just throw weird stuff in every couples minutes, have a lesbian scene, and then try to pull it off at the end by saying it was a dumb dream.

Wow,It amazes me that people can actually sell such garbage, let alone watch it. I mean, did anyone who made this movie stop and say to themselves ""this sucks"" and maybe we should not embarrass ourselves and release this film? I felt embarrassed watching the movie because it sucked so bad. It is not artistic, not original, and plain NOT GOOD. It's a crime against film making. I wish I could give it 0 stars.

1484147,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch movies are usually love it or hate it affairs. Some think they are overindulgent ego trips, or pretentious, overly symbolic mishmoshes that need the cinematic equivalent of a Rosetta stone to decipher. Others, look on them as works of inscrutable genius. Lynch's range is actually quite remarkable. The 2 most normal and prosaic (in terms of plot structure) films he directed, THE ELEPHANT MAN and THE STRAIGHT STORY, exist at one edge of the Lynchian universe. At the other you have ERASERHEAD, WILD AT HEART, LOST HIGHWAY, and INLAND EMPIRE. David Lynch can be as coherent and sober as any other mainstream director, or he can be as wildly experimental and innovative as the most obscure artist. Elements of his style can be found in some of Spanish surrealist master Luis Bunuel's early films as well as the work of experimentalist Maya Deren. Although Lynch has asserted that he never consciously imitated anyone else, his admiration for movies like THE WIZARD OF OZ, SUNSET BOULEVARD, and REAR WINDOW, as well as the works of Kubrick, Fellini, and Bergman is well known, and themes and techniques from these are present in many of his own films. The 2 Lynch movies that fall somewhere close to center between the 2 creative poles, that blend artistic sensibility and originality with commercial accessibility, are BLUE VELVET and MULHOLLAND DR. They are mysterious puzzles, but also simply great movies that can be enjoyed on many levels, and like most Lynch films, better appreciated with repeated viewings.

MULHOLLAND DR. was the best film of 2001. It was the most daring, the most beautifully filmed, the bravest, and the most unsettling movie of that year. It had the grotesque elements Lynch is famous for. It had the sardonic humor typically present in his work. It also had from Naomi Watts, the best performance given by an actress that year. It's understandable, that people just scratch their heads and wonder what this movie was all about, but if they can separate the dream elements from the real, they will be on the right track. This is my interpretation so if you haven't seen the film yet and want to form your own opinions, skip the next 2 sections of this review.

Diane Selwyn was a small town Canadian girl who after winning a dance contest got the fame bug. After an aunt who worked in Hollywood died and left her money, Diane moved to Hollywood to try and make it as an actress. At an audition for ""the Sylvia North Story"" she met another more talented and glamorous actress named Camilla Rhodes who got the lead part. They became lesbian lovers. Diane took their relationship a lot more seriously than Camilla, who used sex more as a tool to advance her career. Camilla became a big star and kept getting small parts for Diane in her movies, but although wanting to remain friends, she tried to discourage the affair, especially after hooking up with a hot shot director (Adam Kesher). She invites Diane to a fateful dinner party at the director's house in the hills off of Mulholland Drive. At this party Diane relates her life up to this point. She sees characters at the party that will later populate a fateful dream. For example as she raises a cup of coffee to her lips she sees a character who in her dream will become a member of the mob who tries drinking an espresso and spits it out. She meets Kesher's mother who will become Coco Lenoix in her dream. She sees a cowboy that will become a controlling figure in the dream. It is also here that she sees Camilla kiss another actress (Camilla Rhodes in her dream) and hears the director make an important announcement regarding himself and Camilla. We don't actually hear the words of their impending marriage, because filmed from Diane's perspective the news has an impact on her much like the car crash we see at the beginning of the film. Diane knows that the lifeline to all her Hollywood dreams and aspirations has been severed, and she herself snaps. She meets a guy at Winkie's diner (Joe in her dream), gives him money and a photo of Camilla, saying ""this is the girl"" and is told to expect a blue key when the deed is done. After receiving the key, with the knowledge that her lover and benefactor is dead, Diane's paranoia is exacerbated by real guilt and her life quickly unravels. She hides away in her flat and has a dream. The first clue we are given in fact that most of the film deals with dream reality rather than temporal reality is in the title itself, MULHOLLAND DR., not MULHOLLAND DRIVE. We enter Diane's dreamworld at the beginning of the film (when the credits appear) and pretty much stay there for the first 2 hours. In the dream she is named Betty and Camilla is Rita (who took that name from a poster of Rita Hayworth). Rita becomes a victim of amnesia after a car crash on Mulholland Drive. The crash actually saved Rita from being shot by an unknown hitman. Everything in Diane's dream has relevance to her waking life, but some people inhabit different roles. Much of the material of the dream comes from reality but is refashioned by the subconscious and fueled by desires and emotions. In the dream state time, space, and identity exist in a state of flux. Diane can become Adam Kesher, who loses control of his life, has to hole up out of sight while sinister forces are looking for him, and has to be reminded by an angel figure ""the cowboy"" to adjust his attitude and go with the flow, something Diane in real life couldn't do. Diane's dream is part wish fulfillment and part retribution. In her dream Diane (Betty) is everything Camilla (Rita) was in life..talented, beautiful, in control, and on the way to stardom. She even catches the eye of the director Kesher on the set of ""The Sylvia North Story"". Conversely, in the dream Camilla (Rita) is the one who needs help from Betty to find her identity and avoid being caught and destroyed by sinister forces. Rita recalls the name Diane Selwyn, a person who may know her true identity. Betty and Rita track her down to a low rent apartment complex, but there they discover Diane Selwyn dead on her bed, a rotting corpse. The facial features of the corpse are distorted from decomposition so the dreamer Diane (Betty) is unaware she is witnessing both the result of her act of revenge (Camilla's body) and her own morbid future. Rita then decides to change her appearance by wearing a blond wig. There is an identity transposition in this dream, reminiscent of the one in Bergman's great film PERSONA..even a shot of Betty and Rita in bed after making love, where their 2 faces seem to merge into one. In real life, Diane not only depended on Camilla, she vicariously wanted to live her life, to be Camilla. So,in her dream Diane saves Camilla from death and makes her into this perfect lover and soulmate, everything she wished for in real life. In a reversal of roles she even has Camilla try to become Diane by donning the wig. The dream starts very well for Diane (Betty) but an eerily fateful early morning excursion with Rita to a place called Club Silencio clues them into the fact that it's all been an illusion, with the cold reality of death looming on the horizon. Diane's mind had directed a wonderful alternate reality, but the dream ends and she wakes up to a nightmare..the nightmare of her real life. The final half hour of the movie is Diane's last day in the temporal world, but even here time and reality are in flux as flashbacks and hallucinations predominate. Unlike her dream world, here her delusions are all bad, depressing, menacing, and fueled by an hallucinatory paranoia that ends in suicide.

Because a lot of what we see or hear in a Lynch film is a result of feeling and intuition rather than calculation, they are open to various interpretations. Lynch himself has often stated that he doesn't consciously understand everything he creates, but trusts in the emotional truth of it. As a human being he draws from a well of feeling accessible to all of us, so although we are not privy to the specific intentions of it's creator, his movies resonate with us on emotional as well as intellectual levels. They function as cinematic Rorschach tests for the viewer. We see what we want to see, and if it deeply affects us one way or the other, it has served it's purpose. The observer is emotionally connected , but part of the fun is playing detective and unraveling mysteries just as many of the leading characters do. Why did Diane become unhinged? What do the monster (bum) behind Winkies, the blue box, and the blue haired lady in the box above the stage at Club Silencio, represent? I have my own interpretations and there are many more floating around the web. There are subtle clues throughout the film that point to Diane having been a victim of sexual abuse by her grandfather as a child. This could partially explain her getting romantically involved with a woman instead of a man, having low self esteem, and violently lashing out when she feels abused and betrayed. I see the bum (monster) as Diane's self image after having Camilla killed. The image is one of horror and shame, an image she can't live with. It lurks behind Winkie's because that is where the hitman left the blue key after killing Camilla. It is where the demon inhabited her, where she became a monster. In other Lynch projects like TWIN PEAKS, the notion of an evil presence that can inhabit our bodies is very real. Lynch actually had a woman play the ""monster"". The man at Winkie's in her dream (Dan) who has this ""awful feeling"" and eventually dies at the sight of it is someone Diane actually saw in Winkie's at the time she paid off the hitman to kill Camilla. She sees him staring at her right after she acts on her demonic impulse to commit murder. This evil presence, call it the devil if you wish, is cunning. It can fool us into thinking it has our best interests at heart, send us an outwardly friendly but inwardly sinister old couple (who based on the jitterbug sequence before the opening credits are modeled after Diane's grandparents) to encourage us as we start our journey, and later release them as demons to hysterically mock us, and terrorize our fragile minds into committing the ultimate and final escape. Blue is the color of supernatural mystery for Lynch, and the blue haired lady is a symbol of cosmic truth, the supernatural, impersonal Reality that oversees the illusion and delusion of both the dream theater and the temporal world. She is always there, the mysterious truth above and beyond our mundane worldly consciousness. Everything in this film is presented from the subjective conscious and subconscious of Diane, but the blue haired woman is even present as an impersonal witness to the truth in her dream. After Diane shoots herself some wisps of smoke rise above her body appearing like a soul or spirit escaping from it's earthly prison, and we see a few fleeting images of both women who now inhabit the eternal realm of spirit. For Lynch, a believer in reincarnation from the Vedic Hindu tradition, their stay in the spirit realm will be temporary as they must pay their karmic debts in another lifetime. The last shot in the film is of the Club Silencio stage, and the blue haired lady high up in her box whispering ""silencio""..the silence that remains after the illusory show called life, and the movie, ends. Life, like the movies, ultimately fools us into believing that what is illusory, is real. As for the blue box, I see it as a device to effect transitions between states of consciousness..from the dream state to the temporal world..and from the temporal world to the spiritual realm that exists after death and beyond time and space. Not everything in MULHOLLAND DR. has an easy explanation, but not everything in our lives and dreams can be easily explained either. As humans we are not designed intellectually to understand TRUTH in it's purest form. To Lynch, art is a gateway to Truth, and the illusory world of film can clue us into universal truths which are hidden to us in life (which is itself a grand illusion). Lynch blurs the lines that differentiate dreams from reality, or separate individual personalities. To Lynch, we are not masters of our fate and captains of our soul, but subject to inner forces beyond our cognition, some sinister and some beneficial. The Truth encompasses both good and bad, darkness and light. The struggle between both is an ongoing process within our psyches. Diane wasn't a bad girl. She was a good girl who fell prey to dark forces which all of us are subject to under the right conditions. At the end of this remarkable film we are left in a state of wonder tinged with feelings of deep sorrow and pity.

The inner reality certainly has a lot more to say than the outer, but MULHOLLAND DR. does touch on some matters everyone can comprehend. It has some important things to say about the film business and the nature of fame and celebrity, and it has important things to say about things we all can relate to, such as love, jealousy, guilt, and ambition..but these things aren't spelled out for you. They are more opaque than transparent. MULHOLLAND DR. is a visually stunning and aurally beautiful film. Lynch frequently uses sounds, colors, and objects as clues; a symbolic shorthand to describe emotionally significant elements of the story. Blue keys and boxes, red lampshades and curtains, telephones, flashing lights, the sound of the wind, and the buzzing of electrical currents, all have portentious meaning. Music is another important element that reinforces thematic structures. In BLUE VELVET, Roy Orbison's ""In Dreams"" was used that way, and in MULHOLLAND DR., Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" (Llorando), beautifully and emotionally sung in Spanish by Rebekah Del Rio, effectively sets the right tone. Ms. Del Rio is presented as La Llorana de Los Angeles. The legend of La Llorana gives a clue as to why the Orbison song is chosen and why it affects Diane's dream personas (Betty and Rita) so vividly. The heart wrenching lyrics speak of rejected love, loss and despair, and La Llorana exemplifies the devastation resulting from it, the horrible outcome Diane's subconscious tries unsuccessfully to bury in her dream. There are interesting soundtracks in many Lynch films, and they complement the strong visuals. I just can't imagine a Lynch film now without a brooding Badalamenti score. There are always interesting and amusing elements in Lynch movies that comment on his own personal experiences and illustrate his strange sense of humor. It is easy to imagine that Adam Kesher's meeting with the Castigliane brothers (where control of his film project was taken away), and Betty's audition process must have been reflections of real incidents in Lynch's career in Hollywood. MULHOLLAND DR. is a hybrid of Surrealism and Expressionism. In Surrealism, dream logic replaces reality, and in Expressionism, emotional response through internal conflict, supplant rational motive and pragmatic action. David Lynch is an artist first and a filmmaker second. Here, he has made a movie about a dream, about shattered dreams, and about the dream factory called Hollywood..an original and beautiful, but sad and fearful rumination on life and death in the City of Angels.

If you just want to sit back and be entertained for a couple of hours, I don't think you will enjoy this film, but if you want to be puzzled, astonished, and shocked out of complacency, as well as amused and entertained, watch MULHOLLAND DR. once, or twice, or even better, half a dozen times..and while you're at it, do the same for the other Lynch masterpieces currently available.",1230422400,23,15650,4.75432144170651

1484150,2,B00005JKJA,"Granted some reviewers have created a de facto plot line by arbitrarily deciding that some parts are reality, some dream & some symbolism, etc. but they ignore large parts that can't be fitted into their story line. It's important to note the film started out to be a TV series, its seems a reasonable assumption the movie was cobbled together out of scenes that were originally intended to be used in separate episodes with a different plot. I guess Lynch thought every scene was so precious he had to use them in regardless. The movie could have been cut down by 30-45 minutes and not lost a thing.

Sadly rewatching  the movie didn't clear up a thing, I only saw more problems the second time. Can someone explain -

Who the laughing man is, what does he have and why is it worth killing for?

Who are the Mobster types that are trying to tell Adam who to cast as the lead?

Why is he living in a flop house, why his money cut off, who is looking for him.

Who is the huge guy that goes to Adam's house, why does his wife react like a psycho?

What's with the old lady prophetess of doom?

Who is the 3rd girl seen leaving when Betty and Rita are breaking in and I assume the one who comes back for her stuff?

Why is her ash tray she takes still there in the next scene

Why does Rita decide to go blond then is back to brunette in later scenes?

Who is the middle age red head that wanders in & out for a few minutes?

Whats with the Betty / Diane name swap.

The movie does have some interesting scenes as they stand alone, but trying to fit them into a whole is probally a waste of time. Analyzing movies like this have become the modern equivalent of debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. But it doesn't make for good movies or the director a genius. Genius is making a well crafted movie with a compeling story, not 150 minutes that leave you with that ""Huh"" feeling.",1227225600,3,1895,4.18732782369146

1484152,5,B00005JKJA,"It's hard for me to explain how much of an impact this film had on me. It is one of the most dreamlike experiences that I have ever had in a theatre. The first two hours of the film seem to follow a narrative -- and then there are the last 40 minutes, which will just blow you away if you have never seen this film before. After repeated viewings, I think that I have my own interpretation. The beauty of this film is that you can attach your own ideas to it, thus involving you in what goes down on the screen. It's laced with both horror and mystery, and filled to the brim with dream logic.

Totally captivating and beautiful to look at, this is a true work of art. The best time to view this film would be late in the evening, with the curtains drawn, in the dark. It's frightening, to be sure, but entirely worth it!

For the parents out there, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under the age of 17. There are scenes of explicit sexuality throughout the film.

It's beautful, horrible, and tragic. It's David Lynch. And it's one of my favorite movies ever.",1216857600,5,370,4.6923076923076925
1484154,5,B00005JKJA,"This should be recognized as one of the greatest works of Art ever to be committed to celluloid. Lynch is able to plumb deeply into the sub-conscious of all of us and construct a story which resonates on a primal, visceral, instinctive, and altogether natural level.  Lynch shows how ultimate truth is revealed in dreams despite our feeble attempts to relegate our fears, insecurities and guilt to our subconscious during our waking hours.  In dreams, all of our emotions and thoughts are fleshed out for better or for worse.  Our dreams can amuse us when we do good, and terrify us when we do evil!  Perhaps good and evil are absolute concepts after all, and are non-negotiable!?

While the film is highly structured and self-explanatory (for those who view it repeatedly and carefully), like most of Lynch's work, and particularly ""Inland Empire,"" this film is so beautifully crafted that it can be appreciated solely on an aesthetic level, but ideally on an intellectual one as well.

MD is haunting, brilliant, and the work of a genius. Just when I was losing interest in superficial and banal modern film-making, David has given us a real diamond in the rough!

P.S - If you don't like challenging films which make you think and concentrate, or if your idea of a great film is about sub-woofers and explosions, avoid this at all costs.  If you are amazed at human psychology and drama, don't miss this!

----------------------------------------------

Want to know who the scary, dirty homeless man in the alley may be?

Well, here is my take at least:

Most obviously, he is an element of her dream.  All of the characters that inhabit her dream are people Diane has met or seen briefly during her waking state. Some are significant characters and some are not.  Ever dream about the most absurd or trivial things yourself?  For instance, notice the mafioso type at the party at the end of the movie who Diane only briefly notices as she is wiping away tears?  He may have been a significant part of her life, or he may have just been someone who caused her momentary embarrassment.  Here is the genius of Lynch.  He is demonstrating that nothing is too trivial or absurd that cannot be dreamt about.  This is why Dianne constructs the pool man farce in her dream after only a brief mention of him by Camilla's fianc.

The dirty and horrifying homeless man, who is able to scare us with his abrupt appearance may represent the subconscious guilt that Diane is suffering through.  He is retribution personified, of having to pay for her crimes, through mental anguish.  This is possibly how he is manifested in her dream: When Diane is negotiating with the hit man in Winkies to kill Camilla, there is a tall, dark guy who Diane only briefly glimpses at the other end of the room.  He gives her a brief but intense stare.  This same character, now present in her dream,  gives the suspenseful anecdote of ""the guy who is always there,"" walks to the alley, is startled by the homeless man, and falls to the ground petrified.  At the brief moment when Diane sees him staring at her in Winkies, she no doubt felt fear and anxiety about planning Camilla's death, or being discovered, and therefore even seemingly innocent glances take on a more suspicious nature.  It is no accident that the unnamed guy standing at the bar morphs into a character in her dream that is obsessed and overcome with fear.  Diane is afraid of every bogeyman now, because of guilt, she is even pursued in her dreams.  Our dreams are often comprised of metaphors, and usually bizarre, but reveal general truths, in this case, in a very emotional (terrifying way).  She will not have peace until she has dealt with her sins and cleansed her conscience.  Then her nightmares will go away.

The dirty/scary homeless man can also be an archetype of the devil who metaphorically at least, dwells in places such as ""sin city"" or ""Tinseltown,"" where men lose their souls for wanting it all at any cost.  These are the places where men sell their souls.  Where they are promised the world, but are deceived by the great serpent and deceiver of old; the arch-nemesis of humanity.

Like any true art, Lynch allows multiple interpretations..",1215475200,4,4208,4.733516483516484
1484195,5,B00005JKJA,"When Mulholland Drive first starts, you may think that Lynch is making a pretty normal movie. His style is pretty much the same but the plotline is managing to remain pretty linear (for a mystery film). Slowly, but surely, we begin to slip down the rabbit hole, and things get strange. The performances are great, especially Naomi Watts. This is one of those movies where it keeps getting better scene after scene, and you have to see it again and again. What truly makes this movie great is the numerous interpretations that can be realized viewing after viewing, and the fact that Lynch is such a master, none of your interpretations can be discounted. Go see this movie. Go buy this movie. This is a definate must have.",1214956800,4,722,4.6484375
1484196,5,B00005JKJA,"Just through Eraserhead and Blue Velvet, David Lynch had proven himself to be the oddest, and one of the most daring filmmakers out there; and also one of my favorites. Mulholland Drive emotionally gripped me more than any Lynch film since Blue Velvet, and it still grips me more than most films today.

First of all, the script is among the deepest I've ever seen. This is one of the only films I know of where every single person who's seen it had a different interpretation. I of course have one, but I'll not explain too much; but the sheer fact of this is just mere proof that this is a film you have to see to believe; and most of the stuff you do try to believe you might just find was not a reality and was just a trip into one's mind. Yes, this film truly is, at times, a trip into the mind, dreams, and desperate desires of one woman. There are several different things this woman can be called; I tend to view her as just human with the same desires as any other (but my views of the film definitely do not stop there).

To truly understand this film, you have to pay attention to everything; the location, the words, the context of words, the arrangement of speech, the arrangement of characters, the relationships of characters (especially between the two leading women and their relationships with others), the reasoning behind characters' acts, even the lighting, and even the smallest detail or object to the side of the screen; in this film, everything is truly important to everything else. You also must know quite a bit about actors and definitely some knowledge on classic hollywood. In this paragraph alone, David Lynch has created a true masterpiece.

I was very disappointed in the 2001 Oscars when it came to the nominations; this film got a sole nomination for Best Director. And while Lynch was certainly deserving of that, this film should've also been nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture, and Best Actress for Naomi Watts (her Oscar nominated work in 21 Grams doesn't even touch her work here). Oh well then.",1214092800,2,2054,4.6219178082191785
1484197,5,B00005JKJA,"It is startling that after 7 years no one really figured out what this movie is all about. If for any reason you have not watched this movie then please watch it first and then read my explanation. Spoilers coming:

Movie is about last days of Marilyn Monroe and her tragic death in 1962. Lynch originally intended to start with her death and go back in the past to explain it similar to Twin Peaks series. Someone powerful (like that midget) didn't like it and series was canceled.

Who is who in this movie?

1. Betty, Diane and Rita are all Marilyn. Betty represents Marilyn in movies (angelic naive look), Diane is real life (paranoid and obsessed) Marilyn, Rita is glamorous movie star Marilyn.

2. Movie ""Sylvia North Story"" is actually never finished movie ""Something's Got to Give"".

3. Cowboy is Dean Martin. He had exclusive right of leading lady approval. When Marilyn was fired he said: ""No Marilyn, no picture."" Remember words from the movie: ""This is the girl."" Dean Martin was also associated with mafia.

4. Betty is from Deep Rivers, Ontario. Marilyn's first big budget movie that made her a worldwide star was ""Niagara"" in 1953. Plot of the movie involves Marilyn planning a murder.

5. For role of Rita, Lynch chose Laura Elena Harring, the first Latina to be crowned Miss USA in 1985. Is it coincidence why she takes name Rita? No, because Monroe family was believed to have been Anglo-Spanish in origin. Rita Hayworth was actually Margarita Carmen Cansino, daughter of Spanish flamenco dancer Eduardo Cansino and English/Irish-American Ziegfeld girl Volga Hayworth.

6. When Betty and Rita enter Diane's apartment, Diane is found dead lying on her side just as Marilyn was found in 1962.

7. At the beginning of the movie you can hear someone snorting drugs and then falling to the pillow. Marilyn was declared dead by acute barbiturate poisoning.

8. In the weeks before her death, Marilyn called DOJ where Bobby Kennedy worked eight times. All phone calls from the night that she died are missing. This explains sinister phone calls throughout the movie.

9. Crash scene on Mulholland Drive is very important. It represents collision of glamorous movie star Marilyn full of money and fame with sweet 16 Norma Jeane represented as cheering young girl in the other car. The result is total amnesia. After the crash she takes name Rita (her true Anglo-Spanish origin and real life role model) and remembers the name of Diane Selwyn (real life paranoid and obsessed Marilyn). She also chose blonde wig (Marilyn was not real blonde, she dyed her hair). Glamour movie star Marilyn is lost after the crash.

10. And finally the blue box explained. It relates to famous Blue Book modeling agency. This is where all started. One of Fox's talent scouts noticed her in 1946 and offered a 6-month contract. After Rita opens the box she disappears and Diane wakes up. After remembering how everything started, movie star Marilyn is gone and all that is left is real Marilyn.
Key to the box in the dream sequence is triangular in shape indicating 3 different personalities of Marilyn.

I have watched UK import HD-DVD version with superb DTS-HD MA sound. Chapters are available but not in the menu. Highly recommended movie for all those interested in mysteries and suspense.",1214006400,6,3284,4.863799283154122
1484198,4,B00005JKJA,"In 2001, David Lynch (director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dune/dp/B0007PAMR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dune</a>&nbsp;and creator of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks/dp/B000UX6THK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks</a>) released a complex mystery film that defied the genre rules and mystified audiences. So what's it about?

The film starred Naomi Watts, in an outstanding performance, as a seemingly nave and innocent young actress who stumbles upon a car crash victim with amnesia, played by Laura Elena Harring. The two befriend one another and begin to search for clues to the haunted woman's past. Meanwhile a rebellious young director is being told who to recast as the female lead in his next film but when he refuses, strange things begin to happen. Before long their lives cross paths and all who encounter them are affected.

The film unfolds into a delirium of complex schemes, startling eroticism and complete insanity. But it keeps its viewers interested, though it never truly explains itself. Many people have attempted to unravel the film's meaning (there are quite a few interesting theories suggested by other reviewers). Some say that it's about the dream of a psychotic woman on the verge of committing suicide. Others say it's an allegory for the corruptive nature of the Hollywood lifestyle. There have even been some who feel that the whole film is just an epic mindf**k, which wouldn't be that surprising coming from an iconoclast like David Lynch. But what is surprising is that most people will admit that they don't fully understand it, and yet they can't get enough of it. Perhaps its popularity can be attributed to the complex plot, or the brilliant acting, or maybe the raw sesuality of Naomi Watts' performance. Whatever the appeal may be, there's no doubt about it, Mulholland Dr. is a provocative, titillating  and mesmerizing trip that you have to experience for yourself. Maybe even more than once.

First, I have not followed the 10 hints in the DVD cover, if indeed the 10 hints are anything but another Lynch spoof. The film must be approached via what Theodor Reik called 'listening with the third ear' (or seeing with the third eye), registering first impressions. Logic won't work, this is more like looking for clues for a rare disease, or trying to discover whether a painting is a fake. The first impression was that I was reminded of 'Persona'. The second thing, represented by the garbage can event, is that dreams are reality here. But what about the older cracked pair at the airport, who were they? Did Dianne use her aunt's money to pay the old guy in the wheelchair to make sure that she was in the film? The 3rd thing is the message of 'Silencio', that the tape/dream keeps running even if the person performing quits playing. So I think Camilla 'dreamed' the whole affair up until she opened the box, at which point 'Betty' disappeared and the tape quit, especially since they both saw 'Betty' as Dianne dead in bed earlier.

1484200,5,B00005JKJA,"When I first began watching Mulholland Drive almost a 11 months ago, I had no David Lynch experience, so I really didn't know what to expect. What I got 147 minutes later was a mix of depression, confusion, amazement, fright, disturbia, trippiness, and the feeling that I had watched something I never seen before! I was a bit confused, but 3 days later, I watched it and finally got it.

Mulholland Drive is a great movie on all levels. It's multi-facted, multi-layered, and very mind-challenging.

So in the beginning we see a bunch of people dancing, and a shot of a pillow, we hear swing music in the dancing scene and someone heavily breathing in the pillow shot. We dissolve and come back out to a woman riding a limo. Who is she? Why is she on Mulholland Drive? We see that the two drivers are hitmen, and will kill her if she doesn't come out of the car. Then the car crashes, and this woman survives.

So to the plot: In one world, a woman wakes up with no memory from the night before, and a woman named Betty comes to the house she wakes up in to look after it. Betty meets this woman, who calls herself Rita after a poster she sees. They try to uncover her identity.

Now another world: Depressed Diane Selwyn is having a horrible life. Her lesbian(?) lover Camilla Rhodes is cheating on her with the director of a movie she's in, and Diane wants Camilla dead.

MD is a very great movie, with a somwehat very deep meaning and is very frightening, hot, thrilling, and if you look into it: fun.

It will provoke emotions ranging from pathos to funny/funny. Naomi Watts gives an unforgettable performance surrounded by marvelous performances.

A movie that keeps challenging you continuously from the beginning to the end, and even years later. David Lynch's best movie. And one of the finest movies ever made. Do not expect to understand everything in the movie when you watch it for the first time. I didn't, and probably, most people don't. I had heard much about this movie before I watched it for the first time. After I finished watching it, I was like, ""What the c**p? What is it trying to say? Doesn't make much sense at all, huh! Pretentious!"". No, it didn't make sense. Everything in the movie seemed so incoherent on the surface. But then, it kept coming back to me. The whole movie kept replaying in my mind. I just couldn't get it out. And slowly, things started making sense. And then, a few days later, ""Whoa! This is amazing. I can't believe this. David Lynch is a genius!"". That was three years ago. Today, the movie has grown on me and still keeps haunting with its bizarre imageries (including the unforgettable last scene).

I don't want to include any spoiler in my review, but let me just say that the movie is actually about a nightmare. This is David Lynch at his best. He has created his own style that no other director can match. Even his other movies look weak compared to this one. The entire cast is great, but I can't help but make a special mention of the amazingly beautiful Laura Harring and the cool Justin Theroux.

I was more intrigued by this film and Lynch's over indulgence was kept to a minimum in this one.  There were less moments there for the sake of being there, even though the end with the old people was vintage Lynch, all the way.

This is a hard film to categorize, it's a psychological thriller, at the same time an erotic thriller, and a pyschological drama.  It's a bunch of things, as Lynch does well.  Plus, there's more than enough Lynch moments to satisfy the fan and enough non Lynch moments to satisfy the non fan.  It will take you for a ride and never let go.

The only extra is the theatrical trailer, there's not even a chapter search, really makes you watch the film.  But I'd rather have a chapter feature to go back and find my favorite moments.

1484261,4,B00005JKJA,"My first experience to the mind and films that are David Lynch was Lost Highway which personally was just a mess and not only did I not understand it, but it didn't even hold my interest and looking back, I can't remember a thing about it. However, like a lot of times, you just feel like watching a specific movie and for some reason, that was Mulholland Drive so I thought ""eh, why not?"" so I decided to check it out and while I had to look up what the hell happened and have people explain it to me, I was still hooked into the story and it didn't feel its length or felt confusing for the sake of it.

Keep in mind, this is Lynch stuff so take these with a grain of salt. But anyway, the film opens with an unnamed actress getting into a car wreck on Mulholland Drive in Hollywood. Dazed, she wonders into town and sneaks into a house where aspiring actress Betty is staying. The 2 meet and Bette tries to help the woman, who calls herself Rita, get her memory back. Meanwhile, a film director named Adam Kesher is getting pushed to cast an actress, Camilla Rhodes, into the film and they're incredibly adamant. The film is evidence that things aren't always what they seem and it's the case with the story as well.

David Lynch is the kind of film director where you can't tell if he's just confusing by accident thanks to movie making ineptitude, whether he's a skilled storyteller who likes to skew things just a tad or he's just pretentious and writes as if no one can understand his stuff unless you're him. While the latter was what I felt about Lost Highway, this film feels a bit more confident in its storytelling and despite its strangeness, seems more easier to follow. Of course there's also Lynch's habit of not explaining at all any of his films so any ""interpretations"" are strictly widely-accepted so people can have different views on what the film really means.

What makes the film a joy to watch is the acting with Naomi Watts and Laura Harring providing most of the legwork and they're just as superb. My only gripe is Justin Theroux who I can't really peg as a character and he doesn't really feel as in-depth as Betty and Rita feel. Not only that but several characters are introduced and disappear just as quickly so even though they're meant to make a certain feeling, you can't help but be annoyed some characters get dropped from the story entirely.

While I can understand Lynch's tendency to skip commentaries or making-of's, it'd be fine if it had chapter stops since you don't want to re-watch 2 and a half hours if you have classes to go to when you're at the 2nd hour mark and start over.

Originally written and filmed as a TV pilot, the ending was only written after the show was rejected. Knowing the history of the genesis of the film only increased my appreciation for its craft, because the ending qualitatively transforms the entire first three quarters of the film. I cannot comprehend how Lynch was able to think of an ending that turned the whole first part of the film on its head, making it meaningful on a completely different, and more subtle layer.

For first time viewers, I can only say that it's important to pay attention to the whole film. Every shot. Colours, symbols, recurring objects and motifs, all play a part in revealing the film's secrets. I can't recommend this movie highly enough.",1193356800,7,940,4.725609756097561

As it stands, this film is clearly one of the greatest films of all time (though not better than ""Les Enfants du Paradis"", my favorite film per se).

This review is to give you an idea of what the film and DVD are about, not to explain the story to you. The film is a multi-dimensional one, with parallel stories going on at one time. If you like surreal, dark and moody films with a film-noir touch, you'll love this. However, don't go in expecting to understand it all at once. You probably won't, and thats quite normal. The beauty of this movie is that yes, you will end it quite confused and wondering if anything made sense, but what I really like is that you can have multiple explanations as to what actually is going on, and ALL of these explanations will be quite valid.

Naomi Watts stars in the best performance of her career - never has the actress been more luminous (not even in her 'well-lit' scenes in 'King Kong'), and she shares screen time with another breakout star, Justin Theroux, who comes into his own in a brilliant performance here. The rest of the cast is uniformly good, and the soundtrack is exceptional.

Rarely do you come across a film that can break across divides and appeal to you intelligence and finer qualities. ""Mulholland Drive"" is that and more. At once classy and sophisticated, and on the other sinister and morbid, this film has elements of all aspects of human nature, which give it a timeless sheen that only gets better with repeated viewing. Take it from me, I've seen this at least twelve times in the last few years, and always feel like I have more to learn about it.

Get this if you like movies in your collection that you want to watch again. And Five Stars for both Justin Theroux and David Lynch.

On the flipside, this DVD has no chapter-stops, so you need to manually fast-foward to get where you want to for a particular scene. This has never bothered me as I watch the whole thing in a go each time I pop it in. Others have found this an issue, but I recommend that you look beyond this minor flaw and purchase this anyway.",1190505600,2,2280,4.458033573141487

I've watched this movie many times. It really requires concentration, and I think it has to be watched several times. I don't like long reviews for movies I haven't seen, so I'll be brief for those who haven't seen ""Mulholland Drive.""

The movie begins with a young women is sitting in the backseat of a fancy car at night. The car pulls over, and just as one of the men in the front seat is about to shoot her, a carload of teenagers crashes into them, killing them all except for the young women. The woman wanders down the hill to Mulholland Drive, sleeps outside behind some shrubs, then sneaks into a condo, where she is found by the new resident (another young woman--actually the same woman).

Like I say, you just have to watch the movie several times to catch everything. It's very strange with some fantastic scenes.

The cowboy scene is worth the whole movie. It's really funny, but done in a deadly serious manner. Super!",1190160000,3,986,4.617142857142857
1484308,4,B00005JKJA,"Wow, what a strange film. It's a David Lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird.

I defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. I can't be done. After some research following my second viewing of this film several years ago, I pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. So, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad; that's normal. Let me just say the key to the film is Naomi Watts' character.

At any rate, I find the film fascinating, no matter how many times I watch it. I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la Lynch's ""Blue Velvet."" There also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. In all, it's very well scored.

The theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.",1190073600,,1079,4.358208955223881
1484309,5,B00005JKJA,"I like this film very much, I'm not sure if it really makes sense but I don't think it is necessarily supposed to - its making appears to have been an organic process that is more or less open to cohesive interpretation.

I don't think clarity or coherence is necessarily a weakness however, adult viewers, generally, don't want to be spoon-fed the plot details - it is much more satisfying to work out what is going on and be able to offer various different assessments of what that is. Ultimately such a film is liable to tell us something of our own fears and stage of development in life as we attempt to apprehend a thread.

The central themes revolve around identity, self-delusion, lack of control. We aspire to become something better and beyond what we are and often delude ourselves into thinking that we can become more than we in reality can be. The character(s) of Betty/Diane is in an amalgam of a dream, hallucination or delusional state but it might also be seen that all the characters are figments of a dream/illusion that is not being dreamt by anyone in particular - in this film the unreality particularly pertains to the Hollywood dream factory, but it could equally apply, albeit in generally less strong measure, to all walks of life.
People change and exchange roles all the time, we move to different places, different work environments, different situations and we attempt to fit in or to impose ourselves on our new situations. A measure of how successful we are in fitting in relates to the extent to which we identify to a bigger perspective at the expense of individuality. Constraints on such success are often beyond our control, we rationalize our existence and lie a little to ourselves in order to fit in to the new 'objectified' world that we perceive that is ultimately illusory...the 'wahn' - an emergent higher order perception that exists only within the confounds of the particular environment.
Sometimes things happen that break us out of this 'wahn', this illusion, and we become self-aware - that is we perceive how different we are and in what ways we do not fit in... our perception of the illusory world becomes internalized and we thus have, and simultaneously question, our individual identity.
The characters in Mulholland Drive, at different stages in the film, exhibit loss of such individual identity. 'Rita' does not know who she is but aptly labels herself with the first name of a famous actress, her confident character Camilla Rhodes in the latter third of the film is really just a product manufactured by Hollywood, she has found her place at the expense of her sense of self. Betty is a confident and independent character aspiring to be a part of the Hollywood dream. When, in the latter third, she becomes Diane, it is not clear if her life as Betty was a dream or perhaps a somewhat glossed sense of herself as confident newby apt to fit into Hollywood but whose ultimate frustration at not being accepted by Hollywood led to pained internalized perception of the world - Diane possibly being a new name that she chooses in order to fit in but without success. Adam Kescher fits in by accepting his lack of identity in the film project over which he thought he originally had some control - he becomes another product of Hollywood who loses interest in artistic integrity as an expression of individual identity. His sense of self becomes occluded in the 'wahn', individual reality drowned by an externalized bigger re-presentation of the world imposed by the Hollywood dream factory and commercial interests.
Essentially we see dreams and aspirations of fitting into some bigger picture soaking up individual identity and control.

This is how I identify with the film. I think it is one thread but I don't pretend to offer a definitive interpretation of a film which probably does not yield this. The use of music and cinematography speaks to us at the level of the subconscious: the strangely spooky black monster, the clairvoyant woman, the club silencio - all evocative and seemingly demonstrative of our fears relating to lack of both self-knowledge and 'external reality'.",1189900800,3,4144,4.850282485875706
1484310,5,B00005JKJA,"The first time I saw Mullholland Drive, I was impressed by it, but also more than a little confused, like many viewers, specially in the second part of the movie. After watching it two more times, I believe it is a true masterpiece, with a wonderful clockwork screenplay: many things that look arbitrary in a first viewing, came neatly into place after repeated sightings. The movie is structured in two parts (SPOILERS INCLUDED, don't read if you haven't yet seen it): a real part and a dream part. While the real part comes first chronologically, Lynch shows the dream first. In the ""real"" part, Diane (Naomi Watts) is one of those many girls that arrived in Hollywood from small towns throughout North America dreaming of getting a big break in the silver screen. Unfortunately for her, she is a mediocre actress. In a casting, she meets another actress called Camila (Laura Harring), who gets the main role. They become friends, get to live together, and eventually fall in love. Camila becomes successful in town, and she helps Diane in getting small roles in the movies she stars in. But Camila falls in love with one of her directors, Adam, so she and Diane splits bitterly. Some time later, Camila invites Diane to a party, where she is humiliated by the guests, and becomes silently enraged when Camila and Adam become engaged. In that party, she mets a few individuals (a man with a cowboy hat, Adam's mother) that would later appear in her dreams, in another roles. (Here Lynch deftly understands the logic of dreams, where people one knows usually appear under different names or roles). After the party, Diane hires a hit-man to kill Camila. He tells her that when the job is done, he will drop a blue key under her door. When Diane later finds the key and becomes aware than Camila is dead, she becomes remorseful, and shots herself. As she agonizes between life and death, Diane has a last dream, which is the first part of the movie. In the dream, Diane is the great actress she wishes she has been. As in the real part, she arrives in Hollywood for a movie career, but unlike reality, in the dream she is talented and successful. In her apartment, she founds an amnesic woman (who has the face of Camila). As for Adam, since she hates him for being engaged with Camila, she imagines him in horrible situations, cheated by his wife, being forced by mobsters in making his movies in a way he doesn't like. The cowboy Diane met at the party appears here as scaring Adam into picking another actress for the main role in the movie. The hit-man she hired is presented as impossibly clumsy, perhaps in her secret desire that he didn't do his job well. There are many things more, but I hope you get the idea of the structure present in the movie, and why it is not arbitrary but has its own impeccable logic. This is Lynch's best film, with a superb screenplay, and a nifty understanding of dream logic.",1189728000,3,2914,4.595009596928983

What is important about this film is that it depicts a certain truth that no other film has ever achieved: DEPICTS THE SUPERNATURAL STRANGENESS OF GOING TO THE SUPERNATURAL ""OTHER SIDE"" for fame and fortune.  Expert landscaping of Hollywood, covering Mind Control, Handlers, controllers, where power comes from, the satanic system and how it is propagated...

More important, Lynch shows what happens to people who rebel once they have sold their souls.

I believe that Lynch here is a prophet screaming in the wilderness about a reality that he knows--now he can't just outright tell you.  So he disguises much of it in confabulistic imagery and metaphor...but for those who know, IT IS THE REAL THING.

I am surprised they released it, but Lynch fooled them.  If you want to know how it works in Hollywood from a supernatural-mind-control-soul scalping perspective...see it.  As for the sex... it's psycho-sex... not gratuitous sex... everything in this film advances the plot, the point of which is: YOU CANNOT WIN. No one wins in Hollywood.  You just prolongue losing.

There are several versions of the devil depicted in the film--all of whom run Hollywood and all of whom are the same character.  See if you can spot them.  Hint. One resides outside by the dumpster of Mr. Winkie's diner, ruling the world. The other is a cowboy.  In my opinion, these are all the same Person.

1484362,5,B00005JKJA,"Genuinely worthy of the intense critical debate that has surrounded it, MULHOLLAND DR is certainly one of the richest American films released in years. The film signals David Lynch's return to the lush cinematographic palette of BLUE VELVET and the first episode of TWIN PEAKS, and a tying together of the themes more loosely (and less satisfactorily) explored in LOST HIGHWAY. The film's twin narrative sections, both centering around Naomi Watts (in a literally star-making performance) have been hugely discussed, with the greatest critical consensus centering around the idea that the first three-quarters of the film are a dream fantasy of the Diane Selwyn character (played by Watts) in the movie's latter section, but even that seems too easy. In some ways, the inability of ever finding a central core meaning to the film seems underscored by the empty blue box that draws the Rita character into its void.

Whatever its central narrative logic, the film is clearly about the promises of Hollywood success and their attendant dangers of failure and humiliation; it also centers upon the attractions of inauthenticity. better than even his other films, Lynch's work here evokes the uncanny with almost incredible power: in the confrontation with the bum behind Winkie's, the disturbing elderly couple smiling too intensely in their ride out of the airport, the ""Sixteen Reasons"" lipsyncing number, and the whole extended Club Silencio sequence. Although all the performances are quite fine, it's really Watts, in the dual roles of Betty and Diane, who pulls the whole thing together: in the first part of the movie she makes Betty's earnestness deeply funny, and in the second section she makes Diane's misery extraordinarily upsetting.",1177891200,4,1743,5.26978417266187

I had to watch this twice while doing research on the film in between viewings to really get a sense of what was going on, but even so, this was a great flick and VERY creative.

The plot is basically about the broken dreams of an aspiring actress that play themselves out with a mix of reality and dream sequences that are fun to watch unravel. Naomi Watts did a fantastic job playing two completely different characters and you cared for BOTH of them but in different ways. The ""side"" characters were fun and I liked how in some way they all were directly involved with the master plot.  While the ending certainly made me scratch my head the first time around, a careful viewing really does make sense of it...well.... sort of!  Thats whats cool here.... you can make your interpretations as to what everything might mean as there are several theories about what happens to the main character and why things happen as they do. Damn, theres even a website devoted to the movie that allows open discussion but I warn you NOT to spend too much time on that site( search google for mulholland drive and you'll find the website )until you've drawn your own conclusions or it might ruin it for you.  Anyways, great movie, great characters, great twists and turns.  What else can I say?  I laughed at times, almost cried once, felt terrible for the main character but also resented her too in a way. This film is crazy with its emotional roller-coaster and metaphoric imagery. Oh, and it doesnt hurt that Laura Harring and Naomi Watts are fabulous babes either.... that was just icing on the cake.

Also, this film has a sequence towards the end that is spectacular and ripe with emotion. It left me almost breathless and shook-up. Its really ""haunting"" but not in a scary way, more in a .... well.... you'll know what I mean when you watch this film.

That being said, this film is NOT for impatient idiots that cant sit still for 10 minutes and have to be spoon fed their plots and solutions like an infant. Watch this when you feel like ""getting into"" a movie, not just when you want to burn two hours on a rainy night with nothing else to do. Expect to be confused at first and expect to watch it a few times to get the most out of it.

Not to mention the acting genius Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the leading roles with Justin Theroux et al. Simply put, this is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece for all time. Lynch explored some of the surrealistic tecniques is his amazing, early 1970s masterpiece Eraserhead.

 While playing upon the audience's sense of time, Lynch often, and with no warning, removes all defined space. Lynch, in Mulholland Drive, combines the best in film history--vis-a-vis Bunuel, Dahli, Kubrick, Hitchcock, some Felliniesque and also with an homage to Ingmar Bergman (Persona), and even some Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz) moments as well--to create a cinematic splendor that is unsurpassed by any living filmmaker.

""No Hay Banda,"" indeed, because what we wish to see, live and hear is not necessarily what we experience, except in our imaginations that are unlocked--not just by a royal-blue key left on a coffee table-- by suspending disbelief while still holding onto the seat of your (intellectual) pants.

What exactly happened at Mulholland Drive: this is a puzzle that Lynch presents, a gift of magnificent proportions. Mulholland Drive is for people that like to sit and think constantly, but anyone can enter the world of Mulholland Drive like Alice through the Looking Glass (and there are traces of the great writer-artist-logician Lewis Carroll here, as well, to be sure).

Naomi Watts shines in two different roles and I am always amazed by her acting. Lynch abandons much of the dark humor of his Twin Peaks period and proves he can do it either way.

(FYI: He played it straight with FWWM also {a departure from the series} - many were burned out on Lynch at the time this film came out and should see it again - his best and the best, most frightening horror film ever made IMHO.)",1167868800,,582,4.490566037735849
1484420,5,B00005JKJA,"(4.5/5 stars)  Even though I find David Lynch's work stylish, bizarre and enjoyable, I have never really found it to reveal considerable intelligence. Much of it (""Twin Peaks,"" ""Blue Velvet,"" ""Wild At Heart"") appears to be a drug-induced, post-modern faade, behind which very little substance is hidden. It is usually entertaining for a while, but it ultimately grows tiresome. Then he writes and directs ""Mulholland Drive,"" which shocks me with its complexity. Here he marries his penchant for peculiarity with a serious plot, and the result is a film replete with twists, turns and enough suspense to hold anyone's interest. Given enough time, plenty of people could write a similarly interwoven tale, yet the brilliance of this film is that Lynch is able to incorporate his inimitable panache that belies its intricacies. He was very deserving of all the accolades he reaped as a result of this film. Discussion of the plot is best reserved for those who have seen the film, so it would be remiss of me to reveal any of it here. I just hope it is not too much to say that Naomi Watts does an outstanding job playing the distinctly different characters involved; her performance during the audition really had me riveted.

1484490,5,B00005JKJA,"I admit at first viewing this movie, I saw Betty, Naomi Watts initial character, to be a literal character and not someone in a dream Diane was having. In other reviews here, that is realized. It's a little disturbing to see it that way, but we are all dreamers, and sometimes the way we would like to be or think we are isn't the way others see it. Our internal world is vast and much more relavent than our outer selves, though I agree there should be balance between the two with a certain level head to reality. Mulholland Drive is purely a dream and then a disturbing ""reality"". It's beautifully done. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring were the right image and voice. They are another way to see the way we are sometimes, whether we are male or female, our internal world is both, and this really displays another side of us for us to understand. I really care about Betty in this movie. I admit there is a side of me that has come to understand that my way is sometimes the same as hers. It goes with trying to understand ourselves. She has all this energy to give to others, and an honest trust in anyone. We never grow up, it seems. Laura Elena Harring's character is that side of us that goes on, clueless to the past and stuck to present circumstances. It's devastating to be brought to wonder ""who am I?"" after all we've known and been through. If you can understand this much, you'll take a lot from this movie. I looked up Roy Orbison's lyrics to Crying. A good touch to the story. Overall, this will leave you wondering why God made us so desperate for heaven, or clueless to it.

The plot is far too complicated and twisty to get into, and frankly has been gone over with a fine tooth comb already on this site.

These clues are helpful only if you have watched the whole movie :)

In the beginning the movie zooms into a sleeping woman which means the coming up things are dream (dream of Diane (in dream her name is Betty) which she would only ""dream"" in real life):
1. The car accident of Rita (real life Camellia; girl friend of Diane) which was almost similar to that one night in real life of Diane when Camellia broke her heart breaking up with her and announcing her marriage with a movie director. It was no less than a worse accident for Diane, which she wanted Camellia to experience. So there is Rita only survivor of a bad car wreck.
2. In real life Camellia is a vamp so Diane dreams Rita/ Camellia with lost memory. That makes Rita very innocent and loyal to her the opposite of real life.
3. In real life Camellia is helping Diane getting movie roles but in the dream Betty (real life Diane) is helping Rita.
4. In dream Betty is full of life and acting talent but in reality Diane is just opposite.
5. In reality Diane had come from Canada to her Aunt place where she is living; so she dreams about going to her aunt house where she meets Rita.
6. The director in the dream is the one Camellia is going to marry and once in a party Diane overheard the director saying ""I get the pool and you get the pool man"", which she dreams later. She dreams lot bad for the poor director.
7. She also dreams that there has been lots of conflict going on between director's and producer's choice to cast the lead actress. This shows the competition between Diane and Camellia in real life. Camellia is the director choice.
8. The hit man is the one she hired to kill Camellia.
9. The cowboy is still a puzzle; he appears 3 times in the movie.
10. Betty and Rita discovering a body (of Diane???) is also puzzle.
11. The restaurant scene with the scary guy is still a puzzle to me.
12. The Silencio club part of the movie is a hint for the viewers and gives Betty the puzzle box for which she has the key.

When Rita unlocks the blue box, the reality starts:
1. Diane is in horrible condition as she missed Camellia.
2. She knows that Camellia has been murdered because the hit man has returned her the blue key.
3. She is so paranoid that she kills herself.

So basically Diane who lost her GF (Camellia) and had her murdered is dreaming a better world till the Silencio club part of the movie. When she wakes up she realizes her mistake and kills herself.",1161216000,6,2706,4.320866141732283
1484495,1,B00005JKJA,"Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.

I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English (""Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?"") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.

To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of ""...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking..."" or ""...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking..."" but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.

Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!

Naomi Watts gives one of the greatest performances of all time. Her character goes through the most amazing changes, all utterly convincing. Her ""movie audition"" is especially stunning. MULHOLLAND DRIVE is confusing the first time through, but after watching it a couple of times it all comes together. Unlike, for example, LOST HIGHWAY, this is a completely realistic plot, with no supernatural or unexplainable elements. Originally this was a pilot for a TV show a la Twin Peaks. Lynch then changed it to make it a movie, so there are some loose ends. There are also some lengthly dream sequences (Lynch gives only subtle clues to tell us that what's dream and real, but there are clues, and the distinction is clear), some flashbacks which are out of order, and some psychotic delusions presented from the perspective of the psychotic person. Nevertheless, the events are all completely possible (dreams do happen, people are subject to psychotic delusions, and memories or flashbacks can happen out of order), even plausible.

1484556,2,B00005JKJA,"I think Lynch wants desperately to teach us something to us in this film. I think he's like 'look at all of you, how you're living, all your petty desires leading you to ruin'. His personal frustrations come out in the film, with Hollywood, with us 'peons', with fake people, with society.

 The film is intellectually interesting, and yes you are strung along by the film for 2/3 of the movie then when it twists you do learn something of how we grasp and desire things. We want the happy ending without effort. The effortless Hollywood ending. And the abruptness that Lynch turns on us is supposed to teach us a lesson about this and show us that in reality theres always someone with more power and more desires than you have.

 Thats my problem with the film it seems excessively contrived and intellectual to make a point about our frailties. Ok I get it David we're weak, muddled, desirous. And often these qualities lead us to ruin. I can stick my head out the window and understand this. I don't need a multi-millionare intellectual to shove this in my face. You are not sitting in judgement of the human race David Lynch, you are here to serve humanity like the rest of us you are not above it.

 Thats really what I question about Lynch and this film. Is this film really serving the audience. Or is it serving Lynch's frustrations and worldview.

 Frankly I'm tired of chasing Lynch's phantasmal imagery, I don't care what red pillow represents intellectually. I don't care what the midget behind the glass represents intellectually.

1484559,5,B00005JKJA,"I'm not sure I buy the literal interpretations of the movie above.  Lynch was never one to let you in on all his secrets, and this movie proves every bit as elusive as any of his films.  One does get the sense this is a dream within a dream, a la Edgar Allen Poe, as reality becomes subjective in this movie.  Lynch seemed to relish toying with the idea of a Hollywood starlet, played to perfection by Naomi Watts in what has to be her standout performance.  She covers virtually the full range of emotions in her character(s).  But, if you are looking for any clear resolution to the movie you will be disappointed.

The majority of the film plays out in linear fashion, a bit too comfortably, as the darker elements seep into various scenes.  One patiently waits for the walls to cave in and when they do, they do so in such a devastating manner that one is really hit by the severity of the film, especially as played out by Naomi Watts.  Whereas her emotions were much more tightly controlled in the body of the movie, they are deeply visceral in the concluding segment, which does lead one to assume that it is all too real what is now happening.

However, I get the feeling that dream and reality overlap between the two segments, and that one can reassemble the pieces in any number of ways.  Whatever the case, the movie is mesmerizing to watch, both in Naomi Watts brilliant performance, and Lynch's marvelous command of this fractured cinematic fairy tale.",1156291200,3,1466,4.518939393939394

I just got finished watching this film for the first time and I must say that it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, yet I'm really not sure what I wanted to see.  I had no knowledge of this film's plot, I just had heard so much about it, rave reviews mostly for Naomi's brilliant performance, so I had to watch it for myself.

I do want to mention first and formost that all the praise Naomi has recieved for this film is just and she was wrongfully denied the Oscar nomination...when she should not only have been nominated but WON...

Now...

The opening sequence gives us a car crash that ends up bringing two very different women together.  Rita (Laura Elena Harring), the sole survivor of the crash, is suffering from amnesia and ends up stumbling into an apartment belonging to Ruth Elms.  Ruth is away starring in a film and has lent her apartment to her niece Betty (Naomi Watts) who stumbles on Rita when arriving at her new home.  The two bond shortly thereafter and Betty decides to try and help Rita regain her memory.

In the meantime Betty is pursuing her acting career, auditioning for part after part, one of them being a film being helmed by director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux).  Adam's life has been falling apart piece by piece, starting with his film being taken out of control, the lead actress forced upon him, his wife is found cheating on him with the pool man, his bank accounts are zeroed out and there are threats made on his life.

This all adds up in the end...

The only name's that Rita can remember are `Diane' and `Mulholland Drive', the latter being the place of her accident, and the former being the name of someone she knew, someone who may know her and so Rita and Betty venture to find this woman to get some answers.  What they find is not what you, I or even they expected.

The first two hours of this film are summed up in a sequence taken place at Club Silencio.  Here we are told that everything is prerecorded, everything is phony, fake, and it may not click right then, but soon you will understand what they're getting at, and when the identity of Diane is revealed within the last half hour of the film everything will make perfect sense.  What makes `Mulholland Drive' so extraordinary is that is challenges the viewer to forget what they think they know and just let it all sink in.  If you watch this film trying to put the pieces together, trying to understand the plot twist then you'll miss the whole point.

Who are the mysterious men (including an apparent mastermind in a wheelchair) behind her unlikely rise to stardom? Who's the skanky guy who lives behind the restaurant. Why are the plot and delivery so stilted? What is the mysterious blue box?

David Lynch has put together a movie that can't always be followed but is always fascinating to watch. Characters, settings and objects surface again and again but in new and illuminating contexts. The level of suspense is incredibly high, and the degree of deliberate artifice just adds to the overall weirdness if the film.

Nothing special about the DVD unless you want to watch the very misleading theatrical trailer. The film has no chapter divisions, so don't make the mistake (as I did) of turning it off partway through. You'll have to fast-forward through the entire film to regain your place!

1484565,4,B00005JKJA,"Somewhere in between our most fervent passions and deepest fears winds a long road upon which we all must travel.  For some who go the distance, the journey may lead to self actualization but for others, the slightest diversion can mean total destruction.  David Lynch is no stranger to the lonely road metaphor (Lost Highway) and in Mullholland Drive, he created another dream felt portrait of good intentions gone wrong, very wrong.  As in many of his other works, visual imagery peppered with stilted conversation takes precedence over plot.  Plot is secondary to the creation of a mood in any particular scene, with lighting, musical score and camera angles all engineered to cast a mood or evoke a feeling rather than to move the action forward.  Such devices are appropriate in a film where popular belief lends the theory that the majority of events take place in the dreams of the main character, Diane Selwyn a.k.a Betty Elms.  Like faded morning memories of a dream, we recall more of the emotion felt than the actual events; the terror of a nightmare, the sweetness of a love's embrace.

The basic storyline is of a young aspiring actress who arrives in Hollywood to pursue her acting career after winning a jitter bug contest in her home town in Canada (Deep River, Ontario and Blue Velvet reference).  The ""dream actress"" takes the name Betty Elms, a name borrowed by the `real' actress, Diane Selwyn, from a waitress's name tag in a diner.  Similar to the classic, ""Wizard of Oz,"" the last scenes in the movie suggest real time events and people that become embodied in Diane's dreams.  Diane Selwyn has been torn up by Hollywood and spit out by its rising stars, her lover included, who jilts her for an influential director.  Diane decides to avenge this betrayal by hiring a hit man to kill her girlfriend/actress, Camilla Rhodes.  The guilt of commissioning this crime ultimately consumes Diane and she is lead to suicide.  Conversely,  in her dream state, Diane's wish fulfillment of what her place in Hollywood would have been is actualized by stellar auditions, palatial living quarters and a deep, gratifying love.

The movie begins with an automobile accident presumably taking place on or leading to Mullholland Drive from which a dark haired beauty survives (and who we later discover is likely the ""dream version"" of Camilla Rhodes and a paradox to the ""real actress,"" as nave, innocent and submissive.)  This woman, dazed from the impact and drawn by the city lights below, meanders her way back into the city and ultimately into the apartment of Betty's aunt who has left on an extended vacation.  Betty arrives as her aunt's invitee while the aunt, an apparent successful actress, is away as a place to accommodate herself while she settles into L.A.  Upon her arrival, Betty discovers this woman who has suffered amnesia from the accident and names herself ""Rita"" after glancing at a Rita Hayworth poster that hang's in the absentee aunt's bathroom.

Meanwhile, seemingly collateral events unfold with a famous director being bullied by ominous but nondescript forces to cast a particular actress in his new film.  The same director discovers his wife in bed with his `pool boy' and ultimately finds himself bankrupt.  Other non-linear events take place as the audience is shifted around through an apparent conspiracy against the director, an inept hit man that carries out a botched hit against a friend and the developing mystery of the identity of the woman Betty finds in her aunt's apartment, as the pair embark on a quest to solve the puzzle.  Also woven in, is an eerie scene in a diner (the same diner where we later learn Diane has hired the hit man) where a man recites to another man, a recurring nightmare that he has of a decrepit being that lives at the rear of the property, possibly a physical emobdiment of the evil that occurred in the diner, the payment for the hit.

Confusing?  No doubt, as Lynch seems to string his audience along into believing that the various sequences are all somehow related.  Ultimately, one scene near the end of the film seems to suggest that we are being misled and perhaps provides the ""key"" to all of  the various goings on.  Leading up to this scene that takes place in what appears to be a secret night club by the name of, ""Club Silencio,""  Betty and Rita's chase for Rita's real identity leads to the discovery of a dead body.  This body is an image that is repeated at various times during the movie and is likely the body of Diane in various states; deep slumber, rising and perhaps death after she commits suicide.  The pair sexually consummate their evolving friendship after this trauma and Rita awakens in the early morning hours uttering the name of the club, ""silencio, silencio"" beckoning Betty to go the club with her, as if drawn by some unseen force.  The two sit at this club while a Spanish speaking MC of sorts tells the audience, ""No ay banda!"" or ""There is no band!""  We hear music but the man repeatedly tells the audience that it is, ""all an illusion.""  The pair clutch each other in sadness as they watch a female vocalist (who we learn is lip synching -- all part of the illusion) sing a Spanish version of  ""Crying"" with such emotion that she succumbs to collapse on the stage.

As Lynch has never publicly unraveled the mysteries of the movie, public opinion is abound as to importance of the Silencio scene as perhaps the turning point of the film.  Is Lynch reminding us in this scene that it is all an illusion?  Is this a broad commentary on Hollywood and all of its players that we photograph, quote and idolize at every turn?  The darkness of the club reminds us of an underlying and terrifying truth, that all is not well and that there is malevolence beneath the melodies we hear and the show that invites us.  Of course, as Lynch is the master of unease, this scene is all but redundant of what the viewer has already been pounded with at every turn.  At the end of the scene Betty and Rita pull out a blue box, a prop that recurs throughout the movie as some sort of symbolic grail that will unlock all of the mysteries.  When the pair return to the apartment, Rita unlocks the box, Betty disappears and blackness envelops the screen.  The remainder of the movie is perhaps in 'real time' as we see events that possibly lead up to the arrangement of the hit including scenes in Diane's actual apartment where she is betrayed by her lover and summoned from to Mulholland Drive, the scene of a humiliating dinner party.  The dinner party scene revisits the characters of the dream both central and periphery as Diane suffers through this sequence to learn that Camilla has become engaged to the director.  In this scene, we see the motivations for the dream, turning the powerful into the powerless, the mighty into the weak.  The final scenes in the movie perhaps appropriately intertwine both realistic images and fantasy as a demonic like presence seems to overtake Diane's soul driving her to suicide.

Mulholland Drive is a long strange trip indeed, at over two hours in length of often snail's pace action.  No one really seems to reach their destination on Mullholland Drive and yet we travel through with some expectation that we will be lead to clarity.  Perhaps this is both illusion and ironic truth etched by the writer/director as we allow ourselves to long for some enlightenment that might arrive while losing the journey.",1153008000,5,7453,4.732198142414861
1484596,5,B00005JKJA,"From the very first frame of the movie I knew this was going be a movie experince unlike any other.

The opening scene if the attempted murder and the collision tragedy was quite a lot to take in for an opening sequence, but knowing David Lynch's work, its all part of the filmmaking.

First you see a posh looking woman in the back of limo. Flicking back through scenes there is a group of youngsters racing down the side of hill.

The limo stops and out comes the front passenger with a pistol points to the woman in the back of the limo.

Before you know it, the youngters eradicately driving about collide with the limo killing the other two people holding the woman hostage.

The woman walks (or crawls I should say) away from the wreck with no memory of anything at all.

On from there embarks a weird, suspenseful and innovative adventure which only Lynch can direct.

Supremely acted by the director (in the movie) who at first has a nerdy and shallow attitude, he becomes of my favorite characters ever to slew their presence in screenplay.

All in all this movie really gets your mind racing. While some things may seem awkward an unnecessary, there is reasoning behind it all.

1484598,3,B00005JKJA,"Well what can I say.  Right off the bat, watching the movie, I had a very strong sense of watching Twin Peaks, mostly due to atmosphere.  I haven't seen any other David Lynch movies, so it could just be his style.  I really didn't like the movie for the first 2 hours.  Was like a cheap episode of Murder She Wrote. However, once you get to the last half-hour, you see it was that way on purpose.  Can't say I enjoyed it anymore knowing this. So why more then 1star?  Well, I do like movies that are different.  This is defiantly not what it seems, and you have to watch it more then once to get a better understanding of what you just saw.

All in all, I wouldn't add it to my collection, but it is worth seeing.  I'd say rent it as a 7day rental, that will give you time to dwell on it, and rewatch it a few times.  Once done with it tho, I don't have the desire to see it again.",1150502400,,881,3.9545454545454546

Just to make sure I wasn't a complete imbecile, I watched it again.  And again... and again... and I haven't stopped watching it since I found out what the hell it was about.  I mean, this is a movie where a lesbian love scene actually has something to do with the plot.  Intriguing, I know.  If you've seen it and think it sucked, or heard it was terrible from a friend, do yourself a favor and watch it a couple more times.

Pandora's Box definitely opened in Mulholland Drive. Applying that story to a modern situation is intriguing and makes for an interesting film. The character development is excellent, though confusing at first, (the who's who was challenging). There are segments that are difficult to figure out, but that's what makes a Lynch film stand out from other movies. And that's what I enjoy. If you're a Lynch fan, you'll eat up this movie.

1484601,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch is the most brilliantly innovative and interesting filmmaker working today, and Mulholland Drive is yet another masterpiece.  Beautiful, ugly, poignant, haunting, hilarious, dark, nightmarish, mesmerizing, thought-provoking, puzzling, confounding.

Is it a horror film?  Like all things in the Lynchian universe, the answer is an emphatic: yes and no.

What's the story about?  The more proper question is: Is there a story?  Again, there is and there isn't.

Mulholland Drive is not so much a story as a series of events, veering off into divergent tangents, surrealistically (but only partially) interconnected, sometimes returning on a Mobius strip in new form, sometimes dropped and forgotten, or lingering on a subconscious level.

Welcome to Lynch's dark and beautiful nightmare.  You either love it or hate it.

Like Lynch's Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive opens in a hyper-idealized America.  A perky all-American girl (from Canada) with stars in her eyes wins a jitterbug contest -- 1950s kitsch in a contemporary America permeated with anachronistic sensibilities.  She arrives in Los Angeles, seen resplendently through her naive eyes.

That's Betty (from Archie comics?) played by Naomi Watts.  In Mulholland Drive, Betty's brunette foil is Rita (Laura Harring).

Rita hails from L.A. noir.  A dark femme fatale riding in the back seat of a car, moving languorously, hypnotically, down Mulholland Drive.  Rita's mysterious identity is compounded by her attempted murder.  Then a strikingly brutal (and seemingly arbitrary) incident drastically alters the course of events.

As in a nightmare.

Lynch is one of the few filmmakers who can pull off such seeming arbitrariness.  His films' narrative subtext, cinematography, art direction, and music create a surreal interconnectedness that fuse events together despite drastic and seemingly arbitrary plot detours.

I don't want to reveal too much.  Mulholland Drive should not be spoiled for those who've yet to see it.

After driving down Mulholland Drive, Rita has amnesia.  She wanders into Betty's house.  Betty -- who came to Hollywood to be star -- takes Rita under her wing.  Like Nancy Drew, Betty is an innocent drawn to adventure.  Innocent, because no modern day Nancy Drew would last long in the dark and violent world Betty is set to enter (and Rita, re-enter).

This is a common Lynchian theme: The innocent who is drawn to dark strangers living corrupt lives under the Disneyfied surface of Americana.  (It is tempting to see Lynch, raised in Montana, as that innocent.)

In Mulholland Drive, Lynch (through Betty) pokes underneath Hollywood's glitter.  Naturally, we find lies, corruption, power plays, egos, exploitation.  The pain and heartbreak beneath Hollywood glitter is an old target, extending back to the similarly titled Sunset Boulevard.  Yet remarkably, Lynch breathes starling new vigor into this well-trod tale.

The Hollywood power plays involve a dwarf in a red room.  And a cowboy, and much else that remains unexplained.  That is what Hollywood feels like for many.  Actors wondering why they were not chosen.  Directors wondering why they were bumped off a project, or why a project was canceled.

Oh yes, Rita has a blue key.  And there is a blue box, reminiscent of Hellraiser's puzzle box.  Mulholland Drive's first hour can best be described as a noir mystery with Lynchian overtones.  That's confusing enough.  But midway through, Rita finds the blue box, and things take a turn into the metaphysical.

Remember when in Twin Peaks, Josie's form emerges from the wall at the Great Northern?  And it's ever explained.  No, that's not what happens with Rita's blue box, but it's in the same territory.  Lynch claims to be fascinated by furniture.  And by music, and much else.  His films are less linear stories than surreal journeys through his dark fascinations.  The latter half of the film journeys deeper into those fascinations.

Mulholland Drive was originally a pilot for an ABC TV series that was never picked up.  It was finished (as a feature film) with French money.  That's one explanation for the sudden turn of events midway through the film.  But once again, Lynch makes it work.

There is so much more in this film, but I won't spoil it by recounting the events.

Do see this film alone, or at worst, with a mature audience.  I saw it at an IFP/ West screening at the L.A. Film School.  No doubt, the crowd imagined itself hip, trendy, sophisticated.  Yet many laughed at the most inappropriate times.  They laughed at Betty's idealized entry into L.A., upsetting the scene's fine balance.  (As in many horror films, Lynch's films establish a delicate tension between unease and humor -- a tension whose beauty and poignancy and unease can easily be weakened and destroyed by inappropriate laughs.)

Yes, Betty is naive, but we are meant to empathize with her vision -- not laugh at her.  Remarkably, the IFP crowd also guffawed at a lesbian scene.  I thought I was surrounded by a crowd of Beavis and Buttheads.

Mulholland Drive was nominated for, but did not make, the Preliminary Ballot of the Horror Writers Association's Bram Stoker Awards.  That is no shame on Lynch.  It does disgrace and cheapen the Stokers.
______________________

PS: While we may all review the final film, and what it means, we should be careful about assuming any ""intent"" on Lynch's part.  This is because Mulholland Drive was never intended as a film.  It was initially shot as the pilot to a TV series that wasn't picked up.  So Lynch took the pilot and, with some additional French investment money (from Canal Plus), expanded the pilot into a film.

That's why it ""gets weird"" later on.  The initial part of the film (the pilot) set up some storylines with specific resolutions in mind.  Then when the series wasn't picked up, an additional hour or so was filmed and edited into the pilot, creating wholly different resolutions (and different storylines) to what had initally been intended.",1149033600,6,6000,5.102986611740474

It's not that I don't understand, it's because I understand and I'm absolutely dazzled by the way David Lynch put together all the little pieces. It's the most beautiful jigsaw I ve ever seen, and it's definitely the most beautiful movie I ve ever watched. David Lynch is the greatest!

1484603,5,B00005JKJA,"It only took 24 hours, one Salon article, two conversations with smart thoughtful people, and twenty minutes of careful reflection on the way to the gym. I finally understand Mulholland Drive. Partially. Well mostly. Well sort of.

It's complicated.

The problem is that there are so many red herrings. And most of them are blue. In a complicated, non-linear, surreal type of movie you kind of expect that everything will be miraculously clarified, resolved, and tied back together in the end. I'm thinking of Memento, and Run Lola Run, and Go, and that episode of the Simpsons, for example. There's a certain expectation that no matter how weird it gets, it'll all be fine, because the director may dangle you over the edge, but he will definitely pull you back. With Mulholland Drive, you have no such assurance. All kinds of stuff is unexplained, and you're left with only a weak grasp of ""what really happened."" But don't sweat it. There's a whole lot of kinda robotic and predictable ""girl love"" scenes to console you.

There are also some familiar elements here. There's the sweet, innocent blonde character and the troubled, abused brunette with the very red lips. Kinda reminiscent of Isabella Rossellini and Laura Dern in Blue Velvet. There is also the soundtrack - very familiar and almost an instant hook-up to that feeling David Lynch movies give you that the bizarre and macabre are right behind the pretty flowers, the nondescript door, the next turn. There are unforgettable scenes here, and I'm sure if I went back through it, and tried to connect the dots, I'd find more scaffolding to help me understand. It's not really necessary though. Taken as an aggregate of its parts, rather than a sum, the movie is still rich and provocative. Nobody makes you feel like this - excited, confused, horrified, complicit, and satisfied - like David Lynch. At the end of the film, I'd rather be surprised and incited than have everything figured out.",1145577600,8,1955,4.882530120481928
1484604,4,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is so strange that it is capativing. I am still a little unsure about this movie. It's offbeat, creepy, and edgy. Naomi Watts is incredible as always. She is such a good actress, i have enjoyed her performances in The Ring 1 and 2 and her oscar-nominated performance in 21 Grams, and as Fray Wray in King Kong. In this film, she plays Betty, an actress from Canada looking for her big break in America. Betty meets a woman who apparently is suffering from amnesia. The two women form a bond with eachother which eventually becomes physical. The movie takes a strange turn halfway through, and well i don't want to give too much away but this movie is worth at least one or two sit-through's. David Lynch is a good writer and director but sometimes you have to wonder what is going on in that brain of his, is he a genius or just plain psychotic? Mulholland Drive, you will either love it or hate it, but i am somewhere in between on this. If you are a fan of Naomi Watts, then go ahead and rent this, she is fabulous in every role that comes her way. There are a lot of clues in this film, so keep your eyes open and see if you can play detective and solve this pecuilar piece of art.",1145491200,,1201,4.248908296943231
1484605,4,B00005JKJA,"One hesitates to say anything with certainty about this complex and disturbing film.  Although David Lynch - beneath all of his bizarre and violent imagery - is ultimately a sentimentalist, it is hard to see the silver lining in this film.  After four viewings, I am still unable to tie up all the loose ends, and am even skeptical that I understand anything at all about this movie.

As I see it, the first two-thirds of the film represent a flashback on the recent events in the life of ""Betty""/Diane Selwyn (wonderfully played by Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress whose career and personal life have gone seriously awry.  Indeed, we eventually find that much of what we thought we knew about Betty/Diane is actually false, and that we have been seeing a self-justifying re-working of her life in which names and faces and facts are jumbled and reassembled into an idealized fiction.  The real facts of her life begin to emerge in the final one-third of the film, yet the actual boundary between fact and fiction always remains unclear.

The film works at several levels - it is simultaneously a psychological study, a metaphysical statement about the relationship between conscience and the dying process, and a satirical look at Hollywood lifestyles and the inner workings of the film industry.

As with most of Lynch's films, there is black humor throughout, as when a triple murder is given comic overtones.  There is also some steamy lesbian sex, along with some typical Lynch touches, as in the sinister but comic figure of ""The Cowboy"" and the creepy movie executives with laughable personal ideosyncrasies. And, as in ""Blue Velvet,"" a Roy Orbison song (""Crying"")is given prominence.

At bottom though, the movie involves a classic love triangle:  Betty/Diane, the beautiful amnesiac Rita (Laura Harring), and the beleagured but ever-cool movie director Adam Kesher (played with aplomb by Justin Theroux, who gives Kesher the look of Elvis Costello).  In Diane's twisted mind, the border between her personality and that of Rita becomes blurred to the point of vanishing, with murderous consequences.

This is a movie of failed dreams, failed romance, and a descent into madness.  Fans of David Lynch will be kept busy trying to put it all together, and will view it over and over;  others will lose patience and move on to more digestible fare.",1144627200,5,2354,4.971938775510204
1484645,5,B00005JKJA,"I know others have explained or tried to explain this movie, but I think we need an explanation review every page. We owe it to this movie.

Here be spoilers:

-The first 3/4 of the movie is a dream.

-The last 1/4 of the movie is the REAL story told in flashbacks.
The real story is this...

-A girl from Canada named Diane moves to L.A. to become an actress after winning a jitterbug contest.(Beats me how jitterbugging can lead to a desire to act.) You see people jitterbugging at the beginning of the movie, then you see Diane winning the contest and posing with the judges/grandparents/elders of the town etc.

-In L.A. she meets another actress named Camilla Rhodes, who beats her out for a movie. Camilla is more popular and more talented.

-Diane falls in love with Camilla, and Camilla in turn gets Diane small parts in her films.

-Camilla eventually dumps Diane for a director named Adam who she is going to marry.

-Diane is so angry and hurt, she hires a hitman to kill Camilla.

-After Diane learns Camilla is dead, she goes into a drug-induced sleep where she dreams the first 3/4 of the film. In her dream she is the talented, loveable one who has to rescue her helpless lover, and where the man who stole the love of her life is financially ruined and stripped of his power by mobsters. Everyone in the dream are people Diane has seen in real life in the days leading up to the hit and her dream.

-After Diane wakes up, she is so shaken with remorse and guilt, she kills herself.

Symbols?

-The monster man behind Winkie's signifies Diane being haunted.

-The old couple are the judges/grandparents from the jitterbug contest and represent her past.

-The blue box and blue key represent the switch from fantasy back to reality.

Hence, the monster letting the couple out of the blue box at the end is the REALITY of her PAST, HAUNTING her, therefore, driving her to suicide.

I didn't need to look this explanation up on the Net. Just watching it a couple of times and actually thinking is what clued me in.

This is my favorite or second favorite movie. I fell in love with Naomi Watts after this. No other film she has done lives up to this one, not even 21 Grams or The Ring. It's sexy, suspenseful, and the film has a beating, quirky heart. It's a legitimate love story.

This movie is surrealistic, just like Follywood, I mean Hollywood. It's supposed to be real, but doesn't quite get there. Just like a dream.",1144022400,42,2436,4.4852607709750565

1484649,2,B00005JKJA,"This movie is in IMDb's top 250 list, and it shouldn't be. There are many movies that I disagree with being on that list, but I can start to understand why they're there. For starters, they're movies with coherent plots that don't require ""clues"" from the director himself to understand.

I first saw this movie about a year and a half ago, the plot was so unnecessarily twisted and the ending so unresolved and incomprehensible that I just assumed that I had missed something along the way, and didn't bother with this again for a year and a half. Well, this movie is so highly regarded, I figured I'd better be fair and give this another shot. This time there was no confusing it, I was left with violent feelings toward the director. Make that FIVE hours of my life David Lynch has stolen.

People who defend this movie claim it has one of the most intricate, multi-faceted story lines ever, and that that's the beauty of the movie, the symbolism and all that crap. Had the director not given you those 10 clues, would you have figured it out yourself? Well if you did, then that's your version of the story, and chances are, you're wrong. There are many movies that are open-ended and left to the viewer to interpret, but the difference here is that this ENTIRE movie is open, not just the ending. You might as well let people write their own scripts if it's gonna be like that. That's like showing an inkblot to people, only the mentally deranged will declare that black blotch a masterpiece.

Any movie that requires external intervention to even start to grasp meanings behind it is the result of a poor effort. Your movie has failed if it can't stand up on its own, and instead, relies on its viewers to take a trip to the fourth dimension in search of answers and return sweating and out of breath with the most convoluted explanations of symbolism. I think it's safe to say that your movie is reaching a bit if we need to do that.

You know what, all arguments are moot when we consider the fact that this movie was the result of a failed pilot for ABC. When ABC declined to pick this up for a series, David Lynch then went back a year later and added more scenes and turned it into a movie. What we're left with is not some grand idea or vision that was meticulously planned out, no, this piece of crap is nothing more than what was able to be SALVAGED from his original 8 million dollar failed effort. And people are calling this a masterpiece...

1484650,1,B00005JKJA,"I believe in strong stories that tell stories through symbols. One can experience a movie in a sensational way when viewing the undercurrents of a good story. I think of when I read books like The Scarlet Letter or The Chronicles of Narnia.

Yes, I understood the story of Mulholland Drive, despite its hodgepodge methodology in the storytelling, I did not benefit from seeing it. The ""profound"" way in which it was presented was tedious to say the least, and I found myself waiting for it to conclude, regardless of what other reviewers would say about its ""fast-paced"" third act.

As a friend of mine said, what we have here is a case of The Emperor's New Clothes. We have a director caught up in creating this and other movies which become fan favorites and which receive great praise for reviewers and critics; but, in the end, we're all to afraid to say that all we truly see is nothing more than a naked person walking down the street.",1139011200,7,941,4.562130177514793
1484651,4,B00005JKJA,"Any unconventional artist or entertainer is bound to create a lot of controversy, particularly if they manage to gain a level of popularity, as has David Lynch.  And, as I so often do when discussing something divisive, I come down between the two major camps: No, 'Mulholland Drive' isn't utterly incomprehensible and worthless drivel, nor is it the cinematic equivalent of 'Finnegan's Wake' and a film so complex and meaningful that even the demigod Lynch who birthed is only capable of deciphering but 1/10 of it's mystery.  It's just an entertaining, artfully done little surrealist mystery-thriller thing.

And no 'Mulholland Drive' isn't utterly incomprehensible.  In fact, I don't think it's necessarily terribly difficult to understand if you're willing to watch it twice.  I can understand why it would seem incomprehensible, however: It is flatly impossible to seriously guess at the mysteries of the first 2 hours of the film while you're actually watching them.  The answers just aren't there, period. (Well, there are some hints, obviously, but nowhere near enough to put it all together.)  And it can be pretty tough to put everything together during the final 30 minutes, and I'm sure many viewers were too irritated by the first 2 hours to even care to try at this point.  To be honest, I don't think that the mystery itself if particularly clever as far as this sorta thing goes.  Most significantly, it relies on the oldest, most hackneyed twist in the book (Spoiler alert): Two hours into the film we learn that everything that has happened up to this point is a dream. Thus you can just throw everything that happened out the window, but then use the various parts and details to assemble the reality of the situation.  Despite what many will tell you, the mystery itself isn't really that complicated.  It's mostly just vague and obscure, a substitute for intelligence and complexity in many minds, but not mine.  But, I don't hold this against Lynch too much.  First of all, I don't see this sorta film for the sake of having my mind blown by the revelations.  I just like the style and mood and general strangeness of this sorta film, and while some of them have great twists it's not the kinda thing you can rely on.  Secondly, this was originally intended to be a pilot for NBC, and thus wasn't originally intended to have an ending, so it's naturally gonna be pretty damn tough to tie things up with out being a little cheap.  And Lynch actually does a surprisingly good job of wrapping it all up, in the end, considering the circumstances.

Now, when I say the first 2 hours of the film are utterly incomprehensible, I should specify that it's impossible to know *why* any of this is happening; what is literally going on is fairly straight forward.  The film opens with the failed assassination of an unnamed young woman (Laura Herring).  She flees into a strangers open house, and is struck with amnesia.  Shortly thereafter, Betty (Naomi Watts), a perky, naive woman straight out of a 50's film, arrives in Hollywood with hopes of becoming an actress.  She plans to live in her aunt's vacant apartment while she looks for work, and, needless to say, this happens to be where the nameless woman, shortly to be dubbed Rita, has fled.  She befriends Rita and decides to try and help her remember who she is.  There is another plot thread about the recasting of a film against the will of the director and the repercussions he experiences when he refuses, and we also follow the exploits of the assassin who still hopes to finish off Rita.  That is really about all there is to the plot as far as the first 2 hours of the film are concerned, and during I must reiterate that during this part of the film we don't learn hardly anything of the reasoning behind it all. If you stopped right after the scene in Club Silencio you'd still have no idea who Rita is, no idea who wants her dead or why, no idea why the film is being recast and no idea how these two plot threads tie together. (There are some revelations, but they just make things more confusing, for the time being.)  Still, the individual scenes do play well, and Lynch manages to make things both funny and creepy at different moments.  The stuff involving the director Kesher is generally very amusing culminating in his campy-creepy encounter encounter with a cowboy who apparently speaks for the will of the studio.  There's also a very funny scene involving the assassins severely botched killings. And there's another great scene where Betty goes to audition and is spontaneously, inexplicably hyper-dramatic.  Finally, the whole opening section of the film culminates in the ultra surreal visit to club Silencio, centering around a spanish language rendition of Roy Orbison's `Crying'.  And so on.  Through out it all the acting is strong and widely varied as the film is populated both by seemingly real people and numerous others who seem to be visiting from an alternate dimension.  Much has been made of Naomi Watts's performance, and not with out good reason.  Frankly, this is partially because of shock value, as her character in the final 30 minutes of the film is wildly different from the wide-eyed, grinning like a mental patient Betty of the first 2 hours.  I also particularly like Justin Theroux as the perpetually befuddled director Kesher.  He's kinda like the straight man of the whole film.

I should mention that Angelo Badalamenti's score is excellent.  It's very thick and dramatic, and kinda grounds the whole film, often providing a dramatic counterpoint for the wackiness.  Good stuff.

The final 30 minutes are a lot more straight forward than the opening 120, though shown out of chronological order. (Still, there is some very weird stuff going on at times, no doubt.)  Though they largely exist to finally provide the answers to it all this stuff has quite a bit of dramatic weight, though I can't go into specifics.

If, upon viewing it once, you like the film at all you should really make sure to watch it again.  Though it was amusing the first time around, the opening 2 hours of the film proved a lot more interesting once you have a basic sense of what they mean, and you naturally notice things you didn't notice before.

Many people have cursed the studio because this DVD has only 1 chapter, and there is some very brief optical censoring of some frontal nudity in a scene.  First of all, how often do you really need to stop a DVD while you're watching it anyway.  Second, both of these things were done a Lynch's behest.  So quite whining, it's his film, he can do what he wants. It does strike me as a bit odd that he'd censor himself retrospectively, but it's his choice.  Still, if it has been your life long dream to catch a glimpse of Laura Herring's pubic hair I'm sorry, this film will not allow you to fulfill that ambition.  Not anymore.

Also, speaking of nudity, if you've ever been watching a movie and wished that the two attractive female characters would just get naked and start making out and pawing at each other for no apparent reason, well, today is your lucky day, cause that happens in this film. Twice.

Again, this kinda thing isn't going to play with everyone, and I'm not going to tell you that you need to be oh so smart to understand the movie, and that if you don't like it you must be a dolt.  It's fairly slow-moving much of the time, and the bizarre tone may not amuse everyone, nor will its formlessness.  So, if you  demand a coherent structure form beginning to end you should avoid this, but you'll probably enjoy it if you can go with the flow for a while.

I like movies that are not like the majority, that don't need to spoon-feed to the audience. ""Mulholland Drive"" at any given moment can make me thrilled, amused, mesmerized, sad, or inspired .. such is the power behind this piece of cinematic art.

All is not what it seems, of course. But don't spend too much time trying to figure things out. Just enjoy the ride, go with it. There are so many little touches here and there that linger with you, that make this film unique. Silly things, scary things, and also heartbreaking things. No wonder Lynch was nominated for Best Director. And I must give credit to Angelo Badalamenti for another moving and evocative music score. It enhances the visuals perfectly.

There's been endless talk and musing over the meaning of this film ... so many reviews delve into what we're SUPPOSED to figure out and understand and interpret. They point out the dreams, the truth, and the duality. That's fine, but let's not get sidetracked so much by seeking the meaning that we forget to enjoy the art of this wonderful film: its sights and sounds and colors, its comedy and darkness and menace, its bizarre characters. ""Mulholland Drive"" is something extraordinary.",1138406400,3,1351,4.895196506550218
1484653,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive can best be classified as a mystery.  The ending of the movie, which forces the viewer to abandon the idea that the plot is a traditional mystery story, allows one to realize that the mystery runs still deeper--that we must look beneath the surface of events instead of taking them at face value.  It is simply a great mystery film.  The scenes, as well, are routinely well done--never superfluous.  Two men uncover a nightmarish secret behind Winkies in a suspensful scene; the director Adam Kesher meets up with a mysterious man named simply ""The Cowboy"", who delivers chilling dialogue.  On top of that, the film is filled with humor.  The mobster with a hatred for bad espresso is particularly hilarious.  And only David Lynch could make a gruesome triple homicide by an inept hitman so funny.  The acting is also very good.  Naomi Watts' performance is wonderful.

Part of the joy of watching this movie is figuring out what happened.  The thrill of finally piecing together all the characters and events, and finally understanding how they all fit together, is one of the main things that makes Mulholland Drive so enjoyable to watch over and over.  It is the type of movie that needs to be seen more than once to be appreciated, along the lines of movies like Memento.

With that said, I must warn the reader that I will be giving away vital clues and interpretations of the movie in the following review.  Do not read further if you have not seen the movie.  See the movie, come up with your own conclusions, and then read the reviews, looking for stuff you missed.  That is truly the best way to watch the film, and to spoil the interpretation is to spoil the main draw of the movie.

Now, what happens in Mulholland Drive is that Diane Selwyn is having a dream prior to killing herself.  In reality, she has had a short affair with Camilla, and she becomes embittered when Camilla gets a high profile role in Adam Kesher's movie and subsequently falls in love with him.  She feels inadequate as an actress, and the viewer can sense her anguish as she watches Camilla and Adam announce their upcoming marriage.  Angry and depressed, Diane hires a hitman to kill Camilla.  He kills her, and Diane suddenly feels overwhelmed with guilt.  She eventually commits suicide after waking from a dream in which she had attempted to hide her guilt and her flaws, only to have the dream collapse in a realization that it is in fact a dream, a misrepresentation, and that the reality is all-too terrible.

All these events, which are the reality, occur in short flashes of scenes at the end of the movie.  The sustained narrative at the beginning is actually Diane's dream.  The dream is Diane's attempt to rationalize her inadequacies and flaws, to forget her mistakes, and which ultimately gives voice to her regret and guilt.

Diane becomes Betty.  Camilla becomes ""Rita"".  And in the dream Camilla and Diane are reunited as Betty and Rita.

Everything is different in the dream.  The hitman never manages to assassinate Rita (Camilla).  Rita falls in love with Betty, even needs her, unlike in reality.  Adam Kesher, a brash, young director who stole Camilla away in reality, becomes subject to all kinds of tortures--the mob casts his movie for him, his wife cheats on him with the pool boy, and he loses all his money.  Betty, an idealized version of Diane, is naturally a great actress.  In reality, Diane can only get secondary roles.  A further rationalization of her acting flaws is given in the idea that the mob controls the movie production--the selection of the actress is not based on talent, but a threat of violence.

The whole idea of acting is also foreshadowing the fact that everything is a dream...nothing is real.  The whole beginning narrative is only an act, a dream; it is not reality.

Now, David Lynch doesn't spell out this interpretation in big, bold letters.  The viewer has to figure out that the main narrative is a dream on his or her own.  But there is much foreshadowing.  Following the opening scene depicting the jitterbug contest, we see the camera switch over to the first person perspective of someone breathing heavily and lying down to bed.  The word ""dream"" is mentioned constantly throughout the film.  Betty is living in the ""city of dreams"".  The two men in Winkie's are brought there by a ""dream"" of something terrible there.  The irony, of course, is that the men are the ""dream"" and the ""reality"" was the nightmare.  Diane hires the hitman at Winkies.  When the man finds a terrible, nightmarish homeless man behind the building, he is coming face to face with reality--with Diane's inner guilt.  The most obvious clue that all was a dream, however, is the fact that Diane is shown waking up after the opening of the blue box.

The scene at club Silencio is also full of symbolism and foreshadowing.  All is an illusion there.  Everyone is acting, lip-synching to a recording.  It is here that Betty finds the box that Rita's key can unlock--the box that, when opened, reveals the truth and unravels the dream.  The spectacle they witness at the club, of the woman collapsing whilst her voice continues singing its terrible song, causes the dream to lose its consistency...the dreamer begins to realize that it is indeed a dream, an illusion.

Rita is obviously supposed to represent Camilla.  But as the dream progresses, Rita more and more comes to represent Diane.  Rita symbolizes Diane's inability to know herself...she has amnesia, has no idea who she really is--just as Betty has no idea who she really is, that she is just an act, a fake misrepresentation of Diane.  When Betty and Rita fall in love, it at first represents Diane's wish to have Camilla love her...but eventually it symbolizes Diane's wish to love herself, to forgive herself for what she has done, to accept her flaws and inadequacies.  This is why, as the movie progresses, Rita dons a blonde wig, like Diane and Betty.  This is why, at the opening of the box, it is Rita who opens it, while Betty disappears.  Betty is no longer needed; she is seen to be a false representation...the dreamer is too close to realizing the dream isn't reality, that all is illusion.  It is Rita who doesn't know who she is, just as it is Diane who doesn't realize she is not actually Betty.  And then the box opens, and all is clear.  Rita is Diane...Betty is merely an idealized figment of the imagination.

All of the scenes only add to these themes.  They are either manifestations of Diane's need to idealize herself, to explain her inadequacies--or they are manifestations of Diane's inner turmoil, her guilt and her fears.

We have all desired to rationalize our faults, to see ourselves as good, to forgive our own mistakes.  Diane's emotions are universal, and the depiction of her descent into suicide, of her regret and her fears, magnified extraordinarily once the viewer figures out all the subtle aspects of the dream, is absolutely heart-rending.

Mulholland Drive is a great film, and I'd recommend it to anyone willing to sit and think about a film, to tackle an unconventional mystery whose solution is wonderfully satisfying.",1138233600,27,7166,4.762175324675325
1484654,4,B00005JKJA,"This is a real suspense film.  It is a good example of Alfred Hithcock the master of suspense version.

1484714,4,B00005JKJA,"After watching this film, the viewer will no doubt feel as one does when one awakens from a nightmare. One scene cuts into the next with no apparent logic linking them together. Perhaps it's not as important to decode the mystery as it is to become attentive to mood and atmosphere. Light and dark play a key role in the movie, as does the eerie, impressionistic music. However, there is more darkness in Mulholland than there is light, and the movie ultimately becomes the unfolding of a nightmare, the dark, incongruous side of a mind driven by something sinister.

Naomi Watts plays the role of Betty beautifully, and Laura Harring's performance as the sultry Rita is excellent. It's too bad, though, that in the scene in which Rita is supposed to appear fully nude, her pubic region is optically censored: instead of seeing Rita's pubic hair, the viewer sees a blur in that area. One is reminded of those annoying nudity-obscuring mosaic patterns often seen on television. If anything is truly out of place in this movie, it's this ludicrous censorship. In an interview posted online, the director said that he had deliberately blurred Rita's bush out of concern that pictures of the actress au naturel would appear all over the Internet. How inane. Why do a nude scene in the first place? One star is deducted for stupidity. Nevertheless, Watts and Harring's love scenes, though brief, are very much erotic.

The DVD picture is crisp and provides great color contrast; the audio is clean, delivering good sonic detail in the music of Angelo Badalamenti. There are no chapters in this DVD, apparently because the movie is meant to be viewed from beginning to end without any breaks.",1133827200,8,1686,4.850694444444445
1484715,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is by standards a difficult movie to understand and by reading all of these reviews, well it's surprising how many people didn't understand it. This is my first Lynch film and I intend on seeing Lost Highway. I greatly enjoyed Mulholland Drive as it blended comedy with drama and has some surreal aspects to it.

The thing about this movie is that you shouldn't focuss on one point early on and be like ""what the heck is going on?"" This movie will explain it all in the end and if you pay attention, well it's pretty easy to understand.

I will now summarize the entire movie in case you need some help understanding it.

The movie opens with a lady named Rita who is about to be murdered until a car crashes into hers. She survives and hides in an apartment complex, shocked. Meet Betty, played magnificently by the always brilliant Naomi Watts. She is staying in her aunt's apartment in Los Angeles as she wants to become an actress. But Rita's in her new place. They become friends, and Betty finds lots of money in Rita's purse. What is going on? While Betty continued to rehearse, she starts having a love affair with Rita in some ""famous"" lesbian scenes. Then comes a movie director who is wrapped up in a serious mess, getting in troulbe with mobs, his wife cheating on him, etc...

The movie kkeps on going at this crazy pace until Rita and Betty discover the dead body of a lady name Diane. Back to reality now.

Rita and Betty turn out to be figures of Diane's imagination. Why? Because Diane was in love with the real Rita until she left him for the movie director. The real Diane isn't as beautiful at all as herself in her imagination. Diane gets mad and jealous and hires a hitman to kill her (that's where the money comes from that we found in Rita's purse). But when the job gets done, and Diane finds the blue key signifying the death of Rita...well Diane goes mad. She envisions this alternate reality where her life with Rita is going wonderfully while the director's life is going horribly. But then Diane wakes up and is haunted by what she did and commits suicide.

I hope that that helped better understand this masterpiece. It is one of the most original movies I have ever seen and also one of the most fascinating. El Club Silencio is really neat as is Naomi Watt's acting. She is so talented. Best Actress Ever!

And by the way, this movie has the best line of all time: after the crook's gun accidentally goes off and through the wall, you hear a lady scream..he goes to see if she's dead or not..and she says: (the fat lady is pointing to her but) ""Something bit me bad!"" So hilarious! And that's not all, this movie is full of stuff like that as well as very sad and tragic moments.

Plot is more complex than Pulp Fiction, Citizen Kane, Memento, The Butterfly Effect...You really need to see this film over and over to understand what is really happening and what is only a dream/fantasy. With its mysterious aura, Mulholland Dr. needs a full-focus, concentrated mind to grasp what might be going on but never satisfies the audience fully. If you want to watch a film that is neither narratively logical, nor has traditional values (beginning, middle, end) or (problem, event, solution, or happiness), this is one of the best films ever made to fit into that post-modern conditions. Maybe there is nothing real in this film after all. No accident, no one becoming a star, no one commiting suicide. There may also be elements of alternative universe in this film; only, we have to take for granted that what is a dream is actually happening. If you buy this film, be sure to watch it with clear mind and complete attention. One of the best films of the 21th century...Thank You David Lynch...",1129420800,9,1038,4.837078651685394

1484718,5,B00005JKJA,"This is one of the best movies of all time, a classic film noir and one of the most disturbing movies I've seen.

If you are familiar with Lynch's movies you will know that his work is a little off-beat.  Mulholland Drive is no exception.  Even though I understood the movie on first viewing, my second and third viewings since have helped me to understand deeper levels in the plot.

In a nutshell the movie is about {warning - this may spoil the movie for some who have not seen it yet} the sexual and professional jealousy between two women in a lesbian relationship; one a struggling starlet, the other a Hollywood success.  The movie is shown from the perspective of the struggling starlet (Watt's character).  Betrayal, love, hate, passion, fear, suicide and murder set amongst the backdrop of Hollywood.  I agree with other reviewers that Hollywood is itself a third character in the movie.  Lynch manages to portray it as both its fantasy image (dreams of stardom and glamour) and its reality - a town that more often than not chews up and spits people out.  Profoundly sad and disturbing.",1127433600,9,1097,4.701570680628272
1484719,3,B00005JKJA,"This movie is strange and hard to follow.  The only thing I know for sure about it is that Naomi Watts gets topless and makes out with another girl.

Taken conventionally, the first 2/3rd of Mulholland Drive tells a compelling (albeit fractured) tale of murder, sex, amnesia, Hollywood corruption, and mistaken identity.  Then the last 1/3 flips over on itself...Characters change, and the plot seemingly exists in an alternate universe.  The one complaint (I'm not even sure it can be considered a legitimate flaw) is that the true power of Mulholland Drive (which is only partially the compelling murder-mystery stuff) won't make any sense until you know the twist, becasue the twist informs everything that came before it, and logically and emotionally ties everything together.  Because of this, the film MUST be seen at least twice...

So what is the surprise?  Everything in the first 2/3rds is a dream.  Before that sounds lame, I can honestly say that Muholland Drive is unlike any other film I've ever seen.  Why?  Because it uses dreams to explore a character by inhabiting their psyche completely, telling a story from the inside out.  Everything you see in the first 2/3rds exists within the unconscious of Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts).  Thus every little weird turn of event, every erotic encounter, every nightarmish scenario sheds light on who she is, her aspirations, and her fears.  The 3rd of the film shows reality as it actually exists and thus correlates the associations Diane's dreaming brain makes with the reality of her miserable, tormented existence.  Even the illogical moments of the film make sense within the logic that it was dreamt and associated with something in Diane's actual life.

That is where the beauty and power of the film lies.  We see inside a character so completely.  It's an almost frighteningly intimate filmgoing experience at times, especially as Diane is repeatedly humiliated in the third act.  And the adventurous joy of the first act is imbued with a tender sense of melancholy as it is a doomed fantasy of a happiness that can never exist. Lynch's template can take him anywhere, and thus he goes everywhere.  Mulholland Drive is a meditation on dreams, on the Hollywood machine that chews and spits out wanna-be starlets, and a profoundly jealous and disturbed personality.

As for the performances...You've all heard how good Naomi Watts is in this film.  I can assure you that the praise is justified and more.  Like Lynch, her performance goes anywhere and everywhere, to the depths of despair to triumphant moments of one's greatest narcissistic realization, to...you fill in the blank.  It's an outstanding, phenomenal performance. Laura Harring is great too, but in a more conventional way.  Her amnesiac Rita makes an appealing femme fatale, but because Rita/Camilla only exists within Diane's warped psyche, this is really not a character exploration as in-depth as Watts'.  Still, a damn fine performance.

Upon repeated viewings, Mulholland Drive reveals itself to be a pitch-perfect masterpiece.  From the concept to the performances, Mulholland Drive is a phenomenal movie.",1125014400,14,3003,5.217118997912317

1484741,5,B00005JKJA,"With the exception of ""The Elephant Man,"" I've always loved the style of David Lynch, but rarely enjoyed the stories he brought to the screen.  If anyone wants the definition of abstract filmmaker - David Lynch is the answer.  Lynch allows his imagination to spin wild and create some of the most vivid works of visual art.  ""Mulholland Drive,"" a film that will toy with your sense of reality and draw you into the film's world, is Lynch's benchmark.

This bizarre tale begins as a woman (played by Laura Elena Harring) is riding in the back of a limo, only to notice that the driver stops to draw a silenced pistol, and is suddenly rescued (in a way) when a speeding car crashes into the limo.  After she wakes up, she wanders into a condo complex, and stays in one that is apparently vacated for the moment.

This sounds simple on paper, but before the movie reaches that little plot point, we are introduced to a multitude of colorful characters, including a detective (Robert Forster) who seems to have no purpose other than to make us acknowledge, ""Wow, I really enjoy a scene when a detective is on the scene of the crime.""  There are mysterious individuals, of seemingly powerful stature, who loom in the shadows and communicate with vague phone calls.

The character that will advance the story (or sequence of events, as I'm not sure this is really a plot), is Betty (Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress who enters the dreamlike world of Hollywood.  She soon enters the habitat that Harring's character has been hiding in, and discovers her sensuous figure in a shower.  Apparently, ""Rita"" has amnesia, which Betty sees as an opportunity to embark on an adventure to discover her past.

The film goes in many spirals after that.  Justin Theroux portrays Adam Kesher, a director who's blackmailed into making compromises with more strange people, catches his infidelious wife with a pool cleaner (Billy Ray Cyrus?), and shares an unforgettable glance with Betty.  A random assassination attempt gone awry only makes sense within the last 10 minutes of the movie.  I could go on and on about the oddities of ""Mulholland Drive"", but I'll leave you to discover.

Many reviewers and critics have ruined the infamous 'TWIST' in the film.  I refuse to do so.  If you don't know what it is, breathe easy---you can't predict anything in this surreal moviegoing experience.

I would be lying if I said that this film is for everybody, but since when has a David Lynch film ever been?  I can guarantee that you will never forget the emotional impact and dizzying strucutre of this masterpiece.  David Lynch surely has the answers to this riddle of a mystery.  But he is not interested in the concrete answers.  He wants us to view this work of art and come up with our own conclusions.  He's not doing this to be self-concious, but he wants us to create our own sympathies and relations to the characters.  In whatever reality we perceive any film to exist in, what happens on the screen is still open to our interpretation...and Lynch embraces that with open arms.

FINAL NOTE - The DVD insert even comes with 10 questions to help us know where to start.  If you want a more complete viewing experience, make sure Amazon retailers are selling you a DVD with this insert.",1122508800,4,3267,4.697715289982425

A woman is involved in a car accident, and doesn't remember who she is. There is a conspiracy to get a particular lead actress into a movie. A man nearly gets a heart attack from seeing a `monster' behind the alley of a restaurant. An aspiring actress arrives to make her mark in the film industry. A clumsy hit man kills three people in the office. A director finds his wife in bed with the pool man. Even though these people are not connected to each other in any way in the beginning, they somehow get connected through a blue box.

Doesn't make any sense? Don't worry! People are still trying to pick their brains on solving each and every detail of the movie However, the more you look into it, the more sense it makes. David Lynch did an AMAZING job in directing this movie. He maintains a suspenseful atmosphere throughout the movie, without having to add any loud bangs and noises. I admit, I haven't seen any of his previous works, but after watching this, I am going to make sure that I do. Naomi Watts did a terrific job in her role as well. Laura Harring was adequate, but didn't portray much emotion. The rest of the cast did well, and made the film more interesting.

1484745,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is sophisticated plot illinearity that would have made William Faulkner momentariy confounded. I loved everything about this film--the two incredibly beautiful and talented leads, the moments of ""what the heck was that?"", and the whole stlylish L.A. vibe. I think I might even like this better than Lynch's Blue Velvet, which I watched four times, one night after another, when it first came out in 1986. Mulholland Drive, however, I've only watched once on video, and just recently. I'm giving myself a while to see it again, kind of savoring and anticipating--savoring the impressions, anticipating making sense of the second viewing, knowing what I know now, that which occurred during those last thirty minutes.

Wow! Creepy, mind-blowing, surreal kind of stuff. And I loved every confusing moment! I liked this film so much, I might have to rewatch Bergman's Persona (lots of comparisons have been made) to see if I was originally too harsh in my contempt for it.",1119916800,,985,5.118012422360248
1484746,5,B00005JKJA,"I didn't get the film the first time. ive seen it twice and had a class about it, and i still have my doubts. but hey, even though you cant understand everything, it keeps being a great film about identity, losing of inocence and personality and about evil and fakeness beneath the apparently beautiful life.

We see the characters once, then they are the same actresses but the characters is different. we see how they lose their lifes, their identities (many times through the film, actually) and fulfil their dreams outside reality.

Dont be satisfied with simple explanations: ok, the first part is a dream. But its not just that. if camilla is rita, why there are two camillas? if everything is dianes fantasy, why are there so many things that doesnt make sense? why is she dreaming with the director, why cant she control her desires, why she finds herself dead?

I think that a lot of magic in this film is precisely in the fact that you can say the film is this or that. the film is this and that, but can never be just this, just that or entirely one of these. it wouldnt make sense. just keep in mind that is a puzzle, where some pieces are missing or we just cant put themselves together. and enjoy. the film is great even though you don't get it. trust me",1119916800,2,1268,4.410256410256411
1484747,5,B00005JKJA,"Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, ""Mulholland Dr."" was rejected. The next year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters. He did so - and created one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made.

The film really doesn't have main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a perky blonde who's staying in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for parts in movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita's lost her memory. She has no clue who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from a ""Gilda"" poster in the bathroom. So the two set out to discover who Rita really is.

David Lynch has been known for making some weird movies, but this film is the definition of weird. It's bizarre, nightmarish, and absolute indescribable. It's like a dream captured on film. By the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you've been watching closely, it will make perfect sense. Having watched the movie and then read an article on the Internet pointing out things in the film, I now understand the movie completely.

The acting is very good. Watts is terrific. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director facing problems with the local mob. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. And the directing - hah! David Lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was.

Is this your type of film? Well, that depends. You should probably view more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You'll need to be patient with the film, and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues Lynch has left throughout the movie. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true.

1484749,4,B00005JKJA,"It has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that David Lynch is a pretentious boor, and aside from artsy effects and fancy camera angles, most of his films lack Significance.  Muholland Drive is the exception.  Unfortunately, it is also his most misunderstood work.  It starts with an attempted assassination foiled by a freak accident, then cuts to a surreal vingette, then proceeds as a classic ""film noir"" thriller for the next hour or so, before suddenly spinning out of control in a whirlwind of confusion.  I began to think that this was some more artsy silliness, but then the unthinkable occured -- it all came together and began to make perfect sense!  This film is about the choices people make, and how each choice can potentially create a new reality.  Classic Quantum physics (which I believe to be deeply flawed) postulates that literally hundreds of alternate realities are co-existing side by side (BS), and this film shows us about a half-dozen such realities -- and what happens when the barriers between them are partially lifted.  Added to the mix are a number of demi-god type entities masquerading as humans in order to physically interact with those they seek to influence.  Most of Lynch's films are notable only for a handful of good scenes -- this one was good nearly all the way through.  Impressive!",1118361600,,1333,4.915178571428571
1484750,4,B00005JKJA,"A summer camp staple during my youth was a story our counselors used to tell at night around the campfire. It involved a guest at a country estate who woke each night because of a disturbance in the courtyard. Each night he rushed to his window just in time to see a spectral presence rushing from the property and down the road. It took 20-30 minutes to tell the story as the counselor would meticulously detail all six times this occurred even though the particular events were identical. After six nights the guest devised a trap and caught the specter who turned out to be the owner of the estate. Just before dying the owner agreed to explain the how and why of his bizarre activity on the condition that the guest promise to never reveal the secret. The story ended with the explanation that the guest kept his promise and never told anybody the secret. This caused a lot of groaning around the campfire by the first year campers and laughter from those who had heard the story the year before. We felt cheated by the story but had to admire the brazen manner in which we had just been conned.

David Lynch took our old campfire story idea and made it into a feature film called ""Mulholland Drive"". For the first 80% of the film he constructs an elaborate and intriguing storyline which has the audience trying to guess the ending. We wonder how he can possibly tie all these disparate elements together into a coherent ending. One thing leads to another--but nothing leads anywhere.

In the end he cheats and the movie is incomplete because it was not intended to be complete. But like the campfire story we do not really feel cheated because Lynch is absolutely brazen about his cheating, he does not back away from it. Screen writing is a whole lot easier when closure is not a goal.

So don't watch this if you require a director who plays fair. But if you like a surreal dream in a highly stylized Hollywood film noir package you should enjoy this thing.

If nothing else the first 80% shows that Lynch could make a straight film as good as ""L.A. Confidential"" if he wanted. And it's worth watching just for the audition scene where the singer performs ""Sixteen Reasons"". The scene begins with a tight shot, then backs out to a POV from inside the control booth, then backs out further and reveals the booth is a prop on a sound stage. So we have a live stage performance, that morphs into a recording session, and then morphs into a movie audition. And the movie itself is inside a movie. And the whole thing is actually a dream. Are you confused yet? But this fits with the film because Lynch is telling the same story (trying to make it in Hollywood) with two different protagonists. The bubbly, optimistic Betty, with a support network and a good heart. And within Betty is the beat-up, worn-out Diane, who has abandoned all hope of success and become paranoid and vengeful.

By the way Naomi Watts is so good in this thing that it is scary.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1116720000,3,3003,4.490842490842491
1484791,4,B00005JKJA,"David ""Twin Peaks"" Lynch apparently takes great pleasure in thumbing his nose at viewers.  He creates marginally comprehensible plots with minimal explanation and makes us squirm trying to figure out what's going on.  ""Mulholland Drive"" is a flick that begs for multiple viewings.  The largely unsympathetic characters however made me not care to try establish a deeper understanding of Lynch's plot.

Naomi Watts acted her roles of plucky aspiring actress and Ontario native Betty Elms and femme fatale Diane Selwyn with great aplomb.  We are led to believe that she's just arrived and will be residing in her Aunt Ruth's L.A. apartment while the aunt is away.

Coincidently Laura Haring playing Rita has just survived a horrific high speed auto accident with leaves her with amnesia.  She stumbles through the L.A. canyons and winds up sneaking into Watt's aunts apartment seeking shelter prior to Watts' arrival.

When they meet a sympathetic Watts offers to help Haring figure out her identity.  This ultimately results in a steamy lesbian sexual romp between them.

In a seeming unrelated tangent, movie director Adam Kesher played by Justin Theroux is being pressured by two apparent gangster brothers to cast a particular actress in the lead role of his latest movie.  Not only does he come home unexpectedly to find his wife in the sack with Billy Ray Cyrus but he gets threatened by a mysterious cowboy urging him to cast that actress.  There are too many other tangents to the plot to enumerate but they serve more to confuse than clarify.

About 2 hours into the flick Haring implores Watts to accompany her to a club called Silencio.  While there the creepy emcee announces that all that they see in the show is not real.  This proves to be a foreshadowing for the remainder of the plot.

Apparently all the action leading up to that point was ostensibly a dream sequence.  Watts is actually suicide victim Diane Selwyn, whose life has been tragically played out before us.  The sudden unexpected ending is designed to suffice as an explanation for all that has happened before.  Guess what?  It doesn't.

Lynch unfortunately doesn't make enough use of his bit part actors excepting Ann Miller playing maternal landlady Coco Lenoix.  The talents of accomplished Lee Grant and the very competent Dan Hedaya were not maximized.  The flick was beautifully filmed in and around L.A.  The surreal scenes in Club Silencio were some of the movie's best including the stirring, poignant song sung by Rebekah del Rio.",1116201600,,2520,4.973684210526316
1484792,5,B00005JKJA,"This movie is far and beyond anything you will ever see or are likely to see.  I won't bother trying to explain the plot to you, because it is so complex that only some sense can be made after multiple viewings.  It is a deep and a dark look at Hollywood through the eyes of a woman in search of stardom, but nothing is what it seems.  I would recomend that for those of you who view this the first time, to not make sense of anything until you watch it the second time.  David Lynch is a master director and this film is beautifully directed, produced, and acted. (espeically Naomi Watts) Now despite all my praise for the film I only gave the dvd two stars, for the lack of supplimental material.  There are no making ofs, interviews, or anything.  The only thing that saved the DVD from getting one star was a feature that David Lynch himself requested.  There are no chapters on the dvd because David lynch thought that this film should be viewed all the way through without skipping any scenes and on this I agree with him.  But despite my problems with the dvd, the movie is amazing.  I would recomend this film to anyone who has enjoyed David Lynch's other works.",1115164800,,1170,4.354838709677419

After you watch this twice, I recommend watching the 'reality' parts followed by the 'dream.' A dream is an amalgam of (1) everyday events consisting of both minor and major events in one's life from both the past and the 'near' present and (2) fantasy. Things will become much clearer after this third viewing.

One thing that should be clear to even the most confused viewers is that this movie has an extremely intriguing and important storyline which Lynch twists and mangles and manipulates to fit the mental state of the main character. By doing this, he creates a uniquely personal experience for us.

This movie is not the least bit gimmicky, the plot is an excellent one, but Lynch is clearly not satisfied with simply an interesting story, he must bend it and warp it in order to fuse it with a psychological theme that ends up making the entire experience MORE real, not less.

If you cannot understand or figure any of this out, then just try and appreciate the quality acting, first-rate directing and mesmerizing visuals and relax.",1115078400,,1231,4.506726457399103
1484794,3,B00005JKJA,"Let me begin by stating that I truly look forward to David Lynch's films. I enjoy them not necessarily for what Lynch has to say, but more for HOW he says it. Its common knowledge that David Lynch's films have unquestionable style, but many question its substance (relax Lynch die-hards!). In Mulholland Drive, however, I was a bit disappointed mainly because I found Lynch's style to be a bit thin and recycled. Sure, there are many signature scenes that are viscerally engrossing and hauntingly disturbing, but generally, the film seems a bit cautious for Lynch. Since he originally wrote and filmed it as a television pilot for an ABC series, it's clear that it was necessary to pull back on his choices at that time. It's evident that the many characters and sub-plots would have been fleshed out if the pilot had been picked up, but we never do get the opportunity (and pleasure) in this film. It's quite clear when, where, and how Lynch tried to salvage it once his censorship shackles were removed, but the damage was done way back in ABC's womb. Trying to recycle this into a feature film (something that it was not intended for), is dooming it to be flawed. Even after reworking the script, reshooting scenes, and shooting new ones, it still tastes like a hot meal served up luke-warm. In spite of that, I must clarify that, for me, any meal served up by David Lynch is still more engrossing than 90% of the fare out there.

Strong proponents of this film may point out that like in a dream, characters and scenes drop in and out, sometimes are interlaced, and don't exist in the realm of reason. This is all true, but there are so many that it fractures the film into too many nonsequiturs weakening its storyline. His characters are not as sharp and indelible as in his other films (ie: Robert Blake in ""Lost Highway"", Dennis Hopper in ""Blue Velvet""). His themes, however, on the lack of self-realization, emotional transference, and fascination with split personalities are alive and well in this film. As always, Angelo Badalamenti's musical score perfectly compliments the emotional undercurrent of Lynch's films. The acting is over-the-top, but perfect in a Lynchian world. In particular, Naomi Watts (Betty Elms) is truly astonishing. Her character undergoes a severe transformation and Watts' performance is nothing short of remarkable.

In its most simple state, the plot is about the search for the identity of an amnesiac woman. The film, however, is filled with subplots that twist and turn. The story mainly revolves around two women. Rita (Laura Harring) loses her memory after surviving a car crash at night on Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. Dazed and confused, she manages to find her way into a home of a stranger who has gone out of town. Enter Betty (Naomi Watts). A Hollywood actress wannabee, Betty shows up at her Aunt's home only to find Rita staying there and ultimately decides to help her find her identity.

Notwithstanding its original television intent, ""Mulholland Drive"" is still a unique, personal vision. It is not as dark and paranoid as ""Lost Highway"", nor is it as disturbing as ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Eraserhead"", but it is still undeniably David Lynch and that alone is worth the price of admission.",1114041600,3,3244,4.841441441441441

They seemed to belong to another movie: loose ends, no doubt, from the projected TV mini-series that never came to fruition. I'm not the biggest fan of David Lynch, but I did find this one fairly compelling and memorable. Some have complained that the film is totally inscrutable, but those who managed to follow the storyline of Memento shouldn't have too much difficulty with this one. Just bear in mind that the first persona we encounter is only an idealized self-image in the fever dream of a mean little failure with a ugly soul. Enjoy.

Don't watch it if you like mindless movies, because this one will make you think.  It is best described as the movie version of a Rubix Cube....there are many interpretations, and just finding one of them is a v. rewarding feeling.  This is what movies should be about!

Other than that, the cinematography of this movie is really well-done.  Gorgeous and lush and spooky and eerie all at the same time.  Editing and music and other technical stuff are also excellent; they do a fantastic job of building suspense.  I nearly jumped out of my seat multiple times, and it wasn't just the image...it was the build-up and suspese to that image.  Acting is superb...this is a real standout performance by Naomi Watts.

1484799,2,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch returns to the big screen! If you are a die-hard Lynch fan and have praised every one of his films, you should read no further. If you, like me, have liked some of his films and disliked others, you will probably find some useful information within my review.

A voluptuous brunette (Laura Harring) survives a car crash on Mulholland Drive. She stumbles down the hillside and into a vacant department. Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), fresh off the airplane, ready to make it big, is housesitting her aunt's apartment while she is away shooting a film. She finds the woman asleep in the apartment and misstakes her for a friend of her aunt's. The woman has amnesia but decides to call herself Rita because she sees a movie poster for ""Gilda"" in the bathroom. Betty decides to help Rita figure out who she is. After Betty wows them at an audition, she quickly leaves to help Rita in her search. The journey begins.

""Mulholland Drive"" began as a pilot for a proposed television series on ABC (the same network that aired ""Twin Peaks""). After the network rejected it, Lynch went back and shot an additional 30 minutes to tie up the loose ends. The material created for the television pilot is very good. The problems arise with the material designed to `tie up the loose ends'.

Lynch has always created films that depicted a strange, alter universe. His best works, ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks"",combine this strange vision with fully developed characters and an involving story. His worst films, ""Lost Highway"" among them, let the strangeness overtake everything else. ""Mulholland Drive"" is neither the best or the worst film he has created.

Technically, the film is superior to most of the other dreck out in the multiplex. Lynch devotes a lot of attention to detail. Set in modern day Hollywood, everything has a sort of smudgy feel to it, but there are also places that have retained the beauty of Old Hollywood and this beauty shines through.

The story follows Betty and Rita as they navigate through the mystery of who Rita actually is. They encounter a number of strange people and the people they encounter also come into contact with even more strange people. For the first 90 minutes or so, all of this is very interesting. But you keep hoping that it will pay off. We meet Coc Lenoix (Ann Miller), the apartment building manager, Vincenzo Castigliane (Dan Hedaya), a `connected' movie producer, Detective Harry McKnight (Robert Forster), Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), a young movie director, the Cowboy (Monty Montgomery) and many more.

Betty and Rita are the main characters and are in just about every scene of the film. Laura Harring is certainly a beautiful actress and has the body of an old-fashioned screen star, a Rita Hayworth for the modern day, but she is not a very good actress. From what I understand, she has had limited film experience and it shows. Both actresses act too much at times, much like a soap actress might. Rita talks with a slight accent and has a slow, extremely mannered way of speech. Naomi Watts plays Betty as a fresh-off-the-truck wannabee, but it appears as if she is actually just that. In one scene, she mouths ""I love you"", to another character, eliciting giggles and laughter from some in the audience.

In the first 90 minutes, as we watch the endless parade of supporting characters, it is easy to see that the television series Lynch envisioned would be endlessly fascinating. Unfortunately, the tacked on ending doesn't bother to follow story threads that were created in the previous 90 minutes. Instead of following any story through, Lynch uses the same infuriating story device he used in ""Lost Highway"" as a means of tying everything together. I would've been happy if just two characters made any sort of sense. Ultimately, nothing makes sense. Many characters have one scene, never to appear again. Adam Kesher's part of the puzzle seems particularly short. For instance, why does a woman sing ""Crying"" in Spanish (I think) and then fall to the stage? It just ends up being a mess.

It is also at about the 90 minute mark that Lynch begins using some of the more far-fetched plot devices he has employed in other projects. Alternate realities, magical devices, demons, etc. all get thrown into the mix.

Lynch's projects are usually multi-layered stories that involve a little deciphering. In listening to Roger Ebert's review last night, he mentioned that he loved the film because it resembled a series of dreams or nightmares, with characters and events changing with each successive dream. Some scenes that didn't interest the director were cut short, more emphasis was placed on other scenes. This is very true, but I don't feel Lynch was completely successful. Something is missing to make the dreams, nightmares, alternate realities, etc. interesting, believable or enjoyable.

I think ""Mulholland Drive"", the six or thirteen episode television series, would have been a constant source of discussion among viewers. I think ""Mulholland Drive"", the movie needs a tremendous amount of road work to become passable.",1113264000,7,5090,4.915017462165308

While the plot can not simply be explained to a viewer, he or she must make his or her own mind up about what this film is saying.  I don't have a clear cut answer, but the movie is a manifestation of romance, comedy, drama, mystery, and sadness.  David Lynch's direction is Oscar deserving.

1484853,5,B00005JKJA,"Los Angeles is not known for being a spooky town, with the palm trees, sunshine and Hollywood. But David Lynch makes it so in ""Mulholland Drive,"" a brilliantly elliptical film where nothing is as it seems. With outstanding acting, eerie direction and a thoroughly strange plotline, this is a brain-bender of the best kind.

The movie opens with heavy breathing, visions of a lovely young girl being awarded, many teen couples dancing, and a slow descent toward a pillow. Then we cut to a three-way car crash, followed by a pretty young woman (Laura Harring) wandering down the hill to an upscale apartment. But she soon encounters the owner's niece, pretty plucky Betty (Naomi Watts). When Betty learns that the mysterious young lady -- who is calling herself Rita -- has amnesia, she decides to help her find out what is going on.

Elsewhere, a promising young film director's life is falling to pieces, because of a pair of malevolent brothers who want a particular young lady to star in his film. And when Betty begins to explore the strange car accident that Rita walked away from, they find that there is a bizarre conspiracy brewing in L.A. Or is there? The path gets more and more twisted, as the boundaries of reality and dreams blur.... and it all centers on a mysterious name: Diane Selwyn.

This is a movie that doesn't make sense on the first viewing -- at first it just seems to be a straightforward suspense movie. But David Lynch completely turns that on its ear. Not everything makes sense in this film -- such as the monstrous man behind the restaurant -- but the pieces start to slowly click together as we find out who Diane Selwyn is.

When you realize what the first two hours actually are, the film makes much more sense -- a muddied look at Diane Selwyn's life, but fragmented and twisted by her desires. Multiple alter-egos, wishful thinking, obsessive lesbian love, jealousy, rage, and random people and places come into her dream, but reflected as she wants to see them, and tainted by her own guilt.

And even the sunny opening scenes, with the starry-eyed Betty arriving in sunny L.A. for an audition, take on a dark tinge when you discover who Diane was, and that she had the same experience. Naomi Watts plays both Betty and Diane, one sweet and innocent, the other bitter and unbalanced. And she's marvelous as both, whether playing a sweet young girl, or a hardened, obsessive starlet. Harding does almost as good a job as Rita, especially as the film starts, but the focus slowly and inexorable shifts to Watts.

David Lynch ignores the shiny warmth of L.A., focusing on back-alley monsters, creepy dreams and hit men. He's known for being incredibly weird, and here he doesn't disappoint -- ordinary words and occurances are sinister, and the camerawork is insanely good. The camera slowly descends, wanders down hallways, and creeps to reveal something horrible. A few scenes -- the lesbian love scene, the monstrous restaurant creature that is implied to be in the middle of it -- seem a bit out of place, but then again, their presence could be interpreted in multiple ways.

Surrealistic noir is the best way to describe ""Mulholland Drive,"" an exceptionally strange mind-bender of a movie. Creepy, beautiful and very very unreal, and not something forgotten easily.",1112054400,4,3303,4.814814814814815
1484854,5,B00005JKJA,"This is truly a magnificent film, my all time 2nd fave. Upon first viewing i wasn't familiar with Lynch's work, that is to say I didn't know anything of his films, I went in to watch this film as it were made by any other director, and that is why i got utterly confused. When the credits rolled I was left scratching my head. Intially I shrugged it off and just thought it was a strange film that has no intention of making any sense what so ever. One night I looked up the movie and read all the raving reviews that It had gotten, I decided that a movie that didn't make any sense couldn't have possibly been given such good reviews, so I decided to dig futher and figure out the film. After reading many theories and clues etc and re watching the film many times I now feel like I have an understanding of it, I think It's amazing how you really can dig deep into this film and find out exactly why every little scene is significant and that everything has a meaning, David Lynch is definetly an amazingly talented director. This film is stunning in every aspect and everytime you watch it you discover something new, many people will watch It once and critise It as they won't understand and won't put In the effort to figure it out, and I think thats a shame because once you have an understanding of the film I feel you can really appreciate It. This is truly an amazing film and after seeing this I feel like I simply must see the rest of David Lynch's work, and I only hope It Is as good as Mulholland Drive.",1111968000,,1516,4.231034482758621
1484855,4,B00005JKJA,"Laura Elana Harring and Naomi Watts star in this confusing but highly entertaining movie about dreams, suicide, and mistaken identities.  The first two hours of this film are a dream of a woman known as Diane Selwyn, while the last half hour is actually Diane's real life.

What makes this movie somewhat hard to grasp is that the viewer is never made aware that they're watching a dream sequence.  The movie just flows along without the viewer knowing that what they are actually seeing is someone's dream, not what is really occuring.

Betty (Naomi Watts) is the dream version of Diane.  Wholsome and down-to-earth, Betty is portrayed as an aspiring actress who has come to Los Angeles from Ontario, Canada in hopes of finding an acting job.  But, Diane is not Betty in the dream, she's really Rita (Laura Elana Harring).  Rita is a woman who was involved in a horrific car crash and somehow lost her memory.  She comes upon Betty's Aunt's apartment, where she ends up meeting Betty.  She convinces Betty to help her search for her lost identity, and the two become very close along the way, as evidenced by the steamy sex scenes between the two.

Although this movie is hard to follow at some parts, I did enjoy it overall.  Naomi Watts and Laura Elana Harring are simply perfect together, as evidenced by their excellent on-screen chemistry and the attraction and passion that develops between their characters of Betty and Rita.  The many sub-plots in the movie are very exciting as well, and everything is tied together in the end.  I recommend this movie highly.  The acting is first-rate, the directing is good, and the story is fun to watch.

Trying to be cool and cutting edge are one thing but come on. Just like Blue Velvet, I kept sighing through the whole thing, wondering what the hell is going on. I hate movies that just don't give you a clue until the end, and this one didn't even do 'that' for me. I got it that one woman actress put out a hit on the other etc, etc. But I still don't know who the heck the bum behind the building with the little blue box was. Or the two guys in the resturant.

Lynch made his sublime masterpiece : a glorious and tastefully film with smart ellipsis , sinuous illusions , double cross , visual riddles  and circular dreams . With this superb movie Lynch reached the artistic peak of Alain Resnais (The last year in Mariembad) and Raoul Ruiz (Three cornets for a sailor).

In this magic shining universe her light was not enough intense to shine like a crazy diamond.. She will be displaced from her maxim dream and her only love : In other words Dante 's hell  paradigm revived in Mulholland Drive.

First it's a girl in an accident, then no memory, then dyking it out. I'll tell you this however, the only reason this movie scored points with me is because the main character was GORGEOUS.

1484930,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is without a doubt one of the greatest movie experiences I've ever had.  I like the point a reviewer below me made about Lynch making great ""experiences"" in movies, because that's really the best way to explain this film.  Don't go in expecting a typical, coherent plotline; in fact, you might not want to expect to understand it at all the first time through (I know I didn't).  The key here is to be able to enjoy something that you can't understand or put into words.

When explaining this movie to others, I often compare it to music, since it's so hard to explain what a piece of music means, or why it is that you really like it.  This movie is like that.  The imagery, the overall feel, the acting, and many single scenes are so intriguing that they don't need to mean anything, or at least not anything specific -- they just work in themselves.

This is not to say that the movie is impenetrable, however.  There are some meanings to be found here, some symbolism, connections between seemingly disparate plotlines, etc.  To a large extent, you can ""figure it out.""  But I've found that, for me at least, that's not really the point.  After finishing it the first time, and being thoroughly dazzled and confused, I read some reviews and analyses, in order to understand it all.  And now I can say that, for the most part, I know what's going on in the movie, but what I can't say is that I enjoy it more because of that knowledge.  The movie's charm to me still remains something unexplainable.  {SPOILER} I can't tell you why the scene in Club Silencio is probably my favorite scene in the history of cinema; yes, the ""there is no band"" bit can be used to explain some of the rest of the film, but that's not why I love it.  There's just such an ominous feel, such a mystery, that is, from my experience (which I admit is rather limited) completely unparalleled.{/SPOILER}

And that is the charm that is, in my opinion, unique to this movie.  There are other movies that have twisted plotlines that take a while to figure out, but I've yet to see another movie that reacted so immediately on the senses that I fell in love with it without knowing why.  See this movie.  NOW.

*Unfortunately, as another reviewer mentioned, this DVD is about as bad as it gets.  The ""extras"" are for all intents and purposes nonexistent, and the lack of chapter selection can get really annoying, especially given MD's rather scattered plot.  But, as far as I know, this is your only option.  The movie is worth it by itself, anyway.",1099094400,9,2541,4.5

I can't recommend this film enough for fans of well-made film noir. However, the dvd itself is crappy. The 'extras' are a joke and you can't even skip through the movie unless you fast forward the 'old-fashioned way.' Why Lynch or the studio even bothered to release this film on dvd is beyond me, they may as well have just stuck to the VHS format if they weren't going to take advantage of all that dvd has to offer.

In the ensuing weeks of her life, completely normal events suddenly turn horrid, populated by ghoulish ghostlike beings, and then turn back to normal just as rapidly.  She is inexplicably drawn to an abandoned amusement park, where the ghouls entice her to join them in a dance (think of the elderly tourists in MHD).  At the end, her car is fished out of the lake where it crashed, with her dead body inside.

1484988,5,B00005JKJA,"Don't drive yourself nuts trying to connect the dots. Yes [SPOILER] the first four-fifths of the movie are a dream. The last fifth is a convaluted series of ""real-life"" images. In terms of structure, this is much simpler than some of Lynch's other work--Lost Highway for example--where the whole plot (sans a few scattered minutes) is internal. But, the plot is not really the point. Enjoy the experience of the images. Enjoy the dreamlike quality. If you're looking for a realistic plot (even a complex realistic plot like Memento), you're going to be disappointed.

That being said:

David Lynch is quite simply one of the greatest artists working in mainstream film. He is bringing the experimental, avant-garde film world to Hollywood, and for that alone he should be congratulated. The fact that he produces artistic pieces that are also intensly enjoyable to watch is a rare gift.

I'll go to Quentin Tarantino (or for that matter Joss Whedon or Amy Sherman-Palladino) if I'm looking for great dialogue. I'll go to Tim Burton or Wes Anderson if I'm looking for great characters. But David Lynch is where I'll go for a great experience.

A few other filmakers: Paul Thomas Anderson, Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman, Sam Mendes, Darren Aronofsky, etc. create great experiences (OK, I can't really say I ""enjoy"" Anderson or Aronofsky), but David Lynch, by separating himself from the strictures of an A-B-C plot, creates the most interesting experiences of all.

The best comparison I can think of for Mulholland Dr. is a short film by the experimental filmaker Maya Deren: Meshes of the Afternoon. This film, made around 1943 I think, is about fifteen minutes long, silent, and features a series of images revolving around a woman coming home in the middle of the day and eventually winding up--well, it's not really clear what she winds up. The movie is a beautiful series of images: a cloaked figure with a mirror for a face, broken mirror bits on a beach, a flower, a lover, and (yes) a key that transforms into a knife and becomes the tool behind a murder/suicide at the end of the film.

If you can find Meshes of the Afternoon (and that's kind of hard) definitely watch it. Until then, wait for the next Lynchian experience",1097971200,3,2229,4.852631578947369

1484990,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is undoubtedly the best David Lynch film to come out since Blue Velvet and one of the best films ever to come out of independent cinema. I ended up watching this film five times in the theater because it was that addicting. The story was so intriguing and the casting was just perfect. I'm amazed at how well the two unknown actresses had acted in this. They gave amazing oscar-like performances, very much like the acting seen in hollywood films during their heyday. You can find everything in this film including suspense, horror, mystery, drama, comedy, art and erotica.

The whole 1950's vibe in this film really brought back a sense of nostalgia back into Hollywood cinema. It makes movies feel alive again. The setting makes you feel like the movie takes place during the 50's when it actually takes place during the present day. We actually don't know that for sure, Lynch doesn't tell us, it could have taken place during the 50's, who knows? The entire film is actually this freakin twisted. Anyways, the film in itself is great. The film is beautifully shot and the cinematography, especially the lighting and color, is extraordinary. David Lynch's unconventional way of shooting things and telling stories is very much like that of Orsen Welles and Alfred Hitchcock. Like their films, Mulholland Drive is a very visual film with a lot of vivid imagery. This is best displayed during the climactic scene of the story when the whole story changes after a mysterious blue box is unlocked. We find that the main character, Betty, has disappeared and her friend Rita has become unconscious. After the pandoras box is opened, we are brought back to reality and we are introduced to two new characters, Diane and Camilla. The whole dream sequence ends when Diane is awaken by a mysterious cowboy and starts rolling out of bed. We come to realize that Betty/Diane's reality is not as happy as we depicted it to be. We learn that Diane is an actress who exploits Camilla by using Camilla's fame and fortune for her own purposes of breaking into hollywood, but instead she only finds herself falling in love with Camilla along the way. During their affair, Camilla unexpectedly dumps Diane for the director, Adam Kesher, and takes the role that's supposed to be Diane's big break. This leads to Diane's jealousy and frustration in a gut-wrenching masturbating scene. Feeling that she lost everything, she seeks revenge and hires a hitman to kill Camilla. When she finds out that the hit has been made with the presence of a blue key, she kills herself.

The acting in this film is superb especially by Naomi Watts. Naomi Watts' true life story of struggling to get roles and finding her big break in films helped her a lot in portraying this character. This ended up being her big break and she has thrived ever since with 'The Ring,' '21 Grams' and other upcoming films. She shines onscreen especially during a lesbian love scene with actress Laura Harring. It's one of the most erotic love scenes I have ever seen captured on film. Laura Harring and Naomi Watts are stunningly beautiful and the reason alone to watch this. Surprisingly, Lynch's music composer Angelo Badalementi, even makes a rare cameo appearance in this. He is the man who drinks the coffee and spits it out in the scene where Adam Kesher and the casting agents argue about which girl to cast in their film. Other cameo appearances include the great Ann Miller, Robert Forster, Dan Hedaya and Billy Ray Cyrus.

The only flaws I can possibly think of this film having is in the DVD itself. There is no chapter search and no special features other than the theatrical trailer and the cast bio's. David Lynch intended it to be only one long chapter which was a mistake on his part. Another flaw I noticed was an edit in a nude scene. It's the scene where Rita takes off her robe. A part of her body is blurred for about a second. A terrible decision to make since it was unedited on the big screen. David Lynch fans will be disappointed about all this. Hopefully, a new special edition DVD will come out to replace this one with deleted scenes, commentary, interviews and most importantly a chapter search. It's unfair that about ten other countries have already released this as a special edition and the U.S. and Canada has not. Two foreign editions even have double discs full of special features. Why is this? Where is our special edition? Well, someday it will be released.

1484991,5,B00005JKJA,"I've just come here, fresh from watching this for the first time. I said it would be better reviewing it at this time since it is so vivid in my mind right now. This was one movie I kept meaning to get on DVD and watch but I never quite did, until now. I'm the type of person that finds it hard to sit through movies, especially when I'm watching them on my own. I do watch lots of them, but can find my attention wavering even through movies I like!

All I can say about this film is, my attention never once wavered, or even attempted to. It is one of the few films that has kept my attention, with a steely grip, on the screen. It's the type of film that everyone should watch, but you know won't.

Much has been made out of the 'decide for yourself' ending. Myself, I love films like that. Like Naomi Watts (my favourite actress) says in her interview in the extras, it's a movie that makes you think, who wants to see one that doesn't. Well said.

David Lynch can be an acquired taste to some. There is no doubt he is one of the most talented directors ever to exist though. He's on top form here and it's my favourite movie by him. It's weird in parts, as you would expect from Lynch. From tense moments such as the board room meeting between director Adam (Justin Theroux) and associates to moments such as Adam finding Billy Ray Cyrus (as a pool cleaner) in his wife's bed!

The plotline has been well summed up elsewhere on this page, all that needs to be said by me is that every actor and actress gives their best and it shows. No one performance is lacking, Justin Theroux as Adam is captivating, but most outstanding is Naomi Watts who plays Betty. The only words I can use to describe her performance are masterful and equissite.

Some reviewers have claimed this movie is 'pretentious', they should not be so critical. There is a difference between style and pretention. Anyone who has watched a David Lynch movie knows he doesn't do pretentious. He is really that complex and oblique. For those that hate Lynch, then I ask why would you watch this movie, as you would know you wouldn't like it!

1484993,5,B00005JKJA,"I'm not going to write about the plot of this movie because that would be pointless.  To start of, there is no real plot to the story, there isn't an order, but it does not by any circumstance lack cohesion.  If you have already seen this movie, read on you might mind an answer.  If you haven't don't, unless you become too baffled by it and you need a clue.

To explain this i'll have to use the actresses's names instead of the characters since I can't possible find another way to do it.

Bear with me:

1.  There is no order in space or time.  The whole movie (except for a few moments at the end when Naomi Watt's character hires an assasin, which is the key to understanding this) happens entirely in her head.  What triggers everything is the the Laura Harring character leaving Naomi's for the cowboy director. Naomi's personality becomes fragmented, hence, the first part of the movie, including the credits, are part of a dream, of an idealized reality.  This is the reason why at the first hour and a half or so of the movie there is a sense that everything being fake: from the way people act, to certain situation's that seem to have no connection with main ""plot"".  That was something that i found really breakthrough, these amazing actresses willingly act like they're on days of our lives just to give you a clue.  The horrible acting at the beguinning is COMPLETLY INTENTIONAL.

2. There are two deaths in the movie. One is Naomi's suicide (because her lover left her, and since she wouldn't come back she decides to kill her) and two, laura's death which we never get to see.

3. The blue box is the cathalicyst.  She's supposed to get the blue key after Laura is dead, which she sees on her table in the second bizarro part of the movie which is the only thing real.  In the dream world (1st part) Laura open it: the reason for this is that Naomi feels that Laura brought this upon herself.

4. The ""Silencio"" Theater part is the biggest clue, and it mean (to me anyway) that sadness (note the lighting) and confusion are really self induced.  Hence the ""No hay banda"".  There is no band.  It doesn't mean that nothing is real, it mean that everything is fake, it doesn't exist (think about it).

The purpose of this scene is not to confuse you, but to warn you.

5. Naomi is replaying and rearranging the whole thing.  Whether they really did have an affair or not is kind of a mystery.  She was obsessed, that much I can say, but I'm not sure if it was real.

6. She probably kills herself, not just out of repent (note the old people, representing good christian values, tormenting her) but out of misery: She realices after she wakes up that that particular relationship wouldn't have worked, ever.  didn't work in a dream of hers, it wasn't going to work in real life, but by that time it's already late, she has already killed her.

7. The Director, lossing his grip.  The only reason she dreams of him the way she does is because she wishes he had no power, she feels that's the main reason Laura preffers him over her, who in turn, has absolutely no power.  She has lost all control.

With this explained I hope you can figure out the rest because it would be just to long to explain.  The main thing is this:  Think of the movie backwards.  It's not about what happens, it's about how she feels and about how she thinks Laura's character feel, and about how she wishes things would have turned out.  The grimmest parts are the real ones.

I really congratulate David Lynch for having loosened and tied the stings in new and amazing ways, this is what he is a master at.  It's not that hard to understand, it's just that audiences have no interest in understanding it.

Give the movie another chance and once you get you'll really thank Mr. Lynch for making you dust off your brain.

Remember that something you may not be able to explain since this was originally a pilot for a tv series (just like lost highway) that also, never got made, so some pieces might be missing, or maybe I still just haven't found them.",1095033600,9,4043,4.4135135135135135
1484994,1,B00005JKJA,"Well, I finally saw this movie, and I am yet another person who did not get a single second of it. What happened in this movie? Was it one big dream? I have always thought it would be the biggest cop-out if a director were to make a film full of strange occurrences and crazy characters...and then have someone wake up. ""Oh, it was all a dream!"" A convenient way to end a movie when the director himself is probably down to the line and just as confused with what he's done to that point as his audience is going to be.

Congratulations to those who did get the point of this, but to me this is like the modern art piece that consists of paint splashed all over a canvas. My friend looks at it and sees life, love, anger, hate, the world, etc. I see paint. My personal feeling on this movie is that it was splashed together like the canvas...and this time there really is nothing but a whole lot of color.

In conclusion, I felt like the movie was more designed to spark debate for decades rather than create an enjoyable story that blows your mind but makes you feel some kind of emotion; that seems to me the mark of a self-important director with misguided creativity rather than the creator of a great work.",1094428800,15,1211,4.283842794759825
1484995,1,B00005JKJA,"Not everything David Lynch does has to be driven by an inner meaning.  There are several films that arrest the audience with a macabre web of suspense, and end in that one hair-raising ""Aha!"" moment. On and of the spectrum of classics such as Memento and The Sixth Sense where the director had clearly thought through the consistency of the plot.  Then there are others bodies of confusion such as Swimming Pool and Mulholland Drive where the directors had either been unable or unwilling to keep everything consistent.  These movies do not add up not because they are brainchildren of beings with a higher level of intellect, but rather because directors like David Lynch are so focused on confusing the audience and living up to their reputation that they pay little attention to making the ends meet. It is sad to see Mulholland Drive being compared to Memento, a movie that leaves no loopholes, and yet lives up to being a ""Moebius Strip"" and a real brain-teaser. Mulholland Drive is the result of a film major flunking a logic class.

To add insult to injury, the DVD is not divided into chapters! (I guess Lynch didn't want you to take a sneak preview on the finale! (""Silencio""!)",1094083200,7,1186,4.714975845410628
1484996,4,B00005JKJA,"Sometimes there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the combinations of movies they come up with in these 2-packs but with ""Mullholland Drive"" and ""Swimming Pool"" they came up with a quirky combo.  If you do not like David Lynch and those who make movies in that mold then you should know that going in and can just avoid these two.  But if you like quirky films that force you to think to figure out what the hell just happened in a movie, then this is a well-suited pair.

""Mulholland Drive""  is written and directed by David Lynch and is certainly more style than substance, with Lynch creating his more surrealistic film yet. There might be those who think that this is some sort of film noir because there is a scene where a couple of hard-boiled cops show up and spout film noir type dialogue. But there are bits and pieces of different film genres throughout the film, which is another clue to the tapestry of Lynch's tale.  When the second main character in the drama, Betty (Naomi Watts), gets off the plane in Hollywood ready to pursue her quest to become a star, it never dawned on me that there was more to the kindly old couple that wishes her well and drive off in a limosine. Betty moves into an apartment, only to discover Rita, who has apparently suffered amnesia after her near death experiences, taking a shower. Betty is from Canada, so she opts for helping Rita rather than calling the police. The two become friends and more than friends in a couple of the best sex scenes seen in a movie in the last decade (they also serve to underscore how unsexy most sex scenes are in movies today).

""Mulholland Drive"" is a movie about Hollywood, or more appropriately the dream of Hollywood. It means something that Rita, who does remember her real name, pulls the one she uses from a movie poster for ""Gilda."" Betty is the plucky young kids from the sticks who wants to be a star. The unwritten rule about such people is that they would do anything to achieve their dream and in a sense Lynch's film just flips the dream over and looks at the nightmare side of the equation. However, I have no problem with the idea that for many of those who watch this film that ""Muholland Drive"" will not come close to making sense to them until the second time they see it and that many of those people are not going to make the effort. For those of us who have seen Lynch's other films, most notably ""Eraserhead"" and ""Blue Velvet,"" we knew going in that was probably going to be necessary. I mean, come on. This is David Lynch people. What did you expect?

As for ""Swimming Pool,"" I would say that it is more sensual than it is erotic, although ultimately the nudity in this film is secondary to the story. Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) is a British writer of crime fiction who apparently find no joy in her writing, her popularity, her publisher, or any the idea that any other writer might be writing something worth reading as well. Everyone is waiting for the next installment about her detective and she in uninspired. So her publisher (Charles Dance) offers her the use of his villa in France as a place where she can retreat and come up with a new book. Once there Sarah explores the house, taking notice of the leaf covered swimming pool in back. She also begins to write, and although we have no idea what she is writing about, Sarah seems productive and happy.

Then Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), the daughter of her publisher shows up as an unexpected guest.  Not only because Sarah assumed she would be alone, but because she did not know he had a daughter. If anything, Sarah has been waiting for him to show up so that she can get in a little relaxation with her rest. Instead Julie shows up and violates not only Sarah's privacy but here sense of propriety. Julie tends walk around topless by the pool and apparently shows no sense of discrimination in bringing home men to sleep with. We know Sarah disapproves of such practices, but this does not stop her from watching Julie, whether she is swimming in the villa's pool or making love to some strange man. It then becomes clear that not only is Julie becoming a part of Sarah's novel, but that something is going to happen.

""Swimming Pool"" is usually described as being a thriller, but that strikes me as being off the mark. It is more of a mystery, but in a subtle way, which explains why it is difficult to talk about director Franois Ozon's film without giving away too much. This is the sort of film where you are going to have to go back and at least watch the end of the film again, if not the entire thing from start to finish (just like with ""Mulholland Drive""), to make sure you understand what happened. What helped me out in untangling this film was that for most of it I kept asking what Sarah was writing. There was clearly a connection between what was happening and what Sarah was writing, but I kept waiting for Ozon to show us what that was, which, in the end, only goes to show how much I was fooled by this film. In this regard the film ends up being surprising rather than shocking, in keeping with the subtlety and sensuality of the film.

Although they are both quirky films they are certainly odd in decidedly different ways and it will be interesting to see which of these two you end up preferring.  The last piece of advice is not to watch them the same week (watching them back to back would do incredibly weird things to your brain).",1093910400,17,5429,4.428857715430862

None of the sequences blend together-and I don't want to have to spend time trying to figure it out. You don't have to have some psychic powers to understand the film. The fact is-it is just thrown together all weird and confusing. I thought there would be some amazing ending. I actually enjoyed sitting and watching it-up until the last quarter of the film when my mind was unable to decipher who was what or who.

1485068,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is without a doubt one of the most well crafted & thought provoking film of our time. While there has been over thousand reviews written about it, each with its own interpretations, here comes another one which will at best try to put together various pieces of this riddle which ultimately might provide answer to various queries & clear ambiguities. This film has received two extreme forms of reviews - either it has been tremendously appreciated or it has been trashed. I agree to the fact that this film is very hard to gulp if you watch it at a theatre for the first time. But the fact that the plot stays with you long after you have left the theatre or that you start brainstorming merely points to the fact that the film has accomplished in its motive to baffle you & putting a riddle in your head.

While I wouldn't go into the routine of telling what the story is all about, I would rather point out to some events, some characters or situations in the film and connect them with other events or moments in the film, which one should pay attention to. Even if you haven't seen it & want to discover it on your own or you have seen it once & plans another viewing (which is most desirable) - these observations might make it easier for you. In the beginning the camera focuses on a red cover & slowly zooms towards it. You hear a breathing sound from underneath it. That's where Diane's ('Betty' - Naomi Watts) dream begins. The dream continues...you see a car driving through the dimly lit Mulholland Drive....you see Camilla ('Rita'-Laura Harring)...she asks the driver ""What are you doing? We don't stop here."" Now move over to the part when Diane (Betty) is not dreaming & the events in reality is shown during the last half-hour of the movie. Diane (Naomi Watts) is being taken to a 'surprise party'....same road, same car, same camera angles....she asks ""What are you doing? We don't stop here.""

Camilla receives her...they start walking uphill. In her dream Rita (Camilla) walks downhill.

Think of the dream as opposite of reality. Look at the characters in real situations appearing at her dream with names she has encountered at various turns in her life.

* When Betty arrives at Aunt Ruth's house she meets Mrs. Lenoix. She tells Betty ""Oh! Just call me Coco. Everybody else does."" In reality she meets the same lady at the party; Coco says the exact same thing.

* In her dream Adam (Justine Theroux) is the director contemplating recasting the lead actress in his film. However he cannot make any choice on his own. He is shown the picture of a girl,' Camilla Rhodes', whom the 'Castiglianni Brothers' insist should be selected for the part. Watch out since the same girl in the photo is the girl who whispers at Rita's ear & kisses her at the party.

* In her dream the Director's (Theroux) life is in shambles - both personally & professionally. In reality it is just the opposite. He declares his engagement with Camilla (Rita).

* A very interesting thing is the 'Cowboy' character. He sort of bullies the director to select the 'girl in the photo'-Camilla Rhodes. But where does he come from? Just pay attention to the scene at the party-again! The girl (in the photo) comes, whispers at Rita's ear, kisses her & walks away. At the same time a guy with a 'white hat' passes by. Well he's the 'cowboy' at her dream.

* The hit man whom Diane hires to kill Camilla (Rita) seems inefficient in her dream. He messes up when he tries to kill a guy. In reality he is very skillful. Take a look at the guy standing near the counter when Diane is having a conversation with the hit man at 'Winkies'.He is the same ""weird guy"" at Winkies at the beginning talking about his strange dream & ""God-awful feelings."" In a way he is inconsequential to the actual events, but he reflects Diane's (Betty's) fear & anxiousness in her dream. This guy was, in reality, standing beside the counter - in her dream Betty sees this guy talking about how he has seen the man sitting opposite to him ""by the counter""- looking scared.

Paying attention to these small but relevant instances is what is going to make this film even more interesting to you. Actually Lynch uses the unique style of presenting fantasy as if its reality & the transition from dream to reality are not shown in a decipherable manner. Again if you pay attention to the 'Party' scene, we find jerky camera movements, hazy shots - things we expect in a surrealistic sequence. Well that is Mr. David Lynch for you!!! With such brilliance at every shot, Peter Deming's cinematography, Angelo Badalamenti's awesome score & of course both Naomi Watts & Laura Harring's performance it would be unfair to give this film anything less than five stars.

In a nutshell this film can be looked upon as the story of a girl who comes to L.A. with stars in her eyes, to make it big in Hollywood. In the process she meets another beautiful actress, falls madly in love with her which slowly turns obsessive & she also gets ditched by her. She gets mixed up in a world of treachery, nepotism, lies & false promises - all hidden behind the flashy lights, glitz & glamour of Hollywood. She takes revenge. But her action keeps haunting her; she repents it, laments it & all these completely erode her mentally & physically. You see the once beautiful & aspiring actress literally enter a world of self destruction. And you become a part of her journey through life. What could be better than having a DVD which you can watch over & over & keep on discovering newer things every time? This film is Lynch at his best. A true masterpiece & a MUST BUY.",1093651200,15,5640,4.5642292490118574
1485069,1,B00005JKJA,"Lynch's favorite approach seems to be to throw together whatever weirdness happens to leap out of his subconscious and leave it to reviewers and viewers to attach some sort of deeper meaning to all the nonsense.  Sorry, I'm not interested in playing that game.  Yes I suppose there might be a semi coherant plot somewhere in there between all the onresolved subplots, abandoned characters, hallucinations, and dream sequences, but I was just too bored to care enough to sort it all out.  I was not impressed by all the symbolism or the baffling way the story unfolds. This was pretentious garbage, though stylishly done.  After reading the reviews raving about this movie, I'm even more sure of that.  I really couldn't care less about how the cowboy represented Diane's conscience, the tiny old people ""spectors of her lost innocence"", etc etc.  I have to laugh when I read how profound some people think this nonsense is.

1485074,5,B00005JKJA,"I had heard through the grapevine that Mulholland Drive was absolutely spectacular.  The Cannes Film Festival was raving about it, and well, something made me take a ride to buy this DVD.  I had never seen it before, and other than Dan Hedaya, I didn't really know any of the names (I saw this before I saw The Ring).  I wasn't really familiar with David Lynch's work before.  So I threw the DVD in with an open mind, and was completely amazed for 2 hours and 30 minutes.

I can't really even give a plot description other than this, and even the description on the back of the DVD is incredibly vague and somewhat misleading.  Basically, a woman (Laura Elena Harding) who we come to know as ""Rita"" (although, she acquired this from a Rita Hayworth poster), was in a rather serious accident, and came out unscathed, other than having amnesia, and escapes to a house on Sunset, where the occupant seems to be leaving to go somewhere.  Enter Betty (Naomi Watts), as it seems that she will be able to use this house while she's trying to make her career in acting.  Also in the mix is a mildly successful director, named Adam, who is being controlled by an agency to cast a certain girl in his new movie.  Rita and Betty strike up a friendship which evolves into passion until everything unravels, and we're in a different universe.  That's pretty much the best way I can describe it, without giving everything away.

Now, I'm not usually one to speak omnisciently about how one might feel watching this amazing film, but in this case, I think it's viable.  You're going to throw this in, and for the first 105 minutes, you're going to be bewildered.  Nothing seems to make sense, and everything is just a wee bit melodramatic.  Everything will seem disconnected, and meaningless.  And then the last 45 minutes will come, and you'll be even more confused, unless you have a real acute sense of attention, and miraculous understanding.  Maybe this seems like I'm straying you away

But here's the thing, and trust me when I say this.  Every scene is there for a reason.  The way people act, behave, and socialize is all very important, along with everyone's lifestyles.  The true genius here is in how it's all put together, how the director deliberately fools you into thinking that everything is absolutely meaningless and disconnected, and you may wonder why you wasted your time.  I was too determined to figure out what was going on to give up on this movie, and man, it just opens up a whole new line of thinking.

If you want something that will tickle your brain, so you can stray away from Spiderman, and all these commercially-fond movies, then I definitely recommend this, because your brain will have to be on full to fully absorb everything this film has to offer.  Naomi Watts delivers an Oscar-worthy performance here.  Not recommended to anyone under 18 (it is Rated R), for sexual themes, and full nudity.  Keep an open mind throughout, and remember that everything you see will have its explanation.  You just have to find it.",1092009600,10,3040,4.646067415730337
1485075,4,B00005JKJA,"I thought this was an interesting film noir about love and competition in Hollywood, in ex-Eagle Don Henley's phrase.  In the course of the film lead actress Naomi Watts is transformed from an ingenue, freshly arrived from Canada and all agog over her prospects as an actress in Hollywood after winning a jitterbug contest, to a spooked, depressed,jaded, disheveled, and humiliated woman who has also been spurned by her lesbian lover, Camilla, the film's other female lead. So jealous is she that she arranges to have her lover shot. The film is ""looped"" in a surrealistic fashion so that the end is the beginning and the beginning is the end, much like the film ""Memento"". The film follows some tortuous dreamlike sequences; in fact the whole movie is a dream experienced by Betty.  The film is a masterpiece of horror and  includes numerous short scenes concerning  underworld characters, detectives,a cowboy,the landlady, and important Hollywood types most of whom turn out to be relevant to the main plot.  There are numerous auditions, a hatbox full of money, and a mysterious square blue box which opens with a blue key. Rita a.k.a. Camilla is a voluptuous brunette and successful actress who becomes an amnesiac following an accident on Mulholland Drive, and newly arrived blonde Betty a.k.a. Diane attempts to help her regain her identity. While it appears early in the film that Betty and Rita will become good friends, it turns out exactly the opposite in the film's diametrically opposed second half. The first half of the film is bright, bathed in colorful light, and quite optimistic, mostly because of Watts' stellar performance as a young, aspiring actress. But whether this is dream or reality is unclear. The film's second half is equally bleak and almost hedonistic, among other qualities. It reminds me of Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" Because time and action in the movie are surrealistic, we can only begin to piece together the story by the end of the movie.  The story is ultimately one of high expectations, jealousy,betrayal and certainly not the least lesbian love. There is no explicable reason why Diane should not be successful, but her Aunt Ruth is her only ally--and she uses Ruth's insurance money to pay off a hired gun. At Adam's dinner party, it is almost as if he and Camilla (and a second Camilla,as well)and Adam's mother  are all mocking her.
  Camilla's notable success as an actress might be attributed to reverse discrimination; Adam's success as a director might be attributed to his conversation with the cowboy and to his consequent decision to cast the other Camilla in a lead role.
  There are some scenes in the movie that appear to be somewhat gratuitous: for example, the scenes at the diner where a man claims to have seen a monster out back in a dream, and the monster man nightmarishly appears around a corner, and also appears later in the film with two little men who wind up in Diane Selwyn's apartment, appear designed mostly to spook the viewer. Likewise the scene where the director, angry over finding his wife in bed with another man, pours red paint over her jewelry.  But such techniques have been used by other directors. Diane's sad suicide is possibly more the rule than the exception in Tinseltown.",1091750400,4,3258,4.9143897996357016

1485265,5,B00005JKJA,"I loved this movie the first time I watched it, and I still love it after three viewings. Now, I understand the ""basic"" structure of the movie, but not all of the details. The movie is understandable and David Lynch has not made a movie that only David Lynch can understand. It was carefully constructed and absolutely requires repeated viewings to understand it (what could be better in a DVD than a movie that you have to watch over and over again to understand everything?).

 In any event, let me give a hint to anyone interested in understanding the movie. After the initial shot of a jitterbug competition, we see the main character of the movie. A minute later, we see someone falling asleep into red covers on a bed (don't see the person, but we see it from the person's point of view). The next two hours of the movie are a dream.

 After about two hours, the main character, Diane Selwyn, wakes up from her dream. You know this because she wakes up from the same red covers that she fell asleep on (in the first few minutes of the move).

 Diane has mental problems relating to her being spurned by her lesbian lover Camilla Rhodes (Camilla is in love with a man, but also seems to like the lesbian scene - just not with Diane anymore). So, Diane pays a hitman to have her killed, and supposedly, Camilla is killed. Diane is racked with guilt, mental problems and flashbacks of her time with Camilla. It is this mental breakdown and her hiring of a hitman, plus a scene where Camilla humilliates her at a party that make up the last thirty minutes of the film.

 There are many little details that I want to work out to completely understand the movie, but I definitely understand the most important parts. Here they are again.

 Main character is introduced at a jitterbug contest (real life, not fantasy).

 Main character falls asleep (dream -fantasy).

 Two hours of dream happen, and the exact meaning of every detail cannot be completely explained, but many of the characters and situations make sense during the last half hour of the movie.

 Main character awakes (about 2 hours into the movie). This tells the real life story of Diane Selwyn and her hallucinations of Camilla. It also explains many of the characters in her dream, and her hiring of a hit man to kill Camilla.

 I don't want to give a lot away, because I want people to view the movie many times to get an understanding of this movie. There are so many little and subtle details that will enhance this experience.

 It's a phenominal movie and it really does rate as one of the best ever. Believe me, it is not just a Lynchian thing that no one is meant to understand. There is a rhyme and reason to the movie, it just takes several viewings to understand.

 I will not put myself in a position of mentioning this movie with other great movies of the past (even though I think it is up there with the best movies of any age), but it is one of those movies that require, yes require, many viewings to get even a basic understanding of what is going on.

 Once again, the simplest synopsis of all.

 About 2 minutes into the movie the main character falls asleep. For the next two hours the main character has a dream. After that, the character awakes and we are given the details of how she arranged to have her lesbian lover killed. This is the most basic idea of what the movie is about.

 I have never experienced a movie as complex and understandable as this before. It is a classic and I guarantee that future viewers and reviewers will see it as such. Like I said before, it really is not a movie that is simply Lynchian and cannot be understood. I honestly don't think cinema gets better than this movie.

 I don't suspect anyone will ever read this article, as it is somewhere around the 917th review of the movie, but hopefully, someone will find it useful.",1091145600,18,3850,4.458571428571428

It's a bit like visual poetry in that respect.

1485267,2,B00005JKJA,"I notice my previous review is getting only ""unhelpful"" votes.  So let me try to explain myself yet again.  David Lynch is interested in making preposterous movies.  David Lynch is perniciously interested in making movies that are basically terrible, yet terrible in a dissociative way.  The essence of a David Lynch movie is that it is a load of horse puckey, to quote the apartment manager in Mulholland drive.  What's that?  You want examples?  Well, lets take another of Lynch's movies, Lost Highway.  Bill Pullman's character is established as morosely mellow and more or less inert.  Cut to: a scene of him playing his saxophone in a club, ""wailing on it"" as they say.  This is in total contradiction to what we have just seen - contradiction being the main form of literary humor - but more importantly, Pullman is a very, very bad saxophone player.  His playing is preposterous.  One cannot take him seriously as a musician.  Another example, from the same movie, is Richard Pryor as the garage manager on the phone to a potential customer.  He says, ""We got eight guys here.  I'll let you talk to five of them; and if you can get that price from ONE of them, I'll let you ask the other three.""  Any questions?  Is this not self-evidently complete and utter nonsense?  And what about the fact that halfway through the movie Bill Pullman turns into a totally different guy and so is let out of jail.  After all, since he is not the same guy they put in there, they gotta let him out.  That follows, don't it?  Am I making myself clear?
No?  Okay, what about David Bowie in Fire Walk With Me?  He plays a Texan.  I am sure he was cast as a Texan precisely because David Lynch figured on Bowie being unable to do a convincing accent.  He says to his casting director, ""Let's have Bowie play the Texan.  He'll do a terrible job and it'll sound like sh*t.""  Am I getting through to you people now?  David Lynch intentionally makes very bad movies.  What?!?!? Another example?!?!?  Well, how's about Laura Palmer saying to her boyfriend, ""I'm long gone, like a turkey in the corn.""  ""Don't say that.  A turkey's one of the dumbest birds there is.""  (tears falling down her cheek)""Gobble...gobble...gobble...""  Can't you see what I'm saying to you?!?!?
DO YOU BEGIN TO SEE THERE IS NO BOY THERE IN THE DARK ROOM?!??!",1089936000,,2317,4.598039215686274
1485268,5,B00005JKJA,"I love all the bad reviews.  Thank God for them.  Movies such as M. Drive are not meant to be adored by the masses.  They are meant to be watched and revered time and time again by thoughtful fans of creative cinema.  I love the dope who apparently dislikes the movie because of the way espresso is described.  Go get another latte from starbux and stop complaining about brilliant movies...
I will not explain this movie to you even though I know every aspect of it and have unlocked the mysteries after endless viewings.  I do this not to be a bad human being but to allow you to figure it for yourself and, hopefully, have as much fun and enjoyment doing so as I did.
Plus, I am certain that many of you out there have already discovered the ultimate knowledge such as I have.
I will say, however, that the film is very psychological, very surreal, beautifully directed and with excellent cinemotography.  The actors are largely unknown (a very good thing) and are all very believable as they clearly responded well to Lynch's directing.
M. Drive is an off-beat film that makes one think (another positive).  I hate to do it, but since the purpose of this review is not to explain storylines and sub-plots, but to get the reader to decide whether or not this is a movie for you I will compare it to some others (sorry).  Here are some names (again, sorry): Memento, Usual Suspects, Brazil, Blue Velvet, Apocalypse Now, Clockwork Orange, Lost HWY, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, Pi.
All of the above films are surreal, psychological studies into the paranoid mind and/or psychosis.  These are my kind of movies and thank the good Lord for D. Lynch and let us hope he is currently working on another project (and I don't mean anymore of those commercials of his!)
Also: I cannot believe the cheap price yet B-movies from the 80's are nearly twice the cost.  Maybe Mr. Espresso is the reason for that...
Now how about Twin Peaks season 2 on DVD???",1089936000,10,1940,4.545977011494253
1485269,2,B00005JKJA,"Here is a supplement to my previous review:  The whole idea of the movie is to throw as much crudola at the viewer as possible. It is a sadistic film.  Take for example, Naoimi Watts' character's audition.  First you see her going through it with her surprise roomate.  She is basically terrible.  Then, she goes to a studio and does the same audition there and is seemingly much better.  But in reality the acting she displays at the studio is also terrible.  The scripted scene is rubbish, and she acts like crap in it.  Other example?  The Castigliani brothers.  The one played by Angelo Badalamenti has a habit of ordering espresso.  His host seems to have had bad experiences in the past and assures him that this time, he will like it.  Badalamenti takes one sip and spits mewls the espresso disgustedly all over a napkin, much to the general consternation.  This scene is intentionally total baloney.  The host says, ""But that was one of the finest espressos in the world!""  This means nothing.  Anybody who knows anything about espresso, as I'm sure Lynch does, knows that there is no such thing as a ""fine espresso"" brand of coffee.  What makes for quality in espresso is, very freshly roasted coffee - of any reasonably good kind - pushed out of the machine at a rate of one ounce per 25 seconds by water that is somewhat less than 200 degrees farenheit.  This is what makes for fine espresso, and it is almost completely a matter of the skill of the person in charge of it, not at all a matter of looking on the internet for some ""espresso"" to buy and put in your crummy machine under what kind of grind you do not know.  The movie is full of this BS.  The movie is a series of vignettes whose main purpose is to be good and stupid.  Lynch likes to frig over his viewers.",1089763200,,1782,4.421538461538462
1485270,5,B00005JKJA,"Director David Lynch always polarizes his audience. The Webster's definition of polarize is: To cause to concentrate about two opposing positions.  That's what watching a Lynch film is all about, and it always baffles and amuses me when certain people take Lynch to task for being obliquely evasive.
What we have in Mulholland Drive is a sophisticated director's surrealistic vision of a highly refined dream world. Both dialogue and visual metaphors abound in many of Lynch's films, and I'm pleased to say that the Mulholland Drive's story is explored in the director's usually understated, though deliberately jarring, manner. Instead of going into the meaning of this film (which many have admirably attempted, even though it can be an exercise in futile subjectivity when it comes to Lynch), I think that I have more insight to give as far as what this kind of film means to me).
Although the cast, with Naomi Watts in particular displaying impressive range and depth, is memorably quirky and uniformly interesting, it is the framing of each scene and the flow between them that creates such a captivatingly edgy atmosphere. I've noticed that Lynch often will frame a shot as if it were to be photographed or painted, and this is no surprise since he began as an abstract expressionist painter.
Much credit as well should be given to Lynch for his judicious use of Angelo Badalamenti's moody film score as it is so effective in magnifying the dreamy glossiness into a tangible nightmare reality.
Of course, no matter how much I think that David Lynch is one of the world's most uniquely transformative filmmakers with Mulholland Drive being one of the most galvanizing, hallucinatory, and sadly affecting movies ever made, there will always be those who simply feel that behind the refined, wryly surreal surface qualities of the film lay nothing more than manipulative mood theatrics, with the actors seemingly there  more for decorative, rather than realistically emotive, purposes. I don't see these things as negatives, however. Here's why. Approaching his art in a painterly fashion, Lynch's images and sound work together in greater sympathy than is typically the case in film. This means Lynch conveys feelings by using emphasis and de-emphasis as if he were painting. Its as if he sees a particular scene as a primary color, and then proceeds to exagerate the hue, i.e. mood, by directing with broader, more dramatic strokes when he sees fit.
No one actor is the axis for it is the overall effect of the images and sounds utilyzed within a scene that creates the feel. Its not about how ""realistic"" the acting or events are, its all about how everything works as one in service of that great intangible, mood. The merging of the two diametrically opposed worlds of reality and dreams creates quite a tangible otherworldliness. I'd say David must be doing something right because, really, who else does this kind of filmmaking with the same flair? Its such a uniquely individual style that the term ""Lynchian"" is now commonly used as an adjective for the surreal. I am aware of the term ""Cronenbergian"". I do think director David Cronenberg is a visionary surrealist who shares some similarities with Lynch, but their methods of approach and aims, not to mention humor, are quite different.
It is quite common in Mulholland Drive and other of Lynch's films to feel an overall stillness, as if indeed viewing the painting of a dream world. The film / painting analogy is so common as to be a cliche, but the oddly detatched feel of Lynch's work has an air of mystery about it that, like an abstract expressionist painting, draws in anyone who cares to look at the imaginary recesses. The naysayers will say that this kind of approach to filmmaking achieves nothing more than simulated depth. I however, think Lynch's films have an uncommon degree of depth because of what they suggest.
Mulholland Drive suggests a number of possibilities, like all art that's worth a damn. In other words, where I believe the strength of this film lies in its suggestion of ambiguity.
It shouldn't have to matter whether or not there is a specific intent because we experience what we bring to the table, so to speak.
The viewer is allowed to freely interpret it as it suits them, and this is why I think this movie, for instance, divides people so. For some, the result is seemingly difuse. A common complaint by Lynch's detractors is that he suggests too much and delivers too little, thereby leaving ""loose ends"".
For others, myself included, there are no ""loose ends"", only possibilities that suggest freedom of interpretation within the context that the director presents.
I argue that Mulholland Drive's (and this of course goes for other Lynch films as well) point is recontextualizing the suggestions as the delivery. Its about the journey being all the points of its own destination (If I ever write a review of Lynch's 'Lost Highway', I would definitely want to state that).
The key to getting something out of Mulholland Drive, and other remarkable David Lynch films, that will resonate on a personal level, is to perhaps, ask yourself this: ""Do I prefer to be in control of my dreams or do I feel curious enough to surrender to them and stop questioning their validity?""
I for one prefer to just go with an experience such as this and realize that what I see is, in and of itself, its own reason for being. David Lynch is framing Hollywood sideways, painting in the borders of his own inner world off canvas, and onto film. If that last statement seems meaningless or is overreaching to you, then don't be surprised if you don't like Mulholland Drive or other surreal Lynch films.",1089763200,12,5685,4.877973112719752
1485271,5,B00005JKJA,"In the reviews I've browsed here, a lot of viewers have come up with fine stuff about this film, and gone far to explain its weird grasp on people, at least on viewers adventurous and patient enough to deal with it.  Not surprising that fans are obsessive about it; it's haunting. Maybe uncanny is a better word. I wanted to add a few points to the ongoing discussion.
The atmospheric shooting is splendid as many observe below, but there's another subtlety throughout, unless my memory's playing tricks: when the two women are together, even standing beside each other, Diane looks more or less real while Rita looks unreal, the details of her features hard to grasp. I don't know if that's done with makeup, lighing, computers, or what.
In movies like ""Belle du Jour"" and ""Persona"" which are partly dreams, the directors give us at least a signal to tell us what's real and what isn't. If I remember right, in Belle a cat meows every time Deneuve has one of her fantasies. Persona shows us Nurse Alma going to sleep and waking up--but later Bergman deliberately witholds those cues.
The thing about Mulholland Drive is, there's no overt cue at all that most of the film is Diane's dream---we can only understand that in retrospect. In other words, we have to wait till near the end to hear ""Wake up, little lady."" In retrospect, then, we can understand the surreal intensification of the colors, and the way the apparent realism starts to disintegrate in the theater scene: Lynch is preparing us for the shock of finding it's all been a dream.
I have to wonder, though, if the last part of the movie is entirely real either, or more a matter of waking up from one dream into another. After all, at the engagement party we see the nameless Cowboy walking past in the background. To me that says: this is the real Diane, the real situation, but it's still a dream. For my money, the whole movie is a flash in Diane's mind at the moment of... Well, I won't spoil that at least.
In fact the thing that most moved me about this film was the human story. I'd never thought of Lynch as caring all that much about his characters, but here he does. In her dream Diane is an innocent ingenue, starry-eyed at Hollywood, a natural genius as an actress, astounded and transformed by her unexpected love for another woman. The real Diane is a hard-bitten, strung-out, murderous lesbian and a failed actress. And in Diane's dream if not in reality, her lover survives the murder attempt on Mulholland Drive---and Diane is her savior rather than her killer. Naomi Watts is justly celebrated for what she did with that role. It's overwhelming.
I've only seen it, oh, three or four times. I crave more. For a while it seemed to be running on the Mystery channel every other night. Probably a good idea. I used to feel Lynch was a bit too much into weirdness for the sake of weirdness--see ""Eraserhead."" Here he's stranger than ever, but every bit of it has a point, contributes to the unfolding of a real human tragedy however bizarre. If Lynch can build on this, he'll be one of the very greats.",1089244800,11,3080,4.569620253164557
1485272,2,B00005JKJA,"you don't see a reviewer actually admit to being too dumb to understand a movie, but that's what happend in my case with this movie...
all i know is that there was a blue box, and all of a sudden no one had the right name anymore!  it made sense for about an hour and a half... but then i lost track of what was going on.  and i agree with the guy who said people re-watch this for the sex scenes.  they were pretty spicy.  but not spicy enough for me to bother with this confusing film again.
it's along the lines of pi and donnie darko, but those movies actually made sense.  i'd recomend those instead.",1089158400,4,605,4.093220338983051
1485273,5,B00005JKJA,"To think: when I first saw this film two years ago, I absolutely DETESTED it.  I was sure it was an improvised recipe of every nightmarish Freudian symbol, designed to appeal to erzatz intellectual types who would decipher all kinds of meaning out of a film that actually had NO meaning to discern, other than to make money and create buzz.  I also buzzed endlessly about it: about how stupid, infuriating, and manipulative it was.
After seeing ""Mulholland Drive"" three more times, I can now safely say that it is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. If abstract artists like Picasso, Magritte or Dali were filmmakers instead of painters, they would be creating sensory experiences like this.  Visually, David Lynch's depiction of Hollywood is vivid and dead-on, and that's an understatement.  Color-choices and lighting leap out at you, playing out against the backdrop of Angelo Badalamentis' dissonant, dream-like musical score.  The acting from Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Thereux is astounding, especially considering how difficult it must have been for Lynch to explain to his cast WHAT the heck was going on with their characters.  And on the subject of characters, not since ""Rosemary's Baby"" has a director populated a film with such a dazzling, weird, instantly recognizable cameo appearances, from Ann Miller, Lee Grant, Chad Everett, and Billy Ray Cyrus.  It is almost impossible for me to believe that ""Mulholland Drive"" was originally intended for network television!  Strange, but true!
Oh, yes: The Plot.  It is extremely challenging to figure out, but it CAN be done.  I recommend that you reserve your sharpest observation for the last 45-minutes of the film, which can be tricky, because I guarantee you will feel like you're going into a hypnotic trance by that point. I am lucky enough to have many respected friends in the dramatic arts who kept encouraging me to revisit ""Muholland Drive"" long after I had sworn it off (one actress-friend of mine even gave me her own tiny list of clues to watch for).  At one point, I had become obsessed enough to sit and watch ""MH"" with a pad and pencil taking notes!  When the light bulb finally went off in my brain, I was hooked.  I won't bother to write a ""spoiler"" here, but if anybody wants my theory (I believe it is 99% accurate), feel free to e-mail me.
""Mulholland Drive"" is a keeper, especially for cinema buffs, to be watched again and again over the years,.  More, please, Mr. Lynch!",1088467200,15,2477,4.866666666666666
1485333,2,B00005JKJA,"Just consider this movie without its lesbian hazy shadow and without the stunning offensive few shots of the amazingly sexy Laura Harring: the movie is not worth watching at all. It is nothing like Blue Velvet, Leaving Las Vegas or Pulp Fiction (real Noir and Mayhem).
I strongly believe it is only these shots of naked extreme beauty calling for weird sex that entice the viewer to see the movie repeatedly. You may notice from the reviewers that everybody saw it more than once.",1088294400,4,480,4.726190476190476
1485334,5,B00005JKJA,"This is not a simple film.  I can tell you someone was murdered (or I think I know), and by the end, I'm sure someone commits suicide (or I think I'm sure).  And along the way, there's a lesbian romance between an amnesiac and a dance contest winner with big-screen ambitions; there's a thuggish hit man; a book with important names in it; a film director coerced by mobsters into selecting a particular actress; another hit man made more frightening by his folksy cowboy affectations; a blue cube in which the whole fiction is possibly stored (and a blue key to unlock it); a sinister homeless man living behind a restaurant; and a theater of pantomining performers -- to list just a few of the incongruent oddities that comprise this film.  If you're looking for something different in the way of cinema, this list of characters and props should pique your curiosity.

To date, I've seen MULHOLLAND DRIVE between fifteen and twenty times, and I honestly can't tell you with exactness what it's really about.  But it doesn't matter.  Instead of concretely and objectively comprehending it, it's interesting to watch how David Lynch strings all of this together.  Every scene is compelling to watch, and the plot is vaguely alluded to by the similarity of some compositions.  It's just difficult to tell where to look for the rest of it.  In any case, the result is you're seduced into watching it, like being hypnotized, lulled by your fascination with Lynch's dreamy blend of menace and humor, and his sublime imagination.  It's not just a film: It's a journey into the labyrinth of Lynch's creativity.

As he's done with some of his other more abstract films, Lynch establishes a unique relationship with his audience.  I believe he's a prankster of sorts, but not one who wishes to make the viewer a fool.  Instead, he weaves the blackest of comedy into a mysterious tale, the humor slithering through it like a hallucinogenic plant through a trellis.  Lynch's respect for the viewer is comprehended only when the viewer allows him- or herself to become part of the humor, by submitting to it.  What appear as segues and non sequiturs then become vignettes in a baroque gallery.  A Lynch film is indirectly about Lynch's imagination.  The art is in the connecting of images and characters of mind-boggling originality, Lynch pushing his imagination to the extreme while respecting some indefinable limit, thereby maintaining a semblance of structure.  The bewildering sequences are so mesmerizing, you don't really care if you get your mind all the way around whatever happened.  Lynch pushes buttons that alternately amuse and repulse us.  He's captured what a dream feels like, with characters reacting to the most puzzling phenomena as if they're commonplace occurrences.  When it's over, you can't with certainty make sense of it.  Feel free to take guesses, but don't take them seriously or you'll deprive yourself of the fun, though ""fun"" might be putting an inaccurate spin on Lynch's accomplishment, making it less than what he intended.

Let not my gushing over Lynch lead you to believe that he's the only talent in evidence here.  I found all of the actors, even the ones with small roles, to be very convincing.  The script demands that all of the primary actors play two roles, as toward the end -- after the unlocking of the mysterious blue box -- everyone becomes someone else.  The transformation of Naomi Watts from the naive ""Betty"" to a downtrodden and betrayed ""Diane"" was the most striking.  But Justin Theroux as ""Adam Kesher,"" the personally and professionally beleaguered director, was my favorite.  His performance was natural and understated, and the exchange between him and ""the cowboy"" is my favorite scene in the film.  The beautiful Laura Elena Harring as ""Rita"" is a doe-eyed, quivering victim until the blue box is opened, then confident and patronizing as ""Camilla Rhodes"" after the dream is over.

Now, here's the caveat about this DVD: It's not divided into chapters.  If you want to take a look back at a previous scene, for heaven's sake, don't accidentally hit the wrong button.  You'll find yourself back at the very beginning of the film and the only way to get back to where you were is by fast-forwarding.  It's all very weird for a major title release, so this DVD production seems to be an extension of Lynch's bizarre sense of purpose.

The DVD's extra features consist of the theatrical trailer, and production notes, the actor and director biographies.  The biographies are typical, each concluding with a list of previous film credits and so on.  Except for Lynch's.  His biography consisted of two lines.

1485335,2,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch, who directed this movie, IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!
I learned many years ago that David Lynch is very talented but that his movies are hit and miss. When I see a title by Lynch, I am intrigued but ultimately ambivalent. I recall the cinematic pleasure I received from viewing ""The Elephant Man"" and ""Blue Velvet"". However, when I recall that this is the same director who gave us ""Dune"" (the worst science fiction movie I've ever seen) and ""Wild at Heart"" (had one titillating scene but was too much like watching an overly melodramatic film on acid), I have passed other films of his by.
""Muldholland Drive"" was typical David Lynch from the beginning. There is a compelling (if unbelievable) plot here, but there is an eerie sense of the unknown penetrating every scene that made me question thirty times in the first fifteen minutes if I was in the mood for this crap tonight. I gave it a chance and found myself drawn in.
I was engrossed in this film through the first ninety minutes. Then, I accidentally turned my DVD player off while trying to stop the movie for a minute. I was irritated to find out that this DVD does not have a scene selection feature to allow you to approximate with accuracy where you had left off. I never watched the final portion.
I was enjoying what I saw. I would have given this film 3 STARS, but the absence of the scene selection feature on the DVD makes me lower the overall rating to 2 STARS.",1087430400,4,1437,4.467680608365019
1485336,5,B00005JKJA,"I watched this about thirty times in 2001, stopping only when I had reached a near-breaking point. (Any more thought devoted to this movie at that time would surely have caused an internal snap similar to the one which one a main character is experiencing.)  After that point, in all honesty, I didn't watch it for about two years, even though I loved it, because, I'd felt, I had soaked in eveything I could about the movie.
Well now.  I just re-watched MD about two weeks ago, and all I can say is, boy was I wrong.  I hadn't even begun to catch all the many deliberate clues utilized by Lynch in nearly every scene
of this movie. I won't tell you what they are (this is, I'm happy to say, a dummy-proof movie), but i will tell you this:  most of the clues in plain sight or, just as often, within earshot.  Not only should you watch this movie very closely, you should listen just as closely as well. If you do, you'll be vey pleasantly rewarded. (The only other thing I'll say is this: Diane Selwyn is, in one way or another, in every frame of this movie, haunting it like a ghost or a the shadow of a ghost.
As for those who say this is just a copout movie, all I can say is: You're wrong.  As for others who say this is just a repeat of Lost Highway, all I can say -- with utmost auhtority -- is: you're wrong, too. MD is superior to LH in every way, not least because it's probably Lynch's first film since BV in which he allowed his subconcsious to write the movie, not other people's expectations.  Regardless of the reasons for this (canceled pilot, French backing), the result is still a masterpiece of psycho-sexual surrealism and wicked satire, as well as a truly poignant story of tragic delusion, dreams bought and sold, and romance failed. (Whether this romance ever actually occured or not is, like most things in this movie, left up in the air.) The only ohter movies, to me, of Lynch's that have this power are Eraserhead nad Blue Velvet.

1485338,1,B00005JKJA,"I'll probably get alot of ""unhelpfull"" about this review but I'm going to state MY OPINION about David Lynch JUNK MOVIES and the ""warping of his viewer's minds"" into THINKING or believing they just seen a great ""artistic"" movie.  How anybody can call this movie ""artistic"" is beyond me. I just don't get it.  David Lynch can take dog doo and make a movie out of it and his ""fanatic fans"" will ""analyze it"" and make something out of a ""nothing coherent story"". ""Mullholand Drive"" in MY OPINION IS just that, a story with not much of a story. I've read numerous reviews on this movie just to TRY and understand WHY people liked this movie. I am glad for those people out there that enjoyed it and found it intresting or entertaining and ""facinating"", but I found it VERY SLOW, dull and not to mention very boring.  David Lynch's REAL GOOD movies such as, ""Blue Velvet"", ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"", and ""Wild At Heart"" had depth, good story telling, and most imortantly,---as an average film go'er, I could ""FOLLOW"" what the heck is going on, unlike this movie or his last one ""Lost Highway"". I was waiting impatiently to see a GOOD David Lynch movie, then this one came out. However, after surviving through, and most importantly,--wasting over 4 hours of my life watching his last 2 UNEXPLANABLE ""non-artistic"" garbage of movies--""Lost Higway"" & ""Mullholand Drive"", I am so disgusted with David Lynch being ""high on himself"" and his non-coherent movies, that I will probably never see another one of his movies.  I THINK (in my opinion), David Lynch must THINK his movies are ""art work"", and has been sucessful enough to make himself believe that he is ""A legend in his own mind"" or something, and is unfortunatly allowed by Hollywood to make anything he wants on film. And most importantly or sadly, Hollywood allows this because HIS FANS buy tickets to see this kind of bologna nothing-makes-sence story making. They (Lynch fans) come out in amazement of what they witnessed. How extrodinary it was. Love to ANALYZE his ""Art work"", and they figure out a way to explain Lynch's own madness of suppossed film making when it's actually garbage. No way will the Lynch fan admit the movie stinks. Even if mediocre at least. They just call it ""artistic film making"" when it stinks. I guess that is what Lynch's version of ""Dune"" was. Another fine work of his art.  Me, I just don't get it I guess. In this latest BOMB, I was more bored than ""Lost Highway"". Don't get me wrong, I do love Lynch's GOOD movies of ""Twin Peaks"", Wild At Heart"", and ""Blue Velvet"". BUT, David Lynch's success from just those 3 movies has blinded his current and latest attempts at film making, even worse than his first bomb ""Dune"".  I know I'll get alot of flack for this review but as a movie go'er (and in my opinion) I want to be entertained. I don't mind having to think about what's going on in a movie (some movies have been excellent in that regards), but to try and figure out what's going on in a director's mind or some writter's mind that doesn't come out coherent by the end, doesn't entertain & makes for a bad movie. I believe that Lynch probably didn't have anything written down or no actual script when he filmed ""Mullholand Drive"". I think he must have been allowed by the studio to just film away knowing that his fanatic fans will buy into anything he puts on film. Coherent or especially non-coherent. IN MY OPINION this movie bored me to death and had nothing to offer except cheesy lesbian scenes to titilate those that might give up trying to figure out what the heck is going on during this overly long slow paced B-rate movie that should've ended up as a TV Movie on the Playboy Channel.",1085011200,5,3691,4.56797583081571
1485339,5,B00005JKJA,"I have hesitated to write a review of this film for several years now.  The chief reason for this is that ""Mulholland Drive"" is my favorite film ever, and I despaired of ever getting the proper emotional distance required to review the film.
However, it has now been several months since I've had a chance to see the film, and I think its strengths and weaknesses have settled fairly well in my memory.  This film is quite simply a triumph of expert filmmaking.  I will admit that David Lynch's record was spotty up to this point.  I found ""Blue Velvet"" captivating but thought ""Eraserhead"" was too deliberately misanthropic and offputting.  But Lynch has finally found the right idiom and plot for his unique style of filmmaking.
The first strength you notice about this film is that it is positively dripping with atmosphere.  Lynch's strong use of color drenches every frame in a wash of film-noir paranoia; it is obvious just from looking at the screen that something is not right here.  Fabrics and wallpaper are just never THAT bright; foliage and jewelry leaps off the screen with its vividness.  The film's second strength is incredible acting, particularly from Naomi Watts.  Her failure to receive an Academy Award for this performance was the beginning of my current distrust for the Academy's choices.  Watts is here required to play two different roles, one vastly different from the other.  It is a feat she accomplishes flawlessly, shifting from one character to the other so completely that at first I didn't realize it was the same actress playing both roles.  Laura Harring lends capable support, her face and acting style a throwback to a thirties melodrama.  It is only appropriate that she chooses her character's name from a Rita Hayworth poster.
And now, for what I consider to be the final strength, but what some will call the first weakness: the plot.  (I will attempt not to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.)  The plot is what has caused this to be a hotly-debated film among my fellow film junkies.  There are numerous ways of interpreting the plot, but you'll have to watch the film at least twice to get a grasp on anything that's going on.  As the film opens, we meet Betty (Watts), a Canadian fresh off the plane to become a famous Hollywood actress.  Meanwhile, Rita (Harring) escapes an attempted assassination and a car crash with amnesia but no physical injuries and wanders into the apartment where Betty is staying.  Once Betty gets over the shock of finding Rita in her apartment, she decides to play detective and help Rita find out who's after her and why.  After a few scenes of typical movie detective work, the film takes a 180-degree turn and you are forced to question whether any of what you've just seen even happened.  Wound into this complex plot are threads dealing with an uber-hip movie director, a sinister cowboy, a dreadlocked monster living behind a tacky diner, and a film whose casting is directly controlled from above by a Mafia midget.  (Hey, it's a Lynch film; you knew the midget had to turn up eventually!)
The film is not easy to follow.  As I mentioned, it requires multiple viewings before sense can be hammered out of the film.  The list of plot elements above will give you a fairly good idea of how eclectic and challenging this film is.  It is also disturbing, with themes and occasional images of death abounding. Lynch has made a serious movie for people who are serious about their movies, and therein I believe lies the reason why so many are put off by this film.  Although I love it dearly, it is probably one of the least purely entertaining films I have ever seen.  The first few times you see it, you will be hunched beside the screen with a furrowed brow, piecing it all together.  It becomes more entertaining once you have your interpretation of the events and can simply sit back and watch.  It is not a film that will make you relax.  It will quite possibly disturb you.  It is a powerful film.  And yet, if you let it, it can be the most rewarding viewing experience you will have.",1084924800,10,4081,4.664335664335664

1485341,5,B00005JKJA,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, you won't be the same until you do.
I'm not the biggest fan David Lynch has ever had on this planet. But this movie is _so_ good that I'm finally willing to forgive him for his treatment of _Dune_ (1984).
_Mulholland Dr._ is mesmerizing. It will suck you in, chew you up, and never let you out. You will rewatch it many times, and every time you do, you will notice (or think of) something you haven't noticed (or thought of) before.
As you probably know from the other reviews, there is a division point about four-fifths of the way through the movie. You may find it confusing -- and you _will_ find it disorienting -- the first time you see it. But bear with it and let the movie soak into your subconscious for a couple of days, and then watch it again. It does make sense, I promise. (And this isn't just a cinematic Rorschach test; there really is an intelligible plot here. Pay close attention to the details Lynch points out in his 'ten clues', included with the DVD.)
I won't give anything else away. Just be warned: if you're the sort of person who obsesses over movies, this one will give you plenty to obsess about. Not only is it gorgeously filmed and tantalyzingly paced, its rich symbolic texture and all-around oneiric quality will involve parts of you that you may not have known existed. You will wake up in the middle of the night thinking, 'Aha! So _that's_ what that meant.'
The two leads (Laura Elena Harring and Naomi Watts) are spot-on in these very demanding roles -- especially Watts, about whose performance I can't say anything concrete without including major spoilers, but _boy_, is she good. And for whatever it's worth, be aware that there are a couple of really steamy lesbian sex scenes. Some viewers (which kind am I? you guess) will regard this as a huge plus; others maybe not so much. But either way, these scenes are not gratuitous.
Lynch gives a number of cinematic nods to lots of predecessors that can broadly be classified as films noirs (notably, and pretty obviously, Billy Wilder's _Sunset Blvd._). But this is not your standard film noir; it's a David Lynch movie, with everything that entails. Don't be quick to classify it.
It will haunt you. I strongly recommend that you let it.
(_A note on the DVD_: One thing you probably won't like about it is that the usual divisions aren't there; the _entire_ movie is just one long 'scene' or 'chapter'. That makes it a real pain in the posterior to flip back and forth while you're trying to remember where you spotted someone or something before. Lynch says it's because movies, unlike books, don't divide into 'chapters'. Fair enough -- but they _do_ divide into 'scenes'. And at any rate, there's such a thing as the viewers' convenience. So feh to that.)",1084406400,7,2786,4.596385542168675
1485342,4,B00005JKJA,"This movie was very good.  I really enjoyed that the plot made you think but was not too hard to understand after watching it a couple of times.  If you are still stumped, the DVD has 10 hints to solving the movie which really help a lot!  The music was cool too, and added to the surreal feel of the movie (especially Llorando at Club Silencio).  If for no other reason, the guys who usually wouldn't watch this kind of movie would appreciate the lesbian sex scenes.  Naomi Watts did a good job of playing a bad actress.  Only reason it didn't get five stars was that I thought the man behind the diner was a little bit cheesy.  I recommend the movie to anyone with a compotent brain under the condition that lesbian sex isn't a huge issue with them, because I know that's the sole reason my mom didn't like the movie.",1083456000,,819,4.279220779220779

I know a lot of people will try to justify the pretense of this movie by saying it's film noir and therefore quite artsy and above the average joe's comprehension.  Really, it's just a piece of crap trying to disguise itself as art. However, the movie did have some redeeming values.  Naomi Watts played her duel roles quite excellently considering the material she was given.  Also, the cinematography during the last phase of the movie was quite an enjoyable juxtaposition from the first half. Come on though!  Aren't you tired of being told to like something because it is abstract when you really feel like you got ripped off ?  ""Abstract""  is an exploited term usually thrown on any piece of garbage not good enough to stand on it's own as a valid piece of art.  Frankly, I'm tired of it being used as an excuse for lack of quality.  This film reminds me of standing in a museum trying to figure out how a piece of string taped to a canvas is supposed to move me.

1485462,5,B00005JKJA,"Apart from the fact that the film is a great stylistic achievement its great merit is it's openness to varied interpretations. In the first part of the film things happen according to a conventional narrative, but in the second the logic of events breaks down. If one tries to decipher what's going on I think he is apt to miss the enjoyment of the dream-like visual sequences. Yet this does not imply that there's nothing to understand. Dreams do have meanings. It's just that they defy the kind of eplanation which we apply to events in awake life. When I saw the film I was following this principle, I didn't let my self feel perplexed, I tried to attune with the images and let my intition do the work of the understanding. I left the cinema mesmerized, I felt that my experience was as close as you could get being sober to a hallucinogenic exprerience and that was fantastic!
For my part I felt that the film was preoccupied with the concept of personal identity. And if there was a message to it, for me it was this: free yourself from the illusion of the cartesian concept of the self as unitary substance and enjoy what happens. The Scotish philosopher David Hume argued that the self is nothing but a bundle of perceptions, no thing such as the self exists for whenever he entered most deeply into what he calls himself he never encountered anything but a perception and never a constant and invariable self. Now, the scene at the theatre where the band was performing a moving song reminded me of Hume's theory. There was no-one playing the song, yet it was moving. Ok, the connection is loose but this is what came to my mind. And then the girl's lapse of memory and in the end the changing of identities, reminded me of  Locke's theory of personal identity...
Just the fact that after leaving the cinema I was excited thinking all these things would be enough for me to give 5 stars to the film, and it was captivating in many more ways...",1081296000,3,1952,4.498591549295774

Everything is perfect in that movie, every shot, every angle, every sound, every actor, there are not life time performances by the actors, but they all match together so fine. it is a very well done movie, and it's full of ideas. Of course, if you are a pop-culture movie fan, this one is not for you. Stay away.
if you want to see how the french new wave, or the best of Felini can be surpassed by Lynch, well you got a chance with Mulholland Dr. Do I dare advize those of you who are likely to love this movie ( I think you don't need this advice really), but don't see it as a movie to explain, don't look for the clue, of course you can find it a clue, as many clues as you want. But see it rather as a metaphoric display of the artist psyche, oh boy, it gets so much tastier this way.

I guess you can't take this movie too seriously, and you can't drive yourself nuts trying to figure it all out.  It's a film noir with lots of style and yes, I agree with less substance.  I think Naomi Watts and Luara Harring (if I am not mistaken, she was a Miss America/Universe in her early twenties) did an excellent job portraying their respective characters.  It also helped that they are both very pretty because the camera is right on their faces a lot.  It was pretty brave of them to show off a lot without showing any skitishness or hesitation, that's why a fellow reviewer went as far as describing their sex scenes as one of the sexiest.  Most of the scenes were explicit to the point that you can actually tell, that these girls are all naturelle.  However I think this is just a sidebar and a distraction from one's task as a viewer, which is trying to make sense of it all and David Lynch's talent is making you care and keeping you facinated.  I like this movie a lot because it keeps you entertained and begs you to watch it several more times to make you really understand the premise.
The DVD itself gets ZERO STARS.  It has no extras, it doesn't allow you to skip, it has no scene index.  It would have been nice if Mr. Lynch spend a few minutes and perhaps shed some light on his thinking and methods in making the film.

1485465,4,B00005JKJA,"My son contacted me after watching ""Mulholland Drive"" and demanded that I explain the last ten minutes of this film.  I tried to provide the simple explanation--to wit, this 2001 film is written and directed by David Lynch--but that was not enough of an explanation.  Part of the problem, if you consider it to be such, is that ""Mulholland Drive"" is more style than substance, with Lynch creating his more surrealistic film yet.  There might be those who think that this is some sort of film noir because there is a scene where a couple of hard-boiled cops show up and spout film noir type dialogue.  But there are bits and pieces of different film genres throughout the film, which is another clue to the tapestry of Lynch's tale.

I lucked out when I started watching ""Mulholland Drive"" because the beginning, in which Rita (Laura Elena Harring) barely survives being murdered because of a car accident, strongly reminded me of the beginning of the cult classic horror film ""Carnival of Souls"" (the original and not the ghastly remake).  The connection was a shot in the dark, but it had me thinking that everything was not what it seems right from the start in this film.  However, when the second main character in the drama, Betty (Naomi Watts), gets off the plane in Hollywood ready to pursue her quest to become a star, it never dawned on me that there was more to the kindly old couple that wishes her well and drive off in a limosine.  Betty moves into an apartment, only to discover Rita, who has apparently suffered amnesia after her near death experiences, taking a shower.  Betty is from Canada, so she opts for helping Rita rather than calling the police.  The two become friends and more than friends in a couple of the best sex scenes seen in a movie in the last decade (they also serve to underscore how unsexy most sex scenes are in movies today).

There are other characters and plots in this film where the bits and pieces do not always fit nicely together.  The film that many viewers will think of when they watch ""Mulholland Drive"" would be ""Pulp Fiction,"" first because there is a scene where two characters have a strange and intense conversation in a family restaurant but also because there are all these plots lines and intersects in various ways.  For example, there is a movie director (Justin Therous) who is told he will be killed if does not cast a particular actress in his movie and a dwarf in a wheelchair (Michael J. Anderson from Lynch's ""Twin Peaks) who issues orders on his cell phone.  But the key narrative thread is Betty trying to become a star and find love in Hollywood.  However, it soon becomes clear that we are seeing that played out in multiple ways.

""Mulholland Drive"" is a movie about Hollywood, or more appropriately the dream of Hollywood.  It means something that Rita, who does remember her real name, pulls the one she uses from a movie poster for ""Gilda.""  Betty is the plucky young kids from the sticks who wants to be a star.  The unwritten rule about such people is that they would do anything to achieve their dream and in a sense Lynch's film just flips the dream over and looks at the nightmare side of the equation.  However, I have no problem with the idea that for many of those who watch this film that ""Muholland Drive"" will not come close to making sense to them until the second time they see it and that many of those people are not going to make the effort.  For those of us who have seen Lynch's other films, most notably ""Eraserhead"" and ""Blue Velvet,"" we knew going in that was probably going to be necessary.  I mean, come on.  This is David Lynch people.  What did you expect?",1079568000,4,3656,4.546564885496183
1485466,5,B00005JKJA,"DO NOT read this review if you want to figure out the puzzle of Mulholland Drive on your own.  You have been warned.
For those who are tired of being puzzled by it, here is the explanation.
One of the first shots of the movie -- right after the jitterbug credits -- is of a head falling to a pillow.  Everything that follows after that -- until the cowboy says ""It's time to wake up"" is  Diane's dream.
Here is what is real:  Diane Selwyn(Naomi Watts)is a struggling actress.  She became friends with Camilla Rhodes, a much more successful actress.  The two became loves, then Camilla broke it off.  Camilla gets together with Adam, her director, and at a dinner party the two announce their engagement (or perhaps they announce their pregnancy.  It's ambiguous but doesn't really matter.)  Diane is falling apart after breaking up with Camilla, and the announcement pushes her over the edge.  She hires a hit man to take out Camilla.  And then she falls asleep.  And the dream begins.
Everything in the dream is some element of Diane's life rearranged so that she is the desirable one, the one in power and control.  Betty -- Diane's dream-ego -- is innocent but clever, resourceful, and talented. The cowboy represents Diane's subsconscious; he is ultimately in control of everything.  At one point he says, ""a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be.""  Definitely true of a dream sequence: one's attitude determines the reality of the dream.  Diane's relationship with Camilla is rewritten so that Camilla is needy and Diane can help her.  Diane's hatred of Adam is represented by her dreams' desire to strip him of power: the cowboy forces him to cast the lead role his way, while at the same time, he is oddly attracted to Betty.  The director who once told Diane she wasn't any good instead tells Betty she is amazing -- but at the same time, Betty turns him down, going instead with the casting director who will take her bigger, better places.
The strange blue box is a subconscious representation of Diane's guilt over killing Camilla.  Remember that the hit man used a blue key as the sign that the hit had taken place.
Teatro Silencio is both a signal from the director to the viewer and from Diane's subconscious to her conscious mind: what appears real is actually fake.
The scary man behind Winkie's is the truthteller, and everyone is afraid of him.  He holds the blue box that is Diane's guilt, and from it runs her innocence -- symbolized by the nice people Betty meets on the plane to LA.  Her former life.

Diane wakes up when her subconscious (the Cowboy) tells her to.  Her neighbor comes over to collect the last of her stuff.  She sees the blue key on the table which means the hit has taken place.  But she is cracking; she also thinks she sees Camilla.  As she continues to crack, she is terrorized by the spectors of her lost innocence (the old people) until she kills herself.
See?  It all makes sense.",1078876800,56,2951,4.603448275862069

1485468,4,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch has a lot longer rope than most directors in Hollywood. He can get away with incomprehensible storylines, monosyllabic acting, and disquieting scenes, because he is one of Hollywood's master shotmakers. The guy can create tension with a camera and a vacant lot. His senses of style and pacing can be uncanny, if not a little bit maddening. His movies require you to pay attention, but don't always reward you for doing so. Mulholland Drive is his most interesting, and most successful film endeavor so far.
I spent most of the movie thinking ""I don't understand any of this,"" but I kept watching. I was compelled to do so. For most of the film, the dialogue is vague and campy, the acting cheesy and over-the-top, and yet I knew there was a purpose to it. I knew David Lynch was up to something. Some people have called this a dream sequence, some have called it Hollywood viewed through a kaleidoscope. I'm not sure it's either one. It also seemed a bit like spirits of the dead returning to roam the earth. All of these interpretations are plausible.
The plot involves Betty (Naomi Watts), a spunky and nave young woman with dreams of stardom who arrives in Hollywood. She hooks up with Rita (Laura Harring), a beautiful amnesiac who has survived a nasty traffic pileup. The two fall in love while they search, Nancy Drew style, for clues to Rita's past. Paralleling this is a storyline of Adam (Justin Theroux), a film director having a very bad day, who is ""directed"" by some hired goons and higher-ups to recast the lead role in his upcoming film.
That's the first half of Mulholland Drive. I did my best to simplify it. It gets stranger and stranger from there, with some of Lynch's trademark images along the way: lush red drapes, lush stages, and ersatz troubadours giving incomprehensible performances.
I have suspicions what it all means, but I can't be quite sure. What I do know is that this film is tense, tight, beautifully filmed, and wickedly funny. Lynch has little love for Hollywood, and it shows in his digs at the film biz. Watts gives a solid, wide-ranging performance (how many actresses can do a good job of bad acting?), and Harring has that classic pinup look, which fits perfectly with Lynch's nostalgic 1950s props and sets.
All in all, an enjoyable experience at the movies. Odd, but enjoyable. And I'll certainly watch it again, even though, I suspect, it still won't make much sense.",1078531200,2,2426,4.724056603773585
1485469,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Dr. is so far beyond any other film I've ever seen and while I don't believe in perfection in cinema, this comes very close.  It can be confusing and some might find it somewhat abstract, but believe me, there is a very linear story.  Even being a Lynch fan (I'll swallow my pride), I myself didn't understand the film very well after my first viewing.  But after figuring it out, you come to realize that this film is a very profoundly beautiful piece.  And very articulate.  Every color, every item, everything has so much meaning to the overlay of the plot.  This is Lynch at his best, so much detail was put in the picture, like every brush had some purpose.  I cannot stress how amazed I am at all the tie-ins and hints that can be told by every little detail.

This isn't one of those films that leaves you hanging either, there is a definate tale that cannot be argued or disputed.  Lynch challenges you to find this message, but that's how he works.  That being said, Mulholland Dr. isn't for everyone.  Whether this is the film for you or not, I'd still recommend at least one viewing, especially since Naomi Watts is so great in it.  I haven't felt so in awe of an actor/actress' performance since I saw Bibi Anderson in Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona.""  Ms. Watts' performance defines good acting.

Mulholland Dr. is basically a simple story of love and revenge.  And while the film is definately not told in a conventional manner, the message is very much so.  The dvd comes with really no extras and no chapter selection, but purposely intented to be packaged like that.  Call it pretentious, but the film is intended to be viewed in whole and Lynch is very closed to explanation as it prevents an open perspective.  If the film does linger an interest for a viewing, my only advise is to be patient and don't get frustrated after one viewing, the film is complicated, but is also very gratifying.

If you aren't really into films that demand complete attention during the viewing and analytical thought after the viewing, then this obviously isn't your cup of tea.  If it happens to be your flavor though, I'd recommend watching Robert Altman's ""3 Woman,"" Francois Ozon's ""Swimming Pool,"" and of course Bergman's ""Persona"" in addition to ""Mulholland Dr.""",1078272000,3,2274,4.665829145728643
1485470,3,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch has crafted a very clever thriller that's so unusually sequenced that you are thoroughly confused at the end of watching the film.  The DVD has minimal bonus material and no commentary.  It does provide some clues in the DVD liner to help you figure out what the meaning of everything in the movie is and the sequence of what actually happened.  This is a truly challenging thriller that has a lot of darkness and foreboding.  There are some lesbian sex scenes and a very impressive performance by Naomi Watts (not just in the erotic scenes), with some interesting appearances by some veteran performers and even the musical composer who has collaborated with Lynch for many years.  One key to the film has to do with the club silencio scene, which brings the dream/fantasy of the preceding portion of the movie to a close.  This is a movie that is frustrating until you figure out the story.  It would have been better if the DVD had contained a director explanation of the story.",1078012800,,993,4.672413793103448

However, any story should make a reasonable effort to move from scene A to scene B and still make some sense.  One can actually watch this entire movie and not come up with a single answer as to why things happen.  Why the lesbian scenes?  There was no point to it.  And was the acting bad on purpose?  Almost nothing was believable.
Consider the first scene -- where the girl is found in the bathroom, almost taking a shower, but not really.  What was the point of that?  And wouldn't the woman take the effort to call the police or at least listen to her aunt who says that she should get rid of this stranger in the room?  For some reason I think this movie was written at a coffee shop and the script writer must have thought this is the most creative artpiece that has been known to man, not knowing that almost no one will understand the flick.  I am all for making a movie rather creative and using nifty tricks to elevate your ideas, but this movie falls far short of that goal.
Perhaps this movie ought to be marketed as a film version of abstract art -- it is up to the audience, not the screen writer, to state what the film means.  It is relativism to the extreme.",1077494400,2,1291,4.2073170731707314
1485552,1,B00005JKJA,"So, according to a horde of reviewers, Lynch has ""cleverly"" created a film where the plot, characters, and setting are completely re-jumbled every fifteen minutes for no purpose at all. In all its intriguing glory, it's supposed to make you think and piece together the underlying jigsaw. Baloney.
The first two-thirds of Lynch's film is borderline normal and seems to make some sense -- it even puts you in an anticipatory mode as you wish you understand what happened. But the final third of the film seems to provide contradictory evidence which throws earlier perceptions into question. In a rather bizarre fashion.
Apparently, the reason for this break in the film is that the first part of the film was intended to be part of a television series that did not sell. Lynch then filmed the additional footage which formed part of the conclusion, and spliced it all together as a complete film. This explains why the lesbian and masturbation sex scenes are near the end of the film, that wouldn't have been allowed on network television.
From the perspective of a viewer (such as myself) who doesn't know this background, it doesn't really matter that the film started out as a television series pilot and ended up as a movie. It is not a cobbled-together mess as it seems to be, so claim other reviewers, but a masterpiece, and it makes perfect sense to them. The implication is that if it doesn't make sense to you, then you must be an idiot. These sorts of arguments are pretty common in film criticisms.
The scattershot narrative offers evidence supporting several possible interpretations for the plot, including nightmares, delusions, drug-induced hallucinations, near-death hallucinations (as in ""Jacob's Ladder""), some sort of shared delusion, a film within a film, or a play within a film, among others. Since this all takes place in Hollywood, it makes the story even more surrealistic. It is very telling that the most realistic scene in the entire film is a film audition featuring two actors in front of a small audience of movie executives in a conference room.
Some viewers may find all these goings-on intriguing. I found the film to stutter under the weight of its utterly non-believable dialogue, an  exasperated lack of pace (please, don't tell me it was on purpose), gratuitious and rather long softcore Lesbian sex scenes which amount to very little at the end really, awful high-school drama type acting, laughable characters, and a never-ending cavalcade of confusion, confusion, confusion (get sober, Lynch!).
What lends this emotionless deluge of unrelated scenes some level of bearability is the stunning Naomi Watts, and an occasional dose of good music. Which is not really saying all that much.",1076716800,21,2725,5.015452538631346

Yes, you won't be able to pinpoint each and every single event even through multiple,detailed viewings, and don't listen to the pseudo-intellectual reviewers who believe they can give you a spot on analysis of ever single thing that happened. Mulholland Drive works more like music for the eyes. You may not hear it, or ""get it"", but you'll feel it. Eventually.
Naomi Watts is wonderful in all her dynamic glory. The gorgeous Laura Elena Harring gives a pitch perfect performance as the sullen femme fatale ""Rita"".
I won't give anything away, all I'll say is that, if you don't mind something way out there, and you're a real film buff, throw in this mind bender and be delighted. I'm not one of those David Lynch fanatics(I hated Blue Velvet).But after seeing this film, I think of him as genius. It's not a movie I can guarantee everyone will love;but if you get lucky and fall in love with it, you will see Mulholland Drive the way I see it. A mindbending,seductive,multi-faceted film that comes off as dark,witty,sensual,heartfelt,and,ultimately moving,",1076630400,,1330,4.995495495495495
1485554,1,B00005JKJA,"I was like a lot of people, I thought David Lynch was a great director based on the Twin Peaks TV show.  But after watching a few of his feature films, I realized something: David Lynch is crazy and his movies rarely make any sense that all.
Take Mulholland Drive for example, this is really a movie about what?  Is it a murder mystery?  Isn't a romantic drama?  Is it some surrealistic drug trip put on film?  It's hard to tell.  But I do know that it is two hours of boredom with some girl on girl action scenes and some violence thrown in for good measure.  This film does make more sense than Lost Highway, but that is like saying one nut in the nut house is not as crazy as the another nut in the same nut house.
I think David Lynch's films are like the Emperor's new clothing.  As long as everybody says that he's a great director, then he is a great director.  I disagree; his films are mess.  Mulholland Drive is probably the least messy of his films but that is really not saying very much.

1485555,1,B00005JKJA,"My rating for the DVD of ""Mulholland Drive,"" is no reflection of how I feel about the film itself, for it is certainly one of the best works in the Lynchian canon. I gave this DVD a poor rating, because a rather disturbing, not so subtle alteration has been made for the DVD transfer. I was shocked to discover when I watched the copy that I purchased at Best Buy that a scene had been digitally censored, and what appeared on my screen was markedly different from what I saw in the cinema. When the character we come to know as Rita disrobes before climbing into bed with Betty, a distracting flesh-colored scramble of pixels has been substituted for an area where one would normally expect to see pubic hair. Since this scrambling was not evident in the version of ""Mulholland Drive"" that I saw in theatres (twice), I can only expect that this is another example of squeamish puritanical tampering for an American audience that can consume any amount of violence, but should be protected from the fright of a sexual organ (see ""Eyes Wide Shut""). I was informed that a copy of this DVD purchased at JandR in Manhattan was similarly ""blurred"" for the protection of the viewer. I know we live in the era of wardrobe malfunction hysteria, but the marring of a magnificent film like this for its DVD release is unacceptable.",1076371200,10,1321,4.601694915254237

The verbiage on the box is misleading.  When I rented this movie from the video store, I thought I knew what it was about.  I did not know it would be so artsy that I would need to get a translater.  I was not prepared to watch a movie that involved so much symbolism that hours of online hunting and pecking gave me only the smallest clue as to what I had actually seen.
I picked this movie off the shelf because, from the words on the box, I thought it was the sort of murder mystery I could sit back, pop some popcorn, and fall right into.  This is not that kind of movie.  So, reader beware, if you are looking for a film that you can easily watch -- one that does not take your full concentration and then extensive research thereafter -- this is not the movie for you.",1076025600,3,1041,4.103448275862069
1485557,1,B00005JKJA,"After watching Mulhulland Drive, I feel like I just completely wasted over two hours of my life.  There is absolutely no plot, characters are introduced, never to be heard from again, while others change identities at the end of the movie.  I felt like I was watching ""Bewitched"" when they switched Darren's and didn't tell anyone.
I know everyone says it's an extremely intelligent movie, one you have to think about.  If you're looking for an intelligent movie, watch ""Momento"".  That movie had an extremely complicated storyline that jumped back and forth at a moments notice, but it at least made sense once the credits rolled.
I will admit that ""Mullholland Drive"" is a beautifully shot movie, and well acted.  Naomi Watts gives us a glimpse of her talent that will bless us for years to come.  Unfortunately, the cinematographer & actors where given a horrendous script.  I can see how this would work as a TV series, it's intended destination.  It is very ""Twin Peaks"", with possibilities in every direction.  Just don't try to take what was supposed to be an introduction to a 13 episode series & make a 2 hour movie out of it.  One of the worst movies I've ever seen.",1075420800,12,1176,4.692682926829268
1485558,5,B00005JKJA,"I must admit that I didn't really understand this movie the first time I saw it. I am sure I still miss some nuances after many viewings. It was still quite enjoyable on a visual level that first time with very vivid colors and great cinematography. However, once you understand the basic storyline, those previously difficult details start falling into place, and you start feeling like a much smarter person for getting it. At least I did.
Okay, if you're interested, here is the basic storyline. If you notice at the beginning of the movie, Naomi Watts falls asleep and you get a visual of a pillow blurring as she falls into it. From that point in the movie to the point at which the cowboy comes into her room to wake her up, it is a dream. Here's the reality. Naomi Watts is Diane Selwyn, a former dance champion who wanted to make it big as an actress. Her aunt had left her some money when she died, so Diane headed to Hollywood. But she didn't do very well. For example, she wanted to win the lead in a movie called The Sylvia North Story, but the director didn't think much of her audition. Another woman, Camilla Rhodes (Laura Elena Harring) got the part instead. This is how they met, Diane and Camilla. And as Camilla progressed as an actress and Diane ended up doing bit parts in Camilla's movies, they had a sexual relationship. The relationship didn't mean to Camilla, though, what it meant to Diane. Camilla eventually dumped her for the director of one of her movies, Adam (Justin Theroux), announcing it at the party shown near the end of the movie. Diane couldn't deal with it, and she hired a hitman to kill Camilla. When she realized Camilla was dead (the hitman left the blue key for her), she couldn't live with what she had done and what she had become. She was depressed and hallucinating and shot herself in her bedroom.
Now here's the dream. Diane's dream is everything she wanted to happen in reality. She creates it from reality, adding characters that passed marginally through her life (such as the cowboy at the party who becomes a figure to menace the director) and reworking events that actually happened (such as the limousine ride, no longer her way to the party but the way in which Camilla comes to depend on her). In her dream, she is not Diane but Betty, the name of a waitress who served her once. Camilla has amnesia brought on by a car crash, after which she finds her way to Betty's amazing apartment. Camilla calls herself Rita after seeing a Rita Hayworth poster in Betty's apartment. In the dream, Betty and Rita are together. The director is cuckolded in a hilarious scene and harrassed by the aforementioned cowboy. Betty is an incredibly good actress. The hitman is a bumbling idiot. All is well with the world. That is, all is well until reality starts creeping in. The director seems to recognize Betty, though in her dream world, he doesn't know her. Betty and Rita discover the dead body of Diane Selwyn, a name which seems unsettlingly familiar. A couple of men in a diner discuss an evil presence which lives behind the place, actually a homeless man who possesses a blue box. (I think that the evil presence/homeless guy is the manifestation of Diane's inner turmoil at what she has done in reality. She has locked it up in this sort of Pandora's box.) At a performance at Club Silencio at which the emcee announces that everything is an illusion, Betty freaks out, because in reality, all of this is an illusion. She finds a key in her purse which is blue like the one the hitman had in reality. When Rita opens the Pandora's box with the key, Betty is gone, the illusion is gone, and the cowboy appears to wake Diane up.
A couple of comments about this DVD--the American version is really not that hot. You get the movie which runs straight through without chapters (i.e. you can't stop the DVD and skip back to whatever part you were on). The only special features are some production notes and the trailer. I got a region 0 Korean version online which has more features and most importantly has chapter stops. Because I needed those to review those parts which just didn't want to jell in my mind.",1075248000,27,4159,4.546666666666667

If you have those things in check,and don't mind movies that are both challenging and wacky, see this. First of all, I'll just say that Mulholland Dr. is absolutely beautiful,beautifully filmed,presented,has some beautiful musical moments and for those sensory images alone is worth a viewing. I don't want to give away a whole lot, because I'd like for you to see for yourself. Mulholland drive is honestly one of the best films I've ever seen. Because while I don't get what the director is trying to portray through each and every single detail, I get what he is trying to show. He,thorough a series of loose ends(scenes)portrays two worlds. One is filled with hope and beauty and light, while the other is dark,and cold,and contemptuous. And that is why I love this movie so much, because it plays out exactly like what it is trying to portray-on the surface Mulholland Drive seems like a highly,stylistic glossy product, but underneath the gloss, there lies warmth,emotion,and drowned hope.

1485560,2,B00005JKJA,"Rating this movie was tough.  2 stars doesn't do justice to David Lynch's masterful use of the camera to capture the color, tone & brooding atmosphere of a Los Angeles that is at once shiny & sinister.  In exposing the supernatural in the midst of the ordinary, a Lynch film is similar to a Stephen King book--the audience approaches both holding its breath, waiting for a Bogeyman to jump out and spook us--we know that what we see at first on the sunny surface will not be all we get.  In this film we do get an actual Bogeyman that resides behind a diner Dumpster no less.  And therein lies the problem
If this film is evaluated on its mastery of film techniques, it's worth 4 stars.  If it's evaluated on the basis of coherent narrative and plot of any kind, Lynch flunks.  Maybe it's a uniquely American weakness to demand that our films make sense, have something called 'a storyline', and if that's a weakness, it's one I don't apologize for.  The film starts promisingly--a beautiful young woman being threatened at gunpoint (and we know from her sultry looks that she's not a Good Girl) is saved from certain death when her captors are killed in a car crash.  Stunned & suffering from a head injury, she wanders away from the wreckage, spends the night behind some bushes, and sneaks into a stranger's apartment.  She's obviously hiding out, but from what?  Enter Betty, a fresh-faced blonde ingenue just off the plane from Ontario, ready for her big break in Hollywood.  She's staying in her aunt's empty apartment, the same apartment as fate would have it, that our mysterious accident victim has wandered into.  Betty is startled to find an unexpected visitor in her aunt's shower, a visitor that has amnesia and a handbag stuffed full of 100 dollar bills.  The two women forge a shaky friendship based on a mutual desire to determine the dark beauty's identity.  That's an intriguing beginning, but any semblance at a coherent narrative goes off the rails at this point as Lynch seemingly pulls out every trick and device he learned at directing school, some of which serve his movie and some of which only serve to leave his audience completely bewildered.  The more lost I felt, the madder I got, because suspension of disbelief only works if the movie reality follows its own logic structure.  There is neither logic nor structure here.  After 2 hours and 27 minutes of Lynch's cinematic wanking, I had the distinct impression that he's laughing at his audience for being chumps enough to sit through this pyschic spew dressed up in the clothes of 'High Art'.",1074643200,4,2575,4.712053571428571
1485611,5,B00005JKJA,"BLUE VELVET was extraordinary, an exploration of the dark sides of both sex and the small town that none of us were prepared for.  TWIN PEAKS was a dazzlingly fun pit stop, a total dead-end that I would gladly travel again and again, if only
for the corny jokes amidst the psychotic terror.  But
MULHOLLAND DR is surely David Lynch's masterpiece.  Of all the movies that bite the hand that feeds them, Hollywood, MULHOLLAND DR is the only one that deserves a place
alongside SUNSET BLVD.  But where SUNSET BLVD is brittle and cynical, MULHOLLAND DR is overwhelmingly warm, filled with deep, rich colors, remarkably pure expressions of
love and fear and sadness, and a love scene so hot and unexpected it scalds you.  This warmth and beauty make the film's (literal) decomposition (set off by a stunning scene set in a crumbling theatre) all the more shocking and powerful.  Of course, Naomi Watts's shattering performance helps, too.  Her work in the first part of the film, playing a naive Hollywood hopeful, splinters and cracks brilliantly in the film's second part.  But, at its core, MULHOLLAND DR is a particularly American tragedy.  For behind the glitter is betrayal, behind the mic is a lip-syncher, and the smell of a rotting town clouds any hope of becoming a starlet.",1073174400,,1279,4.830275229357798
1485612,4,B00005JKJA,"A film by David Lynch
The first thing to mention is that this was a confusing movie.  I knew that I was watching a quality film, but as the movie went on, I was less and less sure about exactly what it was that I was seeing.  After it was over, I had no idea what just happened, but I enjoyed the time spent (2 and a half hours).
A woman is in a car wreck.  She appears to be the only survivor and she stumbles away from the scene of the accident until she makes her way outside an apartment complex (a fairly nice one, at that).  She falls asleep behind some bushes, and when daylight comes, she sneaks in to one of the apartment and stays there.  A woman named Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives at that same apartment to take residence there.  Betty discovers the woman, who calls herself Rita (Laura Harring), but Rita has amnesia and does not even remember her own name.  Betty befriends Rita, and tries to help Rita figure out what happened to her.  This part is fairly straight forward, but as the film progresses there are little things thrown in that do not make much sense even though we think that it may be important.  I do not want to reveal what these are for fear of spoiling some of the enjoyment of trying to unravel this movie.  Even with the semi-confusing stuff, the movie mostly makes sense until close to the end where there is a twist (not your typical plot twist, but rather one that changes how you look at the whole movie) and this confused me more than anything else in the movie.  I understood what happened, but I didn't get it.  Someone explained the movie to me later, and I'm still not quite sure it makes sense.
This is a strange movie, but good.  The acting was good with Naomi Watts and Laura Harring impressing.  I can't really comment on the Lynch's directing because that depends on how much the movie really made sense and connected together.  I enjoyed it, but this is the kind of film that takes multiple viewings to truly make sense of it.",1073001600,,1974,4.326086956521739
1485613,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch's Mullholland Dr. is a movie that demands something new from its audience, but it is does not mean you have to be a brain surgeon to figure this movie out.  This movie is obviously split into two parts.  In the first half, Naomi Watts' character is an aspiring actress and her life seems to play out like a dream.  Everything seems sublimely perfect -- in one scene it is almost histerically perfect.  When she steps off of the airplane in Los Angeles for the first time with the elderly couple, the scene reminds you of the type of over-the-top happy scene you would find in a movie from the 1950s.  It is done intentionally.  Later Watts' character finds herself slowly becoming a star in Hollywood -- her luck is almost too perfect.  But, it's not perfect.  Under this facade there are monsters lurking -- as is illustrated visually by the man scared of the monster behind the diner.  When Laura Harring's character is first introduced, she is in need of help and Watts gets to be the hero.  But as the second half of the movie emerges you realize that Watts is the one who needs help.  She watches as Harring becomes a star and everything about Hollywood now follows the path of the negative things we here about the town.  People become prostitutes and waitresses and ruin their lives.  What Lynch doesn't say is which one is real and which one isn't -- I guess neither is really true or false.  It depends on your perspective, but since it's all really a dream anyway then parts of both are true.  Lynch's movie is like poetry -- what you see is really a metaphor for something else.  The crux in understanding Mullholland Drive lies in watching it without expecting a linear plot line like you would in your normal Hollywood fare.  It is a poetry on film -- brilliant.",1072915200,2,1787,4.517133956386293
1485614,4,B00005JKJA,"I came to MULHOLLAND DRIVE with extreme reluctance.  Although I've seen most of Lynch's work, it has been more by accident than by design, and I had no expectation of great interest in the film.  For Lynch is an extremely divisive director: you either like his work or you do not, and by and large I fall into the latter category.  So I sympathize with those who loathe everything about the film--but at the same time I am surprised by how much I myself admired it.

Opening with an attempted murder thwarted by an unexpected car-crash, the film presents us with a beautiful woman (Laura Harring) who stumbles into Los Angeles in shock and suffering from amnesia.  Using the name ""Rita,"" she crosses paths with pert and pretty Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), new to the city and in search of a film career.  Betty quickly decides to shelter Rita, and the two women begin to search for Rita's true identity.

A number of subplots, seemingly random incidents, and bizarre events complicate the basic premise; even so, I think most viewers will be able to buy into the film and find themselves extremely curious about the film's approaching conclusion.  But therein lies the rub, for it is exactly at this point that the film suddenly deconstructs and forces you to completely reevaluate everything you've previously seen.
A number of recent films, including the extremely popular SIXTH SENSE and THE OTHERS, have used a similar device, a sudden twist that spins your basic perception of the overall story.  In both cases, however, these were logical extensions of the basic plot; the device in MULHOLLAND DRIVE, however, is not, and it does not so much spin perception as it completely overturns and then completely reinterprets the entire film up to that point.  And there are only two possible reactions: jaw-dropping astonishment or a savage disgust with the whole thing.

There have been endless interpretations and analyses of this film, and many people complain that they don't understand it.  I may be running against the tide here, but I have to say that you shouldn't try to ""understand"" MULHOLLAND DRIVE; instead, accept it as a journey into an extremely disturbed mind as it plays games with itself.  For with this film, Lynch essentially takes us inside madness itself, an insanity that dreams Hollywood dreams grown into monsters of the subconscious.

Yes, I do think there is much to admire here in spite of several very obvious flaws--not the least of which is a distinct difference in tone as the film shifts between portions originally planned for television and portions filmed when Lynch realized he could salvage the project as a feature film.  But at the same time, admiring is not necessarily liking: MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a very dark place, and for myself one visit was enough.

1485617,3,B00005JKJA,"There was once a time when I thought David Lynch was a great director, the result of viewing his masterpiece, Blue Velvet and the early episodes of Twin Peaks.  Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the later episodes of that TV series, Lynch had gradually changed from weird and good to just weird for the sake of weird.  Making something comprehensible seemed to take a back seat to dancing midgets, and my appreciation for his work diminished.  Mulholland Drive shows flashes of his Blue Velvet brilliance, but is generally as disappointingly strange as many of his more recent films.
The story opens with a beautiful woman riding in a limousine along the street in the title.  Just as the driver and his partner are about to kill her, she is involved in a car crash that leaves her with amnesia and everyone else dead.  She wanders into the life of another woman who is an aspiring actress and the two of them investigate who she is.  Meanwhile, a movie director is forced by mysterious people to cast a specific woman in his movie for reasons that are never clear.  In fact, there is a lot that isn't clear and seem almost thrown in to intentionally make the movie more muddled.  Maybe on some level, it all makes sense, but I prefer a movie that doesn't require multiple viewings and a user's guide to attain any level of comprehensibility.
The movie is not all bad...far from it.  In many places, it looks pretty good and if you look at it without worrying about the big picture, you might enjoy it.  But most viewers will demand more out of a movie than what this delivers.  I cannot give this movie a whole-hearted recommendation, but I can say that if you go into it not expecting to understand it, there is a bit of fun to be found.",1072137600,2,1739,4.523961661341853

1485680,5,B00005JKJA,"""Mulholland Drive"" is a remarkable movie in roughly every way possible.  I was impressed when I first saw the movie, but after a couple more viewing, I truly began to appreciate what Lynch has created.  I love David Lynch for both his good and his bad films, mostly because he won't compromise.  I have yet to see him make a mainstream movie in a bid for cash.  ""Mulholland Drive"" is another one of his many bizarre and semi-coherent movies, and this time, it's a really, really good one.
The plot centers on the relationship between two women, Rita, who has amnesia after an attempt on her life, and Betty, who came to Hollywood bright eyed and bushy tailed to be a star.  The pair spend a good chunk of the movie playing detective and sneaking around Nancy Drew style in order to try to uncover Rita's identity.  About 3/4 through the movie, that entire approach is scrapped, and the rest of the movie is a lot of seemingly random scenes and actions.  I'll deal with the plot later on in greater detail.
The acting is fabulous, especially Naomi Watts, going from bubbly pert blonde starlett to emotionally unstable and possessive green-eyed monster (in the Shakespearean sense, not literally).  The rest of the cast holds up their ends of the bargain with skill as well, with not a poor performance in the cast.
The music and sound are phenomenal.  Lynch is a director who truly understands the subtle nuances of sound in a movie, and he uses that understanding to weild a mastery over this movie's soundtrack that is crucial to the movie itself.  The standout in the sound category (coupled with visuals) is the amazing scene in the ""Silencio,"" a bizarre theater that the women visit.  The scene marks the point where the movie truly stops making sense in the traditional fashion, but it also marks the point where Lynch expertly and poetically works our emotions.  The climax of the Silencio scene (I won't give any details, because it's so amazing) never fails to move me in a way that I have rarely experienced before.  I am filled with an overpowering sense of hopelessness and impotence every time the singer . . . well, you know.  This is due in no small part to the absolutely gorgeous rendition of ""Crying"" that the audience is treated to in this scene.  Couples with the surreal visuals, this scene alone is worth the ticket price.
Now on to the direction.  In case you haven't noticed by now, I love what Lynch does with this film.  He effectively combines scenes of comedy, horror, surrealism, drama, sex, and poetry into a single knockout punch of a product.  He knows subtlety, and is more subtle in this particular film than most people realize.
I'll now go back to the plot.  There are two ways to view this film.  The first is as the cinematic manifestation of a bizarre and incomprehensible nightmare that affects you in many ways, but you can't figure out why.  It could very well be ""that really weird dream you had last night"" in cinematic form.  You could also try to find the puzzle and solution in the movie, and there are possibilities.  If you don't want to spoil the movie, skip to the conclusion now.  If you think of the first 3/4 of the movie as Diane's fantasy and dream of her relationship with Camilla, it starts to take shape.  This is not to say that the first 3/4 are a dream, that's far too simple.  Diane (who is the real character, along with Camilla, Betty and Rita are made up) is driven insane with jealousy and rage by the structure of Hollywood and her lost love with Camilla.  Notice how many objects and characters in the last 1/4 of the movie make appearances earlier in her fantasy.  Most of the characters are recognizable, but just passing through are ""Aunt Ruth,"" ""The Cowboy,"" and ""Camilla"".  Perhaps Diane created this fantasy to convince herself that she was a good person who did not just pay for the hit on her lover.  So what about the key and the box?  There is no rational explanation for the key and the box.  All we know is that the key was on the table indicating that Camilla was now dead (check the dialogue later with the hitman).  The most obvious (and most probable) interpretation is that it's Pandora's Box.  Notice that the movie makes it's final turn down the path of darkness when the box is opened.

I thought Club Silencio and the words of the master of ceremonies is a reminder to us all (and the characters) that our lives and the world and our beings are NOTHING. [In the beginning was the word, before that _silence_; the Word (as in the Bible) may be a dream or a shared illusion of sentient beings who don't know they aren't sentient and don't know they don't exist.] At best we are the dreams of a higher dimensional creature or a kid (God) in a 24 dimensional reality, playing on a ""computer"" virtual reality game. ""It's all recorded"" and the emphasis on AUDITIONS means our lives have been scripted and our particular lives have been assigned to us by a casting director. Lynch has excelled at emptieness, meaninglessness, dead bodies or body parts (much of Mulholland drive seems to have a faint sound in the background of insects consuming a dead body), and the random cruelty of nature; but has offered the only cure for this as: _a Kierkegaardian leap of faith_: The characters in Blue Velvet believe in the bluebirds in a world where they see more insects than birds; Twin Peak's Dale Cooper believe in the enthusiasm of being a human being who loves ""a great cup of coffee"" and a slice of pie ""that's worth a stop."" He stands tall and smiles and Likes people in a world partly filled with corpses and human suffering and madness; Wild at Heart has 1) a Good Witch from Wizard of Oz and 2) the singing of Elvis songs which elevates the characters (who aren't too bright) to a ""nifty"" level of experience that is high above the blood on the marble floor where the head was bashed. Lynch is best at showing us the reality of meaninglessness, insects devouring our dead bodies in the future, the non-understandableness of life, existential angst, angst from physical and mental wounds, agony without much ectasy. He is LESS able to make the Leap of faith real. He portrays existence so well. The Leap of faith aspect seems forced. Maybe he's TRYING to believe in faith and is trying to sell the idea to himself. Well, I may be up in my armpits in a quicksand of diseased manure and my nightmares may seem to be coming true, and my body may rot and be food for insects in the future, and I may lose my persona and/or ego again, but, trust me, we are in the Platonian shadow world of 2 or 3 dimensions. At death we will unfold into our 24 dimensional selves. I love you all.",1070841600,,2400,4.469248291571754

The directing by Lynch is beautiful, making this movie seem like a dream at times. The plot is very confusing so im not going to explain it, just go out and rent it for yourself. Needless to say this is my first Lynch film, and it was a great experience. I wish i would have discovered him sooner..

But I can't help myself. I love his work, even if it makes me want to slap him silly for creating ludicrous puzzles out of simple plots (which is an artform in and of itself he's mastered). To anyone else who still can't quite figure it out, the biggest clues to what this movie is REALLY about, I won't provide a spoiler here, just offer a few clues.
1. Pay attention to the camera closing in on the red pillow at the opening credits
2. Notice what happens immediatley after Rita opens the blue box
3. Notice the distinct differences in the charachters before the blue box is opened, and after (most notably, the director)

people have their interpetations of this unique film. WOW! Some 800  responses. I tried to 'solve' this myself. I now think Mr. Lynch didn't want to spell the story out. IT'S a fools game. People just look silly and trite trying to explain a dream. Look at a piece of art and there a million different responses. Everybody is both right and wrong in their answer. I believe there being no Lynch commentary track speaks volumes. A Mystery is only a mystery when we don't know what the mona lisa smile signifies. A stunning and hypnotic film gazing experience. This film has many wonderful and brillant small scenes. My only gripe is  this film should of had
story chapters. I loved REQUIEM OF A DREAM also. Try to watch this
film in the spirit of KUBRICK'S 2001. If you must read people's opinions remember a dream is silly cuz it's illogical. Kudos to  DAVID LYNCH for not spelling it out. This film was not greeted  by
the american film industry kindly. It's easy to see why. I love so many scenes in this film.

To survive with 4 and 8 star ratings, respectively, says a lot for the staying power of the film.  My rankings?  A 5 for Amazon and a 9 for IMDB.  What David Lynch has created is an engrossing 2 hour and 27 minute cinematic experience that I was sorry to see come to a close.  Any film that leaves as many indelible images in my mind as this one, will always get my support.  (The scene in the Club Silencio featuring a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' is inspired film-making.  The scene at 'The Corral' was just plain spooky, and the hit-man in Adam Kesher's house was hilarious.)  I'm not going to get into the arguments about ""what did this scene mean?"" or ""this one didn't go anywhere"", mainly because it's fruitless.  You either get it or you don't.  To be fair, this film made much more sense the second time around. That I wanted to watch it a second time says something about Lynch's ability to entertain even if you're lost somewhere in the story.  Yes, I know I used the terms 'entertain' and 'Lynch' in the same sentence, but it was intentional.  I wasn't dreaming.  Honest.

When I first saw this film I had no idea what was going on especially at the end of the film. Then when seeing it a second time I realized that the movie is about Diane having a dream that she is Betty and the girl she contracted to be murdered,Camilla, is named Rita and is an amnesiac. I would like to see a sequel to this movie because it is my feeling that since we never see Camilla's death that she escaped the contract that Diane paid for. The other thing that I would like to see is a version of this movie in which everything in is chronological order so that the movie doesnt have to be viewed several times to get it straight as to what happened before the dream and what happened after the dream. In any event not since the movie Rosemary's Baby has a film been made which incorporates fantasy and reality in such an ingenious way. I also felt sorry for Diane and why she wanted to kill her exlover Camilla was understandable as was her wish fufillment dream that takes up most of the movie. Of course there may be people who disagree with my interpretation of the movie or will disagree with making any modifications to the form of the movie.",1068768000,2,1395,4.189591078066915

1485689,4,B00005JKJA,"Betty is an annoyingly perky Hollywood hopeful. Rita is an amnesiac who crawls out of a limo involved in an accident - narrowly avoiding being murdered by its driver. The two meet when Rita sneaks into Betty's aunt's house and then fall in love.  With Betty and Rita turning into detectives in the Nancy-Drew mold, they uncover what may be clues to Rita's true identity. Betty balances her amateur detective work, new love life and her plans to star in a break-out role in the film, ""The Sylvia North Story"".  Meanwhile, a sinister cabal intimidates Adam Kesher, the film's luckless and spineless director into casting a starlet named Camilla for Betty's role. As Betty, who appears more blonde than Sandra Dee, feels her love for Rita deepen, she also gets closer to the truth about her amnesiac lover.  We learn a thing or two as well - in seemingly unconnected scenes showing the director's shadowy masters; a hitman who kills seemingly out of compulsion; a chillingly glib cowboy who may offer the director a way out; two guys shmoozing about nightmares in a restaurant; a monster hiding behind a parking lot; and a blue box....
And then, it begins to go awry, with the illusions giving way to an entirely different existence for our characters. The scenes seem more dream like and illogical, but Lynch gives us more clues. And most importantly, the characters seem to change identities completely. The exotic yet meek Rita is now the much-desired Camilla, a Hollywood superstar who can live without Betty (or Diane). The much-desired Betty becomes the blowsy Diane, a one-time Hollywood hopeful whose dream ended when she lost the lead in ""The Sylvia North Story"" to Camilla. Although still dream-like, the latter part of the film is so bleak and dispiriting that we're supposed to think it a dream more routed in reality than the one the movie began with - with Betty's hopes and dreams becoming Diane's unachievable desires. Now, Camilla is Diane's former lover - an affair that Diane is incapable of maintaining even in her imagination (even the dream Camilla dumps Diane).  To underscore Diane's shame, Lynch reunites her with Camilla at dinner party at Adam Kesher's house where he and Camilla are about to announce their engagement).  The newer Kesher is stronger and more resilient the Kesher of Betty's world - even though they both dumped Betty/Diane for ""The Sylvia North"" story.  Diane's home (and her life) is an empty husk - she lives alone and never seems to leave, except when she brings a wad of cash and Camilla's picture to that hitman. Day becomes night, shrouding her in shadow as she sits listlessly on her couch, unable to even dream of an idealized version of her hopes.  Between the dreams of hope that open this flick and the nightmares of memories that won't die in the latter half, the characters seem menaced by a blue box. (IMNSHO, the box symbolizes TV, a wasteland for those who couldn't match their dreams for movie stardom - the big plot and character shift occurs when Rita opens the box, and is sucked inside; Because Lynch makes MD an obvious elegy to a lost Hollywood, TV becomes an obvious avatar of its demise and its character's pain).
Though cryptic, ""Mulholland"" is not quite incomprehensible - it's more of a puzzle, and you and your friends can probably come up with dozens of your own spins on Lynch's loopy twists (and you should bring along a friend - loneliness becomes very palpable here).  ""Mulholland"" originally began as a TV mini-series, eventually morphing into a more ambitious project for TV.  It's unclear how much of the film's ""bicameral"" structure (the idea of splitting the plot into a dream and the ""real life"" that created it) originated before ""Mulholland"" made the leap to the big screen. Despite the film's consistently cryptic and creepy atmosphere, Lynch develops an emotional coherence that keeps you tied to the screen. Lynch brilliantly pulls this off at the dinner-party scene in which Kesher's family and friends hear of Diane's less-than-spectacular Hollywood adventures, and we learn of Diane's seemingly bottomless reservoir of pity (we see how unreachable Camilla has become to her, and this is also when we learn that it was Camilla who beat Diane to stardom). Lynch has managed to bring some of the pathos of ""The Straight Story"" to his trademark world of nightmares, cigarettes, mysterious strangers and all-nite-diners.",1068508800,,4405,4.917900403768506
1485730,5,B00005JKJA,"Great movie, it reminds me a little of an earlier Lynch film LOST HIGHWAY, which also dealt with the theme of people unable to remember, or perhaps deliberately blocking, something terrible they'd done or something that had been done to them.  But this one has a better story to it, I think.
The first 90 minutes is almost like a Nancy Drew mystery story, with the ultra-perky blonde, wanna-be actress (you can imagine her expostulating things like, ""Oh golly!"" and ""Gee whiz!"", though I don't recall if she actually goes quite that far) helping an amnesia victim recover her memory.  Then the story takes a major, psychologically disturbing turn into Dark Weirdness in the last hour or so.  Several very ""Twin Peaks"" scenes in the film, particularly with the surreal music show in front of the red curtains and also the dwarf wearing the cowboy outfit.
I was browsing through some of the earlier reviews, looking at some of the interpretations others have of the film.  My own involves a cyclic life/punishment theory, where the characters are repeatedly given the opportunity to make decisions and then punished when they make the wrong choice.  Remember, the cowboy guy says something to the director like, ""If you choose right, you will see me one more time.  If you choose wrong, you will see me two more times.""  And the part where the assassin tells the girl, ""If you give me the money, it's a done deal.  You sure you want this?""

The dream sequences, the idea of 'No hay banda', the lesbian activity...all pulled from the mess of hollywood cliches and thrown together into the weird psychological film, 'Mulholland Drive'.
If you have a night to sit down and work out the actual line of events, the storyline, and what the hell the blue box symbolises, this is a very good film indeed. For light entertainment, you'd do better sitting in a dark room, hitting yourself with the DVD box.
The pretention of the film distinctly put me off: I found the lack of meaning in some of the weird scenes irritating, difficult to follow and generally disappointing. Equally I found the representation of her ego (the two old parents), the huge culmination and some of the more simple ideas excellently portrayed and very enjoyable indeed.
A film that stray from the sublime to the ridiculous, that ends too late or prematurely, that is a mixture of genius and pretention; that is Mulholland Drive.

When the characters made a switch after they open the mystery box with the blue key, I wanted to skip back a chapter to catch it again-but wait...the DVD didn't have any scene options so I turned off the movie. I came back to it grudgingly and had to FFWD through the movie.
At the end of the movie, I sat wondering what the guy at the diner who had a paranoid fear of some homeless guy living in the alley had anything to do with the story's main plot.  What was that???

Genius
Mulholland Drive  is equal parts film-noir mystery, a camp Hollywood parody, a comedy, a drama, and most of all and central to everything else: a love story- Hollywood style.
Of course, director  David Lynch(known for his inclination towards a  Fun-House mirror warping  sense of reality) then takes all these equal parts, adds a heavy dash of surrealism and TB full of  DMT(thats acid to you innocents)  to serve up a masterpiece. Everyone talks about making a film that is also a work of art, but few are the real McCoy. Forget 'The Hours',  'A Beautiful Mind' or the dreaded 'Chicago'. Mulholland Drive is the genuine article, and probably one the most well crafted and truly artistic commercial film in years. Open up the notebook kids, Mr. Lynch has officially announced that school is in session.
""Have you ever had a dream that you were so sure was real?""-Neo
 Muholland Drive  is..lucid dreaming, or the kind of intense dreams you have when you have a fever- part hallucination, part dream, part fantasy. Sleepwalking in your sleep. Its not so much a film or a movie, but to sound cliche, it truly is an experience. Sensations, emotions, impressions, and reactions are as important( or maybe moreso) than the who what why and where of things. Making love is about more than the concrete mechanics. The abstract feelings and emotions must compliment the kinetics. The sum is greater than its parts.
There is not one wasted shot or misplaced direction in this film; everything falls into place masterfully. Mosaic, tapestry, loom, whatever cliche you can think to illustrate this point, it applies. I liken it to  Jackson Pollack and his paintings about which he used to say that there were never any 'accidents' in his painting ea random element had the freedom to become whatever the painting wanted it to be in the end; methodical madness. David Lynch shows the same seemingly open-ended , but deceptively crafted control. Of course, some elements are more(or less) concrete than others, but even vagueness has its place in a film like this. There is no obfuscation, no befuddlement for the sake of befuddlement(or more to the point, b/c the writer or director had no real resolution for a troublesome plot element). The  importance of symbolism and totems in a film like this cannot be understated.
""Speak to me in riddle, Speak to me in rhyme""
Some art or artists can speak to your on a cerebral level and still manage to inflame the imagination. Theories on the nature of physics and the origins of the universe can be awe inspiring- humbling. Unfathomable. The theory of relativity as poetry. A moon shuttle launch as an allegory to the story of Prometheus and Fire.

Other works of  art or artists beckon you with words and images that flout logical explanation, but speak to you on a more emotionally immediate level; a visceral jolt, an intuitive understanding. Plath with her declaration "" I rise with my red hair, and I eat men like air"". A Monet painting. Still photography. These elicit an emotive, primitive response- which compels you to search for meaning; to  analyze, deconstruct and as the 'Cowboy' says, to ""Think"".
David Lynch shows his genius with this film- he does both.

1485735,5,B00005JKJA,"1) In defense of the hard-to-follow'ers: When I first watched this I thought that the dark-haired actress was the main character and figured that the blonde was going to be a stereo-typical hollywood blonde to serve as a supporting character. Also, I didn't pay attention to the first scenes of the movie while the credits were running. So I missed what I now know(hopefully, can't be too sure of anything) was the introduction of the main character and her parents. Needless to say I was more than a bit confused toward the end of the movie when the numerous switcheroos of chronology and character identities kick in.
2) Not exactly feel-good-hit-of-the-summer fare:
The portrayal of the depths of her fantasy with bits of the horror of reality creeping in is really extraordinary. Her being a wonderful actress, staying in a lovely apartment in sunny LA with her love interest dependent on her, a beautiful singing pixie who is bold and loved. Inescapable truth, her fear and dread, taints the fantasy. She even sees her own fate, though not consciously recognized because it is a dream.
3) Silencio, Silencio...Death, Death: The scene at the theater with the Spanish version of Crying is really great. Helps turn the tone darker and sadder and bridges the story moreso from dream to reality.
4) As the third Lynch movie I have seen, Fire Walk With Me and Blue Velvet the other two, I would have to put this one as the highest in the mind-blowing category. Which is saying a lot, since the other two are way, way, way, way out there as well.

1485737,5,B00005JKJA,"I have a somewhat conflicting interpretation of the story - I wonder if I overlooked something that one of you could point out.
At the end of the film I had the impression that Camilla did survive the accident very badly burnt and that ""the face"" behind Winky's is hers (consider that she has the blue box). The plot has a real strand and a dreamlike strand. The former are the attempted murder, the accident, and the scenes at Winky's. The latter are ramblings of Camilla's mind as she is trying to make sense of the accident while her memory is partially coming back. She is confused about her identity and sees everything from Diane's perspective. The ""coming back"" is reflected in her gradual realization that the roles of Diane and Camilla in the ""dream"" are reversed. Camilla is initially the protege and Diane is in control, but we later find out that it was the other way around: Camilla, the star, used Diane, the commonplace debutante, and then dropped her. In her recollections, Camilla gets to the point where she wakes up in the night and begins to realize it's all wrong somehow. Then the movie tells who Diane really was and how she brought about the accident. The story ends with the opening scenes: Camilla has not recovered her identity, the hitman continues to look for her (he asks the Winky's waitress to keep her eyes open for anyone new in the neighborhood).

1485738,5,B00005JKJA,"It begins with a jitterbug, ends with a suicide, and seems to spike through everything both hopeful and hopeless about L.A.'s film industry in between.
David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. may very well be his single best achievement in noiresque narrative mixed with his trademark skips and jumps in logic. Brilliantly acted, shot, edited, mixed and scored, Mulholland Dr. may or may not make sense to what no doubt will be a bewildered viewer, but the images conveyed in the interim prove unforgettable.
Read about the plot in the ""Plot Outline"" link or in the external reviews by Roger Ebert, David Edelstein or Kenneth Turan. I want to present something else here: the notion that what you're seeing does, in fact, exhibit a logic and brilliantly plays on so many emotional levels that, taken as a whole, Mulholland Dr. can unsettle not just those who don't get it but, worse still, those who do.
So many reviewers use the term ""dream"" to describe this film, and Lynch himself cleverly quips the tagline ""A love story in the city of dreams."" I won't go into every detail in order to completely spoil someone else's first-time enjoyment of the film, but let me go far enough to ask that you consider that what's shown is a dream through most of the movie and that the rest is a mix of imagination, delusion, memory, guilt, and sheer disgust, all made to counter the illusions just shown to you.
Consider that much of what you're seeing isn't just coming from the mind of Lynch as filmmaker but from the dreamer as the one sometimes incorrectly interpreting L.A.'s lifestyle. Even Betty, the movie's heroine, refers to where she is as a ""dream place.""
Consider that the Club Silencio is where the dreamer reaches the closest point to realizing the truth without being told it, where the environment of the dream is revealed, where the song elucidates more than just a point about the dimensions of sight and sound when they're not real: it uncovers a true feeling underscoring the entire dream. The song is sung in Spanish, one more way to show that it's not completely real or understandable while, at the same time, it teems with a very real, underlying feeling that brought the dreamer to her dream and, later, to her unflinching, gruesome reality. It's as if the Spanish singer is speaking the emotion but in a way that keeps the dreamer from fully realizing it.
Consider that Betty and Rita, as the critics put it, are archetypes of the dream but that Laura Elena Harring's and Naomi Watts' characters in the end, after a jarring switch in identities, are also archetypes but, unfortunately, pale-faced reflections of what we know and what is true not just about Hollywood but about life in general. The movie isn't just about image or illusion. It embodies the always contradictory but yet congregational experiences of lust, greed, hatred, ambition, luck, vengeance, guilt, manipulation, storytelling, love, and silence. It shows us how one person's fortune can become another person's aching, how one person's jealousy can be another's nourishment. It also forces us to consider how you can be jealous of the one you love.
And, just as important, Mulholland Dr. should not merely be looked at as a puzzle whose pieces one can connect if one reads David Lynch's primer on the rear of the insert in the DVD package. Voluptuous images should be taken in and felt without deconstruction. The emotions being played out are very real whether or not the viewer truly understands the plot.

This movie is constantly taxing your mind (at least my mind anyway).  The first time I watched it I had no idea what the heck was going on, but I was fascinated and I immediately wanted to see it again so I could figure it out.  This is one of the greatest things about David Lynch's movies.  He never discusses in detail what his movies are about, so the viewer gets to interpret them in their own way.  I'll admit though that I actually read some message boards on IMDb to get some idea what the heck was going on.  Once I got the gist it completely opened up the movie to me again.  I've made everybody I know watch this movie, and after a discussion of its story I made them watch it again.  A second viewing (and third, fourth, and so on) is a must.  With all of that said, this movie is still enjoyable from a visual and audio standpoint, regardless of whether you're lost in plot or not (a credit to Lynch and his crew of usuals).

The lead performances in Mulholland Dr. are amazing (highlighted by Naomi Watts at her most magnetic) as are the smaller more eccentric characters (""The Cowboy"" for example) that are classic Lynch.  There are reasons why Naomi Watts is one of my favorite actresses and this movie is one of them.  If you've liked Naomi in anything you are depriving yourself if you haven't seen this movie.

As for the DVD, there is a serious lack of special features, but the picture and sound are phenomenal.  I recommend watching this movie on a big widescreen with the lights off and the volume way up (oh...and with no distractions, you'll want to pay attention).",1065830400,3,1815,4.490853658536586

If you knew Hollywood (as David Lynch must) and had a nightmare about it which almost killed you (as David Lynch appears to have), this movie would be the result. But it's not an indulgent, surreal free-for-all--it's a compelling story, with some self-deprecating humor, some directorial satire. I think I even see a scene where he takes a perfect little potshot at Tarantino (wait for the closeup with that one tiny drop of blood).
My sister told me she thought she had it all figured out, until the last half hour when everything went to Hades. I bought it on that recommendation, and so should you.",1065744000,,648,4.692982456140351
1485784,5,B00005JKJA,"To illustrate my admiration for this film, I want to share my initial interpretation. After the movie, I thought ""Oh, Diane is in Hell and this is her punishment for having her lover murdered (because who's to say that Hell isn't a state of mind)"". Think about it, what could be more tormenting than having everything (good looks, talent, a great house, a budding career, an adoring and beautiful lover, a doting aunt), and then have everything fall apart. At first, there are just little hints of impending doom (dog poop in the courtyard), which get steadily more ominous (a crazy neighbor who says Betty isn't who she claims to be). Even during the love scene between the two women, notice that Betty says she loves Rita twice, and Rita does not reciprocate. Then, the club Silencio, where the singer sings Crying, a reference to Betty's unrequited love. The monstrous man behind the restaurant is the Devil, and the two old people (initially benevolent, but like everything else becoming nasty and twisted towards the movie's end) are demons or furies who torment Betty/Diane to take her own ""life"" (although she's already dead). Remember they pop out of the blue box (a symbolic representation of Hell) that the Devil carries, and the key to Hell is also the signal that Diane has suceeded in her plan to have her lover murdered. Finally, Diane is transformed from the sweet, wholesome ""Betty"" (and perhaps when she came to Hollywood, she really was just like that) to the bitter, rejected failure of ""Diane"".
Anyway, I could go on and on, but then I read some of the reviews here, which explained the ""First half of the movie is a dream"". And I wondered if I had totally missed the point. But then I thought, a good case could be made for the ""She's in Hell"" interpretation. This points out the richness of this film. I would compare it to a great but challenging novel. Some works of art require more energy and effort, but richly reward your concentration and patience.
Just one more thing I want to note: my irritation with those people who took a prudish, Puritanical stance regarding the movie because of the sexuality. Come on people, it's an R-rated film, what do you expect! I am especially aghast at the people who were shocked (SHOCKED!) when watching this film with their children. Children under 18 are NOT supposed to watch R films and I wonder at these people's judgement. Re the lesbian content: who cares that it's two women? The love story could just as easily have been about a man and a woman, it's about rejection, people of all sexual orientations can relate. And the [self-gratification] scene, in which Diane despairly pleasures herself again and again, only to realize that there is no true fulfillment without her lover: I found it to be heartbreakingly sad and the very opposite of erotic. The only thing that excited me was Naomi Watts' incredible acting.",1065398400,8,2888,4.754980079681275
1485785,5,B00005JKJA,"Provocative, mind numbing thrill ride that really puts you though the loop. Nothing is what it seems in this film, and you need to watch it several times in order to get the general idea that David Lynch is trying to put forth. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring give great performances as two women trying to solve a mystery of identity and destiny in the city of angels. Take nothing for granted in this film because once the rug is pull from under you, you will need to connect what you saw earlier in order to figure out what is happing before you at the moment. David Lynch is really back to form with this super sleek thriller and this is with out a doubt the best film he has done since his classic Blue Velvet.

But in the last hour you find yourself in the middle of a disjointed fantasy that leaves you disappointed and not caring about the characters.  Its like the writer couldn't think of a way to end his story, so he handed the script over to his deeply disturbed nephew.  If you liked ""Vanilla Sky"" or ""AI"" then you might consider this movie a romp.

1485787,5,B00005JKJA,"Ok, well.  I think the first thing I loved about this film was the dark ambient harmonies and sound textures.  A mixture of soft, subtle and disturbingly seductive melodies, heavy, distorted droning effects, distant exotic murmurs, icy breezes.  The soundtrack evokes a cold alien atmosphere which enhances the provokative abstract narrative and draws you into this dangerously confusing environment full of corruption, superficiality, ulterior motives and deceipt.
None of these characters can be trusted because none of them and their personal motives are fully revealed or comprehended.  It's hard to know whether you feel compassion or pity for them.  The acting is absolutely amazing and powerfully realistic.  I never really found Naomi Watts to be convincing in any of her roles prior to this film.
The storyline and direction is incredibly abstract.  You feel that you have to take note of every precise detail.  The visual sequences alongside the soundtrack are very ecstatic, dreamlike and surreal towards the end of the film.  It all starts to look more like a Bjork video-clip by the end.  It's an exciting ride and wonderfully entertaining even if you don't understand it.  You'll most likely want to watch this film again to get a better idea of what's happening and also to be taken along for the ride.  I thoroughly enjoyed this.  But still......

1485850,5,B00005JKJA,"First off, most people will hate this movie. If you're familiar with David Lynch you should know what you're getting into. This film is just as confusing as Lost Highway, another Lynch film that most couldn't stand. Another movie this one could be compared to in the aspect of how unconventional it is and how confusing it can be, would be Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey.
 I won't bother telling about the plot of Mulholland Drive, but I will say it's a surreal film about love and the devastaion love can cause. This film is very open for interpretation. Most people don't like to think when they watch a movie and all those types of people will swear that this one makes no sense. Mulholland Drive makes perfect sense to me, but I don't believe that there's one specific meaning to this film. It's more like a good painting or song that can mean different things for different people. This movie requires patience and you should expect to watch it at least twice in order to catch everything. A lot of people also complained about the lesbian parts, claiming they were unnecessary. These people totally missed the point of the movie. Sex has always been a huge taboo in the US, even when it's expressed artistically, and that taboo is multiplied that much more when homosexuality is involved. If you like this movie, I'd also recommend Lost Highway and Eraserhead, two other classics by David Lynch.",1064188800,,1423,4.737903225806452
1485851,2,B00005JKJA,"To me this film was a bunch of nonsense. I liked the directing. At times it is really amazing what the director of photography pulls off because some of his shots and depictions of LA were just brilliant. I also liked some of the acting along with the score. The lady that was the land lord complaining about the prize fighting kangaroo in the courtyard along with  whoever played the cowboy were classic Lynch characters that I enjoyed thoroughly. Another stand out scene is the one in the Winkie's on Sunset Blvd. where the guy talks about his terrifying dream. Outside of that I found little in this movie that made sense or engaged me on an intellectual level. It becomes quite apparent in a lot of David Lynch's work (this film and the last 12 or so episodes of Twin Peaks) that Lynch is far better at complexifying the mystery and tangling plot lines than he is at solving them or giving any kind of meaningful resolution. Also, the masturbation and lesbian scenes were both totally gratuitous and did nothing but prove to me how ridiculous a film Muholland had become. If you want to see a good Lynch film go for Blue Velvet or the first 14 episodes of Twin Peaks. I also thought The Lost Highway was better and you might want to give that one a viewing as well. If you liked this film then I would also recommend Gummo and Julian and The Donkey Boy as those two films will be right up your alley.",1064016000,3,1404,4.4

I was thoroughly, ahem, upset when I discovered that the entire movie is one big chapter on the DVD edition.  Now, one of the main benefits of dvds; aside from the enhanced audio/visual, is the ability to go to a portion of the movie at the click of a button.  Though I find it hard to imagine chapters titled ""Blue Key on Table"" or ""Money in the Bag,"" I don't think this movie is *above* something practical like creating some sort of chapter division.
My main complaint with this? If I accidentally hit the chapter button on my remote I gotta fast forward through the movie to get to the spot I was at. This gets very annoying if it happens more than once.
Anyway, the DVD is still the only format I'd buy, just to thoroughly enjoy the music.  Of course, you could buy the soundtrack for that. And you know what? I bet the soundtrack has ""chapters.""",1063584000,,1014,4.377659574468085
1485855,4,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Dr. (David Lynch, 2001)
Mulholland Dr. is everything Eyes Wide Shut failed to be-funny, sexy, mysterious, filled with a primitive awe. David Lynch got himself an Academy Award nomination for Best Director on this one, and was certainly the most deserving of the nominees (I'm still horked about the Academy's complete ignorance of The Others in the same year); Naami Watts and Angelo Badalamenti were nominated for more awards from more different groups than almost anyone else in film that year. Hell, it's even sitting on IMDB's top 250. (Not that the means anything, so is the deeply boring Manhattan. But I digress.)
Trying to explain the plot would probably confuse more than enlighten, and since the whole thing is laden with spoilers from the get-go, I'm not going to try. Naomi Watts is calmer, cooler, and more clear-headed than she is in The Ring (and yes, the overacting is exactly what the character calls for). Laura Harring, the only thing that ever made Black Scorpion worth watching, does a fine job at somehow managing to be mysterious while staying unclothed for long stretches. The rest of the cast, including such luminaries as Ann Miller, Robert Forster, Dan Hedaya, Lee Grant, and Billy Ray ""I can't believe Pax didn't cancel Doc when they saw me in this role!"" Cyrus, all handle their roles exceptionally well (yes, even Billy Ray).
One warning: this movie will make you pay attention. Like Lynch's too-brilliant-for-TV series Twin Peaks, Mulholland Dr. is loaded with symbolism, out-of-nowhere foreshadowing that doesn't make sense for two hours, important characters who only pop up once or twice, red herrings, Lynch's trademark use of chiaroscuro (the best in the business, hands down), and many, many other Lynchisms. Justin Theroux (of I Shot Andy Warhol fame) even makes a passable Kyle McLachlan impersonation now and again. All that's missing is Kimmie Robertson.

I prefer Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and Wild at Heart for their all out absurdity. But I'm guessing that a second viewing of Mulholland Drive would make it even better, and I bet it was amazing on the big screen. I only saw it on video.
Laura Harring is quite delicious in it and the scenes between her and Naomi Watts were steamy. If you don't like weird films, you probably won't like this one. But I think it's worth seeing just for the scene where Rebekah Del Rio sings ""Llorando (Crying)"". Chilling.

She plays the nice manager of a Hollywood apartment building.  Ann Miller is a very talented and respectable actress.  I can understand her taking this role, but I can also understand her not discussing any other part of this film she was not involved in.  She doesn't have to.  I hope she will get a better film or tv project out of this.  I so liked her guest spot in the ABC tv series ""Home Improvement"".  I also recall a Tom Snyder radio show interview she did many years ago that has never left my mind.  Ann Miller is a sweet one of a kind lady.  The last 48 minutes of this film is terrible.  It just drops flat.  But if you are a fan of David Lynch films, don't let me stop you.  This DVD does not contain a chapter selection.  It won't even let you skip to another scene.  The screen goes black and goes into ""Bonus Material"", so you have to go ""Main"" and play the movie all the way through again.  I guess David Lynch wants to make you watch this film all the way through from start to finish.  Special appearances by Lee Grant, Billy Ray Cyrus, Chad Everett and James Karen.

This is a uniquely crafted movie directed by David Lynch.  ""Mullholland Dr."" blends erotica and mystery beautifully.  Certain clues and many unexpected events keep the audience watching closer.  Every actor expresses their character's emotion at the fullest, especially Naome Watts and Laura Elena Heiring, who play an aspiring actress and a woman struggling with her memory loss.  The movie in its entirity proves that it was well-deserving of its four Golden Globe nominations and an Oscar nomination.  This is recommended for those who love risque movies as one will not be disappointed in this piece of art.

1485898,4,B00005JKJA,"There is really only one idea you need to get to watch this movie and understand what is going on. Dreams figure very large in the movie and many references to dreams and sleeping are made early in the movie to clue you in to the fact that much of the movie is a dream.
The ""plot"" is only revealed in the end, but plot is not the main focus of the movie. The movie focuses on the hopes, fears, and emotions of the dreamer as revealed through the narative of Betty and Rita, and other seemingly unrelated vignettes. They are all related. Pay attention to the end of the movie about who plays what role, and then imagine how you might dream such scenes if you just went through the experience of the dreamer's real life.
I gave 4 and not 5 stars because Lynch doesn't do a good enough job cluing the viewer in to the fact that everything is a dream. As I mentioned, dreams are emphasized early in the film, but there are many ways to use dreams in themes. It is too much of a leap to think the viewer will make the connection that the whole thing was a dream in time to understand the movie--or maybe it is just the transition from dream to awake that he mangles. When the dreamer wakes up, some of the characters change names--though I guess that can happen in dreams too. The cowboy clues the viewer into who is doing the dreaming just before the person awakes. From that moment, there is just not enough time to keep up with the sudden switch to the waking world. As soon as the dreamer awakes, the viewer is taken into a series of flashbacks explaining the context of the dream. If you don't get the dream thing(sadly it seems some go through the whole film and don't pick that up) the movie will make no sense.

1485899,5,B00005JKJA,"(This review reveals many details about the plot, so consider yourself warned..) I think that Mulholland Drive is one of David Lynch's most complex and puzzling movies of all time.(except for maybe Lost Highway) In a nutshell-Mulholland Drive is about a character, named Dian Sewlwin, escaping reality through a dream.  Only to be brought back to a horrifying reality that she has created for herself.  The first half of the movie is the dream which is subtly hinted at numerous times in the movie.  The movie starts with a close-up of a pillow and slowly fades to black.  The dream is again hinted at with the line ""I left Ontario and suddenly I'm in this dream place.  The dream ends when the character cleverly named ""The Cowboy"" pops into Dianes room and says ""time to wake up pretty girl.""
Anyways, now that I'm done trying to convince you that the first half of the movie is a dream, we can return to the story now.
In the ""reality"" portion of this film, Diane moves to Hollywood to pursue an acting career, but to no avail.  That is until she meets an up and coming actress named Camilla Rhodes. Camilla helps Diane get small parts in some of her movies.  They end up becoming romantically involved until Camilla meets a young Director named Adam. Diane becomes increasingly jealous which culminates to a climax with the announcement that Adam and Camilla are going to get married.  This sends Diane in a rage which leads her to actually hire a hitman to kill Camilla.  She regrets what she does and can't get over what she has done.  The guilt becomes to much to bare.

I have a fondness for books or movies that's sole purpose is to express just how imaginative or creative the artist behind them is. However, this movie, while it has its moments, is not terribly creative. Before you furiously click the ""not helpful"" button, spit on the ground, and wash out your eyes to clean them from the filth they have just read, I would like to say that I know Lynch has a message with this movie. The ""last thought of a dying woman,"" and the whole complex psychology situation with the two women equalling different parts of the same person...I've read it. I respect that it's not complete mindless self-indulgence, and that's why I've spared it the 1-star review. However, do not mistake this very mediocre film for a brillaint piece of cinema. Just because something is intentionally esoteric doesn't automatically make it something profound. Lynch took an average idea, and decorated it with as much lavish bunk as he possibly could. To me, the whole thing wasn't worth it. Overly complicated, and even more pretentious, Lynch wants the audience to leave the theater in awe, as if the film was just so genius it is above their understanding. The characters weren't very interesting (well the Cowboy, the old man in the wheel-chair, and that magician with the evil smile were all very good) on whole, and I guess that was another major issue I had with the movie.
The movie isn't worth it. Lynch wants you leaving thinking it's profound, but it isn't. The acting is decent, with Naomi Watts being very good, but the woman who was actually some past Ms. America champion was awful. Everything else was pretty bad. If you want to see it because...well, because, by all means. Better to see then to not see. But it's definately not as amazing as it has been hyped up to be.

1485901,5,B00005JKJA,"Let me first say that if you have not yet seen ""Mulholland Drive"", then by golly PLEASE stop reading these or any other reviews!!  There are spoilers all throughout, and they could severely hamper the rare filmgoing experience to be had while watching this film.  I for one knew absolutely NOTHING about the story, and I experienced one of the rarest treats in my 20 some years of avidly watching movies.  This film has helped restore my faith in modern filmmaking.  Not to mention it finally did what I thought would never happen:  I became a David Lynch fan.  I personally did not like ""Blue Velvet"" when I finally saw it a few years ago (though I now know that I must see it again).  And I did not at all like ""Wild At Heart"" when I saw that about 11 years ago.  I thought this guy obviously possessed a unique filmmaking vision, but I simply didn't get it.  I'm really not even sure why I gave ""Mulholland Drive"" a try.  I think part of it had to do with having seen Naomi Watts in ""The Ring"".  Not that I fell in love with her or anything, I just found her interesting to watch in that movie.  But let me say that I also walked away from this movie as a fan of Naomi Watts.  She is simply smashing in this movie, tackling a most difficult role that I'm sure not many young actresses in Hollywood could pull off (though I saw in the cast bios that she's been in movies since 1986).
So with all of that said, I don't want to say anything about the story.  Nothing at all.  Other than just stick with it.  It works itself out, but you will have to see the movie at least one more time and you'll need to think about it.  Be prepared to put aside at least six hours.  And be sure to read the ten clues on the DVD insert card, BUT don't read them until you've watched it once.  If you still don't get it, then come back here and read some of the reviews by the few people that got it and wrote about it.  Just know that while not exactly everything in the story is relevant to the core plot, part of the great pleasure is sorting out what does fit and what are simply red herrings.
You'll be glad you gave this one a try.  But be ready to actively participate.  If you just sit back and let the images fly by you, then you will miss out on a rare opportunity to be sucked into a movie that will do to you what very few films can.  One critic was right when s/he said ""it gets in your head and stays there"".  This kind of thing has never really happened to me as an adult.  Or maybe I'm just regressing to my teenage years and I'm acting like a kid.  Who knows; I just know that I LOVED this movie.  And I am a very demanding customer.
It's got to be the best film made since 1980.  I mark that as the year that Hollywood filmmaking exited its final golden era.  And the two films that mark that exit for me are ""Ordinary People"" and ""Raging Bull"".  I'm not saying that movies got worse.  Our pop culture in general somehow changed at that time and became more commercial, something that we still feel in a much bigger way today.
But on the down side, I must say the DVD itself is disappointing.  There's no reason a 2001 film should come with no extras.  It's not like they have to dig through the vaults to find bonus materials.  And what's funnier, I personally never care about chapters on a DVD, but for the first time I could have really used them here--but David Lynch didn't want it released that way.  How ironic for me.",1056758400,8,3428,4.142424242424243
1485902,5,B00005JKJA,"Truly great film that has apparently inspired some strong reactions. It's a lot simpler than many reviewers make it out to be, but does require you to think it terms of the ambiguity of the subconscious mind. This isn't elitist stuff - nowadays nearly everyone touches on this in High School. Diane is unbalanced and her intense conflicting emotions of desire and jealousy over Camilla have exploded in a deeply meaningful dream/fantasy, her madness culminating in her suicide. An interesting question is whether this fantasy occurs just prior to death, in the time it takes for the bullet to leave the barrel and enter her brain. This merits some attention because, in the dreamwork, Betty and Rita encounter the decomposed corpse of the suicidal Diane Selwyn in the bungalow. So in addition to having to recall your classwork on Freud, Kafka, Camus, Nathaniel West and Philip K Dick, you now have to look up Ambrose Bierce and his ""Occurrence at the Owl Creek Bridge"". You have your homework, there will be a quiz in the morning.....",1055289600,6,1035,4.886363636363637
1485959,4,B00005JKJA,"Betty, a young, aspiring actress, comes to Hollywood where she plans to stay at her aunt's apartment. When Betty arrives there she discovers a beautiful woman in the shower; Betty immediately assumes that this woman is a house guest of her aunt's. It seems that this enigmatic woman suffered a head injury in a terrible car collision and cannot recall her identity. Betty eagerly assists the woman in her efforts to rediscover herself. The film also contains a subplot concerning a film director who is strong-armed into hiring a certain actress for a role for which he is currently casting.
The real mystery is how a film as continuously mesmerizing and spooky as this one is, with marvelous set pieces (especially Betty's audition, the aforementioned shower sequence, etc.), extraordinarily fluid direction and camera work, and containing a sensitive and canny performance by Naomi Watts as the aspiring actress could so completely be derailed in its last 20 minutes or so. David Lynch, for reasons I cannot fathom, decides to play fast and loose with the plot and his characters' identities. The result is unbelievable chaos and confusion. Film critic Roger Ebert attempts to explain away the film's coda as something that could only have occurred in a dream. I call it the worst cop out since Pam dreamed Bobby Ewing's death for an entire season in tv's ""Dallas."" And yet, despite my disappointment, ""Mulholland Drive"" is in many ways, and for the reasons I stated, a great piece of film making that, I am sure, will long linger in my memory.",1055030400,11,1546,4.9272030651340994

 Don't waste your time and money!!
I almost fell asleep. I was walking around the house doing other stuff, coming back 20 minutes later - and didn't miss a thing. The director showed his habbit of filming odd corners of appartments for long tedious minutes while nothing happens. The soundtrack made you want to bang your head against the wall and ask ""Why, oh why"".
If your a twin pix fan - that's right up your ally. That's the only positive thing I would say. I could recommend you go watch ""The man who wasn't there."" It's as pointless and long as this movie was.
Anyone wonders why this movie never got an Oscar for anything? The audience should recieve one for indurance. Who ever spent his money on producing this?
I am doing this movie a good deed, a true favor, by not writing all that I think of it. My true opinion would take too many pages to write... and no-one would read it.

The music, the visuals and the intensity drew me in but I was put off by not understanding.  After reading an essay or two and discussing the film with some friends, I realized that it is intricate but not impenetrable.  A small bit of digging will get you to see the truth of the film and the basic devices in its flow.

However, what the heck is up with this DVD?  Excellent picture? Check.  Excellent sound? Check.  Special Features....ummm...well...
I don't really mind that there are no chapter stops, because Lynch insists that ""films are not books, they do not need chapters"".  Thats fine by me.  But, some regions in Europe have a 2 disc special edition!  The dvd includes full length press conference intreviews from the Cannes (or is it Sundance?) Film Festival, among making of features and more.
Lynch's website ... sells his ""Short films"" and ""Eraserhead"" dvds exclusively in lavish special editions that come in 8x8 boxes with booklets.  On both, Lynch contributes interviews.  (Eraserhead is the brilliant first film from Lynch)  Maybe he can treat Mulholland Drive with the same respect and release an 8x8 box with a two dvd set?  Espically because there is such an amazing history to the film, being that it was supposed to be a TV show!  I would love to hear what Lynch was planning to do with that idea!

1486027,5,B00005JKJA,"I won't bother to add to the already monolithic body of glowing reviews of this film; I think it is a masterful work, equivalent to and perhaps surpassing ""Blue Velvet"" in artistic merit. I am writing mostly because many of those who claim that they hated the film because it ""doesn't make sense,"" or loved it even though it is ""open to interpretation"" may not have taken heed of the clues David Lynch included in the DVD sleeve. They clearly reveal the logic of the film to those who take the requisite time to think them through. My review is essentially one giant ""spoiler,"" so if you haven't seen the film, take heed.

 The film most certainly does ""make sense"" and follows a completely rational and logistically valid plot structure. The film begins with a stylized jitterbug contest behind the opening credits, showing Naomi Watt's character (Diane Selwyn) winning a trip to LA from her native Canada to tryout for a Hollywood production. We then see the suggestion of a sleeping figure (Diane again) in red sheets prior to the start of her dream, which opens with the hypnotic figure of a limosine traveling down a dark road, containing Diane's idealization of her real-life paramour, Camilla Rhodes. In reality, Camilla is Diane's former lesbian lover, who betrayed her by stealing the coveted role in the film Diane unsuccessfully tried out for, and spurned her affections for the director of the film. Diane is so jealous and infuriated that she hires a hitman to kill Camilla; when the two meet to discuss the deal, the hitman says he will leave a blue key on her coffee table to signify that Camilla has been successfully dispatched. The film's dream sequence begins after Diane has received the key, and Diane's fantasies of a happier outcome are manifest in what we see.

 In her dream, she is her idealized self, free of insecurities, more innocent and charismatic--nailing her tryout for the film, but explaining ""Camilla's"" victory by the influence of the mafia (""Camilla"" in the dream is replaced by a woman whom the real-life Camilla tauntingly kisses at a party to infuriate Diane). Other characters who represent real-life counterparts also resurface in the dream, in various roles: ""Coco,"" played by Ann Miller, is actually the film director's mother, the man terrified of the ghoul behind Winkie's is an accomplice of Diane's hired hitman, and the mafiosos played by Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti were other attendees of the humiliating party where Camilla taunts Diane with news of her engagement to the director. In the dream, Diane refashions her hitman as a bungling idiot who botches Camilla's murder, subsequently leaving Camilla helpless with amnesia for who she is or where she came from so that ""Betty,"" Diane's counterpart in the dream, can become her heroine, and have a utopian, romantic love affair with her.

 Throughout the dream, omens occur that suggest the truth behind Diane's fantasy; the forboding man behind Winkie's, Lee Grant's wacko Cassandra-character with her warnings of trouble, the Cowboy, and the MC at the late-night Cabaret who insists that all is not as it seems. The blue key becomes expressionistically rendered in the dream, and opens the proverbial Pandora's Box, at which time Diane mysteriously disappears from her own dream, leaving Camilla alone to open the box--and then Lynch imposes a couple of his haunting frame shifts, here done with lighting effects, before the Cowboy enters Diane's bedroom, telling her ""it's time to wake up, pretty girl.""

 Now we see Diane's reality when she awakens, and evidence of her crushing guilt (notice her initial relief when she hallucinates that Camilla has returned from the dead, and her subsequent breakdown when she realizes the truth). Eventually, the gravity of what she has done overwhelms her when she realizes that the police want her for questioning, and the old couple from her dream, whom I presume represent her conscience, are released by the demon behind Winkie's (that is, she loses her sanity). Her demons chase her to her bedroom, where she hysterically grabs a gun from her nightstand, and takes her own life.

 Check out Lynch's clues--there's much more to them than what I've included here. He's a master--I don't think he produces a frame of film without agonizing over it for weeks, and I highly doubt someone who produced something as lovingly detailed as this film let any inconsistencies or gaffes slip past him.

1486030,5,B00005JKJA,"I will try to write in this review everything you need to know to gain interest in the movie and to prepare yourself for a very new and original experience. I own and have watched Mulholland Drive seven times. Please, take my summary of the movie over other reviews because I am actually a film major in college and have a strong interest in psychology.
  This movie is a new kind of mystery. While Betty tries to overcome her amnesia, other characters and events will seem unrelated, plotless, and confusing. The mystery is primarilly the viewer trying to figure out what is going on. There is a dream sequence in this movie. You will not recognize it until possibly when Diane wakes up. Wakes up which time, I'm not saying. I won't say when or for how long it\\the dream occurs, other than it is long. There will never be an explanation given at the end like in a traditional mystery. You must know all the pieces and put it together for yourself. Things, faces and relationships will at one point make a change. Compare the set up before the change to the ending shot that shows Diane with the lights on her, her hopes and dreams. You will understand how ""desire for things to have been this way(my own quote),"" makes sense out of the whole movie (with a few exceptions). Many don't understand the first Winkey's diner scene. Put together the first and second time you view it, along with the blue key and it's possible location when the job is done, and you will understand. This is a very complicated movie. Also, relate silencio or silence with the little people and the psychological state of (I won't say) at the end, and you will find the significance of wanting silence. As a last note, events of real life (which you only get a hint at) will show up in the dream. I have tried to give an understanding of the movie, without ruining the plot and taking away the suprises the movie has to offer. One last note, At the party, keep track of all the faces. I hope you enjoy a truly amazing, ground breaking, and nominated for multiple oscars (including picture and screenplay) movie. ENJOY!",1050796800,2,2096,4.5131578947368425

Remember the surreal television drama Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me?  How about the movie Blue Velvet?  Both were the work of the master of cinematic dreams, aka David Lynch.  With Lynch, ambiance is everything.  He loves to take stories and rip them to shreds with obscurity and mockery.  Sweet and innocent ""Betty"" (Naomi Watts) moves to the big city of Los Angeles with dreams of stardom and in one particular scene blows you away with her dramatic talent.  Once there she is perchanced by fate when she comes upon an amnesiac ""Rita"" (Laura Harring) and thus ensues a thrilling mystery packed with Hollywoodish imagery and campy overtones permeated by a thick story line that will have you wondering whether it was the blatant Big City Critic reviews advertised on the box which made you rent the movie--or were you really a Lynch fan?  You should choose the 2nd reason because many will not understand the dream like state of most scenes without knowing where the director comes from--just know you will get confused.  The cowboy, the aging silver screen star, the hit-man who can't seem to do the job right--just more details in Lynch's idea of the blindingly (hint, hint) bright lights of Hollywood.  The crux of the movie surrounds the idealistic attitude we have concerning the mediatic white wash of suburbian innocence that in truth is a blatant lie (just a recording) and is in fact a twisted demoralized reality.  Perhaps it is white washed suburbia which gets twisted beyond recognition when Hollywood takes hold.  Or is it?  ;-)  The climax of the film occurs in a very sheik red velvet theatre in which Rita and Betty experience the truth.  A Spanish version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" is not to be missed.  Is everything as it seems?  Not with David Lynch at the helm.",1049846400,2,1906,4.709969788519637
1486033,5,B00005JKJA,"This movie is unlike any other movie I've ever seen in my life.
After watching it, I knew I had to review it, however, I was not entirely certain how I could do it, or what I would write. I could reveal every scene in the movie for this review and would still not tell you anything about the movie. I watched every single moment of the movie with a level of attentiveness I don't ever give films, and in spite of this, I could not tell you what the movie is about--I would be hard pressed to even tell what I think it's about.
The movie mostly revolves around two characters in Los Angeles--Rita (Laura Elena Harring) and Betty (Naomi Watts). Rita, we learn, has suffered amnesia from a car accident; she can recollect nothing about herself, not even her real name--she merely lifted the name 'Rita' from a Rita Hayworth movie poster in Betty's apartment. Her only belongings are a purse which contains a large sum of money, and a curious-looking blue key. Betty, an aspiring actress, has flown in from Ontario to audition for a part in a new movie directed by a man named Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux). Adam is involved the the movie's B-plot, where he must cast a particular actress for the movie's lead or be killed.
Once again, the movie is not really about that, or about anything. The movie can only be described as what it most closely resembles; it has been billed as a mystery, and that is true inasmuch as that there are things that are not known when the movie begins, but the movie is in a state of constant revelation. Resolution is never reached, but the mystery that requires it may never have existed to begin with.
I mentioned how much I was paying attention in this movie. I've never watched a movie before and been so completely drawn in by what was happening. I had no idea what to expect, ever, and I believe it will be a long time before I see a movie again that has that kind of power.
The movie does an out-of-nowhere turn in which everything that came before is rendered completely worthless in terms of plot development, spurned by Rita and Betty's discovery of what the little blue key goes to. Watts and Harring are in the movie after this point, but seemingly are now different characters. Or is the quartet of characters played by the two actresses all the same character? Nothing is for certain.
I watched the movie with two of my friends, Justin, who owned the DVD, and Josh, who was watching it for the first time like I was. Justin and I had come up with explanations for what was actually going on in the movie. Justin said that the last half-hour was the reality of Naomi Watts' character; everything before was her dream. I said that the entire movie was a death fantasy of a character who commits suicide at the very end of the movie. (I will not reveal who, though even if I did, nothing would be spoiled.) Both theories seem to hold water, but that is because everything in the movie to support plot is so scant that it is up to heavy interpretation. In the end I had to say that making sense of the movie was foolish, this movie only makes sense a scene at a time, and to tie them together will leave you with more loose ends than knots.
This is not a movie to see if you are concerned with making sense, this is a movie that is more concerned with feelings and emotions, requiring the audience to admit that they can't know what's going on.",1049414400,8,3381,4.385350318471337
1486034,1,B00005JKJA,"I know a few people who liked Mulholland Drive, and one who loved it.

1486072,5,B00005JKJA,"Honestly, the best movie I've seen in a long, long time.
It seems (after reading alot of the reviews) that this movie has its fans and its not fans. That its movement in telling its tale baffles and enrages some, and inspires others pretty much carries the hallmark of a great film. Films should do that, not just have you leaving the theatre or screen saying 'That was garbage and I can't even bother saying why'.
Maybe it hits a certain relevance with me. After living in Los Angeles and the Hollywood area for a little while, I'd swear to you that such a creature exists lurking behind a Winkies Restaurant. For all those that feel Harlem or New York City is a fearful place to be, I can tell you in all-truth that Hollywood at night is a far far worse place to be, where all those truly on the deranged side figured out that staying warm was a far smarter thing to do. And that the Illusion Factory that is Hollywood snares so many, and you can see the wasteland of it on its streets, just makes Mulholland Drive a powerful statement regarding illusions. I do not feel necessarily pessimistic in my attitude towards Hollywood or that part of California, but I know that being in it gives you an understanding of the un-reality which is that part of the world. It made Mulholland Drive for me, a reminder of things I saw in Los Angeles that seemed unbelieveable, but accepted as fact and something to strive for. And no, I did not go out to Los Angeles seeking fame, fortune and glory. I just like moving and changing the scenery.
I was not at all confused by Lynch's story. I knew it was important to watch everything taking place, to miss one reference would mean its relevance later on would not be as impacting. I knew enough to know that all would eventually reach to some 'thing' or conclusion, and I surely was not disappointed by its ending at all. By THE END I realised I had watched a great piece of filmmaking, probably the best since 1995's The Usual Suspects. Mulholland Drive is suspenseful, intriguing, confusing and puts the viewer in a state of displacement.
I mean, maybe it is just me. But I know alot of people who go out to California thinking alot like 'Betty/Diane' does, that everything is going to be wonderful, no matter what comes. Honestly, that does happen. And as many young hotshot directors as there are, to think that organised crime does not play apart in the industry, and can dictate how your movie will be, should be made would be naive. But thats not all of Lynch's point. Betty's delusional portion of the movie only serves as a 'pointed finger' at elements of corruption within the system, and the people participating. The movie works not only as a cautionary tale, but also as an expose. It actually works on so many more levels than this I can't really even begin to thoroughly go through it point by point.
Lynch produced probably his best work since Blue Velvet for me with this film. I honestly do see what has enraged some about the film, and on the other hand take those views with a slight pinch of salt, knowing that Lynch made some incredible observations about the American Dream, Hollywood, the human psyche and the vast majority of their pitfalls. Beneath the layers of confusion is a true tale of honesty that does not require a pessimistic mind to see its value or worth, nor an optimistic one's constant re-approval that all is well despite.

I stayed with this movie faithfully through the first half (I guess I'm a Lynch fan) and then the ""lesbian sexual scene"" began the second half of the movie in which everything you learned from the first half gets pulled apart and turned upside down.

Please give this film a chance.  It is beautiful and deeply poetic, at times hilarious and at other times sweetly emotional.  Many people write it off as a confusing, meaningless flic, but if you stop trying to ""figure it out"" and just let it be (like a painting in a museum), it'll all make plenty of sense.

At a minimum, I expect any DVD worth the price to have scene selection capability.  This release does not even offer that basic facility. The other ""special features"" are production notes and the trailer, whoopie.  You might as well buy the VHS version.

He should have win the oscar for the best director this time. Although, and that is something I notice in all his movies, except the first one ""Eraserhead"", the different parts of the film doesn't create a 100% globality. They seem very distanced from each other, like 10 different dreams compiled in one. Perhaps because of the radical flashback-cutting method we have to get used to.
The performances are great, the lesbian scene is also great (and HOT!) and the music of Badalamenti is perfectly adapted to the images.

I am sick of seeing the same films made over and over and you always know the good always will win. This is a film about deep obcession, the worst kind. If people can watch this film and get intouch with there deep inner most feelings they may understand. WARNING: Most of this film takes place in the subconscious/mind so alot of it isn't suppose to make sense. Most of our dreams or thoughts don't so why should a film that is obviously conveying that should? Mulholland, serves as sort of a parent movie to the 1997 ""Lost Highway"" which I found ""Brillant""! ""Lost Highway"" was too a David Lynch film about obcession but with a darker and more surreal meaning. This is a film about a girl that was having ""Delusions of Granduer"" and was destroyed by guilt. Basically she dreamed that she was going to be a super actress. In actuality she was a struggling actress and her girl friend was the one on top of the world. When the movie flips to reality what you thought was actually happening was only a figment of her guilt and imagination. She was obcessed with the woman actress and they had a relationship. But when the dark haired beauty decided to call it quits and marry the producer you see just how obcessed she really was. Not only did she dump her she decided to torture and tease and rub it in her face. So to some extent you realize that the woman was evil. Also she was having an affair with another female that was revealed later in this film. The characters are switched around but in the end you will see who's names match up with who. Basically the disturbed and disgruntled actress that was dumped was a bit more in need than we know. There is a scene in the film where she is on the coach"" and you can guess what she was doing"" reminising about the black haired beauty. But any way when it all comes down this movie ends in turmoil. Basically a product of guilt and demons chasing her to her death. The mysterious toy looking blue key serves as a dream version of the real key. The real key was placed at the time to mark that the job was done! And when you watch the film you will know what the job was. The little people or old people in the film they served as satire for ""The Demons"". Mulholland Dr..is another phycological journey just as Lost Highway was. David Lynch keep doing what you are doing your the greatest! This film was nicely filmed with alot of passion and sensuality.
  Note:
If anyone ever read or saw interviews with David Lynch. He doesn't do commentary's nor does he give the options on DVD to skip to the next seen. He wants people to experience the whole film and interpret it for your self. If it takes a person 10 watches then he has done his job!
I personally enjoy a challenge but most people don't. If you don't like to exercise your brain or get intouch with deep innner emotions? This film is definitley not for you!
I Recommend "" Parent Movie ""Lost Highway"" in addition to this!

1486165,1,B00005JKJA,"To begin with, I was nearly unable to start the movie on my PC !! That is because the menus are quite unusual and difficult to use. Also there are some strange guidelines like :  Watch out carefully when you see a shade (abat-jour in french) ,  What are the keys ,  Did you hear the title of the movie Adam is working on ?  etc. That is quite unusual on DVDs.
Concerning the movie itself, there are actually a few good elements in it, especially Naomi Watts who is able to simulate all the  tats d'me  of main character Betty and who renders them well ; however the general impression that emerges from Mulholland Drive is one of great sadness, especially near the end. The beginning is very confusing and depicts a sort of strange car crash at night, while a brunette called Rita is threatened by a man wielding a gun. She seems to be the only survivor, but instead of calling for help,  she hides away and finally finds a refuge in a flat that she decides to squat. At this point, all the charaters seem to be staring in the darkness at some city lights below in the distance.
Then, the story proceeds with Adam Kasher not accepting Camilla Rhodes as the replacement for his main female role ; then later on he refuses Betty again (although Betty had been  prepared  in detail in the hands of another older man who simulates making love with her while she simulates having a virtual orgasm, in front of a crowde of movie makers); then blonde Betty and  brunette Rita go together and discover love, while Adam's wife deceives him and invites Gene -from Clean Gene- to rape her at home, in the conjugal bed. Then Betty continues going down, carried by Rita who stimulates her and initiates her to Lesbianship, pulling out when Betty gets too carried away. As a result, Betty goes into a severe depression and finally seems to be reaching a place of her mind than even her parents would have avoided... Finally, the word of the end, which seems also to be the motto of the movie is  Silenio . So all this depressing story ends up in the middle of a psychologic nowhere; that is to say, there is actually no end ; and because the beginning was an equally strange no-beginning, nothing much remains of this movie.
In fact I would warn depressed people from watching this movie. I found it so sad that I opened myself a bottle of Chteau Audinet french white wine which helped me gulp the story ; otherwise I do not think I would have been able to reach the end safely !!! (but remember alcohol may also be a health hazard)
As a conclusion, I do not understand what message this movie was supposed to carry, but whatever the message, it was not necessary to make such a sad movie to convey it.",1043452800,7,2688,4.388329979879276

Absolutely nothing new or cohesive.

1486169,5,B00005JKJA,"The other reviews are very thoughtful and worthwhile, but I personally believe this film is not an example of Eastern philosophy or specific meanings of any kind, but rather of pure dream-on-film. As such, you can make many interpretations, but it is Lynch's genius to create a work that enables and even inspires people to do so. In that sense it is like a particularly striking dream you might have - it keeps you speculating about its meaning with its vivid details and compelling images, yet never fully reveals its true nature.
The actors do an excellent job with their difficult and sometimes intensely intimate roles, and the production values are uniformly high. Among the scenes that are most memorable are two of the most terrifying nightmares ever committed to celluloid - the narrated nightmare of the young man in the cafe near the beginning, which is one of the only filmed scenes to approach actual nightmares I have had in their intensity and suggestiveness, and the implied nightmare of the discovery of the heroine's dead body - by herself - in a seedy apartment.
But beyond everything else in this film, it is Lynch's mastery of surrealism and cinema that make this his best film since ""Eraserhead.""",1042848000,4,1218,4.860576923076923

1486231,5,B00005JKJA,"I am a 41 year old man, and this is the best movie I've ever
watched. It is amazing because most of the movie is the movie
a young lady invents inside her own mind to explain and subsume
her real life.  In other words the images and speeches are all
filtered through her troubled mind, and any details of her real
life, aside from a few brief minutes in the film, must be
inferred from the film-inside-her-head, which is most of the
movie.

That said, let me proceed with the explanation, as I think it is
not too hard to figure out.  The chief problem in figuring out
the film, is deciding what is dream/fantasy sequence, and what
is real.  Leaving aside the disturbing questions that Lynch
raises about the illusory quality of life in general, I believe
there is a definite part of the film that can be called real-life
and another that can be called dream/fantasy.
The first short sequence of the dancers is fantasy.  The seconds-
long scene which follows - the first-person camera going down to
the red pillow - is real, probably Diane Selwyn as she drifts off
to sleep or death.  The rest of the movie, up until the descent
into the secret box, is fantasy.  The scenes and characters and
lines are inventions of Diane Selwyn.  Whether they are based on
real people, or are composites based on several people, or are
completely unconscious formations is not revealed; we can only
infer.
The next real life scene begins after the box thing, when she
wakes up and lets in her ex-roommate to pick up her things.  She
soon descends into madness/fantasy again, with the hallucinatory
sexual fantasy of Camille.  In my opinion the hit man scene, and
the dinner party are hallucinations (they are simply not logical
enough to be real life), and the real Diane Selwyn doesn't
return until the ominous knocks on the door propel her into the
mad despair which causes her to take her own life at the end.
One of the more interesting things about the film is when in real
time the fantasy takes place.  Is it a life-in-fantasy review
as she lays dying, a haunting dream, or a premonition?  I think
Lynch is telling us something very important about the illusory
quality of our lives, and how life imitates art in very important
respects.

1486233,2,B00005JKJA,"Few films polarize audiences like David Lynch`s Mulholland Drive.  The vast majority of average filmgoers will be unsatisfied with this movie, because it is unconventional to the point of confusion.  Some viewers don't see this as a problem, however, calling the movie  ""eerie,"" ""provocative,"" and ""cerebral.""
People who are fans of Lynch have a thirst for the challenge of traditional aesthetics and the disruption of the conventional rules for watching films.  As a study of art, Mulholland Drive is rich and fascinating.  As a motion picture, however, it just does not work.
Hollywood produces many films that are hard to understand at first (Momento, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, etc).  Each subsequent viewing helps clear the muddiness.  Mulholland Drive, on the other hand, becomes more confusing.  The harder you try to understand it, the more frustrated you will become.
When the traditional filmgoer sees this movie, the viewing is as difficult as someone who enjoys landscape paintings first encountering the art of Andy Warhol.  The experience is totally foreign.  Unless you have a background in some form of art analysis and admire works labeled  ""Post-Modern"" or ""Avant-Gaurde,"" I would not suggest this film.  Those who do love ""art for art's sake"" will call this the best film of 2001.  Therefore, the question of whether you should see Mulholland Drive really is contingent on your own expectations.

1486234,4,B00005JKJA,"In Mulholland drive you have a set of characters, a set of places, objects and sounds. You have what seems to be a an idea of story -Except for the man behind the wall, who is doing it all-. And then, before you can do anything about it, the story goes through a transition point after which nothing can be understood through the simplistic structure of conventional storytelling.
The interconnections between the caracters, their identities, objects and places, are all juxtaposed and thrown around, pieces to a puzzle that just doesn't seem to come together, but your intuition and that intuition which Lynch is a master of conveying into his ideas, suggest that all the pieces could somehow fit together... which in fact they do, in the sense of a dreamlike surrealist space, questions are not answered in a concrete, orthodox way. What happens as a reaction to this, is that one creates many questions on his own, and delves into the feeling of uncertainty with only a vague, but undeniable feeling of having been on wandering on Mulholland drive.

Something that really gets my attention is how David Lynch wrote a story that so strongly suggests a co-dependence in all the elements in the movie but without tying them together through a certain conditioned logic as frame of reference, that is to say, you can sense how each fragment relates to any other fragment, but you cannot make them out to be a cohesive, normal narrative.

There's a scene just before the movie takes a dive, where the two lead actresses are watching a woman sing a Roy Orbison tune in Spanish and they start crying. I think the real reason they started crying was because they figured out they were in a movie that was about to tank.

Just a few of the many questions asked about this film.  Personally, I don't think you're supposed to give yourself a headache trying to figure everything out.  I really don't think there is much to figure out.  I guess I cop out a little and just assume that this movie was all a dream coz it seems to follow dream logic(as well as Lost Highway).  It entertained me though.  Though the big complaint from people is that this movie makes no sense(and to skeptical rebellious intellectuals, it's just show-off artsy fartsy crud trying to pass as art), but almost everyone who watches it, no matter how confused, has watched it all the way to the end.  That says to me that everyone has found some entertainment value in this film.  Positive or negative, it was compelling and bizarre enough to sit through.  It's certainly never boring.  My advice is not trying to be so logical when you watch it.  Why try to figure it out?  You're probably not going to get anywhere.  I think Lynch sometimes throws random weirdness  in to send you on a wild goose chase.  When I asked him about a confusing plot point in one of his films, he gave me a joke answer.  So, I know he's got a sense of humor about his stuff, and it wouldn't surprise me if he was mixing alot of red herrings in with his story.  Then again, if he had actually made this into a series, we might have more answers.  Might, that is.  But, if you're one of those people who just can't stand viewing a film without any kind of solid closure at the end, check out the review below mine.

1486240,5,B00005JKJA,"If you see this film a lot of times, and try really, really, really hard to make sense of it, it can be done.  It might not be the correct view, because there might be no such thing, but it can be a view you can live with.  On the other hand, if you do not want to go through all this trouble, it's much easier to find a movie that will explain it all to you.  For those, I hear they're planning to film ""Rocky VI"".
This is one of the few films where I'll form the opinion that style over substance CAN be a good thing.  There might be substance to this film, and you can go through the drill described in the preceding paragraph to dig it out, but for those that also like to just drink up film technique, this movie is loaded with it.  Practically every scene, even if it doesn't make sense, right away or ever holds your interest and begs repeated viewing.
Those that give it more chances are rewarded as things become at least a bit more clear.  It doesn't matter that you know the ending, because arguably, there is no real ending.  In fact, it's fun to give it repeated viewings because you can take care of a few of those ""Huh?""s you will encounter on the first few viewings.
The only problem I have with it is that the characters are so fascinating I want to see more of them or where they could have gone.  Betty and the director have instant chemistry, and it would have been great to see it develop.  Actually, the ""Betty"" character is so sweet I could see a completely new movie with her.  As that probably won't happen, I'll just resort to more viewings, where I'll no doubt learn more",1041638400,2,1598,4.19281045751634
1486327,1,B00005JKJA,"With the exception of Cameron Crowes pretentious and truly abominable ""Vanilla Sky"", I have never felt quite as much like I wasted too much time trying to figure out an incomprehensible movie plot.  That is until I watched THIS even MORE over-convoluted David Lynch film.

 I think David Lynch has done some fascinating work in his interesting filmography.  I thought ""Blue Velvet"" was riveting, and ""Wild At Heart"" certainly a fun surreal noir adventure too.  Those films had a PLOT.  They didn't meander back and forth between reality, fantasy, fancy camera angles and nuances too subtle to fathom.  From the weird beginning to the anti-climactic unfinished close  that I waited for desperately to arrive, and yet took WAY to long to reach, I wasn't sure what I was watching.

 Who are these weirdos?  Why do they exist, and how do they connect to eachother?  How does a young girl stay at a relatives house, find a strange amnesiac woman naked in her shower when she arrives, and not be alarmed?  Does she call the police? NO.  She comforts her with a sweetness normal folks reserve for relatives and long time friends.  She tucks her into bed, then in the morning, forms a close  and lasting relationship with her, houses her, all the while knowing nothing about her.  That happens all the time, doesn't it?  Loophole?  Rita the ""amnesiac"" also knows nothing about herself, so why should we?  She MUST be a safe and trustworthy person to keep close then. That's the least of the confusion.

Then there's Billy Ray Cyrus playing some movie casting buffoon who looks like the son of Roy Orbison and Elvis.  I know they are both men, but in this kind of film it seems plausible!  He's trying to figure out why his money is gone, while his estranged wife or lover, whatever, has men at the house and he shows up for some confrontation.  He seems like some space creature with his thick rims and silent demeanor.  For a quiet dude, he sure is popular.  Even  more folks show up looking for him.  There's no rhyme or reason for any of it.  Someone actually thought a series of senseless scenes that never connect to the big blank picture, like a huge fat guy smashing the wife and lover in the face, and never appearing again, would be artsy and entertaining.  Did they really think that viewers would swallow this?  Just when you think you know what MAY be happening, the landlady becomes Billy Ray Cyrus' mom at a party that materializes out of nowhere.  What IS that?  Other characters suddenly take on different meanings too.  Meanwhile Lynch takes advantage of the so-called world of ""Lesbian Chic"" by making the two female lead characters into lovers, one obsessed, and the other, that Rita...who even KNOWS what her story is.  Does she have amnesia?  Is she a famous star?  Does she tend Billy Ray Cyrus' Elvis hair-don't personally?  Does she like girls, boys or both?  Only David Lynch, his writers, and the heavy hallucinogens they popped while writing this mess, know for sure.  Even THEY probably can't remember.  I'd want to forget I made this film if I were them too.

 So go ahead, waste nearly three hours on this senseless pointless celluloid yawn if you like. Just keep some headache medicine nearby, and a free hand to hit ""eject"" whenever you've had enough.  I recommend at the last trailer preview before this movie starts.",1041465600,7,3342,4.7076124567474045

We finished it out, and sat there for about half an hour, stunned by how complexity of the way the ideas had been presented

1486329,5,B00005JKJA,"This vision of Holywood by David Lynch is a real gem. We never know when we are in reality or in a film or even in some virtual world. Everything gets mixed up and memory is the basic stake of such a life. One loses his or her memory and lives in a world that is kind of a constant adventure where size, time and space become relative and changing. The surroundings of the characters are never very clearly divided between real houses and streets or cinema settings and sound stages. We are constantly moving from inside a film to the outside world that is so far away from the real world that it is no longer real at all. Some elements from this real world become prompters of the imaginary and phantomlike world of the silver screen. We have entirely penetrated this silver screen and we are absolutely living in it. This shows something important about modern life. Modern virtual communication has become such an essential part of our life that it has taken over our minds and our consciousness. We are no longer able to discrimate between this world and that world, this our real world and that our mental world. This leads to the impossibility to build up any kind of system of values : good and bad don't mean anything anymore and we enjoy the adventure of moving from one place to another, from one crime to another, from one experience to another without having to consider if any of them is either real or ethical. In other words this virtual world of our imagination has invaded our real world so much that we seem to be floating in some kind of drugged environment, in some kind of haunted vision where any one can become any one else and where any one can assume any role at all at any moment and time. Just clap your hands and eveyrthing is different, and a monster may appear behind a wall, and a clown on a stage may become the key to another level of virtual reality. What is reality going to be in the next stage of this development ? No one knows but David Lynch tries to warn us about a complete change in consciousness that menaces our sanity. We may all become insane due to this constant shift of references in our mental environment. And this insanity will become our new reality.

When watching this film, one needs to approach with an open mind.  Many closed-minded people will watch once, say it's garbage because they didn't understand it, and never think twice to see what it's really about.

It perfectly captures the surreal quality, disjointed logic, and manic fright of a feverish dream.  Like Lynch's other classic Blue Velvet, this movie isn't meant to be explained so much as it's meant to be FELT.  Like all great art, Mullholand Drive will have a definite impact on you, even if you don't quite understand it - in much the same way a great painting or piece of music has a profound effect on us, even when we can't articulate the reason.
This is truly a classic, a film that you'll remember long after you've seen it.  After watching Mulholland Drive, you'll have the same uneasy, disoriented feeling you get when you first wake up from a particularly frightening dream.  David Lynch is a true artist, and Mulholland Drive is his crowning achievement.",1040256000,14,928,4.732919254658385

It changed in the middle as if it was a dream but it wasn't.  Too confusing for this movie lover.  Don't bother, it's a waste of time.",1039996800,2,302,3.966666666666667
1486334,4,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch's work has a polarizing effect on the general public.  There are those who love his efforts in film and television and those who hate it.  For myself, personally, I find that Lynch's artistry varies wildly in quality.  When it works (""Blue Velvet"", the 1st season of ""Twin Peaks"") it flows together hauntingly and beautifully.  When it fails, it tends to be merely a mish-mash of confusing, grotesque, often disturbingly violent images (""Wild at Heart"", ""Twin Peaks:  Fire Walk with Me"").
Fortunately, ""Mulholland Dr."" is one of Lynch's better efforts.  The plot itself is has been told a million times:  the often dehumanizing effect of the Hollywood star-making machine, particularly on young women.  Familiar Lynchian themes and images pop up in this film:  innocence lost, weird-looking dwarfs, resurrected pop songs from the early 1960's, and the importance of dreams.
However, the way this story is told is by no means conventional.  What appears to be a straightforward mystery about a femme fatale (""Rita"") eluding her potential killers and searching for her true identity with the help of an unbelieveably naive young starlet (""Betty"") turns out to be a deeper commentary on the meaning of self, particularly in the cutthroat environs of Hollywood.
The first time I saw ""Mulholland Dr."" I was totally confused, but a second viewing cleared up most of its mysteries.  It's fun to watch a film where the director is one step ahead of the audience.  If you fancy a familiar story told in an unfamiliar fashion, you'll enjoy this movie.
Conversely, if you're the type of person who prefers a movie with a beginning, a middle, and an end (i.e., a conventional story structure), ""Mulholland Dr."" is not for you.

Mulholland Dr. is an instant classic along the lines of Hitchcock's Vertigo, Bergman's Persona, and Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (all of which MD makes reference to).

1486430,5,B00005JKJA,"Which Dreamed It? Alice's infamous words apply so well to this twisting puzzle of a movie to decipher. Mulholland Drive is the kind of movie you think about after you watch it, then a couple days later watch it again to make sure you ""Got it"". Lynch has the rare talent to confuse people while still compelling them to watch his films.
  The plot is somewhat hard to explain without giving away ones thoughts of what the movie means. After a woman gets in a car accident, she wanders to the home of the starry-eyed Betty, played by Naomi Watts. Watts is excellent in this movie, starting out as the innocent girl who is amzed by Hollywood, and eventually turns into something much darker and complex, as do all the characters half way through the movie.
  As you can see, it's not easy to explain. The finely made film will keep you guessing, especially after the final scenes. All the performers match the I-have-a-secret look and act it out so stylishly, you feel they're acting for you personally.

1486431,5,B00005JKJA,"True to form, David Lynch has directed another controversial masterpiece that is will stun and shock some, absorb and mesmerize others, and infuriate and frustrate the rest. It is a film that will elicit strong and binary reactions: few will rate this movie as ""average"" or simply ""OK"". Like the rare novel that lurks in the fringes of your subconscious, ""Mulholland Drive"" will not easily go away. And like great poetry, ""MH"" succeeds not in telling a story, but in leaving sufficient doubt to provoke and stimulate, forcing the viewer read between the lines and to insert their own conclusions.

The plot? Suffice to say it is a story of love gone bad, of murder, deceit, and humanity at the depraved pinnacle of Hollywood sleaze. Complicated, nonlinear, convoluted, and garish, it is definitely not your average big screen tale of good guys and bad guys with simple, happy (or even conclusive) ending. It includes the patented Lynch surrealism bouncily freely from dream to reality. While initially the actors seem to be playing their roles like some bizarre ""Father Knows Best""-on-acid 1950's camp, by the end, it all (well, most all), begins to make sense, and the bizarre behavior falls nicely into the ultimate story line.
If you're looking for a simple, linear, mind-numbing piece of eye-candy, don't come here. There are plenty of one-star reviews to read that capture the frustration and absence of coherency many will feel.

The first amazing point to make is that this movie started out as a television show!  Canceled by ABC before it even aired once.... dummies (no wonder they have the lowest rated big network: no guts)  And then brilliantly reshot in places and made into one of the most brilliant and challenging films in recent days by DAVID LYNCH (Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, The Straight Story).
It's a complex movie.  Every single shot.  Every single setting piece has complexity and deeper meaning.  Each scene, camera shot, character and line of dialogue has a deeper and darker meaning then what is on the surface.  Take some time.  Really pay attention.
The brilliance of the movie is that, through all the double-meanings, twists, turns and confusion.  It all works, and it all comes full circle and explains itself.
The main selling point for this movie, in my opinion, is the brilliance of the actors involved.  LAURA HARRING and more specifically NAOMI WATTS were phenominal.  Both deserved oscar nominations (which Harring did get one), and WATTS deserved to win.  Not only did they play complex characters, but they fleshed out numerous personalities from one extreme to the other.

I've pretty much figured out the plot after having watched the film three times, but my interpretation differs a little bit from other people's.  There is room for disagreement, as with most of Lynch's work, which is what makes it so fascinating.

Of course it took me a while to figure it out, but it was worth it. But I won't tell you the real meaning of the film, but it's something about Hollywood's monster machine and how it create or destroys a whole new person.
Betty is this beautiful blonde that moves to Hollywood to become a star. She stays at her aunt's department. There she meets Rita, a strange woman that says that she losted her mind in a car accident, in Mulholland Drive.
That's all I can say.
Naomi Watts is so talented, she seems to be a regular actrees at first but you'll see. Laura Harring is an Oscar winner, she's wonderfull.
Justin Theroux was espectacular, his character was anoying and so well done.
This movie gave me the chills, that old couple, the monsters behind the cofee shop and the cowboy. Was very scary.
One of the things I loved was the music, God, what a maste'rpiece. Club Silencio's scene touched me, I was almoust crying like Rita and Betty.
Mulholland Drive is the best film of the year 2001 and 2002 so far. It's so weird. Lynch's a genius, I love that director.
His way of seeing the world and how he manages to transmit that in a film.

I couldn't follow it, and I didn't care that I couldn't. I love discussing movies, often for hours afterwards, but this movie did nothing other than make me sigh and go ""here's another one that my 'artistically-holier-than-thou' friends will all analyze, and likely wrongly.""
All I could picture was David Lynch sitting back and having a chuckle at creating another bizarre movie. Which he has done. I enjoyed the film's visuals (minus, of course, the requisite and completely pointless naked lesbian scenes). I didn't like the characters or the acting one bit.
Can a movie be made featuring a lesbian couple that doesn't throw in the gratuitous naked scenes? Why do directers exploit lesbianism the way they do? David Lynch may be masqerading as a brilliant originalist, but at heart he ""digs porn"" and caters to a male, voyeuristic audience, complete with two stereotypical porn characters: the blonde, fresh-faced girl-next-door, and the sultry, dark haired vamp. Betty and Veronica, anyone? Perhaps an interesting cliche, but add the lesbian factor and the guarantee that they WILL be naked together at some point, and you've got a perfect recipe to please the schoolboy mentality in 50% of the veiwing audience. PLEASE.
So a part of this audience will sit back, watch this film, and then afterwards chuckle at how mindless some people are for not following its ""brilliance."" Then, of course, will come the ""private reflection"" on certain other scenes. Lots of room for claiming to love the deepness of the film when in actuality, I feel it is a shameless exploitation of lesbianism with enough ""wacky weirdness"" to cover as an ""artsy movie.""",1036972800,6,1855,4.9297124600638975

She is torn, split right down the middle: the wannabe starlet too naive for Hollywood; and the spurned lover whose anger and resentment may (or might have led) lead to murder.  But why are they played by the same actress, and why do they diverge at the point in the film that they do?  The answer is not so simple, but I think it lies in the fact that ""dreams are not only made, but shattered in Hollywood.""  I know I'm getting in deep here, but can we substitute the naive one's drive/passion to ""make it"" as an actress with the spurned one's drive/passion for revenge?  Is Hollywood the sexy lover who uses you only when it needs you and for its own purposes and then dumps you when it's through with you?  Something like that is happening in the film, but you know what?  Lynch's movie is more enjoyable to watch than any attempt on my part to explain it.

1486607,5,B00005JKJA,"...and the best. My favorite film.

 David Lynch's latest masterpiece, as well as my favorite film, is one that you definitely have to think about for a while to figure it out, if you figure it out at all.
 Although it is confusing, I have managed to figure it out for the most part. Mulholland Drive is the story of Diane,a young woman who has just moved to Hollywood. Soon after moving, she meets Camilla, another young actress, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile a director making a movie is told he has to hire Camilla Rhodes or he will be fired. Diane, who has gone out for the same part, is overcome with rage and jealousy and murders Camilla. She is overcome with grief. This all happens before the movie has even started. The movie starts in Diane's dream. Her name is now Betty and she has just moved to Hollywood to become an actress. She moves into the apartment her aunt gives her. After waking the first morning, she finds a woman with amnesia, calling herself Rita, in her shower. She came in in the middle of the night after a car accident. Soon before drunken teenagers hit Rita's car with theirs, Rita is threatened by her driver, who dies when they are hit. This resembles the guilt/denial that Diane feels, since Rita survives. Diane creates Rita as an alter-ego of Camilla. They soon fall in love. While trying to find out what Rita's real name is, they find her apartment with a dead girl inside. This resembles the dead Camilla Rhodes. Rita has a blue key and thousands of dollars in cash in her pocketbook. The money could be either money she recieves for a movie or money for having her killed, it doesn't reall matter because part of Mulholland Drive is the examination of a dream, and dreams are vague..
 Meanwhile, Betty is persuing an acting job. The director of the movie is told he must pick a specific girl by his boss and by a mysterious cowboy, who you see later, after Diane awakes, showing how random elements of real life often appear in dreams. Her name is Camilla Rhodes.
 Rita uses this key she has found to open a mysterious blue box that randomly appears on the coffee table. That's where the dream ends. That's the seperation point. Now you are in the world of Diane. She is slowly delving further and further down a spiral of insanity. Then, she finally cracks. Then she gets shot. That's more or less where the movie ends.
 This is an overall excellent film with outstanding directing, imagery, acting, and symbolism. The definitive thinking man's film.
MULHOLLAND DRIVE(2001)
DIRECTED BY DAVID LYNCH
STARRING NAOMI WATTS, LAURA ELENA HARRING, AND JUSTIN THEROUX
RATED R FOR VIOLENCE, LANGUAGE, AND SOME STRONG SEXUALITY",1036281600,,2667,4.627906976744186
1486608,4,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch: screenwriter, director, composer of the wildly eccentric and master of the unfathomable. Although not a devoted member of the Lynch mob, I do admire his unconventional style. In particular I admire his talent for creating freakishly inscrutable characters.
""Mulholland Drive"" - saturated with bizarre themes, paradoxical ideas, strange philosophies, enigmatic characters and questionable identities - is true to form for Lynch.
In the beginning of the film, several characters are introduced. Some become familiar, while others reappear only once more or never again. In fact, my favorite scene (the coffee shop nightmare) involves two characters with no real significance to the rest of the film.
Wait, no real significance? In a Lynch film, tossing aside the seemingly insignificant is foolish, foolish, foolish! Sure he may pull a bluff or two, but in the end almost everything sums up. Miss something and you're lost.
Like in the beginning. Note the nonchalant scene - it's brief - after the sock hop but before the limo drive. I missed it the first time, I brushed it aside, but it's the KEY to the entire film.
Like everyone, I found the last half hour of ""Mulholland Drive"" to be downright baffling. As the credits rolled I watched in glazed confusion. Not many directors have the bravado to leave audiences in such puzzlement and frustration.

It was a mildly bizarre, but comprehensible, film up until those last 30 minutes. Then all hell breaks loose. Two hours of characterization and plot building get tossed into the air like pieces from an upset chessboard. Relationships are reconnected, personalities flip 180 degrees, settings are repopulated in variant ways and the film unravels like a torn sweater in spin cycle.
Or so it would seem. If only I'd paid attention... The second time, after noting the KEY scene, things became clearer. Believe me, it's not impossible to figure out what's going on in this movie.
Even tentative souls should watch the film if only for Naomi Watts. Not only is she beautiful, she's an amazing, resonant actress as well. It astounds me that Hollywood has overlooked her for the last 15 years. In the beginning of the film she's bright, cheery and nave, then about halfway through she begins to offer glimpses into the depth of her character. When the film hits the paradigm shift in the last half hour, Watts delivers one of the most captivating performances of the year. Don't take my word for it: she was nominated three times for her performance, winning twice.

""Mulholland Drive"" is undoubtedly a movie to see again and again. I've seen it twice and, though I get the general structure, there are still plenty of unsolved mysteries. If that doesn't convince you to purchase it I don't know what will.",1035849600,9,2765,4.982683982683983
1486609,5,B00005JKJA,"This was a complex movie requiring several viewings to unravel the clues and solve the puzzle.  The movie is more along the line of Blue Velvet rather than The Straight Story (both directed by David Lynch).  However, I found the DVD rather disappointing.  There was no way to access individual Chapters to go to exact sections of the movie.  It ran just like a VHS tape. To return to a spot, you must actually put the DVD on rewind.  Further the DVD has a bad flaw.  It stops suddenly after about 90 minutes.  Since there are no Chapters, it's not possible to simply jump to the next Chapter.  After much trial and error, we figured out we start the DVD from the beginning at fast speed until it fast forwarded past the stopped area.  I returned the DVD twice for a new copy; all 3 copies have this flaw, so it must have been manufactured that way.  The DVD is pricey and has no extras except for Cast bios.",1035849600,,907,4.313609467455621
1486610,3,B00005JKJA,"First, let me say that this is truly an amazing film, unquestionably the best thing that David Lynch has ever done.  I give the movie five stars plus.  But if you are buying this DVD in order to dissect this complex work, BEWARE--there is no Scene Select feature!!!!  This is the ONLY DVD I have ever purchased where it is IMPOSSIBLE to jump to a particular scene on an ordinary DVD player--if you wanna watch this, you've got to start at the beginning and go to the end.  I expect a certain perverse quality in anything associated with David Lynch, but this is TRULY ANNOYING.",1035849600,2,577,4.466666666666667
1486611,1,B00005JKJA,"Tempting though it may be to use my allotted 1,000 words to thoroughly trash this perverse, voyeuristic cinematic drivel, I shall instead be brief. This seems to be one of those artistic creations that people tend to either love or hate. Count me firmly in the latter category. In several decades of avid movie viewing, rarely have I so regretted wasting my time and money on a film. I'll admit that the first half of ""Mulholland Drive"" seduced me into thinking, hoping, desiring a big payoff in the second half. But it was just a tease. The second half marks as rapid a descent into nihilistic depravity and madness as I've ever witnessed (and hope never to witness again). However, I can't claim I wasn't warned - after all, it was no secret that this was a David Lynch creation. Given the apparently uniformly raving critical response to this film, I felt compelled to make it known that not everyone concurs. I consider myself fairly intelligent and open-minded, but I just can't help assessing ""Mulholland Drive"" as a pot-holed dead end.",1035849600,22,1042,4.762430939226519

1486614,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch continues to amaze me with his latest film ""Mulholland Drive"", a bizarre journey into psychosis and beyond.  Subliminally, demons are exorcized  while viewing subtle nuances of complete madness that will permeate subconciousness.  This film was totally unpredictable and all of the performances were incredible. One of the defining moments of the film is where Betty fails to heed Coco's warning of the iminant danger in her apartment, she obviously did not get rid of the trouble and consequently, she is taken on a dangerous journey into a downward spiraled path she chose to follow.  There is so much depth and complexity to this film, it is nearly impossible to draw any kind of significant conclusion.  It's like asking someone why they are gay?  So may theories and oppinions but in the end, it all remains subjective.  Can you explain why Betty's shruken mother and father try and scare her to death?  I sure can't, but this adds to the mystery of delusion.  My theory of the meaning of this film is, I compare it to ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""Jacob's Ladder"". I think the first half of the movie is Diane/Betty's decent into death laced with nightmarish images of her subconsious, and the second half is what actually happened leading up to her suicide?  And was that Betty/Diane actually commiting suicide in the bed?  All of this makes you want to throw ""the rubik's cube"" as one reviewer put it, against the wall.  In an ethereal aspect, ""Mulholland Drive"" is a hypnotic film that has a trance like effect on all of your senses.  It soothes, compels, disorients, intoxicates, frustrates, excites, frightens, and teases. A pyschological mind-...that David Lynch orchestrates magnificantly to the open-minded, free-spirited lost souls of the world, in search of truth and meaning.",1035763200,,1793,4.9966329966329965

1486696,4,B00005JKJA,"Following the dismally unwatchable trainwreck ""Lost Highway"", and the atypically mainstream ""Straight Story"", David Lynch redeems himself and proves he still has ""it"" with the brilliant ""Muholland Drive"". Compelling atmosphere and haunting images are blended with a surprising amount of black comedy and steamy eroticism to arguably make this one of Lynch's more consistently ""watchable"" films. All of the Lynchian trademarks are here--a creepy murder mystery, Dreams vs Reality, Roy Orbison songs, Fellini-esque extras (interestingly, no dwarves in this outing), overly made-up torch singers standing in front of red curtains...in fact at times one almost gets the feeling that Lynch is winking at the audience and doing a parody of a ""typical David Lynch film""! A subtly layered star performance from Naomi Watts keeps things moving, and Laura Elena Harring (the new Laura Flynn Boyle? Discuss) nails it as the dead sexy, darkly alluring femme fatale. The much-debated storyline is really a no-brainer-in fact it is yet one more variation on the ""twist"" from writer Ambrose Bierce's classic ""Occurance At Owl Creek Bridge"" (sorry -that's a bit of a 'spoiler', but then again no two people interpret a David Lynch film the same way).

(after all, ""Fight Club"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it took a couple viewings for me to understand everything that had happened in it.) But this movie...I don't even know where to begin. Everyone I know who has seen it absolutely HATED it.

I hate that he doesn't seem to know how to handle ""ending"" what he starts.
Just as he did in Twin Peaks, when he has used up the energy and impetus of adding layers of complexity to the story, he puts in a scene involving an out-of-nowhere character doing strange things in front of a red curtain... and then just lets all the loose ends fall where they may.
Frustrates me so much, because I get so entranced by his beginnings and middles...  I can't help but make comparisons to films like ""Memento"" and ""Lantana"" and (to a certain extent) ""Magnolia"", where the many different strands of the experience are brought brilliantly to an integral completion by film's end. I would find Lynch absolutely brilliant if he could figure out how to carry through all the way with the multiple fascinating strands he sets in motion.

This somehow coincides with the life of over-ambitious filmmaker Theroux who's battling to get control over his big project from mysterious mob group. Only a filmmaker with the passion to explore the unknown like Lynch can effectively interweave unusually complex stories like these and emerge with such a compelling piece of cinema that becomes so intriguingly bizarre that (just like many of his other films) it actually works.

1486701,5,B00005JKJA,"Stories usually have a series of nice parameters: the plot is mapped out clearly with an introduction, rising action, climax, denouement, and conclusion.  Many movie viewers expect and need this comforting, usual structure.
Real life is not often this tidy.
Mulholland Drive by no means follows the conventional rules of literary or dramatic structure.  If you want a nice, tidy, traditional exposition, avoid this film like the plague.
On the other hand, if you would like to be teased, puzzled, fascinated, stunned, confounded, intrigued, turned around, challenged, dazzled, confused, and/or amazed, this is a film for you.
As usual, Lynch blends images of stellar beauty with profound horror.  He has the skill of showing us the grotesque in the ordinary.  Why is the image of a kindly looking grandmother and grandfather-esque couple driving off in a limo so disturbing?
I have now watched this film three times in the past week (watched in the sense of putting in and playing the DVD).  I constantly watch scenes over and over (watch in the sense of playing them in my brain).  I frequently listen (again, in my brain) to the haunting musical score created by Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch.  Lynch is a master of blending image and sound, and Badalamenti is a master at complementing Lynch's images and visions.  Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" is transposed into Spanish, and transformed into a remarkable torch song by Rebekah Del Rio (Playing herself.  Who is she?  Where did she come from?  Why can't I find an album of hers on this site?)  Badalamenti also appears in the film as a disgruntled espresso connoisseur.
I bought the French version of the CD from Amazon.fr.  It includes a few interviews, some clips of the Cannes Film Festival, a press conference with the cast, and a scene index of sorts.
In a nutshell, I adored this film.  It has soared into the ring of my all-time favorite films.  For me, Lynch is a master of the paradox of life, and one of the greatest artists in the visual image.  His cast is superb; the two female leads are remarkable in their transformations.
If you are looking for a ""mindless"" film (in the sense that all is clearly mapped for you), do not purchase this DVD.  If you want to tantalize your mind and spirit, buy now.",1034812800,22,2265,4.796391752577319

I bought a used copy and it was a bit smudged on the shiny side.  About an hour and ten minutes into the film, the smudge part is hit and the skipping starts.
OK, out comes the DVD, the surface is given a once over with a tissue and back into the player.
Now what?  Five minutes of fast forwarding is what.
A while later, something comes up for me two hours into the film and I have to take it out.

1486703,4,B00005JKJA,"This is a film I couldn't stop watching.  It is dark, disturbing and gripping.  Too bad it doesn't make sense.  This 2001 film directed by David Lynch won all sorts of awards and he even got an Academy Award nomination. To enjoy it though, one has to suspend all sense of logic and reality, and just plain experience the surrealist dreamscape in the form of a dark Hollywood film noir that it is intended to be.  You have to look at it as a very modern piece of art and throw away your expectations about conventional storytelling to really appreciate this mystery that never gets solved.
There is a sort of plot.  A young starry eyed Hollywood hopeful played by Naomi Watts is planning on staying in her aunt's empty apartment while she goes on auditions with dreams of becoming a great actress.  The apartment is not empty, however.  A mysterious dark haired woman, has just walked away from the scene of an accident and has wandered in there, not remembering who she is or what has happened.  The two women become friends, and their relationship develops as they search for the dark haired woman's identity. But then there are surreal scenes of murders and intimidation, including a director who is pressured into hiring an actress by some weird surreal murder threats.  Seemingly kind people turn ghoulish, there are dire warnings of trouble, and both actresses wind up playing a variety of roles. It all seems like a horrible dream, and indeed it is.  I yearned for a satisfactory conclusion, but as the film went on, it just got murkier and murkier.
Although I can understand some of the artistry, this film was a little too weird for my taste.  I like my stories to have a beginning, a middle and an end, thank you.

I still cannot, with confidence, say that I understand the blue box, or the Silencio part.  I have my theories, but they remain just that...theories.
If you want to simply sit on your couch and be fed a storyline with a nice beginning, middle and ending, then you will be disappointed.  Only by carefully examining reality, and the characters actions and motives can you understand what happens throughout this movie...in a retroactive way.  This is a great conversation piece because it is chock full of meaning and symbolism.
The only problem I have is with the DVD itself.  There are no chapters in this movie...only one long movie, as if you're playing a tape.  I think the director did this in order to make it as difficult as possible to figure this movie out.  But it is still quite annoying nonetheless.  Thus....4 stars.  It upsets me because I LOVE the part in Silencio where the woman sings a Spanish version of ""Crying"" (it's spine-tingling), and this part is toward the end.

Lynch has made a career of strange films, with quirky characters, non-linear plots, violent and/or psychosexual imagery, and themes which invite ever interpretation under the sun--that is, unless the viewer simply dismisses it as ""too weird.""  With such a history behind him, Lynch's latest film seems nothing if not a natural progression from its predecessors.
The plot can be summarized in only a few sentences, but the paths the characters (and their seeming alter-egos) take could fill up a book.  Many viewers have said that multiple viewings have still not cleared away the cobwebs of their confusion.  However, I was quite surprised to find that even after seeing it once, I felt like I ""got"" most of it.  I feel simultaneously lucky--and fearful that my interpretation was incorrect.  Consequently, I will be returning for several more viewings.
Kudos must go to Lynch's masterful direction, the beautiful cinematography (curiously, shot in 1.85 rather than 2.35 like, say, Blue Velvet), the music, and the great acting.  And even if the story confuses the heck out of you, you can still enjoy the two hot girls.",1033171200,2,1285,5.119617224880383
1486782,5,B00005JKJA,"Don't listen to anyone who tells you that this movie is impossible to understand. That's not true. Difficult, yes...especially on first viewing, but there is method to David Lynch's madness and there is an explanation to be found for those willing to look.

Mulholland Drive is a brilliantly structured film even though the structure is unconventional. Basically the first two hours play out as the dream of a very troubled young woman by the name of Diane Selwyn. In the final 30 minutes we are taken into Diane's reality. Mullholland Drive is a very disturbing portrait of the inner world of a woman about to commit suicide and we learn about her life and what led her to murder and suicide through the dream imagery of the first two hours.

What confuses many people the first time they see Mulholland Drive is that David Lynch doesn't use the normal cinematic techniques to tip his audience off that they are watching a dream segment. In fact, the dream plays out in fairly conventional linear fashion while it is the reality portion of the film that plays out in non-linear form, jumping back and forth in time and introducing psychotic hallucinations as well. This further blurs the line between reality and fantasy in this film.

Contrary to popular belief Mulholland Drive is actually very intricately plotted, although the narrative is not readily apparent on the first viewing. The dream portion is a mirror image of reality and it displays a reversed reflection of Diane's real world. A few examples: In the dream Rita exits the limousine and walks downhill; in reality Diane exits the limousine and walks uphill. In the dream Aunt Ruth is alive; in reality Aunt Ruth is dead. In the dream Adam Kesher's world is spinning out of control and he is losing everything; in reality Adam Kesher's world is very much in control and he has everything. In the dream the hitman is incompetent; in reality he turns out to be all too competent. In the dream Camilla is alive and Diane is dead; in reality Diane is alive and Camilla is dead.

Betty is, of course, the idealized dream version of Diane. She's a prettier, more wholesome, and more talented version of Diane. However, Diane is not Betty in her dream as most people automatically assume...she's Rita.

Mulholland Drive is a challenging and haunting film that I believe will only rise in stature as the years go by. David Lynch spoonfeeds nothing to his audience but challenges them to explore the nightmarish inner world of Diane Selwyn for themselves and reach their own interpretations and conclusions. There are great rewards for those willing to do so.

Nov. 1, 2007 Edit:

I just watched Mulholland Drive again after a few years and I was kind of surprised to see this old review of mine written years ago at the top here.  I do think my understanding and appreciation of the film has deepened over the years and, although I still believe most of what I originally wrote is correct, I'd probably modify it a bit, especially the part about Diane being Rita in her dream.  I now believe that Betty and Rita both represented different parts of Diane:  Betty was her idealized, innocent side while Rita was the darker, more seductive side that she believed would help advance her career in Hollywood.  One of the saddest parts of the movie, in my opinion, is my belief that the very likeable and attractive Betty was the person that Diane could have been if not for her tragic childhood and the series of destructive choices she made in her life.

For those who've read and commented on my original review and are interested, here's a somewhat revised version that represents my current interpretation of the film.

Mulholland Drive is a rather chilling look into the psyche of a deeply disturbed and suicidal woman named Diane Selwyn who is guilt stricken over her involvement in the murder of her estranged lover.  The entire movie takes place in her apartment over the course of a few hours on the day she commits suicide.

The first two hours is a dream Diane has during a heavy, drug-induced sleep that attempts to rewrite a happier, idealized version of herself and her life from the time she arrives in Hollywood, but gradually grows darker over time and eventually collapses back into her reality.  The final part of the movie is her reality which is told through a series of flashbacks, memories, and psychotic hallucinations.  First-time viewers often don't realize they're watching a dream since Lynch doesn't use the usual cinematic techniques (other than a brief first-person descent into a pillow at the beginning) to signal a dream sequence and this part of the film is told in fairly conventional linear sequence, while it's the reality part of the film that jumps around in non-linear fashion.

The dream portion is kind of a dark, twisted version of Dorothy's dream from the Wizard of Oz where she casts people she knows from her real life into various roles in her dream.  But since her subconscious is the producer, writer, and director of the dream these people are just actors on her stage and everything is really about Diane and her life even if she doesn't appear to be represented in a scene.  For example, there's no reason to believe that a wealthy film director like Adam Kesher would check into a fleabag hotel like the Park Hotel when he thought he still had access to all his money nor would he know the hotel manager by name.  Diane, however, who had lived on the fringes of the Hollywood dream, might well be familiar with this kind of seedy hotel and its manager.

Once you realize that everything you're seeing in the first two hours springs from Diane's subconscious mind it's possible to take the clues and symbolism that Lynch plants in the dream and construct a remarkably deep and complex examination of Diane's life which also peels back the layers on a psyche that's been irreparably damaged by sexual molestation by her grandfather, prostitution, and a destructive relationship with an actress named Camilla Rhodes which ultimately leads to murder and suicide.

Mulholland Drive is not only David Lynch's masterpiece, it's one of the most chilling movies I've ever seen.",1033084800,752,6175,4.793785310734464

I can't speak based out of comparison to his other films, but simply on its own, I find it to be the most incredible film I have had the pleasure of viewing.  After the first watching, I will admit that I was MASSIVELY confused and immediately sought out friends who had seen the movie to get an explanation.  This was a gigantic mistake.  My recommendation to anyone about to see this film for the first time is to watch it over at least twice or even three times before consulting outside sources.  The answers ARE there, it just takes time to figure out all the clues.  Based off of this film, I would say that Lynch is one of the best directors I know of today.  A friend of mine has said that she believes he is even more of a brilliant surrealist than Salvador Dali, and I can't help but agree with her.

The film is centered around a car crash that takes place on Mulholland Drive, one that leaves Naomi Watts with a case of amnesia.  She stumbles into a woman's apartment, falls asleep and is awoken by the woman's neice.
This is where my understanding of the movie ends.  Beyond the first half hour it becomes weirder and weirder.  I finally gave up on it and went to bed.
In my opinion, most people who claim they love movies like this are guilty of letting the critics shape their opinion.  They are quick to jump on the bandwagon, but for the most part, fail to have a deep understanding of the film.

But wait, this is not just an average film about vanquished hopes and overwhelming trials in the city of celebrity, this is a David Lynch film, therefore, it must have a DEEPER meaning. Let's go and see shall we........
Two girls meet in LA. One, a blonde, is a classic girl-next-door type who will have every viewer falling in love with her.  The other girl, a brunette, has seemingly lost her memory and will have every guy lusting profoundly after her.  The dark haired gal was almost killed in the beginning of the film - twice. The two gals meet up and the blonde - ever ready to help a hottie(I'll explain in a moment) - does her best to help the other lady find out her indentity.  Then, right when we're thinking that maybe Lynch won't pull any of his usual ""deep and artistic"" stuff, we're abruptly taken into Lynchland........
The two girls are lesbians(nice touch, Davey, especially for the porn-hounds out there), and they seem to change identities on numerous occasions, throwing off every single viewer into utter disorder and confussion.

I have had conversations with many people about this movie... and while the most common answers are ""It was cool"" or ""It was weird"", no one has been able to clearly explain the plot or the last half of the movie... I can say I did understand most of Lynch's symbolism but overall I feel alot of it was unrelated to the movie and added simply to leave the viewer wondering about their relevance.

1486858,4,B00005JKJA,"Be prepared; if you don't like having to think about a movie, Mulholland Drive isn't for you. It is unlikely that everything would click for a viewer the first time that they watch the movie anyway...although viewing Lost Highway might be a suitable primer.
In many ways, Lynch seems to have issued the same challenge to viewers in Mulholland Drive as he did in Lost Highway, a bending of timelines and juxtapositioning of identities. It's as if the director is saying, through Mulholland Drive, ""Perhaps I didn't make myself clear to you the first time."" For some reason (I don't know -- is it really the lesbian scenes?) the second attempt has been more popular. I find both movies compelling, unsettling, and entertaining.
That's the review. Here's an explanation.
The knee-jerk response of many reviewers has been that Diane dreams of being Betty, but wakes up to the cold reality of being Diane, and ultimately kills herself. That would make the movie run from Point A to Point B, which is what movies usually do.
But the dead Diane appears in Betty's world, and that was my first problem with this tidy explanation. Also, if you think the movie is purely linear, then Diane is psychic, because she dreams of Coco (the landlady) before she ever meets her in reality (the director's mom). Ultimately, Betty's world is no more of a dream than Diane's is; it depends on point of view, like a Mobius Loop. The reason one side is accepted as real is because of where the Mobius Loop is cut: right after Diane ""sleeps"" (dies). Splice the movie ends together, and you can't tell the ""dream"" side from the ""reality"" side. Much of this Mobius Loop is made of cycles:
* Betty begets the blue box; the box, once opened, begets Diane and the old couple; the old couple drive Diane to suicide but beget Betty; ad infinitum.
* Betty becomes Diane, and Diane becomes Betty -- not just the actresses, but the waitresses, too.
* Rita (Laura Elena Herring) of Betty's world coexists with Camilla (Melissa George). In Diane's world, Camilla (Laura Elena Herring), whispers to, and kisses a woman (Melissa George), at the party near the film's end. Maybe that woman should be called Rita. After all, everything else switches.
* Camilla (Laura Elena Herring), despite surviving an attempt by the limo driver to kill her, is effectively ""eliminated."" She has to be replaced. She is replaced by...Camilla (Melissa George). When Betty becomes Diane, Camilla (M.G.) becomes Camilla (L.E.H.). And so on.
* Diane falls into the red pillow; Rita falls into the blue box. The Red World is Betty's/Diane's dream come true and Rita's/Camilla's nightmare; the Blue World is Betty's/Diane's nightmare and Rita's/Camilla's dream come true.
* Betty's apartment (Aunt Ruth's) is red and yellow; Diane's is blue and green. Many other warm/cool color motifs correspond.
* The red singer ""dies"" on-stage, and is effectively silenced, as the Red World reaches its twilight, and the blue box is discovered. The blue-hair in the balcony cries ""Silencio"" at the film's end, when the Blue World reaches its twilight: Diane's blue-smoke demise, but also Camilla's demise as well, as she will soon lose her limo ride, her movie role, and her memory.
Most importantly, the Silencio theater is a metaphor: What appears real -- a trumpet solo, a singer singing -- is false. In effect, Lynch drops the biggest hint: If you are looking for the reality in this movie, you won't find it.",1031702400,76,3439,4.8603066439523

It made no sense to me, and I couldn't make head nor tail out of it, but I wanted and needed to see it again.  The second time I finally managed to understand most of it (there are still some things I don't get yet), and I came away with a new outlook on the film.  David Lynch knows how to craft emotional and haunting moments, and Mulholland Drive is no exception.  Lynch pulls out all the stops just as he did with Blue Velvet (although I still feel Blue Velvet was a superior film and Lynch's best) and takes you on an emotional, heart wrenching roller coaster that will haunt you long after viewing it.  Naomi Watts' talents are greatly underrated, she absolutely shines here, as does most of the rest of the eclectic cast including Justin Theroux, Laura Elena Harring, Ann Miller, Dan Hedya, Angelo Badalamenti (who also composes the music to the film, as well as many of Lynch's other films), Billy Ray Cyrus, and Robert Forster.  All in all, Mulholland Drive is not a movie for naive audiences; those expecting a straight forward thin storyline should look elsewhere.

Thanks to him, cinema really goes forward, introducing new and uncommon narrative and multi-dimensional characters. His fiction, then, gives us to try and reconstruct a plot, feelings and characters, which is a unique and wonderful experience. Grasping reality is not an easy matter. Instead of giving us straight forward answers and certainties, David Lynch, as a real artist,unveils the complexity of life and human relationships. I 'd also like to say how wonderful Naomi Watts is. She is the one who brings life to Betty, the multi-facets cornerstone character of 'Mulholland Drive'.

1486954,5,B00005JKJA,"A mind-bending and misunderstood film primarily because the story is revealed out of sequence, and includes dream and real elements.  We are allowed to encounter two disparate worlds here, both the signature Lynch too-vivid-to-be-true style (like Blue Velvet), the stuff of dreams, where time and conversation and color and humor are skewed; as well as the brutally-honest world, where tired characters must face the depressing truth that Hollywood flattens more dreams than it uplifts, love is hard to find, and girls who win jitterbug dancing contests may not be headed for easy stardom.  This is vintage Lynch with all the images, color, double-meanings, and twists of plot you expect.
This campy and visually delicious film shows a re-imagined story where everything and everyone is transformed, and the story is interesting and enticing.  A mystery is unfolding; a mystery of identity, love, reality vs. dream, and life vs. death.  All lines are crossed.  Then the film reveals the sad reality, completely changing the tone of the last third of the film, and causing us to reframe the whole story.
The acting is sensational, especially Naomi Watts, who transforms herself into two different characters, barely recognizable as the same woman.  Those who enjoy symbolism will be occupied for hours, analyzing the blue key(s), nametags, the meaning of ""Silencio, no hay banda,"" the cowboy's speech about our attitudes shaping our lives, recognizing what is dream vs. reality, and discovering numerous links between them.

1486955,4,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive was the first movie directed by David Lynch that I had ever seen.  When the end credits of Mulholland Drive began to roll I was slightly confused but very impressed by what I had seen.  It was clear to me that Lynch is a very talented director.  Mulholland Drive stuck in my mind for days after I watched it.  Contrary to what many have claimed, I think that there is some sense to be made of this movie.  The movie is a look into the downward spiraling mind of a naive young woman who came to and was destroyed by Hollywood.  The first half of the movie is how she wanted her arrival in Hollywood to go.  Rather than having a bad audition for the 'Sylvia North Story' she has a sizzling audition in her dream only to have her opportunity taken away by forces she couldn't control.  This and many other points of Naomi Watts character's seemed clear to me by the end of the film.  I think that if you are willing to pay attention to events in her dream and how they compare and parallel the events and dialog near the end that narrative arc of the movie makes sense.
Having seen Mulholland Drive, I made a point to see some of Lynch's other works.  Of the Lynch films that I have seen (Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, Eraserhead and the Straight Story), I was absolutely floored by Lost Highway.  I thought that Lost Highway shared similar thematic elements with Mulholland Drive except that it didn't have any of the loose strings that Drive did (a result of its initial status as a TV pilot) and that visually Lost Highway is was a cut above.  After seeing Lost Highway, Drive felt almost like a Diet David Lynch by comparison.
Mulholland Drive rates below Lost Highway and Eraserhead in my view but is still a compelling film and an excellent introduction to the mind of David Lynch.  This is not his strangest or his most disturbing film (honors that go to Eraserhead and Blue Velvet repsectively).

1486957,5,B00005JKJA,"'Mulholland Drive' is the kind of film that leads to seemingly endless debate and theorizing. Message boards fill up with commentary claiming genius as much as absurdity and frustration. This is actually a rather intimate film in the home viewing format, producing unique reactions and wide ranging emotions. Each viewer takes from David Lynch's masterpiece what they will, but everyone has an opinion. Why? One can not walk away from this film and simply forget about it. The human mind resists because the urgency to unveil whatever mystery lies within those hypnotic two and half hours is just too potent. 'Mulholland Drive,' unlike Lynch's 'Lost Highway' will indeed give up its most telling secrets. Those ten clues offered in the sleeve of DVD additions aren't simply a hoax. For example, as noted by Lynch, there really are two extremely important clues revealed even before the credits roll. I will not reveal them, but I will say this. One of these clues is valuable to first time viewers. The other is, for the most part, beneficial only to those who have already seen this picture. Yes, there are a few subplots that really don't contribute to the main theme, but they're incredibly interesting and entertaining nonetheless. Take for example the black comedy of that triple homicide and the exploding vacuum cleaner. This scene is obviously a loose end from the serial story Lynch had in mind for ABC, but how could he not include it?
The character Naomi Watts portrays is the center of this film. Her performance is nothing short of a miracle. Pay particular attention to the astonishing duplicity she serves up playing both 'Betty' and 'Diane.' Yes, that disheveled blonde in the final half hour is played by the same actress that gave 'Betty' all that excessive sweetness and charisma.
I won't reveal anything about the plot because, prior to experiencing this film for the first time, it's hardly necessary.
In addition, describing what makes this film great would take far longer than this review could possibly be.
Briefly, 'Mulholland Drive' offers vibrant imagery, jaw dropping performances, great lines, A. Badalamenti's incredible music, rich and exceedingly rewarding ideas, and a holistic experience that will stick with you long after all those popcorn summer blockbusters begin collecting dust at the neighborhood video store. 'Mulholland Drive' melds the dreams we aspire to attain together with the dreams we create when we sleep. It displays a sharp intuitive sense of how we internalize hope and our desires for the future. What's more, this film develops fascinating characters based on the fantasies we fall in love and the realities we wish to shun. Why mince words?

You will find yourself thinking about this film for days afterwards, and each time you view it you will spot things you missed last time. The effect is to make each viewing of the film a new experience.
Besides the thought provoking storyline, and the clever imagery, the film itself is also aesthetically pleasing. The camera work lends a feeling of first person presence - as if you were witnessing the events first hand.

While `Lost Highways' strung us along like the Lynch junkies we are - `Mulholland Dr.' is a painful experience that is only kept alive by the enormous performances of the lead cast and some memorable supporting roles.
The young and alive Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives in LA to try and get a job as an actress. Staying in her aunt's apartment she meets up with Rita (Laura Harring) who has lost her memory but has a ton of money on her and a single blue strange shaped key. The perfect mystery begins and Betty tries to help Rita discover her true identity.
The cause of film's failure is that it does not develop the devices that grabbed our attention at the start. There are many good ideas at play, yet Lynch decides to go down a route that we would find in one of the duller episodes of Twin Peaks (of which there where hardly any). However, `Mulholland Dr.' was originally a pilot episode for a now abandoned television series and this may explain the lack of development and the surprise that never comes. Clocking in at 145 minutes this film could well have been played out in 90.
Experimental it may be, but at the same time it is not a film that delivers on its promises. We don't mind wackiness, a story without meaning or quasi-dimensional worlds (that is why we watch Lynch movies!) but we do mind excellent ideas that are cast aside for more trivial and banal discoveries that serve no more of a function than to knit one scene to the next.. Arrrrggghhh it was amateur in so many ways. A sorry case of hit and miss.
The film is not all bad though. There are many funny moments, interesting predicaments and wonderful sets pieces. Notably, the hitman's attempt at keeping his work quiet, a scene involving a philosophical cowboy (keep an eye out because you see him once again oh yes!) and the weird concert.
All in all the film feels rough on the edges and has a rushed look to it. If only Lynch took the time out to just revise the script and give it the bump that it is crying out for, then I am sure we would all be watching it over and over again. It had all the ingredients but the Lynch cake just didn't bake this time.",1030320000,6,2151,4.3399503722084365
1487093,4,B00005JKJA,"I am constantly amazed when I hear people moan about films that are not simple to interpret. Whoever said that a film has to have a plot or make obvious sense. Film is art just like paintings or books and sometimes half the fun is discussing one's own interpretation with others. It's the exercise of finding support for your arguments that I and many others find stimulating. Don't get me wrong, I like your basic plot movies just as much as anyone else and appreciate zorbing out watching a movie for pure eye candy or entertainment value without having to think (Stars Wars or Collateral Damage come to mind.) However, it's refreshing in I guess a weird way, to get completely confused and mesmerized by a film that leaves you thinking for days. What also baffles me are those who complain about Lynch's movies yet still feel compelled to watch them. It's like they go through the process just to say, ""I told you so. I couldn't understand a thing."" Harsh as it may sound, those persons may be better off sticking to formula Hollywood movies where things are predictable and completely spelled out for you.
Are Lynch's films high art? Does he make them for film snobs? Hardly. This is a guy who I think is fascinated by the human condition and the onion skins that layer our societies. Just like any other director, sometimes his films flop (Dune) other times they deliver like Mulholland Drive. The imagery, characters, situations, script, and especially the acting, are all above par. I can't say enough about Naomi Watts. I couldn't be sure that Betty and Diane were the same actor until I watched it a second time. Really skilled actors have this uncanny ability of mind over matter, or in this case, mind over body and visage. What is Lynch trying to say? The hell if I know. Is he trying to make a statement? The hell if I know. Do I care? I don't think so. Did I enjoy the 2.5 hrs x 2 I spent watching it? Most definitely! For those who prefer your basic formula movies with clear theme, storyline, and message, rent the recent, ""Behind Enemy Lines"" and stay away from this movie. You will not enjoy it. For those wanting to watch it just to see the lesbian scenes, you will be disappointed. All the scenes are done with minimal nudity and are far from being gratuitous. For those who enjoy ambiguity, rich imagery and symbolism, deep emotionalism, and yes, some shocking and disturbing scenarios, I think you'll enjoy this one.",1030320000,4,2438,4.606896551724138

1487096,5,B00005JKJA,"wow. that was the one word that came to mind after watching Lynch's Mulholland Drive for the first time. That, and, ""my head hurts."" After watching it a few more times, I feel that I am qualified to write a review concerning it.
It was originally a TV pilot (the first episode of a TV show), but when the show didn't get picked up, it was turned into a movie. The fact that it was a pilot is evident, there are many storylines happening at once, some don't get resolved all the way, some don't really get resolved at all. The biggest complaint that most people have about this movie is that it doesn't make sense. But i say, why should it have to? The movie is complusively watchable, headed by the beautiful Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, and filled to the brim with memorable scenes that range from outright hilarious (the botched murder that was supposed to be staged as a suicide) to the breathtaking (the night at Club Silencios). It is this latter that truly blew me away. As the host utters, ""it is all an illusion"" we know that he is not only speaking about the events occuring onstage, but also about the movie itself. But that he could come out and say that what you are watching is fake, and (for myself at least) then that we can totally forget it, only to be reminded of it again in a matter of moments is astonishing. That scene is one of the greatest scenes in any movie I have watched in a long time, perhaps ever.
And it is the last half hour, after the box has been opened, that really calls for repeat viewings. As one other review put it, it feels like all the pieces are there, all the clues are in front of you, and all you have to do is put them together to figure it out. Personally, i haven't quite gotten it all figured out yet; I doubt anyone besides Lynch will ever really know everything there is to know about the story. But man alive, its refreshing to find a movie that doesn't spell everything out for you, it's great to see a departure from normal Hollywood fare. I will take this anyday over any blockbuster that can be spat out in a matter of minutes. This was my first foray into Lynch's world, and you can bet that I will be returning. Oh, and to give kudos where it is due, the score to the film was OUTSTANDING, and provided great tension and suspense; one stand out is an early scene that takes place in broad daylight in a parking lot. to anyone who is looking for something of a different flavor, and is willing to open their mind to a different type of movie: WATCH THIS. you will not be disappointed.

I'm not sure why anyone would want to spend their precious time trying to find an explanation for what happens in this thing after seeing it. All attempts will fail. Or maybe all attempts will succeed. Either way, this is Bizarro world brought to the big screen. It's kind of creepy and it does wrap you up and hold your attention, even though as it progresses you have less and less grasp of what is going on. By the end I was confounded and dumbfounded. I give it five stars for keeping me riveted to the screen and zero stars for after-viewing satisfaction. I may watch this again to see if it actually does make some sense.  But, as one of the great unwashed, unlike many of these pretentious, film genius reviewers who spend all day with this DVD in a loop and then countless hours disecting it because they decry being ""spoonfed"" their films (By the way, since that word seems to show up in so many reviews about this film, I wonder if Capra, Griffith, Keaton, Chaplin, or even Hitchcock ever complained about ""spoonfeeding"" their audiences with pure entertainment.), I don't need an answer to this puzzle or have a need to supply some film-school artistic interpretation.

1487098,5,B00005JKJA,"Freud suggested that dreams contained a sort of censor which cloaked disturbing thoughts from awakening us.  And so it is that the heroine on ""Mulholland Drive"" dreams of how she would have liked her Hollywood adventure to be.
But what of those daytime dreams that provoke us to leave our safe haven and naively make Dorothy think she can leave Kansas?
Heroic when the dream realizes itself; devastating when the dream becomes a living nightmare, from which only sleep and reverie can bring relief.  Finally that is not even enough as the reality of what has happened and what she has done invades the dreams of the now jaded young Canadian.

I paid attention to various plot elements, waiting for their meaning to come to bear later on. They never did. Just when you think you're lost, David Lynch throws in a huge plot twist (with that blue box) that confuses you twice as much.

It starts out with a stirring storyline as we meet a beautiful woman who has lost her identity after a freak accident. Along comes Betty who has just arrived in Hollywood on a bus from Ontario. The girls become fast friends, and Betty who comes upon our needy beauty, who has decided to call herself Rita for the time being, is bound and determined to help her find her identity.
Lynch throws in scenes that are there just to make you think and if you are trying to figure out the second part of this film just forget it and go with the flow because once Pandora's box is opened life will never be the same for any of our characters. Names change, characters do about faces, and the roller coaster ride begins as you try to piece it all together.
Lynch seems to enjoy leading the viewer on a merry chase to no place, and if you think you will ever get there, think again because you won't. Take away what you like; it is up for grabs. This is a movie for the person who thinks outside of the box and the answers are unique to each person who sits down to watch it.

The movie itself defies description, absurd surreal nightmares fuel much of the film.  The movie is in the detail.  Every shot is immaculately set up, Lynch intending on the placement of everything in each scene.  Although the cinematic metaphors and symbols he use take the movie to a new level, the acting itself is great.

My second viewing pretty much crystallized everything for me. I had waited a month since my initial viewing and had tossed the movie around in my head, as well as talking about it with others who'd seen it, and of course, surfing the Net to see if other people had the same opinion as to the movie's plot (and there very, very much so IS a plot here. folks).
The third viewing is even better because I am pretty much sure of Lynch's intentions now, and I can kick back and just enjoy the sheer audaciousness of so much of this thing. Not to mention the sublime performances of Watts and Harring (and the solid supporting turns by Theroux, Miller and Lynch's hand-picked ""cameo cast""--Chad Everett, Lee Grant, etc.)
Lynch wouldn't like this, but I have fast-forwarded to the segment where ""Diane Selwyn"" (the film's TRUE protagonist) wakes up, and I have watched those last minutes until the end twice now. I believe this segment of film is virtually flawless. And tremendously sad. One thing that really struck me about ""Mulholland Drive"" is that out of all of Lynch's films (save ""Elephant Man"") this one really knocks you in the solar plexus emotionally as well as leaving you with an admiration for the craft involved. This is in no small part due to Naomi Watts. History will scratch its head over why she wasn't up for the Oscar. A crucial performance--without it, I don't think the movie would have the power it virtually streamrolls to in the end.
Angelo Badalamenti's music also should have been included in the Oscar nominations. A pretty much shameful oversight; it adds immeasurably to the film's tone.

There is nothing ordinary about this film.  It has been described as a cinematic nightmare.  The ambiguity of that description should be inferred.  It has surreal echoes of Luis Buuel and 'Paris Texas'.  It has high standards of cinematography.  The cast does fine work.  Some sub-plots, and the characterisation in them, are exquisite, but they are much more satisfying in isolation than in entirety.
'Mulholland Drive' has 'made for Cannes' all over it.  The art house audience might enjoy it.  The wider audience probably emerges feeling that this is what a promising film looks like if the investors lose their nerve before the script doctors finish their job -- or that it fits in a genre of film-maker self-indulgence.  To add to challenges to the sensibilities of most moviegoers, the 'medium level sex scenes' turn out to be lesbian -- a reminder of shortcomings of the current film classification system in providing adequate consumer information.

1487372,5,B00005JKJA,"It would be hardly an exaggeration to say that half the readers of this movie's reviews have seen the movie already and are seeking answers to the many questions this movie leaves them with! And this should explain to you the main feature of this movie.
Movies have always been about presenting a plot to its viewers. The plot pretty much is what the movie is all about. Special effects and actors' performance are just tools to help present the plot, nevertheless the plot is the soul and heart of the movie. Movies provide you the plot on a silver plate along with the silverware. Hence what viewers always expect from a movie is a plot that will entertain either through provoking laughter, fear, amazement, excitement, or a mixture of all those elements.
But not Mulholland Drive! This is not your traditional movie. Viewers seeking an entertaining plot will probably be disappointed because this movie will not give you a plot. What you're given instead is a riddle! If you watch this movie with the traditional mindset mentioned above your shock will grow as you go through the movie and realize that things aren't making sense! And by the end of the movie you'll be thinking ""What... is going on!""
This movie challenges you to discover the plot! It is there. You can feel that it's there. The movie is scary to a freaky extent mostly because the plot is hidden and thus the viewers are left alone to deal with the events! You'll fear everybody! You'll fear going around every corner because you truly can't expect what might happen! This plot is not going to be fed to you like a baby. You'll have to look for it like a responsible adult!
The director won't leave you alone though. He'll give you hints and clues all across the movie. But don't expect it to be easy! The hints are smart and are indistinctly available to you even when you least expect them! Thus a number of viewers will feel great frustration by the end of the movie because they weren't able to crack the code, either because they expected the plot to be solved by the director at the end of the movie (just like all the other movies) or because they simply didn't understand the clues.
If after this long introduction you're still expecting to read a synopsis of the plot then you're still maintaining the traditional mindset of a movie watcher. What I'm trying to tell you is that you'll have to find the plot. However, since I wouldn't have bought this movie myself without getting a glimpse of what I should expect to see, I'll give you the following synopsis of what you'll see in the beginning of the movie.
The movie begins with an attempt to kill an attractive lady who seems to be rich. The attempt fails though and instead of killing the woman she's left stranded with amnesia. This woman, who will call herself Rita, breaks into the house of another lady called Betty who is seeking to become a great actress in Hollywood. Betty is very nice and takes care of Rita and helps her in her endeavor to regain the lost memory. Simultaneously, the movie shows us the story of a successful Hollywood director who is resisting Hollywood executives pressuring him into casting a lady they're suggesting for the main role of his movie. And the movie takes off from there.
I give this movie 5 stars because the idea of a hidden plot is very smart and entertaining. The best thing about it is that the entertainment doesn't end when the movie is over. You'll be left with many questions to ponder on maybe for days and you'll want to watch it again and again to make sure that you understood the plot. Buy this movie and you're guaranteed many hours of entertainment and fun. The movie is also very scary! And the fear isn't a result of cheap shots taken at you while you're not ready just like other scary movies. Instead, the fear is present throughout the whole movie even in the supposedly bright moments! It is creepy!
The movie has strong sexual content as well. The actresses are hot and beautiful, and all I can tell you about the sex scenes is that they're unforgettable! Also the acting performance is superb and it delivers the exact results the director intends of the scenes.
In the end, if you want to work your brains hard and watch an extraordinary movie, then buy this movie. If you're expecting a movie to watch and forget about once it's done then you might want to be looking somewhere else.
For those who have seen the movie and still looking for answers, feel free to email me and I'll provide you links for sites that carry the answers to all the questions.",1027641600,4,4555,4.556097560975609
1487373,1,B00005JKJA,"I, like many other people, was expecting to see something epic and amazing, full of plot.  All the ""strange"" movies of this generation end up with an amazing plot twist just when you think you understand what will happen.  Unfortunately for this movie, there was no real twist because there was no real plot.  This movie was filled to the brink with as much wierdness as possible only to be wierd.  Well, they got that down but in the process of all the strange goings on, they forgot to add in any plot twist, character development, or explanation.  Granted, I like to think about movies and what they mean, but this movie did not mean anything.  A movie is supposed to be like a book where every part has meaning to it.  I could not find 30 minutes of actual storyline in this movie, it was all pointless ""filler"" scenes.  For example, there was at least a 5 minute scene with a lady singing in spanish who never appeared in the movie prior to this scene, never appeared after, and didn't change the story in any way.  Maybe if they didn't spend so much time doing pointless scenes they could have put more time into all the idea's that were never finished.  As a side note, the acting was pretty crummy too.  And next time, leave the non-chronological plot to director Christopher Nolan (memento & following).",1027641600,7,1312,4.516949152542373

I can't even begin to explain what this movie is about because honestly I don't think David Lynch knows.  But I must say that even though I didn't understand it, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.

Not to mention that the new paradigm in DVD/Video release seems to be: Get the first copies out and THEN (when everyone owns it already) release the Special Edition. In that case, I would wait for the Special Edition, because this movie is STUNNING and I'm dying to see what they put in it!
Having read through some of the reviews, I noticed a couple things. First, it is rare and notable for a film to polarize the public as this one has...every review I've read has either LOVED or HATED it...no one thought it was just OK. That fact alone argues for it getting a second viewing from those who were not impressed the first time around.
Second, I have seen those who praise the movie point out many different aspects as contributing to its overall value(and I agree with nearly all), but I felt compelled to point out both the writing and the performance of Naomi Watts as particularly sparkling achievements. I felt as though Watts' performance was truly amazing and I am positively intrigued to see someone write about how horrible they thought the acting was...I think it was superb.
But then again...I've only seen the movie once...so perhaps everything will change! Seriously, I think this is an excellent film, though clearly not for everyone's taste...but I'd wait until you have a better DVD product to purchase.",1027468800,,1413,4.771428571428571
1487376,4,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch at times can be a confusing film maker.  He can also be a boring film maker.  However, in this movie, which I felt to be more confusing then Memento, David Lynch gives a present to the audience.  He creates a movie that will cause all those watching to spend the next few days obsessed with the film trying to determine what happened.  I came into the movie, knowing that it was going to be confusing, most of the way through the movie, I felt that I had a handle on the film.  But, Lynch throws a twist into the movie that causes intelligent movie-goers to scratch their head.  With that said, the beginning is a little slow, and the movie does take a little effort to get into, but once you are engulfed, the movie cannot go long enough.

Without giving too much away, the movie is about two lesbians with a love/hate relationship. I really can't say much more without ruining the story. One helful tip: you must read David Lynch's list of clues before watching the film. It will increase your enjoyment tremendously. This is a movie that you have to unlock. The storyline doesn't present itself in a straight forward manner. There are still some aspects of the movie that I don't understand, but the list of clues helped me to get most of it.
It may be a good idea to watch the film more than once to get it. Its unique, I doubt there is anything like it in the world, even among Lynch's other works.

1487501,5,B00005JKJA,"Although I have considered myself a movie buff since I was 12 or 13, it took until this last year to experience David Lynch, one of the most controversial directors in the history of film.  I avoided him for years because the people who seemed to like him were the kind of film-snobs I couldn't stand to be around, and I had little interest in ""artistic"" movies (artistic is OK, but weird for the sake of weird is a waste of time).  Until two months ago, when I watched ""Mulholland Drive"" for the first time.
And, wow.  W-O-W wow.
The first time I watched it - and if you really want to get something out of ""Mulholland Drive,"" you have to invest some time in it - I got the distinct impression that I was watching something great, but I felt like an outsider trying to look through a soaped-over window.  So I watched it again, and read some opinions, and talked with some people, and came to some conclusions.  What's the solution?  I don't think there is ONE right answer, but I believe mine is correct - but what's the point in spoiling the movie when I'm trying to get you to watch it on your own?
In fact, I'm not even going to do the usual plot summary, because I would either give too much away or tell it from my point of view, neither of which are fair.  It's a mystery, set in Hollywood, and Mulholland Drive plays a major role in the development of the story - that's the best one can do, and it's about what you'd get from reading the back of the box.  ""Mulholland Drive"" is meant to be experienced.
Although I can't think of any other movies to which I can compare ""MD"" (except other Lynch films I've seen since), the closest thing I can think of is the video game series ""Silent Hill"" (Now Approaching: Nerdville).  ""Silent Hill"" is incredibly confusing, full of twists, symbols, and bits and pieces of clues.  Like ""SH,"" ""MD"" is something that requires you to pay full attention to what's going on, and you have to disbelieve that which you originally thought to be true in order to have some inkling of what's happening.
Does that make a good film?  Yes, I think so, although I know many others do not.  You get out of Lynch films what you put into them: if you think about it and try to connect the dots, it's like solving a particularly hard logic problem (and yes, there IS logic here, I promise).  It's a great feeling, and you can appreciate the film all the more because of it.  If putting your brain to work is your idea of a good time (even if you don't do it every time you watch a movie), ""Mulholland Drive"" is an outstanding jigsaw puzzle of a film.

Every scene is well filmed, but watch for one moment in particular, the moment we fully realize that the director and Camilla are in love.  This scene, with the quiet jazz notes perfectly underscoring the hurt and betrayal felt by Diana, who at this very moment is thrown towards her sad destiny(making it the key dramatic moment in the script), is one of the most beautifull moments ever captured on film, period.  Note the closeup of Diana's face next to the points of light that become shapes.  This scene announces the true arrival of Naomi Watts and the films real plot.

It started out with intruiging plot lines then disintegrated into artistic babble.  I wasn't aware of this director's history prior to buying the DVD.  Had I been I would have passed.  If you are the type that can find deep meaning in a painting consisting of splatters and splashes then by all means buy this movie.

1487504,1,B00005JKJA,"As if that wasn't enough, eh? First mistake, knowing that this movie was a critical darling, most of those are way too over the average joe flick (like me) kind of guy. Second mistake was not leaving when it started.
Right from the opening credits, this movie made no sense at all, as swing dancers dance away to a mostly purple colored background. Events lead to the car crash, etc etc. (You've probably read the synopsis, I won't bore you any more than this movie does)
Watts puts on such a goofy performance in the first hour or so, and her lines are so sappy that you want to reach for the mute button. Though the idea is that the performance and lines play into Lynch's little mind bender, it is a huge turn off to the movie.
Now, the only people who will get the plot are film majors, critics, and rabid movie fans with too much time on their hands. Now if this had been written like Pulp Fiction, with witty dialogue, humorish situations (exception noted to the hitman scene), and the same jump around philosophy, it wouldn't be as bad.
But this was awful, especially the cowboy guy. No clue what I'm talking about? Same here, Lynch gives us no insight to ANY of the characters except Rita and Betty, and Adam (who looks like he is a long lost member of Weezer), though even with these characters it doesn't make sense though.

Lynch apparently employs a similar approach with his film making, as this admittedly visually appealing mish-mash of symbolism just skitters from one scene to something completely unrelated until the credits roll.
The acting is ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL. I have to stress this, as everyone else here comments on Oscar nomination performances, but trust me, the level of acting is comparable to Yankee soap operas (perhaps purposely?) and everyone just ambles about spouting vacuous lines at one another.

Period.  So quit whining.  Also, David Lynch will not do any interviews, director dialogue, nothing for his movies.  So stop complaining that there are no extras.  Enjoy the freakin' movie.
This movie is unconventional.  Yep, it is.  If you don't like thinking, go back to ""Rush Hour 2"".  But this movie will require your attention.  The movie seems very complicated at first, but after a second viewing, the plot does start to fall into place.  Again, this is Lynch, so be patient.
It's a shame this didn't get picked up as a series.  I've had about enough of shows like ""Will and Grace"" and ""Frasier"" being considered good television.
Enough of my whining.  Anyone who is a David Lynch fan (and you would probably already know this) should go to davidlynch.com.  You can pick up a DVD of his early films (well worth the money), and Eraserhead is supposed to be released any day now (although it's been on back order for months).

1487529,5,B00005JKJA,"The most complicated film of 2001, Lynch's Mulholland Dr. is brilliant, surreal, and hypnotically gripping.
Mulholland Dr. is one of the few movies that won't let you just sit down and ignore it. It involves you so utterly, and requires your attention all the way...similar to 2001's second most complicated film, Memento. Like Memento, Mulholland Dr. is a movie that assumes from the beginning that the audience is intelligent enough to get what happens. The difference between Memento and Mulholland Dr.? In Memento's case, everything is explained at the end. In Mulholland Dr., you don't get the luxury of an explanation.
The majority of the movie plays out much like a film noir. The movie is set up at the beginning with the car accident, and proceeds to play out eerily, set off by an old couple who seem so happy, it's almost chilling. The characters all seem to be somewhat cliche'd, but there is a reason for this. Then, suddenly, the movie takes an unexpected turn close to two hours into the movie, a point in the movie in which many may sit in their seats and utter one word collectively. ""HUH?""
In fact, for this last thirty minutes or so, things just seem utterly confusing. The director tries to help with some small clues (whenever he zooms in on an object, that should be a hint that that is a clue), but the majority will not figure out the brilliance of the movie, even after the credits are finished rolling. Unfortunately, there will be those that just walk out, and won't even bother thinking about it. That is a large percentage of the audience, and these people will unfortunately walk away from this movie hating it, and never knowing the utter genius of this piece of art. There will be another percentage of the audience that will love it, but never understand it. And finally, there will be that audience that will hopefully try to figure out the answers, and will get the full impact of the movie. As well, for some this movie may just simply be too weird to like - which is perfectly understandable. Like Moulin Rouge, this is an acquired taste.
Don't be afraid to check the internet after this movie. If you don't get the movie right after, remember this: YOU ARE NOT ALONE. A famous example would be Roger Ebert, who in his review hinted that he thought the entire movie was just a bunch of random images thrown together (it is not, everything fits together), yet he still loved it all the same.
Beautiful performances enhance this haunting puzzle. Laura Elena Harring has this quality to her that just seems to engross the viewer...it's hard to explain, but when she talks, it feels like she's one of those classic movie stars you see in the brilliant old film noirs. And Naomi Watts...she was just amazing. There is one part in the film when she auditions for a part in a movie, and her entire demeanor transforms, and she is suddenly an entirely different person...sure to become a classic scene.
This is a movie that requires you to rack your brain afterwards to figure out just what the hell happened in the last two and a half hours. It's even more of a mystery than Memento, because the movie won't tell you the answers. Hell, it took me forever, and I figured out some of the puzzle, but it took a trip onto the computer and the internet, before I fully understood what happened in the movie.
And when I did understand what happened in the movie, I was in awe. It's probably not going to hit you as hard as Memento, but it is equally as complex as Memento in some ways. Many have accused Memento of having no heart, and of being a movie that shows no emotion. Even though I disagree with those accusations, Mulholland Dr. is like Memento with a heart. David Lynch shows us in this movie the very heart of the human soul, and could almost be labelled a character examination, as it reveals to us the hopes, losses, and dreams of one woman in a truly gripping experience.

Chances are that most of your memories are slightly askew from what the reality was at the time. Betty/Diane came Hollywood expecting it to be everything in her dreams.

Thats why she kills her lesbian lover at beginng of the movie(the end chronologically) and it is why here memories of what happened are get so twisted until she shoots herself in the head to kill the demons inside.

1487531,5,B00005JKJA,"God I loved this movie!  David Lynch isn't for everyone.  If you want your movies to ""make sense,"" move on.  His films feel both natural and heavily stylized at the same time, and if someone doesn't care for a mildly artificial treatment of things, they will not like this movie.  Myself, I like heavy stylization if it is done well.  And in my book, Lynch does it very, very well indeed.
David Lynch is, in many ways, the last great master of surrealism.  Many of his moments seem to be tied to everyday reality, but instead reveal a different, stranger reality under girding our perceptions.  As behooves a true surrealist, this comes out in many odd and strange moments.  For instance, the two main female characters go to a club, and a woman there comes out and sings Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" . . . only, in Spanish.  Yet, we discover that she isn't singing at all, despite all the tears she engenders in our two heroines.  It is all a recording.  And at the end of the song, one of the two pulls a bizarre, square cube out of her purse, which we hadn't seen before, and which she evidently hadn't seen before, either.  That is on the micro level.  On the macro level, the film is even more surreal, but I couldn't explain that without given away a great deal of the plot.  One of the themes of the original surrealists was that truth is revealed in dreams.  And MUHOLLAND DRIVE functions not like nothing so much as a dream.
One of the things that stands out about this film is Lynch's very, very strange sense of humor.  The humor is sharp, but almost always in what would normally be considered highly inappropriate moments.  For instance, there is a very strange scene in which a character murders a person, and then tries to fake it as a suicide, but manages to botch it so badly that he ends up killing others as well.  But what is paramount in the scene is not the killing of additional individuals, but the hysterically funny way in which things keep going wrong.  Mass murders shouldn't (and, in real life, aren't), but I found myself shrieking with laughter in the entire scene, all the way up to the moment when the killer ""murders"" a vacuum cleaner.  Or when a character, suffering from amnesia, goes through her own purse in hopes of discovering who she is, encounters one thick stack of one hundred dollar bills after another.  Or, Billy Ray Cyrus, in a small part, after having had sex with another man's wife, explaining morality to the man after he has caught him with his wife.  Or (how's this for product placement), when Naomi Watts is departing for a movie audition, she calls out to ""Rita"", ""Don't drink all the Coke.""
Some have commented on how good the acting is, but I find that hard to understand.  On one level, the acting is utterly dreadful.  One example is Naomi Watts when she first comes into her aunt's apartment.  She walks about it, with this absurdly open-eyed wonderment and delight at everything that she sees.  I suspect the badness of the acting in the scene isn't her fault.  Instead, I think it is an intentional effect requested by David Lynch.  Indeed, I suspect that most of the really bad acting in the movie is more a result of the particular style demanded by Lynch than by innate inability on the part of the actors and actresses.
As the opening credits were playing, one name I noticed was ""Ann Miller,"" and I thought to myself, ""Just like the great tap dancer from the thirties and forties.""  Well, it WAS the great tap dancer from the thirties and forties!  Ann Miller was easily one of the two or three great female dancers from Hollywood's Golden Age, and it was really exciting to see her in a small role here as ""Coco,"" the manager of the apartment complex.  How marvelous that she is in this movie!  Tragically, musicals went out of style and Ann Miller's career was cut tragically short (her last major role previous to this was 1953's KISS ME KATE), when she was only 30 years old.  That was far too young to have a talent of her caliber to be cut short.",1025827200,10,4015,4.486225895316805

1487533,4,B00005JKJA,"I have to say that I was surprised that so many people were confused by this film and that no one seemed to ""get it.""
WARNING:  If you haven't seen it and don't want to ""know how it ends,"" read no further!!!
First, there is not really a plot, but the gradual revealing of an event.  Thus, the forward impetus comes not from finding out ""what happens next,"" but from the gradual revelation of reality so that initially unrelated, confusing pieces are connected to form a complete whole.
The reality is revealed in the final sequence, which begins with Diane Selwyn being driven in the car, along Mulholland drive.  Everything from that point on is reality, which is this:  A woman named Diane Selwyn comes to Hollywood to become a movie star.  She auditions for a part at the same time as another actress, Camilla Rhodes.  The director, Adam Kesher, chooses Camilla, but there is an attraction betwen Diane and Camilla and they begin a lesbian affair.  (Camilla also gets Diane small parts in her movies.)  Then, one day, Camilla breaks off this affair (""We can't do this anymore"") and Diane guesses, ""It's him, isn't it?""  Meaning that Camilla has fallen in love with Adam.  Camilla then invites Diane to a dinner party and humiliates her by announcing the marriage to her in front of everyone and also blatantly kissing another female guest.  Seeking revent, Diane meets a hitman at a diner and hires him to kill Camilla.  He shows her a blue key and tells her that he will leave the key in a prearranged location as a signal that the job has been done.  Diane finds the key and, realizing that her ex-lover is dead, is so overcome with guilt and remorse that she shoots herself to rid herself of the demons in her head.
Everything that happens before the ""final drive"" are Diane's desperate re-imaginings of what has happened, to assuage her guilt -- so things are twisted around.  Diane becomes a sweet, innocent girl, who is immediately recognized as a brilliant actress.  Whereas, in reality, at the diner with the hitman, the waitress's nametag says ""Betty,"" in the re-imaging, the waitress becomes ""Diane"" and Diane is ""Betty,"" and she is with ""Rita/Camilla,"" trying to help her, instead of with a hitman, plotting to kill her.  The money in Diane's purse at the diner becomes money in ""Rita's"" purse.  Adam's mother, Coco, becomes a friendly landlady.  And so on as people and events get twisted in Diane's mind as she is driven to suicide.  And finally, the blue key meant to signal Rita's death becomes the key to a mysterious blue box.  When Rita opens the box, both ""Betty"" and ""Rita"" disappear as Rita looks into the box and sees... Diane, in the back seat of the car, and the beginning of the ""real"" events.
Hopefully, this will help those who were confused to appreciate - and enjoy -- the film more.",1025740800,,2815,4.648484848484848

1487625,5,B00005JKJA,"Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine says it best, ""Lynch's Mulholland Drive is...a haunting, selfish masterpiece that literalizes the theory of surrealism as perpetual dream-state.""
Amazingly, Mulholland Drive was originally a pilot for an ABC TV series that never got picked up. What a series it could have been! Viewers would have been scratching their heads from week to week and still kept coming back for more. ABC deemed it too controversal, and lacked some all-around faith. It seem's the censor's are sleeping nowaday's, so it was an amazing move, considering.
Mulholland star's: Naomi Watts, Laura Harring and Justin Theroux. All of whom were terrific. There were some scenes, such as ""The introduction to Adam"", and ""The Audition"" that would have alone been worth buying the disk. To me anyways.
Remember that most of what you see has a symbolism around things that happen in the ending subplot. This won't make sense until you have seen it. Flak Magazine does a wonderful job decifering all of the in's and out's. If you want a full fledged, interpretation, go there. Even though I understood most of the movie, after I read his review it made me feel a little stupid.
Mulholland Dr. is a rare, crazy-eyed vision of a woman's life, her desires and her failures. It was meant for open minded viewers who enjoy simple movies as much as the do complicated film's. ~s.a.o.s.~",1025568000,2,1376,4.909871244635193
1487626,3,B00005JKJA,"This movie is about a suicidal, schizophrenic lesbian who has issues with her parents and is looking for love in all the wrong places. I wanted to like this movie, and in a way I did, but there just wasn't enough substance for me to call it a favorite. Lynch would sort of touch on some very powerful themes but wouldn't delve deeply enough into any one thing build meaning.

The fact that there are no sub chapters was really annoying but I guess that's Lynch's way of being artistic.
That being said, the performances were superb but it wasn't enough to save the film.
The only people who will like this movie are those who create meaning where it is lacking.",1025568000,,661,4.418032786885246

With no chapters, fast forward from the start was the only choice in reaching the point I stopped. Had I wanted a tape, I would have bought a tape. Result? Threw the DVD in the garbage, film concidered uninteresting. I won't buy any other Universal DVD's either, if they really don't know the difference between the DVD and tape format. I'll stick to companies that do.",1025568000,7,486,4.586206896551724
1487628,3,B00005JKJA,"Director Lynch is very good at making his audience think about the storyline and his characters.  During my earlier young adult years I was completely enthralled by his work especially the TV series ""Twin Peaks"".  Well, for this movie that was originally intended for television, we have a movie that definitely makes you think.
Salon.com has disected this movie to help people understand this film.  Other Websites especially college professors have done the same.  In other words, if you are buying this DVD to think that you are going to watch the ""usual"" type of movie and understand the storyline, well...""Mulholland Drive"" is not that kind of movie.
As a matter of fact, I have watched it three times, read the websites and now I have a much better appreciation for this film.  You CAN NOT watch this film and think of it as a usual film and that everything is comprehendible.
This movie is about dream and reality and it is up to you to piece together what is dream and what is reality and in the end find out what led to the final scene.  Of course, to help confuse you is the typical Lynch style of things that is tiny old people, a sort of ""pandora's box"", a blue key and a cowboy that makes you want to say...""eh?""
That said, some will enjoy it, some won't.  I on the otherhand think I do...and at the same time I think I don't.  That's the effect this movie has on you....it will stick in your head.  Silencio.
Now for the DVD, this is where I score things down.  Lack of special features on a DVD is bad but when there are no chapter tracks on the DVD, that makes it worse.  You literally have to use your goto button and type in the time to get to a certain scene or be patient and use fast forward or fast rewind.  These two (which I call ""flaws"") of the DVD is unacceptable.  This movie deserves much more...and I'm hoping that perhaps a special edition will come out because there are some interesting interviews that Lynch has done for this movie.
Last, there are two different covers for the DVD.  To my knowledge, there is no difference...just the covers.
That being said, I enjoyed the movie but the DVD deserved better.",1025395200,6,2141,4.442455242966752
1487629,2,B00005JKJA,"I don't usually review movies, but I feel so strongly about this movie that I thought I'd make it an exception.  The only reason it gets two stars is because the first hour or so is very interesting.  There are several seemingly unconnected scenes, and as the movie progresses you discover, somewhat, how they are connected.  I kept watching because I wanted to find out what the explanation would be for all the weird things that were happening.  For example, there's a guy who (I think) dies of a heart attack after seeing a horrible man he thought existed only in his dreams.  There's weird movie politics involving a director who's being forced to cast a certain woman as the lead in his movie.  There's the main plot thread (or at least I consider it the main one) involving Betty and Rita.  Rita got into a car accident, can't remember who she is, and has a ton of money and a strange key in her purse.  Then there are all the countless other strange details in the movie, all of which kept me interested.
Unfortunately, all this buildup leads only more confusion.  This movie is an English teacher's dream.  I'm sure it's possible to come up with countless interpretations of what actually was going on.  However, I only ended up feeling betrayed by the creators of this movie.  It's like they knew what was going on, but decided it would be funny to only hint at it for the audience.  I was expecting things to start making sense, and I guess I was expecting too much.",1025222400,14,1476,4.503759398496241
1487630,5,B00005JKJA,"This is one of the smartest movies I have ever seen.  And one reason that I love it so much is because after piecing all of it together, it make sense.  You have to watch for every detail in the story and listen to every word spoken because clues are revealed sotto vocce.  A story about dreams of becomming great and what happens when thoughs dreams fall short.  It is stunning, sexxy and smart.  This is one of my all time favorites",1025136000,2,434,4.2439024390243905
1487631,4,B00005JKJA,"I had no idea what I was in for.  I knew from talking to a bunch of people that this was a movie that I was not going to get, no matter how many times I would watch it.  That alone caught my curriousity.  I like movies that make me think.  I like to be tricked, confused, surprised, shocked, disgusted, and so on.  So, I decided to give it a try.  I will say this, ""Mulholland Drive"" is a very original film that kept my attention from the word ""go.""
I admit, I had no idea what the hell I had just witnessed after this movie was over.  There are no chapter stops, so I couldn't watch certain parts over again without rewatching the whole movie again.  I didn't know if I liked it at the time, but I was pretty sure that I didn't hate it.  I was just...puzzled.
I have to thank a reviewer on this site, I forget the person's name, because the reviewer pretty much explained what happened, and it also made me feel good that it was pretty darn close to my theory.  I don't know if it's the exact and right answer, but when I rewatched it, it all fit in.  It was so simple...it was confusing.  I think that's what did it for me and made me appreciate the film more than I did the previous viewing.
I'm not going to go into detail about the story; that's something you're going to have to see for yourself.  It'd runin the movie if I did.  Besides, I wouldn't do it justice if I tried to explain it.  Here are some of the elements to the story; a girl with no memory, another girl who wants to be a star, a club, an accident, a load of money, some kind of thing that lives behind a fast food joint, and a little box.
I really liked how this film was shot and directed.  I have never seen a David Lynch film, so this would be my first one.  The score was also very haunting, as well as the overall product of the movie.  The movie is haunting, dark, and colorful at the same time.  This is a movie that will mess with your head though.  Maybe that's why I didn't get it the first time; because I was trying too hard.
As far as special features, there really aren't any, except for the trailer.  Would've been nice to have chapter stops.  This is the perfect movie that they could've really added some neat features and Easter Eggs.  So, be aware of that.
All in all, a very good and challenging film that requires all of your brain power.  Because of it's orinality, I'm sure that this is going to be one that many people may not like or get.  I'm not even going to try to convince you to see this movie.  You're on your own.  At first I thought it was an okay film, but after seeing it again and able to put the pieces together, I realized that ""Mullholand Drive,"" is a well-structured film that takes chances without fear.  I don't think it's the best film of the year, but I think it's on the list.  Bound to be a classic, if not already.",1025049600,4,2837,4.098003629764065
1487632,4,B00005JKJA,"My main problem with the DVD is the fact that it has NO CHAPTER SELECTIONS. I don't just mean that there are no thumbnails in the menu that let you pick specific scenes visually - I mean that the whole movie is just one long track, so if you hit ""Previous"" you'll go all the way back to the start of the film, and if you hit ""Next"" you'll go all the way to the end. This actually makes it worse than a VHS tape because in order to see a prior scene without starting the entire film over, you just have to sit there holding down ""rewind."" (On my DVD player anyway.) This really [stinks]. But maybe it was just some purposeful arty decision, to force people to watch it continuously and not be able to instantly refer back.
This film would frustrate enough people regardless. Personally I'll wait for the ""Collector's Edition"" with tracks and a nice weird director commentary.",1025049600,,874,4.401234567901234
1487633,4,B00005JKJA,"Maybe I need to see this a few more times but in no way does this film add up to a logical plot that we can comprehend and draw concrete conclusions with by it's end in my humble opinion, perhaps I need to see it again or perhaps some other critics are too pretentious to admit they have been stumped. The films seems to me, to be a collection of dreams and/or aspirations and/or fantasies about a want to be or would be actress played well by the beautiful English born actress Naomi Watts. It may be traveling deep into ""Diane's"" mind and she pictures herself as ""Betty"", a quirky and innocent aspiring actress. If this synopsis is what director David Lynch intended (I will not make believe I know this enigmatic man's intentions) then we are seeing a brutally honest depiction of a women's mind; her pride, her shame, her sexuality, her fears and her insecurities. Even if that were true, Lynch would still give us many questions to ask ourselves, such as what is with the behind the scenes midget in the wheelchair, the Cowboy, the Gangsters who force Adam the Director to choose a certain actress, the cheerfully frightening elderly couple that shrinks, the scary dumpster hobo guy, that sad lady on stage singing Orbinson's ""Crying"" in Spanish, that strange blue box and the two various blue keys? My answer would be elaborate oddities and specific bizarre details in this women's (Diane) subconscious that seems to freely float about as if in a dreamlike state during a crucial time in her life, the time where she must decide to establish the path she will choose to take for the rest of her life. The anxiety of this stage is something I think we can all relate to. I don't want to rant on and on like I did with Lynch's Blue Velvet but there is even more to analyze here than in any other film I have ever seen. Lynch's intention may not be to compel us of any reasonable statements, but to tickle our subconscious and provoke us to read as far into his riddles as we possibly can. As always it is a welcome challenge to me and David Lynch is truly as brilliant a Director as there is in Hollywood today.
Technically, the film is very well done. The DVD resolution compliments the plush colors and amazing soundtrack and the cast adheres well with Lynch's love for extreme characters, particularly Watts. I have not yet completely given up chasing any concrete holistic messages that Lynch may be trying to offer us after viewing the film several times. My conclusion to this point is that it doesn't matter, this is a film that collects scenes that make us feel our way to indescribable logic that is beyond words rather than pinpoint a clear definition of what is really going on...but I will be watching it again to try to find out.

1487634,3,B00005JKJA,"I know, a lot of people think this is a really great movie, but I just couldn't buy into it. I liked ""Twin Peaks"" a lot, but mostly Lynch's stuff leaves me cold. Too often, he just seems to be doing weirdness for weirdness' sake... leading the audience around by the nose, only to have the nose disappear at the end. The production is nice, in a moody way, and Laura Harring is certainly gorgeous, but that's not enough to salvage the movie. In the end, you don't know what really happened ... and you don't care.
Shortly after watching this, I watched ""Vanilla Sky,"" which is similar in some ways, but a much better movie in my opinion. I'm giving this one 3 stars for originality and high-grade production, but its structural flaws preculde rating it higher.",1024963200,,760,4.5144927536231885
1487725,4,B00005JKJA,"Yes, it was hard to understand but I couldn't stop watching it --which is quite an achievement on Lynch's part, when you consider some of the difficulties here:
- the wrenching change in the story line,
- segments which make sense only after the film is over, or which seem to have been transplanted wholesale from a different film altogether, and
- the confusing dual identities of the two female leads.
All this is more than balanced by many fascinating (albeit puzzling and disjointed) scenes, much gorgeous imagery, and the sheer curiosity factor -- what does it all mean? Males in the audience are also well-rewarded by the classic beauty of Laura Harring, who like Helen of Troy possesses a face that could launch a thousand ships.
Was this really a legitimate effort at filmmaking? Or was it just an attempt to salvage something -- anything -- out of the rejected pilot, beefed up with some extra footage shot later, including a scorching lesbian love scene? I suppose I don't much care. But for those who do, see [...] (Entertainment Weekly's website) for one person's interesting and plausible explanation of the story line, some of which seems to have been arrived at by at least one contributor here.

It's hard to believe this scatological piece of so-called film noir came from the same man who made ERASERHEAD, THE ELEPHANT MAN, BLUE VELVET, WILD AT HEART, and THE STRAIGHT STORY. David Lynch has ultimately lost his edge when it comes to translating his nightmarish perception of reality. The slow paranoid timing, brooding music, and geek show symbolism is becoming self-indulgent and pretentious. Not to mention boring. That's right all you Lyncheads.....Boooorrrrriinnnggg. Just because it's paint splatters on a canvas doesn't make it great art.

Robert Ebert says this is one of the best movies of the year and he still doesn't know what it means. What does that say about what he and other critics value about film as art? Should we immmediately elevate this film to importance because everyone says you have to see it twice to understand it? Because Roger Ebert and the other pseudo intelligentsia tell us how brilliant it is? Something about a dual identity? Who cares? The journey was tedious and full of holes. Yes, sometimes great art is not understood the first time and should be viewed again and reassessed. But I was squirming in my seat the first time. I'd rather have root canal than sit through this mess again. Yes, sometimes great art doesn't even have to have meaning.(and I assure you this film is meaningless) But for God's sake at least make it interesting. Watching this film was like watching paint dry. At times it was like watching a really bad television program. Twin Peaks it's not. I don't mind being challenged by convoluted writing, but I know when I'm being mentally masturbated.
David Lynch is not a good writer and needs to start optioning projects from The Writer's Guild. Discuss this in the coffee house amongst yourselves. Me......I'd rather watch L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, again. Or.... THE MAN WHO WASN""T THERE, again. If you like stylishly bizarre film noir, see that instead. It's far superior. The Coen Brothers do David Lynch better than Lynch, who is quickly becoming a parody of himself. If you're reading this you're probably a Lynchead and pressing the NO button by now. But don't be fooled. The Emperor has no clothes. It's blaringly obvious that this man's vision is puerile.
I can see why this was scrapped as a Television Series. If Television Executives can smell the stink when the Movie Critics can't; head for the shelters you sheep, the world is coming to an end.
David Lynch died with punk rock. He's over. Lynch, I wasted 2 and half hours of my life and I want 'em back!! I'm tired of looking inside your head. It's empty. It's time to fill it up with something new.

THis movie was a pretty good movie, if you know what to ignore.  There are plenty of scenes in this movie that you could take completely out, and it would have no effect at all.  Why?  Because many of the scenes are thrown in there, for apparently no reason.
Yes, I got the point of the movie.  But some of the dots do not connect, and a lot of people try to act smart by saying they love this movie.  By saying you love a movie with some parts that made no sense, some people might be ""What a smart person, they got it and I didn't.""  Well, that's pretty much what it comes down to with Lynch and his fans.  I know a lot of what it is symbolism and illusion.  But it's just not needed.
Some of the stuff that gets thrown into this movie would be like randomly throwing some paint on a finished, very well made portrait.  It only hurts it and it would have been better if left out.  Which is why this movie only gets 2 stars.",1024876800,16,985,4.005128205128205
1487728,4,B00005JKJA,"It's important to note that if this review were based on the movie alone, I'd have given it five stars. I only gave it four stars for one reason: the DVD is a little bare. Perhaps it's because I've've been spoiled by double DVDs with numerous special features, but the lack of special features is a little disappointing. With that said, I still would have given it five stars if that was the only problem. My biggest problem with the DVD is the lack of chapter selection. I'm sure that David Lynch did this for a reason, but it is a step backward towards the days of VHS, and can become quite a pain when you want to view one particular scene, especially with a complex movie like this that challenges the viewer to think.
As for the movie itself, I felt that it was absolutely brilliant. I love David Lynch, and I think that this is some of his best work. (You'll have to excuse my brevity, as I'll let the movie speak for itself and I don't want to ruin somebody's experience) The acting is superb. In my opinion, Naomi Watts had the best performance of the year. Lynch is in top form; as always, he does a great job of combining symbols with outstanding camera work that allows you to see what he wants you to without beating you over the head with it. The story is complex, yet a very intriguing riddle. It will most likely require multiple viewings to fully understand and appreciate this film, but it's well worth it; each viewing is as enjoyable as the last (possibly more so). That is the magic gift that David Lynch gives; his films either retain their original interest or increase it upon repeat viewings. This film is a masterpiece, and I recommend that Lynch fans and non-Lynch fans alike buy this DVD.

It's really not that complicated, you must pay careful attention and you can will understand it too. Most of the film is simple enough until the two main characters open up the blue box. After this point in the film carefully watch it. Most of it towards th end is basically flashblacks and it jumps around somewhat. Just follow it careful and you will understand why this film has been so highly acclaimed as it has been. Once you figured it all out, you will see how a tragic and sad tale it all was.

don't be fooled by other reviews claiming this is some sorta artistic masterpiece with deep provoking ideas and groundbreaking vision that can't be fully comprehended by us normal folks. the truth is that this movie can't be and will probably never be understood by anyone including lynch himself.

1487734,5,B00005JKJA,"My first impression when watching the film:  I started asking myself ""What the heck?"" one hour into the film, and there's still no conflict, no action, no sex, nothing?  What's going on?  Then when the movie ended, I screamed ""Huh???""  ""What???""
The next phase of my epiphany came when I realized I wasn't the only one who ""didn't get it"".  So I went to therapy.  Just kidding.  But I did find some help.
I really enjoyed this movie only after reading countless reviews online, and watching the last half hour of the movie again.  It makes perfect sense to me now.  The important things to keep in mind are the main components of the story and to understand the time line.  The whole movie movie can be categorized into: the fantasy (first 2 hours), the ""real time"" and ""real life"" story,  and flashbacks in real life (interspersed scenes in the last half hour).  The ""real time"" story of Diane Selwyn's life is only five minutes long.  This ""real time"" story comprises the scenes: when she is woken up by her neighbor's knocking, lets her grab her stuff and sees the blue key (whereupon she realizes she had done something really bad), to her being haunted by the old man and woman and the fateful ending.  Once these puzzles made sense to me, I realized how wonderfully made this movie really is.  It's clever and brilliant.
I must admit that the movie is pretty convoluted.  Diane takes elements from her real life and constructs this incredible fantasy in her mind where she comes out on top; where she makes it in hollywood and even gets the girl ;) (<hint hint wink wink>).  Some characters in her fantasy I could find no purpose to except to further interest/entice/enrage certain characters within the fantasy.  The DVD version of the movie I watched contains a Clue Sheet with clues that'll help you unravel the mystery.  It's not very helpful unless you understand what I explained in the previous paragraph.  But once you ""get it"", the clues cause you to say ""Wow!""
On a different note, I enjoyed a song in the movie by Rebekah Del Rio called Lloranda (which means ""crying"" in Spanish).  The viewer will also notice that there is no scene selection on the DVD's menu.  This is intentional, along with the blurring of certain scenes and lack of other special features.  It's David Lynch's way of telling us that ""This is my film, I can do what I want with it.  Respect that.""  To me, the movie IS the special feature.
LEAP rating (each out of 5):

E (Erotica) - 5 (i've never given such a high rating for a movie shown in theaters, so that tells you something)
A (Action) - 1 (the hitman scene in the fantasy is hilarious)
P (Plot) - 5 (confusing when unexplained, but very clever when understood)

1487826,1,B00005JKJA,"Complete disappointment! Did not live up to the hype or praise. All these reviewers interpretating the meaning of this annoying piece are only accomplishing one thing: killing unnecessary brain cells. David Lynch's style of direction is mediocre at best and I feel I am being very generous. He accomplished one thing though: CONFUSION. Viewers who claim they perfectly understand this movie are kidding themselves. The movie is intentionally not meant to be understood. Each person that watches this garbage develops his or her own believing of what message this movie is conveying. Sadly, you are probably all wrong and David Lynch is secretly laughing at the audience. I believe he himself could not explain to you what is really going on, but that is what he wants. David Lynch has got a cult of viewers who are brainwashed into his heap.  The acting was not very convincing and the movie did not grip me at all. I never felt mystery or anxiousness of trying to figure it out. I had a hard enough time avoid looking at my watch. The premise of a dream or fantasy as a plot could be very interesting but Lynch fails to execute. As I was watching, I could not help to wonder; what is the big deal? I found most of the scenes to be quite boring along with the numb characters. I did not feel the controversy. This movie is very, very, very, overrated!! To anyone who has not seen it, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. Believe all the hype and you most certainly will finish this film and feel betrayed.",1023926400,22,1517,4.597785977859779

That is why I recommend owning this DVD.  You need to watch it more than once, twice, or even three times to catch every last puzzle piece to put the mystery together.  It's beautifully directed, the props and sets are constructed in a way that every article in each scene has its own place and importance, as well as great performances by the two leads.  Lynch's storytelling goes beyond the conventional Hollywood structure, and in Mulholland Drive he's in top form.  If you like challenging films that cause you to think, MD is for you.  Don't get this DVD for the special features - there are none.  Get it, because it's a film you'll want to watch over and over.  Highly recommend.",1023926400,,827,4.571428571428571
1487829,5,B00005JKJA,"Just know what you're getting into when you purchase ANY David Lynch film on DVD... the man himself is kinda spiteful toward the format for one very interesting reason: he feels that his films (or any film for that matter) should be seen from beginning to end in one continuous viewing without breaks and without the chance to jump from scene to scene.  When you view a Lynch film you're in his world, like it or not (and if not, then why did you bother in the first place?  Go rent or buy some Jerry Bruckheimer garbage and get your cinematic kicks that way).
Lynch is not into commentaries, so you won't find any (however, The new ""Blue Velvet"" special edition disc is as loaded as any Lynch DVD gets, but he still won't sit for a commentary track, so don't hold your breath that there will be one for the ""Eraserhead"" DVD).  Other than that, suffice to say, Lynch's film as deeply disturbing as most of his work (save for ""The Straight Story"" which is a wonderful film from a different side of the Lynch spectrum) and very tragic (in my opinion, one of the most tragic ""love stories"" I've ever seen).  The DVD is of excellent quality both visually and aurally, and aside from anticipated extras that never materialize on any of his DVD's (again, except for the new Blue Velvet disc), this is totally worth owning, especially if you're a David Lynch fan.",1023840000,3,1356,4.5

I wouldn't recommend it to folks who enjoy stories with a straighforward story and rhythmic plot.  This movie can be confusing, but it sticks with you once you have seen it.  Even now I can see some of the scenes in vivid detail.  I can't remember what radio show I heard this on, but because of the somewhat graphic love scenes between the two women, the men on the radio show called it a man's wet dream movie.  I don't think they understood much of the movie but at least if you are a guy and your girl wants to watch it you have that to look forward to!",1023840000,,709,4.0647482014388485

The movie constantly tells you what is happening to the ""movie"" itself but NOT the events happening INSIDE the movie.  Events like the car accident, the killing, and all the things happening all over the town HAVE NOTHING to do with the events themselves.  For example, Adam is asked to go see the ""Cowboy"".  The Cowboy tells Adam that ""If you do good, you will see me one time. If you do bad, you will see me two times.""  If you think that the Cowboy is talking about the movie Adam is making, you are totally wrong.  The Cowboy is telling YOU that if you do good, you will only have to see this movie one time to understand it.  Things like this happen all over the first part of the movie.  In the very beginning, the ""movie"" even tells you that there are TWO STORIES within this ""movie"" (notice that everything is in a pair throughout the movie - a pair of dancers, two limo drivers, two old couples, two detectives, etc).

Lynch reminds me of a child playing around with concepts he doesn't fully understand. He's all into how 'cool' it is, but he loses sight of the overall message he's sending.
The exploration of the human mind is a topic filmmakers have been treating since the earliest days of film, but the message of this movie is: life sucks, then you die an ugly death. Well, maybe that's the way life is for Lynch, but not for me!
If you are a film buff you will want to see this film for it's cinematic properties, and if you are one of those people who get off on watching other people go down the tubes, you should enjoy this one.
I just found it ridiculous. What's the point of watching a film where somebody goes nuts and dies? Don't we see enough of that crap on the TV every day?  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think Lynch's great film technique is enough to sit through a bummer movie like Mulholland Drive.
Naomi Watts does put in a great performance as the confused woman who goes psychotic.
I gave this movie 3 stars anyway for it's inventive use of the camera, but I really want to give it 0 stars for it's overall message.

1487833,1,B00005JKJA,"I truly love thought-provoking movies which tell stories in an unusual style.  Some of my favorite movies entail plots presented out of sequence and part of my pleasure comes from piecing it all together.  Having said that, after one viewing, I was extremely disappointed with this film.  Although Naomi Watts delivered a mind boggling performance, Lynch's disconnected storytelling left too many unfilled holes.
There were obviously times where the film moved back and forth from reality to fantasy (duh) but what's the point.  The film started out strong and immediately pulled me into the seedy Los Angeles movieworld.  What disturbed me most were the various subplots and additional characters that never went anywhere.  Its as if Lynch shot some scenes from completely unrelated scripts and incorporated them into an otherwise interesting story.  As an avid moviegoer and lover of the medium, it annoys me when these filmmakers create products which claim to have artistic value when in reality, they themselves have no clue what they are doing.  This movie provides viewers with shock value purely for the sake of shock.  I have never felt so unsatisfied when the final credits rolled in my life.
I know this movie has gotten a lot of attention and I truly hope that other filmmakers do not follow with similarly annoying and disconnected projects which may or may not have some deep underlying message.  If that is the case then I should grab my camera and shoot some random scenes together and try to get someone to distribute my film.  ... I personally think that filmmakers like Lynch like to throw things our there into the public just to see how many different ... interpretations people can come up with, when in reality he knows he is just messing with us.  I end my review by saying this:  if you want to be thoroughly annoyed and unsatisfied then you should watch this movie.  If you want to see some hot lesbian scenes then you should rent this movie ...  And finally, who knows, maybe I will feel differently after watching it three more times.

However, this movie took me on a twisted trip that never ended.  The movie was like two separate films in one...joined by a common cast but fragmented in every other way.  Strong performances by the lead actresses did little to hide the weak plot that was thinly hidden amongst a barrage of twists and turns that aimed to keep you wondering what was going on so that you wouldn't realized that in actuality, nothing was going on.  David Lynch's brilliant mind for movies has edged further from the realm of reality and close to insanity in this film.

1487835,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch has thoroughly, repeatedly, and effortlessly confused us time and time again throughout the years.
He has occasionally stopped along to let us glimpse at the ""normal"" dementia of humanity(""The Elephant Man"") and touching hope of the American Spirit(""The Straight Story"")...
He's also turned on a dime, unfairly invading our minds, haunting our dreams, and perhaps given us something to think about besides our own drab, little world.
""Mulholland Drive"" stands to be one that will invade your mind and haunt your dreams. Have no delusions...everything you have heard about this film is TRUE. You won't be able to figure it out upon first viewing. The sexual relationship between Betty and Rita won't make sense. The Cowboy will be an enigma with no handles to grasp onto. Club Silencio will be a familiar place...you couldn't have seen it before, right?
It will shock you and frighten you. It will leave you breathless and frustrated. It will make you think about it long after it's done and then even longer than that.
""Mulholland Drive"" is well worth the 2+-hour running time. It's many different things about one thing: the attempt to live what we wished was true; the attempt to escape our lives, our guilt, and our vices through dreams. David Lynch covered this ground before in ""Lost Highway"", just not as obvious as this film. In ""Lost Highway"", we were given the story of a man trapped in a circular hell.
In ""Drive"", we are given the story of two girls attempting to solve a mystery, when in reality, they're trying to find themselves. Something is happening with them...something much bigger than they realize.
David Lynch weaves a tale of mystery, suspence, lust, and terror in a masterpiece that is both an anti-love-letter to Hollywood and an underrated epic of enigmatic film-making. Lynch's best film to date as well as one of the best films of 2001.
Powerful performances by Laura Harring and Naomi Watts as Rita and Betty and a wonderful comeback-cameo for Chad Everett as a sleazy old actor. A triumph of set and sound design also help make this film an instant noir-classic.

1488071,3,B00005JKJA,"June 10, 2002
`Mulholland Drive' is David Lynch's sad and horrendous
valentine to Hollywood myth and the young women without
number sacrificed in body and soul to keep it going.
It is a gaudy but somehow still sentimental tour of
Hellish La-La Land.  Like many of his other films,
`Muholland Drive' is both simultaneously enraptured and
disgusted by its subjects, lending the finished project
Lynch's trademark perversity.
An interpretations of the film's narrative is pointless.
I don't know which characters, or incarnations of
characters, or simulations of characters, are meant to
be extant.  In the end, it hardly matters.  They are
manifestations, not people.  Best know that going in.
More problematic is Lynch's need to stray from his main
narrative, his worst habit as a filmmaker, since his
comic deviations are often more enjoyable than the main
action of the film.  As is the case here.  Some of the
subplots included here, those belonging to the characters
of the Director and the Dimwitted Hit Man, are great fun,
but they vary greatly in tone from the central story
involving the two main female leads.  This is especially
damaging in the opening hour of the film, before the
women's tale has become properly engaging.  An unwise
move in a film this long.
There is no rating to give a David Lynch film other
than a rating dead in the middle.  To some he is
unwatchable, to others untouchable, so best split the
difference.  If you haven't seen `Lost Highway' or `Blue
Velvet' or any of his other works, there's no point in my
trying to figure out for you whether or not you'd like
them.
Heck, I don't even know if I like them or not.  But
they're usually worth a look.",1023667200,2,1683,4.74914089347079

However this film did NOT impress me at all, it was hyped up to be something it wasnt.
This simply was not a good movie.

1488073,1,B00005JKJA,"This movie does exactly what I believe Lynch wanted to do...make an unsolvable puzzle. The movie is filled with too many loose ends for any reasonable interpretation to be the true. Much like some contemporary artists, Lynch is seeking to elicit responses from his audience, rather than convey a message. While such an objective is fine, unfortunately our scholars cannot allow for such a goal. Since they believe everything has a meaning, they will endeavor to find it. Then, they explain the ""great answer"" that they have found to all of us.
My personal reaction to the movie is negative. The movie did not seem well-made technically. Most importantly, the movie failed to draw me and didn't elicit much of a response from me.",1023580800,3,728,4.879032258064516

People who only liked to be considered as consumers, just go to the current blockbusters, and thought ""The Sixth Sense"" was too mind baffling will be confused out of their mind while watching ""Mulholland Drive"".
It is reminiscent of the old 50's Hollywood. The main characters are Betty, an aspiring actress, Rita, an amnesiac who enlists the aid of Betty, and Adam, a director who is being forced to choose the star of his next film. The movie plays, pull strings and goes beyond the premise of the characters' situations. Personally, I think David Lynch revels in toying with moviegoers as they try to piece together this puzzle of a movie where pieces were never meant to fit into a complete picture. As Roger Ebert said, it's not like ""Memento"" where if you follow closely you can solve it, just enjoy each scene for what it is.

1488075,4,B00005JKJA,"I could not wait for this to come out on DVD!  Be advised, I am writing this review after only ONE viewing... I think that is the fair way to go about it.
First of all, DVD quality:  Picture - 3.0, Sound - 4.0.
I cannot believe that a new film would not have a better picture unless it was filmed to look dirty and grainy.  The sound is pretty good.  Most of the soundtrack is classic David Lynch low rumbling and machinery-type noises.  If you have good bass speakers, you will hear this throughout.  I enjoyed the effect as it brought to mind ""Blue Velvet"".  Low background sounds were not used constantly in ""Blue Velvet"" -- so in this movie it might become irritating to some.  Just viewing on a normal TV you will probably not hear anything besides the dialogue and music.  Music is used with humor.
NOTICE:  This DVD comes with two separate covers!  The more popular cover depicts Laura Harring as a blonde but it contains an insert with the Naomi Watts picture.  The other DVD case cover is Naomi Watts with, hopefully, the Laura Harring photo.  I deliberated in the store for quite a while and opted to buy the popular cover, so I was relieved to find the Watts picture within.
ALSO:  For whatever reason, this DVD is one long, 147-minute single chapter.  If you like flicking around, you won't be able to do it.  My DVD software players can search and go to time indexes, so when I took a break and came back to the movie I just had to drag the index to the approximate time where I left off.  Make sure that you can do this otherwise you'll be stuck watching from beginning to end.
Usually I do not comment on plot points or acting and prefer to write about the technical aspects of the DVD.  That said, if you are a David Lynch fan you will love this movie.  I don't think the movie ""gets inside my head and stays there"" as written by Vogue.  I know I will view it several times in the immediate future.  There are two love scenes in the movie that far-and-away are my favorite parts.  Naomi Watts is very pert and energetic, plus good-looking as a petite female.  Harring is a much larger woman so it is extremely sensual to see Watts submit to her, if you interpret it that way.
Included on the insert are 10 clues to help viewing this movie.  I ignored them for my first viewing and will eventually get around to employing them for subsequent viewings.  Indeed, searching for or noticing these clues brings a very intellectual element to watching ""Mulholland Drive"".

I waited for the movie to begin...

When I could do that no longer, I then just waited for the credits to roll.
Those who claim that this movie is for film buffs and aficionados of cinema only say so to grasp a false sense of superiority over those normal and sane individuals that see this movie for what it is: garbage.

""Mullholand Drive"" is a very beautiful and musical film. My appreciation is of the gestalt of the picture, characters and plot lines are vague and get blurred. ""Mullholand Drive"" really becomes an impressionistic work of emotion and imagery, with a crescendo of editing at the end that takes the senses elegantly from the bowels of fear out into a sad and mysterious light. The film has other important nuances, dealing with Lynch's on going obsessions, the music and styles of his youth (Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" sung in Spanish, the swing dancing that opens the film), mystical and odd characters (the cowboy, the burned man behind the wall), and seductive women. It is also a film about acting, and about how actors control our emotions and our sense, and how easily we fall under the spell of their illusional reality. For example, I would like to bring your attention to the uncomfortable casting scene where the young woman must share an intimate moment with the older man with orange skin. As they get into character, the camera completely looses the context of the scene, and for a moment we a transported into watching a different movie. This happens at other points during the film, but that scene immediately leapt to mind.

The self-destructive insecurities at the heart of the Hollywood 'dream' are the subject this time, and Lynch dissects them with a chilling precision - which probably accounts for the ludicrous lack of Oscars.  But I suppose in a year in which the hallowed Academy also saw fit to ignore 'Memento', what else could we expect?  Lynch is easily the most original and consistently interesting director working in America today.  You owe it to yourself to see this film and discover just how different and challenging a movie can be.  Don't be daunted by the phalanx of reviewers who deplore its impenetrability.

1488189,5,B00005JKJA,"This movie was not intended to be shown in one sitting.  Originally conceived as a television drama (much like Twin Peaks), it only became a film when it was not picked up for a television market.  David Lynch then re-imagined what he had already created and worked to fashion a film, seeking foreign producers and a distributor that trusted him.  While this short history of the genesis of the film does not explain its intricacies, perhaps it will help to soothe the frustrations of someone watching the film for the first time.  Can you imagine trying to piece together the entire history of the X-Files in one 3 hour sitting?  It would be difficult at best.
In my opinion, one big clue to the movie is in the opening shot (not the beginning credits, but the first ""film"" frame).  It is of a pillow and a sheet...that quickly dissolves into a rather nostalgic ride down Mulholland Drive (the road that runs behind the famous HOLLYWOOD sign).  The movie does not return the viewer to that shot ... of the pillow again until Diane wakes up nearly 5/8's of the way through the film.  It can be assumed that this whole portion of the film has been one long dream, a dream that gives us a great deal of insight into the personal desires and fantasies of Diane.  The rest of the film is a mish-mash of (in my opinion) drug-induced daydreams and paranoia, seen through the beer-bottle goggles of Diane.  She over-emphasizes the importance of things she is suspicious of, and sees things that are not really there--ultimately leading to her making some bad decisions that she cannot deal with.
Several characters appear in both worlds (the dream, and the warped/drug altered reality of the end).  These characters, we assume, have had some kind of impact on Diane's life.  Her fantasy/inner vision of the characters is seen in her dream, the somewhat-subjective reality of them revealed only in the latter part of the film.  There are really only two characters that are enigmas: the person behind the diner, and the cowboy.  In my opinion, the person behind the diner represents a drug dealer (making things happen) whom Diane buys from (who controls Pandora's box).  The cowboy, to me, represents the simple, logical, American person that Diane hopes is out there, striving to right the wrongs of LA.
The dream sequence is Diane's subconscious exploring her feelings for the people and places in her life, and rewriting her experiences in a version she likes better (she is an amazing actress, who is only deterred from certain stardom because of a conspiracy, and who loves someone that would love her fully too, if only she really knew who she was).  When she wakes up, she must then come to terms with her life, and muddle through the confusing haze of people and relationships in her life within LA culture...confusing matters incredibly with her drug/fantasy/day dream visions.
The movie is a masterpiece of writing, direction, cinematography, and ultimately conviction to telling an unconventional story...Lynch, Herring, Watts and others never waver in their commitment to the story...even when it gets scary, erotic, or convoluted.  The result is an incredibly entertaining and though-provoking experience that will leave you wanting to see it again and talk to others about it.  The casting is largely from television actors and recognizable faces (no doubt attributed to the fact that the film was originally going to be a television series), revealing and introducing some amazingly talented actors and actresses (Naomi Watts--clearly stretching beyond the matronly parts she has previously played, Laura Elena Harring, Justin Theroux, and Dan Hedaya in the most obvious occurrences).
The DVD is an interesting example of the mind of David Lynch.  It was his express directive that there be no chapter breaks in the movie.  It was also his express directive to disallow additional information beyond a cast list and the trailer.  His reasoning is that the additional material detracts from the experience of the film.  And in this case, he is right.  The additional material would allow the viewer to remove him or herself from the film, reminding them that it all was make-believe and without meaning.  In his own way, by starving the viewer of these extra tidbits, Lynch has created even more of an enigma for viewers to question well into the future.",1023148800,132,4361,4.934336525307797

Two young woman are living and interact in two parallel existances. In one Betty(Diane)is helping Rita(Camilla) to find her lost identity and fall in love with her , in the other , the same Diane(Betty) which desperately love Camilla(Rita), plan her killing , on professional and romantical reasons.
An old couple introduce Betty(Diane) to one world and the same

A young criminal wich cause a carr accident , enabeling thus the

1488194,5,B00005JKJA,"I've watched this movie at least 25 times over, and I still reject the dream interpretation embraced by so many stupid people.  Those who, like the critic Curmudgeonson, do not truly understand the film (as I do) may say something like, ""No scene shows us a moment outside of a dream"". This is totally wrong. As anyone with half a brain should see, what we actually have in the film is a mixture of reality, pseudo-reality, psycho-pseudo-reality, fantasy, micro-fantasy, chronic fantasy, anti-quasi-fantasy, semi-quasi-fantasy, pseudo-fantasy, pseudo-semi-fantasy, quasi-pseudo dream, macro-dream, retro-semi-dream, ante-retro-dream, and plain semi-dream.
The movie's central figure is obviously Diane.  Diane Selwin fails as an actress and carries on an emotionlly-exhausting lesbian love affair with Camilla Rhodes.  Diane eventually becomes revengeful and paranoid.  She thinks Camilla's success in the film industry was a result of the aid of powerful men.  Hence, the scene in the office is clearly an example of pseudo-fantasy blended with quasi-pseudo-dream.  Similarly, the scene with the director and Mr. ""Espresso"", among others,  demonstrates the characteristics of macro-dream.
Simply put, it is VERY EVIDENT that Betty is nothing more than the pathetic Diane's idealized self, which is an example of fantasy.  But Betty is not just a manifestation of fantasy, as so many moronic people claim.  Betty is also an example of anti-quasi-fantasy, and Diane necessarily calls on her every single miserable little day.  Betty changes over times, both in reality and in the mind of Diane.  Betty is the person Diane wants to be but is not.  Let's face it: we all dream of this kind of imaginery self.
Other parts of the movie are similar but also different, as well.  For instance, the ""man"" behind the diner is clearly related to Diane in the biological sense, though not in any discernible way.  The fact of the matter is:  A man saw Diane pass a photo to someone, and then give him the cash in the purse.  This man wonders if a ""hit"" is being orchestrated, but he, as anyone can tell, does not know for sure.  Thus, he begins having a retro-semi-dream involving a beast, which may represent his unconscious, unresolved guilt from childhood experiences with his mother.
The cowboy, who may be both important and unimportant, is a bit of an enigma to me.  Also, why do Rita and Betty have red highlights at the end of the movie?  Why does the director have a lighter hair tone?  Is Diane's suicide part of an ante-retro-dream?  There are some things that even I can't explain, but they are few and far between. For the most part, if you are anywhere close to intelligent, the answers to the questions that the movie raises are very easily answered through a bit of close study.  I think I know exactly what Lynch was trying to express. It's just sad that, like Curmudgeonson, most people don't.",1022889600,,2900,5.035639412997903
1488195,5,B00005JKJA,"I was bowled over by Mulholland. I had read nothing about the movie before I went to see it, just going on the merits of Lynch as a director. I have always loved his style of directing and vision. There is always a good-natured naivet&eacute; about his work. Something very pure and honest (this is why he goes on about the quality of coffee in his movies, I think)and of course very very weird.  He loves filmmaking and it shows. His work is uncompromising and pure. It is brave and very rare in Hollywood.
Mulholland Dr follows into that vein but there is an underlying tone of evil from the beginning that is fed by the goody goody nature of Betty (just too good to be true..too wide eyed and innocent) and the leering old couple when they leave Betty on the pavement of LA airport. But you just don't know where Lynch is taking you with this. I just let it wash over me and it was astonishing. Creepy, funny and devastating the story is a loop but you only find that out, of course, at the end of the movie... It Ends where it began.  It doesn't deal with normal time notions but it gives you clues as to what state of reality Betty/Diane is in.
Just look for the ashtray in the shape of the Piano. The lampshade and the robe and the hairstyle... If you keep your eye on that you will know what is real and what isn't.
But then the question is.. What does it all mean? The Blue Box? The key? The Cowboy, Silencio? The bum, The old Couple? The Thugs, No one can answer that (perhaps not even David Lynch) but one can only guess... and that is just part of the fun of this movie. There is no wrong answer but the symbolism is logical to a degree. (Think Pandora's box, the key is the key to Diane's release of her obsession, Silencio the calm before death, or death itself, The old couple her innocence lost..coming back to haunt her,  The thugs are validating her belief that the director was bullied into choosing Camilla and had nothing to do with Diane's lack of talent or star quality) It stays with you long after you have left the cinema. Like some vivid dreams they can baffle you as to their meaning but make you richer for having them... I was bowled over by Mulholland.

1488286,5,B00005JKJA,"It goes without saying that not all films are for everyone. Okay, 'Shrek' may be the singular exception, but I'll someone doesn't like that movie. 'Mulholland Drive' is pretty much every film major's dream because it's so enigmatic and diverse in it's themes that you can slap just about any meaning onto it that you want and it'll make sense. The real beauty of the film lies in it's enigma. You can explore it from numerous angles and strain your brain's reasoning center with all of them. And it's got two chicks doing it!
On the surface, 'Mullholland Drive' is a story about two women searching for the truth about one woman's past in a town of back-stabbers, murders, and the moronically avant garde, that suddenly takes a turn for the confusing that hurls faces, names, and characteristics into a blender and turns it up really high. If you don't start watching the movie with your symbolism glasses on you'll be confused to the point of insanity shortly after the introduction of the blue box. Fortunately the DVD includes a list of ten clues to figuring the mystery out, written by David Lynch. Read this first off or be prepared to clean grey matter of the walls.
'Mullholland Drive' can also be taken as a Freudian metaphor rather than literal occurances. Which leads more into a story about personnal struggle and sacrifice for fame rather than lonliness and rejection in relationships. The fact is there as many interpretations of the film as there are people who've seen it. Well, less actually, since a lot of people wrote it off as non-sensical 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' fodder (I will admit that it isn't diffacult to MST3K this movie). From it's intentionally bad acting at the beginning, to the Silencio scene, the film is meticulously crafted, and a great experience for people who enjoy reading too much into movies or just really want to impress people with their intelligence without having to be very intelligent at all.

1488288,5,B00005JKJA,"Ah, Los Angeles.  A thousand tales have already been told about the City of Dreams, and no wonder, with it being the most famous and faux-fabulous community of this modern age.  Some of these tales revel in grace and glamour, simply adding to the in-progress legend, while other storytellers attempt to deconstruct the faade, showing us the grit and grimy desperation seething under the surgeon-smiles and six-figure cars.  David Lynch's noir-ish _Mulholland Drive_ joins this latter group, and if you really pay attention while watching, you'll find that it makes sense - all of it -- even with just one viewing.  Massive in scope and brilliant in conception, _Mulholland Drive_ is, at its heart, a sad allegory of the quest for fame.
It's disturbing how much power actually exists in LA.  The bulk of American media information/entertainment originates, via television and film, from this concrete patchwork of smog and sensual overload: it programs millions to laugh, cry, fear; it titillates us with trends, slyly winks as it snatches bill after bill from the wallet.  It sells illusions, that most sought-after commodity; and illusions are infectious.

Near the beginning we are treated to Naomi Watts descending from an airport terminal, blue eyes a-glow with the myriad possibilities that confront her: a perfect cornfed image of Hollywood hope.  She has been given some encouragement by an elderly couple, who say they will `watch out for her movie--' it's sweet, sincere, until the elderly couple get into a cab, upon which they both break into sinister chuckling.  They know.  They see it all the time.  Hollywood hope comes in by the busload, folks, fresh-faced would-be thespians seeking that ticket to eternal fame - a thousand a week, or so the estimate goes.  A lucky few make it.  Thousands upon thousands more work in bars or restaurants or descend into more unsavory occupations, trying to find the right contacts, the perfect pitch...but I digress:
David Lynch, master of the surreal styling, directed _Mulholland Drive_, and it brims with his standard trademarks: careful camera pans, suggestive editing, atmospheric music to create mood and heighten tension.  Some of Lynch's previous films have suffocated under his *modus operandi*, but here technique, impeccably fashioned as it is, serves a deeper and far more meaningful theme.  There is no self-indulgence here: everything happens for a reason, be it in dream or stark reality.
Buried within the context of the film are a number of subtle (and not-so subtle) metaphors and allusions to the LA illusion-factory. There is a _lot_ I could mention/analyze, but words are precious (and limited), so let me state: One of the most striking (eg obvious) takes place during the theater scene, after the Mephesto-like performer exits amidst cheap brimstone.  A woman appears by a microphone, slouched and old, the heavy cosmetic care in the close-up still unable to totally disguise the wear.  In a vibrant voice she begins singing a familiar tune in Spanish.  At the peak, she collapses, presumably dead...but the song continues on, after the `machine' supposedly `voicing' it has broken down.  Rita and Betty shed tears.  They know, they know.  They see it all the time.  They are all players for the human appetite.

As soon as it was over I watched it again.  The next day I watched it again.  And I watched it two more times that same week.  The first few times through the movie you will not really understand what's going on, but that's what draws you to it so much.  You're watching, the whole time seemingly random things are happening, but you know it's part of some bigger picture which you just cannot figure out, and that's what's so compelling about the movie.  Somebody mentioned how the characters do not talk like normal people, but I argue quite the opposite.  In the last half of the movie they very much do talk like normal people, and once you actually do figure out what the movie is about, it will make perfect sense why they don't talk like normal people in the first half of the movie.  In fact, once you figure it out EVERYTHING makes perfect sense.  There is also quite a bit of wry humor in this movie which you can only understand once you figure out what the movie is about.

Betty: It's kind of weird to be calling yourself.
Rita: Maybe it's not me.

i think that the point of mulholland drive is to critize hollywood. if you notice Naomi Watt's character throughout the film, goes from a beautiful angelic innocent woman fresh from one of the most wholesome lands, Ontario Canada, to someone torn down to utter dispair. the phantasmagoric filmwork is superb and adds powerful tension to the plot. the twists may be hard to understand, but they fit in the story quite well. after all, what is an actor or an actress? who are they really?",1022457600,,686,4.496
1488374,4,B00005JKJA,"Welcome to David Lynch's universe where one has to be suspicious of even the most ordinary things.  'Mulholland Drive' is basically two stories; one involving a frustrated filmmaker and the other involving two women living in the same house.  One of the women was involved in a car accident, but can't remember her name nor where she came from.  The other woman just came to Hollywood searching for stardom.  The filmmaker is frustrated because the big shots of the studio want another woman for the role.  Alongside with that are smaller stories that will make some sense later on... I hope.
The story is told very unconvetionally and the second half of the film is a flasback.  Be warned though, the flashback is even more confusing than the first half.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the movie actually revolves around a very twisted murder plot.  The two murderers are the two least likely people one could imagine on this Earth.  I think I'm giving too much away now.  That is my best explaination of it.  Parts of it are boorish and parts of it are so bizzare, it is hard not to pay attention.  Once again though, I think Lynch is carefully ripping off Alfred Hitchcock.  Since Alfred has been imitated constantly, Lynch is careful not to be too much like him.  Only die-hard film buffs will notice the similarities in his stories and Hitchcock's.  Sorry David, you aren't that original.  ...",1022371200,,1404,4.692622950819672

Mulholland Drive requires that you think, which seems to offend and enrage a great many moviegoers (see reviews everywhere).
I don't mind thinking.  My pet peeves are continuity, historical accuracy (as appropriate), and lapses in logic - and some lacking in these three areas ruins most movies for me.  Happily, Mr. Lynch's films all tilt off-axis from the get-go, negating my usual concerns and leaving me free to enjoy the pictures...
I think there are several ways to ""read"" this movie, and as I've found, the storylines can realign themselves post-viewing to provide an entirely different perspective.  But, basically, there are two different girls with the same face, and one imagines the other.  Whether she does it to make herself feel better or worse is debatable... One could argue that there are parts of the story which are lived or imagined by other characters in yet another sequence of events in or out of synch with the main character(s).  This sounds so complicated, but it's simple onscreen.  And Naomi Watts was cheated - she should have received nominations, if not awards.  Hopefully, she will avoid the seeming curse of Lynch's leading ladies - all doing their best work for him, then sliding into obscurity (arty obscurity is still obscure) (when was the last time you saw Sheryl Lee in anything?)
If you struggled through ""Lost Highway,"" and eventually ""got it"" or some semblance of ""it,"" then you'll be pleased to see how  gracefully those ideas are put into practice here - a much less gimmicky set of characters, and a much deeper emotional resonance.",1022371200,,1762,4.862876254180602
1488376,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is one of the best movies I've seen in many years, even though I'm still trying to figure out what actually happened in this 2.5 hour movie.  Unlike most films that operate on logic, ""Mulholland Drive"" works on the emotions.  If you want a mystery that ""ties everything together,"" then this isn't the movie for you.
The plot involves a brunette who, having just survived a car accident, staggers through the streets of LA, apparently not remembering her name or the accident.  She stumbles her way into a posh home, where she befriends a perky blonde, who just flown from Canada to launch an acting career.  Together, they try to discover the brunette's identity.
Meanwhile, a young hotshot director is being manipulated by members of the mob, who insist they have a say as to who should be cast as leading lady in his film.  This subplot, I guess, is Lynch's commentary on Hollywood and the often dubious politics that go on during movie-making.
Despie the movie's incoherence, ""Mulholland Drive"" is absolutely fascinating to watch.  Everything, from the camerawork to Angelo Badalamenti's seductive score to Naomi Watts's award-calibre performance, grabs hold of your attention and refuses to let go.  But just when you THINK you've understood the movie, the film's final third takes a dramatic, unexpected turn.  I won't reveal what it is, but it will certainly throw you in for a loop.
The DVD itself has a great 5.1 soundtrack and a crisp and vivid picture.  However, all we get for features are the trailer and ""10 clues.""

1488379,3,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch can't tell a straight story, if you pardon the pun.  I don't mind time-bending storylines (""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Memento"") but they have to have an underlying, live plot, as opposed to images, mood and style.  And the film was too long and too self-involved.  What do I mean by self-involved?  I'm tired of books about authors (""Wonderboys""), plays about stage performers (""Noises Off""), songs about musicians (""Faithfully"") and most of all, films about actors.  Quit getting off on yourselves for once.  Why three stars?  Because Lynch is Lynch.  Who else could give you characters like the Cowboy and the Incompetent Hitman?

What I will say about the film though is that it's one of the most brilliant, Challenging, emotional, well thought out, well directed, and well written movies I've had the pleasure of viewing. The Brilliance behing the film is what you the viewer make of it. Every time I watch it (7 times now) I find something that wasn't there before, changing what I think the movie is really about slighly.

1488476,2,B00005JKJA,"There are two main tendencies in analyzing the picture. One group of reviewers says there is nothing in Mulholland Drive besides the director's whimsiness, overindulgence and the apparent lack of ideas - the trait that all the artsy/noirish vagueness fails to camouflage. The more enthusiastic viewers willfully abstain from any analysis of the film at all, calling it ""impossible to comprehend"", ""intentionally irrational"", ""a dark meditation on the evilness of Hollywood"" and ""a surrealist dreamscape"". And of course there are some people who exit a multiplex cursing or shrugging, regretting the time and money spent, common Joes and Janes with the plans of a nice Saturday night movie thwarted.
I'm happy for the ""incomprehensible masterpiece"" crowd - they'll get value for money. These are the people who like to think they can transcend their basically mainstream preferences and like to see from time to time ""something with a twist"", provided a couple of media gurus certify it's Art. They buy and proudly display Salvador Dali's albums, fascinated by the well-drawn realistic objects and figures in the funny combinations. That's all it takes for them to feel they are the advanced consumers of Art - something kitschy and conventional shredded, mixed, put together at random and lacquered with the gloss de jour.
But these who think Mr. Lynch is just having a good time messing with his mind and camera totally disregarding the plebeian preferences are not right, I think. He is acutely aware of his obligations. He must be amused watching the acolytes catalogizing all the droppings of the director's prolific imagination - the Dwarf, the Cowboy, the dark blue cube - attributing the meaning(s) to every nonsensical item Mr. Lynch throws in.
But he is not just taking, he's giving what he thinks his quasi-sophisticated clientele likes and needs. As much as they are fascinated with the blonde's and brunette's purpose(less/ful) fumblings the bonus of the soft-porno action is very welcome, the urge to see the ladies' mammae revealed is the lowest common denominator of every male from ultimately highbrow to the utterly proletarian. The leading characters MUST have an intercourse as the a film progresses - regardless of their sex - and the maestro is happy to oblige with the most gratuitous sex scenes in the recent cinema - with the dark seductress sporting the implanted frontal bounty worthy of any XXX starlet.
And the good old uaghaha is also a must to keep the audience entertained and grateful. It's hard to consciously ""enjoy"" the film's ""artsiness"" for such a long duration - so the comic relief comes in time, we see the slapstick Tarantinoid eccentrics of the hilarious hitman, stinging the fat lady's behind with a bullet, making funny for the fans' benefit, giving the break from the grateful scanning of the ""surrealist dreamscape"".
These who seek will find. The ""meaning"" is here spruced with a nice little bonuses that make 2  hours of experiencing ""art cinema"" endurable. Take the subdued pain of watching pretentious nonsense and gain the feeling of being ""in"".
I'm a bit surprised there is only one David Lynch in the USA - the country where all kinds of do-it-yourself are very popular. Is it so difficult to make a collage of the conventional scenes, putting the end before the beginning, making the characters search fervently not for million dollars or a small blue key but the tiny taxidermist's glass eye that can open the doors to another universe, easily? Then brunette is suddenly seen with the blond Afro hairstyle and has a different name and her former female lover wears a man's suit and talks in basso, the slimy spiked monster springs at the weirdo's face from the diner's paper cup - not from around the corner, Cowboy is replaced by the menacing Fireman in glass shoes or the grossly oversize Boy Scout with red beard and the small pet rhinoceros with poisoned horn. All this circus interacts to the pompous music composed by someone with a pompous Italian name. And everything must be soaked wet in the darkness, to be very noir - i.e moody and ""meaningful"", meditative.
Then the show opens to the satisfied grunts of these who prefer ""to experience, not to understand"", to look in your next offering for a new glimpse of the trademark Mean Fireman, Bearded Boy Scout and the blonde with enormous Afro riding the blue rhino to the mystic interworld portal in the McDonald's toilet.",1021852800,8,4434,4.983805668016195
1488477,4,B00005JKJA,"Great movie, but a quick warning for buyers of the DVD -- the region 1 copy I have doesn't have chapters. Seems like Lynch has stipulated that the whole movie is done in one chapter.
Annoying really, because I'd love to be able to skip to scenes like Club Silencio. I guess Lynch only wanted people to watch the movie from start to finish. I still don't think that's a good reason to ignore the benefits that DVDs can provide in terms of chapter skipping.",1021852800,,455,4.364705882352941

1488479,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is an erotic, explosive and CONFUSING film.  I've read various interpretations of what the movie could and couldn't stand for and all led to the same conclusion, the movie is GREAT but no one understands it...
  But thats what is so great about, it deserves interpretation, explanation and opinions.  The most logical conclusion that I can muster from the film is that it is a dream, various stories and arcs overlapping each other, trying to be interpreted, only to succumb to another thought.  We, the viewer, linger on one story, then transition onto another with little justification.  It may seems illogical and disoriented, but whose dreams aren't?
  Don't be fooled!  These actors and actresses can act!  When I first saw the film, I thought ""This acting is soooooo wooden, why did Lynch allow this to hit the screen?""  But everyone holds their weight, and when Naomi Watts goes in for her audition, she will blow your mind!
  But if you can't accept an confusing ""artsy-fartsy"" flick, then I suggest seeing the film for the visuals... David Lynch filmed a fantastically erotic and absorbing movie that takes the audience on a mind-blowing adventure around L.A.  The individual scenes range romantic, violent, hilarious and sexy, yet the most powerful scene comes when the two vixens attend a performance by a sensual Spanish singer (or is she really singing, are we really watching her, etc.)

  The debates and questions on the film could go on forever, with everyone throwing in their own two cents, but the truth is the Mulholland Drive in an engrossing film and a true mind adventure.  Though the DVD is bare on its extras, the movie is too good to pass up, I suggest that everyone (at least) rent the movie and watch it once, wait a day or two, and watch it again.  If you still don't have a perception on the story, at least you experienced a wonderful ride.",1021766400,4,1889,4.7746913580246915
1488480,5,B00005JKJA,"Att.: Excuse me, if there are some mistakes in the text, because english isn't my native language, but I hope to make my points clear.
It is not easy to say something about 'Mulholland Drive', because the movie isn't normal, and the fans also aren't (I am the best proof for that ;)).
You will love the movie, or you hate it. But who will like this movie? If you like the other movies from David Lynch, you will love this one.
It's hard to make the movie work for you, here is the way I made it working for me:
Don't spoil the movie to yourself befor watching it. DON'T read ANY analysis. The movie is only that worth, what YOU can get out of it. Any interpretation by thirds will destroy your own experience. And that's, what the movie truly is, it's an experience. Even if it's build up logical, when you see it the first time, you won't be able to explain it in a logical way. It will only work on an emotional level. Free your mind from what you expect from regular movies and just let go.
After you saw the movie, it's of course interesting to discuss it with other people, and that's alright. But please, build up you're own opinion first.
I think, the DVD is nearly perfect. Sound and Colours are excelent. Of course, there is nearly no bonus material, but it fits to the movie. There is, for example, no audio comment by David Lynch, and I am really greatful about that. And audio comment would perhaps explain a lot, but it would destroy everything for you.
Another point is, that the movie is delivered in only one chapter, and I also think, that makes sense. When you see the movie for the first time, you won't understand much, but when you make breakes while watching the movie for longer then five minutes (for visiting the toilette and the fridge ;)), you won't have not chance to understand anything. So only watch the hole movie without breaks.
I hope, my 'instructions' will help you a bit to enjoy the movie, because it's worth all the work!",1021766400,,1960,4.372602739726028

Mr. Lynch is talented, there's no denying that, but his contempt for his audience is unsettling.  Maybe it's just me, but I honestly felt that the last 1/3 of the movie was there to ""break it down"" for those of us that couldn't make the connections.

David Lynch excites as well as divides film viewers. it is not worth reading what this movie is about, its aim is for you to refigure,configure,conjure,make sense of things. Everything does make sense miraculously as only someone can. No doubt Lynch is an absolute genius. Anyone who got this movie can explain in a review what this is about but there are nights when you dream. there are certain smells you sniff and have a sense of deja vu, there are certain feelings you have at moments when things are unexplainable in their simplest ways, this film is that and more and is a mental sensory overload, and if like some (including proud old me! )you get this on the first try, Bravo Bravo! Either you will hate this movie or either you will feel ecstatic. I found it eerie but its like a drug that I need to have. I have seen this once and will not see it again for reasons that ultimately the movie has set out what it aimed to do to me. you have not seen anything like this at all. it makes absolute sense just like when you put togther a jigsaw puzzle. Naomi Watts and Laura Harring are eerily beautiful to look at and gorgeous, as well as helping the movie along....sometimes on trainer wheels, and sometimes on one wheel but never on normal standards.

you don't like heavy films
you don't like solving puzzles

I've now seen all two and a half hours of this beautiful, difficult, and disturbing film three times. I still don't know what it ""means,"" and I still don't care. Once you accept certain givens in a Lynch film--disjointed narrative, intentionally cheesy dialogue, demonic dwarves--and allow his imagery to guide you, you're in for a truly spooky ride. There are scenes in Muholland Drive (and in Eraserhead and Blue Velvet) that no other director could have even imagined much less caught on film. Of course, it helps that the film's darker elements are balanced by liberal doses of eroticism and campy good humor. Ultimately, though, Lynch's portrait of a talented innocent swallowed whole by the corporate studio system constitutes no less than a hate letter to Hollywood, albeit one that was nominated for several Academy awards!
Finally, I'm docking this DVD a notch not because of the film's quality but because of a poor video transfer and an inexplicable and very obvious bit of censorship in the film's one love scene.",1021593600,,1102,5.06043956043956

You can see that he is losing his grip as the film staggers on towards the last quarter. The only thing that holds it together is the lovely use of colour throughout the film. All the shots are 50% too long. Dreams and fantasies don't make good films unless you are Andrey Tarkovsky. Disapointing.,1021507200,5,468,4.571428571428571

1488566,5,B00005JKJA,"Hollywood doesn't release many films that can't possibly be fully comprehended in one viewing, but if you DO enjoy a good multi-layered departure from straight narrative and sequential storytelling, David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE is the most rewarding vehicle you'll likely see since Howard Hawks helmed THE BIG SLEEP in 1946.
Yes, this IS a complex story whose plot cannot be explained in a single sentence. Yes, it DOES require two or three viewings before the intricacies of the puzzle begin to fall into place, and yes, it DEFINITELY IS a puzzle worth the effort and patience to solve, for once you do, you'll discover there is much method to director Lynch's madness. It's a rare film I can honestly say the more I watch, the more I want to experience it again, and again.
The most interesting revelation I've come to realize while watching this film is the way Lynch turns the tables on his audience. You begin this cinematic Mobius strip by watching a long, dream-like fantasy as a starry-eyed ingenue named Betty from Palookaville arrives in Tinseltown and accidentally becomes involved with a helpless amnesiac (who calls herself Rita). Nancy Drew-style, Betty decides to help her friend regain her memory and put her life back in order.
""It would be just like in the movies!"" she beams with excitement.
However, Rita gradually reveals herself to be someone who is not as she appears as the film skews off on a nightmarish tangent, leaving the VIEWER to solve the puzzle of the two women and how the events surrounding them relate to each other. As the mystery unfolds, you become immersed in a tragic story of unrequited love and dreams gone sour in a land where dreams are often made, or in this case, shattered.
No matter how you feel about the film afterwards, it stays with you for a while. I have to wonder (since he refuses to discuss the plot in interviews) if Lynch ever undergoes a moment of blissful schadenfreude when he hears about the anger and spiteful feelings his movie arouses in those who can't cope with it's complexity. In fact, you have to wonder if those are the ones he wrote the story for in the first place.
Oh, well... whatever. I'm sure there will be many more re-hashings of old TV shows and remakes of antiquated blockbusters released in the theatres to appease the most undiscriminating of tastes. Meanwhile, some of us would like David Lynch to know that if MULHOLLAND DRIVE is the caliber of work that can be expected from him in the future, he'll always have a faithful audience.",1021334400,17,2522,4.747152619589977

Lynch lo ha hecho, se ha atrevido ajugar con tiempos, sonidos, espacios, actores, situaciones de una manera fenomenal, cortes en donde ha dejado abiertas las opiniones a nuevas conclusiones y finales por conectar.

1488695,2,B00005JKJA,"Since others have described here in some details the plot developments of the story, I only have some comments about the creativity of this movie. Lynch follows in the footsteps of his Lost Highway and undermines the conventional chronological order of the plot, presenting us with pieces of a puzzle which are to be put together. Furthermore, the movie seems to desire to reflect reality as a dream-state which need not make sense logically, but should be felt (reminds me of his Twin Peaks).
Well, that's all find and good. The film is an artistic experiment, i.e., Lynch wants to stress that films allow us to perceive the world from one than one perspective. But that is something Lynch has been doing for a while and I don't see any advances here. The plot elements are very slim. He is rehashing common themes (e.g., unhappy director, the mob that controls the industry, women who endear themselves to the audience on the basis of their appearance - and did that one ever work, just read the reviews for this movie on this web site - Harring this and Harring that).
What bothers me about this movie the most is that you have to wait for an hour or two for the movie to put itself together. I don't mean that one has to wait two hours for all the pieces to fit. What I mean is that the first 1 2/2 is sub-par filmaking. The scenes are mostly meaningless on their, their feel acted as opposed to lived, and they are strangly surreal (I know this is the point but I am getting tired of being subjected to them only to wait for an hour for the filmaker to reward me for watching them). I dislike movies where you have to wait to be rewarded (and I had the same impression when I saw Sixth Sense, Cooky's Fortune and Gosford Park and was ready to walk about of the theater after an hour). It doesn't say anywhere that a movie that seeks to break presentational conventions does not have the responsibility to be interesting while it establishes its characters (look at Remains of the Day - it managed to built up character and tension and capture the viewer's attention throughout, I think). This complain of mine has really nothing to do with the patience or attention span of the viewer. I think that films are created for an audience. This audience wants to discover a new world. Conventional plot developments and actresses that deliver more with their looks than with the strength of their charater (I thought that was the case in Amelie too) do not create good movies. Was there anything endearing about any of them? Watts' performence was above the rest, but her character still had little appeal - even if she represents a typical actress or the victim of the L.A. scene, I still consider her character unremarkable.
While this movie isn't by far bad, I would expect better from Lynch - especially since he makes one every two years or so and certainly does not make movies for the mainstream. I can't think of any reason why I should recommand this movie to anyone but hardcore David Lynch fans.",1021161600,,3005,4.546125461254612
1488696,4,B00005JKJA,"For starters, I'll try to give my word without spoiling any of it. The first time I saw Mulholland Dr. I was left with a little bit of perplexity and disappointment. I gave it another meticulous viewing and was amazed at the things that escaped my understanding the first time. Believe me, almost everything in this movie fits perfectly with the plot, and everything is important. If you didn't liked it is probably because you didn't understand it. Give it another try as I did, and believe me, you'll love it when you come to understand it. I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 because of the poor disc features (or lack of for that matter). No chapter selection (at Lynch's request), but an amazing transfer and sound (DTS and DD). If you need any hints or you absolutely want to spoil the fun and be told everything you can find an explanation of the movie online or e-mail me and I'll try my best. HINT: The movie is in chronological order (so don't try Memento-ing it)you just need to watch closely at every little deatil and just watch everything unfold.
BTW- A little bit of advise, if you're planning on buying it, wait a little longer, who knows, maybe we'll get a special edition later on.",1021075200,,1197,4.470319634703197

This movie is to be experienced! Naomi Watts is fantastic.
The supportive characters are classic David Lynch.
Open your mind to a refreshing thriller that doesn't do all the work for you and understand that there will be many things that will qualify as ""loose ends"".",1021075200,,596,4.427272727272728
1488775,1,B00005JKJA,"I am a huge fan of imagery and surealism. However, this film wore down my patience. There is no way to ever completely understand a Lynch film. The enjoyment in his work comes from mood and intrigue. Mulholland drive did not have nearly enough intrigue to compensate for the lack of logic. Scenes were strung together in a frusterating order. I kept anticipating some funtctional link tying previous scenes together. But as the movie went on, all the audience is treated to is mindless vignettes that only confuse the plot until the only sensible explanation to what you are watching, is that Lynch wrote the script after waking up from a dream. A very tedious dream at that.",1020902400,3,675,4.728813559322034
1488776,5,B00005JKJA,"In my opinion, Mulholland Drive was by far the best movie of 2001.  I think that in some of his other films, David Lynch just gave up at some point and released his grip on reality and even coherence.  What sometimes resulted (and I'm thinking here of movies like Lost Highway) were some fascinating mind trips that didn't really hold up to intense critical scrunity.  Mulholland Drive is different.  There's no way to explicate the mysteries of the movie in this short review, but I think that persistent and thoughtful viewers will find Mulholland Drive to be a brilliant exploration of a troubled mind as well as a blistering criticism of Hollywood and the movie industry.  The movie is by no means simple or easily accessible, but it is definitely worth repeated viewings and long discussions with good friends--I don't think that a single, solitary viewing will do it justice.",1020729600,,881,4.846666666666667
1488777,5,B00005JKJA,"This film is absolutely brilliant.  Days later, I was still thinking about the movie.  My favorite part was the Spanish version of Crying in the club Silencio.  It reminded of Laura Palmer crying in TP:FWWM in the club.  There are still things about the movie I totally do not understand--who was the monster--Diane? or the devil?, were they ever even in the apartment, if so why does the aunt come back to see what the noise was?  The score is absolutely breathtaking.  Laura Herring is beautiful and Naomi Watts performance exceptional.
Let's face it, Lynch is a guy you either love or hate, get or don't get, etc.  He makes movies that make you think; ie this is not for someone who just can't get enough of those Rush Hour movies.  He is the absolute art film director and in tune to the surrealist movement.",1020556800,,812,4.551724137931035

I cannot believe that I just wasted my time and my money to be confused by a movie such as this (I have my husband to confuse me already!). I truly believe that the movie stars who gave great review for this movie were just being so sarcastic and full of revenge.

1488779,4,B00005JKJA,"The only biographical data on David Lynch, if you look him up in the Cast and Crew section of this DVD, is ""Eagle Scout"".  This cryptic bio is relevant precisely because of its terse irony and apparent irrelevance.
The film itself is (on the surface, at least) about another Eagle Scout-type -- a chirpy, aw-shucks young Canadian woman who comes to Hollywood with stars in her eyes -- only to find a dingy underbelly of ... studio executives, scary homeless people, and seedy lowlifes.  The girl (whose very name is suspect), beautifully played by Naomi Watts, floats in the rippling California sunshine like Lynch's Jungian Anima in a lucid fever-dream.  Everything seems just a little too scrubbed-clean and cheerful.  The happier the first parts of the film got, the greater the dread that developed in the pit of my stomach.
True to form, Lynch pulls the rug out in a bravura third-act that calls everything that has come before it into question.  This goes beyond some funky narrative sleight-of-hand trick (as pulled by such recent films as The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects); it forces us to confront the sad, desperate acts of self-deception necessary for a young actress to survive mentally, once she has become ... used by the  Hollywood Beast.
There are many plot strands that seem, at first, to go nowhere.  There is the amnesiac actress (the amazing Laura Elana Harring) who was saved from an apparent mob hit by a fortuitous car accident.  The mystery of her identity and circumstance is the springboard for most of the film.  Then there is the disillusioned film director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) - apparently a caricature of Lynch himself - who is forced by mob-types to cast a certain actress in the lead part of his film.  There is a bumbling hit-man whose body-count rises alarmingly because of his darkly hilarious ineptitude.  Oh, and we mustn't forget the young man who is haunted by dreams of a hideous man-beast behind a local chain-diner's dumpster.
After seeing this film four times, I am convinced that every piece does, indeed, fit -- although less according to logic than the rules of dreams, where pieces of metaphor, memory, and emotion come together in seemingly readable, yet elusive patterns.
Don't be put off by claims that Mulholland Drive makes no sense - the plot DOES make sense, but more in the manner of a painting or symphony, rather than a stereo manual.
The DVD is skimpy on extras and has no chapter stops (per Lynch's desires, as I understand), but the picture and sound quality are quite good.
With Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has succeeded in demolishing the structure of typical narrative films while still maintaining a potentially comprehensible narrative.  He has also created a modest hit and was nominated for an Academy Award.
Not bad for an Eagle Scout.",1020556800,32,2820,4.876569037656904
1488780,2,B00005JKJA,"Isn't it possible that all the ""mysterious"" and unexplainable plot twists in Mulholland Drive really are just a result of having to slap together a feature film ending on a tv series pilot?  Lynch sets in motion many intriguing sub-plots and characters in the first half of the film, which is very watchable, in my opinion.  But then the film unravels, and in effect forgets itself, which is very unsatisfying.  The care with which these characters, even the minor ones, are introduced, makes the finale seem unfair.  I wanted more...as in a whole season of episodic television, which is obviously what Lynch had in mind.  I've read a lot of intricate analyses of this film, and I keep thinking it is all one huge case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", with David Lynch having a laugh at all the film ""experts"" who see brilliant symbolism and metaphor instead of a naked failed tv pilot.",1020470400,5,885,4.720779220779221

1488782,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is an amazing film. David Lynch's latest masterpiece is about a woman named Diane Selwyn whose girlfriend, Camilla, has just dumped her for a man. Diane goes to sleep and has a dream. In the dream, Diane has control over everything she doesn't in real life, e.g her girlfriend, her acting career. In her dream, her girlfriend Camilla is about to be murdered by two hitman when the limo she's driving is hit by a speeding car. Camilla survives, but she suffers from amnesia. Meanwhile, Diane has pictured herself as an aspiring actress named Betty who is coming to Hollywood to become a movie star. Betty takes Camilla in, who calls herself Rita, and takes care of her. Later, Betty has a stunning audition and becomes sexually involved with Rita. After Diane (Betty) wakes up, we see events unfold that explain why Betty had that dream and the motivations behind why certain characters acted the way they did. The movie ends with Betty meeting with a hitman to set up a hit on her now ex-girlfriend Camilla.
This film took me two viewings to understand. The film's narrative style is very unconventional. This film reminded me of Christopher Nolan's films like Following and Memento in the way the story was told. The story was hard to follow, but since most of the movie is a dream, this style was appropriate. There were a few great scenes in this film. They are the kind of scenes that stay with you, with characters that jump out of the screen at you.
What amazed me about this film was the distinctive personality traits that made each character unique. The Cowboy was stoic and sarcastic. Adam comes home and sees his wife in bed with another man. He takes her jewelry box and pours paint in it. The man who drinks the expresso, which is considered one of the ""finest expressos in the world"", spits it out on his napkin. The hitman (in Betty's dream) is portrayed as inept and clumsy. This was an excellent recipe for good comic relief and it worked.
There was another thing I noticed in this film that was very well done. When Adam pours the paint on his wife's jewelry box, he mixes it in with his hands and gets the paint all over his shirt. This was a way to carry over that color to subsequent scenes, and hence, added color to them. Adam's paint covered shirt gave him a personality. It added life to a scene that would have been ordinary with him just wearing a black shirt. I know this wasn't an accident.

Hey I can deal with artsy-fartsy movies and the avant guard and even B movies, but there are 2 sins in movie making I can't forgive: the acting and the dialogue.  Both are terrible in this move.  After 2 scenes I looked at my wife and said, ""People just don't talk like this.  This is the type of dialogue a 5th grader writing his first story would churn out.""
The acting was equally horrible, unless of course these were great actors actually trying to come off like bad actors; in that case I scream 'Bravo'.  But that is highly unlikely.  I saw better acting in my 4th grader's Christmas pageant last year.  The little kid playing the stable manager was more believable.
If you're a big David Lynch fan buy this movie!!  If you have any doubts, and I mean ANY, wait until you've rented 10 movies at your video store and get the 11th movie free and then use it on this film.  That way you won't feel so bad when you rip this thing out of the DVD player.

1488853,4,B00005JKJA,"OK, here's a CliffsNotes explantion for the crybabies that didn't understand the movie:
1. The movie begins with a shot of someone falling asleep on a red pillow. This is Diane Selwyn. This leads to...
2. The first half of the movie, which is Diane's dream. In her dream, she is Betty, a perky, aspiring actress with everything going for her (Betty is everything that Diane is not in real life). In the dream, the amnesiac Rita is based on the real Camilla Rhodes whom Diane had an affair with (likewise, Rita is everything that Camilla is not in real life).
3. The second half of the movie is Diane awake. We learn that her life stinks in a series of flashbacks which also explain the dream she had the previous night.
All of the recent events and characters in Diane's real life (the cowboy, the Espresso guy, the waitress, Bob Brooker, Coco, the scared guy at Winkie's, etc.) show up in some form or another within the dream.  Look closely... you'll see them all. (Sidenote: I don't know if any of you have had a dream recently, but you probably dreamt about $hit that concerned you in real life too. Not to hard to understand that, right?)
For those of you that appreciated figuring out this movie (as I did), I applaud you. The only reason why I didn't give the DVD five stars, is because the chapter selection would have been truly useful (although seeing the movie as a whole is a the real experience).
Is Mulholland Drive a frustrating movie? It sure is. Is it hard to watch? It sure is. Is it worth watching? ABSOLUTELY! It's one of the few movies of last year that demanded that you use intelligence to unravel its rewards.
For those reviewers who still don't get it, never fear... I heard Carrot Top is making a direct-to-video release real soon.",1020297600,51,1757,4.507836990595611

Not only that but this is an absolutely horrible DVD release. Only a trailer and Cast & Crew info! This also has to be a first for a DVD that doesn't have any chapter stops.

1488855,5,B00005JKJA,"This fantastic picture has played on my DVD player nearly every day since its release. Mulholland drive is by no means a film for the lazy of thought or close minded of souls. Lynch is not a director, he is a great artist who is able to tap into the abstact and realistic realms of life and give us a glimpse of how they are so mistaken for one another. He is perhaps the only known abstact expressionist filmmaker in the world, and Mulholland Drive is a canvas of swirling brush strokes and Jackson pollack-like drips of truth and feelings. What is real, and what is a dream? These questions are not answered, they can not be. That would be a personal opinion by the Lynch. What Lynch does, is put the perception totally in our (the viewer's) heads. The DvD comes with this great feature of a inside sleeve ""10 clues to unlock the mystery"", which could or could not help you. The great thing about this film is you might have a different pertcepti0on of what it is about everytime you see it. So PLEASE see this movie, it is ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FILMS made in the last twenty years. Yourt perception is needed, your opinion is valuable. The story that revolves around this film is a dreamscape, I won't even begin to explain. But..
-There is a accident.
-There is a actress, an amnesiac, a dead woman, a wannabe
 actress, a lover, some one or everyone is from Deep River,
 Onterio,  and they might all be the same person, or two people,
 or three or at least someone is seeing an abstact mirror image
 of what was, or is, or might become.
-Paying attension to names(don't worry about faces), and little
 details are what makes this an sensational
 nightmare/dream/life/winkle in time.
See this film, see this film,
-Time is a meaningless thing and not everything happens they way

1488856,2,B00005JKJA,"This film did have all of your Lynch-isms, and I am a fan of Lynch, but it did not hit home for me. One of the funnest things about Lynch is watching the movies again and figuring them out. I got it for the most part, but honestly I didn't care to give it another veiw even for the sake of proving I could understand everything. I really had high hopes for this movie, but I'm not gonna like it just because its Lynch.

1488857,4,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is a dark treatise on Hollywood. David Lynch's renown as an unorthodox artist and the pressure he has felt to make conventional films is vividly at play here in the subtext to the film's twisting narrative. He deliciously explores this theme through the film's characters, one of whom is a film director who is forced to relinquish control of casting his female lead.
The two female characters are designed as metaphors for the loss of one's identity in tinsel town. Betty, a newly arrived, wide-eyed innocent girl from Canada comes to LA to seek her destiny in motion pictures. Her career plans are put on hold when she meets a woman who calls herself Rita and shows up in Betty's shower. But Rita is unsure of exactly who she is as she has just been involved in a car accident, and is suffering from amnesia. Betty undergoes an amazing, but brief transformation, in a sexy audition piece and Rita finds out the grisly fate of a friend of hers named Diane. These episodes are but a foreshadowing of the twists yet to come as Betty and Rita's lives become increasingly intertwined. The final mystery is unveiled in a cacophony of bizarre dreamlike imagery that includes a trip to a nightclub where reality is just an illusion, a homeless man with a blue box and little people inside it, and two lesbian love scenes.
Undoubtedly, there will be many people who dislike this film. It's non-linear, dreamlike narrative is just too difficult for most mainstream audiences. But that is precisely why David Lynch fans and non-fans alike should give Mulholland Drive another look. How many DVDs have you bought, thinking you would watch them dozens of times, only to have them collect dust on the shelf? Mulholland Drive is one of those haunting, eerie, masterpieces that demand multiple viewing. Even when you've unraveled the obscure plot, you will watch this film again and again as Lynch's mystery of mixed identities envelops you in a myriad of sensations. Mulholland Drive is all at once, foreboding, mysterious, frightening and beautiful.
The one and only reason I gave this four stars instead of five has to do with the DVD itself, not the movie. There are practically no extras on this disc, not even chapter stops. And if ever a movie demanded audio commentary from its director, it's this one. My suspicion is that Universal is planning a ""special"" edition of Mulholland Drive with these bonuses. Quite frankly, I'm sick of these marketing tactics to get us poor suckers to buy multiple copies of the same film. But the movie itself is the best frill on this no-frills package. Buy it, and rent the special edition when it comes out.",1020124800,2,2653,4.794759825327511
1488858,3,B00005JKJA,"This movie is Lynch at his best! I would have rated it a 5 if it wasn't for the DVD's lack of special features. One major problem is there is no chapter selection.

If figuring out this movie is important to you this feature would of been nice to have. Also, it would of been nice to have a making of or interview session with the cast. Besides that the visual and audio quality are great. In the same tradition as Lost Highway Lynch has created a masterpiece that will be anaylized for the rest of time. Definately a classic.

1488859,2,B00005JKJA,"I am only rating the DVD itself with the above 2 stars - not the film which I give 5 stars ++++
 This DVD (not the actual film!) is a HUGE disappointment. There are no extras other than the trailer for Mulholland Drive. There is a _very_ short cast list with a picture of the featured cast members and their bio & previous works listed.

 NO interviews
 NO director's commentary - NOTHING!
 NO chapter selection!
 NO deleted scenes
 IT'S ONE BIG CHAPTER!!
 I mistakenly turned off my DVD player (instead of pausing) & then  had to very-slowly- use the search->> forward on my remote instead of being able to skip chapters to find where I left off. That was beyond frustrating..
 I had expected at least a chapter selection. I had been looking forward to the DVD hoping for some Director's commentary, maybe even the making of, some interviews, deleted scenes & maybe even trailers for other Lynch movies!!! (Wouldn't that have been great?!!) The DVD does offer subtitles/captions available in English, Spanish and French. The 2nd star I threw in is for the interesting leaflet inside the DVD: "" David Lynch's 10 clues to unlocking this thriller."" The picture itself is pretty good and so is the sound. Still the overall the DVD lack of features are a huge disappointment. I was too eager to purchase this DVD and should have waited for a special edition.
 To me this film was the most emotionally engrossing and powerful of all of David Lynch's works. The scene that affected me the most and continues to stick in my mind is the Silencio sequence, which had me in tears. The intensity of Mulholland Drive had me on the edge throughout the film. Mulholland Drive is very complex, emotional, ironic, tragic, cruel, eerie and hauntingly beautiful.
 This film is not as straight forward as some of David Lynch's other projects (Blue Velvet etc). The twists and turns and sudden switches between reality and illusion only add to the film's & Director's merits in my opinion. Not that any Lynch films are (meant to be?) very straight forward. You'd never hear someone watch a Lynch film and exclaim at the end ""That all made perfect sense!"".. Perhaps Lynch films are never meant to be 'understood' but only enjoyed in all their outrageousness and hilarity. (Take ""Wild At Heart"" for example.) Mulholland Drive's ending is a bizarre free-for-all that I was unable to piece together. I was still left with some unanswered questions. This didn't disappoint me, rather every time I watch it I find something new. And that only adds to the  intrigue and encourages me to watch the film again and again.
 Summing it up, another reviewer *Kaleido Logic* so  eloquently wrote:
  ""I could probably come to some conclusion about the meaning of it all, but everyone should come up with  their own. And that is why Lynch is such an essential filmmaker, no one will ever do it like he does, and no  one ever has. People can debate the meaning of his films for all of eternity and never agree, and that alone  makes this film a worthwhile entry in the Lynch legacy.""
 The acting is flawless and very impressive.  Laura Harring is heartbreakingly beautiful! She perfectly conveys the helplessness, desperation and terror felt being held captive by her own failed memory. She is absolutely yummy! I am still awestruck with Naomi Watt's dynamic performance as Betty / Diane Selwyn.  Her character reveals her complexities slowly and enticingly. First the naive small town girl, secondly the heated seductress (WOW) during her audition and then her unabashed courage and determination to solve the puzzle of Rita's true identity and finally as tortured and vengeful Diane. I recommend this movie to absolutely any David Lynch fan or person who appreciates a mystery that takes you on a stormy ride
 People not accustomed to David Lynch's work might find this film difficult to follow, confusing and maybe difficult to understand. ( I won't be recommending it to my Grandparents any time soon).. I imagine anyone experiencing David Lynch's work for the first time through this film will either love it or hate it. People do tend to have very strong reactions one way or another to David Lynch's work.
 Any Twin Peaks fan should find this right up their alley (even if they did not like any of Lynch's work other than the Twin Peaks series). Not that I can imagine not liking any of Lynch's work!!
Again my rating of 2 stars is just for my absolute disappointment in the lack of extras on the DVD edition, not the film itself.",1020124800,5,4500,4.753213367609255
1488860,5,B00005JKJA,"I must admit I have not yet had a chance to look at the DVD of this movie. But the last time I was comparably impressed by a new release dates back a couple years now, when I saw Eyes Wide Shut for the first time. The New York Film Critics chose Mulholland Drive as best picture of the year and I certainly don't think they erred in doing so. Two films came out last year that employed unconventional narrative techniques, Memento and this picture, yet who could be in doubt about which work is the more challenging of the two? Memento has an arresting premise, but no one who watches the beginning of the movie closely should miss the premise or experience difficulty in following what comes after. By contrast, in Mulholland Drive David Lynch is constantly throwing the viewer off balance. It would be going a bit far to compare Lynch's new creation with Alain Robbe-Grillet and Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad, but hardly any movie of equivalent narrative complexity,visual richness, and difficulty has been made in the United States for years.
I have reviewed Mulholland Drive on my Web site (davesothermovielog.com), but I wanted to record some additional comments here. First of all, the movie is not a crossword puzzle to be deciphered by filling in the blank spaces. To his credit, Lynch leaves some of his spaces permanently void--not to be filled in at all, not even by the most ingenious exegete. Second, the film does have a recognizable subject, which is not Hollywood so much as the act of making motion pictures itself. The nearest thing to a narrative Ariadne's thread through the labyrinth of Mulholland Drive concerns the planned production of a new movie in Hollywood that even affords Lynch an opportunity to throw in a brilliant production number with 1950s decor that puts to shame anything in Moulin Rouge!
This highly fluid story line allows Lynch to cover a lot of territory, including a devastatingly funny look at present day movie financing as experienced by an arrogant, wannabe auteur. (I have the feeling the director was settling old scores in some of these scenes.) But what Mulholland Drive is ""about,"" is none of the areas the film passes through en route to its conclusion. Several famous movies about the movie industry--among them, not only Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, but also George Cukor's A Star Is Born, and Robert Mulligan's Inside Daisy Clover, based on the novel by Gavin Lambert--have dealt with the way stars become alienated in their screen images. Norma Desmond ends up acting out offscreen the goofy roles she played onscreen at the height of her fame, and at the end of A Star Is Born, the viewer might well want to ask, ""Who is the 'real' Mrs. Norman Maine?"" Esther Blodgett? Vicky Lester? But Lynch, I think, pushes the dialectic of images and identity considerably farther than any American director has done since Orson Welles made Citizen Kane and The Lady from Shanghai.
Revision is a characteristic mode of postmodernism. But often what starts as a homage--for example, to a traditional genre like the musical--almost involuntarily degenerates into parody, as Moulin Rouge! well illustrates. In the past, Lynch has not, in my opinion, always succeeded in walking this particular tightrope with the greatest of aplomb--the end of Wild at Heart seems to me an absolute disaster in that regard. But the ""revision"" here is truly ""re-vision,"" seeing over again film genres and Hollywood history, in a very large sense of the word, but most importantly ""re-viewing"" the ever problematic task of telling a story with images.",1020124800,,3587,4.911037891268534
1488861,3,B00005JKJA,"Before it became one of the most acclaimed films of 2001, David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" was actually going to be a television series (a la ""Twin Peaks"") before ABC scrapped the idea.  As a result, you get a film that's innovative and intriguing, but also plays like a sitcom at moments when it should be commandingly theatrical.  The performances of the lead actresses (Naomi Watts & Laura Harring) also seem weak and unconvincing (well, not convincing enough to see this 2 1/2 hour movie through), another element carried over from TV-land.
Plot: a woman named Rita is involved in a car wreck, gets amnesia, meets a Hollywood hopeful named Betty, and the rest of the movie follows their misadventures through Lynch's usual bizarre mindscape.  Examples of what you'll see during ""Mulholland Drive"": Midgets with links to the underworld(?); Cowboys who provide useful information; and retro 1950's dance numbers.
I've always found Lynch to be a pretty overrated director, stealing the thunder from other directors who do better work and get less credit (David Cronenberg comes to mind), but ""Mulholland Drive"" is clearly his best film since ""Blue Velvet,"" in part because it requires the focus of the viewer to piece together the mystery.  Unlike the self-indulgent, equally overlong ""Lost Highway,"" which was trickery told within the 'logic' of a dream, ""Mulholland Drive"" is hypnotic and complicated (where it counts).  Lynch's sense of humor is also more prominent here (note the cappucino scene).
It may raise more questions than it answers, but it IS an achievement in this day and age to see a movie that sticks in your head long after you've left the theater.  That's what ""Mulholland Drive"" has to offer.",1020124800,12,1714,5.060283687943262
1488862,4,B00005JKJA,"First, let me address the lack of chapter selections in this movie: bad choice.  Bad!  The movie is super long, and if you don't have time to watch the whole thing in one sitting, it would be nice if you could advance to the point where you had to leave off.  If there had been chapters, this movie would have gotten five stars.

Secondly, the plot of this movie doesn't matter.  At least, not to me.  While most movies tell a discernible story, Lynch films usually provide the viewer with a subjective experience unique to him or her.  When I'm watching a long, moody scene in a Lynch film, I feel like it's distorting my emotions, and as I ponder why things are happening on the screen, how the movie is mirroring life, I develop thoughts about how our world actually works.

Lynch portrays life in a way that is totally unique and genuinely interesting.  Mulholland Drive works not only on this level, but also as an original portrayal of Hollywood.  It also delivers quite a few genuinely funny moments.  Plus, the women in this movie are incredibly beautiful.

If it wasn't for the lack of chapters, definitely a five!  He went out on a limb, I know he wants you to watch the whole thing through, but you don't always have 3 hours to sit and watch a film.

Although the story and plot get really twisty,and occaissionally defy their own parameters,I think the critics just loved the performances so much,the rest could be overlooked! Yes,it's definitely a David Lynch film,but it's definitely a whole different animal. Laura Elena Harring,Naomi Watts, and Justin Theroux,all put in top notch performance in a tale of Amnesia,Murder,Blackmail,Hollywood,and a Lynch favourite: Duality. What is real and what is imagined? What do you see? Lynch supplies several clues in the DVD insert...good luck. I think what makes this film such a paradox,and hard to pin down,is it's history. ""Mulholland Drive"" was originally a television pilot,and it didn't get bought. That is why the film introduces numerous characters and sub-plots that don't get fully realized in the full length film.( He later brought back Harring & Watts to shoot additional footage,for the theatrical version.) I give Lynch a lot of credit for making the effort,and creating this odd and amusing little creature,it's fun & quirky,and you'll think about it.

1488951,4,B00005JKJA,"If ever a storyteller was irresistibly drawn toward the cinema and its camera's all-seeing eye, that person would be David Lynch.  ""Mulholland Drive"" uses the camera as an omniscient eye into the world of Hollywood filmmaking, utilizing the talents of three remarkable performers, Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux.
The film begins with Harring helplessly wandering the streets of Hollywood after a collision occurs on Mulholland Drive with the limousine in which she was riding, causing an explosion, after which she barely escapes with her life.  Lynch shrewdly uses the magnificent contours of Harring's face, accenting her perfectly sloped cheekbones, to achieve maximum benefit from a purposeful camera.  Laura Elena was the first Hispanic ever to win the Miss U.S.A. contest, after which she became a countess by marrying into the prominent Bismarck family.  At that point she began studying drama in London.  Her marriage ended and she pursued her film career vigorously, with Lynch providing her with a solid breakthrough performance.
Harring interacts in the film with the lovely blonde actress who won Breakthrough Performance of the Year honors from the National Film Board of Review resulting from her sterling effort in ""Mulholland Drive.""  Naomi Watts was born in England and raised in Australia.  After a decade of fervent effort to build a film career Lynch provided her with this solid break, with which she made good.  When Harring, unable to remember anything, occupies Watts' apartment shortly before her arrival by plane from Canada, the understanding young blonde woman immediately befriends her, inviting her to move in with her.  Watts, whose aunt, a famous actress, is the apartment's occupant, and is letting her use it while she is making a film in Canada, immediately assists Harring in seeking to uncover the mystery associated with her memory loss.
In the manner of Lynch, the film develops into a series of dramatic situations in which the viewer is confronted with the task of separating a dreamworld of illusion from reality.  As the film develops we learn that Watts and Harring are vying for the same starring role in a major film.
Justin Theroux enters the mix as a confused director.  Lynch is to be credited for never depicting Theroux as a raving lunatic, but rather someone who launches into bizarre behavior in a low key manner, rendering the character more uniquely effective.  Theroux remains outwardly calm no matter what happens, even after he is forcibly thrown out of his own Hollywood canyon home by the pool cleaner he finds in bed with his wife.
By the film's end Harring is enchanting everyone, male and female.  At one point Watts becomes jealous over her attention, along with her competition for a role she wants in the film Theroux is directing.  Theroux has been warned by the gangster element financially backing the film that he is duty bound to put Watts in the starring female role, leading to conflict.
One of the film's zaniest characters is a professional hit man with the efficiency level of Inspector Clousseau at his daffiest.  He is compelled to eliminate large numbers of people to cover up his staggering inefficiency.
Playing the role of the shrewd ""You can't fool me"" landlady of the apartment building where Watts and Harring stay is veteran Ann Miller, who starred in MGM musicals in the fifties.  She immediately sees through the flimsy explanation provided by Watts to justify Harring staying with her.  At one point the relationship between the two beautiful young women heats up into an erotic love sequence captured beautifully by Lynch's all-seeing camera.",1019952000,10,3653,5.102348993288591

If you're desperate to find that certain scene hit the 30x search. Sheesh.

This film is so obviously Lynchian, in all it's twists and memory erasing turns.  I suppose I didn't like it simply because I didn't get it, that may seem like a bad reason but it's true.  Some of the moments were worth seeing, the Silencio sequence, but most was just a bunch of hooey.  I felt as if I needed Cliffs notes to figure out what really went on.  The performances were quite good, and it looked really great, with great direction by Lynch, but in the end, I just didn't get it!",1019779200,,615,4.161016949152542
1488955,4,B00005JKJA,"After the ridiculously good Straight Story, Lynch has gone back to his old bag of tricks.  That isn't a bad thing of course.  No filmmaker has ever been able to make a film seem like a dream like Lynch.  He seems to be able to make it seem surreal without even trying.  His view of Hollywood as a dark, twisted, skewed netherworld coincides with this dream-like journey.  The suns out but its dark everywhere.  It didn't surprise me to learn that this was once an ABC TV pilot, the first 100 minutes are engaging stuff that I would have tuned in to see.  Its got the patented Lynch weirdness, the espresso scene is just so bizarre that I couldn't help but laugh.  Also the [messed]-up murder was morbidly humorous.  The sequence in the beginning in the coffee shop is why I love Lynch, it is a dream, it is so disturbing without actually being disturbing, its the atmosphere, its indescribable, and I'm becoming a meandering pretentious loon. The ""narrative"" involves Rita and Betty, Rita is suffering from amnesia which sounds contrived but this is Lynch and it doesn't matter.  They form a common bond and their quest to find out who Rita really is had me [pulled] in.  They navigate the twisted landscape of Hollywood together.  The other main player is a director who looks suspiciously like Steven Soderbergh or at least the glasses make it look that way.  The events that transpire don't really conjoin, just exist.  But what everyone talks about is the ending, where everything becomes a free-for-all of identity exchange, lesbianism, and violence.  It doesn't make sense, and no sense is supposed to be made I guess.  I just sat back and watched it all unfold, not really caring about the ending because I knew it wouldn't make sense.  I could probably come to some conclusion about the meaning of it all, but everyone should come up with their own.  And that is why Lynch is such an essential filmmaker, no one will ever do it like he does, and no one ever has.  People can debate the meaning of his films for all of eternity and never agree, and that alone makes this film a worthwhile entry in the Lynch legacy.",1019779200,2,2122,4.595744680851064

And the answers might not be the same for every viewer. David Lynch is not always, or even often, on target, but when he is--Hoo Boy. I walked around for the next two days trying to fit the individual scenes together.

1489018,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch.  Either you love him or hate him, there is no middle ground.  Mulholland Drive is yet another nightmare from the warped mind of David Lynch.  If you liked Twin Peaks or Blue Velvet, and you haven't seen this, you need to see it.  If you enjoyed Lost Highway, enjoyed the tense moments from the most mundane happenings, then by all means, see this movie.  If none of the above really moved you at all, didn't freaked you out, you probably won't enjoy Mulholland Drive.
It involves two women, Rita, a bombshell brunette who as a result of a life saving car accident, is an amnesiac.  And Betty, the blonde, naive, idealistic, ""coming to Hollywood to be discovered"" stereotype. As the two women struggle to try and decipher Rita's identity, all the work done in the movie for the viewer, character and plot development is almost entirely undone.  It's decipherable, but it's going to take a few viewings.  This is a great movie to watch for those classic Lynch moments, the opening of Rita's purse after she meets Betty, the initial discovery of Diane Selwick, and the entire scene inside Club Silencio.
Lynch was nominated for Best director for this film, again verifying that he is one of the foremost in Avant Garde filmmaking today.  He goes a little easy on us, providing in the inlay, 10 clues for unlocking the mystery of this movie.  Lynch also does one last subtle trick, that i can't help thinking is intentional.  He allows for NO scene selection. He allows only one way to watch this movie, from beginning to end, as one 2 1/2 hour chapter on the dvd.",1019692800,,1573,4.622302158273381

Then it's flashback, showing the true relationship between the two women (and showing you who the other characters really are). Finally, in the last few minutes, it's reality, where the protagonist realizes the full import of what she's done, and ends it.
I had to see it three times before I figured all this out. But, oh, Lord, wasn't it a great movie?  Funny, erotic, brilliantly conceived, acted and filmed.

There are absolutely no scene selections! The entire film is just one chapter! Now, this would be simply nit-picking if this were any other movie, but Mulholland Drive requires the viewer to watch and rewatch many key scenes. Without a chapter selection, you might as well be watching the VHS tape. The only good thing about this DVD is that in the insert in the case, they give 10 ""clues"" on figuring out what the movie is all about. But those can easily be dug up on the internet.
In this film, a woman finds herself on Mulholland Drive outside Hollywood, suffering from amnesia. She befriends an aspiring actress and together they attempt to find out who she is. Meanwhile, a timid film director is slowly losing control of his life and the answer to all his problems lies on a journey to a mysterious man known only as ""The Cowboy.""
The Cowboy is an intresting character, as is every other character in MD, in the way that Lynch only tells us so much about him, but leaves the rest to our imaginations. This keeps The Cowboy as mysterious as possible, which the film intends.
As in all David Lynch films, there are some very disturbing elements: there are numerous twisted lesbian sex scenes, there is a small restaurant in which a disgusting troll inhabits the garbage dumpster of, and there is a brutal car crash at the beginning of the film.

People have assaulted me to tell me how much they hated it, but I can only attribute their  responses to the fact that you need to think about this one instead of swallowing it whole: for them I highly recommend the new release of the recut E.T.  Lynch's films traditionally require you to fling yourself through the air and to throw away any preconceived notions of Hollywood narrative - you yourself as the audience needs to exist in the surreal with as little grasp on the confines of this material world as possible.  If you can do that, Mulholland Dr. is quite a ride.
I love this movie.  It has haunted me since I first saw it and it compels you to view it repeatedly. Naomi Watts is phenomenal and deserved the Oscar nod for her work here, as did Lynch.  Ever since my first viewing, I have felt elated that something so brilliant and magnetic was created.
The DVD is does not have the bells and whistles of most new releases, which does make me sad, because I am so intrigued about what the original TV pilot was like, what changed, behind the scenes stuff, etc.  But I can live.  I do wish that the DVD did have chapter search - once I accidentally clicked the remote and it returned me back to the menu, where I had to manually search through the disk.  I can understand Lynch's opinion that the movie should be experienced in total, yet now, as a freaky fan,  I wish I had the opportunity to revisit individual scenes.

I laughed out loud all the way home from the theater about the subtleties, nuances, incredibly wonderful acting and the amazing convoluted plot. (And then immediately ordered the DVD.) Lynch maintains a sweetly painful tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat for 2-1/2 hours. It is a many layered film. In addition to the obvious love story told in psuedo flashback, what no one has seemed to get from this film is that it is the history of Hollyweird told through Hollywood clich.

However, by the time you make it back to the the real world you get to appreciate just how great it all was.  This movie is not titled Mulholland Drive just because of the events that take place on that road in the movie.
This is a movie to make you think, it plays with you as a viewer, never giving in easy. In the end it all makes sense, you just have to watch it, pay attention to the details, watch it again and keep an open mind (read some of the reviews if you need help or hints).
If you like to sit back and passively watch the movie while being fed the storyline, go watch something else.  But if you like being challenged by the film, to be part of the film, then buy this (don't rent it, just buy it, you'll watch it many times).  Like a Borges or Cortazar story, the story forces you to think, consider the possibilities, watch and rewatch it (read and reread).  It's very well made and DOES NOT have holes (if you need help understanding, surf the net, but don't give in easily).
The DVD itself keeps the movie pure to the theater, because you can't skip chapters (the DVD has 1 chapter, 2.5 hrs long).  But then again, if Mr. Lynch allowed you to do that it would be cheating.

1489076,5,B00005JKJA,"Without fail, it seems those who see Mulholland Drive have a knee-jerk reaction in one of two ways: (a) they think it's pointless and stupid and weird and they're completely baffled by it, or (b) they become entranced and absorbed...and they're completely baffled by it.
The first time I saw this movie, I was in the (b) category. I couldn't explain it, I couldn't put it together, but I loved it. It begins with two story threads that are ostensibly unrelated. In one, a woman called ""Rita"" has lost her memory and -- with the help of a bold, aspiring actress named Betty -- tries to find out who she is. In the other, there appears to be a mysterious operation in Hollywood surrounding the casting process of a young director's latest movie. A number of weird scenes are interspersed amidst these two plot threads and seemingly have nothing to do with anything. In the final half hour, the movie's world is twisted around and by the time it ends, the viewer will probably be left scratching his head. Less patient viewers will probably start swearing like drunken sailors and break something (or maybe go watch Independence Day).
I was completely enthralled by every second of this film, but I needed to wait for the DVD before I could see it again and begin to try and understand it. I've seen it several times now and while I'm not much closer to understanding it, I love it just the same. I've read a number of interpretations of this movie that suggest anything from ""it's all a dream"" to ""it's about how Hollywood corrupts"" to ""IT MAKES NO SENSE."" At the time of this writing, I've just watched it for the fourth time, and I must assert that there is a certain purpose behind everything, even the scenes which are the weirdest of weird. However, I cannot come up with a comprehensive understanding of this movie that elucidates _all_ its different elements. On one hand, the entire experience seems remarkably dream-like, almost a cinematic montage of self-contained, powerful episodes with a tenuous relationship to other scenes. On the other hand, though the movie appears to be sundered into two distinct parts, there is a definite connection to be made. A very fun movie to explore.
Naomi Watts' performance (as Betty) is absolutely stunning. If Halle Barry hadn't been so good in Monster's Ball, I'd have said Miss Watts deserved the Oscar for Best Actress in 2001 (I don't even know if she was nominated...but the Oscars are dumb anyway). Think carefully about Betty's acting audition...it's one of the theme's pillars.
Can you ""cut the Gordian knot"" of Mulholland Drive? In other words, can anyone solve the puzzle of this movie? I'm honestly not sure anyone can -- there's a 5000+ word analysis out there on the Internet that is quite great, but even it can't account for everything. There may not be a complete answer at all. Maybe this movie just resists sound reasoning entirely. But it sure is great.
The bottom line? Watch the movie, I guess. You might think it's the dumbest film ever made, or get consumed by the mystery of it all.
The DVD itself is pretty weak feature-wise. No scene selection, for one thing, which is pretty much inexcusable. It's made so much worse for the fact that there are a number of very poignant scenes that just beg repeated viewings. Other than that, you get the obligatory DVD features with no appreciable extras.

Well, it's intentional. David Lynch doesn't like Chapter breaks, so none of his DVDs have them. He wants you to sit down and watch the whole movie, from beginning to end.
The movie doesn't have a director's commentary, because Lynch wants you to figure out for yourself what the movie is about.",1019347200,,412,4.9

The real, actual story does not begin until right after Rita/Camilla gets [pulled] into the blue box (possibly meant to symbolize a screen/movie/TV) and The Cowboy tells the corpse on the bed to wake up (as Diane, who ""Betty"" has been all along).  In simplest form: Betty/Diane was a so-so actress and star-wannabe who lost out on a part to Rita/Camilla and was jealous of her.  The two of them did become friends (from Rita/Camilla's perspective) and did mess with a lesbian relationship (which Betty/Diane took very seriously and which Rita/Camilla did not take so seriously).  Betty/Diane became increasingly dejected at her botched sexual relationship as well as her jealousy for the way Hollywood works for people like Rita/Camilla.  Betty/Diane was briefly thrilled (I think) to hold Rita/Camilla's hand as they walked through the brush up to the party, but she was immediately horrified to realize Rita/Camilla was to marry Adam, the director.  In fact, Betty/Diane was so hurt that she decided
to hire the assassin to kill Rita/Diane so that she could get on with her own life.  The hitman said Betty/Diane would receive the blue key once the hit had taken place.  She receives the key, but then it's discovered that the hit hasn't gone as planned and ""the girl is missing"" (which is what takes place at the technical beginning of the movie)--we know that Betty/Diane has been called about this because of the red lampshade next to
the phone at the beginning--the very red lampshade and phone we later learn are in Betty/Diane's apartment.  Betty/Diane has spent her last dime to have Rita/Camilla killed, and it didn't work.  Betty/Diane loses her marbles and kills herself (the elderly couple, I think, represent the American Viewing Audience).  Right after the opening credits we get the weird scene, from the camera's viewpoint, of someone flopping onto a red pillow and some unidentified heavy breathing.
It is Betty/Diane falling (dead or else just stoned) onto her own bed.  A friend of mine thinks, and I tend to agree, that at her moment of death, Betty/Diane's spirit goes to get the amnesiac Rita/Camilla and take her to her own dead body (which is why, in the first half of the film, Rita is the only one who screams at the sight of the body--she's really just discovered her former lover/friend dead: the realest show, the realest version of the Spanish singer falling dead away after her own taped singing: the ultimate act of being overcome).  And death is the one act you really get one chance to do right/convinciningly.  Or something.
It's very annoying the DVD has no chapter selection.",1019260800,18,2617,4.920454545454546
1489081,4,B00005JKJA,"""Mulholland Drive"" is about dreams--both kinds.  The kind we have at night and the ones we wish while we're awake.
The dream of a successful career in Hollywood has motivated many, mostly to their extreme disappointment.  How such may become tragedy is the driving force behind the film, and what makes it worthwhile.
The dreams at night, mostly the dreadful ones, are Lynch's stock in trade.  They are expertly portrayed in the film, even a few humorous ones.  They stick in the mind, disturbingly, for days.  They are acceptable as a character-development device, but as Lynch goes overboard in trying to titillate weirdness addicts, he distances the majority of even intellegent and discerning moviegoers.  Why do that, when he has something to say about the first kind of dream, our hopes when awake?  A shame, given the superb cinematography and acting.  A shame, when zombie-like pacing, appropriate for the dreadful dreams, numbs those who might otherwise have appreciated the film more.  The thud-chord musical score doesn't help, either.
For it's overemphasis on the dreadful dream, the film may remain the cult favorite of young figure-it-outers, but never become an accepted masterpiece of cinema.  On the other hand, for figure-it-outers who would like a TRULY profound experience of substance, I recommend Von Trier's ""Zentropa.""",1019260800,,1342,5.258215962441315
1489082,5,B00005JKJA,"I've decided that this is my favorite Lynch film, but it is an aquired taste nonetheless. I saw this film several times when it was in theaters and a couple more since it was released on DVD. I really don't care about the whole thing about the blurring of Laura Herring's private area (David Lynch even admitted he did that on purpose to prevent perverts from exploiting it) or the whole one chapter DVD thing. Mr. Lynch is demanding you to watch the film in its entirety. What's so bad about that? I was actually ANGRY when Lynch got Oscar nominated. Only then would an ununderstanding mainstream actually watch this film, only to gripe about they didn't ""get it."" I would insist that the serious film-watcher not listen to anything those people have to say. I was also very disappointed when I heard that this wasn't going to be a television show since I had loved ""Twin Peaks"" so much, but Lynch is a cinema person. Network television just doesn't deserve his talents. I still hoped he would release the pilot in some fashion. Then I heard he won Best Director at Cannes. I wondered what the lovely was going on. As it turned out, the project turned out to be a surrealist gem! I think most of it makes sense. I've tried explaining what I think the ""meaning"" is, but not many people will listen b/c I guess more people want to pay attention to b.s. like ""Zoolander"" or ""Panic Room."" I've heard every theory from the film is just a ... meditation on how modern Hollywood is the destruction of Zen to the whole thing is actually taking place in the 1950's and is the realization of the film that the director is casting. Whatever the ""real"" meaning, I think the whole thing is perfect! The music and cinematography is GORGEOUS and deserves EVERY AWARD in the the book! It is definitely Lynch's sexiest with beautiful locations, occasional Spanish language and lovely female physiques on display everywhere. It certainly surpasses the boredom that ""Lost Highway,"" ""Eraserhead,"" and ""Dune"" conveyed and the love theme is stronger than the ones in ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Wild At Heart."" I'm not quite sure if this is better than ""Elephant Man,"" and ""Straight Story,"" but they don't count since those were TRUE stories. ""Mulholland Dr."" seems to be total surrealism with realistic moral messages involving obsession, unrealistic dreams and mortality. There is a lingering grim sadness floating throughout the narrative, particularly in the second part (probably b/c of how ABC treated Lynch after he delivered the pilot). I'm really not quite sure what to make of that stupid blue key or whatever it is supposed to ""open up,"" and the ending IS just a tad too hokey with the loss-of-innocence and embracing-of-the-abyss metaphors for my tastes. But what the film did for me was open up the possibilities of cinema (independent or mainstream) and suggested that imagination does actually exist and is necessary for survival even in this day and age. Naomi and Laura were really great too, especially in bed (tee hee)! You go Lynch!",1019260800,,3022,4.780114722753346
1489083,4,B00005JKJA,"True to form, David Lynch has directed another controversial masterpiece that is will stun and shock some, absorb and mesmerize others, and infuriate and frustrate the rest.  It is a film that will elicit strong and binary reactions: few will rate this movie as ""average"" or simply ""OK"".  Like the rare novel that lurks in the fringes of your subconscious, ""Mulholland Drive"" will not easily go away.  And like great poetry, ""MH"" succeeds not in telling a story, but in leaving sufficient doubt to allow the viewer provoke and stimulate, forcing the viewer to draw their own conclusions.
The plot?  Suffice to say it is a story of love gone bad, of murder, deceit, and humanity at the depraved pinnacle of Hollywood sleaze.  Complicated, nonlinear, convoluted, and garish, it is definitely not your average big screen tale of good guys and bad guys with simple, happy (or even conclusive) ending.  It includes the patented Lynch surrealism that seems to bounce from dream to reality.  The acting is versatile and deep. While initially the actors seem to be playing their roles like some bizarre ""Father Knows Best""-on-acid 1950's camp, by the end, it all (well, most all), begins to make sense, and the bizarre behavior falls nicely into the ultimate story line.
If you're looking for a simple, linear, mind numbing piece of eye-candy, don't come here.  There are plenty of one-star reviews to read that capture the frustration and absence of coherency many will feel.

Together, they brought to the fabric of the movie a soft silk - which held up well to the sometimes harsh imagery in the movie. Bravo also to Naomi Watts for giving us the sweet character ""Betty"" who reverts to the ""Diane"" in reality. What a mind blower!  I've seen almost all of Mr. Lynch's movies - and liked them all.  But this one is more memorable - and definitely more womanly than his other films.  The actors believably navigate the depth of human emotion that Mr. Lynch intended.

1489155,5,B00005JKJA,"Despite the fact that this DVD fails to deliver in the way of ""extras"" or even a chapter select option, I can't bring myself to give it anything other than five stars.  It earns my highest possible recommendation solely on the strength of the film itself.

David Lynch has outdone himself.  He continues to enthrall and mesmerize.  I've finally figured out why I love his movies so much:  they're not predictable, an unheard-of feat in today's dismal industry of overhyped, manufactured commercialism and tired formula filmmaking.

Mulholland Drive is a tale of the classic Hollywood Dream gone horribly awry.  It drips with mystery, style, and eroticism.  Its dizzying complexity and unorthodox structure have led many to dismiss it as pretentious arthouse fluff.  However, once the layers of cryptic, sophisticated storytelling are recognized and unravelled, the story is remarkably solid and explains itself completely.

The stunning and divine Laura Harring seamlessly pulls off the split role of Rita/Camilla.  But the real wonder is watching Naomi Watts convince us at the beginning that she's a lousy actress... and then proving us dead wrong.

The film starts with a relatively sound theme of suspense, and this is the story line that is never developed. There are numerous outtakes (for lack of a better description), which are quite audacious, sharp and theatrical. The acting is good. The ending confirms what you might suspect mid way through the film that the whole thing is dysfunctional.

1489157,5,B00005JKJA,"Let me give Mulholland Drive a whirl...A compassionate director (Lynch) hates that his hands are often tied by associate producers when it comes to making films. One of the aspects he hates most is when talented, beautiful, and young would-be starlets are overlooked in the casting process. It happens often. One day a particularly appropriate actress has to be ignored by Lynch, despite the fact she's perfect. When he goes home, his conscience rips him apart and even spills over into his dreams. He can't help but wonder is she still ok? Did she take it hard? Did she eventually make it or go over the deep end? Fortunately, that artist--David Lynch--has a medium through which he can vent his frustrations and fears. The result: Mulholland Drive--Lynch's frustrations, fears, nightmares, hopes, and ultimately a tribute to the starlets that never were. There used to be three, now there's four: Fellini's ""8 1/2"", Allen's ""Manhatten"", Fosse's ""All That Jazz"" and now Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"".

1489158,4,B00005JKJA,"Have anyone of you ever dreamed about people in your lives but those people seem to have taken on different roles during your dreams? This, I think, is what happened in Mulholland Drive. The movie makes a lot of sense if you try to connect all the points starting from the end to the beginning which is a dream sequence.
Diane is an actress trying to score big roles in Hollywood. She's in love with Camilla Rhodes who has gotten a lead role in director Adam's movie. Camilla has broken up with Diane to marry Adam. Heartbroken and filled with jeolousy, Diane wants to have Camilla killed and hires a killer to do the job.
This brings us to the beginning of the movie which I interprets as a dream of Diane that is very skewed on reality, but aren't all dreams like that? In the opening sequence, Rita/Camilla is nearly murdered (what Diane wants) but managed to escape with only a head wound that causes amnesia. She wondered into the life of Betty/Diane (bec. even in dreams, Diane wants to be with her).
We also see how the professional life of director Adam is wrecked and is forced to hire Camilla Rhodes as his new lead actress. This, I think, is what Diane wanted Adam's real life to be as punishment for stealing her Camilla. Adam is forced to hire only Camilla Rhodes bec. that is exactly what happened to him in real life -- Camilla Rhodes is Adam's new lead. However, the Camilla Rhodes in Diane's dream resembled Diane bec. Diane has hoped to be the new lead.
Diane also dreamed about the man whom she hires to murder Camilla. In her dream, she dreamed of the man knocking off a few anoymous people in an old building. As for the monster in the alleyway of Winkie's, that is what Diane has become -- a monster after she arranged to kill Camilla. This was in the last scene of the movie when Diane's face and the monster's merged as one.
This is my interpretation of the movie.",1019001600,7,1888,4.412607449856734

i wouldn't characterize myself as a particularly emotional person, but the last time i watched ""mulholland drive"" in its entirety (just last night, it so happens), i was left in tears.  i really feel that this film is not just some elaborate con game that lynch is playing on his audience, as some of my fellow, rather embittered reviewers have claimed. it's not some smug, showy, empty Display with a capital ""D"" in the vein of ""the usual suspects.""
for me, at least, the real resonance of this film rests in the character arc of diane selwyn. the australian actress naomi watts is nothing less than startling in her portrayal of one young woman's devastating transformation at the hands of the hollywood ""dream factory."" it's a real testament to naomi's formidable talent that many of the people that i've seen this film with were not quick to recognize her in the latter section of the film. they thought that she had become a different person. and, indeed, she had.
the true beauty, the true power of this film, for me, lies in the mental juxtaposition of two images: one is of a disheveled diane selwyn standing in the kitchen of her dim apartment, clad in an old, dirty night gown, holding a brown coffee cup, her body shaking before the hallucinatory image of the lover she thought she had lost forever; the other is one that lynch closes the film with -- diane and camilla together, beaming with happiness, basking in the hollywood glow of moviestardom. this latter image fades away and we are brought back to the club silencio, in which the blue-haired madam of truth, reality, and an almost cruel justice declares that all is again silent.",1019001600,27,2014,4.721590909090909

It is really pretentious, and that is reflective of Lynch's maddened little artiste's ego.  Whatever you say about Mulholland Drive's message about the moral malleability of Hollywood and how it strives to twist human issues for monetary gain, Lynch only portrays this message on a level visible to those educated in the cryptography of the arthouse film.  He doesn't, and never has cared to speak to an intellectual audience that is interested in smart films but doesn't have the time to sit through unending viewings of Eraserhead and Begotten. There's a certain amount of talent involved in making a film palatable, and I would say that Lynch has decided to distance himself from it in order to create for himself a dedicated fan base who in good turn built him an ivory tower.

She wanted to come to Hollywood and become a star, which in her dream she has all the makings of one.  In the dream she helps Rita who needs her desperately to find out what happened in her accident.  Rita also gives all control to ""Betty"" until Club Silencio.

Rita/Camilla is the star who stole her thunder and her heart.  So to get revenge she hires a hit man to knock her off. About 10 min into the the second third when Diane has her roommate remove her stuff from her apartment there is a jump in time as to Diane remembering how things really went down with Camilla.  You can discern this because the roommate picked up her ashtray yet when Diane and Camilla are having hot and bothered sex the ashtray is very much present.  Diane is then rapt with confusion, guilt, and completely depressed over the fact that she does not know herself, she was not a strong actress or a good enough lover to keep Camilla.

I have to give it up to the actors though: they really got into their characters and acted quite convincingly. That goes especially for Naomi Watts (Betty/Diane) who manages to play two characters that are diametrically opposite of each other, both with the same gusto.

However, if you just like watching movies, Mulholland Drive may be a little (or a lot) frustrating to watch.",1018828800,2,789,4.524475524475524
1489290,3,B00005JKJA,"but also hard to stop watching!
I generally am not a fan of Lynch's work.  I think his movies are extremely bizarre and the story always hard to follow because of the weird fashion they seem to be in.
While this movie did have me totally lost, I was intrigued by the story. Naomi Watts plays ""Betty"", a fresh faced girl who has just moved to L.A. to make it as an actress.  I appreciate films about the making of actors, but this goes beyond that. She meets ""Rita"", who has been involved in a nasty car accident(This is the start of the film). Rita has lost her memory, and Betty decides to help her figure out who she is.
Do we really ever find out who ""Rita"" really is?  I watched this movie three days ago, and I still don't know.  This movie was confusing, really confusing.  I think they were going back and forth in time, but the viewer doesn't really know for sure.  At least I didn't.
There are some really strange characters, as with every Lynch project, that join Betty and Rita along the way to figuring out the truth about Rita's life. This is a twisted tale of Hollywood.
Both actresses were excellent, and Justin Theroux, who plays a director in the film, was very good. I just saw him in a play in Boston, and he is a great actor.
It's been so long since I've watched any of Lynch's other work, but I think only diehard fans of his will truly appreciate this film.  It's extremely hard to follow but at the same time it's interesting.  I found myself engrossed in it, and wanting to know what the turnout would be.  I'm still trying to figure it out.",1018828800,,1565,4.277966101694915
1489291,1,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite movies, but I regret that I cannot recommend buying the Mulholland Drive DVD. Though reasonable in theory, David Lynch's decision to present the entire film as one chapter on the DVD is in fact a terrible idea, for reasons of unfortunate technical reality.
If you a typical blundering idiot like me, you sometimes scratch a CD or DVD. If your DVD player finds a scratch, it can freak out and jump to the beginning of the current chapter. Woe be the David Lynch fan, for his scratch will deliver him back to the beginning of Mulholland Drive, from whence he has to fast-forward to find his place again. Talk about a breach of cinematic continuity.
My advice is to (a) rent it while some copies are still scratchless (b) buy it on VHS or (c) be vewwy cayfow with your Mulholland Drive DVD. Don't lend it to any David Cronenberg fans.",1018828800,,870,4.512658227848101

One deeply personal and the other one ruthlessly professional. When these two worlds collide, the results are tragic. I wouldn't say that this film is a criticism of Hollywood as a previous reviewer did - that would be too literal - I think it's more about what happens when passions run too deep and people loose their way in a world of self made delusion.",1018828800,,488,4.686046511627907
1489293,4,B00005JKJA,"First of all, let me make this clear: I REALLY enjoyed this movie! The sets, the color, the direction and especially the performances were all first rate. I do, however, have some ideas and thoughts about what was presented on screen. Word has it that this was to be a television series that Lynch was working on. Whether it was being shopped around or whether it had a network behind it, I do not know. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, the plug was pulled. Mr. Lynch was then faced with a dilemma: shelf it or try to condense it into a feature film. Obviously, the choice was to save this story as a film. I do believe, however, that there are many instances where the viewer can see the results of the failed television series. To wit:
1) Robert Forster plays a detective that is in the movie for all of 2 minutes and delivers one line. I do not believe that Lynch would insult a fairly well-known actor by asking him to deliver one line. I believe this character was to be seen much more during the series. 2) The entire ""this girl gets the part"" storyline, which started off so fascinating, dried up and blew away. It seemed much to intriguing to just drop. Plus, again, you have Dan Hedaya, a fine actor, delivering one or two lines. I don't buy that it was planned that way. Television series. 3) The whole scene concerning the thug stealing the black book. Obviously, that book should have had some signifigance. And yet, that entire scene can be removed from the movie and no one would know the difference. 4) The ""Cowboy"". Lynch sets up what may well be the most interesting character in the movie....and then does nothing with him. The ""Cowboy"" warns that ""...if you see me again once, you've done good, if you see me again twice, you've done bad..."". I realize we get a brief glimpse of him later, but I have to believe Lynch had bigger and better things planned for this character. Television series.
Now, that said, let us give Lynch immense credit for piecing together a movie that is thought-provoking, thoughtful and one-of-a-kind. For him to be able to put together a movie of unfinished pieces into an Oscar nominated (director) film is absolutely a stunning achievement.",1018828800,,2197,4.592875318066158

Not because it makes sense, but because it has some moments that will enchant you and moments that will change your life forever. David Lynch has already blown me away, but he blew me away even further. From the moment you hear the words ""Silencio. No hay banda,"" your world as you know it will never be the same again. There is a version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" in Spanish that will leave you always wanting to see that movie again just for that scene.

But he pulled off a remarkable, unique, beautiful, disgusting, sick,..., artful film that was worthy of a best director nomination.  And all of the clues are there in the context of the film to solve this a twisted plot.  Bravo Mr. Lynch!  The DVD version is outstanding but the theater experience can't be captured on disc.

The following scene is Betty sleeping in bed. The cowboy comes in and says, time to wake up pretty girl, giving away the clue that the first part of the movie is all a dream. Other clues are the two girls at club silencio, where the theme at the club is what you see is not what you get. Everything that transpires there is a test of our perception. Much like what we are watching is too a test of our preception, an illusion. Another clue is at Betty's first acting audition.  Before she starts her lines the director says, don't make it real until it's real.  This movie clearly becomes real once the box is opened.

He also did the music pretty good. The acting was good. Those two lead actress (who I've never seen before) both are good and could a good carrer if they are in the right movies and get good breaks. Most of the cast was good. Dan Hedya was not in the film enough tho. Billy Ray Crus did a good job in his two scenes. There were some people in the movie that were not that good. The stroy line & plot are good and really original. The beging of the film was kind of slow but then it picked uped and was good. But the last 25 mintues are defintly the highlight of the movie. Most of the 147 mintues good buy good expect for those slow parts. I expected a better DVD for this movie tho. Becuase it did well for indie film.

1489358,2,B00005JKJA,"For all its attempts at being one of the most immersive and mesmerizing mood pieces to come along in eons, David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" does little to to bring its viewers into its delusional world of chaotic bewilderment. The film feels flat when it should feel restless, it moves with the pace of a corpse, it supplies us with characters we can only go so far with, and it ends on a note of surprisingly moronic uncertainty that Lynch tries to pass off as brilliance.
I give the director credit for two things: his ability to intrigue us with enough subplots in the film's beginning, and for supplying us with two characters we are willing to get to know. It opens with ominous, graceful shots of a luxurious car making its way along Mulholland Drive, set to an eerie, unsettling score that sets the tone for dread. Inside the car is a woman; all we know about her is what we see, from her brown hair and accentuated lips, to her wandering eyes, which speak volumes with a simple glance.
There is an accident soon after, leaving the two men in the car with her dead. She stumbles out of the car, meanders down the hillside to the city streets below, and makes her way to a Sunset Boulevard apartment complex, where she takes refuge in an apartment whose owner has just departed for places unknown to us.
Who is this woman? What secrets does she withhold in her now-absent memory? The mystery becomes all-the-more engrossing when Betty (Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress making her way to Hollywood, arrives, setting up home in her aunt's apartment, where she discovers Rita (Laura Harring), the amnesiac who cannot remember who she is or where she was going before the accident. The more Betty questions Rita about the incident, the more she, as well as the audience, becomes involved in wanting to know more about this woman's agenda.
Lynch does a commendable job in setting up the film with enough mystery and low-key suspense that the audience has no choice but to become hooked. But then the road begins to get rocky: the story introduces three separate subplots, one of which carries a small amount of intrigue. There's the director, played by Justin Theroux, whose film is in jeopardy of being shut down due to his unwillingness to hire a certain actress; we meet two men in a diner, one of whom describes a nightmarish vision, only to relive it as he leaves; then we bear witness to a multiple killing, before which two men discuss a car accident, possibly the same accident that took Rita's memory.
The introduction of these nagging story lines tends to take away the focus from the two central characters, though all of them, supposedly, have a place in Lynch's master plan of weaving things together in the final third of the film. As the movie ambles along at an alarmingly dreary pace, we watch as Rita begins remembering fragments of her past, leading the two women on a journey to discovering the truth. Along the way, we are supplied with a barrage of scenes and sequences that carry no substantial weight in terms of story, from Betty's audition for a movie role, a scene whose interest level resembles that of driftwood, and a lesbian love scene, which does nothing for characterization or plot.
Of course, such no-holds-barred scenes are Lynch's stock in trade, and he shows no mercy in pumping the film full of such dream-like instances, leading up to his third act, a tour de force of incoherence and confusion that leaves its viewers with more questions than answers. The film takes its characters, those we have gone the distance with and have come to care for on a small level, and throws them into a ludicrous mix of reversed identity, jealousy, layering itself until it becomes too much to care about.
One would think that a movie that keeps you guessing until its finale is worthy of praise, but ""Mulholland Drive"" is that unique dead-end of a movie that only keeps one's interest in the hopes that things will improve. The dark imagery, the sense of the unknown, the creepiness of what lies ahead, all becomes squandered once the big psychological showdown crowns the film in a blaze of murkiness and banality. Overall, Lynch does prove that there's a difference between being skillful and intelligent, and being skillful and manipulative; you be the judge.",1018656000,4,4290,4.728971962616822

1489360,4,B00005JKJA,"First off, right or wrong David Lynch considers himself an aritst and has made some very specific requests about the release of some of his films on DVD (Straight Story, Fire Walk with Me, and Mulholland Drive): basically to let the films speak for themselves.  In Honoring this request, the DVD producers have left off much supplemental material than consumers have goten used to, and briefly censored one shot (Again directly at Lynch's Request).  This DVD as released BEST represents the vision of the director in releasing it in this medium.
As to whether or not the film makes sense, It Does.  Once the film is over there is a clear narrative line that informs every moment of the film and brings all the chaos into sharp focus.  What is it well that is for the viewer to figure out, Art has ALWAYS been about the viewer.  Is what finally turns out to be the story worth what David has done here?  yes and no.  Of David's surreal films (Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive) this is the simplest and in many ways least interesting, with reality bending in relatively few ways.  Of his accessable films (Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Straight Story) this ranks as the least involving.  Soo what do we have here?  A mixed attempt to bridge the gap perhaps.  In many respects the film is a mutant, it started as a TV project and evolved into a film in post production, it is largely told in a linear straightforward fashion, only really pulling lynchisms in the final act.  While explicit sexuality is shown, it is in many respects the most ""normal"" sort of any in his films while simultaneously being, in the ""real"" world very fetishized and poorly understood.
The film likely has legs in that it will probably be better appreciated in time, much like Fire Walk With Me has gained appreciation with the passage of time, but the fact remains that while the film is a good one and succeeds at most of what it is trying to attempt, if only in retrospect, it shares, with lost highway, a tendency to be modest in its ambitions.  Eraserhead, Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Fire Walk With Me, and Straight Story all had some significant and deeply felt things to say about the human condition and said them with a force not usually felt in Hollywood.  Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive have some things to say about Lynch's LA and share some ideas about the craft of narrative and film, and similar dream physics, but there the impact of the film largely ends.  The kinds of depth in mindscape that Lynch wants to play with here, and is trying to develop with his surrealist lens, is akin to Cronenberg's but for now lacks Cronenberg's precision, and scope.  In short while the potential exists for Lynch's surreal films to ultimately be mindshatteing and world changing, right now they are merely important artistic constructs.
The film IS a good one and David is doing a great job, but what this film is hinting at and is promising to eventually deliver makes this effort seem thin and pale, like Motzart composing a TV commercial jingle, yeah the genius and skill and brilliance is there, but what they really should be working on is the epic concerto and opera.",1018656000,5,3191,4.6512455516014235

Although I'm still not sure which character is dreaming about his/her nightmare, but the dream within a dream concept is clearly established with the opening shot of the extreme close-ups of the bedsheets and a medium shot of Rita, falling asleep under the dining table in Betty's Aunt's apartment.

I was totally baffled seeing it in the theater and now with the DVD I'll be able to watch it again and again and maybe one day I'll understand every detail of the plot. Everything's there, but it's up to the audience to figure it all out.
As for all the pathetic complaints about something so mundane as chapter stops, I have to ask the question, why does anyone feel they really need them for this film? Is it merely just because other DVDs have them? Well, on a ton of other DVDs it makes sense, but I can't imagine trying to break down MULHOLLAND DRIVE into separate chapters. I really don't consider the whole movie a bunch of scenes put together. I only see the movie as a complete whole. David Lynch was right on the money when he backed up his work by saying that. How do you jump to a random scene in MULHOLLAND DRIVE anyway? How could you start watching this movie from any other place besides the beginning? It just doesn't work like that. If you don't like the movie just for the single reason that the DVD has no chapter stops, then don't buy it. Simple as that.
My only complaint about the DVD might have been the high retail price, but now is the time to buy it while it's still new and cheap! I did not miss chapter stops at all watching my DVD for the first time and I didn't feel like the DVD was ""lacking"" any extras. Do you really think Lynch would do a commentary track on this movie?

Extras are sometimes thrown onto DVDs because the idea is that they will make a bad movie look good. As you can see in this case it is totally unnecessary. The movie is just all you need.",1018656000,2,1709,4.213414634146342
1489364,5,B00005JKJA,"Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Welles. A week ago, I would never have thought to have included David Lynch among these visionary masters. But then I purchased the DVD for Mulholland Drive on a whim (something I rarely do for films Ive never seen). I sat one night in front of the flat screen in my LA home, put the disc into the player, and was held captive for two and a half hours by a work of startling cinematic genius. It was, like all great films, a work that haunted me for days afterwards; a work that I wanted to immediately share with those closest to me -- but only those who would be willing, and able, to work through a very difficult film to the harrowing truths that glowered beneath the surface like a brilliant blue light.
There are many good filmmakers. There are some great filmmakers. But those handful who are considered true masters, true geniuses of the cinema, all share one trait: they adhere almost religiously to the idea of film as a Visual art form. Simply put, they allow the images, and the arrangement of those images, to tell the story. They aren't content, as most mainstream filmmakers are, with allowing a linear written narrative to wholly dictate the visual presentation of their films. Rather, they respect the raw, organic nature of an idea, they allow that idea to spread its roots, and they cull the images and the sounds together that will bend to the inclinations of that idea. Thus, these films, like Mulholland Drive, do not follow the simplistic but comforting A-B trajectory of most films, which are usually nothing more than cinematic renderings of novels. (Film and Literature are equally important artistic mediums; but the masters understand that they are essentially very distinct animals and should be treated as such.)
And so it is that Mulholland Drive, like Bergmans Persona, Fellinis 8 1/2, and Kurosawas Rashomon, decidedly turns traditional linear narrative upside down and inside out, and does so gleefully. Lynchs film is like a prolonged fever dream of the most intense human emotions: paranoia, anger, grief, jealousy, remorse and a soul-wrenching despair. It is a work that transcends its film noir underpinnings and becomes, ultimately, an incisive examination of Hollywood as Dream Factory and of the troubling implications that arise from our unquestioning willingness to embrace its position as such. Lynch seems to suggest that our willingness to surrender to the dream that is Hollywood makes us complicit in the crimes that Hollywood then commits to further sustain that dream. And he doesn't exclude himself from this complicity (the brash young filmmaker Adam Kesher is arguably a self-parody).
I will not discuss the specifics of the plot because I think that would be a true injustice for those who have not yet had the privilege of working through this masterpiece. All I will say is that of all of the films from all over the world that I have had the honor of taking into my mind and my heart, few have shaken me as much as Mulholland Drive. I cannot emphasize enough how brilliant Naomi Watts performance is in this film. To even call it a performance seems like an insult. I have rarely, if ever, seen a young actress so fully inhabit the skin of her character as Ms. Watts does here. Her character arc in this film is not simply A to B to C. It is more like BA to AB to C, and what a heartbreaking C it is. Those of you who have seen and understood the heart of the film will know what I mean.
Mr. Lynch and Ms. Watts, if you are reading this, one lowly cinephile salutes you.",1018656000,10,3564,4.704

Personally, I guess what Lynch tries to express is a virtual and vituperative utterance on what the life of Hollywood is. Lynch insists on his style of making the thrill movie, which created another cinematic masterpiece among his works.

After all, who else would have a beautiful dead girl wrapped in plastic as the symbol of the popular cult TV series TWIN PEAKS???  MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a cinematic mystery in which a sexy femme fatale (Laura Elena Harring) and a smart blonde cutie (Naomi Watts) are thrown together in a bizarre series of events which involve memory-loss, Hollywood politics, sexual attraction, and the love/hate dynamic.  Throughout the entire 2 and a half hour running time, this flick commands your attention as motives and identities change.  This is NOT a film for those with short attention spans.  Both Watts and Harring are alluring and wonderful as the women trapped in the bizarre surroundings.  Ann Miller makes a solid appearance as Watts' landlady, while Lee Grant makes the most of her cameo as a rather spaced-out fortune teller.  Unfortunately, those looking for the full DVD experience will be disappointed with this disk.  Mr. Lynch has gone on record as not being warm to the concept of DVD features and this film reflects that.  While there are the usual cast/crew bios and theatrical trailer, there are absolutely NO chapter stops, which forces the viewer to fast-forward to find favorite moments in the film.  This is especially galling since this film demands repeated reviewing of various sections in order to better understand it.  As a result of this, this film does not get the 5-star rating that it would probably get.

They blur out the genitals of one of the lead actresses in one scene.  there is no point in purchasing this dvd.

1489440,5,B00005JKJA,"As a movie reviewer for a newspaper, I get to see a lot of movies and review them, which is great because I have been a movie junkie since I was five. Every once in a blue moon, I see a movie that is on the level of 'Mulholland Drive', that level being simply astounding!
I find that David Lynch, my favorite living director, can't go wrong. This story only proves my point. It is surreal dream that involves two women: a bright eyed Canadian dreamer(Naomi Watts) and an amnesiac who has just survived a car accident on Mulholland Dr.(Laura Harring). The sub plots include a young filmmaker(Justin Theroux) and a feeling that hangs over the whole film, fear.
Watts, in her first lead role in an American film, is beyond brilliant and was more deserving of an Oscar nomination than Renee Zellweger. Harring and Theroux are equally excellent. Look out for Ann Miller in her first film role in almost forty five years.
Low and behold, David Lynch's soon-to-be classic is the best film of 2001 by a mile. -James R, Louison",1018569600,,1018,4.5683060109289615
1489441,3,B00005JKJA,"The film is great.  Read the other reviews for testimonials.  There were two things which disappointed me about this dvd: 1) there are no chapter stops.  Not one.  I understand the argument of how the movie should be viewed in its entirety and all, but, practically, it's very annoying.  2) one scene has been censored, resulting in some very obvious blurring.  There are, of course, no extras besides the trailer, but I guess that's pretty standard for Lynch.  We're just lucky it's on dvd.",1018569600,,491,4.773809523809524
1489442,3,B00005JKJA,"Allow one of the brain-dead (see ""galleries"" review - term review used very loosely here) to chime in on this film for a moment.  Many of the scenes of Mulholland Drive create good atmosphere and have moments of bizarre comedy.  I found it quite engrossing up to about the last half hour of the movie when it appears at first to just fall apart.  I've since formed my own hypothesis which I fear uttering because I don't won't to seem stupid (he's saying it's just a movie and thus an illusion, right?).
What really bothers me are the hoards of self righteous Lynch toadies who defensively condemn any person that may not find this to his or her likings.  I see a great deal of movies and have been known to prefer arthouse and/or foreign film that don't get a large audience... and I can see very well how this movie can win the disdain of many a viewer.  These viewers should have no shame and hold their heads high, for they are doing a greater service for the mission of this type of work than the little lapdogs who decide that because the story ultimately doesn't make much sense that it must be a work of astounding genius and thus beyond the average American mindset.
Form your own opinion.  Me - I liked most of Mulholland Drive but have to wonder what the hell it was all for... maybe I could rate it higher if it was enjoyable enough for me to want to sit through it a third or fourth time to figure it all out.",1018569600,,1422,4.287313432835821
1489443,5,B00005JKJA,"I wrote an earlier review right after I had seen the DVD for the first time.  I had been astonished that there are no extras and no chapter breaks on the DVD, and was reluctant to recommend it because of that.
After doing more research, however, I discovered that everything about ALL of David Lynch's DVD's are in place the way they are because that is the way Lynch wants it.  None of his movies have commentary or chapter breaks.  Admittedly, it would be difficult to imagine a commentary that didn't just give away the store on this mysterious movie.  And if Lynch wants me to view the movie without chapter breaks, then who am I to question the maestro?
So, sometime in the future, after Lynch is gone and the Criterion Collection picks up the rights to this masterpiece, we will get a thorough commentary.  I still wish that there was a little more warning about the DVD's quirks on the outside case -- the absence of common DVD features will definitely confound the casual viewer....
But I must retract my earlier trashing of the DVD.  The picture and sound are spectacular, and they are placed on the disc the way the creator intends them to be.",1018483200,8,1153,4.519230769230769

I am always taken to another place when ever I see a Lynch film ... only Lynch knows that place and can give me the directions so clearly as if he owns a map of my mind. I am at this moment studying film at University here in the UK and there is no doubt about it, Lynch is my inspiration for where I am today. Here in England I recently saw Mulholland Drive at the cinema on a Monday night, Tuesday night and Thursday night in the same week. I WAS BLOWN AWAY! It has everything and was a ticket to 'that DREAM place'! If you are a Lynch fan you will be an extremely Happy Chappy ... even if you do not class Lynch as a Fav ... give this a go, its bloody great! As for the DVD (just got mine today) it fantastic! Lovely picture, and clean crisp sound pouring out of my 5 speakers ... you hear sounds you never heard at the cinema. As for the extras ... well I would have loved interviews with the cast, but to be quite honest no matter what, this movie is a treat. As for other reviewers here, they seem to keep mentioning the missing chapter search. Come on guys, is this such a problem? I quote from David Lynch himself on the inner sleave of the wonderful Straight Story
'It is my opinion that a film is not like a book - it should not be broken up. It is a continuum and should be seen as such'

It has more depth than LH, the acting is superb, and it's not filled with weird-for-the-sake-of-weird characters and scenes like FWWM or WAH. It's basically a mystery ala BLUE VELVET for the first 2 hours, and then when The Blue Box is opened we enter the world of LOST HIGHWAY again. The questions raised, the confusion suffered by viewers, is all part of the wonderful experience of watching a Lynch film. I do not think he's purposefully leaving out pieces of the puzzle to frustrate or anger viewers, but rather he makes movies that can be many things to many people. Theories abound, I have my own which I'm not going to share here, and for those who like a good mystery it's the most satisfying way to end a film, by basically not ending it. You cannot leave a Lynch film without thinking about it, how many other directors can you say that about these days? Kudos as always to Lynch.

In other words, you should be prepared to be fully engaged and ready to ponder all the twists and turns in this one. On the surface, it is the story of 2 women in Hollywood, one suffering from temporary amnesia as the result of a car accident and the other an aspiring young actress with visions of stardom in her eyes. But like most Lynch films, the surface is just a way to get the viewer to consider deeper realms of reality and possibility. There is the dreamlike world that is a Lynch trademark as well as quirky characters which come and go. Be prepared for sudden twists and turns in the plot and don't expect a logical narrative or storyline in this one.

Lynch makes you, at the end of Mulholland Drive, wonder what this and that ment. I think that was the point of it. This movie made 'Blue Velvet' as easy to understand as a Disney movie. I was stuck for hours after this film wondering what it all ment. and then it hit me. See Mulholland Drive to find out the 'twist' ending.",1018396800,,610,4.3130434782608695

1489526,1,B00005JKJA,"Sitting through a showing of David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is like being attacked by a gang of psychotic thugs..you beg for them to stop but they keep coming at you; in this case for an interminable 2 1/2 hours.
Ever since 1986, Lynch, in one way or another has been trying to recapture the success of ""Blue Velvet,"" a totally original, cult blockbuster that boasted some of the weirdest images in film history (who can forget, for example the sight of Dean Stockwell in drag lip-synching Roy Orbison's ""In Dreams"" into an industrial lamp while Dennis Hopper, his face contorted in pain, mouths the words along with him).
Once you make a film as completely over top as ""Velvet"", any attempt to recreate the feel is bound to end up in silly self-parody.
In the case of ""Mulholland Drive,"" a couple of clever Lynchian moments(the meeting between the film director and ""The Cowboy,"" for example) aren't enough to save what is essentially an incomprehensible mess of a movie that seems to go on for centuries.
It's not a good sign when you watch a film and start praying for closing credits that never seem to come.
***
Special features on the DVD are practically non-existent, save for the theatrical trailer...in the case of ""Mulholland,"" that's a blessing!",1018396800,3,1258,4.8018433179723505
1489527,4,B00005JKJA,"Yes, it's true.  This DVD has no chapters.
Well, one chapter, and that's the movie!  Very bizarre... interesting in terms of an experiment to recreate the theater experience, but that has one problem.  If the movie SKIPS, the whole thing SHUTS DOWN and you have to renavigate from the VERY BEGINNING!  Which is REALLY NASTY if it happens at the VERY END!  I wanted to see those people come out, and BZZKKRKRKK!
Anyway, don't fast forward or scan if you can, you'll have to TYPE IN the HOUR AND MINUTE MARK ON YOUR REMOTE!  (an old laserdisc trick)  That means you have to know around what certain time your favorite part happens, and punch in the numbers on your little keypad.  Gradually, you'll know exactly when it occurs, and so on.  It's strange though, I find it sort of funny, like we'll just be drawn in so much as to just not bother skipping ahead!
Of course, if the DVD skips, then we'll be bothered.  Especially if we paid full price.
The disc seems a little expensive for this bare-bones treatment, but perhaps that's because of its art-house nature(?).  This is perhaps the only DVD I own without any chapter search at all!  The sound and picture are satisfactory, and some of the surround is very surprising and entertaining.  Now I just have to punch in the time for whenever they go to Silencio!
I hadn't seen the film since the theater, so naturally I was in great anticipation to see it again, and bought it immediately, so I was a little shocked!  especially when it started SKIPPING!!  AHHHH!!",1018396800,,1513,4.5724907063197024

A beautiful, touching, confounding, and devastating film. However Lynch's disdain for DVD has never been more evident. The ""extra features"" are a trailer and uninformative cast and crew bios. That is it. There are no animated menus. There are not even chapter stops. The video is of passable quality and the sound mix is very good. If you haven't seen this yet, don't waste any more time. It's a true original and one of my favorites to come out of Hollywood in recent years.

1489584,4,B00005JKJA,"Mullholland Drive is one of those films that, despite being confusing and just plain weird, remains thoroughly absorbing until its very last moments. There is a difference being confusing and convoluted, of course, and Lynch's latest is anything but the latter. If you want a sexy, mysterious film noire, one that plays tricks on you, pulls the unexpected and always intrigues, you must get Mullholland Drive.
The DVD is good, but the film is presented on a single chapter (no skipping ahead without ""fast-forwarding""). I am reminded of Prince's ""LoveSexy"" album. Released in 1988, it was a single track CD despite having 9 or so individual songs. Prince was ""forcing"" listeners to take in the album as a whole experience, and in a way Lynch may be doing the same thing here. After all, skip anything in ""Mullholland Drive"" and you might miss something important. In a crazy, Lynchian way, the one track format makes sense.
The lack of extras is another thing. Acceptable, but kind of disappointing. Just cast credits and a set up screen. Nothing very advanced. Don't expect a lot of options.
I loved this movie and give it 5 stars, but the DVD gets 4 because of the lack of extras. I don't mind the one track aspect as much as some might. Perhaps there will be a special edition in the future with more. It's odd to have a new DVD with so little on it besides the movie itself these days.",1018396800,,1389,4.627530364372469
1489585,2,B00005JKJA,"""Mulholland Drive"" was one of my favorite movies of 2001, and I was looking forward its DVD release. I am truly disappointed at what I found when I played it:
- While the transfer per-se is quite clean, and it offers you the choice of DTS sound, the DVD offers NO EXTRAS whatsoever, something that has become a common feature in all DVD releases these days.
- The worst part is how David Lynch purposely decided to not include CHAPTER STOPS!!! Apparently Mr. Lynch believes his movies should be seen from beginning to end, without interruption, so he decided to avoid such a standard feature as chapter stops.
While I respect Mr. Lynch's artistic integrity, I believe his stubborn attitude of avoiding features that are part of the DVD standards is doing nothing but annoy his fan base. What's more, I think this may be the result of Mr. Lynch not quite understanding the nature of the DVD medium, and the great potential that digital video formats offer.
Again, as I said in the title, this is a great movie, but a terrible DVD that doesn't do justice to the film's exquisite quality.",1018396800,,1085,4.626943005181347
1489586,1,B00005JKJA,"So Lynch hates to discuss the ""meaning"" of his movies, or really to discuss them at all, and I assume that means he hates things like director's commentaries, making-of featurettes, deleted scenes, promos, etc. I sort of expected all of those standard things to be missing from this DVD for that very reason. But there aren't even any chapter headings! NO CHAPTER HEADINGS! You can't start the movie from anywhere but the very beginning!
 I'm still trying to figure out Lynch's reasoning, because only he could have thought this was a good idea (surely the knucklehead execs wanted to give consumers chapter headings). Maybe he wanted to force viewers to watch the program all the way through from the beginning--but being able to jump forward to points within the movie is a practical convenience that should be a given for the purchase price of the DVD. For whatever reason--your DVD player gets unplugged, say--you should be able to resume watching the movie where you left off. The transfer is fine but the DVD itself is almost completely unacceptable, especially at this price. If you're gonna sell an inferior product, at least price it appropriately, and warn the consumer before purchasing.",1018396800,3,1198,4.99

1489588,5,B00005JKJA,"The first half of the movie is as good or better than Blue Velvet. The second half has both the upsides and downsides of Lynch's post Blue Velvet work & is reminiscent of his Twin Peaks/Lost Highway period.
The first half is really good though. Two strong story lines, one involving an amnesiac Laura Harring & the other a newly arrived to Hollywood Naomi Watts. Harring is fleeing something and doesn't know what it is & Watts is pursuing something, a dream to be a star. The two end up in the same strange apartment complex, and there is chemistry between them.
The second half of the film takes that chemistry and performs some surreal alchemy with it. Not only does any semblance of a straightforward plot vanish but the characters themselves become different people. This is Lynch only terrain where dreams and reality are no longer neatly separated. Some of it is highly charged but some of it seems a little too reminiscent of some of Lynch's earlier surrealisms.
I preferred the first half which ends at the time the two women become most initmate and go to a midnight theatre. That theatre is the threshold where one reality ends and the more dream infused reality begins, the theatre where the female singer sings a Spanish version of Orbison's ""Crying"" bringing both women to tears....a scene and song you will not soon forget. Movie fans will think of Bergman more than once in this Persona swapping movie. The first half feels like an updated version of Persona in a Hollywood noir setting, an enticing blend. The second half becomes more, well, Lynch. The second half sacrifices continuity for visceral power, as you acclimate to this new movie within the movie you approve of this strnage twisting and the turning inside out of normal linear narrative. The strongest male in the movie is a movie director(Theroux) who looks like Lynch maybe did when he was 25. That movie maker within the movie makes one think of Fellini's 8 1/2 and Truffaut's Day for Night but the situation/character is not developed. He's there merely to pad the reality/dream conceit and as identity conduit than as a full character with a plot line of his own. Naomi Watts does about ten scenes in this movie which will floor movie goers of any persuasion.
 The first half sets you up in an appealing 'Blue Velvet' innocent on the surface/corrupt beneath the surface situation and with two extraordinary multi-dimensional characters and the second half subverts everything so that the corruption is on the surface/innocence buried beneath. Days after seeing Mulholland Drive its the second disturbing nocturne of the second half that continues to haunt the too bright afternoon.",1018396800,2,2666,4.872246696035242

She meets Laura Herring, a woman who survives a car wreck with amnesia, and both try to discover the woman's identity. In the midst of this, a young movie director, played by Justin Theroux, faces opposition when trying to re-cast the lead actress for his movie. What do the two stories have in common? They both contain a dark, almost paranoid atmosophere, and they both lead to an incredible climax that will have you seeing the film a second time to sift through the mystery for a conclusion.

1489591,5,B00005JKJA,"Let me start by saying that I was (and still am)a HUGE ""Twin Peaks"" fan, and consequently became a huge David Lynch fan, it's a natural progression.
I always thought ""Blue Velvet"" was Lynch's film masterpiece, as did most of his fans and film critics as well.
The reason that film went over so well was that it was pure Lynch:odd,erotic,surreal but strangely fascinating at the same time, and it was even more of those things back in the mid 80's.
The thing about ""Mulholland Drive"" is that it's 2002, and this movie illicits the same feelings, even more so.  It is so difficult to shock, fascinate or even interest movie fans these days.  In our society, nothing shocks us anymore.
This man truly has a gift, and I don't know that we will ever see another director in our lifetimes that can match his gift, he is WAY ahead of his time.
There is one word to describe this film: HYPNOTIC.
It truly is his masterpiece, and it's not as hard to figure out as most people think.  As far as the acting, Naomi Watts deserved an Academy Award for one of the best performances by a young actress, and a newcomer at that, as I can ever remember seeing. Laura Herring was very good as well, as was Justin Theroux.
It is pure bliss for Lynch fans, with the usual surreal musical sequences and nightmarish visions we have come to know from some of his previous work.
There is however, one element that has been lacking in some of his other films: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.  Even though for most of the film we're not exactly sure who the characters are, or even if they are real, we fall in love with both of the female leads in a way that has been missing with some of his lead characters in other films.
And I think that is the final piece of the puzzle that makes this film an absolute piece of cinematic brilliance from beginning to end.
For non-Lynch fans who watch this film, all I can say is:  Try to keep an open mind and enjoy it, don't try to figure it all out, just let yourself get caught up in this remarkable piece of work, you will not regret it.",1018310400,,2045,4.328981723237598

 2. The ... studio...digitally blured Laura Elena's vagina in the [lesbian] scene... Wich it's not that important... But it's very distracting.

Universal DVDs tend to look pretty and sound good with zero extras, but this is really absurd.  I GIVE THE MOVIE 5 STARS BECAUSE I LOVE IT, AND -4 STARS BECAUSE I WANT TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS on this less-than-spectacular DVD.

And while other reviewers will try and sort out the movie's plot for you, I will limit my comments to a few points about the the film's transfer to DVD.  (BTW, I really dug the movie and still haven't figured it out, unlike Memento or Vanilla Sky.)
For starters, this bad boy has no chapter marks!!!!  Which means you have to fast foward or rewind (how VHS) if you want to see selected parts of the film.  Perhaps Lynch and the folks who produced the DVD wanted to force the viewer to watch the film in toto, as opposed to just the incredibly sexy girl-girl scenes.  I'm no stranger to adult movies, and this ""regular"" movie was HOT.  Naomi Watts in particular lights up the screen.
Another point about the DVD...amazing sound.  Especially in the Silencio theater/nightclub/performance art scene.  The chanteuse who sings a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" sounded stunning in our living room...with no discernable output from the rear channels, as far as I could tell.

There are much better movies that deal with amnesia, mystery, etc. (Memento).  This DVD has nothing, just the trailer.  The video quality is good and the sound is fine, although there's not much sound in the movie.  I know a lot of people really like this movie, but it's just too slow, too random, and not nearly engaging enough for me to go back and see if I can figure everything out.  And this is one of the worst DVD's to come out lately since it only has a trailer and no scene selections.

1489668,5,B00005JKJA,After the third time seeing this film I have still haven't figured it out.  Why?  It's not supposed to be 'firgured out' it is a movie to be experienced.  Lynch's way of filmmaking is to give his audience something they have never felt before or seen before.  Mulholland drive works this way because unlike his other films the characters are generally likeable and the story is of course followable until the end.  I believe that this could've been a great TV show and I think it's agreat a film.  Buy it.,1018137600,,505,4.4945054945054945

Well, there is the little mess. You can see the movie 3 or 4 times, and still looking for some answers. But don't miss this movie.",1018137600,2,406,4.5
1489670,5,B00005JKJA,"There are some directors that entertain and there are some directors, an elite few, who cast spells.  David Lynch belongs to the elite few.
Maybe with exception of the Cohen brothers, there is no American director whose film could be mistaken for another director.  Since his Blue Velvet in 1986(and some would argue even before then),Lynch has created a style which could only be described, for lack of a better word, as ""Lynchian"".
Long time fans of Lynch will feel right at home with Muholland Drive.  It's a film that Lynch has building up to since Blue Velvet, and it shows an artist working at his peak.  I have to admit in recent years, I believed Lynch was starting to stray from the elements that made Blue Velvet so special. Movies like Wild at Heart, Twin Peaks, and Lost Highway were fascinating but they seemed to be different variations on Blue Velvet.  It wasn't until 1999 that Lynch stepped away from his special brand of neo-noir and made the beautiful ""Straight Story.""  In that film, Lynch tells a deceptively simple story about an elderly man living in Iowa who drives a lawnmower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged elderly brother who is dying.  The film was based on fact and it was one of the very few films of his which Lynch did not write. I believe the experience of making that film was of monumemtal importance to Lynch because, due to the nature of the factual story, it forced Lynch to focus on the narrative of the story.
It is this focus which Lynch has brought to Muholland Drive and makes it a triumph. The film starts out with a violent car crash between two vehicles on a Los Angeles highway.  Out of the flames of the collision arises a dazed and injured brunette played by Laura Harring. The brunette is able to leave the scene before law enforcement arive and finds solace in an unoccupied apartment located on Mulholland Drive.  Cut a few frames later and we are introduced to a beautiful blonde(played by the stunning Naomi Watts)arriving into Los Angeles at the airport. She is an aspiring actress who is given the opportunity to reside her in her aunt's unoccupied apartment in Los Angeles as she auditions for film roles. Eventually, Ms Watts discovers that the brunette is hiding in her aunt's apartment.  The film's mystery begins when Ms Watts, having sympathy for the uninvited guest, offers to ""help"" the brunette find her identity who, as we find out, has amnesia. The first part of the film deceptively seems to deal with the issue of the brunette and her identity.  It is not until the film's incredible second half that we begin to discover who the movie is really about and why.
Mulholland Drive, like other Lynch films, obsesses over identity. However, that is not the whole story.  It also reveals, very slowly and cunningly, the ""dirt"" beneath the Hollwood fabric and lifestyle.
I can't praise this film high enough. I saw it two days in a row during a holiday weekend and was engrossed both times.  This movie is made by one of the very few radical directors.  A director who creates a world where everything is simple but nothing is obvious.",1018137600,2,3102,4.657509157509158

1489672,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Dr is, IMO, the finest, most intriguing picture released in 2001. This is very important work. Here is a film about the things we see when we die. The experience of MULHOLLAND DR leaves much to interpretation, but my opinion says it's all an Afterlife Experience, NOT a dream as most suggest. In that light, MULHOLLAND DR has no holes in its plot, leaves no stone unturned, is fully resolved & oh so tragic. --Everything about this film is beautiful. From Angelo Badalamenti's haunting, heart-rending score, to Mary Sweeny's crisp editing, to the lush, eclectic cinematography, to Lynch's classic-style directing (some of these shots are phenomenal! The Oscar was his!), to the awe-inspiring performances from a brilliant cast. Naomi Watts not being nominated for an Oscar is absolute horse puckey. She leaves us breathless, shattered for her life & fantasy, idealism grounded in failure, obsession & love. --If you've never seen MULHOLLAND DR, this is a perfect way to do so. You'll need to sit through this several times, and DVD is the only way to do so economically. This is a sparkling diamond, and the best 2001 addition to one's DVD library, followed by MOULIN ROUGE! --These are films with replay value. Must see!",1017878400,,1232,4.985436893203883

BUT, like i said before, this WAS to be a TV SHOW. so buyer beware. you will be in for a very strong lynch product, but you'll feel slightly cheated if you're expecting something as bold and daring as twin peaks. oh, and by the way, all the obvious reviews that start out like ""i didn't get it""... seriously, it's lynch. he doesn't do ron howard films. on top of that i can't see how, at this point, he can be THAT unpredictable to people. he's basically making the same movie over and over again. it just happens to be a good one.",1017705600,,1243,4.226890756302521

You can watch it, get the general idea, and appreciate it without picking up all of the subtle nuances.  Its like reading TS Elliot.  TS Elliot is not meant to be fully appreciated in one reading.

This movie had me completely enthralled for about the first 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If ended differently, it could have been really great. But, then the box drops. Oh, that damned blue box. This is where Mr. Lynch's surrealistic ideas get into the way. It was probably about the point that the TV pilot ended and the real Lynch took over. And, what was with the love scenes? Who saw that coming? Did they make sense to anyone? I saw this movie months ago and have thought about it a lot since then, and still don't know what the heck was going on. Who is Who? What is What? Why is she there? Why, why, why... this is the prevailing theme of this movie. It led you down so many rabbit trails that never had an ending that poor Peter Rabbit is dead from exhaustion. Tripe.

1489715,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is truly the scenic auditory seduction the reviewers who liked the film liked it for.  However, I see several Lynch obsessions here, and I'm intrigued by the fact that he can't let go of them.  The most important is the notion I discovered first in Twin Peaks: the notion that we all carry within us alternative Mr. Hyde persona, a double. The German word doppelganger (meaning ""double""), as I recall, occurs among the twilight verbal oozings in the Red Room. Agent Cooper's doppelganger appears at the very end of the last episode of Twin Peaks, which brings the whole meandering story back to the beginning, but 180 degrees reversed, like a moebius strip.  Bob, I suppose, is Laura Palmer's father's double, who finds himself killing both double versions of Laura, the seductress and the naive cousin from Montana.  The double motif is explicit in Lost Highway, where the young car mechanic's double is the older (Bill Pullman), cynical and suspicious saxophonist and murderer.  In Mulholland Drive the ""real"" story is given in the latter part of the film, where ""Betty"" turns out to be the initiator of ""Rita's"" attempted murder, a mystery she is also trying to solve: the criminal and the detective are the same person (Oedipus Rex all over again).  Naomi Watt's most affecting performance came at the end, where we can almost feel viscerally her bitterness, anger, and envy at missing both the movie part and and the movie's director.  Like every envier, she both loves and hates the object (Camilla Rhodes/Rita) of her envy.  Make love to her/kill her: Laura Palmer and her father redoubled.  Both Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive are about revenge, where the revenger is self-doomed to oscillate between victim and victimizer.  Don't tell me Lynch doesn't keep a gimlet eye on America's current gender scene.
Finally, there's Lynch's obsession with 1950s culture, something it has become axiomatic to refer to as his version of a distant, impossibly innocent lost eden.  The movie that's being cast is one that's going to take place in that period, complete with 1950's bubble-gum pop.  As an oldster who lived through WWII, I noticed something that may have escaped others: in the scene where the director shows the actor how to neck with Rita in the car.  In the lower left-hand corner of the car's windshield is a square decal, a white letter ""A"" on a black background.  That was the rationing license issued for every car during WWII, limiting the amount of gas that could be bought during a given month.  ""A"" was the lowest priority--""C"" as I recall was the highest.",1017100800,22,2596,4.894977168949771
1489716,5,B00005JKJA,"One super excellent film, a classic.
It is of interest that this movie was intended for TV and rejected eventually. That is, the first two hours of the movie constitute the TV pilot, and Lynch added the last half hour to close things up. Otherwise as a series, I expect it would have been a Twin Peakean odyssey with the interminable but interesting
Lynchian meanderings.
I must ashamedly admit that it did not gel for me until the second viewing when (slapping forehead) all became clear. The third time, it was just a relaxing evening basking in the intricate details that Lynch is famous for. The music, for my money, is top rate.

By the end of the film, I understood those comments.  Although I will most certainly patronize future Lynch films, this one angered me because it kept me thinking throughout that something would eventually tie all the weird plot twists together.  When it didn't happen, I just got mad, feeling like I had been watching two and a half hours of form with no substance.  I thought, ""Couldn't Lynch have made a movie that made at least SOME sense?""  I spent those two and a half hours trying to remember all the weird little twists, thinking they would be important later.  However, I strained my brain for no payoff.
However, I will say this:  Those two and a half hours do go by pretty darn fast.  It's not a boring movie by any means.  And a totally abstract movie sounds like a great idea.  Unfortunately, this wasn't weird enough to fall into that category.
I will also say this:  I do plan to watch it again, as perhaps it will make more sense the second time around.  First impression, however, is THREE STARS.",1016582400,5,1213,4.564814814814815

1489719,5,B00005JKJA,"I don't know if everyone dreams the way I do. My dreams are both frustrating and entertaining.  This is because they are not linear, do not unfold the way something really happens, 1-2-3, but rather they unfold in any sequence they want.  Ultimately, however, there is always some thread that keeps reoccurring in the dream, that is central to it.  Often, the dream is showing me something that I can't yet handle in fully conscious, waking mode.  The dream is preparing me for my eventually being able to see the same material in linear mode while conscious.  I assume this was built into us as a safety mechanism.  This is the way David Lynch films his movies.  Before him, Alain Resnais of the French New Wave pioneered the idea bringing it to film with ""Last Year in Marienbad,"" ""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"" and ""Providence.""  There are 2 lead women in Lynch's film.  One of them cannot handle knowing consciously a sequence of events in which she participated.  So Lynch lets her discover what happened the way she would as if she were dreaming about it. He handles big themes while doing so: love, betrayal, jealousy, fame, talent, sexuality and murder.  This film isn't for everyone.  I saw it with my friend Joyce and she found it utterly bewildering and incomprehensible.  Many people will probably have a similar reaction.  Lynch is not for everyone though.  I'm a fan of his previous work and if you like his previous work, you'll do well with this one too.

1489720,5,B00005JKJA,"""Mulholland Drive"" is not a typical movie, so I will not write a typical movie review.  Herewith, my five personas, while enjoying the ""Mulholland Drive"" 'experience':
1.  FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE MOVIE STARTED:
Oh, I wasn't looking forward to this one.  Not a fan of Lynch am I.  Bored senseless by ""Blue Velvet"" and ""The Elephant Man"".  Found ""Twin Peaks"" intriguing, at times stunning, but ultimately vacuous.  And the ""Straight Story"" made me quite sad, but confused me too.  Have already planned my escape route out of the theatre, in case boredom sets in before the half hour mark.
2.  THE FIRST TWO HOURS:
An over-the-top pretentious opening, that I realize is supposed to be over-the-top and pretentious.  A really good start.  Ooh, look at that car crash!  Lynch captures the power of steel on steel much better than Cronenberg ever could.  And now we meet the two girls.  Laura Harring (Rita) and Naomi Watts (Betty; she's from Deep River, Ontario, which got a nice chuckle at my Toronto screening) are both sexy, while being two halves of the same coin.  The former, dark and mysterious.  The latter, light and innocent.  They're both great.
Uh-oh.  There are a couple of scenes that just don't fit.  Who were those two guys at the restaurant?  And what the heck did they just see in the back alley?  I'll admit this, though: it was terrifically frightening.  A viscerally charged moment.  And then we get a scene of botched burglary that keeps going wrong.  And who the heck are the Castigliane brothers, and what do they have against espresso?  The Little Man from ""Twin Peaks"" has a cameo, just to remind you that you were watching a David Lynch movie.  Yeah, like I could ever forget that.  So now we're wrapped up in a weird mystery plot, surrounded by a surreal Hollywood (What year is this?  1950?  2001?).
Now for the lesbian scenes.  Coolly erotic, although out of place and creepy somehow.  I bet this is intentional.
And on we go to Club Silencio.  You must have heard about this scene.  A master of ceremonies tells us, to our faces, that all we are about to see (and, by association, all we have seen) is pre-recorded, fake, phony.  To prove this, a trumpeter comes out to play a few notes, only when the trumpet drops to his side, the music plays on.  Ah.  And now, out comes Rebekah Del Rio.  She's going to sing Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" in Spanish.  Oh my god, this is heartbreaking.  And then...(!) I'll not ruin the surprise.  Probably my favourite scene from any movie this year.  It's supremely appealing on an intellectual *and* an emotional level.
And then the Pandora's box opens, and the movie...
3.  THE LAST HALF HOUR:
...gets really weird.  I'm trying to keep up.  My brain is working overtime.  Who is that?  Is she still Betty?  Is she still Rita?  Is this all a dream?  An amnesiacal remembrance?  The visual style and tone of the first half carries forth, only it's all a lot more sinister and surreal.  The narrative falls away, to be replaced by a dream-like state.  Full-disclosure: dream-like states in movies always feel like self-indulgence to me.  The filmmaker obviously couldn't find a cohesive ending, so they throw random images against the wall hoping they will stick.  That's usually my take.  Here, for some reason, I was into playing along with Lynch's game.  Big time.
Okay, so now the credits are rolling.  And it all kind of makes sense, but not really.  I think I'll take a walk to clear my head.
4.  THE LONG WALK HOME FORM THE THEATRE:
It's starting to crystallize.  She was also she, and that was also that, and they were this, and this was that (oh how I wish I could give you the details along with the above sentence; but that would surely spoil your fun).  And yet, some things are just too cloudy to forgive.
5.  DISSECTING IT WITH MY ROOMMATE:
She had just seen the movie the day before I.  We talked for a long while, piecing together the puzzle.  Ah!  Now I get it.  It actually makes a whole lot of sense.
POSTSCRIPT:
Here's my advice.  Never think of ""Mulholland Drive"" as having a standard narrative.  It doesn't.  Never mind that characters come and go without rhyme or reason (Robert Forster and Dan Hedaya, two fantastic character actors, have two scene and two lines between them!).  Try not to think of its genesis as a TV pilot.  It never would have worked as an open-ended narrative.  It only works thematically, symbolically (I suspect others out there caught the obvious visual reference to Bergman's ""Persona""?), and viscerally.  And when I say ""works"", I mean it.  This one's a stunner, folks.  A pure, cinematic stunner.",1016323200,358,4604,4.656679151061174
1489809,2,B00005JKJA,"Why is it that some of my favorite movies of all time and some of what I consider to be the worst movies of all time were done by the same director?  Mulholland Drive was quite a chore for me to get through.  I felt the same way about Fire Walk With Me.  I'm always enthusiastic about the work of David Lynch . . . but I wouldn't even recommend this film to another Lynch admirer.  This movie is fragmented--and even very obvious, which is something that I've never felt any of his work was.  It never connects with itself . . . even in the normally absurd ways of David Lynch.  In my opinion it's his least succesful work.
I love Eraserhead.  I love Lost Highway.  These films were similar to Mulholland Drive--but they were effective.  They used the disconnectness, the stark, surreal moments and the sheer confusion of the characters in a way the truly resonated with me.  With Mulholland Drive, Lynch's imagery, the dialog and the normal sense that you are about to be engulfed in utter darkness and doom have all just fallen flat.  What you're left with is something quite boring.  Not shocking.  Not groundbreaking.  Not evern really quirky.

However putting that aside I steped into the theater and didn't so much as get up to go to the bathroom this movie was amazing. With it's eventfull plot and amazing acting (especially Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) there wasn't a dull moment in this spectacular piece of art.

1489812,5,B00005JKJA,"And it will be one of the top ten of the decade. After the let down of THE STRAIGHT STORY, David Lynch has done it again !
Lynch first developed MULHOLLAND to be the basis of a TV series for ABC that could have been the Twin Peaks of the new decade. But the channel got scared when they received the material and the film was fished back by the french producer Alain Sarde (COCORICO !) who decided to buy back the option from ABC and shoot additional scenes to turn this series into a movie. The result was first shown in Cannes Film Festival where the critics raved about it and where it won the Best Director award (tied with the Coen worst movie ever : The man who wasn't there !, those guys really lost their touch !).
When I first saw the movie in Cannes I was struck by its haunting beauty, calling it one of Lynch's masterpiece but I had two small problems : The movie had too many similitudes with LOST HIGHWAY, Lynch Masterpiece from 1997 (And Probably the best movie of that decade !), and the second part of the movie was too obscure leaving little place to understanding.
When I saw it again when it opened here, I was still struck by the genius of it, but it was obvious that trying to explain it  could only ruin the complex roughness of its beauty. As for  dreams, this movie is only open for interpretation and not for  rational explanation.
Yet the second time, it made more sense to me. My explanation for all it's worth is that the second part of the movie is actually the reality and the first part is what we call in psychology ""Reves Compensatoires"" (compensatory dreams ?) where your dreams are making up for the harshness of your reality. But that is me and don't mind me. Just enjoy the joyride and the highly complex composition of each frame that Lynch builds. Enjoy the work of an artist at the height of his mastery. And that sequence where Rebekah Del Rio sings ""Crying"" in spanish in that weird theater ranks amongst the best moments i have enjoyed in a movie theater.

Lynch isn't your traditional filmmaker.  he makes his films function on dream logic and part of this comes from his painter's eye.  he has always been a painter first and the film only makes sense in th way your own dreams or nightmares do.  Dreams have many interpetations just like David Lynch's films have many meanings and under currents and many ways to look at the movie on what you thought it all meant.  This drives some people crazy.  If you want a traditional narritive, skip this movie.  If you want to be challenged by your movies, this might be the one for you.

I saw ""Mullholland Drive"" several months ago and I'm still haunted by it's images, long after the tearjerking senimentality of ""A Beautiful Mind"" and high the tech overkill of ""Lord of the Rings"" have dissipated. We live in a world where the transparent charm of Julia Roberts passes as ""Best Actress""; and both Laura Harring and Naomi Watts don't even get nominated.

1489879,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch is by no means one of my favourite directors. The obscure trademarks we find synonymous with his style are by no means absent from this film. Why I personally found it so gripping and ergo satisfying, the enigmatic abilities of Naomi Watts are a device destined to revolutionise the scope of emotion that actresses are able to portray. Single handedly the character of Betty entices our delight with her mingled softness and ambition reducing our egos to minute status momentarily. In Comparison to Lost Highway, Lynch has obviously sat down and had a hard think about character development in this wonderfully crafted film, in some ways equally disjointed, however the plot flows in a comprehensible fashion for a substantial duration of two and a half hours. A decapitating head cut and paste effect is employed triggered by the linking of a blue key to a box, assumed to be an answer for a woman whom has seeked refuge under Bettys wing after and accident in the beginning that renders her experiencing amnesia. Not everyone will gladly feel comfortable with the questions concerning this piece that cannot be answered, but it is these non-sensical devises that strike a chord, for they are the climax and leave you flattened only to be left experiencing an extreme case of the ""Kubrick chills"",or at best wobbly knees as you proceed to exit the cinema.

If you are looking for logic, you should leave after the first love scene, otherwise you'll be frustrated, as would a person who wound't get Lynch's other works.  This is a picture that examines a surreal reality and then shifts into an even more surreal dreamworld with nightmares patched about.  And it is done so flawlessly, so much in a feeling of beauty and enlightenment, it is very hard for this reviewer to complain.
Bottom line, wonderful if strange Lynch film gets boast from bizarre and fascinating scenes including superb performances by Harring, Watts, Thoreux and others in smaller roles (even a Robert Forster cameo is appreciated).",1014249600,,814,5.014814814814815

1489883,4,B00005JKJA,"I've heard alot of people say that about this film.
Many claim to be confused by this film, its really simple. For further explanation of the film feel free to visit [...] Infact I left the theatre placing all these pieces of the puzzle into place. Its a simple story, thats flipped upside down, and uses ingenious tricks to make the audience feel and think things we normally do not. Mr. Lynch is an incredible talent, as much as he and this film are so anti-hollywood, even the suits on top acknowledged his brilliance with an Oscar Best Director nomination. Pictures that use all this symbolism are rare in film today.
With those ideas out of the way, this film is completely subjective. You only get out of it, the brain power that you put into it, to understand what you see on screen. Its a really funny film because all of the performances are a bit over-dramatized to further satire his views of hollywood and would be new comers. Lynch's ability to make the most common scenes very tense, such as the ""expresso scene"" or the ""Silencio Club"" scene. Everytime I watch this movie I get something completely new out of it. Dont' try to wreck your brain to understand EVERY SINGLE part, but enjoy what they do to you. Wether it's make you laugh, feel tense, or confused. Confusion is underated in our society. We give it such a negative conotation. Confusion allows us to think critically and make amazing discoveries about this world and ourselves.
The film satires everything you ever thought about L.A. Naomi Watts is brilliant in her transformation from beginning to end. The film is not just art for art's sake, it is a very coherant plot once you see it a few dozen times and think about what everything means. This is a very rewarding film to watch, but not for your average movie goer.
If you're not ready to  think, then skip this movie.",1013904000,,1850,4.572289156626506
1489884,5,B00005JKJA,"If you pay attention to every frame of this film, you'll ""get it"" from the very beginning. David Lynch herein weaves a highly symbolic and meaningful tale in which the apparent narrative is not the real story at all and, in fact, the ""real"" story is probably never shown onscreen. It doesn't matter. About two thirds of the way through, as Rebekah del Rio is singing Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" in Spanish, you'll either have the biggest cinematic ""A-ha"" of your life, or you'll just be confused. If you have the ""A-ha,"" you'll spend the last act of this movie revelling in one apparent revelation after another, only to have the rug yanked out from under you yet again -- and you'll love it. More than any other film he's made, Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" just gets deeper and deeper after you've viewed it. This is the work of an artiste at the top of his game, in which nothing in any frame is accidental, but everything is fraught with meaning. He gives us the keys to decoding his symbolism right out front, but leaves it up to us to grasp onto those keys and do the deciphering. This is a film for people who like to pay attention and think -- but the dividends paid back for those activities are incalculable.
Two thumbs up, a ten, the best film of 2001 -- ""Mulholland Drive"" truly is Lynch's masterwork.
And I think it's really the story of a waitress at Winkies who cheated on her boyfriend Dan with Joe the Hitman. Your opinion may differ -- but you can't watch this film and not have an opinion, which is all we can ask of cinema, isn't it?",1013817600,22,1545,4.424561403508772
1489885,4,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch's world in all of his creations always seems to have these lively, colorful, postmodern, eerie, surreal settings-- especially where evil and the underworld seem to be a manipulative force within the at first seemingly ""innocent setting"" we encounter.  Since we already may see Hollywood as sinister (especially 90's Hollywood), one may wonder why Lynch would make a movie about Hollywood.  But this is a Lynchesque version, and seeing Hollywood with the same take as Twin Peaks and the 50's suburbs of ""Blue Velvet,"" is actually very novel.
The main story (though actually all ""stories"" are interconnected) is about a dark-haired woman actress who we first see is going to be murdered on Muholland Drive, but due to car accident, escapes alive, but loses her memory-- and a blonde-haired woman named Betty, who travels from Canada to stay at her aunt's apartment and to prepare for her big acting audition in Hollywood.  She finds the dark-haired woman in the apartment and she becomes the protector for the dark-haired woman as they both try to figure out who the dark-haired woman is, and why someone wants her dead.
The other characters in the film seem to be familiar Hollywood types, that as expected in a Lynch film can serve as archetypes: the ""artiste,"" big-shot independent director all dressed in black, the mysterious man with the big telephone seeming to control everything, a cowboy (I won't say anything more, you have to see him to believe!), the junkie waitress (or prostitute?), the totally inept hitman.  Oh, and then there's Coco, the apartment manager, whose look and name seems to be a throwback of the 30's and 40's movie diva!  There are some very hilarious moments in the movie as the audience captively watches still trying to figure out what exactly is going on, and what type of ""conspiracy"" is at foot.
The tricky part of this movie is that just when you think you are grounded, you are not, and disoriented you will totally be.  If you're looking for a movie that mimics the literary principle of deconstruction-- this is it!
The imagery of the movie and its impact on the viewer's mind-- this is Lynch at his directing best.  You leave the movie theatre (or video or DVD) putting the disjointed images together in your mind, finding the symbolic patterns, the cohesive thread of this picture.  Perhaps the most vivid scence is the one in an odd old Hollywood theatre that shows a puzzling performance piece called the ""Silencio.""  The painted Hispanic woman, a woman ""lipsynching"" to a woman singing Roy Orbinson's ""Crying"" in Spanish, the ""gothic"" look of the Depression-era theatre . . .
The only drawback to this movie is that it was originally written to be a pilot of a TV series.  Some characters' identities and their place in this Lynch vision of Hollywood are never developed, unfortunately, probably because they were supposed to be ""regulars"" in the series.  Still, as a film it holds up.  The only warning I may give is that you may want to watch this film a second time to better appreciate it, let alone put the puzzle pieces together!  What I will advise you, dear movie watchter, that if you notice one of the minor characters  doing something very odd, remember it!",1013731200,3,3224,4.827586206896552

This is David Lynch territory and most of the viewers will be extremly confused [I sure was!] yet what you SHOULD expect is nasty characters, plot twists by the barrel-full...
The movie begins with our heroine [Laura Harring] complaining to her limo driver about stopping on a deserted road called Mulholland Dr. He threatens to shoot her yet the car is tossed from the road by joy riders and our heroine stumbles out of the crash, un-hurt yet confused...SHE HAS AMNESIA! She sleeps in a house belonging to the Aunt of perky stardome hopeful Betty [Naomi Watts]. Betty and ""Rita"" go on a search to find out her real identity and become mixed up in the shenanigans of a Hollywood film director Adam Kesher [Justin Theroux] and the hot shot producers urging him to find a replacement lead actress after his lead actress mysteriously disappears...
Where this movie lacks in plot, it makes up for in great performances. The REAL star of the show is Naomi Watts who perfectly captures Betty's innocence and ambition. Laura Harring and Justin Theroux also do great work yet they are acted off the screen by Naomi. I have never before seen a David Lynch film yet after seeing this, I have a sudden urge to rent Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks. This showcases all the weird delights of Hollywood film making!

1489941,5,B00005JKJA,"I'd never seen any David Lynch film before I saw ""Mulholland Drive"", bar the final twenty minutes of ""Wild At Heart"" where Willem Dafoe blows his head off and Nicolas Cage wonders through the film with a painfully large broken nose. To be honest, critic appreciation and its winning untold prizes drew me to it; and I am glad to say that for once the critics are right ... ""Mulholland Drive"" is easily the best film to be released in 2001, a towering achievement in terms of direction, acting, tone, menace, comedy and beauty. The effect it leaves you with afterwards is like that of a potent, lucid dream; and it makes the painfully clear point that Hollywood isn't so great at playing weirdo-parade than the indies are (compare Lynch's tour-de-force to Cameron Crowe's bland ""Vanilla Sky"" and you'll see what I mean).
A lot of people walked out of ""Mulholland"" totally perplexed and bemused, many saying that the director deliberately made an infuriating mess of a film just to see the critics and arthouse crowds clamour for more 'dangerous' filmmaking without realising how ineffectual it is as a thriller or even a cohesive film. In response to this: 1) if they want an easy-to-follow thriller, they can rent ""Ronin"" or something; 2) ""Mulholland"" is not in any way a thriller; 3) people are allowed to read into a film as much as they deem necessary and if it flies over most people's heads, where's the harm in liking it? For me, ""Mulholland"" crammed everything a great film could be into a tight two-and-a-half hour running time: comedy, romance, tragedy, horror, lesbianism ... the only thing missing, of course, was a monkey. I can't reveal anything about the film's plot / story, other than you can only watch it for yourself to find out what the hell I'm writing about! So, please, do that!
Not only is it's mixing of genres thoroughly enjoyable, but aesthetically, it sweeps the board. The photography, from the guy behind ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Scream"" and its two sequels, is beautiful, the camerawork in keeping with the noir sensibilities the film adopts in its first two thirds and the editing superb. The acting, particularly, is amazing; Justin Theroux is suitably befuddled throughout, Laura Elena Harring belies her gorgeous looks with an equally beautiful performance and Naomi Watts ... if the world wasn't as cruel as it is (or if the Academy wasn't so susceptible to Hollywood actresses), this woman would win the Oscar hands down. The audition scene, particularly, is an acting masterclass; it is every wannabe actor's dream envisioned and emblazoned on the big screen.
That said, ""Mulholland"" is the best film I've seen in a long time; Oscar nominations should be handed out for film, director, actress, original screenplay, photography, editing and score immediately without hesitation. It's not going to get them though, seeing as most people did't walk into the theater knowing what they were letting themselves in for. My advice: let it wash over you, like a dream, don't try to pinpoint an exact story but try to remember the moments and piece your path back together. Thought ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Memento"", even ""Vanilla Sky"" were weird? Well, you haven't seen nothing yet!",1013385600,11,3204,4.913284132841328
1489942,4,B00005JKJA,"Though this was a slow paced movie, in my opinion, it was very well written and all of the characters combined made this film receive a 4/5.
Billy Bob Thornton plays a depressed married man who is second-chair in a Barber shop. Quite content at cutting the hair off people without the 'razzle-dazzle' in which his brother-in-law Frank does superbly ( played by Michael Badalucco ), he suddenly is pushed into a surreal situation. A bald buy walks into the shop wanting a trim and there begins his story of an unparalleled series of mishaps.
It is heavily narrated by Ed Krane ( played by Billy Bob Thornton ) and it is obvious as to why it is so at the end of the movie. Without giving anything away, it will make perfect sense why this is the case.
Set in the 1940's and filmed in Black and White, it is uniquely filmed and has a great character base. Everyone has a roll to play in this movie which helps it unwind and unravel as time goes along and each putting in a performance which generates a true interest in the movie.
Some people may not like this movie and I probably wouldn't blame them. It starts off very slowly and doesn't really pick up the pace, however, given that the script is written to perfection it does compensate itself well.
Finally, it is one of those movies you either love or loathe. I liked it and I'm sure many will - but comsumer beware. If you're after some type of black 'n' white gangster movie with guns and cars then think again. In fact, don't bother with this movie if your thinking is like that. It is well written with a dark insight to a man who just was in the wrong spot at the wrong time - so it would seem.
Overall, it didn't really have the climax I was after at any time during the movie, however, I'll definately give it 4/5. Absolutely fantastic..!!",1013212800,,1799,4.341246290801187
1489943,5,B00005JKJA,"A riveting and innovative meta-cinematic masterpiece! In true postmodern fashion this film brilliantly explores the narcissistic and schizophrenic nature of Hollywood and the individual.
A complex labyrinth of love, confused and reconstructed  identity, naivete, broken dreams, and heartache, Mulholland Drive mirrors the film industry which reflects back to us our own dream worlds. The audience is doubly seduced into becoming riddle-solvers like Oedipa Maas in Thomas Pynchon's novel The Crying of Lot 49, and like  Betty (Watts) and Rita (Harring) themselves, trying to make sense out of Drive's ostensibly inexplicable connections, ever-shifting identities and occurrences, and surrealism. Is leaves us wondering: is there such a thing as an authentic or fixed identity? Do demons emerge, as they do for Diane, when we lose ourselves and our ""true"" identities within our dream worlds (be they in the movies or in our own imaginations)? Or is the fluidity of identity more appealing and perhaps more real than what we perceive as ""real""?
The two moments in the film that best affirm existential value are the love scene between Betty and Rita, rendered with utmost tenderness, and Del Toro's beautiful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's ballad ""Crying,"" during which one is compelled to cry along with Betty and Rita, to cry at the simultaneous beauty and ugliness that marks human existence and the many-sided, multi-layered and contradictory state of the human soul that Drive mirrors so well.
The film's end seduces the audience with a reminder, ""Silencio...,"" but Drive seduces us to be anything but silent.",1012953600,4,1615,5.379446640316205

The possibility of classic tragedy may be long long lost to us, but Lynch,  embedding time and spatial dislocations throughout Mulholland's narrative, achieves a poetic alchemy in which a newly invented dimension of the tragic emerges from the cosmic wormholes that cascade through the film's partitioned structure. Frankly, I can think of no film that narrates emotion as this does, as if through a veil of tears with a little string theory thrown in. Quite Extraordinary!",1012867200,4,564,5.266666666666667

Then there are some movies I can never forget, and don't want to. Mulholland Drive is one of them. However long I live, when someone asks me to list my favorite movies of all time, I have no doubt that this will be on that list. Melodramatic statements aside, yes, I like it that much.
At first viewing, the movie is a collection of strange, eerie scenes, some of which are hauntingly beautiful. Initially, I was utterly confused (as were most). But after some hard thinking, I made the connection between the first and second part of the movie. There is a point to the movie; there is a story; there is a meaning. And understanding the movie with that perspective elevates it from a quirky, but strangely compelling visual spectacle to a masterpiece. In the end, Mulholland Drive is a common, tragic story, told in a novel way. It's worth taking the time to think about it; even doing a web-search on analysis of the movie if it doesn't make sense. The epiphany is worth the time spent.
The great movies are the ones where, after it is done, you sit in your seat and say, ""Why can't more movies be like this?"" The great movies make you realize how un-great most movies are. Mulholland Drive is one of those great movies...
... Okay, well, here goes: from the first limo ride scene up to the point Rita opens the box is a dream, concocted by Diane Selwin. The events in the first part have to be taken in ""dream context"". Look at it in that perspective and then try to form connections between dream and reality. That's the beauty of this film. Example: notice the name of the director when it's Betty and the old guy, and the name of the director said during the dinner party. Same name, Bob Brooker. Now, why did he say what he did in the dream sequence? Hmmmm.... MD is left to multiple interpretations of the small scenes as well as the movie as a whole. MD still generates thoughts and theories even when other movies, even other good movies, don't haunt my mind at all. That is why I love this movie...",1012694400,,2012,4.411290322580645

Yes, the actors change who they play for no obvious reason. Go figure. There are also mini elf-people, a guy dressed in a bigfoot costume (I'm not joking), and a million-hour-long rehearsal of Sole Mio which ends in the singer dying or something. Essentially, the movie is pointless and random, as well as painfully long.

1489948,5,B00005JKJA,"I found ""Mulholland Drive,"" directed by David Lynch, to be a truly stunning piece of cinema. The film stars the luminous Naomi Watts as a wholesome blonde who arrives in Hollywood with dreams of becoming a movie star. She soon becomes entangled with an exotic brunette, played by the voluptuous Laura Elena Harring, who has recently survived a terrible trauma. The two team up to solve the mystery behind the experience of Harring's character.
""Mulholland Drive"" is funny, absurd, nightmarish, erotic, frightening, startling, surreal, grotesque, voyeuristic, and just plain weird. It combines a crime mystery with a love/lust story and a satire on Hollywood. The film is ultimately like a jigsaw puzzle that the viewer must assemble in his or her mind.
Harring is excellent, and there is a hilarious cameo by Billy Ray Cyrus. Ann Miller is fun as a flamboyant landlady. Watts, who looks like a young Grace Kelly in this role, is truly amazing in superb, multifaceted performance. The marvelous cast is greatly complemented by great production values; the film is really a feast for the eyes. A great soundtrack (both score and vocals) further enhances the total cinematic experience.
""Mulholland Drive"" is a reality-warping trip that could, I imagine, inspire many different interpretations. This film is real cinematic food for the brain; although many will likely gag on it, I devoured it with gusto -- maybe you will too.",1012521600,18,1424,5.115879828326181

1490028,5,B00005JKJA,"In spite of the doubters who cite ""unnecessary"" salacious elements and those who condemn Lynch for being pretentious and nonsensical, Mulholland Dr., mostly the protracted dream of an aspiring actress, is a very moralistic movie, scouring the depravity of Hollywood in a film that is absorbing, consuming, and powerful, dealing with themes of success, ambition, and megalomania on the scale of Citizen Kane. An aspiring actress, scorned by her lover and scorned by Hollywood, commits a hideous crime and then, regretting her actions, has a drug-deranged fantasy-nightmare that attempts to recollect all the pieces of her life. We see her futile attempt to dream about all her longings and Lynch sucks us into this aspiring woman's world. Much of the film's power is the contrast between the false innocence of middle-America juxtaposed with the seedy corruption of Hollywood. Both elements feed off the other and are in a way each other's Shadow, in the Jungian sense. About a hundred minutes into the movie you see what Lynch is up to in terms of the the parallel worlds of Diane, the real actress, and Betty, her dream-induced alter-ego, and what you end up with is a variation of the Citizen Kane theme, someone hellishly isolated in her personal ambition and regrets. There is a scene in ""Club Silencio"" where we see real weeping and mourning and this is indicative of the tone for Lynch's real compassion and anguish for what he sees as the depravity of Hollywood, which is, more than a city, a sensibility that informs and shapes the attitudes of the entire planet. Lynch should be praised for combining so much heart, imagination, and wit in this movie. Mulholland Dr. is a film about the nihilism that results from blind ambition, but its moralistic stance never descends into nihilism. Each scene is a very engaging story of its own so that even those who don't understand the full story-line of Mulholland Dr. will never be bored by this very beautiful and often disturbing movie.",1012176000,39,1990,4.943283582089553
1490029,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch movies are kind of like enjoying ""The Telltale Heart"" while being enormously grateful you aren't Edgar Allan Poe. Part of you realizes that he can rattle you because he explores the shadowy regions of the soul that you try to ignore.
Lynch's movies (with the glorious exception of ""The Elephant Man"") and TV shows (""Twin Peaks"") are usually mired in self-indulgent non sequitirs, pointless nonconformities, and dwarf fetishes. ""Mulholland Drive"" still has enough of those qualities to put many people off but it redeemed itself - for me - by searing itself into my conciousness. I rolled my eyes a few times but I was also captivated by seeing some of humanity's greatest dreams, nightmares, and - above all - self-deceptions on the screen.
And this is the difficult part. This isn't a narrative story with a sequential plotline and ""three acts and an emotional climax"" storytelling. You have to strap your thinking cap on and tap into your own past experiences to ""get"" this movie. If you need some escapism, this ain't the place to go. But if you're in the mood for some symbolism, mysticism, and often disturbing psychological drama, give this a try.
Part of the film's magic is the drive home, where you say, ""Of course! That's what the cowboy at the gates represents!"" Or the morning after when you think, ""Now I get the pillow at the beginning,"" while brushing your teeth.",1011744000,2,1390,4.820083682008368
1490030,3,B00005JKJA,"What the heck is going on in this movie?  Is it a dream?  No, not exactly.  More like David Lynch's real-life nightmare; Mulholland Drive is a very adpet last-chance compromise for a project that wasn't meant to be.
Basically, the movie originated as a t.v. show, but the pilot got rejected.  So, using the actual footage from the pilot, lynch decided to transform a serial television series - which would have presumably developed over a couple of years - into a two hour movie.  He got a few million dollars and wrapped the thing up with an additional 45 minutes or so of footage.  You can see the remnants of this all over the place in the movie - first and foremost, its an inexplicable enigma, an absolute mess with no sense or logic to it all.  'Oh, but that's just lynch.'  'It was all a dream.'  'It's a parallel dimension.'  'It's schizophrenia.'  wrong.  it's a big cop-out.  The reason it doesn't make sense is quite simple:  there is too much too make sense of; it was intended to be flushed out through a few seasons on t.v. There are plot developments which are left hanging, such as the two detectives at the beginning of the movie, that probably would have been addressed in another episode of the television show.

the funny thing is, every single scene in the movie is masterfully crafted, and for that lynch deserves some credit.  And the acting is wonderful. But, when you put it all together, it doesn't quite work.",1010966400,5,1436,4.55078125
1490031,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch has outdone himself in this cautionary tale on the perils of Hollywood.  Mulholland Drive draws the viewer into a nightmarish labyrinth that could have come from the pages of a Jorge Luis Borges novel - a swirling vortex of dream and reality that pulls you into the sometimes comical, often terrifying but ultimately tragic experience of Diane Selwyn, an aspiring actress who finds herself way over her head in a decayed, heartless Los Angeles.
With superficial homages to Chinatown and Sunset Boulevard, more accurately Mulholland Drive resembles Persona, Three Women, and Jacob's Ladder in questioning the nature of individual identity and reality, as Diane's psyche shatters into the perky, rational Betty and the emotional, frightened Rita.  The viewer may be frustrated in searching for a logical narrative, but (for those willing to suspend disbelief) on an emotional, almost subliminal level the pieces fall into place.  (Just for the record, Lynch outlines the bare bones of the narrative, almost as an afterthought, at the dinner party, when Coco's questions draw the pertinent details from Diane.)  As in any maze, there are frustrating false leads (the Mafia angle) and dead ends (the black book) , but the emotional momentum of the film builds to an overwhelming feeling of dread and existential terror, that culminates in Diane's final escape from her broken dream.
This tour de force uses images and themes galore (bags, boxes, keys, mirrors, and reflected images) as signposts in Diane's journey, too many to discuss here, but I have to mention the dream within a dream which outlines the story: the short segment of the two men (analogues to Rita and Betty) in the cafe.  The dark haired dreamer is led on by the rational detective in the same way that Rita is led by Betty, in Nancy Drew fashion, into the Sierra Bonita apartment.  Both scenes result in a confrontation with death incarnate, and anticipate the enigmatic performance piece ""Silencio"".  As Betty and Rita cry and cling to each other, they watch Diane's pain and death in yet another guise - the singer who collapses onstage.  Having unlocked the box of her own mortality, for Diane (as it will be for us all one day) the rest is silence.
Naomi Watts and Laura Harring are amazing in their roles, and the rest of the cast is first rate, especially Ann Miller as the perceptive, no-nonsense Coco.  The score, editing, and cinematography all contribute to help make this David Lynch's most impressive film to date.",1010707200,23,2505,4.988009592326139
1490032,5,B00005JKJA,"Only David Lynch knows what this is about.  I don't pretend to understand it.  I don't think anyone really understands it.  They may have opinions about it and that, I think is the point of this film.  It's not narratively friendly at all.  People who need closure will not like ""silencio"" as a final scene.  The film evokes feeling.  It's a series of scenes loosely, if at all connected.  But each scene is like a film unto itself.  They all fit together in the puzzle that is this film, because they don't belong in any other.  I hate people who have simplified this film as ""a dream"".  That's an easy way out.  It could be a dream, but that's not the definition of this film.  This film, to me, seems like a look inside Lynch's mind.  It could be a look into our mind, because it makes us ask ourselves, ""what is going on here?""  It is absolutely enjoyable to one person and the worst piece of dreck to another, and either opinion is completely valid.  I think this film will appeal to fans of ""Memento"".  It should also appeal to Lynch's breed and to people who enjoy a visceral experience.  This film is an experience.
The camerawork is top-notch.  The music couldn't be better.  The acting is 4 stars.  The film is Lynch's.",1010620800,4,1229,4.397321428571429
1490033,5,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch will never be able to shock or disorient us again - when we go to his films, we know exactly what we're going to get.  And I think this realisation has liberated him - he can now concentrate on being simply brilliant.  'Mulholland Dr.' is easily his best work since 'Blue Velvet'.  It is one of those rare films that, as you first watch it, you know it is just an introductory taster, that you will revisit it again and again, like 'Vertigo', finding your imagination adapting to its kaleidoscopic movements, taking new paths leading you to different places.
It's a lot like 'Vertigo', actually (right down to Naomi Watts' grey dress-suit), a genuine visual labyrinth without a centre - watching it is like taking a journey you can never end.  It does for LA what Hitchcock's film did for San Francisco, and in its tale of doubles, dreams, transformations, ghosts, inexplicable crimes, shadowy conspiracies, intimations of violence, alternative stories and parallel universes, overpowering emotions, fetishes and tenderness, fragments and juxtapositions, it resurrects certain ghosts of the city - its mythic dream of d.i.y. success; Hollywood's sordid lengends and failures beneath the bright glamour and success; its Spanish history submerged by cowboy greed.
Like 'Vertigo', like 'Blue Velvet', 'Mulholland' is a psychic journey that is also a trip through a real space; it is full of gateways, dark passages and locked (Pandora's) boxes opening onto proliferating dimensions.  It is an amateur detective story that leads from genre into the self, into one's sexuality, into one's own breakdown.  The story begins with a radiant innocent freed from parental authority, like Jeffrey Beaumont, with wholesome dreams, who discovers the rotting temporality of the body.
Lynch has been here before (the film can also be seen as a female counterpart to 'Lost Highway'), but this time the merely weird is transcended, the odd fragments rooted in a sublime and generous and vulnerable central relationship, shoring against the ruins of identity, memory and the Infernal Hollyood machine, whose seductive fires entice its willing victims towards it.  Lynch's use of space and spatial relations (especially up and below) is as masterly as that of sound, composition and performance.  The familiar, barmy Lynchian self-contained scenes of deadpan comedy and vicious violence (including the most hilariously inept hit in cinema history) are now a striking, moving counterpoint to the central, elusive relationship.  The doors to 'Mulholland Dr.' will remain forever open.  And closed.",1010534400,7,2587,5.318627450980392
1490034,5,B00005JKJA,"It's been a long time (probably since 1980's ""Ordinary People"") that a movie has stayed inside my head a full week after seeing it, but ""Mulholland Drive"" refuses to budge.
There is definitely a storyline here, and as time passes after seeing it, quite a clear one. I can't wait to see it again.
I do recommend that you don't see it alone, or at night.
The entire cast shines, but Naomi Watts is a revelation. Give her the Oscar. This is a flat-out star-making performance.",1010448000,,473,4.511627906976744
1490035,4,B00005JKJA,"""Mulholland Drive"" is Federico Fellini meets John Waters! Like a Fellini movie it has grotesque characters, beautiful women, and a caricaturish view of society. It takes these elements and throws in a dash of John Waters for good measure. It has an amateurish quality to it, it feels ""second-rate"" (especially in the first hour of the film), and the dialogue plays off as being hokey, and campy. Just like any ""good"" John Waters' film. Somewhere, somehow, ""Mulholland Drive"" over-comes all of this, and turns itself into an intense modern day noir film.
 I'm not sure how to describe this film without given away the plot. This is one of those films where, the more you know about the movie, the less thrilling it is to go see it. It's best you go unknowing what to expect so you'll be able to discover everything for yourself and decide on your own what everything means. ""Mulholland Drive"" plays a lot of ideas at once, and maybe in someone else's hand it might not work as well. There's a noir story here, a thriller, a romance blooming, and believe it or not, but there are laughs too! It takes all these different genres and combines them. This is without question something I would call ""a thinking person's film"". But, see, that's what I like. I enjoy movies that ask the audience to actually think.
 The acting in this movie by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring is worth the price of admission itself! Just being able to look at them is worth the price of admission! They are great on-screen together and have great chemistry. Each deserves an Oscar nomination for their performance. I must admit though, I do like Watts a bit more. Justin Theroux is amusing in this film as well. He provides some laughs in the film. Believe it or not but ANN MILLER is in this movie! Younger audiences might not remember her, but, she was at one time a great dancer (check out Cole Porter's Kiss Me Kate). Robert Forster and Dan Hedaya have extremely brief roles as well. This was the first David Lynch film I ever saw, and it won't be the last one. I was truly inpressed with this film. I think it's one of the best films of 2001! For people who have an open mind ""Mulholland Drive"" is the film for you.
 p.s. I know I've given a very vague descirption of this film. But, after you've seen it, you'll understand why.",1009843200,7,2306,4.511961722488039
1490036,4,B00005JKJA,"I chuckled throughout this one - the use of typical Lynch motifs such as a midget, soothsayer, a human ashtray hiding behind a dumpster, insanely laughing tom thumb retirees - seemed lightly entertaining, a diverting thriller using the ultra-cliche amnesia plot device. I walked out feeling that this was a deconstruction of Hollywood, from the biz to the idea of plot itself. There was no ""getting"" it, I thought. Several days later, however, I had a conversation with a woman who had been obsessed with the film and came up with the unique interpretation. The second part of the film, she claimed, is the reality, and the first part the dream of the lost woman who put the hit on her ex-lover and betrayer. While I may have to see the film at least one more time to put it all together, I feel like this film can be enjoyed on many levels, but expecting it to behave itself like any standard Hollywood film is to pretend that the body of Lynch's work does not exist. This man is here, he's queer, and I, at least, am happy he keeps getting weirder!",1009584000,2,1050,4.473958333333333
1490037,3,B00005JKJA,"David Lynch is a genius as a stylist.  It's unfortunate that he uses that genius to no purpose.  (A lot like 19th century American painter John Singer Sargent). ""Mulholland Drive"" looks good and has good artistic manners, but as anyone who has dated knows, that doesn't mean that there is anything upstairs.  There is nothing to get.  Like other Lynch movies, symbols (such as the cube & its odd key) are introduced and developed well - up to the point when the director is obliged to reveal and illuminate.  Then, he drops the ball.  Viewers who can get happily drunk on style will be satiated.  Viewers who expect to learn something about moral imperative and the human condition (arguably the key function of art) will wonder why the bother.",1009497600,4,744,4.72093023255814
1490085,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive was my introduction to the brilliant mind of David Lynch - the quintessence of everything I was searching for in art. His examination of what lies beneath the surface of the glitz and glamor of Hollywood, through his use of cycles and repeated imagery, dreamlike non-logic, a pastiche of Hollywood genres (think film noir and the Wizard of Oz), and an eerily perfect score from Badalamenti (sp?), kept me glued to the seat and searching for answers after the credits starting rolling and someone in the audience yelled, ""Don't tell me it's over! What the (...)?!"" But this isn't a film with answers: it's about an open-ended non-interpretable EXPERIENCE. For those of you who like sprawling omniscient Victorian novels and straightforward Cameron Crowe movies (his recent attempt at Lynchian surrealism with Vanilla Sky is ridiuclously horrible for him), Mulholland Drive is NOT for you! For those of you who believe that the more intriguing aspects of experience come from what's in your head (your thoughts, your perceptions, your dreams), then go see this film!",1008633600,6,1081,5.1477272727272725

1490088,5,B00005JKJA,"Mulholland Drive is by far the best film to hit indie picture houses this past year, and probably longer.  Director David Lynch seduces us with the power, and intrigue of Hollywood only to rip us from the fantasy that, unknowingly to us at first, had been slowly decaying before our very eyes as we watch, unable to blink, unwilling to turn away.  And then without warning, reality rears its hideous face from around the corner and unravels everything we thought to be true.  The characters are very complicated, and the story pulls you in from the second it steps out of the car and walks aimlessly into the night.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who has been left feeling empty and unsatisfied by the schlock that Hollywood has been producing this year.  One of the best ad campaigns I can remember was for the Minus Man; its tag line was ""Don't Bring A Dumb Date"".  That line fully extends to this film.",1007164800,2,914,4.5426829268292686
1490089,4,B00005JKJA,"Back in the late 1960s, the film 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was a major hit. (I saw it eight times.) Most of the plot was straightforward: humankind sends a manned space mission to Jupiter to follow-up on an extraterrestrial artifact found on the moon. Then, the ending careened off into surrealism and symbolism, and the audience was left to debate the meaning of it all. I mean, what was with that black monolith, anyhow?
MULHOLLAND DRIVE, though set entirely on the Earth ... well, Hollywood, anyway ... follows much the same trajectory. During the first half or so, there's a reasonably coherent storyline. A way too perky blond, Betty (played by Naomi Watts), arrives starry-eyed in LA from Toronto to seek her fame and fortune in the movies. She has use of her aunt's Hollywood apartment while the latter, also in the Biz, is out of town. While first exploring her new home, she discovers a disoriented woman (Laura Elena Harring), who chooses to call herself Rita, taking a shower. From the first scenes of the film, we know that ""Rita"" narrowly escaped being murdered on MULHOLLAND DRIVE by the fortuitous intervention of a head-on auto crash. Dazedly emerging from one of the cars, she stumbles down the hill into Hollywood and takes refuge in Betty's aunt's apartment, apparently by random choice. In any case, Rita now claims to have amnesia. Betty, being a kind and generous soul from out of town, is determined to help Rita rediscover her identity. So far, fair enough. Then, about halfway into this two and a half hour film, the images on the screen totally detach from reality, or at least from what the viewers might expect as tidy plot evolution. What's with the really scary, homeless derelict living behind Winky's coffee shop? Is he hideously deformed, or just incredibly dirty? We never get a clear enough look to decide, and maybe don't want to. And what of the enigmatic blue cube that he introduces into the plot? (Is it a baby monolith reminiscent of 2001?) Why does Rita have a mysterious key and bundles of $100 bills in her purse? What piece of the puzzle is represented by the putrefying dead girl, Diane, whom Betty and Rita discover in another Hollywood apartment? On a seemingly unrelated tangent, why is director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) being forced (by the Mob?) to select a particular actress for the leading role in his latest film? Strangest of all, who's the inscrutable, Stetsoned cowboy reminiscent of Tom Mix?
One's enjoyment of the film comes from the exquisitely photographed and choreographed individual scenes. They comprise a series of visual vignettes that the viewer can lose him/herself in, though they're incomprehensible in the aggregate. And let's not forget Laura Harring. From the point of view of this piggish male, she ranks right up there with brunettes Monica Belucci and Catherine Zeta-Jones as luscious eye candy to be ogled.
While I still don't understand many elements of this mind-bending movie, if I stand back and squint, I think I can discern the message, and will share it as my personal opinion only. You must decide for yourself.
The key clues, for me, are the characters (or single character?) of Betty and Diane. And the message ... The glamour and glitz of Hollywood is just a faade. Behind it lie corruption, seduction and betrayal that may result in anguish, madness and suicide, even for the truly talented.",1006732800,6,3382,4.873263888888889
1490090,5,B00005JKJA,"I would venture that anyone involved in the, uh, let's call them 'esoteric spiritual arts' who has also lived or manages to live in Hollywood/Los Angeles grasps this disturbing film very easily. When our blonde ingenue gasps to her relative on the phone that ""it's a dream place!"", she doesn't realize how honest she is. To complicate matters, she takes on the film/TV industry and its assortment of manipulators as friends. Duh. Did anyone ever tell her to get a dog?
Lynch's foray into the split/schizo nature of the sunny LA Dream factory has as much in common with the tales of Don Juan by Carlos Casteneda (""The Art of Dreaming"")as anything.  Beneath all his trademark wisecracking, Lynch warns the uninitiated to take Hollywood very, very, very seriously, because it is a place where boundaries dissolve, egos fragment, and the doors to perception swing wide open.
Mulholland Drive is one of his best dread-rides, I call them.  Lynch's facility to establish and maintain mood within a slow pace is at the top of his form here.  It's interesting thta the aborted TV show from which the film sprang, itself, became only a piece of the larger piece of art being born.  Any artist worth his words understands things like that sometimes happen.
In any event, Mulholland Drive has a signature Lynch scene in a strange theatre named Silencio; the ten odd minutes or so are worth the price of admission.  A Machiavellian host gives a little sermon about the fact that ""It"" is all a tape; ""it"" is all illusion.  At once he is discussing, perhaps, the nature of cinema, and the nature of Life.  Then the exquisite Rebekah del Rio sings a Spanish version of ""Crying."" The response of the protoganist is to go into convulsions!!
In minor ways, 'Mulholland Drive' is a trip down ""Siesta"" or ""Owl Creek.."" lane.  But it ventures further, deeper, into frightening realms where Self, sometimes, unwittingly gets dissolved.
It's also very funny. In a dark way, of course.",1006214400,2,1960,4.829850746268657

It's not that those of us who hated this movie ""don't get it."" We are not stupid. Anyone can see that Lynch is trying to mesh together certain images/scenes/characters to create an atmospheric film that says something about a place  - LA, here - or characters without actually telling a traditional, linear story. Fine. Understood.
That being said, it's not near enough. This film took no more skill to create than your average MTV video featuring a montage of things that also, in a way, follow a theme: girls in bikinis, expensive cars, choreographed dancing and macho posturing. [...]

You just have to pay attention and be willing to sit back for a moment and follow all the threads. Sure, there are some characters who are introduced that are just left dangling. So what? The main story line is that of Betty/Diane and Rita/Camilla. That's a clue for all of you who haven't seen it. I won't spoil it. You just have to go and see it for yourself. People are so caught up in how ""weird"" David Lynch is, that they have started reading more into what is actually on the screen. However, what continues to bother me is how people want their films nicely fed to them. They want Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise in romantic comedies or serious dramas where the plot is spoonfed and not a single ounce of thought has to go into it. Yes, I know, movies are supposed to be escapist entertainment, but I like a film that challenges. Why must films tie up all the loose ends nice and neat so when you leave the theater you automatically forget what you've just seen?

I'm happy to say that Mulholland Drive is an unqualified masterpiece.  While there are certainly some loose ends (many doubtless tied to the film's genesis as a TV pilot), for the most part it made perfect and sublime sense to me the first time I watched it.  In fact, while probably not his original intent, Lynch's encapsulation of the first two-thirds of the film as the wishful fantasy of a bitterly frustrated starlet is in my opinion nothing less than brilliant.  Mysterious, playful, thought-provoking and erotic, this is definitely a welcome film for those of us looking desperately for alternatives to the latest romantic comedy or action/adventure flick.",1006041600,,920,5.072847682119205

MAJOR SPOILERS HERE!! DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND PLAN TO!
At its core is a simple love story, albeit a love story gone bad.  As dream becomes reality and reality becomes nightmare, both lead characters have major identity switcheroos that at first leave you scratching your head but in hindsight (or on repeat viewing) you realize just how diabolical this whole set-up is.  In pure Lynchian style, not everything is as it appears to be.
Naomi Watts is DYNAMIC as the flawed and fractured lead that begins so sugary sweet she's too good to be true.  As the story unfolds, we witness how very true that is as Betty becomes Diane and Diane is so diametrically opposed to Betty that it's a profound and shockingly dramatic reversal of character.
Laura Elena Harring is so stunningly beautiful, Lynch gives her far less to do than he does Naomi, but she manages to make her amnesiac Rita a compelling and sympathetic character who then morphs into the sexual predator of Camilla.  Where Diane may have murderous intentions, Camilla maims the heart and soul of those she seduces  and then casts them off as though they were mere distractions in the first place.
Together, Watts and Harring have a chemistry that leaps off the screen.  The sex scenes between them are a bonus of this chemistry, one with the funniest line of logic in sex scene history.  They are erotic but not gratuitous, providing specific turning points in the characters' relationship.
This movie is hypnotic and engrossing.  It's a thrill ride that you simply must give yourself to or else you'll sit there thinking too much to enjoy it.",1005955200,2,2174,4.704485488126649

If you like to actually use your mind when you watch a film, you will not be dissapointed with Milholland drive.  I am a big Lynch fan, but not a blind one.  As others have said, Lost Highway was a dud for me, with to much ""art"" and not enough plot.
That said, M.D. DID have a complete plot, and many here obviously did not get it because it is non-linear and makes you decipher what was real and what was a dream.  Personally, I like movies like Momento and Pulp Fiction that reveal why things happend AFTER the fact, so you get more of a sense of the progression of story and time.  M.D. does this very successfully, and it takes a full viewing and some thought afterward to sort out what really happend and what didn't.  I will buy the DVD and I'm sure I will see more upon every viewing, and thats what I love about Lynch.  If it's not your bag, go see Shrek.

1490146,2,B00005JKJA,"Many people will leave the theatre, after having seen this film, and find themselves confused.  I am not afraid to admit that I am one of them.  Perhaps, our kind has not the mental capacity to capture the truth in this film.  Immediately after leaving the theatre, I rushed home to read reviews of Mulholland Drive in the hopes of discovering what it meant and what other people thought about it.  What I found is that perhaps us who did not comprehend the film, vainly and ignorantly sought a complete image, of which this film deliberately does not offer.
One review that I read was that of Roger Ebert, who praises the film because it is only glimpses of dreams, never a complete story, without a thorough plot, and frequently introducing elements that it negligently abandons later on.  For the average viewer--myself included--this seems unsatisfying and utterly pointless.  However, I will not criticize it for this reason, and state simply that those people looking for a complete and appealing story, from beginning to end--not necessarily in that order--will be disappointed, as I was, when nothing is resolved.  In fact the action on the screen appears almost counterproductive.
But, of the individual elements of the film, I still could not enjoy.  The direction--though Lynch received a best director award at Cannes--I found deliberately and unsatisfactorily hokey.  In fact, because of the oftentimes silly use of camera, the main actresses' performances were laughable to the fullest degree.  Moreover, some situations--the crazy prophetic tenant comes to mind--were so silly and utterly stupid that the audience broke down in laughter at the downright idiotic events occurring onscreen.  Many times, as Mr. Ebert stated, characters would be introduced and later prove to have almost no significance to warrant their screen time.  If I wanted this kind of entertainment, I could eavesdrop on conversations in a diner--but I think that we as a civilization have gone beyond that.
So, how do I summarize my experience while viewing the film?  Well, I was almost embarrassed for the director and actors, because the film came across as such a poorly made film.  Despite the--deserved--audience laughter, there was talk on the way out as to whether ANYONE truly got it.  Meanwhile everything that the plot presents COULD HAVE created something resembling a plot that would have been more than satisfying to the audience.  The surrealistic elements could have been maintained, while still toned down, and perhaps the experience would have proved to be mildly entertaining in the respect that a film is supposed to be.  In the end, I think that is what sinks this picture--Lynch tries too hard to be unique that he brings the rest of the production down with him.  Unfortunately, very little succeeds--But, HEY, it made me think.  The question is, Does that equal the price of admission?  I have to say NO.",1005523200,4,2916,5.060669456066946
1490147,1,B00005JKJA,"Okay, the title of my view refers to what the other ...P>Weird for weird's sake
With that said, there were paaaallllenteeee of times I was ready to walk out of this ""film"".  The only problem was, I was sitting in the middle of an aisle and I would have disturbed too many people who were catching up on their zzs.
At this point, I suppose it would help if I gave you all some sort of plot summary. Since there was no plot, I'll skip around randomly-- which is fitting, given this ""film"".  So there's this ""girl"" from Canada (altough she turns out to be someone else later, although it looks like her but with a different nose).  Anyway, she's an aspiring actress. She can obviously act because there is one scene in which she displays an incredible ability to deliver lines.  Up until that point, she has been directed (for the ""film"") to act as though she were someone who couldn't act, but was trying to act as if she could act, in real life (although she was acting).  Got it?  There's this other woman (with a spackled face, but that's beside the point), but she was tripping and I just can't get into it. The rest of the characters are typical ""Lynchian""- bizarre-- not to further the plot-- not for entertainment's sake-- just because.  How's that!?
The best part is, you will actually come out of the ""film"" trying to piece elements together.  Forget it.. nothing is explained and you have to take HUGE leaps and throw any kind of logic out the door.  And you will *waste* time thinking about it-- because none of the characters is even remotely interesting enough to warrant it. (Oh, pro-""Mullers"", save the ""scary cowboy"" bit.. the strawberry blond wimp, as the anti hero of the ""film"".  His image conjures up Forrest Gump. ""Stupid is as Stupid Does"".  This guy is the same kid who used to pass gas and light matches behind the Shell station on Oak Street, now all grown up and on the big screen!)
I realize I run the risk of p-ing off all the Lynch devotees.. the people who watched Twin Peaks for a year talking stupid details.  These are the same people who put jelly donuts back on the map, so they have formidable persuasive power. Don't listen to them!  You will really hate yourself if you see this movie, especially if you read my review first.

1490149,5,B00005JKJA,"A beautiful brunette, losing her memory in a car accident, breaks into a Beverly Hills apartment and hides there. A perky blonde arrives in Los Angeles to audition for a movie. Sinister money men tell an arrogant young director that they'll pull the plug on his latest movie unless he hires the actress of their choice. It seems like the start of an multilayered Hollywood mystery a' la James Ellroy or Robert Altman, and at first in ""Mulholland Drive"" David Lynch seems to be paying homage especially to Altman. But don't worry, folks--Lynch has never been more Lynchian than in this brooding, gorgeous, doom-laden nightmare of a movie. This is Lynch's masterpiece to date, exceeding even ""Blue Velvet"" and ""The Straight Story;"" it is amazing how he subverts all our expectations and defies all storytelling logic, and yet gives us a fully satisfying tale of terror. He presents lots of red herrings and leaves about 50,000 loose plot ends, but Lynch has always relied not on the logic of suspense, but of nightmare. The last half-hour of this film inverts everything we've been told during the first two hours, and the last five minutes--which audaciously skirt the edge of the ridiculous--are perhaps the most terrifying ever put on film. I found myself with mouth agape at the end, amazed at what I'd seen and what Lynch had gotten away with. Peter Deming's photography is a marvel of stark color and imaginative use of light and shadow; the mostly unknown cast is superb. (I might add that Laura Elena Harring, as the brunette, is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen on screen, bar none.) Even Roger Ebert, a veteran Lynch-hater, was wowed by this.

1490151,4,B00005JKJA,"One has come to expect the unusual and quirky from David Lynch, as well as an immersion into the fine line between reality and fantasy, ordinary life and madness. While not as tightly and well articulated as Lynch's masterpiece ""Blue Velvet"", ""Mulholland"" is a worthy part of Lynch's oeuvre and deserves to be seen. It is more than any other of his films his sidewise glance at the vagaries of Hollywood, with its Mafia-like producers, its hustlers, henchmen, and hopefuls. It is like a collage crafted of kitsch items, pasted together into an affecting but improbable narrative, in which accidents interfere with attempted asassinations, personalities switch between personae, and characters experience the lows and highs of fictional degradation or glory. From stark bright-eyed innocence to suicidal degradation, female characters switch their destinies, connected briefly through lesbian liasons and then emotional estrangement. Male characters are assaulted by other brawnier males, who themselves are finally demolished by ironclad thugs. There are no winners in ""Mulholland Drive"" and no characters are either black or white, though the mood swerves from candy-colored light to the gloom of purgatory. Some characters may be caricatures, like the immobilized movie mogul in his barren throne room, and the fifties do-wop singers, girl singers in pastels and swoony vocals, while others like the young ingenue deepen into startingly deep characterizations. Lynch does not condemn as much as encapsulate the bittersweet but saccharine flavor of a concocted environment, a Hollywood of the mind like a Coney Island in which spectators and freaks are interchangable, and the roller coaster ride through the Hollywood Hills and the ominous boulevards poses more questions than answers can provide.",1004659200,,1799,5.545454545454546
1490152,5,B00005JKJA,"Now comes ""Mulholland Drive,"" and while it follows the same story arc of ""Lost Highway"" in many respects (the flip-flop between reality and an alternative reality, the doppelganger shift of characters, the &#8220;mystery men&#8221; who seem to control the machinations of change and stability in the Lynch-universe), but seems less abusive in terms of audience suture with what's occurring on the screen.  Quite frankly, where &#8220;Lost Highway&#8221; left me cold and irked, &#8220;Mulholland Drive&#8221; left me catatonic as I left the theater... all of Los Angeles seemed strange and off-kilter, and the film left me incredibly sad as well... melancholy and unnerved.  And I rather liked that feeling.  Why the difference in the two films to me?  &#8220;Mulholland Drive&#8221; seemed like an L.A. story, unlike &#8220;Lost Highway&#8221; which felt like a road to nowhere (probably its point).  &#8220;MD&#8221; had characters with obvious qualities and motivations, whereas &#8220;LH&#8221; had zombies who apparently never felt anything but a feeling of dread (Fred, in particular).  &#8220;MD&#8221; had a love story.  &#8220;LH&#8221; had a sex story.  Where &#8220;LH&#8221; felt vapid and uncontrolled, &#8220;MH&#8221; feels emotive and assured in its handling of the basic story.  Quibbles, quibbles, quibbles, just my feelings on the two films... and I'm a huge Lynch fan, experiencing his films chronologically for most of my life (save for his short films, which I've just seen recently).  &#8220;Mulholland Drive&#8221; had an air of inevitability about it, and a tragic one at that.  You just knew these two women were bound as if they were stuck with Crazy Glue, and destined to be torn apart from each other.  Like &#8220;LH&#8221; it has its obtuse moments, but the overwhelming love story between Betty and &#8220;Rita&#8221; is the crux of the matter here, and it works!  The &#8220;Club Silencio&#8221; scene is one of the absolute saddest scenes in any movie I've ever seen (at least one where it was not obvious the director was pulling at the audience's heartstrings... it's almost as if Lynch just birthed the scene, put it out there for all to experience, and let it virally infect the viewer on its own).  Amazing!
I watch &#8220;Lost Highway&#8221; from time to time (as well as Lynch's other extraordinary films, though the closest antecedent to &#8220;Mulholland Drive&#8221; is, in my humble opinion, &#8220;Lost Highway&#8221;) and it still leaves me cold like the zombified characters who go through its Lynchian moments.  When &#8220;Mulholland Drive&#8221; arrives on DVD, I'll have to prepare an evening to see it and then time to weep and deal with the emotions it plants in my psyche.  It deserves the praise it's getting and certainly ranks with &#8220;Eraserhead,&#8221; &#8220;The Elephant Man&#8221; and &#8220;Blue Velvet&#8221; as an extraordinary piece of his cinematic canon.",1004486400,,2926,5.4402654867256635
1490153,5,B00005JKJA,"What a great movie for the non-linear cinema fan.  I disagree with some of the other reviewers here: this movie is explicable and eminently approachable.  The two ""halves"" are not as precisely divided as some have said... think instead of two layers or environments, reality and dream (or hallucination), that intertwine, occasionally touching, occasionally diverging, to finally merge in colloidal uneasiness near the end.  There may debate as to which scenes belong to which layers, too.  That said, there are at least three currents to follow if you include the ever-present fabulous matter (represented in this movie by the blue key and other artifacts) that soaks Lynch's work and, in this example, somehow completely ties things together for me.  You must pay attention from the beginning.  Consider narrative sequence only one of several paths.  Some of the loops and connections are obvious, some not so obvious, and some sufficiently ambiguous (or completely vestigial, perhaps?) to keep you thinking long after the movie is over.  Beautifully, cast, photographed, and acted, Mulholland Drive offers intellectual engagement of the abstract kind.  What more could you want?",1004313600,10,1181,5.409836065573771
1490154,5,B00005JKJA,"""Mulholland Drive"", like most of Lynch's work, is not meant to be understood in a rational way.  It is a movie of ethereal beauty, one of Lynch's best, in my opinion.  This is true Lynchian magic, and if you want to know why he has such a devoted cult following, you should definitely see this movie.
In this particular film I think Lynch is trying to provoke us, even enrage us, by openly ridiculing our basically relative and ultimately bogus ideas of 'identity' or 'reality'.  The movie opens with a botched murder attempt, and from there spirals into a darkly erotic and dreamlike tale of madness, amnesia, mystery, and troubled beauty.  The scene in the theater is maybe one of the most unforgettable and hypnotic scenes I've ever encountered in a movie, and surrealism addicts (like myself) will be engrossed by it from start to finish.  A masterpiece.",1004313600,,858,4.77027027027027
1490212,5,B00005JKJA,"I had the priviledge of viewing this picture while i was in New York on the day it came out, and I know this movie isn't all over the country packing theaters, but it should be. Why you might ask? Because it's filled with art, culture, and it should make anyone free their mind and keep an open mind. The performances were spectacular, the screenplay was surreal and phenominal, and Lynch is just a genius as a film maker. Let's just say this movie was so good that i'd pay 20 bucks just to see it again on the big screen. This is the only movie in history where i walked out of theater saying ""I loved that movie so much, but I didn't understand it.""",1004227200,2,651,4.174603174603175
1490213,5,B00005JKJA,"To understand Mulholland Drive, I had to see it twice, though I'm still not sure I fully understood it. The first time I saw it I was puzzled by the last third of the movie, not quite sure who was who, what was dream, what was fantasy, what was hallucination, and what was real. After watching it a second time, I came to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter. Like the MC said at the Club Silencio: ""All is illusion.""
I was impressed with David Lynch's unwillingness to allow the viewer to arrive at any pat, easy interpretations of his movie. I wanted to leave the theater wondering what I had just seen, to ruminate over certain scenes and images without losing that intriguing sense of mystery that pervades most of David Lynch's work. I think the movie is some type of delirious fantasy in the mind of the Diane Selwyn character shortly before her suicide, and that Betty and Rita are imaginary selves in some type of virtual reality, but then, that doesn't explain everything. And so be it.
Many of the scenes are complete unto themselves. I loved the movie audition in which an actress sings ""Sixteen Reasons,"" followed by another auditioning actress singing ""I Told Every Little Star."" Leave it up to David Lynch to make something so sweet and innocent seem so sinister and chilling. I also loved the scene involving the movie director and the Cowboy up on the hill. I found it funny how the Cowboy said things without really saying anything, so typical of how we talk in our dreams.
Overall, this movie is the story of so many aspiring actresses who come to Hollywood with stars in their eyes, but who fail in their ambitions and end up in a world they never expected.",1004227200,,1684,4.561056105610561

1490215,5,B00005JKJA,"The latest from Lynch is another in his long line of innovative and challenging films. Many viewers have repeated the often invoked criticism that the movie ""does not make sense"". As far as Lynch films go, Mulholland Drive offers a number of possible explanations for those who need tidy resolutions and linear storytelling. The most plausible, it would seem to me, is that the first 2/3 or so are a ""dream"" or ""fantasy"" and the final half-hour is the ""reality"". Whether you agree or disagree, however, this is what makes this film, as well as most others from Lynch, so great. He is the rare director who does not ""dictate"" from the director's chair; instead he allows the viewers to form their own impressions of the artwork. Final Note: Naomi Watts, who essentially is the centerpiece of the film, does an incredible job and offers a spectacular performance (and it does not hurt that she is VERY HOT!).

It could also mean that nothing is real and all the world is just one big illusion, one big nothing. It was wildly capitivating but logic was not part of the agenda.

This, like his sci-fi nightmare ""Lost Highway"" is a gargantuan ""Twilight Zone"" crashing through the roof of stability and meaning and then plunging into the depths of complexity and bombastic film noir. But unlike ""Lost Highway"" which dropped me off the journey without a hitch back to the impossible plot, I was with ""Mulholland Dr."" for every curve in the road, studying landmarks and tossing bread crumbs like Hansel and Gretal hoping to find my way back to Mulholland Drive. It didn't matter because the whole thing soon explodes into a splendid visual and literal horizon of L.A. decadence barreling over any sign posts it may have made on the way. It's something like a Hollywood Hills cocktail party from Hell. Maybe something to do with the death of Marilyn Monroe. It's like flipping through the pages of old black and white movie magazines of car crashes and dead celebrities. It is the adult nightmare that belongs to a 5 year-old.

It's best not to read about the plot--just see the movie. It will have you dreaming for days on end. It's densly layered and demands multiple viewings. Don't be dismayed by the fact it was a rejected tv pilot; it works perfectly as a feature film and all the plot points, even those that seem arbitrary, fit in the end.
Much has been said of Naomi Watt's acting, and for good reason--her performance is amazing. The audition scene alone broke my heart.
Another actor who deserves mentioning (who seems to be neglected in reviews) is Justin Theroux. He's hillarious as the aggravated director. Watch his reaction shots as his life spirals downhill--priceless. His meating with the ""Cowboy"" will surely be a fan favorite.
