1239197,5,B00000JYWY,"To the uninitiated, HANDS ON A HARDBODY may vaguely sound like it's a porn film or perhaps a film about a ""fluffer"" or someone involved in oiling up muscles in a body building contest.  To those more familiar with vehicles, a ""hardbody"" is the term for a Nissan pickup truck.  The ""hands"" fit into S. R. Bindler's documentary courtesy of the 1994 ""Hands on a Hardbody"" competition.  This annual contest at a Longview, Texas Nissan dealership has contestants place a hand on a well-equipped truck.  The last person to take their hand off the truck wins it.

  It's an endurance test; a contest of wills.

  Director Bindler does a terrific job, introducing the audience to the contestants, the rules, the attitudes, and the strategies.  We hear the voice of experience via Benny Perkins, the winner of the 1992 contest who has returned to earn a second truck.  Perkins describes his mindset and the course of action he used during his first attempt; ""If you eat something like [a hamburger] it'll bring you down.""

  In a tournament of time and endurance, HANDS ON A HARDBODY has nary a dull moment.  As the hours tick by, Bindler interjects interviews with participants and contrasts them with on-the-spot insight.  We see attitudes shift and fortitude fold or fortify.  As the twenty-three entrants dwindle, friendships are forged and rivalries arise.  The contest acts as a personality magnifier; artifice fades as fatigue kicks in.  More than swollen joints and numb feet, time takes its toll on the minds of these resolute combatants.  Some become comatose while others fall into fits of hysterical laughter.

  I only watched the final episode of the first season of ""Survivor.""  I could see the appeal of the show: the personality conflicts and physical duress.  However, HANDS ON A HARDBODY condenses that intensity into a terrific, taut, 90-minute work of absurd human drama.",1149120000,,1883,4.97427652733119
1239198,5,B00000JYWY,"This quote from one of the featured contestants sums up this documentary.  I'm not one who often watches a film more than once.  However, I've seen this at least 4 times and have been fascinated each time.

For a person who enjoys documentaries, this is a great one.  The filmmaking is not as professional as some others, but that's probably part of the appeal.  Some of the personalities are definately amusing, just because they're such unique individuals and are without pretense.

By the time the contest and film are over, you almost feel as though you had been a participant and are ready for a long rest.",1142899200,,611,4.663551401869159
1239199,4,B00000JYWY,"Okay, I admit...I'm a sucker for documentaries. Give me a documentary anyday over what passes for 'reality' on television. I love the raw quality of docs and the emotion of the people in them. ""Hands on a Hard Body"" is a little gem of a movie. Sure it was cheaply made and many of the camera shots are rough, but the people in this little film are amazing! And hilarious. I certainly don't mean to poke fun at them because I think their honest-to-goodness need and desire to win a truck is so real and touching. I love how some of them trained for the contest (by eating ""energy"" food like oranges and 'snickie' bars) and the side stories that transpire throughout the film. It's funny, it's touching, it's a little bit sad, but I loved it. ""Hands on a Hard Body"" is reality! Check it out at your local video store. I think you'll be glad you did.",1109721600,,847,4.333333333333333
1239200,1,B00000JYWY,"it really embarrasses me to be from longview texas with all this crap on video. longview is an odd place to live, it's pretty miserable it's not really a small town feel or that of a city really. it's somewhere in between. any how all this car crazyness attracts attention to a place that really sucks basically. one of my friends fathers is featured on the video, that's pretty wierd honesty. longview is no spectacular place, i wouldn't even reccommend going there.",1067644800,,467,4.7073170731707314
1239201,4,B00000JYWY,"For most of this documentary, the question arises of just what does it take to win an endurance contest. Can a woman do it? A kid. An older guy? It is always in doubt as the trials and tribulations are shared through ongoing interviews. Whether you'd ever want to try something like this or just enjoy learning about those who do, this film creates a lot of insight amid the dreariness of sleepless nights and hot days and is a real lesson in life.",1049846400,,448,4.345238095238095
1239202,3,B00000JYWY,"This is a fun DVD to watch, but only because of the strangeness of the contest and the characters. The documentary itself is poorly filmed, and during several exciting moments -- including the VERY END OF THE CONTEST -- the cameramen are off doing something else, and then suddenly rushing off to catch the reaction shots, rather than the actual moment. I can't imagine why a camera wasn't left on a tripod and trained on the truck at all times, especially when there were only two participants left, to catch the final moments of the contest.
I would recommend that anyone who enjoys documentary film check this out of the public library, or rent it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a purchase.",1047513600,,706,4.701612903225806
1239203,3,B00000JYWY,"The story behind the movie is easily the most interesting part. But when it comes to cinematography, camera work, or even just shots, it is not that great to the common viewer, or any viewer for that matter. When it first started I was very surprised that it looked like a home movie that did not shake, thank goodness that it did not shake! But the plot behind it is interesting, being a touch a truck till you drop contest. Still, I can not get over the fact that the picture had much to be desired. However, I liked the strangeness of the competition so I, overall, liked the movie and hope that, camera work aside, you will like it for the contest itself.",1043539200,,659,4.32258064516129
1239204,5,B00000JYWY,"Mid-level production values, top-tier story. A very telling and moving look into a contest that legitmately opens up the human soul. Different people, different backgrouds, all with some individual desire. That the contest is over a pickup truck is humorous at first but ultimately irrelevant (however, I'm not sure I would have even watched it if it were about anything less absurd). Instead you have a half-dozen people who are entirely ordinarily and uniquely determined. Any viewer has to come out of this a little humbled at the winners and with a better sense of the real depth of all the strangers on the world.",1040428800,,618,4.895238095238096
1239205,5,B00000JYWY,"Most of the previous reviews describe HOAHB as a sort of a farce.  Though it certainly does have comic moments, some intended and others not, it is not a comedy.  It is easy for the typical documentary viewer (i.e. educated, middle class or better, often urban) to laugh AT the participants.  And sure enough, none of them would seem out of place in a ""Waiting for Guffman""-type mockumentary.  Those who approach it this way, however, miss the true richness of the video.
The goal of the directors, achieved brilliantly, was not to portray the participants as a bunch of wacko hicks and their pursuit of the truck as absurd.  What they want us to see and what the participants articulate so eloquently (often in spite of themselves) is the universality of the human experience.  These folks in Longview, TX, are willing to push themselves to the limits of physical and psychological tolerance for a chance to win a truck.  A brilliant medical student works grueling 100-hour weeks in pursuit of her ultimate goal.  What's the difference?  As the quote at the beginning of the video states, it's the journey and not the destination that is the true experience.
One of the most fascinating and moving parts of the documentary is when the participants explain what a new truck would mean to them.  Nobody is doing it just for the hell of it.  Whether the cause is material need, spiritual communion, or the ""thrill of victory and the agony of defeat,"" the truck is their Holy Grail and their quest to win it worthy of Greek myth.  Two previous contestants say that it was the best experience of their lives.  A powerful idea.
What would be this important to you?  It may not be the chance to win a truck, but all of us would be willing to push ourselves to the limit for something, someone, or some experience.  How far would you go?  How would you get there?  How would you be changed by the journey?  That's what this video is about.  The laughs are a bonus.",1028678400,,1957,4.587896253602305
1239206,5,B00000JYWY,"I was so surprised when I watched this movie. It has a great plot and the end is a real surprise. I believe that this film very much shows how good documentaries are made. Eventhough the filmmakers don't interfere so much in the film it is still interesting. Others film made in this style tend to be really boring.(""Startup.com"" and ""In the war room"") As a foreigner it is also very funny to see these American stereotypes in the competetion and I don't know how Americans feel about this movie but to me it is one of the great masterpieces in its genre.",1020556800,,555,4.398058252427185
1239207,5,B00000JYWY,"This is the funniest, most pathetic movie of all time. These people take this too seriously. But its full of laughs and white trash. Will watch it over and over again!!!!",1018483200,,170,4.516129032258065
1239208,5,B00000JYWY,"At first one might think that ""Hands on A Hardbody"" might be the title of an adult video to get you in the mood...but really it's the true life story of 23 contestants who are vying for the keys to an ordinary Nissan pickup.  The film starts with an experienced contestant and former winner, Benny, talking about what it takes to be a winner of this contest.  It moves on and gives a little background information on each contestant through interviews conducted prior to the event.  During the contest we see these people stand around this truck for hours and get insight into who these contestants really are. Among the most colorful contestants are Janice...a toothless woman(yes toothles...)with an air conditioner in her house that can cool the place down to 12 degrees below zero, Norma... a very religous lady with the special gift of laughter, and a fast slurring Karnack, Texas local who decides to feast off of Snickers and Oranges in order to maintain the strength that it takes to stay in the race.  Hours and hours of footage was shot and we see only 2 of around 90.  One can imagine what we didn't see. This film is truly a comedy,the people are real and these people have no idea how funny they really are.  You will be entertained all the way through as you root for your favorite. After watching the footage..you tune in again just to laugh and have a great time.  Produced by Matthew McConaughey, Longview native himself, this film makes you wonder how we must look to others...
Check it out... You'll be glad you did.",1010361600,,1535,4.6007326007326
1239209,4,B00000JYWY,"This is the first DVD I bought when I ordered my DVD player from Amazon.com. I love documentaries and ""mock""umentaries, and this one looked like a lot of fun. Plus, it's cheep.
First of all, I don't know much about this film or its makers, but it was shot in 4:3 aspect ratio, so the DVD edition wouldn't really look too much different than VHS.
Secondly, although you really get into the characters, and start rooting for your favorites, you lose out on that excitement the second time you view it. There's no surprise the second time around, and it's no fun to root.
This is impressive, though, as a low-budget look at the human being as a specimen. These people do some crazy things, especially after the second day or so. This contest brings out the worst in some, the best in others, and the rest just go crazy.
Try renting this before buying it.",992217600,,851,4.461538461538462
1239210,5,B00000JYWY,"OK, this movie was long, but three forths of it was the funniest documentary I have ever seen.  My house now sports a 20-ton Air Conditioner!",991008000,,141,4.423076923076923
1239211,5,B00000JYWY,"Just another radio giveaway.  That was what I thought when I began to watch this.  However, the human emotion and drama that unfolds as these contestants try and win a pickup truck is unbelievable not to mention hilarious.  ""Cars don't make money, Trucks make money.""  A must have for your collection.",986256000,,301,4.8431372549019605
1239212,2,B00000JYWY,"After reading about this DVD and that it was so funny i sat down to watch it.  I thought that it went on and on.  I mean the contestans are funny and all but I was completely bored.  Not only was it boring, it was lame.  It got old after 15 min.  It went on and on and 93 minutes later I felt as if I had taken a nap.  Don't get me wrong, I love watching funny stuff.  I just think this was not funny.  I wanted to inform everyone that it is not a 5-star DVD.  Definetely a watch once then it will collect dust.  Its your money spend it on a pillow instead.",977443200,,557,3.7241379310344827
1239213,5,B00000JYWY,"Since buying this dvd, I have showed it to as many peole as possible. You will roll on the floor laughing. Great to show at parties! For 12$, this is a must have!",975801600,,162,3.9393939393939394
1239214,3,B00000JYWY,"...I was hedging over 3 or 4 stars, but some of the overblown positives pushed me toward the 3 rating here.  Consider it a 3.5 perhaps.  Anyway, I enjoyed this quite a bit.  Sometimes plays like an Errol Morris film.  It was more interesting than hilarious, but satisfying overall.  Definitely a one-time film, as a previous reviewer pointed out, but a unique movie to lend to your friends.  It reminded me a bit of Survivor!, but I found that the TV show perhaps stole this idea (endurance just standing) for some of the ""tribal"" challenges.  Neither great nor bad, with a few twists here and there.",970012800,,600,4.60377358490566
1239215,3,B00000JYWY,"After reading all the comments from the people on Amazon.com, I bought the video, expecting to buy a gem that I'd like to watch over and over again.  I'm not sure what people found so funny, there were a couple vaguely  amusing parts, but the video as a whole wasn't all that funny.  What kept  my interest was finding out who was going to win.  Now that I know who won,  I'm not sure I want to watch it again.  I give it 3 stars, for being a  video that was an interesting one to watch once.  If it was one I'd watch  over and over again, I would give it more, but I don't think that's going  to happen.  At $12 for the DVD, it's not a bad deal though.",964483200,,653,3.900763358778626
1239216,1,B00000JYWY,"I had bought this documentary after reading the other reviewers comments about how good it is, but I could hardly drag myself through the whole hour and half of watching people standing and their philosophy on standing.
I  am not sure whether it is some kind of cultural divide between Texas and  Chicago or it is something that I did not understand. I and my friends  watched the movie together, and at the end of it we were depressed at  having lost one and half hours and mystified as to how any body could laugh  at it.",960768000,,523,4.350515463917525
1239217,5,B00000JYWY,"Although I can quote the entire documentary, words to describe this intense, comical, touching -- and most importantly real piece of cinematography escape me.  Each time I watch Hands on a Hardbody, I come  away with a better understanding of two classic struggles in nature - man  versus man and man versus himself.  Hands on a Hardbody is a journey that  explores complex human relations through humbleness - the humbleness of the  participants and of their desire to win a Nissan Hardbody Pickup.
Hands  on a Hardbody uses the ruse of comedy to display what one participant and  past winner adeptly describes as ""A human drama thing"".
I  strongly recommend this documentary.",954979200,,677,4.973214285714286
1239218,5,B00000JYWY,"This movie is a documentary that concerns an annual contest at the Nissan dealership in Longview, Texas as to who can remain standing the longest and win the harbody Nissan pickup. I've met folks from Longview Texas before  doing the Texas Chainring Challenge bike ride and thought they were some of  the finest people I had ever met. This movie confirms that impression. The  23 contestants really want (and many need) to win this truck. The movie  captures the hopes, dreams, needs, pain, and camaraderie in the contest.  (Also  winning strategies.) The suspense as to who will win lasts to the  end. The real stars are the contestants who are the ""salt of the  earth.""",953078400,,671,4.773913043478261
1239219,5,B00000JYWY,"You know how when you have heard how great something is, it never meets the expectation?
Hands on a Hard Body is a film that does it.  I had high expectations (the kind that are innevitably unreachable), when I saw it and  I came away with even more enthusiasm for the film.
It is a contest, so  for whom will you root?  You may be surprised by who wins...maybe  not.
Look forward to a cleverly directed mystery, a human struggle, a  character study, a drama of marginalized members of booming economy, and a  whitty comedy in which no one knows they are the humorist.
Oh, ya, and it  is OK to like it, even if you aren't from Texas, although you may feel some  guild for awhile.",948672000,,679,4.283464566929134
1239220,5,B00000JYWY,"Wow, at first you think you're going to laugh at these small town folks but that is not what happens. You will laugh as you find yourself emotionally invested in the real people whose stories quickly unfold. You  will wonder if you could make it to the end. The editing is great. The  movie is compelling throughout and very funny.",947721600,,331,4.5
1239221,5,B00000JYWY,"This is a riveting, funny, thoughtful, happy and clever documentary about some crazy people in Texas standing around waiting to take home a Nisson, Hard Body truck.  The idea seems crazy at first and the contestants more  than somewhat loopy, but I was quickly won over by the insiteful comments  and commitment of each of the participants in the contest, who have every  variety of reasons to put themselves through this insane mental and  physical test.  It makes for exciting TV",947203200,,481,4.8765432098765435
1239222,5,B00000JYWY,"I've seen this film at Dobie about 4 times now. I love taking someone to see it just to watch their reaction as the movie progresses. HOAHB presents a cross section of East Texas better than if you were to visit the region  in person. As a result of the film, the contest enters the Quirky Texas  Folklore category along with Ralph the Swimming Pig, Marvin Zindler, Hippie  Hollow, and Big Hair: not necessarily the most cerebral or refiined  institutions in Texas Culture -- but near and dear nonetheless. Hands on a  Hardbody is a classic for everyone and an absolute for Texans. If you're in  Austin, see it in Dobie Theatre for a more intimate and decorative  experience. Then, get it on DVD or Tape to watch again and to show your  friends!",945129600,,745,4.507462686567164
1239223,5,B00000JYWY,"Never in my life had I laughed as hard as I did when I first saw this movie.  I saw it at the Dobie Theatre in Austin, Texas, where it has been playing now for about  one and a half years.  The reason this movie is  still playing there is because it never gets old.  I love getting new  friends to watch this movie because they always love it as much as I do.  Everyone I've shown this movie to (about 20 people)has nearly died of  laughter.  Even when I was watching it by myself for the upteenth time I  swear that I laughed just as hard as I did the first time.  I am almost  sure that everyone will love this movie.  I am going to give this movie as  a gift to my friends in New England  and Oregon, because I feel that this  movie needs to get more noteriety and needs to spread everywhere.

And I am pretty sure that even those not blessed to be  from Texas will appreciate the humor.  If not, at least you will enjoy  sitting back and laughing at this great cast of real-life characters.

The last person to have their hands on the truck wins the truck.  There are several contestants who are ""characters""; one is bordering on not normal, depending on your point of view.  It is interesting to see some of the people who loose the contest when they forget that they are suppose to keep their hands on the truck.  The camera is right there when this happens.  One of those slip-ups is almost not caught but we, the viewers, see it.  You almost want to stand up and shout ""Look. Look. He let go!""  It is a most interesting contest.
