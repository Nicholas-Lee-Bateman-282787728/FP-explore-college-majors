2457511,4,B000CCZR7W,"Great train action.

Lots of logging with shays, and other engines.

Five disks with bonus features, I liked it so much I'm ordering another.

I gave my copy as a Christmas gift because Amazon was out.

Lots of late steam action.",1168387200,,229,4.512195121951219
2457512,5,B000CCZR7W,"A very nice selection of well done videos of the post WW 2 to Diesel Dominance era.  They came in a nice metal box, which had a embossed cover of a frontal view of a very European looking locomotive.  But my qualms about content vanished once I viewed the DVD's.  I recommend as a cost effective good look at a vanished era.",1168300800,,324,4.193548387096774
2457513,4,B000CCZR7W,"As I reconsider the reasonable price and great packaging, maybe I should rank this item higher - maybe 4.5? (but cant figure to how to change the star rating) Bought this 5 disc set for my toddler who is steam train crazed right now because I was tired of watching the one Railway Journeys show we had on Tivo over and over and over and over and over...

A few of the videos in this collection do look like they are the old VHS versions in quality (I was looking for the tracking option on my DVD remote for a minute!!!) but if you are a railfan or have a child who is nuts for trains like mine is right now, there IS a TON of wonderful chugging, puffing, billowing steam and smoke footage in this collection. And if you can get past the poor sound quality on parts of most of the discs you might even be able to hear what the narrator is saying a good part of the time and you'll be able to learn some historical steam train info too!

I would rate this collection higher for its overall content and reasonable price but the sound quality and some of the scratchy old video make me want to lower my rating. NOTE: MY child does not care one bit about any of the stuff I am finding fault with. This collection is by far his FAVORITE group of dvds to watch! Our many Wiggles and even (gasp!) Thomas the Tank Engine dvds are now gathering dust!!

DOH! and forgot to tell you about the great metal case the set comes in, and the enclosed booklet with images and info from the dvds! My child likes the metal box with the raised image of the Steam Train on it almost as much as he likes watching the dvds. I'm sure the box will eventually be a home for some of his toy cars or trains. And he asks for the ""book"" to take in the car to ""read"" on the way to daycare in the mornings!

Overall I am happy with this Amazon purchase - and free shipping was an added bonus that helped keep it reasonably priced.",1142208000,16,1897,4.105121293800539

2457546,4,B000CCZR7W,Very good disk and interesting. A little more detail on how it is operated would have made it 5 stars.,1398643200,,102,4.15
2457547,3,B000CCZR7W,I have all the clips that are shown on the dvds from another vendor but I like trains so I watched them again.,1382400000,,110,3.8260869565217392
2457548,3,B000CCZR7W,"I purchased this for myself - I not what you'd call a railroad enthusiast, I didn't have much more than a passing interest but my grandfather was a railroad man and as I'm getting older I find myself more and more interested in my family's heritage.  The price was right on this set and I saw it as a possible opportunity to learn more about what grandad's life on the railroad may have been like.  I've purchased a few other tin box sets by Madacy and they have been hit and miss so I was prepared for anything.  Wow, I was really surprised - the footage is really great, even the older footage from the 50's & 60's was very good quality.  Not DVD quality, but great considering when they were recorded.  These programs were obviously transferred from VHS - the narrator often refers the programs you are watching as a ""tape"".  A few reviewers have made mention of factual errors in the narration - I can't comment on that aspect, like I said I'm not an enthusiast so if there are errors in the information I wouldn't know it.  The programs cover a lot of ground, from early steam locomotives to more modern diesels.  But it's all entertaining and it's always a nice suprise when something exceeds your expectations.

EDIT: I have discovered a major flaw on disc #5.  On the first two programs on this disk, the audio often gets  out of synch and sometimes seems completely random.  On the third program the audio doesn't go with the video at all, I'd be watching footage of diesel locomotives and be hearing steam engines, and the narration doesn't describe what I'm watching.  It sounds like the audio is playing from a completely different program.  Anybody else notice this on disc 5 or did I just get a set with a bad disc?",1382054400,2,1729,4.482428115015974
2457549,5,B000CCZR7W,"Though I personally think this is a waste of DVD space, it was not purchased for me.  The DVD arrived in good condition, in a timely manner and packaged securely.  Thanks.",1381017600,,171,4.483870967741935
2457550,3,B000CCZR7W,I was a tad disappointed in this set. I thought it was going to be on some of the old fashioned trains traveling across the U.S. and Canada. It wasn't. It was about specific named trains and their use in its heyday. This collection is really for REAL train enthusiasts because of all the technical information.,1376524800,2,310,4.553571428571429
2457551,5,B000CCZR7W,"My father in law is an old retired railroad man, and this dvd set is the greatest gift he has ever received!  He is getting old enough that tv is a big part of his life, and this was hours of enjoyment for him!  Highly recommended!",1373155200,,231,4.0
2457552,3,B000CCZR7W,"good narration,  plenty of variety of steam trains. Much of this is old commercial films pr type for the rail companies, but still interesting for all rail fans.",1358467200,,161,4.75
2457553,3,B000CCZR7W,"Unfortunately this is mainly about restored locomotives for tourist lines.  I have nothing against that but I would prefer the old graining black and white films of working locomotives and not the restored tourist attractions.  Perhaps that's just me.  I was spoiled by ""When Giants Roamed"" and think all videos should be similar.",1358035200,,330,5.188679245283019
2457554,5,B000CCZR7W,"This is a xmas present for my husband, he does not have it yet, but anything that deals with Steam he will love, and he can watch it again and again, because it is a vanishing age",1356048000,,179,3.864864864864865
2457565,5,B000CCZR7W,This product is for rail fans & steam train enthusiasts alike. Watching the trains which were retired before I was born was a wonderful experience.,1353196800,,147,4.92
2457566,5,B000CCZR7W,"If you like long gone images of steam locomotives barreling down the track trailing a long plume of black smoke from its stack, you'll love this set of discs.  Plenty of steam and a lot of snow scenes.",1349740800,,201,4.2894736842105265
2457567,5,B000CCZR7W,"I am 62 and old enough to remember steam engines.  OMG, there is no machine ever created by man more wonderful than a steam locomotive.  I entitled this, Get Over It for those who find the sound not quite right, or the pictures not containing enough pixels or WHATEVER!  Let me tell you that this set of DVDs is phenomenal!!  I have never wanted to literally hug a machine, except for a steam locomotive.  What a terrific video showing these beautiful, elegant, giant, behemoths at their best.  Having once worked as a yard clerk for the Soo Line in Chicago, I can tell you I LOVE trains.  But NOTHING, but nothing, can compare to a Steam Locomotive.  Which is probably why I have my Lionel train set up all year long.  If you love steam engines, or just want the thrill of seeing them in their prime, BUY THIS VIDEO!!  It's the BEST!  When you get to the last DVD that premiers the GIANTS, including the Big Boy, hold on to your hat.  There is NOTHING like it!!  What an era!  Do not pass Go, Do not collect $200.00, BUY THIS DVD NOW!!",1318896000,15,1036,4.300518134715026
2457568,4,B000CCZR7W,Good video set.  Lots of live action moving trains through all sorts of terrain.  Both my 7 year old son and his grandfather loved watching it!,1265760000,,143,4.461538461538462
2457569,4,B000CCZR7W,"I recieved this as a gift from a friend who is a fellow railfan and I can safely say this is a very good collection of steam videos.  The videos cover unique areas of railroading and are fasinating to say the least. There was even some footage of an Streamlined A4 Pacific being moved dead in tow to the National Railroad Museum and of Flying Scotsman running in America on one of the discs.  It's a pity Pentrex doesn't do these type of deals where they provide the program and a third party puts it into a collection of discs for general release.

Despite the many good things there is one thing that prevents this from getting a 5 star review.  That is some of the problems I've had with the set, particularly the last DVD on the set. On the first set I got the audio got scrambled part way through the video.  My friend who also owns this set said the same thing happened to him as well.  On the replacement set the audio was working right but when played on a computer the chapter selections were acting funny.  Giving the video is from Green Frog productions and having prior knowledge of there DVDs I suspect this is just the way this last DVD was produced and not a problem of major concern if played on a conventional DVD player.  Don't get me wrong Green Frog Productions makes great railroad videos, It's just my experiences of them on computers isn't to great.  Overall it's a great buy for any one interested in Trains, I just recommend going to a store and getting it there and not on the internet. Just in case something goes wrong with it.",1260835200,,1555,4.352941176470588
2457570,5,B000CCZR7W,"I have to rate this 5 DVD set a FIVE. Now I know there are a lot of
""purists"" out there that point out the discrepancies they see and hear.
Although it's true that the narration has some errors in it, at least we know where we're at and what's going on.
  Concerning ""VHS"" quality video, please remember VHS didn't exist in
the '50s and '60s; this was movie film, likely 16mm, that was converted to
a new format suitable for watching on TV or computer. Watching the original film probably would not show a significant improvement since film technology at the time was not as good as subsequent years.
  That being said, I appreciate the fact that all the scenes were recorded for prosperity.
  There are many hours of enjoyment and nostalgia here, and at the price it's being sold for is an absolute ""best buy"" for railroad fans.
  The packaging is a wonder in itself! Relax and have a good time with these videos.",1245369600,2,914,4.463855421686747
2457571,5,B000CCZR7W,Great videos for the price. The series shows some good history and some great video of older steam engines. I would recommend this to any train enthusiast,1240617600,,154,4.7407407407407405
2457572,5,B000CCZR7W,"As an avid fan of Steam locomotives i was thrilled to watch the videos capturing all well known Steam locomotives including the Biggest and most powerful the Union Pacific ""Big Boy""
The Videos proceed with description narrated in the background and the original sound. There is enough time for one to hear he ""Chug, Puff"" of these steam giants, not to forget the Whistle!!!!

My son who is an infant simply loves these videos.

The 5th DVD covers a nice video on the Diesel Giants - Santa Fe.

A must buy for all steam Fans.",1232236800,3,524,4.494736842105263
2457573,5,B000CCZR7W,"This 5 DVD disc collection covers completely the age of Steam.  Rare footage of these grand iron horses before their demise to Diesel in the early 1950's.  Thank goodness we still have the TOURIST STEAM RAILROADS around America!!
