8364971,5,B002DB69L8,"Saw this documentary when it first aired many years ago and was happy to find a copy of it for sale here on Amazon. If you are from San Francisco and remember the way it was...or even if you aren't but want to know more about what it was like...this is a wonderful documentary with much great footage. And of course, narrated by (the now late) Dave McElhatton--a Bay Area broadcasting icon for decades. Brought back lots of great memories from childhood!",1410825600,,454,4.548780487804878
8364972,4,B002DB69L8,I loved the program so much I was willing to purchase it on VHS.  The video came damaged but was still playable.  I wish it was available in DVD format.,1374278400,,152,4.033333333333333
