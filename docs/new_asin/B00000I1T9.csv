1218754,3,B00000I1T9,"I first saw Derren's work in the late 1970s in Iowa City, in a course on experimental film which placed her at the forefront of the trance film.  Wow, talk about mind-bending.  I have to say I never had much time for ""Meshes"".  ""At Land"" I enjoyed deeply; it seemed less pretentious and more dreamy and more fun.  The most amazing of all was ""Ritual in Transfigured Time"".  Moving, dreamy, evocative, mythic, all those words apply to the intense, introspective 15 minutes of splendor.  More then twenty years after last seeing Derren's work, I came across this VHS and immediatly ordered it.  Some of the later stuff, like ""Meditation"" and ""The Very Eye of Night"", yeah, I can live without that and will unlikely ever feel the need to see it again.  But to have ""Ritual"" close at hand is a supreme satisfaction.  Derren used to say that she could shoot a whole film for what a Hollywood movie budgeted for lipstick.  It's a classic statement that resources are seldom the issue in films, imagination is.

I was thrilled to find this tape, and ecstatic to watch it again.  Alan Williams, wherever you are, thanks for turning me on to Maya Derren.

Three starts instead of five because ""Study in Choreography"", ""Meditation"", and ""Very Eye"" seem like total filler to me.",1138492800,,1267,4.678733031674208

If I were to have seen these films w/o the dates at the beginning, I would have never in a million years believed these films were made in the early to late 1940s.  I truly could believe these films were made in Seattle this year.  This lady is a great artist whose films need to be seen by a large audience today.  I want to see her films on the big screen.  There is hope as long as we have Indy theaters.",1135555200,25,504,3.9019607843137254

1218757,5,B00000I1T9,"I viewed ""Meshes of the Afternoon"" in my Women & Film Studies class and was completely in awe. Maya Deren is a beautiful and remarkably talented woman, and I was surprised to have not heard of her earlier. I enjoyed every piece on this video immensely and would recommend it to anyone.",1127347200,4,285,4.5
1218758,2,B00000I1T9,"A qualification: Meshes of the Afternoon is very good, and is worth watching many times.  The plot is fascinating and lends itself to endless interpretation; the choice of shots is beautiful and image after image stays in the memory, which is all Deren said she wanted people to take away from her movies.
But the rest of it, my god!  What pretentious nonsense!  People dancing around for five minutes, or floating against backgrounds of stars - it's like something a conspicuously untalented film student would produce.  There aren't even any images that have any force (although we've already lowered the potential power of cinema to the lowest possible bar) - for the most part, I just found them incredibly monotonous.  Once those white ghostly people started floating around the background of stars, they pretty much keep doing it - same thing with that dancing guy; he keeps dancing.
I have no idea about her Haitian movie: maybe it's good.  The other movies on this tape actually reduced my opinion of Meshes of the Afternoon.  Maybe it was a deliberate attempt at mystification that I had read far too much into.  Someone else wrote something about how Deren fuses the aesthetic of Cocteau and Eisenstein: that's great, but these movies are bad!  And those guys made good movies, that I enjoy watching.  Deren can just go on fusing as many aesthetics as she'd like.
Only get this if you enjoy being confused and bored, or associate those qualities with works of art.  Which, you know, it seems that many people do.
(The Changing Light at Sandover is great, by the way: go out and read that if you feel the need to be acquainted with Deren in some way.)",1068681600,6,1660,4.729166666666667
1218759,5,B00000I1T9,"Maya Deren is, in many ways, the original American avant-garde filmmaker.  Years--even decades--before many other filmmakers, Deren was engaging in a variety of experimental film projects.  While these have never been widely seen and are not widely known, her work provided a model for a host of filmmakers seeking influences outside the Hollywood and European mainstream.  To be honest, these are not, by today's standards, especially enjoyable films.  Working with rather primitive equipment, with a rather low level of technical expertise, these films are more remarkable for their impressionistic, dreamlike, surreal subject matter.  They are pieces that you respect and admire rather than love.  Their greatest importance lies in their documenting the work of a true film pioneer.  None of them have any plot to speak of, but function instead around movement or archetypal imagery.  Much of Deren's significance lies in her suggesting alternatives to the narrative format prevalent in the larger filmworld.
I personally find Ms. Deren to be a remarkable beauty.  It was not a beauty in vogue when she first started working in the forties, with her East European looks, exceedingly full lips, her wild and curly hair, and sometimes eerie gaze.  As a personality, she crops up continually in literary and cultural reminiscences from the forties and fifties.  She will pop up memorably in sections of Anais Nin's diary (or ""liary"" as many of those who appear in them will say).  A memoir of a Greenwich Village party will mention her being in attendance.  In her friend James Merrill's great THE CHANGING LIGHT AT ANDOVER, arguably the greatest long American poem after Williams's PATERSON, she is one of the persons Merrill tries to contact in the afterlife (her photo appears in the cast of characters in the inside covers).  Deren may not be a household name, but she was well known to many people who were.  She was a vital part of the hidden life of the American avant-garde.
My hope is that some company, preferably Criterion, will do a two DVD set of Deren's work, along the lines of their Stan Brakhage set (Deren's spiritual heir).  The discs could contain both a fairly thorough collection of her highly influential short works, and her feature length documentary THE DIVINE HORSEMEN.  I don't know that anyone will ever think of doing such a set, but if they do, it will be an essential item for anyone interested in American film or the American avant-garde.",1067472000,7,2472,5.034398034398034
1218760,5,B00000I1T9,"Here she is... The woman who achieved so much in just a few pieces of celluloid. She fused, may be unknowingly, the aesthetics of Jean Cocteau and Sergei Eisenstein. She combined freudian lyricism with the specifics of  the cinema. Her slow motions, her bold ellipses, her extension of time are  wonderful. She is not only the mother of the Cinematographic Fantastic, she  is the Mother of the trance film. Among the directors who pillaged,  imitated or borrowed from her shorts like Meshes of the afternoon, At land  and Ritual in transfigured time, you will find Dario Argento, Clive Barker  (his shorts),David Lynch, Bernar H&eacute;bert, Elias Mehrige as well as Shinya  Tsukamoto,Alexandro Jodorowsky, Paul Verhoeven (see the Hollow Man trailer,  you'll get it when you see Meshes!)and a hundred of rock video directors.  Even today, her work hasn't lost an iota of the wonderful aura that  surrounds them. Her movies, especially the three aforementionned, are out  of time, out of place. When will they get the DVD treatment is the question  of the moment. Along with Stan Brakhage, Kenneth Anger and James Broughton,  Maya Deren is the most influential experimental filmmaker to have ever  walked this earth. Unfortunately, she did not walk it for long as she died  an untimely death. May she rest in peace knowing we will forever cherish  her work",962755200,22,1355,5.036036036036036
1218761,5,B00000I1T9,"I first encountered Maya's films in 1972 during Foundation Course in Art and Design. I immediately fell in love with this dark haired, beautiful and enigmatic woman who has an amazing eye when composing her shots. The films are bizarre and in monochrome but I feel they may have lost something had she used colour.

Although I particularly like the films featuring her wandering across strange landscapes, as a martial artist I was captivated by that of the father of her second husband doing Tai Chi at fighting speed especially when he started swinging a short sword around himself.

BTW, the reason for the title is that she died in 1961 at the relatively young age of 44, eleven years before I became aware of her. A bitter disappointment for someone who once had dreams of making films with her until life, family and a mortgage eventually intruded several years later.

If you have any interest in experimental and underground films this disk should take pride of place in your collection. Highly recommended by Bill ""Sock Puppet"" Fox.",1356220800,,1041,4.837078651685394
1218762,4,B00000I1T9,"I first encountered references to Maya Deren in a book about women Surrealist artists, and she certainly fits that category, among others. Her three short Surrealist films, ""Meshes of the Afternoon,"" ""At Land,"" and ""Ritual in Transfigured Time,"" are my favorites in this collection of her work. Wonderfully dreamlike meditations on divisions in personal identity and transformation, they star the exotically beautiful Deren herself, often in multiple copies, as well as (especially in ""Ritual"") other women styled to resemble her, one of whom (I learned from the notes accompanying the films) was the famous writer Anais Nin. The films are full of haunting images, such as a black-cloaked figure with a mirror where its face should be (""Meshes"") and a woman laboriously pulling herself up the length of an immense dinner table while the chattering diners completely ignore her (""At Land"").

Most of the remaining films show dances, augmented by filmic techniques such as slow motion, which makes the dancer seem to float through the air. This emphasis on dance is not surprising, since Deren herself danced for a while with Katherine Dunham's troupe and remained interested in dance and its potential interaction with film all her life. For me these films were less moving than the Surrealist ones, but I imagine that students of modern dance, and of the filming of dance, will find them very rewarding.

The collection also includes a ten-minute segment from a one-hour film made (by Deren's third husband and his second wife) out of the extensive footage that Deren took during her visits to Haiti to study voudun (""voodoo""). The full film is available on a separate disc (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Divine-Horsemen-The-Living-Gods-of-Haiti/dp/B006QSU46K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Divine Horsemen - The Living Gods of Haiti</a>). Although not trained as an anthropologist, Deren approached this belief system with deep and respectful interest; she was perhaps the first to treat it seriously, rather than as merely a staple of horror movie schlock. (See her book on this subject,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Divine-Horsemen-The-Living-Gods-of-Haiti/dp/0914232630/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti</a>, which has an introduction by famed Jungian mythologist Joseph Campbell.)

A final treat for those of us who, like Deren, love cats is a 15-minute film called ""Private Life of a Cat."" It shows (in considerable detail) the birth of a litter of kittens and their mother raising them to the point where they can walk and climb on their own, with benevolent-looking supervision from their father. This film, hidden among the ""extras"" on the disc, was made by Deren's first husband and filmic collaborator, Alexander Hammid.

This collection contains a few biographical notes about Deren, but they are skimpy.

1218764,5,B00000I1T9,I first saw her work as a teenager and have been entranced with her work ever since. The quality of the selections is excellent and it's a good introduction not only to her work but also to American avant-garde cinema in the 1940s.,1294012800,,231,4.395348837209302
1218765,5,B00000I1T9,"Maya Deren's At Land (1944) opens with a scene of fearsome waves crashing against a desolate shore.  It could almost be described as Debussian, save for the unsettling dead and total silence that continues, unabated, throughout the film.

The exotic Deren appears, emerging from a sleep, like a mermaid spit ashore from the crashing waves.

Deren begins slowly climbing a massive, twisted, dead tree trunk; the figure of Deren/Eros embarking on her great existential journey.

The nymph (her face adorned with child-like innocence) slithers on her stomach across a dining room table, populated with faceless corporates.  They do not take notice of her, preoccupied with idle chatter and many cigarettes.  Her eyes focus on a solitary figure, playing chess at the table's end.  By the time she reaches that end (there are brief, repeated, struggled, exploratory diversions through a mass of shrubbery) she finds the player has just left and, as she gazes at the board, the rest of the room's occupants are also leaving.

Telekinetically, she moves the chess pieces, until the pawn (one of eight) falls through a hole in the table.  She attempts to retrieve it and finds herself  back on the shore, then on a country road, walking and talking with a young man (represented by five different men).

She cannot keep up with the man and he leaves her behind as he disappears into a cabin, shutting the foreboding door behind him.

Determined not to be abandoned, she crawls under the log cabin but emerges in a contemporary, nearly abandoned home, laden with furniture, covered in white sheets.

It is not the young man she finds, but an older, bedridden man (figure number six), under a white bed sheet.  They silently stare at each other, identify with one another, for a sustained moment.  She walks on down the hall, opens a door, but does not go through.

She goes through another door to emerge at a rocky descent which takes her back to the seashore.

She gathers white stones, too many to hold. She drops many of the stones, collapsing in her attempt.

She comes upon two women (figures seven and eight).  The imagery of a chess game is repeated between the two strangers as Deren intensely observes: the perennial, almost animalistic outsider.

With her eyes, Deren seems to hold the two women in contempt as she plots.  She mesmerizes and distracts them as she caresses their hair, evoking arousal.

A second Deren appears, seizes the opportune moment and snatches a white pawn from the board and runs off, like a curious, frightened, mischievous faun.

A third Deren again collects white stones on the beach and observes her second, mirrored image running with the chess piece.

The first Deren also observes, with her two lovers.  Maya runs away.  Snippets of reversal images; the tree trunk, the rocks, the contemporary home with white sheet covered furniture, all flash before her.  She flees this odyssey; a state of bewilderment and confusion, towards her only true sanctuary; along the seashore and the sea that birthed her.

The late Stan Brakhage, a devotee of Maya Deren, speculated that her first and most famous film, Meshes of the Afternoon, was more the work of her then husband and collaborator, Alexander Hamid.  This assertion really does not hold up to scrutiny.  In composition, Meshes may indeed be more Hamid than Deren, but conceptually the film is pure Deren.  At Land and Ritual in Transfigured Time continue Deren's conceptual themes, while Hamid's body of work reveal an artist who dabbled in experimental film, but was more comfortable in documentary.

While Meshes of the Afternoon may be a somewhat more innovative film, and deserves every bit of its well-won acclaim, At Land remains Deren's most personal film and, for such an enigmatic figure, that is an essential and rewarding experience.

Deren would physically disappear from her work following Ritual (which also featured the legendary Anas Nin), and that was a mistake.

While the later films certainly contain Deren's preoccupations--rhythm, space, the Riefenstahl-like figures, and the dream effeminate--the physical loss of Deren's mysterious and magnetic on-screen personality renders the remaining films as being interesting only in the after-light of these first three films, for the shared elements, but not as entities within themselves.

Still, there belongs, along with Buuel and Cocteau, a third and possibly most compelling figure in early experimental film: the inimitable Maya Deren.

1218766,3,B00000I1T9,"These pieces seem to strip movie-making down to its bare bones. The longest clocks at 15 minutes, one lasts just four. As in short-story writing, the central idea has to become clear quickly. They're all black and white. Perhaps economics forced that on her (these pieces all come from the 1940s and 1950s), but it also eliminates the complexities of the color dimensions. Some of the pieces have accompanying music, others play out in silence, but none feature spoken words. In all, the result compresses the viewer's attention into a purely visual experience.

The first of these pieces, ""Meshes of the Afternoon,"" has the most narrative quality. Surreal characters move across a limited setting, in stylized and repetitive ways - under the gaze of that cloaked, faceless character. Later pieces, especially ""The Very Eye of Night,"" become choreographic abstractions.

It's interesting to see the origins of later experimental movie-making, and to see imagery that might have been echoed in other art films of the day. Deren's use of optical effects, although somewhat grainy and jittery, also prefigures techniques that became main-stream by the 1970s. I've never had much response to choreography, though, and most of these pieces center closely around idioms of dance. As a result, not much really grabbed my attention. I found it useful to see the development of film-making as a nearly abstract art, but I probably won't come back to this collection.

1218767,5,B00000I1T9,"I think it was Stan Brakhage who once explained the importance of Maya Deren to the development of underground film culture by saying, ""She is the mother of us all."" This DVD collects the short films that prove Brakhage right. All of them are in black and white; most of them are about 15 minutes long (the one exception is even shorter than that); and all are silent, though some have musical accompaniment.

""Meshes of the Afternoon"" (1943), made in collaboration with her then-husband, Hollywood cameraman Alexander Hamid, is the foundation of American experimental cinema. It tells a dream-like story that loops back on itself with variations, telling a dream-like story of a woman (Deren) following a strange, cloaked figure with a mirror for a face. It is an endlessly fascinating film made all the more intense by its brevity. Along with Kenneth Anger's ""Fireworks"", it is the finest distillation of dream into film that I have seen.

""At Land"" (1944) begins with a woman (Deren again) being washed up on the shore by the ocean and climbing up into a series of curious adventures. A good early example of the ""trance"" film.

""A Study in Choreography for Camera"" (1945) is only four minutes long and doesn't really tell a story; it's more a brief experiment in the cinematography and editing of dance footage, with an innovative opening in which the camera rotates in place and manages to pass the same figure four times before completing the circle.

""Ritual in Transfigured Time"" (1946) is arguably Deren's greatest film. Three women (Deren, writer Anais Nin, and dancer Rita Christiani) play archetypal roles in the the transformation of ""widow into bride"" (as Deren explained it).

""Meditation on Violence"" (1948) is an extended study of ritual motion in which a master of Chinese martial arts demonstrates Wu Tang and Shao Lin forms. It is surprisingly difficult to tell that the last four minutes of the film are played backwards!

""The Very Eye of Night"" (1958) is a curious piece in which dancers, filmed in negative, perform against a starry background. Some critics dismiss this film, but it is really quite absorbing, in a meditative sort of way, if you are willing to slow down and accept it as it is rather than demanding a ""story.""

The DVD also includes Alexander Hamid's charming documentary ""The Secret Life of a Cat"" (1945), which shows the birth and raising of a new litter of kittens in the Deren/Hamid household.",1204675200,56,2439,4.891041162227603
1218768,5,B00000I1T9,"It gives you exactly extra ordinary visual experiences.  Or, let me say it is exactly an invention of what movie is and how film should be.  If you do like watching motion pictures, then you must see this.  I mean it !",1193356800,5,218,4.142857142857143
1218769,5,B00000I1T9,"In my opinion,Maya Deren ranks right up there with Hildegard von Bingen as one of the most prolific female artists in the history of mankind. Her films are amazing because they have so many ""faces"" to them. They are at-once femininely strong,femininely beautiful,and have a delicate flow. She should not simply be remembered as a ""woman artist"" however;her directorial and editing work are among the best in all of cinematic history--men or women. This dvd may not present her material in a Criterion Collection-quality manner,but the material alone is worth the purchase.",1188518400,7,572,5.228260869565218
1218770,4,B00000I1T9,"""Maya Deren: Experimental Films"" includes all 6 complete films by Maya Deren, the chief proponent and practitioner of experimental or avant-garde film in the United States in the 1940s-1950s. The films are almost in chronological order, beginning with Deren's most recognizable and influential film, the haunting ""Meshes of the Afternoon"" (14 min), filmed by her second husband Alexander Hammid in Hollywood in 1943. The film was originally silent, but this version includes music by Deren's third husband Teiji Ito that was added in 1957. ""Meshes of the Afternoon"" succeeds admirably in reproducing ""the way in which the subconscious will develop, interpret, and elaborate an incident"", as Deren claimed. What amazes me is how this discontinuous, repetitive film manages to build suspense and create intrigue in addition to its striking visuals and provocative themes, making it the most accessible and enduring of Deren's films.

""At Land"" (15 min, silent, 1944) again places Deren in the central role and uses duplication of her character to convey self-perception. ""A Study in Choreography for Camera"" (2 min, silent, 1943) features ballet dancer Talley Beatty performing continuously as the camera jumps between different environments discontinuously. ""Ritual in Transfigured Time"" (15 min, silent, 1945-6) is another self-expression but with Rita Christiani and Anais Nin in major roles, Deren appearing at the beginning and end. ""Meditation on Violence"" (12 min, 1948) films Chao Li Chi performing traditional movements from Wu-Tang Chinese boxing, accompanied by flute and drums. The peaceful and violent aspects of the martial art are represented as Chao begins with no accoutrements against a white background then moves outdoors in ceremonial dress with a sword. The film reverses itself and plays backward as we go back to the spare environment, where the movements are equally graceful in reverse.

""The Very Eye of Night"" (15 min, 1952-9) was made with the collaboration of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, whose dancers are depicted in negative (white on black) and superimposed on a background of black sky with shining white stars. Music is by Teiji Ito. This is the least accessible of Deren's films. There is a progression of events and characters, I suppose, but I don't find it coherent. In any case, it didn't keep my attention and therefore seemed more of a visual experiment than a thematic one.  With each film, you have the option to read ""Notes & Quotes"", which are statements by Maya Deren about her films and a few excerpts of critical analysis from other sources. You can read them before or after viewing the films, as ""spoilers"" are not an issue in these non-narrative films. Maya Deren's films vary in quality, but I was struck by how modern all of them seem.

The DVD (Mystic Fire Video 2002): The films are watchable but have not been restored, so there are lines, spots, and grain. The sound isn't clean either for ""Meditation on Violence"". Bonus features are: ""Private Life of a Cat"" (22 min, silent, 1945) filmed by Alexander Hammid in their Greenwich Village apartment, follows their cat G.G. giving birth and the first 4 weeks of the kittens' lives. ""Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti"" (8 min) is an excerpt from the longer film which is available on a separate disc. Maya Deren shot 10 hours of film footage while studying Voudoun religion in Haiti 1947-51. This was later edited into a film by Teiji Ito and wife Cherel, with accompanying narration taken from Deren's scholarly book of the same name. This film is in a more traditional documentary style than Deren would probably have done herself. There is also a brief text Biography of Deren, a Bibliography of her books and films, and Writings About Maya Deren, which include Anais Nin describing how they met and Le Corbusier (Charles-Edouard Jeanneret) commenting on her work.",1185840000,6,3887,5.126182965299685

7909372,3,B00000I1T9,"... but, this Mystic Fire Video release, at least as of 2013-4, is in the format of DVD-R, not DVD. If it has to be done this way, at least, I think, this piece of information should be made clear at this site.(*1) The video and audio quality also leaves a lot to be desired.

Maya Deren is arguably one of the most important and innovative avant-garde filmmakers in the history of (American) cinema. These films are (generally regarded) masterpieces and important pioneering works of American experimental films.  Meshes of the Afternoon, made in 1943 with Alexander Hammid, in particular stands as a seminal avant-garde film and reaches a status comparable to Un Chien Andalou in some quarters. Indeed, the influence of Luis Buuel and Salvador Dal is there. An excellent reference is John Rhode's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meshes-of-the-Afternoon-Bfi-Film-Classics/dp/184457377X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meshes of the Afternoon (Bfi Film Classics)</a>.

Certainly I do not expect the ""Criterion treatment"" of a Deren DVD, which is probably not financially feasible anyway. However, I do wish there are some commentaries from noted Deren experts, which usually doesn't cost a great deal and the added value is likely the best way to fight off the online free videos at youtube. Also, some minimal cleanup of the video and audio would have been nice. The video and audio quality leaves plenty room for improvement. There is also one minor slip-up: the running time for the third film ""A Study in Choreography for Camera"" is only 2:13, but is labeled ""4 min"" on the back cover. All these indicates that Mystic Fire Video probably did not take this release seriously enough.

At the end, I am still grateful for the release of these Deren films in home video format, but just wish it was done properly. A good example is the Italian release of Andy Warhol's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chelsea-Girls/dp/B0047WU3EK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chelsea Girls</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Here/dp/B000PSS0H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Here</a>).(*2) Still, I'd recommend anyone who is interested in Deren films, or avant-garde films of 40-50's, to buy this DVD, even though the majority of them are available online. If nothing else, hopefully it will support releases of more DVDs of its kind. (Therefore, I am keeping my copy.)

How about a Maya Deren complete film collection, Criterion Collection or Masters of Cinema? It's only a little more than 4 hours, and can be easily accommodated in 2 Blu-Ray discs.

(*1) In other words, it's all right to sell us DVD-R's. Just let us know what we are getting. (I bought some Warner on-demand DVD-R production gladly, for example.)
(*2) The Italian release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chelsea-Girls/dp/B0047WU3EK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chelsea Girls</a>&nbsp;has no region code, but is encoded in the PAL format. Any good DVD/BD players of newer generations should have no problem playing it.

7909373,4,B00000I1T9,"I heard a film maker once call Maya Deren the fairy godmother of experimental film.  While limited to the technology of her time, and less concerned with the juxtaposition of flat images as with Man Ray, but the exploration of the human form in gender, movement, juxtaposed against a world of images and, at times, and underlying narrative or critical argument.  She is perhaps the most underrated director in terms of her brilliance, both in her dancing, writings, direction, and cinematography.  She was truly of a generation that brought their training from a dozen different fields into their work.

""Meshes in the Afternoon"" is her most surrealistic, experimental, and well known endeavor.  No further insight could be garnered here than in any other thorough criticism.  Her amazing skills, both with the subject in front of the camera and her editing abilities, are most on display in ""A Study in Choreography for Camera"", which also best displays her training as a dancer and choreographer.  ""Ritual in Transfigured Time"" gives us an experiment of motion; the magic of the everyday when shown in a world of madness.  Of all the women's studies done in her work, ""At Land"" gives the most focus, lending herself as subject in a world of the total unknown.

The film that catches me the most as the least recognized for its importance in cinema history is ""Meditation on Violence"".  A precursor to films such as ""36 Chambers of Shaolin"", this short film is one of the first instances of martial arts in western films.  It not stays true to the forms which the movements are based, but done in such a way as to explore the place of a warrior at different times in their life; the struggle to attain, the glory of combat, and the struggles which result when their is no one left to fight.

The only thing that doesn't make this a perfect buy is the availability of many of these films online.  They are not impossible to find, cash and virus free.  The overall quality of the transfer's isn't pristine, but at least there won't be connection issues glitching your view.  Further, the extra features are worth a look.  Be warned: there is a chance of falling in love with this woman, and wishing to discover every possible thought or image she ever recorded.",1391731200,3,2260,4.741687979539642
7909374,5,B00000I1T9,You will enjoy her collaborative films with her husband as well as her later films.  The extras including the Voodoo Ritual one is very interesting as well.  The Private Life of a Cat is adorable.  Meshes of the Afternoon is a dreamlike and suspenseful film.  It is a must see for those interested in experimental films.,1384560000,,320,4.660714285714286
7909375,3,B00000I1T9,"This is a collection of short experimental films in black and white.  If this had been a magazine it would have been a photographer's magazine and these could easily have been artsy type stills.

The experiments are from time passed.  However even today they are powerful images.  You will see these images or images like these in many artistic films of the time.

Even though this is worth watching for historic and arts value there are not a lot of places for it in today's world.  However like a coffee table book Maya Deren can be a great conversation piece when you view other films of that era.

7909377,5,B00000I1T9,"Recommend to anyone interested in history of film and in the direction of the American cinema that is almost orthogonal to the mainstream Hollywood production.  Maya Deren's work shows that for a film to be experimental does not mean to be formalistic.  She portrays the inner life of human and female soul at a very deep level.  Just do not expect traditional storytelling: this work is more akin to poetry or music, and is moving and very beautiful.",1364774400,,451,4.756410256410256
