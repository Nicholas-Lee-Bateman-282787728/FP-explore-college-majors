8382659,3,B0015N2L26,"I do enjoy the series overall and I realize Galway is not a metropolis. Hence, the connections between characters is mostly understandable. However, the writers take these connections a little too far a little too often because Galway is not that small.

One of the most unbelievable overshoots the series insists on going with are when Taylor ALWAYS seems to bed some hot woman. Really? I get the occasional, random tryst, but as often as it happens on this series it's getting ridiculous. Taylor's character is neither good looking, nor charming, much less offering financial prospects - he's a washed-up alcoholic who looks like he hasn't washed in weeks and I don't recall him ever shaving. ...so what is it that the ladies are swooning over when his cigarette-breathed gruff arrogance leans in nice and close for some smarta__ comment?

And the sheer weight of haggard circumstances Jack is embroiled in would have landed him in prison LONG ago. Yet he always has his hot female garda/police connection to tip him off to whatever is headed his way. Sorry, but they go to that well a couple dozen times too often.",1502236800,2,1117,4.842931937172775
