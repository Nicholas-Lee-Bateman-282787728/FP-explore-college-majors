8450683,5,B00505E574,This is a historical look at stones and their relevance through the ages. This dvd was surprisingly good and is packed wall to wall with solid info. I read about this in a blog and decided to give it a shot. Glad I did.,1368835200,,219,4.0
8450684,1,B00505E574,"I don't how the 5 star reviewer, Benjamin, found this compelling. It was boring. I got 12 minutes in and was hoping for something interesting. At 25 minutes I was thinking it was a waste of money but determined to watch the whole thing, I was relieved to find it finished earlier than the 70 minutes promised. Philip Gardiner is an amateur documentary maker and this is shown in the incredibly poor cinematography. His use of special effects is distracting and rather like a child with a new toy. The camera work and lighting is also poor and the sound is hollow and echoes. That combined with the fact that the droning background music is too loud makes it difficult to hear without the volume high. Given that the volume levels are inconsistent, you're constantly adjusting the volume. Furthermore it contains at least 15 minutes of extracts from his other film The Stone which were totally irrelevant and seemed to be a time filler. I suppose some of this could be forgiven if it delivered the promise on the back of the cover: ""In this unique film we uncover the secrets of the stones with a group of experts..."" - but it didn't. The so called experts hardly offered anything that hasn't been said better before by someone of note. No 'secrets' were uncovered at all and typically the phrase ""and this requires further research"" came up again and again. No conclusions were drawn and some of the most important aspects to `secrets' of stones is the male / female differentiation (volcanic or sedimentary), the high crystalline content of most stones used at ancient sacred sites. This combined with the fact that most sacred sites have an underground water source, magnifies the telluric forces channelled through the site. In short, this film offers nothing of merit and rather than keeping me awake, it put me to sleep. Don't waste your money on any of Philip Gardiner's movies (haven't read any of his books).",1367366400,,1916,4.756756756756757
8450685,1,B00505E574,"It's story is basic about the historic significance of stones, rather boring. It strobes light a lot which gives me a headache. I own it, but will not bother watching it again.",1362700800,,176,4.53125
8450686,5,B00505E574,Well put together doc! I got this earlier this year and finally got around to writing a review. I watched this on a flight to Europe and it helped me stay awake! Very compelling.,1354492800,,178,4.264705882352941
8450687,4,B00505E574,"This is a decent overview on the subject of stone worship and the societies that embraced it.  It calls on many experts in the field, and they are all interesting and entertaining people.  It is a good solid introduction.",1353456000,,221,4.641025641025641
8450688,3,B00505E574,For tens of thousands of years humans have worshiped stones in various ways. They've carved stone and prayed to stone and built empires with it. In Secret Societies and Sacred Stones we're given detailed information through interviews with experts and many photos and footage. Why did people of the past covet certain stones and what did they feel they could achieve by harnessing its power? Some felt stones could steal your soul while others believed they could protect against evil. Fascinating stuff! I suggest watching this DVD then the director's movie The Stone since it will make even more sense and be that much scarier!,1314489600,,629,5.0
8450689,3,B00505E574,"A fascination with the magical power of certain kinds of stones has been a feature of religion throughout the ages.  Power and geology go hand in hand--stones are believed to be able to steal the power of people's souls, and also protect against evil. It's not surprising then that secret groups coveted stones, hoping to tap into that power.  Using interviews with several experts, the film introduces us to how these societies worked with these elements. Cabalists, alchemists and meteorites are the main emphasis.  If the subject interests you, this is a good introduction to experts Ahmed Osman, Robert Feather, Nick Pope, Patrice Chaplin and others, but you're not going to get too much depth in this short amount of time.  Extensive footage from The Stone: No Soul Unturned, by the same director, is nicely used to illustrate.  In fact, this documentary is a good companion piece to that fictional film--the theological underpinnings for the scary stuff.  And in case you miss that point, afterwards is an extensive series of entertaining trailers and music videos for The Stone movie itself.",1314144000,,1098,5.072222222222222
