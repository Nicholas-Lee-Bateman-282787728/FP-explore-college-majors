8126779,5,B000FUF7GW,I am huge fan of snowboard movies in general and this one was a great choice for release on the PSP. Travis Rice is amazing and they do a great job of transitioning from one segment to the next. I liked the Alaska segment the best.,1155600000,,231,4.043478260869565
8126780,4,B000FUF7GW,"i really love the way this umd video is designed so i can watch the video in 3 minute segments(5 minute, whatever I want)or the whole thing.  Other than this company, i have never seen a menu designed like this and i am telling you, absolutely, it is perfect for the psp--it looks like someone actually gave this some thought and designed it specifically for the PSP --",1154995200,,369,4.426470588235294
8126781,4,B000FUF7GW,"What a weird snowboarding film.  I could hardly recognize any of the music at all except for two or 3 songs, but I think I liked all of it. Especially the cool beats that go with the Aspen Pipe segment.  I probably watched that part 2 or 3 times in a row.  After watching this movie I think Travis Rice might actually be a better snowboarder than Shaun White.  This is not you r average snowboard film, and I suggest checking it out if you are looking for something a little different to watch on your PSP.",1154995200,,506,4.185567010309279
8126782,5,B000FUF7GW,"For all of you extreme winter athletes, an absolute must for any collection.  The snowboarding coverage with Travis Rice and Shaun White (Flying Tomato) are sweet.",1154995200,2,163,5.269230769230769
8126783,5,B000FUF7GW,This umd has gotten me totally pumped up for the upcoming snowboard season--totally wicked,1154995200,3,90,5.5
8126784,5,B000FUF7GW,"I am actually a skier, not a snowboarder but I thought this movie was great.  It is not your typical snowboard film with lots of punk and hip hop music playing over quick edits of guys jumping cliffs and hitting rails.  The entire Japan segment is amazing and looks so cool on my PSP, especially the segment when they are jumping off a house in front of a closed down amusement park.  The Aspen Park segment with Shaun White is also amazing.  Travis Rice and Shaun white sort of battle back and forth on one of the coolest terrain parks ever built.  The soundtrack and music quality are also great.  I definetly recommend this UMD for anyone, snowboarder skier or otherwise.",1154908800,4,674,4.528925619834711
