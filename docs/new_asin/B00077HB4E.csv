I usually play 9 holes and was shooting around 52 to 56, terrible. After working with the Explosive Golf Swing, I am now shooting in the 45 neighborhood and steadily improving. My drives are now 200 to 225 yards which is a drastic improvement. I can again get to the green in regulation which is thrilling for me. The game is fun again. This man will share the secrets of generating club head speed with the mechanics that he teaches. All you have to do is pay attention and practice and it will come to you.",1414800000,,629,4.121951219512195
8045608,4,B00077HB4E,"Good: Full of a lot of great tips, great for beginners and reminders for long time golfers.  The intro about allowing the club head swinging around the hosel is good fundamental info.  Great tips on holding the grip and addressing the ball.  Plus, good practicing tips.  Whole video is good to watch over again.

Not so good: The instructor never actually performs a full, explosive swing.  He does have a student assistant that does one in slow motion, but just once and the full swing from start to finish is just a minute at the end.  He also shows you holding the club very far forward - which diminishes the loft, but he doesn't talk about that.

Overall: great video if you can find it at a really good price.",1269561600,,715,4.446153846153846
8045609,5,B00077HB4E,"If you want to learn how to properly swing a golf club, then buy this DVD.  The graphics and music are a little corny, but the information is great.  If you think you know how to swing properly, then buy this DVD.  Unless you are a very low handicap or instructor, there is information in this DVD that will help your game.  I have watched hours of instruction and had professional lessons in person, and I got more information out of this video than any of the other stuff.  Obviously there is no substitute for in person instruction as far as your particular swing, but the info. in this DVD is right on.  And for around $6 how can you go wrong?",1268870400,,647,4.262295081967213
8045610,5,B00077HB4E,"Better than any golf instruction DVD/Book I have read/seen (and I have a lot of golf DVDs/Books...). Very clear instruction, good drills in the sandtrap, first dvd that actually made my game better (by understanding the core fundamentals of golf club design and swing mechanics). Beats all the well-known so-called golf superstar teachers (McLean, Leadbetter, Harmon,...). Highly recommended.",1267660800,,392,5.775862068965517
8045611,5,B00077HB4E,"I have been playing golf on and off for about 30 years. Mr. Jacobs, in this neat ""under the radar"" video, opened my eyes to many concepts in the golf swing that I had no clue about. In all the books, videos, magazines etc., etc., etc. these critical ideas (which make so much sense) were never explained. To add to this, Mr. Jacobs edifies his viewers with cogent, concise, and understandable instruction in a methodical, straightforward manner. Kudos to him and the people who put this fine video together.",1262822400,,507,4.707865168539326
8045612,5,B00077HB4E,"My golf instuctor suggested I watch this  DVD and without any hesitation this man has the most suscinct answer to the golf swing. I have been to many schools, videos,instructors,books, magazines and this is the best I have come across. Good for all levels. Get it today if you want improvement.

8045613,5,B00077HB4E,I really enjoyed this video.  It does not take long to cover the mechanics of the golf swing and it is simple and straight forward.,1196640000,2,131,4.24
