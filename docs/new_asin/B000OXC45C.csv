8187086,4,B000OXC45C,"The movie starts off with the low hum of a synthesizer and the titles flash on the screen, ""Dragons Forever"". How could a movie like this not be good? Another 1980's collaboration (Project A, Wheels on Meals) with Chan, Sammo Hung and lesser known Biao Yuen as a sort of kung-fu three stooges.

Within just a few minutes of the films opening, we see Jackie Chan breaking out some of his patented brand of high octane martial arts. We also get to see some of Sammo Hung's unique fighting abilities, which is pretty impressive considering his size and finally Biao Yuen shows off some of his incredibly acrobatic stunts. One thing that immediately stands out in this movie to me is the music. It's mysterious when it needs to be, fun when it needs to be and suspenseful when it needs to be.

There's just something different about seeing Jackie fight in a black suit and tie opposed to his later acid washed jeans and white t-shirt look. The fight scene on the yacht is absolutely unbelievable and some of Jackie's best stuff ever. As usual the final fight scene is also incredible and impressively incorporates all the main characters. Hopefully this movie will get a proper blu-ray release soon, it definitely deserves one.",1400457600,,1223,4.710280373831775
