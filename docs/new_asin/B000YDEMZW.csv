8231965,5,B000YDEMZW,I bought the DVD to show my 1st graders about the Statue of Liberty.  It's cute for this age and the children enjoyed it.  But I was not aware when buying it that it also has information on Ellis Island.  I would have wished from a teaching standpoint that it was just about the Statue of Liberty.,1296172800,,297,4.175438596491228
