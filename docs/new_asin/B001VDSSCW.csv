3821290,5,B001VDSSCW,"Have just watched ""The Bible Unearthed "" for the second time and know that I will watch it again and again. This DVD (and book) is a treasure trove of new research and scholarship in the field of Biblical archeology. Fascinating viewing for anyone interested in history and especially in the history of Egypt, the Levant, Syria, Mesopotamia, etc. B.C.E. A real eye-opener and brain-opener.",1251936000,15,389,5.0

3821292,5,B001VDSSCW,"This is a pretty awesome little video which is divided into four parts!  Yes, in deference to previous negative reviews, there is some repetition, but it is pretty minor.  The presentation is interesting and presented in a methodical and logical order.  It is a great secular chronology!",1375833600,6,287,5.0638297872340425
3821293,5,B001VDSSCW,"Watching this documentary, which at times seemed a college course in applied theology, for me, at least was very  interesting, intellectually challenging and also entertaining. If you like this type of subject I'm sure it will fascinate you (If you are an open minded individual seeking alternative knowledge beyond traditional teachings). I fully recommend this video.",1367280000,2,369,5.589285714285714
3821294,5,B001VDSSCW,I bought this for my husband because he is very interested in archeology --especially about the Bible.  It's a wonderful set of CD's that lasts for hours and it's very entertaining and extremely interesting.,1365811200,2,207,5.088235294117647
3821295,4,B001VDSSCW,Using archeologicl facts the video postulates that camels did not exist at THE TIME of the patriachs.  The video is well done and is a joy to watch.,1327276800,,148,4.285714285714286
3821296,1,B001VDSSCW,"the title is very amusing one could say. thats what got me sucked in. i wanted to look at an apolegtic view of archeology and historicity of the bible. unfortunately this dvd does not carry those qualities. very repedative, does not have anything a 6th grade history book doesnt already have on the middle east, and so boring. ive seen a dozen movies on archeaology of the bible, and i must say this was the worste. you wanted my opinion and i am trying to speak unabashingly that this movie has no left hook, nothing outstanding, and doesnt even get to the point until 45 minutes in. watch a preview of it on youtube before you buy it",1315612800,4,635,4.389830508474576
3821297,5,B001VDSSCW,"Americans in particular should read the book or watch the program.
May be it will help them to understand the area and its history, that is not the
way it is depicted on TV or explained by politicians here.",1289865600,2,206,4.3076923076923075
3821298,3,B001VDSSCW,"Included in a range of topics, the DVD presents the view that the kingdoms of David and Solomon are portrayed in the Bible in an exaggerated format. The most recent scientific data and archaeological research seems to be leading away from the authors' viewpoint, though the issue is not yet definitively settled. Areas of recent research supporting the biblical portrayal are:

1. Thomas Levy of UC San Diego has apparently verified the existence of industrial level copper production in Edom during the era in question thereby indicating the probability of a large & well organized Solomonic state (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Oct, 2008).

2. The discovery of large walls and early Hebrew writing at Khirbet Qeiyafa from the 10th century BCE indicating a substantial, literate Jewish state (BAR March/April 2010).

3. The unearthing by Eilat Mazar of large fortifications in Jerusalem purportedly from the early years of the Davidic dynasty. If her dating proves correct, Mazar will have provided noteworthy support for extensive Davidic/Solomonic empires (Jerusalem Post, Feb. 23, 2010).

Though the data is leading away from the Finkelstein/Silberman viewpoint, the issue is not yet finally settled (e.g. Mazar's dating). Further UPDATES will be added as things develop either way.",1288656000,17,1305,5.413793103448276
3821299,5,B001VDSSCW,"This documentary is based on the works of archeologist Israel Finkelstein and historian Neil Silberman (that had previously published a book): they confront biblical events of the Old Testament with what history and archeology tell us. The documentary is divided into 4 parts: the Patriarchs (about Abraham), the Exodus (about Moses), the Kings (about David and Solomon), the Book (about the first Israelites, the part I actually prefered). Finkelstein and Silberman comment on their discoveries throughout the documentary, along with other interventions like the very useful one of Thomas Romer, eminent theologian. In the US, many people believe that all of the Bible is historically true, but it's impossible, just like 1+1 will never be equal to 3. Here I'm talking about facts, not interpretations. It's a fact, for instance, that some elements mentioned as happening at the time of Abraham (around -1800 if you follow the Bible) can't have happened before -700. This shows the text was written around that time. It's fact. It doesn't mean Abraham didn't exist, but it means the text we have is not a trustworthy representation of the period it refers to (-1800) but on the contrary is full of elements refering to the period and context in which it was written (or edited if we suppose there were texts mentioning Abraham earlier but they were lost). So, you have various interpretations and hypotheses of those facts, and the documentary presents those of Finkelstein and Silberman, which are quite logical and not eccentric at all. However, they do not talk much about the oral tradition, and if you're interested on that point you should see Nova's documentary The Bible's Buried Secrets. I wish everyone thinking the Bible historically true could see this documentary and... well, let's say could broaden their minds! The purpose of this doc isn't to attack faith (it even brings proof of the existence of David), but to study the Bible for what it is: an ancient text.",1272758400,24,1979,5.055045871559633
3821300,1,B001VDSSCW,"I didn't know and the cover doesn't say whether the DVD was going to endorse the Bible or present it contrary to its own testimony,""inspired of God"" 2 Tim. 3:16. The first 52 minutes ""argues"" there is no archaeological evidence of camels, Philistines during Abraham's time and no evidence of Abraham ever being in Ur, so therefore the Bible is wrong on those issues. (I guess there is nothing left for archaeologists to find, they found it all!) ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" They also say Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were never father, son and grandson with no proof and contrary to archaeological finds! Go figure! Just more Bible-predicted degrading of God's word.",1263427200,25,684,4.905172413793103
8346051,5,B001VDSSCW,Phenomenal look at archaeological results from Finklestein's team working in Israel.  This is a real thinking person's documentary. This goes way beyond the History Channel special of the same name.,1507507200,,198,5.6
8346052,4,B001VDSSCW,"Two scholars aspire to examine the locations mentioned in the Bible to possibly evaluate the accuracy of what the bible says verses what can be proven via digging up the ground. Topics studied include the actuality of the Patriarchs, the actuality of the Exodus, the actuality of Joshua's War Machine, and then the accumulation of the books of the Bible is pondered.

Features maps, interviews, and visits to museums that have artifacts (looted?) from the Holy Land. While occasionally insightful it is a bit disheartening to see long-held beliefs smashed. At one point they question the size of David's/Solomon's Empire. Also mentioned is that the are has been sacked and rebuilt many times so I was left wondering as to the accuracy of the evaluations.",1507248000,,754,5.032
8346053,5,B001VDSSCW,"The Bible Unearthed clearly explains the relationship between the findings of a century of Middle East archeology and that of the Bible's account of the history ancient Israel. Its an amazing work of archeological and biblical scholarship. My own book ""The Bible Through the Eyes of Its Authors"" (was published in 2006 did not have the benefit of the Bible Unearth (2001) because I discovered it only recently, much to my regret. However my experience in writing my book enabled me to appreciate what Finkelstein and Silberman have accomplished by treating the Bible itself as an archeological treasure in its own rightt that reveals the fascinating culture and religion of the ancient authors who wrote it.",1475539200,,707,5.103448275862069
