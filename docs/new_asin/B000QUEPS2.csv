8197420,5,B000QUEPS2,Awesome DVD! It was great to see the story behind the CD I've enjoyed for years. Hearing the stories of the courageous LGBTQ youth of HMI was inspiring. Hope they are all doing well today. This is a must have for all Hedheads.,1406592000,,226,4.27906976744186

8197422,1,B000QUEPS2,"I LOVE Hedwig and the Angry Inch, I own the movie and soundtrack. The song Wicked Little Town makes gets me every time. This DVD is a documentary about teenagers who attend an alternative high school. Proceeds from the sale of 'Wig in a Box' a tribute album of Hedwig songs recorded by different artists will be donated to this school. It tells the story of how these kids face discrimination from their peers and family. Their stories are mixed in with artists renditions of songs from Hedwig. Some of which are not very good. Seeing the artists do take after take and mess up began to get tiresome after a while. I thought the kids liked Hedwig and were fans of it and would sing some of the songs. They didn't and don't.",1208995200,3,723,4.402985074626866

The stories of the LGBT youth were so eye-opening and inspriring.  Highly recommended!",1191801600,,246,5.282051282051282
8197424,5,B000QUEPS2,"What a spectacular documentary. I thouroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. It really gives great insight into the struggles of young people who are considered different by supposed ""normal"" society. I really felt for these people. And as a bonus, it has great music from Hedwig and the Angry Itch compiled by the filmmakers.",1188086400,,330,5.0181818181818185
