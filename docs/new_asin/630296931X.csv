526468,4,630296931X,"For fans of Mifune and Kurosawa, no words are necessary. But for those raised on Western Cinematography and story telling, it is like Opera, you either love it or you hate it.

  The film is outstanding in its scenes of color and panorama. Some of the best camera work ever done.
Japanese film-making cares very little about happy endings, feel-good movies, or ""chic"" flicks. So don't look for them here. But they do have emotional power. The pain of Musashi, in the first film of the Trilogy, is excruciating when he is hunted, starved, and finally suspended by rope from a pine for days upon returning home from a long battle, and the torment of Otsu in the second film, as she spend years waiting near a bridge that Musashi might one day cross. Excellent acting....very powerful performances.
  These films' underlying themes are all about morality. All the characters are heroes. Otsu is long-suffering while loyal to her true love. Musashi is a soul searching warrior. While he spends years refining his swordmanship and seeking honor and fame, she waits hopefully that someday his early promise of a peaceful life with her is realized. I think she ends up a virgin who has been told twice by Musashi that he loves her. Unless I've totally missed the point, these characters are role models. Kurosawa portrays them as what is best in the collective Japanese character. Highly moral views. The women are virgins and the men are swordsmen without defeat. Interesting, huh?
Musashi acquires a reputation as a fighter, but he is frequently instructed that his fighting prowess is not an end in itself and is not the path of a true Samurai. He travels a long road lasting three films to find it. In the end, one Samurai is dead and one is alive. What the surviving Samurai attains is the question I ask. There is no victory, no position attained, no money gained. The point may be, that there is no defeat. Certainly the dead are defeated. The survivor knows he has never been and becomes the epitome of the Samurai. This theme is restated in ""The Magnificent Seven"" (an American remake of Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"")....Places you call home..None; Insults taken...None; Enemies living...None
  The appeal for the Western audience is the desire to be learn cinematography, story-telling, and Japanese Feudal Culture from a master in the art of film-making. This film is rivaled, in scope, only by the likes of ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Bridge On the River Kwai"", or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in American Film.
I gave this Trilogy Four Stars. To earn a Five Star you have to have a killer soundtrack. This did not.",1014940800,11,2605,4.801339285714286
526512,2,630296931X,"I was a huge fan of what Toshiro Mifune did in ""Yojimbo"" and ""Sanjuro"" - the Akira Kurosawa classics... And, being a big fan of more contemporary Asian films, I thought I'd widen my gaze upon other ""classics"" not made by Kurosawa. Thusly, I bought this Criterion Collection item. Toshiro Mifune was good (though not great; I'm not sure the script allowed for great acting) and that's the only reason I didn't give it one star.
I approached the first film with an eagerness to learn more about the legendary swordsman Musashi Miyamoto (after all, it is the title of the first installment). I can't say how accurately his early life was portrayed, but I gained very little insight as to what drove the man. The first two chapters of the trilogy only gave me a glimpse as to how he became a legendary swordsman... Primarily, I had to watch a lot of neurotic female characters throw themselves at Musashi. The fencing was atrociously choreographed (even by the standards of the time) and there wasn't much of it.
The third chapter... Hmmm... How to put this... Somehow the director got even more scenes focused on horribly portrayed female characters than he did in the first two chapters, together. If Andrew ""Dice"" Clay had tried, I doubt he could've done a better job at creating a more chauvinistic portrayal of women.
I almost forgot the movies were supposed to be about a legendary samurai.",1483401600,5,1392,4.732510288065844
526513,5,630296931X,"Toshiro Mifune.  This should be a name more Americans should know.  Sadly, that is not the case.  Mifune is as synonymous to Japanese samurai movies as Clint Eastwood is to Spaghetti Westerns.

Seven Samurai is known to most Westerners as another movie, The Magnificent Seven.  Once that is understood it is easy to see why Mifune's name should be more common.  Even in its original Japanese this is an easy to understand movie.  (I remember paying $75 for a VHS copy of Seven Samurai.)

Once it is understood how important this trilogy is and how respected Mifune is, any viewer with even the most minor of doubt should jump on this deal.",1478908800,5,639,4.642857142857143

A few weeks ago, I tried to watch it again on my relatively new Blu-ray Samsung player, I could not.  My old Toshiba recorder and player gone kaput.  Most likely due to incompatible format of my original recording.  Quite disappointed, I decided to get a DVD for it.  After reading many reviews, I decided that the Blu-ray version should be my choice.  I was right!  The picture and the color quality were astonishingly good for pictures in the 50's!

526647,5,630296931X,"Though no fan of samurai or martial arts movies, I find this magnificent trilogy irresistible. It was director Hiroshi Inagaki's career peak, placing him in the front rank of world filmmakers. In three perfectly linked films, Toshiro Mifune, Koji Tsuruta and a fine cast bring to life The Book of Five Rings, a renowned historical novel by Eiji Yoshikawa. The brilliantly staged yet oddly bloodless action sequences allow a samurai's tale of honor, betrayal, redemption and romance to always hold center stage. If that sounds too intellectual to be fun, it shouldn't. Besides being complex and literary, the trilogy is rousing entertainment. Said to have influenced the Kill Bill pictures, but that';s like saying Moby-Dick influenced Popeye.",1428624000,,742,5.35042735042735

526706,5,630296931X,"Great movie series. These films are much like a classic Western in terms of pace, feel, and atmosphere. However this series is uniquely dialed in to its representative culture and time period.

The three films represent different phases of Miyamoto's life, opening with him as a barbaric reckless wild-man to becoming a philosophical and polished sword master. There is a gravity to the films not just in terms of being based on a real person, but with the time taken on screen to represent the development and events shaping Miyamoto Musashi.

Mifune does an excellent job portraying an individual that develops a thirst to become great and prove it; the ups and downs of the character are performed with real guts and reverence. The total experience is rich, cerebral, and rewarding.",1425945600,,785,4.984732824427481

Firstly, the subtitles control on the main menu does not work at all. I eventually figured out how to put the subtitles on while the movie was playing, but that was after I was sent a second set -- and that's not something I've ever had to do before with any blu-ray or DVD I own. The second set I was sent had a tremendous digital glitch that occurred during the final duel in Disc 2 (between the two characters that the whole movie series bases it's story around). Needless to say, after 6 hours of viewing, to not be able to witness the final duel in toto is more than frustrating.

I just wish they would have went one step further and showed us the last chapter of Musashi's life. I give it my highest recommendation! Mifune starts out  doing what he does best by being a very rough around the edges character and then moving on slowly towards being a truly wise man. Lots of fun and very moving. It is simply the best of it's kind and truly overlooked by modern fans of the Samurai genre, probably due to the lack of uber violence and gore which is sad because this story has both plenty of action if you wait for it and is a beautiful story.

I finally sat down and watched these movies straight through after years of being told and/or reading about how good the trilogy is. The story for me was as generic as any other Samurai film fare. The editing was the most disappointing. The timeline is muddled and the sheer amount of jump cuts is hard to miss. I believe some of the exterior shots were meant to remain on the darker side. Now the sky in many scenes looks fake. The ""love story"" almost becomes a parody. The Clashes song ""should I stay or should I go"" kept going through my mind. Toshiro Mifune is always excellent, but he seemed almost restrained even during the first movie, as if he had more to show but was held back. The fighting choreography is mediocre at best. I know action movies like this were just coming into their own at this time, but when I see a man fall by a sword that is five feet away from him, it screams corny. The Zatoichi films with the late great Shintaro Katsu are far superior and are finally coming to us in bluray via Criterion. This film may have helped usher in an era of samurai films, but it does not stand the test of time. However, do not get me wrong.

'The Samurai Trilogy' is a collection of three films: Musashi Miyamoto, Duel at Ichijoji Temple and Duel at Ganryu Island. The movies star Toshiro Mifune as the legendary figure Musashi Miyamoto and is loosely based on his life (particularly the novel written by Eiji Yoshikawa). Each film chronicles Miyamoto's growth from hot-headed soldier (birth name Takezo) to disciplined Samurai warrior as he fights duels and constantly perfects his swordsmanship and philosophy. Despite mostly being about Miyamoto's skill with a sword the films are more reflective than action-packed as Musashi struggles with his love for the woman Otsu. The performances of Toshiro Mifune, Kuroemon Onoe, Kaoru Yachigusa and Rentaro Mikuno go a long way towards selling the story but there's not denying each film has it's dragging moments.

While the drama in 'The Samurai Trilogy' is a bit outdated and Hiroshi Inagaki's story-telling doesn't have the universal appeal of the more prolific Japanese directors, his use of color and setting make this Blu-ray transfer a knock-out! The rainy battlefields, the duels at sunrise, and the colorful costumes really pop off the screen and made me forget I was watching a movie made over 60 years ago!

Normally I'd never call 'The Samurai Trilogy' ""must-see"" films but this Blu-ray clean-up is practically essential viewing! It may be hard to get wrapped up in the narrative and the lack of widescreen will take some getting used to but it's hard not to be impressed by the renewed emphasis on color and location. Hopefully this will encourage the Criterion Collection to clean-up Hiroshi Inagaki's (much better) 'Chushingura'.",1355011200,17,1899,5.219672131147541
526929,4,630296931X,"While many viewers from the west are familiar with Akira Kurosawa and his samurai films, there was another filmmaker known in Japan for his samurai films and also working with actor Toshiro Mifune.

The filmmaker is Hiroshi Inagaki.  A stage actor who joined Nikkatsu back in 1922 but wanted to become a director in 1928.  And within the next 20 years, Inagaki would direct several films including ""Muhomatsu no Issho"", a film that was selected as the 8th best Japanese film of all time according to a 1989 poll with Japanese film critics and filmmakers.

In America, Hiroshi Inagaki is best known for the ""Samurai Trilogy"" which included the following films: ""Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto"" (1954), ""Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple"" (1955) and ""Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island"" (1956).  The first film in the trilogy, would earn Hiroshi Inagaki an honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

All three films revolve around the Japanese swordsman known as Shinmen Takezo or Miyamoto Musashi.  Musashi is the founder of the Hyoho Niten Ichi-ryu swordsmanship and the author of ""The Book of Five Rings"" and is considered in Japan as one of the greatest warriors of all time.

Part of the popularity about Musashi is that unlike samurai's who serve a master, Musashi was a warrior who was not interested in that.  All that mattered was becoming the best swordsman.  And there are many legendary stories of how Musashi took on the greatest swordsmen in Japan and also taking out an army.

And with every decade, there are fictional stories about Musashi, may it be for anime, manga or video games.

But if there was one fictional storyline that have inspired the stories, it would be from Hiroshi Inagaki's three films.

Back in 1999, ""The Samurai Trilogy"" would be released in America on DVD courtesy of The Criterion Collection.

In June 2012, The Criterion Collection has released ""The Samurai Trilogy"" on Blu-ray featuring a new high-definition digital restoration of all three films with uncompressed monaural soundtracks and three interviews for each film with translator and historian William Scott Wilson about the real-life Musashi Miyamoto.

VIDEO:

""The Samurai Trilogy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1).  As a previous owner of the original 1999 DVD set, for many Criterion Collection fans back then, there were many who felt the quality was not up to par with other Criterion Collection DVD's and many have wished for a remaster using newer technology.  While the Criterion Collection did remaster many of their earlier releases, ""The Samurai Trilogy"" was an unknown situation because who knows how bad the original negative source was in order to make a brand new digital transfer.

This time around, Criterion Collection went back and gave a new high definition transfer of the three films.  Not only are thinks much lighter, colorful and showcase much clarity, one of the biggest problems of the DVD is how murky and blurry it looked.  There color flickering and unevenness with the old DVD's but on Blu-ray, this is no longer the case.

The new version has a fine layer of grain, colors and scenes look much better than ever before.  While not pristine, as the film does have scenes with a few white specks, the Blu-ray release of ""The Samurai Trilogy"" is so much better than the original DVD's.  Even during the darker moments of the film, where the DVD looked too murky and blurry...not anymore. Even the third film which uses vignettes, no longer is the video too dark.

There is greater clarity on Blu-ray, colors are consistent and you can tell that the Criterion Collection put a lot of time into fixing the video of these three films for the 2012 Blu-ray release.  It's not perfect but definitely an improvement over the older DVD picture quality.

According to the Criterion Collection, these new high-definition digital transfers were created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35 mm low-contrast prints struck from the original camera negatives.  Criterion also corrected the occasional color fluctuations inherent in the decades-old Eastmancolor stock on which these films were originally shot. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, spices and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' Phoenix and PF Clean were used for small dirt, grain, noise reduction, jitter and flicker.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Samurai Trilogy"" is presented in monaural.  Dialogue is crystal clear and I heard no pops, clicks or any audio problems during my viewing of the film.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtracks were remastered at 24-bit from the 35 mm optical positives.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Samurai Trilogy"" on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:

  On Musashi Miyamoto Part I - (8:37) Translator and historian Wilson (author of ""The Lone Samurai"") discusses""Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto"" and similarities and differences of the first film to the real life of Musashi Miyamoto.
  On Musashi Miyamoto Part II - (7:13) Translator and historian Wilson (author of ""The Lone Samurai"") discusses ""Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple"" and similarities and differences of the first film to the real life of Musashi Miyamoto.
  On Musashi Miyamoto Part III - (7:13) Translator and historian Wilson (author of ""The Lone Samurai"") discusses ""Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island"" and similarities and differences of the first film to the real life of Musashi Miyamoto
  Trailer I - (2:51) The original theatrical trailer for ""Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto"".
  Trailer II - (3:46) The original theatrical trailer for ""Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple"".
  Trailer III - (3:12) The original theatrical trailer for ""Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island"".

EXTRAS:

Included is a 28-page booklet featuring the essay ""Musashi Mifune"" by Stephen Prince and ""The Book of Five Rings"" by William Scott Wilson.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A path of self discovery.  A path to become the greatest warrior.  This is the journey of Takezo/Musashi.  A swordsman who follows the sword, not a master nor a woman.

Hiroshi Inagaki's ""The Samurai Trilogy"" plays out like poetry.  Unlike other samurai films, the story of legendary swordsman/warrior Miyamoto Musashi is exciting for people in Japan and also those interested in samurai culture.  Having been portrayed in a variety of media in so many different forms, may it be video games, anime or manga, because there is not one perfect way to describe Musashi's life, because information that far long ago is scarce, one must go through Musashi's own book or historical documents.

We know that Hiroshi Inagaki's version of the character of Musashi is fictionalized, but when it comes to capturing the elements of that era and also elements of Musashi's life and battles, there is no doubt that ""The Samurai Trilogy"" has been looked at as a primary source for people to gain information of the famous swordsman.

The film has inspired many storylines, especially of a soldier or a fighter who chooses a life of loneliness in order to pursue their goal of becoming the greatest warrior.  We can see how Musashi's character has permeated to Japanese modern entertainment in different forms such as Ryu of the ""Street Fighter"" video games to other samurai film adaptations.

Musashi represents man in search of himself, his true inner power, his happiness and fulfillment.  The first film ""Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto""  deals with one man wanting fame and having been educated through books and adopting a new name.  The second film ""Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple"" deals with one man's quest to become the great swordsman, but also torn by his emotions of whether he should be in love or pursue a life of loneliness and continue to follow the sword.

The third and final film features a much more wiser Musashi who has accomplished a lot in life.  Understanding the value of life but also knowing that his greatest rival is waiting for a battle.  While this wiser Musashi has changed from the more unruly Takezo (as seen in the first film), we see how much he has matured by the third film and also considering love but knowing that his search for finding the greatest warrior, will probably come to an end, whether he lives or dies when he battles Kojiro Sasaki.

And while the film is about a man's journey to self-discovery, we also see how life is for the two women who have fallen for Musashi.  For Otsu and Akemi, these two women have gone through tremendous burden and have traveled long and far to be with him. Will Musashi end his swordfighting days to finally marry a woman and have a family?  Who knows.

But the story is quite poetic as like the four seasons, we see the maturation and change within Musashi in each film.

As for the fighting, this is another major plus for ""The Samurai Trilogy"" as the fighting choreography is absolutely excellent, well-planned and well-executed.  It does help to have the talented Toshiro Mifune, who has worked closely with both Hiroshi Inagaki and Akira Kurosawa, but the commitment to capturing the action during that time was well-done.  If there is any fault to these films is that the realism of showing blood or disembowelment or loss limbs is not prevalent until years later in Japan.  But still, ""The Samurai Trilogy"" did work remarkably well.

And as for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned earlier, having owned the original Criterion Collection DVD's, the video quality has been a sore spot for owners when it was first released.  The video looked dark, murky and colors were often inconsistent.  But still, many hoped for the next decade for a re-release of ""The Samurai Trilogy"" and to tell you the truth, I wasn't sure if it would happen or could happen because of the original source where the transfer was made from before.

But the Criterion Collection really pulled out the stops for this Blu-ray releae of ""The Samurai Trilogy"".  All the problems that I had with the original DVD are non-existent with this Blu-ray release.  Better colors, better video, lossless soundtrack and special features.  Also, as a major plus for fans, no need to purchase all three films separately.  All three films are included in the Blu-ray release of ""The Samurai Trilogy"".

So, yes...Hiroshi Inagaki has quite a few masterpieces in his filmmaking oeuvre, but ""The Samurai Trilogy"" are three films that will be forever remembered.  Wonderful storyline, the set design and costume design were excellent.  The acting performance by Toshiro Mifune was fantastic but also the acting by the two women of the film, Kaoru Yachigusa (Otsu) and Mariko Okada (Akemi).

Overall, for those who have watched and enjoyed plethora of samurai films in their lifetime, ""The Samurai Trilogy"" are three films that one must watch in their lifetime.  And for Criterion Collection or samurai film enthusiasts, ""The Samurai Trilogy"" on Blu-ray is definitely worth owning!  Highly recommended!",1354147200,25,11141,5.038251366120218

Ikiru is one of my all time favorite non-samurai films and Kagemusha was my favorite samurai film.  Now I may have to revise that opinion.  The films are based on a real swordsman who was unbeatable.  He often bludgeoned his opponents to death with a wooden staff or a wooden sword.  The films mostly stick closely to what is known of Takeza Musashi's life.  There are fictional characters such as his love Otsu.  Frankly I found Otsu's character tiresome but I do understand why she is used as a foil for Musashi as he tries to overcome his imperfections.  The scenes and fight choreography are excellent and the 60 year old color footage does not show its age.

Unfortunately, whoever did the remastering didn't bother to learn anything about the films before doing the work.  As a result, he/she/it not only removed imperfections from the prints, but also did away with the filters Inagaki used for his night scenes.  In the second film, the result is monstrous.  All the scenes at night (the ambush at the bridge, the climactic battle at the temple) are no longer drenched in the beautiful and haunting blue tints that Inagaki used to such effect in preparing the film.

526991,5,630296931X,"The Samurai Trilogy is without doubt Hiroshi Inagaki's ""Magnum opus"" it is epic, sprawling yet always remains gripping and riveting. These Three parts follow famous Japanese swordsman Musashi Miyamoto from wild young man to master swordsman and his various adventures and duels. The first part: Musashi Miyamoto follows him from his transformation from young wild man to refined master swordsman. The first film is the most gripping and brilliant starting with battle as Musashi finds himself on the losing side and attempts to travel back home with is friend encountering different dangers along the way. Part II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple follows his adventures as he gets involved in tournament with a master school and in a brilliant finale takes on lots of samurai. In Part III: Duel at Ganryu Island Musashi must help help a village under attack from bandits in a plot similar to Seven Samurai and fight in duel with famous swordsman Sasaki Kojir. The gripping final showdown is a classic old style duel unlike later samurai films where they slash and cut each other their final showdown is a thought out and clever fight where each use the weather and skills to outsmart each other. Toshiro Mifune (alongside Tatsuya Nakadai as one the best actors in Samurai film) is brilliant as the wild ruffian who develops a maturity to wise swordsman and Kaoru Yachigusa as Otsu, the beautiful, patience and long suffering lover of Musashi. This really is a brilliant samurai series beautifully directed by Inagki boasting action and drama and deserves to be in any Japanese fan's collection. Criterion's new 2012 DVD release (pictured) is a massive improvement on their previous 2005 release (which was terrible VHS quality), the image quality here is vastly superior and brilliantly remastered boasting crystal clear imagery doing the film the justice it deserves.

What was lost was the patina of the original dvd, which imo was very faithful to THE FILM,,,but I guess that is to be expected. The colors are flat(you see it especially in the faces), not rich, and has no depth. In some scenes, the color is downright acidic, like when Akemi and Otsu meet at the bridge for the first time.

Basically, for the sake of ""crystalline imagery"" the brightness was popped but the color turns flat. The twilight scene of the Yoshioka ambush ( the introduction of Kojiro) is as bright as day. In scenes like this and others, if you want a FAITHFUL rendering of the original film, the first dvd is absolutely superior.

526996,5,630296931X,"My favorite film of all time is ""Seven Samurai"". However, The Samurai Trilogy is arguably just as good as that masterpiece. For those who don't know, The Samurai Trilogy is a sprawling three-film saga based on the life and exploits of a renowned swordsman by the name of Musashi Miyamoto. The films are ""Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto"", ""Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple"", and Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island"". The films in the Samurai Trilogy provide an interesting contrast to ""Seven Samurai"", even if they are barely related except for their historical subject matter; although they share a star in Toshiro Mifune, ""Seven"" is a bit more freewheeling and ragged (and all the better for it), whereas the Mushasi Miyamoto films are more formally structured and beautiful in a classical way. Together, the three pictures which comprise The Samurai Trilogy (and the novel on which they were based) have often been referred to as Japan's ""Gone With the Wind"", with their historical focus, lush cinematography, larger-than-life characters, romance and epically staged scenes. Truly, the three Samurai films can stand toe to toe with the best of Old Hollywood.

I have had some luck passing along my affection for the Kurosawa-Mifune samurai pictures to my friends and family members. ""Seven Samurai"", ""Yojimbo"" and even ""Sanjuro"" have found footholds in some of their film libraries. But I haven't had as much luck transmitting the love for Hiroshi Inagaki's trilogy. Perhaps that wasn't a failing of the films but of the transfer on the previous DVD release, which was little better than VHS quality and an unusually terrible showing from Criterion. For films like these which derive much of their power from visual artistry, a bad transfer can be a real killer for a casual or novice viewer.

When I read that Criterion was updating the trilogy, I was pretty stoked, to say the least; a good remastering of these films was tops on my home video wish list. Well, Criterion surpassed my every expectation. Brace yourself for a clich&eacute;, but when I broke the seal and played the first film on the Blu Ray, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. I believe my first words were, ""holy sh...!"" The image upgrade is stunning. Maybe it's just because the old release was so bad, but I personally think it's one of the best restorations I've ever seen. For a great example, look no further than an early scene in which Takezo/Musashi (played by Mifune) and his comrade Matahachi dig a ditch on the battlefield in the pouring rain. Retreating soldiers stagger across the muddy plain while lightning streaks across the sky. It's beautiful. It's epic. And unlike the DVD version, it's actually clear. I could not be happier with this release, and now I can finally show my loved ones what I've been seeing through the muck all these years.

Now, if only they could do something about ""The Quiet Man""... (hint, hint, Criterion!)",1343260800,10,2919,4.9048582995951415

526999,3,630296931X,"This package brings together a trilogy of films made in the 1950s about the legendary Japanese swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645).  Musashi remains an interesting figure almost four centuries after his death.  In his younger years, he fought some 60 duels, and was never defeated.  Later in life, he wrote a manual of strategy that is still read today.  This early treatment, directed by Hiroshi Inagaki and starring Toshiro Mifune, provides a simplified and perhaps overly favorable portrait.  In the first film, he evolves from a wild, impulsive youth into a self-disciplined warrior.  In the second, he fights and defeats many opponents.  The third film is rather slow-moving, but is notable for its climactic scene, in which Musashi duels his arch-rival, Kojiro Sasaki.  All three films idealize Musashi, and to heighten the contrast, show his opponents in a negative light.  What is missing here is psychological depth.  Neither Musashi's ambition nor his intelligence really come across.  Later treatments suggest that Musashi was a more complex, and much darker figure.  A second series of films made in the early 1960s show him as more introspective, suggesting that his ambition derived from inner conflicts.  A more recent TV series in 2003 portrays him as manic, obsessed with establishing his status as Japan's best swordsman, relentlessly driven by his inner demons, intelligent but psychopathic.  While the 1950s films tell Musashi's story, the interpretation is rather superficial.",1340841600,6,1501,5.413793103448276
527000,4,630296931X,"The main thing missing is the much anticipated commentary track. I got so used to Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, and others that I got spoiled with. I know this is not a Kurosawa masterpiece but it's still a masterpiece on its own. Wish they had a commentary track with Stephen Prince. Anyways...for each of the 3 films, William Wilson, gives the historical info on the real Musashi Miyamoto and how it relates to the film where many parts are fictitious for entertainment purposes and you'll find them in the ""supplements"" section.

They put the 2 bluray discs on one spindle which is divided top and bottom and the booklet on the left side on a single bluray case. I have a slight gripe about this set up. First, the films can't be sold separately because 2 movies are on 1 50gb bluray dual layer and the 3rd movie is on the 2nd bluray 25gb single layer. So, wanting a collector's item goes right out the door due to not having individualized packaging just like Yojimbo and Sanjuro.

The films are in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio  at 1080p HD and amazon's listing at 1.77:1 is incorrect. When viewing on your widescreen TV, you'll see 2 black bars to the sides just like Seven Samurai. The picture quality is definitely leaps and bounds superior to that of the 2004 criterion DVD release. The colors are vibrant and the contrast is maxed out. Almost feels like I'm watching something new entirely. Some might be turned off by the heavy grain quality but keep in mind this film is old. In todays standards with recent films, the grainy quality would be unacceptable. Audio has been improved as well with a noticeable higher Mhz monaural. If you're watching on a 120Hz or 240Hz refresh rate TV, go ahead and turn them off, it gets distracting with the blurriness of movements.

The dvd collection was junk and the price they were asking was robbery. You will be more than satisfied with this Bluray copy of Samurai Trilogy. t is a tremendous improvement over the last Criterion copy.  Great job Criterion you finally got this one right.

I won't talk about the story, because you all probably know it, if you are considering buying it. Remember this bluray isn't going to be a 2012 bluray, with vivid color and crystal sharp textures. A vast improvement from what you have seen.  You can't argue with a Toshiro Mifune movie, you can see the maturation of his acting skills, from a young actor to the veteran actor in some of Kurosawa's best movies.

527030,4,630296931X,"The Criterion Collection's Samurai Trilogy boxed set consists of the three films from the series in their original hardshell cases all contained in a single cardboard box. There are no special features except for trailers for each of the three movies. The film quality is not cleaned up to the extent that you expect from Criterion, but it is perfectly watchable and of vastly better quality than any public domain DVDs or most other releases of films from the era.

The trilogy makes up one very good epic drama loaded with action and romance. The three movies tell a single story with one movie beginning more-or-less where the last one left off. Concerning the production there are a lot of continuity errors, especially when you can't always tell if it is day or night and sometimes swaps back and forth in a single scene. The picture is not always clear and is sometimes dark during the day and light at night, but it somehow works. The imagery is very beautiful combining natural and artificial scenery. I love the dead trees that are in nearly every scene from the first two movies. The plot is rambling and doesn't make a lot of sense sometimes. The characters can be difficult to keep track of. I was not always sure of character motivations. However this trilogy was highly entertaining on the first viewing, and I believe that it will reveal deeper layers and richer colors (metaphorically speaking) on repeat viewings. A flawed but excellent series of films.

Don't buy this boxed set just because of the Criterion package because the image isn't perfectly cleaned up, there are almost no bonus features, and the box it comes in is nothing special. However the fact that this collection is Criterion gives you some indication that the movies are good - and they are. So if you find yourself in the mood for a lengthy samurai epic with a dark mood and a greater focus on story than violence, then you can't go wrong with this Criterion release of the Samurai Trilogy.",1314489600,2,1978,4.713872832369942
527031,2,630296931X,"The Japanese film industry has been cranking out superb samurai movies for decades. This particular trilogy, however, does not represent a high point in the genre's history.

The trilogy tells the story of Musashi Miyamoto (played here by legendary actor Toshiro Mifune), a master swordsman who spends his time wandering the countryside and getting into duels with various other tough guys. These duels are deeply unconvincing, in terms of staging - people will fall over even when a sword thrust misses them by about three feet. Worse yet, there are never any interesting reasons offered as to *why* these samurai are always fighting. Miyamoto and his rivals are dedicated to fighting simply for its own sake, and to prove who is the ""toughest"" or ""best"" swordsman. The endless macho posturing of these characters (""I hold the supreme [swordfighting] diploma!"") grated on me after a while; watching these idiots constantly attack each other is tantamount to watching two bratty kids have a snowball fight. If you're looking for complex characters with compelling motivations, then look elsewhere.

Inevitably, in a series of action films that's so conservative and silly, the female characters have little or nothing to do. Unbelievably, two women fall in love with Miyamoto and pursue him endlessly, even though he's cold to them and repeatedly insists that he prefers swordfighting to loving. Miyamoto's treatment of both women is nasty and tough to watch, and dates the films terribly.

In the trilogy's defense, it does occasionally attempt to put forward serious moral messages. While the plot involves a silly amount of duelling, there is some talk about how Miyamoto should not kill people simply to prove that he's the best; a true samurai should show restraint. But this ""pacifist"" message is delivered in a corny way - with Miyamoto even putting down his sword for a while and becoming a farmer (!) - and it's undermined by the trilogy's violent conclusion anyway.

Oh, and by the way, the Criterion Collection DVD releases of this trilogy have dark and muddy prints. So you won't even get much visual joy out of these much-overrated films. If you're interested in samurai films of, um, greater substance, I would suggest Harakiri, Samurai Rebellion, Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Love and Honor, The Twilight Samurai, and The Hidden Blade.

527057,3,630296931X,"Hiroshi Inagaki's 1954-1956 three part color film, The Samurai Trilogy, is unlike many filmic trilogies for the very fact that it is, indeed, one exactly five hour long film, and not three separate linked films, for the first two films have no real endings. In this way it has much in common with The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. However, whereas those three are separate films, more or less, their source work is not. Yes, J.R.R. Tolkien's book is often printed in three separate volumes, but it is one work. This three part film is also derived from one singular literary work, from Eiji Yoshikawa's 1935 novel Musashi, loosely based upon the real life 17th Century Japanese folk hero, the samurai Musashi Miyamoto, who penned a classic book called The Book Of Five Rings. That all stated, the landscapes of Japan and sheer numbers of extras in this film are far more impressive, visually, than the CG crap that the Lord Of The Rings films spewed. Overall, The Samurai Trilogy is a good film, but while the narrative story gets better and tighter with each succeeding film, the visual quality of each succeeding film worsens on The Criterion Collection's three disks, both in the original film stock and the poor transfers.

If nothing else, this film, The Samurai Trilogy, can be seen as a sort of training ground for the great Toshiro Mifune to try out and perfect a wide range of acting styles and characters within character that he would unleash on the film lovers of the world throughout the rest of his career, be it in his films with Kurosawa, or long after. And, if a film can be said to have allowed something like that to happen, then its merits are certainly more than its flaws, melodramatic or not. But, even on top of that, a film like this acts as a sort of entre into the greater and deeper art put out by the aforementioned masters, and allows those great works of art to be more greatly appreciated, for contrast can clarify what the mists of the ineffable do not.

527092,4,630296931X,"I really enjoyed reading Eiji Yoshikawa's book Musashi.  It's a wonderful journey filled with some incredible characters and more twists than you can imagine.  The Samurai trilogy starring Toshiro Mifune is a good rendition of the book, although it misses alot of the builds, drama and character development.  It's deinitely worth addiing to your ""Samurai collection"".",1170201600,2,368,5.535714285714286
527093,5,630296931X,"Japan loves the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi,and in this version Toshiro Mifune is absolutely charming. He acted in this at about the same time as Seven Samurai, if I am not mistaken, and surely he took a page from his 7 Samurai characterization of Kikuchiyo. His youthful Musashi is an animal!(he's not Musashi yet! He was still Takezo! He had to EARN his name!)

But, he learns. And, though it takes three films to tell the tale, it is most enjoyable throughout. Mifune was young, handsome, at his physical prime, and a darn entertaining actor! Ok, maybe the director Inagaki is no Kurosawa. Still, if you like this genre, this is fun!",1169078400,,643,4.741071428571429
527094,4,630296931X,"The trilogy roughly follows Eiji Yoshikawa's famous book Musashi.  Just think of it as cliffnotes because as the saying goes ""the book is always better than the movies.""

Toshiro Mifune is a fantastic actor as always and Kaoru Yachigusa is breath-takingly beautiful.  The drama is non-stop and theres only so much that can be incorporated into a 2 hour movie so there are some dis-continuity in the sequence of scenes.  The climatic battles with the Yoshioko school, Baiken and Kojiro Sasaki is a different but ingenious interpretation of the book.

The Musashi trilogy is not an Akira Kurosawa thought provoking films because it is meant as a movie adaptation of the book.  If you read the book then you maybe dissappointed of so many cut scenes, different interpretations and inconsistencies as I was.

Bottom line, if you like samurai movies and Toshiro Mifune than its a must have.",1168473600,2,885,4.9391891891891895
527095,5,630296931X,"The content has been summarized by others.  For the person who has not seen these films, the summary cannot convey the content of these 3 films.

In short, the story of perhaps the greatest master of Japanese sword skill ever, a historical/almost mythical figure from 1600 feudal Japan.

The 3 movies tell of his evolution from a young hot head with exceptional ability, to a master of both his martial art and of life from a Japanese Shinto perspective.

These films are full of Japanese culture and mentality.

The actors are spell binding.

The fight sceens are believable and of the highest standard.  (No, the actors cannot walk up walls!!! and fly through the air!!!).

The story for me, was and is deeply moving.

Do not misunderstand, my insight and identification does not parallel that of the main character, but it is a story  which has become part of me.

I do not know if this will appeal to every one.

It is in Japanese with subtitles.

Some parts of the film become slow.

Nonetheless, for me, this is a masterpiece and one of my all time favorites.

Their are not too many trilogies that hold together this well - maybe 'Star Wars' gives us this sort of vision as well. Toshiro Mifune, of course steals the show, and is very convincing in this kind of role. The cinematography is quite nice (especially in the first and last film) and we get to see a lot of beautiful natural images throughout the film - I am reminded of the Japanese love for nature that has been written so much about (read D.T. Suzuki's 'Zen and Japanese Culture' as another fine example). Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase. I think it has the power to inspire.",1117843200,35,839,4.490196078431373

Regarding the DVD transfer, let me first say that I am a frugal guy who does not think that any DVD, however good the transfer, is ever worth 30 bucks.  That said, I don't know what all the fuss is about over the image quality on these disks.  The film was not released in widescreen so the full-screen image is correct.  The only scenes which are perhaps too dark are in the end of the second film, because it was filmed that way originally!  The VHS is even darker as far as I could tell.  I have 20/40 vision, yet I had absolutely no problem reading the subtitles ever in any of the three films.  The image quality in general is not Jeanne d'Arc but it certainly never came close to impairing my ability to enjoy the films.  Finally, there are no special features beyond theatrical trailers on any of the DVDs, but the three-pack is also priced cheaper than any other Criterion issues (less than $20/disc) so why complain!",1100304000,109,1299,4.497872340425532
527099,3,630296931X,"These are very entertaining movies and well worth watching (They have more than just entertainment value as well.  They have a good story and excellent choreography).  Watching them depends on you having the ability to increase the brightness (contrast and color too) of your player.  If you can't do that, do not buy these movies.  The movies will likely just frustrate you.

Hopefully someday someone will release these with more care put into the finished product.  Until then, you'll have to jack up the brightness.",1098576000,3,519,5.047058823529412

Im sure that the VHS versions could have been better created as far as the techinical side, but I seemed to have been able to see and to read everything I needed to.

In terms of plot, yes there is the journey of learning of the hero, but it is as much a love story as it is a journey.  The acting and action sequences (using the less is more technique with power added by the viewer's imagination)  are consistently excellent and the totality of the films make for a rich cinematic experience.

527135,3,630296931X,"While I think the trilogy is overall well done, there are a few things that make this a questionable buy.
First, the ""darkness."" I think it could've very well been prevented through editing, but the publisher neglected this. You cannot see half the movie due to overwhelming darkness. This is especially bad when it comes down to the fighting scenes, where you cannot see anything at all. It's extremely frustrating not being able to see.
Second, I will say that the story roughly follows that of the book, Musashi - by Eiji Yoshikawa. You get the overall story, but there are a ton of things that have been changed for the sake of the trilogy. I really think that the film has deviated far too much from the book which it is based. Read the book and you will surely know what I mean.
It would be best to wait for the various Japanese TV series on this story to come to the US (or seek them out from overseas) than to buy this. It's nice to see Toshiro Mifune, but it is a shame to see something that could've been done much better. I think the biggest fault lies with the publisher.",1087516800,13,1083,4.3399014778325125
