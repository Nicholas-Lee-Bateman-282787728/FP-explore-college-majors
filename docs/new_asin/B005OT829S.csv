4854500,5,B005OT829S,Fourth movie in the Gamma 1 Quadrilogy. The aliens in this one use the same control room the heroes used in the previous movies. A surprise trip to one of Jupiter's moons is an added bonus.,1410652800,5,189,4.277777777777778
4854501,5,B005OT829S,"Fun 60's Italian SciFi flicks.  A fun trip back in time to an age of relative scientific & technological ignorance in SciFi movie making.  The pace of the movie was based upon then attention spans, the acting pretty standard for ""foreign"" films of that era and the ""special effects"" primitive to say the least.  But as a window on SciFi entertainment and social standards of the 60's a fine example.",1406592000,2,399,4.671428571428572

4854503,3,B005OT829S,"I can understand that these movies must look pretty bad for today's audiences and
i don't blame them, but if you were born in the 50-60's you know that science fiction movies in those days were made on shoe string budgets but because color
tv's just came out and there was only so many movies available, we all took
everything with a grain of salt. Special effects were crappy...but that ok , as we
used our imaginations to make them better.
  I never saw snow devils at the theater, but did see it on TV a few times many
moons ago. And now thats it out on DVD, im very pleased to have a copy of it. Wait
till you see the Yetis. Anyway it always lots of fun watching these flicks.

The only complaint that i have, is that When the film was copied to DVD, they cut
short the end titles by a few seconds..missing the soundtrack as it ends.
To prove that the film does not end abrutly like it did...i verify with my bootleg
copy that i have in storage...yep ...they did prematurely end it.

Were they in a hurry, are all DVDs burned like this.  For the price they are
charging, better care should be taken when burning their DVD-R.

Ive also ordered 12 men to the moon....copy looks pretty clear....",1327622400,25,1196,4.269911504424779

8481800,3,B005OT829S,"This movie SOUNDED good, or at least passable. I enjoy searching for old sci fi movies I might have somehow missed. The cover of this DVD looks interesting. Yet unfortunately the actual movie is another amateurish Italian space opera without much to redeem it. The elements which hold some promise end up being boring and badly handled. The invading aliens are fat men with very cheap green greasepaint and very bad haircuts. The standard issue Earth hero is a stiff jerk with no real acting ability. The females are typically stacked 1960s style with zero character development. Some of the sets and SFX are interesting from a collector's point of view. This movie was clearly put together on a shoestring budget, and that's being charitable. It's just this side of unwatchable. However I gave it three stars anyway: It IS an old sci fi movie, there ARE spaceships, there ARE aliens... it's just not very well put together. It has promise, but it falls flat, over and over again. This is from the same group which produced ""The Green Slime"".",1472256000,2,1042,4.794444444444444

8481806,4,B005OT829S,"Good, basic DVD.  No frills - no chapters, subtitles, or anything like that.  But a good clear print of the film.  Sound and picture were both fine.  Certainly not a great film, but it is what it is: spaghetti sci-fi.  Gotta love that the hero is from ""White River Junction, VT.""  I wonder how you say that in Italian?",1421712000,2,318,4.305084745762712
