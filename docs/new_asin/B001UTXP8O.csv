8345037,4,B001UTXP8O,Cruel intentions is a great movie but do not expect to be wowed by parts 2 and 3.  2 is just a bad remake of the first and god knows what 3 is.  It is not a bad deal for all three and is potentially a good collectors item especially because it is really hard to find 2 and 3 elsewhere.  2 is very watchable because it's a bad remake of the first but it still holds your attention.  3 goes off on its own tangent and u will probably lose interest fast.  It is noteworthy that 2 and 3 were straight to DVD movies.  Overall the packaging wasn't bad and doesnt matter too much that all three discs are stacked on each other inside the case.,1342051200,3,636,3.968503937007874
8345038,5,B001UTXP8O,If you liked Cruel Intentions one then the others are pretty much the same thing.  Interesting movies.,1280707200,2,102,5.0
8345039,3,B001UTXP8O,"I loved Cruel Intentions. I liked Cruel Intentions 2. Frankly I've never seen Cruel Intentions 3, but this was the cheapest way to get the other 2, and I figured I would give 3 a chance. My rating for the product steams not from the quality of the movies, the disks, even the price. I am upset with the packaging. From the look of the photo, one would expect slim cases, a single case with three slots, or even a three single cases that were just bound together for shipment. This was not the case. I received 1 dvd case that was three disks deep. The disks are stacked ontop of each other! This is an excellent way to ruin your dvd disks very quickly. I've resorted to using paper envelopes instead (which themselves are not the greatest idea). It's a good value for the money, but had I known what I know now, I would have spent the extra for the individual dvds.",1273795200,4,865,4.280487804878049
