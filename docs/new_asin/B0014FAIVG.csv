3131416,5,B0014FAIVG,"Mannix, starring Mike Connors, was one of television's greatest private eyes. Only Tom Selleck's Thomas Magnum and James Garner's Jim Rockford would seem to be in the same category as far as popularity, durability, and enjoyment. Forged in the tough, hardboiled tradition of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, Mannix brought these novelists' archtypes to the small screen - beaten up, beats up, lied to, and tied up. But he endured for eight seasons.

While Mannix is best remember for his cool house, office, and girl Friday Peggy Fair, the first season of the show saw Mannix work not for himself, but a detective agency that used the first type of computers to solve crimes, and Mannix was seen as a dinosaur who was doing things the old fashioned way. Of course, the old street-smart dinosaur was the one solving the crimes for his boss, played by Joesph Campanella.

This series is one I've been waiting for forever. For all of us who grew up admiring him as THE private eye before Rockford and Magnum came on the scene, it's high time that this was released on DVD.",1204156800,14,1075,4.74331550802139

3131418,5,B0014FAIVG,"Finally, FINALLY, the very best Classic TV detective series EVER produced comes to DVD in a first-season set. For its legion of fans, it is a huge understatement to say this release is eagerly anticipated. Thanks to CBS/Parmount for putting this series out on DVD. Let's hope the remaining seasons quickly follow.

Mannix ran from 1967 through 1975 on CBS. Created by Richard Levinson and William Link and developed by executive producer Bruce Geller (who also created Mission: Impossible), the title character, Joe Mannix, is a two-fisted private investigator portrayed by Mike Connors.

Rarely has an actor so inhabited a TV character that it's impossible to separate the two. This series represents one of those times, and even the show's producers recognized it when the unusual credit proclaimed: Mike Connors IS Mannix. The ruggedly handsome Connors was the perfect match, and made the signature loud sports jackets of the time look great on his altar ego. Mannix also drove a variety of convertibles, and even had a car phone - which was unheard of at the time!

Mannix originally worked for a high-concept computerized firm known as Intertect in the rarely seen first season. This DVD set represents all of those episodes, including the series' pilot.

Mannix featured a dynamic split-screen opening credits sequence set to its theme music from noted composer Lalo Schifrin. Unusual for a private detective series, the Mannix theme is in triple time, the same signature used for a waltz.

(FYI: The show's title, opening credits and closing credits are in variations of ""City Typeface,"" a distinctive, squared-off, split-serif face that has long been used by IBM Corporation as part of their corporate design, and continues to be used in its logo today. The use of this style of credits for Mannix spelled out his name as if on computer punch cards utilized by fictitious Intertect, but it was maintained throughout the series.)

The first season of Mannix is a lot different than the more familiar episodes that began in the second season, when Mannix opened his own agency at 17 Paseo Verde, Los Angeles, California. It was in the second season that the brilliant actress Gail Fisher was brought on board as Mannix's devoted secretary, Peggy Fair, whose cop-husband was killed in line of duty.

In the first season, Mannix is not on his own but is employed by an agency that tries to solve crimes using computers. It's great to see what passed for cutting edge technology in the late 1960's. The computers were the old mainframe type, and used punch cards and reel-to-reel tapes, which some younger viewers today may never have ever seen in use. These first season episodes are almost NEVER aired in syndication

All 24 first season episodes will be on this six-disc set with guest stars that epitomized the best of the 1960's including: Kim Hunter, singer Neil Diamond, Tom Skerritt, singers Neil Young and Stephen Stills, Richard Mulligan, Norman Fell, Army Archerd, Rona Barrett, and Karen Black. In addition, the release contains special features that include episode introductions by Golden Globe and Emmy-winning star Connors, along with an interview.

In its eight-year run, Mannix quickly became a TV staple airing on Saturday's at 10 p.m. Not only was it noted for its great writing, acting, unusual camera angles, hot cars and visuals, but also its violence. Mannix was, by one count, shot 17 times and knocked unconscious another 55 during the show's run.

During the first season of the series, Mannix worked for Intertect in large Los Angeles, which was the most high-tech detective agency in the country. His superior was Lew Wickersham, played to perfection by Joseph Campanella. The tension between the two men was entertaining, since Mannix belonged to the classic hard-boiled school of American detectives (hard drinking, womanizing but compassionate, and always quick to action.) Mannix generally ignored the computers' solutions, disobeyed Wickersham and did things his own way.

Connors incorporated his own Armenian heritage into his character. Viewers were treated to a host of great Armenian proverbs Mannix shared at some of the most interesting and unexpected times. A Korean War Army veteran, Mannix also seemed to struggle with unspoken demons from that experiences.

From the second season on, Mannix worked on his own with the assistance Peggy Fair. (Fisher was one of the first African-American actresses to have a regular series role on TV. Later in the series, the producers even considered a romantic relationship between the two, but feared it was too controversial for the time. Nonetheless, the chemistry between the two is unmistakable). He also had assistance from the police department, the two most frequently depicted were Lt. Adam Tobias (portrayed by Robert Reed) and later Lt. Art Malcolm (portrayed by Ward Wood). Other police contacts were Lt. George Kramer (Larry Linville) and Lt. Dan Ives (Jack Ging).

The series was also memorable for its cool cars, primarily convertibles, that Mannix drove. In Season 1, he drove a customized Oldsmobile Toronado convertible (Oldsmobile never produced  a convertible in that model for sale); in Seasons 2-3, he drove a Dodge Dart GTS 340 convertible; in Seasons 4-6, he drove a Plymouth Barracuda convertible; in Season 7, he drove a Dodge Challenger Coupe; and in Season 8, he drove a Chevrolet Camaro LT.

Included in this DVD set is the pilot, The Name is Mannix, which truly sets the tone for the whole series. In it, maverick private-eye Mannix tries to rescue the kidnaped daughter of former rackets' boss, Sam Dubrio. Mannix bets he can get the girl back, if he can persuade her father to risk the half-million dollar ransom plus another half-million dollars to bribe the kidnapers' pickup man.

The other episodes here from the first season are: The Cost of a Vacation; Skid Marks on a Dry Run; Then the Drink Takes the Man; The Many Deaths of Saint Christopher; Make It Like It Never Happened; License to Kill, Limit Three People; Beyond the Shadow of a Dream; Warning: Live Blueberries; Turn Every Stone; Huntdown; Coffin for a Clown; A Catalogue of Sins; Run Sheep, Run; Falling Star; To Kill a Writer; Deadfall Part 1; Deadfall Part 2; You Can Get Killed Out There; Another Final Exit; Eight to Five, It's a Miracle; Delayed Action; and The Girl in the Frame.",1203724800,159,6368,5.044719314938154

Good action and plots. If you had to consider which season to buy first, I went with this not because it was first but I liked the format better. The scenes of Mannix detecting and his boss and staff occasionally being of help (while arguing), seemed to make the story better paced and more lively. Mike passed away a few days ago at 91 from complications due to battling leukemia. I'm glad he lived a long life but sad his end was not a peaceful one.",1486771200,2,671,4.553719008264463

i was about 8 when this came out but i remember watching Mannix as a kid but i don't
remember many episodes except for the pilot. This season has him working for a BIG
PI agency instead of a PI on his own as his was in later seasons. I love his original car
which is not the same he used later on when he had his own detective agency. Of course
like most sitcoms this one got better as Connors got more into the character but he was
always a cool actor. The stories are not the cookie cutter detective series like most of
the time and Mannix had some good writers and directors kept them interesting. If you

Massively successful with Mission Impossible, executive producer Bruce Geller developed Mannix, but after a rocky first season, the show was on the chopping block.  Luckily with some support from Desilu CEO Lucille Ball, Mannix underwent a major makeover for season two, and became a primetime hit.

Handsome and athletic, Mike Connors played the iconic private detective Joe Mannix for eight seasons, however up until this DVD release, the initial season (1967-68), the only one to feature Mannix as an employee of Intertect, a detective agency based in Los Angeles, was mostly forgotten, as these 24 episodes were apparently never rebroadcast, when the program went into syndication.

 The initial premise was to have Mannix operating in the field, supported by the staff, computers, and resources of Intertect.  While this concept had some potential, for the most part, the stories lack substance and sophistication, and do little to realize that potential, as Mannix had little faith in computers.  Except for a car phone in his convertible, he did not rely on technology or gadgets very much, preferring instead to use his fists, or gun.  A cool and competent operative, violence is usually the first option for the quick on the draw Mannix, who wounds or kills repeatedly, with few apparent repercussions.  Emphasizing gratuitous violence, the episodes are typically filled with confrontations, fights, shootouts, beatings, wild pursuits, explosions, car chases, and people getting bashed on the head.

While the show may have had high brow aspirations, in execution it was mostly about cartoonish violence.  He's not quite in the stuntman class like Robert Conrad on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Wild-West/dp/B001CQONOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Wild West</a>, but Mike Connors was very fit, and does a fine job with action scenes.  Connors is also a pretty good actor, but with writing that seldom deals with credible scenarios, and lots of cheesy dialog, he doesn't get many chances to display his true talents, as Mannix lives in a violent fantasy world, where people with guns seem to be everywhere, along with a steady stream of dead bodies.

Although they sometimes clash, Joe Mannix has a solid relationship with his boss Lew Wickersham (Joseph Campenella), who mostly gives Mannix a free hand, while primarily playing an administrative role.  There are some well-written stories, and the series greatly benefits from a top flight list of guest stars, but the writing is far from understated, and the blatant glorification of violence, can become too predictable, and even boring after a while.  Character development for Joe Mannix is pretty minimal, and often leading with his chin with fists clenched, he doesn't come across as the most compassionate guy.  Jim Rockford, he most certainly is not.

Thanks to Lalo Schifrin, who composed the Mission Impossible theme, and others, the music in the series is a major factor, with cues that are very reminiscent of Mission Impossible.  The episodes in the six DVD set look very good, although lacking subtitles.  There are some nice bonus features, including a couple of interview segments with Mike Connors and Joe Campenella, who also provide a commentary on one episode.

Starting in the second season Mannix would operate his own business, with the lovely Gail Fisher as his loyal secretary Peggy, a role Fisher would win an Emmy for.  Had these changes not been made, it is doubtful that Mannix would have lasted for eight seasons.  For fans of the series, the aberrant first season is worth a look, if only for its historic value.  While Connors is somewhat interesting to watch, as a dynamic man of action, with a sky high body count, Mannix often has all the subtlety and charm, of a blow to the head with a blunt instrument.  Fortunately, with improved writing, Mannix's revamped format proved to be a winner, as the character would develop more of a personality.",1372896000,,4479,5.621099554234769

This is the first season of Mannix from 1967-1968. For some reason, the first season of Mannix was never shown in syndication. The first season of Mannix feels like hearing about your father's adventures when he was ten years of age. In the first season, there's a high tech company known as Intertect and its director Lew Wickersham(Joseph Campanella) uses computers to solve crimes. Korean War veteran Joe Mannix uses old fashioned means to bring criminals to justice. Punch cards and reel-to-reel tape recorders were state of the art computer technology in 1967. This was before Steve Jobs and Bill Gates' era. Mannix pokes fun of Wickersham for spying on employees. Mannix is considered one of the first ""violent"" shows on TV. The bad guys would beat up Mannix or shoot him!
There's some solid action scenes and car chases. In the pilot, a guy flying a helicopter tries to kill Mannix a la From Russia With Love(1963) and North by Northwest(1959)! Lalo Schifrin's jazz-waltz Mannix theme music was cool! Everytime I hear it, I can feel my adrenaline pump! Everyone from Kim Hunter to John Colicos to Leslie Parrish to Walter Koenig guest starred on the first season of Mannix. CBS/Paramount did a good job cleaning up the video and audio quality on the DVD's. There's a few extra features as well. This Mannix DVD set is worth the money.",1307836800,2,1666,4.869718309859155

This was my favorite TV series other than ""Hawaii Five-O"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", when I was a kid. ""Mannix"", starring Mike Connors and Joseph Campanella, used to come on Sunday evenings after the ""Wonderful World of Disney"". I always knew when it was coming on because of that really cool and distinctive theme done by Lalo Schifrin. If you recall, Schifrin did a lot of music for Movies and TV shows back in the day; ""Dirty Harry"" comes to mind.  Anyway, this is probably one of the best, if not the best, private eye show going even by todays standards. The action, stunts, graphics, and film quality rival some of the shows on TV today.  Each show in the series is an hour long episode with some in two parts. (more bang for your entertainment buck) This series is Excellent, Excellent, Excellent and comes highly recommended by this viewer.",1252800000,2,972,4.61271676300578

Produced at the same time as classic Trek, by the same studio and overseen by some of the same production and casting people, many familiar Trek guest stars and two Trek regulars pop up in these 24 episodes.  I hesitate to be more specific lest I ruin the wonderful surprises that await you.  Columbo fans will also gain considerable insight from the audio commentary that accompanies the pilot, where the conversation seems to be more about the rumpled detective in the trenchcoat than the combustable Mannix.  This release is VERY highly recommended!",1232409600,,718,4.72
3131524,5,B0014FAIVG,"The only things I would have changed about this DVD set are, (1) the audio introduction by Mike Connors are a great thing, but when playing the shows I had wished there was an option to turn them off because they play before the start of every episode (unless you're using the ""play all"" feature). I haven't seen these episodes in a long time, so they were all like new to me... I didn't want anything spoiled for me before the episode began. However, they are easily skipped, you just have to be ready on the remote button to start the episode from the intro screen. (2) I would've liked to have had even more special feature material, such as interviews and ""making of"" stuff. I know a lot of folks don't appreciate that sort of thing, but I'm one that eats it up.

But these are rather nit-picky points. The DVD set is great, and the series is even better than I remembered it. I've already ordered Season 2.",1227484800,,911,4.358823529411764

3131526,3,B0014FAIVG,"""Mannix"" has an impressive pedigree, having been created by Bruce Geller (Mission: Impossible) and Richard Levinson and William Link (Columbo) who were among the most original minds in television.  The series was one of the most popular detective series of all times, appearing for seven seasons and Mike Connors earned a repuation as a fine actor. Thus I was surprised to find that this first season left a lot to be desired, in terms of quality.  All sucessful series have to work out a lot of kinks in their first episodes, but this first season of ""Mannix"" had quite a few poor episodes.  I think this was due to the unsuccessful tie-in with the ""INTERTECT"" angle, a high-tech crime-solving corporation headed by an egg-head, played by Joe Campanella.  Over and over we see his character peeking into Mannix's office using a closed-circuit television system (I think that may be illegal, how many workers would want their bosses spying on them?).  Campanella always has a bemused, exasperated look as if thinking to himself ""what am I going to do with this guy...he is so unorthodox, yet I can't get by without him!"". After the first several dozen times we see this, it gets tiresome.  Also, part of the charm of private detective stories is the sleuthing the PI's do in order to come up with clues. Here it seems INTERTECT and its army of egg-head intellectuals and their computers seem to be able to spew out mountains of information about every person in the United States, if not the world, making Mannix's job too easy.
In the early shows we see poor acting on the part of numerous supporting characters and an episode where Mannix's foot is injured, yet manages to gimp aroudn for  miles and miles around a rural town without a car. He is even chased by tractors and manages to survive.
A couple of interesting things we see in these early episodes is a cameo appearance by producer Bruce Geller playing a movie director, who might have been very talented as a creative person, but certainly was no actor. We also have a scene where Mannix gets to speak Armenian.
I must admit that as the season wore on the quality did improve and part of the reason was that we saw less of INTERTECT and Joe Campanella stopped showing up miraculously when Mannix was in deep trouble.  The dialogue also improved and became more Raymond Chanlerish with interesting quips commenting on life, the world and human nature.
Maybe it would be worthwhile for someone who is not sure whether they want to see this series to start with the second season, where he becomes a more convention PI with his own office and secretary.",1225152000,10,2612,4.700218818380744
3131527,5,B0014FAIVG,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the  DVD.
My recollection of the 60's detective show was far different from what I watched recently. It was so good that I would recommend it even for younger people who want a quality show with none of the modern morality concerns. The writting, acting and directing are superb.

You'll catch a few blemishes (scratches) from the original films, but overall the colors pop and the images are crystal clear...I only wish everything was done this well.

Thank you for doing such a great job. The transfer is beautiful, colors crisp, edges sharp, sounds great and the extras are a nice sign of care and respect. Now the show: I almost didn't buy this, thinking the first season might be a little stodgy, compared to the looser later seasons. Thankfully, I picked it up and have been watching it obsessively ever since. Mike Connors is so good, it's easy to see why this was so popular. His line readings are HIP, he looks convincing in the fight scenes and when he puts the moves on a lady you don't think she's responding just cuz he's the star. Wonderful music, great direction, inventive action and a lead who is consistently fun to watch and cool as hell! A great show which actually gets better once they leave Intertect behind next season.

3131561,5,B0014FAIVG,"WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME! Mannix was the coolest, sexiest private eye on TV! I really want Season Two because Peggy comes onboard. Gail Fisher was the First African American to win a prime time dramatic Emmy. The romantic chemistry between those two was undeniable although it would never develop because of the times, but it was there all right. My Favorite episode was when Mannix went blind in Season 3...chemistry through the roof! TRIVIA: On the TV show Diagnosis Murder (Dick Van Dyke's show) Mannix made a guest appearance. Van Dyke asked about Peggy and Mannix said ""She's on vacation"" and Van Dyke says ""Well why don't you join her?"", cementing (at least in my mind) what some or all of us wanted to know about their relationship. In the meantime I will be enjoying this classy blast from the past...Season One. SEASON TWO AND SUBSEQUENT SEASONS... HURRY UP AND GET HERE!!",1220659200,3,878,4.782894736842105
3131562,5,B0014FAIVG,"While growing up, Mannix was one of my favorite detective shows.  This show had it all, decent writing, good stunts (with lots of old time fisticuffs--I had forgotten how often poor Joe's melon was pistol- whipped--ah, the life of a private eye), and good acting by Mike Connors (who I think actually looks like a private eye), Joseph Campanella, and as I recall in the following seasons by Gail Fisher and Robert Reed.  Because of the quality of the show and the large number of episodes, I had been stumped as to why the show took so long to materialize on the DVD market. But hey, good things are worth waiting for and Mannix is one.  I read a Mike Connors interview in the Washington Post a year or so ago and even he was mystified by the slow move to DVD.  I had forgotten most all the episodes from that first year so watching them was like seeing them for the first time.  I found myself getting tense watching many of the shows, wondering how Joe would escape, but he always did--of course with a few bumps and bruises and occasional flesh wound.  He even did one episode in a leg cast (was it a real injury from a stunt, which he did himsef?).  The DVD also includes an interesting interview with Mike Connors and Joseph Campanella (both still look great!) and intros for each episode by Mike Connors.  For the price, you get the entire first season, which is a good deal (many only give you half a season).  Now, bring on the other 6 seasons!",1220054400,4,1452,4.388059701492537
3131563,5,B0014FAIVG,"I rarely give five stars to an older TV show. Especially, since I have a guilty pleasure of buying 60's and 70's shows from my childhood just to peak back at what I was watching then. Mostly after season or rarely two, I've satified my curiousity and move on. When I bought Mannix season 1, I was primarily fueled by combination of having it on my list for long time and not seeing any espisodes for at least twenty years.

As Gomer Pyle would say, ""Surprise Surprise Surpise!"" I've viewed about 15 episodes over the last few weeks and so far, I've enjoyed each one not just for the memories, but for qualities and uniqueness of the show. Like a lot people, I had never seen season 1 originally, and CBS never repeated them after season 1 because of the storyline change. Mike Conners plays the rogue detective with a genuine warts and all quality that is engaging and different than the standard detective faire of the day. He's totally politically incorrect - a product of all the social norms of the post WWII era. Yet his sense of his own moral code and his rebuke of simply being another cog in the interact agency wheel, have almost a counterculture quality to them - he both represents 'the man' and yet fights the rules, structure and authority figures at the same time. Joesph C. in his one season role as his boss does a really nice job, but as Mannix evolves, no boss can hold him down (bye Joe).

The quality of the prints, writing , directing, etc has already been praised enough in the other reviews. I agree with them.

One element I found personally interesting, was the highly praised opening title sequence. I think I started watching the show as a child in season 2 or 3, and always wondered where all the show images came from in the title - now I know, Season 1.

Simply put, it you want a highly quality example of a 60s/70s detective show that still will hold your interest today...we have one man available.....Mannix!",1219190400,4,1942,4.492917847025495

Otherwise, this is a great DVD release and a welcome sight among all the junk that routinely clogs up the DVD racks. It is a viewing treat to see a classic like Mannix.

This show has it all - great writing, fantastic acting including a Who's Who of guest stars, superb score from Lalo Schifrin, directing and camera work that is a cut above. Oh, and by the way, that reputation for violence...very much undeserved but unfortunatly it has been repeated so much over the years that it might as well be engraved in stone.

I just finished the first season of MANNIX.  I remember this show  as a kid and my mothers affection for the star Mike Connors.  Besides perhaps the best theme song in tv history this  show still packs a punch and tons of fun. Its fun seeing Los Angeles when there were still vacant lots and its fun seeing  Neil  Diamond when he was still an artist....oh and Stephen Stills singing in hippy night clubs.  Its fun to see future more well  known actors in small side rolls. Its  fun to see 60s gals in mini skirts and boots and its fun  to watch a ton of gunplay in every episode! Nevermind the  curious lack of Police in  town or other plot holes...this was a very very well  made show...with high production  values ,  excellent cinematography and shot on film so it  looks better than most all the 80-90's  video  shows!

The first season is awesome, with a great theme and crazy fashions.  When you look back at the series you note some of the things that the new shows like CSI and others are carrying now.  Joe is of course the king of cool, by taking on cases that his boss (Lou) doesn't believe the firm should be involved with due to not fitting the computer's profile. Imagine that ""profiling"" in the late seventies. Needless to say the show really picked up when Joe went ""inde"" and Gail Fisher was added. The first season stands on it's own merits and set the standard for one man ""team"" was able to right the wrongs and stand up for justice.  Checking out that big Oldsmobile (which appears to be a company car - Lou drives one also), you just have to wonder what the gas would cost today.  The thing that I (and others) will always remember about Mannix is he could take a good beating - he got one in every episode.  Finally, Mike Connors (the guy who was there from the start) giving us an intro into each episode is way cool.  If you don't own it, get it.  When you do get it, notice the (what was then) innovations for TV detective shows - such as computers, mobile rotary phones, etc.  Mannix the spice of the seventies.",1216339200,4,1341,4.349397590361446

3131609,5,B0014FAIVG,"The first season of TV's ""Mannix"" (1967-68) is a detective show that was several notches above the rest. To begin with, it's cool, like Steve McQueen-meets-noir cool, with a taciturn, Chandler-esque hero Joe Mannix (played by Mike Connors) who takes threats, setbacks and violence in his stride.  Mannix doesn't mind taking a few knocks if he can crack the case and get his licks in at the end. He's also an old-school crime-buster at odds with the modern methods of the gigantic company he works for (Intertect) -- instead of relying on computers, high technology and space-age science, Mannix prefers to use shoe leather, bare knuckles and moxie.

Very hip for its time, the show was also very stylish and surprisingly experimental, full of wild, artsy, almost avant garde camera work, and sleek scripts that didn't rely too heavily on explanation and exposition, as did many TV shows of the era.  The list of guests stars in this first season is impressive as well, including great character actors and A-listers such as Neil Diamond, Karen Black and Rona Barrett. A fresh-faced, clean-shaven kid named Tom Skerritt shows up in the same episode that features the soon-to-be-legendary psychedelic band Buffalo Springfield (featuring Stephen Stills and Neil Young) as the house band of a seedy Sunset Strip go-go club. It's a very ""Sixties"" show, in the best meaning of the word -- folks who enjoy James Bond movies, Steve McQueen, or even ""The Avengers"", will find a lot to cheer about here.

Plus, this was back in the day when TV studios still knew how to program a real *season* of entertainment: with 24 full episodes, this 6-disc set will keep you on the edge of your couch for many, many nights to come.

3131611,5,B0014FAIVG,"I grew up on Mike Connors' engagingly physical gumshoe, and I always felt Season One was the best of the series, so I have been walking on clouds since my copy of ""Mannix - The First Season"" arrived!

Digitally remastered, with audio introductions by Mike Connors, himself, the 'Bogart Meets Hi-Tech' adventures of Joe Mannix of Intertect (an idea WAY ahead of it's time, in 1967) combines the un-P.C. attitudes of the era (everybody smokes relentlessly, women are often mini-skirted window dressing, and the standard solution to problems is a right to the jaw or a bullet), with a growing awareness of changing times (counterculture is a theme of one episode, Buffalo Springfield and Neil Diamond perform, and racism is addressed, by no less than Roscoe Lee Browne). Co-starring with Connors is the wonderful Joseph Campanella, as Intertect chief 'Lew Wickersham', based on Lew Wasserman, of MCA. The exchanges between 'by-the-book' Wickersham and 'what the...' Mannix are often as much fun as the episodes, themselves!

Best of all, the Special Features actually ARE special...For this package, CBS brought back Connors (a chubby, cherubic 82), and Campanella (a razor-thin 74), for a two-part interview, to reminisce about the creation of the show, the physical hardships Connors endured, and the camaraderie of cast and crew. While a voice-over commentary for the pilot, by co-creator William Link, is silly (the concept was completely rewritten by producer Bruce Geller prior to filming, and Link knew nothing about the episode!), he does reveal that originally, Mannix's first name would never be revealed (CBS nixed this, but Link would use the idea, again, in his next series...""Columbo"").

More treats are included on each disc, my favorites being TV-Land's ad for the series, focusing on Mannix's frequent pistol-whippings and shoulder wounds, a 70's ""Mike Douglas"" appearance, where Connors discusses his Armenian heritage, and TRIES to play a flute, and, especially, a brief clip from a 1997 ""Diagnosis: Murder"" episode, filmed as a sequel to a 24-year-old ""Mannix"" episode, with the 72-year-old detective still tackling cases!

Oh, heck, I could talk for hours about how GREAT ""Mannix - The First Season"" is...Just buy it, and see if you don't agree!",1213056000,39,2263,5.2430939226519335
3131612,5,B0014FAIVG,"Thanks to Mike Connors for his role in Mannix. Thanks to CBS/Paramount for the packaging and special features, and thanks to Amazon for great price and service!! This DVD is one of the most enjoyable ones to watch. Anytime that you get part of the cast together to ""look back"" and talk about the memories, it is the best. Special features like this are what makes owning the DVD's worthwhile. Mike Connors does a terrific job with all of the audio intros to the episodes, just like Robert Conrad did for the 1st season of Wild Wild West. I wonder why Robert Conrad wasn't able to provide more audio intros or interviews for the remaining seasons? Hopefully, the special features like these will be continued if season 2 of Mannix becomes available (hint, hint). The video quality is stunning. I'm always amazed how the editing experts can take a 40yr old show and make it look so good! As Mike Connors stated, for some reason the 1st season of Mannix really never aired in syndication, even on TV Land. So, this makes for a real treat for us die hard Mannix fans who have never seen these episodes before, so enjoy!

3131613,5,B0014FAIVG,"It seems that many television series that originated in the 1960s were better known for their theme music than the actual program itself. One of my favorite themes was that of The Avengers, but I also tended to fall asleep half-way through a typical episode. Mannix was one of the happy exceptions. The exciting opening credits only led to more thrills.  Yes, it was violent; rarely did five minutes pass without Mannix mixing it up with the bad guys with his fists or gun. But it wasn't as gratuitous as it might have seemed; Mannix's sharp, wise-guy wit often got him into trouble with the wrong people--and made him the likeable rogue that fans became attached to.

  The first season of Mannix was rarely seen in syndication, but beyond the differing context, the character was little changed. I watched all 24 episodes over six days, and Mannix never missed a beat. It took too long for this series to make it to DVD; let's hope that the subsequent seasons follow soon.",1213056000,5,974,4.678362573099415
3131614,5,B0014FAIVG,"Dig this... the Mannix Season 1 Collection DVD? Pretty cool.

*  Solid writing -- yeah, there are bummers -- but on the whole they were lotsa fun
*  Sunny California color -- not like today's grayish programs -- but it ain't as garish as some of the shows back then were
*  Hey! These episodes are 50 minutes long!! And there ain't no commercials!
*  The Man hisself, Mike Connors, his voice still carrying strong despite his being 80 some'um, gives a brief audio-only intro to each and every episode

The ain't-so-cool ""Special features"" include...

*  A brief reminiscing by Mike Connors and Joseph Campanella. This was split into two short parts to spread over two DVDs. These two 80-some'ums, 40 years later, were a little vague but their fondness for each other and the show seemed genuine. They were a little vague in the episode commentary they did, too.
*  A brief appearance by Mike Connors on the Mike Douglas show way back when. This is my favorite of the special features cuz it was fun and as informative as the time allowed.
*  Some CBS promos -- cheap ways to fill out a DVD -- and seldom interesting after the series has been seen
*  And, with the pilot episode, the worstest commentary ever done -- by co-creator William Link -- cuz he never spoke about the episode we were watching except for about 2 minutes in all. In fact, he spent most of the time talking about another of his creations, COLUMBO, and its star, Peter Falk.

To be frank, I didn't remember the first season very well and expected these episodes -- when Mannix was stuck in a computerized detective agency -- to be boring. Couldn't have been more wrong. It was FUN thanks to the writing and, particularly, to the amiable Mike Connor screen presence. Oh... and for the very pretty young chicks -- I mean, actresses -- in miniskirts! (I feel faint.) My favorite has to be Marlyn Mason (pre-LONGSTREET) who is not only very yummy but a mean comedienne, too.",1213056000,11,1940,4.5590778097982705

So they weren't cut up for added commercial time.  The episodes are facinating to see since these 24 episodes minus the pilot haven't been in syndication in my lifetime (30 years).

3131637,4,B0014FAIVG,"I just watched the 50+ minute PILOT show, 25 minutes of story, 10 minutes of tram rides up & down a mountain & 15 minutes of helicopter chases.  I found myself fast-forwarding through the second half.  Add to that poor acting by the guest stars and it was hard for me to give this four stars.  I gave this rating just because this long lost first season has finally seen the light of a TV screen since it's first broadcast 40 years ago.

Picture quality looks clean & sharp, but does not match a theatrical movie of that time.
The Mono Audio is clear & free of noise.

VERY 1960's!  The key-punch card in the titles is just as I remember it!  And the kids nightclub fashions!  I forgot how ""hip"" this show tried to be!

The new interviews with Mike Connors & Joseph Campanella are a bit disappointing. Their age is showing & their memories a little foggy.  As Mike Connors says ""All I remember about the first season is the pilot, but that was 40 years ago!""  Both have trouble speaking, they have slowed down quite a bit with age. Mike has lost that square-jaw appearance & is almost unrecognizable.

A more enjoyable interview is the clip from the Mike Douglas Show, Mike Connors relates some on-the-set stories that are clear in his mind. Unfortunately the beginning of the clip is missing.  Apparently Mike Connors tried to sing a song, but I guess music rights have kept that off of the DVD.  This attempt to sing is mentioned several times in the clip, adding to the frustration.  Some attempts by Mike Connors to joke with Marty Feldman fall flat.  The clip itself is soft as if it was mastered from a U-Matic or  inch copy, rather than the 2 inch master tape.  There is also some drop out.  BUT this might be all that exists as tapes were expensive & often erased for re-use.

There is a badly faded, soft focus CBS fall 1967 promo reel that basically highlights the pilot show.  After watching the pilot, this was hard to sit through.

Other bonuses on this set do not pertain to season 1 and should have been held for the season 2 DVD release (hopeful thinking).
There is a syndication promo reel used to sell the series to TV stations for re-runs. Since season 1 was never syndicated it only uses scenes form the later 'private eye' version of the series, with clips of Peggy.
There is also a clever TV LAND promo poking fun at the fact Mannix rarely gets shot.  Again these clips are not from the first season.

A clip of the Mannix appearance on Diagnosis Murder is only about 5 minutes, just enough to tease you into buying that series to see the rest of the episode.  The quality of the clip is surprisingly soft.

The bonus material is spread out over the 6 discs, filling up what little extra space there is on them.

A top notch DVD with some fun bonus material.  CBS / Paramount seem to have gotten their act together to give us more than the old bare-bones TV-on-DVD sets.",1211846400,5,2892,4.40566037735849

The special features are good, but there can never really be enough or too many as far as I'm concerned, so lets hope for some more in season 2. The interviews are a pleasure to see.

Just on production values, mind you, Law & Order looks like Cleopatra or Lord of the Rings next to this.

Walls always shook when doors were slammed which was one of the major action tropes the show offered. Also, for action-packed fun: Mannix running up stairs, Mannix running up stairs with his gun drawn, Mannix getting winged with a bullet.

3131642,5,B0014FAIVG,"The 194 one-hour episodes (all in color) of detective drama ""Mannix"" originally aired on CBS from 1967-1975.  It was a slick series, uncharacteristically violent (at least by television standards) with decent enough scripting so that there was generally logic involved in all the storylines.

Mike Conners (one of my fraternity brothers) played the title character, a maverick private eye who starts out (Season One) as a loner within ""Intertect"" a large detective agency.  It was intended by its creators (Richard Levinson and William Link-see ""Columbo"") to be a man vs technology statement.

In Season One Mannix is in constant conflict with his boss Lou Wickersham (Joseph Campanella).  Lou has invested big bucks in a computer system, the latest electronic technology, and assorted scientific detection gadgets; and these are central to the way he is marketing the agency's services.  Mannix is an old fashion gumshoe, solving cases by hard work and instinct.  Their confrontations may remind you a similar dynamic on ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"".

After its first year ""Mannix"" became a conflicted series.  The title character was a reprise of the Nick Stone character Conners played in the police drama ""Tightrope"" (1959-60 also on CBS).  Stone and Mannix are no-frills film noir style grunts, coming out of most confrontations a bit the worse for the wear.  But once the producers of ""Mannix"" saw the success of ""Bullitt"" (1968) they began to pack the series with car chases and outfit their otherwise grim gumshoe with a succession of ""Munsters"" inspired exotic automobiles.  Can you say incongruity?

But that should not concern those about to view the Season One DVD set.  Speaking of incongruity,  the later seasons' content and style seems mismatched with the boxy split screen title graphics.  These were a carry over from Season One where they were meant to reflect the computer and technology themes.  I liked them even though they seemed out of place in subsequent seasons.  I also liked the catchy theme music by Lalo Schifrin who did the theme for ""Mission Impossible"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1204588800,19,2135,5.115606936416185

My guess is, we are going to be getting the syndicated versions of each one...the butchered versions that were cut down by several minutes to allow for more commercials... and that really sucks.

But I can't say I'm surprised.  When ""vintage"" shows like MANNIX finally arrive on DVD, they aren't considered important enough for the studio to expend much effort on.  Consequently, nobody bothers looking for the old, uncut episodes; instead they settle for the more readily available bastardized ones.  Like I said, a real shame.",1204588800,4,641,4.898148148148148
3131644,4,B0014FAIVG,"It's a long time in coming, but Mannix is finally on DVD. The first season of Mannix (1967-68 season)---when he worked for the Intertect Detective Agency--has never been in syndication and consequently--these episodes haven't been seen in over 40 years. For it's time, the first season was considered violent and gritty (truly ""neo-noir"")---in fact the promos advertised Mannix as working with ""a hunch and a punch"".

In the wake of Bobby Kennedy's assassination in June of 1968, the FCC asked all three networks to tone down the violence in their TV shows--and Mannix was the most violent of it's time.  But also in retrospect the original format of the show--with Mannix working for a large firm but constantly defying his boss Lew Wickersham and using old fashion legwork in place of the firm's computers--- just was not sustainable in the long run. And thus, for the rest of the series, Mannix worked on his own.  Still, Paramount and CBS did a great job in restoring each episode and they all look and sound great (just compare to some of the bootleg DVDs out there).

As an added bonus, Lalo Schifrin composed the theme song and the music tracks for a number of the episodes.

There are plenty of forgettable series on DVD and that Mannix has been denied to a generation of TV viewers (not to mention we Boomers who loved the show from Day One) is really too bad.
Mannix was cool for several reasons.
The cars. No matter the season, Joe Mannix had the coolest cars. From the custom Toronado convertible in the first season, to the Dart GTS to the Barracudas in later seasons, Joe's cars were always the best. Hi s cars were always customized by the great George Barris. And he had a phone! How cool was that back then?
The Music! Jaxx great Lalo Shiffrin wrote the title theme as well as much of the incidental music. The Mannix soundtrack was a strong blend of crime jazz and edgy late 60's funk. Joe and his loyal sidekick and secretary, Peggy Fair, would show up in a jazz bar on many occasions. Many music greats of the era popped up whether as themselves or as a character (Neil Diamond and Lou Rawls for starters).
The guest stars - Everyone wanted to do a Mannix gig. Check IMDB for a list - it's a who's who of Hollywood in the 1970s. Everyone from new faces trying to make it (Diane Keaton) to older actors who were on their way down (but not out) are there.
The clothes - Joe sported a series of wild plaid sports coats over the years. In the 70's those tweedy plaids with the wide lapels were the rage - and check out those linings! Peggy was always smartly dressed as well.
Heck, I could go on and on. Suffice to say that Mannix was the classiest detective drama of the era. It got a bad rap for violence, but the violence then was hardly even a tenth of what you see today. For kids growing up in the 70's the violence and gritty drama were a view to another world outside our tidy suburban homes. And it was never gratuitous.
It's here folks. Order one, order more! They make great gifts! And the more we fans order, the more likely we are to see the rest of the seasons released - some of which haven't been seen since they aired on TV back in the 1970's.",1204243200,19,2251,4.286384976525822

But he endured for eight seasons.

While Mannix is best remember for his cool house, office, and girl Friday Peggy Fair, the first season of the show saw Mannix work not for himself, but a detective agency that used the first type of computers to solve crimes, and Mannix was seen as a dinosaur who was doing things the old fashioned way. Of course, the old street-smart dinosaur was the one solving the crimes for his boss, played by Joesph Campanella.

3365915,5,B0014FAIVG,"Finally, FINALLY, the very best Classic TV detective series EVER produced comes to DVD in a first-season set. For its legion of fans, it is a huge understatement to say this release is eagerly anticipated. Thanks to CBS/Parmount for putting this series out on DVD. Let's hope the remaining seasons quickly follow.

Mannix ran from 1967 through 1975 on CBS. Created by Richard Levinson and William Link and developed by executive producer Bruce Geller (who also created Mission: Impossible), the title character, Joe Mannix, is a two-fisted private investigator portrayed by Mike Connors.

Rarely has an actor so inhabited a TV character that it's impossible to separate the two. This series represents one of those times, and even the show's producers recognized it when the unusual credit proclaimed: Mike Connors IS Mannix. The ruggedly handsome Connors was the perfect match, and made the signature loud sports jackets of the time look great on his altar ego. Mannix also drove a variety of convertibles, and even had a car phone - which was unheard of at the time!

Mannix originally worked for a high-concept computerized firm known as Intertect in the rarely seen first season. This DVD set represents all of those episodes, including the series' pilot.

Mannix featured a dynamic split-screen opening credits sequence set to its theme music from noted composer Lalo Schifrin. Unusual for a private detective series, the Mannix theme is in triple time, the same signature used for a waltz.

(FYI: The show's title, opening credits and closing credits are in variations of ""City Typeface,"" a distinctive, squared-off, split-serif face that has long been used by IBM Corporation as part of their corporate design, and continues to be used in its logo today. The use of this style of credits for Mannix spelled out his name as if on computer punch cards utilized by fictitious Intertect, but it was maintained throughout the series.)

The first season of Mannix is a lot different than the more familiar episodes that began in the second season, when Mannix opened his own agency at 17 Paseo Verde, Los Angeles, California. It was in the second season that the brilliant actress Gail Fisher was brought on board as Mannix's devoted secretary, Peggy Fair, whose cop-husband was killed in line of duty.

In the first season, Mannix is not on his own but is employed by an agency that tries to solve crimes using computers. It's great to see what passed for cutting edge technology in the late 1960's. The computers were the old mainframe type, and used punch cards and reel-to-reel tapes, which some younger viewers today may never have ever seen in use. These first season episodes are almost NEVER aired in syndication

All 24 first season episodes will be on this six-disc set with guest stars that epitomized the best of the 1960's including: Kim Hunter, singer Neil Diamond, Tom Skerritt, singers Neil Young and Stephen Stills, Richard Mulligan, Norman Fell, Army Archerd, Rona Barrett, and Karen Black. In addition, the release contains special features that include episode introductions by Golden Globe and Emmy-winning star Connors, along with an interview.

In its eight-year run, Mannix quickly became a TV staple airing on Saturday's at 10 p.m. Not only was it noted for its great writing, acting, unusual camera angles, hot cars and visuals, but also its violence. Mannix was, by one count, shot 17 times and knocked unconscious another 55 during the show's run.

During the first season of the series, Mannix worked for Intertect in large Los Angeles, which was the most high-tech detective agency in the country. His superior was Lew Wickersham, played to perfection by Joseph Campanella. The tension between the two men was entertaining, since Mannix belonged to the classic hard-boiled school of American detectives (hard drinking, womanizing but compassionate, and always quick to action.) Mannix generally ignored the computers' solutions, disobeyed Wickersham and did things his own way.

Connors incorporated his own Armenian heritage into his character. Viewers were treated to a host of great Armenian proverbs Mannix shared at some of the most interesting and unexpected times. A Korean War Army veteran, Mannix also seemed to struggle with unspoken demons from that experiences.

From the second season on, Mannix worked on his own with the assistance Peggy Fair. (Fisher was one of the first African-American actresses to have a regular series role on TV. Later in the series, the producers even considered a romantic relationship between the two, but feared it was too controversial for the time. Nonetheless, the chemistry between the two is unmistakable). He also had assistance from the police department, the two most frequently depicted were Lt. Adam Tobias (portrayed by Robert Reed) and later Lt. Art Malcolm (portrayed by Ward Wood). Other police contacts were Lt. George Kramer (Larry Linville) and Lt. Dan Ives (Jack Ging).

The series was also memorable for its cool cars, primarily convertibles, that Mannix drove. In Season 1, he drove a customized Oldsmobile Toronado convertible (Oldsmobile never produced  a convertible in that model for sale); in Seasons 2-3, he drove a Dodge Dart GTS 340 convertible; in Seasons 4-6, he drove a Plymouth Barracuda convertible; in Season 7, he drove a Dodge Challenger Coupe; and in Season 8, he drove a Chevrolet Camaro LT.

Included in this DVD set is the pilot, The Name is Mannix, which truly sets the tone for the whole series. In it, maverick private-eye Mannix tries to rescue the kidnaped daughter of former rackets' boss, Sam Dubrio. Mannix bets he can get the girl back, if he can persuade her father to risk the half-million dollar ransom plus another half-million dollars to bribe the kidnapers' pickup man.

Good action and plots. If you had to consider which season to buy first, I went with this not because it was first but I liked the format better. The scenes of Mannix detecting and his boss and staff occasionally being of help (while arguing), seemed to make the story better paced and more lively. Mike passed away a few days ago at 91 from complications due to battling leukemia. I'm glad he lived a long life but sad his end was not a peaceful one.",1486771200,2,671,4.553719008264463

remember many episodes except for the pilot. This season has him working for a BIG
PI agency instead of a PI on his own as his was in later seasons. I love his original car
which is not the same he used later on when he had his own detective agency. Of course
like most sitcoms this one got better as Connors got more into the character but he was
always a cool actor. The stories are not the cookie cutter detective series like most of

Massively successful with Mission Impossible, executive producer Bruce Geller developed Mannix, but after a rocky first season, the show was on the chopping block.  Luckily with some support from Desilu CEO Lucille Ball, Mannix underwent a major makeover for season two, and became a primetime hit.

Handsome and athletic, Mike Connors played the iconic private detective Joe Mannix for eight seasons, however up until this DVD release, the initial season (1967-68), the only one to feature Mannix as an employee of Intertect, a detective agency based in Los Angeles, was mostly forgotten, as these 24 episodes were apparently never rebroadcast, when the program went into syndication.

 The initial premise was to have Mannix operating in the field, supported by the staff, computers, and resources of Intertect.  While this concept had some potential, for the most part, the stories lack substance and sophistication, and do little to realize that potential, as Mannix had little faith in computers.  Except for a car phone in his convertible, he did not rely on technology or gadgets very much, preferring instead to use his fists, or gun.  A cool and competent operative, violence is usually the first option for the quick on the draw Mannix, who wounds or kills repeatedly, with few apparent repercussions.  Emphasizing gratuitous violence, the episodes are typically filled with confrontations, fights, shootouts, beatings, wild pursuits, explosions, car chases, and people getting bashed on the head.

While the show may have had high brow aspirations, in execution it was mostly about cartoonish violence.  He's not quite in the stuntman class like Robert Conrad on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Wild-West/dp/B001CQONOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Wild West</a>, but Mike Connors was very fit, and does a fine job with action scenes.  Connors is also a pretty good actor, but with writing that seldom deals with credible scenarios, and lots of cheesy dialog, he doesn't get many chances to display his true talents, as Mannix lives in a violent fantasy world, where people with guns seem to be everywhere, along with a steady stream of dead bodies.

Although they sometimes clash, Joe Mannix has a solid relationship with his boss Lew Wickersham (Joseph Campenella), who mostly gives Mannix a free hand, while primarily playing an administrative role.  There are some well-written stories, and the series greatly benefits from a top flight list of guest stars, but the writing is far from understated, and the blatant glorification of violence, can become too predictable, and even boring after a while.  Character development for Joe Mannix is pretty minimal, and often leading with his chin with fists clenched, he doesn't come across as the most compassionate guy.  Jim Rockford, he most certainly is not.

Thanks to Lalo Schifrin, who composed the Mission Impossible theme, and others, the music in the series is a major factor, with cues that are very reminiscent of Mission Impossible.  The episodes in the six DVD set look very good, although lacking subtitles.  There are some nice bonus features, including a couple of interview segments with Mike Connors and Joe Campenella, who also provide a commentary on one episode.

Starting in the second season Mannix would operate his own business, with the lovely Gail Fisher as his loyal secretary Peggy, a role Fisher would win an Emmy for.  Had these changes not been made, it is doubtful that Mannix would have lasted for eight seasons.  For fans of the series, the aberrant first season is worth a look, if only for its historic value.  While Connors is somewhat interesting to watch, as a dynamic man of action, with a sky high body count, Mannix often has all the subtlety and charm, of a blow to the head with a blunt instrument.  Fortunately, with improved writing, Mannix's revamped format proved to be a winner, as the character would develop more of a personality.",1372896000,,4479,5.621099554234769

3366000,5,B0014FAIVG,"When I was a teenager in the early 1990's, I watched Mannix TV reruns in syndication while my mother worked the graveyard shift at work. Mannix was a simple detective show with Mike Connors as Armenian-American detective Joe Mannix. He had an African-American secretary named Peggy(played by Gail Fisher). Oh, wait a minute! This is the first season of Mannix from 1967-1968. For some reason, the first season of Mannix was never shown in syndication. The first season of Mannix feels like hearing about your father's adventures when he was ten years of age. In the first season, there's a high tech company known as Intertect and its director Lew Wickersham(Joseph Campanella) uses computers to solve crimes. Korean War veteran Joe Mannix uses old fashioned means to bring criminals to justice. Punch cards and reel-to-reel tape recorders were state of the art computer technology in 1967. This was before Steve Jobs and Bill Gates' era. Mannix pokes fun of Wickersham for spying on employees. Mannix is considered one of the first ""violent"" shows on TV. The bad guys would beat up Mannix or shoot him!
There's some solid action scenes and car chases. In the pilot, a guy flying a helicopter tries to kill Mannix a la From Russia With Love(1963) and North by Northwest(1959)! Lalo Schifrin's jazz-waltz Mannix theme music was cool! Everytime I hear it, I can feel my adrenaline pump! Everyone from Kim Hunter to John Colicos to Leslie Parrish to Walter Koenig guest starred on the first season of Mannix. CBS/Paramount did a good job cleaning up the video and audio quality on the DVD's. There's a few extra features as well. This Mannix DVD set is worth the money.",1307836800,2,1666,4.869718309859155

This was my favorite TV series other than ""Hawaii Five-O"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", when I was a kid. ""Mannix"", starring Mike Connors and Joseph Campanella, used to come on Sunday evenings after the ""Wonderful World of Disney"". I always knew when it was coming on because of that really cool and distinctive theme done by Lalo Schifrin. If you recall, Schifrin did a lot of music for Movies and TV shows back in the day; ""Dirty Harry"" comes to mind.  Anyway, this is probably one of the best, if not the best, private eye show going even by todays standards. The action, stunts, graphics, and film quality rival some of the shows on TV today.  Each show in the series is an hour long episode with some in two parts.

Produced at the same time as classic Trek, by the same studio and overseen by some of the same production and casting people, many familiar Trek guest stars and two Trek regulars pop up in these 24 episodes.  I hesitate to be more specific lest I ruin the wonderful surprises that await you.  Columbo fans will also gain considerable insight from the audio commentary that accompanies the pilot, where the conversation seems to be more about the rumpled detective in the trenchcoat than the combustable Mannix.

I haven't seen these episodes in a long time, so they were all like new to me... I didn't want anything spoiled for me before the episode began. However, they are easily skipped, you just have to be ready on the remote button to start the episode from the intro screen. (2) I would've liked to have had even more special feature material, such as interviews and ""making of"" stuff. I know a lot of folks don't appreciate that sort of thing, but I'm one that eats it up.

3366023,3,B0014FAIVG,"""Mannix"" has an impressive pedigree, having been created by Bruce Geller (Mission: Impossible) and Richard Levinson and William Link (Columbo) who were among the most original minds in television.  The series was one of the most popular detective series of all times, appearing for seven seasons and Mike Connors earned a repuation as a fine actor. Thus I was surprised to find that this first season left a lot to be desired, in terms of quality.  All sucessful series have to work out a lot of kinks in their first episodes, but this first season of ""Mannix"" had quite a few poor episodes.  I think this was due to the unsuccessful tie-in with the ""INTERTECT"" angle, a high-tech crime-solving corporation headed by an egg-head, played by Joe Campanella.  Over and over we see his character peeking into Mannix's office using a closed-circuit television system (I think that may be illegal, how many workers would want their bosses spying on them?).  Campanella always has a bemused, exasperated look as if thinking to himself ""what am I going to do with this guy...he is so unorthodox, yet I can't get by without him!"". After the first several dozen times we see this, it gets tiresome.  Also, part of the charm of private detective stories is the sleuthing the PI's do in order to come up with clues. Here it seems INTERTECT and its army of egg-head intellectuals and their computers seem to be able to spew out mountains of information about every person in the United States, if not the world, making Mannix's job too easy.
In the early shows we see poor acting on the part of numerous supporting characters and an episode where Mannix's foot is injured, yet manages to gimp aroudn for  miles and miles around a rural town without a car. He is even chased by tractors and manages to survive.
A couple of interesting things we see in these early episodes is a cameo appearance by producer Bruce Geller playing a movie director, who might have been very talented as a creative person, but certainly was no actor. We also have a scene where Mannix gets to speak Armenian.
I must admit that as the season wore on the quality did improve and part of the reason was that we saw less of INTERTECT and Joe Campanella stopped showing up miraculously when Mannix was in deep trouble.  The dialogue also improved and became more Raymond Chanlerish with interesting quips commenting on life, the world and human nature.
Maybe it would be worthwhile for someone who is not sure whether they want to see this series to start with the second season, where he becomes a more convention PI with his own office and secretary.",1225152000,10,2612,4.700218818380744
3366024,5,B0014FAIVG,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the  DVD.
My recollection of the 60's detective show was far different from what I watched recently. It was so good that I would recommend it even for younger people who want a quality show with none of the modern morality concerns. The writting, acting and directing are superb.
 I thank you, Amazon, for making such quality tv viewing available to the public.

I've just watched the first disc, and the quality for a 40 year old show is amazing - better than most newer shows, and even a lot of movies from the last decade.

You'll catch a few blemishes (scratches) from the original films, but overall the colors pop and the images are crystal clear...I only wish everything was done this well.

If you're a fan of this show (or the 60's and 70's detective/cop genre) you won't be disappointed.",1221782400,5,498,4.450549450549451

3366057,5,B0014FAIVG,"Often, TV show releases are fumbled, missed opportunities. When they get it right, they should be commended. The MANNIX DVD is first class all the way! Thank you for doing such a great job. The transfer is beautiful, colors crisp, edges sharp, sounds great and the extras are a nice sign of care and respect. Now the show: I almost didn't buy this, thinking the first season might be a little stodgy, compared to the looser later seasons. Thankfully, I picked it up and have been watching it obsessively ever since. Mike Connors is so good, it's easy to see why this was so popular. His line readings are HIP, he looks convincing in the fight scenes and when he puts the moves on a lady you don't think she's responding just cuz he's the star. Wonderful music, great direction, inventive action and a lead who is consistently fun to watch and cool as hell! A great show which actually gets better once they leave Intertect behind next season.

3366058,5,B0014FAIVG,"WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME! Mannix was the coolest, sexiest private eye on TV! I really want Season Two because Peggy comes onboard. Gail Fisher was the First African American to win a prime time dramatic Emmy. The romantic chemistry between those two was undeniable although it would never develop because of the times, but it was there all right. My Favorite episode was when Mannix went blind in Season 3...chemistry through the roof! TRIVIA: On the TV show Diagnosis Murder (Dick Van Dyke's show) Mannix made a guest appearance. Van Dyke asked about Peggy and Mannix said ""She's on vacation"" and Van Dyke says ""Well why don't you join her?"", cementing (at least in my mind) what some or all of us wanted to know about their relationship. In the meantime I will be enjoying this classy blast from the past...Season One. SEASON TWO AND SUBSEQUENT SEASONS... HURRY UP AND GET HERE!!",1220659200,3,878,4.782894736842105
3366059,5,B0014FAIVG,"While growing up, Mannix was one of my favorite detective shows.  This show had it all, decent writing, good stunts (with lots of old time fisticuffs--I had forgotten how often poor Joe's melon was pistol- whipped--ah, the life of a private eye), and good acting by Mike Connors (who I think actually looks like a private eye), Joseph Campanella, and as I recall in the following seasons by Gail Fisher and Robert Reed.  Because of the quality of the show and the large number of episodes, I had been stumped as to why the show took so long to materialize on the DVD market. But hey, good things are worth waiting for and Mannix is one.  I read a Mike Connors interview in the Washington Post a year or so ago and even he was mystified by the slow move to DVD.  I had forgotten most all the episodes from that first year so watching them was like seeing them for the first time.  I found myself getting tense watching many of the shows, wondering how Joe would escape, but he always did--of course with a few bumps and bruises and occasional flesh wound.  He even did one episode in a leg cast (was it a real injury from a stunt, which he did himsef?).  The DVD also includes an interesting interview with Mike Connors and Joseph Campanella (both still look great!) and intros for each episode by Mike Connors.  For the price, you get the entire first season, which is a good deal (many only give you half a season).  Now, bring on the other 6 seasons!",1220054400,4,1452,4.388059701492537
3366060,5,B0014FAIVG,"I rarely give five stars to an older TV show. Especially, since I have a guilty pleasure of buying 60's and 70's shows from my childhood just to peak back at what I was watching then. Mostly after season or rarely two, I've satified my curiousity and move on. When I bought Mannix season 1, I was primarily fueled by combination of having it on my list for long time and not seeing any espisodes for at least twenty years.

As Gomer Pyle would say, ""Surprise Surprise Surpise!"" I've viewed about 15 episodes over the last few weeks and so far, I've enjoyed each one not just for the memories, but for qualities and uniqueness of the show. Like a lot people, I had never seen season 1 originally, and CBS never repeated them after season 1 because of the storyline change. Mike Conners plays the rogue detective with a genuine warts and all quality that is engaging and different than the standard detective faire of the day. He's totally politically incorrect - a product of all the social norms of the post WWII era. Yet his sense of his own moral code and his rebuke of simply being another cog in the interact agency wheel, have almost a counterculture quality to them - he both represents 'the man' and yet fights the rules, structure and authority figures at the same time. Joesph C. in his one season role as his boss does a really nice job, but as Mannix evolves, no boss can hold him down (bye Joe).

The quality of the prints, writing , directing, etc has already been praised enough in the other reviews. I agree with them.

One element I found personally interesting, was the highly praised opening title sequence. I think I started watching the show as a child in season 2 or 3, and always wondered where all the show images came from in the title - now I know, Season 1.

Simply put, it you want a highly quality example of a 60s/70s detective show that still will hold your interest today...we have one man available.....Mannix!",1219190400,4,1942,4.492917847025495

Otherwise, this is a great DVD release and a welcome sight among all the junk that routinely clogs up the DVD racks. It is a viewing treat to see a classic like Mannix. For those of us who enjoyed TV's classic era in the 1960s, Mannix is pure pleasure. This show has it all - great writing, fantastic acting including a Who's Who of guest stars, superb score from Lalo Schifrin, directing and camera work that is a cut above. Oh, and by the way, that reputation for violence...very much undeserved but unfortunatly it has been repeated so much over the years that it might as well be engraved in stone. Mannix fans know better; fans around the world have been waiting for this release and we're all eaagerly anticipating Season 2's release quickly followed by the remaining six seasons. The great thing about Mannix is that, like M*A*S*H, the show is just as good in its final season as it was in the early years. Mannix went out on top...where it remains!

I just finished the first season of MANNIX.  I remember this show  as a kid and my mothers affection for the star Mike Connors.  Besides perhaps the best theme song in tv history this  show still packs a punch and tons of fun. Its fun seeing Los Angeles when there were still vacant lots and its fun seeing  Neil  Diamond when he was still an artist....oh and Stephen Stills singing in hippy night clubs.  Its fun to see future more well  known actors in small side rolls. Its  fun to see 60s gals in mini skirts and boots and its fun  to watch a ton of gunplay in every episode! Nevermind the  curious lack of Police in  town or other plot holes...this was a very very well  made show...with high production  values ,  excellent cinematography and shot on film so it  looks better than most all the 80-90's  video  shows!  No scratches on  the prints...they are stunning and the sound  is great and  there are fun bonus features from the day and currently.

3366089,5,B0014FAIVG,"What a terrific series.  I remember Mannix from my childhood (every Saturday Night sitting in front of the early color TV's).  The first season is awesome, with a great theme and crazy fashions.  When you look back at the series you note some of the things that the new shows like CSI and others are carrying now.  Joe is of course the king of cool, by taking on cases that his boss (Lou) doesn't believe the firm should be involved with due to not fitting the computer's profile. Imagine that ""profiling"" in the late seventies. Needless to say the show really picked up when Joe went ""inde"" and Gail Fisher was added. The first season stands on it's own merits and set the standard for one man ""team"" was able to right the wrongs and stand up for justice.  Checking out that big Oldsmobile (which appears to be a company car - Lou drives one also), you just have to wonder what the gas would cost today.  The thing that I (and others) will always remember about Mannix is he could take a good beating - he got one in every episode.  Finally, Mike Connors (the guy who was there from the start) giving us an intro into each episode is way cool.  If you don't own it, get it.  When you do get it, notice the (what was then) innovations for TV detective shows - such as computers, mobile rotary phones, etc.  Mannix the spice of the seventies.",1216339200,4,1341,4.349397590361446

3366106,5,B0014FAIVG,"The first season of TV's ""Mannix"" (1967-68) is a detective show that was several notches above the rest. To begin with, it's cool, like Steve McQueen-meets-noir cool, with a taciturn, Chandler-esque hero Joe Mannix (played by Mike Connors) who takes threats, setbacks and violence in his stride.  Mannix doesn't mind taking a few knocks if he can crack the case and get his licks in at the end. He's also an old-school crime-buster at odds with the modern methods of the gigantic company he works for (Intertect) -- instead of relying on computers, high technology and space-age science, Mannix prefers to use shoe leather, bare knuckles and moxie.

Very hip for its time, the show was also very stylish and surprisingly experimental, full of wild, artsy, almost avant garde camera work, and sleek scripts that didn't rely too heavily on explanation and exposition, as did many TV shows of the era.  The list of guests stars in this first season is impressive as well, including great character actors and A-listers such as Neil Diamond, Karen Black and Rona Barrett. A fresh-faced, clean-shaven kid named Tom Skerritt shows up in the same episode that features the soon-to-be-legendary psychedelic band Buffalo Springfield (featuring Stephen Stills and Neil Young) as the house band of a seedy Sunset Strip go-go club. It's a very ""Sixties"" show, in the best meaning of the word -- folks who enjoy James Bond movies, Steve McQueen, or even ""The Avengers"", will find a lot to cheer about here.

Plus, this was back in the day when TV studios still knew how to program a real *season* of entertainment: with 24 full episodes, this 6-disc set will keep you on the edge of your couch for many, many nights to come.

3366108,5,B0014FAIVG,"I grew up on Mike Connors' engagingly physical gumshoe, and I always felt Season One was the best of the series, so I have been walking on clouds since my copy of ""Mannix - The First Season"" arrived!

Digitally remastered, with audio introductions by Mike Connors, himself, the 'Bogart Meets Hi-Tech' adventures of Joe Mannix of Intertect (an idea WAY ahead of it's time, in 1967) combines the un-P.C. attitudes of the era (everybody smokes relentlessly, women are often mini-skirted window dressing, and the standard solution to problems is a right to the jaw or a bullet), with a growing awareness of changing times (counterculture is a theme of one episode, Buffalo Springfield and Neil Diamond perform, and racism is addressed, by no less than Roscoe Lee Browne). Co-starring with Connors is the wonderful Joseph Campanella, as Intertect chief 'Lew Wickersham', based on Lew Wasserman, of MCA. The exchanges between 'by-the-book' Wickersham and 'what the...' Mannix are often as much fun as the episodes, themselves!

Best of all, the Special Features actually ARE special...For this package, CBS brought back Connors (a chubby, cherubic 82), and Campanella (a razor-thin 74), for a two-part interview, to reminisce about the creation of the show, the physical hardships Connors endured, and the camaraderie of cast and crew. While a voice-over commentary for the pilot, by co-creator William Link, is silly (the concept was completely rewritten by producer Bruce Geller prior to filming, and Link knew nothing about the episode!), he does reveal that originally, Mannix's first name would never be revealed (CBS nixed this, but Link would use the idea, again, in his next series...""Columbo"").

More treats are included on each disc, my favorites being TV-Land's ad for the series, focusing on Mannix's frequent pistol-whippings and shoulder wounds, a 70's ""Mike Douglas"" appearance, where Connors discusses his Armenian heritage, and TRIES to play a flute, and, especially, a brief clip from a 1997 ""Diagnosis: Murder"" episode, filmed as a sequel to a 24-year-old ""Mannix"" episode, with the 72-year-old detective still tackling cases!

Oh, heck, I could talk for hours about how GREAT ""Mannix - The First Season"" is...Just buy it, and see if you don't agree!",1213056000,39,2263,5.2430939226519335

This DVD is one of the most enjoyable ones to watch. Anytime that you get part of the cast together to ""look back"" and talk about the memories, it is the best. Special features like this are what makes owning the DVD's worthwhile. Mike Connors does a terrific job with all of the audio intros to the episodes, just like Robert Conrad did for the 1st season of Wild Wild West. I wonder why Robert Conrad wasn't able to provide more audio intros or interviews for the remaining seasons? Hopefully, the special features like these will be continued if season 2 of Mannix becomes available (hint, hint). The video quality is stunning. I'm always amazed how the editing experts can take a 40yr old show and make it look so good! As Mike Connors stated, for some reason the 1st season of Mannix really never aired in syndication, even on TV Land.

3366110,5,B0014FAIVG,"It seems that many television series that originated in the 1960s were better known for their theme music than the actual program itself. One of my favorite themes was that of The Avengers, but I also tended to fall asleep half-way through a typical episode. Mannix was one of the happy exceptions. The exciting opening credits only led to more thrills.  Yes, it was violent; rarely did five minutes pass without Mannix mixing it up with the bad guys with his fists or gun. But it wasn't as gratuitous as it might have seemed; Mannix's sharp, wise-guy wit often got him into trouble with the wrong people--and made him the likeable rogue that fans became attached to.

  The first season of Mannix was rarely seen in syndication, but beyond the differing context, the character was little changed. I watched all 24 episodes over six days, and Mannix never missed a beat.

*  Hey! These episodes are 50 minutes long!! And there ain't no commercials!
*  The Man hisself, Mike Connors, his voice still carrying strong despite his being 80 some'um, gives a brief audio-only intro to each and every episode

The ain't-so-cool ""Special features"" include...

*  A brief reminiscing by Mike Connors and Joseph Campanella. This was split into two short parts to spread over two DVDs. These two 80-some'ums, 40 years later, were a little vague but their fondness for each other and the show seemed genuine. They were a little vague in the episode commentary they did, too.
*  A brief appearance by Mike Connors on the Mike Douglas show way back when. This is my favorite of the special features cuz it was fun and as informative as the time allowed.
*  Some CBS promos -- cheap ways to fill out a DVD -- and seldom interesting after the series has been seen
*  And, with the pilot episode, the worstest commentary ever done -- by co-creator William Link -- cuz he never spoke about the episode we were watching except for about 2 minutes in all. In fact, he spent most of the time talking about another of his creations, COLUMBO, and its star, Peter Falk.

To be frank, I didn't remember the first season very well and expected these episodes -- when Mannix was stuck in a computerized detective agency -- to be boring. Couldn't have been more wrong. It was FUN thanks to the writing and, particularly, to the amiable Mike Connor screen presence. Oh... and for the very pretty young chicks -- I mean, actresses -- in miniskirts! (I feel faint.)

So they weren't cut up for added commercial time.  The episodes are facinating to see since these 24 episodes minus the pilot haven't been in syndication in my lifetime (30 years). So enjoy, and let's hope the *complete* 2nd season follows later this year. No parts please Paramount!",1212105600,8,568,4.885416666666667
3366134,4,B0014FAIVG,"I just watched the 50+ minute PILOT show, 25 minutes of story, 10 minutes of tram rides up & down a mountain & 15 minutes of helicopter chases.  I found myself fast-forwarding through the second half.  Add to that poor acting by the guest stars and it was hard for me to give this four stars.  I gave this rating just because this long lost first season has finally seen the light of a TV screen since it's first broadcast 40 years ago.

Picture quality looks clean & sharp, but does not match a theatrical movie of that time.
The Mono Audio is clear & free of noise.

VERY 1960's!  The key-punch card in the titles is just as I remember it!  And the kids nightclub fashions!  I forgot how ""hip"" this show tried to be!

The new interviews with Mike Connors & Joseph Campanella are a bit disappointing. Their age is showing & their memories a little foggy.  As Mike Connors says ""All I remember about the first season is the pilot, but that was 40 years ago!""  Both have trouble speaking, they have slowed down quite a bit with age. Mike has lost that square-jaw appearance & is almost unrecognizable.

A more enjoyable interview is the clip from the Mike Douglas Show, Mike Connors relates some on-the-set stories that are clear in his mind. Unfortunately the beginning of the clip is missing.  Apparently Mike Connors tried to sing a song, but I guess music rights have kept that off of the DVD.  This attempt to sing is mentioned several times in the clip, adding to the frustration.  Some attempts by Mike Connors to joke with Marty Feldman fall flat.  The clip itself is soft as if it was mastered from a U-Matic or  inch copy, rather than the 2 inch master tape.  There is also some drop out.  BUT this might be all that exists as tapes were expensive & often erased for re-use.

There is a badly faded, soft focus CBS fall 1967 promo reel that basically highlights the pilot show.  After watching the pilot, this was hard to sit through.

Other bonuses on this set do not pertain to season 1 and should have been held for the season 2 DVD release (hopeful thinking).
There is a syndication promo reel used to sell the series to TV stations for re-runs. Since season 1 was never syndicated it only uses scenes form the later 'private eye' version of the series, with clips of Peggy.
There is also a clever TV LAND promo poking fun at the fact Mannix rarely gets shot.  Again these clips are not from the first season.

A clip of the Mannix appearance on Diagnosis Murder is only about 5 minutes, just enough to tease you into buying that series to see the rest of the episode.  The quality of the clip is surprisingly soft.

The bonus material is spread out over the 6 discs, filling up what little extra space there is on them.

A top notch DVD with some fun bonus material.  CBS / Paramount seem to have gotten their act together to give us more than the old bare-bones TV-on-DVD sets.",1211846400,5,2892,4.40566037735849
3366135,5,B0014FAIVG,"5 stars for the show itself. 5 stars for the fact that it will be released with some excellent special features, including interviews with series star Mike Connors. 5 stars for Mr. Mannix being the toughest and coolest P.I. in TV history.

UPDATE 6/13:
The picture quality is EXCELLENT. The episodes are VERY ENTERTAINING, they are fast paced with lots of action. The special features are good, but there can never really be enough or too many as far as I'm concerned, so lets hope for some more in season 2. The interviews are a pleasure to see. The audio intros are a nice touch, I'd like to see those again in season 2. All in all it's totally worth getting, don't hesitate for a moment, you'll love it.",1209340800,6,706,4.4728682170542635
3366136,2,B0014FAIVG,"When I was a kid, my mom watched any show with PIs. Taught me early to stay in my room and read.

Some years back, she was visiting/torturing my family at some holiday and we treated her to a Mannix marathon on TV Land. It was eye opening how much better the production values are on TV today. Just on production values, mind you, Law & Order looks like Cleopatra or Lord of the Rings next to this.

Walls always shook when doors were slammed which was one of the major action tropes the show offered. Also, for action-packed fun: Mannix running up stairs, Mannix running up stairs with his gun drawn, Mannix getting winged with a bullet.

I gave it the second star for the years of laughs it's given my wife and I at thinking of my mother's goggle-eyed joy and adoration in this barely moving and hardly acted series.

3366137,5,B0014FAIVG,"David Breckman has a BAAAAAD FEELING about the cut-down syndicated versions of Mannix. I recently bought a 'Payless' 3 episodes on DVD, of Mannix. They are the full 50 minute versions, but very obviously transferred from a less than pefect 16mm TV print, with scatches and splices, so at least these three are complete, and when I buy the 24 episode version from Amazon, I will know if the studio is cheating us. The three episodes are;

  The Name Is Mannix
  Nothing Ever Works Twice
  The Cost Of A Vacation

The Payless transfer is SHOCKING, almost unwatchable, poor old Joe has a a severe yellow cast on his fizzog, perhaps his liver has gone, but the stories are great!!! At the cost of $2.99 Australian, what would you expect? Lets hope the CBS versions are up to their usual high quality standard such as 'Hogan's Heroe's' and 'The Untouchables'.

3366138,4,B0014FAIVG,"MANNIX ran for eight years, and remains the toughest, grittiest detective show ever created for TV. The fact that it has taken this long to get this show on DVD is a crime that would have Joe Mannix busting heads over. I'll reserve judgment on the final DVD presentation, but (assuming this season is complete) this release has already earned four out of five stars in my book just for finally making it into stores after years of inexplicable delays and indifference on the part of the studio. If there are even a few token extras, this will be a five star DVD.

Bluntly, it's about damn time!",1205107200,6,594,4.5
3366139,5,B0014FAIVG,"The 194 one-hour episodes (all in color) of detective drama ""Mannix"" originally aired on CBS from 1967-1975.  It was a slick series, uncharacteristically violent (at least by television standards) with decent enough scripting so that there was generally logic involved in all the storylines.

Mike Conners (one of my fraternity brothers) played the title character, a maverick private eye who starts out (Season One) as a loner within ""Intertect"" a large detective agency.  It was intended by its creators (Richard Levinson and William Link-see ""Columbo"") to be a man vs technology statement.

In Season One Mannix is in constant conflict with his boss Lou Wickersham (Joseph Campanella).  Lou has invested big bucks in a computer system, the latest electronic technology, and assorted scientific detection gadgets; and these are central to the way he is marketing the agency's services.  Mannix is an old fashion gumshoe, solving cases by hard work and instinct.  Their confrontations may remind you a similar dynamic on ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"".

After its first year ""Mannix"" became a conflicted series.  The title character was a reprise of the Nick Stone character Conners played in the police drama ""Tightrope"" (1959-60 also on CBS).  Stone and Mannix are no-frills film noir style grunts, coming out of most confrontations a bit the worse for the wear.  But once the producers of ""Mannix"" saw the success of ""Bullitt"" (1968) they began to pack the series with car chases and outfit their otherwise grim gumshoe with a succession of ""Munsters"" inspired exotic automobiles.  Can you say incongruity?

But that should not concern those about to view the Season One DVD set.  Speaking of incongruity,  the later seasons' content and style seems mismatched with the boxy split screen title graphics.  These were a carry over from Season One where they were meant to reflect the computer and technology themes.  I liked them even though they seemed out of place in subsequent seasons.  I also liked the catchy theme music by Lalo Schifrin who did the theme for ""Mission Impossible"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1204588800,19,2135,5.115606936416185
3366140,5,B0014FAIVG,"-- that the episodes found in this box set won't be looking the way they did when they originally aired on CBS.  My guess is, we are going to be getting the syndicated versions of each one...the butchered versions that were cut down by several minutes to allow for more commercials... and that really sucks.

But I can't say I'm surprised.  When ""vintage"" shows like MANNIX finally arrive on DVD, they aren't considered important enough for the studio to expend much effort on.  Consequently, nobody bothers looking for the old, uncut episodes; instead they settle for the more readily available bastardized ones.  Like I said, a real shame.",1204588800,4,641,4.898148148148148
3366141,4,B0014FAIVG,"It's a long time in coming, but Mannix is finally on DVD. The first season of Mannix (1967-68 season)---when he worked for the Intertect Detective Agency--has never been in syndication and consequently--these episodes haven't been seen in over 40 years. For it's time, the first season was considered violent and gritty (truly ""neo-noir"")---in fact the promos advertised Mannix as working with ""a hunch and a punch"".

In the wake of Bobby Kennedy's assassination in June of 1968, the FCC asked all three networks to tone down the violence in their TV shows--and Mannix was the most violent of it's time.  But also in retrospect the original format of the show--with Mannix working for a large firm but constantly defying his boss Lew Wickersham and using old fashion legwork in place of the firm's computers--- just was not sustainable in the long run. And thus, for the rest of the series, Mannix worked on his own.  Still, Paramount and CBS did a great job in restoring each episode and they all look and sound great (just compare to some of the bootleg DVDs out there).

As an added bonus, Lalo Schifrin composed the theme song and the music tracks for a number of the episodes.

I heartily recommend for all Mannix fans and await subsequent seasons!",1204588800,5,1253,4.809302325581395

Don't let us down, Paramount, they're have been soooo many series to come to dvd, only to stop production due to sales.  So, let's all get together and spread the word.

3366143,5,B0014FAIVG,"After years of begging and pleading with Viacom, Paramount and anyone and everyone connected with Sumner Redstone, the holders of the rights to Mannix, finally they are bringing this most excellent series out on DVD. All I can say is, what took you so long?
There are plenty of forgettable series on DVD and that Mannix has been denied to a generation of TV viewers (not to mention we Boomers who loved the show from Day One) is really too bad.
Mannix was cool for several reasons.
The cars. No matter the season, Joe Mannix had the coolest cars. From the custom Toronado convertible in the first season, to the Dart GTS to the Barracudas in later seasons, Joe's cars were always the best. Hi s cars were always customized by the great George Barris. And he had a phone! How cool was that back then?
The Music! Jaxx great Lalo Shiffrin wrote the title theme as well as much of the incidental music. The Mannix soundtrack was a strong blend of crime jazz and edgy late 60's funk. Joe and his loyal sidekick and secretary, Peggy Fair, would show up in a jazz bar on many occasions. Many music greats of the era popped up whether as themselves or as a character (Neil Diamond and Lou Rawls for starters).
The guest stars - Everyone wanted to do a Mannix gig. Check IMDB for a list - it's a who's who of Hollywood in the 1970s. Everyone from new faces trying to make it (Diane Keaton) to older actors who were on their way down (but not out) are there.
The clothes - Joe sported a series of wild plaid sports coats over the years. In the 70's those tweedy plaids with the wide lapels were the rage - and check out those linings! Peggy was always smartly dressed as well.
Heck, I could go on and on. Suffice to say that Mannix was the classiest detective drama of the era. It got a bad rap for violence, but the violence then was hardly even a tenth of what you see today. For kids growing up in the 70's the violence and gritty drama were a view to another world outside our tidy suburban homes. And it was never gratuitous.
It's here folks. Order one, order more! They make great gifts! And the more we fans order, the more likely we are to see the rest of the seasons released - some of which haven't been seen since they aired on TV back in the 1970's.",1204243200,19,2251,4.286384976525822

8255484,5,B0014FAIVG,"Season 1 of Mannix was unique in that Mannix wasn't working for himself. He worked for Intertec, a supposedly huge investigative firm which was heavy on computer analysis and electronic gadgets. Mannix was a star, if completely unmanageable, detective.

Mannix was cool and confident. He could handle himself in a fight, and he backed down from no one.

Before Mannix, the most successful private eye series was 77 Sunset Strip. In a way, Mannix was very derivative of that series, although many Mannix stories were darker and grittier than 77 Sunset Strip usually offered. At the time, Mannix was criticized for excessive violence, although its violence is pale compared to what we've been used to for decades now.

As of the date of this review, Mannix is being shown on MeTV, which most people can access either through a local cable provider, or a digital antennae. As a procedural, it's not a show that you MUST catch every episode of, so the MeTV airings are a fine way to find out (or reacquaint with) what a fine series this was, and why it was popular enough to last for eight years in a very competitive TV market.",1497916800,,1124,4.695431472081219
