8622405,1,B0028K3HG4,"We bought this video because we thought it would give us some useful background information about Moldova in preparation for our one-year stay there. But the video is just awful, amateurish and overall disappointing. It turned out to be a really boring film, mostly with still pictures, about really uninteresting, superficial, shallow personal detais (for example, their eating a meal at McDonalds, or how they met their Moldovan host family in Alaska, etc) that could be of interest only for their own friends and family. The first 15 minutes of the film do not even mention Moldova; it is simply a pastiche of this couple and their life in Alaska, Hawaii, and New York. Very little film, few pictures, or information about Moldova itself. I would really like to get a refund. This DVD is a complete waste of time and money. This is the worst documentary we have ever seen. Quite frankly, I am shocked that they put such an amateurish, narcissistic DVD up for sale.",1335052800,,967,4.796407185628743
