8497912,1,B006GX69NW,"Unofficial release, hard to find rare piece of ultra campy early 90's slasher. I was very disappointed by the low quality of this DVD release. I certainly wouldn't recommend this title at all. Picture and sound quality is of an old VHS tape. (Even the end credits are cut off too early) Film itself, well...there's a masked killer... see it if you're a die hard fan of Claudio Fragasso. Not worth the price tag though.",1368576000,,418,4.586666666666667
8497913,5,B006GX69NW,"Finally, Claudio Fragasso's lost horror film is available on dvd, thanks to the folks over at mom n pop video. Hopefully they will release an uncut version of monster dog or beyond darkness next!",1324339200,,195,4.764705882352941
