8489018,2,B005Y2HXDQ,Pretty stupid movie and to be honest in many cases you could see pretty bad acting overall not just the hammy performance by the lead woman. but the other characters as well.  Not worth buying thats for sure..  Id save your money for a better movie.  Also i noticed in many places it seems sound quality was kind of poor..  Meh.,1337817600,,328,4.327868852459017
8489019,5,B005Y2HXDQ,"The wonderful Beth Broderick (who would forget her as the clever, smart and sexy Aunt Zelda in ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"") plays Alyssa, a TV stars who's best times are over long ago. She now does commercials for her husband's air condition company.

After the accident of their daughter, Alyssa's husband (a fine performance by Chris Mulkey) tries to find his inner peace in Buddhism. Alyssa sees no other way than to kill her husband. He will not be the only one. The body count rises and so does Alyssa's career.

I just loved the weird sense of humor in this film (which director Robert Lee King also used in Psycho Beach Party) and the funny inside jokes.

Beth Broderick's performance as washed up TV star is really outstanding. She is not only a great actress, she also looks great in this film. She has two gorgeous funny nude scenes in ""Bad Actress"". Her beautiful face, pretty legs and that perfect body makes every 20-year old girl fade away.

If you liked the funny ""Psycho Beach Party"" (which is from the same director) and ""Slap her she's French"" (where he wrote the script) and you are a fan of Beth Broderick than this is the right film for you. Highly recommended!",1334016000,,1182,4.587677725118484

8489021,5,B005Y2HXDQ,"In a somewhat unexpected twist from this talented director (Psycho Beach Party), Robert Lee King takes a hilarious premise, infuses it with just enough camp, but let's us believe in the plot and the characters.  A funny, smart romp that captures your attention and has you finding yourself laughing in all the wrong places.",1327190400,3,323,4.981481481481482
8489022,5,B005Y2HXDQ,"An amazing film with an amazing cast!  The movie brilliantly juggles three deaths, anorexia, an actress with a failed show biz career, murder, inept police detectives, and the lives of an overly privileged family... and makes it funny. I generally become easily bored when watching films, yet BAD ACTRESS kept me laughing the entire time.  The amount of humor was perfect so that the film was funny, yet none of the comedy felt forced or strained -- a great watch! I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh. It has been said that this movie takes comedy to a whole new level and I wholeheartedly agree. This movie isn't quite like any other and I am sure to see it again on DVD.  Great film!  -- Kayleigh Bondor via IMDB

A KILLER GOOD TIME review by Lorraine Ruth Rosenberg

I've have been anticipating seeing this fill since I first found out about it's production. As soon as I saw the trailer I had high hopes for this film and waited anxiously for a New York showing and thankfully that day has come. This movie went above and beyond my expectations, especially for an independent film, but I expected that from director like Bob King, who is famous for the cult classic ""Psycho Beach Party."" This script by David Michael Barrett is filled with perfectly placed comedy throughout the entire movie, even while handling the subject of murder, eating disorders, revenge and promiscuity, along with the hilarity of watching a washed up soap star try to make it back onto the screen, only to appear in her husbands commercials for his appliance stores. The cast is absolutely fantastic, with the amazing Beth Broderick as the title star of BAD ACTRESS, Alyssa Rampart-Pillage, and also Chris Mulkey who plays Bernie Pillage, the cool king of air conditioning and Alyssa's less than supportive husband. Although this movie isn't something you would watch with your young kids, I recommend it to anyone who loves a funny, but cynical comedy and those who are fans of Bob King's other works.  -- Lorraine Ruth Rosenberg via IMDB

EYE ON... BAD ACTRESS review by Alex Natanzon, Inside Beat Rutgers University

The director of the cult classic Psycho Beach Party, Robert Lee King delivers a delightfully quirky and off-beat black comedy titled Bad Actress.  Set in Los Angeles, Calif., this film focuses on Alyssa -- a gorgeous, middle-aged actress who was once the queen of primetime television but now is old news and must resort to starring in her husband Bernie's appliance store commercials. But when their daughter Topanga accidentally dies, the grief-stricken Bernie falls into a depression and eventually turns to spirituality: He eventually decides to sell off his companies and donate the entire franchise fortune to charity. Alyssa will have none of this and conspires with Bernie's jealous cousin to take her husband out of commission. What follows is a wacky ride of twists and turns with Alyssa as the conductor.

Screenwriter David Michael Barrett does a fine job of poking fun at American consumerism, as many of the characters are rich and materialistic. Even more so, this film explores how one can stoop to ridiculous acts out of necessity to fulfill personal agendas. The character interaction is constantly imbued with hilarity since each individual has their own attention-grabbing personality. The film satirizes the glamorous Hollywood lifestyle as the characters plot against each other in a soap opera-esque fashion. In the end, however, it is Alyssa's character that steals the show. She is the glorified epitome of a drama queen and conducts her deeds accordingly.

Bad Actress is the type of movie that should not be taken too seriously. It is never overly dramatic as it maintains a light air of absurdity. This film is an edgy, quick paced bag-o'-fun with a hyper-real plotline and high-octane characters that are as ludicrously satisfying as the city they inhabit.

SUMMER CAMP review by David D'Arcy, ARTINFO International Edition

Bad Actress, the San Fernando Valley comedy about a celebrity actress in a bad way with the law.  Yes, it's once again, it's trouble in Phil Spector country, where Bernie's Air Conditioning is about to open a new store in Tarzana. Bernie (Chris Mulkey) is married to Alyssa Rampart-Pillage (Beth Broderick), a former TV star whose series HMO Nurse has been cancelled. Despite that injustice, Alyssa is under siege from autograph-seeking fans and considers herself too important for offers from a new reality-show, Celebrity Rehab.  ""I don't do drugs,"" she says. ""It's called acting,"" her agent responds. So reality shows aren't real?

Two of Alyssa's children despise her, and a third (named Topanga) is an ecological activist who blames high-priced refrigerators sold by Bernie for the destruction of the rain forest. Soon the family members start destroying each other. With the LAPD investigating the murders, it's an instant comedy of errors (maybe that's the reality element). ""It's the LAPD - that's like being investigated by a crossing guard,"" Alyssa says.

Bad Actress is written by David Michael Barrett and directed by Robert Lee King, whose Psycho Beach Party of 2000 (adapted from Charles Busch's play) is a must-see of kitsch-camp. It reminds you that odd genre blending didn't begin with over-budgeted Hollywood hallucinations like Cowboys and Aliens.  Once again, a tabloid genre becomes a movie genre. What's more American than a celebrity accused of murdering a loved one, or at least a spouse. What's more LA than police asking witnesses and defendants for autographs. (If you think the world has been too hard on the LAPD, see the documentary Crime After Crime by Yoav Potash, about the wrongful conviction of Deborah Peagler. The LA cops couldn't get OJ, but they did put Peagler away for 26 years, despite a mountain of evidence that pointed elsewhere.  See Vikram Jayanti's The Agony and the Ecstasy of Phil Spector, if you can find it, for celebrity murder and the Phil Spector story in Spector's own words (and wigs).

In the title role of BAD ACTRESS, Beth Broderick gives a star turn to the notion that, as one character puts it, ""there's no statute of limitations on celebrity."" (Does Steve Guttenberg know this?) Broderick doesn't have Phil Spector's wigs - who does? -  but she is a grand diva of insincerity.  I can't wait for her award speech.  Vincent Ventresca deserves praise as Morris (Bernie's cousin, partner and betrayer) for sculpting a deft mockery out of the thin tissue of television stereotypes.  The film is now out on DVD -- and I'll definitely go see it again.",1323820800,,6587,4.982680036463081
