7333690,2,B011KG2G5O,"I just bought the Bond 50 set and the only thing that's cool about this set is that it fits better into my library and they leave room for the final bond that will have Daniel Creg. If they really wanted to sell us something complete, they would have. I remember when The Chucky movies got released to blue ray in a set with the original even though the original was MGM and the sequels were all Universal, it still got done. I want to see a Bond collection with the original 1954 Casino Royal with Berry Nelson, the 1967 parody Casino Royal and Never Say Never Again. The day that comes out I'll have a Shut up and take my money moment. This is BS",1446163200,5,648,4.150793650793651
7333691,3,B011KG2G5O,"If you use iTunes for your media don't buy this.  I was disappointed to find that the ""Digital HD"" download options are only for UltraViolet, Great movies, great packaging and extras but this was a killer for me.  Returning based on that",1445644800,69,237,4.619047619047619
7333692,5,B011KG2G5O,thanks my friends,1444953600,,17,5.0
7333693,4,B011KG2G5O,"To purchase again....or not purchase again?  That was the question.  I finally gave in.  Why?  I wanted the Digital copies and this was the least expensive way to get them.  After paying $210.00, it breaks down to $9.13 per digital copy and I also get the Everything or Nothing Blu Ray.  So, it's not as bad as it seems.  The packaging does make it easier to store them.  I do have a fondness for the Bond 50 Collection, but getting those discs out of the sleeves can be a task.  So is it worth it?  I did sample the Digital Copies.  They look outstanding.  They are in HD and they sound great as well.  I don't regret the purchase.

My advise. Wait for them to go on sale.  These are not exactly an Amazon best seller, so I'm sure they'll come down in price.

 But I will say, it's very nice to watch portions of different Bond movies, without having to change discs. They come in a James Bond Collection bundle, so they are very handy to find.  I'd have rated this 5 stars if this was the first time the movies were sold in a set.",1443484800,107,1032,4.152284263959391

7333696,5,B011KG2G5O,"One reviewer asked what the difference is between this and the ""Bond 50"" release.

This set includes the movies in Digital HD, which are probably the more desirable and future-proof format. Otherwise, I bet it is exactly the same as the Bond 50 set. I have the Bond 50 set, and the discs looks identical. Also, I assume they didn't do any new fresh transfers. There might be differences in special features, but it's unlikely.",1438732800,16,426,4.68

I wanted to rewatch all the 007 movies and ended up deciding just to buy all of them.

The movies come in 3 separate cases in this order, 1967 - 1977, 1979 - 2002, and 2006 - 2015.

7333718,1,B011KG2G5O,"I purchased this collection one edition previous, where there were no digital copies, so it annoys me to no end when they do a reissue with value added content and people who bought the original set, or in many cases the original movie and then release a ""Director's Cut""/""Unrated Edition"" a few months down the road. I also really hate the Ultraviolet digital copies and don't understand why they don't offer Ultraviolet as well as iTunes digital copies, like most movies do. I find the interface/interaction with Ultraviolet digital copies to be makeshift at best but, really like all of my media, music, movies, home movies, music videos, ringtones, etc., being in one place... and my preference is iTunes.",1480723200,,709,4.966386554621849

I had to wait 6 days to get a response from customer service regarding Instawatch for another title. The movies themselves are great, and I only paid $4.15 per movie so no real complaint on the movie set. I just knock my rating to ""it's okay"" because I would have preferred to have Amazon versions of the digital movies. I'll likely not take advantage of digital versions because I don't want to deal with Vudu.",1480636800,,511,4.505376344086022

There are four ""Unofficial"" James Bond films, not produced by Cubby Broccoli or the Broccoli family (Eon Productions).
None are in this box.
Two of them involve the Connery family.
Three of the four unofficial films are on Blu-Ray (although one is hard to find on Amazon)
They are the result of business deals negotiated by Ian Fleming early in his career, before he met Cubby Broccoli.

[for ease of navigation, read this review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

----- 1954: ""CASINO ROYALE"" - starring Barry Nelson
This is a one-hour black and white American TV production - one year after the book's publication.
Aside from the fact that Barry Nelson plays American agent ""Jimmy Bond"", this is reasonably faithful to the book,
though the torture scene is played down:
James Bond is placed into a bathtub fully clothed and Le Chiffre (Peter Lorre) does something to him, but we're not sure what.
Cool that Peter Lorre was the first Bond Villain.
- The Blu-Ray is expensive and hard-to-find.
Cheaper if you don't mind getting it on DVD.
Sometimes available as an Amazon download.
-- For directions on how to locate the 1954 Casino Royale on Blu-Ray, see the first Comment (dated July 25, 2016) following this review.

----- 1967: ""CASINO ROYALE"" - starring David Niven
David Niven plays Sir James Bond, who retired from British Intelligence after World War II - but M still seeks his help when needed.
After retirement, Bond's 007 number was kept active to confuse England's enemies.
All subsequent 007s were also required to adopt the name ""James Bond"" - this actually makes sense, considering the different actors involved.
- it's a Comedy. Sort of.

----- 1983: ""NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN"" - starring Sean Connery
52 Year old Sean Connery came out of retirement for an enormous salary.
Its a remake of ""Thunderball"".
Not as good as the original, but Sean Connery is always worth watching.
- Plus, if you count this as Sean Connery's 7th Bond film, he ties the record previously held by Roger Moore.

----- 1967: ""OPERATION DOUBLE 007"" - starring Neil Connery.
The fourth unofficial film has no connection to either Ian Fleming or Cubby Broccoli, though it does have a connection to Sean Connery.

- James Bond is in hospital recovering from injuries.
- M needs a replacement for an important mission.
- None of the other 00s are up to the task, so M seeks out James Bond's brother.
If nothing else, the producers deserve credit for Audacity:
They hired Neil Connery - Sean Connery's brother - to play James Bond's brother.
Makes sense, I guess.
For legal reasons, he cannot be addressed as ""Mr. Bond"", so in the movie he is called ""Mr. Connery"" (actually ""Dr. Connery"").

For the first twenty years of the Bond franchise, the leadership of British Intelligence was unquestioned:
- Bernard Lee was M - James Bond's boss.
- Lois Maxwell was Moneypenny - M's secretary.
- Desmond Llewelyn was Q - Quartermaster and weapons expert.
For this film:
- Bernard Lee was hired to play the ""Director of Allied Counter-Intelligence"".
- Lois Maxwell was hired to play his secretary ""Miss Maxwell"".
- Only Desmond Llewelyn resisted the temptation. Or he was busy doing something else.

More connections to the world of Bond:
- The villain is Adolfo Celi. He was the villain in ""Thunderball"" (1965).
- The villain's henchman is Anthony Dawson. He was the villain's henchman in ""Dr. No"" (1962).
- The Bond Babe is Daniella Bianchi. She was the Bond Babe in ""From Russia with Love"" (1963).

Also known as ""Operation Kid Brother"" or ""O.K. Connery"".
Unlike the 1967 Casino Royale, this is not a comedy - these people are serious.
For more information, go to Wikipedia and look up the article on ""O.K. Connery"".

-- It is not available on DVD or Blu-Ray.
-- It is available as an Amazon Download under the title:
""Operation Kid Brother""

BUT - Most of this film is available as part of a 4 DVD boxed set: ""Mystery Science Theater 3000, Volume XXV""
Unfortunately not available separately.
The movie download is 1 hour, 46 minutes.
This Mystery Science Theater version is 1 hour, 16 minutes (+ 16 minutes of sketch comedy).
I love MST3K. You may not.
Read the reviews first.

- The Mystery Science Theater version is also available as an Amazon Download under the title:
""Mystery Science Theater 3000: Operation Kid Brother""

P.S. When this episode of MST3K was originally shown on Comedy Central back in 1993,
the title was still ""Operation Double 007"".
By the time of the 2012 DVD release, the title had been changed to ""Operation Kid Brother"",
But the title on the film print still reads ""Operation Double 007"".
---------------

Roger Moore holds the record with seven Official Appearances as James Bond.
Sean Connery is second with six Official Appearances as James Bond.
BUT
If you count Sean Connery in ""Never Say Never Again"", they are tied at seven.
AND
If you count ""Operation Double-007"" as a Bond film, the Connery Family beats Roger Moore's record.

7333792,4,B011KG2G5O,"There are two versions of the James Bond series out there on Blu-Ray right now.  The ""Ultimate"" set on this page is the higher end version.  There is also a cheaper, lower-end version of this set simply called ""The James Bond Collection"".  So what's the difference?

INCLUDED IN BOTH SETS:
Both versions contain the exact same set of 23 Blu-Rays spanning the entire ""official"" James Bond series by EON Productions, Dr. No through Skyfall (there is actually an extra slot available for you to add a copy of ""SPECTRE"" too, but that wasn't out on Blu-Ray at the time of this set's release so it's not included).  For collectors, I'm hearing that this is the exact same set of Blu-Rays that came with the previously-released ""Bond 50"" set, just repackaged.  The Bond 50 set presented the films in a cardboard book-style format, with each Blu-Ray being on a different ""page"" of the book.  These newer sets instead present the films in standard multi-disc Blu-Ray cases.  The films are divided up into three ""volumes"", the first contains ""Dr. No"" through ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", the second contains ""Moonraker"" through ""Die Another Day"", and the third contains ""Casino Royale"" through ""Skyfall"" (with an extra slot for SPECTRE).  While this newer packaging unfortunately loses all of the artwork that graced the pages of the ""Bond 50"" set, this presentation does result in a slightly more protective and less bulky set.

The film quality absolutely stunning.  The restoration done on these films for the ""Ultimate DVD Collection"" sets from a few years back look absolutely magnificent on Blu-Ray.  This is truly some of the best film restoration work ever done--you can tell no expense was spared to make these films look better than they probably ever have.  Even the oldest films look gorgeous.  The colors are just incredible, and great care was taken to remove every single blemish from the original film.  These movies look and sound as if they were shot yesterday.  This is what Blu-Ray was made for.

As far as the films themselves, every Bond fan will tell you that some have definitely aged better than others.  Obviously this all comes down to personal preference.  Here's my brief assessment.  The best entries in the set include the early Connery films (""Dr. No"", ""From Russia With Love"", ""Goldfinger""), a few of the Moore films (""Live and Let Die"", ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", ""For Your Eyes Only""), the Daniel Craig ones, and a handful of others including ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", ""Licence to Kill"", ""Goldeneye"", and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".  The outright stinkers of the set are definitely the late Moore era (""Moonraker"", ""Octopussy"", ""A View To a Kill"").  The rest are somewhere in between.  But your mileage will definitely vary depending on how you like your Bond.

ULTIMATE EDITION ONLY:
The differences between this ""Ultimate"" set and the standard set are actually smaller than you might think. The Ultimate set comes with a bonus disc containing a handful of extra bonus features not found on the main Blu-Rays, plus the James Bond documentary from a few years back called ""Everything Or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007"" (actually a pretty good documentary, but also something you can find elsewhere).  It also comes with an artbook containing a selection of posters for all of the movies.  Like most of the artbooks that come with Blu-Rays, they're just a preview of another book that's available elsewhere.  Certainly not a make or break for the Ultimate Set.

By far the biggest difference between the sets is that the ""Ultimate"" edition comes with an Ultraviolet code that can be redeemed for the digital versions of all 23 films.  Like I said in the title, this should be your decision maker between the two versions of the set.  How much does Ultraviolet mean to you?  If you're one of those people (like me) that trudged through the confusing mess of setting up an Ultraviolet account and linking it to a site where you can watch the movies (like Vudu or Flixter), than this code will effectively allow you to watch your Bond collection from any device anywhere you are.  Despite the hassle of Ultraviolet, that's a HUGE bonus in my opinion, and the only legitimate reason for going with the ""Ultimate"" version of this set.  And if you do decide to go for the ""Ultimate"", it might be worth waiting to see if it goes on sale--I got mine for as low as $90 during a sale shortly after Thanksgiving.  Like a lot of things on Amazon, the price of this set seems to fluctuate dramatically.

A COUPLE OF ANNOYING ISSUES I RAN INTO:
--The copy of this set that Amazon originally shipped me contained two copies of ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and was missing ""The World Is Not Enough"".  While Amazon made it super easy for me to ship it back and get a new one, this points to a lack of quality control on the studio's end.  Make sure to check your set to make sure you have everything.
--There have been issues for a lot of people, including myself, with the Ultraviolet redemption of ""Goldeneye"".  From what I've gathered, there are multiple IDs for Goldeneye floating around the Ultraviolet realm for some reason, and depending on where you redeem it might not show up in your library.  I've had to deal with both Flixter and Vudu customer support to get it to show up correctly on their respective service, and I now have two separate copies of Goldeneye in my digital locker in order to accommodate both services.  With a little patience you can get it to work, but it's infuriating that they still don't seem to have gotten this resolved.  For this set, Vudu is definitely my preferred player because they have the movies in HD whereas Flixter only shows them in SD.  My suggestion would be to do the redemption through Vudu, and deal with them if Goldeneye doesn't show up.",1455753600,233,5792,4.751
7333793,5,B011KG2G5O,"Unlike some other reviewers I have only a few of the Bond films on Blu-Ray so this was an opportunity to own them all with digital copies.  The pricing I believe is reasonable for what you are getting and if you are like me, this set can continue to grow without the need to 'upgrade' when a new Bond set is released in the future.

I personally place each of the films in their own Blu-Ray case&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verbatim-Blu-Ray-Cases-Bulk-30-Pack-98603/dp/B00QTDU20U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verbatim Blu Ray Cases Bulk (30 Pack) 98603</a>&nbsp;with the appropriate cover art ( customaniacs.org/forum/cover-forums/ ) that way you can grow the series without it being obvious that you purchased one set in bulk and then added as new films were released.

I was also VERY happy to see that these digital copies can be downloaded onto a Kindle so they are easy to travel with.  On my most recent trip across the Atlantic I was able to view all of the Connery films back to back and it made the flight much more tolerable.  The easiest way to test for value is to determine the cost for a Blu-ray only set and then look on your favorite digital copy site and see what they are charging for each film.  I think after that you will agree that this is worth the purchase price...",1455667200,,1334,4.986486486486487

I have seen the first six movies and they are the best I have seen yet.  Using the original footage and scanned at 4K, I saw scenes that were cropped on the sides for the VHS (Full Screen) and the top & bottom to make it Widescreen again for the DVD.  Case-in-point, the vault scene from Goldfinger.  On the VHS it showed the casing when the door is opened, the bottom drops and a metal sheet slides across.  On the DVD, the bottom of the scene is cut and you don't see it.  These Blu-ray Discs show all the movies as they were shot, only better.

This Blu-ray collection, starting with the original footage and scanned in 4K, is the best I have ever seen.  I recommend this collection to anyone that loves the Bond series of 23 movies and a spot for #24.  Don't forget the 'Bonus Disc'!",1454889600,2,951,4.209944751381215

I wanted the Bond 50 set for years, now I'm glad I waited and got this set instead.

7333831,5,B011KG2G5O,"I was lucky enough to get this when it was on sale back in early December. I'm a huge fan of Bond, always catching it on either TBS or Spike.

I won't review the movies, because you can read about them anywhere on the net. I'll review, instead the packaging.

The set comes in a nice box with removable outer sleeve. The back of the box gives details about what is included and the special features. The discs come in three different cases and each disc has its own holder. The first case holds the movies ranging from 1962-1977, which include:

-Dr. No
-From Russia With Love
-Goldfinger
-Thunderball
-You Only Live Twice
-On Her Majesty's Secret Service
-Diamonds Are Forever
-Live and Let Die
-The Man With The Golden Gun
-The Spy Who Loved Me

Case #2 holds the movies from 1979-2002; which include:

-Moonraker
-For Your Eyes Only
-Octopussy
-A View To A Kill
-The Living Daylights
-Licence To Kill
-Goldeneye
-Tomorrow Never Dies
-The World Is Not Enough
-Die Another Day

Case #3 includes the movies from 2006-2015:

-Casino Royale
-Quantum of Solace
-Skyfall
-Spectre*

The set also includes a booklet with every films movie posters from around the world. Overall, this is a great collection for any Bond fan. The movies look and sound great. If you're a fan or are thinking about getting into one of the greatest spy series ever, I highly recommend this set.

I've only looked at Dr. No so far, but the image quality is a major improvement over the Ultimate DVDs, though it does tend to show uo the uncorrectable flaws in the original source (you'll see a fair bit of film grain with Dr. No, as it was shot on a fairly low budget.)

7333864,4,B011KG2G5O,"As a proud owner of the 2000-2003 Special Edition DVD sets, and having read reviews stating that these Blu-Rays were from the same prints as those DVDS: I was in no rush to upgrade. I ultimately received this set as a kind of gift and am happy to review it for prospective buyers:

Pros:
- High Definition -The upgrade in video quality from the DVDs is obvious. Even if most of the films are not shining examples of the HD format: this is probably as good as they are going to look for a very long time (until 4K dominates home video and prompts another re-master).
- Packaging - The box for this set is smaller than even the smallest of the three separate 2000-2003 DVD collections. I now have more room for new DVDs and Blu-Rays on my shelf! I do not own the ""Bond: 50"" set but I have seen it and read that the bulky book packaging is impractical and accessing the discs is difficult.
- Special Features - All special features from the previous DVDs are present with the exception of the ""Text Free Title Sequence"" for many of the films (detailed in other more extensive reviews). This is good!

Cons:
- The Digital Copies - The UltraViolet Digital Copies included with this set are a total bust. They cannot be downloaded for offline playback and the ""HDX"" copy protection software is required even to simply stream the HD versions of the films. My early assumption, seeing that this set was Amazon exclusive, was that the movies would AT LEAST become available in your Amazon Video Library... This is not the case either. I'm sure there were legalities involved that prevented such an elegant solution- but it renders the Digital Copies almost useless for me.
- The Disc Menus - This could just be my own personal preference; but I loved the ultra-themed disc menus on the 2000-2003 Special Edition DVDs! Each film had a DVD menu designed to match the details of the film: Moonraker had an animated space station and funky 70's music, GoldenEye had 90's music with fairly modern computer images and a satellite. These new Blu-Rays all have the same stock menu design with scenes from the specific films swapped into moving portholes (bullet holes?)- it kind of looks like the generic menus on Universal Studios' Blu-Rays. It may be sacrilege to HD fanatics; but I'd take upconverted menus from the DVDs over these Blu-Ray menus any day!

My primary interest with this set was in the Digital Copies: being able to download and watch the Bond films while traveling would have been worth $100 to me. That is not possible, and the lack of this functionality cost the set a 5-star rating.

Still an excellent collection of high definition films and a great value for around $100.",1450310400,3,2678,4.619747899159663

7333868,5,B011KG2G5O,"The Ultimate James Bond Collection is at least the 3rd James Bond collection on Blu-Ray (The Bond50 set, the James Bond Collection and now ""The Ultimate James Bond Collection"")

BOX/PACKAGING: The set comes in  a black slipcase which goes over a white slipcase. Each slipcase has a nice ""The Ultimate James Bond Collection"" spine, allowing you to display it as either the blackslipcase or the white slipcase, if you have a preference. Seems like a small thing, but it's actually nice.
Inside the white slipcase are 3 Blu-Ray cases -- these are REAL blu-ray cases, not cardboard sleeves, paper sleeves, digibooks, etc.. they're multi-disc Blu-Ray cases. Also inside the box is a booklet of all the James Bond poster-arts (US and International) - the booklet is just over 50 pages and a nice bonus.
The 3 Blu-Ray cases are:
1962 - 1977 (contains: Dr. No, From Russia with love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, On her majesty's secret service, Diamonds are forever, Live and let die, The man with the golden gun, The spy who loved me)
1979 - 2002 (Contains Moonraker, For your eyes only, Octopussy, A view to a kill, The living daylights, License to kill, Goldeneye, Tomorrow never dies, The world is not enough, Die another day)
2006 - 2015 (contains: Casino Royale, Quantul of Solace, Skyfall, Spectre (NOT INCLUDED, JUST A SPACER))
Inside each case are the discs only. There is no cover art, inserts, etc..
For Spectre, the ""disc"" is a paper disc which is to be used as a placeholder for when Spectre releases (you must buy it separately and place it into the case)
The discs themselves are very plain, but it keeps them uniform. It would be nice if there was an insert in each case, or something to get a quick photo from the movie (rather than looking through the included poster book, but that's a minor gripe)
Inside the last case (2006 - 2015) is a brand new Bonus Disc with about 90 minutes of new material which I believe is exclusive to this set.
This set is nice as it will fit on a Blu-Ray storage shelf, unlike a lot of special edition boxes which are oversized and too large.
Lastly, included is 1 Ultraviolet code which unlocks all 23 films.

Note: Apparently there was another Bond film titled ""Never say never again"" which is not included - I've heard that this is due to some dispute and it not being considered an ""Official"" james bond film, but i feel it's worth noting.

Extras: This was a bit surprising. Each film is on 1 disc. Some of these were originally released as a 2-disc collectors edition. From what I can tell (at least with Casino Royale) all of the features from the 2-disc set are included on the single disc. I didn't notice a hit to quality, but some others might.
Additionally, a bonus disc is included (only available in this set) along with a 90 minute documentary and a few other extras.

Video/Audio: These will vary from film to film. With the films spanning 50 years, the quality is very nice. I was surprised to see the attention put into the older titles to bring them up to Blu-Ray standards. Audio was also good throughout the set with no noticeable issues.

Other notes: Included is the entire Bond collection (so far..) - unfortunately, they released this title before Spectre was released on Blu-Ray, but were nice enough to include a blank spot for it in the case. I'm happy for that. Unfortunately, because they're still making new Bond films, this will only be the ""Ultimate Collection"" until they re-release it with the newer films or more extras. Remember, this is already the 3rd James Bond Collection released on Blu-Ray in the last few years.

Overall, this is a great set. I will say that I purchased it when it was on sale for about 1/3 of the MSRP, and for that it's definitely worth it. I already owned a handful of the Bond films but it was cheaper to buy this than the individual releases to complete the set. It also comes in a nice package, fits on a shelf, includes new features and has an Ultraviolet copy of everything (for those who care).

This is one set of films that they actually cared about when bringing to Blu-Ray. This isn't just a cheap cash-grab where the quality is poor or there are no extras, they actually put something into them to make it ""High Def Worthy"" and for that I give it 5 stars.

I've never seen some of these, so getting the Blu-Ray was a great way to experience them. Highly recommended.",1449964800,,4379,4.582375478927203
7333869,4,B011KG2G5O,"A great set to coincide with the latest Bond movie, which fits nicely on the shelf unlike the odd shaped Bond 50. This current version appears to have two different types, a white and black box set with the difference appearing to be no book and no digital copies on the white edition, but retails $50 cheaper. The digital copies are Ultraviolet and no iTunes, so a separate account with Flixster or Vudu is required to watch these. If playing back on iOS, Flixster now has HD playback, but I initially had problems playing Goldeneye, but could with Vudu in SD (the joys of Ultraviolet). Like the previous versions, a slot has been added to the set for the upcoming movie, which is a neat idea.
Quality is excellent on both digital and optical, but hasn't changed since the first Blu-Ray 3 set collection back in 2008, having been given the 4K Lowry digital restoration back in 2006 and released on the Ultimate DVD editions.
The booklet is a nice feature, showing movie posters for all the movies including Spectre, but that poster spans across two pages and is completely ruined by the crease in the book.
For the retail price, it's not really a great deal seeing as most of the discs are looking at their third time of being reissued, but I got my set on Black Friday weekend for $89.99. My advice, hold out for the sales.",1449878400,10,1325,4.525

There were already a handful of other digital titles that I had which required me to already have one anyway. Seriously, so what if you also have Flixter or Vudu on your iPad or iPhone.

These movies look fantastic! The company that did the remastering is the best in the business and MGM gave them the actual film to do the work. This is a HUGE deal and led to the best possible enhancement of the older movies. I have some other blu-ray Bond movies that don't look anywhere near as good as these. The process is painstakingly long and they really did a phenomenal job.  There are also very cool extras on each disc. On Dr. No they actually have a featurette where they explain how they did these remasters. Very fun facts and information. Included with this set is also a booklet which shows all the movie posters they released for each movie, and world wide too.

So if you are a Bond fanatic and want to see the old gems along with the new, in the best quality possible, look no further. They even left a spot for Spector when it releases on Blu-ray next year.
