8071722,5,B000A0QIUQ,"When I was a kid, this Survivor Series was one of my favorite VHS and still is.
It happened at a time when the then WWF was jampacked with original characters and talents.
This Survivor Series had participants with awesome names such as ""Undertaker"", ""Legion of Doom"", ""Ultimate Warrior"", ""Hulk"", ""Earthquake"". In brief, nothing but characters coming straight from another world. They made pro-wrestling so fun and exciting. Real-life heroes. Nowadays none of this magic exists in the same wrestling promotion.
This Survivor Series differed from others because it had a grand finale, in which all survivors participated.",1353801600,,620,5.336734693877551
8071723,3,B000A0QIUQ,"The Warriors-The Perfect Team match was not great but pretty good. The Million Dollar Team-The Dream Team match was a short but sweet. The Visionaries-The Vipers match was nothing more then a one-sided flop. The Hulkmaniacs-The Natural Disasters match while not a bad bout,it had an ending of Hogan winning that you could see coming a mile away. The Allance-The Mercenaries match was also not great but pretty good with ending that leaves a sour taste in your mouth. The Grand Finale Of Survival match was nothing more then a mindless filler. The Debut of The Gobbledy Gooker was nothing more then a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"". I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1279497600,,661,4.706896551724138
8071724,3,B000A0QIUQ,"On Thanksgiving Day in 1990, the WWF presented its fourth annual Survivor Series pay-per-view from Hartford, CT.  This would be the last time the entire event featured all elimination matches (including the only ""Final Survivor"" match).  The stellar match line-up should have perhaps been the best card yet in this series.  Unfortunately, so many improbably easy eliminations this time made it clear that, with the exception of Bret Hart and Ted DiBiase, no one else apparently cared about giving a sincere effort.  Yes, it's true that the necessary build-up for the main event was an obvious factor for the abbreviated matches, but the overall match quality is still decent at best.

Match 1: The Warriors (I-C Champion Kerry von Erich, the Road Warriors, & WWF Champion Ultimate Warrior) vs. the Perfect Team (Curt Hennig & Demolition)

This kick-off match, in terms of sheer star power, should have no doubt stolen the show.  Instead, all you'll get is a generic, short-lived brawl, which comes down to Curt Hennig facing off against both champions.  It's no shocker who the winner will ultimately be (yes, pun intended).  Now, if Randy Savage (in a hideous, candy cane-striped outfit during his solo interview segment) had substituted for the immobile Ax, this one could have easily been salvaged.  At any rate, the WWF champ moves on to the finale.
Rating: 3/5 (disappointing)

Match 2: The Dream Team (WWF Tag Team Champions The Hart Foundation, Dusty Rhodes, & Koko B. Ware. vs. The Million $ Team (Ted DiBiase, Rhythm & Blues, & the Undertaker)

Future WWF champion Bret Hart vs. Ted DiBiase salvage a mostly terrible match with a dazzling climax (in honor of Hart's late brother, Dean, who had passed away the day before).  The Undertaker also makes his grand debut here easily blowing past Rhodes, Neidhart, and Ware.  In the end, DiBiase snags the victory over a dejected Hart to become the first villain in the main event.
Rating: 5/5 (for Hart and DiBiase) & 2/5 (for everyone else)

Match 3: The Hulkamaniacs (Hulk Hogan, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Big Bossman, & Tugboat) vs. The Natural Disasters (Earthquake, Barbarian, Haku, & Dino Bravo)

The late Big Bossman (Ray Traylor), despite a relatively brief appearance, demonstrates how underrated he was by exhibiting the most talent for his team.  Otherwise, this match only serves to remind fans that Hulk Hogan and the Warrior are sharing the spotlight this evening.  To the shock of no one, only Hogan (just going through the motions) survives to join the Warrior's team later on.
Rating: 3/5 (old school Hogan, enough said)

Match 4:

The Vipers (Jake Roberts, Jimmy Snuka, & the Rockers) vs. the Visionaries (Rick Martel, Warlord, and Power & Glory)

The Rockers' high-octane entertainment value is completely wasted here, as the match deteriorates into a boring squash.  The end result is that Roberts opts to lose by count-out vs. facing all four Visionaries.  Martel and his cronies advance to join DiBiase in the finale.
Rating: 2/5 (worth watching once, if that)

Match 5: The Alliance (Tito Santana, Nikolai Volkoff, & the Bushwhackers) vs. The Mercenaries (Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, & the Orient Express)

There's nothing like saving the least interesting and worst match for last.  Santana surprisingly escapes this groaner with a DQ win over Slaughter to become the last member of Hogan and Warrior's main event squad.  The incendiary build-up for Slaughter's upcoming win over the Warrior for the WWF title (at Royal Rumble 1990) continues.
Rating: 1/5 (not worth watching the first time)

Match 6: Hulk Hogan, WWF Champion the Ultimate Warrior, & Tito Santana vs. Rick Martel, the Warlord, Power & Glory, & Ted DiBiase

In a 5-on-3 handicap match, the only surprise is really how fast the Warlord vanishes, as Santana quickly follows behind him.  From there on, you already know what will happen - it's that predictable.  Even really talented guys like DiBiase and Martel can only squeeze so much from such an unimaginative, one-dimensional script.  The clichd ending (i.e. how easily the villains are bumped off) demonstrates what happens when the WWF creative team takes the night off.
Rating: 2.5/5 (a great concept for a finale fails to impress; still, it's mildly entertaining)

Despite several great opportunities, this show is mostly a dud for adults, especially since commentators Roddy Piper & Gorilla Monsoon both were off their game.  Further, all the Gulf War-related comments by Slaughter & others (such as Piper) were certainly in bad taste, as they treated the war (and its politics) like it was just another of Vince McMahon's juvenile storylines.  Then again, considering how virtually every wrestler was sleepwalking through this show, it's no wonder why the 4th Annual Survivor Series is synonymous with stale turkey.

Final Rating: a weak 3/5 (See my last comments below to explain my final rating).

P.S.  I'm not even going to bother trying to decipher the WWF's reasoning behind a moronic (and seemingly endless) time killer featuring ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund dancing in the ring with Hector Guerrero (how I pitied him) dressed up in a ridiculous turkey suit.  Don't even bother with this segment - the WWF truly hit a new low insulting viewers with this stupidity.",1272412800,,5262,5.053302433371958
8071725,4,B000A0QIUQ,"The Warriors- Ultimate Warrior, Texas Tornado, and Road Warriors VS The Perfect Team- Mr Perfect and Demolition: A pretty good, short match up with Warrior is the sole survivor.

The Million Dollar Team- Ted Dibiase, The Undertaker, Honky Tonk Man, and Greg Valentine VS The Dream Team- Dusty Rhodes, Koko B.Ware and The Hart Foundation: The Undertaker makes his debut and starts him squaring off against Bret Hart. Taker is impressive but gets counted out as he fights Dusty Rhodes. Bret Hart and DiBiase have a classic four minute encounter with DiBiase scoring the pin fall in the end.

The Visionaries- Rick Martel, Warlord, Hercules and Paul Roma VS The Vipers-Jake Roberts, Jimmy Snuka, and The Rockers: One of Robert's shining moments as his team gets eliminated and he has to fight four men by himself. He is apparently blind in one eye because of Martel. Roberts hits a ddt on Warlord but chases Martel as he tried to blind him in his good eye. Stupid ending and i've noticed alot of pointless eliminations via count out on early Survivor Series PPV's. This is the first time a whole survives.

The Hulkamaniacs- Hulk Hogan, Jim Duggan, Big Bossman and Tugboat VS The Natural Disasters- Earthquake, Haku, Dino Bravo and The Barbarian: A decent little match and Tugboat doesnt get into the match till the end. Anther stupid, pointless count out as Hogan pulls Earthquake out for no reason. Hogan then gets beat on by Barbarian and then pulls off a miracle win, yea right. Hogan needs to learn how to take a dive as anther reviewer said.

The Allliance- Nickolai Volkoff, Tito Santanna and The Bushwackers VS The Mercenaries-Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and The Orient Express: I skipped this match because I could really careless about any man in this event.

Hogan, Warrior, and Santana VS Martel, Power and Glory, Warlord, and Ted DiBiase: A fairly short main event as Santana pins Warlord in seconds. Power and Glory hit there very impressive finishing move on Hogan but he no sold it, come on Hogan! Warrior could have easily handled himself. A short but fun main event.

Overall, the matches were pretty good but i'm starting to notice the pointless count out during each match. The Undertaker debut was awesome to watch even though it, not surprisingly, ended on count out.",1257984000,,2288,4.8538461538461535
8071726,5,B000A0QIUQ,"The Survivor Series at this point in time just kept getting better each year as the matches were all solid but this one was the best one yet as of this time when they debuted three new concepts...one of which turned out to be one of the greatest investments in the history of the WWE.

Warriors vs. Perfect Team: The Ultimate Warriors: WWF Champion The Ultimate Warrior, WWF Intercontinental Champion ""Texas Tornado"" Kerry Von Erich, & The Legion of Doom (Hawk & Animal) vs. Mr. Perfect & Demolition (Ax, Smash, & Crush) - This was solid but there was really nothing special here at this time past the LOD/Demolition confrontation which long time fans of both WWF & NWA/AWA/WCW were waiting to see.

Dream Team vs. Million $ Team: The Million Dollar Team: ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase, The Undertaker, & Rhythm & Blues (The Honky Tonk Man & Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine) vs. ""American Dream"" Dusty Rhodes, Koko B. Ware, & WWF Tag Team Champions The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart & Jim Neidhart) - This was debut of a pale skinned Mark Callous...also known as The Undertaker.  Seeing Taker dominate in this match was the real highlight here along with the battle between Bret Hart & Ted Dibiase at the end of the match.  Bret really showed signs of the superstar he could (and eventually would) be at the end of this match.

The Visionaries vs. The Vipers: Rick ""The Model"" Martel, The Warlord, & Power & Glory (Paul Roma & Hercules) vs. Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka, & The Rockers (Shawn Michaels & Marty Jannetty) - This was just another good match that really didn't have a standout moment past the continued buildup to Jake The Snake vs. Rick Martel for WrestleMania & fact that this was the first time in history that an entire team survived...sorry Jerry Lawler, but Team DX at the 2006 S. Series were not the first team to have no eliminations.

The Hulkamaniacs vs. The Natural Disasters: Hulk Hogan, Big Boss Man, Tugboat, & ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan vs. Earthquake, Dino Bravo, Haku, & The Barbarian - Just another solid match here but nothing really noteworthy.

The Alliance vs. The Mercenaries: Nikolai Volkoff, Tito Santana, & The Bushwhackers (Luke & Butch) vs. Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, & The Orient Express (Sato & Tanaka) - I think the purpose of this match was to make Sgt. Slaughter look strong since he would become the WWF champion within the next two months.  Slaughter's entire team was eliminated leaving him byhimself before he eliminated 3 of the Alliance team members leaving him & Tito Santana left before Sarge got disqualified.  This was a guilty pleasure for me personally to see Tito Santana be a sole survivor.

Here comes the second new concept of the night...the hatching of the Survivor Series egg.  It was built up for weeks that the egg was going to hatch but nobody knew what was coming out of it that night.  It turned out to be a new WWF character called the Gooblygooker (Hector Guerrero) and the crowd booed the character out the building while he into the ring & danced with Mean Gene Okerland.

And the last new concept of the night was all the survivors coming back for a Grand Finale match.  Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, & Tito Santana vs. ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase, Rick ""The Model"" Martel, The Warlord, & Power & Glory (Paul Roma & Hercules) - This was a match to give the fans a happy way to end the night by having the two biggest babyfaces win the final match & make both guys look strong headed into their future fueds while teasing the rumored rematch between the two at WrestleMania (which didn't happen).  Overall, the match was again good but nothing really memorable past what I just mentioned.

Overall, this was an old school WWF event where they just concentrated on wrestling which made it a fun event that I highly recommend.",1172793600,,3819,4.677611940298507
