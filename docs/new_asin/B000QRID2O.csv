8197169,3,B000QRID2O,"Clint,the nevadas loner ,is an italian western from the mid sixties that carefully copies the look of the typical american western movies made in
the mid fifties. It is also in many ways, a remake of one of the most  famous westerns of that era,and of all times,Shane.
Clint,t. n .l is a good,dramatic film, with fine acting,aspecially George
Martin in the lead is great,and so is Marianne Koch as his tormented wife.
The score fits beutifully,the actionsequences are well made,and the cinema
tography is majestic(shot in supertechnirama70)

The other film on this dvd ""A noose is waiting for you,Trinity""is the
same story one more time,but with Klaus Kinski as a bountykiller out
to get clint(George Martin)Tough,actionpacked and well directed by
George Martin himself,it lacks the atmosphere and grandior of the first
film.

8197170,4,B000QRID2O,"The oddly titled Clint the Nevada's Loner (better known as Clint the Stranger) is a spaghetti western version of Shane. Because of this don't expect a Leone or Corbucci clone with this film. It's a little more tame when it comes to violence than other films in the spaghetti genre.

George Martin plays Clint, a man who abandon's his family because of his violent ways and returns for their forgiveness. After some time they welcome him back but he is tempted back to his violent ways with a corrupt mayor tries to take over their farm.

Overall the film has likeable characters (though not the typical anti-heroes found in spaghettis) and compently made with a fantastic shootout in a town towards the end. I found the film to be surprisingly good and it is a must for spaghetti western fanatics.

Also included on this DVD double feature is There's a Noose Waiting for you Trinity. This however is not a Trinity film (it was retitled this for some releases). It is actually a sequel to Clint the Stranger and is better known as The Return of Clint the Stranger. Oddly enough though this is not a direct sequel but more of a remake of the same story this time with star George Martin also directing. Sadly however this film is quit poor and lack tremenously to the original. Even the addition of Claus Kinski as a bounty hunter can't save this poorly directed and filmed sequel. Since it is a double feature you could consider it a bonus.

The DVD by Wild East is great. Thankfully their newer DVD releases lack the glitches and manufacturing errors their earlier DVDs contained. Clint the Nevada's Loner is the uncut version and some of dialoge tracks have been lost or never dubbed some some of the sequences are in German with English subtitles. Its a minor hindorence since this is the best version us fans are ever going to see. The sequel has a perfect transfer from a mint print, it's just sad it's a poor film.",1204934400,7,1919,4.569767441860465
