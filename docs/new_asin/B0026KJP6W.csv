3854234,5,B0026KJP6W,"I do miss the skits from MST3K. But I appreciate the creative song the team put on the menu screen.

If you are an MST3K fan, you'll love this episode of Rifftrax. The movie itself is so bad it's good (yes, it is the Citizen Kane of bad movies!).

I do wish Rifftrax would add some interviews or movie info features, even if that meant jacking up the price some. It does fell like it is MST3K without the gravy on top, still great stuff. All that being the case, it is a perfect movie for Rifftrax and a lot of laughs!

3854235,5,B0026KJP6W,"This movie is funny in and of itself, just because it's so bad it's good.  The addition of the Rifftrax commentary puts it over the edge into the hilarious category.  We especially liked that the DVD contains the movie with AND without the commentary, in case we wanted to watch it by itself.  We bought it to show at a party, and everyone there enjoyed it.  Even people who weren't previously familiar with MST3K still loved it.  I highly recommend this movie.",1259366400,,461,4.573170731707317

This is a hilarious commentary and if you're any fan of humor you must own this DVD.",1251158400,3,338,3.7746478873239435
3854238,5,B0026KJP6W,"Plan 9 from Outer Space is a movie I had seen many, many times on it's own over the years and found it to always be highly entertaining.  The Rifftrax jokes on top add further to the enjoymant of this ""fine"" film.  I watched this with a group of people who had not seen the original movie and they liked it as much as I did-- it was like watching a really great episode of MST3K.

And I like that it is playable both with and without the Rifftrax commentary as I will likely watch this movie without them as well.",1248912000,16,513,4.0594059405940595

This is the first Rifftrax I've watched.  I think they're dead on with the commentary.  Looking forward to getting more.",1243987200,17,316,4.777777777777778
3854240,2,B0026KJP6W,"As a HUGE fan of MST3K, I've followed most of the cast in their various post-MST projects. I loved the 4 ""Film Crew"" DVD's and highly recommend those to anyone who enjoyed the Mike Era of MST3K. I was hoping that the Rifftrax version of ""Plan 9"" would follow suit. I ordered this DVD through the Rifftrax site which has it, as well as the other DVD's immediately available.

Maybe it's almost too easy to tear apart ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". While I did get a few chuckles here and there with the commentary provided by Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy...it didn't really live up to expectation. For the most part they avoided quite a few of the ""obvious"" jokes (awful Ed Wood dialog, scenes switching from night to day back to night again, cardboard tombstones, etc) but, it felt as though too many jokes were left unsaid.

I really enjoy Mike Nelson's comedy, and while ""Plan 9"" didn't live up to expectation, I do plan on purchasing the other ""3 Riffer"" versions of ""Killers From Space"", ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" too. If you are interested in checking out Rifftrax, or seeing how it compares to MST3K or Film Crew (or even Cinematic Titanic), then I highly recommend ""Rifftrax Shorts: Vol. 1"" in place of ""Plan 9"". ""Shorts Vol. 1"" lives up to the comedy high-water mark that MST3K created, and will have you chuckling for a solid 90 minutes.

On the bonus side, this Rifftrax DVD does come with an un-riffed version of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", which was worth the price of the disk for me. I didn't own a clean DVD version of the film before purchasing the Rifftrax disk, and now am glad I have a decent copy.",1242604800,17,1656,4.47682119205298
3854241,5,B0026KJP6W,"Deluxe version. You can watch it in (restored) black and white, colour, with or without Mike's commentary - it's a cornucopia of silly fun.

Anyway, there are few pleasures in this world as fantastic as watching someone who really enjoys what they do. The only difference here is, while Ed Wood loved his work, he wasn't good. However, RiffTrax riffers are both clearly enjoying themselves but also are very good at what they love.

3854254,2,B0026KJP6W,"The problem is when you riff something as bad as Plan Nine...that the 'regular movie' will be funnier than anything you can say about it. And that's the case here. I was really surprised at just how lame the riffing was. I think that people that 'loved' this liked 'Plan Nine' more so than anything the guys did. I only laughed out loud a couple of times - I'd say this was the worst RiffTrax I've watched or experienced live. I'll probably never bother watching it again, and I couldn't recommend anyone buying it. ANYThing I've heard on Rifftrax, Cinematic Titanic, The Film Crew, or MSTY is better than this one.

By the way, like another reviewer, I, too, received the wrong version...I got the 'Live' version. Perhaps the 'non-live one' is a lot funnier. I didn't think  much of the one I experienced.",1387238400,2,806,4.590277777777778
3854255,5,B0026KJP6W,I had to watch this movie a few times just to catch all the wise cracks by the Riff Trax team.  The movie itself was definately a 50's era sci-fi & horror.

3854256,5,B0026KJP6W,"Funny. A lot like an episode of MST3k. The live version has extras like the song about why the other 8 plan's didn't work. This is a funny movie anyway, the commentary is just what you're thinking when you're watching it, like when the pilot is sworn to secrecy about the ufo so he immediately goes home and tells his wife all about it.

I just remember being horrified ... that anyone could make such awful movies!  My friend said I was crazy for renting them, but these things are SOOOOOOOOO bad, you can't help but not watch.  So, having a good Rifftrax group to poke fun at the incessant plot-holes, bad acting, cheap crappy sets, and pretty much everything else in the film is pretty much the ONLY good way to watch something this rotten.  Thankfully, half the crew of the SoL are here to do just that.  Buy it.  Watch it.  Love it.",1356998400,2,609,4.423423423423423
3854260,5,B0026KJP6W,"Soo bad it is good.  Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space was a crowning achievement in attempting to stretch a budget of non-existence.  His favorite actor Bela Lugosi dies while filming and they use Wood's wife's dental hygienist who is a clear foot taller and younger.  Tor Johnson is just enormous as ""Inspector"" Don Clay and L.A. last I recall does not have an Inspector class to their detectives.  Boom mic a plenty seen and strings on the flying saucers very visible. Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett formerly of Mystery Science Theater 3000 lay into what is described as one of the worse movies ever created.  With or without their track you will get a good chuckle going.  Have a bad movie night as this as your starter!",1339027200,,736,4.580152671755725
3854261,5,B0026KJP6W,"I have a confession to make: I love Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" It's one of those bad movies that is so beautifully consistent, so weird, so utterly bafflingly WRONG that it ends up being the PERFECT bad movie. Few movies are as perfectly suited to snark.

And few people are as perfectly suited to do that than the guys who brought us Mystery Science Theater 3000. Well, there aren't any robots in this, but we do get three guys making relentless fun of the movie. ""RiffTrax: Plan 9 From Outer Space"" does what most people do when confronted by a terrible film:

The plot is actually a bit baffling at first. Flying saucers are buzzing a random American town, but the military is pretending that they don't exist because... actually, I'm not sure why they're being this stupid. After all, it's not as if the military denials keep PEOPLE from seeing it.

 So the aliens (Dudley Manlove, John Breckenridge) implement Plan 9: raising the dead (Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson, Vampira) as zombies, and sending them out to attack people.... very slowly. Only an intrepid (read: bumbling) trio of humans will be able to infiltrate the flying saucer, and discover why the aliens have come to Earth.

""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is one of those movies like ""Birdemic,"" ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" and ""Troll 2"" -- it is so bad that somehow it ends up being entertaining. The MST3K guys did a lot of movies like that (including other Ed Wood movies), so it feels incredibly natural that they would unleash their snark on this one.

Basically it's just three guys sitting there, making fun of an old movie -- the cast (""You know, you name your son 'Dudley Manlove' and you pretty much guarantee he'll have a huge presence as the Folsom Street Fair""), the flimsy sets (""We'll be okay if the plywood controls hold out!""), and the ghastly script (they mostly just giggle through Ed Wood's pseudoscience).

Anyone who enjoyed the legendary ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" will adore ""RiffTrax: Plan 9 From Outer Space"" -- it's a movie so bad it's funny, mocked by guys who are simply funny.",1330646400,,2085,4.695890410958904
3854262,5,B0026KJP6W,This movie is a real snore but the riffing comments make it worth seeing.  Just like hearing the MST3k puppets' comments without the puppets.  I still miss MST3k but Rifftrax is almost as good.,1323734400,,193,4.647058823529412
3854263,5,B0026KJP6W,"Ed Wood has been a favorite target of many people as his films while fun were just very inept and all over the place. MST3K slammed a few of his famed films during their run on TV including ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""The Sinister Urge"" and the commentary they provided was very funny but for some reason ""Plan 9"" eluded the guys of MST3K.

Thankfully Rifftrax has brought their brand of commentary and jokes to what has been dubbed ""The Worst Film of All Time"", Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy take to task making fun of all the obvious mistakes and bad acting in Plan 9, the horrid editing, the terrible day for night or night for day changes from one scene to another and many other problems throughout the movie.

Anyone who has seen the movie on its own knows its funny just as it is, but with the Rifftrax crew its hilarious. The constant jokes about Bela Lugosi, his addictions and the terrible attempt to use a stunt double for Bela through much of the film are some of their best work. I personally enjoyed the Tor Johnson riffs and pop culture references make this one of the best from the guys and its well worth having as this is the perfect type of film that deserves a good harsh riffing.",1321142400,9,1213,4.3628318584070795
3854264,4,B0026KJP6W,"Ed Wood's masterpiece, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" has long been famous for being the ""Worst Movie Ever Made.""  That accolade was given the film long before MST3k revealed such cinematic travesties as ""Manos the hands of fate"" or such bewildering directors as Coleman Francis.

Truthfully, ""Plan 9"" IS a bad movie, but a more accurate award would be ""Most Unintentionally Entertaining Bad Movie"" as all the continuity errors, low budget effects, bad dialogue, incredible plot holes, etc. come so fast and furious you'd swear someone made this film intending it to be a comedy.  Sadly, no, the people involved really did intend a serious drama, they just failed every single step of the way.

As is, its a movie that's incredibly funny on its own.  With RiffTrax its even funnier.  Mike, Kevin and Bill do a great job, and even though I've seen the movie on its own about a dozen times, some of their jokes actually pointed out things I had missed during all those previous viewings.

Also, since you can play ""Plan 9"" with the commentary off, I was able to sell my previous DVD copy of the film, as the print on this DVD is very crisp, actually better than my standalone DVD.

So if you're a fan of MST3k, check it out.  If you've never seen ""Plan 9"" before, please watch the movie WITHOUT the commentary first.  You won't believe your eyes.",1313625600,6,1340,4.616033755274262
3854265,5,B0026KJP6W,"Thank you, guys!  Ed Wood movies don't even need riffing, but you just have to do it!  And Plan 9 certainly doesn't disappoint!

I love to watch ""Ed Wood"", then watch ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" immediately afterward.  When I received the Rifftrax version recently, it was classic!!!  The bad acting, cheezy plot, cheap props...the riffing almost writes itself!  I have done my own riffing on this movie, and wondered what the riffboys would do with it.

I nearly blew my drink out my nose when, during the funeral scene, a somber Bela Legosi zones out, and Mike says ""and you can see the heroin kick in riiiiiiight.....now"".

It truly is the WORST movie ever made and the Rifftrax gang makes it even MORE funny than it was never intended (by the original Director, Writer, Producer, Cinematographer hmmm... did I leave anything out Mr. Ed. D. Wood Jr.).  I highly recommend that anybody who needs an MSK3K style laugh pick up this movie and watch it but don't get too overly cerebral with it because these guys who did the original don't have two working brain cells to rub together if you know what I mean (as evidenced by the lead headlining dead guy Bela, again nuff said).

Rifftrax makes it hilarious.  I was laughing like an idiot, nonstop.  You can actually see the strings of the flying saucers!  The ultimate reason for the aliens' actions is so ridiculous that I wondered if Ed Wood had even attended elementary school.  (Basic science blows it apart.  Ever hear of photons?)  The hugely fat police chief/reanimated corpse is a baffling choice.  Vampira as the late wife of Bela Lugosi was the worst possible casting, and the best for laughing at.

8352919,5,B0026KJP6W,"Okay, I'm a big Ed Wood fan. I think the man was a genius and one good guy. I am not blind to the fact that his ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is low-budget film-making riddled with discontinuity and rather embarrassing dialogue. Still, it has stood the test of time for it has 'heart'. It was a work of love for our boy, Edward. Since the movie was (unintentionally) funny to begin with, I thought the riffing might play as a battle between it and the already inane dialogue and story... and quality of the physical scenes, but I was happily incorrect (and glad of it). The riffing compliments the unintentional humor of the movie, as well as adds humor to the almost normal scenes of the film. It is no battle of words between the movie and the riffing. Instead it turned-out to be a marriage. A marriage made in an insane asylum perhaps, but a good and loving marriage nonetheless. And we know how rare that is these days. Full of hilarious comments and bantering, this is another Rifftrax masterpiece. And, yes... I watch this one over-and-over, too. As is the custom, our friends at Rifftrax have provided us with a menu which allows us to select the non-riffed version of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' and the riffed version. Thank you, Rifftrax gang. And again... my brother received a copy of this from me. And, no... I did not give him my copy. No one gets my copies of Rifftrax dvds. No One! And, yes... he got the usual threat that he had better watch the dvd. Although I am older than he, he is taller and stronger, so my threats can only go so far. Sad, really. Well, if you want to have some laughs, alone or with any family that still claims you, this is one great Rifftrax movie to watch. Halloween is coming up soon, you know.
