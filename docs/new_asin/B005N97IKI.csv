4845217,4,B005N97IKI,"Fast-paced and great for kids. Short clips which follow one another, and should keep the attention of any train-lovin' kid. I know my grandson was spellbound the entire time. Just a ton of video shots of model trains and a driving soundtrack...what more could you ask for?",1338336000,3,272,4.808510638297872
4845218,5,B005N97IKI,"I purchased this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old nephew...he's crazy for trains. He absolutely loves this DVD. The ""Alphabet Train"" song is really cute and catchy. I first saw it on youtube and decided to buy the DVD because he kept asking to see it. He loves the intro song ""Little Toy Trains"" and loves the Halloween train segment. Some of the model trains have really amazing setups...one has free-flowing water. It's very elaborate! This is definitely a must by for anyone with a little one that is a train fan. Definitely worth the money!",1337644800,3,537,4.546391752577319

8480285,1,B005N97IKI,We have 5 dvd's players and some times they will work in one.  The next day they won't work in that one but will work in another one.  One time we stopped it in the middle of the dvd and came back to rewatch it an hour later and it said invalid disk.  We hadn't even taken it out of the player and could not get it work. It's not our dvd player's because it does not do this with other dvd's.,1340409600,2,392,3.7560975609756095
