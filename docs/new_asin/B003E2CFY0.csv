I had a small issue resolved by myself. The CD initially showed an error message on my laptop. I closed everything and rebooted. That did not work; so I changed the program to open it with. That worked. But I also had to blow out ITunes- that was causing the problem. I opened with Windows Media, allowed time for the music to start, then went to library. The picture of the album was not there. I clicked on update album info-- music info. Once at the sight, I found the right cover, but the site needed to be updated, so I updated the site, and then was able to refresh, and the pic showed on my computer.

I am happy with the product.

Happy with the seller- they delivered. Thank you",1418515200,,748,4.216783216783217
8395225,4,B003E2CFY0,"This film was a revelation, for what we regard as Irish ""traditional"" music, its bands, its sound and arrangements, is a development over the past 40 years. And its innovation came from the Irish diaspora back to the motherland. The country fiddle tunes and ballads persisted, of course, against the forces of religious zealotry and British assimilation, but Galic was becoming a quaint, almost forgotten language and people had disparaged the old music of poverty. Then in America, with the rising folk song fad of the late 1950s and early 1960s, a thirst among those of Irish heritage and recent emigres arose. The Clancy Brothers with Tommy Makem caught the ears of American audiences, with the help of Ed Sullivan, and the old songs became respectable. Soon, back in Ireland, The Chieftains, adopting the quasi classical orchestration of traditional instruments advocated by composer Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riada and musicologist Garech Domnagh Browne, became a popular group. As the documentary unfolds, we learn of the group Planxty and of subsequent developments in Ireland as musicians adopt and fuse rock (Van Morrison and U2), punk (the Pogues), and New Age (Enya) and how Riverdance arose with Irish-American dancer Michael Flatley. Interviews with musicians and old video clips help this history. It is a grand tale and it demonstrates how vibrant Irish music remains as it moves into various musical genre and venues. The film was shown on PBS in spring 2010 and a second volume is forthcoming with focus on contemporary groups. [New DVDs, with and without the musical CD, are distributed elsewhere at this time.]",1274054400,4,1624,5.178707224334601
