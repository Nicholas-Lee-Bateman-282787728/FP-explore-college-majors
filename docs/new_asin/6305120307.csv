7885084,1,6305120307,I enjoy most things Irish and a good 'troubles' movie. Skip this one and save your money-just couldn't buy the plot/acting.,1204329600,,123,4.904761904761905
7885085,4,6305120307,I enjoyed this movie altho I found  one of the principal actors a bit to affected to be believable. JAMES BROLIN does a fine job as a first time  director as well as taking the lead role .PATRICK FOY  does well as the reluctant hero and GARY COOK as the IRA head is well cast. The only problem I had was that it was a bit cliched but then it is getting more and more difficult to come up with and original idea no matter what the story. Watch out for the BILL MURPHY cameo. He plays paddy kelly an IRA activist with the fire of freedom burning in his belly. Stunning scene.,975024000,2,573,4.053097345132743
7885086,1,6305120307,"The only reason we bothered renting this movie is becuase our friend has been making fun of it in the past two weeks (by the way, he found in the Blockbuster dumpster).  It exceeded our expectations and is probably the  most unintentionally hilarious movie we have ever seen.  How can you not  laugh every time James Brolin enters the screen?  Plus, why did Josh Brolin  get a billing when he was only in the movie for 2 1/2 minutes?",953337600,5,433,4.417721518987341
7885087,4,6305120307,plot was very cleverly layed out and characters seemed to have depth. not too bloody even though the subject matter is very riviting.,933811200,,133,4.826086956521739
