5560243,5,B00B74MJOS,"THE IMPOSSIBLE is one of the more viscerally gripping movies of 2012. It has enough problems to prevent me from calling it great...but it is nonetheless a ""must-see.""

The great tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands of people in 2006 was one of the greatest disasters of modern times. But as we often do, we tend to forget these things over time...but surely such an event was worthy of remembering via cinema, which is one of our greatest ways of remembering the past...imperfect though those recollections may be. When this great wave hit the coast of Thailand (and many other countries), there was literally no warning. People stood dumbfounded and amazed as an unfathomably huge wall of water wiped everything out of its path. Lives were snuffed out in an instant and dank misery was left everywhere in its wake.

THE IMPOSSIBLE tells us just a tiny portion of this epic disaster, as seen through the eyes of one family: Henry, Maria and their 3 young sons (it's based on a true story and a real family). This is a happy, comfortably upper-middle class family that has come to the coast of Thailand over the Christmas holidays. The kids squabble a little bit, but other than this, we see no hint that this isn't a perfect family. We like them immediately during the few minutes we are allowed to get to know them. Then on December 26th, they are playing around their resort pool when suddenly they hear a loud noise. Within seconds, water is bearing down on them...and because they've had just enough time to see that this water can take down entire palm trees with nary a pause...they know they are in trouble. The only thought is to grab the kids and duck.

Maria (Naomi Watts) is badly injured in the ensuing flood, and is briefly all alone. She reunites with her oldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) and the two of them share wretched travels together before they arrive at a hugely overcrowded and overwhelmed hospital. They believe they are the only survivors of their family.

Although the trailers of the film give away much more, I hesitate to do so just in case you haven't seen them. The plot developments are very important, of course, and JA Bayona keeps the tension high. He's best known to US audiences for this Spanish ghost story THE ORPHANAGE, and he does know the value of restraint. This film is actually, remarkably, PG-13...which means much is left to the imagination. We see little gore and death (compared to what our jaded sensibilities are accustomed to), but we HEAR enough to fill in the blanks. Bayona realizes we ultimately care more about this family than we do the carnage, and he keeps his camera tight on them as they react to the horror around them. (This is not to say the movie is ""suitable"" for kids...but I think teens and above SHOULD see this film. It's an important piece of modern history that deserves a respectful look.)

Three great things about this film. First, the special effects are truly special. We get huge shots of roiling waters and debris, with Watts and Hooper tossed about like tiny corks. HOW this was accomplished is beyond my understanding, but it is completely and utterly convincing. While we've certainly seen more ""spectacular"" destruction on films like 2112...this is the best ""realistic-scale"" mass destruction I've ever seen. The you-are-there feeling is pretty darn intense at times.

Second, the attention to little details of design is great. The hospital in Thailand, for example, has a floor simply awash in fluids of the victims. The grime everywhere feels very real and icky. You understand immediately how a disaster could turn a modern, well-run hospital into a cesspool of infection and disease. (As so often happens, many survivors of the initial assault will succumb to the horrible conditions of their care.)

Finally, the performances are first-rate. Ewan McGregor is a master of playing the nice guy, and we've seen this from him many times before. But he's got a couple of scenes where he nearly breaks down with emotion, and thus we're reminded that this guy has got serious, broad acting chops. Young Tom Holland is really special in his role...smart, scared, funny, fierce and fragile. And this works all the better, because most of his scenes are with the remarkable Naomi Watts. She gives one of the most PHYSICALLY powerful performances I've seen in ages, and certainly one of her best performances. It is through her that we feel the physical toll of this event. She gives a huge performance, but it never feels over-the-top. I've always been a fan of Watts, but we haven't seen much of her in recent years. Boy, is she back!

There is plenty to take issue with as well. I know this is a true story...but I suspect as with all ""true"" stories, some liberties have been taken with the details. A few plot developments, especially near the end, have too much of a Hollywood manipulation feel to them. As though it was felt even more tension was needed, it felt like events may have been embellished. And the point of focus for this story is certainly up for debate. Is picking a lovely, affluent white couple and following them, to the almost complete exclusion of the citizens of Thailand (who surely suffered greater loss) the best way to tell this story? Certainly, it's a compelling story, but since there won't be 20 different movies about the tsunami, but perhaps only this one (yes, I know there was a TV movie that no one saw), there is a danger that history will remember this event inaccurately. THE IMPOSSIBLE is yet another example of a primarily ""non-white"" event seen through the eyes of white characters.

That being said, I believe THE IMPOSSIBLE should be seen. While it isn't exactly a pleasant time at the movies, it is a well-crafted, well-acted and gripping time.",1363996800,,5775,4.767
5560244,2,B00B74MJOS,"The cinematography for this film is incredibly ugly. De-saturated colors with no detail in the lighter parts of the picture frame (= washed out), with a very ugly color scheme.

5560246,4,B00B74MJOS,"""The Impossible"" (2012 release; 113 min.) brings the story (based on true events) of the Bellon family vacationing in Thailand on the eve of the largest tsunami recorded in history (December 26, 2004). Maria (played by Naomi Watts) and Henry (played by Ewan McGregor) are with their 3 boys, ages 5 to 12. Fifteen minutes into the movie, and the tsunami hits. I have never seen anything like it before (blowing away any comparison to Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter""). The next 30 min. are some of the more harrowing I have seen in a movie in a long, long time. It is truly hard to describe the devastation that we get to witness. Maria and her 12 yr. old son Lucas (played by Tom Holland) are split off from the rest of their family, and try to hang on for dear life (literally). To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, the acting performance from Naomi Watts is superb, playing a heavily wounded/half-dead woman who nevertheless wants to do what she can to save her family. Newcomer Tom Holland as the 12 yr. old Lucas is very effective as well. Second, the photography of the movie is visually astonishing, creating images that will stay with me for quite some time. Third, interestingly this is not a American or British production, but in fact it is entirely Spanish, from the director (J.A. Bayona) on down, the entire crew is Spanish. Last but certainly not least, despite the scenes of the tsunami, this is not a 'disaster movie' but instead it is a tribute to the human spirit. It is in the most devastating and impossible of situations such as this tsunami where we see that so many strangers from many different countries nevertheless find a way to communicate and help each other out. In that sense, this is a very uplifting movie.

""The Impossible"" is a powerful movie that packs a lot of emotional wallop. I will admit to tearing up quite a few times in the movie. This movie is rated PG-13 but there is no way that I would take a 12 or 13 yr. old kid to see this. That aside, ""The Impossible"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1362528000,13,2148,4.533505154639175
5560247,3,B00B74MJOS,"""You've got to go and do something. Go help people, you're good at it."" This is a true story of a family that went on vacation to Thailand during the Christmas of 2004. The same time the massive tsunami struck. The family is separated and lost in a strange country wishing and hoping they will find each other again. First off I will say that this is very emotional so be prepared for that. Also I know Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar for this but the kid that played Lucas should have been the one who was nominated. As far as the movie goes it was good, and I know it is a true story but it was really just too unbelievable for me to really get into. When the super emotional parts happened I was thinking, yeah right rather then tearing up. That is just me and maybe I am heartless but I couldn't get past the totally ""impossible"" aspects of the movie. All that said though this is a good movie and if you can handle it I would say watch it. Overall, a good true story that was just a little to unbelievable for me to get fully invested in. I give it a B.",1362096000,6,1065,4.076190476190476
5560248,5,B00B74MJOS,"This epic film recounts one family's struggle to survive the massive tsunami coming out of the Indian Ocean in 2004, striking the luxurious beach front resorts of Thailand and into the inland areas. A Spanish production under the direction of Juan Antonio Bayona with a script from Sergio G. Sanchez, the real-life Spanish family is replaced by one from Britain headed by Henry (Ewan McGregor) and Maria (Naomi Watts).

They and their 3 boys, ranging in age from about 4 to 13, are swept up in the giant waves that hit the country the day after Christmas. Maria and the oldest boy Lucas (Tom Holland) are literally thrown together as the water takes them deep into the interior. The film follows them after the impact of the wave.

Speaking of the wave. This is one of the most dramatic and authentic disaster scenes I can remember. Yes, the thunderous wave hitting the resort is a marvelous example of what talented filmmakers can do, but the underwater shots of Lucas and his mother being tossed about along with bicycles, cars and furniture is indeed frightening and realistic. The story essentially shows the survival skills of an injured Maria (a non-practicing M.D.) and Lucas. Another follows Henry and the 2 younger boys (Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast) as they look for the rest of their family.

The performances are wonderful from everyone involved. McGregor has never been better as the rational but determined husband and father. I would hope Oscar would give some attention to Ms. Watts. In a performance that reminded me of John Hawkes in ""The Sessions,"" Watts must perform for the most part, laid out on a gurney or hospital bed. Her emotions and despair come from her facial expressions and her eyes. In a year filled with great performances from young actors, I would include Holland as the kid about to make a big leap toward manhood. I think most people will identify with Lucas while watching this film, hoping you would act like him or hope to have a child with his courage and conviction.

While impossible to keep tears at bay (even without some of the swelling violins), I found the film to be ultimately uplifting and enormously spellbinding. While I wouldn't expect a commercial film like this to necessarily focus on the more than a quarter million citizens killed, I did think a footnote at the end of the film would have been appropriate to highlight the severity of this tragedy.

The Blu ray version has a 1080p resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Audio options include a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  Subtitles are available for English (SDH) and Spanish.",1361750400,13,2608,4.821029082774049
5560249,5,B00B74MJOS,"I just saw The Impossible at the movies today. This film hasn't received the prestige treatment that others have in a year that has seen exceptional films, but it should have.
The movie starts with a family visiting a resort off the coast of Thailand during the Christmas holiday of 2004. The mother, father, and three sons seem unremarkable on the face of it. They are just nice though the viewer really never is given much insight into their lives prior to their vacation or the events that have preceded the day after Christmas. On December 26, 2004 the family is kicking back around the resort's pool after their Christmas celebration the night before.
In a moment that seems as unremarkable as the family itself, the ordinary is replaced by the surge of a wall of water guaranteed to horrify. A tsunami rushes in and destroys everything and everyone in a flash. As the family struggles against the surge they are separated. Thus begins a story of profound loss, survival, uncertainty, and lives that will inevitably impacted and changed forever. In the process there are gestures of sympathy and kindness, both large and small in their simplicity that echo the inherent goodness in people regardless of their age or position in life. As the family struggles to reunite with great uncertainty of what lies ahead, the viewer gets involved not only with the disaster and its inevitable horror but also with the human struggle to survive and also deal with loss.
I expected this to be a rough movie to watch. When this event occurred I was transfixed and depressed by what I saw on TV and knew what would follow. As this film played out, what surprised me was the there was an upside to the tragedy which was portrayed. The struggle to survive and the kindness of complete strangers was life affirming and spiritually uplifting. For me, using the device of a family in peril removed this from the category of disaster story to a human story that spoke for both the victims and the survivors of an unparalleled disaster in current times.
The special effects were very realistic. The photography as well as the pacing of this movie were just right. The acting in this movie was great. Naomi Watts was nominated for an Academy Award for a powerful performance as the mother Maria, but there were many fine performances in this movie. Ewan McGregor as Henry her husband and Tom Holland as the son Lucas who Maria struggles to save, contribute to elevating this story on a dramatic level. In fact, Tom Holland was absolutely remarkable.
This was a beautifully done film and one which will stay with me for a long time.",1361577600,8,2614,4.722100656455142
5560250,5,B00B74MJOS,"""The Impossible"" is an excellent film about one family's struggle to survive during a tsunami cataclysm that rocked our planet not so long ago. This excellent film sucked me into it's believably realistic and powerful story-line, holding me in my seat until it's satisfying end.

FACT: On Sunday, December 26, 2004 at 00:58:53 UTC in the Indian Ocean off the west coast of Sumatra, a sudden megathrust subduction (Earth is the only Planet where subduction is known to occur), undersea earthquake (magnitude 9.1-9.3) released century's of built up energy into the sea floor. This caused a rupture more then 600 miles long, displacing the seafloor above the rupture moving trillions of tons of rock that caused our entire planet to vibrate (shudder) as much as 1 centimeter (0.4 inches), and triggering other earthquakes as far away as Alaska. This displacement then sent enormous seawave swells across the Indian Ocean in every direction to surge onto land (up to 98 feet high), flooding and destroying everything in it's path. Anyone who survived this unexpected attack by mother nature was truly blessed.

Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona has created a masterpiece depicting the plight of a vacationing family of five (two parents and three adolescent boys), caught in one of our recent history's most harrowing catastrophes. This 2012 English-language Spanish disaster drama film is based on the true story (by Maria Belon and the screenplay is penned by Sergio G. Sanchez), of this family who were at the time of this disaster living in Japan and vacationing in Thailand at the time of the tsunami. This film was produced at ""Ciudad de la Luz"" Studios (City of Light Studios) in Spain. The terrifying tsunami sequence in this film makes you think and believe you are watching actual documentary footage of the real natural disaster that struck Asia that day killing hundreds of thousands. It's not. Director Boyona and his visual-and special effects supervisors worked on and planned for more than a year on exacting planning/experimentation for the flood scenes. They used a giant water tank in Spain (the largest in Europe) and a sprawling miniature of a beach resort. Then they added location shots in Thailand and some computer wizardry to create 10 minutes of cinematic terror for it's characters and us. The devastation is very realistic looking. Set Designer, Pilar Revuelta has done a brilliant job creating huge areas of devastation that the actors acted in the middle of.

Naomi Watts (British/Australian actress known for her role as Ann Darrow-(Beauty) in Peter Jackson's 2005 ""King Kong""), preforms the lead character role ""Maria"" who is the mother of three young boy's and wife to husband ""Henry"" preformed by Ewan McGregor (Scottish actor known for his role as Lincoln Six Echo/Tom Lincoln, in Michael Mann's 2005 ""The Island""). Her acting is superb. She deserves her Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, and I hope she wins. Naomi Watts spent two weeks in a water tank shooting grueling underwater scenes for this film. She convinced me that what she was going through on screen was totally real. I thought Naomi was going to die! I could almost feel her pain as I watched her character struggle to survive throughout this emotional film. Her performance as the determined, strong and resilient mother, fighting for her own life and that of her son ""Lucas"" (preformed by Tom Holland) from death by the huge tidal surge that threatens both of their lives...was amazing. Young actor Tom Holland did an excellent job carrying many scenes in this film.

Maria's husband Ewan McGregor's ""Henry"", does an excellent character performance depicting his soul wrenching shock, despair, and feelings of hopelessness while struggling to survive in the aftermath of the tsunami. Henry has a cell phone scene that depicts the darker side of human nature that sometimes does occur during this type of stressful event. Two cute little boy actors (Oaklee Pendergast-""Simon"", and Samuel Joslin-""Thomas""), were adorable and added a much needed levity to this tragic story line. I also enjoyed seeing Geraldine Page (British-American actress known for her role as Tonya in director David Lean's 1965 ""Doctor Zhivago), as the old woman who gives Lucas a soulful talk about the life and death of stars in the nights sky. This films original score is by Fernando Velazquez and the wonderful Cinematography is expertly handled by Oscar Faura.

I hate to use the words ""entertaining"" and ""enjoyable"" for this film, but they do apply. ""The Impossible"" is very good and very well done. I highly recommend this historically based film. Enjoy!

Historical side note: In 2004 at the time of this tsunami, only the Pacific Ocean had a tsunami warning system. This system of floating buoys called DART, was established in 1949 following the 1946 Aleutian Island Earthquake and the tsunami that resulted in 165 casualties in Hawaii and Alaska. Because of this event, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System was added to the Pacific Ocean Warning System extending it's coverage. It became active in late June 2006 consisting of 25 seismographic stations relaying information to 26 national Tsunami information centers, as well as three deep-ocean sensors.

On March 11, 2011 at 14:46:23 UTC, in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan another undersea megathrust subduction (magnitude 9.0) earthquake fractured the sea floor suddenly generating monster seawave swells that inundated Japans sea-level coastline. The Pacific Ocean Warning System did do it's job and is believed to have saved many lives, but this time the epicenter (70 kilometers (43 mi) off shore), was too close to land to be fully effective. Massive wave surges came flooding inland too fast to save everyone. Wave heights were up to 40.5 meters (133 feet) traveling inland 10km (6 miles) destroying everything in it's path. Chillingly this earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4m (8 feet) east and shifted the earth on it's axis by estimates of between 10cm (4 inches) and 25cm (10 inches).

The final death toll for the Indian Ocean Tsunami was a staggering 283,000. The death toll for 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami was much less at 15,878, but had thousands injured or missing. When this type of event happens again, hopefully this ocean seismic warning system will again benefit the people in the target area and save lives.",1361577600,12,6601,5.127323420074349
5560251,4,B00B74MJOS,"Though I do agree with the first reviewer that there wasn't enough character development before the tragedy struck, this is still an unforgettable viewing experience.  From the moment the tsunami hits it's painfully obvious that this is not going to be an easy film to sit through.  It's gut wrenching.  Now, I'm a hardcore horror fan before anything else and I can honestly say that there are moments that are extremely brutal and cringe worthy (and for you horror folks you might want to know that the director of The Impossible, J.A. Bayona, also did The Orphanage).  Beyond the brutality, however, is an amazing story based on true events that I will remember for a long time to come.  It's brilliant film making, even with it's flaws.  What it does well, it does exceptionally well.  I've seen almost all of the Oscar films this year (still have Amour and The Sessions to go) and I would put it near the middle of the Best Picture nominees which in my opinion it should be up for. Unfortunately, it only got the nom for Best Actress with a fantastic performance by Naomi Watts.  I can't even imagine the hell she must have been through in making this movie.

As for the Blu-ray, I'm looking forward to it.  Here are the current confirmed extras.

Audio commentary with director J.A. Bayona, writer Sergio G. Snchez and producer Beln Atienza and Mara Beln
Two featurettes
Deleted scenes

I was hoping for an in depth making of the film, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen.  I could watch hours on the making of the tsunami scenes alone.

All in all, this should definitely be a Blu-ray to look out for.  It's easily one of the best films to be released on the format so far in 2013, and it's a movie that I won't soon forget.",1360800000,13,1742,4.520766773162939

5560287,5,B00B74MJOS,"Yes, the original harrowing Tsunami experience happened to a beautiful and impressive Spanish family. You can read all about them if you look them up, they consulted closely with the actors and movie makers.  Some reviewers have given low ratings because the movie was not done with Spanish actors but, I feel they picked the right couple, the right kids, to give the story the gravitas it deserved.  Besides, if I had an important story of survival taking place during an event that impacted on millions of people, I would want Hollywood to tell it so that all of the world could share in celebrating the strength of our human spirit. No one else does this as well as Hollywood and that is just a fact of life.  As to the acting,  Naomi is physically vulnerable while displaying emotional maturity as the injured mother and doctor.  Ewan as usual is the good guy with a plan, if somewhat slightly perplexed by events.  With these two, we know there is triumph waiting at the end of the ordeal.  They have given us (who essentially have to look in from the outside whilst still being deeply involved) a sense of security that all will be well with this family in the end.  The kids are stunning in their skill, most especially the elder son who somehow holds the family together.

It is true that locals are more of a backdrop than a central part of the story.  But I don't see this as a shortcoming.  The fact is that this is the story of a family who were in Thailand as tourists. Personally I don't think there would have been space for other storylines with strong local leads, and that would have been tangential to the original story as told by the mother, the tourist that it happened to.  For me, it is enough that we are shown locals being extremely kind and brave while supporting tourists with an immense shortage of resources.  It is remarkable that amidst thousands of injured, lost and stranded; we see villagers, nurses and doctors somehow having the humanity to make personal connections with individual sufferers. They go to great lengths to take care of individual needs of this family in the face of overwhelming demands.  That the Spanish family thoughtfully remembered the care of strangers, and recounted those detail, is a credit to their own humanity. That the moviemakers demonstrated care of locals at the individual level, is indicative of their skill in capturing the small moments that add meaning to our human experience.

This movie is highly recommended as an example of the strength of the human spirit against the greatest and most unavoidable of odds.  In my opinion, it is safe to watch with teenagers, even in school situations.",1516060800,6,2665,4.698924731182796

I like Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts as actors and often wondered why they are in so many average movies.  This movie is clearly above average in acting, writing, special effects and pacing.  I suspect another big difference here is the directing as the movie really flows throughout with one purpose and that is to tell a good story about a real life event.

I have no idea how they could have recreated the horror and devastation so realistically. One can't help wondering if they'd filmed it while it happened. It's just incredible. But the best part of this movie is the human element. You root for the family and cheer the Thai people who rose so admirably to the occasion to deal with their own loss and devastation.  As a mother I feel kinship with Maria, and Naomi Watts just wrung the tears out of me. Another memorable part of this movie, for me, is Tom Holland.

5560355,4,B00B74MJOS,"The Impossible is a thrilling drama based off a true story about a familys tragic vacation to Thailand. It embodies the natural disaster based movie with its deep and heartfelt dialogue as well as its intense action scenes. Overall, I truly enjoyed the movie. It was a rollercoaster of emotions and kept me on the edge of my seat for nearly the entirety of the film.
The plot of this movie was outstanding. This true story starts out in Khao Lak, Thailand where the Bennet family decided to take their Christmas vacation. All was going well until suddenly, a devastating tsunami crashed along the citys coastline. The wave left nothing in its path as it took out huge buildings and uprooted thousands of trees. At this moment, the family was enjoying their day at the resorts pool. They were immediately swept away and a frenzy erupted amongst their fellow travelers. The family of five was split into two groups and forced to battle gruesome injuries as they found their way to safety. The remainder of the movie is all about their struggle to survive this frightful event as well as the familys efforts find each other amidst the chaos.
The production value and special effects of the movie were quite pleasing. Every so often there was a small lapse of overall quality that made the images look somewhat edited. This however, is to be expected with a film of this class. Emulating a natural disaster is more than a tough task due to its action packed scenes and vivid visuals. Also, the costume design and make up was absolutely stunning. The gruesome injuries and sick patients looked as real as can be. Very well done and I would recommend this artist for any movie requiring realistic makeup.
The actors in this movie were overall pretty good. The two adults were played quite well in my opinion. Ewan Mcgregor and Naomi Watts, played the mother and father and did so with a casual elegance that showed their experience. The children in this movie weren't played as well. This however is expected by young children. The 12, 7, and 5 year olds all appeared to have an obvious script that didn't flow very well. Its not expected for young children of these ages to be experienced in acting so, some leigh way should be given when assessing their overall performance. In my opinion, the producers should have used more natural lines that would better fit the younger characters personalities.
Visually, this film was very well done. The story was breathtaking and it made the audience feel as if they were involved in every shot. The camera angles were outstanding as they would give various birds eye views to display the carnage resulting from the waves. There were also a lot of interesting shots like underwater and close ups that gave the film a depth that relayed the severity of the tsunami.
In conclusion, I am giving this movie 4.5 out of 5 stars. It kept you guessing at every turn and made you not want to look away for a single second. I highly recommend this film and I look forward to seeing what the director has in store for us next.",1488412800,,3052,4.6537037037037035

5560376,4,B00B74MJOS,"If you're a tender-hearted person you may be in tears from beginning to end.  I liked this, but be aware it is very realistic- the shock, horror and pain that comes from living through a deadly disaster.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** Shown are the dead, ghastly injuries.  Where are my loved ones?  Are they dead or alive?  Also shown is the strength of love, the determination in spite of the horror and personal pain to find and save loved ones.  Phenomenal acting, special effects, scenery and camera work.  One critique (thus the four stars) is that the tale (a true one) would've been better served narratively, more slam-dunk satisfying IMO, if more time had been devoted at the end to near miraculous outcomes.  They were there, but treated more like an afterthought.  If ever there were a more appropriate time to celebrate the miraculous and push emotional buttons accordingly, this was it.  Well worth watching anyway, simply incredible.",1485216000,2,938,4.955128205128205

I might add the director focuses so much on Naomi and her son Lucas just after the intro..what about the rest of the area?  No rescue, other people and so on--admittedly excessively boring .  The director's zealous desire to show her boob and the scene where her son Lucas is staring at her chest and all goes to utter silence.  bahh.  Outside of the special effects this movie is a throw away and may put you to sleep. ZzzzzZzzzzz ....",1484784000,,708,4.67741935483871

5560417,4,B00B74MJOS,"(I wish 3.5 stars was an option.) Good acting and good movie overall, although after watching the documentaries surrounding this tsunami I was disappointed there wasn't more realism regarding how tsunamis hit. (The tide goes way out, and then shortly after the water comes back in, not receding, gaining in power, until it formed a huge rushing torrent. Then the torrent recedes. And returns.) There is no immediate 30-foot wave knocking over palms, and the ridiculous tsunami effects completely broke the immersion in the movie for me. I believe depicting the reality of the situation would have been dramatic enough. I was also bothered by the decision to use a nearly all-white cast for main and supporting roles even though the movie is set in Thailand, and (*SPOILER ALERT*) by the unlikely outcome of the 5-member family escaping the situation without losing so much as a limb.",1480204800,,883,5.01360544217687

A feel-good movie for women I guess.... and kids, but improbable and though tear jerking on cue, I did not feel attached to this family in the least.

A powerful movie about how strangers bonded when all they had were each other, with a salute to the dedicated medical staff in Thailand under impossible working conditions. Subduction of a continental plate, one plate was submerging beneath the other. Tension built in the top plate as it snagged from friction and recoiled. The tension was released when the plate abruptly slid forward, displacing unfathomable tons of water. This triggered the tsunami off the western coast of northern Sumatra, killing 230,000 people in 14 countries. Waves up to 100 feet swept over Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. A similar undersea megathrust occurred on March 11, 2011 off the coast of Japan.",1463097600,4,758,5.221311475409836

The water coming in is so realistic and going out too and the sore on her leg looks so real.  The part where he leaves his two little boys in the care of a stranger was hard to believe.  Did that really happen?  That wrenched my heart at the fear the little guy had without his daddy.  good acting all around.  The 13 year old boy was such a brave little guy and he came through so well.  was that true?  Most 13 year old boys would not be that persevering.  The chaos afterwards was eye-opening to me.  It made me realize how families can get separated forever.,1448323200,,676,4.0

5560674,1,B00B74MJOS,"The movie was pretty good -- subtle, even in the dramatic bits early on - and sensitive to the suffering encountered during the event.  The movie falls apart, tragically and inexplicably first in little bits (um, how is that our ""stars"" are able to walk through acres of sharp-edge rubble and glass in their barefeet but never suffer a scratch?); and then, in one gigantic fail at the very end.  In the last 30 minutes, the movie becomes a weepy soap opera of overly self-involved characters (no one else on the planet is suffering more than this family?) and the offensive priviledge of the first-world rich.  In the face of exceptional suffering, particularly for the local populations affected by the tsunami (of the 240K people killed, less than 1000 were non-natives); the family in the story is wisked away from the disaster scene on a private jet heading to a private hospital in another country.  Really?  I understand that this is a ""true"" story but the scene is so offensive, given the unspeakable suffering of millions of others left behind, that it makes the movie ending not just bad, but the whatever sympathy we had for the characters is swept away.",1438387200,5,1164,4.7711442786069655

I was there a few months before this happened and as such followed the stories quite closely. So many people died or were orphaned. This movie did an amazing job of showing what it was probably like for those on the ground.

5560730,5,B00B74MJOS,"The Impossible doesn't take long at all to get going- in a matter of 10 minutes we go from seeing a British family on vacation that this true story is mainly based around including a wife, husband and 3 young brothers to the tsunami surprisingly hitting the coast of a Thailand beach and causing nothing but enormous problems for everybody who happens to be in its way.  A moment later it's all about survival for this family and others.  It's rather realistic and graphic looking too, and hard to watch as a result because it's hard to picture ourselves in such a predicament and the uncertainly in how we'd respond if we had to face it.  I could kind of sense the events were going to happen quickly because the story/atmosphere just had that feel to it.  Must've been the bumpy plane ride that gave it away.  It seems interesting that Naomi Watts as an actress either stars in really forgettable films like Sunlight Jr. or really powerful and edgy films like this one.

As you know this is based on a true story involving a real tsunami that actually hit the Thailand shores in 2004 the day after Christmas.  I can clearly remember the incident and how devastating it was, so watching the way the events unfolded on screen gives us an indication what it was probably like.  Obviously actually BEING there and dealing with it would've been significantly more difficult, but this movie still had one heck of an emotional punch to it.

As the mother (played by Naomi Watts- oh and nice try Hollywood showing her beat up and trying to look unattractive with blood and scars all over her face and body, but you still failed) flows down the river and struggles to find anything to hold onto, I couldn't help but get caught up and question the existence of God in that very moment.  I mean think about it.  A loud roaring wave just unexpectedly appears, creates a river and a young mother with a long life ahead of her is now forced to flow with it.  Just a moment ago she was having a normal discussion with her family at the poolside.  Her life's in serious danger!

Maybe it was just the way she was trying desperately to hold onto that tree, but it sure made me feel small and insignificant.  At least there was some hope when she witnessed her son flowing down the river as well indicating it wasn't a total loss, though I have to question if this particular part is based on facts because what are the odds with thousands of people around, the one person you happen to see is your son?

Also, not taking anything away from the crazy circumstances the people of Thailand really had to endure because it was obviously a lot worse than an experience I'm about to share right now, but watching the mother and her son flow down the river reminded me of that one incident 5 years ago when I wasn't sure I'd survive in the Atlantic Ocean as the tides started coming in and I was stuck in the middle of the ocean temporarily helpless until a boat arrived while clamming.  That was scary.  Obviously the events the poor people of Thailand had to persevere were a lot worse but I can relate to the feeling of water overwhelming you.

Anyway the Impossible focuses around the mother spending her time in the hospital after being rescued and trying to cope with how beat up she was gradually getting weaker and weaker, and her son going around helping others the best he can (such as jotting down names in the hospital pertaining to the people who can't find their loved ones- clever idea!)  I loved when the one father and son were finally reunited.  The story eventually switches to other people and how they're coping with their injuries/inability to locate their loved ones (in addition to travelling to the mountains and to safety).  There's a lot of not so pretty moments such as when Naomi encourages her son to hand a slice of tangerine to another mother lying close by in the hospital room, and she coughs up blood.  It was gross to say the least.  I don't think I'll think of tangerines the same way again!

Rather odd that the two youngest boys as well as the one quiet blonde-haired boy showed no beat up marks or anything and were very clean considering what they just went through.  And wow what an ordeal Naomi Watts goes through in the hospital!  She came VERY close to, well... nevermind.  Also, it can only be considered an amazing moment of luck how the family came together.  I won't spoil it, but let's just say it's a good thing the one youngest boy had to use the bathroom when he did!  Overall this movie's a rough one to watch because of the real events it's based on, but highly recommended if you can handle the high emotions.",1433116800,,4643,4.479809976247031

5560785,4,B00B74MJOS,"I got to travel to Kho Lak in December to see some of the effects of the 2004 tsunami and celebrate the 10th anniversary. The film was recommended by one of the people who had survived that terrible event, and it did live up to the factual and visual expectation of what happened in the first few days after the waves hit along the beaches of Thailand. As we saw on our travels through the region there continue to be some stark reminders of what happened, and in some of the smaller villages the loss of life has devastated the population. This is a true story of survival in some of the worst conditions. I certainly recommend this movie as an example of the intrepid human spirit and the determination of all those involved to work together. There are thousands of stories about what happened on that fateful day - Dec. 8, 2004 - and this depicts a small portion of one of those stories. I talked to other survivors who had their own story of how they survived, and in many cases lost members of their family.",1426204800,2,1012,4.388297872340425

The true story of a Spanish family (presented as British) who, with tens of thousands of strangers, find themselves in the mayhem of one of the worst natural catastrophes of our time  the 2004 tsunami.

What did I think?

The Impossible is a harrowing rollercoaster of raw emotion. Amazing effects reconstruct the disaster and the ensuing carnage but its actually a movie about the human cost.

It might be argued some of the shots were held too long which might be true for a fiction piece, but here they work. To shorten them would be to gloss over a terrible tragedy. Surprisingly the film doesnt focus too much on individual tragedies beyond the family, instead allowing you to apply the horror yourself.

A movie for the big screen but, given the inclusion of children, not one for parents.",1423872000,,812,4.723404255319149

I don't know how they got such performances out of two very small children but they did.  Of course Naomi Watts can't put a foot wrong on screen and ditto Ewen McGregor.  The problem with the film is that after the thrill of watching the Tsunami hit (and we'll all seen news clips of that many times) the movie becomes pretty much a one note film.  Most of it is in the makeshift hospital with hundreds and hundreds of injured people and the members of the family looking for each other.  It's true story so I guess all of the members of this family really did survive but how is the biggest question.  They do include small amounts of the stories of other people but I think it would have been a better film if there had been a bit more of other people's stories and less of the oldest boy running endless corridors at the hospital screaming ""dad"".

Then when you realize that people actually went through this it makes it just the more gripping and touching. What I liked most about the movie is that it didn't really try to do more than just tell the sequence of events, but the sequence of events were so crazy and catastrophic that just the account of everything is better than many fictional action films I've seen.",1421280000,,466,4.4941176470588236

So much of the movie's power, however, comes from the exceptional music score. There is one specific scene in this movie that will stay with you for the rest of your days.  You will cry when you see it, assuming you are human.  The movie, unlike most movies these days, shows humanity at its best. Furthermore, this terrible tragedy seems to  have been quickly forgotten by the western world.  As I write this, the 10th anniversary of the event will soon be upon us.  Now would be a good time  to become reacquainted with what really happened.",1418688000,2,680,4.6

And after all, were these people doing anything any different than thousands of others were doing??? Searching for their loved ones. Why are there no stories of people native to the area, only caucations are worth portraying???

5560896,5,B00B74MJOS,I like Ewan McGregor in general and he doesn't disappoint. Naomi Watts' acting was off the chart for this one. Every scene that she is in after the first 20 minutes is mesmerizing. The tension setup between her and the Tom Holland (Lucas) was palpable during the aftermath scenes.

5560929,3,B00B74MJOS,"This big budget disaster movie has the fortunate casting of the ever-talented and attractive Ewan MacGregor and Naomi Watts in title roles. Considering it was based upon a real-life occurrence, the nonstop flow of tragic events, the graphically gory makeup and very realistic tsunami special effects were particularly appreciated. Although undeveloped character treatments and bland dialogue did not give one a sense of individuality for any of the cast members, this may have been a clever way of portraying how a grand calamity like a tsunami can anonymize each of its victims. Although maudlin direction and somewhat overly dramatic music were rather insufferable, the movie did drive its point home about how a life-changing event can bring loved ones even closer together than before.",1409443200,,789,5.370967741935484

5560975,2,B00B74MJOS,"I agree with some others. This was poorly done. The real family was not British, they were Spanish. But I guess Hollywood didn't think we'd get so invested in a dark-skinned family? No, we are treated to Naomi Watts, nudie shots and all. And before she's given an award for acting, I think they need to recognize she didn't need to act. Her part was convincing due to the special effects/make-up.

Also, I was quite offended by the neglect to portray the natives accurately in this tragedy at all. No, they were there as servants to the wealthy tourists. Both  before and after the disaster. Uggh.",1402012800,4,597,4.622641509433962

But this movie does indeed achieve the impossible.  Early on when they spent 15 minutes on climbing a tree, I hit fast forward and never looked back.  It deserves a couple of stars for special effects, which, curiously, are given relatively little time and attention. Meh.",1399161600,,436,4.851351351351352

This is a story that deserved filming, as it is the true story of a family caught up in the Tsunami whilst on holiday. The acting, especially by Naomi Watts and Tom Holland, is forcefully quiet, and the individual tests that their characters underwent are all the more dramatic for the understatement.",1399161600,,478,4.635294117647059
5560991,5,B00B74MJOS,"I feel weird giving this movie 5 stars which is tantamount to saying ""I love it!""  For this movie, with all of its spirit on full display against 'the impossible', is a harrowing and hard movie to watch made so much more so knowing that this horrific event really occurred to the coast of Thailand and that we are focusing on an incredible story of a family of survivors (underline that) when so many people were not fortunate like they were.

The movie stars Naomi Watts (in the performance of her career?) and Ewan McGregor as Maria and Henry, vacationing parents of three boys in tow, who are beset with no warning by a massive coastal tidal wave that smashes into them and rips their family apart.  You will wince and grab at your guts as you watch Watts especially being buffeted and tossed around like a dirty dishrag by the raging ocean, being pummeled and punctured and torn up as she is smashed into trees and bricks and branches and toys and other flotsam and jetsam being roiled around in the seething waters.  But as tough as all of that is tougher still are the spirits of Maria and her eldest son Lucas (played admirably by Tom Holland) who not only struggle to survive but help others along the beleaguered way all the while holding onto hope and searching for the rest of the family (who are shockingly still alive and together, at least for a time, with each other).  While McGregor's Henry comes into the pic later and whose story unfolds more slowly and with less intensity he also shows the same resolute and tough-minded spirit to find the rest of his family...if they're still alive.

It's fittingly impossible that they all survived and found each other so relatively quickly in this grueling tale of survival and the film allows us a snippet of how impossibly difficult this must have been to live through.",1398643200,,1830,4.598159509202454
5560992,5,B00B74MJOS,"This is one movie that you CAN NOT miss seeing.  What an incredible cast - how this real family, like many many others survived this tragedy is almost ""IMPOSSIBLE"".

They ALL should have won an Oscar!  DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE.  And do not miss seeing the trailer before the movie begins - it shows the incredible mastermind of hell-of-a SMART producers, who found a way to portray this movie so true to life, that when you see it, you feel like you are in their situation with them..

This film is not outright ""religious"" by any means, but for the believer, you can't help but see God's hand in every detail!

Love how it shows the kindness of the people who live there. Watch with your family but there are 2 quick scenes where the Mother's shirt is torn off and that is a bit more than you may want your kids to see.

We all saw the pictures on television, but to see if from  the perspective of a vacationing family was more than I had expected.

5561025,5,B00B74MJOS,"As a kid I remember disaster epics like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" films that garnered entertainment value from peoples' suffering.  I was unnecessarily wary of this film because usually Hollywood kowtows to the lowest common denominator.  ""The Impossible"" is not so much a disaster film but a testament of will and perserverence  in the most trying of circumstances.  The filmmakers let us in on the fate of the individual members of the Bennett family but the mystery here is whether they will reunite amidst the chaos.  Naomi Watts and Ewen McGregor are outstanding as the parents but the real glue to the film is the performance of Tom Holland as the eldest son, Lucas.  In Holland's first screen role he projects strength and has real presence.  A lot of the storylines depend on his character and Holland is more than up to the task.  The only thing you can really fault the film for is that the Bennett's real life counterparts were Spanish.  The choice to cast Western actors was probably a commercial decision and not an artistic one and if the real life family's story is done justice why quibble? On the DVD the real life mother offers commentary.",1391126400,,1183,4.788177339901478

5561030,5,B00B74MJOS,I initially bought this movie because I like Naomi Watts. This is a good movie that depicts the devastation of the 2004 tsunami. Every actors/actress in here did a fabulous job and Naomi Watts knock this one out of the park with her performance. I recommend watching this movie.,1390608000,,278,4.6938775510204085
5561031,5,B00B74MJOS,"I got this movie from our local library.  I had no rhyme or reason to get it, had no real idea what it was about, and like my title here says I had never heard of the movie before.  That is how I went into it.  I did not even read the summary on the back of the box.

I got the idea early that this was about the tsunami in the previews and the movie slowly brought you into it.  Expecting nothing, the movie did not grab me immediately, but I knew what was coming.  When the wave hit, it caught me off guard.  Despite knowing what was coming, the affects, the filming, the set up were simply unbelievable in a very good way.  The movie captured the shock and awe of that impact, the true and utter chaos, the helplessness of the moment, and the sheer terror afterwards.  I was grabbed by the movie in the most gut-wrenching, emotional way and was never let go.  From that moment in the movie until the very end, I was an emotional wreck.

Just when I thought my emotional peak had hit, the wave was receding.  I sort of (despite the title of the movie and not knowing the outcome as I thought it would be impossible for almost anyone to survive that) resigned myself to accept that everyone else in the family  was killed and that the movie would continue telling the story of the mom and her search and journey of survival.  Then you hear the oldest boy call out.  Damn, it got me again.  Maybe it is the fact I have three kids of my own, with the oldest of a similar age as the kid in the movie, but I completely lost it.  The chaos the movie portrayed right there was again unmatched.  The movie could have gone straight downhill after that and I still would have loved it simply because of the emotional impact it communicated, but it did not.  The movie continued with up and down moments right up to the very end.

The hardest scene in the movie to take, despite all of what was mentioned above, was the husbands phone call.  When he lost it on the phone, I was devastated as well, imagining what it would be like to be in that moment.  The reactions in the movie were heartfelt and priceless to me.

In the end, I felt it was, without exception or even a close second, the most emotional movie that I had never heard of prior to seeing.  I know that I can be an emotional guy, especially with dog movies and touching sports movies.  Brian's Song and Something for Joey were great and yeah, I cried in those.  And Marley and Me, the book, had me from the beginning in side-splitting laughter to shoulder shaking tears at the end.  But nothing caught and held me so hard for so long as this movie did.

I watched the movie on my own the first time.  It made such an impact on me that I had to show my wife later that same night.  She had a lot of work to do and was adamant that she did not want to watch any movie at all.  So I fast forwarded to the initial wave impact.  She was in, but she really could not watch.  So she waited until the morning and then continued on.  She is not one to watch a movie and outwardly react other than a quiet sob with tears on occasion, but in this movie, by the end, she was literally yelling at our tv she was so into it.

After reading many of the other reviews, I understand to a point why some criticize it.  There are many things in there that are probably in error when compared to what actually happened on site.  Yeah, they could have showed more about how the Thai people were impacted in a bad way.  But the movie did show the locals in a great light by how they helped total strangers.  I loved how the movie showed the old man pushing the hospital worker out of the way, a guy that was telling him the hospital was full and they could take no more.  The old man, carrying the mother, would not accept that and pushed the man away and proceeded into the hospital.  The entire interaction was in Thai and so it most likely was not appreciated by those who do not speak Thai.  I thought that it would have been nice to show how much the US military helped out in the immediate aftermath.  But I realized that was not the point of the movie.  The movie was about the impossible, not about a 100% accurate depiction of actual events.  The emotional impact so overwhelmed me that I could overlook all errors or omissions and simply feel what it was like to be there.

I wondered why I had not heard about it as it was so good to me.  The oldest boy in the movie was unbelievably great.  Watts did a great job too, but the kid was godlike, especially for a kid.

Ok, enough said.  Watch the movie.  I saw it twice now in two days and I am still going out to buy it.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  Keep a full box of Kleenex on hand, though!",1390608000,,4695,4.113436123348017
5561032,5,B00B74MJOS,"Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor star as parents who take their three sons to Thailand on vacation where they become victims of the deadly tsunami of 2004.

Every minute of this true story is gut-wrenching, from the incredibly realistic recreation of the tsunami to the mass death and devastation afterward. Watts and McGregor are excellent as the suffering and selfless parents and Tom Holland gives a wonderful performance as their brave young son.

I saw videos of the disaster, but putting a personal, family face on the horror makes it all the more real and heartbreaking. Filmed on location in Thailand, the movie is intense and very moving. Highly recommended.",1390521600,,664,5.027272727272727

5561039,5,B00B74MJOS,"Based on a true story, The Impossible is a fantastic movie about hope and the human spirit.  This is a movie that will stay with you for a long time.

While on vacation in Thailand, a British family is separated when the tsunami of 2004 strikes their resort.  The special effects and drama leading up to this humongous wave hitting this peaceful beach are quite good.  Naomi Watts and her oldest son are literally swept away in a roiling river of debris.  She has no idea where her younger sons and her husband are or even if they are alive.  Naomi Watts is a powerhouse, she is absolutely superb in all her emotions.  You can feel her extreme physical pain as she tries her very best to literally stay afloat.

Ewen McGregor plays her husband.  He is good but his role does not require the physical demands of Watts's scenes.  (Watts is spectacular even when she is just attempting to walk with severe injuries; her determination and physical anguish are expressed through her face and movement). McGregor has his own dilemma; he wants to find his wife and oldest son but with catastrophe all around him it is a Herculean task.

This movie shows the beauty of the human spirit from the will to live to the generosity of helping others.  I found myself tearing up several times when virtual strangers came to the aid of this family.  This movie  has a special place in my movie collection.",1389744000,,1389,4.548387096774194

This film centers on a family of vacationers, good, but I would have liked to see how the natives fared (thus not the people OF Thailand). There are some heart wrenching scenes, and the tsunami footage is spectacular and cringe-inducing. My favorite scene is after the water subsides and the son, Lucas, says to his mother ""Don't ever make me do this again"".

That would be my only complaint, though:  15 minutes isn't a lot of time to get to know the family members before the movie hits the ground running, as we grieve, hope, and pray right along with them in their desperate plight.  I also would've tweaked where the final scene takes place, but otherwise it's harrowing, riveting, and touching, aka entertaining, and it's nice to finally see a movie that fulfills your expectations.",1388620800,,664,4.8584070796460175

5561096,5,B00B74MJOS,"What is it like to go through a horrifying natural disaster, and the scary aftermath of pain from injuries, uncertainty from being separated from family, the quest to find said family members, and just overall chaos?  Hopefully none of us ever have to find out, but this movie does a great job of taking us through such an unfortunate journey.

Based on the true story of a family who was involved with the horrifying Tsumani of Southeast Asia in 2004, this movie s visually rich, depicting several scenes of horror and chaos that come with such a disaster and its aftermath.  Particularly harrowing and well acted, was the story of Lucas and his dying mom Maria (the Naomi Watts character); acted extremely well and they had great chemistry, even if to depict very dramatic and unsettling situations.  The ""uncertainty"" piece was also very suspenseful, as family members are get separated many times due to various circumstances, and you are not sure if - or how - they will reunite.

There has been some talk out there, that the movie is ""racist"" due to focus on ""Western Tourists"" who were caught up in this disaster, rather than on how it affected the Thai natives. However, I thought the Thai natives were very well portrayed; although they did not get as much screen time as the other victims, the Thai people were portrayed as heroes, who rescued many of the tragedy victims; then dispensed medical care amongst chaos.

Like all good dramas, there are many tear-jerking moments, but uplifting moments mixed in; particularly with the bonds that the family members make with some of the people they run into throughout this harrowing experience.  So again, if you're in the mood for a light-hearted movie, this isn't the one for you; wait until you are ready for something deep and dramatic.",1388275200,,1796,4.811688311688312
5561097,5,B00B74MJOS,"I was on the edge of my seat watching The Impossible. It's a testament to the skill of the director, writers and actors that even though I knew beforehand that the family survived, I was still in agony on their behalf. Some of the coincidences and close calls where the family kept missing each other toward the end was a bit of a stretch. However, the tsunami sequences left me gasping, toiling for breath because it put me right in the middle of it. I was blown away. And I must mention the makeup and effects for Naomi Watts's character's poor battered body. I was very pained on her behalf. Well done!",1388275200,,605,4.410714285714286

5561173,2,B00B74MJOS,The movie's story line was far too depressing for most members of the family. It was a definite chick flick,1386028800,,107,4.4

5561175,3,B00B74MJOS,"We rented this movie with high expectations, but in the end it was slightly disappointing.  It's hard to explain why, but I think part of it had to do with the fact that we have all seen lots of actual footage of the 2004 tsunami, and the film really did not seem to portray it very accurately (in the film the wave hit with MUCH greater force than any of the actual news videos I have seen).  Because the ""fake"" tsunami footage didn't match the way the ""real"" thing looked, my immediate reaction was ""Oh, that's fake..."" which made it harder to really get into the movie.

Overall, it's not a bad film, but it's just not as compelling as it could have been.",1386028800,,658,4.290322580645161

5561179,5,B00B74MJOS,Interesting. Able to sit through all without having to get up. Some of the scenes brought tears to my eyes. Would recommend. No indecent added scenes. This is hard to find in todays flicks. Very refreshing. Found this along with other great movies using Amazon Instant Video. Thanks Amazon for having good watching like this one.,1385769600,,329,4.892857142857143
5561180,5,B00B74MJOS,I teach in a high school and used this film as an example to inform and educate students of the events involved with the devastation that  has recently occurred in the Philippines. It is difficult for some adolescents to imagine the grief and destruction that occurs through natural disasters. This film made it possible to do so.,1385769600,,330,4.7894736842105265
5561181,5,B00B74MJOS,"An absolutely amazing and realistic study of what it would have been like to go through the tsunami.  Some complain that the focus of this movie is too narrow and does not tell us enough about the overall tragedy.  I believe this view completely missed the point.  The focus of the movie is narrow because that is what happens when you are in a disaster.  You only experience your small corner and do not know what is going on.  This movie communicates that narrow experience very well while also, in that very narrow experience, helps you to understand the wider tragedy.  Absolutely excellent.  Well written, well acted, with awesome cinematography.",1385596800,,651,4.863636363636363

Otherwise, just move on to a better film.  This film does not even serve as a reasonable documentary of the tragic event.  Don't waste your four bucks on this.",1385078400,6,323,4.440677966101695

5561200,5,B00B74MJOS,This movie provides the viewer with a realistic enactment of what one family in particularly went through as well as all the others indirectly during the horrible tsunami that came without warning. It helps you to experience the fear and hopelessness this family endured through it all. We give it five stars.,1384905600,,309,4.961538461538462

5561202,5,B00B74MJOS,Inspiring and uplifting story-- but be warned that the devastation of the tsunami is truly heartbreaking. Not for the tender of heart.,1384819200,,134,5.136363636363637
5561203,5,B00B74MJOS,Excellent movie about grit and survival of a family caught up in the Thailand tsunami.  Based on a true story.  You already know the plot but the details of what they have to endure is the power of the movie.  Along the way they help others even thought they are struggling with their own losses showing the basic human trait of helping others in trouble.  Great actors doing a great job.  See it you won't be disappointed!,1384560000,,423,4.441558441558442
5561204,2,B00B74MJOS,Good story line... poor script from about 3/4 of the way through the film to the end.  Would not watch this again.,1384560000,,114,4.181818181818182

5561206,3,B00B74MJOS,Very emotional movie that will bring a tear or two.  Not one of those movies that someone would have to run out to the theater and watch.  Worth the money when sitting at home laying down.,1384387200,,188,4.194444444444445
5561207,5,B00B74MJOS,Very well done. A bit Limey but well done. Loved the special effects and the true nature of the story.,1384300800,,102,4.15
5561208,3,B00B74MJOS,"Although it tells a nearly miraculous true story of a family's survival through the Asian tsunami against all odds, this movie was extremely difficult to watch.  The pain, suffering and horror it portrays is nearly unrelieved throughout the movie, except for several instances of amazing human kindness and courage in the face of abject horror, loss, and misery. Don't watch it unless you have a strong tolerance for emotional suffering and gore.  It is not a light evening's entertainment.

In spite of all that, it seemed slow to me, but perhaps that was because a lot of the story involved intolerable endless waiting. Overall, it lacked depth and nuance.  They told the story, but it needed some additional layers of plot or something.  Great special effects showing the horrible conditions, but then some things you'd expect were omitted.  For example, there was a shortage of food and water, but they were never shown acting hungry or thirsty, or eating or drinking anything.

There were many good points, too, such as the portrayals of courage and kindness mentioned above, as well as unshakable the bonds of familial love.  I could not watch this movie again, though.",1384300800,4,1175,4.98974358974359
5561209,4,B00B74MJOS,Good movie.  Hard to watch at times due to realization that it is a true story.  Would not have watched it if I had not known that they all survived.,1384300800,,149,3.933333333333333
5561220,4,B00B74MJOS,It was a good movie to watch.  So sad to think that this really happened.  So sad that so many had died.  I'm glad that I saw it.,1384300800,,129,3.5357142857142856
5561221,5,B00B74MJOS,This is a movie that everybody should watch because it will make you realize how fortunate we are that we didn't go through this.  Now we have the typhoon in the Philippines to add to another disaster.  Great acting by Naomi.  This movie has a big impact..,1384214400,,256,4.404255319148936

5561225,5,B00B74MJOS,I was really moved watching this film ...I visited Thailand this year and stayed in the area where the tragedy occurred  .It must have been horrifying ...Naomi  Watts and the lad who played her eldest son were excellent,1383782400,,219,4.7368421052631575
5561226,5,B00B74MJOS,"The first time my wife and I tried to watch this film we agreed to turn it off after twenty minutes - it was that unsettling and touched all the obvious nerves: of losing each other, of losing children, of helplessness. A few weeks later I decided to try it out again myself. I found the first third of the film very difficult to handle (for the above reasons) and was glad to see it over. The terrible suffering I found unnerving. But when a few rays of hope showed themselves and the arc of the story made itself apparent I was glad to see it through. It is a rough ride. Brilliant acting.",1383696000,4,591,4.192982456140351
5561227,4,B00B74MJOS,"This movie was gritty and intense at times. It was also very sad and bittersweet. It's important to note that this film didn't end in despair, like many films chronicling actual events tend to. This film also takes you straight into the middle of the tsunami without overdoing the carnage. Don't get me wrong. There are terrible things that happened, but the horror of it all is not the center of the story.

The acting, as many have already said, was superb. The boy who played the oldest son did an amazing job, so much so that I felt as if I were watching a video of reality, not a movie. There was never a moment when I felt anyone was acting or hamming it up for Oscar buzz, which is a shame, because subdued but true performances are often overlooked by the Academy.

Like any disaster where so many people lose their lives, I was haunted by this event, heartbroken for those who lost everything. This movie gave me a small sense of closure. I was not personally affected by the tsunami, so my emotional wellness is of little concern. But for what it's worth, watching this movie meant more to me than two hours of escapism.",1383609600,,1130,4.427884615384615

As luck would have it, my daughter moved to Joplin, MO shortly after the tornado. The devastation was overwhelming there too. She keeps a grab and go bag in the tornado proof room of her house.

5561242,2,B00B74MJOS,"Having read the book ""Wave"" by Sonali Deraniyagala, which was about one woman's loss in the same Tsunami, this movie seemed more Hollywood than real to me. It credits as being based on a true story, so maybe the ending of the movie was true to someone's experience, I don't know.

The acting was good, the kids were very good, and the special effects were pretty good, but the movie never really caught me in the story. I rented it from Amazon, and it took me two nights to get through the movie. I stopped halfway through the first nice, mostly out of boredom with trying to believe the story.

I am sure that if I hadn't read Wave, I might have been better able to suspend my disbelief.

The one good thing, it was only a rental, so I didn't waste a lot of money purchasing it.",1382572800,,779,4.25
5561243,4,B00B74MJOS,"the onset of the story is considered known. the acting is expressed by very good talents (e.g. N Watts). the storyline is attractive not that it would be leading to a climax since the real event was well known; but in that it unfurls from inside us the degree at which we can be caring or extremely fear for our kinfolks (i.e. their well-being) when tragedy strikes.  That is, the human factor surrounding this powerful catastrophe makes the viewer feels as though he/she (especially those w/ small children) is beating the same heartbeat for a bit of hope as the victims or enduring every minute of their larger-than-life tragedy, including every aspect of their mental chaos or even their physical demise",1382572800,,706,4.8347107438016526

I thought it was well acted, believable even in most of the special effects, and not too long to sit through.  What a difficult tragedy to have to endure, and yet many people did exactly that.  It was overwhelming at times and left me speechless at others.  I found myself actually talking to the TV when I watched it (does anyone else do that?) and on the edge of my seat much of the time.  It did not glorify the death and destruction but made you realize just how awful it was.

5561269,4,B00B74MJOS,"The Impossible is based on the true story of the Alvarez Belon family caught in the 2004 tsunami that ravaged Asia. Anyone watching the film an always guess the ending but this film is not about the destination, it is about the road that the family must have to travel to survive the ordeal and regroup.
Henry ( Mcgreogor) and Maria( naomi Watts) are vacationing in Thailand. This is a family who is at play but has worries just like everyone about layoffs at work and back to work transition for the wife, she is a doctor. This is a normal family who are about to suffer under extraordinary circumstances...The Tsunami sequence is just amazing, the devastation by the force of the water is incredible, the sight of bodies being tossed around and getting hit by objects - just watch it to experience it.
After the amazing Tsunami sequence the pace does slow down a little bit but the human element comes to the forefront as the family having separated must find each other in the chaos that ensued. Mcgregor and Watts are super actors but it is their screen son Lucas who is the star as he metamorphoses from a boy to a man. He gives an outstanding performance. This is a decent movie that does seem to e a bit stretched when towards the end, the director delves in to melodrama a la bollywood when characters are literally one step away from each other but don't notce. This is a small mistake though for a extremely well made and moving film, four stars. 9/10/2013",1380412800,,1466,4.515037593984962

The true life story of this family is a touching and moving story. The ending is most touching. The scenes of the water rising were down so realistically.

It really stuck with me days after I watched it.  I always wondered how strong the water was, what I would have done, if I would have made it out alive.  This movie shows a really amazing depiction of the tsunami itself.  It felt so real.  It's not too graphic, definitely not appropriate for kids under 12 though.  Everyone over 12 should see this.  I think they'll get a better sense of the tsunami and it's impact (at the very least).  It's a touching story of family, love, and never giving up as well!",1379462400,2,683,4.392

Depictions of injuries in the film are intense, but I think they need to be.  230,000 people died in the Indian ocean tsunami, the subject matter isn't going to be light and fluffy, but it is inspiring and moving.  The performances are fantastic.  I recommend reading a little about the real family after you watch the film.

This movie is on our must watch list, along with the relevant research and practice reading, to give people a realistic appreciation of what their survivors or patients have experienced.

5561298,4,B00B74MJOS,"I admit, The Impossible was a movie I'd picked up for my wife. I didn't expect to like it. I figured the first few minutes would be compelling, like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hereafter/dp/B004NOH9LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hereafter</a>&nbsp;(which was also a good movie) but that the tone would take a 90 degree turn after. And it did, but that was a great thing.
The first half of the movie had Naomi Watts' character and her son fighting against the tide to not only survive, but reunite with each other. Once the water recedes, we see they the extent of the damage and are left to wonder how anyone could have survived. But the story is focused on the family of five and we see the mother's mangled leg. That's all the foreshadowing we need to know something bad is going to happen.
Until this point we are left to believe her husband and two younger sons are dead. Minor spoiler, but they aren't. After she and her son make it to relative safety, the story jumps to Ewan McGregor's character as he searches for his wife and son. I don't want to give away the whole thing, but when McGregor finally gets a cell phone and is able to call home-the way he loses it really gets to you.
The drama definitely doesn't end after the tsunami is over. The one drawback is the extreme coincidence that happens at the end. It's a little on the heavy-handed side and strikes as disingenuous. But other than that, it's a great family film if the kiddies can take a minor scare or two.

5561300,2,B00B74MJOS,"The movie was well done and did tug at my heart strings.  What really turned me off was the efforts and handstands the director went thru to make sure there was absolutely no mention of, no picture of, no oblique reference to religious faith.  It is stupid to imagine that at least some people in this situation would not turn to their faith for help to manage.  It is also stupid to imagine that there would not be a single religious figure, priest, minister, rabbi, imam or whatever on the scene anywhere.

Naomi Watts(Maria) sold it, what a performance. She makes you feel her pain, she makes you believe her struggles and shows how strong the actual Maria must have been to overcome such obstacles. Unbelievable how good she is.

Tom Holland(Lucas), what an actor. This was another amazing performance, so believable so strong. He quite possibly was my favorite actor in this movie. The emotion he brings out in you, the way he handled the role just made Naomi Watts better. He was a total selling point. Amazing.

Ewan McGregor(Henry) is always good. He brings home another strong performance and shows his versatility. Very good.

The two child actors, Samuel Joslin(Thomas) and Oaklee Pendergast(Simon) were so cute and played their parts well.

This movie was so emotional. It is amazing to me how the human spirit and the will to survive, plus the strength of family are all brought to life in this amazing whole cast performance. The true family that this movie was based on is truly amazing as well. Inspirational. Still wiping away the tears. Rent it, buy it, watch it with family.",1377907200,3,1149,4.782828282828283

When there are so many thousands of people killed or bereaved by such a cataclysmic event, the sheer numbers of dead and grieving overwhelm us, but when we are confronted with a smaller group, perhaps the effect of such a tragedy on one family, then I, at least, can better comprehend the kind of endurance of both mind and body required by my fellows who have surmounted such disasters throughout our tumultuous history.

The film portion dealing with the sudden onslaught of the ocean was properly terrifying, as well as the accompanying underwater struggles of the people caught rolling among the broken bits of resort and landscape in its forces.

Some 500 miles to the north, at the Orchid Beach resort in Khao Lak, Thailand, the Beln family was enjoying their second day of vacation. Soon, however, they and millions of other unfortunate individuals would experience the one of the most destructive tsunamis in history. A tsunami is a great ocean wave generated by an earthquake. In this case, several waves struck the entire coastline of the Indian Ocean, leveling everything in their path and killing as many as 315,000 people. This movie, in a 10-minute sequence of astounding, terrifying detail, depicts what happened to the Belns when the tsunami overwhelmed the beachside resort. Their ordeal is portrayed by the fictional Bennett family: Henry, the husband; Maria, the wife, and their three sons, Lukas, Thomas and Simon, as we watch their impossible story unfold. Director Bayona and his crew created what might be the most realistic depiction of a waterbourne disaster ever brought to the screen. In the process, we get to see two great acting performances - one by Naomi Watts as Maria, and the other by 16-year-old Tom Holland as Lukas. Together, they're as riveting as two actors can be, portraying people literally swept away from their quiet, normal lives by the immense power of nature. You might never be able to forget them.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1377561600,,1680,5.778225806451613
5561333,4,B00B74MJOS,I liked this movie - it is a remarkable story.  I did feel it sort of had a unbelievable ending but that is the point of the story - it seems impossible.,1377388800,,153,3.78125
5561334,3,B00B74MJOS,"The first thing I had to ask, from when I first got news of the tsunami, is only complete idiots and people too spoiled for life would travel from the U.S. or Europe to spend Christmas in a southeast Asian coastal tourist attraction.  Christmas is a holy time, with church, and home, and family, and even amid the celebrating and presents Christmas isn't Christmas without the sense of the sacred and the ties to home.

This couple seem typical; plagued by financial worries they still take a plane to stay in a swank hotel, and the fact that they appear to be temporarily stranded in Japan for the father's work to begin with doesn't excuse it.

The couple behave like complete idiots from minute 1.  It starts when it doesn't occur to either mother or son to stay in a tree once one catches ahold of one.  The father sends his five and six year old off to some unknown destination alone with people he doesn't even know; it's a wonder they weren't sold into prostitution or slavery like tens of thousands of children caught in that disaster.  He stays behind to look for his wife and eldest son who from what he knows are probably dead and certainly not both nearby and able to answer his shouts.

The movie often drags.  It takes twenty minutes to even get going.  The end drags as well.  Parts of the middle drag.

The ending is improbable.  I know for a fact that people characteristically looked for days or weeks for loved ones.  This family happen to come together and find each other by a pure series of accidents.  I don't think so!

Finally, we are never told how the financially strapped upper middle class family manage to have a private plane fly them to civilization - and only the villagers who rescue the mother and the eldest son ever manage to think of putting clothing on them.  They are still barefoot when they get on the plane. Some of them are still covered with blood, despite days of wandering.  I mean, I'd have washed off, if I had to do it in a tidal pool.

With all that said the movie does manage to hold your attention - much of the time.",1377388800,2,2070,4.402631578947369
5561335,5,B00B74MJOS,"A very surprisingly awesome movie. Tense, and real life. It was horrifying how everyone and everything got swept away, but it was very believable and wonderful to see their point of view.",1377216000,,187,4.875
5561336,5,B00B74MJOS,"Glad I was not there! This was such a realistic depiction of the tsunami that it was brutal! But, had it not been, it would not be a realistic / true story.  Naomi Watts did a great job.  But, I think Ewan McGregor's performance is not given enough credit, nor is Tom Holland, the boy that plays the oldest son.  He too is incredible in this film!  What a great movie!  I was really impressed.",1377216000,,393,4.1866666666666665
5561337,4,B00B74MJOS,Kind of frightening look at what actually happened to this family. Extraordinary story but very sorrowfull on the ones who were not as lucky as the main family. Thousands of people did not survive.,1377216000,,197,4.823529411764706
5561338,4,B00B74MJOS,"I knew one of the casualties from this disasters. I am glad some families were able to reunite. I relived the horror my friend might have felt, now she is in peace.  Great acting Naomi!!",1377216000,,186,4.314285714285714
5561339,5,B00B74MJOS,"So often, films about natural disasters seem to be overwhelmingly artificial looking. I expected the same. I was wrong. By whatever means, the makers of this film were able to make a tsunami look as real as those news film clips from the actual event. The nasty facts of what happens to people must be conveyed in a PG manner, but the myriad tales here were conveyed at just the right level of breath-taking family theater. My pre-teens were amazed, but not frighted more than necessary. Amazing story.",1377129600,,502,4.715909090909091
5561340,5,B00B74MJOS,I was there and this was the way it was and it Kao Lak looked.  Excellent movie.  I will never forget the courage and kindness of the Thai people..,1377129600,,147,4.0344827586206895
5561341,4,B00B74MJOS,"This movie is a bit hard to watch in places and harder to imagine going through something like this. In places it seemed a little long, but overall, it was definitely worth the rental!",1377129600,,184,4.4411764705882355
5561342,5,B00B74MJOS,"Watched the movie with my daughter and had to close my eyes several times not to see those highly realistic and scary details. The movie is great, very touching. The actors' play is incredible, even little ones'. Highly recommend it",1377043200,,232,4.825
5561343,4,B00B74MJOS,"This movie focuses on the event as experienced by one family. While I know editorial license goes into every film, The Impossible gives a balanced look at the experiences by both parents and the oldest child. The acting is excellent, as is the pacing of the days after the typhoon. I had tears of joy and sorrow throughout!

There are some scenes that were particularly gruesome (and I enjoy Walking Dead!), but overall is appropriate for young teens and up, I think.

I admit to being disappointed to learn after watching that the actual family is Spanish, yet are portrayed as British. I can pass that off as a marketing choice, and while I can't say I didn't love the actors chosen, that distinction puts the story more fictional than based on reality, in my mind.",1377043200,,767,4.632352941176471
5561344,4,B00B74MJOS,Great movie. Popcorn in one hand. Kleenex in the other.  Very entertaining.  Probably won't go to an Oceanside resort for awhile though,1376956800,,135,5.090909090909091
5561345,5,B00B74MJOS,saddest movie I have ever seen!  The acting was incredible...I don't think u could feel any closer to the real thing unless you were there yourself.,1376956800,,148,4.6923076923076925
5561346,3,B00B74MJOS,"Ok to rent and watch once, but don't bother wasting your money to buy. Special water effects make this movie believable. Some touching scenes, and good acting.",1376956800,,159,4.925925925925926
5561347,2,B00B74MJOS,"Technically impressive, but as a drama it is wanting. The tsunami effects are incredible and terrifying, but the film quickly wore out its welcome. First of all, I'm no bleeding heart, but even I was shocked that it focuses almost exclusively on the effect the tsunami had on wealthy white Europeans, virtually ignoring the hundreds of thousands of Thai natives who died or were injured, except when body bags are used as props. The live residents of Thailand play one dimensional supporting roles and are never fleshed out. Second, nearly every shot is a close up, and many of those extreme close ups, of the actors' battered faces. The camera almost never backs off to show the performers interacting with one another. Everyone delivers most of their lines in a solitary closeup. Third, the massive response by the U.S. Navy and other international aid is never even alluded to.

VAGUE SO AS NOT TO SPOIL: I wondered why everyone else back at the hotel managed to get cleaned up and find some clothes, but one key character stays bloody and half naked until nearly the end of the movie.  The film's climax, supposed to be suspenseful, instead plays like a French bedroom farce, as key characters wander a crowded hospital just missing each other by seconds. Ewan MacGregor seems to be screaming ""Hey, where's my Oscar?"" throughout much of the picture.",1376870400,4,1353,4.852813852813853
5561348,5,B00B74MJOS,From beginning to end this Thailand based movie about the Sunami hit there and how it effected this family of five on their Christmas vacattion there. Highly recommended for it's real drama and heroism this family displayed in a most tragic time.,1376870400,,246,4.880952380952381
5561349,2,B00B74MJOS,"'The Impossible' is an absorbing, well-shot, well-acted film with convincing special effects. It is based on fact. It provides the experience of having one's family caught in a catastrophe with a vividness few other films have had. My qualm is with the film-makers' decision, faced with an event that killed an estimated eight thousand people in Thailand alone and devastated countless families, to take for their subject an extraordinarily fortunate family of British tourists who were violently separated and endured terrific trauma, but who managed to find each other and return home with every family member alive.

The story of this family is pretty inspiring, but should Bayona have considered making a film about a Thai family that did suffer loss, as innumerable families did? Is his message that when calamity strikes us we suffer great terror and difficulty, but it will all be O.K. in the end? And why are nearly all the other people we meet in this movie also European? Why are there so few Thai people? Why does nearly every one speak English? Amid so much destruction, why do we see barely any dead people? Did one of the only films made about this titanic South-East Asian cataclysm really have to star Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts?",1376870400,4,1248,4.914691943127962
5561350,5,B00B74MJOS,"I couldn't wait for this movie to come out so I could watch it on my 'Fire' and I was thrilled! The movie mimics various horrors around the world where in minutes the ocean is grabbing and knocking and bouncing and killing everything in it's path. I already forget the country (I'm lucky to remember anything) this family was in (Ewan, Naomi, and two sons). The family was on the beach when this nightmare began. This is a movie I could see again and again for the special effects are so real and so frightening I would have fallen off my bed but then my 'Fire' would have come with me so that wasn't an option. The story envelopes all that happens when this type of tragedy strikes and the mother and one son are together and then they are not and the father is nowhere to be seen. Everyone, as you would expect, was screaming for their children or their family and it touched me so much I cried from beginning to end. This is not a happy go lucky movie and you'll just have to see it to find out the how and the who and the where and the when  but this particular movie is worth the  price of the dvd and/or the charge to rent to your tablet but I warn you - give all the ladies two boxes of Kleenex....no make that three and some of the male persuasion may also get in a sniffle or two. DO NOT MISS IT-FABULOUS, SAD, SCARY, REALISTIC AND TRULY A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!",1376784000,,1366,4.170454545454546
5561351,5,B00B74MJOS,"My niece told me about this movie last month so I decided to buy it. This is a very intense hang on to your seat movie. I was extremely impressed with Naomi and will go out of my way to watch more of her movies. The effects were fantastic and showed what a typical family actually went through almost 10 years ago. If you like true stories of hardship and love, this is the movie for you. You can even say it is not true and still love it. I am really surprised that this movie did not get the best movie award over Argo.",1376784000,,521,3.9714285714285715
5561352,4,B00B74MJOS,"Even dramatized, this is a great real life story to ask yourself and your family ""what if this happened to us?""  What would you do, how would you be prepared?  Amazing tale of life coincidences playing out in just the right way.  Although one of the parent's decisions, if true, was absolutely beyond belief and should never have happened.",1376697600,,339,4.711864406779661
5561353,5,B00B74MJOS,"I received my copy quickly and in good condition.....I haven't watch it yet, but will venture to guess it will be in great condition. Thanks.",1376611200,,141,4.68
5561354,2,B00B74MJOS,"I couldn't watch it, too much fake emotion. It was unbearable, not that the acting was bad, but the whole movie was came off as a forced attempt to pull at its viewers emotions. lame.",1376611200,,183,4.257142857142857
5561355,5,B00B74MJOS,I have more empathy for those who went through the Christmas Tsunami after watching this moving performance. Cried and was thankful for the little stuff after watching this family struggle through one of the most difficult tragedies of this century. Naomi and Ewan were equally tremendous in their realistic portrayals of the characters. Made me want to look up the real folks and see where they are now.,1376611200,,404,4.955882352941177
5561356,2,B00B74MJOS,This is a 2 hour piano cantata focussed on the female lead.  The disaster scenes are impressive but not enough to make the film worth the journey.,1376611200,,146,4.407407407407407
5561357,4,B00B74MJOS,"Special effects created reality for the viewer on this recap of the Thailand sunami.  It shows how an experience like this totally changes people and how in the flash of an instant, our lives change.  Really good acting by all.",1376524800,,227,4.65
5561358,2,B00B74MJOS,Very slow.  the story can be told in a half an hour and it is dragged out for the length of this movie.,1376524800,,103,3.4782608695652173
5561359,2,B00B74MJOS,I was bored to death the entire time. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to catch ones attention.,1376524800,,124,4.434782608695652
5561360,5,B00B74MJOS,"Great Story and great performance, a definite tear jerker. The children are amazing actors, very impressive. I highly recommend this movie",1376524800,,138,5.619047619047619
5561361,4,B00B74MJOS,It was an excellent movie with a true-feeling of heartfelt drama. Naomi Watts was a gem. Ewan McGregor and the young man playing the fantastic oldest son rounded out this emotional true story. Wish ending had been a bit more.,1376524800,,225,4.65
5561362,5,B00B74MJOS,I bought this for my girlfriend's birthday.  We had seen this movie at the theater together and it was the best movie either of us had seen in a very long time.,1376524800,,160,4.0
5561363,5,B00B74MJOS,This movie made me cry it is an incredible story and a true miracle that an entire family could survive and then all be reunited in the end. The water scenes were great and the three little boys were incredible.,1376524800,,211,4.3
5561364,5,B00B74MJOS,This movie is a great commentary on the human condition. The underwater scenes were amazing. How did they do it?  Good movie!!,1376438400,,126,4.7272727272727275
5561365,5,B00B74MJOS,This was very life like and well done.  The flood scenes were amazing.  It was a good movie and well acted.,1376438400,,107,4.0476190476190474
5561366,5,B00B74MJOS,"About 30 minutes into this movie I realized that my jaw was clenched and that every muscle in my body was tense.

Very intense, emotional, and fascinating.",1376438400,,155,4.7407407407407405
5561367,4,B00B74MJOS,Incredible acting and moving story. Simply amazing that it is a true story. I don't know how Naomi Watts didn't win best actress for her performance.,1376438400,,149,4.769230769230769
5561368,5,B00B74MJOS,Wonderful from beginning to end...very intense...I recommend this movie to anyone! The characters really grow with you and you fall in love with them and are cheering for them the entire time!,1376438400,,192,5.03125
5561369,5,B00B74MJOS,"This is a great movie, based on a true story! Natural disasters are scary enough but to lose half of your family in the wakes of experiencing such a trauma is enough to make most people give up hope. The movie truly captures what it means to ""never give up hope"" and also, what I would imagine to be the accurate emotions and behaviors of not only both parents but the children as well. I wish I had had a tissue during this movie. Maybe even a security blanket too.",1376438400,,466,4.188888888888889
5561370,5,B00B74MJOS,"You already know whats about to happen but it's personal when you follow this families struggle to stay alive and find each other. The tsunami of 2004 almost went past me because at the time my mom was in the hospital dying, a quarter of a million people were wiped off the face of the earth and my world was centered on that one woman. Life is odd when you can't deal with any thing else the brain shuts down. Honestly it's why I remember the date of the tsunami and will never forget it.

The movie made the tsunami personal, to see the devastation of this one area knowing there were many more places hit just as hard - you wonder, what if that was my family what would we have done differently. The movie doesn't try to drag a tear out of you instead it presents itself with the facts of what happened and how this family survived the impossible.

The acting was very good especially by the kids in the film. I was concerned it would be to sad or horrific but it wasn't and I'll watch it again.",1376438400,,998,4.192708333333333
5561371,5,B00B74MJOS,Very good movie. It really brings you into the graphic experience with the individuals. Very interesting and suspense-filled. You definitely need to watch this. The most incredible part is that it's a very accurate account of what really happened with this family.,1376438400,,264,5.309523809523809
5561372,4,B00B74MJOS,"I would not sure I would be able to sit through this movie due to the subject matter.  I remember with horror watching the tsunami that hit Thailand.  This is well acted, the filming is superb, the story gripping and rather gruesome at times.  The young man who plays the oldest son, Lucas, does a tremendous job.  This is not just a story about the tsunami, but a story of a family.  The evolution of Lucas from a somewhat selfish young teenager to at times being in charge of helping his mother and the emotional and physical challenges he had.  How he at times was a scared little boy, then at times was emotionally and physically strong and took charge, to being selfish and then empathetic is a wonderful story.  Intense YES, but worth watching?  YES",1376352000,,755,4.5
5561373,4,B00B74MJOS,"Great acting, amazing story and very sobering alone the journey.  The horrors of the tsunami when it happened as presented on the news were hard to witness but this movies grit and rawness connect you even more to the tragedies events.  Well done and worth the watch.",1376352000,,267,4.659574468085107
5561374,5,B00B74MJOS,"I had to stop the video several times to just cry and catch my breath.  Gripping, in a wonderful way.  Naomi Watts is simply outstanding.",1376352000,,137,4.44
5561375,5,B00B74MJOS,"The movie starts off a little slow but builds rather nicely as the story unfolds. If you enjoy stories that involve children utilizing their discerned moral character and can be uplifted by stories that characterize hope for humanity, then you will certainly enjoy this.  This movie sheds light on the good that a community can achieve when faced with catastrophe.",1376352000,,364,5.066666666666666
5561376,4,B00B74MJOS,"I am not sure if it was because I watched it late at night, or if the movie was just disturbing in general.",1376352000,,107,3.6956521739130435
5561377,5,B00B74MJOS,This movie was heart-wrenching to watch! I cried numerous times and I'm not one to be moved by movies. FIVE STAR acting and directing!,1376352000,,134,4.625
5561378,4,B00B74MJOS,This movie was supposedly based on a real families experience during the Thailand tsunami. It was a nice tribute to them if it is true.....it shows the resilience of the human spirit in very difficult times. The cinematography really let you experience the terror of mother nature. All round good movie.,1376265600,,303,4.96078431372549
5561379,4,B00B74MJOS,I understand this was a true story about one family that livd through this diseaster.  An amazing story!  I recommend this movie.,1376179200,,129,4.818181818181818
5561380,4,B00B74MJOS,"Of all the hundreds of thousand of native people who died in Thailand (and mostly in Indonesia), it is interesting this movie would choose to depict a white family's ordeal.  That said, the story is compelling and very painful to watch.
It is unimaginable what everyone had to go through, how emergency services worked (or not) and how quickly everything had to be set up.  The best and worst sides of humanity appear in a crisis.
This movie prompted me to research more about tsunamis.  I did not realize they come in a series of waves instead of in one immense wave.  There was no tsunami warning system set up in that area.  They say they now have one and I hope to God it works.
The actors, including the children, were all excellent and definitely a loving family who had their courage tested.",1376179200,,798,4.513888888888889
5561381,4,B00B74MJOS,Stirring movie. Strong start. Middle loses it's way dramatically.  The end is exciting and heart warming.  Amazing it's a true story. Glad it was shared.,1376179200,,153,5.08
5561382,5,B00B74MJOS,"This movie is beyond words to describe.
A heart rending and gut wrenching movie based on true facts makes this even more of a humbling experience to see.
It makes you realise just so many challenges that people face in such a natural disaster and the bravery and heroism they display through the adversity.
It does show some pretty unsavory scenes and can be disturbing but at the same time that really gave the true feeling of what was experienced in that event.
Fantastic acting!  I have to say I've not found such a great movie production in quite a while.
Needed to watch a bit of humour afterwards as I did feel pretty down afterwards.
Totally gives me a lot more appreciation for the simple things in life and family!",1376179200,,723,4.519083969465649
5561383,1,B00B74MJOS,"I'm truly stunned at all the 4- and 5-star reviews.  This was one turgid cinematic experience.  The actual tsunami scenes were wrenching and terrifying, but they only occupy about 5 minutes. The rest of the movie is filled with awful dialogue, crappy
acting by everyone, and relentless ""heart-wrenching"" or ""heart-warming"" scenes, all completely unconvincing, and fueled by a noxious, manipulative soundtrack.  It was like a really lame TV movie, just without the car commercials, which would have
been much more entertaining.
Apparently this is based on a true story. I'd be curious as to how much of the real story was incorporated, because, for instance, it is truly unbelievable that (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!) the two youngest sons could survive that brutal onslaught of water by
clinging to trees.
Anyway, the whole film is so unconvincing, it is pointless to single out any particular moment.  That's 2 hours I'll never get back.  Darn.",1376092800,9,940,5.198675496688741
5561384,5,B00B74MJOS,"Although there were many news stories about the tsunami, watching this movie gave me a better understanding of how devastating the tsunami really was. Difficult to watch at times, the ending was truly 'the impossible' ---and inspiring.",1376092800,,235,5.378378378378378
5561385,5,B00B74MJOS,This really will show you the wrath of Mother Nature.  The filming of this movie is incredible.  The acting is incredible even from the kids in this movie.  Everything about this movie seems so real.  For those who are curious about how a tsunami can destroy everything in its path for miles this is the movie that can more than explain what happens and how people end up with the injuries that they have.  Don't miss this film.  It's just incredible.  I highly recommend this film.,1376092800,,482,4.534883720930233

5561388,3,B00B74MJOS,"This was just OK. Well acted but has the feel of an A&E movie. This was based on a true story, however the characters were not well developed and I did feel connected to adults in the story. The children did tug at my heart strings.

I understand this is a true story, but the initial struggle of the mother and oldest son was so compelling I couldn't help but feel bored at the hospital.

The general theme is to quickly get the viewer to identify with a group of people who will suddenly become embroiled in the epicenter of some unexpected disaster.  The movie unfolds in the events to save people while using special effects to give the viewer the experience of actually being in the disaster. This is  not a bad movie, it is just predictable.",1375488000,,460,4.666666666666667

5561407,5,B00B74MJOS,"Based on the true story of the 5 member, Spanish, Belon family, who all miraculously survived the 2004 tsunami that hit Thailand, this film was truly scary and amazing. The film took the liberty of changing the family's nationality to English, probably to accommodate the stars who were portraying them. But beyond that the story stuck pretty close to actual events, as I read them later. The special effects were incredible in this movie and left you wondering if the actors were actually in a tsunami. I don't know how the film team did what they did, but needless to say, I was impressed. The movie just doesn't disappoint in any way. The concept, script, cinematography, special effects, acting, make up....all top notch! I could go on, but I'll end this by encouraging everyone to see this movie. You won't be disappointed.",1375315200,,828,4.838028169014085

5561409,5,B00B74MJOS,"This is an extraordinary movie that will transport you back in time to December of 2004. The acting and overall ambience of the movie powerfully conveys a sense of presence, a sense of actually being there that makes it hard to believe you are just watching a movie performed by actors.

The story follows the experiences of a family of five who are vacationing in a small resort facility on the coast of Thailand when the tsunami of December, 2004 strikes the coast where they are vacationing. Each of the five family members is brilliantly cast and turns in performances that surpass the word performance; you feel you are watching real people really living through a terrible tragedy that will change their lives forever.

Each of the family members turns in totally convincing performances and are deserving of the highest praise. Henry, the father played by Ewan McGregor; Maria, the mother, played by Naomi Watts; Lucas, the oldest son, played by Tom Holland; Thomas, the middle son played by Samuel Joslin, and Simon, the youngest son played by Oaklee Pendergast all turn in realistic portrayals that convince the viewer they are watching events unfold in real time.

Equal praise is due to the director, J. A. Bayona, and the writers, Sergio G. Snchez, and Mara Beln. Mara Beln Alvrez, who is a Spanish physician, is the real Maria who actually lived the experience recorded by the movie. Maria and her husband Enrique and three sons Lucas, Simn, and Toms Beln are the ones portrayed in the movie.

Although this is a story of tragedy, it is also a story of love, devotion, and loyalty that is inspirational and positive. It does have some very intense moments and may be unsettling to more sensitive members of the family. It makes the viewer feel they are glimpsing into the humanity behind the headlines of a very terrifying event. The movie is rated PG-13.

I give this movie the very highest recommendation.",1375315200,,1920,4.82370820668693

5561418,4,B00B74MJOS,"This is the story of one European family on vacation on the coast of Thailand when it is struck by the deadly 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.  Some terrific use of real disaster footage seemed welded seamlessly with CGI to put the viewer right into the struggle for survival.  Some of the subsequent tsunami's -- like the 2011 Japanese event involving nuclear power plants -- reminds us how utterly destructive these events can be.  The appearance of low-lying Thai landscape strewn with the detris and victims was distressingly realistic.  Movies based on real life always seem more gripping to me and this tale seemed to stick reasonably close to reality.  There were ~ 200,000 fatalities in this tsunami, and I would not have been surprised at any number of deaths in the family portrayed in this story.  Some have criticized the film for focusing on one European family when so many of the victims were from the native populations.  This of course resulted from the book having been written by a European, about this family, and he survived to write it.  I have difficulty envisioning another set of facts that would have resulted in a true drama with a focus on those who lost their lives.  It would be a dreary documentary indeed.",1375142400,,1231,4.768867924528302

5561428,3,B00B74MJOS,"Amazing tale of survival, however once the tsunami hits and the movie centers on the aftermath, which is most of the film, you are subjected to scene after scene of open wounds and infection that become the focus of the visual experience.  Yes, there is some reference to people helping others during this horrifying ordeal, however you are going to be covering your eyes and cringing during the scenes of disease, vomiting, and open wounds.  I'm sure this was factual, which may have attributed to this, however it would have been nice to see more human interaction.  And when the movie is over, you see a quick photo of the actual family the movie is documenting, but no further information.  Would have been nice to have had a quick bio of how they are today and where life took them after their ordeal.",1375142400,,806,4.615384615384615

The movie showed how vulnerable we all are and how in adversity, the human spirit overcomes. The movie also depicted how life can be so odd and unpredictable: who determines who lives and who dies? Is it all really left to chance or luck or is their an order to events, a purpose to our sufferings? This movie seem to touch on all these issues. It also address the guilt that surrounds these type of traumatic events. I think this movie can also be used in an educational and therapeutic setting.

One of those rare times when my husband and I watched an entire movie together (he's the 'clicker king' when it comes to control of the remote) however, this time he made no move to switch, pause or fast forward.
The acting was superior as well as the special effects. The characters made you feel as if you had just unpacked your bags [on their vacation].
Throwing a family into this situation is one thing but surviving it rested solely on their love of one another. What a son would not do...how a Mother could hang on...and how a Father truly believed. If you don't get emontional during some of these scenes you are not human.
I found myself praying for everyone (again) that went through this ordeal...and wonder still at the shear power of nature.

It tells the rather straightforward story of a Spanish family caught by a tsunami wave while vacationing in Thailand in 2004. The mother was seriously injured - her husband and 3 kids were not. Within a brief period of time, the mother was taken to a hospital and the rest of the family was reunited in fairly short order. Yes, there was an element of coincidence at play, but overall the outcome was not really in doubt - at least for cinematic purposes anyway. More distressing however, was the fascination the movie-makers had with showing graphic wounds - especially the mother's. I get it - she was hurt - no need to keep rubbing my face in it.

My only complitant about the DVD is that there wasn't enough behind the scenes material or interviews with the real family portrayed in the movie.

5561471,5,B00B74MJOS,"****************SPOILER ALERTS***************

I feel I can't write anything better than what has already been written here here but I will give my opinion of what I took away from this movie.

This is the true story of a family on vacation in Thailand over the Christmas holiday, 2004. This is an upper class family of five (parents Maria and Henry, and three sons, Lucas, the oldest at around 12, Thomas, next at around 6 or 7, and Simon maybe 4 years old). They are staying at what appears to be a 5 star ocean front resort. On December 26, the day after Christmas, as all five are enjoying themselves at the pool. Maria opts to relax and read a book, while enjoying the antics of her ""boys.""

The impossible happens so quickly, nobody has time to gather family members let alone try to get to safety. One minute Maria was standing by a glass wall retrieving some pages of a book which had been caught up in an unexpected strong breeze. As she picks up the pages, she stops, listens and KNOWS something is wrong. As the waves cascaded over the front of the resort and finally hit the pool area, all she could do was scream for her husband and children before being picked up and swept crashing through the window, through every kind of manmade and natural pieces of things smashed by the water.

This is probably every person's nightmare. What I would like to try to convey to you that touched me so deeply in this movie was, first of all the realism that at times was excruciating to watch. I had thought that Maria would have been at the heart and soul of this tragic event replayed for us to see what mayhem can lay around the corner for any of us. But it was Thomas whose story became central as he found his mother in the initial incoming mess and literally saved her life. This young boy was exposed to a terrifying event at such a young age and proved to be a leader, a caretaker, a sleuth and ultimately the tie that pulled the family back together in the midst of chaos.

I have read much about that tsunami, and judging by the fact that the water at their resort became shallow quickly, they were at the edge of this catastrophe. Even so, this movie made far more real, to me, the events as they took place over the next 24 hours. Yes, some scenes were difficult to watch and I cried a lot throughout it. But at the very heart of this movie, as this well off family is reduced to the level of the poorest native, was the intense kindness conveyed by many who made this same journey (not all were kind, though, and happily, Maria Belon, who takes story credit, chose not to dwell on the negative, but to let the shining light of who we can be to each other as humans, experiencing a horrific event at the same time).

I am glad I watched this movie. Happy to see there is yet hope for humanity despite the things going on around us today. There were no heroes, no take charge fixer, just a lot of people trying to stay alive and find their loved ones. Let me take that back. There were many, many heroes that day, but today we will never know their names. I have one quibble with the movie which I have debated whether to drop a star or not. At the very end, when they were flown to better facilities, they flew in a rather large, empty jet. I was left wondering why, with what looked like tens of thousands of people left in sweltering heat, many with still bleeding injuries, many wearing torn clothing and no shoes. It seemed to me that this family was the type to at least try to see if others needed a lift. Perhaps they did and it didn't fit in the movie.

I highly recommend this movie if you just want a good look at humanity in chaos and how people behaved. For me, it was uplifting and hopeful. I wish the Belon family long and happy, blessed lives. For it was nothing short of a miracle, it was nearly impossible that they made it out, all five, as an intact family with mostly treatable injuries. This story opened my eyes to the many other catastrophes that seem to be taking place more and more today. It left me wanting to be involved in somehow helping people in each instance. I won't soon forget The Impossible. It left an indelible mark on my heart.",1373846400,2,4180,4.310432569974555

I recently rented 21 grams and found that I was very impressed by Naomi Watts' acting.  So I searched other movies of hers and lo and behold, found ""The Impossible"".

One could get picky and question why she and a Scottish actor were picked to act the real life roles of a husband and wife who weren't English speakers.  However, I felt their portrayals were stellar and the special effects of the Tsunami were incredibly realistic.  It was one of those ""don't watch/can't take my eyes off of the screen"" moments.  However, do not expect non-stop thrills.  It is a film which centers around the story of this family, which to me makes it special.

The story is heart wrenching, yet uplifting at the same time.  Nothing is impossible, after all.

I liked that it gives those Americans who are glued to reality shows and the Cardashians a picture of actual events of note occurring in the world.

But despite being moved by the horror and pitifulness, I did not really connect with the characters...maybe it just induced a shut down. Hard to tell, but I expected more. Do not watch this if you are not in a pretty good place emotionally.",1373414400,,675,4.810344827586207

5561498,4,B00B74MJOS,"""The Impossible"" is a drama inspired by a real-life family's haunting experience during and after the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster in 2004. What is more interesting about this Spanish film (yes, it is, though shot in English) is that ""The Impossible"" (""Lo imposible"") is the sophomore work from director Juan Antonio Bayona known for his supernatural thriller ""The Orphanage.""

Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are Maria and Henry Bennett on Christmas vacation in Thailand with three sons Lucas, Thomas and Simon. When the tsunami hits the coast where their hotel is, the Bennett family is separated from one another.

Acting is all first-rate. Naomi Watts is impressive (as always) as a mother strong and vulnerable, but the real star is Tom Holland as Lucas, whose spiritual transformation is convincing. The special effects of the tidal waves are amazing and terrifying, much more so than that of Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter,"" in showing how debris in the muddy water can hurt your body.

""The Impossible"" lets you know what to expect from the film's simple story pretty early on. Will the Bennett family (based on the Bel&oacute;n &Aacute;lvarez family) meet each other again? We know the answer, but the film manages to be suspenseful until a certain scene where things look too good to be true. After all, this is a story about the fictional Bennett family, not about Maria Bel&oacute;n &Aacute;lvarez and her family, or the less fortunate and less privileged. The story is worth telling and told well. The film does very well what it sets out to do, though I cannot help feeling that something is missing here.",1373241600,,1615,4.996282527881041

Hopefully something like this will never happen to you or your loved ones, but if it does, having seen this might give them strength to not give up, to survive.  And if it should happen again and you're blessed to not be part of it, it will probably inspire you to help, to give whatever aid you can to those effected - ergo it can make you an even better person.

PARENTS:  your children WILL see bare breasts and wounds and dead bodies - so keep that in mind as you determine if your children are old enough to watch this with you.

5561542,5,B00B74MJOS,"This is not only an amazing movie, it's a metamorphic experience: a film of such epic tragedy can make you take a hard look at your own life and rethink some of your priorities. Following what these people went through can truly make what we think of as hardships look really petty and foolish in comparison.

THE IMPOSSIBLE is simply stunning; you'll be as astounded by the heartbreaking scope of this catastrophe as you will by the technical skill it must have taken to recreate it. When I heard that the very same hotel location was used to stage this movie, I was staggered.  It actually looks as if the whole island was inundated again by the tsunami that occurred in 2004...the shots are so realistic, so powerful, you wonder how director Antonio Bayona could have put his actors through it - especially the children.

While this is a calamity of major proportions, THE IMPOSSIBLE does not try to show the horrors undergone by everyone; after all, such a task would have been impossible.  What Bayona does is follow one family during the tragedy, and in particular the spectacular Naomi Watts (as wife and mother Maria Bennett) and Tom Holland (as 12-year old son Lucas). They were put through hell - not just the characters, but the actors as well. Bayona does a masterful job of displaying the agonizing power of the waves, jerking Watts this way and that like a rag doll in a blender. While she was deservedly nominated for best Actress by the Academy Awards, the Screen Actors' Guild, and the Golden Globes, it's a true oversight that Holland was not: his performance is truly amazing.  It's hard to believe he had only provided the voice for a cartoon character before this movie. So much of the story depends upon the strength he gathers during the nightmare to somehow pull his family together; it's a powerhouse performance that displays what must be a bright future ahead.

It is an amazing story all of its own, but to realize that it's true makes it truly astonishing. Yet there are some who have found fault with this movie...without my giving away details of the tale, they criticize the fact that the story centers upon a white family of privilege, when so many Thais are used as background, their suffering marginalized. But this is, after all, Maria's story: she wrote the book upon which the story is based, cataloging the agonies her family went through. It's hard to argue with the film's priorities at that, I think. Certainly the island's horrific torment is here to see, and their agonies are clear. That it focuses on one family actually gives it an immediacy that a wider scope might have missed. It is a story about her struggles, but writ large.

I remember immersing myself in the tragedy when it occurred back in 2004, eventually feeling that I had come to an understanding about their struggles and the horrors they went through. But the impact of this movie hit me like a ton of bricks: there is NO way to understand what survivors of such an event must feel. While the force of the waves themselves was staggering, of course, equally horrendous was the disappearance of society, the total stripping away of the structure we always take for granted. Despite any struggles that we go through we always expect that the world will stop and take care of us in our times of need.  Yet THE IMPOSSIBLE is effective at showing us that here ALL is lost and even society itself has been shattered. Not even a bureaucracy can survive such an event.  This movie makes the presence of a simple orange as a thing of beauty, equally so the immediacy of a cell phone. The simple act of someone saying, ""Can I help you?"" is an achingly powerful act of generosity when it is so clear that EVERYONE is suffering here...no one came out unsullied in this tragedy. There is a moment when the central character opens her eyes and asks a three-word question I've heard said in other movies, but here it is an astonishingly powerful three-word phrase: ""Am I dead?""

See THE IMPOSSIBLE. It is at once terrifying and reassuring, blisteringly painful yet comforting, heart wrenchingly sad, yet tearfully happy. It is about the stripping away of everything we thought was permanent and the building of a firmament in its place. We see for the first time inside this tragedy, yet we emerge outside with a reborn spirit. It is a powerful, frightening, sad, hopeful, and wonderful movie.",1372464000,,4391,4.698309492847854

It was a well made film and adaptation of a true story I thought. It made me want to find out more about it. The actors even acted like they were concerned and meshed into the real life people that his happened to.

5561565,4,B00B74MJOS,"It's one thing to see images and hear stories about such a tragedy on the evening news reports, and quite another to imagine what it would be like to be a victim.  This movie takes you through that horror via the experiences of one young family.  You feel this family's terror as the tsunami rips them apart, batters them physically, and leaves them strewn about like so much flotsam.  You get to share the horror of being separated, husband from wife and children, with no way to communicate, overwhelmed by the very reasonable fear that your loved ones most likely are dead.  The shock of witnessing unimaginable carnage, and frustration of trying to survive in abject chaos is palpable. The physical devastation is documented on the evening news; this movie brings you up close and personal to the emotional and psychological devastation.  It ends well for this family, but it is not lost on you that they were among the more fortunate.

IMHO, the movie could have been tightened up a bit, a number of scenes are drawn out such that they lose their impact.  The acting was generally good.  Watts was better than good.

5561580,5,B00B74MJOS,"I am already a huge fan of Naomi Watts and this movie reminded me again why she is the best out there.  The screen shared with her and Tom Holland was some of the best and most real acting I have ever seen.  I understand why people are annoyed that they changed the Spanish family to a white family, but it isn't about the race of the person it's about the story of loss and survival.  I understand locals died as well in great numbers, but just imagine being ripped apart from your family while on vacation in a foreign country with probably little or no understanding of the language.  The people most affected were those at the beach front resorts that received a direct hit from this wave.  I think we should be mad at the government officials that failed to warn people of the impending disaster even after it struck areas and hours passed before it struck another area.  This movie is so compelling and beautiful that you get a glimpse into the extreme loss and beautiful shows of humanity from both locals and tourists.  A must see!!",1371513600,,1040,4.442105263157894

5561583,5,B00B74MJOS,"The Impossible was incredibly done, giving the average viewer the feeling of actually being caught in the Tsunami & the immediate aftermath. I'd always wondered how anyone -- other than perhaps kids, old, & the disabled -- could be killed by a tidal wave; I mean, you see the water coming & you run! The Impossible demonstrates the reality & degree of surprise such an event (i.e., tsunami) can have on anyone unfortunate enough to be in its path. And like a tornado, much of the danger is collateral to the water, with trees, objects, etc., being hurled with incredible force & speed into everyone & everything. The family this film is centered on is extremely lucky, not only to have survived with all their limbs & senses intact, but also to have found each other; I can't help but tear up when I think of the 300,000+ people who lost their lives & the hundreds or perhaps thousands of kids who ended up either parentless or missing but presumed alive (e.g., from sightings & second-hand reports).",1371427200,,1000,4.655367231638418

There is nothing like when strangers come together and the human spirit is tested. Naomi Watts is spellbinding and fearless as Maria, and I still can't believe she didn't win lead actress at the Oscars earlier this year. McGregor plays Watt's husband in the film and he turns out a solid performance as well. The Impossible is based on a true story, I also recommend watching the audio commentary which features the real Maria. I love, love, love this movie...it's powerful and so good for the soul. I highly recommend it!",1371168000,,762,4.9147286821705425

Heart wrenching of course wach with a huge bowl of popcorn and a box of tissues...
A MUST see!",1370995200,,380,4.08
5561611,5,B00B74MJOS,"The Impossible, is a drama film directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and co-produced by two Spanish companies. It is based on the true ordeal that Maria Belon and her family lived during the 2004 Tsunami that caused so much destruction within many coasts in the Indian Ocean, including the island of Khao Lak, Thailand, were the Belon's were spending their vacations. The main characters are played by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor.
The movie starts with the arrival to Khao Lak of the Bennett's Family: Maria (Naomi Watts), her husband Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three young sons Lucas, Tomas and Simon. Everything seemed to be the perfect vacation until the deadly Tsunami hit the peaceful area destroying everything on its path and sweeping apart the Bennett's family.
Naomi Watts gives a riveting performance, as you can feel her pain and suffering, no doubt why she was an Oscar nominee!. Tom Holland who plays Lucas, the oldest son of Maria, delivers a noteworthy performance as you live with him this extreme experience.
The movie is rated PG-13; however the Tsunami scene is very realistic. The aftermath is very realistic too and for some sensitive kids (as mine) that may be quite disturbing, for example, the injures that Maria had in her thorax and in her leg are very graphic and my 13 year daughter decided to stop watching it. There are no sex scenes but only three scenes were Naomi shows her half naked torso.
Overall is a great movie, with a message of hope, perseverance and endurance, in the midst of a real tragedy lived by a common family.",1370995200,,1561,4.785185185185185

5561614,3,B00B74MJOS,"Great special effects but I faulted it on several levels which is typical for this genre: Wealthy white family vacations in a third-world country oblivious to the poverty that surrounds them .  When tragedy strikes the family is separated and despite the devastation and loss of life amongst the indigenous population they miraculously find each other and survive, which puts a damper on the whole viewer experience.",1370908800,2,416,5.208955223880597

5561617,5,B00B74MJOS,"This story got to me...I could hardly sleep after I watched it.  Naomi Watts was amazing. The sorrow she portrayed for her lost children and husband and yet the determination to stay alive for the child beside her was so intense you thought you were watching a documentary.  As a parent, this would have been an unbelievable night mare and the movie sent that message right across the screen.  VERY GOOD!",1370908800,,404,4.661971830985915

5561620,5,B00B74MJOS,"For any parent this film is a nail-biter.  The dreadful scene of the enormous tsunami wave crashing onto the coast and flinging people in all directions is powerful and disturbing.  I would recommend for family viewing but there are a handful of bad words (1 F-bomb, I think--it was very quick)  There is a scene where the mother loses her sleeve and one breast is briefly viewed but not in a sexual context.  A great film for starting any number of family discussions:  what to do in an emergency or if separated from parents.  However, the death and destruction will probably be too intense for the younger crowd (under 10).  There are parts of the story that slow down a tad too much, but the overall effect is very moving.",1370908800,,726,4.538461538461538

5561622,5,B00B74MJOS,"The devastation of a tropical paradise has been done before, in movies like THE HURRICANE (1937), BIRD OF PARADISE (1932), KRAKATOA, EAST OF JAVA (1969) and WHEN TIME RAN OUT (1980). What gives this film so much power, however, is that it is based on the real life Indian Ocean earthquake, and the resulting tsunami that took place on Sunday, December 26, 2004. This is one family's incredible story, superbly directed by Juan Antonio Bayona. Imagine relaxing in a beautiful tropical resort one minute, and having your world turn upside down and turn into a in a liquid hell in a matter of seconds. The resulting struggle for survival and rejoining of the five family members makes for one of the most incredible true adventures ever filmed. By the way, folks, that's REAL WATER you see on screen - not CGI ! Personally, after seeing this superb film,  I believe the Oscars were handed out to the wrong movies-this one should've cleaned up. Highlights on this DVD include commentary, deleted scenes and featurettes.",1370822400,,1015,4.867052023121388

5561625,5,B00B74MJOS,"I don't know how they created the disaster events in this movie, but I'll tell you what, it put me right there in the middle of it all. Incredible drama, revealing the quest, and hunger of people, stricken with disaster, to fight to live, and push forward. The realism is very accurate, and not for the faint of heart. And in the very end, the light which shined into the small plane, had an almost divine appeal to it.....recommend this!",1370736000,,438,4.4875

I always enjoy Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor so I eventually chose to watch it...and was very glad I did.  Each actor played a wonderful character who was easy to connect with.  The cinematography was effective and each scene was meaningful.  The production was very well thought out.

5561644,5,B00B74MJOS,"The true story behind ""The Impossible"" is harrowing to watch.  A family on vacation is swept away by the Indian Ocean tsunami that struck on the day after Christmas in 2004.  Naomi Watts portrays a mother severely injured and separated from her husband and younger sons, with no way to know whether they survived the tsunami or not.  Tom Holland portrays her oldest son, with whom she is reunited early on.  Both actors were nominated for Academy Awards.  Both performances deserve that recognition.  Rounding out the cast are Ewan McGregor as the father in the family, Samuel Joslin, and Oaklee Pendergast as the two younger sons.  Ultimately, harrowing as it is, this is an uplifting film.  The emphasis is not on special effects recreating the disaster, but on the emotional story of the family.",1370563200,2,798,4.902985074626866
5561645,5,B00B74MJOS,"This movie was not only beautifully crafted,directed, written and casted, it took the viewer to a place of unparalleled horrors.  The small glimpses of true humanity through the chaos of it all--be it the caress of a baby brother's head or the defiance of an unaffected tourist to lend his cell phone for a moment brings to mind so many questions and issues that humanity as a whole must face, regardless of tragedies such as this. The acting is second to none by all involved. You'll be fearful, happy, in tears, and somewhat hateful at all twists and turns, much like the water itself moves you. Definitely a must watch.",1370563200,,622,4.654545454545454

so long ago, but takes through the anguish and pain this

The effects are enough to warrant a high score but the drama is palpable and it's amazingly well acted especially by Watts and the oldest son. We really enjoyed this movie from start to finish and even though the script is terribly white washed and the movie basically ignores the plight of the indigenous people, it still conveys the true horror of the event and I can't speak for others but I didn't need to see a bunch of dead bodies to understand the impact this event had on the region.",1370390400,,571,4.447619047619048

The Boxing Day Tsunami was without a doubt a horrific event and a show of force from Mother Nature.

The movie, The Impossible, for me displays the overall understanding of emotions overpowering logic and takes you deep in to how life can suddenly be changed without warning and the comforts of technology and basic necessities removed.  In one scene (I won't spoil) a very silly decision was made due to over-riding emotions which could have possibly lead to more tragedy, it's easy to pick up when it does happen.  Family values, love & being loved are shown and make for an emotional yet frustrating journey as we watch a family struggle through tragedy when everything had seemed to be perfect only moments before.  Overall this movie depicts an inspiring story of family love, tenacity, togetherness and the need to have life values close at heart in order to overcome great adversity.

As for the event itself, there really wasn't much that could have been done to avoid this catastrophe from taking so many people's lives, and all that could be done is push on for those who survived.  My thoughts remain with those who lost family members and friends and I hope to never hear of so many people losing their lives in such a short span of time.",1370390400,4,1542,4.667896678966789

5561671,4,B00B74MJOS,"THE IMPOSSIBLE is not a film about the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.  Even though it's set during that horrific tragedy, it's really the story of one family's really bad Christmas vacation.  Maria Bennett (Naomi Watts) and her husband Henry (Ewan McGregor) are ex-pat Brits living in Japan when they decide to spend Christmas at a beachfront resort in Thailand.  The film begins with a few quick scenes of the family's arrival at the resort (the three boys are sniping and whining a bit, like all kids do, and Maria and Henry are worried about whether or not they set the alarm back home and whether or not Henry's is about to lose his job). Of course none of that matters when the tsunami hits.  Maria and her oldest son, Lucas, manage to find each other in the aftermath, but there's no sign of Henry or the younger boys.  Maria and Lucas struggle to survive, are helped by some really nice locals, and end up in a crazy-crowded rural hospital trying to deal with the onslaught of victims.  Eventually we find out what happened to Henry and the boys and everyone gets to go home.  It's a feel-good movie that's a little hard to watch as it's unfolding - but don't worry, it will all be okay in the end.

Most of the criticism this movie has received has revolved around two issues - first, there's too little about what actually happened during and after the tsunami, and second, the director (Juan Antonio Bayona) decided to cast generic white actors to play a Spanish family.  As I said at the start of this review, THE IMPOSSIBLE is not a film about the tsunami.  Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. S&aacute;nchez aren't interested in giving us a wide-angle picture of what happened to Thailand or to the Thai people or to any of the other countries and people devastated by the tsunami.  They are interested in the Bennett family - or in Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n's family, to be more accurate.  S&aacute;nchez's screenplay was based on Bel&oacute;n's story about how she and her husband (not McGregor's Henry, but Quique Alvarez) survived their Thai holiday in 2004.  And as a survival story, the film works.

But what about that second complaint?  Does the film suffer because of Bayona's decision not to hire Spanish actors to play his suffering family?  Apparently Maria and Quique don't think so.  Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n worked closely with both Bayona and writer S&aacute;nchez to make sure that what happens on screen really happened to her family.  And the film makes no attempt to hide the reality of who this family really was - their names and photographs appear at the end of the film, just before the closing credits.  While I do think it would have been interesting to see Spanish actors playing these characters, it in no way changes what is an inspirational and emotionally gripping story.

Bottom line, THE IMPOSSIBLE is one of those survival films that will have you chewing your nails, weeping uncontrollably, and praying to God that nothing like this ever happens to you.  It's about survival in its most basic sense.  And if it all seems a bit ""feel-good"" in the end, then it's done its job.  In no way is this great movie; but it is a damn good one!",1370304000,7,3176,4.693140794223827

While it's a straightforwardly based-upon-a-true story, THE IMPOSSIBLE still has its share of surprises and turnabouts. The cover blurb from Mary Pols (TIME) says ""Emotionally rich and life-affirming."" I agree, but it should also be noted that this film earns every bit of its various life-affirming qualities. The initial scenes of the tsunami and its aftermath are heart-stopping in places: This is definitely one of the more disturbing PG-13s that I've seen. It's also the first film I've seen in a long while that honestly brought tears to my eyes.

Even though the pacing could use a little more of this and a little less of that, THE IMPOSSIBLE is expertly filmed and acted. Lush scenery too: It made me want to go to Thailand in spite of everything shown here. Fine performances by Watts and McGregor, with special kudos going to Tom Holland as eldest son Lucas.

5561735,4,B00B74MJOS,"Disaster movies usually have a two-pronged challenge: to make a believable film, and to make an effective film. The surprisingly good The Impossible achieves both, through amazingly realistic sets and special effects and through the intense family drama of the narrative.

It recounts the true story of a Spanish family of tourists in Thailand for Christmas 2004, right as the devastating tsunami that affected thousands hit the shores. These scenes, which actually hit pretty early on the film, are very frightening and come about as close as I can possibly imagine the true experience of living through a tragedy like that could be. The sheer force of water plunging characters below, paired with the pounding sound design (with one character momentarily deafened) contribute to the sense of horror that these characters, and real people, had to face.

In addition to the sheer technical feat of successfully recreating such a massive and devastating event, The Impossible succeeds by telling the story of a disaster so well. Like with other mass tragedies, such as the Holocaust, the bombing of Hiroshima, and many others, it is nearly impossible for any of us to fathom the loss and devastation behind the staggering numbers of fatalities. The Impossible doesn't try to do that. It follows in the tradition of other great disaster movies by focusing on a handful of people, in this instance a family, making the tragedy something we can relate to and empathize with.

This is also where the movie gets its strong suit. Sure, it's about the tsunami and the devastating effect it has on Asia, but the disaster is over 30 minutes into the film. The bulk of it, and the emotional punch of this film, is how this family and those affected in a broader sense, deal with this catastrophe. The Impossible is, at its core, a testament to the ability of a family to maintain hope and love in the most dire of circumstances. It is a less hyperbolic version of Poltergeist (a movie which I frankly don't like), to test the love of a family against true, devastating events.

We get great performances all around, especially from Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor, and fresh face Tom Holland as the family's eldest son. The Impossible is definitely one of the better movies of 2012 and serves as a nice spiritual companion to Beasts of the Southern Wild as a film about disaster and how the human spirit maintains strength even when facing the most dire of circumstances.",1369440000,,2455,4.880095923261391

5561755,4,B00B74MJOS,"THE IMPOSSIBLE takes us deep into a true nightmare that few have experienced or survived. It is an unnervingly realistic account of one family's dispair and impossible survival despite all odds.
English/Scottish couple Maria and Henry (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) and their three young boys have made the fateful decision to holiday in beautiful Thailand over Christmas. No one could have been prepared for the horrors of a tsunami turning miles of lush, beautiful countryside into a disaster zone.

The amazing realism of the tsunami and the sense of what it is like to be pulled under the water as tons of debris swirl around you is made very clear in THE IMPOSSIBLE. The realism pulls you into its own tsunami as seconds seem to last for hours. The constant movement of debris and of human beings in the churning violent water can be too much to bear at times but this is realism at its finest.

Here is one family's story. It's just one of countless stories that may never be told. It's even more a story of a mother and her son as they fight for survival and eventually hope to be reunited with the rest of their family. This is the true story of Maria Belon and her family. Ironically, the real Spanish family is now English/Scottish and their names (except for Maria's) are now anglicized.

There are amazing performances by newcomer Tom Holland (as oldest son Lucas)and Watts and McGregor. Watts brings us the pain and despair of the real Maria in her desperate struggle for life and to reunite her family. It's an amazing journey into the love and faith of one family. THE IMPOSSIBLE focuses on one family and there has been some criticism of that fact, yet their story is just one piece of an enormous puzzle. Maria Belon seriously promoted her story and survival so nothing is being given away by knowing this is a story of one family's survival.

There is a human interest story here of how people from different nationalities come together in a tragedy. There is only a brief interaction with an uninjured couple upset about the inconvenience of not being able to quickly book a flight home. How many people reacted that way? It's a subject for another film.

The scenes of the tsunami are beyond incredible and the depiction of compassion and kindess are heartwarming. A mother's love for her son is so clear through Watts's performance and the sadness of a young boy suddenly having to become a man is tough. THE IMPOSSIBLE slows down as Watts is in the hospital but then we pick up Henry's story with the two younger sons. Neither half of the separated family knows the fate of the other. No family should ever be in that situation.

THE IMPOSSIBLE will upset and unnerve some simply because of its realistic depiction of the world's biggest recorded tsunami. Watts and McGregor prove they are world class actors and young Tom Holland is an amazing newcomer with all the emotions of a boy forced into manhood. Overall, THE IMPOSSIBLE is an amazing film.",1369008000,,2972,4.683908045977011

It is incredibly well done, and I believe captures, as best as possible, what it must have been like to have been involved in the tsunami.  I don't think I could have, in my wildest imagination, even have had the slightest idea what it was like, but this movie does a great job.  It is amazing that anyone survived.

Setting aside the great special effects of the tsunami and superb makeup for injuries- the acting  was top notch by every one of the actors (children included).

5561765,2,B00B74MJOS,"Its impossible to make a movie about the tsunami and include each and every facet of destruction and devastation.  This movie focuses on one happy foreign family on vacation visiting from Japan.

The movie starts very slowly with hardly any dialogue, and at times is filmed as if with a hand held video camera.  Knowing this movie is about the tsunami you know it's not going to be happy for very long and without much wasted time the tsunami quickly hits.  The story continues, long and drawn out.  The movie is quiet, nothing but ruin as far as the eye can see.  Lotst of wasted time and fast forward moments.

The movie picks up more when they finally get to the makeshift hospital scenes, but again, not a whole lot happens there either. You aren't provided with much back story, who the people are, or where these hospitals are located. You have no idea where all of the doctors, nurses, and volunteers came from.

The wife is on deaths door one minute, goes into surgery and is on an airplane home the next.  No time frames are given.

While there isn't much dialogue, there certainly isn't any bad language. There is however, scary moments of being swept away to sea, dead bodies, and open flesh wounds.  Gaping flesh wounds really.

I certainly wasn't impressed with this movie.  I learned nothing more about the tsunami, the destruction, the death toll, the miracles, the hope, the survival, the rebuilding, the volunteers, etc.  It seemed more like it was thrown together in haste to be the first movie of its kind to air.  And then of course there were the instances of bad acting.

I really wanted to like it, and be especially sensitive to the story subject matter, but I just didn't like it at all.  I would not recommend this one.  Do some research, and find a more accurate, perhaps historical documentary on the tsunami.",1368921600,,1837,4.617283950617284

Real leveling of the playing field.
Also excellent story of that young man (Lucas played by Tom Holland) having to mature very quickly.  Naomi Watts as the mother put in a powerful performance as well.",1368835200,,603,4.463636363636364

After watching it myself, I'm highly suspicious of the legitimacy of those high marks.

Too often it seemed rather canned; not quite believable - though it did get somewhat better further into the movie. Also, the plot seemed predictable and the characters a bit cliched.

If someone were tempted to watch this film - as were my wife and I - then do it to stir the imagination about what it might be like to be in the middle of a natural disaster, especially in a context where those around you might not speak your tongue. Further, if you are from a more developed part of the world, you might think about the additional medical and emergency relief challenges that you might face in a developing country should there be something like a tsunami.

5561799,5,B00B74MJOS,"Our family watched this together and, to be honest, it was a bit uncomfortable to watch the initial destruction caused by the tsunami, particularly the damage to people's bodies, however, it was also a learning experience for all of us. Natural disasters can occur just about anywhere and I told my youngest son that, although it was painful to see young children and adults being hurt so badly, we could also learn things that we might not otherwise know about getting through a very, very difficult disaster. The deeper message we took from it was about human beings reaching out to help those in desperate need as they struggled to get through a shared crisis.",1368489600,,663,4.773913043478261
5561800,5,B00B74MJOS,"This is, hands down, one of the best movies I've ever seen. I put off watching it when it was in theaters mainly because I thought no one could possibly make a movie that would capture the true scale and devastation of this horrible disaster. I was totally wrong. This film felt real and dirty and breathless and terrifying, like you were right there in the churning water with the characters; I can only imagine how it must have played out on the big screen. The story benefited tremendously from Maria Belon's dedication to the project and her appreciation of the universality of humanity when race, money, nationality, and privilege are stripped away by a natural force more powerful than any of that. I loved that even though most of the actors were British, the main characters had no defined nationality. Where was home? Tangibly, we never knew, but that didn't matter because all home meant to the characters--all of them, from the main group to the minor players who appeared along the way--was a united and reunited family. Even the definition of family seemed to expand as the Thai villagers, Daniel, the man on the search, the older woman, the doctors, and the other injured people in the hospital all became part of one tribe. The depiction of the Thai villagers was perfect: they spoke an unsubtitled foreign language and yet you understood their compassion and dedication completely.

In a year when I was rooting hard for Jennifer Lawrence, Naomi Watts really deserved that Oscar. All the actors in this were amazing; the kids were so believable. Tom Holland as Lucas? Fantastic. Great, great movie. I'd give it 500 stars if I could. Everyone should see it.",1368489600,,1672,4.805555555555555
5561801,5,B00B74MJOS,"This feels like the most emotionally wrenching film experience of my life, and I mean that in a very good way. I've never been so totally absorbed in the emotions of the characters on a screen, for pretty much the entire duration of the film. Again and again I'd find a lump in my throat, breath caught short, teary-eyed. The trailer description nails it: ""Both epic and intimate, devastating and uplifting..."". Yeah, all that and more. Put me through a wringer and I can't wait to do it again. It feels so good to really feel something, not just observe spectacle and tragedy.",1368489600,,577,4.611650485436893

5561814,2,B00B74MJOS,"The Impossible did not deliver. It almost reminded me of a bad horror movie. The ones where lead characters make one bad decision after another. Example, separating from family members in the wake of a disaster in a 3rd world country with poor infrastructure.

Hand your young children over to complete strangers with no real idea where they going or where they will be taken.  A search for two ended up as a search for four.  Real parents in real life situations don't do this.  There are some brief moments of decent acting and I am a fan of Naomi Watts and Ewan Mcgregor..  But neither delivered a riveting performance.  I didn't see a 4 star rated movie.  It ended and everyone in the room looked at each other and shook their heads.  There is no epic journey into the human heart here.",1368403200,2,790,4.475524475524476

Watch the movie, it will get you from the start to the last minute. 5 stars all the way, at least from me it did..I feel so sorry for those who were bored by this movie.

5561820,4,B00B74MJOS,"Amazing effects and stunts along with and solid performances balance out some artistic lapses and ethical questions
in this true story of one family's experiences of the horrendous Tsunami  that killed 300,000.

The downsides; there's something a little off-putting about choosing a white, privileged family as a focus, while at the
same time showing almost exclusively other white people as suffering and afraid in a disaster that killed far more local
people than tourists.  The Thai's are certainly shown in a good light, kindly helping all these suffering whites, but even
in the hospital, almost every face we see in a bed is a white one.  That hint of odd racial insensitivity is also underlined
by replacing the original family, who were Spanish and dark, and making them into a gorgeous blond English family, a
telling choice in a `true' story.

On a more general level, the film can feel manipulative, from the tear jerking score, to the multiple ""will they spot each other?""
shots that feel like a horror film's self-conscious suspense creating frames, but that technique feels strangely artificial in this
more naturalistic setting.  There's no question it's exciting and at times moving, but it felt to me like one of those films I
would have felt even more deeply if it wasn't pushing so hard to win my emotions.",1368403200,,1325,4.945945945945946
5561821,5,B00B74MJOS,"The fact that this is based on a true story about a Spanish family made it even more enjoyable.  Articles about it indicate how close Naomi Watts worked with the mother.  Tom Holland, the young British actor, who portrayed the oldest son voiced how important and helpful it was to meet and work with the oldest son, also.  Young Mr. Holland provided an outstanding performance and was nominated and received several awards for his acting.

This family is the epitome of family resilience.  Everyone of them did what they needed to stay alive and seek reunification.  Even the two youngest boys were gutty little kids!  As a family therapist, I learned long ago that the best ""normal"" families were able to cope best when crisis hit.  They didn't crumble, the regrouped and went on.

Lastly, I read some criticism that this film did not portray the plight of the Thai people, but it did show them as most generous toward these foreign strangers and actually contributed to their success.  Without their help, it would have been almost impossible for them to survive.",1368403200,,1065,4.802197802197802

The actors give reliable performances, and everything looks convincingly real.  Despite the harrowing odds, one is apt to believe that all will turn out well in the end.  This is an odd estimation given the severe challenges involved, but something keeps telling you that the family has more than hope on their side.

Well worth watching, this film avoids most disaster movie cliches to focus on one family's story.

Finding movies without nudity in them is important to us so a quick check on other web sites informed us that this movie does have a couple of scenes containing nudity (although very brief and not sexual in nature).  We figured it was worth the risk.  It doesn't take long for the action ensue!  The devastation of the Tsunami that strikes the coast of Thailand is portrayed in excellent detail.  How the Producers and Directors were able to film this type of carnage is beyond my imagination!!  Once the wave strikes and you're following the struggle of Maria and one of her three sons, it would be easy to believe that the actors were being filmed under actual circumstances!  The magnitude of what was captured on film here is sure to be awe inspiring!  The rest of the movie is just as engrossing.  The struggle and desperation of each family members fight to survive and the strife of those they encounter is portrayed excellently.  Naomi Watts' performance is second to none and so is Ewan McGregor's!  The children in this film give a very believable performance as well.

Then when the Tsunami hits...all you see for the majority of it is members of the same family. No bodies in the water floating, no other people.

The impossible provided a realistic look at one families fight for survival in probably the largest natural disaster in modern human history. Naomi Watts does a believable acting job in her role in the movie. This movie is brutally realistic and the makeup and effects are well done. The story itself was a little slow at times and the children's acting could have been a bit better but overall this was a compelling watch. I do wish they had included more stories of people's plights include the Thai people as I thought the movie dragged a bit too much at times and could have had a broader approach to the story. This movie is definitely not one to watch with young children as it could give nightmares and the injuries in the movie are realistically displayed.

5561932,5,B00B74MJOS,"Last night my wife and I snuggled up on the couch to finally watch `The Impossible' and wound up both shedding quite a few tears.  At least I wasn't the only one crying this time.  Yes, `The Impossible' is a film designed to yank every one of your heartstrings and evoke a complete outpouring of emotions, and for that it is entirely successful.  In fact, of all the films I've seen in 2012, it is the one that most effectively tapped into my tear ducts.

`The Impossible' is one of those films that I'm really shocked was not all over Oscar's ballots last year.  It is tailor made for Oscar and yet only managed a singular nomination for its star, Naomi Watts.  It really deserved more than that.  No, it isn't the best film of 2012, but it is a stunning example of a director taking hold of a true story and making it as impactful as possible.

Not a dry eye.

The film tells the true story of a family vacationing in Thailand in 2004 when it was hit by a tsunami.  I'm sure we all remember the news coverage of the devastating event.  In fact, I can still see the images in my head of the videos that circulated the internet all those many years ago.  Telling the story of Maria Belon and her family who were separated during the tsunami and who eventually reunited despite varying degrees of distress and agony, `The Impossible' is a heartbreaking and impeccable crafted film that certainly lifts the spirits as much as it crushes them.  From nearly every angle, this film is expertly crafted and served as one of the highlights of my year.

The performances are all uniformly exceptional.  Watts, who received an Oscar nomination for her performance, is unforgettable.  The internet kind of beats down on this nomination because Watts lays down a lot.  Yes, she cries and screams and moans and lays there, but she does so remarkably well.  I never once doubted her pain and struggle, both physically and emotionally.  She nailed every ounce of passion and determination, and her smaller more tender scenes are so beautifully toned.  I mean, how can you not wretch with internal pain when she whispers ""take care of my babies""?  But she wasn't the only performance worth noting.  The entire cast was spot on, from Ewan McGregor's soulful take on Henry's tireless resolve to find his family to young Tom Holland's fantastic portrayal of a young man trying to keep his mother's spirit alive despite her waning health.  Holland in particular carries this film to new heights.  He anchors the more schmaltzy scenes and manages to breathe naturalness into them.  He takes away that feeling of manipulation despite the fact that it is a very heavily manipulative film.

This is honestly one of the most beautifully shot films of 2012, certainly more impressive than the digitally captured Oscar winner.  The way that each detail is perfectly captured in the right light, it's a marvelous thing to watch.  The underwater moments are devastatingly grimy, and the sun soaked atmosphere surrounding the wreckage and the cluttered hospitals are a perfectly balanced mix of rawness and polish.  And let's not forget about that musical score.  The best thing about musical incorporates in a film are that they can draw out an emotional response.  Whether it scare, entice, titillate, dramatize or devastate, music has the ability to transport us somewhere, and when accompanied by the right visual it can complete a scene and drive home a deeper impact.  The score created by Fernando Velazquez marvelously captures not only the heartbreak of desperation and the stunning swells of emotional uplift, but it cleverly trickles in an almost `Jaws' like aura of fear with regard to the water, even early on in the film.  It is a very complex score despite the simplicity, and it is possibly the most effective use of music I've seen in a film this year.

Listen, the complaints that came over this film have a certain leg to stand on, but not a very strong one.  What director Bayona and screenwriter Sanchez were able to accomplish here was beautifully grounded and heartbreakingly sincere.  Watching one family's desperate attempt to reunite, to survive, to make it through has the power to lift the spirits and give us hope in the power of the human spirit.",1367193600,2,4247,4.754098360655738

The Brutality that these people went through was pure hell. I don't know how the Tsunami scenes were captured but it was just like being there in this unbelievalb Horror they endured..! It was barely impossible not to cry in many scenes that broke my heart.!

This is a must have in Blu-Ray and will be glad to add it to my collection..!

I give this Movie a ""10"" out of ""10""...!!

5561935,4,B00B74MJOS,"This is a hard movie to watch just because it's a downer for the entire runtime. Not many moments of happiness. Overall though, it's a well made, superbly acted film. I thought the pacing was nice. Many people complain about it becoming slow, but after that first 45 minutes, slow is what was needed to give the audience some time to breath. This isn't a Michael Bay action film.

About it being ""racist"", I disagree. Why was the movie not about a Thai family and their struggles? Because the studio needs to sell it to the ""Western Market"" so that means making the target audience relate to the cast. Also, making the family foreigners adds more to their struggle because of the language barrier and not knowing the area. If the movie was made for the Eastern Market, then Thai/Asian's would be cast. Im sure a movie with native people of Thai would have been just as heart wrenching, if not more so. But movies with subtitles don't sell as well in the western market. The studio wants to make a profit when they invest tens of millions into a production. Put skin color aside and just realize this is a movie about ""a family"". Race had nothing to do with anything in the movie. If you thought it was racist, check yourself in the mirror.",1367193600,,1239,4.482300884955753
5561936,3,B00B74MJOS,"In the classic film ""King Kong"", Fay Wray, the only white woman in a crowd of dark-skinned natives and white treasure-hunters, is singled out by the Witch Doctor, who promptly offers five of his native women in exchange for Fay. No one blinks an eye - even the natives think the life of one white woman is more precious than five of their own people.

This thought came to me while I watched ""The Impossible"", the true story of a group of tourists who survived the aftermath of the 2004 Thailand tsunami. In real-life, the woman portrayed by Noami Watts was dark-haired and Hispanic, as was her husband. The cynic in me imagines a bunch of Hollywood producers saying, ""Nobody cares if a bunch of dark-skinned Thais or a Hispanic family suffers in a tsunami - no, make the heroes into white, photogenic Australians and you've got yourself a hit.""

Now, I'm not saying the suffering of good-looking white Australians isn't important, but ""the Impossible"" is so generic, so bland in its storytelling, that I'm forced to notice the predictable casting of the overly familiar faces of Hollywood veterans Watts and McGregor. Their ""characters"" are simply that of ""innocent white tourists on holiday caught in a disaster in a 3rd world country.""

The film is a thrill ride, nothing more. It holds your attention mainly for the following reasons: it's (a) crafted like a suspense thriller;(b) you want to see the CGI disaster scene (c) the depiction of horrific bodily injuries is gasp-inducing. If you are a med student studying trauma, watch this film by all means!

But why focus on this one couple and their family, when there are thousands of similar cases? In a good film, the characters are unique - they grow, change and learn through tragedy. Here, the filmmakers are so lazy they fail to give the events any context. The tragedy is set in Thailand but it could have been any Asian or African country. The characters begin as privileged tourists in a foreign country and depart the same way. Any possible conflict between First World expectations of hospital care and Third World makeshift facilities are avoided. Except for blood and gore, the film has nothing to say.

The only lessons seem to be: be very lucky, avoid future Thailand vacations, and be more observant when you're at the beach. By the end of the film, I half-expected to see an ad saying, ""To donate to the tsunami victim fund, visit [...]""",1367107200,8,2409,4.767386091127098

What I had an issue with is this was an enormous natural disaster in which thousand of Thai people died, but this story focuses on one vacationing white family that all survive and get to go home afterwards! Think if this had been about Katrina, and some folks from Europe or somewhere had their vacation to New Orleans ruined, a few scares, some injuries, but nothing too life altering, and then they flew home. Oh how compelling! Add in the fact that the writer, aside from not caring to deeply about the Thai people, also seems to have something against Canadians and/or Americans. Anyone who had an accent that would indicate they were from the U.S. or Canada is a total piece of garbage in this movie! One Canadian or American woman even abandons these Australian kids--who does that?! No one, that's who. Pretty much only happens in the imagination of a writer with an agenda against the U.S. or Canada. Now if any of the Canadian or American characters had been nice, or if any of the other characters had been jerks, like one of the Australians or one of the Germans, it may not have been so glaring, but no.

  I was very disturbed by the conclusion, where the main lesson was that you need to have really good insurance, which will pay for a private jet to carry you to a good hospital in a developed country.

Oscar nominated Naomi Watts gives a remarkably controlled performance as the courageous mother as does Ewan McGregor as the determined father.  But it's newcomer Tom Holland as their eldest son Lucas who provides the heart of the movie.  His transition from carefree youth to dedicated savior is brutally realistic---Holland should have a bright cinematic future.

5561967,4,B00B74MJOS,"This film was called ""The Impossible,"" which was surely a perfect name.  Perfect, as it's hard to believe that people could be so impossibly civilized.  After all, it seemed that the meanest thing that anyone did here:  refuse to hand his phone over to Ewan McGregor so that Mr. McGregor could check in with his family back home.  I've seen people far less civilized in the checkout line at Safeway.

But naturally, this film is probably broken into three standard acts, and luckily for us, we have act one -- which seemed impossibly realistic and amazing -- and the end of act three -- which redeems the film with some believability.  But act two is where it seemed the most impossible to me.

For example, let's say that you're in a hospital.  In a faraway place.  And you don't know where your father/husband is, or where your other sons/brothers are.  Wouldn't you at this point spend any possible effort and time that you have searching for those people in your own family, instead of perhaps helping others -- others that you've never met, and will surely never meet again -- find members of their family?  But naturally, this is a movie so one of our main protagonists here searches a hospital, trying to reunite those strangers for no apparent reason, other than to play Haley Joel Osment in a reenactment of ""Pay it Forward.""

Believe me, I take no pleasure in finding any weakness in this weepy flick.  I'm a big fan of Naomi Watts -- who isn't? -- but this film should have been more balanced.  I wasn't even near the area where the tsunami killed a quarter of a million people almost a decade ago, but I didn't have to be to tell you the following:  in times of crises, people in general are at their worst.  Sure, you'll find a few heroes here and there.  But looting and crime are more likely, none of which we see here.

But still, the opening act is worth the price of admission.  I could have watched that three times and been happy with the three or four bucks.  So I'll give this film a recommendation, even if most of it is, well, Impossible.",1366848000,,2062,4.477211796246649

5561977,4,B00B74MJOS,"There are times when it takes the making visual of the devastation that occurs in nature to drive home the need for our being more aware of the suffering of our fellowmen at the hands of natural disasters around the world.  Certainly THE IMPOSSIBLE  achieves that. On December 26, 2004 one of the most disastrous tsunamis in history devastated portions of Thailand, killing thousands of people and destroying the landscape and lives of many more. This is the story of a Spanish family living in Japan but vacationing in Thailand and how they coped and survived this impossible natural act. Of note the entire crew that made this film is from Spain, the original title of the film is LO IMPOSIBLE: Mara Beln shared her story which was transformed into a screenplay by Sergio G. Snchez and the direction is by Juan Antonio Bayona. The cinematography is by scar Faura and the deeply moving musical score was written by Fernando Velzquez. For the film the family of note is British in origin but even their British background is secondary to the omni-national impact of the story.

A regular family - Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three children Lucas (a brilliant performance by Tom Holland), Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) and Thomas (Samuel Joslin) - travel to Thailand to spend Christmas in a villa on the coastline. After settling in and exchanging gifts, they go to the pool, like so many other tourists. A perfect paradise vacation until a distant noise becomes a roar. There is no time to escape from the tsunami; Maria and Lucas are swept in one direction, Henry, Thomas and Simon in another. Once the storm settles the story is the strength of character and of family and of love that is able to overcome the impossible odds that they will ever be united.

The cast of the family is excellent but there are also very fine cameo roles by Snke Mhring who plays another father desperately seeking his lost family, Geraldine Chaplin as an old woman who comforts the boys, and many others who move in and out of the story quickly. The film approaches two hours in length and in the mid portion it becomes repetitive and in need of some editing.  But in ways this adds to the incredible sense of tolerance and survival of the characters. The surprise of the film, once the emotional impact begins to subside, is the brilliance of the acting of Tom Holland as Lucas, the oldest son who has inherited his mother's medical acumen and is able to help everyone around him.

I'm annoyed with myself for renting it but so thankful I didn't pay to see it in the theater. I actually fell asleep at one or two parts and my leg falling off the bed woke me up. The oldest son was wonderful; he was the star of the movie and deserves the recognition, more so than Naomi Watts. They all did a fine job acting, and God bless that family for going through what they did, but they were lucky, what a horrible tragedy. God bless everyone over there.
If you have the option to wait for this till it comes on cable or get it free instead of renting, you're better off. Not that it's horrible, it just would have been better as a Lifetime movie.",1366761600,,772,4.119205298013245
5561984,5,B00B74MJOS,"Very immersive depiction of the tragic tsunami of 12/26/04 based on the true story of one family's experience while spending that Christmas at a resort on holiday in Thailand. Great acting and action with a lot of heart. It's pretty visceral, so be ready to get a gut-wrenching feel for what it may have been like to try and survive in the middle of the chaos. I think they did an outstanding job making it look real and keeping the action and drama going after the initial impact. The dialogue isn't exactly out of The King's Speech, Lincoln, or a Shakespeare play but with something like this you really just needed the key actors (Watts & Holland) to get the emotions across and for the filmmakers to make it look and feel real, which they all did in a powerful way. And while the actual video footage of this tsunami was relatively limited for its scale, compared to all the footage of the more recent and less fatal Japanese tsunami, the filmmakers really got it right and did a good job expanding on it for what little they had to go by.",1366675200,,1043,4.4375

5562008,1,B00B74MJOS,"Hokey, and way too sappy, Hollywood reimagining of the 2004 tsunami that washed away and killed over 230,000 people, including washing away this one insufferable family on vacation in Thailand. The opening 15 minutes of ""character development"" for this bland family offers no character development whatsoever except one kid is mean to his brother and Mom and Pop are concerned about money, so it's off to a pretty lame start right from the get-go.

Then the wave hits and it looks pretty much just like high tide at Zuma Beach, although you do see one whole car being washed away. Wow! Even though the resort the family is at is full of people, once the wave hits, the only two people who we see and who can stay afloat (separately, I must add) are Naomi and one of her kids. They yell to each other from afar as the second wave rolls in, and finally manage to swim into each others' arms in Hollywood schmaltz at its finest. How touching! The music swells to high heaven, of course. A couple of bloody marks on them, that's it, whereas the strength of a real tsunami would have ripped them to shreds. Yes, I know this is based on a true story, but there is nothing the least bit realistic about the way any of the drama or action taking place in this film is depicted. Seriously, for a disaster that killed thousands and thousands of people in the blink of an eye, Naomi and her kid ride out the waves as if it's family day at Raging Waters. From then on, it's just one unconvincing development and cliche after another as these survivors spend 90 grueling (for the audience) minutes meeting native survivors and other annoying characters, all filmed with super-annoying shaky cam and with over-stylized editing. Why do we care about these people? Well, we don't, not at all. So let's now cut away 1-hour in to tell Ewan's story instead. That will keep the viewers watching!

Even the tsunami's aftermath is laughable. As soon as they drive a little bit inland, there's no devastation, just random injured people sitting or laying at the side of the road. Has the director never seen any photographic documents of the devastation that this tsunami actually left behind?!?!?! If not, maybe he could at least look at some of the many youtube clips of the tsunami that happened in Japan to see how much wreckage and devastation a tsunami wreaks. Any of those real-footage clips is a million times more powerful than any one second of this sappy, Lifetime movie junk.

THE IMPOSSIBLE is akin to watching a mom and kid fall off a slide at Raging Waters. They get bruised up a little bit, and then we have to watch Mom and kid's trek to their car in the Raging Waters parking lot, and then Dad tries to get off work and treks over to meet them there. Will Naomi reunite with Ewan, and will their insufferable kids be nice to each other from now on? If you care about either part of that question, this movie is for YOU. Otherwise, steer clear of this excruciatingly banal insult to the memory of anyone who has died, or even survived, such a horrible disaster. The scene where the three kids reunite and the overly emotional music swells, I almost vomited in my mouth. Cliched, poorly directed and edited, terrible script, unconvincing effects, sappy score. Oh ya, I almost forgot, you get to see an even longer depiction of the tsunami near the end of the film as Naomi dreams about it; wherein a CGI Naomi does 'battle' with branches and other underwater debris! Just like in a cool videogame! Hey, it's a little more convincing than the kiddie wave shown at the start of the film, so I'll give it that, at least.

Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are always terrific, and they are both terrific here, but even they can't save this junk. One of the year's worst.",1365552000,17,3756,4.5517751479289945
5562009,5,B00B74MJOS,"The iconic and great late Roger Ebert expressed in his review of The Impossible that he had felt the re-creation of the Tsunami in Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter"" could never be surpassed. He changed his mind after screening The Impossible.

Horrifying, overwhelming and in it's own right magnificent the effects of one of the worst natural catastrophes in history is so real, so exceptional that you'll find it hard to breath during the sequence of when the Tsunami hits Thailand.

Director Juan Antonio Bayona creates a searing visual and sweeping movie free of cliche' and manipulative shock value. The Impossible has far less to do with the tragedy of the Tsunami and everything to do with it's aftermath as seen through the eyes of one family who survived it.

Naomi Watts it's fearless and much of the film is carried by her along with an exceptional performance of the oldest son Lucas played by young actor Tom Holland. A boy thrust into the terrifying role of care taker, protector and the chemistry between Watts and Holland is electric.

A solid cast all around, Ewan Mcgregor as the husband and father Henry is deeply quiet and complex as he searches with unrelenting determination for his family. The Impossible - is brimming with small moments of profound beauty, they unfold with ease, free of grandstanding and like a memory are over almost as soon as you witness them but they linger - this is the stuff of great story telling and superb movie making.

""The Impossible"" is not of a disaster film it's a reflection of the human heart, the unexpected gift of kindness from strangers - and above all, the power of love and the steel like tenacity of the human spirit.",1365552000,,1678,4.772413793103448

5562018,4,B00B74MJOS,"I just watched a 12-year-old boy become a man. After 114 grueling minutes of calamity piled upon disaster followed by tragedy, I got a lump in my throat along with the rest of the audience as we saw a dauntless family do its best to cope with a vacation gone very, very wrong. ""Lo imposible"" is based on a book by Mara Beln which in turn was inspired by true events that occurred during the catastrophic tsunami that devastated southeast Asia in 2004.

We follow:
  * Naomi Watts (""J. Edgar"") is Mara, a physician who has suspended her career to raise a family.
  * Ewan McGregor (""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"") is Henry, her husband, who has concerns about his job but most particularly whether or not he re-set the house alarm when they left for their vacation.
  * Tom Holland (voice:""The Secret World of Arrietty"") is Lucas, a mildly rebellious tween but a good kid. Once he and his badly injured mother are stranded in the bewildering detritus of the tsunami, he is the stronger and the healthier of the two. He never hesitates.
  * Samuel Joslin (in his first movie role) is Thomas, the tyke charged with the responsibility to watch over his even littler brother. He is truly alarmed and his scene with his father is brilliant.
  * Oaklee Pendergast (""EastEnders"") is Simon, the little brother who really has to pee!

Much has been made over the myopia of Western Europeans making a movie that features a white family in the midst of a tragedy that killed over 200,000 (mostly local) people. I could argue that these locals are portrayed in the very best light: they instantly spring to the aid of any and everyone, are kind, considerate and life-saving whenever possible.

Director Juan Antonio Bayona (""The Orphanage"") has created a masterpiece that is surely the envy of directors who specialize in disaster films. The scope of this one is astonishing. I have no idea how much of it is Computer Generated Imaging, how much is from news clips and how much was staged, but suffice it to say, it is truly impressive. First the tsunami itself, then the ravaged land with the villagers who immediately come to help, the field hospitals that are quickly set up and the emergency care that is mobilized, are mind-boggling. All combine to make me proud that I'm a human being.

As expected, the adults in this film are terrific, but the children are exceptional! The PG-13 rating is for the intensity of the suffering and the scope of the tsunami. A loving family is what we are there to see and we get to see it! You'll enjoy your DVD from Amazon.",1363996800,75,2549,4.610619469026549
