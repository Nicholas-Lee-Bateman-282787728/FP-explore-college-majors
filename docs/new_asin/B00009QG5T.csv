Thank you",1129939200,,68,3.533333333333333
1888228,5,B00009QG5T,This is a great intro into the Little House Series.  Great for Kids to watch.  It's a great buy to teach our children what it was like to live while the United States was becoming a great Nation.,1128038400,,195,4.105263157894737
1888229,5,B00009QG5T,One of the most awesome series ever!  It's a classic that lives on and on.,1124582400,2,74,3.933333333333333
1888230,4,B00009QG5T,"This movie is what started the series which became a HUGE SUCCESS.

Its a nice movie 2 introduce u to the characters and to show you what a tough life The Ingalls have.

Mum & I always sit down & watch this series together,Its a real family movie/series.",1123977600,2,254,4.270833333333333
1888231,5,B00009QG5T,"I grew up watching the repeats of ""Little House On The Prairie"" on TBS however I have never seen the pilot movie. I don't think it was put into syndication? ""Little House On The Prairie"" premiered years before I was born, suffice it to say it has been one of my favorite television shows because it is a rare combination of both entertainment and family values. In fact, I cannot think of any television show that is as beloved as this wonderful series.

The pilot movie introduces the Ingalls family for the first time. The characters aren't as polished or well-rounded as they are in the TV series. The pilot also introduces their longtime family friend Mr. Edwards.

It starts out by telling the story of why they left their original home (and relatives). Charles finds a nice piece of land and sets up his residence for his family. It is at this time that they meet Edwards who helped in the construction of their new home.

Also included in this movie is a very touching Christmas scene (that was repeated in subsequent ""flashback"" ""Little House"" episodes) where the Ingallses celebrate their first Christmas in their new home. Mr. Edwards even plays Santa by surprising the entire family with his cheer and gifts.

Keep in mind that this is not set in the town of Walnut Grove (where the TV series took place). In the pilot movie they lived in a different location which was even more remote with no town and no neighbors to speak of (except the Native Americans who befriend the Ingallses).

Tragedy strikes when their log house catches on fire. I thought it would all be burned down, however they were blessed with a beautiful rainstorm which saved their home and barn.

But their happiness is short-lived when the government tells Charles that they have to vacate. The land is not for them; so they pack up their belongings and say good-bye to Mr. Edwards and go on their way to find a new home.

The movie ends with the Ingalls family riding away. This somewhat loosely explains how they came to their new town (Walnut Grove) in the TV series.

Unfortunately, television these days doesn't even come close to the high standards that Michael Landon set forth on ""Little House On The Prairie."" This is a wonderful pilot and a wonderful TV series!",1103932800,231,2254,4.6457286432160805
1888232,5,B00009QG5T,"It must have been late 1974 when series one of 'Little House on the Prairie' first aired around 7 in the evening on BBC1 here in the UK.  At first I never gave this series a look in and it would be another two years before I sat and watched an episode (""Remember Me"") all the way through, this time on the opposite channel, ITV for the London region (otherwise known as Thames Television).  From then on I would watch it regularly in its Thursday at 4.20 slot immediately after getting home from school.  Mother would also rush in to watch with me and it became a firm favorite of ours.

In the early 1990's Channel 4 Television bought 'Little House' and promised a complete screening promptly starting with ""Harvest of Friends"".  No one I knew who was a fan of the show seemed to realize there was a pilot movie which made me wonder if it had ever been broadcast in the UK.  However a book I had - and still have - listing movies on TV has an entry for it so I knew that it existed.

As you can imagine I was delighted when I spotted that The Pilot had been released on DVD and that complete episode seasons were also coming out as boxsets.  I couldn't wait and quickly purchased this together with the first season knowing that I would be in for some really satisfying entertainment.

The Pilot is a stand alone TV movie that sells the concept of a harsh life on the Kansas plains very well.  It isn't difficult to see why NBC invested in future episodes as the writing, directing, and performances of the cast are first rate.  The music by David Rose (Bonanza), is also unforgettable.

Presented in a bright case with a photo of Michael Landon dominating the cover, the film itself is exceptionally sharp and colorful.  There is a slight warping on the sound but it's not too off putting and I would still recommend this DVD to any ""Little House"" fan.

Well it may have taken me 30 years to see this film which is absolutely ridiculous when I consider the number of times I have seen the series.  I got there in the end though thanks to this DVD and for this alone it gets 5 stars.",1100822400,22,2084,4.3076923076923075
1888233,5,B00009QG5T,"An excellent family movie and a must to own if you also have the series.

This movie tells the Ingalls story before they reach Walnut Grove. They settle and build a new home and their new life. Only they are forced to move after it is discovered that they have built their house on Indian territory.

The quality of the movie is excellent and you just can't go past looking at the extras.",1099785600,22,388,4.301369863013699
1888234,5,B00009QG5T,The Pilot episode is great but I wish it had been included on the Season 1 boxed set.  All of the other 2 hour special episodes are being included.,1099267200,34,147,4.068965517241379
1888235,5,B00009QG5T,"Little house on the prairie is the greatest show ever.
The pilot was not aired here in France. I know folks who had bought the VHS so I could see it. But I ordered the DVD anyway.
The quality is great, the pictures are wonderful, much more than the VHS. It is so great to hear the original voices! And funny to hear the Osage chef speaking french with such an accent! :-))
Anyway, the DVD is worth the buy, you won't be disappointed and although it is encoded region 1 ONLY, you can perfectly see it with ALL DVD player as it's written behind ""zones (1-6)"".
I absolutely recommend this article for all the fans and the others. It's the beginning of all, you discover the characters, you love them!
Everybody acts so well they don't look like acting. It seems that you are looking your dreamed-neighbours by the window!!
Well, buy it, even in other countries than USA, because it's not very expensive regarding its value.",1061424000,20,920,4.482142857142857

1888291,4,B00009QG5T,"If you are reading (or teaching) the book ""The Little House on the Prairie,"" this is the best movie to show afterwards, to visualize all the incidents in the book. It hews very closely to the book, without being overly long. There is a newer take on the same story, but the pacing is too slow (though the production values are better in the new one.) Also, these are the actors you remember from childhood. I teach this book to adult ESL students, and they enjoy seeing this film after they finish reading the book.

The lessons throughout the entire series give us a glimpse to a time when we lived differently; with a pioneering spirit, a determined strength and dream for building a better life which were acted upon with the entire family unit. Watching it shows us how culture has shifted and how so many values have been discarded in exchange for technology and ease, ie: a fast food mindset. I enjoy watching this series with my children and a lively discussion always results which brings our whole family back to center - remembering what is truly important in life and how we must consciously work to be the best people we can be.

If you have red the book you know what will happen in the end.  Frankly, the whole thing, even if you do now know the events from the book, seems a tad predictable.

1888669,4,B00009QG5T,"The pilot covers the time period when the Ingalls family lived on Indian land near Independence, Kansas.  This all happened before they moved to Walnut Grove, Minnesota.

The movie follows the book closely, and while that's great for Laura Ingalls Wilder purists, the tensions between the Indian tribesmen and the white settlers may be more than some want to explain to their young children. Half naked warriors coming into the cabin and ""touching"" Ma while the girls cower fearfully behind a blanket may be a little much for young and tender sensibilities.

Also, the actors hadn't really defined their characters yet, and so may seem a little different than how you remember them from the series.  Pa sure does seem to spend a lot of time yelling angrily at Laura...

But then, this is a special movie.  For those not fully acquainted with the books, Little House on The Prairie was about the cabin in Independence, Kansas.  The Walnut Grove community of the TV series is actually told about in the book ""On The Banks Of Plum Creek.""

The movie opened with the following quote. The Ingalls family is shown standing with Caroline parents in fron of her parent's house as Laura gives this opening quote. If I had a remembrance book, I would mark down how it was when we left our little house in the big woods to go west to Indian Territory. We had to go, Pa said, because so many people had come to live in the big woods, there wasn't enough game anymore for him to hunt and he feared we might go hungry. Ma said we might never again see Grandma and Grandpa, or Aunt Docia and Aunt Ruby and Uncle George. Though it made me sad, I still thought it a fine thing to go where there had never been a road before. We'd go where the land was more bountiful, he said, and he sold our house and land and cow, and packed whatever would fit in the wagon. I was glad Pa took his fiddle, for it makes a joy some sound. Mary was afraid to go, but I knew nothing bad could happen as long as we had Pa and Jack. Jack is my best and truest friend and Pa says there has never been a better watchdog. I knew there would be rivers to cross and hills to climb, and I was glad, for this is a fair land and I rejoiced that I would see it.  So Charles and his family headed West towards Kansas in attempt to start a new life however, getting wasn't easy. The Ingalls family had to deal with high rivers that were treacherous to cross. Wild weather that includes thunderstorms and heavy down pours. So once they reached Kansas the family set up home that included a small house and small shed that stored there animals. Here are some questions that made need answer as you watched this movie. Do the Ingalls get the new start as they were hoping for? Where does stranger Isaiah Edwards play in all this? Here are some of my own thoughts about this TV movie that turn into a hit TV Series. I thought this movie was kind of a sequel to the Walton's with the only difference being that the Walton's was during the depression while the Ingalls was in the Western times. I didn't really care too much for this and I'm not sure why? There was no leading lady in this picture nor was there very much drama that kept you on the edge of your sit like other shows.

Now that my grandchildren are 4 and 3, I thought they might like it, so I loaned it to my daughter.  They watched it over and over and kept it for a few months.  When it was almost Christmastime and time for me to watch it, I just ordered another one for myself and let them keep it, since they enjoyed it so much.

1888689,4,B00009QG5T,"Little House on the Prairie is a show that cannot be forgotten, anyone who knows about this television series has enjoyed it...who couldn't, and I am deeply grateful that Laura Ingalls Wilder made this all possible with her books that I immensely enjoyed reading. The reason I love this show is because of my interests in this time period in American history, America's population had been growing and traveling to the west, the hostility (and peace) between the American's and the many Indian tribes and the extraordinary efforts of these pioneers. I'm a fifteen year old male (boy, who cares) and these stories still unfortunately make me cry sometimes since I consider myself a sensitive person and my emotions come through sometimes. This time period is much to be desired, while America has advanced in many areas (especially in technology) I think respect for family, community and the more simplistic enjoyments in life have became a thing of the past. These programs always make me want to (while not always) start working a bit harder and try to respect others. (although my sarcastic attitude comes through) While yet I do not believe there is a god I do like the Ingalls religious beliefs, there strong moral beliefs and I think these heartwarming stories also have made this television series a classic.

The pilot focuses on the Ingalls family's struggles leaving the big woods and trying to start life a new on the prairie. Now anyone who's reading this must have seen the show, but if somehow you haven't, let me tell you, the acting is some of the finest that's ever been on television and that is as simple as I can put it. Now the reason I'm not giving this one disc DVD a flat out five stars is easy, the pilot could have easily been featured on the season one DVD and that this DVD is pretty much a bare bone set, the bonus features are extremely measly, all there really is on this set are a few cast member biographies and you know there desperate when they include the scene index as a `special feature.' This lack luster attempt is not unnoticed because this show deserves much better and that's why I'm not all impressed while yet still pleased that the show has been released on DVD. The restoration of the pilot is decent while there are a few moments of blurry and grainy film but otherwise the quality of the footage is quite nice.

I have some advice for newcomers to this series, throughout the series if you see the words Directed by Michael Landon, get ready to have a nice long cry and enjoy.",1216339200,,2526,4.6236080178173715

1888691,5,B00009QG5T,"I purchased this item on Amazon a few days before Christmas, hoping that it would arrive before the tree came down, and it did.
I am a rabid raccoon of a ""Little House"" fan and this is a must for any afficionado. It's the story of the Ingalls family boiled down to bare bones: heart, love, courage and faith. The disk is a little skimpy on the extras, but who needs extras when there are so many memories that come pouring forth the minute the DVD starts to play. Remember when the Ingalls girls were young? They were never younger than in the Pilot. Remember when Karen Grassle pretty much cemented herself as the prettiest Ma on the wild frontier? She was never more radiant than in this introductory episode. And remember when you believed in Santa Claus? You'll believe again in the spirit of Christmas when Mr. Edwards appears at the Ingalls' door, frost-bitten and determined to bring the girls Christmas presents, no matter the weather.
The DVD does contain a bit of trivia I never knew. The actor who had been cast as Charles Ingalls was late to the set on the first day of shooting, so Michael Landon, who was supposed to have been just the executive producer of the show, filled in for him. I don't know who the man who could have been Pa was, and I cannot imagine the show without Michael Landon's gentle presence as the Ingalls patriarch. He made the series in so many ways, even as it plowed toward the melodramatic at times.
You'll watch this with tears glistening in your eyes and will find your heart warmed like so many of Ma's campfire stews. And when the wagon takes off at the end for another settlement, you'll want to follow them.
A brilliant beginning for a timeless series.",1198972800,3,1697,4.512987012987013
1888692,4,B00009QG5T,"This is not included on the Season one disc set, so I was very glad to see it sold as a separate DVD.  You know the story - Pa packs up the family and moves to Kansas, where they face all kinds of challenges and meet the infamous Mr. Edwards.

Like all of the Little House series, it's cheesy family-friendly goodness!",1190592000,,318,4.19672131147541
1888693,5,B00009QG5T,"I loved Little House on th Prairie when I was a kid. When I saw my daugther watching old re-runs of the show on tv with the same kind of enjoyment I had as a kid, I decided to buy the whole series.  The first season doesn't include this show, which I think you should have to start off with. The Pilot shows how the family winds up in Walnut Grove in the first place.  This series is one you are happy to have your children watch.  Many shows on tv now are not suitable for young kids to watch. This is one you can allow your children to watch without concern.  I watch them with my daughter often and really enjoy them.  It provides a nice bonding time for us.  If my daughter watches it on her own, I don't need to be concerned about what she is seeing.",1190592000,,755,4.0
1888694,5,B00009QG5T,Excellent. Was looking for this one as i recall i saw the very beginning but it wasn't in the first season dvd collection. So glad i found it!,1187308800,,142,4.107142857142857

It was good to see how the series started I am eagerly awaiting Season 1 to arrive next month",1184457600,,167,4.21875
1888696,5,B00009QG5T,"A series for the whole family. Something for everyone. Great actors, including the children. Good background scenes, alot of horse drawn rigs. Get a feel for the way life was many years ago. Go back in time and enjoy.",1178928000,2,217,4.589743589743589
1888697,5,B00009QG5T,"This was my favorite book series as a child, but somehow I missed the premier of this series.  I saw the first episode of the tv show, but never saw the original tv pilot.  I bought this and loved every second.  I highly recommend this to any Laura Ingalls Wilder fan.",1171670400,2,268,4.215686274509804
1888698,5,B00009QG5T,I am a Little House fan so this was a must have for me.  You will not be dissapointed.  The pilot is based on the time before the Ingalls family live in Walnut Grove.  You also meet Mr Edwards.  My passion for this series began with Michael Landon and his creative genius for delving into positive family values.  I look forward to the time when my children are old enough and we can watch the series together.,1168992000,5,410,4.2727272727272725

1888710,4,B00009QG5T,There are a couple of things missing in this movie that are in the book but not too many.  I always loved the series but this pilot was great to go back and watch.  reminded me that I love the books.  Go old school and rewatch it.  I intend on buying the whole series.  I want my kids to watch them all.,1168473600,3,303,3.8225806451612905
1888711,5,B00009QG5T,"This was a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours.  This was a much loved programme from my childhood, but until now I had never seen The Pilot.  Well worth watching if you want to watch the series, as it fills in a few bits about where people originated from.  This programme still brings tears to my eyes.  Loved it.",1168473600,,320,4.19672131147541
1888712,5,B00009QG5T,"My wife is a big fan of this show and watched it growing up. I have seen several episodes, here and there, but this pilot really sets the groundwork for the rest of the series. I really enjoyed it.",1168300800,2,197,4.076923076923077

1888714,4,B00009QG5T,"At last I got to see how it all started! In later episodes the characters were ""richer and deeper"" but this was thoroughly enjoyable. Michael Landon's fantastic directing is truly amazing.",1142121600,4,188,5.096774193548387
1888715,4,B00009QG5T,"This Pilot-episode DVD is a must for any Little House on the Prairie Fan. It is not included in any of the DVD season sets. It tells the story of the Ingalls' trip from the ""Big Woods"" in Wisconsin, to the land they first settled on in Kansas- before settling in Walnut Grove, MN. The story introduces you to the entire Ingalls family, and also Isiah (Mr.) Edwards. Though not as good as the eventual episodes and seasons that followed, it is sure to complete your Little House collection.",1140912000,8,489,4.50561797752809
1888716,5,B00009QG5T,The  pilot show for the Little House series was the beginning of what I think was one of the best shows ever on TV. A real family show that shows the closeness of the family struggling for a new life on the prairie.,1140825600,3,215,4.0

WATCH THE PILOT AND SET YOURSELF UP FOR THE REST OF THE SERIES.

THOROUGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1140739200,4,393,4.850746268656716
1888718,4,B00009QG5T,"This is the movie that started it all. It tells the story of how the Ingallses moved from thier ""Little House in the Big Woods"" to the Kansas frontier. It's a good family story. The only other chaacter to join them in Walnut Grove is Mr. Edwards. The family faces wolves and friendly Indians, but are forced to move in the end. The story is full of tolerance and love. The characters have rough edges that wear off as the series develops. A great movie and a good series. They don't make TV like this anymore.",1136505600,12,509,4.3125
