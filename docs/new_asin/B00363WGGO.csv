4072124,1,B00363WGGO,"This show embodies the summum of materialism, the very worst in mankind. How can one be so completely preoccupied with the exterior, and not care about (or not see) what that makes them into? The Hills' cast consist of models. People who are seemingly so drawn into life's popularity contest that anything else ceases to be important to them. The entire globe could be in the middle of some horrible disaster, while these shallow fashion whores' only worry would be finding a pair of shoes that goes with their Prada purse. For some reason, watching this show reminds me of the infamous statement made by beauty pageant contestant Lauren Upton (the URL below). I wonder if this show's cast could find the USA on a world map...",1275523200,4,726,4.724409448818897
4072125,1,B00363WGGO,"This show has gotten so fake that its ridiculously bad! MTV has hired these people and they end up on the show to make it crazier. Like Stacie, the bartender who was caught dating Spencer while he was engaged to Heidi....now she is a ""cast"" member who is ""best friends"" with Kristen Cavallari. Another example; Enzo. That little boy who is telling Heidi what Spencer is doing (like going to the doctor hoping to get tubes tied to prevent Heidi getting pregnant.) MTV has hired him and Stacie to the show. And all the scenes now are staged and that's bullcrap because it was a really nice show.",1275350400,2,593,4.5
4072126,1,B00363WGGO,"Pretty fast. I think it's because of Kristen Cavallari but again at the same time its probably Spencer. What isn't caused by Spencer Pratt? I like Heidi but I agree with the other reviews, Spencer has brainwashed her. She would have so much more going her if she dumped him. This season is the worst yet. Definitely not recommended if you're a fan of the earlier seasons. Come back Lauren!",1275350400,2,389,4.571428571428571
4072127,1,B00363WGGO,"I recently purchased this season on DVD (now I own all the seasons) but this season totally sucked! Its just not the same without Lauren.

KRISTEN CAVALLARI -  She's a b***h. Can't stand her, she just gets the other girl's boyfriends just to start drama.

STEPHANIE PRATT - Sister of Spencer Pratt. Friends with the other girls. Starts three fourths of all the drama on the show. Loves the attention.

HEIDI MONTAG - She's my favorite cast member. But Spencer has just brainwashed her to nothing! She looks amazing before and after her plastic surgery. When her family and Spencer have a problem together she always sides with him...even when he is wrong and starts, and looks for issues. I really hope she kicks him to the curb soon. Her career would take-off but Spencer holds her back and just brainwashes her to nothing. Wake up Heidi. Please!

LO BOSWORTH - She thinks she is taking laurens spot and shes not. She has a peppy attitude that I cant stand at all. She hangs with her friends' enimes to get the scoop but all she really does it start drama.

AUDRINA PATRIDGE - Seriously girl, I like you a lot but pick a guy already and quit running back to Justin. It gets really annoying!

SPENCER PRATT - Spencer. Spencer. Spencer. Do I really need to say more?

BRODY JENNER - Dump that annoying girlfriend Jayde already. And believe it or not, he likes the drama and he wants more. I've seen cardboard boxes with more personality.

JAYDE NICOLE - Nasty looking girlfriend of Brody. Wants and likes the attention she gets.

JUSTIN BOBBY- Get off the show already. Quit popping up at these parties and ""not knowing"" Audrina is going to be there. It gets really old. She looks really grubby and I know she can do better than this guy.",1275350400,4,1737,4.538461538461538
4072128,3,B00363WGGO,"When the final season of the hills was announced by MTV, the shows creators made the statement that they felt that the story has been told. I could not agree more. It's very obvious that when Lauren Conrad left the show that it was destined to go down. The decision to bring Kristen Cavalleri to the show right after Lauren left was a move made in desperation. The novelty effect has worn off very quickly.

I am going to rate this season a 3/5. It's only semi-entertaining at best.  The series has definitely reached it's expiration date. It's basic Hills: the gang getting drunk and going out, ""drama"" between whoever is having casual sex with Brody Jenner and who ever wants to or used to, random vacations where they all just party, Audrina dating random dirty looking guys, one girls talking about another girl behind their back regarding something petty, Heidi and Spencer ""fighting"", etc. It's worth watching for the hot body of Audrina Patridge, but not much else.

The best thing that the creators of the show could have done would have been to scrap the series after season 4's Heidi and Spencer wedding episode. I am convinced that if the series were to continue to a season 6 or 7 in it's current form that even the most hardcore Hills fan would agree.",1272412800,4,1264,4.608888888888889
4072129,2,B00363WGGO,"The Hills Season 5 Part 2
10 Episodes on 2 Discs (2010) being released on DVD April 27

""The Hills"" is a ""reality"" soap opera taking place in Hollywood with several similar characters. If you've never seen the series before like me, you'll have trouble even distinguishing the girls from each other and the guys from each other because they all look a little alike and have similar hair styles. The distinctive pair are Heidi and Spencer because they have been plastered everywhere else on magazines.

The cast is full of superficial semi-celebs who never have in depth conversations, all very shallow surface value interactions and spouts. Kristen Cavallari enters the scene to take up where Lauren Conrad left off. She narrates the introductions explaining what happened last episode and what is to come. She is painted as the ""b*tch"" because she is more independent and outspoken than the other ladies and when she is crossed over by guys, she cuts them off. The other girls seem completely dependent on men (and in Heidi's case, babies) being in their lives and respond to their every beck and call. The whole series is a step back for women's liberation in some ways, but at least Kristen gives a slightly different perspective. Some of the girlfriends are just there to hear the others whine and they don't get to have their own romances because they have to be the shoulder to cry on and are all too happy to spill secrets to people they aren't supposed to. Very catty and gossipy which are some of the worst female qualities to display but some young teenage girls are really into this sort of things these days unfortunately.

The fabricated drama and scripted arguments are obvious. The girls are told to fight and they just start going off without anyone listening and having back and forth in conversation and no one needs to scream at each other like that in the real world.

Spencer and Heidi are so annoying and never listen to each other. Heidi's voice is so sharp and it is grating on the ears. Once they are married, they need to buy a big mansion and fight about it. Once they have a mansion, they fight about wanting to spawn children when they are too immature to deal with each other. They are given situations like babysitting just to prove how ignorant and incompetent they are. Everything I've ever heard rumors of on magazine covers and in news when I had never seen the show appears to be true about their personalities. In real life or fake reality life, run the other way! It seems too easy to say it, but Spencer Pratt is presented as the biggest brat ever with probably less than a third grade reading level. It seems that they deserve each other since no one else would put up with them even though they fight more than any other couple on the planet.

Right away it is easy to notice that this series is deathly afraid of silence. Every three minutes or so a new music track starts up in the background, there is always a melody underlying all conversation in a group or one on one. It would not be a stretch that an entire album of material might be sampled throughout one episode.

The series clearly makes a point to promote certain bands and venues by clearly labeling them in the background and making the cast go to see them and tell them how great they are. They hit up certain businesses for manicures, pedicures, massages, etc. and probably get great advertising out of it. Bet all their drinks and food are comped for the advertising at all these places.

If you like reality tv, soap operas, and/or ""glamorous"" Hollywood life, this combination is perfect for you. To young teenage girls, this probably seems really glamorous living the rich life with no jobs and all you have to do is throw big parties every episode where you can have big fights with your rival. The whole series is a bad example for the young ones but very popular as well.

DVD Extras:

The deleted scenes consist of Brody saying nice things about Jayde whom he talks bad about for the rest of the episodes and how his parents met at the Playboy mansion. Spencer talks more about his weird cowboy hat. There is more gossip, more cattiness, talking about travel plans, babies, and dogs. You're really not missing anything with these scenes. The after show remix of dumb statements and acting flaky is amusing at first, but the Heidi's party one is super annoying. The baby rap mixing up quotes to rhyme is funny. ""The B*tch is back"" is a special to promote Kristen's return to the show by talking to a couple people from ""Laguna Beach"" and eventually Kristen herself with interviewers and a studio audience. It feels like a reality show sum-up after the challenge is over except it's a preview.",1271376000,6,4707,4.607398568019093
4072130,5,B00363WGGO,"this is The best show ever  i've gone to LA and met spencer before
  him and his wife montang  are amazing , great actors too
  show is not just about drama but about how life in LA is
  clubs,beaches and alot of places they show you
  is like a tour guide with drama in it

  The fact That kristin C is now the main star in the show is great
  we all know that LC is boring and if she decided to leave is for the best.

  THE SHOW MUST GO ON
  AND looks like its better than ever
  Thank god she left..

  BUT WE DONT NEED SPENCER OR ANYONE ELSE TO LEAVE
 SO I HOPE THOSE ARE RUMORS .....

 I hope the hills never die and they keep making this show forever",1269475200,3,657,3.736842105263158
4072131,4,B00363WGGO,"I am a huge fan of The Hills. I've never hidden that fact even my boyfriend watches it with me and loves it. I have all the seasons and you could say I'm a little obsessed. I love Kristin Cav she's awesome and loves to start drama. But I have to say the second part was just OK. Don't get me wrong I loved all the fights and the drama and the bitchiness, but it just wasn't the same without Lauren there. Granted it did get a little boring on the first part with Lauren but I think it was because she was rarely on there. I think I was just so used to seeing Lauren on the show. It wasn't awful it could've been better. I'm excited to see what the 6th season has to bring what with Heidi's new face and all and the confrontation with her Mom. Keep up the good work MTV just make the 6th season better please!!!!",1266537600,8,811,3.98159509202454

4072133,3,B00363WGGO,"I will always be on team Lauren and this season or this part of season 5 was the first time it felt fake. Kristen is a horrible actress and everyone else seems to suck too...everything felt fake and not genuine at all....every then Audrina and Lo.
Glad they kept it going just to ruin it with crappy people who don't do anything but shop and eat and drink.",1431993600,,356,4.25

4072138,5,B00363WGGO,This show got me through high school and it will never get old! Kristen brought the drama of course which made it very entertaining!,1393200000,,132,4.541666666666667

4072141,2,B00363WGGO,"this is my rant.. ok first of all if my boyfriend told me to watch out for a girl, i would say goodbye at that minute. I don't believe in fighting over a guy. if a guy wants to be with someone else then fine go. 2nd, Justin should have been nixed in season 3. Everyone is fake in this season. no one acts like they care anymore. they aren't even trying to act. It should have stopped at season 5.1 because everyone (maybe) wanted to see heidi and spencer marry and should have ended at that. esp in season 6 when spencer threatens to beat up holly. getting kicked off the hills was the best thing mtv could have done. The guys act like girls. Jade is such white trash its not even funny to watch for just the entertainment. Kristin is just a pure joke on the show she doesn't work  (at least they don't show it) lauren put it good when she said kristins voice is like nails on chalk board. over it..",1387324800,,899,4.107954545454546

4072143,5,B00363WGGO,Well this is the last series with Lauren. But this series is still cool! Rich people! I wish. Everyone go out and get this dvd set.,1375833600,,131,4.076923076923077

4072145,5,B00363WGGO,"So glad to have all the drama at home! The DVD comes with a few special features that are fun to watch, it's too bad that the opening and closing credits are not included in the episodes. I also miss the ""next time on the hills"" bit, but that's not a deal breaker! The ""previously on the Hills"" is still at the beginning of each episode.",1370649600,2,337,4.121212121212121
4072146,5,B00363WGGO,I love this show and i am sad that it ended and want to watch it everyday of my life.,1354233600,,85,3.3
4072147,4,B00363WGGO,"I liked season 5, part 2 much better than part 1!  Bringing Kristen back was great, she always adds a fun/crazy dynamic to the show.  I was happy to see her return.  Would have loved this season even more if Speidi weren't on it.  Their parts were not only bizarre but boring, there was definitely enough drama and material without them.

The end was definitely a great add on, making fun of the fact that its not really ""reality"".  With all the press about the fakeness of the show, I thought it was genius of MTV to make that the ending to the series.  I was sad to see The Hills go off the air, it was a show I enjoyed watching.  With all the lame reality shows on now such as 16 and pregnant and rehab reality shows (come on is that really healthy for someones recovery?!) I wish they'd bring The Hills back!",1335830400,,812,4.193548387096774
4072148,4,B00363WGGO,"Lauren may have made a few mistakes along the road, but NOTHING compares to Kristin and her antics. Lauren was someone young girls and women could look up to, and the minute Kristin came back in she turned it into MTV beach house. Yes it was still a good show, but more than anything it made me miss Lauren and feel sorry for Kristin.",1301011200,2,334,4.234375

4072150,5,B00363WGGO,"Finally, I am up to date on my favourite show. I'm a little confused though as in part 2 there is no sign of Lauren. I will have to get season 4 out to refresh my memory. The appearance of Kristen really ruffles everyones feathers and I cant wait for season 6.",1282694400,,260,4.019230769230769
4072151,3,B00363WGGO,"I've loved The Hills since the very beginning, and what has helped make me love it is Lauren Conrad's life and her super-cool job in the fashion world.  She is absent in this series, and suddenly we have Kristin as her replacement.  She doesn't seem to do anything other than socialise and well...it gets a bit boring.  It would be more interesting if she wasn't so one-dimensional.  Certain scenes seem very convoluted and set-up too- she hooks up with Justin Bobby in Vegas but I'm not sure I really buy it or Justin claiming in one scene that 'nothing was ever as good as Audrina Patridge' and then in the next telling people that he and Audrina were 'never together'.  Heidi supposedly tries to trick Spencer into becoming a dad by going off the pill, but Spencer conveniently finds an empty pregnancy test in the trash.  Oh please!  And how funny that Lo #Lauren's best friend# is suddenly chummy with Lauren's foe Kristin, meeting her for coffees and confiding in each other.  Yes, Lo is now besties with her best friend's enemy!  Total BS.  That being said, if it is not thought too deeply about it is still entertaining froth with lots of drama and will keep you entertained on those nights when you're bored with nothing else to watch.",1276992000,2,1244,4.613636363636363
