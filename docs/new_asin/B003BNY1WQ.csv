4107179,5,B003BNY1WQ,This was a very well done movie on this particular event. After reading Sara's Key (a Novel). I was very interested about learning more about this specific round up. How heart wrenching.  This is a very intense holocaust movie.,1379203200,2,227,4.82051282051282

4107181,5,B003BNY1WQ,"La Rafle (The Roundup) gives us a glimpse of the atrocities committed during WW II. This particular movie focusses on Petain, the French police, and the crimes they perpetrated against the Parisian Jewish community. I have known about this
particular subject since I read Sarah's Key. I often wonder how people can so easily turn against neighbors, especially when the majority are children. This movie is heartbreaking; it reminds us that ignorance and power are a lethal combination but it also reinforces that fact that there are always good people in the midst of chaos. For anyone interested in WW II history this movie is a ""must see"".",1370908800,45,641,4.944444444444445
4107182,5,B003BNY1WQ,This movie was awesome. I loved the plot and characters. I had already had a little it of experience with the subject  but I still learned a lot.,1370044800,,145,4.178571428571429
4107183,4,B003BNY1WQ,"The subject matter is the same as ""Sarah's Key""--the Vel d'Hiv roundup of Jews in 1942.  The most shocking aspect is that the roundup was by the French police.  There is some original footage of Paris in WW2.  ""Sarah's Key"" has the hook of what happened to the little brother which perhaps make that version a little more accessible.  I was glad to have watched both movies.",1370044800,,374,4.537313432835821
4107184,5,B003BNY1WQ,"My parents were French Jews during this period - and fled shortly before this terrible incident when the French police and politicians cooperated with the Nazis to ""round up"" most of the Jews in Paris for eventual deportation to the death camps. So this important movie had special resonance for me.

An astounding film in many ways. What makes it so interesting is that it does present the French people in all their guises - those who protested the round ups, the doctors and nurses who tried to deal with the medical needs of people being crowded into the Paris Velodrome, the children who could not comprehend the cruelty around them, the suicides of Jews who knew what the end result was, the apathy of Marshall Petain who gradually bent to the Nazi demands, the antagonism of the anti-semites who were delighted by the elimination of Jews from Paris, a priest who wears the badge of the yellow Jewish star.

In the way the movie approached the events, I felt dark, deep, terrible horror.  And yet there are radiant moments of heroism displayed in the film.

More than one-third of the Jews who were supposed to be sent away by the French and Germans to death escaped with the help of other French men and women who protected them. This is the story of the children, mothers, and others who did not escape.  Harrowing, yes...but necessary.

Possibly the most compelling scene is the rampant, wild chaos in the Paris Velodrome as the troubled Jews try to figure out what is happening to them as they are being denied water to drink.  Just about all the events in this film are true. (Don't miss the extras and also watch ""Sarah's Key"", a fictional story about this seminal event in French 20th century history).",1326499200,,1715,4.658940397350993
4107185,4,B003BNY1WQ,"In July 1942 French police arrested and detained 13,000 Parisian Jews for the Nazis. 25 of them survived the war.

A very well made film about one of the many atrocities committed during WWII. Assuredly tells the stories of a number of actual detainees plus some composite characters (all well realized portrayals) without overburdening the audience by trying to tell too many stories. The film does a great job of showing the gradual deterioration of trust and hope in increasingly desperate lives.",1324684800,,499,5.085365853658536

4107200,5,B003BNY1WQ,"In this film, you will see the true story of the Vichy French collaborators and other Nazi sympathizers among the French, who were responsible for the meaningless deaths of tens of thousands of their own countrymen; men, women and children of the Jewish faith, all to appease their filthy Nazi ""handlers"". You will also see some of the French patriots and heroes who did what they could to stop the slaughter of innocents. It may be satisfying to know that many of the bloodthirsty gendarmes (French police) and other disgusting traitors in league with Nazi swine were either killed, sentenced to death, deported, imprisoned or given the status of Persona non Grata at the end of the war for treason and crimes against humanity. Over 6763 of these French war criminals were sentenced formally to death in court, while another several thousand were given swifter justice by enraged French citizens and killed by ""mob rule"". It is estimated that 9000-40,000 French Nazi collaborators, were killed between the last few years of the war and immediately following, during the wild vigilante purges and more legal purges via the court system.

4107208,1,B003BNY1WQ,"""La Rafle"" addresses the horrific story of how French collaborators held Jews and other persecuted people by the Nazi regime.  Most likely, the future of most of these victims ended in the concentration camps.

Unfortunately, I found it with too many diverse stories that were difficult to follow.

Sadly, I did not keep it in my collection and sold it.

As far as French films of the WW II period, my favorite still remains ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"".

It relates the history of members of the  French underground who did try to protect those persecuted by the Nazis.

4107219,5,B003BNY1WQ,"As a man well versed in WWII history in Europe I was aware of The Vel 'D'Hiv Roundup. That is to say I was aware that some Vichy French collaborated with Nazis.  This film however tells the story of this incident in chillingly personal and intimate detail. It paid honor to those Frenchmen who defied orders and properly vilified those who did not.

The character development was deep and made a strong connection with the viewer. I could ""feel"" the power.  The soul crushing agony of the father. The emptiness of the mothers.  The fear of the children. The human spirit of courage and defiance in others.  Even the gendarmes had a human face rather than being inhuman cogs in a machine. It gave the whole experience of this movie depth and power.

I've seen plenty of movies about the nightmare that was the persecution of Jews, and others, in WWII. This film is quite possibly among the best touching me in a way that truly haunted me and rivaled Naked Among Wolves and The Grey Zone for its heart wrenching power. It is a journey and as you watch it you essentially are downloading this knowledge into your heart. We owe it to history to know the story of such events. I promise you, this one will carry more into you than you may have expected.",1454544000,,1248,4.475770925110132

4107223,5,B003BNY1WQ,"""La Rafle"" tells the heart-rending, true story of the ""rafle du Vel d'Hiv""--the round up of the Jews in Paris on July 16, 1942.  It tells how the Vichy Government cooperated with the Nazis, rounded up the Jews and incarcerated them.  It show how the Vichy government used French soldiers to help the German army separate Jewish families and, then, ship them from internment in France to Auschwitz.  It reminds us that evil men are capable of perpetrating almost inconceivable atrocities,and that weak men and women help them.  However, it also shows us that despite the people who did nothing or even took part in the Nazi wickedness, human decency triumphed when everyday people acted bravely and did what they could to help. More than 13,000 Jews were rounded up, but 10,000 Jews weren't because their neighbors hid them and helped them escape capture.  Yet, the heartbreaking reality is that of the more than 4000 children loaded into the cattle cars headed for Auschwitz, none survived.  Despite the horrific story, there is an almost lyrical quality to this beautifully-made French film.  This movie is a must see!",1443225600,2,1119,4.951871657754011

4107226,2,B003BNY1WQ,"First-the positive points-it's well acted. And, it's well filmed and edited.-I give a thumbs up for taking a more subtle, less shocking, less vivid, less horrific approach to the nazi brutality and egregious crimes against humanity. That said,  the SAD TRUTH is, without the horrific scenes, the movie loses much of its credibility and value. It becomes a diluted storyline. IF the producers/director etc could have compromised a BIT..and shown a few shockingly truthful scenes, such as the children being murdered en masse, the movie would have been much improved. Many feel to do anything less is to show sympathy for Nazi ideology, and to make light of this mass extinction effort.. I agree..but temper the horror and show less scenes overall, but show  mORE than is revealed in this production.",1438473600,,798,5.083969465648855

4107251,5,B003BNY1WQ,"I find it very difficult to provide the right vocabulary to give adulation to this magnificent DVD Movie and the producer Rose Bosch.  I had relatives in the U.S. Army during World War II who served in France, mentioned the roundups during the Summer of 1942.  For the first time, as a former USAF Officer, completely I understand what took place during the  Summer of 1942.  Here is a film that portrays the true events of rounding up the Jews which left me completely transfixed in a constant state of futility, relief and astonishment.  How, could people do this?  How could people round up 4,051 Jewish children, put them on trains which had only the destination for their final extinction.  This included 13,000 men and women who were deported to Nazi German Concentration camps; only 25 survived.  13,000 Jews were rounded up in Paris to be held for several days in the Velodrome d'Hiver stadium with little food or water; then transferred to internment camps outside of Paris, and finally to Auschwitz - where they disappeared - only 25 returned.  Jean Reno's performance as the Jewish Doctor is completely flawless and engrossing.  Melanie Laurent's role as a Nurse who made several futile attempts to save Jewish children was superlative and outstanding. In the cast, there is a young boy ca. 12 or 13 years old by the name of Hugo Leverdez who played the role of ""Jo"" or Joseph Weisman that was career-defining ,
emotionally astute and undeniably powerful. Hugo is a genius by his  truthful representation for the annihilation of the lives of 4,051 Jewish children while a few escaped the trains.  The French were aware the Vichy and the Germans aimed to round up 24,000
Jews.  Nevertheless Parisians - which included Protestant Ministers and Catholic Priests - hid 10,000 Jewish men, women and children.  There the additional  altruistic historic feature will be revealed that resulted in making this film so powerful about the
bad and the good.  There were French citizens who refused to succumb to the roundups and an epic true story in a DVD film to honor them has been long overdue.  Upon conclusion of viewing this film, I have an entirely different and positive regard for the
French and France during World War II.  Finally, it is essential that we Christians, the Jews and others in the West, must be
united in upholding the Natural Law, especially the Nuremberg Code of 1947 which are inherent messages in this film.  The producer Rose Bosch and others have put this film which is one of a kind, and of value sine qua none in a DVD collection.",1411689600,22,2563,4.784090909090909

I cried and cheered more from this movie than any I've seen recently. I also really like how it showed both the bad and the good in the French population during this trying time period. I've heard that war brings out the best and worst in people, and this movie just illustrates that to emotional relief. If you're looking for a WWII movie that will move and inspire you, definitely watch this one. It's one of the best out there.",1400976000,3,572,4.617647058823529

4107266,5,B003BNY1WQ,"""La Rafle"" is a great look at a time in history when good people did nothing to stop the killing of innocent people. This is a look at ""The Round-up"" of thousands of Jews in Paris during WW II, through the eyes of a nurse who wasn't Jewish, but who knew what was happening was wrong. ""La Rafle"" doesn't white wash every thing the way so many films do. The movie puts it out there just the way it really was. This is a very emotional film, and violent as well. This is an intimate look into people's lives that makes a person feel like they really know them and almost feel their pain. If you don't feel any thing watching this movie, there is no hope! Yes, it is in French, but it is an easy movie to keep up with, and the English subtitles are great. I highly recommend this one!",1394668800,7,780,4.104575163398692

The Jews must have been terrified and tortured by what was happening to them and for third parties to still resent and dislike them is incredible.  So why are so many Europeans snatching up real estate in New York City now as if none of this happened?

I'd already read Sarah's Key so I knew the families including babies were tortured by the conditions and prolonged stay at the Velodrome but this film effectively communicates the sense of anxiety and sorrow and objectionableness of the situation borne in public silence.  The film is actually very pretty and enhanced by established French actors like Sylvia Testud and The Valet as well as Shoshanna herself from Inglorious Basterds and very entertaining Room of Death.  I almost expected OSS 117 and Amelie to make an appearance.  Everyone looks very much of the era and in character.",1388966400,,949,4.791411042944786
4107274,5,B003BNY1WQ,"In July of 1942, the Nazis invaded Paris, France and began the `roundup' of over 13,000 French Jews.  Based with great detail on the true event, this film begins with original footage of Hitler and his troops in black and white and seamlessly brings it into a color focus that makes for a truly realistic event.  Director/writer Rose Bosch splices individual stories, terrorism and acts of bravery with heartbreaking clarity.  Several families and their non-Jewish neighbors are depicted during this period as both trying to save and hide those who are mercilessly hunted.  Children are shown in excruciating circumstances, being separated from their parents, hidden by others and ultimately being ousted from their homes.  The unsympathetic anti-Jewish neighbors of Paris are also depicted with their unbelievable cruelty and hate.

Starring great actors Jean Reno as a doctor and Melanie Laurent as a nurse, each character is confronted endlessly with choices of saving lives and postponing deaths.  Much of the film takes place in a large stadium (Velodrome d'Hiver) where entire families live on sparse rations with disease and atrocious discomfort.  Reno and Laurent are subtly magnificent in their characters and the tension and story-telling are stunning.  Knowing that all the stadiums victims are going to be rounded up again to be shipped off to Auschwitz, these two characters have to make horrific and dangerous decisions.

In 1995, this atrocity was first fully revealed to the world and this film depicts the spirit and humanity of the Parisian Jews against the methodical cruelty of the Nazis.  The ending is both heartfelt, hopeful and tragic with a well-balanced finale that finally reveals to the world (in cinematic terms) this amazingly shameful event.

4107275,4,B003BNY1WQ,"La Rafle tells the heart-wrenching story of the Velo d'hiver, the French (pro Nazi) round up Parisian Jews.  The movie follows a few key characters including a gentile nurse and a Jewish boy imprisoned.  It's not quite as emotionally draining as Boy in the Striped Pajamas but it's very, very close. It keeps your emotions stretched thin from a few minutes in until the last scene.

Who would enjoy this film?  Viewers who enjoy period dramas, human World War II films, and foreign films.

4107279,4,B003BNY1WQ,"""La Rafle"" (""The roundup""; 2010 release from France; 124 min.) brings the real life story of how the French government agreed in the summer of 1942 to round up and deliver thousands of Jews living in Paris to the Nazis. While the opening credits roll, we see archive footage of Hitler visiting/inspecting Paris, including the iconic Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. We then get to know several young Jewish boys, and their respective families, all required to wear ""the yellow star"" on their clothes. Things get progressively worse as the summer progresses, and on July 16, 1942, the French police and government strikes out in a massive way and the roundup begins. Entire families, including women and children, are brought to the ""Velodrome d'Hiver"", a large sports arena. At this point we are a good 40 min. into the movie and to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience.

Couple of comments: before the opening credits of the movie, we are reminded that ""all these events, however extreme, did occur"", and any viewer should take this reminder seriously, as this movie is, plain and simple, not for the faint of heart. The brutality of the roundup, the ugliness of the conditions in which thousands are kept in the Velodrome, and what happens to most of them afterwards, make this for difficult and at times uncomfortable viewing. But it is an important movie to watch, due to its historical importance. Yes, there are several heroes among the French, trying to save and protect Jewish families as best they can, but overall this movie documents a shameful episode in France's WW II history, and one that should never be forgotten. If the events sound somewhat familiar to you, it may be that you saw another movie from that year called ""Sarah's Key"" (starring Kristin Scott Thomas), which looks back to these very same events, albeit from a different and less brutal way. Director Roselyne Bosch is to be commended for bringing ""La Raffle"" to life in the way that she did. There is no sugarcoating whatsoever.

I saw this movie for the first time at the Cincinnati Israeli & Jewish Movie Festival in early 2012, now almost 2 years ago. Recently I watched this again, and I was struck how powerful this movie remains upon a second viewing. I have no idea why it has taken so long for this movie to get an official DVD/Blu-ray release in the US, but better late than never. No, this is not the kind of movie that you will walk away from thinking ""that was a jolly good time!"", but ""La Rafle"" is nevertheless a must-see for anyone interested in the history of WW II. ""La Rafle"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1387238400,2,2610,4.708971553610503
4107280,5,B003BNY1WQ,"This movie is an excellent portrayal of the attempt to eradicate Jews from France in 1942. Most of the world is quite aware of how the Nazis intended to eliminate Jews anywhere they found them in countries they conquered during WWII in Europe. Nor do many people realize that many French collaborated with the Nazis. Although the number of Jews in France who were arrested,sent to concentration  camps and murdered were around 13,000 as compared to the 6,000,000 exterminated throughout Europe;it was all part of the Nazi program if ""cleansing"" Europe of all Jews. It was not until 1995 that the world at large really heard much about the Holocaust in France ,and not till that time did Jaques Chirac issue a public apology on the part of France.
 This movie tells what happened ,but only scratches at the surface as to the diabolical cruelty these Jews were subjected to,even though they were guilty of nothing more than being Jewish. When I say only scratching the surface,the movie does not show actual shootings,extreme beatings,people dying in gas chambers,and bodies burned and thrown into mass graves,some still alive. The movie only states that these things took place. This film was the winner of over 15 audience awards at US Film Festivals. The movie was produced in France and is in French,German,and Yiddish with English subtitles. I can't say that I am familiar with any of the actors,but to me, that only made the whole movie more engrossing,real and powerful;because those are the languages in which these outrages to humanity took place. As another Reviewer mentioned,I found the subtitles a little distracting as I often had to choose between watching the film and reading the subtitles. Also,much of the spoken words was not in the subtitles,hence I missed a lot of what was said.",1387065600,,1799,4.953642384105961
4107281,5,B003BNY1WQ,"July 16, 1942 . . . . . 13,152 Jewish residents of Paris, many of them children, are rounded up and transported to the Vlodrome d'Hiver, an indoor bicycle track and stadium not far from the Eiffel Tower, where they were held for five days with no food, no water, little medical care - not even any lavatories. (Of the 10 in the stadium, 5 had been sealed to prevent escapes and the remainder did not function.) The roof of the stadium had been painted dark blue to conceal the structure from bombers, the windows bolted shut for security. All of them* were eventually transported to Auschwitz.  Almost none of them returned.

In the aftermath of the war, the Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv mostly disappeared from the public discourse until 1995, when French President Jacques Chirac apologized for the role that the French played in the roundup. The Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv was different than Nazi roundups and exterminations elsewhere because it was not carried out by Germans, but by the French Police.

Grandma's $0.02 - The Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv with its widespread roundup of children and the elderly put paid to Nazi propaganda that Jews were being transported to work camps in the East, as well as the idea that only the Germans were complicit in the Holocaust.

8393825,4,B003BNY1WQ,"... didn't change my life, but it did cause me to wonder how so many could allow so few to cause such pain.  Was it because those ordinary citizens that lived in German occupied France had no weapons to counter La Rafle?  Was it because some demagogue somewhere had decided some ethnic/religious/different group of people needed to be a target for nationalism and any disagreement brought the label of traitor?  Was it because some had different shaped eyes and may be an 'internal threat' as was the case in America about the same time when tens of thousands watched neighbors being carted away to 'places of safety' and did nothing except take the belongings from the house after the arrest?  What is in us that stands by and causes us to become accomplices to rampant unchallenged injustices? Fear of the authorities? Fear of being accused of complicity by the mean-spirited? It's bad enough when it is happening to someone else, but how could any man stand still for such treatment of his own family and be able to live with himself?  How can we stand silently and watch as other humans are stripped first of their possessions, then their freedom, then their loved ones and finally carted away, some to certain death?  then look ourselves in the mirror to admire what fine specimens of humanity we are, well-fed and about to slip into a clean, warm bed.
The Vichy round up was not the first nor will it be the last round up.  One may come to a neighborhood near you.  But when it does, hope it is not you nor yours.  Those neighbors you think are as close as family that you trade weekends grilling by the pool..?  they'll likely gather the children and turn to go inside as you and your children are taken away.",1522108800,,1716,4.5602605863192185
