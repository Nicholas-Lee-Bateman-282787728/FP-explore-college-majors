8606630,5,B00ELE8GPW,"Excellent series! Wonderful overview of Wales, charming guide/narrator, and numerous delightful animals shown. Only downside is now I really want to go there! I enjoyed 'Wild Wales' (the first 3 episodes) a bit more than 'Rugged Wales', as the latter series focused more on landscape and geology rather than wildlife. Slate quarries are not that fascinating, but even so there was still breath-taking views of rivers, lakes, waterfalls, caves and craggy cliffs.

Also a possible plus (for viewers with sensitivities) there are no depictions of predation beyond catching fish or insects.

I highly recommend this DVD set for anyone with an interest in wildlife, and wanting a gentle 'country-stroll' feel for a nature documentary.",1463529600,,729,5.385964912280702
