4327549,5,B004CJQVQ2,"This film brings to your screen great ironic comedy with a light intellectual twist. The cast is a showcase of many modern comedians before the were ""COOL"" and it shows their roots quite well. Sam Seder not only created this fine film but portrays the character Max in a way only he can. Unlike many other movies of it's ilk I was not able to guess the ending half way thru the movie, which IMHO is a great boon to enjoyment. You will not be disappointed if you like any of the actors involved.",1301616000,2,494,4.26595744680851
4327550,5,B004CJQVQ2,"Who's the Caboose is a rare look back at a cast of truly gifted comedians early in their careers.  The characters and comedy stand the test of time.

David Earl Waterman (Wotterman in the film) is a genius.",1301356800,14,206,4.394736842105263
8423084,5,B004CJQVQ2,"I liked the plot. The camera work could have been more clearer. I prefer really sharp realistic film shooting without any blur or hazy effects at any time during a movie. I remember some directors think that it gives the romantic dream world shot definition, but it just seems like it is not like a spectator is looking into a life action world. There are lots of black and white movies from the 1930s that have really crisp photography that is really enjoyable. The drawback to today's directors is that perhaps there saying the movies because of today's actors not being great aren't worth crisp clear photography.",1506988800,,616,4.766355140186916
8423085,5,B004CJQVQ2,"There are so many great people in this movie. I had heard Sam Seder mention this one many times on his podcast and finally got around to watching and it did not disappoint - Sam Seder, Sarah Silverman, Todd Barry, Kathy Griffiin, Andy Dick, Marc Maron and many many more. Watch it!",1440115200,,281,4.423076923076923

8423087,4,B004CJQVQ2,"This movie isn't bad, but unless you're a comedy nerd, you'll probably be disappointed. It was great to see all the comics involved, and the plot was kinda cool, but there just weren't a lot of laughs. I rented it, and it was worth the $4, but I don't think I need to add it to the collection.",1377561600,,293,4.068965517241379
8423088,1,B004CJQVQ2,I just wasted over an hour of my life.  I want it back. I wish I fell asleep during this movie instead of waiting for it to get funny.,1333843200,,134,3.6206896551724137
8423089,5,B004CJQVQ2,"I found it very enjoyable. It had the feel of a ""Best in Show"", a reality spoof with a bunch of comedians, crazy agents and Hollywood types, some sort of quirky Jewish cliques, people getting drunk. A lot of funny moments, the aggressive agent who shakes Sam's hand while he is trying to take a piss, the woman who is in tears because of Sara Silverman's arm hair. I would have liked to see more pot references throughout. I would have made it more realistic. The aggressive agent should have been snorting coke, but why split hairs, it is worth the watch, and streaming for free on Netflix right now!",1302220800,2,601,4.472727272727273
8423090,5,B004CJQVQ2,Really a who's who of comedy now by being a who's who of indy comedy then. Pacing is good. David Cross steals scenes like he always does. Really funny timeless comedy.,1301788800,2,167,4.419354838709677
8423091,5,B004CJQVQ2,"Very funny and this underrated movie is filled with comedic heavy hitters. I love this movie so much, I actually bought the DVD, which I never do, because it's one of the few movies I watch over and over.",1301702400,4,204,4.256410256410256
8423092,2,B004CJQVQ2,"A comparatively weak entry in the mockumentary category, 'Who's the Caboose?' tries to carry the baton passed by Christopher Guest and company with a behind-the-scenes skewering of the stand-up-comic/sitcom world for the 'Whatever' generation. The project's glib humor and sense of dispassionate self-satisfaction (evident in scenes both written and ad libbed) date it unmistakably to the mid-late '90s, the Seinfeld era, when passive-absurdist observational comedy was king, which wouldn't necessarily be a problem if it could come up with wittier gags or more interesting characters (most of the cast, while likeable enough, lack the chops to manage the heavy workload of improvisation demanded of them). Instead the whole affair just feels like a patchwork of familiar, semi-amusing notions, its storyline adrift beyond the concept stage, its lack of focus on a satiric target increasingly obvious as the cardboard plot limps along (is it really a sendup of the Tinseltown dream, or an attempt to revisit 'Swingers' documentary-style?). Though it features comedians it isn't about stand-up; though it stars Sarah Silverman it isn't really about her either, or about L.A., vapid Hollywood players or the pursuit of fleeting success in a town without pity. It wants to be about all these things-- an ambitious order-- and falls short in most respects.  2 stars.",1301616000,,1362,5.4245283018867925
8423093,5,B004CJQVQ2,this is one of the funniest movies i've seen.  i'm thrilled it's finally on dvd!  i couldn't recommend this more.,1301616000,3,113,4.6
