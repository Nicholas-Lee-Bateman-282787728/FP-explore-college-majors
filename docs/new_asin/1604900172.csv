7800264,4,1604900172,Great DVD and makes you feel like your there with them.  If you every wondered about fly fishing or going to Montana to fish this video is great to see what it is like.  The thing is when you go to Montana you will catch bigger fish then shown in video. Would highly recommend this to anyone wanting information on learning or just wanting to see great fly fish with some super experts fly fishing.  The laughing in the video can become overwhelming but it shows how fun the sport is and what your attitude should be when on the river. It makes you want to pack up and go fishing just what a great movie should do.  It takes you out of your living room into the river with the fish.,1296172800,,682,4.143939393939394
