8429121,3,B004GYS2R4,"This is a decent movie, but as i stated i was hoping for a bit more than what we get.

 The film is subtitled, which doesn't bother me too much but they sorta stop subtitling in a major plot point.  It hurts the movie a bit when the Doctor is describing his plans for revenge and you don't know what they are saying for nearly 3 minutes.  I was also looking forward to more gore or terror - or really more atmosphere to send chills up my spine, but the movie fell a bit short and ended up being a mild Thriller.

 I hate to say, but i would kinda prefer this had english dubbing.  It lacks some oomph and reading subtitles doesn't help.  Normally i prefer original dialogue with subtitles, but this could be a cheesy rainy day flick if i didn't have to read it.

 I still love Intervideo and hope they keep the obscure fun movies coming to us, even though this one is not one of their strongest titles.",1371340800,2,902,4.161849710982659
8429122,4,B004GYS2R4,"FULL REVIEW FROM FILMPHREAK.TUMBLR.COM
This 73 installment in Jess Francos Orloff series is full of the dreaminess and depravity one automatically expects from any movie with Francos name attached, though its depravity is not so much in the wallow-in-nudity kind of way that many Franco flesh fests are, but rather in the villainy of the characters involved. Theres a little lust, sexually, but more of the characters lust is centered around money, not getting it on. Specifically, theres an inheritance at stake and everybody from Dr. Orloff to the family members of the films crippled heroine is out to get it. And all the plotting revolves around the young bed/wheelchair-bound woman. The thing is, her status as both crippled woman and heroine come into question when murders and nightmares begin to dovetail. (Now thats the sort of thing we expect from a Franco film.) There are some neat mysteries here as Dr. Orloff employs his mesmerism to hypnotically plunge into the center of the young womans disturbed mind. And what about said disturbance? Is she crazy or not? What - or who - is making her crazy? No one seems innocent in this film. And, worst of all, whats all this head-tinkering through Orloffian mind control going to stir up inside the poor girls noggin? And how does the present violence tie in with the past? Yep, its kind of a mystery story with a touch of the fantastic thrown in and, as with maybe the bulk of Francos films, the movie walks a fine line between linearity and surreal experientiality. Theyre perfectly balanced. THE SINISTER EYES OF DR. ORLOFF is not Francos crowning achievement by any means. But it is one of his good movies, at least, if not one of his great ones. And if youve seen one of his bad flicks, you can be thankful this Orloff entry is one of Francos good films.",1362268800,2,1815,4.728706624605678
8429123,4,B004GYS2R4,"Here we have a Jess Franco film made in a transitional period where it was made in the company of such titles as 'THE PERVERSE COUNTESS', two Maciste muscleman hommages to the Italian peplums and one of his masterpieces 'FEMALE VAMPIRE' or if you prefer 'THE BARE-BREASTED COUNTESS'. This Dr. Orloff film has nothing to do with Franco's first masterpiece 'GRITOS EN LA NOCHE' aka 'THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF'.  This incarnation is a vengeful psychotic played by Euro actor William Berger who wants to destroy the family in which his rival married into to gain the  inheritance away from the heirs and exert his murders through his hypnotic influence on the daughter Melissa. The film resembles one of those 1940's PRC/MONOGRAM pot boilers as a straight forward thriller with horror elements that Bela Lugosi would have been right at home in.  It is not as perverse as his token eroticisms but it has many great Franco touches with erratic camerawork and sylistic set pieces.  The murders are handled excellently especially the point of view bath tub sequence and the murder of the family butler on a fog shrouded road .  Mona Proust who also was great in 'SINNER-DIARY OF A NYMPHOMANIAC' is brilliant as Orloff's walking automaton staggering through the house knife in hand looking for victims, some of these scenes are absolutely chilling and worth the price tag of the film alone. Hollywood actor Edmund Purdom is along as the police inspector but seems to be in the same trance as our heroine. Franco himself appears in an early flashback as Melissa's father and in typical fashion, staggers after our heroine and proceeds to drip blood onto her nightgown.  You'll find out why as the movie progresses.  Intervision gives it a full screen transfer which fluctuates but is better than the below par dupes which were on videotape.  It is a Spanish print with English subtitles in some scenes they disappear for minutes on end and then emerge once again.  It has a great interview with the master as he explains the origins of the Orloff character and the troubles he had with trying to get this vision on screen.  For those who have never seen a Franco film, this one and 'THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF' is a good place to start.  Its a great straight forward thriller and a must for Jess Franco fans which shows the director in a different light.",1301356800,2,2333,4.75
8429124,4,B004GYS2R4,"I have to admit, this release from Intervision Picture Corp is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it's an unreleased gem in the prolific output from the elder statesman of Eurosleaze, another addition to the Orloff series (though one entry has nothing to do with any other, but in the Franco interview included on this disc we get to find out the where and why he began using the Orloff name, along with some other interesting trivia, assuming you can understand Jess at all due to his heavy accent and the fact that he's lost all but one of his teeth, apparantly - the interview should be subtitled), and probably one of the most linear and coherent storylines I've ever come across in the vast pantheon of Franco's work. As a film, it's complete and distinctly Franco at his finest, story-wise. Shocking as it seems, it appears he was actually working with a script, albeit a short one, but I'm complementing and not complaining. For this reason I'm giving it 4 stars, though it's probably only deserving 3.

On the other hand, the print suffers from many distortions; the most difficult to bear being the wretchedly cropped full screen (?) aspect ratio, which still appears squashed to fit a widescreen TV. The film only takes up half your screen as if the left and right sides are lopped off yet the top to bottom legnth appears distorted and compressed. It's highly annoying to watch at first, but I was able to overcome this hurdle after a while, yet some cinephiles will go berserk over this annoyance. The film was commissioned only for Spanish audiences as it was financed by a Bastille business firm (another fun fact from the interview), so it seems that the English subtitles are new - no problem with that, except that there's a significant scene and a half smack dead in the middle of the flick that has no subs at all, and noteworthy plot details are lost and no where to be found. This was criminal to me seeing as my Spanish sucks. Huge bummer. As far as the print used, it's not a great one and wasn't restored at all, so there's little depth or contrast, the colors are washed out in places (e.g. the blacks become dark browns sporadically), and it has that 70's grainy grindhouse overall look to it, minus the scratches, scars and hiccups inherent in most grindhouse films.

The story's a simple soap opera concerning a wheelchair-bound young woman named Melissa (Montserrat Prous from 'Sinner: Diary of a Nymphomaniac', though here billed as Mona, and again we learn more about her work w/ Jess and various names in the interview included) whose suffering from a Freudian checklist of psychological abnormalities and is rendered housebound by her family who all have secrets and display anomalous behavior as well. So Doctor Orloff (William Berger) is called in to examine the girl in hopes of getting her institutionalized so her aunt and step-sister can control the estate and finances she inherited when her father was mysteriously murdered in the house ten years earlier, and whose killer was never brought to light. The good doctor was friends with her father (played briefly by Jess himself) and they both loved the same woman, Melissa's mother, so you can see where this one's heading. To say more would be giving it all up and ruin your potential enjoyment herein. Suffice to say that Orloff has plans to control the girl himself and exact retribution from the family he believes wronged him ages ago. A hastily forced and half-realized ending (not uncommon in films from that period) only make this all the more frustrating when coupled with the film's defects mentioned earlier.

This movie has more in common with a Italian giallo than a traditional Franco flick as far as tone, approach and melodrama is concerned; again, not a bad thing as I love gialli, but here's another petty grievance from this Francophile - there's a conspicuous absence of nudity or sleaze for a Franco flick due to the extreme censorship in Spain while under dictatorship of the other Franco known around the world. Usually, Jess's films were made to include additional scenes of abundant nudity and fetishistic sleaze for export to other European countries; but as this one was made solely for a Spanish audience and its overzealous censors at that time, it's extremely barren of the excesses we've come to love and expect from Jess Franco. There's only one pair of exposed breasts in the entire movie! Come on, man, what's a Franco flick without the elevated sleaze quotient??? It's a celluloid day without the sordid sunshine, that's what. Another bummer.

In summary, this one's worth watching despite its multiple drawbacks, especially now that you've been prepared for the shortcomings, you can adjust your expectations and enjoy what's remaining as this is a decent film in Jess's catalog, and almost proves he could produce a coherent film now and again despite his detractor's claims otherwise. It's always cool to see a film of his that wasn't available before, even if we suspect it will suck - such is the perverse power of the enigma that is Jess Franco. If you're in the mood for a gratifying, recently released Franco film with the many gratuitous excesses we all love in his work, try 'Sinner' or 'Lorna the Exorcist' from Mondo Macabro - they're highly regarded in our Franco community and guaranteed not to disappoint. But don't let your 'sinister eyes' ignore this one entirely either. Sooner or later, it's time to see the Doctor...",1298678400,10,5468,4.807651434643995
