8448584,1,B004YMAUXW,"Watched this via Amazon.com video and the picture quality is super poor! (It's not amazon's fault - it's a bad video, like it was made from someones home video footage)

Basically this is just normal stuff you would see watching a rodeo, not ""bloopers"" and there is an old guy making what he thinks is funny commentary on it as you watch.

Do yourself a favor and PASS on this.",1345507200,,377,4.371428571428571
8448585,2,B004YMAUXW,"I ordered this video for my son overseas.  He received it and I heard back from him today. I missed the ""manufactured on demand not when I ordered the 1st time.

This is what he said
"" I have to tell you this and don't take it the wrong way it was extremely funny.  One of the videos you sent me was titled ""Hilarious Rodeo Bloopers"" now I already told you that I like these types of videos so I was pretty excited to watch it.  The rodeo bloopers are probably the most extreme especially the bull riding.  I got all settled into my rack threw in the video and was completely dumbfounded.  There was on old man narrating the video and it was old 1970 footage of just guys falling off horses and an occasional bull.  He would make comments like ""watch this wild ride"" and a guy would fall off a horse; then not even at the right time he would put in a sound effect BOING.  Im not kidding I laughed so hard, I had a vision of my dad pulling out all of his old rodeo videos and editing them together and having a couple of items next to him so he could make the ridiculous sound effects then putting it on Amazon for sale. The funny thing is I leave the video in the office and every morning someone will come in put the video back where they found it and ask ""who's video is this"" I just laugh and shrug my shoulders.  Now don't get the wrong impression I love the movies you send and thoroughly enjoy watching them so I don't want to come across like I am complaining, I got plenty of laughs from the video just not for the reasons you'd think"".

There you have it.",1308355200,,1564,4.098360655737705
