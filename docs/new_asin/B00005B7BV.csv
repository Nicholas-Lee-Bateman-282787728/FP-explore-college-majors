7937010,2,B00005B7BV,"I couldn't quite give this a three star rating.  It was a rather slow and dull pilot for a short lived TV show starring Brenda Vacaro in the title role of ""Sara"".  Sara is a Eastern schoolteacher who travels west to a small town to teach.  She has some problems with life in the west but is determined to bring progress to the territories.  Geared towards women it is a standard family format.",1417737600,,393,4.342465753424658

7937012,1,B00005B7BV,"The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version.
A two hour TV movie that was the pilot of the CBS show ""Sara"" from 1976. (Does anyone remember the Geena Davis sitcom from the 80's on NBC with the same name?) Brenda Vaccarro stars as Sara a teacher from Philadelphia who comes out west to Independence, Colorado apparently to tame it. While Ms. Vaccarro is capable in the role, little else is memorable. Maybe this one line from the show where a man just gets into town and says ""I can't remember ever being more bored or more uncomfortable."" OK, it's not that bad, but there was a reason the show lasted 13 episodes (a short run for a network show in the 70's). Think ""Harper Valley P.T.A""/""Little House On The Prairie""/""Maude"" and you have Sara.
The transfer is one of the worse I've seen from Brentwood/BCI. Taken from a tape and not film, the picture is grainy and of poor quality. The sound is worse! This movie was recorded over something else. How do I know? At times, there's another soundtrack trying to get through. I wonder what it was, because this show wasn't worth recording. Don't get me wrong, I think every show should be saved, I just wish I was watching something else.
This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called ""The Wild West"" and is available from Amazon.com.",1079308800,2,1403,4.5058823529411764
7937013,2,B00005B7BV,"This ""movie"" is in actuality an episode of the TV series ""Sara"".
It is one of my favorite series of all time. It concerns an idealistic schoolteacher who wants to tame the Wild West.  The production value of this DVD, does not due justice to the show.  After watching the DVD, one gets the feeling this movie was transfered straight from VHS to DVD, and they used a tired VHS at that.  Throughout a majority of the DVD, I could hear another program, as if the DVD had ""taped"" over another program leaving some sound residue.  This distracted me greatly from fully enjoying the film.  However for diehard ""Sara"" fans, this will be about the only way they will see there show.  The price of the DVD is ""reasonably priced"".  You get what you pay for.",1043798400,5,747,4.448529411764706
