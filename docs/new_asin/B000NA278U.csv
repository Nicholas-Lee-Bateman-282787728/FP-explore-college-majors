8176083,3,B000NA278U,"Movie aside, the DVD hardly has any special features. The picture quality isn't very good too. It's unfortunate that I'm not aware of any other copy of the DVD because this is a fun film. I'm reasonably satisfied with the seller TLAvideo though.",1324339200,2,245,4.72093023255814
8176084,5,B000NA278U,"Based on the blurbs on the DVD cover and reviews I've read here and elsewhere, I was expecting a gonzo film with all sorts of craziness going on. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised that underneath all of the punk rock makeup and supposed debauchery was a sweet coming of age story. And while this seems to be a small independent film, the production qualities are high.

The actress who played Sara (Veronica Sanchez) is great. And beautiful. Also, we get to see more of her (if you know what I mean) than we do of Leo, who supposedly lets certain body parts run free (they do, but in only one scene). Also great is the actress who played Antonia, Nuria Gonzalez.

It seems like this film was marketed to the gay community, but its appeal is universal. Every kid has to make decisions as to whether or not to obey Mommy & Daddy or to go out and fend for themselves in the world. If that world happens to be in a music group in a punk rock club on the eve of a possible coup, while not being too sure about the sexual orientation of yourself or your friends, then it just makes everything a lot more interesting!!

I was unfamiliar with the attempted coup in Spain on Feb 23, 1981 (stock footage of which is shown in the movie), but coming after only 5 years of new found Democracy, it left Spain on an uncertain brink. This gave the movie more weight than most light-hearted coming of age movies, which are usually based on what to do after Prom and/or Graduation. This movie is based on what to do after the government and your way of life may be completely destroyed!?!? But don't let the politics scare you away from this film as the coup is simply another character in this tale.

The music is fun. Nothing great, but it has a good early 80's New Wave vibe. In the film they say it's a combination of Blondie and Nina Hagen. I'd add in the B-52's as there's a fun and campiness to each tune.

There is nudity and drug use, but nothing gratuitous. This is a soft 'R' film. I don't want folks to confuse my ""sweet"" comment to mean innocent!?!? Innocent it ain't. I feel that it's suitable for 16 year High School students & above.

As for the disk itself - there are not much extras on the disk, only the trailer and about 10 stills in a photo gallery. I watched this in Spanish with English subtitles. I don't know what other subtitles are available.

I had more fun watching this than many big Hollywood productions.",1265673600,5,2421,4.342920353982301
