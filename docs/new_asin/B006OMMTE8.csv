5010845,2,B006OMMTE8,"My 3 year-old suddenly became ballet obsessed, so I purchased this.  Between the British accent (which should sound lovely) and all the whining she does, I can't stand this DVD.  Thankfully it's not one of my daughter's favorites either.  Why can't she be a nice mouse?  Whine!  Whine!  Whine!  Waaaaaangelina!",1311033600,3,310,5.08
5010846,5,B006OMMTE8,"My daughter loves Angelina Ballerina, she watches it non-stop on Netflix.  I was pleased that this DVD expands on the Angelina universe.  Two thumbs up!!",1307404800,,153,5.08
5010847,5,B006OMMTE8,"I love Angelina Ballerina.  She is so cute and adorable and she always does the right thing, even it if takes awhile.  This DVD is full of five episodes all revolving around Angelina and her ballet dancing!  The DVD starts out with Angelina's family moving across town, which means new friends, a new school, and a new dance teacher.  Angelina lies to the school because she is nervous about the change, but in the end realizes it is going to be great.  I think this episode is great because I know how scary moving can be for kids and this shows how it can be a fun new adventure.  The other episodes are just as good and focus on Angelina and her little sister, her new dance teacher and school, and are all full of dancing and singing!",1298678400,4,738,4.311594202898551

8502103,5,B006OMMTE8,"This was a gift for a 5 year old ballet student with a very serious illness.  She will not be in class for a while, hopefully we will see her again before too long.  The studio put together a basket of ballet related goodies.  Her mom said the purple tutu and this DVD were her favorite things.  What better recommendation is there?!",1426377600,,333,4.32258064516129
