8397865,4,B003J7HO8M,"Both programs were produced by Arizona public tv, so they give the perspective more of the science team at Tucson AZ, and the Lockheed Martin construction team in CO, as opposed to centering on Cape Canaveral FL and JPL CA operations that we are used to seeing.  The 1st program deals with planning, construction and launch.  The 2nd reviews some of this, but then concentrates on the landing through to mission termination and initial results.  The pace is much more rapid in the second program, and you have to be paying attention to each bit of information.  These programs really are the work in progress more than a summary of the mission.  That would need another show which would probably leave out some of what we see here.  The 1st program is generally available on DVD, but the 2nd is more limited in distribution.",1367193600,2,824,4.6875
8397866,1,B003J7HO8M,"The Phoenix mission to mars made some very exciting discoveries, not the least of which was the fact that when it landed its rocket engines blew away the thin soil cover to reveal water ice underneath the spacecraft.  It took pictures of the bleak but evocative landscape and found all the chemicals needed for life.
So what's wrong with this DVD????
It shows NONE of this!
The whole DVD is about how they built the Phoenix and how they shipped it to the Cape for takeoff.  The damn thing ends with Phoenix on its way to Mars and shows nothing of its actual mission on the Red Planet.  What a waste of my time and money.",1329177600,2,620,4.327586206896552
8397867,3,B003J7HO8M,"This is a goofy movie/mocumentary about an unmanned spacecraft (The Phoenix) that lands on the surface of Mars to take pictures and to bake things. The spacecraft is equipped with several state-of-the-art ovens which have been designed to bake things from ingredients that are dug up and extracted from the Martian soil.  As luck would have it, the following ingredients are discovered in the Martian soil; water, salt, calcium (milk) carbonate (soda pop), sulfer (eggs), fluoride (toothpaste), and wheat.  These are the basic ingredients needed to bake bread.  But I missed part of the movie when I went out to water the plants.  So I think I missed the part where the ovens baked the bread.

Although the storyline is far-fetched and not believable, the acting is excellent.  The actors who play the scientists really seem to believe that they are receiving data from a spacecraft on Mars.

The funniest part of this movie is when a really smart scientist guy is talking about science or computers (or something along those lines) and he is wearing a t-shirt that says, ""What part of the quantum theory don't you understand?""....  Do you get it?  Nobody understands the quantum theory except for really smart people like scientists.

At one point, the spacecraft reports that it is snowing on Mars!!

My favorite part of the movie is when the narrator asks one of the scientists what the most surprising discovery of the mission was.  The scientist replies, ""I can't tell you that yet.""  Then he winks at the camera as if to say, ""We found bones!""

Nasa's stated goal is to prove that extraterrestrial evolution is a fact.  So it is interesting to watch these Nasa propaganda films which are designed to convince people that we are close to proving extraterrestrial evolution.
I look forward to the sequel.  Since The Phoenix found food and water on Mars in this movie, I expect that in the sequel it will discover animals or maybe even super-evolved humanoids!  Stay tuned....",1280966400,,1987,4.880597014925373
