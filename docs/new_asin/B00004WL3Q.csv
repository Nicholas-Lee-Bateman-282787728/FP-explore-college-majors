This title sucks!!! none of the actual people featured on the cover were highlighted in the video.  The closest thing was the literally 2 secs of showing Ken shamrocks face because he was behind a student!  As a mixed martial arts fan, I was extremely disappointed with this DVD.  Overall I would not recommend it because it is misleading.",991094400,3,446,4.402439024390244
8231583,5,B00004WL3Q,"It was the first time I saw a King of the Cage event, but I had seen many great comments about it.  So when it arrived, I expected a lot... and I wasn't disappointed!  This event is full of young names, not very well known (yet) but really promising fighters!  And what can I say, I love a good finish, and this one has plenty of great endings: submissions (may I just mention Stepp's armbar), KO's, ref stoppages.  There are some judges decisions, but they are inevitable, and even then the figths are action-packed, with not much stalling and good technique.  I sincerely recommend you to buy this DVD, it's a must for any mixed martial arts fan!  Ohh, and don't miss Medina head-butting (an accident?) Wallid Ismael...",989280000,2,721,4.59375
