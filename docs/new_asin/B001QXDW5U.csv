8619105,2,B001QXDW5U,Shepard Fiarey isn't a artist but a egotistical a@@h@@e! He thinks because he got lucky and picked the first black President is the only reason his art  is worth what it is! He is now going to jail for everything he has said about everything since that print came out! He lied to the courts in a Civil case that was all because he didn't want to admit he took someone elses picture scanned it and made millions off it! So now that it was found out that he is fake and we were email friends and I asked him when and if he knew the he lied to the coutrts he defriended me and I found out everything he does is fake and to make money and he could careless about his values unless there is a $ sign behind it!,1338076800,,705,3.964788732394366
