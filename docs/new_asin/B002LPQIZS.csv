3948834,5,B002LPQIZS,"D.W.Griffith was a genius. I didn't watch silent movies when I was younger. I thought they were weird. Boy was I wrong.
These people really had to act. They had to tell stories with their eyes and hands. D.W.Griffith's movies were exceptionally great with telling these stories. Orphans of the Storm is with the Lillian and Dorothy Gish leaving their home to go to Paris and getting caught up in the French Revolution. Intolerance is an epic about good fighting evil Way Down East is a great movie about deceit of a young girl in love and the lengths a man went to to have her. This is a great movie with fantastic outdoor scenes which are real and the stars did themselves. For 1920 it's amazing. Broken blossoms is about prejudice. The way Mr. Griffith takes you in and lets you see all these movies at his angle is amazing as well  Worth the money.",1397779200,9,851,4.455128205128205

8373206,4,B002LPQIZS,"5 great movies, if you like silent movies. All are the Lillian Gish/D.W.Griffith combination. The movies are all different tales and each has it's own entertainment value. I am now watching Birth of a Nation and it is amazing to think how this and other movies were made given the technology of the time. These are all truely materpiece movies that I am glad I have added to my collection.",1510185600,,389,4.571428571428571

8373208,5,B002LPQIZS,"A great price for a collection of silent film classics from DW Griffith.
Staring Lillian Gish, one of my favorite actors of all time.
Broken Blossoms was the first Lillian Gish movie I had seen, then Way Down South,
Birth of A Nation was the movie that set me to thinking about the civil war, and motivated further research into more of the history surrounding that awful war.
Intolerance, was a huge movie. and of course, Orphans of the Storm, is another powerful movie.",1507766400,,471,4.619047619047619
