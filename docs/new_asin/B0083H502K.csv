5124680,4,B0083H502K,"This is more than a mystery, it is a glimpse into the culture of Sicily in the late 19th century. The unfolding of the story is slow, but stay with it. You'll be surprised. A very clever story.",1414540800,4,193,4.105263157894737
5124681,5,B0083H502K,"What a blast!  Either Pato is your worst nightmare (if you're a husband) or a kind of Anansi the Spider, or Coyote--only even smarter.  The flashbacks and scene-entering (where narrating characters walk amongst the actors who are playing out the story) may not be everybody's cup of tea---I loved it.  The Commisario and the Carbinieri's interaction is golden, just golden, as they put forth (and then take back) the truth of Pato's disappearance.  The mob tendrils in everything, a cheerful culture of corruption, a 3-D look at the Virgin-Whore bind Italian women were in--it's all delightful and insightful.  As mentioned in another review, the ending's music is sheer emotional joy.",1396915200,3,685,5.1909090909090905
5124682,3,B0083H502K,"The acting is fine, but the story did not hold my interest. I would not recommend this as a purchase.",1383004800,,101,4.1
5124683,4,B0083H502K,"While this movie may not be award winning, it is very enjoyable featuring good acting, easy to read subtitles and clever plot line.",1382918400,6,131,4.739130434782608
5124684,3,B0083H502K,"Clever account and good acting, but a bit overdone with gross scenes. Not my cup of tea, really.

5124685,5,B0083H502K,"The Vanishing of Pat&oacute; is absolutely delightful, and very Italian/Sicilian.

Not a conventional mystery, by any means, this period film, which is laced with wry, quirky  wit, relates the 'history' of fictional Montelusa/Vigata during the Risorgimento, and the enforced co-operation between a crusty Sicilian Capitano of the Carabinieri and a meticulous Northern Commissario of the Polizia in the investigation of the disappearance of a supposedly respectable banker and a large amount of the bank's funds. The fact that the Northerner hails from Naples is a very Italian joke that depends on one's perspective in a country where North tends to condescend a bit when it comes to South [This reviewer calls Rome home].

The cinematography, which takes us on a journey to the Greek temples at Agrigento--among other Sicilian locations--is superb, as are the costumes. Watching the film, in fact, is like viewing an old daguerrotype to which tints have been added. The sight of the Carabiniere riding his black draught horse with the long curly fetlocks--it resembles a steed that the Normans must have ridden--is sheer magic. The handless corpse placed on top of the handless reclining giant Greek Telemon statue adds a dimension of macabre humour to the scenario, and the scenes of the local passion play set the stage, as it were, for the mystery.

The director has interpreted Andrea Camilleri's novel as a meta-theatrical trope, in which the boundaries become blurred between reality and illusion, as the two detectives unravel the mystery. One of the charms of the modern Montalbano series is a similar blurring of the boundaries between mystery, comedy, and tragedy, the difference being that in ""Montalbano"" the blurring is subliminal, whereas in ""The Vanishing,"" it is deliberate, and the viewer is gradually made aware that he is watching an act of theatrical magic.

This film is for serious lovers of Italy, of Montalbano, and of the tales of Andrea Camilleri, who don't mind being taken on a whimsical journey into a fictional past, with a kernel of historical truth. They will not be disappointed.",1356220800,16,2113,5.18475073313783
5124686,2,B0083H502K,"The only interesting aspect of this movie is the location of the events -Montelusa ,Scicily; and associated to the very populr Montalbano series. Unfortunately Montelusa landscape is only revealed at the initial scenes ,otherwise not shown during the film. The story ,although ""historical"" , is completely predictable and developed as a combination of comedy and documental. The actors were given the task to develop "" cartoon characters"" which did not work well at all.",1355616000,6,470,5.364864864864865
5124687,5,B0083H502K,"Andrea Camilleri has written many, many books besides the Montalbano series.  Unfortunately they are not available in English, yet, although readers of German, French and Spanish can find them in their bookstores.  This movie, as accurately described in the editorial review above, is a delightful look at an example of his other work, part of which are books dealing with various incidents in Sicilian history circa 1890. In many of his books, he takes a footnote to history, a paragraph from a newspaper or some other similar ""bit"" and constructs a story around the ""finding.""  This story sprouted from a situation mentioned on the last page of Sciascia's To Each His Own.  The production is excellent.  The scene changes and flashbacks are handled with imagination.  The subtitles are easy to read and the song at the end, Canzone di Pato, which can be found on You Tube, is ear candy.  My only regret is that for my taste there isn't quite enough of gorgeous Sicily.",1341878400,16,970,4.842424242424243
8524528,5,B0083H502K,"This was pure joy from beginning to end, one of those movies you just don't want to end. The story was great, but the acting, the characters and especially the warm hearted comedy made it such a pleasure to watch. It reminded me how comedia del arte was an Italian invention and to this day they are best in it.",1506988800,,311,4.2

8524532,5,B0083H502K,Two public officials trying to do their job and at the same time appease their superiors and town's people.  Very smart and realistic.  Highly representative of Sicily and their people.,1453334400,,185,5.133333333333334

8524536,4,B0083H502K,"Very witty piece. Shows the differences between Sicilian and Italian culture of its day. Actors played well off of each other.
While the screenwriting could have tightened towards the end, I thought it was a wonderful portrait of it's time period and of Andrea Camilleri's work. It was refreshing to see his writing.",1423440000,2,316,4.981132075471698
8524537,4,B0083H502K,"Not a bad movie, but not the best. If you are a fan of Italian mystery movies, I'd say Montalbano is better but this is OK.",1421366400,2,123,3.769230769230769
