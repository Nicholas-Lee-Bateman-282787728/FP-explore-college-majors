This series. This. SERIES.
In case you are wondering, yes this is a real thing, (but no it is not serious- this is a comedy/drama. Heavy on the comedy, light on the drama.)
I give this DVD box set 3 stars because I would give the series 5, (I would give it 6, really, I am now obsessed,) but unfortunately the English subtitles are really, really terrible. I have no idea what the quality is on the Cantonese and Mandarin subs, but the English ones are almost unintelligible.

SO:
Buy this if a) you speak Japanese, or b) you are comfortable [referencing the works of other translators](https://www.d-addicts.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=160782) while supporting the show's creators.

And look forward to Season 2!",1437868800,15,725,5.016666666666667
