4565867,4,B0054DPLRU,"Enjoyed the journey through the states. Just enough info to get my interest, but not so long as to belabor the point. Could have had a bit more detail, but then how would they get 50 states on the four discs?",1356480000,5,208,4.097560975609756
4565868,4,B0054DPLRU,"I really should say 5, or 4.9.  It's really a great documentary--just a bit dry (not that there is any more interesting way to present such a subject).  You have to be in the mood for a classroom like documentary, and then it's great.",1355097600,6,234,4.295454545454546
4565869,5,B0054DPLRU,Very nice documentary of the states which provides brilliantly insightful information that would otherwise go completely unnoticed about American history.,1354406400,,154,6.75
4565870,5,B0054DPLRU,What a great find and absolutely fascinating look at each of the states which make up the USA.  Each descriptions for a State is about 5-10mins long but it gives a really great overview and leaves you wanting to know more about each State which to me is what makes it successful.  I certainly enjoyed watching it as an Australian and learned heaps of interesting information.,1341273600,4,375,4.666666666666667
4565871,4,B0054DPLRU,"I am a high school social studies teacher and I purchased this for substitute days or just as an add-in to US History lesson plans. You could probbaly find use for it in a geography, government or civics class as well. Its a cute DVD that includes interesting facts about each state. I'm not sure about the sequential order of the states though - its not alphabetical, and its also not done by when the states entered the Union. That's my only complaint, that there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the order the states are discussed!",1335916800,7,543,4.44
4565872,5,B0054DPLRU,"Very informative set about the states.  Easy to use, easy to choose a particular state within the dvd.  This is a well put together compilation of history of each of the US states.",1333843200,13,180,4.424242424242424
4565873,3,B0054DPLRU,"History gives its viewers a brief overview of the history, geography, socio-economics, and politics of each of the 50 states of the Union in the first three DVDs of the set under review.  Some viewers will probably be left ""hungry"" for a more in-depth account of some states of particular interest to them.  In the fourth DVD of this production, History offers its audience a more thorough coverage of three milestones in the history of the Nation, i.e., the Louisiana Purchase, the Lewis & Clark Expedition, and the Mexican-American War.  In summary, this DVD set is a good didactic tool to know more about the U.S.",1321228800,28,616,4.7924528301886795
4565874,4,B0054DPLRU,"In My Opinion:

Originally aired in 13 different documentaries in 2007 and features all 50 states. Narrated by Edward Hermann who played FDR on TV but mostly recognizable to me as Richard Gilmore from the Gilmore Girls.

I loved all the real photographs and video pieced together with interviews by historians from today. Wonderful 3D effects as we look at the states too! Very different from the movies I used to watch in Social Studies class in school. This would have kept me much more interested.

Did you knew New Hempshire is called the ""Granite State""? It sits on a ton of granite!

Also, that their motto ""Live Free or Die"" is constantly heard during seat belt law debates.

I had no idea that my favorite Levi Jeans came out of California and were originally intended for Miners.

Ground Hog Day originated from something called Candle Mass Day, a religious holiday and the animal of choice was a hedge hog. True story!

Or, did you know that Virginia took it's name from Queen Virginia ""the virgin Queen"" and that the slogan Virginia is for lovers, used to read Virginia is for history lovers?

And, that beside Idaho being known for potatoes, they also have the tallest waterfall called the Shushonee Falls or, the Niagara of the West.

If these documentaries were available when I was a kid, I would have been much more educated in America history, something I am so terribly ignorant in.",1319414400,32,1400,4.704918032786885
4565892,3,B0054DPLRU,"I bought DVD instead of blu-ray since my parents are ""old fashioned"" and haven't moved up to highest resolution yet. They will. The program is good and gives great history of how this country was formed. If you wish to remember or just want to learn, these work very well. I suffered from a TBI, or traumatic brain injury, so I like re-learning my old history.",1370822400,,360,4.46969696969697

4565898,4,B0054DPLRU,"My 11 year old son and I enjoyed this series. The only ""complaint"" I could have is that there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the order the states are presented. It did not take away from it though.",1362614400,,208,3.9761904761904763
4565899,5,B0054DPLRU,"This is an excellent series, portrayed in wonderful ways. It is amazing how much information is packed into so little time. One could argue it takes a long to time cover a topic such as the State of California (for example), and one could complain enough time wasn't spent there yet it could take the whole series to go in debt on any State, let alone this one. Well worth the time, informative and done in an entertaining way.",1360540800,,427,4.417721518987341

However,  I did learn a few new things watching this DVD.  If you like history and travel, this is a good DVD to watch.",1392940800,,266,4.137254901960785
8456495,5,B0054DPLRU,"This video is perfect way to learn about each state.  It gives a broad overview of the historical side; as well as, it gives a cultural understanding and how it evolved to what it is today.  It does a great job to keep the attention of my 10 and 14 year old.",1375747200,,258,3.9423076923076925

8456498,5,B0054DPLRU,I teach US History for 11th grade and this went well for that end of the year time when you just need some fillers. We watched a few states a day and worked on a big project. The students all enjoyed the little known trivia that was included in each state's segment. Highly recommend.,1371340800,5,284,4.277777777777778
