8549266,5,B00AAQ7KKC,"Beautiful! Superb! Eye candy of the first order! More, the six views of underwater edens are educational.  We see tropic forests, birds and other land animals, even a cold place. I love to watch the goings-on of sea creatures--a source of endless wonder. ""Undersea Edens"" is uplifting and thoroughly enjoyable. We observe incredible variety in the underwater world, far more than we would see, even if we had somehow traveled around the world with snorkel equipment. Better to enjoy these scenes from the comfort of my recliner. Again, ""Undersea Edens"" is delightful!",1480723200,,567,5.163043478260869

Bought copies for my grandsons.",1407196800,,182,4.71875
8549268,5,B00AAQ7KKC,Undersea Edens (six 30 minute programs) are the best filmed and most informative undersea videos I have seen. My friends have purchased it after seeing them. I only wish it was available in blue-ray. If you can't go to Australia this is the next best thing.,1371945600,,257,4.608695652173913
