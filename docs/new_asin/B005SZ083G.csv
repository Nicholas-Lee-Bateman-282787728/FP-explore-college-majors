8485665,5,B005SZ083G,"The Japanese DVD release of SpongeBob SquarePants The Complete Third Season has all the same episodes from that season, in English and Japanese dub. However there's a few edited episodes different than broadcast and Just One Bite is one of em. Sadly... this release doesn't have the very first episode originally seen on Region 1 because the Japanese SpongeBob Season sets don't have extras.
The Japanese dub unfortunately the music sounds slightly low pitched, and it's presented in Mono while the English original is Stereo.

Unless you want to watch the Japanese dub episodes, get them while supplies last. But again you need a Region Free DVD Player or change your secondary DVD burner to Region 2.",1436054400,,702,5.0
