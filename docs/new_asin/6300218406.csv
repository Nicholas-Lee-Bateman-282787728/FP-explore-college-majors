271442,4,6300218406,"I've had the internet for almost 4 years and I've been searching for this movie on V.H.S. or D.V.D. and here it is, finally !!!  Fred Ward is a good actor and I wish he was more known then he is.  He plays the part of a dirt bike racer.  On his racing circuit, he gets lost somewhere in the desert and accidentally gets transported back in time, to the late 1800's.  A research group was conducting a time travel experiment and for reasons of safety and secrecy, they set up the time travel machine out in the middle of the desert, hundreds of miles from the nearest person.  Not knowing what it is, Fred Ward goes over to it on his dirt bike and the moment he pulls up to it, the research group activates it and he gets thrown back in time, about 100 years.  I won't tell you the rest, but it's pretty cool and there are some funny moments during the movie as well.  Thank God it's being transferred to D.V.D. !!!",982195200,8,914,4.159090909090909

271564,4,6300218406,"A nice twist in the plot was the scene where Swann talks to a local woman of the mid 19th century. He says he finished high school. She immediately asks if he can read. He says yes, in a surprised tone. Whereupon she brings out 3 books [from the 19th century, naturally] and challenges him to read them. Books by Mark Twain. He tells her that he has read Twain's most famous novel, Tom Sawyer, which she has never heard of. Very neat touch. That book would not have been famous in the year of the plot. Well, Swann opens the book she gives him and slowly starts reading. Her expression changes to one of belief; that he wasn't boasting.

Not a high tech special effects scene. But a succinct underlining of how times changed. Others remarked more often on the action scenes, especially at the end. Sometimes nuances are unappreciated.

Belinda Bauer was excellent in her role. She played it perfectly. I am sorry to see she is no longer acting.",1451779200,,944,4.482558139534884

271569,5,6300218406,My husband was obsessed with finding this movie. He'd had a VHS version from when he was a kid. He loved the movie so we were super excited when we found it on bluray!! He watched it immediately. It was a win for a christmas present! He use to race dirt bikes as a kid so this was something he remembered from his child hood. Would make a great gift.,1437868800,,350,4.014285714285714
271570,4,6300218406,"The quality of the cinematography really shines through clearly in this blu-ray version of the 1982 cult classic.  Plus, the original ending (spoiler alert), of bad guy Porter Reese's boots with bloody meat hanging off them when he is ground up by the tail rotor of the helicopter has been restored!  There is even a new making-of documentary which really gets inside of the heads of Timerider's screwball creators, producer and co-writer Michael Nesmith of the Monkees and co-writer and director William Dear.  The only thing that keeps this from being a perfect 5-star review is:  Where's the surround sound?  The sound, listed on the case as DTS-HD Master Audio stereo, seems to be completely lacking a rear channel(s) and is firmly anchored in the front speakers.  This is a little disappointing, considering that, in addition to Michael Nesmith (who also composed the music)'s great rock 'n roll score, there were exciting surround effects in all previous releases of this film including the excellent Anchor Bay DVD, enhanced by the Aphex Aural Exciter process, like the ambience inside ""Dr. Sam""'s laboratory and when one of the race cars zooms into the rear channels during a night scene when Jessie is trying to get Swann on the radio in the Baja 1000.  (sign)  Can't have it all I guess.  I'll be holding onto my DVD for this reason when I want to be blown away by the sound.  Otherwise, great release!",1437350400,2,1412,4.845833333333333

271619,4,6300218406,Classic movie that I was thrilled to find on DVD. I was a little worried about quality since it is an old movie but it was a great picture.,1429228800,,139,3.8275862068965516
271620,5,6300218406,"Aha! First of all, let's be clear: This BR disc is ""Complete"" because it includes the ""Missing"" 3 seconds of the graphic demise of the lead villain, Porter Reece, as brilliantly portrayed by Peter Coyote. So forget about the ""old"" DVD that stupidly censored the hotly discussed complaint from the majority of the reviewers. Now, I give this movie the full 5 Stars because
1) It's ""Unedited"" and shows the entire movie as it was shown theatrically.
2) It has the BEST cast ever, comprised of the most respected and incredible ""Who's Who"" of ""Character Actors"" that you won't find in any other movie. You've got Fred Ward, Belinda Bauer, Peter Coyote, Richard Masur, Tracey Walter, Ed Lauter, L.Q. Jones, Chris Mulkey, Macon McCalman, and the great Bruce Gordon. You may not recognize their names, but you definitely will recognize them once you see them.
3) The soundtrack is incredible! Every score matches the on screen action effortlessly. Incredibly, the music score is composed by none other than Michael Nesmith, of the 60's band, The Monkeys
4) The storyline is solid. Yes, it's ""old"" and not very original by today's standards, but what makes this ""Time Travel"" movie so distinct is the realistic behavior that Fred Ward conveys throughout the movie. Namely, he's just clueless that he's actually traveled back in time. If you're lucky to have never seen the movie, you have to see this version. NO SPOILERS will be covered by me, despite what some other reviewers may have done.
5) The BR ""Extras"" is slightly stingy here, but it does include a great behind documentary with director William Dear and Michael Nesmith discussing in length about the creative and logistical process with bringing this movie to life.

And yes, I originally saw the movie when it was shown theatrically, but was very unhappy when it was released on DVD because of the ""Censored"" issue. However, now that this has been corrected, I am very happy with my purchase, and satisfied to see this movie get the BR treatment that it deserves. And the price is just right!",1428105600,2,2049,4.854285714285714

The sound was good. Well, as good as the soundtrack for an 80's low-budget film can be. I had read many reviews before ordering, and was glad to know that the ending remained the same since some versions had changed it, apparently. The premise of this movie is what makes it work. The script and acting are a little corny, but it's an enjoyable ride!",1423440000,,516,4.222222222222222

271764,5,6300218406,I just picked up the Bluray of Timerider. I hadn't seen this film in over 20 years and was kind of looking for it over the years but kept hearing about edited versions that were more made for TV and such. Well finally they released the uncut version and on Bluray no less. It still holds up so well for being almost 32 years old. The riding scenes are awesome at the beginning and the music is really well done for this type of film and the time it was made. I always loved the premise of a modern machine being transported into the old west. The acting is very good throughout the cast here and the story line is simple but very effective. One thing to note is the sound quality on the Bluray is amazing.... especially the music. All in all this is one of my favorite films from the 80's and now on a remastered Bluray disk it is even better. And YES the bloody boots scene is in there!! LOL!!! There is also a really great dual interview of the director and producer on the disk that was shot recently. I wish Fred Ward had come back for it but it was really interesting how they came up with this film.,1389052800,3,1105,4.144186046511628
271765,4,6300218406,"Always loved this quirky, offbeat film. It's a lot of fun and has good turns by all of the principal actors. Fred Ward is as charming as ever, Peter Coyote is nasty fun as the slick villain, and his dim-witted sidekicks are a hoot. If you've never seen this movie, you're in for a treat. Think of it as Back to The Future meets Silverado. Lots of excitement & thrills, some awesome motocross stuff, gorgeous desert scenery and a thumping rock-synth score by producer Mike (The Monkees) Nesmith. It's enjoyable for all but the youngest viewers; it might be a tad violent for the little ones, so be warned. Shout! Factory has done a nice job with this Blu-ray presentation. The picture looks great, the audio is solid and there are some nice extras thrown in, including director's commentary and an interesting, newly shot ""making of"" featurette. (Boy, does Mike Nesmith look OLD! LOL) This release is the complete film, too, folks. NOT the crummy edited version that plagued fans for years prior to this Blu-ray. Nice work, Shout!

271825,5,6300218406,"Blu-Ray Review:

I remember back when I was a kid watching this on a Betamax player. That was before we had VHS. First off let me say that the picture is excellent as well as the sound. You might notice some grain but that's quite normal for an old movie.

Bonus Features: Making of Timerider with writer/director William Dear and writer/producer/composer Michael Nesmith, still galleries, trailer/tv spots.

Audio Options: 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio with optional commentary with writer/director William Dear

My only complaint with this Blu-Ray is that it does not contain a scene selection menu. Only three options are available. Play movie, bonus features, and audio options.

Now for the main and most important question I'm sure many people want answered. A scene involving the main villains death, Porter Reese. Played by Peter Coyote near the end of the movie. On Vhs the scene is in place. Years later it was released on dvd by Anchor Bay. The scene is edited resulting in angering many fans of the movie, including myself. Anchor Bay failed miserably. The dvd is now out of print. So don't bother wasting your money.

So to answer your question everyone, yes. Yes the bloody boots scene IS included in the Blu-Ray! The movie is uncut as it was intended to be. Thank you so much Shout! Factory for making this right.",1372291200,7,1322,4.827433628318584
271826,5,6300218406,I can't believe the quality of this picture. It is stunning. Quite a  Difference from the old Video Express VHS version. Great movie and a nice interview with Mr. Nesmith. Great to see Lyle Swann remastered and still fighting cowboys in the old west. Belinda Bauer has never looked better!!!!!!!,1371859200,,295,4.9
271827,5,6300218406,"Having the Anchor Bay version DVD, knowing it was not right (ending footage) and it would not play in my Blu-ray player anymore. I was surprised to find ""Timerider"" new on Blu-ray for less than a used DVD. First thing you notice is no ""Anchor Bay"" logo and the MGM Lion is back. Next thing no scene selection so skipping forward to chapter 12 and to my pleasant surprise.... bloody feet! Yes it is back no missing footage.",1370304000,4,422,4.423076923076923

Well, after  a night of Ted Nugent and other top notch heavy rockers we would watch SNL.......which was a big deal back in those days! This film came on later that night and those who didn't pass out caught a fairly enjoyable ""fish out of water"" flick called Timerider!

The first thing I noticed was that it was produced by ex-Monkee Mike Nesmith and starred a fairly unknown Fred Ward.

The premise basically has a motor cycle rider going back in time to the old west with his cycle and riding gear and well......you get the picture.

It's a fun movie with a good cast even if the ending is a bit confusing and dumb if you really think about it, but the biggest disappointment is on this DVD release. Some idiot edited out about three seconds worth of film that just completely ruins the entire experience!

271934,3,6300218406,"Lyle Swann (Fred Ward, ""Escape from Alcatraz,"" ""Silkwood,"" ""Tremors"") is running a cross-country motorcycle race when he is launched more than 100 years into the past.  He meets a motley cast of characters that includes criminal Porter Reese (Peter Coyote, ""E.T.,"" ""Sphere,"" ""Patch Adams,""), and Claire Cygne (Belinda Bauer).  Lyle never does realize that he has traveled to the past during the movie.

This movie is actually fun to watch if you like time travel movies.  There are aspects of this movie that are vaguely reminiscent of time travel stories by Robert A. Heinlein, such as ""By His Bootstraps"" and ""All You Zombies...""  I enjoyed how Swann reacted to his surroundings as though he had gotten lost in modern America, though he had traveled into the past.  Most time travel movies have the principal character or characters know that they traveled into the past and have them react accordingly.

This movie does have some plot holes, typical for time travel movies in general and especially for low budget time travel movies.  However, the movie is sufficiently interesting that you keep watching to see what Lyle Swann will do next, most of the time anyway.  The biggest problem the DVD release has is that it replaced the ending originally seen on HBO and available on VHS with an awful ending that has significantly less irony and I found personally less satisfying.  I would probably have given this movie 4 stars had the original ending been retained.

Michael Nesmith co-produced this movie.  He also wrote the music and appears in a cameo.  People who remember the 60's well may recall that Nesmith was a member of The Monkees (the tallest member, who was also one of the two members who could actually play instruments when they joined the band).  Nesmith became a powerful force in the music video business, producing videos and records while still recording music.  This movie was one of his numerous projects after departing The Monkees.

Even with the awful change to the end of this movie, it is a good movie to watch if you want to see a different take on time travel movies.  The movie was filmed with a serious and sincere tone rather than being played for laughs.  Indeed, there are several violent deaths in this movie that make this movie unsuitable for family members younger than 12 or 13 years old.

Because of the change to the ending I recommend either trying to track down the VHS with the original ending, or wait until another DVD comes out with the original ending.

Good luck!",1182124800,2,2516,4.806976744186047

271981,3,6300218406,"Fred Ward stars in another film that emphasized the main character in the title.  Ward was in a film called  REMO WILLIAMS: THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES.  The original title when this film was released was called TIMERIDER: THE ADVENTURE OF LYLE SWAN. A motocross racer (Swan/Ward),circa 1980's, is caught in a time travel experiment with motorcycle in tow, and is unwittingly sent back to around the 1870's. Then he is chased down by gunslinging cowboys who want his 'machine'.This reviewer fondly remembers seeing this film 20 plus years ago and it seemed to be more fun and adventurous (probably because this reviewer was watching it with a bunch of drinking buddies).  Seeing it again, it didn't hold up as it seemed to be slow and left a lot of things unexplained. Also, one of the other reviews on this page for TIMERIDER confirmed my suspicions.  One of the memorable sequences is near the end when Peter Coyote's character, Reese, is decapitated by a helicopter and all that's left was was his upright empty boots on a cliff with blood and smoke coming out of them. The DVD version is totally different as Reese just stops shooting and is seen just ducking down to avoid the helicopter as Lyle Swan (Ward) escapes. It didn't make sense, and it took away from the whole atmosphere of the film. Otherwise, the rest of the film is a decent time travel story and with a slight social commentary of old world meeting new world in terms of technology and mechanization (i.e. Lyle Swan's motorcycle is perceived in the 1870's as an evil entity).  The film is helped with a great support cast with Richard Masur (THE THING),TRACEY WALTER (BATMAN, CITY SLICKERS), Ed Lauter (THE LONGEST YARD),L.Q. Jones,Peter Coyote, and a sexy Belinda Bauer. Michael Nesmith (THE MONKEES) was the co-producer, co-screenwriter, and did the music score.  He even makes a non-speaking cameo in the film (he's one of the spectators (in a close-up scene) watching Lyle Swan riding on his 'bike' in the desert motocycle racing sequences in the first part of the film.) Overall, a film that is a curiosity because Michael Nesmith was involved in its production. However, it doesn't hold up as an adventure film in terms of its popcorn action and its the filmaking techniques.  Lastly, the re-edited ending with Peter Coyote's character living through the helicopter sequence was unnecessary.",1105056000,3,2363,4.904761904761905

This is your basic fish out of water story with a motocross racer, Lyle Swan (played by Fred Ward) gets unknowingly caught in a time travel experiment and launched about 100 years in the past.  The general reaction, due to his attire and motorized horse is that he is some kind of devil, but one person he comes across, Porter Reese, a criminal outlaw played by Peter Coyote, sees the potential in owning this amazing contraption for himself.  All of this takes place in the southern California desert, and Lyle is unaware of what has happened to him.  He thinks he just got lost during a race, and tries to find his way back home.  I thought it was interesting that he never really gets clued into the fact that he is 100 years out of time.  As I said in the beginning, and I think another reviewer mentions this, that a few critical seconds were cut out of a scene at the end.  These few seconds of missing footage include a helicopter, its rear rotor blade, and the main antagonist.  I think this part was edited out for a television release and never put back in for the DVD release, which is a real shame.  You wouldn't think 3 to 5 seconds of footage could impact a movie as much as it does, but it does here.  This is the reason why I am giving the release 3 stars instead of four.

271984,4,6300218406,"UPDATE 5/16/2015: Now that Shout! Factory has released a new, *complete* Blu-ray version of TIMERIDER, my complaints below (and the entire DVD version) are moot. I will leave my review up for historical purposes, as well as to illustrate the already-widely-known differences between Anchor Bay and Shout! Factory. Also, because Amazon commingles the DVD and Blu-ray reviews, despite their being separate entities and deserving of their own listings, I am upping my rating.

ORIGINAL DVD REVIEW: I give the movie 4 stars; the soundtrack 5 stars; and the DVD 2 stars. I wish I had read the Amazon reviews before I picked this DVD up last night--but then, why would I have expected that anything had changed? I've been a fan of TIMERIDER since its theatrical release, so I was very happy to have it on DVD finally, and pleased with the transfer, but the TV/airline-version ending completely BITES. ""Okay, here comes the tail rotor...and I can hear Reese screaming...and all those squishy sound effects...but...but...YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!"" (Good thing I was home alone.)

The original sequence was a brilliant and memorable piece of film-making that worked by suggestion: it showed everything it needed to without showing...well, everything. But most importantly, it was where the bad guy got his well-deserved comeuppance. How satisfying would the ending of ""Die Hard"" have been if John McClane had just left Hans Gruber cowering on the floor? Or if, after Luke Skywalker torpedoed the Death Star, the lights just flickered out?

Distributor Anchor Bay claims that the DVD was made from the ""only usable negative available."" Uh...sure. I find it impossible to believe that Michael ""Mr. Video"" Nesmith couldn't find a single viable source in his files for THREE WHOLE SECONDS of film. Laserdisc? How about digitally cleaning up a VHS tape? Unfreakinbelievable.*

Am I upset? You're darn tootin' I am. Sometimes ""little"" things matter A LOT.

UPDATE 7/16/09: I just purchased a copy of TIMERIDER on laserdisc, and guess what: the missing footage (no pun intended) is there. Granted, it's a washed-out pan-and-scan transfer, but the footage exists in digital form. Guess I'll have to restore it myself. (You can see it on that popular video website.)

*In retrospect, I realize that it likely wasn't up to Nesmith or director William Dear, but to the legal owners of the movie, who probably didn't care what version they released and/or didn't want to spend money to restore the original footage. I mean, who cares what the audience wants, right? From what I've read lately, that's pretty much the Anchor Bay attitude.",1046995200,45,2616,5.100467289719626

When he started to realize something was wrong, why did he not remember what he read on the plaque of the time machine?
But being a fan of alternate reality and time travel, I do enjoy this movie a lot. The idea is believeable, the paradox was well placed and believeable, and it did not get to far into the technical as to bore the viewers. I strongly recommend this movie to anybody that likes alternate history.
My original copy is a VHS copy dubbed from my Beta original right before it died. This DVD release is long overdue.
PS: For about 2 years after this movie was released, it did have a Midnight Movie viewership in the Los Angeles area. This is where I first saw it, in a theatre that also showed Mad Max, Rocky Horror, and Heavy Metal.",1001894400,5,1166,4.256756756756757

I've described it to my 15 year old son, who is an avid dirt bike rider and he can't wait to see it.  I'm so happy it's now available!",998697600,,309,3.611940298507463
272045,3,6300218406,"Fred Ward and Peter Coyote turn in good performances in this time travel movie. Ward is accidently thrown back to the Old West when riding his motocross bike in a race. He stumbles across a time travel experiament and ends up back in the late 1800s. Coyote wants his bike at any cost and it's a game of cat and mouse for Ward to keep it from him. And if that doesn't get your interest, he has sex with his great great grandmother. Talk about a paradox.",989280000,,452,4.206896551724138
