8513693,3,B007B32Y5I,"Pollster, Rip Smith , sees Grandview as having perfect demographics for polling, so he works undercover in insurance as he secretly conducts his polls.  Turns out, he embarrasses the town nationally. This, in addition to the city leaders of Grandview making disastrous decisions pushes the town nearly into bankruptcy. Rip Smith then steps in to dramatically turn things around. Simple plot herepolitical arrogance and shenanigans, disaster, hero enters, feel good recovery. I either viewed a cut version of this film, or there were serious plot omissions. It was difficult to connect some plot actions to others. Jimmy Stewart plays his gee whiz, optimistic character as he does in many films. This film is no award-winner, but its passable entertainment.",1512864000,,756,5.352941176470588
