8380619,5,B001OA07QW,Fantastic 51 minutes of the Red Hot  Chili Peppers in 90s concert!,1493510400,,66,4.5
8380620,2,B001OA07QW,There are only 9 songs in this whole DVD. Very disappointed!,1484179200,,60,4.545454545454546
8380621,4,B001OA07QW,This is the Reading Festival from 1994. It is the best quality to have surfaced that I have ever seen. As a collector and longtime fan I was very happy to rent this at 1.99 to see what it was. I was pleasantly surprised. It is mostly Blood Sugar Sex Magic with a couple of old tunes and a few songs from One hot Minute. It is Dave Navarro on Guitar.,1440374400,,349,3.9295774647887325
8380622,3,B001OA07QW,"The band was great. it was the recording of the show that wasn't so hot.
Still totally worth the $1.99.",1397001600,,103,4.2
8380623,2,B001OA07QW,kinda generic i have seen better from these guys think it was those crazy drugs days and they cut off some songs,1379980800,,112,4.136363636363637
8380624,3,B001OA07QW,"This vid is probably from the Blood Sugar Sex Magik era. You can watch RHCP vids that are just as good if not better for free on YouTube. IMO the Californication is their best CD ever, and if those songs were on it, I would have definitely given it 5 stars whether I had to pay or if it was free,",1370995200,,296,3.8688524590163933
8380625,4,B001OA07QW,"I have no idea why this is called ""Live From Glastonbury"", this is old video from the August 28, 1994 Reading Festival at Little John's Farm in Reading, England. You can read the reviews for the DVD at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-Live-from-Readingfest/dp/B001GJ4U6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Hot Chili Peppers: Live from Readingfest</a>. The DVD is 80 minutes, this is 51. I have no complaints about it at this low price for a 5 day rental..

As others have noted, John Frusciante is pictured on the faux 'box' for this digital product (in a photo from the naughts, not the 90s), but Dave Navarro is the guitarist in the show. That's fine for me, Navarro is good, and pleasing to the eyes. It was cool to see him blend in strains from Jane's Addiction's ""Three Days"" into Chili Peppers the way he did with Velvet Underground's ""Venus in Furs"" when he played with Jane's Addiction. They are all missing about 2/3rds of their current tats. Since it's from '94, one can maybe get a fraction of a hint of understanding of the Chilies complaints that Faith No More 'copied' them (although if that's the case, David Pirner wants his hair back).

The video has been described as a bootleg, but it's likely this is just typical video from that time. It looks better than a lot of the stuff that was taken from early MTV. Sound quality is fine for old video. It holds up on surround sound unless maxed.
