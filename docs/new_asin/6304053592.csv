7860534,2,6304053592,"Under Jack Sholder's direction and the acting talents of Kyle McLachlan and Michael Nouri, the original HIDDEN remains one of the best scifi films of recent times.  This lame sequel doesn't have Sholder, McLachlan and Nouri.  Instead we get Raphael Sbarge as the alien cop, Kate Hodge as Nouri's daughter and inept direction from writer/director Seth Pinsker.  Pinsker keeps most of the movie so poorly lit, it's hard to tell at times what is going on, and after the exciting finale of the original, Pinsker's climax is boring and unexciting.  Shame Sholder wasn't hired to do the sequel...this one's way below par.",1080691200,,615,5.0
7860535,1,6304053592,"he first ten minutes of this film are great ... but most people who are watching this sequel will quickly notice that it's just footage from the first film which starred Kyle MacLachlan.
Kyle's character, a good alien, kills off one of the bad aliens but not before it spawns. Time passes and another good alien teams up with the daughter of the star from the first flic.
What results is a film with little intrigue and no new concepts. They could have provided more insights into the alien races or maybe showcased some cooler alien powers or forms. The anticlamatic ending will leave many wondering why?",1068163200,,605,4.663551401869159

7860537,1,6304053592,"This movie, the sequel to a superlative sci-fi film, The Hidden, is a truly bad movie. Even using about twenty minutes from the original film, as an introductory segue, cannot save this incoherent mess. In the original film, an intergalactic lawman comes to earth in search of a parasitic criminal from another planet who uses other living creatures as a host body. Our intrepid lawman hooks up with a jaded detective, and together they corner this evil incarnate space invader and kill him, or so they think.
The sequel opens with the premise that the creature has somehow survived and managed to spawn others like it, sociopathic, host seeking killers, just lying in wait for the right moment to strike. Fifteen years after the first visitation, another intergalactic lawman has come to Earth to find out what happened and to ensure finality. He seeks out the jaded detective's now grown daughter. From then on, it is down hill all the way. The plot is illogical, incomprehensible, and stupid. The acting is second rate. The special effects are same old, same old. Save your money and do not even bother to rent this turkey, much less buy it.",1024099200,,1144,4.812182741116751
