People have negative opinions about the dress, acting, the actors, the special effects and others. But the core idea of this work is to make people remember Lord Rama and I guess the directors were very successful in making this. That is the thing which matters the MOST!!! Rest all doesn't matter really.",1257465600,5,391,4.681159420289855
8557674,1,B0009HK7GQ,"I am a collector of most books and dramas based on the ancient myth - among all of them i find this to be pathetic, despite the popularity ratings among the northern indian audience and the sentiments that many people carry. Most people - indians especially,for sentimental reasons, view this the same way as the 'passion' was viewed in the states and it sells on that name. But as a work of art, the acting is poor, the music non existent, the settings and costumes straight out of a high school play. The Uttar Khand is modified completely from the original depicting Sita as voluntarily separating. There is no depth or beauty to the picturisation that can engage a more serious viewer and the repeated depiction of the beatific producer (Ramanand Sagar) is a blatant marketing effort.

If you are looking to know more of the epic, try any of the books listed, Ramesh Menon, RK Narayan, Rajagopalachari or if you have more knowledge about indian languages try the telugu movies Sita Rama Kalyanam, Lavakusa and so on. It will be worth your time and interest.",1123027200,3,1061,4.704301075268817
