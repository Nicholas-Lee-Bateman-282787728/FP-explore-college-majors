This is by no means a great movie. There's pretty much zero character development and most of the deaths scenes are either really dark or occur offscreen. However, there's so much cheese contained in this movie that all is forgiven.
If you're a fan of cheesy direct-to-video slasher movies like Slumber Party Massacre 2, Sleepaway Camp 2, and Cheerleader Camp, then you should give Killer Workout a watch if you can find it.",1279756800,12,581,4.596153846153846
7943754,4,B00005LDBQ,"This movie is the definition of 80's jiggley, low budget horror. Not only does it have an original soundtrack, with hits like ""Aerobicide"", it has all the sweatbands, leotards and unnecessary camera angles you will ever see on one screen. With a completely unexpected ending, this is a film you can't miss!!!",1212624000,13,308,4.9423076923076925
