A brilliant piece of investigative journalism.  Heartbreaking at times, but never for a second slow, or boring.  I loved this film.  I love her work.

6365424,2,B00JK7QU6W,"Somewhat disappointing, the documentary would have benefitted from having a narrator rather than the new owner of Maier's archive putting himself front and centre as the presenter, his whiny voice does grate on the nerves. Undoubtably Maier was a talented photographer though I can't help feeling that her archive should be curated by ""professionals"" and the body of work edited to the finest work (hard to due in the absence of the artist) rather than the drip feed of her work as it is scanned. Much emphasis is put on Maiers ""eccentricities"" and do we really need to know she physically abused some of the children in her care? A much better documentary can be found online made by the BBC which Maloof refused to partake in here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0366jd5",1404432000,18,774,5.007751937984496
6365425,4,B00JK7QU6W,"""Finding Vivian Maier"" (2014 release; 83 min.) is a documentary about nanny-turned-street photographer Vivian Maier. As the movie opens, writer-director John Maloof tells the story of how by happenstance a few years ago he bought a big box of negatives and when he started to realize the astonishing quality of those pictures, he tracked down more of those boxes, found the name ""Vivian Maier"", and made it his life's work to do find out more about the mysterious woman. To tell you much more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, I am not giving away much when I say that Maier passed away some 4-5 years ago. Maloof has in essence become the caretaker of her photographic estate and reputation. He has issued at least one book on her that I know of (with another on the way), and his doggedness (other might call it obsession) to get Maier the exposure she never got in her lifetime has lead to the making of this documentary (co-directed by Charlie Siskel). Second, the depth of Maier's collection (over 100,000 pictures, plus a bunch of 8 mm movies and cassette tapes) is amazing, and as such they provide another glimpse into a long gone era. Third, the quality of Maier as a portrait photographer is extraordinary. The documentary contains many examples of that. Last but not least, kudos to the co-directors Maloof and Siskel for bringing this as a sort of ""Where's Waldo"" type film, as we search for clues into Maier's life and why she never released any of these pictures during her lifetime.

I saw ""Finding Vivian Maier"" in early May at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington, DC and the matinee screening where I saw this at was very well attended, I am happy to say. If you like documentaries, and also art, and also a good mystery, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Finding Vivian Maier"" is one of the better movies I have seen this year so far. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1403222400,44,1973,4.666666666666667
6365426,4,B00JK7QU6W,"Fascinating documentary that is actually two stories in the film. One deals with Vivian Maier's life and art. The second is about the person who discovered her photographic archives and his quest to find out who Maier was. There's both a mystery to be unraveled and wonderful photographs from a previously unknown artist. I saw this first in the movie theater when it came out and some people loved it but some people didn't like Maier's personality so they didn't love the movie. I really like her images and find these ""discovery"" stories really interesting so I give this a thumbs up. But I can see how some viewers will be turned off by her less-than-warm personality. Also, some new information has been discovered since the movie came out so it's not entirely up-to-date but not in a significant way in my opinion. Highly recommended for this who like folk art, photography, and seeing how an unknown treasure was lost and how its story is pieced together. The DVD itself doesn't have much in the way of extras. The main film looks and sounds good given the documentary style of the original film. Recommended!",1505606400,,1116,4.757731958762887

6365442,4,B00JK7QU6W,"I recently saw a screening of ""Finding Vivian Maier"". Prior to that screening, I Googled her name and her photos to see what she was all about. That info lead me to signup for that screening which, in general, was quite enjoyable.

I found the first 15-20 minutes quite interesting in terms of what John Maloof had to do to obtain her work and paraphernalia, what it must have been like to go through all her countless work (150,000 photographs), the effort to retrace her life from all her meticulously stored receipts, find and contact people that knew her, the vast quantity of undeveloped rolls of film that needed to be processed, deciding on which prints to exhibit and become the defacto and self appointed curator of her work. That intro also nicely introduced her work throughout that narrative as a flashback cinematic device and supported the notion that she was an accomplished photographer.

What I didn't like about the film was the middle part. It was mostly speculative assertions as to what her character was really like, and started to present her as a mean and delusional person. First, it just diminishes her value and reputation as a photographer. Second, there just doesn't seem to be that much information as to why she never married, and/or had children, why she was so reclusive in her personal life and photographic work. Just to fill in with speculative information is in poor taste.

What is left out in presenting her story as a nanny with the interviews with the surviving children parents, is a time frame relative to her age when she cared for each family, and the length of time she spent in service with each family, and how that changed over her lifetime. After having bought the book, ""Vivian Maier: A Photographer Friend"", her bio, written by Marvin Heiferman, provides some of those details. Her photography started very early with a Brownie camera around age 23. She started in her nanny career in1956 (age 30) for the Gensbergs and did so for 16 years. Those children have the fondest memories of her and were the ones that provided a paid apartment for her toward the end of her life, when she could no longer work effectively. The duration spent in service at later families had an increasingly shorter duration, and toward the end, she wound up caring only for disabled children and aging parents. Her hoarding (photographs, newpapers, personal items) was cited as the reoccuring reason why she had to move on to the next family. Money became tighter and she skimped more to get by. Later, she had to paid for facilities to store her work and extensive possessions, and that caused her financial hardship. By age 60, her photographic work slowed, by age 70, it came to a standstill. Around 1999 (age 73), it is thought that she was homeless, and it is at that point, that her earliest charges, who remembered her with the most fondness, stepped in and provided her with paid living quarters. After that point in time, accounts seem to suggest that she entered a type of dementia and living the life of a bag lady. In 2007, she couldn't afford to pay for the storage facilities and her possessions went up for auction, which is how John Maloof gets custody of them. In 2008 (age 82), she fell and hit her head, taken against her will by ambulance to the hospital, and was expected to make a full recovery. She resisted eating, weakened and was moved to nursing home. By 2009 (age 83) she died. A truly sad end to a gifted photographer. It would have been better if the film included this information rather than it's speculative assertions.

In thinking about what is known of her life, I can see how she might have been a wonderful nanny in her younger years (age 30+) when she had plenty of energy and stamina and that maybe her tolerance for energetic children diminished as she aged. I can also see that she got older, a type of dementia set in and made her difficult to deal with. Explaining her habits and secretiveness about her personal life and photographs may be harder, but after having read some of other people's review of books on her photographic work, their comment were that maybe she was leaning toward the Aspergers syndrome of an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A highly functional and talented person, but inept or uncomfortable with the intricacies and intimacies of human relationships, and has specialized fields of interest or hobbies. Finding a job as a nanny solved a number of things. She mostly had to deal only with children, room and board was an included benefit to her pay, it provided plenty of opportunities to be outdoors (which she liked) and enabled her photography. However, even Aspergers does not fully explain her personality and behavior. The interviews in the film seems to suggest that, perhaps, she was sexually abused as a child, and I can see oblique references to that notion in some of her photographs, but even that is speculative. She will always remain a mystery woman.

The remaining third of the film, delved into her ancestry and filmed the people and village (Saint-Bonnet-en-Champsaur) in the Alpine region in France where her mother was born. Since Vivian Maier was born in New York to a French speaking mother, and having traveled to her mother's home village several times, starting in 1932 (age 6), I can see where she might have picked up some of the French language and perhaps some sort of French accent when speaking in English (or at least can make an attempt of speaking in a French accent). The film makes a big deal about Vivian's 'deception' in speaking with a French accent. The film cites a professor of French linguistics with a PhD dissertation in vowel duration, condemning her French accent and heritage on the basis that her vowels were too long. Well I can see that if Vivian spoke mostly English and some rudimentary French, that proper pronunciation of French was somewhat lacking and a bit drawn out by her English speaking capabilities. Again, the film was quite speculative here and it served no purpose, especially when trying to promote her work.

All in all, I found the film enjoyable, but the middle part with those speculative assertions about her true character is a sore spot for me.

6365459,4,B00JK7QU6W,"Growing up, I had a secret hiding spot where I squirreled away my coin and rock collections, grade school memorabilia, and various important (to me) trinkets. What if my secret hiding spot was the size of an enormous storage unit, contained thousands of rolls of undeveloped film and oodles of bric-a-brac, and went completely undiscovered until after my death? And, by the way, my mountain of photographs are astoundingly well-done. Well, get to know Vivian Maier.

This is a wonderful documentary about an eccentric woman. She is revealed through interviews, photographs, and snippets of video and audio from Maier herself. The young man who discovered her work, by chance, has done an excellent job of weaving a narrative that unfurls slowly, always pulling you deeper down the rabbit hole. The pacing is good, the plot has interesting twists, and, by the end of the film you feel that the character, Maier, a real person, is someone special that the world should have known better when she was alive.

It's not a big spoiler that Maier is deceased. The whole premise for this film is that her hidden artistic life lay fallow in an existence made up of temporary nannying gigs, punctuated by abrupt departures from the families that gave her shelter and a salary. Living this menial life, she completely blended into the background. Not until Maier passed away, and her belongings were auctioned off, did her impressive artistic prowess come to light.

Maier is mysterious, to say the least. She spells her name several ways. She doesn't let people get very close, yet she seems to yearn for camaraderie, a place to belong. Her family history is a sub-plot that gives this doc some of its turns, but I'll leave those for the viewer. Maier is, as Churchill said, a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. An hour-and-one-half-long documentary cannot possibly reveal all there is about this lost soul. But the effort is laudable, and Maier's talent is noteworthy.

The film has a satisfying conclusion, but it does leave the viewer wanting more. Like me, you'll find yourself Googling Vivian Maier to find out details of her life, her work, and this story. It's an interesting and engrossing tale. I recommend it.",1458864000,,2222,4.917333333333334
6365460,1,B00JK7QU6W,"The second half of this documentary made me extremely uncomfortable. It was a brutal and unsympathetic character assassination of an individual who was clearly ""on the spectrum"",  most likely Asperger's, and there was no defending voice offered. The BBC documentary, The Vivian Maier Mystery, not only shows more of what Maier did best-- her street photography--but is more respectful, and more sympathetic to the fact that she was different for a reason. It presents the hints that she had trouble making eye contact, approached people without respecting boundaries, had no friends other than children, and obsessed every moment of her life over a single activity, photography. It also gives hints from those who knew her as a child. Even though Maloof claims to be an advocate for Maier and her work, he comes off as shallow and completely missing the point.",1458691200,4,860,5.099290780141844

6365462,5,B00JK7QU6W,"This is just one of those odd stories where someone comes across something seemingly plain on the surface but turns out to be the find of a lifetime.

Here's the scoop. John Maloof has the knack for going to flea markets or estate sales and zeroing in on items of great value. He's at an auction where unclaimed items are displayed. For $350.00 he gets a few sealed boxes. The big surprise is that the boxes contain thousands of film negatives along with an assortment of other items. He develops a few of the negatives to find the resulting photos to be of great artistic value. Through an assortment of receipts and other clues he's able to track down who the photographer, Vivian Maier, was. He now gets to put together, through the various people who employed her, a story that turns out to be about as odd as one you're likely to come upon.

This is about as good a documentary as I've ever seen. It might not be a socially impactful as some others, but to come across the art of a person who was so totally odd and unwanting of recognition is intriguing. Maier's photos are riveting. She just had the knack for seeing the right stuff and putting it in the right frame. It reminds me much of the work of Diane Arbus. She's not quite as dark as Arbus but people are almost always at the center. And the interviews with those who had her in their employ as a nanny are just as intriguing. This was one weird gal. Had little need for any kind of companionship. Seemed to have no real libido as there were no men in her life. All she wanted to do was be a good enough nanny to get the kids out of the house so she could take her photos. And she was great at it. Maloof has now secured showings of her works in several countries and they are very successful.

This satisfies the viewer on a number of levels. Piecing together the mystery of Vivian along with discovering her works are great pluses. If you are at all into this sort of thing you would be hard pressed for a better way to spend 90 minutes.",1457827200,,2004,4.268421052631579

6365498,4,B00JK7QU6W,"I enjoyed this documentary a great deal but I agree with another reviewer here who felt the work would have greatly benefitted from a timeline as to everything. Thus, having some idea of the dates of the photographs, the dates she was with the people who hired her or were her charges, and so forth, would have been a great asset. There is a lot more to understand about an artist when one knows these dates. Other than that one criticism though this is a very good documentary about an unknown photographer whose work wasn't discovered until after her death. The young man who discovered it and now has it being shown in important galleries on both coasts is someone every artist needs. He reminds me of Theo Van Gogh!

As to Vivian's being a difficult or eccentric personality, it would be almost impossible for her not to be. She was absolutely compelled to create this body of work and anything which got in the way risked getting run over. There is probably not an artist, musician, writer (or anyone else in the arts) who does not suffer from this same ""flaw.""  It is only a flaw if you don't want them to do the work. If you do want the resulting work, then these personality quirks are the price of that. A much nicer, more considerate, less demanding person will probably slack off getting the work done.

I also found it interesting about why the museums are turning her work down. Being such purists, because Vivian ""only"" took the photographs but did not make the prints herself in a dark room, they feel she doesn't count. It reminds me of their initial opposition to outsider art. Vivian will even be considered an outsider artist in some quarters.

Anyway, I do recommend this film but putting the work into a little bit better organized time frame would have been nice.",1436400000,,1785,4.56875

6365507,3,B00JK7QU6W,"I felt the documentary was more about Maloof's search for Vivian Maier and what it entailed for him rather than making the documentary about Vivian Maier. I also felt that the portrayal of Miss Maier was flat, lacking dimensions - like an object that you photgraph  from several angles so you see it from different sides but still the picture lacks depth because you're simply not skilled enough to bring the picture to life. I've watched the BBC documentary, ""Imagine Vivian Maier"", as well and... it's better than ""Finding Vivian Maier"". The focus is clearly on Vivian Maier, there's an effort to try to see the person and the artist, what could have contributed to shape her. Alas, the BBC documentary is overshadowed by Maloof's more intense PR. Still, if you have nothing to compare it to, ""Finding Vivian Maier"" is all right.

As this documentary probes deeper into who exactly Maier was it starts to look into her character and then the focus of the documentary blurs. The woman is dead and can't defend herself so we are treated to speculation that she might have been abused while younger; some of her charges allege she treated them roughly. We see too few of the photos and hear too many lurid stories and at the end we are left frustrated. Why was she such a great photographer?

Having purchased a box of negatives in an audition, John Maloof checks through and finds some amazing historical street shots. His interest is piqued and works backwards to try to uncover just who the photographer was. The documentary is well made and interviews several people who employed Vivian Maier. She appears to have been a complex individual with a hoarding proclivity and potentially even an autistic condition. Perhaps in fact it was this that allowed her to get so close to so many of her subjects on the street and take so many candid shots with her Rolleiflex TLR.
There is no ""happy ending"" in the true sense other than to thank John Maloof for bringing her story to life by sharing some of her pieces.

6365610,5,B00JK7QU6W,"Recommend it for anyone interested in photography, a private artists world and how a human deals with their childhood wounds. When I ask why she did not publish her photos I tried to crawl into her world through this film. My conclusion is that, sharing the photos would mean someone else could judge them or her. That she did not even care as much about the printed photo as the permission she gave herself to invade the space of others with her camera. The camera gave her permission to be bold and intrusive in a way that delivered gold in the images she left the world.  Like a blues musician sings about the pain of life to deal with his own pain, I believe she used photography to deal with her own pain in the same way. Not aware of this but out of necessity. She lived for the connection she had with the captured image. Her own wounds were too deep to allow others to connect in the usual ways but she found a connection to live through the moments of photographing people and things.

As to John Maloof, great job. He had the guts to find it and bring it forward. Her time to be private is gone; now it is the property of the finder and I think he has done an outstanding job of bringing the full artiest to the world with all of her humanity.

The story was peeled off, layer by layer, like an onion skin, to render a good all around views of who this woman was or who we thought she was.  I enjoyed how the story was told: bit by bit, from generalization to more focus, bit pieces of evidence through interviews of the people who ""knew"" her, and the belongings she left behind, and how she was discovered.

It takes one great ""artist"" to discover another.  Without John Maloof's persistence in his research, Vivian's work would not have been discovered this early, and shared with the world.  But then again, I am sure if John Maloof didn't discover her, somebody else will.  An old lady died, leaving behind a treasure of photographic negatives.  Nobody knows during her lifetime, she was a simple nanny who loves to take pictures.

The documentary was very neutral, exposing Vivian Maier, not only as a gifted street photographer, but also a human being with her own share of talents and flaws.  Her compulsiveness, introvert, eccentric and mysterious personality prevented her from stepping forward as being one of the greatest photographers of her time or ours.  This documentary movie is very well made.  Bravo !!  I also enjoy hearing the interviews of her former employers and the children she once took care.  Their candid views were very comical at times, descriptive, truthful, and sad at the same time.  Most employers share the same observations about her.  Made me laughed.  I watched this documentary twice in the same week.

As a viewer, I develop a sense of compassion for her.  Her loneliness, her longing for a family, her love of children, her poverty, but her content in the simple thing that brings her joy: photography.  Aging and loneliness brought on their toll, and we see her mental health decline with her hoarding and impatience with children, those she loved the most.  I also appreciate John Maloof's efforts in bringing a voice to Vivian Maier.  Without this lucky encounter, will Vivian and her works be forever lost and forgotten?  But lucky for Vivian, this amazing young man has a talent for talent.  Am sure Vivian knew her work is beautiful - but she preferred keeping them to herself so she can enjoy doing what she did.  It's hard being an artist.  You are always met with harsh criticism.  Who needs criticism when your goal is just to enjoy it.  Who cares what they say ( If your work turns out to be crap ) - what important is to do what you love and to love what you do.  She lived her life.

This documentary shared a great deal of her best photographs, 8 mm film footage of the 70s, 80s.  It was amazing to see the 70s so colorful, so real, so ""you're there"" with her candid shots .  Thanks to her, we get to see what the world was like, especially for us, young audience, who never lived in her era.  If only she had an iPhone.",1422230400,,2924,4.61747572815534

She had a passion to take photographs and amassed an amazing number of negatives (100,000+) that somehow ended being stored away in a forgotten site and finally auctioned off to John Maloof who, god bless him, recognised what he had found and is a man on a mission to share these images with the rest of us.

The documentary Finding Vivian Maier, written and directed by John Maloof and Chralie Siskel, tells the fascinating tale of a woman who lived and died in obscurity - then, through a serendipitous fluke of fate and an undiscovered talent for photography, became well known and celebrated long after her death. So much so that they even went and made a movie about her.

The saga began when Maloof, a young historian/filmmaker, bought a box of negatives at an auction in 2007. The negatives, it turned out, belonged to a woman named Vivian Maier, born in 1926, who had spent most of her adult life taking pictures of the world around her - more than 150,000 of them to be exact. Vivian never shared her work with the people in her life, even though the images were of a quality to rival some of the worlds greatest and most famous photographers. Intrigued by what he had unearthed - the treasure trove included many 8 MM films as well - Maloof decided to re-create the life of this talented woman by seeking out those who knew her and using their knowledge of her to help piece it all together. It seems that Vivian spent her life as a nanny to the well-off families of Chicago; in fact, she was hired by no less a figure than Phil Donahue to look after his four children for a short time.

Through the movie, there emerges a portrait of an eccentric, intensely private woman, who never married and was seemingly devoid of family, who kept her personal background a secret, frequently used pseudonyms, affected a phony French accent (despite the fact that she was a native New Yorker), voiced strong opinions on politics and society, and traveled the world with only a camera for a companion, continually documenting, through both stills and film, the world as she and few others saw it.

One of the interviewees describes Vivians work as reflecting the bizarreness of life, the incongruencies of life, and the unappealing-ness of human beings. Yet, what comes through most vividly in her work is its humanity, her ability to capture the essence of people from all ages and walks of life in a single moment in time.

However, if you thought Finding Vivian Maier would turn out to be one of those unalloyed feel good movie experiences, youd be sadly mistaken. For not everything we learn about the woman behind the camera is uplifting, charming and inspiring. In fact, the movie takes a decidedly dark turn in the latter half, as a number of the children she oversaw recount some of the abuse - both physical and emotional - they suffered at her hands.

She is described by some who knew her as damaged and past eccentric, riddled with mental illness, paranoia, and a compulsion for hoarding.

She became more and more isolated from the world as she entered old age, reduced to dumpster-diving for food. and becoming increasingly reliant on the kindness of strangers before death finally came for her in 2009.

Yet, now her work adorns the walls of many an art gallery the world over, as ever-increasing legions of admirers come to appreciate her talent.

For all its speculation, the movie demonstrates at least a certain amount of self-awareness by admitting that it may be a trifle unfair to judge a person and the life she led based entirely on how others saw and felt about her, without the person being given a chance to clarify or defend herself.

In a way, Vivian Maier is a stand-in for all the nameless, faceless people who surround us unnoticed, the vast majority of people who live their lives in relative obscurity and leave little real mark on the world after they're gone. Except, thanks to the fickle finger of fate and her own unique talent, Vivian did leave a mark, one that will be admired and appreciated for generations to come.",1420848000,3,3755,4.684370257966616

6365633,5,B00JK7QU6W,"This is an indie (limited budget) film, and it is a look at the photographic artwork and what biography the author was able to sleuth out about Vivian Maier, the photographer.  This is reminiscent of a similar documentary about a previously unknown artist, In the Realms of the Unread-the Mystery of Henry Darger.  I very much enjoyed the latter film.  I didn't know whether or not Id enjoy this one, but I find art and artists more approachable via film, in which people who know a lot more than I do about technique, historical trends etc. can explain to me what the heck Im looking at and what makes it good.  When I realized most of her photos were done in black & white, I grew much more pessimistic (I am the opposite of the purist who feels black & white photos are more artisticI view them as a product of technological limitations of an earlier period of time and prefer color, ever since it became available).
Having watched the DVD I came away very impressed: impressed with the artistry of her photography (particularly with cameras nobody uses today), impressed with the immensity of her unknown work, which is estimated at around 150,000 photographs (some of them, yes, even in color) as well as some motion-video recordings and audio recordings which she saved.  Impressed with the immense privacy of the person and total lack of realization of what they had produced until after their passing, just as with Dargers artwork.  Impressed with the amount of work John Maloof did, tracing where she had lived, finding quite a few people who remembered her, getting them to share their stories in his documentary.  And impressed that, like Darger, she apparently struggled with untreated mental disorder throughout her life.

One difference between her and Darger is that her photography is technically much more sophisticated than Dargers paintings and drawings.  While Dargers style (self-taught) is somewhat reminiscent of Grandma Moses or even cartoon art in its relative absence of perspective, Maiers photographs, or at least a sampling of her better ones, seem as sophisticated as any others Ive seen in museums.

Of course they worked with very different media, but its interesting that I mention Grandma Moses.  While she, like Darger, painted and sketched, the way she supported herself was by working as a housekeeper, much like Vivian Maier supporting herself for decades working as a nanny for children, in families who needed and could afford that kind of help.

The discovery of Dargers enormous production of writing and drawings posthumously has brought him a considerable degree of appreciation.  The discovery of Maiers photographs already seems to be bringing her at least as much posthumous success, as there have been exhibitions of them in galleries in the US and even in Europe.  The sheer volume of undeveloped negatives suggests it will be many years before all of it can be fully sorted out, and unlikely that the public will ever view more than a small slice of it, perhaps in a bound art book some day.  This was a fascinating story of a true photographic artist.  At 90 minutes length, it was very easy to watch in a single sitting, and I thought the balance between display of her work and discussion of her life was very well done.  Maloof seems to have been the perfect person to have stumbled onto boxes of her undeveloped negatives at an auction, realized the importance of what he had found, and brought her to the attention of the rest of the world.

6365662,5,B00JK7QU6W,"This video is an excellent example of why pickers can often ""hit the jackpot."" An unmarked box contained the lifelong evidence of the genius of Vivian Maier as a photographer is found. How one person could be so prolific with such incredible photographs, yet so horrible with her 8mm movies (shown as an ""extra"") is a mystery in itself. It also digs deeper into Vivian Maier's personality and comes up with some remarkably strange discoveries. True photographic historians, especially anyone into black and white photography like me, will not be sorry they purchased this video.",1414454400,,578,5.094736842105263
6365663,5,B00JK7QU6W,"Well, not quite. Vivian Maier was a nanny (and I assume a good housekeeper and cook) mostly for families who lived in the Chicago suburbs. She was a very, very private person who had a passion for taking photos, especially street scenes around Chicago and some of these pictures were quite outstanding - and that's it. The problem for the art establishment and probably a lot of the public is that Ms Maier doesn't fit into the preconceived notions of a photographer. She seems not to have had any creative training or worked professionally as a photographer, had no book published, no exhibitions, no freelance commissions yet after her death a whole treasure trove of her wonderful creative work is slowly being revealed.

I enjoyed this documentary made by John Maloof (who seems to have acquired the largest amount of her work) and Charlie Siskel and their credible attempt to piece the life of Maier together. Fortunately it avoids the pitfalls of contemporary documentaries with its quick editing of close-up talking heads, inappropriate background music and non-relevant film clips to link sequences together. There are plenty of people talking here, the children, now adults, who she looked after, photographers Joel Meyerowitz and Mary Ellen Mark, neighbors who knew her when she was old but they are all left to tell their stories straight to the camera.

Many of her photos are shown in the film and of course they are wonderful to look at but her work really can't be considered strong enough to change any notions of the meaning of photography. Her street scenes have brilliant framing and subject matter but so did the work of several dozen camera folk of the New York School and the Photo League plus their work has an added significance because of its strong emotional punch.  Maier's work is much more straight reportage which is why I like it so much.

The film is a worthwhile introduction to an intriguing photographer who existed outside the conventional photographic world.",1414368000,3,1995,4.946268656716418

I wish I had known her.  Her story is fascinating and captivating.  I feel she must have been scared - we will never know why - to share her pictures with the world.

6365682,2,B00JK7QU6W,"As an artist, I could appreciate her work at the beginning of the movie. As the film progressed and her mental illness became more apparent I became less and less enamored.

She took a child to the Chicago Stockyards. I had to have the person watching the film with me tell me when that part was over as I had run out of the room. Maier obsessed about murders, abused children in her care, refused to give a pawn shop owner her name or phone number, went under numerous aliases, and hoarded everything from newspapers to ephemera on a level that is unimaginable and bizarre beyond comprehension.

Her meanness and craziness turned me off. Picasso once said that he survived on the cupidity of people. The same thing will now come into play as people fall all over each other to possess the work of a really unlikeable person simply because her life story is so far out there.

Also, I found it disturbing that she took photos secretly and often against people's will and without consent. Too nutty for me.",1412208000,3,1005,4.541436464088398

6365721,5,B00JK7QU6W,"I have been fascinated with the story of Vivian Maier since I first came across the post in a flickr group related to Street Photography in 2009:

https://www.flickr.com/groups/onthestreet/discuss/72157622552378986/

John Maloof found the treasure trove of Vivian's life work in 2007 - 2 storage lockers with a collection of thousands of rolls of never developed film - mostly black and white images, as well as 8mm home movies, cassettes and memorabilia from her life. She had been a loner and a hoarder, and the contents of the storage lockers were going to be destroyed if Maloof hadn't acquired them at auction. It is an act of true serendipity that the collection fell into the hands of such a curious person who appreciated what he had found - it could just have easily all gone into a dumpster! The acquisition of this collection inspired Maloof to learn more about photography, practice the art of street photography himself and start the long and arduous process of developing the film and finding who Vivian Maier was.

Because Vivian was such a hoarder, there were records, receipts, old mail, etc. that allowed Maloof to find many of the families for which she had worked as a nanny. She was indeed a loner and an eccentric and most felt that she had suffered some pivotal event in her past that made her unable to form close and lasting relationships; she never married nor had children and had no living relatives. She died alone, without ever having revealed to the world her astonishing collection of wonderful street photography images; in fact, she had developed so few of them that she may not have not known how truly great her work was.

Maloof weaves the story with many images, movie clips, audio clips and time lapse photography of the collection of objects she left behind. The original music that accompanies many of the scenes provides an interesting accompaniment, though sometimes it seems to be mismatched with the scenes and tone of the images. He also includes extensive interviews with some of the families she worked with. No one ever felt that they had truly known her; she worked for them, she took the children on outings on which the camera was always hanging around her neck, but beyond that she kept to herself. Basically she pursued her passion of street photography in spite of having to look after the children, and sometimes even took them into seamy and less than ideal neighborhoods. The children were also frequently her photographic subjects.

The most arresting part of the documentary was the inclusion of many images, carefully selected from the nearly 100,000  available to Maloof. Maier's ability to capture the defining moment was indisputable. Framing, focus, and exposure were spot on - something that modern photographers aspire to achieve with much advanced technology. She was no ""point and shoot"" amateur; she mastered a series of Rolleiflex cameras.

The documentary has whet my appetite to see even more of Maier's images - I hope that her art will be displayed in a nearby gallery some time soon !

Ultimately, however, in spite of the title ""Finding Vivian Maier"", I'm not sure she could be found. And yet, there are many self portraits in her collection. Did she hope that she would eventually have the courage to display her collection and that people could know her better? Did she have the life she wished for? Or did she think that someone would discover her images after she was gone? Her motivations remain a mystery. Clearly her posthumous fame would not have been welcome during her life.",1408492800,5,3561,4.893864013266998

6365736,5,B00JK7QU6W,"Very highly recommended.  discoveries like this only come around once in lifetime.  Vivian Maier, is likely to remain a topic of intense  in the art world for the foreseeable future - both for the impenetrable mystery of her identity and life and because of her prodigious body of work and her substantial talent.  I first became aware of Vivian Maier at the initial exhibition of a fraction of her work at the Chicago Cultural Center.  This exhibition is documented in the film.  My first impression was how closely she had studied the great masters of street photography, Cartier-Bresson, WeeGee, Diane Arbus and others.  As more of  her work was made public it became clear that the fruits of that study were a highly personal and absorbing vision coupled with amazing dexterity and technique.  It would be tempting to say that she was the last great street photographer because she worked with the classic tools, a Rolliflex and a Leica IIIf.  But there are so many men and women crowding that field today that American Photo Magazine has proclaimed 2013 the year of street photography.  Never the less, most of the new comers use modern digital equipment, and have masters like Vivian Maier to study.  For she has already entered the ranks of the legends of Photography.  It is sad that she has only been reveled to the public after her death.  It is also a great good fortune that due to her prodigious work effort, we will be seeing ""new"" Vivian Maier photographs for a very long time to come.

6365751,4,B00JK7QU6W,"First off, you have to see this documentary if you're into outsider artist or photography or art in general OR you just love a great story. My only sort of compaint is that I wish there was a better ""timeline"" of events in her life and work. I wish they would have explored how her photographs changed through the years. Did they get better, did you see her developing an interest of photographing newspapers...or was her fascination with newspapers evident from the begining? In what order did she take care of the various children. It seems to me that she was eccentric and slipped into more of a 'madness'. But I wonder if I am accurate in saying that.
So overall I wish her eccentricities/madness were explored in a timeline fashion that coincided with her work.
But as I said...this is nitpicking...this documentary is a MUST SEE!",1407024000,18,835,4.687074829931973
6365752,3,B00JK7QU6W,"An intriguing story, but this film does not probe the depth of Maier's mysterious background as well as the BBC film The Vivian Maier Mystery.

6365754,5,B00JK7QU6W,"I enjoyed this film thoroughly. I only wish that I could have been Vivian Maier's friend while she was alive, especially in her final years. It seems she needed a friend.

Her contribution to the art of photography is for me enthralling. I especially love her self portraits.

I don't think anyone could have handpicked a better person to have discovered her art. I'm not sure if anyone else on earth would have so devotedly and painstakingly sought out and preserved her art and her history. I find the whole story amazing.

The criticisms of Vivian are very hard for me to believe or digest. It's easy to find all the faults of someone who cannot defend herself. I'm sure she had faults, as we all do, but I think we can be a little more merciful considering she seemingly had no one who loved her, and she had so little in life. One man called her a ""spinster."" What a cruel and insensitive barb. I find that people who use such terms have very little sensitivity for humanity.

My only critique of the film itself is that at times the music was incredibly loud and harsh to my ears. But, otherwise, I love the film. It's a masterpiece, as was the life of Vivian Maier.",1406764800,31,1172,4.412037037037037

8651676,5,B00JK7QU6W,"An unabashed look at one of America's most eccentric artists.

Vivian Maier went everywhere with her Rolliflex strapped around her neck, but thousands of negatives never saw the light.

That this eccentric woman, and packrat, was acknowledged as one of America's pre-eminent street photographers is widely known amongst photographers and gallery owners.  What is lesser known is her loneliness and upbringing replete with many phobias.

She worked as a nanny, taking pictures while the children played, and even managed to fit in a trip around the world, showing us all that she was not as poor as she said she was, and documenting her travels throughout the world with thousand upon thousands of shots.

Now, she is the property of John Maloof.

A documentary that tells us a little about one incredibly creative person.

Five stars.  Rick says DEFINITELY cjeck this one out.

P.S.  The portraits at the end?  Well director Maloof did a good thing by saving the best for last.",1510099200,,977,4.969135802469136
