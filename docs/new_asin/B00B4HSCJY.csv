5555101,5,B00B4HSCJY,I think this DVD is good for people just getting into ukulele.  A lot of ukulele DVDs look like they were recorded in a basement and just use a single camera so you can't see the fingering of the chords.  But this DVD is much better quality and has closeups of the chords from an angle that lets you see what's really going on.,1359504000,16,327,4.09375
5555102,5,B00B4HSCJY,Excellent for the beginner. Explains everything you need to get started playing.,1453248000,2,80,5.75

5555104,5,B00B4HSCJY,"Day 5 learning how to play the Uke, and I sound decent! Actually, since day one! And this isn't me bragging... Thnx Kalani! U rock!",1437609600,6,131,4.28
5555105,5,B00B4HSCJY,This is by far the best introduction to a musical instrument I have ever seen.  Kalani describes in detail everything.  At the same time he treats you as a beginner and not one with some musical background.  I have tried everything from guitar to harmonica and they all come to a point where  I feel lost.  At 68 I have ADD and give up easily.  Play Ukulele kept me interested all the way through.,1422057600,7,397,4.297297297297297
5555106,5,B00B4HSCJY,Wonderful. Worth the investment!,1418342400,5,32,7.25
5555107,5,B00B4HSCJY,Really cool dvd I just really got into playing my ukulele that I've owned and this has been a great DVD to help me figure out where I was screwing up with what I've been doing it's not gonna make you sound like a pro but it does definitely help you get started on the right path for it.,1410998400,7,286,3.864406779661017
5555108,5,B00B4HSCJY,"Kalani has a very direct and easy style to follow.  In 90 minutes, he provides a summary of basic techniques and chords.  He throws in a little music theory as well.  Excellent for beginners.",1388534400,8,191,4.5588235294117645
5555109,5,B00B4HSCJY,Kalani is an excellent teacher and musician.  He takes you step by step as you learn to play the ukelele.,1364947200,9,105,4.25
5555110,5,B00B4HSCJY,"I really like this. The way Kalani teaches is the natural way my beginning fingers want to move to make music. Nothing too complicated. I just move one or two fingers up and down on the strings without moving my hand around the neck of the uke and I can play three cords right away. That's all it takes to play lots of songs. For a non-musician like me this is perfect. I really like Kalani's teaching area too. There is no cluttered background to distract from what he is showing. It's easy to concentrate on what he's teaching and it's easy to follow along. He has good close-ups where the fingers go on the uke and diagrams for finger placement that are easy to understand, unlike regular sheet music. Who knows? I might become a musician, quit my job, grab my uke and head to Waikiki!!

5555111,5,B00B4HSCJY,"Can't get any better than this!  A great investment for the young, adult and seniors.  Kalani's instructions are precise and with clarity.  His voice relates to his patience, kindness and care.  The time spent showing parts of the ukulele is fantastic.  Equally important are the instructions he displays on tuning, chord placements, strumming, following each step and even more.  This DVD is great for individuals ~ ~ and also,for the many ukulele instructors that I think should recommend this DVD to their students.  They will benefit by experiencing this extra boost ~ a private lesson in their home with this DVD that is easy to follow.  Sooooo, anyone who desire to play the ukulele, get this DVD now !  You can't go wrong with this one!!!",1359590400,13,745,4.849206349206349
8562345,5,B00B4HSCJY,"A FIVE STAR rating indeed. An extremely excellent, well put together instructional Ukulele DVD.  I don't agree to the individual who falsely put
a 1-star rating  and wrote a false comment. I am putting a 5-star because this is my honest and sincere comment to this product. I highly recommend this and  the instruction by Kalani , he makes it fun!",1522022400,,347,4.655737704918033
8562346,5,B00B4HSCJY,Kalani knows how to break down the learning process and give information in digestible chunks.  The dvd is well laid out in sequence and navigation.  This product has helped myself to continue my ukulele playing while also being used in late elementary mus C classes.  The presentation is suitable for grades 3-12 and adult learners as well.  Highly recommended!,1521936000,,362,5.084745762711864

8562348,5,B00B4HSCJY,A little bit dated but it does the job in at least gives you a Headstart to learning the UKE on your own without paying for expensive lessons.,1516233600,,142,4.107142857142857

8562351,3,B00B4HSCJY,Too elementary for what I was looking for. I may work ok for someone who doesn't already know how to read music.,1482969600,,112,4.136363636363637
