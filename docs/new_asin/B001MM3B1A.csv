3698473,3,B001MM3B1A,"Why is it that so many movie collections like this are NOT among the best films of some actor, yet packaged as though they were? Of the four on here, only ""Jailhouse Rock"" is really among his best films, although ""It Happened At the World's Fair"" is a decent movie too but not one of his best. Both of those films have quite good songs in them, with the songs in ""Jailhouse Rock"" being rock oriented while those in ""It Happened......World's Fair"" are more ballad and pop oriented. ""Charro"" often gets very negative reviews, but even though it's not a great production I find it watchable. It's very unusual in that Elvis only sings the title song and no more. At least ""Charro"" and ""Stay Away, Joe"" from the late-60s are a departure from the stale ""beach movie"" types of films Elvis was stuck in by the mid-60s, yet ""Stay Away, Joe"" is VERY strange and several characters in it are insulting stereotypes of Native Americans. So, if you don't have many of Elvis's movies, start with his best:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Creole/dp/6305837821/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Creole</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-in-the-Country/dp/B000068TQ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild in the Country</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Follow-That-Dream/dp/B0001AW0YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Follow That Dream</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jailhouse-Rock-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B000QUUD5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jailhouse Rock (Deluxe Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loving-You/dp/B00007L4KP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loving You</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flaming-Star/dp/B000E8N8QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flaming Star</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speedway/dp/B000R3PDIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speedway</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viva-Las-Vegas-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B000QUUD56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viva Las Vegas (Deluxe Edition)</a>.

3698505,5,B001MM3B1A,"Not only was Elvis a singer that transformed American popular culture, but he was far more talented than most people realize. I am sure that the early T.V. exposure he received was the boost that propelled his career the most but the acting skills exhibited in many of these movies proves his versatility. The wide range of roles would be a stretch for any great actor to pull off, and Elvis did that. He nailed a bunch of awesome performances and I have been enjoying this collection very much. The quality of the video is as good as are the soundtracks and real Elvis fans will be singing along with the King. I think ""Charro"" is a fantastic movie that stands the ""Test of Time"" quite well. It is generally the director who has either a clear vision, great actors and a well-written screenplay or a combination of those and with skill, create a memorable movie. Charro has all in abundance. Elvis was perfect in this. I am sure that any film school class that goes over this will agree with me. All four are great of course and ""Stay Away Joe"" is also a totally great effort with a timeless performance by Burgess Meredith as ""Joe's"" dad.",1442361600,3,1140,4.485576923076923

I liked Buddy Holly and did not like the Beatles. But, I like Elvis songs so I enjoy his movies. I am not at all critical because he could not act. John Wayne could not act and neither could Robert Redford. We have a tendency to like what we are supposed to like. Nobody can say that Denzel Washington is a bad actor. I say he is mediocre at best. Now Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner can act. So I rate this Elvis 4 pack at 5 stars because I enjoyed all 4 movies and watched them all the way through. However, it took me two nights on one of them.

Jailhouse Rock is a classic, and Charro! is a good old-fashioned western and Elvis does some very good acting although the Elvis fans will miss his singing in it, 'cause he doesn't.(Other than the Title Song). It Happened at the World's Fair is one of his many throw away scripts that he made so many of, but I enjoy it.

Now that I'm not a teenager, I need more substance from a movie.  However Jailhouse Rock and Charro were not in the general mold of most Elvis movies.  Both were great, and to me Charro is his best ever.  It made me think there was something to him besides a handsome face and a wonderful voice.

Loved his look and his acting...It is my favorite Elvis movie with Kid Galahad coming in number 2... Jailhouse Rock is a classic and a great movie, but how well you like it will depend on your age..Great movie, but no where near my favorite....Some Elvis fans are drawn to his fluff and nonsense beach movie roles, and others to his character roles.  It happened at the Worlds Fair, a movie worth watching..Stay Away Joe is not one you will enjoy if you are looking for a movie with substance or political correctness..Some beautiful scenery from Sedona, Arizona but not much else..Typical 60's portrayal of the Native Americans and Elvis is playing one...",1365206400,2,982,4.742690058479532

3698583,3,B001MM3B1A,"With the exception of the classic Jailhouse Rock, we have what might be called Elvis' ""lost"" movies, meaning one quality Hollywood Musical which has been overlooked and two which deserve the overlooking.

JAILHOUSE ROCK (**** 1/2*) is the 1957 must-see: Elvis' acting is a quantum leap forward from his second movie (first starring role in Loving You); the script is excellent and so is the music. We have a serious, credible drama (outside the ""rock and Roll movie"" genre) with songs. No breaking into a song, a la Bing Crosby, 1935.

IT HAPPENED AT THE WORLD'S FAIR (*** 1/2*) along with Viva Las Vegas, a solid movie actually filmed on location, which has survived decades of opprobium from critics and fans who obviously walked away after the first 3 songs. I purchased this CD set for this movie and my newfound interest in Elvis ""movie versions"" of the soundtrack album. Fans, if you love Elvis' voice, then dig it on ""Take Me To The Fair"". Another example of what the engineers could do in drowning out his great closing long notes. There are some outstanding scenes with the child actress - she is excellent. There's no cloying sentiment - the Director was able to evoke real sympathy for the orphaned child, suddenly finding herself in the ""adult"" world of gambling, booze, and struggle. A very progressive little piece of film history.
Elvis really kicks up his heels here, literally in two of the best fight scenes I've ever seen - too bad someone decided to (unnecessarily) speed up the frames.
I daresay that Elvis is every bit as good in this light flick as he was in the haevy Western drama, Flaming Star. Art Direction is fine, so is the lighting, as Elvis never looked greater.
What stops me ftrom issuing a ***** is that the film has
2-3 too many songs and it does sag in the middle.

STAY AWAY, JOE (**) Here's a marginal ** only in deference to the decision to bring Elvis ""up to date"" as an actor...getting away from malibu Beach and placing him out in Sedona, arizona. Good Presley performance and terrific songs wasted (I know about ""Dominic, The Impotent Bull""). It's been widely and accurately observed that the frivolous stereotyping of Native Americans depiction is a solid reason to....click back to Jailhouse Rock.

CHARRO (*) Sorry, fans, this is an awful movie. Elvis is very unconvincing as  a former gang member who went straight only to be confronted by said aggeregate. The situation of a ""pacifist"" Sheriff, willing to let his town go down for the sake of Peace, is poorly realized. The well-known backstory is that the Director was told to keep things nice and light - unlike the original idea which would have Presley getting down and dirty. Gotta say it - this one *needed* some silly songs!",1296604800,3,2730,4.714884696016772
