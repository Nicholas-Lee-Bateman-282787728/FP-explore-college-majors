8180079,5,B000NOKAGW,Reason bought this movie was because I've seen it  before and fell in love with it so much .............had to buy it!!!!,1445126400,,121,4.5
8180080,2,B000NOKAGW,"I am disappointed because it is a copy of the movie, not the actual movie.",1440288000,,74,4.0
8180081,1,B000NOKAGW,"This version is a Jap copy - don't buy it.  Not sure how this is being sold by Amazon but be sure to get the regular copy.  I had an original that was stolen and so I thought I wouldn't care that this was an import - just stick the new disc in the old case.  But the video is horrible quality and the formatting does not look right (big black lines at the top and bottom).

As for the movie itself, it is 5 stars.  Liv Tyler is captivating and the story is sweet.  Every now and then comes a gem ,and this is one.",1440201600,,513,3.792452830188679
8180082,5,B000NOKAGW,Love it. It's my all time favorite movie.,1428019200,,41,4.25
8180083,1,B000NOKAGW,This should be be sold by this maker anymore. This is so bad that it looks like a bootleg version... all it's missing is the backs of people's heads in the seats in front of the guy filming. It's almost like someone was running these off at home on a pc and selling bad copies. The back of the jacket is mostly in Japanese...not sure why. Obviously that has nothing to do with how well the movie worked...just thought it was odd. Got a refund...it's junk.,1422748800,2,455,4.3023255813953485
8180084,4,B000NOKAGW,"Great film but the quality of the DVD was abysmal- poor sound and visual quality, which made it barely watchable.",1421020800,,113,4.7
8180085,4,B000NOKAGW,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Once upon a time, I owned the VHS on which there were English subtitles of the non-English dialog. Many languages are spoken in the movie. When the first release on DVD came out, I snapped it up. The problem was that the subtitles were screwed up. There were only subtitles for the English. So I grabbed this odd foreign release to give it a try. It's better, but not great. The English subtitles when on subtitle everything, English or not, and I think who ever created them is not a native English speaker. They're a little weird. Sometimes they appear at the wrong time. But that said, at least you get subtitles for the non-English dialog, which is better than not at all. Oh, and I should mention that the video quality is a little low. Almost like it was ported over from the old VHS or something.",1420329600,,850,4.386075949367089
