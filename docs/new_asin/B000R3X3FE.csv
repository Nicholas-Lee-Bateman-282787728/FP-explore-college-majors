I Love his show ""Life is worth living""

his great wisdom and Christian Faith!

problem with the ""Bottle"", Watch this

8198762,4,B000R3X3FE,"Bishop Fulton Sheen is recorded in three separate lectures (1.5 hours total run time) he presented for television on the causes and cures for alcoholism.  The lectures were recorded in the late '50's and early '60's.

I found them to be inspiring- especially in that Sheen addresses the spiritual aspects of the condition, and how a person needs an active spiritual life to cure the condition.  He stresses the strong willingness that is needed for the patient to be sober- a desire to be sober.  That, along with faith in God, can heal a person.

He gives personal actual stories of people he has known and relates how alcohol damaged their lives; and how their lives improved by being sober.  Finally, he shows that in order to be sober, a person has to take responsibility for their sobriety.",1311984000,8,795,4.72463768115942
