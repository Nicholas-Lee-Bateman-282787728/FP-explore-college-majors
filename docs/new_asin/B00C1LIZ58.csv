5685762,5,B00C1LIZ58,We have waited years for a video of Special Agent OSO to come out and it finally arrived this year.....EXTREMELY HAPPY!!!,1375747200,,121,4.809523809523809
5685763,5,B00C1LIZ58,"My son loves this DVD. Oso is funny and entertaining. If your child likes Oso, I definately recommend this DVD.",1375401600,,111,4.6
5685764,5,B00C1LIZ58,Was happy to see this video collection of Oso its hard to find any episodes on tv or on demand.,1374624000,,95,3.8
5685765,5,B00C1LIZ58,"My son has non-verbal Autism....Special Agent Oso is the ONLY show he will watch and he LOVES it....LOVES....actually loves isn't even the right word. I cannot begin to describe my son's love for this show. I have stored countless hours of Oso on my DVR but for the car, I have had to resort to buying Oso on iTunes (thank God it is available on iTunes but it is very expensive) put it on a video iPod, and strap it to the back of the passenger side head rest so my son has something to watch on a super small screen. To finally have this available on DVD is so wonderful. I always wondered what would happen if something happened to our DVR and there were no Oso available if I needed it or if my son wanted to watch it. He doesn't watch TV often but when he does, this is what he wants to watch. I could not be happier this is on DVD and hopefully this is the first of many Oso DVD's to come.

As for a review of the show itself for anyone who hasn't seen it.....This show is so adorable, it is educational and isn't at all preachy. It teaches about things that children actually experience and explains what to do in a very simple, fun way that is easy for any child to understand. The characters are lovable, the adventures Oso goes on are fun, the parody of James Bond titles is hilarious. As a parent, I love everything about this show and am so glad that my son loves it too.",1369094400,19,1382,4.137546468401487
5685766,5,B00C1LIZ58,"My girls (ages 3 and 6) love Special Agent Oso and we have a ton of the episodes on our DVR, including all of the episodes from this DVD.  The show is great for its cute characters and fun problem solving. It always has a positive message and teaches kids about a variety of subjects through spy training exercises and special assignments.  It also has clever James Bond references in all of the episode titles.

This DVD contains five great double episodes. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:
1. To Grandma With Love/Gold Flower - Oso must find a lost birthday card and help plant flowers.
2. Quantam Of Sandwich/Thunder Muffin - Oso must help make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and bake some carrot muffins for a school bake sale.
3. The Man With The Golden Retriever/The Chairs Are Not Enough - Oso learns about approaching pets and he learns how to play musical chairs.
4. For Tamales With Love/Pinata Royale - Oso helps make tamales and helps get a pinata for a quinceaera.
5. License To Share/Live And Be Polite - Oso teaches about sharing and using polite words.

We use cartoon DVDs for car trips and this one is great for the rotation.  Highly Recommended!",1368576000,39,1257,4.54424778761062

5685801,1,B00C1LIZ58,"It's hard to describe the depths of my loathing of Special Agent Oso. I tolerate my children watching it because without screen time I don't know how dinner would ever get made.  Though they are starting to pick up on my issues with the show too.

My biggest gripe with the show is that Special Agent Oso is fundamentally incompetent. Every episode starts with him being assigned a task and given ONE instruction for the task. And EVERY SINGLE TIME he forgets this one simple instruction. I'm not thrilled with my children being taught that it's okay to carelessly fail to pay attention and consistently fail to perform simple tasks as directed.

Oso is also called in to help a child with an ""emergency"" every episode.  The emergencies are never the least bit emergent.  Thank you Special Agent Oso for reinforcing my children's belief that not being able to find the blue crayon is a situation that cannot wait till I am done going to the bathroom.

The music is annoying.  Oso is an idiot. The whole show is just a pile of bad messages in an irritating format.

I'm sure I could rant on and on, but I think I've said enough to make my point.",1432512000,,1144,4.492753623188406

5685868,3,B00C1LIZ58,"She watches an episode every night before bed. Finding DVDs that we can take on trips can be a real challenge. The price was good, but I was disappointed that there were only 5 episodes on the disk. We have 55 episodes on DVR, but have been unable to find more than 1 or 2 different DVDs. I was grateful to find this one, and as always, my daughter loves all of the episodes. Oso is great for my 11 month old (though she discovered him at 5 mos) because he teaches basic skills that she sees mommy do every day( like watering plants and sweeping the floor) in a fun, concise way. Oso can get anything done in ""three special steps"". She was initially attracted to his singing  advisor ""paw pilot"" , who has a pleasant face and is always smiling, something that I have had a difficult time finding in many current cartoons.",1399420800,2,821,4.296774193548387
