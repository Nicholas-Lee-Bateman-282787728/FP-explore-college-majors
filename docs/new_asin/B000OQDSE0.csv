8508309,1,B000OQDSE0,"I purchased the dvd hoping to gain some knowledge about using a bokken. What I got was a lesson in bad dvd authoring. The dvd is 50 minutes long and for the first 12-15 minutes the dvd plays fine, so you get the gripping and 8 basic stances. However, at this point the dvd begins to have pixelation problems, so the 8 cuts and transitioning are barely watchable, because the dvd begins to lag and stutter and freeze up for several seconds at a time. But the worst part was at 29 minutes the dvd starts over by itself, never covering the 8 basic forms and formalities at all! I was very disappointed with the quality of the product. From what I was able to see, Mr. Abbott presented good information, but after failing to play in three different dvd players, it was a total waste of my time",1202601600,5,789,4.302013422818792
