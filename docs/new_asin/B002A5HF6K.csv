3883424,5,B002A5HF6K,What can I say loved it back when and loved it now. Have watched it twice and enjoyed it as much as when I saw it the first time when young and still enjoy seeing the stars of my era and how seeing how they knew how to enjoy themselves. Must say brings back wonderful memories from a wonderful movie,1350172800,,299,4.0

3883426,5,B002A5HF6K,"I first saw Troy and Susan in the Movie "" Lovers Must Learn "" better know as the Rome Adventure.  This movie is so honest as the chemistry between the two is so real.  Distant Trumpet does not have the personal experience of Rome Adventure but still a very good action movie.  Difficult to see Troy dirty and dusty away from his normal on screen characterisation.  The movie is enjoyable as an action movie but the romance between Troy and Susan is not as good as Rome Adventure.  It is a different movie.",1301270400,2,505,4.387096774193548
3883427,3,B002A5HF6K,"A Distant Trumpet is a fairly good cavalry vs indians western.  It features impressive amounts of men on horseback (cavalry and indians) and beautiful scenery filmed in the deserts of Arizona.  It also features two other ""lasts.""  It is the last film directed by famed action direcor Raoul Walsh and the last major film starring Troy Donohue made for Warner Bros., the company that made him a star with ""A Summer Place"" in 1959.  (Troy would make one other film for Warners, the grade-B suspense melodrama ""My Blood Runs Cold"" in 1965.  He would not make another A-Film until his brief appearance in G-dfather Part II in 1974.)  This film co-stars Suzanne Pleshette who was briefly married to Donohue at the time.  (I think the marriage lasted about 10 months.)
It co-stars character actor James Gregory who was on a roll at the time with impressive appearances in several terrific films (""Manchurian Candidate,"" ""Captain Newman, M.D."" etc.)  The film is also loaded with Warners' contract players coming off of Warners' tv series: Diane McBain (SurfSide 6,) William Reynolds (The Gallant Men,) Larry Ward (The Dakotas,) etc.
The basic plot of the film is Troy as a cavalry lieutenant at a small, forgotten fort in the middle of the Arizona desert vs the Apaches who are performing hit and run raids and disappearing back into Mexico where the cavalry cannot follow.  There is a bit of a soap-operaish plot with Troy falling for Suzanne, the widow of his former commander and his snooty fiance from the east (McBain) coming to visit.  After the one big action scene at the end where the indians allow themselves to be used for target practice, continuously riding into the bullets of the well-hidden soldiers, Troy talks them into surrendering, only to be stabbed in the back by the U.S. government which attempts to ship them to Florida.  Troy speaks up gallantly for his former enemies and everyone winds up living happily ever after.
As stated, this is a large scale western but not a great one.  There is too little action until the last third of the film.  The scenery is beautiful however, the music by Max Steiner is very good and I have seen many worse westerns.  The only extra is a trailer with the director, Walsh, speaking about what a great film this is and how happy he was to make it and what a great job Troy did in it. Sadly the film was neither a critical or commercial success, vanishing quickly out of theaters and is basically forgotten today.  This dvd was produced by the [...].  It is not available in stores.  I purchased it from them and to be honest paid less than Amazon is charging here.  The picture quality and the color are very nice.  I've watched it on 2 blu-ray machines.  On my older and cheaper machine, the picture freezes about every 10, 15 minutes.  I am then forced to forward it and is continues until the next freeze-up.  On my newer, more expensive blu-ray, it plays perfectly.  If you are going to purchase it, you should be made aware of this.",1276387200,13,2989,4.662213740458015

3883429,1,B002A5HF6K,"I had been looking for this video for years and I finally found it.  I ordered it, never got it and got a refund on my visa instead.  This was a major disappointment to me and kind of sours me on future orders.  If it is still possible, I would very much like to get this movie, it's one of my all time favorites.",1262044800,2,313,3.859375
3883430,5,B002A5HF6K,"This movie was filmed in the Gallup, New Mexico area back in the early 1960's. It was really a low budget, and poor rendition of Paul Horgan's book by the same name. As a result, it never became popular, or ""classic"" enough to be offered through video catalogs.
 Since I am one of the cavalrymen, I have always wanted to get a copy of the film. For years, everywhere I tried to find a copy, either video or DVD, I was unsuccessful.
 That is until Amazon.com is now providing copies of films through its Archive Collection.
 This is a wonderful new service, and I hope collectors of old movies take full advantage of it!
 Also, it took only a week, or so, for delivery of my order, and I can, after all these years, watch myself charging over the hills against the Apaches!

3883431,5,B002A5HF6K,"A Distant Trumpet sounds the call to action for a stirring, thunder-hooved tale of the West. Troy Donahue leads the charge as Lt Matt Hazard, an idalistic West Point graduate plunged into the last of the US Cavalry's Great Indian Wars. Assigned to Fort Delivery, Arizona, Hazard is tested in love, war and politics. He's engaged to one woman (Diane McBain) but falling for another (Suzanne Pleshette). His courage is proven during the fierce guerrilla campaign waged by Chiricahua Apaches and their chief, War Eagle. And he's first to stand up for what's right when the US violates its postwar pact with the Chiricahuas.
The movie was shot in beautiful technicolor and widescreen, with good performances, and music by Max Steiner. The story and action is kept moving well by great director Raoul walsh. Watch the excellent background of the Southwest's Red Rocks and the spectacular quarter-mile wide Grand falls. This archive collection DVD by Warner has excellent sound and picture quality.
Watch and ENJOY.",1253318400,36,1009,5.121212121212121
3883432,5,B002A5HF6K,"I was a young boy back in the seventies when i first saw this movie in a theater and ever since i was hooked completely to western movies especially ones with Indians involved. And this one has A HUGE Indian involment! I remember watching that movie at 10 am shows and rushing out of the theater to play that movie with my friends frame by frame, step by step following the story. Neighbour park was our Arizona :) And when my parents bought me a plume, spear and a rifle i instantly took the role of War Eagle! Although i never surrender to my friends who played on the side of cavalry :)
I have been looking for this movie for ages but thanks to foresight mind of someone at Warner Bross it is finally available through Warner Bross Archive.
If you want old fashioned style of western 'cavalry meets Indians' movie there isn't better than this one!
Movie is still fresh and entertaining. I was a bit afraid that quality of picture would be questionable but i can tell you that it looks perfect!
This is a highly recommended movie!!!!
And if i my recommend to those who already love this kind of movies, check out Winnetou. Karl May wrote fantastic books about Wild West and in the sixties most of those books where filmed.",1249430400,16,1224,4.420353982300885

3883434,5,B002A5HF6K,This is one of my favorite movies. I was so glad that it came on DVD as I first saw it on TV.  I have always loved Troy Donahue and Susanne Pheshette as a couple in TV.  It is like watching the beach movie couple Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Then again I love a good clean romantic movie. I like the idea of feeling the couple sharing the love they have but not showing it by displaying nude bodies. There is something to be said about the movies of the yester year era.,1403222400,2,479,4.085106382978723
3883435,5,B002A5HF6K,"This film was directed by the talented Mr. Raoul Walsh.  This was, infact, his final film.  The book is too slow to make an interesting screen play that is any more than a passing nod to the novel; but Troy Donahue gives his finest performance in this action packed story of a small Arizona fort in the 1880's.  Suzanne Pleshet is professional but seems disinterested in the work.  She shines in comparison to the prim blond fiance.  But for the scernery and the action scenes this one is above the bar.  I highly recomend it.",1395014400,2,526,4.484210526315789
3883436,5,B002A5HF6K,"This old style Western Calvary movie starring Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette, is in my opinion one of the best western pictures of that time period with great romantic chemistry from Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette, as well as filled with tons of action sequences throughout the movie.

3883438,5,B002A5HF6K,A Distant Trumpet was lots of entertainment when I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre. Troy Donahue co-starred with Suzanne Pleshette and Diane McBain. It becomes a  tale of how the indians are treated by the Army.,1374451200,,221,4.525
3883439,1,B002A5HF6K,"I purchased this based on a number of glowing reviews, and watched it all the way to the end -- mostly from a sense of morbid curiosity. I understand that we often remember a film from our youth more fondly than it deserves, but this . . . The Max Steiner theme song, which plays whenever there are cavalry doing something, is annoying. The acting is terrible, particularly Troy Donahue, who is sometimes embarrassing to watch. This is Raoul Walsh's last film as a director, and I can't see much evidence of him even having shown up for the shoot. The plot is mostly a string of clichs  and the specific incidents -- like the travelling bordello, the repeated Indian escapes into Mexico, the brave act of defiance at the end by the hero and his mentor to save their former enemies from deportation to Florida -- are stupid and sophomoric.

So, let's see -- bad music, bad acting, bad directing, bad writing. The cinematography is pretty good and they clearly spared little expense in the big battle scenes. I wish the pretty landscapes and swirling battles had a film to go with them.

I actually wanted to like this film. I like old cavalry films from the 50s and 60s. Some of them are great, and some are so bad they are good. This one is just bad.",1367971200,4,1250,4.449781659388647

3883441,4,B002A5HF6K,"Loosely based on the last of the Apache campaigns (against Geronimo), and on Paul Horgan's novel of the same name, this is a rousing story of the Indian-fighting army of the Old West, centering on Matt Hazard (Troy Donahue), who arrives at the little one-troop post of Fort Delivery as a new-minted second lieutenant around 1885.  He quickly meets Kitty Mainwaring (Suzanne Pleshette), wife of the acting C.O. (William Reynolds), and despite Matt's attachment to Laura Freleif (Diane McBain), the niece of Gen. Alexander Upton Quait (James Gregory), they soon find that they are falling in love.  He also makes an enemy in tough Sgt. Kroger (Larry Ward) and institutes tightened discipline and intensive training of the soldiers.  When Gen. Quait unexpectedly arrives with plans for a campaign against a renegade Apache leader who strikes into the U.S. and then vanishes below the Border, Matt is naturally drawn into it, and later sent into Mexico to parley with the Indian, whose respect he gains.  But no sooner does he have the Apaches back into American jurisdiction than he finds that orders have gone through from above: instead of being returned to their Arizona reservation, as he promised them they would be, the Indians are to be sent to Florida--even Sgt. White Cloud, the scout who accompanied him.  Now Matt must make a choice.  He can stay on, tacitly supporting the ruination of his word; he can resign; or--with Quait's help--he can fight the decision.

Despite some inaccurate costuming (the Apaches wear plains dress), the movie manages to give a good deal of the real feel of life on a small, isolated military post and of the terrible perils of Indian warfare.  There are several good battle scenes, including Quait's campaign ""in brigade strength"" against the Apaches, an oddly appealing villain (Claude Akins as Seely Jones, hog-ranch proprietor, Indian trader, and would-be murderer), a leaven of humor, and a stirring score by Dmitri Tiomkin.",1360195200,,1967,5.068111455108359

...Visually this is a splendid film.  The score is memorable, though it sometimes is overused...  But this film was a sad one for the director to go out on.  Troy Donahue is badly miscast.  The ""Apaches"" are garbed as plains Indians (feathers and warbonnets) rather than as Apaches.  The leader of the Apaches is praised as a great guerrilla leader... who proceeds to  get a vast number of his warriors shot down in conventional combat.  As happens too often, cavalry are shown with lever action repeating Winchesters instead of single shot Springfields.
.
...Indian tribes... especially the Apache, would never accept casualties such as the Confederates did in Pickett's Charge... yet they do in this film.  Indian warriors were brave, but not given to suicidal attacks.
.
... Worst of all, a happy ending is tacked onto the end of this film that is 180 degrees out from what really happened.  All of the Chirachua were sent to Florida and left there for years... not immediately returned.  In a most dishonorable move the government took Chirachua scouts who were regularly enlisted in the United State Army... some Sgts... who had gallantly served against the hostile members of their tribe and sent them to Florida for imprisonment as well... without even bothering to discharge them.
.
...The novel ""A DISTANT TRUMPET"" tells the true story.  It was written by a splendid historian known for his detailed knowledge of the Southwest.  It is one of the best novels of its type ever written, and well worth the read.  The names have been changed, but the events are true.  The John Milius film ""Geronimo"" is much closer to the real events.
.
...Again, the visuals on this film are memorable... but there are better cavalry films out there.  ""The Glory Guys"" (written by Sam Peckinpah) while far from perfect, has a truly epic widescreen battle scene, an amazing score...and is far closer to reality.
.
...Those of you that love books should definitely read the novel, ""A DISTANT TRUMPET.""  Most libraries have a copy.

8358995,5,B002A5HF6K,I love well made westerns (this film is top quality). This one has the love interest between Troy Donohue and Suzanne Pleshette without going too overboard with it. But the film does really well with it's depiction of the raw savagery and brutality of the Indian wars. Troy Donahue is fabulous in his role as a newly minted officer. The fantastic trumpet inspired soundtrack compliments the mood of the movie superbly.,1407715200,,418,4.901408450704225
