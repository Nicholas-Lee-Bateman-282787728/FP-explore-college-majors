4129490,5,B003JDQ9PA,"STRONG & SEXY is my religion! IT TRULY WORKS take it from me, Dr. Teri Jori is my trainer & I have never known a fitness expert (& I've known several) that even comes close to Teri's unbelievable knowledge of how the human body & mind work!

4129491,5,B003JDQ9PA,Teri was very clear and went through everything very slowly so I really could understand it. I felt very motivated to continue working out with Teri's videos.,1277683200,,158,4.888888888888889
4129492,5,B003JDQ9PA,"I loved Teri's new workout video because of her honesty working with her clients and it wasn't some big overly choreographed
workout video. She really intimately worked with real people and I learned a lot about my core and what was appropriate approaches to working out. It was great for a man to see how much further I have to get back into great shape, and now I know what I need to do.",1277683200,,389,4.27027027027027
4129493,5,B003JDQ9PA,"POISE Strong and Sexy is the most awesome workout!!! I've gained strength physically and mentally with the POISE  technique. It's a technique that I can workout with and then carry it over to my daily life. Working out with POISE Strong and Sexy is improving my posture and health as well as giving me inner strength and outer  beauty. It truly is sculpting my arms, abs and legs. I feel like a new person! I defintiely recommend this DVD for everyone...FYI I also got Teri's first DVD POISE Core Training to help me to learn and digest the POISE technique at a slower pace.",1276214400,,574,4.509615384615385
8398027,1,B003JDQ9PA,"Am I missing something..?I bought this and several of her other dvd's based on all the great reviews and found them to be so dull that they seemed to drag on endlessly. I'm always hesitant to buy a DVD when I've never heard of the Instructor but when I saw nothing but 5 star reviews I didn't want to miss out. Boy was I duped-these were the most dull workouts I've ever done-right up there with Callanetics. I  48 and am an at home workout fanatic with quite an extensive DVD collection. I have so many dvd's with a similar format,yet so much more fun,such as Piloxing,Squeeze,Tracy Anderson and Suzanne Bowen's Barre dvd's. I hope that my review can save  one person from wasting money. I almost feel that the 5 star reviews are fake-how can I be the only one who felt these were terrible?They also seemed very amateur-I feel I could've made a better workout",1428710400,,860,4.471337579617835
8398028,5,B003JDQ9PA,"I love this new DVD, Poise Strong and Sexy! With Teri's clear direction, I can do these exercises using the proper technique and get the most out of my workout time. Her pacing is perfect and her attention to detail really has me working my entire body in a way that is both safe and effective. The exercises she chooses are fantastic for strengthening the muscles and sculpting the body. And she inspires us to be powerful and POISED as we live life fully and confidently.

Great DVD, Teri. Thank you!",1283212800,,502,4.516483516483516
8398029,5,B003JDQ9PA,"I rank this video as the best workout video I have seen in a long time.  Not only does it give you a terrific workout, it also shows proper technique (which is important to me).  I like the way it is divided into three parts.  Each section is a workout in itself geared for certain spot areas.  After only two weeks,I can see a difference in my body. My muscles are more toned and I feel stronger.  My husband even complimented me about how good I look.....and he usually never notices.  Thank you Dr. Jory for this terrific video.  In my opinion everyone should own a copy of it.",1278547200,,580,4.26605504587156
8398030,5,B003JDQ9PA,"Poise Strong and Sexy Workout is the ultimate combination of strength and encouragement.
I love the workout because it inspires me to go beyond my own set limits... where I get to venture to my core and come out with the juices that allows me to look and feel my best self.
You just can't beat that!!!!!
Thanks Teri
You're the best

8398031,5,B003JDQ9PA,"Teri, What an amazing video!  This is truly like having a personal trainer right there in the privacy of your own home.  Hearing your voice throughout each workout is key to perfecting the exercise.  All the little corrections you say and show, contributes to maximizing the results.  It is so easy to forget to hold in your stomach, or keeping your shoulders back and down, or pressing the lower vertebrae down, or BREATHING!  Your soft reminder assures that the exercise is done correctly.

Once you've seen and worked out with the video, I suggest your viewer close their eyes and listen to your voice as you direct each exercise.  As you've taught me, if you can see it ""in your minds eye,"" you will have an easier time perfecting each exercise.  All the tips you demonstrate before each exercise is critical to doing it correctly and avoiding injury.

As you have taught me over the past 13 years Commitment, Concentration, and Control are the key elements in mastering these exercises.  It was an honor to be able to participate in this video.  Well done, friend!",1278115200,,1069,4.724324324324324
