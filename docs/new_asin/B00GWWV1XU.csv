6121001,1,B00GWWV1XU,"Pit Stop could have been an interesting look at repressed gay life in rural America. What starts as a character study of a divorced father who has come to terms with being gay but not being out of the closet becomes a meandering, aimless and frankly boring film. The other character is a latino man who breaks up with his younger partner. And a third character is the former wife of the first gay man who for whatever reason is featured in the film.

Nothing happens in this film. The latino man breaks up with his partner. The ex wife goes on a date with a husky coworker but before hand introduces her husky date to her ex husband who is gay. There are some boring conversations over dinner. Some people talking at local convenience store. The movie ends with the divorced gay man meeting up with the newly single latino guy. They have sex and the films end with the divorced man saying goodbye at the convenience store and telling the latino man he would kiss him if they weren't ya know - in public.

You could be just as bored without wasting your money or time on this film.",1459468800,,1080,4.3681592039801

6121036,2,B00GWWV1XU,"Okay film about two men who come from two very different points in their lives and seem to be stuck going nowhere. One of the characters is married, but to his best friend more than anything and they share a daughter. He has some failed past relationships and his wife is still in love with him. The other character is still living with his ex while still mourning the loss of another and seems to be in a state of confusion about where he should go and who he should be with. Finally at the end they both have a meaningful hookup together..and walking away it seems as though they want to be together again but the movie kinda ends there without really any more depth to it.
I would have preferred Gabe to go back to Ernesto as he was walking away and getting that kiss.. or for Ernesto to go over to where Gabe was and talk to him more. Or do something unexpected and cute like that.

The only minor niggle I have with it, is that I can't relate the title to the movie, and I think that to say on the cover that it's reminiscent of 'Big Eden' and 'Brokeback Mountain' is way too much of a stretch!

6121055,5,B00GWWV1XU,"What an exquisite film. Gentle, quiet, yet so real you forget these people are fictional. I felt like I took the journey right alongside the characters, and every character in the movie is absolutely integral to the delicate weave of the story. The last ten minutes or so are breathtaking and include a love scene like none I've seen. Erotic? Yes, quite sexy, but even more stunning in the richness of raw emotion and so very joyful. I rarely purchase films after I rent them, but this one is a lifetime keeper. However, I believe it takes a certain mindset to fully appreciate what this film offers. If you're impatient, in search of immediate gratification, action, and snappy humor, skip Pit Stop. If, however, you love the ebb and flow of subtle art films; if you like thought-provoking symbolism, real emotion and the quiet beauty of a true-to-life love story, this movie will please you as much as it did me.

And the music--so humble, moving, and perfect!",1426809600,2,962,4.726190476190476
6121056,2,B00GWWV1XU,"The two cover men get together for one night, for about 5-10 minutes of the movie before it ends.

6121057,5,B00GWWV1XU,"Really a great film.  Both main characters were genuine  and convincing.  The separate development of both characters took most of the film, which pays off in the end with palpable passion and believable affection between two people you actually become interested in.  This was  an interesting and engaging film with a natural flow.  All  of the characters were interesting and  the main  character's  other relationships really provided an idea of who they were.  This is how you make the audience care about characters and film.  Muy bueno!

General response to  the one  star  reviews:  WTF?  ""bad acting?""  ""slow?"" ""no plot?""  Crazy  comments.  No,  there  is  no Hollywood  story  arc where you know  the plot  in the first  5 minutes.  No action.  Its a  slow  pace.  But  there  are  real  characters and  the acting  is  wonderful.  Its a  slice  of  realistic  life in  a small  town.  Unless you only like  trite,  perky Hollywood  romance flicks  DO  NOT  LISTEN  TO  THE  NEGATIVE  REVIEWS.  This is one of the very few gay themed films  to warrant  a 5 star rating. And made for  under $500k.  Amazing.",1423958400,,1115,4.743169398907104

6121088,5,B00GWWV1XU,"You sometimes read reviews and think, yeah whatever. They're full of hyperbole or dripping with cynicism, so I was a bit weary when I bought this one.

I need not have worried; it IS a beautifully crafted film, with excellent performances, a storyline that is believable without being pedestrian or sentimental, and a pace that did justice to the subject and its setting.

After my first viewing I felt that this was a very honest film, dealing with the story of two gay men in a small town in Texas, trying to put their lives together against a backdrop of broken relationships and all of the baggage that goes with that, while continuing to care for and support the people in their lives. A quietly optimistic film that left me with a sense of time well spent - though at 87 minutes it it  not a long film. I have watched it again in the two months since I bought it and, if anything have enjoyed it even more.

The lead actors are wonderful and give great dignity and depth to the characters they portray. The supporting cast are excellent, and I even got into the soundtrack, and I am not a Country music fan, but it just added an extra layer of being inside that environment. The directing is superb, allowing the story to unfold with subtlety, and the characters to reveal themselves as in a really good book, a little at a time until you feel you have the full picture, and then in the final scene satisfyingly coming together to create, if not the fantasy happy ending, then at the very least an opportunity for hope and happiness. I guess that's why I liked it so much - it is about hope.",1416960000,,1597,4.403389830508474

6121091,2,B00GWWV1XU,"An eighty-minute gay movie with amateur actors should be a little dirty if it can't be interesting, a little interesting if it can't be dirty.  PIT STOP manages to be neither.  We know almost from the git-go that the two best-looking gay men in a tiny Texas town  are going to hook up with each other eventually (spoiler) after going on dates with a couple of ""duds"" (and no sex).  What transpires along the way is v-e-r-y slow paced and more than a little misleading.  The divorced gay guy is so despondent and lonely that his ex-wife ruffles his hair in probably the most moving scene in the film -- then they dance together, giving entirely the wrong message.  He takes an unimpressive date to the movies, a French film.

Sure, this flick was produced out of Austin, but nowhere in Texas (probably nowhere in America) do these three-stop-light farm towns of two to three thousand inhabitants, those that have still managed to maintain movie theaters, show foreign-language films.  Uninteresting, draggy, and occasionally weird.  The most unintentionally funny scene comes toward the end when (spoilers): the two best-looking gay guys in town finally have sex.  I guess, it was meant to LOOK like sex.  The two dudes grind together, visible from the chest up; one groans, it's over.  Look, if you want some clue as to the meaningless of small-town Texas life, see THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, which has tremendous performances, much better simulated (albeit heterosexual) sex, and a coach ""everyone knows about.""  PIT STOP taught me nothing, except that even capable and good-looking actors and competent editing and cinematography need a story to make an interesting film.

6121113,4,B00GWWV1XU,"If you are interested in what small-town life, unadorned and real, looks like from a gay perspective, then check out `Pit Stop,` a promising debut by director Wen Tan.  Unpretentious with excellent acting, `Pit Stop` succeeds where many others have failed.

Gabe (Bill Heck) and Ernesto (Marcus De Anda) both lead lives of quiet normalcy, Ernesto is`out` at work, while Gabe lives semi-closeted with his ex-wife, Shannon (Amy Seimetz) and their daughter.  Both are struggling to move on from past relationships.  For Ernesto, that means breaking with his boyfriend, Luis. Gabe, on the other hand, pines for an ex-lover.

Things are convoluted and messy with no easy outs or clean resolutions.  Past relationships linger on with all their emotional attachments.
Ernesto is especially torn.  While he strives to be a mentor to his younger lover, he hungers for something better and soon kicks Luis out.  Yet, he spends his free-time visiting an ex-boyfriend languishing in a coma.  Ernesto reads him the love-advice articles from women`s magazines.  Gabe and his ex-wife still live together. It is clear that they still care for one another very much.  While Shannon dates her boss at work, she tries to find dates for Gabe, much to his annoyance.

Gabe and Ernesto eventually find each other as the film works up to that end.  While the circumstances of their actual meeting remain vague, the film ends with the hope that theirs might just be a relationship to last.  With a nod to ``Brokeback,` `Pit Stop` artfully hints at the difficulties (still) of being openly gay in small-town America.  After lunch at a local diner, Ernesto and Gabe share a subdued moment in the parking lot.  `God, I`d kiss you if we weren`t here, ` sighs Gabe with suppressed emotion.  Ernesto acknowledges.  Then they silently leave with Ernesto watching Gabe drive off.  The scene is subdued, sad and spot-on.

Limits and how regular folks navigate them is what `Pit Stop` is all about.  Slow, dour and somewhat disappointing, this film grows on you.  It requires multiple viewings to grasp its power.  Real life is here with all its complications---those greasy, oily pit stopsand people hungry to get back on track.",1406505600,,2195,4.986225895316805

I can appreciate the slow-burning pace, and some of the character development - but overall this movie couldn't seem to make up its mind exactly what it wanted to be. Shelter is another film that deals with some of the same films in a much more in depth and satisfying way.

More  significantly, the script was oddly constructed.  The film presents these two guys in their parallel lives, not knowing each other.  But rather than construct a natural way of introducing them into each other's lives, it has them hook up near the end using computers and then very minimally suggests the outcome of their encounter.  I don't usually give this much away in a review, but it's the ending that was most unsatisfying to me and largely spoiled the film for me.

6121266,4,B00GWWV1XU,"Written and directed by the same person who wrote and directed Ciao with a somewhat similar story. In Ciao 2 hot-looking men meet as a result of one mans best friend dying. The deceased man had been internet dating an Italian man. The two meet in the States and the two begin a friendship based upon memories of their deceased friend.

In Ciao, the 2 men share a special love but just that moment in time and the audience is left to wonder if it turns into a happily ever after movie. As you can probably tell from the other reviews, many were disappointed because they feel that Pit Stop also ended too soon.

Both of these fine films can seem to be achingly slow character studies. Each of the side stories deepens the audience understanding of the main characters feelings. Each is peeled back and left raw for us to see exactly what, and who, makes them as they are, vulnerable and failures in love, yearning to be true to their own hearts.

We see Gabe (Bill Heck) visiting his ex-wife and child and afraid of being discovered while himself trying to recover from being dumped by a married ex-boyfriend. We also see his ex-wifes attempt at moving on but finding that when she drinks, old feelings return about how Gabe satisfied her sexual urges. We see how he struggles between his love for, as he says, his girls and his need to be with a man. Another character is introduced when Gabes ex-wife arranges for a teacher she knows, Les, to call Gabe. On their otherwise boring date, the 2 men begin to talk about how they both fell in love with married men and came to regret it and how Gabe is concerned with becoming older and not hip. Who among us has not felt that way?! At the end of this scene the 2 men agree to become friends.

We also see how Ernesto (Marcus DeAnda) finds himself reluctantly caring for a comatose ex-boyfriend because none of his exs other boyfriends step up to do so and Ernesto feels sorry for hisself having to do so. He eventually manages to contact his exs sister and we witness a very emotional moment for them both. At the same time Ernesto knows that he must take control of his own life and kick out his no-good bum lover-turned-roommate (how many of us have been there?!) just for the sake of moving on with his own life by refusing to be used. Later, Ernestos lover-turned-roommate calls him and Ernesto makes it clear that he does not want to see him again, but through both of their tears we know both men are hurting but know they must move on.

We can really feel for the 2 main characters as well as for some of the supporting characters as they struggle through relationships and life.

Each of the 3 bedroom scenes were very tasteful. Very heavy kissing and nothing shown below chest level. The first bedroom scene shows each of the mens faces as they simulate separate orgasms while looking into each others eyes and hold each other very close together. A very romantic and hot scene without the emphasis on sex. These are excellent actors and the supporting cast are all very good as well.

I have 1 minor and 1 major issue with this film. The audience is led to believe throughout the film that the gas station/convenience store is probably where the 2 main characters will meet. In fact, there is 1 scene in which Ernesto is filling up his SUV with gas when Gabe pulls up to the store in his truck to get his coffee. Because of this, I was surprised that when they did finally meet at the convenience store, Ernesto just looked into Gabes truck when he pulled into the parking space. There was no conversation and the next we see they are walking into Gabes minimalist apartment. Gabe then tells Ernesto that he looks just like his picture and Ernesto tells Gabe that when he saw his picture he thought he had seen him before. Granted I am a romantic but I was expecting a true chance-meeting romance because that is how the film sets us up. Evidently, it, much like Ciao, was sparked online.

The big problem is that, other than the 2 main characters are both blue-collar workers in a small Texas town and take in strays (animals and in some cases, people), what do they have in common? This, again, is where Pit Stop is like Ciao. Both give a great sense of shared love but in both cases the love is based upon people sharing their misery. How long can such a relationship last? Giving us the privilege to hear the conversation between Gabe and Ernesto at the restaurant counter may have helped but all we saw is that they were talking and laughing. Comforting one another during our grief is all good and well but can a serious relationship result?

I don't think the film fails because of this. I do not think the writer/director intended for it to be a happily-ever-after film as much as a film about people who are simply human and fall in and out of love. It just disappoints the more romantic among us.",1402012800,2,4863,4.442825112107624
6121267,3,B00GWWV1XU,"Saw this last summer and to be honest, it's just a bit too understated.  That is a rare problem for a gay film, but the characters tend to mumble their dialogue, almost trying not to be heard or else Texas will hear them and crucify them or something.  That may make it unusual, and the critics seemed to like that about it.  For regular audiences, it could be seen as boring, but it's not without some charming and tender moments.  I could see guys who like straight-acting men really identifying with it - there's no room for any queens in this picture - so if you like em butch and manly and muted, this could be the film for you.  It's like Brokeback but not on a mountain, and not with Jake and Heath.",1401840000,,706,4.2388059701492535

I would have given it 3 to 4 starts at that time, particularly because the acting was so good.

But then, I started thinking about it, and realized that I'd missed (one of) the main points of this film - all the times these guys' paths crossed in that small town before they actually met each other. So, I decided to watch it again; knowing the ending in advance. And I fell in love with it. For anyone who has lived in the Texas/Oklahoma area, the filmmaker totally nailed the kind of loneliness and isolation everyone encounters, but especially gay guys. When one of the leads says to a younger ex-boyfriend who is in the process of leaving, ""I'll be here... I'll always be here..."" we can feel it.

All of these characters are good people, with the usual range of complications that come with growing up, making choices, and trying to make the best of the life you have.

While, like everyone else, I wish we could have seen their connection flourish, that wasn't the crux of the movie. For me, the most remarkable part was that they found each other, and such a meaningful connection, at all. We got to walk a mile in their respective shoes, and that walk gave us hope that perhaps a meaningful connection awaits us as well. That's what we all want.",1397520000,,1447,4.473484848484849

6121326,3,B00GWWV1XU,"What a welcome relief! At last, we have a micro-mini budget movie with GBLT subject matter that fully succeeds in fulfilling its modest ambitions--and then some! The contrast is so striking between the honest integrity of this minor gem with the smarmy pretensions of most ""gay"" flicks hyped here, it would be easy to get carried away with the gold stars.

Kindly bear in mind that five stars are all we're allowed for all the factors that make or break any movie (and I particularly object to ghettoizing films with same-sex elements and handicapping their ratings as though the makers have some insurmountably deformity that prevents them from keeping up with the rest of the pack): everything from writing to lighting, casting to camera work, direction, editing, of course . . . then with all those agonizing decisions about locations and sets and such (otherwise known as ""art direction"" and/or ""production value""), a thousand things can and do go wrong to sabotage a movie long before you ever have time to figure out why you hate it at first sight. It could be as simple as wardrobe that fits neither the character's personality nor the actor's body, bad make-up and hair, or picking some totally wrong car solely because the price was right, as in free. Failing to get all that stuff spot-on sinks most micro-budget indies before the actors ever have an opportunity to exchange a meaningful glance, let alone open their mouths. 3 stars is good. Very good! It means quite a few people worked many long days for little (often enough zero) pay to create a space for the actors to do their job, which is make us care about the story. Remember the field is all the movies ever made, any place in the world, and more than a few with budgets in the $100s of millions with crews of 1000s laboring for years (LOTR, anyone?). The contenders likewise include brilliant directors who've honed their skills for decades and fought fiercely to film singular visions under impossible conditions. That's why we have 4 and 5 stars: to mark the brilliant achievements that break new ground and the rare work of breathtaking genius that blows us away completely.

Here, just three stars might seem like faint praise for such solid performances from a cast of unknowns who so accurately capture the textures of Nowhere, Texas, a nondescript place where the good life promised in TV commercials clearly must be happening someplace else. Particularly impressive is the portrait of a building contractor who, while admirably honest about his sexuality with his ex-wife and a model dad for his six year-old daughter, knows perfectly well that being ""out and proud"" would be economic suicide in the town where the child he loves lives, and besides which, (rightly, IMO) this man strongly believes that how he feels inside concerns the very few people close to his heart, but is otherwise absolutely nobody's business. He's an all-around decent guy, and it makes perfect sense that he might easily need an entire movie to find an equally good man. Many people search an entire lifetime.

Then what happens after that, how two fully-formed adults with all the scars and tender spots acquired from a life swimming against the current succeed in making a relationship work is another movie altogether.  It's impossible to know, but we can't help but wish for these guys that meeting turns out to be more than a much needed pit stop.

I'd be sorely tempted reach for that 4th star if the filmmaking craft were a tad more accomplished. Either it's regrettably underlit in places, or they had problems making the chroma match in post production, which of course is more than forgivable considering the budget they were working with.  Please do not forget we are (or at least I am) still talking the best motion pictures ever made, and in that company, Pit Stop definitely holds its own. The amazing thing here is a movie that compellingly tells a coherent story while giving us an unvarnished look into a corner of America one seldom sees on screen outside the sensation-seeking lens of reality--or as Mark ""Survivor"" Burnett prefers to call it, ""unscripted""--TV.

For all the people who worked on Pit Stop, congratulations!  Nice work, y'all. Thanks!  I appreciated it.  A lot.",1396310400,3,4252,4.860497237569061
6121327,5,B00GWWV1XU,"Everything you read in the reviews for this film on Amazon.com is true. If you have seen the film Nebraska you will be familiar with the background scenery of Middle America. The film seems (from the reviews) to have caught quite accurately the day to day life of the inhabitants of these non descript towns for both gays and straights. I suppose we are more familiar with straight life dramas than gay ones which have tended to be confined to LA or New York - where the camera crews and creative teams are located. They may not want to locate to Anywhere Nebraska or, as Bill Bryson would call it, Duddsville.

The acting in the film is first class. Each and every character gives a first class performance. Gabe's former wife plays the over anxious divorcee out on the town particularly well. Too well for her suitor who is overwhelmed by her. In reality nothing very dramatic happens in the film. No murders. No guns. No police chases or international conspiracies. We have the story lines of two very different men running concurrently. They don't actually meet until the last few minutes of the film but its significance is only brought home to the viewer from watching their lives unfold from the beginning. Unrequited love, unfaithful partners, former partners and unsuccessful dating attempts fill the lives of both of these men as they exist in the same town totally unaware of each other.

Their pasts are brought out slowly in conversations with other people. We know Gabe went to College and wasn't a builder all his working life. We get the backstory to the mysterious man in the coma in the Nursing Home and his family history. It is all done in a few lines but done really well.

Don't deprive yourself of the experience. Just relax and let it just take you over. You may find you have a lot in common with the characters in the film. Thankfully these sort of low key, low budget films have not faltered on low quality. See The Falls and you will know what I mean.",1396224000,5,1979,4.584745762711864

The story was disjointed and convoluted.  From the cover photo, we are lead to believe the story will be about two closeted blue-collar men.  But the two men don't get together until the last 10 or 15 minutes of the film. Very disappointing and unsatisfying. The story would have been so much better without extraneous characters, such as the ex-lover who was comatose in a hospital (and the comatose guy's sister).  The storyline with Gabe's wife and her co-worker ""date"" was unnecessary and did nothing to advance the story. The movie it has been compared to (Brokeback Mountain) towers over this film in both quality and story continuity.

There is a lot of texture in this film with many well-integrated story lines. The Pit Stop, is the meeting  between our two principal protagonists, both in the midst of relationship dramas, and I think the Pit Stop they both make, represents a chance moment for them to take a ""time-out"" to reconnect with another human being in a way that brings them comfort, hope and solace and just a little respite from the rigors of living...for now, living alone, but perhaps not for long. I love the pacing of this movie and the director's technical command for the art of storytelling on film, which in the French tradition, has always been more about showing, not telling or shouting every detail of the character(s) and story.

6121416,5,B00GWWV1XU,"What is rare in films, in much of art for that matter, is generosity.  Big bank-rolled American movies have abandoned it.  But a few independents have kept its impulses alive, for example Junebug and Old Joy.  Like them, Pit Stop grants its characters personal complexity, emotional nuance, and decency.  It never betrays them with irony or directorial superiority.  It does not matter if a character is a major or relatively minor figure in the unfolding of the film's action.  Everyone is treated, depicted, and revealed with equal respect and understanding.
  Pit Stop is a remarkably generous movie.  All of its characters, not just its leads, are carefully, attentively, subtly portrayed.  It is able to surprise you, as, for example, the moment when Gabe reveals he knows some French, Ernesto breaks down while talking to Luis on the phone, or Winston speaks to Shannon in the parking lot after their date the night before.  Characters take unexpected, but nonetheless ""realistic"" turns  against some expectations one might have made about them.  This is as true of relatively minor characters as of the more important ones.  When Martin, Ernesto's former lover is in a coma, and his sister comes to visit him, she reveals herself to Martin (and to us) not to be whom we might have expected her to be just from what she has said to Ernie on the phone.  She's not a stereotype.  Even in her brief scene, she is shown to be emotionally fraught.  She has and is allowed depth.
  No one in this film is a stereotype.  No one is a type of any kind.  The movie's realism, for lack of a better word, emerges not just from a keen eye-place is evoked time after time with simple but telling shots-but from its emotional attention.  It knows its characters, all its characters, and it gives them, allows them their full humanity.
  Its pace is therefore necessarily deliberate.  It needs to take its time to be true to what it observes.  Much of it is sad.
These are in many ways lonely people in a lonely place.  What is remarkable, however, is how, at times, that loneliness is overcome, how some of its characters are offered the time to find themselves happier than they might have expected to be. This movie is not about their lives after that happiness, if it is to endure, but their ways to it.  Its aim is less to unfold a plot than to show ever more acutely who is people are.
  Thus it ends exactly when and as it must, with a joy that has come almost unaccountably, almost by surprise.  Because this exceptionally fine and humane movie sees its characters both fully and lovingly, when some come to discover love, or something at least close enough to it, it feels completely right, without any sentimentality to it or easy resolutions.  Pit Stop is one of the most gracious movies I have seen in a long time.  It gives its characters, it lets its characters have, the depth they are due.",1392854400,47,2895,4.6358267716535435

6121418,5,B00GWWV1XU,"This is by far the best gay movie I have ever seen, and I've seen hundreds - all the ones that are worth seeing and many more that aren't. Everything about it is perfect.

It doesn't need editing or any of the other fixes even favorable reviews say it needs. They're looking for a different kind of movie - in which the lovers meet early and we see all that happens afterwards - and they won't have any trouble finding it, because it's all we've gotten until now. But I THANK GOD that Yen Tan didn't hear their whining, and that he made this movie EXACTLY as he did. Not in any universe could it be any better than it is.

Every character (including the ex-wife and her new boyfriend) and every scene is essential, exactly as it is. If I listed everything about Pit Stop that's perfect I'd list everything (well, maybe not the title), but I must single out the writing, direction and acting.

The characters have time to develop fully and richly, each within the context of his own life, every tiny detail of which is perfect. Their brief almost-meetings (at least three times) earlier in the movie help tie their stories together even though they're deliciously subtle and easy to miss; and the pacing of the whole movie is as graceful and lovely as a ballet, but more natural. Action lovers will definitely be bored, but who cares? When the two men finally meet, it's the sweetest, hottest stuff ever shown on any kind of screen anywhere on earth.

Gabe and Ernie are the realest couple ever in any gay movie, and Bill Heck and Marcus DeAnda are the best actors who ever played gay characters. Every word, every sound, every movement, every gesture, every glance of an eye or lift of an eyebrow is perfect.

6121421,5,B00GWWV1XU,"A movie that brought humanity and reality of the modern day world of complex relationships with surprising grace.  Nuanced with being and falling in love with that note of always loving the person you once loved but is with you no longer.  The screenwriter appears to have brought some allegory of relationships and the man in the comma that some day may wake up.  Speaking of love, you will fall for the soundtrack.  I looked online and it doesn't seem to be available or works by the same composer Curtis Glenn Heath except for a couple MP3 cuts.  Director really hit a home run choosing the haunting sound, ""Things Kept to Myself""....Some producer should look into this...a few dollars to be had.",1392508800,,699,4.69672131147541

6121423,3,B00GWWV1XU,it was a bit slow and the flitting back and forth between the sub plots was confusing for me. I would give it more than 3 stars but not four.

6121724,5,B00GWWV1XU,"The cast was excellent, and the writing was sensitive and natural. So much so, I often had the feeling that the characters were actually living their own personalities and creating their own dialogue. Although there was a certain tension between each of the two ""couples"", it was a pleasure to see a film where there was no underlying betrayal. Both of the main characters were ""free"", stable and self-satisfied men with no emotional baggage, searching for someone to share their lives. An all-around beautiful and HEALTHY film.",1391990400,2,528,5.080459770114943
6121725,4,B00GWWV1XU,"Pit Stop is sneaky good because of how clever co-writer David Lowery (Ain't Them Bodies Saints) and co-writer/director Yen Tan (Ciao) craft the simple but impactful story.

The first thing that becomes apparent is that it has no real narrative. While it is a story by literal definition, the film is more an exercise in observation, with the subject being the aftermath of emotional tragedies. With the exception of how Ernesto manages his ex-love who is living with him, those tragedies are never shown, and that is for the better. This is a film about how these men cope with what happened to them, not what actually happened to them. It's an incredibly genuine experience.

The other part I like about the story is that it's a tale of destiny but not in the usual sense. It's no secret that the men make a connection, but their path to each other never feels contrived as it isn't a same-sex version of Sleepless In Seattle. The whole point isn't how they meet, it's THAT they meet. It's as if the ending was written first and the story was built backwards form there and then played from the beginning.

Also refreshing? The approach of being observational allows for the absence of the gay-specific melodrama you might find in a stereotypical tale about two gay men in a small town in Texas. Because Pit Stop treats viewers like they have brains, sexual politics or regional stereotypes are never on display they way they might be in other films. Oh, you know those things happen because you know they happen, but the film never feels the need to tell you what you already know. That's not to say the film doesn't have with gay-specific issuesit has. It's to say the story does another thing right by not doing something wrong.

There are solid supporting actors and actresses throughout the film, but stars Heck and DeAnda carry it with excellent performances, led by a strong bench behind the camera.

Once again, Wolfe Video proves it knows what it's doing from a technical perspective. Like sister Wolfe release Margarita, Pit Stop is a film with excellent cinematography, here courtesy of HutcH (The Romance of Loneliness). HutcH makes excellent use of low-lit situations, and at times has entire areas within a scene cast in darkness, giving it almost a stage play feel. (There's a great-looking scene very early where Gabe's 6-year-old daughter leaves a finely lit kitchen table in the foreground to put her dinner plate in the sink, and the child is nearly swallowed whole by the shadowy background.) The video transfer performs very well in these and other dark conditions in the film. The Dolby 5.1 sounds perfectly fine, with little competition between or among sounds.

The extras consist of two commentary tracks. One track is with with Director Yen Tan and stars Bill Heck and Marcus DeAnda. They discuss topics ranging from on-set memories to filmmaking tips and tricks. The other track is again with Tan, but accompanied this time by Producer Kelly Williams (Pictures of Superheroes), Cinematographer HutcH, and Editor Don Swaynos (The Horrible Life of Dr. Ghoul). Their conversation is a little more inside baseball and a little more technical.

6121726,4,B00GWWV1XU,"The two males leads in this indy film were strong. Other characters weren't as skilled actors. What I liked most was the two male lead's characters and characterizations. Both were very flawed and very human. Both were lovable, but rough around the edges. Neither was a stereotype, thankfully. Further, there was no sappy ending where everyone lives happily ever after; however, there was the hope that these two could make a successful relationship happen between them while integrating the various aspects, demands, and complications of their individual lives.  A few poignant, but not melodramatic moments pointed out the deep longing and loneliness these men felt.",1391558400,,668,5.3619047619047615

The two main characters Ernesto and Gabe each sexy on their own, I felt had great chemistry. I thought this was an honest and very believable story. The movie ended before I was ready for it to end. I wanted to see what happens next. As mentioned by someone else, the story was about the journey of these two men getting together, however, I still wanted to see more.
Very well made and I thoroughly enjoyed this move.

6121933,1,B00GWWV1XU,"The cover picture for this movie looked very enticing, but you don't get to see that scene or any interaction of the main characters until the last 10 - 15 minutes of the movie. As another reviewer similarly commented, the movie is less about the main characters and is more about the side characters. Each of the main characters has or has had their respective relationship issues and had a break up with their respective boyfriends at some point. To be honest, the movie was hard for me to follow in the beginning because there were so many side bar stories and different characters going on, that it took me a while to make sense of it all. An example of where the movie is more about the side characters is where you see the one woman, who had been involved with the one main character, and she is out on a date with a coworker. There seems to be a good amount of detail with her date and how it fails, starting off with the guy coming over to pick her up at her home, their conversation in the restaurant, and their interactions afterward as they sit in the car together and try to make out. As I'm watching all of this, I think to myself, this is supposed to be a gay movie - why am I seeing all this detail between two straight people. Again as I stated, you don't see any interaction between the two main characters until the last 10 or 15 minutes. What interaction you saw in bed was good, but there wasn't much of it. Big disappointment!",1390262400,12,1447,4.2846715328467155
6121934,4,B00GWWV1XU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Recent Spirit Award nominees have cropped up in the past few years including 'Keep the Lights On' and 'In the Family', sensitively-made films on a gay theme. Now in 2014, we have 'Pit Stop', which is also as good as these fine predecessors.

'Pit Stop' focuses on two blue collar workers from Texas, Gabe and Ernesto (played by an excellent Bill Heck and Marcus DeAnda, respectively). We see each of their stories for most of the film separately, and note that both are getting over failed relationships.

In the case of Ernesto, his ex-boyfriend, Luis, is still living with him. He initially tells Luis he can take as much time as he wants to move out but changes his mind when the ex-boyfriend starts dating other men and keeps him up, while watching late night TV. Ernesto also visits another ex-boyfriend, who's in a coma, after being critically hurt in a car accident.

Gabe's situation is different. He's still living with his wife and young daughter but no longer sleeps with her. He recently broke up with a man and now is dating again. In a notable scene, Gabe goes out on a date with a teacher--who falls asleep on their date watching a foreign film in a movie theater. Gabe drives the date home, who apologizes for not wanting to see him again, as he makes it clear that he hasn't gotten over his last relationship.

There's also a sub-plot involving Gabe's wife, Shannon, who goes out with a co-worker, Winston, on a date. Shannon, desperate for physical companionship, gets drunk and puts the moves on Winston, who isn't ready to get physical on a first date. Sure it's possible that Gabe's sexual rejection of his wife would lead her to want to have sexual contact with a man she's probably not that attracted to (Gabe tells Winston at one point that Shannon isn't attracted to heavy set men). But usually, the roles are reversed: women are wary of having sex on a first date, especially when it involves a man they don't find that attractive.

While the pacing of the film is fairly slow, the interactions between the characters ring true. Another excellent scene is when Luis has left and calls Ernesto on the phone, from New Mexico. Luis feels he's lost but Ernesto tries to convince him that he'll eventually get it together, if he just applies himself (like going back to school). At the same time, Ernesto makes it clear that he doesn't want Luis to return.

We see the connection between Gabe and Ernesto at film's end, as they meet through online dating. They're basically instantly attracted to one another as they recognize that they have both been trying to fill a similar void, in their lives. 'Pit Stop' is a low key drama which, as I pointed out above, proceeds rather lugubriously. Nonetheless, for the patient film-goer, you will be rewarded by excellent acting, direction and characters that seem to jump off the page, of real life.",1390176000,19,2905,4.684313725490196
6121935,3,B00GWWV1XU,"I have to agree with others who felt this was a good movie that ended just as it was warming up.  All the acting was good, and the story felt honest.  The two lead actors were terrific, with great chemistry.  Clearly they were going to get together at some point.  Interesting complications were set up amidst a web of friends and family.  They finally had a date--as we knew they would--and then pop! the credits rolled.  That's it? Wait, what happens next? And what about all those complications?  Is there a sequel? I would love to see this re-edited with half an hour less setting up and some time exploring the main characters' relationship.  And an ending, too. Oh well.",1390089600,20,676,4.575
6121936,4,B00GWWV1XU,"If there ever was a movie that could describe gay men living in small-town America in the middle of the  Heartland, this would be it. Pit Stop tells more of the development of two men in what makes them who they are, how they live and adapt in a small East Texas town. Even though the movie may take it's own sweet time getting to the final interaction between the two main characters, it gives us the necessary opportunity to get to know each one of them on more of a individual basis. In doing this, it gives us a chance to get know the not-so-perfect but just as engaging characters along the way. Some may be disappointed in the film  because Gabe and Enrique do not cross paths but until the end, but as someone once said, our lessons come from the journey, not the destination.",1390003200,28,783,4.319727891156463
6121937,2,B00GWWV1XU,Although this movie has a great theme to it. It was more about characters around the 2 leads versus the 2 leads. I was really looking for this movie to move me it just didn't do it for me.,1389830400,2,188,3.8461538461538463

6121939,5,B00GWWV1XU,"One of the better independent movies of the year.  And close to one of the best LGBT movies of the past couple. Superb acting, especially from Bill Heck (Gabe), Amy Seimetz (Shannon) and Corby Sullivan (Les).  (The ""date"" between Gabe and Les was pitch perfect).

It's a movie that takes its time, but in doing so perfectly sets the mood and tone of life for two closeted gay men in East Texas.  To be sure, ""life"" is the key word here.  Even though at times the characters - all of them - experience small vignettes of heartbreaking isolation, acute longing and a simple but encompassing need to share that life with those they love, or want to love if only they can find them.  Each of these small, but often powerful scenes, stand on their own.  But strung together in the hands of the director, they tell a story that deserves to be heard.

No superheroes here.  No villains. No special effects.  No car chases.  No guns or shoot-em-ups.  If that's what you need in a movie, this one's not for you.  It's just a human story, with snippets of real life about people we can't help but care about.

Oh, and no happy endings, either.  Only tentative, but hopeful, happy beginnings.

Invite some friends over, open a nice bottle of wine, push the play button, pay attention, and when it's over - talk. It's one of those movies.",1389657600,8,1326,4.485355648535565
6121940,5,B00GWWV1XU,"This movie is like European films where a slice of life is shown microcosm style. It is a shorter film, and gives a great representation of life for both the gay and straight characters in it. I gave it 5 stars for the acting, writing, directing and story.
It is not a feel good movie, and as our society is evolving, the themes here might not resonate with younger people at all. But it does tell a real story well and leaves me hopeful that the characters all end up happy despite their lives' hurdles.

A brave movie to make; and I thank everyone who produced this. I am always glad to see art which includes unpopular themes about life as a gay man or for gay men and those in their lives.

If you take the pressure off of the movie to be a thriller, and look at it as if watching a well produced play in a theatre, then I think it deserves applause.

Also the actor who plays Gabe ... feel free to call me",1389657600,4,910,4.101123595505618
6121941,2,B00GWWV1XU,"It is so hard to find good gay themed cinema...so always excited when a new one comes out.  Unfortunately, more often than not the movie winds up being a disappointment.  Pit Stop was no exception.  It just drags on...not really sure what story it wants to tell, or which characters it wants to follow...well at least follow so that we are interested in them. I really thought the story had potential because the story openly deals with a previouly married man, that came out as gay, but still had a good relationship with his ex wife and daughter.  I really do not get why the director's of gay themed movies have everything they need...funding, good casts, etc...and then most times the movies suck!  Come on...all that effort and hard work it takes to make a movie...you would think that they realize that they are not making a good, enjoyable movie.
