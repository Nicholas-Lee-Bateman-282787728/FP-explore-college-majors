8215197,5,B000UVV288,"The various titles in this video series have received a lot of negative comments, which most poker materials produced for beginners and novices do, for being too simple or unrealistic in practice.  I believe a large part of the negativity comes from the poker community's dislike of Phil's public persona, as well as from the disdain young internet players have toward any material below their skill level or toward material that isn't presented in the jargon of internet no-limit hold'em.  My perspective is that these 4 videos make excellent supplementary material to Phil's books, especially his book on Hold'em, which is primarily about Limit Hold'em.  Phil's book and these videos do a good job of helping a novice live-table player find a way to reason through the strategy of the game.  If you read his book from cover to cover you'll realize he doesn't recommend playing only 10 hands ever, he recommends that a raw beginner confine themself to those 10 hands while becoming comfortable with the game.  He gives expanded starting hand ranges in later chapters and good hand examples and playing strategy which is comprehensible in a live-game setting where reading betting patterns is more useful than trying to imagine the computer-data specific concept of playing against an unknown player's ""hand range"" or persistently taking countermeasures against potential bluffs that aren't ever going to happen at a low-stakes limit hold'em table.  I gave this set 5 stars because when used with his books the viewer, who would mostly be a novice live-table player, gets an excellent starting education.",1428883200,,1604,5.15
8215198,1,B000UVV288,"I bought the Phil Hellmuth Super Course with all 4 of his videos.  I thought the videos were very disappointing and misleading.  There were two major problems:

  1.  The top ten hands are very misleading and only the smallest limit games can be beat by using that strategy.

  2. The tournament Strategies DVD spent most of the time discussing how to enter the WSOP main event instead of teaching how to play the game.

I thought the DVD's were very misleading because they gave a strategy that will only work in the smallest limit games and then gives the impression that by following his top ten hand system you will be able to enter the World Series.  And to go a step farther, Phil did a poor job of showing how to use these ten hands.  He makes little attempt to show the difference between pocket sevens and pocket queens.  He also failed to show how position can affect the hands preflop.  If you were under the gun in No-limit, then only half of the top ten hands could be played, and if you were on the button, then all of the ten plus Ace-X suited and connectors should also be played because they rate to win. Phil should have mentioned this in his DVD's.

The bottom line is this...Beginners who buy these DVD's will be WORSE OFF than they would be if they just never purchased them.
Thats a big problem.
My advice is to get something else, the best thigs out there are from Doyle brunson and Dan Harrington",1233360000,6,1420,4.3869731800766285
8215199,3,B000UVV288,"Phil Hellmuth is hands down one of the greatest tournament players of all time; however, his ability to effectively communicate and teach in the DVD format leaves a LOT to be desired.  If you are a beginning player, you will get a lot out of these DVD's; however, if you are a mid-range to advance player...save your money.",1213401600,3,323,4.568965517241379
