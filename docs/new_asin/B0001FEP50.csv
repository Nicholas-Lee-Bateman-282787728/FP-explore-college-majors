8163559,2,B0001FEP50,"All this movie is is just a karate movie. Not Kung fu just Karate! The movie itself is a bad recording and the title describes everything! This a movie about revenge and the love of doing it! The hero of the movie instantly becomes a villain after his mentor meets with an unfortunate ""accident!"" Then goes on a Charles Bronson rampage killing everybody that he thinks had something to do with the ""accident!"" The ending sucked and even though there is the hint of a love story that still didn't stop the other ""accidents"" from happening! My advice is to buy for the lowest price possible! Better effects, actors, story line, and recording from videotape to dvd could've made this at least look better!",1242691200,,702,4.669354838709677
