7032095,5,B00UAMEU7C,Pure Patrick Swayze  The sexual display was way over the top.  This is what made it so possibly one of the most explicit scenes of many movies observed lately ! The romance lines were kept to a realistic sense.  All in all good stuff.,1466899200,3,234,4.2727272727272725

7032104,4,B00UAMEU7C,"Perhaps my all time favorite ""guilty pleasure"" movie. A fun ride all the way through. It ain't Shakespeare, nor was it intended to be so. Analogical to a western where a new sheriff comes to town to either bring peace and or clean out the bad guys. In this case, the problem is not a rancher and his hired hands, but a wealthy land owner and his thugs.  Rowdy, raucous, sexy, humorous and violent all wrapped up in one.",1509235200,,419,4.30379746835443

7032132,5,B00UAMEU7C,"What on the surface seems like a basic 80's action film is actually hiding a film that will eventually come to be recognized as THE CITIZEN KANE OF DOWN-SOUTH, PHILOSOPHER BAR BOUNCER MARTIAL ARTS FILMS !

Every line of dialogue is a stroke of genius (""Pain doesn't hurt..""), every costume a master work (I was stunned that it didn't win an oscar just for the Pizza Hut (TM) table cloth dress that Kelly Lynch wore!) and the music probably made John Williams weep that he did not do this film.

No one, but no one could have played the Shakespearian character of Dalton but Patrick Swayze. No one.

Although watching it on DVD does not give you the necessary breaks to catch your breath from the intensity of the film like watching it on TBS does you can always pause it and breath into a paper bag for a few minutes and then go back to it.

Dismissed by many, the true fans can see beneath the surface of this film that was obviously hidden in the wrapper of an action film so that enlightenment could be passed onto the masses.

I have molded my life around Dalton's philosophies and have lived by the simple but truly wise wisdom of:
""I want you to be nice until it's time to not be nice.""
Wow.

Swayze was a god and we miss him but at least we still have Road House.",1488758400,,1270,4.270833333333333
7032133,5,B00UAMEU7C,After watching this movie I now provide security for 5 different bars. Dalton has taught me all I need to know in bar security. If I wear my patriotic socks I harness the power of Teddy Roosevelt. My bars now have the same atmosphere as a library.,1488585600,4,247,4.276595744680851

When I first heard about this movie from my brother I knew Id love it because he had loved it.  Watch out small town America, Dalton is here to clean up the streets with your faces if you're bad news. Diamond Dallas Page, my all time favorite bad guy wrestler plays my least all time favorite bad guy because hes not even the main bad guy who is lame but hes still good in this movie. The main bad guy is an old dude named Wesley Willis I think and hes old but hes still pretty bad, like, really bad but he gets laid by super young babes so thats kind of cool but hes so bad so I cant stand him and want nothing more than for Dalton to punch him into his face. Oh yeah, don't worry, Dalton rips out a guys, nope not going to spoil it, youll just have to see for yourself! This one was easy, 5 muscle packed stars.",1479254400,,897,3.955801104972376
