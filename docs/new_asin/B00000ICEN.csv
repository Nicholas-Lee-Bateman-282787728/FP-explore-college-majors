7910002,3,B00000ICEN,"Set in the kind of boarding-houses that simply don't exist any more, SHADOWS ON THE STAIRS is based on a West End hit and contains a cast of Hollywood British stalwarts augmented by Turhan Bey as a suspicious Indian student (in his first film).

The plot is straightforward: Mr. Reynolds (Paul Cavanagh) is apparently knifed to death one night when everyone else is asleep. The Scotland Yard inspector assigned to the case (Lumsden Hare) makes all the wrong deductions and is set right by aspiring playwright Hugh Bromilow (Bruce Lester). An hysterical maid Lucy (Phyliis Barry) apparently commits suicide as she realizes that Tom Armitage (Miles Mander) - who has had a clandestine affair with her - wants to dump her. Add to that an hysterical boarding-house maitresse d'h (Freda Inescort), and a comic spinster (Mary Snell), and you have plenty of material for a fifty-nine minute quickie.

Director D. Ross Lederman ensures that his camera keeps moving up and down the staircases and from room to room; this fast pace seems ideal for a film with more than its share of implausibilities, no more so than at the end, when a final plot-twist reveals that we, the viewers, have been hoodwinked just as much as the Inspector. But it really doesn't matter: the film's primary purpose is to provide a showcase for a gallery of British eccentrics, even down to the mustachioed police constable (Charles Irwin), who averts his eyes to anything potentially salacious.",1469577600,,1461,4.959183673469388
7910003,4,B00000ICEN,"Complicated intrigue involving several members of a London boarding house.  Besides some shady dealings with persons known and unknown, the man behind it all (Paul Cavanagh as Joe Reynolds) is also having an affair with the woman who runs the boarding house like a tyrant.  She's given to wild hysterics at the slightest provocation.  When Joe turns up dead, there are plenty of suspects.  But was he killed for the reason everyone thinks or for another reason entirely.  Almost everyone behaves in a sinister and suspicious manner.  It's a bit overwrought at times but great fun just the same.

A novelty of a mystery that isn't..........  I liked it because it's a gimmick and the characters were so much fun to watch and I have a particular fondness for movies of that period (1941).

It's certainly a keeper.",1433894400,,812,4.826086956521739

The Anglo-flavored 1941 WARNER 'B' unit suspense story, SHADOWS ON THE STAIRS
was originally a 1929 stage drama by Frank Vosper (he wrote ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-From-a-Stranger/dp/B0001ZMWT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love From a Stranger</a>"").

Director is R. Ross Lederman. Once a Keytone Kops extra, this 2nd unit specialist made a bunch of
westerns and WWII rah-rahs, plus a Tarzan and Boston Blackie, before transitioning to TV series work.

Cast of ""Shadows"" is fairly undistinguished: Frieda Inescort, Paul Cavanagh, Heather Angel, Bruce Lester, Turhan Bey and other such ""luminariries,"" yet it's a Brian Foy-produced First National effort, so this may be worth a look, especially for mystery buffs and fans of classic era Warner movies who seek something new.

MILL CREEK synopsis:
""A London boarding house is the setting of this suspenseful tale with murder and numerous suspects. When a tenant is discovered dead at the boarding house, it seems that most everyone residing there had a motive to kill him. Tension mounts as the suspicions come to surface, leading through shocking twists and turns to the surprising conclusion.""

The above is, shall we say...a tad hyperbolic.

Once the multiply-stabbed corpse is discovered, the house quickly fills with Bobbies plus a stereotypical Scotland Yard inspector, played by Lumsden Hare. He interrogates everyone present, also those who arrive after him. A main suspect is settled upon, but as with other such stories, that person is the next knifing victim. There's a mysterious wooden crate, a woman with her face hidden by a shawl who wanders the house late at night, and more than one turban-clad foreigner.

(Speaking of the latter, Vienna-born Turhan Bey portrayed so many Arabs, perhaps his first name should've been ""Turban."")

Without revealing more beforehand plot, just prior to the final curtain, the killer confesses.....or does he?",1408752000,2,2212,5.543026706231454
7910005,3,B00000ICEN,I found this story OK because I thought it would be a very mysterious type murder mystery.  The actors portrayed their parts well and the plot was a little confusing at first until toward the end you found out what the whole story was about.  This is done unusually from the normal mysteries.  Since I collect mysteries I decided to add this to my collectioin because of its ending.  You will have to decide whether it was worthwhile to keep.,1363824000,2,442,4.4875
7910006,4,B00000ICEN,"If you like the classic ""B"" movie, you will enjoy this- just an easy ""B"" until a rather unique twist-",1296259200,2,101,4.1
7910007,5,B00000ICEN,Extremely entertaining WB B movie with a familiar cast.  The print from Alpha is one of the best I've seen from them.  No problems except they cut off the WB logo.,1242259200,6,163,4.225806451612903
7910008,3,B00000ICEN,"This B-film from Warner Brothers concerns the mysterious and deadly goings-on at a boarding house owned by Frieda Inescort and Miles Mander, who live there along with their daughter Heather Angel and several boarders.  Among the boarders is a struggling writer, an eccentric spinster, and two men involved in shady business.  In the course of the film's one hour running time, bodies begin to pile up as the writer tries to figure out the identity of a killer.  The actors all express the appropriate amount of shock and confusion as the mystery deepens, and the pace of the film maintains the suspense.  The direction could be sharper, and I found the story a little confusing at times, but I did like the twist ending.  Very few people have heard of Shadows On The Stairs, and although I think the comparisons to Hitchcock are a real stretch, fans of B-films will want to check this one out.",1021075200,25,893,4.698717948717949
