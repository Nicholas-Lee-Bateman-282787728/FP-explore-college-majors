786674,5,6304105967,"i REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. I ALSO CAUGHT THIS MOVIE YEARS AGO ON HBO.  AND YOU KNOW, A FEW YEARS AFTER A VEEEERRY SIMILAR MOVIE CAME OUT.  ""O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU""",1156377600,,167,4.1875
786675,2,6304105967,"The Grave is about two convicts played by Craig Sheffer (Fire In The Sky, Dracula II: Ascension) and Josh Charles (Coldblooded, SWAT) who bust out of the prison with the help from a security guard, that is John Diehl (Jurassic Park 3, Fail Safe(2000). The 2 escape to find fortunes in a grave but Charles is shot, so Sheffer takes him to Anthony Michael Hall (Weird Science, The Breakfast Club), Donal Louge (Blade, Reindeer Games) and Max Perlich (Drugstore Cowboy, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) for help. Things go off schedule as Charles dies, Sheffer is left for dead and the  rascals Perlich, Louge and Hall try to figure things out. Sheffer isn't dead, Perlich gets killed and the 3 (Hall, Sheffer and Louge) find the fortunes but things get even more twisted as they are locked in the secret room and then the fit really hits the shan from there. This is told by a voiceboxed mystery person and Keith David (Pitch Black, Requiem For A Dream) is along for the ride. Now this movie began dumb and ended dumb because it was so damn perdictable because I knew off the bat who the voiceboxed person was, it was the chick damnit! The chick was played by Gabrielle Anwar (The Guilty, Things To Do In Denver When Your Dead). Also starring Eric Roberts (National Security, The Specialist) and Giovanni Ribisi (Suburbia, The Mod Squad). Not much fun and they didn't eat any posums at all, why not!!!",1092009600,3,1397,4.633064516129032
786676,5,6304105967,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie on HBO one late night a few years back... And was smart enough to pop in a vcr tape and dub it off... WHY WON'T THEY RELEASE THIS MOVIE ON DVD?! The cast and acting both are great... There are a seldom few movies I can watch over and over and everytime pay as close of attention as I did the first night I saw it... This is one of those movies... I can't understand why it has been such an unknown film... Donal Logue (Blade, and now the star of the hit tv series ""Grounded For Life"") stars in this movie, and it is his best performance i've ever seen... I LOVE HIS CHARACTER... It is my favorite in the entire movie... The pairing of ""Travis, Boo, and Cletus"" is classic... If you haven't seen this movie, I strongly suggest you do... My rating out of 5 is a 10...",1034208000,2,804,4.062893081761007
786677,4,6304105967,"I recently saw this late at night on TV and was surprised at how good it was (I wasn't expecting much)--and now I'm disappointed that it can't be found on DVD. It's basically a treasure-hunt movie, with the gold under (what else?) a grave in the swamps somewhere down South. The story may lack originality, but the dialogue and acting are fantastic. A cameo appearance by Eric Roberts in which he describes how his wife shoots him is absolutely hilarious. Even 80s-era teen star Anthony Michael Hall, playing an ex-con undertaker, finally plays a role well. Amazing. All in all, this is a very entertaining film.",978912000,20,612,4.783018867924528

786766,5,6304105967,"An unexpectedly fun little movie, filled with twists, turns, chills and straight-up surprises.  The dialogue can be a little difficult for someone unaccustomed to the accents of the Deep South, but that only adds to the atmosphere of backwoods intrigue.  The darkly comedic storyline is engaging, supported by a very talented cast.  Thoroughly enjoyable!",1501200000,,354,5.518518518518518

786769,5,6304105967,"A film definitely worth watching.  Especially if you like treasure hunting films.  The Grave is about a couple of guys in the joint, who get a hot tip on a hoard of buried treasure and break out of jail to find it.  Then the trouble begins. Anthony Michael Hall and Eric Roberts have good parts.  Additionally, the bluegrass sound track is pretty good too.  Highly recommend.",1500854400,,375,4.621212121212121

786773,5,6304105967,"Pretty good movie fitting of its title ""The Grave."" Backwoods accents throughout and even though it's supposed to be of a thriller nature, there were lots lot of amusing dialogue throughout. The plot of the entire setting is Louisiana's swamps and cemeteries--Greed drives all characters even until the ending with the remaining and unfortunate clergyman. Great acting for such young actors, and worth the watch.",1496620800,,412,5.3538461538461535

786822,5,6304105967,"Everyone seems to have a different view of this movie. In some ways it is far-fetched, but not any more so than any other movie. This is some language that will offend some. The overall story isn't even all that eventful. What really makes the whole thing -- to me anyway, are the characters portrayed by a group of actors that most people had probably written off. There is something that rings true about the portrayal of the sub-culture of under-educated young men, something that rings true, even if it is just BS and bravado. I thoroughly enjoyed this, but I can see how it might be hit or miss for others.",1489881600,,611,4.464285714285714

787845,4,6304105967,"The Grave is definitely worth watching. With all the hit and miss movies out there, it's nice to find a gem. This movie is like Cormac McCarthy meets the Cohen Brothers. It's very clever and actually funny in quite a few parts. The acting is very good and I was surprised by several of the performances in this film.

The narrator of the movie is telling the tale of woe of two prisoners who escaped a couple of years ago. Throughout a night of smoky jail cell talk, we learn of the prisoners who heard a rumor about a grave full of buried treasure. Naturally they got greedy. This starts the journey through the backwoods of Louisiana as the two escape the prison and go looking for the grave. The plot twists and turns towards the destination. Other characters, and I mean characters, join in. Though grisly and not for the overly sensitive, this is a pretty fun movie to watch.

I never realized that Anthony Michael Hall was that good of an actor. In this he plays Travis, an unfriendly undertaker who also takes an interest in the buried treasure. He is really good in this.

The Grave isn't deep or meaningful, it's just a fun little movie that offers up a decent plot and some very good performances.",1427500800,15,1207,4.4772727272727275
787846,1,6304105967,"This movie is about repellant people doing repellant things.  There isn't one single moment that shows an interesting person doing something interesting.

787848,5,6304105967,"When I rented this, I think I read the description wrong. I'm glad I did. I just loved this movie from start to finish. I would absolutely watch this one again without hesitation.

This movie has a little of everything - humor, greed, chase, lust, etc. BUT, the very BEST part is that things aren't always what they seem. You have to watch all the way to the very end. It's not a movie that you can predict the ending which makes it fabulous!",1426809600,4,442,4.261904761904762

787949,4,6304105967,"Big fun to be had here, and partly because, while not exactly brilliant, this movie is hilarious, and most importantly, not monolithically formulaic as it hovers between thriller, swamp jail escape, Dixie Mayhem, and (sub-sub-urban) legend. Just grab the Cherries Garcia or your substance of choice, and get ready for a string of small town losers who can't doubletalk and double cross each other fast enough on the way to sniffing out buried treasure. If you jump on this ride, you track a mostly non-gory, but entirely believable string of madcap manslaughter, inelegant murders and nutty situations. A near-perfect weekend adult chill movie, with rompin' stompin through the swamp, all wrapped up in a story with a twisty jail-confession narrator revealing what really happened to a small Southern town's *urban legend* treasure from what turns out to be a shocking perspective.

So glad I happened on this one --which maybe Amazon just started streaming, not sure--  only because I watch everything ultra quirky character actor, Giovanni Ribisi's in, and wasn't disappointed (LOST IN TRANSLATION, SELMA, THE GIFT, FRIENDS). Ribisi,  a workfarm prisoner with a strange haircut and even stranger tale, sets it all off. More oddball performances turned in by Donal Logue of SONS OF ANARCHY and THE TAO OF STEVE, plus a short but unforgettable scene with legendary Eric Roberts, the seldom seen brother of you know who. Roberts is also a native Southern guy whose weird presence unfailingly takes everything up a notch. In that Harry Dean Stanton way, but with a triple twist.

Being from the South, I don't always find movie accents good enough, particularly in indie or indie-style films; but thankfully, Eric Roberts and Giovanni Ribisi levelled things up in that department here.",1424908800,6,1783,5.180555555555555
