Here we're dealing with multiple reincarnations centered around an ill-fated romance between Felipe (Demian Bichir) and Mariana (Anette Michel).

Felipe seems to be irresistible to women and has trouble remembering to use his big head; his little head seems to wrest control far too often! Watching the demise of a 10-year marriage is both believable and sad, particularly when their little boy Santiago (Carlos Padilla) is involved. He seems to be either autistic or have Asperger's, the Mexican term for his condition is either an Indigo or a Crystal boy.

An angel, Uriel, keeps showing up; he seems to witness events rather than change them but he weeps when someone dies. Because this takes place on the campus of an institution of higher learning, we have a lot of young, hormonally challenged characters who don't quite think things through.

One young girl, Isabel (Fran Meric), who has had a fling with our hero, happens to be the wealthy daughter of a drug kingpin. No good will come from THIS one!

We see issues with marginal parental health, senile dementia, alcoholism and drug use. It is clear from the very beginning that Demian Bichir is an outstanding actor and I can see why he was nominated for a 2012 Academy Award (A Better Life). The DVD from Amazon will have optional English captions.",1379116800,,1374,4.805084745762712

8333431,4,B001PJRAU8,"La Otra Mitad del Sol is not a typical telenovela, the story is about the private university in Mexico City, and main charicters are professors and students. I was not born in Mexico or in latin culture, I enjoyed waching telenovals in Europe before, so some cultural referenses seems a little bit strange to me, such as sexual relations between teachers and students seems to be acceptable in Mexico, same as between councellors and patients. But it builds the story , so it is what it is. Demian Bichir is hot, he is in American TV series Weeds as well. Anette Michel is very beautiful women, and other actors are very easy on the eye too. So as far as telenovela goes it is very good product. The quality of CD is good, exept somwhere in 13th or 14 episodeI don't remember the episode number for sure, the English subtitles do not mach to what is going on( it is when Filippe gets into the jail, but subtitles talk about his son visions, I just kept guessing what is going on with my limited Spanish skills). Other than that I will recommend this show for people who like latin culture and learn Spanish.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Otra-Mitad-del-Sol/dp/B001PJRAU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Otra Mitad del Sol</a>",1307664000,4,1265,5.0285714285714285
8333432,5,B001PJRAU8,"I really enjoyed watching ""La Otra Mitad del Sol"". I have watched several telenovelas offered by Amazon to practice my Spanish. This one was edited perfectly, I did not feel that something was missing (obviously cut out) as in some other edited soaps. The story is interesting, different and original, one of the best I have seen.",1266710400,6,330,4.807017543859649
