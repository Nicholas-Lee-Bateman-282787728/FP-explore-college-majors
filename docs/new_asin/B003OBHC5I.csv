8628582,2,B003OBHC5I,"Right off the top - the cover picture is of Aretha from the late 60's, so it's a little misleading.  After starting with an unexceptional version of Perdido, Aretha follows with the classic Respect and soulful reading of Natural Woman (asserting her Queen of Soul cred).  On Rock Steady, she gets down and funky proving she could still shake her 'thang'.  The rest of the DVD drops in energy at this point.  Staid 'impressions' of the Staple Singers, Gladys Knight and Diana Ross fail as humor or homage.  Maybe it's a Vegas thing.  She finishes the show with an over-the-top performance of The Greatest Love Of All - soulless vocal gymnastics.  Now we know where Mariah, Celine and Whitney got their inspiration.",1299024000,5,713,4.795081967213115
