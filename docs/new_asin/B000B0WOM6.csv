2398912,1,B000B0WOM6,"Snowboard Christmas could have been wonderful, given the theme, but the message is pure liberal propaganda. The plot and dialog are unnaturally subservient to political correctness. All beliefs and genders are equal. The predetermined ending becomes obvious about ten minutes into the story. Remakes are generally bland, and this one sure is. A big disappointment is the voice of Goliath. Oh well,  we live in Orwellian times.",1156291200,32,426,5.358208955223881
2398913,5,B000B0WOM6,"This special is the first Davey and Goliath to be produced since Ruth Clokey made the Special ""To the Rescue"" in 1975.  This new Special stayed true to the original, still produced by the Clokey family, but it moves with a lot more action and excitement than the older ones.  The puppets and sets stay true to the original, and the animation matches the best that was done in the early 70's when Sneaky Pete Kleinow and Harry Walton were at their peak.  I think ""The Flying Tomato"" has probably seen this 100 times.

As for the story, it's also true to the original.  Davey and Golliath was always a ""God loves everyone"" message.  The reviewers before should  check out the old episodes before they judge this.  The message of this Special is that Davey learns that Jews and Muslims are not stereotypes.  And for your information, if you study theology, all three religions do believe in the same God.  We'd have much less strife in the world if the message of this show spread through our cultures.  Christians, Jews, and Muslims could all use a dose of love and tolerance for the other.  Gods love is not limited.

The friendship between Davey and his dog Goliath is very big in this story too, as it was in the original series.  This also shows off Stop Motion Animation, a medium which still shines above any CG show you'll find on TV.  The animation director is the same guy who next was in charge of animation for the recent ""Corpes Bride"" which is probably the most exquisite stop-motion show yet.

This Special is not preachy, it is fun.  My kids, 10, 6, and 2 all love it. Enjoy!",1143676800,9,1588,4.477351916376307
2398914,1,B000B0WOM6,"Although the style of this new addition to Davey & Goliath has the proper nostalgia, the strained and unnatural politically correct dialog is distracting, and seems even inappropriate in what was once considered Christian storytelling. The original purpose of this series was to teach proper behaviour to children as Davey takes his hard knocks. In this episode, the old lesson of being tolerant is revisited with a vengence -- almost as if the new writers decided to cram in 40 years of missed opportunity.

One faux pas that is absolutely unforgivable and which had us all laughing out loud in disbelief at the ignorance of the writing: two bullies (male) are shown to be able boarders, but when they spot the girl with Davey and friends they shout something to the effect of, ""Get off the mountain -- girls can't snowboard!""  Seriously, this would never happen.  Girls ROCK at snowboarding and everyone who has spent any time at all in the sport knows it.",1136937600,19,958,4.829268292682927
2398915,5,B000B0WOM6,I was soooo glad to see that for the first time I was able to buy a new episode of Davey and Goliath.  I watched the original airing on TV and looked forever to find it and now it is available.  If you are a parent this is a must HAVE for your kids and an enjoyable treat for yourself.,1126828800,6,285,3.7333333333333334
2398916,5,B000B0WOM6,"I really enjoyed this movie.  In a different episode ""The New Skates"" poor Goliath tries to snowboard for the first time.  He does very poorly and ends up rolling down a hill turning into a giant snow ball!  Davy and Sally laugh AT him mercilessly! (Not very Christian of them.) Anyway, in the beginning of Snowboard Christmas the expression ""Every dog has his day!"" comes true for Goliath!  Even though it is only a dream he puts on a Snowboarding performance which is SPECTACULAR!!!  After feeling very badly for Goliath in ""The New Skates"" I felt wonderful seeing him enjoy success!  This was my favorite part of the movie!",1346284800,2,626,4.697247706422019
2398917,1,B000B0WOM6,"If you are Christian like myself, please save your money and look elsewhere for good Christian values. This movie was a big surprise when the main message was all politically correct, ""I am OK, you are OK. We can all go to Heaven..."" there is but one way to Heaven, and that is by the atoning blood of Jesus Christ.",1324080000,12,315,4.266666666666667
2398918,5,B000B0WOM6,"Religion and Political Correctness Aside,

I think Davey and Goliath's Snowboarding Christmas is the best Davey and Goliath to date. The animation: Superb! A good addition to any stop-motion fan/geek/enthusiast/lover's collection. Hurray.",1293148800,,238,6.4375
2398919,5,B000B0WOM6,"I bought this DVD for my daughter who is eight years old and she loves it.  As a child I watched this show on TV so glad it is on DVD for children today.  Children need to know about love the way Jesus taught us to love.  All the cartoons should have been banned with violence because that is all our next generation is learning about, no love for each other.",1292025600,,359,4.028169014084507

2398921,5,B000B0WOM6,My Kids really liked this DVD.  It was up to date.  We have neighbors who don't celebrate christmas due to there religion beliefs it helped my kids to understand that other people have different ways of celebrating and not to be judgemental.  Isn't that what christanity suppose to be about?,1264464000,,291,4.78
2398922,1,B000B0WOM6,"If you are looking to remove Jesus Christ from your Christianity, then this movie is for you.  The message of Davey and Goliath has always followed the teaching of the Holy Bible and has always been Christ-based, especially on CHRISTmas. If you believe that there is one way to Salvation and that way is to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, then do not let your children watch this nasty, one-world-religion propaganda.

2398923,5,B000B0WOM6,"After a long hiatus the duo of Davey and Goliath are back, and with a wonderful Christmas message, too!  The son of the original animators recreates the timeless style of this old 60's favorite, and adds an updated and needed reminder of what the birth of Jesus was all about- the coming of love into the world, not just 2000 years ago, but today and always.  The animation looks better than ever, thanks to newer technology, and the story is told in a moving way that kids can understand and adults will enjoy, too.  This DVD has now become a season tradition for me and my family!  It just goes to show that the truth (and solid artistic work) holds up despite the passing of time.
Let's see more of such great animation and keep Davey and Goliath coming out on DVD!",1212537600,3,768,4.387323943661972
2398924,4,B000B0WOM6,"WHo could say anything negative about wholesome Davey and Goliath.  It's been 3 decades since I

watched in Black and WHite...Davey has moved into the modern age with a sports subject matter

sure to appeal to the kids.  Maybe for me too much effort to be politically correct, but it retains the

basic value messages...and it sure beats the alternatives available out there .",1168300800,2,376,4.8125
2398925,3,B000B0WOM6,"During the last couple of years I've seen repeats on t.v. of the old show of ""Davey and Goliath"",which I loved as a kid"" and thought it was too bad that tv was soo Sexist back in 1970's and '60s. I believe ,especially in these violent and self-centered days, America and the world need to have more friendly religious messeges! So many Christian people today seem so bigoted &  self righteous and go giving out their version, often  misguided messeges, of Christianity. I totally think shows like these need to help bring  people together. Also, I suggest viewing the ""Vegetable Tales""videos.",1165708800,3,592,4.841584158415841

8081217,1,B000B0WOM6,"This is a political correct film from 2010 that basically teaches all paths are the same in whatever religion you choose.  The life lesson of this is absolutely nothing like the original Davey and Goliath which most of us today have seen on the wonderful Smile of A Child Network via TBN.  It does teach to respect all people of all faiths which is a beautiful teaching of Christ, however it makes Judiasm, Christianity and Islam appear the exact same.  It shows Islam as a peaceful, giving and forgiving religion, probably focusing on it more than any other religion in the movie.  In the middle of the film, the Muslim girl Yasmine explains Ramadan in detail and how great her holiday is.  She explains how her family is Muslim and how they fast from food for good reasons on Ramadan and how she is so nice because she is from a Muslim family.  Davey asks Yasmine at one point, ""Why are you being so nice to me?""  She responds, ""Because my religion teaches me to be forgiving.""  Yasmine explains that though she does not do Christmas, she celebrates Ramadan instead, where she receives a new dress and states, ""That's the best.""  Davey then says that in Christmas he and his family celebrate God giving His Son while he says, ""That's the best for us.""  They all state their religious beliefs and all get along which is great.  However, it is more of a world religions film on the religious beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims, rather than a Christmas film for children.  All three of the children also make a very unwise decision to go down a ski slope that is blocked off.  An avalanche ends up happening almost killing them, and in the end, I don't recall Davey repenting to his parents at all when it was actually his ideal to break the rules in the first place.",1450915200,2,1771,4.5141065830721

8081219,3,B000B0WOM6,I am a big fan of the original series. I used to watch it regularly as a youth. I found this Snowboard Christmas to be good but not great. The animation and music is no doubt superior. I enjoyed the authenticity and especially the voices of the original I found superior. This is good however it does not hold a candle to the original. I wonder if there are any plans to produce anymore of these in the future. Art Clokey passed away several years ago. Goliath is adorable but it is interesting just like in the original he is not on a leash.,1420070400,,542,4.221153846153846
8081220,2,B000B0WOM6,"This is the episode that veers from a faith based baseline that I've come to count on from these awesome animated shows. I know there are many views out there but if you're looking for a Christian point of view, this episode brings the opinion that all religions are wonderful and we should accept anyone's faith. While I do agree with ""accepting the person"" the Bible is very clear that Christianity is NOT a ""religion"" but rather, a relationship with God through His Son Jesus.",1417651200,7,479,4.647058823529412
8081221,1,B000B0WOM6,"i read the warnings from others about the over the top political correctness found in this updated version of Davey & Goliath.  However, I decided to watch it for myself to draw my own conclusions.  Should not have wasted my time or money.

The production is great. Crystal Clear, Good Colors, Voices all done well.

BUT the video has nothing to do with Christmas.  The whole premise is about how Christians, Muslims and Jewish folks all have different traditions but they all teach similar things: Forgiveness, Love God, Respect Parents, etc.  Hinting that we all serve the same God.  There is nothing about the birth of the Savior, Son of God, Jesus Christ.  It is a film about a group of  multi-cultural friends going snowboarding.  And to everyone's surprise, the muslim girl is the best snowboarder - which they use to teach a lesson that girls can do anything that guys can do, and sometimes better.  The biggest problem is how these topics are presented to the viewer.  It is coming at you with a very deliberate agenda instead of just telling the story.

Again, it has NOTHING to do with Christmas, except there is snow on the ground.

It would be something you would expect the public school systems to show to the kids during the holidays to promote ""COEXIST"" bumpster sticker style, we are all the same, we all believe the same god, etc.

As others said, save your time and money.  Watch the old classic Christmas episode.

This movie reflects EXACTLY why the ELCA lutheran church is on the decline, apostate, and completely dead.",1416528000,16,1541,4.711610486891386

8081224,5,B000B0WOM6,"I gave it five stars because of the moral, ethical and religious content.  ALL of Davey and Goliath's shows/movies are of excellent moral character ALWAYS teaching us to do the right thing that is not just pleasing to God but to others.  REGARDLESS of your faith or lack thereof, Davey & Goliath's teachings about doing the right thing, helping others, being responsible AND holding yourself accountable, telling the truth and being honest, etc. is something that we ALL need and from the thirty-something's years and younger it is truly missing from their generations' lives and they desperately need for the most part.  It is what it is.  You will NOT be disappointed with Davey & Goliath and I highly recommend it to all ages.",1368489600,,729,4.854838709677419
