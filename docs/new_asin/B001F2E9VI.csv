It would be nice if they could or would give references to the films that they took their sources from so that if people like me wish to obtain them, they can.",1352419200,2,265,3.9074074074074074
8300647,5,B001F2E9VI,"I first saw these documentaries in San Francisco at one of the adult theaters off Market Street in San Francisco back in the early 70s.  I wanted to add them to my film collection and recommend the set to anyone that may want to get a glimpse into that era.  I was born and raised in San Francisco and the attitudes in the film were the same as the attitudes regarding the ""Sexual Revolution"" in the ""City"" at that time.  The documentary was made in the Netherlands and is in English.  It is a Documentary and discussions regarding sex and how to enjoy sex are graphically depicted using both real models and illustrations.  Well made and interesting.  STRONG SEXUAL CONTENT!  NOT A PORNO FLICK!",1265328000,8,695,4.556451612903226
