7788452,5,0764009303,"Originally broadcast in the UK in 1998/99 {and still no explination as to why it was never given a vhs release here}, Seeing Red is the true story of Coral Atkins, based on her book [some events have been dramatised for the purpose of TV].

An actress of the late 60's / early 70's, Coral was most notable for her role in the series 'Family At War'. In 1971, after becoming distressed at the plight of a child ~ Jessica ~  she meets when officially opening a childrens home, she determined to open her own home for disturbed children ~ for the ones no one else would take.

Standing her ground against those who said she couldn't even look after herself and her son, and managing to defeat the opposition of the authorities, Coral sets up and opens a beautiful home for 10 children. But that's the easy bit.

Every child has their own problems, and each one touches her heart ~ she has a unique understanding of them all: Amy, who is exceptionly shy; Wayne, who just wants respect; Kelly, who never had an infancy; and Jodie and Ann, sisters who are usually separated in care, who ultimately have a deep affect on Coral's own psyche.

Trying to run a home and be an actress is incrediblly tough, especially when the long-running series she is in suddenly ends. Coral copes as best she can, eventually finding a coveted stage role. But when two of the children are repeatedly removed from her care, Coral slides into a breakdown and is forced to confront her childhood nightmares.

But, there is a happy ending!

Coral attained her Child Psychology qualifications in 1980, and in total cared for 37 children.

Watching this {in 1998} inspired my interest in Child Psychology, and I believe anyone with an interest in this subject should certainly watch this programme.

Sarah Lancashire's performance is incredible ~ there are many moments when she had me in tears, portraying Coral's deep affections for these children.

NB: For those in the UK who saw its original broadcast in 1998/99, you may notice that the two Cat Stevens songs on the soundtrack have been replaced ~ I'm guessing due to rights issues. There is also a presenter introducing it, and commenting between the end & the credits.",1176336000,3,2195,4.677922077922078
7788453,5,0764009303,"I defy anyone to watch this drama, based on the life of a British TV actress who became a leading child care crusader, and firstly not cry, secondly not feel compelled to help as Coral Atkins did. Lancashire is perfect as the ballsy, party Girl who will stop at nothing to do right by her charges.

 Inspirational and beautiful.",1120435200,4,328,4.5423728813559325
7788454,5,0764009303,"""Seeing Red"" is the true story of Coral Atkins, a British actress who revolutionized foster care in the 70's. Her story starts when when she goes to a home for highly abused and disturbed children and hears a little girl named Jessica screaming and decides to open up a children's home. Some time later she buys a huge, ramshackle house and takes in the children who no one else will take, a little girl who screams from the moment she awakes until the moment she sleeps, a boy who burns down houses, another little girl who never speaks and is obsessed with washing her hands. Altogether, Coral took in 36 children in her lifetime.
The children, treated with respect and affection, as well as an intuitive knowledge of what their needs are slowly become a supportive family, until social services starts dragging them away to the same abusive parents who nearly destroyed them in the first place.
I cheered when she fired the matron who spanked one of the kids. On a side note, It is horrifying that 30 years later the state of Virginia has just made it legal for foster parents to hit children in their care, as if the abuse they suffered at home wasn't enough. Virginia legislators should really view this movie and THEN make a decision.
Ok, thats the main plot. There are a half dozen subplots carefully woven into the play, none of which I will tell you. I suppose I could pose one of the central questions of the movie: Why does Coral feel such empathy for these children?
This is, in some ways, in the same category as ""The Miracle Worker"" and ""Test of Love"", but along with the pathos there is a wonderful sense of humor that had me laughing and crying simultaneously. I hurt for the children and cheered them on, and (for once) even loved the child-saver. It becomes obvious that it isn't academic training that cures children, its a gift of empathy, gentleness and understanding their needs.",971913600,10,1901,4.610619469026549
