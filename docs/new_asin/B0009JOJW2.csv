8062226,3,B0009JOJW2,"I was a long time fan of ""All in the Family"", which is the prototype of the dysfunctional family, before ""Everybody Loves Raymond"".  I anticipated programs that dealt with personality traits,as advertised.  Only two episodes really focused on classical personality issues.  The first was a psychological card game, without Archie present, that focused upon Michael's rigid personality and unwillingness to accept healthy criticism from others--classical Jungian stuff.  Another dealt with Archie being challenged by Irene Lorenzo (Betty Garrett) to a pool game and Archie being cursed by Irene's husband, loosely unpacking Gary Smalley/John Trent's and Myron Madden's thesis of blessing and cursing in life and the psychological implications. Jean Stapleton's supposed near conversion to Catholicism and Archie's prejudices touched upon some principles of psychology of religion.  It was really a stretch for me to use this tape in my university course on ""Personality"".  Much of the references are dated to the '70's and requires the person administering the tape to go over with those watching some of the issues of that period.",1172102400,,1130,5.540697674418604
