8102537,5,B000DN5W1Q,"We found this DVD at our local library (it is not broadcast on our PBS station), and my girls have loved it ever since.  This DVD has about eight or ten short stories/ballets that teach a certain principle - fairness, individuality, importance of naptime - without being preachy or serious.  The lessons are always subtle and always sweet.  Really, it is just a joy to watch all the dancers express, dance and act out the stories.

This is NOT the nutcracker ballet.  There are certain melodies from the ballet and some dance moves, but it is really all original.  It is like Toy Story with all the toys in the castle coming alive at bedtime and having fun.  I highly recommend this for your young daughters and sons (half of the cast is male).",1183766400,3,744,4.507462686567164
