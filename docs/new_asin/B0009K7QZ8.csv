2296513,5,B0009K7QZ8,"The O.C. Season 2 is just as good as the first season. I like the fact that the show is not just about kids in high school, but also their parents and family and how they all interact. The cast is really good and believable enough to either make you love them or hate them. The show is very emotional at times and it is very addicting. I think what scared me away before I ever saw an episode was that I figured The O.C. was just another show about rich kids in California like Beverly Hills 90210 and/or Melrose place. The show is so much more than those other shows and has just the right amount of drama mixed in with just the right amount of heart. I highly recommend The O.C. for anyone who likes must see TV. This Complete Second season of The O.C. will be released on August 23rd, 2005 just in time for the premiere of season 3 in the Fall. This 7-DVD set will contain all 24 episodes from the second season, and a disc full of bonus material, too. The great news is that unlike season 1 season 2 will be in Widescreen. There will be an English Dolby Surround audio track, along with English, French and Spanish subtitles.

Here's a list of the bonus material you'll find on this:

The Wet and Wilde Kisses - outtakes from the ""Rainy Day Women"" episode

Beachy Couture: How O.C. Fashion Is Made

The O.C.: Obsessed Completely Retrospective TV Special

Gag and Goofs from Seasons 1 and 2

Extended cut of ""The Rainy Day Women""

Commentary on ""The Chrismukkah That Almost Wasn't"" and ""The Rainy Day Women"" by Cast and Crew",1115337600,140,1527,4.336842105263158
2296514,5,B0009K7QZ8,"I used to make fun of those what I thought were stereotypical teen drama shows. I used to make more fun of them if you were supposed to feel sorry for a bunch of troubled rich California kids. But let me tell you, 'The O.C.' is by far one of the best shows that has been on in quite some time. The storylines grab you and the continuity throughout the season flows. If you haven't picked season one up yet, I suggest you do, and get this one ASAP.",1115251200,8,447,4.033707865168539

Seeing the choices characters make that can change their lives leaves me looking for more to be uncovered.

This manufacturer needs to be taken off of Amazon's website permanently as they seem to have forgotten that DVDs are supposed to be watchable and not defective upon receiving. There are full episodes that you can not even watch. I got to the second disc, and it just decided to skip entire episodes. I tried everything from scene selections to selecting the individual episode. I got another copy instead of a refund.. HUGE mistake. I'll just have to take my money elsewhere and get a watchable copy.",1445212800,,661,4.471074380165289

2296668,5,B0009K7QZ8,"Fair warning, this will contain some spoilers from season 1 and plot lines (but no major spoilers) from the second season.

Season 2 of the OC was all about the various relationships and their strain after the events at the end of the first season played out.  Ryan was back in Chino with a pregnant Theresa and Seth having run away, sailing off into the sunset.  While those story lines were brought (somewhat) to a conclusion after the first episode of the season, the repercussions play out for the teenage characters and the adults all throughout the season.  The basic stories around the teenager relationships were the will-they/wont-they get back together for Ryan-Marissa and Seth-Summer.  A couple new characters get thrown into that mix, including Olivia Wilde joining the cast as a recurring character for most of the season.  The adult relationships are also strained throughout the season.  Sandy and Kirsten are both tempted with straying, and there Julie/Caleb/Jimmy triangle for part of the season.

Overall the second season has less jumping from story line to story line that season one did.  There is still some of that, but it is clear what the focus of the season was.  It benefited from paring down some of the cast, although more recurring characters did appear throughout the season, you did not have as many episodes where someone would totally disappear or have nothing to do.  The show kept its blend of witty comedy, family drama and trashy soap opera going this season.  I thought it really found its footing and even made fun of itself a little.

Toward the end of the season they put a twist on the initial season one story line when they brought back Ryan's brother Trey (recast and played by Logan Marshall-Green).  His arrival did well to play kind of a doppelganger  like version of Ryan's story and play the differences between the two characters.  The season also dealt with issues like infidelity, alcoholism, same-sex relationships, rape and drug use. The show did not dive into the deeper stories all the time, but when it did I think they were well done.  Like in the first season it is enjoyable enough to watch as an adult even outside the ""targer"" age group of those that were in high school or college back in the mid 2000s.

As far as extras go, most are on the final disc in the set.  There are gag reels from season 1 and season 2, a half hour retrospective on the first season and the wild popularity the show had right out of the gate, and then a 12 minute feature on the style and fashions on the show.  There is also commentary on select episodes and a few deleted scenes spread throughout the other discs.  All in all, enough to make the people who like going through the bonus material happy.  The AV quality is about what you would expect from and older DVD set.  Okay, but not as good as newer shows.",1410220800,,2856,4.634194831013916

2296711,5,B0009K7QZ8,"The second series is even better than the first IMO.
Huge value, there are 24 episodes just in this season.
There was no skipping/DVD damage, even though these discs were preloved.
The plastic case for the first dvd is damaged so it doesn't keep the disc contained when the box is open and you are trying to swap discs around. But that's a very small problem, and acceptable considering this was a 2nd hand item. And since this was the only thing that was wrong with it. Some of the discs looked a bit less than pristine but didn't effect play.

No spoilers here. Seth, Summer, Zach and Ryan and Marisa are now fully formed characters exploring their lives.
The season ends on a huge shocking cliffhanger.",1398384000,,705,4.551181102362205

2296755,5,B0009K7QZ8,"Alright, I will start this off by admitting that I am a 27 year old male and my friends gather once a year for an OC marathon weekend.  I promise you it is much cooler than it sounds.  Anyway, for the second annual this year we threw in season 2 after seeing that it was only $9.99 (now $11.99 at this writing).  Let me tell you, while often overlooked as a letdown to a spectacular Season 1, Season 2 brings the heat.  I think this has been forgotten over time.  Clearly, it deserves a number 2 ranking (1,2,4, worst season ever: 3) in the OC season pantheon.

Yes, there are some misses: Mallpisode, Any scene with Mischa Barton that did not include Olivia Wilde, Lindsay/Ryan awful romance, most of the Zach/Seth comic book stuff, and of course DJ trying to steal Ryan's thunder as Marissa's boyfriend who doesn't talk.

But to judge a season you need to look at the hits, and there were many: Great Caleb season all around, Kiki's drinking problem (fresh margs anyone?), Olivia Wilde incredible breakout lesbian performance, The Bait Shop somehow becoming the number 1 performing venue in the country, Christmakkuh 2, Julie Coops, and Summer/Seth Spiderman scene.  Plus, WHO KILLED CALEB?  Spoiler.

You could probably skip like 6-8 episodes (since theres 24 which is absurd) to enjoy this even more.  I recommend drinking heavily while watching.",1324339200,2,1350,4.775862068965517

Turns out that person is me, I am embarrassed to admit.  Sure, I got into the show after it was on the air, but I am absolutely and totally hooked.  I am halfway through the second season and had to keep watching to find out whose the drugs were during the episode where Marissa had the birthday party for Trey and it got out of control and a girl overdosed and ended up in the pool.  Oops, spoiler, but this show is like video crack.

But I know why it is.  The acting is quite good, the writing is clever and the reactions of the characters to the sometimes crazy situations on the show are genuine.  I particularly like Kirsten and Sandy.  Sandy isn't self righteous and Kirsten could have been written as a rich bitch, but she isn't.  I like Ryan too.  Sure, Benjamin McKenzie is really nice to look at but his character is interesting and you want to know what he is going to say and do next.  I agree with one of the previous posters.  The kids talk normally and whatever they say isn't overloaded with pop culture references they themselves do not seem to understand and wouldn't make in real life, like on the once good Gilmore Girls or the horrid Dawson's Creek.

After last season's heart-tugging finale, the whole gang is back for junior year at Harbor, but Seth and Ryan find their girlfriends have moved on and found new loves.  The guys are no slouches, either:  A new lab partner spells romance for Ryan, and Seth falls for the wild and worldly manager at the Bait Shop.  Meanwhile, the adults are in for lots of drama as Caleb and Julie have marital problems, both Sandy and Kirsten feel the urge to merge with other people, and even the Nana in Miami gets lucky...maybe.  One main character will leave the O.C. for good and one (or two?) will die.

What a season!  The plotlines combine comedy and pathos effortlessly, the characters we came to love in season one continue to evolve, and the writing is superb.  This DVD includes lots of behind-the-scene cool stuff and fun bloopers that were sadly missing from the season one DVDs.

2296811,4,B0009K7QZ8,"I enjoyed Season 2 of ""The O.C.""  Granted it wasn't as great as Season 1, but it's still up there right below it.  The reason I knocked off a star is that there were too many predictable moments.  Too many set ups that were so far fetched that it was absurd.  This was in the little things such as characters showing up at another characters door when they have no idea where they live, but wanted to pop by to tell them three sentences.  No one would do that in real life.  I realize this isn't real life, but make believe TV, but at least in Season 1, they made it as believable as possible.

Some spoilers up ahead, but I'm assuming at this point those who wanted to see this show have already done so, if not, then don't read on as I might ruin it for you.  This was a darker season where everything really seemed to go wrong especially with the main O.C. couple Sandy and Kirsten.  The writers pushed them both to teeter on that fine line of having affairs, which is really out of character of who they were in Season 1.  And then making Kirsten fall into alcoholism, which her character would never have got that vulnerable.  Suddenly Sandy is trying to send her to rehab.  So what, she's been hitting the bottle a little too much for a few months.  Sending her to rehab that quickly seemed too unusual.

There were some finer moments and the actress that does play Kirsten showcased some strong acting chops in this.  I liked that they made Julie Cooper more likable in this season, even though know you can't entirely trust her, but you longer look at her with venom as you did in Season 1.  The ridiculousness with the kids was irritating at times.  Summer not knowing whether she wants to stay with Zach or Seth. Speaking of Seth, he grew more irritating in this season.  Even the characters around him were getting to the point of rolling their eyes.  There was a nice addition to the cast in a number of episodes with actress Olivia Wilde, who would later become the more famous actor coming out of the O.C.  She played a rough tough chick running a bar.  She has a romance with Seth as well as Marissa.  Speaking of which, Marissa Cooper was a little more likable in this season over the previous season.  She was a little more grounded and less reactive over everything that Ryan does or says, but then again they were barely together as a couple in this season until towards the end.

While this was still a good dish and a guilty pleasure, it had one too many absurdities where situations felt way too contrived and controlled by the writers just to force a dramatic plot to happen.  Despite my criticisms with this Season, I still enjoyed it.",1152662400,,2659,4.3885480572597135

But the everything turns upside down when Trey Ryan's brother walks back into Ryan's life...affecting not only him but everyone else that is involved with Ryan, especailly Marrisa.

Having said that let me start with the second season was NO WHERE NEAR as good as the first season.  There are whole episodes in this season that are just a total bore.  There are a few good toward the end, but the whole middle of the season when ryan is dating lindsey and they find out lindsey is calebs daughter... all of that is boooooring.  The season only starts getting good after Rainy Day Women and even after that there are some dull episodes!  All in all i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the OC its a really good show.  Although lately i've been watching it more out of habit than it being a good show.  The third season so far is not really good altho it is just now starting to get good.  Figures that would start happening with only 5 episodes left! LOL But all in all the first half of the second season not worth it.. the second half is aight",1145059200,4,1019,4.045

2296830,5,B0009K7QZ8,"If you've already seen season 1, buying season 2 is a MUST! Actually, I would be surprised if anyone who has seen season 1 hasn't seen season 2 yet. Luckily I purchased both of these season sets at the same time. The extreme emotional cliffhanger on the finale of season 1 was hard enough without having to wait for season 2 to arrive so I could see what happened. Like I said, I'm glad I purchased both at the same time!

Well, rest assured that things get back to 'normal' in the OC right off the bat during this season! But, like any fan will know, 'normal' in the OC is a little different than you might expect. I don't want to spoil too much, but I can't resist spilling a few of the obvious details. Ryan and Seth are back as the unbeatable Newport Harbor duo, but what will Marissa and Summer's reactions be? Remember, Ryan left back to Chino to be with Teresa and the baby.  And Seth couldn't bare to lose his best friend after his life had changed so much for the better, so he left everyone behind as he sailed into the Pacific.  All the answers are in the premier, so watch and see.

Naturally, the second season is filled with just as many surprises as the first, but you'll have to watch it to find out more. For any OC fan, this is a must! If you've thought about watching The O.C., but you don't think you'd like it, just give it a try and you won't be sorry! Please, though, buy both seasons together and you'll thank yourself later! Don't get caught in that cliffhanger without being able to pop in the first disc of season two. After you watch one episode of The O.C., you'll see what I mean!

Highly recommended to all!",1139961600,,1638,4.254019292604502
2296831,5,B0009K7QZ8,"Season 2 is just as good as season 1, if not better. After the season 1 cliffhanger, the season opens with Seth Cohen somewhere in Oregon, refusing to come home to boring and snootie Orange County, now that all the fun has gone - see down to earth Ryan leaving the OC to become a dad back in Chino.

The two boys gone, the girls, Marissa and Summer, waste away, one in anger (Summer), the other in pain and addiction (Marissa). To soothe the pain both girls get involved with other people and when the boys Seth and Ryan finally return, the plot thickens. It takes most of the season to sort the various love stories out and on the way we get treated to some very daring television in the Marissa story line and some very funny humor in the Seth/Summer saga.

The adults in the story are very entertaining too in this season, especially the diabolical Mrs Cooper, the character we all love to hate ;-)We also get to meet Ryan's older brother, that throws more than one spanner in the works and is very much involved in the obligatory end of season cliffhanger.

Waiting for season 2 to know how it all ends :-)",1135382400,4,1110,4.352657004830918
2296832,5,B0009K7QZ8,"Season 2 is definately better. Of course the first season was still very good, this one has been the best yet.(Last season there was too much sex) There is a really good story line, especially near the end of the season with Trey. In my opinion, the best episode is ""The Dearly Beloved"". It was so sad, but really dramatic and very good. Another reason to purchase it is for the great music on every episode. Overall an awesome season and totally worth buying.",1133913600,3,460,4.488095238095238
2296833,1,B0009K7QZ8,"the first season was amazing.  It took you on a roller coaster ride of emotions ending in the most heart breaking, torturing, cliffhanger, ever.

that brings me to season two. i knew it was going down hill when

1.  the second ryan got back him and marissa didn't get back together

2.  summer got a new boyfriend zack, that was basically a hotter version of seth

3.  sandy and kirsten almost fought ever episode.

ALL OF THIS LED TO THE BIGGIEST REASON WHY THIS SEASON IS CRAP

All in all the O.C. continues to be great and is my second favorite show next to One Tree Hill.  This is definately a must buy for any die hard O.C. fan.,1131840000,,439,4.117647058823529
2296835,5,B0009K7QZ8,"Let me start by saying that I have no life. I am almost 30 years old and on Thursday nights I can't wait to sit down and watch as the lives of Ryan, Seth, Marissa, Summer, Julie, Sandy, Kirsten and the rest of the Newport elite unfold before my eyes. Maybe I am drawn to the show so that I can live vicariously through other people, but it doesn't matter. This is a show I don't miss.

And even though I don't miss it, I found this DVD set to be fantastic, a welcome addition to a collection that is both eclectic and growing.

Of course I never expected The O.C. to be as strong in the second season as it was in the first. After exploding on to the scene in its first season, there was sure to be a letdown and there was, but that doesn't change the fact that this is still an enjoyable television show with some great characters, solid writing and some good acting.

The season opens where the first season left off (naturally) with Seth in Portland with Luke and his dad after sailing away in the season one finale. Ryan is back in Chino, living with Theresa, who is pregnant with their baby. Kirsten is knocked out by the departure of her two kids and has turned to the bottle a little more than normal. Sandy copes with her and the ongoing construction in the Cohen household. Marissa, with Ryan departing for Chino, has also hit the bottle and has been forced to live with her mother (Julie) and step-father (Caleb). Her father (Jimmy) is taking it easy on a boat with Kirsten's sister Hailey (Guest star Amanda Righetti) and Summer is still reeling from the departure of Seth and is trying to rid  herself of anything pertaining to him.

Okay, now that we're caught up on where everyone is, it is time to talk about where everyone goes and in Season Two, some people certainly went places.

Early on, Hailey took a job in Japan, jilting Jimmy, (Tate Donovan) who in a moment of desperation, proposes to her. Of course the Japan job was just a way to right Righetti out of the show so she could concentrate on the short-lived North Shore, which had debuted in the summer. Jimmy eventually also sailed away, which will be noted later.

Theresa, noticing that Ryan (Ben McKenzie) seemed distant and basically still in love with Marissa (Mischa Barton), lied to him, telling him that she lost the baby and basically pushing him back to Newport and the Cohen's beach house. It becomes quickly obvious that she still has the baby, and this certainly can be a story line in season three and beyond. Preparing to return to Newport, Ryan, at Sandy's urging, goes to Portland to convince Seth (Adam Brody) to return and the two make a triumphant return to Newport Beach.

Of course, Marissa and Summer (the delicious Rachel Bilson) are not immediately receptive of their two Knights in shining armor. Marissa has spent the summer drinking away the days and hooking up with the lawn boy, while Summer was devastated by Seth's departure and wants noting to do with him when he returns.

Julie (Melinda Clarke) and Caleb's (Alan Dale) strange marriage continues to take even stranger turns, as Caleb is indicted and eventually is forced to reveal that he fathered a child with another woman while married to Kirsten's mother.

And things continue to get interesting from there. Lindsay (Shannon Lucio), Caleb's illegitamite daughter, and Ryan begin dating before realizing just what the situation is with her father. The story line with Lindsay started out very strong, but fizzled out near the end, although it is questionable why she at least didn't come back for Caleb's funeral in the final episode. After all, he is her father.

Summer moved on from Seth, meeting Zack, (Michael Cassidy) a water polo player who is interested in comics. Seth is torn between his friendship with Zack and his relationship with Summer. The triangle is a fantastic arc through the whole season and Cassidy, of the four new guest stars this season, lasted the longest and deservedly so. His Zack was someone you could root for, making it hard to hate him when he took Summer from Seth. The trio put together a graphic novel (Atomic County) and even pitched it to a couple reps with interesting results, including an all-out fight between Seth and Zack in a comic book store.

Seth, with Summer seeking comfort with Zack, dated wild child Alex, a tattooed-club manager (Olivia Wilde). Alex was a great addition to the show for the time she was there, dating Seth and then eventually getting in a relationship with Marissa. The storyline with her was strong, like the LIndsay storyline, but eventually wore out. However, her club The Bait Shop, became a great set with bands playing in many different episodes.

The Marissa and Alex relationship was only one of a few stories for Marissa. She also hooked up with DJ (Nicholas Gonzalez) her family's yard guy. That relationship pissed off Julie and eventually came to an end. The story line was never built strongly, and probably thankfully, as there became so many characters to focus on.

Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) suffered through their toughest year of marriage yet, as they were both tempted by others outside of their union. Sandy's ex Rebecca (Kim Delaney) returned for a short arc and Kirsten found herself attracted to Carter (Billy Campbell) an editor assigned to the Newport Group's new magazine. His departure pushed her further toward the bottle and eventually into rehab as the season concluded.

Julie found herself cheating on Caleb with her ex, Jimmy. When the two were caught by Marissa, Jimmy figured the best thing to do was to get out and he sailed to Hawaii, only to return in the finale and in the start of season three. Caleb, possibly one of the creepiest men on television, also caught Julie with another ex, Lance (Johnny Messner). Lance managed to show Newport more of Julie than they every imagined, with a porn tape from her past. Caleb filed for divorce, but a heart attack, his second of the season, did him in in the season's penultimate episode. Ironically, Julie had called him to the house to basically poison him, but couldn't bring herself to do it.

Ryan's brother, Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) also gave Newport living a try after being released from jail. He brought not only trouble, but some good story lines as well, as he tried to mend his former ways. Getting high and hitting on Marissa changed everything between the three (Ryan, Marissa and Trey) and eventually led to the shocking final scene, as Marissa shoots Trey as he and Ryan fight.

As I have said, I am addicted to this show, so I was bound to like this set. But the two commentary tracks added a good insight to the show, as did a good blooper reel, a feature on fashion and the Obsessed Completely special that ran prior to the start of the season.

All in all, a fine effort. California, here we come indeed.",1131235200,6,6868,4.661983471074381
2296836,1,B0009K7QZ8,"I'm disappointed that The OC S2 wasn't as good as the first.

Firstly, Josh Schwartz is going to have a hell bad time trying to think up more dramatic ideas for this drama series, because the thing is, he already used all of it for S2!

Season 2 was just this ordinary TV Show with DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA! every 5 seconds...which doesn't pull us into the show much since the whole season goes past without looking into the problems ""The Fantastic Four"" faces.

It's like, ""OH MY GOD what'll happen to Alex and Marissa?"" and by the time you're trying to figure it all out, Alex departs so immediately (and she decides that ALL in the last 10 minutes of an episode, I'll tell you) and we'll never remember who she was. Buh-bye Miss Kelly!

In Season 1, there was the chemistry...the good acting...and some drama which seemed, very realistic. Season 2 is just a scrabbled mush of sloppy drama episodes. Not only is that bad...but it puts off almost everyone seeing ""The OC"" for the first time, right from Season 2.

Sandy and Kirsten's marriage was challenged on multiple fronts; Julie was nearly taken down, but showed her true self when Caleb had the heart attack; Poor Seth was so heartbroken for most of the season but he came back strong, and finally Ryan faced difficult challenges after spending a year trying to be a better person.

2296892,4,B0009K7QZ8,"While the scripts, stories and acting aren't as wonderful as the brillaint first season of this great show, it still is a darned good show. However, there are some improvements that make this season great.

While last year she was a little over dramatic and not teen-like, Mischa Barton has improved in her role of Marissa Cooper this year. I personally think she should stop playing teenagers. The girl did Shakespeare off-Broadway when she was 7. Maybe she's too good of an actress to play Marissa, or maybe she just doesn't have chemistry with Ben McKenize. As Ryan, McKenzie shows a softer, less violent side this year, however, his look for the role is still better than his acting.

And now to the two gems of the show, Adam Brody and Rachel Bilson, as nerotic geek Seth Cohen and typical beach girl Summer Roberts. These two are probably the performers with the best comic timing and maybe the best acting abilty, second only to Peter Gallagher. How both of them have been overlooked for Emmys is very sad.

Peter Gallagher is an idol to many up and coming actors. He has tremednous range. He can play crooks comically like in ""Mr. Deeds"" and musically like in the stage revivals of ""Pal Joey"" and ""Guys and Dolls."" However, I think Sandy Cohen will be the role he is best remembered for. Not only is he the center of the show, but he is the best characther. As his wife, Kelly Rowan shows a lot of growth this year, especially with her alcholic story line.

As Caleb Nichol, Alan Dale continues to be dreadfully boring and stuck up. However, I must say my new favorite adult woman on the show is Julie Cooper. With an obviosuly good sense of comic timing and great, still comic, acting skills, she has improved much this year.

Tate Donovan, who appeared in the finale and at the beginning of this season as Jimmy Cooper also is a strong moral center of the show.

While last year told the stories of the four central teens, this year some others entered their lives, mainly Zach, played by an actor who's name I can't recall and Alex, played by Oliva Wilde. While these kids were pretty good, they will probably not be as well remembered as Samaire Armstrong's charachter of Anna.

And as Trey, Mr. What's his name (sorry, I forgot the actor's name) is also just as brooding as McKenzie, but a much better actor. The atempted rape scene in episdoe 21 was scary and realistic, one of the best scenes all season.

This year, most of the memorable and well written episodes are by brillaint series creator Josh Schwartz. If only they'd do more audio commentaries and give us some more bonuse.

FOX should be proud of this show, it isn't your average Teen Soap.",1125273600,5,2666,4.560669456066946

2296906,5,B0009K7QZ8,"In television, realism is often jettisoned in favor of the unusual and surreal. The idea is that people don't want to see their OWN lives on their TV screen - they want to see moderately believable characters living out circumstances that those in the real world can only fantasize about and imagine happening to them.

Fortunately, we are occasionally graced with shows like the OC, which remind us that real life is just as good - nay, better! - than anything TV can offer us.

This show is about several terrifically good-looking people who live near beaches that, evidently, only allow good-looking people to use them....come to think of it, everyone in this show is good-looking, with the exception of marginal characters who are either comic foils, or who eventually get proven wrong about whatever it is on which they disagree with main characters.

As in real life, these good-looking folks always have something clever to say, so the dialogue is witty and taut. Sometimes, I swear it's my friends and I talking, because this is (as we know) how real people interact.

True to its referent - real life -, there is always some sort of scandal or trying situation in SOMEONE'S life. I've noticed that, generally, there are two major situations transpiring at about the same time, with several smaller, sometimes comical, situations underway also. Since this closed group of people mostly sticks together, all of these situations interrelate in such a way as to gradually make the characters grow together and bond. This crazy dynamic seems to also result in MY bonding with the characters - I feel like I really know them! Perhaps it's because they're so realistic; they remind me of real people that I know in real life.

One other small detail that I've noticed, that demonstrates the level of attention to detail these talented and intellectually profound thinkers have taken in developing this show, is that (just like in the real world) nobody ever has to go to the bathroom. I never have to go, so it's nice to see that neither do these walking reflections of reality.

In short, this show is NOTHING like the bulk of television out there - artificial and unbelievable. No, with the OC, you will sometimes wonder just exactly WHERE the line is between truth and fiction.

Thanks for reading my review! I'm off to the beach where only beautiful people go! Fortunately, my tan is PERFECT, but even if it weren't, I could always just take my exotic sports car to the mall instead, and spend the large sums of money that I earn from my job as a flashy and high-paid lawyer. That's what all of we Californians do. We make money. And live large. It's beautifully real.",1124755200,2,2674,4.762419006479481

Then it was it, I was hooked.

My opinion on season 2 is very clear: it's great!

The most believable characters are Kirsten & Marissa. However, the others tend to parody themselves. I think it's cute though...

The best storylines have been, I think,

- The Summer/Seth on & off again...

- The character of Alex

- Kirsten's drinking problem

The worst:

- Lindsay

- Zach

- Rebecca

The best songs in this season:

- Non-Photo Blue & Fortress: Pinback

- Eve, the apple of my eye: Bell X1

- you got me all wrong: Dios Malos

- Somersault: Zero 7

- the reason why & worn me down : Rachael Yamagata

- baby you should know: joy zipper

2296910,1,B0009K7QZ8,"I loved The O.C. Season 1. I was introduced to the first season by a friend, and after watching the first episode, I immediately bought the dvd collection.

That said, when Season 2 came on tv, I was not impressed. What was once fresh writing, was now stilted and formulaic. After I watched the first seven episodes or so, I had to stop watching. While new characters were introduced the the inbred community that did make the show worth watching, the story line was so parallel. For example, if Ryan asked a girl out in one episode, Seth did the same. I began to feel like Seth and Ryan were living parallel lives. And the end of each episode would eerily wrap up the drama, while featuring the flavor-of-the-week band in a convenient concert.

It's sad because I really did love Season 1, but I feel like I could never see the end of Season 2 and my life wouldn't change. Maybe I have been spoiled by shows such as 24, Alias, and Lost, but a show has to provide some suspense.

Ryan becomes a ""good boy"" while Marissa has a fling with a girl, Sandy and Kirsten become the antithesis of the perfect couple, and Julie shows she has more depth than her perfectly crafted facade admits.  Sometimes these changes work.  It's facinating to watch Marissa navigate through her bourgeoning sexuality and rebellion, and Sandy and Kirsten's marriage problems make the adults much more interesting than they ever have been.  However, Ryan's new good boy routine makes him lose most of his appeal, and many of the plot lines were either dropped between seasons or changed in a way that makes them completely unbelievable.

However, I didn't watch the entire season when it first aired because I wasn't home most of the time, I got really hooked when I picked up the Boxset a couple months ago. Anyway, I was really excited about Season 2, but I do have to say that I was a bit disappointed at first. The season started off a bit bland and boring. The character Lindsay was really not needed in the show and that whole storyline took too long. Lindsay was a really boring and annoying person and I personally found the season to become much better right after she left. And then ofcourse Ryan's brother Trey came in and made things even better and the show worth watching. Oh and we can't forget about Alex, Seth's gf and Marissa's gf. That was definetely a plus for the show and an unexpected turn. Anyway, this boxset is definetely worth buying because although the season starts off a bit slow it does pick up the O.C. pace that it had in the first season, and you honestly can't miss those episodes because they did carry important information that would later be tied with the rest of the season. So I recommend you go ahead and buy this. It's worth your money.

Oh and don't forget to tune in to FOX on September 8 at 8/7c for the premiere of Season 3. It will definetely shock you. The season will be amazing, and for those who have seen the preview for the premiere episode, The Aftermath, you KNOW what I am talking about.

Now, Season 2 was just as cleverly written and just as cleverly acted as Season 1, with the exception of Mischa Barton who just plain annoys me now. Adam Brody and Peter Gallagher should seriously be considered for Best Actor/Supporting Actor in a Comedy/Drama. Hell, if Desperate Housewives can be nominated for an Emmy, why can't The O.C.? Those two have me cracking up week after week. Just hearing those two themselves will be worth the money. There were some annoying and plain unneeded characters this season, such as D.J. Someone remind why he was there please cuz I can't figure it out for the life of me. Alex could have made season 3 very interesting if they kept her. Zach needs to go. I can't begin to tell you how annoying his character has become. He's just so pseudo Prince Charming that it makes me ill. He better not be back for season 3. Julie Cooper-Nichol's little porno incident was HILARIOUS, and followed through with an interesting storyline, a very interesting storyline. Luke needs to move back because Newport is blah without him being all, Luke-like. By far, Trey was the BEST character this season, which is a lot for a new character coming in mid-season. His storyline was executed so well that it gave me goosebumps. The only thing that was kinda stupid was the Jen chick that just moved into his apartment. She did however, add some intrigue and suspense into the show, but we still don't know much about her. Hopefully she doesn't disappear like Lindsey. She was such an awesome character and completely perfect for Ryan, which is why I felt it for him when her last episode was ""The Rainy Day Women"". Yes, I downloaded the episodes that I missed, so I know the titles. I must say, I loved to hate Caleb Nichol, but I shed a tear when he had the heart attack at the pool. It was the most moving moment of the season, by far. As much as he was a horse's ass, he will be missed. The writer's of the season finale should get an Emmy also. That was the most riveting episode ever, and totally did not see the last 5 minutes coming. If you haven't seen season 1, I suggest you watch it first before watching season 2, because a lot of the jokes will go over your head, and you won't understand a lot of the conflict. Ben McKenzie needs to applause, he's just incredible, absolutely incredible. That is one awesome actor. Kelly Rowan moved me to tears in her departure on the season finale also. There is so much emotion involved in the finale, that I strongly advise you to grab a box of tissues because regardless of how tough you may think you are, you will get some ""eye allergies"" during this touching season finale.

Yes, Lindsey was a toy. They didn't even bring her back for Calebs funeral! WHAT WAS THAT!? Out of the four new teen characters none stayed until the end. They need to add a new character!

Marissa became a joke not only because of the way the character was written but because of the actress playing her.

2296925,5,B0009K7QZ8,"Many people seem to have been disappointed with Season Two of THE O.C., but I can't count myself among them. The show definitely had a more adult feel, even in the teen story lines, and the overall mood was definitely more somber. Whether this is an improvement or a decline will largely depend on one's personal preferences. As a whole, I found Season Two consistently held my attention and always left me concerned about the fate of the major characters.

Personally, I liked one thing about Season Two a lot, and that is the way they slowed down the developments in relationships. How many times did Ryan and Marisa break up and get back together in Season One? Too many times for me to find it believable. How many times did they break up in Season Two? None. How many times did they get back together? Once. I personally found that far more satisfying than the relational seesaw of Season One. The road to true love for Seth and Summer was a tad bumpier, but I liked the patience they displayed in developing even that more mercurial plot line.

As with Season One, the story arcs involving the adults were as interesting or perhaps more interesting than those for the teens. Sandy Cohen just might be my favorite character on television these days, with the exception of several on LOST. What I love about him is his absolute dedication to living by a moral code, and sticking to that code even when it complicates other relationships. When an old flame returns to town, he helps her even though it hurts his marriage by making Kirsten jealous. But despite the fact that he knows Kirsten is jealous, he sticks with doing what he knows is right. Television has had in its history few believable moral characters. Most do-gooders seems cardboard at best, but Sandy Cohen is seems more like flesh and blood. But it is a tough year for Kirsten, simultaneously bothered by Sandy's helping his ex-girlfriend and smitten by the new editor hired to help with her company's new magazine. The twin pressures of what she senses as betrayal by Sandy (even if she is wrong) and the temptation represented by her coworker drive her to drink more and more heavily, resulting in her being sent at the end of the season to a treatment center for alcoholism.

As much as I love most things on THE O.C., there have been some things I have had a hard time stomaching each year. In Season One it was the cardboardish Luke Ward and the absolutely horrific Oliver, and the unlikable Caleb Nichol in both. Also hard to take in Season Two was Alex Kelly, who managed to be--briefly--a bad girlfriend to Seth and a jealous lesbian girlfriend for Marisa. The problem is that her character never managed to become anything more than two-dimensional, and was perhaps even less interesting with Marisa than she had been with Seth. I also have not enjoyed Julie Cooper-Nichol in either season. She brings a DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES element to the show that I don't find especially welcome, and always seems to be the one recurring character of the show that is more a cardboard cartoon than well-conceived individual. She did become a bit more interesting towards the end, especially in the final episode where she pulls back from poisoning Caleb, who is intending to divorce her, only to find him at the bottom of the swimming pool after suffering a heart attack.

The character with the toughest season was, by far, Marisa. After Ryan returns, her hopes of getting back together with him are squashed when he discovers that she is in the final throes of a fling with a gardener. She then struggles with alcohol and a up-and-down lesbian relationship before reuniting with Ryan before an attempted rape by Ryan's brother and her killing him in the finale while he is apparently beating Ryan to death. Ah, the very stuff of high class soap opera.

What keeps THE O.C. from drifting down into the same depths as other soap operas is the overall sharpness of the writing, the vividly conceived and executed characters, and the show's unwillingness to sink into pathos. In fact, from beginning to end the show toys more with self-irony than pathos.

Having avoided a sophomore slump, I hope that the show continues on to an excellent third season. In one way, a show like this is much harder to keep going than a show like LOST or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Those shows were able to structure their narrative around a host of stories. THE O.C., like THE GILMORE GIRLS and similar shows, depends on conflicts between characters. Here's hoping they can keep it going a third season.",1122336000,6,4547,4.698870765370138
2296926,5,B0009K7QZ8,"COMPARISON

So ye there's a big debate with people comparing the OC season two with season one and in my humble opinion; this is mistake number one. They do not need to be compared. Seaon two is different to season one in so many ways that it ended up disappointing loads of fans. Season one was all about the producers making sure they had a show. We all loved that there was a brand new issue/story line explored in each one hour-long episode. It gave the OC a thrill that no other TV show does and hooked us straight way. But you had to realise that it couldn't go on like that forever, they were simply going to run out of story lines. That made this season completely different, more time was spent developing the characters and less on cheap thrills. Also, season 1 was always described as the 'fish out of water' story and by the last episode, even though ironically our fish Ryan leaves, the story is complete. This makes the focus of the plot of season 2 entirely different as well. So don't get me wrong; I adored season 1 and continue to adore it on DVD. The two are equally good as each other and some people were just reluctant to accept the necessary changes. I am completely obsessed with the OC and season one wil probably always be my favourite season just because it's the first and it is just really really juicy (don't critisize the word choice it explains what i mean well). Season 2 is by no means as juicy but i highly recommend it because it is equally if not more witty, sharp, poignant, funny, entertaining and the music is equally as amazing as the first box set. so as long as you don't expect quite as many cheap thrills; this box set will not dissapoint. It is a more mature and edgier show and i guarantee it made me cry loads more than i did in season one (please respect that this is saying something). Also, I seem to be the only person to notice that season two has 3 less episodes than seaaon 1 but i promise you the extras on these DVDs make up for it. The extras on the season one box-set seemed a bit of an afterthought whereas in this box-set they are great. I see absolutely no reason why not to bu these DVDs if you have any interest at all in the show; you can watch them over and over again and feel like you're seeing something new every time.",1122249600,3,2288,4.259770114942529

2296928,3,B0009K7QZ8,"***WARNING: Spoliers***

The OC really strayed this second season . I think the main problem was creator Josh Shwartz left this season mostly up to new writers that terribly corrupted the show. Josh only wrote the first episode, the Rainy Day Women in the middle of the season, and the last story arc in the end of Season 2.

Anywho, ***THE STORY***

The story from the beginning was silly. Ryan came back to Newport right away. Marissa has a little thing with Hispanic lawn guy. Lawn guy has no story or really any lines. He sillily acts along with Marissa who cries about crap.

Meanwhile, Seth-Summer-Zach triangle gets old and corny... and not the corny good. Seth was corny in Season 1, and we loved him for that, but this corny sucks.

Lesbianism between Alex and Marissa was neither hot, nor serious. In this situation, Marissa once again is shown as dumb and shallow little girl. Things went awry with Ryan, so she needs to experiment with Alex and actually live with the girl of which she then faces cleaning and paying rent. I was looking forward to the hookup, but unfortunately, teleplay and script never furnished a turn on. Pitiful. One Tree Hill did a much better, serious job with the lesbian issue.

Lindsay was such a nice girl. I liked her intelligent spunk. She went well with Ryan. They actually had good chemistry onscreen. However, writers shipped her off as well as other guest stars and even main stars!

Tate Donovan's leaving was a shame. Luckily he is back as a regular for next season. He has such a warmn character.

Meanwhile, both Sandy and Kirsten go off and be unfaithful and oblivious

The highpoint and redeeming part of the season, which showed a glimmer with Rainy Day Women midseason, began with the entrance of Trey, Ryan's brother. He added a freshness of character to the show. We wondered whether he was bad or not, just like Ryan felt. His crime against Marissa shocked us all, and the final confrontation between the two brothers was core TV at its best. Meanwhile, the climax of Kirsten's drinking problem was a stunner with the truck, and her sending off was quite moving. The intimate talk between Seth and Sandy showed finally that there was heart behind these characters, and that there was indeed a family.

***THE CAST***

All the guest star either sucked or were given terrible story lines. DJ, the lawn boy, was nothing. Zach was just a corny, repetitively annoying nothing. Alex and Lindsay were decent, but then disappeared.

Ryan was a pale shadow of his former self. No more action for him. No longer the outsider, there was not real much imminent trouble for him, but we need that for the hero of the story. Also, aging must have done him badly. Already showing in Season 1, he has gained much facial weight. I suspect even bodily weight, too! When we first saw Ryan in Season 1, he has a nice, angular face. However, with Season 2, he no longer has that sleek body. I think he caught on, because he improved bodily for the finale. I think the problem was that he may have focused on lifting rather than running. Bad idea. Our hero does not need to be a body builder.

Marissa must not have been very enthusiastic this season, for her acting was terrible. Please recall when she made that silly scream and threw the chair into pool to tell Julie what she was feeling. It was real terrible. All Marissa did this season was whine, cry, or giggle. To add to that, she was not that hot anymore. The OC costume person needs to be fired. Season 1 had Marissa in all these designer clothes with tight, short skirts and such. This season had Marissa in punk clothes with ugly jeans and shirts. Her look was all off. When we first met Marissa, she had this mysterious aura about her --- a sexy look and glance. It is gone. What is also gone is that she has lost weight. Twigs are not good-looking.

Speaking of weight, Summer has also lost some. She has shrunken. When you lose weight, you lose it in ALL areas. Summer does not have that killer body she had in Season 1. Just compare the bathing suit scenes of Summer and Marissa from the two seasons. Anywho, with the story, Summer is not as interesting as she used to be. We need the bitch Summer aspect of her back. Characters are becoming too extremely one-dimensional on the show.

I would go more in depth with the other character, too, but I am lazy and this is already really long. I will make quick blurbs.

Kirsten has lost too much weight, too. old people should not be doing that. He face has imploded at the cheeks.

We need to see Sandy in the courtroom and not chasing after ugly women from his past.

Caleb was a great man. His last scene was beautifully done and moving. He was the last arch-nemesis on the OC. Julie was one last season, but now she has been made into a more likable character with soul.

***OVERALL + NEEDS + SEASON 3***

Overall, Season 2 came out decent. I cannot forget the ugly first half, but neither can I forget the beautiful end.

It needs some new, colorful characters. Luke was a great character. Jimmy is back. Caleb was great as the antagonist. That is the thing with stories. There needs to be antagonists and protagonists. Everybody is becoming or became a protagonist. Luke, Julie, and now Caleb is dead. Who is the ass/bitch to come?

What was so great about Season 1 was the satire of the rich life. We see no intelligent satire or quip this season. We need to get to school as the story. Seth needs to become the nerd to be in the element that we love him for. We saw just a glimpse in the prom episode where some faceless guy in the crowd cried, ""Seth Cohen is a tool."" That was awesome. We need a return to the superficial rich (and hot) people and parties (with scantily clad, drunk girls) of the OC. That is what it is all about. Also, the kids are kids. They need to go to school. Not lumber around with their lesbians and such.

Season 3 holds great promise building on the momentum from the finale and the base from Season 1. The Theresa/Ryan's baby story can be quite good if it is done right. Sandy and Kirsten can become the lovable couple again. Anywho, sorry for the long review, and make sure you at least own Season 1. That is the best, and watch this promising show.",1121731200,7,6234,4.46830985915493
2296929,5,B0009K7QZ8,"This is one of the best shows on TV and no one knows it. and season 2 is not bad! just because season 1 was more of a soap opera and season 2 is a more mature charecter driven season does not mean it is bad! just because little stupid teens cannot sit on front of a TV and watch charecters grow and evolve and not constantly keep taking their clothes off and and living wildly (even though a lot of the supporting charecters do that, the main ones are a lot more mature, well in some ways! :) ) But what is so amazing with this show is that it achieves a brillent level of high drama and screwball comedy. The O.C. is probably one of the wittiest and most heartfelt shows on TV and still no one knows it. Not even the teens who watch it know it! I hate how this wonderful show is getting trashed but stupid people who can't handle matureity.",1121644800,,841,4.072289156626506
2296930,5,B0009K7QZ8,"Okay, even thought I'm probably the biggest fan of ""The O.C."" in the world, I will admit that season one was like 8100 times better than this one. The plots were not as deep as in the first season. Also, in this season they abused the Seth/Zack who wins Summer thing. Like, when she went back to Cohen from the damn airport I was hoping Zack would be off the show. The season started off okay and then went into a bit of a mid season slump, but during the last 5 or 6 episodes I was like, ""YES! The old O.C. is back."" And I was right! The show ended with such an awesone cliffhanger that leaves so many unanswered questions, like... Is Ryan gonna be angry at Marissa for killing his brother.. Is Trey going to actually die...Will Marissa do jailtime.. Will Seth and Summer stay together (I love them both but really give it up who cares anymore..).. Will Kirsten give up her lame-ass drinking problem.. Will Julie and Jimmy last?.. So, in conclusion, I say that anyone who loves the sex, the scandal, the beach and the skin of ""THE OC"" they should definately buy this DVD set!",1121558400,,1076,4.3316831683168315

The 2nd half of the season was especially great -- the Rain episode, Trey's return, Julie's porn scandal, Kirsten and Sandy's marriage headed for trouble... and the finale.  No matter who complained about the season, everyone was devastated by the last ten minutes.  What other show makes you laugh, gasp, cry, feel and rock out like the OC.  nothing else like it on tv.  buy it!",1120780800,6,591,4.87
2296932,2,B0009K7QZ8,"For anyone who actually watches the show for good plotlines, scripting, and character development (and by that, I mean not just ""OMG! Seth and Summer and Ryan and Marissa are totally meant to be!""), I think it's a joke to say that Season II even compared to Season I. When Season I ended, fans were left with actual compassion for the characters--and a strong desire to know what would happen to Seth (who was basically running away from his problems) and Ryan (who was forced into a life of fatherhood that he didn't really want). When Season II started, all those problems (Theresa's baby, Seth's irresponsibility, Seth's summer-stay with Luke) were magically resolved just so that the show could start more ridiculous plotlines.

The show also seems to have a problem with disappearing (and only sometimes reappearing) characters. Let's tally them up: Anna, Oliver, Caitlyn (Marissa's sister), Jimmy and Hailey ('til the Season II finale), Zach, Lindsay, Alex, DJ, Luke, Holly, Carter, Rebecca, Rachel (Sandy's partner in Season I), etc. I understand the need to focus a show around main characters, but it has become ridiculous. If the show actually accepted a new character as a new personality rather than a caricature or plot device (i.e. just to create a love triangle with Seth/Summer, Ryan/Marissa), then maybe plot development and natural arc-ing would come more easily. As it is, the show moves from plotline to plotline in a matter of episodes, never really giving fans any real closure and often dismissing plots just by shipping characters off to different cities. Not my idea of good writing, personally.

With that said, I do love ""The OC"". I think Season I presented a great show, and the dynamic between Seth and Ryan as friends (which was basically lost in Season II, thanks to Seth's personality taking a turn towards the extremely self-centered) was especially well-written. I hope that Season III returns to the strong writing that ""The OC"" once had, because I think it would be a shame to see Trey's death/Kirsten's alcoholism brushed off in favor of more Marissa/Ryan (ugh) pointless drama.",1120780800,12,2115,5.022792022792022
2296933,5,B0009K7QZ8,"The O.C. season one had great supporting characters. Anna as Seth female equivolent and Luke, bad-ass turned good guy. Even Theresa was believable and good in the role as Ryan's old friend from Chino. Oliver was the one blemish, but even he got the desired effect. The writers wanted us to hate him, and we did!

Season 2 was characterised by bad characters. Not only were the characters bad, but they brought out the worst in all the main characters. Lindsey started out well, but soon it became all about Caleb and her relationship. They would have been better off not making her Caleb's daughter! Give her something! Not only that, but she turns Ryan into a pansy, who's only role is to try and play nice with Caleb.

DJ... I'll spend as much time on him as the writers did on his relationship with Marissa.

Rebecca returns, then leaves, then returns, leading the perfect husband Sandy astray. Nobody wanted her around. At least this relationship helped lead to Kirsten in the finale, Lindsey and DJ didn't even have any positive points!

Zach... wasn't bad, but he was just boring. he was not a great character.

Those characters really hurt the show. Now, on to what I did like.

Alex was the one exception. She was a good character, and I wish they had kept her around instead of Zach

Episodes 1-5, 14-18, and 21-24 are the best episodes, with the Rainy Day Women being the best. Seth and Summer get back together, and the worst two characters on the show left(Lindsey and Rebecca).

The last four episodes were brilliantly done. Everything that they had built all season come together. Some said it was predictable, but I thought it was powerful, because you actually believed it. Ryan was tired of Trey's crap, and went to call him on it. Kirsten had a rough year, and it pushed her alcoholism.

In season three, I hope to see more Seth and Summer, and a return to the great Sandy-Kirsten relationship of season one. I am also anxiously hoping for the return of Jimmy Cooper. Ryan and Marissa, I don't really care. In fact, I'd be fine if they broke up for good. They worked at first, they just don't work anymore.

Despite some rough spots, I still love the O.C. I hope season three takes a lighter tone, with Seth and Summer, Sandy and Kirsten, and the comeback of the Cooper family.",1120780800,5,2295,4.575609756097561
2296934,4,B0009K7QZ8,"I know a lot of people out there these days buy television shows on DVD in order to watch them at their leisure - and commercial-free, so for those of you planning to pick up season 2 of the OC here is a quick recap of what to expect.

The season opener commences a few months after the finale from season 1 - with Ryan living in Chino with pregnant Teresa and Seth living 'abroad' after his impromptu sailing expedition.  Back home things are on the messy side...Kirsten is depressed, Sandy is frustrated, and Summer and Marissa still aren't over their missing boys, at least not entirely.

As you might have guessed, the OC wouldn't exist without Seth & Ryan and yes they do return...but that doesn't mean everything is rosy.  A crop of new characters enter and exit the OC social scene throughout the season, which is no longer marked by extravagant parties and constant fist fights.

Most of the turmoil from this season comes from ever-changing relationships between ALL of the characters, including the adult leads.  Trysts, affairs, triangles, experimenting, questionable behaviour, fights, frustrations and secret (and not-so secret) crushes dominate this much more intricate season - and yet there are still many more questions to be answered in the coming season.

Some of the new characters include teenagers Zach, Lindsay, and Alex, as well as adults Rebecca, Carter, Lance, and Reed, and the return of Ryan's older brother, Trey.  A few highlights of the season include the ""The SnO.C."", ""The Chrismakkah That Almost Wasn't"", ""The Power of Love"", ""The Rainy Day Women"", and the last three or four episodes.

Altogether this is a strong season of the OC when looked back on, but it's missing a lot of one element that really propelled the show forward in it's first season - fun.  The stand-alone ""fun"" episodes seem out of place and unrealistic, and many of the storylines are much heavier and more depressing then what occured in the first season.  Still if you've watched the first season of the oc there is no doubt you will be clamoring to watch the second - so don't pass it up, it's still a great show overall.  Amusingly even Seth comments on how ""last year was so much better"" in the episode ""The Blaze of Glory"".  True that - but the OC still thrills viewers and produces laughs, and I personally am looking forward to a new season.",1119830400,7,2354,4.740196078431373

Life in the OC is pretty close to the show... if not the exact same as the show...

In my opinion the show has lost some of its essence, they're no more cotillions, fashion show and fancy parties, instead we get to see them dealing with alcohol, drugs and sex issues. But I guess that's part of the show growing up and becoming what it is today.. a huge Pop-Culture phenomenon.

So... California here we come, up to season 3 (I admit it...I can't wait!!)

2296937,5,B0009K7QZ8,"The O.C. is cleverly written & has been perfectly acted out. The cast has been handpicked to supply a never-ending torrent of melodrama & pleasantry that can't be found elsewhere - for the moment at least.

While obvious comparisons to Beverly Hills 90210 are present, the show manages to hold its own. If you liked Beverley Hills 90210 & Melrose Place you'll love the OC. At first I thought I was better than this but after watching a couple of episodes I realized how good it was, not only that; it had this feeling of warmth that made you watch it & root for the underdog (Ryan). It felt a lot like 90210 but with a modern twist & also a bit more liberal.

Season II is great, I can't quite choose between seasons I & II because they both were different in their own special way. In season I we were introduced to the many wonderful characters of The OC like Seth & Sandy Cohen who provide the comic relief that all productions need, & they do it very well - not your usual slapstick-ish type of comedy but a darker more cynical type of sarcasm that sort of gets under your skin. The serious side of the show is nearly always provided by Ryan & Marissa. The couple seems to get in a fight every episode due to lack of communication but always finds a way to make up. As for season II, it dwells deeper into the casts emotions, triumphs & tragedy. I say tragedy for a reason; see it to know. I wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

A lot of the fans of the OC regard the last episode of Season II as the best ever; however I don't feel it to be right to single out one episode when the entire season has been terrific.

If you haven't seen season I, then I'd advise you to get that first. Jumping straight into season II would be a tad confusing even for the most passionate soap fan.

The OC is TV history in the making. It's just a matter of time before we see the True Hollywood Story (THS) of the OC on E!",1119571200,14,1908,4.145945945945946
2296938,3,B0009K7QZ8,"It was no secret that the second season of The O.C. was a broad, scattershot, occasionally infuriating step down in quality from the fresh and original soap update the first season of The O.C. created.  Let's count the plots that we yawned through - Marisa and the yard guy, Ryan and Lindsay, Caleb's paternity scare and Lindsay, the threat of a trial against Caleb, crazy sexpot Jess, the relationship of Ryan and his brother, and - good god - the return of Sandy's ""true love"" Rebecca.  Plus, Summer and Seth's antics tested the measure of patience, even as we reluctantly felt knocked down by the thought they wouldn't wind up together.  And that's not to mention too much faux-indie-music-hocking at The Bait Shop, too many unfulfilled plot ideas, and too much coy self-reference (when Seth quips ""even The Valley was better last year!"" you're more likely to agree than giggle).  It was all representative of a wandering sophomore season realiant on too many tricks that didn't pay off.  Still, we watched, all of us that whined our way through these 22 episodes (and occasionally, as in fully magnificent episodes like ""Rainy Day Women,"" we were rewarded for sticking around).  That means the OC hadn't entirely lost its addictive freshness.  Kirsten's season-capping alcoholism was a dramatic miracle by comparison to some of the season's sluggish plotlines, and Kelly Rowan deserves credit for her stunning growth as an actress.  Plus, as unconvincing Mischa Barton's performance tends to be, it was hard not to sympathize with Marisa's personal angst - the pool-furniture throwing, the lesbian fling, the attack by Trey: they added up to a shockingly compelling year for Marisa.  And as for Melinda Clarke's Julie Cooper, she was a vibrant, captivating force that turned a funny, magnificently conniving villainnes into an occasionally wowing full-bodied character with a soft streak - she's now one of the most memorable characters of all network television.  The year was without a doubt frustrating as a whole (I'm particularly unsatisfied with its Marisa's-a-murderer! finale), but it's a sign of good days to come that very few of us second-season haters plan on missing what they'll do to these kids next year.",1119484800,,2224,5.085164835164835

Sure it may have had it set backs and may have been a lot different than season 1, but the second season morphed into more of a reality than a fantasy. You got to really get in touch with the characters, which was lacking in season 1. Also, The O.C. became much more ""cool"" rather than a sappy soapy drama. The introduction of the bait shop was key to The O.C.'s new cool appeal and Alex also added to this newfound coolness. Even if the show did get a rocky start in the beginning, you have to admit that the show needed that much time to solve all of the things that were left unsolved from season 1. Imagine how much we would not know if they immediately solved everything in the first couple episodes rather than having you wait so that they could solve every little detail. We would miss so much if they did not take the time to solve everything. The end of season 2 was incredible. The last couple of weeks were amazing and the producers could not have done it better. The ending was insane, but in a good way. This dvd is completely worth the money and you should buy it if you have seen all of season 1. It is well worth it.",1119139200,,1307,4.190476190476191

Not only did they ruin Kirsten and Sandy's relationship, but they also got rid of Jimmy, and Kaleb died.  All the new characters they introduced sucked, and they didn't stick around very long.  Mischa Barton needs to take acting lessons, because there is more to being a good actress than the ability to cry on command.  Summer and Seth got annoying, and Ryan's totally different than he was in the first season.  Oh and whatever happened to Marissa's sister Kaitlin, don't they get breaks at boarding school.

Watching these episodes over and over again you pick up small things that the directors have cleverly inputted, like duplicate lines being used from the 1st season to produce wit to those who notice it.

Seth's (adam brody) humour is hilarious and seth's mission to go 'stealth' one night had me in tears.

This season though, is all about its ending. The final episode hits you hard and all of the previous episodes gel together once you watch ep 24. Things that shouldnt happen do, and the kitchen scene with kirsten, seth, sandy, hayley and ryan will make you feel weak at the knees.

As for the final scene, for a supposed 'teenie flick ' it becomes more of a high class drama movie and the acting of all the characters shows us what a great programme The O.C has become.

2296945,5,B0009K7QZ8,"The second brilliant season of ""The OC"" is true to form and typically blends halarious comedy with its at times controversal drama. Though perhaps not as consistant as its first flawless season, ""Season Two"" is nevertheless a compelling watch.

Picking up where we left out awesome foursome: Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) is back in his hometown of Chino; Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) has been blackmailed into living with her mother, for whome she has much hatred; Seth Cohen (Adam Brody), distraught and lost after his best friend's departure, has run away to Portland; leaving his girlfriend Summer ROberts (Rachel Bilson) behind in Newport.

Following the resolutions of these situations, come many more situations! These include: A long lost relative of the Cohens, a lesbian relationship, an ex-con coming to stay, a drug overdose, a near-rape, a divorce, a death and a shooting! Enough? 'Course not! I've merely skimmed the surface!

This season, perhaps a bit more than ""Season One"" takes note on some very prominant issues in teenagers' lives. Issues including, homosexuality, rape violence are explored. I love that ""The OC"" goes into these relavant issues, as the majority of viewers are teenagers whome must face them in real life.

Having said that, I also like how ""The OC"" always manages to have that comical edge to it. The screenplay, by Josh Schwartz, is full of more fantastic one-liners and wonderfully funny scenes, bringing out that ""OC"" style of never taking itself TOO seriously!

Finally, the music as per usual, is fantastic. This is particularly thanks to the addition of ""The Bait Shop,"" a regular hang-out spot for the gang where bands perform live. It adds that extra ""OC-ish"" element to the show. The music definately has more of a prominant role in bringing out emotion and other moods to their full.

And without giving too much away the finale of this 24-episode is, in my opinion, is the best ""OC"" episode ever made. THe ending left me utterly paralysed and craving for the third season!

I thouroughly enjoyed this second season. My only criticism would maybe be that it started out a little dull, by it regained itself and finaled to a truly stunning finish!

I just want to say something before I get into my review about a previous reviewer's review...I'm not so sure that the show is fake. Granted it does embellish the california lifestyle (what television show doesnt???Television is just an exaggeration of life) but I don't think it is fake, nor do I think that misha barton is fake. And who are you to say she is or isn't. She is playing a character on a TELEVISION SHOW!!! Do you know her??? have you met her??? The show happens to address issues which I have experienced and family situations that I have experienced or have been experienced around me. So I do feel that the show does address some relevant issues as did Life As We Know It but tragically the show has ended so just because it didn't address issues important enough to you it may have to others....

Review:

Now, I am an O.C. fan and I was a little dissappointed with the second season at the beginning. This season was just not what I thought it would be there was new character to get used to and some unrealistic plot twist, but towards the end I began to get hooked into the show again. So I believe that this will only really be bought by major O.C. fans who know that they have to buy the second season in order for their collection of seasons to be complete. And let's just say that Josh Schwartz and the rest of the people connected with The O.C. won't be out of a job for awhile",1116720000,2,1433,4.319702602230484

At the start of this season Ryan and Seth return to find that things have changed. Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) have been renovating the Cohen house, Marissa is having a secret fling with her yard guy D.J (Nicholas Gonzalez) and Summer is happy with her new boyfriend Zach (Michael Casssidy). Both Ryan and Seth had been hoping for reunions with their ex-girlfriends but instead both found new love interests. Ryan met Lindsay (Shannon Lucio) and Seth met Alex (Olivia Wilde) at the bait shop, a new hangout for the gang where Seth gets a job. Hailey (Amanda Righetti) leaves Jimmy (Tate Donovan) to go to Japan for a new job. Caleb gets in legal trouble early in the season and it was revealed that he is the father of Ryan's new girlfriend Lindsay. Julie and Jimmy begin to have an affair until Marissa found out. She told nobody but her father left Newport. .Soon after that D.J realised that he was being used as a weapon against Julie and left Marissa. Seth and Alex decided to call it quits after their relationship failed to really take off which lead to Marissa embarking on a new lesbian relationship with Alex. Before long they were living together. Sandy was visited by an old flame, Rebecca (Kim Delaney). He almost cheated but his love for Kirsten prevailed in the end. Caleb decided to adopt his illegitimate daughter Lindsay but demanded a paternity test. The test proved that  Lindsay was his daughter but she decided to move to Chicago with her mother, leaving Caleb and Ryan. During the first half of the season, Seth and Summer had been growing close again which culminated in Summer leaving Zach at the airport to be with Cohen. This resulted in the most spectacular kiss ever witnessed on the O.C. Seth was then obsessed with reuniting Ryan and Marissa. Marissa's girlfriend Alex was becoming increasingly jealous of Ryan, who was getting close to Marissa again. This caused the end of Marissa and Alex's relationship. Julie had been working on a new project, a magazine called Newport living starring - her. Carter Buckley (Billy Campbell) was recruited as the editor. Kirsten developed a crush on him. On the eve of the magazine being released a blast from the past named Lance (Johnny Messner) came to Newport to blackmail Julie. Julie had made a porn movie when she was young which Lance threatened to publicise unless Julie gave him half a million dollars. Julie asked Caleb for help, but the movie was shown. Ryans brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) comes to Newport and stays with the Cohens. He gets in trouble several times, and attempts to rape Marissa, who had recently got back together with Ryan. Zach came back in the picture and challenged Seth for Summer. Seth eventually won, declaring his love for Summer at prom. Kirsten had grown closer to Carter but realised that her husband meant more to her. She was driving home and declaring her love for him on the phone- when she had an accident. As she recovered, Sandy realised she had become an alcoholic. Julie and Calebs marriage had been on the rocks, with divorce looming. Julie was going to take matters into her own hands but decided not to at the very last minute. Caleb suddenly died of natural causes. Julie tried to save him but couldnt. The death of her father made Kirstens alcoholism worse. Everything comes to a head in the season finale, where some familiar faces return, people are put in danger amd people leave the O.C. The last few minutes of the season end in a cliffhanger which has to be seen to be believed.

This is an excellent show and I would recommend this dvd to anybody.",1116028800,8,3955,4.713872832369942

2296968,5,B0009K7QZ8,The second series of The O.C. aired in England in January after 3 months of me continuously watching the first series on DVD waiting in desperation for the second series and after watching the first episode I was a bit disappointed but after the first not-as-great-as-usual episode the series picked up and was great again. This series hasn't been as good as the first but this was to be expected as the first series was world-class but this progamme is still the best show on T.V. and Seth is still the best character on T.V.
