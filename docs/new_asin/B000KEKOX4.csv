8155880,1,B000KEKOX4,"I didn't realize this movie would be a very poor, unoriginal attempt at remaking THE OMEN until I wasted what felt like endless hours watching it. Same basic plot, but with no added surprises. Stale characters, cheesy acting, and nothing remotely scary in the entire movie. In a word: DULL!",1170633600,,290,4.82
