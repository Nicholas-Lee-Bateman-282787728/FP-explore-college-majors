This is pretty darn close.  I enjoyed it beyond measure because of the accompanying narration that gave you the history and background around each movie and dance sequence that was featured.  This DVD was pure heaven.",1472428800,,379,4.968253968253968

The other 10 discs in the complete collection contain the movies themselves; this disc is a documentary, narrated by Chuck Klausmeyer, tracing the lives and motion picture careers of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, and contains excerpts from the ten  motion pictures that Rogers and Astaire made together.",1291939200,11,438,5.169014084507042
8155772,4,B000KE17YY,"I didn't catch that this was a documentary when I orderd it, but once I got over the disappointment that it was not a movie, I really enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun to hear about these two great performers and see a sampling of each of their films.",1268092800,4,249,3.9019607843137254

This DVD ""set"" is such a wonderful bargain and superb value for the price that it should
rapidly sell-out.  The DVD is a Warner Bros. release, although Warners didn't make or
release any of their films.  Most of the titles, excerpted so skillfully, are from their R.K.O.
days.  I can't say enough about the fine quality of the film transfers on the DVD; they
are some of the finest I have ever seen.  The visual quality is A+ and must have come
from studio reference master prints.  But the real ""kicker"" is this: With the DVD you get
a superb quality audio CD collection of the best music remembered from the Astaire
and Rogers dance films.  What a great value!  I have also purchased (from Amazon) one
of the Astaire & Rogers boxed-set collections.  This DVD is a great addition to that set
and beautifully sums up their seminal work in creating some of the masterpieces of
choreographed dance on film as well as highlighting the back story of how some of
the great films of Hollywood's early sound era were created.  I highly recommend this
collection; its a fascinating documentary and a tremendous value.",1261267200,8,1198,4.613207547169812
