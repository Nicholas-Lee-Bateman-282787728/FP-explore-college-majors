If you're considering this, its almost certainly to see if its so bad you can get a laugh or two out of it. Spoilers: you cant, so pass and don't look back.",1509148800,,322,4.209677419354839
8744786,1,B019D3J2WQ,"I made it 20 minutes in and shut it off. I've watch soooo many bad horror/thriller/sci-fi movies, it's very rare that I can't get through the whole thing. This is one of them.",1508630400,,175,4.333333333333333
8744787,1,B019D3J2WQ,"This extremely awful film is an excruciating exercise in amateur film-making. It has no plot, bad actors, bad dialogue, very bad direction. The movie-in-the-movie scenes actually plagiarize entire sequences of dialogue from Friday the 13th. On top of that, the movie has no ending. It just abruptly stops, without resolution and without explaining what the main part of the movie has to do with the looooong pre-title sequence. It seems like an attempt at cinematic artistry, but it fails epically.  Please do not reward these talentless film-makers with any of your hard earned money. Buying losing instant lottery tickets would still be a better use of that money.",1507507200,,666,5.166666666666667
8744788,1,B019D3J2WQ,"No disrespect to those who worked on this, one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. It's in the so bad it's good category, but it's also so bad it's intensely irritating. Every technical aspect is messed up in one way or the other, the tone stays at an even, constant level of mild hysteria the entire time, audio is crap, performances aggressively weak, and characters uniformly stupid and reprehensible.

It's really hard to imagine getting everything so completely wrong in a single movie. On the other hand, they couldn't even get the title right.

They're reportedly working on the sequel, titled: 'The Fourth of July: July 3rd'",1492128000,,639,4.853211009174312
8744789,4,B019D3J2WQ,"I really enjoyed this film! It's clear it was made on a low budget, but it's amazing what you can accomplish with a camera, a group of friends and some killer forests. It opens with a really creepy scene that made me feel queasy afterward. Most of the performances are solid. If you're looking for a good, solid horror movie made out of love and passion and not hollywood bulls***, give this one a look. It is the perfect time of year to watch it.",1477440000,,447,4.270588235294118
