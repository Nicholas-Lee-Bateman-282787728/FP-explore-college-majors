7129769,2,B00WAZHS0I,I was hoping this movie would have been better but it was not so good sorry to say. The homosexual cowboy thing is not what I was expecting.,1433721600,,140,4.035714285714286
7129770,3,B00WAZHS0I,I saw this movie on Directv Cinema and I watched it because of Duvall who is my favorite actor. I was disappointed. The plot was an interesting story but the movie was disjointed...and the woman Texas Ranger played by Duvall's wife was not believable. Save your money and watch on Redbox. I rated it a 3 because of Duvall and Franco.,1433635200,,333,4.475409836065574
7129771,2,B00WAZHS0I,"This movies is a jumbled mess. There are, like, 3 different plots. Not Duvall's finest work.",1433635200,,92,4.8125

7129776,2,B00WAZHS0I,"Poor plot, weakly orchestrated with virtually no drama of any interest. Wish I hadn't wasted the time, but who can resist a movie about horses with Duvall? My advice is to ignore this one.",1521158400,,188,4.5588235294117645
7129777,1,B00WAZHS0I,shame.... good actors bad dumb movie,1521072000,,36,5.166666666666667
7129778,2,B00WAZHS0I,"Ugh.
You know... I wanted to like this movie.
It just wasn't good.

Pros:
Josh Hartnett was the only person who acted like a good actor in this film. Made the film somewhat bearable.

Cons:
James Franco - love him, usually. This time, not so much. He brought his ""comedic acting"" essence to his role in this film, so he kind of made his scenes seem like a skit of some sort.
Luciana Pedraza - why? Just not good.
The story? Fugget about it! No story to speak of.

Please do not waste your time.",1520812800,,494,4.178947368421053

7129782,4,B00WAZHS0I,"I really liked this movie. I liked the uniqueness of the 3 brothers personalities and how differently their relationships with their father Robert Duval is. Especially James Franco and Josh Harnett. ***Spoiler***There is a murder mystery here, kind of. It seems it was an accident, but Robert Duvall made a really bad choice to bury James Franco's lover after he accidentally killed him. It would have saved him and several others a lot of grief if he had just called the Sheriff and deal with it then. But then there wouldn't have been much of a storyline. It's well worth your time. I do recommend highly.",1520294400,,607,4.735849056603773

7129784,1,B00WAZHS0I,"This is just another version of ""BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN"", full of stereotypical contemporary politically correct propaganda.

7129790,4,B00WAZHS0I,I liked this despite the stilted acting and dialogue. It was about more that being critic-worthy; a way of life and hardened men with narrow ideas. The cast was wonderful as well as the wide open scenery.  I realized after it started that I had seen it before but it was worth a second watch.,1519344000,,292,4.3090909090909095

7129793,1,B00WAZHS0I,I love all the actors in this movie but it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen - a big disappointment.  The story line is fine but the script is horrible.  The actors are reading the worst lines in this movie and they don't make any sense.  I think they edited the movie and took out too much of the film because a lot of the scenes don't make sense or lack continuity.  Don't waste your time!  Its too bad as Duvall directed this one!,1516147200,,444,4.0

7129799,2,B00WAZHS0I,I love western.  This one was odd. I liked the lead woman's character. Overall it was like they were reading their parts instead of being there parts.  Maybe that made it more realistic... I just can't tell.  Viewing price should decrease tobno one than $1.50.  If that were to price then it would be a solid purchase.,1505088000,,318,4.526315789473684

7129898,1,B00WAZHS0I,"Being a Robert Duvall fan (he is one of kind, sadly probably never see an actor of his caliber again), I bought the movie with his name headlining it, figuring it had to be good. I should have read the reviews. Sadly for a Duvall movie, it was one of the most 'crappy' movies I've seen in along time. Poor writing, plot, scene transition, etc, etc. When the end of the movie finally ended, the ending left a feeling of what was the plot and why did the characters in the movie go through all they did for how it ended. Sort of like watching a baseball/football game only to end in a tie. My wife and I watched it and couldn't believe it. She advised me she had trouble staying awake. We only finished watching it for two reasons. #1, we wanted to see what happened and if the show would get any better and #2, I wasted $10.00 on the thing and figured might as well. If I could send it back and get a refund I would. I've thought of giving it to some fellow Duvall friends, but I'm embarrassed to let them see how I was suckered. My wife and I have a term for things that each of us will buy that looks good, but is of no use, cheap quality, price to much for the product, etc,. We call it SB or 'Sucker Bait""!!! This movie was Sucker Bait. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. DON'T buy this movie if your a Robert Duvall fan. You will be greatly disappointed. If I could give it any less than one star, I would. I don't know if 'Bobby' as many of his fellow actors call him, needed some quick grocery money or what and hastily wrote and filmed this thing for quick money, but I'm really disappointed. I'll give it 1/16th of a star. That is  given only because Duvall had some of his voice and hand mannerisms in the movie. Again, if your a Robert Duvall fan and don't want to be disappointed, stay away from this movie like you'd stay away from a den of rattlesnakes!!!! I stand by what I've penned.",1452988800,,1899,4.146341463414634
7129899,3,B00WAZHS0I,"Robert Duvall is over 80 years old, and, at an age when many actors are winding down their careers, he took on a project that would challenge many people half his age: directing, writing, and starring in ""Wild Horses."" Unfortunately, that appears to be two roles too many. While Duvall the actor is still in fine form, the movie would have been far better served with someone else handling the writing and directing.

Duvall plays Scott Briggs, owner of a large ranch in south Texas, who has summoned his three sons so he can explain his latest will to them. One of those sons, Ben (James Franco), is gay and hasn't seen his ultra-conservative father since he left home when Scott found him in bed with another teenager, one of the ranch hands, 15 years earlier. Now, however, Scott realizes he's coming to the end of his life, and a part of him wants to come to grips with his prejudices against gays, women, and Mexicans (among others) and make things right with his family.

Complicating Scott's plans for a reconciliation with his family is the fact that the ranch hand Ben was with 15 years earlier disappeared without a trace that same night. His mother (Adriana Barraza) has finally persuaded the Texas Rangers to look into his case. Scott thinks that the investigating Ranger, Sam Payne (played by Duvall's own wife Luciana), could uncover some answers that would damage the family, so he orders a crooked local cop to get rid of her.

""Wild Horses"" plays like a cross between a cable TV channel ripoff of ""Dallas"" and a particularly bad episode of ""Walker Texas Ranger"" recast with a female lead.  There are plenty of subplots that are barely explored, and Scott's two other sons (one played by Josh Hartnett) are for all intents and purposes extras. The movie jumps around from one subplot to the next in confusing fashion, with far too much time devoted to Ranger Payne. Unlike her husband, Ms. Duvall isn't a particularly talented actress, and her scenes (including one in which she parades around in her underwear) play as if director Duvall was using ""Wild Horses"" as a vanity piece to show off his much younger wife. To make matters worse, there are several other non-actors in the movie, and the director isn't really able to get a good performance out of anyone but himself, Franco, and Barraza.

Fortunately, those three actors are able to make enough scenes work to make ""Wild Horses,"" uneven as it is, mildly entertaining. Duvall the actor is in fine form as Scott Briggs, a man whose frailties, both moral and physical, are beginning to show but who is determined to hold onto what power he has left. Duvall is at his best in showy roles, and Scott is a tour de force. Duvall easily overshadows the other actors on screen with him in any scene, with the except of Franco, who also delivers a fine performance. As an actor, James Franco appears in so many films that he often goofs off or plays games on camera, but here, he makes Ben a fully realized character. He and Duvall have great chemistry together, whether bonding or butting heads.

At its best, ""Wild Horses"" is an acting showcase for Duvall and Franco, one that makes us easily realize why Duvall is still one of the best actors alive. However, the movie is also a poorly edited jumble of storylines that too often showcase far lesser talented performers. ""Wild Horses"" has enough good scenes for me to give it a marginal recommendation, especially for those who like Robert Duvall's acting style. The movie also makes me wonder just how good it might have been if someone had just corralled the writer and director instead of letting them run wild.",1452124800,,3631,4.683385579937304

7129925,4,B00WAZHS0I,"Thanks to the other Amazon reviewers, I really enjoyed this film. If you are on the fence about Wild Horses, here is what I think.

Some very minor supporting actors with faults during the first act basically disappeared, letting the mystery take over the story.

All the sets, skies, and realism are well done. Many years after a disappearance, the mystery is solved.

The story is a good one. No spoilers here.

Another overlooked Duvall film with poor distribution is A Family Thing (1996) Robert Duvall - James Earl Jones. .&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Family-Thing/dp/B000059TFN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Family Thing</a>

Duvall plays a  very convincing role as a Crusty Texan Rancher who with difficulty challenges his own core traditional values.  Most poignant and masterfully executed is the father/son relationship as acted by James Franco,  Duvall's gay son.  It  leaves  us with a subtle and very refreshing  look at this conflict, where the character Ben, brilliantly acted, is the person that any  father, brother, sister, mother, friend would wish to have. Drama and life changing events happen along the way.  May not be a movie for everyone.  The strength of the movie is in the acting.

7130075,3,B00WAZHS0I,"Veteran actor 'Robert Duvall' both wrote and directed the film.
15 years ago 'Jimmy Davies' disappeared without a trace, the case was never resolved.
His Mother who has grieved all these years approaches 'Texas-Ranger' 'Samantha Payne' (Luciana Pedraza) for
help in solving the mystery, she needs answers, 'Samantha' agree's to re-open the file.
The former Sheriff, now retired had always believed the answers lay firmly at the 'Briggs' ranch.
'Scott Briggs' is an influential and wealthy rancher, he plays by his own rules and answers to no-one, he's both
tough and stubborn, he runs the ranch with sons 'K.C' (Josh Hartnett) and 'Johnny' (Devon Abner) along with
'Maria Gonzales' (Angie Cepeda)
The ranch has borders with Mexico, 'Scott' has always where possible defended his land against Drug-Traffickers
and indeed those who sought to enter Texas ilegally.
When 'Scott's' estranged son 'Ben' (James Franco) who had been run off the ranch after being found with 'Jimmy'
by his father 15 years ago....his father did not accept that he wasn't 'straight'
'Ben's' return fuelled suspicion from Texas-Ranger 'Samantha' she'd heard the rumours and wasn't about to step
back from the case....this will trouble 'Scott' he's never been forthcoming with answers.
The film is a story of a man who has trouble explaining his feelings and indeed thoughts and keeps his own council,
but, when faced with the past rearing-up he has trouble coping....his sons never having really understood their
father but will try to help.
Not gonna set the World on fire but worthy of a viewing nevertheless.
'84' year old 'Robert Duvall' still puts in a shift on screen.

7130076,4,B00WAZHS0I,"After reading the reviews for this movie, I could have passed on it, but I didn't.  I guess I like to see for myself rather than take others'  word for it.  It isn't Duvall's best, or most memorable, but it seems to reflect his own thinking about age--remembering the good moments, and especially the regrets.  He has done several movies over the past few years that deals with this subject, and I think it is an outpouring of his personal concerns as well as those of others.  He has used comic impressions, joyful impressions, and the very serious impression he incorporates in this story.  I believe Duvall is much more reflective and a much deeper thinker than we ordinarily expect, and he has considered many aspects of a man's view of himself in old age.  Perhaps it is the fact that I am reaching this point in my own life that I appreciate his movies of late.  Perhaps it speaks to a different generation than those who gave it such a negative review.",1438214400,,959,4.502890173410405

I like happy ending movies, and this movie did not have that. Just after it looked like there was going to be a mended relationship between Ben and his dad, then it blew up in their faces...... and then the ending..... man, what were they thinking.

Other than the movie being depressing, I thought it was well done. For his age, Robert Duvall did a great job of acting out his character. Franco and Hartnett were also great in their roles.

I didn't like the hate crime angle.... all crimes are bad and should be punished for the act, not because why the person did it.

And to answer Ben's question as to what is worse, Two men having sex or King David having a guy killed off to cover up an affair..... both are sin. David both repented and was punished for his sin, but most gay people refuse to repent or even admit the Bible is right about it being a sin",1437955200,,878,4.271084337349397

7130092,4,B00WAZHS0I,"""Wild Horses"" (2015) is directed by Robert Duvall. This film is about a rancher (Robert Duvall) and his family who harbour a dark secret from the past. When a tough female ranger (Luciana Duvall) reopens a cold case of the disappearance of a young man the buried past comes to light. It's the conflict between James Franco's character and the stubbornly biased father figure played by Robert Duvall which forms the nucleus of this film, and it is the persistence of the tough minded ranger who acts as the catalyst that stirs up the pot that uncovers the rot below the surface. These various elements brew and ferment coming to an unexpected tragic ending after the father belatedly tries to make amends for his actions. It is somewhat heartbreaking to see that at the moment that Duvall's character is finally coming around and taking responsibility for some of his past mistakes that this only seems to anger those around him. It becomes a catch-22, and one is left wondering if it was even worth it for Duvall's character to open up about the past with his unfortunate secrets which cloak some of his faults and prejudices. But even while Duvall's character and history is exposed we're never quite sure what to think of Duvall's character. He's a man with strong believes who has been revered by many people, but who has also held prejudices that have served to undermine the inclusion of some of his family members. He seems somewhat naive though in his understanding about how his revealing of his point of view will be accepted. Even at this point there is an ambiguity about whether or not he is truly telling the truth, or merely hiding behind some fascade of his own making. We feel we may never know about the truth about what happened, but we feel that somehow he is responsible for the man's death, even if indirectly, by virtue of his prejudices. Each of the sons respond in different ways which reveals the different levels and mixtures of perspectives and levels of bonds. At one point in the movie the ranger asks James Franco's character if he believes that blood runs thicker than water and he responds by saying no. Here we find that there is a divergence between James Franco's allegiance to his father and his ideals of right and wrong. It is this complexity of views and the coming together and diverging of various perspectives that make this movie interesting as we never seem to know where everything will end up in the end even though the road seems to be narrowing and offering fewer points of escape for Duvall's character. Eventually there comes a point where he can no longer hide from his past in his silence as he must face himself for what he is and what he has done, and he must face how this has affected those closest to him.",1437868800,,2762,4.627291242362525

7130148,2,B00WAZHS0I,"Full of  great, wide-open Texas ranch landscapes, but sadly, just as packed with terrible writing and some of the worst acting imaginable...exceptions were solid portrayals of brothers surviving a fractured horse ranching dynasty, Josh Hartnett and James Franco. While this movie may be a historic film curio for other reasons down the road, don't spend your money or your time watching this one. To see Duvall at his edgy elder best in a crowning achievement of starring and directing, watch his marvelous APOSTLE instead.

But here, in WILD HORSES, where apparently locals and family members were used, instead of seeming naturalistic, both the integrity of the story --its glue-- and overall believability of actors and non-actors woodenly reciting bad lines, it all morphs into, well, a trainwreck. Everything important beyond the magnificent landscapes falls prey to the bad acting and writing.  Apart from performances by Franco and Hartnett, this movie played worse than many a grindhouse B-movie or film student shaky cam film I've seen in the last few years.

As a long-time admirer of Duvall, who for more than half a century, from TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD to THE GODFATHER to APOCALYPSE NOW to LONESOME DOVE...to Duvall's own wonderful APOSTLE, has been one of our great American actors, I have to say based on this and his previous film about an elder cowboy getting lost in a border town, it's long since time this screen legend stepped back, stopped listening to a bunch of *yes men*,  and allowed others to write and direct.

Having lived in Texas in ranching country years ago I know these people, and the badly written lines and often wooden acting do not give the people and place the dignity they deserve. Makes me sad that no one close to this living legend could delay the film's release in its present state. No doubt bringing in a new editor and exchanging some of the fine nature footage for some of the badly acted/badly directed scenes could make it work.",1435536000,53,1978,4.907185628742515

He makes amends with a gay son that he kicked out of his life years before and sits down with his children and attorney to explain his will and how he is dividing his property.

Now Scott is forced to try and hide the truth from everyone while trying to help his family. First and foremost this is a good movie. That said Duvall is starting to fall into the legend trap. By that I mean he is really doing a characteture of himself in every movie lately. He is still great but the person he plays in Night in Old Mexico and this one is pretty much the same person. That is not a bad thing, but it also takes away from the personalization of the movie. Also much like Night in Old Mexico this is not a western even though the cover seems like it is. All that said, the movie is very good and if you liked Night in Old Mexico you will like this as well.

The dialogue almost seems like it's made up as they go along, even ad libbed, and the storyline (which one?) is confused and erratic.

You're waiting the whole film for it to pick up storyline wise but it never does. You early on start to wish you'd watched something else.  Basically it's about an old Texas guy who likes firing his gun in the air, whether he's inside his house or outside whenever he gets mad or upset.  Seems to do so, so it makes him like a big man and in charge of the situation, but just makes him look pathetic.  He's surprised that a female Texas ranger exists and is annoyed that she dares to come onto his property and knock on his door and ask questions about a missing assumed to be murdered teenage victim from some years ago, and yells at his staff and the help whenever she turns up because it's their fault.  The Texas ranger actress doesn't visually sell to the viewer that she's a police officer, her acting isn't great and she does dumb things like drive after a driver who fires a bullet at her car into a dead end quarry that you'd think ambush would be on her mind.  Luckily for her it wasn't on the mind of the dumb thug.  Her car luckily although it looks nothing like a police car, seems to have a bullet proof windshield.  James Franco turns up about a third of the movie in (after a cameo at the start), his presence as an actor stands out amongst the others who don't seem that convincing in their roles.  He has two brothers, one seems to be about twice his age, but then again the father is pretty old so I guess that's possible.

The quality of this movie can be summurised in a scene, there's a Mexican woman who says in Spanish (we read the subtitles), I asked for you (she's talking to the Texas ranger) specifically because you can speak Spanish.  The obese other Texas ranger excuses himself and gets up and leaves the room because he can only speak English and has better things to do.  Then as soon as he's gone, the conversation continues in English.
