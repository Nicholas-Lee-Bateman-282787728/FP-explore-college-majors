1286242,1,B00003CWQ9,"Norm Macdonald, Danny DeVito, and Dave Cheppele star in one of the stupidest movies of the year. All 3 of these actors are farely succesful, Norm of course with his fame on SNL, and Dave Cheppele just stared in the hilarious Half Baked, and DeVito has a countless number of awesome films. I thought hey, the trailers looked funny, I love all 3 actors, there could only be one problem, it was too good to be true. As Norm plays Willard Filmore a butler who is over abused by his boss Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch), Norm hears he's going to be fired so he seeks revenge by stealing Miss Crock's favorite dog Muffin, and hold the dog for a ransom, he gets help from his best friend Rusty (dave cheppele) who works at a Fried Chicken Restaurant. When things go wrong Muffin escapes and gets back to Miss Crock, and then Miss Crock thinks WILLARD is up for the ransom, they try to fake Willard's death and move to Bali, the body is being supplied by a creepy mortician Grover Clever (DeVito). Everything is really screwed in this movie. That's the summary of what would seem to be a funny movie, but the title says it all.

If your a fan of comedies such as Meet the Parents (Yawn!), Scary Movie* (In the name of all that is good and deacent, get it away!), and Big Daddy (Burn the TV and VCR!  They've both been befouled!), then this isn't the movie for you.  If you are a fan of the comedic styles of the Three Stooges, the late Chris Farley, and, of course, Norm MacDonald, then this is the movie to watch.  It started out as a better version of Lost & Found and evolved into it's own movie.  Take my advice, the scene where Norm get's muged by those two little kids is well worth watching the movie.  I'm still trying to view a copy of Dirty Work, I havn't seen it yet and I want to!  This is a good example of how great a Norm MacDonald movie can be.
*I'm well aware of how bad of an example Scary Movie is, but it's a great example of how unfunny a movie can get if you take this type of humor too far.",991699200,6,940,3.9946524064171123

1286245,5,B00003CWQ9,"I hadn't even heard of this movie until I stopped by the video store to take a chance on a flick and did I ever hit it big.  This movie had the most in-depth plot I've ever seen in a comedy.  It involves kidnapping, fried chicken, stolen police cars and tons of laughs.  If you even remotely liked Dirty Work, you'll love this film because it brings back the element of REVENGE.  Norm MacDonald's humor makes him the cream of the crop, I don't know what those haters at SNL were doing giving him the pink slip.  Anyways, a lot of movies are coming out now days that don't have any element of the silliness or craziness that I miss from the Chris Farley days so it's refreshing for a film to go back to the roots of comedy.",979430400,,722,4.16546762589928

He said that he only saw about 5 minutes of the movie. I still wanted to see the movie, but my dad said to wait for it to come on video. I rented it as soon as possible and watched it. This movie was great! My friend obviously didn't stay to watch the whole movie. Maybe it was the beginning which he didn't like, well there was nothing wrong with it, because the story line was awesome.

Wriiten and Directed by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski are best known for writing Problem Child 1&2, Ed Wood, The people vs. Larry Flynt and Man on the moon. Made in 1998. Also a trivia here: Norm does an funny tribute to Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn, the scene where Norm`s hand is bitting by a dog, Norm will do everything to get it off. Evil Dead 2:Bruce`s hand is bitting by his dead girlfriend`s head, then he would do everything to get if off also. Norm`s and Bruce`s are very funny indeed.

ever made! Dave Chappell is really good here as the sidekick. DeVito is a little over the top with his performance but he's pretty funny too.
The plot is typical loser type McDonald plays so well with that whiny voice and smart quick answer wit that he has. The movie gets more
ridiculous as the plot goes but it's a comedy! don't take too seriously! It's what comedies use to be! FUNNY! unlike the hollyweird crap
like TED and other vile nasty gross comedies they make now! If you liked Dirty Work which is a classic this is almost as good! Norm
McDonald's show NORM should have lasted longer and the great Stan Hooper didn't make 1/2 a season wasn't given the chance. I
think McDonald is an under rated comedian who gets lost in the SNL has been shuffle of those no talents like Fallon, Fey and Sanders!",1436832000,,937,4.390804597701149

Chappelle and DeVito are pretty funny, but the late, great, Elaine Stritch is funny as hell and nearly steals the show. I'm a huge fan of Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski and their numerous great scripts (""Problem Child"", ""Problem Child 2"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Mars Attacks!"", ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", ""Man on the Moon"", etc.).  I think they achieved what they set out to with this screwball comedy and would have liked to have seen them direct some more. I believe their next project was going to be a biopic of ""The Marx Brothers"", but they couldn't get the green light after this movie was a box office flop!

SOME people may criticize this picture for the lack of traditional ""direction"" and ""plot,"" but those fail to see how Screwed subverts the screwed-ball (thanks previous reviewer!) genre and reinvents it for a new millennium.

After watching Norm MacDonald's acting tour de force, ten years later, one has to wonder what happened to his once-promising acting career. Too much too soon?

Despite his physical size, watching Danny DeVito was like watching a comedic giant in a battle royale.

To sum up: ""You tried to swindle... ME?!I'll have your... aaaaasssss!""

That said, I love this movie and it's one of few that I catch myself quoting, still, on a weekly basis ever since I first watched it (ten years ago). This movie is filled with priceless comedic scenes, particularly if you enjoy the comedic acting of Norm MacDonald, Dave Chappelle, and/or Danny DeVito. Their timing is gold. Willard Fillmore (Norm MacDonald) is a poor butler, who does his job to the best of his abilities and is a good, honest worker. It's a thankless job and he can never seem to live up to his father, who previously was the house butler until he passed away. The running joke about Willard stuck in this dead-end job and his ratty uniform is one of my favorites. Every actor/actress in this movie has a hilarious role, with enough conflicting personalities to make this movie worth watching at least once. There are a handful of good one-liners that I catch myself repeating to friends; unfortunately, not many people have seemed to watched this movie. For the current price ($7~) it's a steal and I do recommend this movie to all my friends. Screwed reminds me of the silly humor in Half-baked, but with thought-out jokes and a story line. I particularly enjoy that there is no love interest or romance in this comedy, per se. It's about two good friends (Norm and Dave Chappelle) trying to make their lives better, or at least something they feel they deserve. They aren't the smartest of criminals, which adds to the comedy, but they have good intentions and always try to make the best of every situation they get themselves into.",1317427200,3,1639,4.635738831615121

Dave Chapelle plays his equally dimwitted friend. Together these two bufoons concoct the idea to kidnap Ms. Crock's beloved dog. The plan goes awry and people think that her servant, Norm McDonald has been kidnapped. Chapelle and McDonald have to adapt to their scheme to convince Ms. Crock, who really couldn't care less, to pay the same ransom for a human. Things continue to go wrong and it's one hilarious blunder after another.

This is basically a very fun movie and I would recommend it for young children if not for some of the sexual references. I also think some female senior citizens might take umbrage at the copious use of derogatory appellatives such as: hag, prune, crone, etc.",1173571200,2,868,4.786666666666667

I think I laughed ONE time, when Danny Devito's character noticed all the wanted signs with his face on them....that was it as far as laugh out loud funny in my opinion. Norm McDonald is not at his comedic best in this movie. Rent it don't buy it is my best advice!",1168473600,2,411,3.963855421686747
1287025,3,B00003CWQ9,"Norm MacDonald plays Willard Fillmore, the lifelong manservant of Virginia Crock.  Miss Crock owns a baking company, is extremely rich, and mistreats Willard in almost every way possible.  Willard is willing to put up with it until he finds out Miss Crock is planning on firing him, and he decides to get together with his buddy, Rusty P. Hayes, played by Dave Chappelle, and kidnap her dog, Muffin.  Well, the kidnapping goes awry and Willard ends up ""kidnapping himself.""  From that point, in their quest to get the 5 million dollar ransom, Willard and Rusty meet up with Grover Cleaver, a worker a the local morgue, played by Danny DeVito in a disgusting role.

Screwed has quite a few extremely funny moments.  Namely the fake kidnapping videotape that Willard and Rusty make at the local store.  I think that Norm MacDonald is one of, if not THE, worst actors I have ever seen.  That is why I love his movies.  Dirty Work is one of my all-time favorites.  Unfortunately, Screwed does not meet Dirty Work in the humor category.  That is probably because the film is more dependent on the whole kidnapping story, whereas Dirty Work was pretty much just a vehicle for Norm to run with his role however he wanted to.  I would recommend this movie for Norm fans, and also fans of Dave Chappelle.  His role is limited, but he is still hilarious when on screen.",1139011200,,1359,4.635983263598327
1287026,3,B00003CWQ9,"It's really pretty funny, tons of famous faces keep showing up and  you don't have to pay very close attention to keep up.  Nice mindless easy humour.  No academy award winner, but funny enough.",1128729600,,194,4.647058823529412
1287027,3,B00003CWQ9,"The first time I saw Screwed (2000), I wasn't very appreciative of the film, but after viewing it for a second time, I think it's growing on me, as I liked it a little better, although I doubt if I were to watch it again, I would like it even more, as it's not really a film that merits viewing more than I already have....  The movie was somewhat funny, but I'd hardly recommend it above other comedies, that is, unless you've seen them all and you're just looking to rent for the sake of renting something.  The film, written and directed by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, better known for their biography pictures (Ed Wood, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Man on the Moon), stars a solid cast in SNL veteran Norm Macdonald (Dirty Work), David Chappelle (Half Baked), prominent stage actress Elaine Stritch (Krippendorf's Tribe), and Danny DeVito (L.A.Confidential).

The film features Norm Macdonald as a hapless manservant named Willard Fillmore, who works for a well-to-do, nasty, miserly, old biddy named Mrs. Crock (Stritch), owner of a popular baked goods company.  I use the term `manservant' loosely, as Willard is more of a slave, working for peanuts, forced to endure the abusive antics of his employer, until he finally can stand it anymore, and develops a simple revenge plan with his best friend, Rusty P. Hayes (Chappelle), owner of Rusty's Juicy Chicken Hole, to kidnap Mrs. Crock's beloved Pomeranian Muffin, and hold it for ransom.  Well, as we all know, even the simplest of plans often get tripped up with complications, and here is no different.  Somehow the authorities presume it was Willard who was kidnapped, as Muffin managed to escape and return home before missed, forcing Willard and Rusty to change their plans to now go along with the idea that Willard really was kidnapped, subsequently asking for more money from Mrs. Crock (who, incidentally, isn't inclined to pay, not for Willard, at least).  From here the plans continually get more befuddled, complications get more, well, complicated, as the two kidnappers get deeper and deeper in over their heads, trying to stay one step ahead of the authorities.

The film, meant to be a homage to the screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's (according to the production notes), has its' moments, but lacks the charm of the movies its' trying to emulate.  The cast is solid, featuring Macdonald, who I've always though a bit under-rated and suffers from not only having a type of humor with limited appeal (I really liked his previous film Dirty Work, which is much funnier than this, but did very poorly at the box office), but also a lack of suitable roles, often stuck playing secondary characters in Adam Sandler features.  I think the same goes for Chappelle, whose show on Comedy Central is extremely funny, but is often relegated to lesser roles in features, unable to really show off his true comedic talents.  I think both of these actors did well with what they had, but were perhaps miscast in their roles.  Stritch does a fine job, but it was kind of odd seeing her take a role that seemed beneath her, especially given her past theatrical stage experience.  I guess one can say she's not one of these haughty actresses who regards this type of work negatively, or else she really needed the money (funny how one's artistic integrity is sometimes inversely proportion to one's economic needs...) Danny DeVito is pretty funny as Grover Cleaver, an odd, simplistic character who works in a morgue and is hired by the boys to provide a corpse (watch the film to find out why).  The scene where Grover is discussing various items he's found inside cadavers and his speculations as to their various points of entry, is pretty funny, especially the reaction of Rusty as Grover starts handling a particular musical instrument (you can catch this scene on the trailer).  I think the biggest problem with this film is what it was trying to be...as I said before, the production notes present it as a homage to the screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's, but people who enjoy those probably won't enjoy this as it often incorporates the crude humor of an Adam Sandler movie (but not enough to warrant those who enjoy that type of humor to run out and see this film) and people who like Adam Sandler films probably won't appreciate (or understand, or care about) the subtle homage to those films made so long ago.  I got the feeling they were trying (and failed to some degree) accommodate a segment of the movie-going public (that large group who made Sandler so rich and famous) with the vulgar material, perhaps compromising their initial artist vision of a truly faithful modernization honoring of those films from the past.  There are some very funny moments sprinkled throughout the film's 82-minute run-time (it certainly helped that the movie wasn't dragged out much longer), but not nearly enough to keep many viewers satisfied (Dirty Work differed in this aspect most likely because it was partly written by Macdonald).  Ultimately, the film is good for a few laughs, but suffers from, in my opinion, losing focus on the fundamental scope of the project.

The wide screen (1:85:1) picture on this DVD is excellent, as is the audio.  Special features include a theatrical trailer for the film along with one for Man on the Moon, production notes, biographies and selected filmographies of the main cast and crew, and a Universal weblink (oh boy).  Maybe once the writers/directors Alexander and Karaszewski got this out of their system, they can now go back to doing what they do best, with their popular biopics.  There's certainly nothing wrong with trying new things and broadening your horizons, but there's also something to be said for sticking with what you know.

Norm McDonald, sorry to say hasn't found the right vehicle to match his comic talents, is a stitch as a overworked underappriciated gopher type for a greedy, nasty 'stitch' of a woman.  He comes up with a plan to kidnap her dog, which turns into his own kidnapping which turns into...well it keeps turning and rather cleverly.  Yes, this movie is lame at times, and clever at times.

1287126,4,B00003CWQ9,"Screwed is a very funny movie with a great cast regardless of what critics said about it.  Willard Fillmore is a butler badly mistreated by his boss, Miss Virginia Crock, the owner of a huge pastry business.  Willard and his friend Rusty decide to get back at her by kidnapping her dog and getting a huge ransom out of it.  Then, the kidnapping goes wrong and everyone thinks Willard is the one who was kidnapped.  From here on in, Willard and Rusty must figure a way to get out of the mess without screwing themselves over.  Sure, some of the humor has been done before, but it is still very funny.  There are plenty of laughs throughout.  Screwed will keep you interested because from one scene to the next you're never sure what is going to happen next.
  Norm Macdonald is very funny as Willard Fillmore, the mistreated butler who decides to get back at Miss Crock.  There is just something funny about the pitch of Macdonald's voice when he screams.  Dave Chappelle is equally funny as Rusty, Willard's friend and partner in crime.  The two of them together are great.  Danny DeVito is also good as morgue worker Grover Cleaver, who gets caught up in the whole mess.  Screwed also stars Elaine Strich, Sarah Silverman, Daniel Benzali, and Sherman Hemsley.  The DVD offers the theatrical trailer, widescreen presentation, and production notes.  For a very funny movie with plenty of laughs, check out Screwed!",1076630400,10,1413,4.729508196721311

1287130,5,B00003CWQ9,"I did enjoy the movie screwed but even I have to admit that the plot is pretty screwed up. First off all we have a chauffer, Willard Filmore (Norm Mcdonald) who works his butt off for his tyranical boss, a wealthy old woman Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch), and gets very little out of doing this and gets no respect. But When Willard finally goes nuts when all she gives him for christmas is a pie. A PIE???? she is rich, she owns a pie company, and all she gives him is a pie after all he has done for her. He does everything for her. I mean literally, he does EVERYTHING for her. And for going nuts, she decides she is going to fire him. After, Willard goes to his friend, Rusty (Dave Chappelle) and they decide to get back at Miss Crock by kidnapping or should I say dognapping her dog. Things were going okay except the dog was barking. Will puts hand on the dogs mouth but the dog starts biting his hand and getting blood all over the walls. They managed to get the dog off the hand and write a ransom note for $1 million. But things weren't going as well as they seemed. Behind their backs, the dog escapes and returns home seeming like the whole thing never happened. When Miss sees the damage, all she was shocked about at first was that her paining got messed up because of the blood, not worrying about the blood on the wall or the damage. Now that is a screwed up scene. Anyway, when the boys see the morning paper it SAYS THAT WILLARD IS KIDNAPPED! Everbody thought the note was meant for willard. And the whole story gets over town quikly. Now Willard cannot show his face in public. They are totally screwed. At first they trie to use this buy raising the ransom, sending a video of willard being ""locked up"", causing the public to have Miss Crocks company to go down and forcing her to pay. But at the sametime, detective (Dan Benzali) is getting close to figue out this case. So they decide to go to a morgue worker (Danny Devito)to make people think Willard is dead. Now doesn't this movie sound screwed up???
Anyway, there are funny scenes in this movie. There was a scene where willard was trying to clean windows but he fell off the ladder and then the ladder falls on him! And there are also times where Rusty keeps hitting people with desklamps because he is scared.
Mcdonald and Chappelle made a good duo in this movie. They will make you laugh because of the stuff they do and say. Although the plot is screwed up, it is still funny and worth buying.",1031875200,,2470,4.313978494623656

SHe is so funny and it is refreshing to see an older lady both leading and being able to have a spotlighting role. She is funny as the cantankerous and hot-tempered millionaire who has her dog kidnapped for ransom by her chaffeur/butler, etc only for the dog to return.
