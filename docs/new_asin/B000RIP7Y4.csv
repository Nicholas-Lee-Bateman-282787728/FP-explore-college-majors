8200830,5,B000RIP7Y4,"I've owned this video for almost 9 years and it is one of my favorites.  I do it until I get bored, go to something else, and then come back to it again.  What I love is the mix of strength exercises with cardio.  When I take a break and come back to it, I can feel my muscles burning the first few days after following it.  I know it works my muscles, gets my heart beating, and it's short which also appeals to me.  My video is wearing out after all of these years so I came on Amazon to find a replacement.",1353283200,2,509,3.855769230769231
