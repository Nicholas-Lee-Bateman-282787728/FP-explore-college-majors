Wisely made me quit my job and search for the true Santa's of this world. Its truly an eye opening experience that will have you laughing, crying, and WTFing nearly the entire time you're watching it. Its truly an experience everyone needs to see for themselves.

11/10 stars!",1286409600,,402,4.826086956521739

I can't believe a program with such high morals was not shown on TV this past Christmas. A friend of mine suggested that I buy this video for my children, but I enjoyed it as well. This video is first class, and I like my friend highly recommend it. If anyone is looking for a new Christmas classic, this could be it.",1011657600,2,407,4.285714285714286

The story plot is a great lesson for children to learn the true spirit of Christmas.
