8534169,5,B003PAVNLC,"A little know opera buffa by the marvellous Gaetano Donizetti  who managed to create well over 60 full operas and a large body of songs and other musical pieces.
Le Convenienze ed Inconvenienze Teatrali is a satirical opera on the rules or accepted arrangements of the opera world (singers rankings, billing position in the promo material etc, what pieces they should expect to sing and the like  and the envy, rancour and general problems that ensue.)  The action could easily be transposed to modern day Hollywood or a regional/suburban amateur theatrical company  you get the idea  its the posing, bitching and antics that go on.

This is the two act version that premiered in Milan in 1831 as there was a one act version originally in 1827 in Naples.

Its got a Neapolitan flavour with one of the main characters being Mamma Agata  the pushy mother of the second soprano (not the Prima Donna) slipping into singing in dialect on occasions.  The name Agata has connotations of aggravation and trouble making  something of a ballbuster and it has been cast by Donizetti for a baritone  so its a reverse of the sometime trouser roles of the Bel Canto (women particularly Mezzos singing mens characters) whereas here its a baritone in drag singing Mamma.

Its a funny opera and if you are familiar with music from this period  you can pick up some pieces, tunes ripped from other sources.  In particular Mamma sings a version of the famous aria Assisa a pie dun salice , Desdemonas mournful aria (seated at the foot of a willow) from Rossinis Otello.  In Mammas version the words get twisted into an aria about vegetables  could have been a precursor to Luke Escombes Vegetable Plot (www.thevegetableplot.com.au).

Inevitably general mayhem and havoc ensue with the production doomed by the vanity, incompetence and arguments of the players.

Its not high art, but a well conceived work with good musical pieces, singing and plenty of opportunity for over-the-top acting.  The players here in the production from the smaller regional opera at Fano do an excellent job with a smart visual set and well cast roles.  Mamma is very well played by Paolo Bordogna  a buffo master, with Donata DAnnunzio Lombardi as the feisty prima donna and Enrico Marabelli as Procolo her annoying and painfully over protective husband.

Its worth it just to see Bordognas entry piece in Act 2 for the above mentioned aria.",1449878400,,2402,4.879012345679012
8534170,5,B003PAVNLC,"Donizetti is best known by his masterpiece ""Lucia de Lammermoor"", and opera lovers usually know a few other of his operas that belong to the repertoire, like ""La Favorita"",  ""Lucrezia Borgia"", ""Maria Stuarda"", Roberto Devereux"", ""La Fille du Rgiment and ""Don Pasquale"". Nevertheless, Donizetti composed nearly 65 operas, and even the most passionate opera lover does not know them all. Donizetti's forgotten operas are resurrected from time to time, and sometimes we are surprised by finding a little gem. That's the case of ""Le convenienze ed Inconvenienze Teatrali"", an ""opera buffa"" that surprises you by its theatrical and musical quality. First, it makes you laugh, by satirizing arias of other composers, and casting a man to sing the character Mamm'Agata, wonderfully acted and sung by Paolo Bordogna. Also, the aria ""Ah, tu mi vuoi"", sung incompetently (purposely) by the character Guglielmo, with German accent, is remarkably comic. Second, some of the original arias are so good that we ask ourselves why we did not hear them before. For instance, ""Lazzarune, scauzacane"", sung by Mamm'Agata, and ""Che credete che mia moglie"", sung by the character Procolo. The vocal quality of some singers could be criticized, but I don't think this is that important in an opera that has been hidden for such a long time. So, five stars.",1286582400,7,1334,5.147465437788019
