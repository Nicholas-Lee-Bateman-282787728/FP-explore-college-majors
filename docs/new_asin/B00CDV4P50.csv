5716774,5,B00CDV4P50,Case closed is one of my (if not) favorite animes. I really hope funimation decides to dub more episodes. The dvd set arrived in perfect condition and so far the discs play great (I haven't been able to try all the discs yet since I bought all 5 seasons and each season has 4 discs). The discs in this box set arrived in perfect physical condition though.,1375228800,,355,4.313432835820896

5716779,5,B00CDV4P50,"The product is complete and is exactly like the prior versions, disregarding the case design. Very good series. Audible languages are English dub and Japanese. You can choose no subtitles or English subtitles. List of episodes inside leftmost case interior. Some discs have bonus content. Only complaint is the ugly green stripe on the outside, but for the price, and being virtually the same excluding that, it is worth the trade off.",1440028800,,435,5.055555555555555
5716780,5,B00CDV4P50,"Another wonderful 2nd season of mystery cases and a young 10 year old boy solving each mystery!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) if you have NOT seen season 1 or read my review on Season 1 its not problem! here is a quick recap.

One day Kudo gets poisioned and now is a little boy again solving cases with his girlfriend who dosnt know he got turned into a boy and her father who is a detective but not a very good one.

8580589,4,B00CDV4P50,"listen... i love case closed. its my favorite. i hold it very dear to my heart and i am thoroughly disappointed that americas dub will never get a season 6 or 7. that said..... of course i am buying case closed. but i have to say i am very disappointed with funimations dvd box art and disc art. what the heck. it's like they are trying to save money by printing on a broken printer. it's honestly painful for the eyes. i do not recommend looking at your dvd case for long periods of time, but i DO recommend the show. it's very fun and very sad sometimes, but super worth it.

funimation PLEASE get your act together this box art is awful",1484352000,2,639,4.195121951219512
8580590,5,B00CDV4P50,Great series I recently started collecting. In my opinion the dub is great and the characters are always enjoyable. A word of caution..maybe its just me but the cover art always freaks out my eyes when I try to look at it. If you are the same way I recommend taking the cover art out and flipping it inside out it makes it more manageable on sensitive eyes. The only problem I had when buying it from amazon was a somewhat damaged and cracked cover. The disks seem to be fine but I really wished that it was handled with more care before it came to me.,1484265600,,552,4.168224299065421
