8026688,3,B0002DFQ4U,"I really only liked the boxing workout. I have his other workouts, but this is one I use for lighter days. Killer Butt was pretty boring, although challenging. I have plenty of other lower body workouts with more excitement factor for me. I found the yoga boring as well, entirely to repetitive and his voice just didn't sit well with me. I didn't find him relaxing or soothing. I liked Petra's workout, but this is not one of her best works. The moves were way to simple and repetitive and that made it less exciting for me.",1331510400,,525,4.422680412371134
8026689,4,B0002DFQ4U,"I have been using those for a few years now - even though I don't do all the sections, the workouts are challenging and really get results. I mostly use the floor sections on both DVDs plus the squats, plies, and lunges sections of the Killer Butt DVD. Those are quick but effective and targeted workouts - perfect if you are short on time / have a busy life yet still want to stay in shape.",1246147200,2,391,4.157894736842105
8026690,3,B0002DFQ4U,"This is a boxset of 4 dvd's. It includes (...), abs, cardio and yoga/stretching.

I personally don't like the interval training cardio one. It was just confusing choreography and too many silly jumps.
I don't have any comments on the yoga one, I haven't really done it.

But I have done the abs and (...)workouts.
The abs one has some very good abs routine, has a section at the beginning that is warm up/cardio, and some kicks, and then moves on to the floor, which is where the workout is.
Very challenging, lots of crunches and some pilates moves integrated with crunches, and plenty of exercises for the lower abs!! It also has a 10 mins bonus section which is the (very painful) floor section from the killer (...) workout.

The killer (...)workout is a ""killer."" It has a lot of plies, lunges in the standing section, and then moves on to the floor section (which is the 10 mins bonus on the abs dvd).
This dvd has a bonus section, and indeed, it is the floor section from the abs workout!

All workouts last around 35 - 40 minutes.

I personally wouldn't recommend buying all these dvd's. I'd only buy the abs workout (which has the (...)workout as well).
And the other 2, not worth the price.",1099526400,12,1200,4.486238532110092
