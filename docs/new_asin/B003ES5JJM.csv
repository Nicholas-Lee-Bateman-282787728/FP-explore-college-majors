8395604,5,B003ES5JJM,"This is a small show that hasn't gotten much publicity but it's an absolute hidden gem! I got into it very randomly watching some of the re runs on MTV when it was still airing and I was captivated by the show. First I couldn't figure out whether it was a reality show, documentary or a sitcom. This show can be described as a show filmed in a reality show style but with heavily scripted sitcom-like situations. Yet, despite the obvious scripting, this show feels real and Liz Lee, it's star, is very relatable. We're rooting for her the whole time, whether it's auditioning for the talent show or trying to win the heart of her crush, Bryson. There were only 9 episodes and I wish there were more because this show is very fun to watch. Don't try to figure out what's real and what's not and just view it more like a cute teen sitcom. The ""characters""/kids are very endearing and despite the short running time, we really get to know and love them. I can't wait until next season!!!",1280102400,10,984,4.412087912087912
