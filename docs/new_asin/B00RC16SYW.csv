6925429,2,B00RC16SYW,seen it all before,1425081600,,18,3.75
6925430,4,B00RC16SYW,"Good overview, thorough examination",1425081600,3,35,8.0
6925431,1,B00RC16SYW,"Completely agree with MrQ - I lost interest when they started describing the JFK assassination as a mob hit.  All that is needed is Oliver Stone and we would have had a five-star rip-roaring conspiracy movie.  Except Stone is a good film-maker, and this is boring",1424649600,,263,4.695652173913044
6925432,5,B00RC16SYW,Very knowledgeable people providing very detailed and insightful information.,1424649600,7,77,7.666666666666667
6925433,5,B00RC16SYW,"I recently watched the Danny DeVito helmed Jack Nicholson ""Hoffa"" which was a HEAVILY fictionalized take on the life of America's most iconic labor leader. If you want the real story check out ""Killing Jimmy Hoffa"". I'm a crime doc buff, but so many of them just recycle the same stories- but this film has amazing research-be prepared to concentrate if you want to follow the intricacies of Jimmy Hoffa's story. The film goes in depth into Hoffa's involvement with organized crime and his links to the JFK assassination. The last half of the film is, first time I think anyone ever really did this, a nuts and bolts break down of every suspect and every theory in the case, ending with the filmmakers own theory of what happened-which actually is probably as close to the truth as we will ever get. Amazing photos, amazing local Detroit news footage circa 1975 of all the suspects going in and out of court, and the range of interview subjects is great -from a college professor to multiple FBI agents that actually worked the case and Prosecutors who oversaw the investigation and the leading expert on the case- Dan Moldea. Highly recommended.",1423958400,22,1146,4.763819095477387
6925434,5,B00RC16SYW,Best documentary I've seen on the subject to date. I've always been interested in the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa but most of what I've seen and read is a little dated.  Killing Jimmy Hoffa gives the viewer a refreshed and appealing look at this old mystery.  I especially liked how they focused on the different theories surround the disappearance.,1423699200,8,350,4.915254237288136
6925435,1,B00RC16SYW,"Ten minutes in, and the mission of this film is obvious: It's about the storytellers, NOT Hoffa. I would wager that if you added up the run time of the shots taken of the storyteller's running their traps, that time would equal or exceed that taken by the stock footage that accompanied their shots.

Al Profit is a young, fresh face to documentary film. That short track record gets him a free pass by this reviewer. I certainly hope the style used in ""Killing JIMMY HOFFA"" is put in the past along with this film. It is *very* distracting and ... well, it just stinks. I don't want to sit and a watch people tell me stories---that's what the Charlie Rose show is for.

I do recommend keeping an eye out for this guy's future works, but I advise spending your 1.3 hours elsewhere.",1423353600,,781,4.416666666666667
6925436,5,B00RC16SYW,Director Al Profit did it again! Another great documentary.  I learned so much watching Killing Jimmy Hoffa about Jimmy and that time period.,1422403200,2,141,5.130434782608695
6925437,5,B00RC16SYW,Very informative,1484179200,,16,7.5
6925438,2,B00RC16SYW,"OK, nothing new",1483920000,,15,4.333333333333333
6925439,3,B00RC16SYW,"Good documentary. Nothing really new here or enlightening, If you don't know a lot about Hoffa you'll find this interesting.",1483574400,,124,5.25
6925440,5,B00RC16SYW,Excellent documentary and take on Jimmy Hoffa,1483401600,,45,5.571428571428571
6925441,4,B00RC16SYW,"I'm a Jimmy Hoffa mystery,I thought this is one of more informative documentary about him and  his rise and  fall!",1483401600,,114,4.65
6925442,5,B00RC16SYW,This was very interesting and engaging to watch.  I learned things I never knew about a mystery which never seems to end.  I highly recommend it if you like to watch this sort of thing.,1483401600,,185,4.257142857142857
6925443,5,B00RC16SYW,"Extremely interesting and well researched.  The relationships were so intertwined between the U.S. government, the union, the Mafia and foreign governments that investigators could work for years and not be able to determine exactly who was responsible.  Hoffa has some things going on at the time of his disappearance that I don't think the general public knew about.",1483401600,,368,5.327586206896552
6925444,3,B00RC16SYW,"An interesting, very exhaustive treatment of the life of this somewhat nefarious character.  However, it did not completely sustain my interest to finish it in one sitting.  Nevertheless, a credible effort on the part of the film-makers.",1483315200,,237,5.378378378378378

6925454,2,B00RC16SYW,Decent but slow,1478476800,,15,4.333333333333333
6925455,4,B00RC16SYW,"It was pretty good.  I enjoyed hearing from the academics who had researched his background a good bit, but I felt like the story jumped forward too quickly.  I would've preferred something more in-depth.  However, if you're interested in this sort of thing, you'll enjoy understanding the why and possible suspects.",1478044800,,316,5.1568627450980395
6925456,5,B00RC16SYW,Great,1477958400,,5,5.0
6925457,4,B00RC16SYW,"Very informative, but jumped around a lot.  Almost seemed as if they had a major deadline and tried to cram in as much info as possible before they went over-budget.  Several incidents I never knew happened.  A couple of plausible theories.  Would recommend.",1477526400,,258,4.930232558139535
6925458,5,B00RC16SYW,All of the facts to this book have been verified. A death bed confession by his friend leads to a lot of missing facts. It makes for a read you can't put down. Jimmy Hoffa's son feels this story is true. We read it cover to cover,1476489600,,229,3.893617021276596
6925459,3,B00RC16SYW,"questions remain,",1476403200,,17,8.0

6925467,5,B00RC16SYW,I just enjoyed it,1475193600,,17,3.5
6925468,5,B00RC16SYW,"I enjoyed this. Will we ever know what happened to Jimmy Hoffa? Maybe not but it raised more questions for me. It sure made me go ""Hmmmm""",1474848000,,137,4.111111111111111
6925469,4,B00RC16SYW,"If you saw the Sam Gianconna movie which had the mob all over the love lives of the Kennedys, this closes the loop on the assassinations and coverup of JFK. The tonality is good. The reach maybe not far enough. But it builds well on the legend of Hoffa.",1474675200,,253,4.183673469387755
6925470,2,B00RC16SYW,Interesting and informative documentary,1474243200,,39,9.0
6925471,3,B00RC16SYW,"Ok.  Not that in depth but a good start for those that haven't read much about Hoffa.  Of all the theories I've read about the Hoffa disappearance, the one that makes the most sense to me is the Frank Sheeran account, which is completely dismissed in this documentary.  My issue with that is it seems to be dismissed without any real research, just the participants unwillingness to believe him.  Oh well, I guess we'll never know!",1474243200,,431,4.631578947368421
6925472,5,B00RC16SYW,Put the Jimmy Hoffa disappearance into context.,1473984000,,47,5.857142857142857

6925476,4,B00RC16SYW,Very accurately depicted the life and Times of Jimmy Hoffa,1473465600,,58,4.9
6925477,3,B00RC16SYW,It's not a nice story.  Documentary well done.,1473120000,,46,4.75

6925479,4,B00RC16SYW,Interesting story on labor history/American history.,1472947200,,52,7.833333333333333
6925480,4,B00RC16SYW,I like documentaries. I thought this was a good one and told us lots of information to let us make our own conclusions.,1472774400,,119,4.217391304347826
6925481,5,B00RC16SYW,Good movie I learned a lot about Jimmy Hoffa.,1472774400,,45,4.111111111111111

6925485,2,B00RC16SYW,It was not as interesting as I thought it would be it was an ok documentary.,1472774400,,76,3.8125
6925486,5,B00RC16SYW,"Finally a very good documental. One of those cold cases and pending puzzle for the new and old generations. Hope AMAZON can support this type of documentaries.  Nowadays the media, news and source of power are building layers of grays across history that are misleading new generations with artificial history tokens. We need to go back to the facts and objective journalism to recover the roots of the true.",1472169600,,408,4.913043478260869

6925494,4,B00RC16SYW,Worth watching,1470873600,,14,6.5

6925496,5,B00RC16SYW,Great movie with a lot of theories that I didn't know about. Really gets you thinking!,1470787200,,86,4.4375
6925497,4,B00RC16SYW,Rarely seen interviews with first hand accounts. Excellent.,1470700800,,59,6.5

6925499,5,B00RC16SYW,Very informative,1470700800,,16,7.5
6925500,5,B00RC16SYW,"Good source of information on Hoffa and the element which may have murdered him. All angles are well covered, reasons are given as to who are the most likely suspects, as well as why some should be discarded as suspects. I went in very critical and the film earned my appreciation by a broad and open minded studly of characters. Probably the best Hoffa documentary detailing his possible enemies, their abilities and their motives..",1470096000,,433,4.864864864864865
6925501,1,B00RC16SYW,Horrible! Just horrible. This was supposed to be a documentary filled with facts and historian  recollections but felt like a science fiction story that was filled with opinionated theories that no evidence to backed It up. I mean where they get these guys??? Anything for a buck I guess! One guy even said he believes Hoffa ended up in his hot dog!!! Lmfao! For Chryst sakes man. What the hell were you doing in the FBI for all those years?!??! Probably spent more time at Dunken Donuts than at the office no doubt!,1469923200,,516,4.548387096774194
6925502,4,B00RC16SYW,Another prospective on his murder.  I learned so much from this documentary that had not been posted before the movie.,1469923200,,118,4.9

6925505,4,B00RC16SYW,a lot of interesting info about hoffa and his ties to the mob and his ties to the kennedy assassination from insiders. best guess is he was killed by the mob so he couldn't talk to the government.,1469923200,,196,4.184210526315789
6925506,5,B00RC16SYW,Great movie!,1469750400,,12,5.5
6925507,5,B00RC16SYW,The documentary was very educational about the Teamsters organization. Explains why Hoffa was much feared by mafia and why they eventually killed him. Excellent.,1469318400,,161,5.75
6925508,4,B00RC16SYW,"This was interesting but I'm not sure how accurate it was, especially the ending. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it more this time than the first time I saw it and recommend it.",1469318400,,170,4.516129032258065
6925509,4,B00RC16SYW,Great watch,1469318400,,11,5.0
6925510,1,B00RC16SYW,Has the feel of a slapped together production using stock footage over and over ad nauseam.,1469318400,,91,4.75

6925524,5,B00RC16SYW,An interesting mystery for as long as I can remember. So many different theories and possibilities to how Jimmy Hoffa disappeared.  It's makes me wonder why they made him disappear. Most of the time mob hits of important guys just left the body where it was. Like outside of a restaurant or someplace. It is interesting that Jimmy Hoffa's body had to not be found at all.,1467072000,,371,4.537313432835821
6925525,5,B00RC16SYW,I love the history and mystery of Hoffa. This documentary is worth watching. There's no smoking gun to be found but some of the theories are plausible.,1466380800,,151,4.62962962962963

Having watched this I feel I knew him and I empathize with Jimmy Hoffa. The talking heads interviewed are knowledgeable, but not sensational. Jimmy Hoffa was a great man.

The Kennedys were worse criminals than he was. The Kennedys made their bread and butter from tax dollars, but cheated Uncle Sam at every corner. Hoffa simply crossed the wrong guys and trusted the FBI to protect him. Therefore, he was whacked. This film is packed with information that will enlighten anyone who only knew Hoffa as ""that guy that disappeared.""",1458259200,,645,5.02803738317757

I am not interested in watching a show that glorifies a criminal but the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa is one of the mysteries you grow up hearing about during the course of your life. So, this movie interested me.

I learned a little bit more about who Jimmy Hoffa was and what he did and why others might have wanted to kill him. I thought the director did a fairly good job of setting the stage of the mystery and in explaining why the public is always interested.

I don't know that it was exciting or heart pumping, nor was there a romance. This is a documentary that follows standard documentary format- interview some people, show some interesting shots of the places being talked about, show pictures of the past and so on.

If you have an interest in Jimmy Hoffa, even a little bit, you might find this enlightening.",1439251200,3,972,4.542857142857143
6925660,4,B00RC16SYW,Good documentation,1439251200,2,18,8.5
6925661,4,B00RC16SYW,"Killing Jimmy Hoffa is a documentary based on the mysterious disappearance of the labor organizer. Despite a four-decade Federal investigation and hundreds of suspects, little more is known about the crime today than back in 1975 when Hoffa was last seen alive. The view of Hoffa differs, depending on the source. A self-made man who ran the nations largest union and was beloved by the rank and file teamsters he represented, Hoffa was also associated with corruption. His rise to power coincided with the glory years of the union movement and a steadily growing American economy. This multifaceted legacy has made Hoffa an intriguing, often enigmatic personality.

The documentary nicely chronicles the rise of Hoffa, emphasizing the extent of his corrupt dealings and connections with the Mob. It veers off course, however, by over-relying on speculation, specifically Hoffas alleged ties to the JFK assassination and his alleged role in the planned assassination of Fidel Castro.

For those who know little about the Hoffa mystery, the film provides a fairly accurate primer on basic facts. Specific details about Hoffas early life abound. Interesting is the background behind Richard Nixons pardon of Hoffa (inspired by large cash donations to Nixons campaign fund).When it espouses theories about Hoffas disappearance, however, the film becomes more tabloid in flavor. The theories are fascinating and may be true, but they are based on speculation and questionable testimony, so the claim for the first time, the true story of when, where and why James Hoffa was murdered and why his body will never be found should be taken as hype.

The test of any documentary is making it interesting and avoiding dry regurgitation of facts. Killing Jimmy Hoffa succeeds in this regard and offers a fascinating trip down crime historys Memory Lane. There are no bonus features on the DVD release.",1437350400,7,1890,5.2105263157894735

History has proven that Hoffa cut deals that were in the interest of big business and his personal gain, ran narcotics for the mafia, and stole the retirement funds of the same men he pledged to defend unto his death. Jimmy's hypocritical greed and guiltless villainy knew no bounds.  To top it off this documentary's terrible interpretation and misguided knowledge on who the Kennedy's were and what they stood for could not possibly have missed the mark by a larger span and more laughable premise. The two men who never needed to work a day in their life, yet died working to secure the rights of all are portrayed as classless and self serving egotists, while Hoffa was merely, murdering, bombing, beating, and stealing due to the state of the world.

6925683,5,B00RC16SYW,I grew up in Detroit and was about 5 miles away from his abduction place at the time. So were about a half a million other Detroiters. It was about as safe a place as a place could be at the time but it seems that anywhere Hoffa was was a less than safe place to be. It was long known that he was in bed with the Mob. That he used them for protection. That he loaned them huge amounts of teamster pension funds to build Las Vegas. (I never understood if the teamsters pension funds were paid back). The part that got me is  that I never knew that he was supposed to testify before Congress about two weeks after he was murdered on what he knew  about the assassination of JFK. My father thought that he was a hero to working guys like him.,1428796800,13,739,4.020408163265306

He was no Robin Hood!  He was a crook like all the other Teamster and union officials of those times, who robbed their membership so they could live the high life.

It delves into the complicated and at times interwoven relationship between the three entities.  The film would be of particular interest to Kennedy Assassination conspiracy followers as it analyzes this subject with some new data--some of which touches on a possible connection with Jimmy Hoffa.  The film covers much data and it is clear that the filmmakers did their research.  It kept my attention and opened my eyes to some facts that I was not previously aware of.  Great film for history buffs!",1425168000,7,622,5.0
6925705,5,B00RC16SYW,Being non-American Killing Jimmy Hoffa gave me tons of insights into that specific chapter of American history.

8694784,1,B00RC16SYW,A really amateurishly made documentary.  Nothing new.  Lots of repetitive content.  Too much opinion.  Not enough investigative journalism.  This was just a regurgitation of the past 25 years of Hoffa documentaries.  Don't waste your time.,1527984000,,239,5.685714285714286

8694788,1,B00RC16SYW,"Begins with lies, Hoffa grew up not 15 miles from U.S. Socialist, Presidential Candidate, Eugene Debs HOUSE.
HUGE gaps of American history left out, purposely.
 NOT the kkk, this how sick this is...these are ""fart smellers'- oh i mean 'smart fellows', as we say in the Mid west, never worked for a living, and would not make a hair on any labor leaders ass, even the worst of them. M is history and all fbi black propaganda designed to drive the NON union subjective. The ""fruit"" of these programs is a nation with NO rise in the standard of living since 1967, a debt burdened University educated class who are working 20 hour a week part time jobs, (with the Sociology credit; ""all unons are the mob.'.
I give these Judas credit for helping to break down the free Union Movements of the United States, but I would not trust nor believe them, remember- THEY made paycheck after paycheck on this--a lifestyle.

showcasing those who made money and ""life's work"" on Hoffa, Moldea the worst.
When you make your money on others loses. failures makes you a certan type of sub human, graave diggers, tashologists, living on others trash cans of the rich and powerful. Follow the beatle and get his toilet paper to sell on ebay.
While they did it, & continuing to 2017!! , the Teamsters Pension Funds were seized by the ""bobby Kennedy group"" at the US dept of Just-US, and MIS invested thorough ""preferred"" brokers, CHURN CHURN CHURN,  in the Stock/Bond Markets.
 Follow  the money- see fritz in line at nixons bebee golf course, millions in suit cases to get the phony 'terms' release""of Hoffa, right there behind Ross Per roe, with HIS IBM TENS of millions suitcases,  (salesman of the year!,) to gain the computerize ""account"" for the entire U.S. Social Security system-, ) IBM got the account), follow the money,

WHERE o where is the fed court HELD Labor Union pensions monies INVESTED? hmmm
Urinalists who NEVER put the basic who what where when, to the story, it does show the rise as an ""industry"" fake news, with a ""liberal UAW"" front. Follow the Money.
