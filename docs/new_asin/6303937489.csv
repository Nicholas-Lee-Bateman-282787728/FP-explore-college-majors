7856527,4,6303937489,"Now for those who don't remember the original In Your House PPV series, they were only 2 hours long at a cheap price (less than $20) and were the filler events between WWF's (before it became WWE) big PPV's like Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, King Of The Ring, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series.  During this time, Undertaker & Mankind's war had gone to such extremes (like the first ever Boiler Room Brawl) that it lead to another first in WWF history, a Buried Alive match.  Also during this event, Jim Ross was in the middle of his first attempt at a heel turn with him revealing the bad history between him & Vince McMahon (this was before the Mr. McMahon character) that resulted in him being suspended until this night but kept having issues with his headset & microphone throughout the night.

Steve Austin vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - Almost 3 years before the would have their more famous feud over the WWF Championship, they met here for the first time in a match due to Savio Vega's injury that made this a rare match at this time with two heels facing each other.  Both men tried to intimidate each other with shoves & slaps including one slap that knocked the other guy down before wrestling a back & forth encounter.  However the bigger issue here was Mr. Perfect (who was already scheduled to face Hunter the next night on RAW in his return match) coming down causing a distraction to Hunter but also ended up getting into a confrontation with Austin as well.  This was a good match seeing how both men were heels at the time but was more about hyping up the match for RAW the next night.

Tag Team Champions Owen Hart & British Bulldog vs. Smokin' Gunns - This was a rematch from the previous month's ""Mind Games"" PPV where Owen & Bulldog won the titles.  As we saw in the pre-match interview & throughout the match, Billy & Bart were not on the same page as Bart was concentrating on winning the titles back while Billy was more concerned about getting the services back of his former manager Sunny leading to some miscommunication between the Gunns at times along with Billy at times getting an ego & showing off.  This was an average tag team match but was more about pushing the story & eventual breakup of the Smokin' Gunns.

Intercontinental Champion Marc Mero vs. Goldust - Mr. Perfect came back out to do commentary for this match as it was suppose to be a rematch from the Intercontinental Championship tournament finals between Mero & Faarooq (doing his Gladiator gimmick before The Nation Of Domination) but Ahmed Johnson attacked Faarooq backstage earlier in the night giving Goldust the title match with Lawler pointing out during Mero's pre-match interview that Mero had never defeated Goldust previously.  Both men delivered a good match that traded momentum with Mero showcasing some impressive athleticism & aerial offense but again was more about pushing another storyline going on a Hunter came back down to ringside at one point to go after Perfect only for Goldust to try to get a hit in as well leading to Perfect knocking him out.

Sid vs. Vader - This was all about who was the real master of the powerbomb but had an added stipulation of the winner receiving the WWF Championship title shot at Survivor Series with the current champion Shawn Michaels doing commentary for this match as well.  With both men being two of the biggest men in the WWF at this time, this was strictly a power match as both men executed some impactful moves just to get up on the other like the Vader doing various splashes throughout match in the corner & on the mat & off the ropes while Sid resulted in clotheslines, a big boot, a back suplex, and even an attempt at a top rope crossbody which Vader caught in midair.  Jim Cornette would get involved but eventually pay for it later before both men attempted their powerbombs only for neither on to be able to execute it resulting in Sid's win with a chokeslam.  This was what you would expect from a ""big man"" match but a little disappointing that this entire match was hyped up about who had the best powerbomb yet neither man actually did the move during the match.

Buried Alive Match: Undertaker vs. Mankind - As usual when it came to whenever these two men fighting each other, this was a brawl that was hardcore before the word ""hardcore"" was ever used in WWF as they went all over the place from the ring to ringside & through the crowd down to the actual grave. They used everything they could get their hands on from microphone cords to a sharp object that Paul Bearer brought into the match. Other objects were used like Mankind giving Undertaker a chairshot before Taker would later use the chair to give a legdrop onto Mankind's face along with the steel steps being driven into Mankind's back & face. Just like Undertaker's later encounters like the Hell In A Cell vs. Shawn Michaels & the Inferno Match vs. Kane, this was a first for it's kind and something to watch from beginning to end and even after the match.
[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

In the end, this was the typical ""In Your House"" event where you had good quality action from top to bottom but this edition was mostly about pushing storylines doing into the next night on RAW & Survivor Series so the Buried Alive match is already on DVD, this is a tape I would recommend if you just want to see good in-ring action during this period of the WWF.",1333843200,,5400,4.573498964803313
7856528,4,6303937489,"Thanks to WWE Classics On Demand, I relived another In Your House 2 hour event with this one being entitled In Your House: Buried Alive. This was during the time that the Undertaker & Mankind were continuing their classic feud & were about to take their feud to the next level in another first for the WWF. Along with that, Vader & Sycho Sid were battling for not only the recognition of being the master of the powerbomb but also being the next contender for Shawn Michaels' WWF Championship at Survivor Series. Also throughout the show, you will see the beginnings of Jim Ross's heel character that didn't last long with so many events happening.

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley. Originally, Austin was scheduled to face Savio Vega but due to Vega's injury, Hunter stepped in to take his place. It is ironic that even though both men were heels, Austin got a popular reception from the crowd. This match was different than the matches that these two would end up having a few years later as they stuck to wrestling with both men going back & forth while showcasing the kind of workhorse that Austin was before his neck injury in 1997 along with Mr. Perfect having a cameo in this match. Great opening contest along with the comedy added from Jim Ross having problems his headset.

WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart & The British Bulldog vs The Smoking Gunns. This was a rematch from the ""Mind Games"" PPV the month prior with the difference being that Billy & Bart not having Sunny with them at ringside. This match was similiar to that match as Billy was more concerned about impressing Sunny than winning the match as it showed with him missing moves & having missed communications with Bart throughout the match. And just like their previous match, this was a good tag team contest but again this was more about the continued tease of the break-up for the Gunns.

Intercontinental Champion Marc Mero vs Goldust. Again originally, Faarooq was supposed to have this title shot but during the Free For All, he was taken out during a confrontation with Ahmed Johnson. Also, Mr. Perfect made another appearance here to do commentary in support of his new friendship with Mero along with Hunter returning to ringside to confront Perfect. Now about the match itself, this was another good match that I actually enjoyed more than their SummerSlam match since this didn't come off as a filler despite everything else going on within the match.

Sycho Sid vs Vader. The battle of the powerbombs with the stipulation adding that the winner will receive a shot at the WWF Champion Shawn Michaels (who was also providing commentary for this match) at the next Survivor Series. Before the match, you got a bit of a chuckle on who Shawn wanted to win & what he did to Jim Cornette. The match didn't last long but it was a good performance from both men as both men used their power offense while at times, trying to execute their own powerbomb but it was a different move that ended this one.

Buried Alive Match: The Undertaker vs Mankind. The first ever Buried Alive match & just like their previous encounters, this was really something to see as they brawled all over the arena including various times at the grave site along with steel steps & chairs coming into effect to make moves more impactful including one chairshot that Taker gave to Mankind's back that sounded sick on impact. One thing to look out for would be Taker's ability as he does a couple of high-risk moves including one dive off the top turnbuckle to the floor & leaping over the guardrail onto Mankind. In the end, Taker wins the match but ends up getting buried alive by the WWF heels & one particular person that would go on to be Paul Bearer's bodyguard in the Executioner.

Overall, this is one of the best In Your House events that they had along with this being one of the best events of 1996 as every match on the card was solid with the main event standing out above the rest. On a side note though, the main event has been released on Taker's DVD",1285804800,,4038,4.585872576177286

Hunter Hearst Helmsley V. Stone Cold Steve Austin

Good opener and very weird match because three years later at No Mercy (October 1999) these two were in the main event! Oh...Austin wins. ***

WWF Tag Team Championship:

Owen Hart & British Buldog (Champions) V. Smoking Gunns

ok match that was short and sweet. Owen & Dog retain. **

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

Marc Mero (Champion) V. Goldust

Good match with good mat wrestling by Goldy and good high flying moves by Johhny B. Badd....oh I mean Mero. What?...They are the same guy!! Oh Mero wins it. ***1/4

Sid V. Vader

The winner of this gets a WWF Championship match at Survivor Series and well...the less said about this match the better. You just need to know that Sid wins. *

Buried Alive Match:

Very unique and good match with Takr winning even if he does get buried alive and Mankind doesn't. ***1/2

Overall a very watchable show that had some good wrestling and some not good wrestling with Sid & Vader...however, no WWF Championship match on this show, so I think it cheapens it a bit.",1138665600,,1153,4.747474747474747
