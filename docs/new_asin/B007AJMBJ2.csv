5072310,3,B007AJMBJ2,"After seeing Woody Harrelson on Charlie Rose, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  The acting was very good, and the plot was very interesting as far as it went, but as a previous reviewer noted, the ending was quite a disappointment.  It felt like 20-30 minutes of the movie were missing.  The was no resolution, which seems to be a trend with so many recent movies.  I wanted more about what motivated Harrelson's character, and to know the outcome of his situation.",1336089600,2,483,4.647058823529412

5072312,4,B007AJMBJ2,"""I was under attack, I went after the suspect. End of story."" Dave Brown (Harrelson) is an LAPD officer that who does things his own way. After he is caught on tape brutally beating someone after they hit his car his career is in jeopardy. While trying to defend himself against the charge an old alleged crime of his comes back up. This is a really good movie. The big problem is that it is again nothing really original. He acts the way ""Dirty Harry"" acts but has the morals of Denzel Washington in ""Training Day"". The movie has an all-star cast and the acting is fantastic. Harrelson especially is great in this in a very layered performance. He covers everything in this role; brutality, being a smart-ass, father in a very dysfunctional family as well as womanizer. This is a great role for him and the movie is very much worth watching. Again, though the only problem is that it seems like this movie has been done to death. Overall, nothing new but still good. I recommend this. I give it a B+.",1334707200,9,1001,4.445652173913044
5072313,2,B007AJMBJ2,"based in 1999, this one tells the story of an LAPD officer, working at the Rampart division, who is crossing the line and venturing to the other side of the law. This recalls the LAPD Rampart scandal of the era, when officers were framing suspects, and planting drugs and weapons on them. The movie goes between the story of the officer's problems on the job, and the relationship difficulties with his daughters and two exes. The problem I had with the movie was that it focused a little too much on the family situation and not enough on the policing scandal. The film would have been more compelling had it been more focused on the officer being involved in overstepping his authority and getting involved in possible criminal activity. A bit slow and unspectacular, this one was a disappointment.",1334016000,4,800,4.762589928057554
5072314,3,B007AJMBJ2,"With 2009's The Messenger, the trio of writer/director Oren Moverman along with actors Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster, presented a gripping character driven drama that took presented a look at an oft-ignored segment of the military. The three noticeably bonded during the experience, with Foster and Moverman starting their own production house, and the promise of similarly insightful films on the horizon. With crime novelist James Ellroy as co-writer, the three jump into some familiar territory with Rampart, featuring a devastating, feral performance by Harrelson that makes this a film that simply can not be missed.

Harrelson has always been something of an odd bird as an actor, often at his best when playing the morally bankrupt. Set in the 1990s when the Los Angeles police department was drowning in a new scandal seemingly every week, Harrelson plays ""Date Rape"" Dave Brown, a Vietnam War vet with his a code of justice only he can understand. A relic of a dying age, Brown sees himself as some sort of entitled savior. The judge, jury, and occasional executioner of the ""bad people"" in the world, which to his warped way of thinking could be anybody. As delusional as he is dangerous, Dave is the type who can make a racial slur while claiming to not be a racist. ""I hate all people"", he boldly claims.

Continually reaping the whirlwind in both his professional and personal life, Brown is a nightmare to his superiors who don't need the publicity of a rogue cop staying in the local news with his rogue behavior.  He only makes matters worse with one poorly planned criminal undertaking after another in hopes of scoring some quick cash. His financial situation is made worse by his living arrangement, staying next door to his two ex-wives(Cynthia Nixon and Anne Heche) who also happen to be sisters. Family dinner? Yeah, it's pretty awkward. The family, especially Dave's oldest daughter(Brie Larson) have been ripped apart by his public antics.

Dave is a fascinating, compelling character, and Harrelson has never been better. He's basically a car crash taken human form, a man with an obsessive devotion to his profession, even as he corrodes it from the inside. His arrogance and perceived mental superiority, gained irrationally through a failed attempt at passing the bar exam, blinds him to the Hell of his own design. An attempted relationship with an investigator(Robin Wright) looking into police corruption cases is rocky from the start thanks to his own paranoia, and even his old mentor(Ned Beatty) is beginning to see Dave as a lost cause.

Ellroy, whose gritty tales of corrupt boys in blue have made for some terrific films in the past, yet despite Harrelson's epic performance, Rampart never really gets off the ground in the way it should. Something feels missing, and it may have something to do with us never really seeing what has turned Dave into such a chauvinistic, prejudiced pariah. Dave's losing battle against a world he no longer fits in makes for some dynamic moments, especially his showdown with an equally confident investigator played by Ice Cube. Other actors get considerably less to play with, particularly Sigourney Weaver as a police psychologist, and Ben Foster as a homeless war vet in a very minor role. Ultimately, Harrelson at his most visceral is enough to raise Rampart over other dirty cop flicks that have tapped into some of the same ideas.",1332288000,4,3408,4.982425307557118
5072315,3,B007AJMBJ2,"The tagline for Rampart reads ""The most corrupt cop you've ever seen on screen,"" a statement which can only be true if you don't watch too many movies. Dave Brown (Woody Harrelson) is certainly a corrupt cop, but he's far from the most corrupt cop. Cops much more corrupt, more sympathetic and more compelling have been seen onscreen before. Chalk this up to a failure of marketing.

Rampart is the second film by Oren Moverman, following his brilliant 2009 film The Messenger. That film also starred Woody Harrelson, among several others in this cast, and scored him an Oscar nomination. This nomination likely arose from his strengths as an actor, as well as the strengths of the film. Had Rampart been a stronger film he may have gotten a deserved nomination for his work here too. Moverman co-wrote the screenplay with James Ellroy, the well-regarded crime novelist who knows his way around police-driven Los Angeles stories. The film succeeds in presenting its main character as an amoral cop without reason. Dave Brown is not driven by the typical conventions of a corrupt cop movie, existing as he is for no discernible reason. That's certainly an interesting twist, but not everything else falls together so perfectly.

The setting is Los Angeles, circa 1999. Dave Brown is a controversial figure around the police department, having allegedly murdered a serial date rapist years earlier, earning him the nickname ""Date Rape Dave."" His home life isn't any more conventional. He has two daughters, born to two sisters (Cynthia Nixon and Anne Heche) who regard him passively. Things begin to implode when Dave beats a motorist who has wrecked into his car and is caught on tape. An investigation is launched which threatens Dave's entire way of living.

Many familiar faces fill the supporting roles. The film co-stars Sigourney Weaver, Ice Cube, Robin Wright, Steve Buscemi, and an unrecognizable Ben Foster. It's Harrelson and his gaunt appearance that stand out the most. This is a blistering performance, possibly his best, with much more depth than the film itself.

Rampart is well-made with some great acting, but it fails to fully engage. In presenting a character with no moral center it fails to give the audience an emotional center to latch onto. Certainly it does try to make Dave Brown sympathetic with the smallest amount of contrivance as possible, but watching it feels like going through the motions. Nothing in the film feels powerful enough. The ending especially is a point of complaint. As is increasingly typical with independent films, there isn't much of an ending. There's nothing wrong with an abrupt conclusion when it makes a poignant statement about what's lead up to it, but here it feels inappropriate. There's not enough closure. Whatever Moverman and Ellroy were trying to say about their character hasn't come full-circle.

This is a forgettable movie with a performance at the center of it that deserves better. The screenplay is what ultimately fails the film as it feels like Moverman shot the first draft. A bit of polishing, refining the edges may have worked in the film's favor. While Harrelson is given the chance to explore untainted areas of his acting range and that's something worth seeing, you may ultimately walk away from Rampart wishing it was more conventional.",1330819200,42,3320,5.029090909090909
5072316,4,B007AJMBJ2,"""Rampart"" (105 min.) brings the story of Dave Brown, an LA cop going off the tracks, played by Woody Harrelson in an outstanding perfomance. In the beginning of the movie, Brown tries to keep his personal life together, as complicated as it is with 2 kids he has from 2 women who happen to be sisters, and they are all living together. At a certain point, Brown gets involved in a car accident (accidental? set up?) and after the other driver tries to get away, he beats the driver exessively and just happens to get caught on tape.

Things get worse from there, and I don't want to give away much more from the plot, but suffice to say, Brown gets more and more isolated, even as he meets other women in his life. The whole movie is pretty much downbeat, and exposes the utter loniless of the Woody Harrelson character, leading eventually towards the open-ended conclusion of the movie.

The first hour was sorta long in the build-up, but the last 45 min. really shine. This movie has an incredible all-star cast besides Harrelson, with juice performances from Robin Wright, Ned Beatty, Sigourney Weaver, Anne Heche, and Ice Cube. But special mention in my book goes to Brie Larson in the role of Harrelson's troubled teenage daughter. In all, quite a movie, although certainly not for everyone.

I saw this picture late night on cable TV, and feel sorry for those who actually wasted money purchasing it. No wonder that the film was a complete disaster, and a box office bomb.

Don't be fooled by the excellent-looking cast on paper; their talents are totally wasted here for what really amounts to cameo appearances.

For what it is worth rampart is an actual word too. Just saying.... it may have some meaning to the film beyond the police department, as some people seemed to think the film should have been more about this whole scandal.

Woody gives one of his very best performances. In fact, all the performances are great. The whole film flows very well to me. Not getting the complaints about the flow of the story at all. It follows this man around during various portions of his daily dealings and introduces us to his home life. It's pretty simple and straight-forward to me. Especially egregious and surprising is not one mention hardly of the excellent father/daughter screenwriting in this film, in all its horrible glory. No, nothing in this film is meant to entertain you really. It's about immersion, it's about coming to grips with reality in a very negative situation.

Dealing with Race, Police, Relationships, Brutality, etc. No other film has been this honest for a while about some of these events. It's apparent that most Americans would rather live in a fantasy. It's honestly appalling reading some Amazon reviews. The ignorance is so ridiculous that it becomes a farce just reading through them for me.

5072416,2,B007AJMBJ2,"I really wanted to like RAMPART...I did.  I like many ""corrupt cop"" movies like NARC or DARK BLUE.  RAMPART has a great cast, and Woody Harrelson does indeed turn in a good performance.

Harrelson plays an LAPD uniformed cop in 1999.  He's the kind of cop who takes justice into his own hands and isn't shy about stealing from the bad guys to pad his own pockets.  He smokes and drinks too much.  He has a messed up personal life, which includes living with his wife (and their daughter) along with his ex wife (and THEIR daughter) under one roof.  He is quite a womanizer.  He's also shrewd enough and has instincts sharp enough to steer clear of anything actually being pinned to him.  His nickname is ""Date Rape"" because it is widely believed that a few years prior, he stalked and killed a serial rapist...and this has actually won him some grudging respect.

But he becomes embroiled in a a couple of new scandals, and suddenly is finding he may not quite be able to wiggle out of trouble.  As the ""system"" works against him, he scrambles to hold on to his job, his freedom and his family.

The problem with RAMPART is that every single character is unlikable and most are poorly fleshed out.  The movie has what should have been a great cast, but most of the team writer/director Oren Moverman has assembled are only in a small handful of scenes, and their characters are underwritten cliches who are unpleasant to be around.  Moverman co-wrote the film with the great James Ellroy (LA CONFIDENTIAL), but this film feels pasted together from pieces of other ""corrupt cop"" movies and brings nothing new to the table.

Anne Heche and Cynthia Nixon play Harrelson's two wives.  One dimensional and uninteresting.  Steve Buschemi is in one scene and makes no impression.  Sigourney Weaver is a generic lawyer or something.  Ice Cube is a generic Internal Affairs investigator.  Ned Beatty is the deeply chiched ""retired corrupt cop who was friends with Harrelson's father and now works to keep him out of trouble, but maybe isn't such a trustworthy fellow afterall."" Ben Foster is a wheelchair bound homeless man who holds a secret, but the viewer can't even really care about a character like him in this film...someone who OUGHT to generate some sympathy automatically.  The largest supporting roles belong to the usually fantastic Brie Larson (SHORT TERM 12) as Harrelson's oldest daugter, but she's mopey and has been given the most ridiculous rat's nest of a hairstyle, and to Robin Wright, who plays a professional woman who Harrelson picks up one night and they embark on a nonsensical relationship that is ultimately a boring dead end.

Harrelson is good, make no mistake.  If this film had been written well or had something really original to say...Harrelson might have seen major awards attention.  But really, he's bringing his acting skills to this film, but his natural charm (which he showed in things like the recent TRUE DETECTIVE, where he again played a scoundrel in law enforcement) is utterly missing.  Harrelson has a playfulness and an engaging smile whatever he does...but it is absent from RAMPART.  He brings intensity and sincerity...and does a fine job of showing us a bad man slowly falling apart.  But it is not nearly enough to actually make this movie enjoyable or compelling to watch.  It is, in the end, boring.  That's about the worst sin a film can commit.",1394841600,3,3394,4.793459552495697
5072417,2,B007AJMBJ2,"I really wanted to like this movie because the corruption of the police department regarding rampart was a huge story in the city I lived in, but unfortunately, the movie was on the dull side. I get the sense that they stuck to the events pretty closely and Woody Harrelson did a decent job with the role but I found my interests wavering. The movie had a gritty feel and Harrelson is a complex character in that he is passionate about staying on the force even though he can retire with full benefits. As a cop, he does have his own ideals of whats right and wrong, but you get the sense that he became jaded with time. He shoots before he asks questions, takes illegal drugs from heists, plants guns on dead people. Hes also an alcoholic, pops way too many pills, and makes everyone in his life miserable. The problem with anti-heros is that there should be a facet for the watcher to care for him or see how he went on this wrong road, but this didn't happen in this movie. Everyone in the movie is after their own selfish ends and even the misguided girlfriend of David (Woody) doesnt make sense. Why is a successful lawyer, thats beautiful, and seemingly put together dealing with this scummy cop? His family kicks him out, the other cops on the force don't like him and he doesnt seem to care much about it. Theres a connection to some other dirty cops that is protecting him but even they have to cut him loose.

5072449,1,B007AJMBJ2,"This movie had one redeeming quality to it: Woody Harrelson's performance. For an actor that I thought would never be able to pull off a dramatic lead, he proved me very wrong. But to say this was a good movie because of that would be like saying a house fire was good because the cat got out alive.

Woody Harrelson's Dave Brown is in every scene. I'm not exaggerating. The movie is entirely centered on his character. And one of the movie's biggest problems is that it ignores every other character's development, except for Brown's eldest daughter. The supporting cast is overkill - these are talented people in roles with zero substance. What's even worse is that many of these characters behave or speak so illogically that you actually find yourself being embarrassed for the actor. During one of Robin Wright's scenes I actually laughed at the dialogue she was supposed to be delivering in one of the movie's few emotional moments.

In addition to the completely unrealistic characters, the plot will baffle you. Dave Brown could never do what he does in the movie and still be a cop. The filmmakers tried to hide behind the real Rampart scandal to dismiss this, but this fictional story takes place AFTER Rampart was blown wide open by Rafael Perez. Brown receives no real discipline for his actions when in fact the police department would have likely thrown him to the wolves as their sacrificial lamb. They could not keep him on the streets amid one of the biggest police corruption scandals in modern history.

The movie is full of head-scratching ideas or events. Ice Cube plays an investigator who makes completely unbelievable decisions only because the filmmakers couldn't think of a better way to include his character in the story. Brown has lived for years with both of his ex-wives under one roof, with a daughter by each. Wait, it gets better: he cheated on both. Hold on: they're sisters!

Not surprisingly, the end is equally offensive. But by this point, you will have developed calluses to the insulting condescension that has been thrown at you for the last two hours. The final three scenes are some of the most illogical in the entire film. When the first end credit appeared, I actually said aloud, ""Are you kidding me?"" Don't worry, I wasn't in a theater.

If you think critically while watching movies, don't watch this one. Trust me, you will feel offended by it. It is so lazily made that it is very obvious why it didn't make a big splash when it was released. If you're a die-hard fan of Woody Harrelson, you'll love him in this.

5072452,3,B007AJMBJ2,"RAMPART is an interesting character study of a corrupt scumbag cop. Its strongest point is that Brown (Woody Harrelson)is far from being a completely stereotypical scumbag cop. I really enjoyed hating him at the beginning, and never exactly came to like him, but this film truly shows how Brown means well, or at least thinks he does, and allows the audience to empathize and maybe even sympathize with him enough to keep RAMPART from being totally forgettable.

Otherwise, I agree with most of the other reviews here. Despite a compelling opening scene, the so-called plot of this film meanders and is very unfulfilling. It might work better if Brown were not placed in semi-suspension from the police force so early in the film and we could see him in action a little more before all the politics and soap operas begin.",1356393600,,821,4.822695035460993

I am just watching it and waiting and waiting and waiting for some action or thrill. But no. It is just about a cop
who got hated probably by some guys and they pulled a lil accident just to get him in rage and kicking the guy in his guts. Just to tape that kind of cop brutality. Now whats happening? nothing really. Maybe I will see Woody in court real soon.

But why did Sigourney Weaver, Robin Wright, Cynthia Nixon, Ned Beatty, Anne Heche, et al, sign on to this dreck?

The dialogue is overwrought, like an adolescent boy's idea of how adults might talk when they are in trouble at work or having sex with strangers. Take the big name stars out of this movie and replace them with unknown actors of equal talent and what do you have? A really corny R-rated soap opera with more sex and violence that never gets greenlighted at the studio.

Woody Harrelson is on screen nearly every second, and his considerable talents are wasted.

Each must have been working off some contractual obligation to the studio; it's the only explanation for why they would want themselves associated with this wretched, nearly unwatchable piece of one-dimensional nonsense.

Worse than the waste of all that talent will be the waste of whatever it costs to place this movie in your range of vision (even if its free!), and the following waste of the nearly two hours of your life you won't get back.

How a film incorporating bigamy, police brutality, toe-sucking, serial infidelity, murder, robbery and police corruption could stay soporific from wire to wire is anybody's guess...but it happens in this movie.

That sounds great;  it's even part of the lyrics of a popular song, but it is not accurate. What I like about this movie is Woody Harrelson's bravura performance as Dave Brown, a police officer who has no redeeming qualities. He is unsavory, pure and simple.

It's set in 1999 at the time of the Rampart scandal in the LAPD. Corruption was rampant at Rampart, not to coin a phrase. The movie's Brown is corrupt. He strong-arms pharmacists to give him mind-altering pills. He kicks people when they're down,  literally and figuratively. He bullies a probationary female officer. He's racist and sexist and essentially despises everyone.  He's not really very bright, although he likes to spout phrases that he picked up while he was failing law school.  None of that evil genius stuff. There's something unsavory about his relationship with his daughter. And there's much worse, but I don't want to spoil it.

There is no hidden tenderness. We don't see him saving a kitten. Nothing about abusive parents who ruined him, absolving him from guilt. Brown is guilty.

The supporting cast is strong. The cinematography captures a hot L.A. summer in the barrio. The direction is spot on.

Catch the unconventional living relationship. Brown lives with his two ex-wives.  These ex-wives are sisters who know that Brown is a busy womanizer with more hangups than a cloakroom. Never a dull moment at the Brown's.",1343865600,5,1511,4.894117647058824
5072472,5,B007AJMBJ2,"I'm not sure why this movie has such a low average rating. The story telling is absolutely solid, the acting is stellar, the atmosphere is strongly gritty and dreadful. I admit that I came into this movie without any preconceptions of grandeur. I picked it up simply because of the writers and cast. And I found that what we're watching here is a character study of Dave Brown, a cop who doesn't think that he's done wrong along with his downward spiral into violence and madness.

The movie is a little slow moving and I can see why it might not apply to the current ADD movie watching society. But Woody Harrelson is David Brown, the story is as fascinating as the characters are, the writing is stellar, the cinematography-with David Brown's POV dominating every scene-is great, and the film score is brilliant and adds to the film. The cast is star-filled. You really cannot go wrong with this movie. Just watch this and let time slow down. There are no awesome action scenes with explosions every two seconds. This is the way movies were meant to be made, in my opinion, with letting time take care of story and character development rather than constant flashy installments of gunfire and explosions, otherwise known as brain candy, constantly assaulting the senses to create attention and fascination. This movie is fascinating enough without the sparks.

My only problem is that the ending is left way open to interpretation. Perhaps too much.

Other than that, a five star movie. Watch and enjoy.",1343347200,2,1505,4.803088803088803
5072473,5,B007AJMBJ2,"In a 1995 interview, hard-boiled scribe James Ellroy said of the protagonists in his (then) current novel, American Tabloid: ""...I want to see these bad, bad, bad, bad men come to grips with their humanity."" Anyone who has read any number of his books will glean this as an ongoing theme in his work. Later in the interview, Ellroy confides that he ""...would like to provide ambiguous responses in my readers."" If those were his primary intentions in the screenplay that drives Oren Moverman's gripping and unsettling new film Rampart (co-written with the director), I would say that he has succeeded mightily on both counts.

And there is, indeed, a very bad, bad, bad, bad man at the heart of this story, and he is veteran LAPD Sgt. Dave ""Date Rape"" Brown (Woody Harrelson), who earned his charming nickname in the wake of an incident that resulted in the fatal shooting of a suspected serial date rapist. This is another Ellroy trademark; I was reminded of a scene from ""L.A. Confidential"", wherein Lt. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) is cheerfully christened ""Shotgun Ed"" by the chief after gunning down several suspects. As there is a 50-year gap that separates Lt. Exley's era (the 1950s) from Sgt. Brown's (his story is set in 1999), perhaps this is Ellroy's way of telegraphing that the more things change, the more they stay the same...at least regarding those who ""serve and protect"" the City of Lost Angels.

Based on job description, Dave Brown may be a public servant who ""protects"", but the more we get to know him, the more obvious it is that he ""serves"" no one but himself. Despite a career-long propensity for generally disregarding most of the ethical standards one would expect an officer of the law to uphold, Brown has somehow managed to hang on to his badge. While he embodies many defining characteristics of that noir staple known as the ""rogue cop"", he is not quite so in the same sense as, say, Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (who may be a fascist...but at least he's a fascist with principles). Nor is he a ""conflicted cop"", wrestling with his conscience, because he doesn't have one. He does have a Code, of sorts; he may be racist, sexist and homophobic (again, a typical Ellroy protagonist) but as he helpfully qualifies at one point, ""I hate everyone...equally.""

However, Brown's karma is catching up with him, particularly after he flies off the handle when his police cruiser is struck by another motorist (who may or may not be a ""fleeing suspect""). His subsequent beatdown of said motorist is caught on camera, resulting in a Rodney King-sized public relations nightmare for the department that puts Brown at odds with a no-nonsense D.A. (Sigourney Weaver) and an Internal Affairs investigator (Ice Cube). We see an interesting side to Brown in the course of these grilling sessions; he is quite the silver-tongued devil, articulating his viewpoint with a cool intelligence and developed vocabulary that belies his otherwise thuggish demeanor. Regardless, the reality sets in that he needs to scare up serious coin for a defense lawyer, so he reaches out to a crooked ex-LAPD officer (Ned Beatty) who tips him to an ""easy"" cash grab, which of course goes horribly wrong, putting Brown into an even deeper hole.

In the meantime, Brown is becoming more and more alienated from his fellow cops, and (more significantly) his family. His family situation is odd, to say the least. He lives with his two ex-wives (Anne Heche and Cynthia Nixon), who are sisters. He has two daughters (Brie Larson and Sammy Boyarsky), one by each. It appears that Brown needs his family much more than they need him; because it is only after they finally boot him out for good that he really begins circling the drain in earnest, embarking on a thoroughly debauched sex, drug and alcohol-fueled midnight alley roam (a la Nicholas Cage in ""Leaving Las Vegas"").

Curiously, despite the film's title (and 1999 time frame), the story has little to do with the infamous Rampart police scandal of the late 1990s, in which over 70 officers assigned to the division's anti-gang unit were implicated in a shocking laundry list of misdeeds ranging from frame-ups and perjury to bank robbery and murder. There are a few perfunctory references, but I don't believe that the intention here was to do a docudrama. Also, the cops involved in the Rampart scandal seemed to operate from a mindless mob mentality; essentially co-opting the gang culture they were supposed to be countering. Brown is a lone wolf, perhaps an anachronism; a sort of ""last holdout"" to the old school of LAPD corruption that permeates Ellroy's ""L.A. Quartet"", a series of four novels that spans the late 40s through the late 50s (including the aforementioned ""L.A. Confidential"").

Some viewers may find the director's approach too episodic, especially if one is expecting standard crime thriller tropes. So if you're seeking car chases, shootouts and a neatly wrapped ending tied with a bow-look elsewhere. It's what's inside this sandwich that matters, namely the fearless and outstanding performance from a gaunt and haunted Harrelson. Larson (as his eldest daughter) is a standout, as is the always excellent Robin Wright (as a burned out, self-loathing defense lawyer), who nearly steals all her scenes with Harrelson. So, does Harrelson's bad, bad character ever manage to ""come to grips"" with his humanity?  It may be too little, too late, but he does. It is expressed in an extraordinary, wordless exchange between him and his daughter. Both actors play it beautifully; and it's so ephemeral that you might miss it if you blink. So don't blink. Because by the time it registers, Brown has crawled back into the dark urban shadows that spawned him, just another lost angel in the city of night.",1343174400,6,5777,4.925051334702259

5072475,4,B007AJMBJ2,"In an East L. A. barrio known as the Rampart district, Officer Dave Brown (Woody Harrelson) is a brutal and corrupt cop.  Set in 1999, a Viet Nam vet and law school wash out, Brown has an unusual lifestyle (2 daughters conceived with 2 sisters, all living together) to go with his bias, booze, broads and bravado.  Brown is caught on camera, clubbing a Hispanic man within an inch of his life.  This isn't the first incident for Brown and brings back all the negative images of the L. A. police force at the time.

In addition to the sisters (Cynthia Nixon and Anne Heche), Brown seems to hit it off with the ladies in general, especially an attorney named Linda (Robin Wright) who he meets in a bar.  Brown need money to help his defense against charges the city is about to bring, so works with an ex-cop (Ned Beatty) to get the low down on a high stakes card game.  Brown doesn't go there to play cards however.  Due to bad luck or targeted action by unknown people, Brown's plan goes haywire and he's in even more hot water.  While Brown is cool and quick on his feet and with his words, his predicament combined with his unraveling relationship with his daughters moves him toward deeper despair.

 Director and co-writer (with James Ellroy) Oren Moverman has his second outing with Harrelson in the lead.  As in ""The Messenger,"" Moverman has recognized the acting talent he has with Harrelson and pretty much just lets him roll.  The cast is buoyed by Sigourney Weaver as one of the civilians in charge of the investigation, Ben Foster, unrecognizable as homeless man and Ice Cube as the police investigator charged with bringing Brown down.  Unfortunately, there seemed to be only one way out for Brown, but Moverman's conclusion left me cold.

The Blu ray version I have is the single disc.  Special features include a director's commentary track, cast and crew interviews and a behinds the scenes extra.

5072477,4,B007AJMBJ2,"This is a film that the screenplay was co-written by James Ellroy of `La Confidential' `Blood is a Rover' etc. Yes he has his own style and yes he is a demi god amongst his fans, but quite often the allure, sleaze and passion that his books effervesce can not be transferred to the screen, as in `Black Dahlia' and this can be accused of the same flaws.

It stars Woody Harrelson as Dave Brown, chauvinistic, violent, renegade, bad boy cop. He sees himself as doing societies `dirty work' and uses one line quips to justify his ways to fellow officers, like `illegal is just a sick bird'. He is also living with his ex wives who are sisters and both have daughters from him, who are also living under the same, powder keg of a claustrophobic roof. Then he goes off the deep end and beets the heck out of a guy who has crashed into his patrol car and legged it. This is all conveniently caught on camera by a film crew rather reminiscent of Rodney King.

Then he comes under the scrutiny of the Internal Affairs and his nick name of `Date Rape Dave' comes back to haunt him as he is alleged to have killed a known date rapist in questionable circumstances. His drinking and womanising then go off the scale as his career and life begin to fall apart, but he still has friends and options.

A lot of people did not like or enjoy this film, but I found it to be compelling. It has a plethora of stars including Sigourney Weaver, Ice Cube and Steve Buscemi but they have very little screen time so do not really get the chance to have too great an impact, it is Harrelson who carries the whole thing and I feel he does for a majority of the time. He comes across convincing as the silver tongued, albeit some what tarnished, lothario, who prefers liquor to food and violence to reason, despite being more than capable of intelligent discourse.

Where this falls down will be the ending which left me feeling slightly cheated, but if this were a book then I would have had differing feelings, and there lies the rub with Mr Ellroy, he always has his characters larger than life but strangely compelling and that is exactly what we get here. The music is rather good too having been done by Dickon Hinchliffe of `Tindersticks' fame. There is not very much action either so some of the criticisms from that perspective are understandable. However, this is far from being a bad film, but it will not be seen as classic or cult and from the noir perspective, it falls short too but I still liked it hence my rating.",1342051200,,2506,4.394396551724138

I saw this film in a theater in January and thought it was terrific with a great performance from Woody Harrelson. He's also surrounded by an amazing supporting cast who all excel.  And yes this is a dark film about a certainly not-very-likeable, troubled, and out of control LAPD police officer and his gradual descent, loss of control, and relationship problems.  People have complained that there is no story. Well, that IS the story. Plus there's the subplot of an internal investigation and the investigating officer that is trying to take him down.  This is the kind of film that Robert DeNiro might have made years ago with Martin Scorsese directing. And while it certainly isn't a fast paced action film I didn't find it slow and boring as many have complained.  The average film goer now has become accustomed to fast paced quickly edited action films and can't appreciate a slower paced well done psychological character study.  And that's sad!  And no, the ending doesn't tie everything up neatly.  It's open for interpretation and allows you to come to your own conclusion of what is going to happen with this man.

5072480,1,B007AJMBJ2,"If you have two hours of you're life you'd like to waste, be my guest... but be warned - you'd probably have a lot more fun watching you're toenails grow than you will watching ""Rampart"". This movie is so bad that I actually took the time to find out who the writer of the script was so that if I ever met him I could punch him in the face and ask for my money back.  What a tool this guy is - and the director of this lame mess of a movie is a close runner up.
  Don't let this all-star cast fool you - I certainly did.  Sure, the list of actors is long and distinguished, but the problem is that there's no damn story!  I mean ZERO STORY of ANY KIND.  And the ending?  There is no ending.  I found myself checking my blu ray for scratches because I thought it must have skipped a chunk of the film.  Nope.  Turns out the movie just sucked and then the credits started.  Woody Harrelson spends two hours smoking cigarettes, sucking toes, getting drunk, and telling everyone what a ""hard-charging"" bad-ass cop he is without doing anything in this movie that would even remotely make you believe that.  He's a bad cop who's also a bigot, a murderer, a drug addict, a womanizer, a sex addict, a bad father, a bad ex-husband, a bad brother, and a bad son.  It's overkill. You also get 5 minutes of Sigourney Weaver, 3 minutes of Ice Cube, and 2 minutes of Steve Buscemi.  The producers apparently used these actors' reputations to get us to watch this movie, but doing that was the same as putting a turd in a Tiffany's box - looks good on the outside, but then it turns out to just be a load of stinky crap.  None of the actors are given much to say, but they also don't offer anything that would make this movie anything more than a torturous exercise in keeping your eyelids open.  I don't want to blame the actors, but I'm seriously considering boycotting all of their future movies just for being in this horrible movie.
  I'm also dumbfounded by the critical praise heaped on this steamy pile of crap.  Sure Woody Harrelson is a great actor, and I guess he does a great job playing this character, but critics need a reality check and some medications - this film would even put an insomniac to sleep!  This snoozefest is so undirected and lacking in anything even remotely resembling a focused story line that you end up wanting to bang your head against the nearest hard surface out of sheer frustration (and maybe a desire to keep yourself awake).  Very little in this film is based in any fact whatsoever.  No police department - let alone one as large and under the public microscope as Los Angeles - would ever allow a cop to continue to be on the street after being caught on videotape beating a person half to death.  It would have actually been more realistic if they added a local drug kingpin played by Darth Vader.  The movie is so convoluted, it's nearly impossible to follow - or even care about - the story line.  Then once you think you may have figured out what the actual story may be, the credits come on.
  ""Rampart"" is a complete waste of time - unless you really like spending your time trying to follow completely disjointed story lines with no meaningful objective.  It's truly a movie about NOTHING.  Awful movie.  Did I mention I hated it?",1341273600,17,3268,4.362582781456954

I'm usually outspoken when it comes to movies portraying stereotypes, especially when it comes to portraying dumb or on the take cops, but this script, although it showed the worst of police behavior similar to what has been splashed in headlines in recent years, did so in an intelligent reflective manner and then showed an intelligent police counterpoint to those newsworthy headliners.

The movie was well written, scripted, directed and acted by all involved. One indicator of this quality can be found in scenes that carry their weight through silence or soft background music so that the viewer is drawn into the visual-emotive meaning of that event rather than being talked or musically driven toward an understanding.

When someone documents Dave's attack on a man that hits his police car and flees, his career which is truly all he lives for now appears to be over.

""Rampart"" recalls the dark 70's character driven films but it fails to truly capture their essence due to inadequate script that often appears to be improvised (and it's entirely possible that it was but it shouldn't APPEAR to be improvised)and rambles from one subplot to the next. Moverman's direction of his actors is fine--Harrelson and his supporting cast give terrific performances but they aren't abel to overcome the languid pacing of the film and the random structure of the story. The problem is that while the film starts off with promise, Moverman's film stalls by the second act and the story goes nowhere.

The Blu-ray retains the gritty quality and look of the theatrical presentation very well. The audio although not unusually active for a surround mix sounds quite good with dialogue crisp and clear.

We only get two special features a commentary from Director Oren Moverman and Cinematographer Bobby Bukowski discussing everything from the look of the film, to shooting on location and developing the characters for the film.

The only other special feature is a featurette on the making of the film and the parallels in real life that runs about an hour. The featurette has plenty of interviews with cast and crew.

As here, where the unfortunately underwhelming Woody says and does many stupid things and then suddenly whips out one impassioned speech after another, all of them far far far too intelligent and feeling and insightful for his character. It feels fake, just like Ice Cube as a cop.

Say what? Yes, the sellout is complete. The Cop Killa is now not only a suburban dad in inane comedies but also a cop in this inane cop drama. How to shut down insightful and frightening social commentary from a rapper? Give him a cop show. Ice T, Ice Cube...are there any more Ices out there to subvert? What's next: Snoop Dogg as head of the DEA?

And what a lame way to deal with the Rampart scandal. They would have been far better off tackling it head on, and Ellroy could have had a field day with that like he did with the JFK hit in his classic trilogy. Instead we get this lukewarm seen-it-all-before bitter cop with tertiary Rampart scandal ties.

The Rampart deal still deserves a major film of real quality; the best thing yet done on it is the excellent documentary on the dvd for Cellular, an otherwise forgettable flick. But that doc has all the truth and impact this film wants to have, and none of the weaknesses.

Harrelson is in over his head here; I never really bought him as this guy at all. He's just not grim enough. Ellroy's characters have fatal doses of weltschmertz, and that's one thing Woody has very little of. He's just too nice a guy to pull off this bad a guy.

Despite some good moments, and some great speeches given to the wrong actor, Rampart fails to do due justice to its vital subject matter.

He is a tough LA cop who is old school and plays by his own rules. He frequently finds himself in situations where he believes he is ""set-up"" yet he is only ""set-up"" by his own actions. He has moved into a post Rodney King society (1999) where his antics are witnessed, filmed, and not appreciated. There are forces that want this ""dinosaur"" off the force. Woody doesn't want to retire.

His nickname ""Date Rape"" keeps popping up. This was due to an incident where he allegedly killed a date rapist. His ""family"" life is bizarre as expected. He has two ex-wives who are sisters and a daughter by each one who all live under one roof. The older daughter despises Woody. The ex-wives want their space.

In spite of Woody being a colorful character, the film drags during many of the scenes. The home life scenes, while bizarre and revealing, are boring. Watching Woody slowly destroy himself is like watching a train wreak. The film needed better editing, it didn't flow very well.

This is a character study.  Officer David Douglas Brown works for the LAPD and probably has for some time delivering his own brand of street justice to those who he finds particularly amoral or repugnant.  His fellow officers nickname him ""Date Rape"" as a result of his decision to execute a serial rapist.  This kind of action hero behavior is not without an avalanche of consequences which Dave prefers to ignore.

Robin Penn Wright is fantastically understated in her role as a defense attorney who wants to serve Dave up for doing this.  She feels a distant compassion for this ""dinosaur"", as his daughter calls him, but it isn't enough to stop her from pursuing justice.

Dave is a complicated man.  He has two wives who are sisters (...yep) and imagines that despite the heat coming down on him after the brutal beating of a black guy who cut him off in traffic, the family can stay together.  The world has already ended for this guy, that's the problem.  He meets with the truly disgusting Ned Beatty, a higher up in the LAPD and a mysterious character, and it turns out that even an older dinosaur no longer cares all that much.

Sigourney Weaver is the therapist for officers on the job and it's her character that really provides the viewer with a moment of clarity.  Nothing Dave has done has helped anybody; his heroic, tough guy  brand of justice has just made everything worse for his family, his department, and the people he may have been trying to help.  (Or does he just get off on it?)  Ice Cube stars for a about half an hour as a prosecutor who refuses Dave's last attempt at atonement.

5072517,3,B007AJMBJ2,"""Rampart"" was co-written by crime novelist James Ellroy with director Oren Moveman, inspired by the LAPD Rampart Scandal in the 1990s, in which more than 70 police officers were implicated in some form of corruption and the city had to pay out $125 million in civil settlements. The Rampart Division took its name from a main street in its patrol area, and the officers who were implicated in brutality, planting of evidence, and theft, among other infractions, were members of its CRASH anti-gang initiative. ""Rampart"", the film, seems to personify the culture of corruption and its rationalizations in its main character Dave Brown, whose world comes crashing down around him as the Rampart scandal erupts into the public consciousness.

Dave Brown (Woody Harrelson) is a Vietnam veteran and old-school LAPD officer, a proponent of violence, perjury, and frame-ups directed against bad people in order to advance the public good. Just as one of his colleagues has done a deal with a prosecutor to implicate many more in misconduct, bringing heightened scrutiny to the Rampart Division, Brown is caught on video severely beating a man who ran into his police cruiser. This makes Brown a liability to the department, and Assistant DA Comfrey (Sigourney Weaver) encourages him to retire. But Brown won't, and his legal bills are mounting. So he tries to solve his problems his own way, resulting in more investigations into misconduct, led by Internal Affairs investigator Timkins (Ice Cube).

This is a character study of Dave Brown that aspires to be a character study of corrupt cops in general. To a large degree, ""Rampart"" succeeds in that, as it follows Brown on the beat, home from work, where he lives with his two ex-wives and daughters, desperately trying to preserve that awkward domestic situation, to bars where he finds one-night stands with little effort. He even finds public defender Linda Fentress (Robin Wright) who, strangely, likes him. But this is a man who can no longer afford to be the way he is, professionally or personally. Yet that's the only way he can be. He's an immoral person who, instead of learning to control his anti-social behavior, found a place where it was rewarded. A criminal. But he is straight-talking and has the gift of gab.

Dave Brown is one of the best performances of Woody Harrelson's career. He makes a repulsive man comprehensible. For his performance alone, I can't say that ""Rampart"" wasted my time. Harrelson's demeanor and line delivery are brilliant. But I didn't find myself absorbed in this film. In the end, Dave Brown is some dumb cracker who feels righteous when he beats people within a hair's breadth of death, and, when he's not feeling righteous, he shoots people. The viciousness of LA gangs aside, this was an alternative criminality, and the cops who engaged in it were as dull as the ""scum"" they abused. ""Rampart"" sports a prestigious cast for a film of modest budget, and they're great.

Woody is at the top of his game, strutting about like a rooster cruising for disaster. Bobby Bukowski's photography recalls the best cinematography of the 1970s. All the supporting actors are A-list and perfectly cast. I didn't think a film like this could be made in today's America. Maybe there is hope? I guess there is always hope. Art will always find its way out as long as there are passionate artists who will never give up. It's a little disappointing, and almost frightening, to see all these boneheaded negative reviews from 2nd and 3rd class minds. Also, the comparisons to ""LA Confidential"" miss the point entirely. LA Confidential was a trigger happy film with broadly drawn archetypes and a shoot-em-up ending designed to appease the multiplex crowd. Rampart is an unsparing glimpse into the depths of street reality. It's like ""Taxi Driver"" without the cowboy-and-indians ending. There is no resolution here, only a dissolution that speaks to our times.

5072521,3,B007AJMBJ2,"David ""Date Rape"" Brown is not a nice man.  He's a violent, abusive, womanizing, alcoholic cop, who takes liberties with his job and embraces his short temper.  When he brutally beats a man who ran into him, he becomes a target of interdepartmental scrutiny, and must justify his position on the force.

As Brown, Woody Harrelson is nothing short of excellent.  He sinks deep beneath his character's skin, giving his best performance to date.  Brown is a complex character--equal parts brutal and charming, with a moral code that is polarizing but firm.  (He's an unabashed racist, yet the individuals he victimizes are all criminals, guilty of crimes similar to Brown's.)  Harrelson treats Brown as a human being, not an archetype, and the end result is a memorable, deep performance.  The supporting cast is equally enjoyable, with meaty (if small) roles for Ben Foster, Ice Cube, Robin Wright, Ned Beatty, Steve Buscemi, Cynthia Nixon, Anne Heche, and especially Signourney Weaver and Brie Larson.

This stellar cast is one of the films strengths and weaknesses.  The focus is fully on Harrelson (he's in every single scene), but there are a lot of side characters that come and go.  Some are distinctive; however, with the exception of Weaver and Larson (the former due to her performance, the latter a byproduct of the role), all of the female characters are basically interchangeable.  The script (by director Oren Moverman and novelist James Ellroy) is solid, but borrows heavily from previous films; TRAINING DAY and the original BAD LIEUTENANT come immediately to mind, but there are of course dozens of others.  Aside from a fantastic lead performance and solid supporting turns, RAMPART doesn't have anything new to offer this genre.  It's a decent film (I hesitate to say ""nice""), and Harrelson's performance is worth a few viewings; but with all the talent behind it, it could have been so much better than it is.",1337126400,,1926,5.015723270440252
5072522,3,B007AJMBJ2,"Police corruption has always been good for crackling storytelling, sharp  dialogue and riveting performances from talented actors, films like SERPICO and LA CONFIDENTIAL will come to mind, TV series like THE SHIELD or NYPD BLUE, while armed with an excellent cast, a talented writer and a director of immense potential somehow unexpectedly RAMPART ends up being a big let down and a near failure. For starters, it's a rehashed of other better executed ideas, it's a follow the cliches to the end of the maze like a dutiful consumer rodent type movie. Not for one second did I found the film suspenseful, engaging or stimulating, and at the half way mark I walked out to get popcorn and was conflicted with the idea of just leaving the film, or doing my perseeved duty and finishing the flick so I could bad mouth it in public.

Needless, to say I stayed and ate some very good popcorn, and fortunately for me the movie began it's slow process of picking up. The last hour or so of this 108 minute feature does have some good scenes, good exchanges between actors, especially the scenes involving Woody Harrelson's Dave Brown character and his two young daughters. Still RAMPART's biggest flaws seem to come in it's inability to tell a compelling story, based on a script co-written by one of my favorite authors, James Ellroy, it's just him going down familiar territory that he among others have traveled better before, nearly the whole concluding denouncement seems lifted from the Ellroy penned movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Blue/dp/B00005JLO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Blue</a>. Here,  Ellroy's script is lacking in his fine tuned snappy dialogue that can be found in his books and in his public appearances. Ellroy has self declared himself as the greatest crime writer who ever lived, and I might be tempted to concur, but here that bold statement is not evident. RAMPART  is directed by Oren Moverman, who co-scripted with Ellroy, and who's previous film was the wonderful affecting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Messenger/dp/B0036RPM8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Messenger</a>, who's stars, Harrelson and Ben Foster, are present in this picture as well. Moverman shows that he is a natural born filmmaker, he keeps the proceedings well within camera range, if only it was more stimulating to view.

The cast, aided by a continurously moving camera,  is the movie's saving grace. Harrelson is at his best in this leading role, a character that is racist, sexist and a homophobe, he is an otherley corrupt, despicable, amoral human being, it's a real testament to Harrelson's performance that he never let's us loose sight to the fact that he is also a father, and maybe once upon a time became a cop with noble intentions. Other top acting honors have to go to Ned Beatty, Ice Cube and Brie Larson, but the rest of the supporting cast, including Robin Wright, Sigourney Weaver, Anne Heche and Cynthia Nixon, delivery top flight and memorable work. Only Steve Buscemi is unfortunately wasted in what amounts to little more than a guest appearance or cameo.

I may be giving Rampart a passing grade, but I will also try to make it clear that it is not an essential film to see. It's not the cast or the filmmaker's best achievement, and there are plenty of like minded films and TV series that are much more gripping and worthy of checking out. The whole thing plays out like a condensed version of the great FX series [[ASIN:B002M2T1UO The Shield: Complete Series]. If you do watch it, you will want to stick it out through the rough and turbulent first half, then you might see the little bit of grace and redemption that the film has, and that the Dave Brown character lacks.",1337126400,2,3798,5.1260096930533114
5072523,3,B007AJMBJ2,"This film would be almost intolerable were it not for the fact that it is based on incidents that happened in 1999 in the Rampart Division of the LAPD, incidents still unresolved. Writer James Ellroy examined the corruption of the police force and came up with this quasi-true story.  According to Ellroy, `I am a master of fiction. I am also the greatest crime writer who ever lived. I am to the crime novel in specific what Leo Tolstoy is to the Russian novel and what Ludwig van Beethoven is to music.'  What happens on the screen in this film is best viewed with a bit of Xanax on board along with an anti-nausea medication. Oren Moverman co-wrote the screenplay and directs.

David Douglas Brown (Woody Harrelson in a one man powerhouse of a performance) is a veteran Los Angeles police officer, one of the last of the renegade cops who works out of the Rampart Division. Dave is misogynistic, racist, brutally violent, egotistical womanizer, yet he defends himself against many of these accusations as he says that his hate is equal opportunity. Though unlawful, he uses intimidation and brutal force to defend his worldview. The most notorious of his actions is his purportedly murdering a suspected serial date rapist, which is why he has been given the nickname ""Date Rape Dave"". He lives with two of his ex-wives - sisters Barbara (Cynthia Nixon) and Catherine (Anne Heche) - in an effort to keep family together, namely his two daughters, Helen and Margaret, who each have a different sister as their mother. Dave still maintains a sexual relationship with both sisters - whenever the mood suits any of them - while he openly has other sexual relationships with the likes of Sarah (Audra McDonald) and Linda (Robin Wright). His informer is retired officer Hartshorn (Ned Beatty) and street person General Terry (Ben Foster). His boss is Joan Confrey  (Sigourney Waever) who attempts to cover Dave's past deeds but ultimately must face the true rascallion he is. When Dave is caught on video brutally beating a man who accidentally ran into his police car he is faced with decisions that uncover not only his misdeeds but those of his fellow workers.

The cast is filled with fine support (Jon Foster, Ice Cube, Steve Buscemi, et al) who have very little to do, but Harrelson is in every frame obnoxiously smoking cigarettes in a chain smoker fashion. There is not real storyline to follow; we just are forced to watch the wretched life of a disgustingly bad cop with just enough slightly good virtues to keep us with him. As Catherine states, `You know what I think? I think you were a dirty cop from day one. You were a dirty cop with a dirty mind and you dirtied all of us up by default.'

5072524,1,B007AJMBJ2,"I won't recap the story here - what little there is of it - because you can get that from the Product Page description or other reviews.

I was looking forward to seeing this flick. Harrelson's an interesting actor, and I've enjoyed much of James Ellroy's writing. That makes this movie doubly disappointing.

Frankly, there's no ""there"" there. This is simply a character study of Harrelson's corrupt cop, a member of the LAPD circa 1999. We don't know why he's corrupt; there's no redemption; no advancement of the character (he's just as much a jerk at the end as he is at the beginning); there's no plot advancement, as he suffers no consequences for his actions; it's all pretty pointless.

There are glimmerings of themes Ellroy's explored before to much better effect in other works. For example, in this movie there's a ""Crystal Market"" event, a ghostly rehash of the caf slaughter in ""L.A. Confidential"". Ned Beatty's character is similar to the James Cromwell character in that same movie. Things like that. So not only is this movie boring, it's derivative, without all the wonderful elements that made ""L.A. Confidential"" such a terrific movie.

5072526,4,B007AJMBJ2,"The movie in and of itself in some previous reviews were right and not so right in my opinion.

Here we have a movie where some say didn't have much center, much left unsaid or without closure in various areas of the film.  I happen to disagree.  What I see in this movie is a picture of a man who is stubborn in his self-righteousness and sense of misled and distorted justifications of what he has done in the past that have all come together to create a maelstrom of karmic circumstances.  It is his past that has led to his present and his present that has spun out of control because of all of it.  In the end, he begins to see himself in the eyes of his daughters instead of the eyes of his father and he cannot face it so he runs from it, hides from it best as he can.

The thought that there wasn't much of a center nor much closure throughout the movie and its characters only speaks of life which very rarely has a ""center"" or ""closure"" in its multifaceted avenues of relationships, disappointments, regrets, love, hate and self-realizations.  This story could have been told with many other characters with many other backgrounds, this one just happened to be about a cop.

The poignancy of the story itself and how the main character came to be where he was by the end of the movie was the driver behind the vehicle of the movie.  The ending, as some have complained about, was not truly an ending of the story so much as allowing the viewers to utilize their imaginations as to what happened afterward.  It didn't have to have a ""solid ending"" because the ending is propelled by our thoughts and our views not just in the movie but in society itself as well as placing ourselves in the story to come to grips with what came before.

Would I want more detail within the story arcs between characters that could have been examined more thoroughly?  Yes, but that's because I'm a huge fan of storytelling.  However, that would have made for a movie twice as long which is near impossible for a movie such as this.  So the movie went a better route and allowed for us to imagine what happened in between the short scenes played out between the main character and those he came in touch with.  I can't see a better way to deal with such things other than to make a movie that would be way too long for practical viewing.

In the end, I believe four stars is very justified for me.  Five stars of course would be perfection which is VERY rare for any movie save a very few iconic movies.

Rampart is a very exceptional movie in my opinion and I'd be very surprised if Woody Harrelson isn't nominated for his portrayal of the main character.",1337040000,2,2647,4.356415478615071

8513412,1,B007AJMBJ2,"Rampart, 2011 film

It begins with a policeman driving on a street in 1999 Los Angeles. This is an Hispanic area with cultural differences. They discuss French Fries, then policing. A suspect is questioned and beaten to get him to talk. Dave returns home to his family. His daughter has a question about genetics. There is talk at supper. Later he is at a bar and lights a cigarette. No smoking, sir! He meets a woman who has a thing for cops, then smokes a cigarette afterwards. Driving the next day there is an accident. LA brutality? It is shown on TV news. The next day Dave goes to the Police Station to discuss this event. He doesnt intend to retire. Rampart has become a shit storm.

It costs money and bad publicity, so what to do? Dave explains his actions. Then he goes to a bar and meets a woman. Was Dave set up to create the scandal? He should stop beating people. Dave says he did nothing wrong. He doesnt want to retire, and hires a lawyer. Dave meets that woman lawyer, who explains her work. A lawyer advises Dave to stick to the assault with a deadly weapon defense. This trial costs Dave money. Dave chases two masked men, shots are fired! It was self-defense. Officer Brown must explain his use of deadly force. Dave worries about his situation. He talks to Linda in her house. On patrol he talks to a man in a wheelchair. Dave talks to a man at a restaurant.

He is not a racist, he hates all people. Later he meets his daughter. A telephone call tells him his phone is tapped! At night he visits a basement club. His meal disagrees with him. He visits his ex-wife and is rejected. He talks to theat man in the wheelchair who asks for money. He visits that woman lawyer at night and has an emotional outburst. Is someone trying to bury Dave? His daughters drop off his clothes. They talk. Dave says he never hurt good people. His daughters leave him. He picks up his gun. Later he speaks into a recorder about his past killings. Its the wrong confession says Timkins. Later he watches a house, then returns to his flat.

This could have been much better with a different story. It runs on too long and aimlessly meanders. Does it have meaning? The scandal in the Rampart Division involved stealing drugs and money from the Evidence Room, as well as beating suspects. Do these scandals result from official mismanagement and a lack of supervision? Could this happen in most small cities?",1520208000,,2407,4.463636363636364

8513414,2,B007AJMBJ2,"I truly enjoy any role filled by Woody Harrelson. He certainly is one of the industrys most underrated, albeit finest actors.  But Rampart is a bad movie from the start and not by any fault of Harrelsons. His performance makes the movie watchable to the end.  But the screenplay and direction is absolutely awful.  Incredibly drawn out and boring.  This film had a great cast yet they were wasted with a bad director.  I especially didn't like the way the movie ended.  What it showed me was that the writers lacked the creative thinking to come up with an ending to the film so they simply cut it off - for artistic reasons.  There was a muiltitude of ways to finish it up, any one of them could have possibly saved the entire movie.",1510012800,,734,4.432835820895522

8513417,1,B007AJMBJ2,"This is a pretty boring movie, set in the late 90's in the aftermath of the Rodney King ridiculously huge financial windfall given to him by the courts.  Woody Harrelson plays David, a cop who isn't going to change the way he does things, such as beating information out of a man detained who assaulted an officer while being apprehended..  His character though is a bully, we're introduced to him bullying a new female officer into eating fries that she bought to share, only wanting to eat a couple herself, when they've stopped for lunch.  This means we don't like him so aren't impartial viewers when his patrol car is t-boned shortly after that, the panicking driver assaults him when he gets out of the car and runs, which of course earns him a beating with his truncheon from David in a park across the road, which like with the Rodney King incident is being filmed by someone who conveniently left out what the crim did at the start before pressing record.

Then well not really much happens, he's investigated by Sigourney Weaver, but he's not backing down that he did nothing wrong.  Weaver's character comes across as someone who's more interested in making the problem go away, than caring about her fellow officers in the aftermath, especially the accused one.  She's certainly not an impartial investigator so is another unlikable character.  But this isn't a trial movie, or really doing much with the issue of racism in the LAPD, criminals playing the race card, public crying for blood ignoring the fact the criminal who was beaten was someone committing a crime,  or that officers are putting their lives on the line each day they come to work so should maybe be the ones determining what is appropriate when someone is arrested based on the circumstances.  But Rampart doesn't go there, in fact we never find out much about this investigation, we certainly don't find out if David is charged, found innocent or guilt, loses his job, does time or whatever.  We never find out if it was just a guy high,drunk or whatever who didn't initentionally crash into the officer, or was it a set up for a cash payment from the courts, or just to push a political agenda or what?

Most of the film is just us evesdropping on wherever David goes.  Sometimes that's to a house that his kid lives at, where his ex and  especially her new wife doesn't want him around.  Not sure if the older girl was also his daughter, but she does and doesn't want him around at times as well. Sometimes he just pops into the house of a woman he met at a bar who slept with him the first time and he just expects her to whenever he's there inside her house or in her pool when she gets home.  Sometimes it's to a cheap hotel room he lives in. Sometimes a dimly lit bar where he talks to an old ex cop who worked with his father.  Sometimes pulled up in his police car where he bullies a guy in a wheel chair who tries to blackmail him for cigarettes and alcohol.  None of these places he goes are interesting viewing.

Then the credits just start rolling, we don't find out what happened. You've sitting watching, bored waiting for a payoff, and it never comes.",1494806400,2,3149,4.523809523809524
