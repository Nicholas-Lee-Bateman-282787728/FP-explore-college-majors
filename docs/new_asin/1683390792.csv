7800760,5,1683390792,Very detailed instructions for 3 different ways to quilt the top pictured on the front of the DVD. Directions for making the top as well. I've always admired Judi Madsen's work thru Pinterest and I would love to learn ruler work at my own pace. This was just the ticket for me. I've watched all episodes and now making the top up. I may even practice on some muslin that I will draw the squares which represent the different blocks first.,1522627200,,438,4.419753086419753
