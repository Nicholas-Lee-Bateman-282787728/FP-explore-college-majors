Watch as her and her ghouls travel to new places, meet/make new ghoul friends; while, they search for the true Vampire queen! This is definitely a movie you want to have in your MH collection.",1395878400,,281,4.64
6160732,5,B00HF5J9XW,My daughter loved this movie. She can't wait for the weekend to get here so she can watch it a million times. LOL,1395878400,,113,3.9565217391304346
6160733,5,B00HF5J9XW,My daughter loves this series and she was so excited to get this movie. It came on the day as promised and was a great deal.,1395792000,,124,3.8076923076923075
6160734,5,B00HF5J9XW,My daughter has recently discovered Monster High. I actually love the concept. And my daughter understands the message of taking a stand for what you believe that clearly comes across in the movie.,1395792000,,197,5.0
6160735,3,B00HF5J9XW,"This movie had some good moments like the vampire who transferred from vampire prep in Fright On  TV Special that always putting Draculura down swallowing her pride when she thinks Draculara is the new queen, Hoodoo Voodoo behavior and when Cleo goes all drama team at the Horrorwood  studio I found myself lacking interest in this film over ones done in the past. The Ghouls spend most of the movie globe trotting for clues to the vampire heart picking up new friend along the way but never staying put in any one location long enough the make that part of monster world of interest to me.  The new characters have interesting personalities and hope to see them again in future works but over all the other Monster High specials were much more interesting and this made me wish Mattel would put Fright On and Escape from Skull Shores out on DVD.",1395792000,,846,4.589403973509934
6160736,5,B00HF5J9XW,"Really cute, my kids loved it, and to be honest I really enjoyed it as well. And I loved all the new characters that were introduced as well.",1395705600,10,141,4.071428571428571
6160737,5,B00HF5J9XW,"Where is the true Vampire Queen?  What secret is Robecca Steam hiding? Will Draculaura gain her vampire powers?  Who is Veronica Von Vamp?  All these questions will be answered in the new Monster High movie Frights, Camera, Action!  a movie filled with new friends, exciting mysteries and surprise destinations.

The vampires have been without a queen for 400 years and Draculaura is surprised to learn that she has been chosen by an ancient jewel, The Vampires Heart, to be the next Vampire Queen.  Draculaura, Robecca Steam, Cleo De Nile, Clawdeen Wolf (and stowaway Hoodude) head to the castle of the vampire court in Transylvania in the company of the evil Lord Stoker to attend Draculauras coronation.  Once the ghouls reach their destination, Draculaura uncovers Lord Stokers plot to use her as a puppet queen so he can continue his villainous rule in the absence of the true queen.  Determined to stop Lord Stoker and find the rightful queen, the Monster High gang search the castle until they find a mysterious letter that holds the first clue in their adventure.

From Transylvania the gang travel to Londoom and meet up with Clawdeens older sister Clawdia Wolf, who is there to study dramatic writing.  Clawdia soon joins the search and helps to find the next clue that will take them to New Gorleans.  While searching the ghost ship The Bijou on the Bayou in New Gorleans the gang meets Honey Swamp  who is onboard working on a student film.  Their next stop is Hauntlywood, and the gang continues their quest while being pursued by Lord Stokers minion Igor.  Hauntlywood is their final destination, and here the gang meets the makeup artist Viperine Gorgon who introduces them to the famous actress Veronica Von Vamp.  Veronica is the key to the mystery and has the final clues to help the Monster High ghouls solve the puzzle.

While Draculaura and the others are on their journeys, back at Monster High there is a raging debate over which male lead of the Vampire Majesty movies is cuter.  Is it Edweird of Alucord?  The matter can only be decided in Cute Court with Twyla as the judge presiding over the matter.

Like all Monster High stories, this movie is full of positive messages for the viewers.  There are themes of courage, selflessness, open mindedness and friendship throughout the story.  I believe this movie is appropriate for all ages.  Kids will love this movie; it is full of their favorite Monster High characters, including some of the minor players.  This is a movie made for kids, but will also be enjoyed by adult cartoon watchers.  (A couple of highlights are a few funny references to jazz hands and the movie director in Hauntlywood is named Scarentino who is looking to dig up an old star and resurrect their career.)  This movie runs 1 Hr. 14 Mins. and also includes three animated shorts  Crime Scream Investigation, Games Ghouls Play, and Monster Morphoseas.",1395619200,12,2900,4.831643002028398
6160738,5,B00HF5J9XW,"I ordered this movie for my daughter who is a huge fan of the monster high movies. Usually we just watch them on netflix, but she likes to have the DVDs so she can watch them in her bedroom.

I have to say, this is one of my favorite monster high movies! It's got a very cute story line and just like the other ones, it encourages kids to do the right thing as well as teaches them the value of friendship. I love the play on words they use such as ""ghoul friends"" instead of girl friends. I also love the fact that the characters are all different monsters and I feel their style encourages young girls that it's okay to look different from what most consider ""normal"".

Our copy arrived on time and has no scratches or anything like that and it's exactly what I purchased. I'm very happy with this item and I can't wait to buy more!!",1471392000,,835,4.180124223602484

After a clever montage of several of the characters shown in iconic movie posters, the movie begins with Draculaura ruining a showing of Veronica Van Vamp's latest Vampire Majesty boovie for the rest of her classmates by continually erupting over its historical inaccuracies, inaccuracies she is quite certain about because she happened to have lived through the real events.  She also thinks the real events would have made a better movie, and she's got a point about that.  Traditionally vampires chose their leader by use of a magical artifact, the Vampire's Heart, which would glow in the presence of the next rightful queen.  But 400 years ago, amidst a growing schism between those who would maintain vampire rule over all other monsters and those of more democratic leanings, the throne opened up and the Vampire's Heart disappeared, the latter fact covered up by Prime Monister Lord Stoker, who has served as interim ruler ever since, after the democrats for the most part fled to the Boo (New) World, all the while supposedly looking for the rightful ruler.  Trouble is that Lord Stoker LIKES being in charge and has no intention in giving it up, at least until a trio of powerful vampbassadors, suspecting as much give him an ultimatum and one week to find the new vampire queen, ""or it's sunlight for you!""  A puppet master desperately in need of a new puppet, Lord Stoker decides to pick Draculaura, remembering her as a weak and nave, easily manipulated doormat, and fake it so she becomes queen.  Draculaura is thrilled at first, until she learns the truth, whereupon she decides that the right thing to do is to find the real Vampire's Heart and use it to find the real vampire queen.  What follows is a search for clues scattered across the Monster World, climaxing in Hauntlywood.  Gently Pushed Moral: Well it certainly isn't respect your scaritage though there's nothing wrong with that; rather it is that you should do the right thing, even if you're scared to.

In addition to the main plot there is a hilarious parody of the infamous Twilight Teams that has ghouls almost coming to blows over which of Veronica's two suitors in the boovie is the cuter, which is finally settled at a ""Cute Court"", presided over by Twyla, daughter of the Boogieman, who continues her role as a quiet voice of reason.  There is also a great parody character in boovie director Scareantino.

Note: The DVD also contains three surprisingly lame, exclusive (for now) ""webisodes"" like those watchable for free on the Monster High web site:

Crime Scream Investigation
Games Ghouls Play
Monster-Morphoseas

but surprisingly does NOT contain the ""Welcome to Hauntlywood"" mini-TV special, the 11th, watchable for free on the Monster High web site, that amounts to an alternate ending.

6160882,2,B00HF5J9XW,"This movie is poorly made. The excitement is you travel with the girls to help find the true Vampire Queen. What's sad is the adventure is not really an adventure for the viewers. You see them lined up gazing around,oooing and awe-ing as the background of blurred buildings & landscape passes behind them. Yes,let's skip as much detail as we can because who cares about any of that? They do this way too often in the movie. It's such a CHEAT! They go to all these places and you get to SEE very little to nothing! Even the flash back is just still pictures of a painting! Oh and the Real Queen is over the top! The voice is horrible and the movie didn't flow at all. None of the girls who watched with my daughter wanted to finish the movie or ever watch it again. I'm glad I just rented it.

1. Any chance of Escape from Skull Shores and Scaris: City of Frights being put on DVD?
2. Any chance of the mini-episodes being put on DVD? I've seen some from [...]. Great voice acting, beautiful animation, and better plots in a 2 and a half minutes (3 and a half mins. tops) than most 15 and 30 minute cartoons I see these days on TV.
