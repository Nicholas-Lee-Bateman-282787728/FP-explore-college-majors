1808346,5,B00007FGE5,"I did this with my first pregnancy and LOVED it.  The instructor did a great job and you can watch a whole class of women at various stages of pregnancy for modifiers.  I lost this set, but now on my second pregnancy, can't bring myself to buy a different DVD.  Will order this one again.",1182729600,,288,4.2
1808347,1,B00007FGE5,No way for me.  I didn't like the chanting at all.  I got a creepy feeling.  Way too new-agey for me.  Very low quality video too.  Absolutely do not recommend....unless you are into chanting while you do yoga.,1177372800,,210,4.421052631578948
1808348,2,B00007FGE5,If you are a very spiritual or new age yoga person you might love this. I am just a modern mommy looking for a yoga workout. The instructors endless banter about being in touch with my primal nature was annoying. Telling me to visualize squatting a in a forest and birthing surrounded by only birds and animals is a terrifying image not a relaxing one. The chanting was bizzare and the tribal dancing downright scary. I was hoping for just some great yoga poses with instruction but I got a video drowning in over the top touchy-feely spiritual junk.,1152057600,8,550,4.565656565656566
1808349,5,B00007FGE5,"I absolutely love the prenatal part. I did not exercise regularly before, but I became addicted to this CD when I got pregnant. It helped me feel great during my whole pregnancy, avoid stretch marks, back and leg pains, have a NATURAL birth of a 10-pound healthy baby and not only lose all the baby weight in three weeks but look even better than ever before. THANK YOU, Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa!!!",1151971200,,393,4.549295774647887
1808350,5,B00007FGE5,"I love this video.  I am expecting my 4th baby and have used this video for the last 3 pregnancies.  I started this yoga during my 2nd pregnancy to avoid the back pain I had during my first.  Not only did the exercises keep me pain free, but a few weeks into it I found myself getting tone and finding muscles showing all down my back!  The instructor is kind of out there, but very calming at the same time.  I love how there is plenty of stretching too.  She talks you through the exercises explaining how they will help in your pregnancy and during childbirth and so you hardly realize you are ""exercising"", until a few weeks later you notice how tone you are getting.  FYI - I always skip the meditation and the freestyle dancing - I'm not that alternative!  I just enjoy the relaxing exercises, so if you are the same, just skip the parts that are too ""out there"" for you and you will find a great prenatal yoga practice.",1148601600,4,926,4.281609195402299
1808351,1,B00007FGE5,"I bought this DVD to stay fit during my pregnancy. I'm a pretty open-minded person, but I still found that the instructor seemed kind of ""out there"". I tried it a couple of times on different days, and I never got through the beginning of the video. I never even watched the second DVD on post-natal because the first was so awful. I definitely would recommend you buy something else. Don't waste your time or $$$.",1110326400,3,414,4.4605263157894735
7975718,5,B00007FGE5,"Very happy with item. It was as described.  Great price, great quality. Thank you for your business.  And prompt delivery.",1491523200,,122,5.05
7975719,5,B00007FGE5,"I got this DVD when I was pregnant with my son and just looking for some easy yoga for pregnant women, and shortly after my back went out. These stretches helped me more than physical therapy. I do it every day, and it's helped me work threw my back pain and feel better in general threw my last two pregnancies. My daughter loves it, she sits down and does ""Princess Yoga"" with me because Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa is wearing a white lace dress and a turban, and she thinks she is a princess in a fancy castle. (She's 5) I would recommend it highly, even if you are not into the new age ideas the instructor has, the stretching techniques are worth sitting threw it.",1465689600,,661,4.296
7975720,5,B00007FGE5,"I follow the prenatal video every evening. The instructor is calm, supportive, and experienced. I was extremely stressed out and nervous, and I have significantly calmed down since beginning this routine. I think this is a beautiful practice for any woman who is expecting a baby.",1314230400,3,280,5.108695652173913
7975721,5,B00007FGE5,"I highly recommend this DVD!  I think it is a very balanced workout for both the pre & post natal segments.  It's easy to follow, the exercises are just enough for some aerobic benefits, and the stretching refreshing.",1301875200,,217,4.684210526315789
7975722,5,B00007FGE5,"This yoga routine has been perfect for relieving my back tension, neck stiffness, and restless legs, while helping build muscle tone and the knowledge and comfort a woman needs before going into labor.  It is not a purely physical ""workout"" - instead it is focused on both physical and mental development, with some unique meditative approaches to building endurance in preparation for labor.  I love it!  The instructor, Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa, is very knowledgeable with a soothing voice.  I can't say enough good things about this routine!  There is also a more recent DVD out, also by Gurmukh that is just as great (Prenatal Kundalini Yoga and meditation for mothers to be).  I recommend them both!  Happy Yoga!",1234051200,2,712,4.983050847457627
7975723,1,B00007FGE5,"It's this whole weird new-aggie thing. The instructor wears a turban. I'm normally quite open to new age concepts but for yoga I'd rather have something a bit more yoga and less ""dancing around in the forest pretending you're living back in the primitive age some 1,000s of years ago"". I don't really feel like I'm getting a real yoga work out session at all. Now pregnant with my second child and am looking to buy a different yoga DVD.",1226102400,,437,4.475
7975724,1,B00007FGE5,"I have health conditions which make it hard to exercise fully during my pregnancy.  I thought a prenatal yoga would be a good way to do some safe stretching and be a little less active than full out aerobic exercise.  It had all this chanting and talk of birthing your baby in a rain forest like women hundreds of years ago, and then it seemed to mix yoga with lots of repetitions so it was more like a fast paced yoga aerobic workout.  This would be great for those who like new age aerobic exercise yoga.",1212451200,,506,4.25
7975725,1,B00007FGE5,"I was looking for a good exercise video for my wife on DVD, now that our tape player finally died.  I picked this up, and we decided to do the first set together with our daughter, and mom is 4 months along with the new one.  that was a huge mistake, this woman who does this i swear is an alien.  She was so bizarre, and her viewpoint and philosophies on pregnancy was clearly new age california.  No thanks, this was not a good workout video, unless you are into new age religion or cults.",1206921600,,491,4.136842105263158
7975726,4,B00007FGE5,This is not really a 'work out' it defentaly does get your pules up some but it is more about getting in touch with your inner self and that primal part of you that comes out when birthing a baby. The positive birth talk throughout the video is wonderful and positions used are excellent for preparing for a natural birth. This is not the sort of birth preperation you want if you are planing a standered hospital birth. For anyone wanting a healthy natural birth I would strongly suggest looking into this video!,1202601600,,513,4.526881720430108
7975727,5,B00007FGE5,"When I first watched the DVD, I giggled because of the chanting.  But after getting over the awkwardness of chanting out loud, I came to really depend on the chanting which was a great way to relax and meditate.
The yoga strectches are great for beginners as well.  This DVD made all of my back pain go away and helped rejuvinate myself for the day.  The yoga exercises are great in strecthing your pelvis to get you ready for the BIG day to hopefully help you have an easier labor and birth.  This by far is the best DVD out there that not only helps you stretch, but help you relax and rejuvinate after a long stressful day at work.  A stressful mom makes a stressful baby.",1192060800,,675,4.283464566929134
