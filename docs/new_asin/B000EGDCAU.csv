8109313,3,B000EGDCAU,"I think all Americans know the gist of Columbus' voyages.  However, if you haven't been in an American history class in years, this will provide important info.  For example, I didn't know the Portuguese monarchy regretted not funding Columbus' voyage.  One of Columbus' navigators returned to Spain before him, but that guy died.  According to this work, Columbus predicted that he was close to Eden, rather than being close to South America.  Further, he did not die a celebrated man.  At one point, the Spaniards put him in change.

Unfortunately, this work revealed how oppression and racism were engendered from the jump when these Europeans met non-Europeans.  It was instantly assumed that indigenous peoples were inferior and must be converted to Christianity.  Though the work says Queen Isabella deemed the indigenous her subjects, rather than slaves, if you force people to work, beat them, and don't pay them, then guess what they are!  No one can say Columbus never dreamed of all the genocide and slavery to come:  this work shows that he had his hands in it too.

This work does have cheesy reenactments.  However, it is difficult to recreate 1400s Europe.  Things are mitigated because so many paintings and drawings across the centuries were shown.  One sees several portrayals of Columbus.  More importantly, you see different images of the indigenous.  Sometimes they wore leaves; sometimes they were nude.  Sometimes they are seen with long hair; sometimes with mohawks or similar styles.  I think one can give a feminist reading to Columbus too.  As many say famous men couldn't become famous if their mothers hadn't given birth to them, without Queen Isabella's support, none of Columbus' achievements would have happened.",1200528000,,1744,5.1387900355871885
