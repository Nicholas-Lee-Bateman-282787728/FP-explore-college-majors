8032009,5,B0002UB2XM,"At first what attracted me to this film was its cool title   Kamikaze Taxi. While I expected an action-packed Yakuza movie, what I got was much, much more.

Corrupt politicians, dispossessed ethnic citizens, young Yakuza wannabees, action, killings, street life in modern Japan, reconciliation with Japans involvement in WWII. There are many elements thrown together in this movie, and it does a good job dealing with them in a coherent story that will keep your interest for the length of the movie.

On the surface it is a story of a young Yakuza, Tatsuo, exacting revenge against a corrupt politician for beating up his girlfriend/prostitute who is later killed by a Yakuza shylock.  Tatsuo and his other neophyte Yakuza buddies blunder into stealing a great deal of money from a crime boss. With the assistance of an ethnic Japanese taxi cab driver born in Peru, Tatsuo flees and attempts to avenge the killing of his girlfriend.

Social issues relevant to Japan at the time Kamikaze Taxi abound. In the early 1990s, Japan was rocked with corruption in high office, both in the mainland and abroad. In Peru an ethnic Japanese politician, Alberto Fugimori, was President, and he was plagued throughout his term and ultimately ousted by charges of corruption. These two events are alluded to in the movie.

The politician in this movie, Domon, is a survivor from WWII, a former Kamikaze fighter. Not only is he prejudiced, but he is also morally depraved, sadistic, and virulently chauvinistic. That prejudice is aimed as well to the taxi cab driver, who while ethnically Japanese, is looked upon as a second-class citizen. While practically unknown outside of the country, the issue of migrant Japanese citizens is a burning issue in Japan.

Director Masato Harada (who played the character of Omura, the pro-West advisor to the Emperor of Japan in The Last Samurai) ties all these elements very well, which gel together quite nicely through most of the movie.

The movie jumps the shark a bit when Tatsuo and the taxi cab driver stumble into an encounter group session in a foothill retreat.

This is a minor defect. Harado finds a way to tie in this encounter group into the story line. Besides, this is not your average Yakuza film with disposable, one-dimensional characters. The actors play complex characters with depth in a well-written, thoughtful, sometimes contemplative, script.

This movie has the force of a Miike Yakuza movie, and displays flashes of craft and subtle humor enough to justify repeated viewings. Even at over two and a half hours you will not be dissatisfied.",1490140800,,2591,4.9883990719257545

 Like a few reviewers of this movie, what attracted me to this film was its cool title, Kamikaze Taxi. While I expected an action-packed Yakuza movie, what I got was much, much more.

Corrupt politicians, dispossessed ethnic citizens, young Yakuza wannabees, action, killings, street life in modern Japan.

In Peru an ethnic Japanese politician, Alberto Fugimori, was President, and he was plagued throughout his term and ultimately ousted by charges of corruption. There is the issue of ethnic Japanese from Peru facing discrimination when they relocate in Japan.  These three social and political issues dominate this movie.

8032012,1,B0002UB2XM,"So, I saw the film, ""Kamikaze Taxi"", about 15 years ago on TV. It was an amazing film. One of the best action flicks I've ever seen.

Ever since then, I had been on the lookout for a DVD version of it. It was not available in any of the locations that I had lived in but, 1 month ago, thanks to the power of the internet, I found it. Great yeah? Ummm, not really.

I had previously read some bad reviews about Tokyo Shock, the company that oversaw the DVD release of this film, in these very Amazon pages, but I didn't really take notice of them until after I bought this item.

First off, the DVD may play well on a normal DVD player (I don't know - I never tried) but on a computer with a software DVD player (which is how I watch all of my DVD's), there is a problem. The video frame does not expand to full size. You can switch your DVD player (eg. Windows Media Player) to full-screen mode but, still, the actual video frame sits in the middle of your computer screen with huge black borders on all of its sides. It does not expand.

Secondly, the quality of the film image is extremely poor. It looks as if they had transferred the film from VHS. ""Kamikaze Taxi"" was made in 1995 but I have seen DVD releases of films made 20 or more years earlier than that that had better image quality (eg. ""Spartacus"", ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", etc). Inexcusable. The people who managed the transfer of the film to DVD just did not do their job well.

It's a shame because this DVD release does not do the film justice.

To sum everything up, ""Kamikaze Taxi"" is a good film, but this DVD product is pretty bad.",1393977600,,1612,4.167202572347267
8032013,5,B0002UB2XM,"I am not Japanese but I definitely do enjoy many of their movies.  I cannot give you an esoteric explanation of the whys and wherefores I can only say whether I enjoy watching a film or not.  I wasn't sure what this movie would turn out to be but the synopsis was enough to interest me in viewing the movie.

This movie was not what I expected in any way whatsoever.  This I can state emphatically.  I was entertained during the entire length of the film.  I was totally involved in the lives of the major characters.  I learned something about Japan's attitudes just prior to the WAR and especially after the war.  Racism is not confined to America.  Imagine that! I will not go into the plot. I will just say that if you want to be entertained for 2 hours by a type of  film you probably have not seen before then this is the film for you.  I totally enjoyed this movie.",1358985600,,872,4.224242424242425
8032014,1,B0002UB2XM,This movie is only in Japanese with subtitles. Not in English and Japanese as described. Also it only fits maybe 2/3 of my TV screen. You have to zoom to get a full picture then you miss the subtitles. This company does this with a lot of their releases. Tokyo Shock.,1341964800,,267,4.254901960784314
8032015,3,B0002UB2XM,"Notice that the movie is 169 minutes long which is excellent for grand historical epics or complex character developed relationships. Now, this flick is basically about 2 guys on the run from mobsters which story could be typically developed and paced say at around 100 minutes. I agree that the added historical/cultural aspect was interesting, but this movie needed a serious chop job and a more believable co-lead to complement the charismatic Koji Yakusho. Decently exciting Yakuza genre, but be prepared for considerable WTF filler.",1341878400,,537,5.329411764705882
8032016,5,B0002UB2XM,"I highly recommend Kamikaze Taxi. It is the tale of a lowly yakuza named Tatsuo who finds girls for a corrupt, evil senator named Domon. After Tatsuo's own girlfriend is brutally murdered at the hands of Domon's goons he vows revenge on Domon. He starts by enlisting his buddies to steal 2 million dollars from a hiding place in Domon's bedroom.  Only Tatsuo emerges alive from this heist. He then goes on the run from the yakuza and meets a taxi driver named Kantake who Tatsuo is willing to pay big money to have drive him around Japan while he seeks his Kamikaze revenge. We learn that Kantake was born in Japan but like many Japanese his family immigrated to South America after World War 2 when he was a young child, in his case they went to Peru, unlike most Japanese immigrants who went to Brazil.  He has returned to Japan to discover his roots but is discriminated against by the Japanese as not being Japanese enough. So the only job available to him is as a taxi driver. Tatsuo and the taxi driver Kantake begin to form a strong bond as they take the road trip around Japan with Tatsuo seeking revenge on Domon and his goons and Kantake eventually helping him in this quest. What makes this movie interesting is not just the crime/revenge element of the film but also how it ties in the Kamikaze pilots of World War 2, the prejudice within Japan to those who are not Japanese enough and the touchy subject of comfort women used by the Japanese during World War 2. It's an interesting look into the subject of discrimination within Japan that is not often discussed in movies and that is not well known to the world outside of Japan. In the end Kantake ends up teaching Tatsuo some interesting life lessons as a kind of father figure. This movie has it's share of violence but it has some moral lessons to teach along the way as it casts a critical eye towards Japanese prejudice both to foreigners working in Japan and to native Japanese people who have returned to the country. I give it 5 stars despite it's being produced in 1995. The price is certainly extremely reasonable for this DVD so that makes it easy on the wallet to take a peek at it.",1341014400,5,2159,4.44949494949495
