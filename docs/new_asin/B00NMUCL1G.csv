6673026,4,B00NMUCL1G,"Beautifully written, directed and acted movie about a rich Los Angeles housewife going insane and blaming it on environmental toxins (sort of like the nuts nowadays who think their Teflon pans and plastic wrap are trying to kill them). Having found no doctor who can help her, Carol takes refuge in a creepy new-age cult in the desert - but instead of getting better she gets much worse.

The story itself is pretty lame, but the extremely subtle and intelligent dialog, the absolutely perfect direction, editing and photography, and Julianne Moore's tight, brutal performance make it fascinating. I can understand why it won some obscure award as the best movie made during the 1990s, but it doesn't seem dated at all. I could easily believe it was released last year, and the fact that Moore has hardly aged at all in 20 years would back me up.",1423785600,3,846,4.755102040816326

6673028,5,B00NMUCL1G,"This is hilarious I just wrote a review about Criterion redoing this film from the 2001 crappy transfer. And it's coming out next week. The timing on my feelings is absolutely on about this release. It's amazing. I can't wait for the HD version from the original 35 MM print. This to me is the first official Julianne Moore film.

Since I haven't been helping people. Let me just say the 2014 version looks beautifully gorgeous. And has bonus materials. The commentary is interesting but the director is...is ... well Julianne is there and she's great on that interesting stuff.",1417132800,8,578,4.78
6673029,3,B00NMUCL1G,"""Safe,"" for me, was a bit of a revelation in 1995. It was a film I wanted to like; I managed that fete only somewhat in that time and place. In some ways, it captures the mood of the 90s perfectly. Moore is spectacular as usual, and the moment when the 'world' and all its contaminants attack her as she is driving is quite inspired. At those points, it compares favorably to, say, Nicholas Ray's ""Bigger Than Life,"" with James Mason, which is hardly light praise, but, while ""Bigger Than Life,"" hums along, with its central character's interior life giddily ruining the lives of those around him in his delusions, as Carol White's world implodes, the whole is a tad too humorless (the point, I suppose; this is a drama with some satire) and trying to enjoy when compared with less coy indy work. It is too vividly a critique of the increased sensitivity gripping the world today, wherein a dirty tissue can rise to a Chernobyl-cloud threat level. The scenes at the commune pose interesting food for thought. The satire is subtle. Ultimately, while it has a kind of spare, indy melodrama, it lacks the power of Haynes's ""Far From Heaven,"" a re-visioning of the work of 50s emigre master Douglas Sirk.",1415059200,8,1200,4.63849765258216
6673030,5,B00NMUCL1G,"This hugely impressed me when I saw it in the late early 2000's.  I can actually recall seeing the ad in my local newspaper during the initial theatrical run at a time when there was an explosion of independent movies across American cinemas, but unlike other movies that updated familiar generic territories, the marketing provided little detail as to just what  SAFE was.

Indeed, even after it captures a viewer's rapt interest for a solid two hours, it still leaves more unresolved than many can bear.  That is its magnificence--all of which shines through the prism of Julianne Moore's breakthrough performance.

The Village Voice named it the best film if the 90's at the close of the decade and if anything SAFE proved both socially and stylistically prophetic.  It's both compassionate and remote, satisfying and maddening, timely and timeless.  It is, to this day, Todd Haynes' best movie.

But that didn't tell you a thing about it! Just pre-order!",1411862400,27,958,4.981132075471698

6673033,4,B00NMUCL1G,"I like the psychodynamics of this script and film.
Well acted.  But probably not for all as it's different.

6673035,1,B00NMUCL1G,"Tedious, dull and non-important, it seems this is a paean to the modern culture that inspired it.  A boring woman living in rich suburban Los Angeles (Julianne Moore) suffers from mental issues, that's it.  Invented or not, we don't intend to care since she exhibits no human motivational warmth at all.  Nothing is resolved in the end either.

Nothing except that this is a bloated work of tedium.",1435017600,3,398,4.8088235294117645
6673036,5,B00NMUCL1G,"I'll play the Devil's Advocate and say that this movie is less about the environment and AIDS fears and more about the social and spiritual sickness caused by materialism, if you define the concept of materialism as finding happiness in things and possessions. I think Moore's physical deterioration is a metaphor for her growing awareness of her own inner ugliness and weakness. You might say her illness is just as much of a metaphor as Gregor Samsa's metamorphosis is.

The first half of the movie reminded me of Antonioni's L'Avventura with its wide and static angles, along with individuals framed off to the side and often overwhelmed by surrounding architecture.

The second half of the movie was more difficult to understand. I think Moore's decision to leave her old life and start new is a healthy impulse and maybe the only hopeful part of the movie. Her journey towards self-hood, however, clearly leads into a wrong direction. Haynes and his actors did a great job with the self-help guru Peter and his desert retreat. It would have been too easy to turn this part of the movie into a cult abduction story with the typical brainwashing and sex abuse we've seen elsewhere. Peter and everyone at his desert retreat seem warm and inviting, but they project a sense of menace that you can't always explain.

Director Haynes seems to be saying that Moore's character is deep enough to see the emptiness of her life, but that over-long exposure to the spiritual toxicity of materialistic culture has weakened her so much she can't do anything about it.

All in all, a very spooky film--not a horror movie, but it definitely has the effect of one. Haynes uses understatement and minimalism to make his points; Kafka used over-the-top expressionism and verisimilitude to make his points. Nonetheless, this movie continues to remind me of Kafka's little novel so much that I'll probably re-read it and then watch this movie right after. Just sayin'...",1434844800,16,1955,4.915151515151515
6673037,4,B00NMUCL1G,"A woman without an identity gets sucked into a new age cult via an indeterminate illness(of both body and mind). She is not comfortable with the life she lives, living in the cavernous home of her partner and step-child, surrounded by material things. She barely exists in an LA environment,shown on the edge of the film frame or from a distance, marginalized. Her voice is very quite and monotonous, with no emphasis,coming from her head-above-the-neck rather than from her body. She seems to seek reassurance, her vocal utterances seem to be questions. Her partner seems at a loss as to what is wrong, taking her to see her GP, who knowing no better, sends her to a psychiatrist. He tells her he is there to find whats going on in you. She has been wandering at night outside her house unable to sleep .

She believes the cause is pollutants from the environment, its in the material of the sofa, her husbands cologne, the chemicals that are used on her at the hairdressers. She is a woman unanchored, she has no relationships that define her identity, she doesnt work, she barely relates to her step-son, she hyperventilates at a gathering of her female friends. There is a telling scene with a female friend where the friend circumvents describing her sons illness (HIV),they speak in gestures. Todd Hayness film satirises the culture of positivity that grew up in the AIDS crisis at the end of the 80s and early 90s. That you make yourself ill, only you can make yourself better. You have to love yourself. She does this by seeking a cure in the New Mexican desert with a commune of people(Wrenwood) under a guru figure(Peter) who says he no longer reads the papers or watches the TV. As in a cult, reality or information is cut out as just another pollutant. We have a feint suggestion of the atmosphere of the alienation of The Man Who Fell To Earth. She drags her oxygen bottle with her everywhere,clamping a mask to her face. As the film goes on she uses the techniques of looking at herself in a mirror,shown at night with her eyes only and the barest of outlines of her face in the darkness in her igloo. She is the alien. She whispers to her reflection  I love you, in the mantra of the self-help group. Get the Criterion version for the extras, a booklet explaining the film, an interview between Todd Haynes and Julianne Moore(showing how attuned with one intention the two were), an interview with Hayness producer, Christine Vaccon, another short early Hayness film Suicide. Moore plays the role as if she is seeking invisibility. Not easy. Great cinematography and framing of every scene.

Her homes are destined to keep the world out- safe havens, prisons of the self. Hayness protagonist is a blank slate, a vessel for meaning. Carol takes shape through the symptoms of the inexplicable ailment. Is this female hysteria? This existential horror movie in which the monster is all around us and nowhere to be seen. Her illusory promised land is the desert, where Wrenwood affirms and validates her sickness. Immune sickness gives Carol an identity and yet she cannot explain it. A cure makes her worse: in her igloo an increasingly prominent red blotch is on her head. A tragedy full of anger and compassion. This queer cinema rejects happy endings.",1431475200,3,3266,4.726315789473684
6673038,5,B00NMUCL1G,"I have loved this movie since it first came out, and I was so pleased to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price. I believe Ms Moore would have won an Oscar, if anyone had actually seen it. The topic, fear of our environment, is even more relevant today. Twenty years ago (when ""Safe"" was released) the big fear was AIDS. Now it is GMO crops and gluten. I guess there is always something to fear, real or not.",1430870400,11,409,4.125

8679215,5,B00NMUCL1G,"It is very brave of him to make such a movie as his second feature. This is very heavy stuff to make into a film and he didn't make it like a documentary or tried to inform us like an educational program doing the best that he can.
It is about this woman Julianne Moore who suddenly became ill and couldn't find out why. She begin to think that it was because of the enviornment. All the toxic thing around her, the chamicals, the air pollutions and all. It's just that all the other people just didn't felt it right away. Everyone acually suffered as well.
She is just one of the guy who happens to react more. That's all.
She first did everything she could but failed. Then she found out this deserted place that similer people gathered and try to cure themselves by not exposing them to any kind of possible toxic things at all.
She slowly becomes better.
The good thing is although her husbad from time to time blamed her for being sick but he did understood her and supported her.
She will eventually become better I guess. But the next step will be the problem. Going back to the city again.
We are so fool that we created all kinds of toxic things ourselves and live in it. We don't even know that they are harming us to death.
We just get used to them so well that we even enjoy them. We smoke weeds, cigarettes, even plastic glues for fun.
But slowly they are destroying our inner body.
One day they will collapse our entire being.
This movie is a silent warning and it is a powerful one.
But it also has a story, a good one and I enjoyed Julianne Moore's good acting very much.",1460592000,2,1587,4.258278145695364

8679217,5,B00NMUCL1G,"This is mostly a technical review.
I have loved this film since discovering Haynes in the early 2000s.  Though I never really thought of the quality of the DVD release as ""holding it back"", I never had a chance to see it in theaters, either.  I wasn't hopeful there would be an  HD release with a niche film like this.  That was until Criterion came to the rescue!
The image quality is, in my opinion, everything that can be hoped for.  Every parameter of quality improved - the resolution of course, but also the S/N ratio, colors, and grading.  Improved to the point of being absolutely breathtaking.  It's like seeing it again for the first time.  Those wacky, gaudily-colored late 80s interiors sometimes made the DVD release feel somewhat incohesive, but in this transfer the colorist(s) manages to both heighten the realism and add a certain sparkle not felt in the DVD. I'm really impressed.
As for the audio...again, the S/N ratio and resolution has gone way up. But I have to say I almost subtracted a star because it's a shame Criterion didn't spring for a stereo remix.  Tomney's haunting score, which I own on CD, was definitely in stereo and it would have added to the atmosphere to have that.  In fact I played the opening drive sequence on my plasma TV with my audio system running  the stereo OST Track 1 and thought...wow...if only.  It would have been nice.  The score has a lot of subtleties that you just can't pick up on a mono mix.  But I'm not going to subtract a star for that, because I feel so lucky we got an excellent blu-ray release as we did.",1449619200,3,1572,4.508833922261484

8679219,4,B00NMUCL1G,"Safe is a great film for those who enjoy character studies and have an interest in psychology and/or social issues. The style of film is observational, we focus on the lead and witness her struggle against her environment. Whether the environment is natural, artificial, or social is open to question. The film feels, overall, very much open with nuanced performances. It requires some amount of speculative reading into things on the part of the viewer, though I find that interesting. Safe is a slow, but engaging, film with a powerful ending.",1444262400,,545,5.0
