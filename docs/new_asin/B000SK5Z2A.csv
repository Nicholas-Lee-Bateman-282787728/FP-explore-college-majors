2886209,2,B000SK5Z2A,"How this story of freeing a deadly criminal from prison to act as a stand-in for an at large criminal (Bobby Z) to bring revenge and closure to corruption on every level of the playing field can continue to be reproduced ad infinitum will remain a puzzle.  This tired, poorly acted, hyper kinetic desert film wastes the talent of some good actors, gives plenty of killings to watch, and then introduces counterfeit kindness as a reason for making the film, is a movie to avoid.

Paul Walker is the released Bobby Z look-alike who will be freed from his life in prison by Laurence Fishburne's cop image if he merely shows up in Mexico as bait for drug lord Joaquin de Almeida's hostage demands for Fishburne's partner.  Of course it all goes wrong at the exchange point, allowing the fake Bobby Z to find a female interest (Olivia Wilde) as well as a little boy (J.R. Villarreal) who is supposedly the son of the real Bobby Z (and therefore is taken in by the fake Bobby Z), and the rest is just a messy chase sequence and series of killings and kidnappings.  The bad guys outnumber the good guys, and, well the rest is yesterday's sandwich. Not recommended even if there is nothing else on the shelves to rent!

2886266,2,B000SK5Z2A,"The Death and Life of Bobby Z, 2007 film

There is a convict in a California prison who looks like a drug dealer who died in a foreign country. (Some Asian countries execute drug dealers.) A policeman wants Kearney to impersonate Bobby Z in an operation that will release a hostage in Mexico. Then Kearney will be free to survive as best he can. [An offer that sounds too good to be true?] The Brotherhood in prison are out to kill Kearney, so his answer is yes. [So how did he get into trouble?] This exchange is made at night. Will something go wrong? There is a shooting while a train runs between the shooters. Kearney assumes his new identity in his new home. Immigrants are brought in to exploit their labor (sweatshops or a massage parlor).

Bobby meets his old girlfriend, Elizabeth. Will he be betrayed? [Would she notice a difference?] Bobby is warned and escapes on a horse. There is a chase (for action). [A helmet disguises a stunt double.] Where did he go? asks a man. A light airplane flies over and drops bombs! Four men chase and shoot at them. Mr. Johnson has to answer for the loss. Elizabeth is threatened. One man is dragged behind a truck as punishment, then his body is dumped. Cruz calls a man to look for Bobby Z. Bobby calls an old friend for a passport and money. A booby trap gets the wrong man. Bobby gets new wheels. Cruz calls Elizabeth and tells her what to do. Bobby Z goes to a meeting.

Elizabeth is there (she knows the truth), she talks to Mark. But Don Otero is there. There is conflict and a confession, then fighting and shooting! Kearney survives. Cruz goes to a motel to meet Bobby Z! This is a surprise! Kearney is followed by men with rifles. Bikers catch him! Cruz and Bobby Z arrive. Shoot him! Shooting eliminates the conflict. Sirens announce the arrival of the police. Can Kearney get away with the money, the girl, and the young boy? Only in a Hollywood movie.

This story seems too complex and implausible for me. Your opinion may vary, but do you really think this is the best story possible? This story tells about events that most people will never experience in their daily lives, and are happy for that. Could one DEA officer have that much power and lack of oversight?",1430006400,,2225,4.45945945945946

2886279,4,B000SK5Z2A,"The Death and Life of Bobby Z, or Bobby Z as it was often known, was little more then a retooled Fast and Furious without all the driving.  A corrupt federal agent (Lawrence Fishburne) sees a way to scan untold millions of dollars from a drug kingpin's fortuneby sitting a near doppleganger of said kingpin, Bobby Z, who had the misfortune of dying of a heart attack.  The double, a three strikes convict (Paul Walker) is sent into Mexico via a hostage trade.  Luckily for the ""new"" Bobby, he stumbles just as shots ring out meant for him.

The movie is action packed with lots of explosions, gunshots and airborne dropped granades.  The acting is above par but nowhere so good that it will be making converts of fans should they already not like the cast.

Bobby Z is the perfect example of a movie you can watch and immediately forget about it.  It's a guilty pleasure with no strings attached.",1420156800,,896,4.527950310559007

2886319,4,B000SK5Z2A,"- The dialogues are hilarious. They made me laugh many times.

For example, the cop said: ""Do you know why you are here, convict?""

Convict: ""Maybe because you want me to roll over somebody.""

Cop: ""No, I want you to be somebody.""

Convict: ""That's what my mom used to say.""

- The acting of Paul Walker, Olivia Wilde, Laurence Fishburne and J.R. Villarrea are engaging.

- The action scenes are both exciting and funny. For instance the scene where Paul yanked the gun off the hand of the biker assassin and scared him.

- There are a couple of thrilling twists that I did not foresee.

- Surprisingly, it also has some touching, emotional scenes relating to the kid named Kit. In this regard, Paul and J.R.'s acting do deliver.

- Of course it has gigantic logical holes but I don't care because it's an action comedy.

In short, it deservers 4 stars.",1396828800,,853,4.516339869281046

Some of his roles were better than others. I still love Joyride as much as the first day I saw it in the theater, as well as Into the Blue....Bobby Z on the other hand feels like he did it just for the paycheck on down time, in between Fast and Furious sequels and he didn't look like he put in much effort or even cared..

The story stopped being believable when they presented the picture of the guy he was doubling as..I mean, c'mon, no one thought of Paul taking photos as the guy he needed to double as?It would have made it more believable, 'cause it would have made it more believable. The story itself was a bore, it's been done dozens of times before; loner rogue offered deal for early release if he poses as a drug dealer and does the fed's dirty work, only problem is, the feds are dirty too (aren't they always)... and even Paul looking as hot as he is couldn't rescue this mess.. It looks like Cinemax afterhours stuff.. without the sex..  and that kid who played the son was a horrible actor too... Good afternoon movie to watch if there's nothing else, but don't expect too much. Also, despite looking like an action film, it really isn't. It's just mediocre hodgepodge.

It's a good thing this wasn't Paul's last film.. Rest in peace, Paul, you will be missed.",1385942400,,1420,4.412213740458015

It certainly is not as glossy as Savages but it isn't a bad movie.  I enjoyed it enough to stay on my spinner (bike) for 35 miles.  I would have finished the movie while riding the bike but lost my Netflix connection.

Not great but certainly better than many other action movies.  With better editing, it probably would have been a solid 4 star movie.  I guess it really deserves a three stars but I am bumping it up one to counteract the lower rating received from other reviewers",1371513600,,628,4.3247863247863245

2886362,4,B000SK5Z2A,"Isn't it funny, how the movies you really don't expect much out of, turn out to be the most fun. Bobby Z wasn't something that was high on my list of things to see, but it was streaming and fit my mood, so I watched it and what a surprise, a well written, Action film, with a pretty good plot! Bobby Z is a legendary local crime boss in Southern California. He is a very elusive man that the Mexican drug lords go to extreme measures to find. Don Huertero (Joaquim de Almeida) has kidnapped an FBI agent and will only exchange him for Bobby Z, but there's a problem, Bobby Z is dead. The clever folks at the FBI decide to find someone who looks like Z and send him in, that man is Tim Kearney (Paul Walker), and his life depends on how well he can trick people into believing that he is Bobby Z, a man he's never met. Paul Walker is the star of this clever film and he does a tremendous job. I'm not fan of Walker's, whenever he does anything that isn't a gritty Action film, he stinks, fortunately this is a gritty Action film and he was engaging, delightful, and even funny as he tried to play someone he's not. As for the rest of the cast, it was certainly a unique mix of people, but being centered around one man and one goal, really made it work. It's unusual to find a deep plot in an Action film and that's why this film was so unique. Aside from some terrific stunts and fight scenes, there were twists and turns, crosses and double-crosses, even some humor. Bobby Z was really a lot of fun to watch, and it will keep you guessing while at the same time showing you some terrific action sequences, I was more than impressed by this film and by Paul Walker for that matter. It's easy to say, well he's been playing an undercover agent in The Fast & Furious for a decade now, but it certainly wasn't the same thing. The Death & Life of Bobby Z is a wild ride, that's a lot of fun, and it will keep you guessing, you can't ask for more than that.",1369526400,5,1952,4.125984251968504

2886370,3,B000SK5Z2A,"This movie had the actors, had a plot, but the storyline was not developed enough.  The fight scenes were good, but the dialogue wasn't all that great.  It was ok, but it needed a little more.  It was pretty low budget as movies go.  It grabbed my attention because I was waiting for something more...but it really never came.  There was not a lot of suspense.  Almost everything was pretty laid out within the first 45 minutes(ish).  Rent or cheap buy.  I wouldn't go and spend full price.

POSSIBLE SPOILER:  One storyline that did grab my attention was Tim Kearney's love interest.  You really didn't know where she truly stood until the end.",1306972800,,645,4.619469026548672
2886371,2,B000SK5Z2A,"I'm a big fan of writer Don Winslow. I really enjoyed his book The Death and Life of Bobby Z. So I got a copy of this movies to see what the film version was like. The acting was wooden (even with a good actor like Lawrence Fishburne), but for the first half of the movie, it kept pretty much to the book. After it started deviating, the movie quickly went downhill.
My suggestion is get a copy of the book, and forget the movie.",1277769600,6,429,4.0588235294117645

2886373,2,B000SK5Z2A,"This low-budget film is a bit disappointing outside of the now famous actors who were in it. I always think that these guys can do better roles, however, the cameos of UFC figherts made me sit up in my seat a bit...they fit their roles almost wittingly.",1272931200,,253,4.404255319148936
2886374,4,B000SK5Z2A,"Tim Kearney is an incarcerated former Marine who is offered freedom by DEA agent Tad Gruzsa in exchange for impersonating recently-late drug lord Bobby Z. Things don't go as planned, however, and Kearney ends up on the run with Bobby Z's 12-year-old son. While it's no worse than much of the action movie junk that makes it to theatres, Bobby Z, originally entitled The Death and Life of Bobby Z, is a action thriller with Tim Kearney (Walker) as the hero. Filled with head scratching twists and cornball dialogue, this is not exactly a brilliant movie. Yet it's got a slick look and at least a few passably enjoyable action scenes. This movie is funny, entertaining and I enjoyed it.",1268092800,8,684,4.708333333333333
2886375,4,B000SK5Z2A,"I had never heard of this movie which has several titles throughout the world like THE DEATH AND LIFE OF BOBBY Z, and KILL BOBBY Z. The Blu-ray disc is in PANAVISION 2.35:1, and it is superb quality. The movie is also  action packed and very well acted and directed. Paul walker and Lawrence Fishburn were both very good in their roles. Not an academy award candidate, but surprisingly excellent entertainment.",1235001600,7,410,4.774647887323944

2886377,2,B000SK5Z2A,"First of all I didn't think that Paul Walker and Jason Lewis looked anything alike.  The similarities stop at the blond hair and blue eyes.  Second,  the movie overall didn't held my interest.  The fighting scenes were good but thats about it.  I'm not sure if it sticked to the story because I've never read the book but I plan on doing so.  The acting wasn't believable to me.  I couldn't take it seriously.",1220918400,,409,4.445945945945946
2886378,5,B000SK5Z2A,This movie deserves more respect as far as an action flick is concerned it is excelent. Now lets not compare it to the godfather or some other masterpiece. It is what it is a good entertaining action movie.,1215734400,11,206,4.447368421052632
2886379,3,B000SK5Z2A,"I actually enjoyed the movie. I will admit that I felt lost in the beginning but as the plot unfolded, things started to make more sense.  I believe the director intended for the viewer to discover the reason behind the chaos in real time, as the character did.  In other other words, I don't think it was supposed to make sense until the end.  Once the entire plot was revealed, the motivation behind the actions of the main characters became more clear.

Though not a blockbuster, the action was enjoyable and the some of the the scenery was absolutely beautiful. If you like ""colorful"" characters, off-beat humor, and a plot that is not ""spoon-fed"", you may want to give Bobby Z a spin.",1203465600,9,689,4.5772357723577235

2886382,4,B000SK5Z2A,"I started to watch this movie thinking it was going to be a good action-filled movie. Good actors, good story. What can be wrong with this?
Well, everything! It is probably one of the most boring movies that I have seen in years! The story sucked; it was very uninteresting, the actors were sleep-walking, the dialog was childish... the movie was a complete flop. Such a flop that I kept changing channels in my cable box.

I watched it again and it is a bit better now. I think I was too eager to see the real movie value. I give it 3-4 stars.",1194134400,,544,4.230769230769231

It is another drug movie/crooked agent/mistaken identity movie. The real bobby z and walker didn't look anything alike to me, and the fight scenes just didn't look realistic to me. Once again blockbuster online saved me some money on this movie. I still wasted two hours of my life though.",1190592000,4,551,4.63265306122449
2886384,5,B000SK5Z2A,"I enjoyed this movie alot.  I know some other reviewers didn't like it, but if you keep in mind this is a fairly low budget, direct to dvd movie (at least in North America), you'll find that you get drawn into the story and enjoy the ride. I know that personally I couldn't stop watching until the end.  The story involves Paul Walker playing a prisoner who is let out of jail to impersonate a drug dealer named Bobby Z.  If you're a Paul Walker fan (like I am), you'll really enjoy this.",1190073600,5,488,4.225806451612903
2886385,1,B000SK5Z2A,"Unfortunately what was one of the best books ever written, has now become one of the worst movies ever produced! Why! Why! Do they continue to put Paul Walker in these hard edgy roles, actually why do they put him in any roles fullstop?! He is without a doubt the worst actor that has ever entered Hollywood and because of it has completely added to the guaranteed demise of what could have been a fantastic film. Makes great coverage for the bottom of a birdcage but little else!
