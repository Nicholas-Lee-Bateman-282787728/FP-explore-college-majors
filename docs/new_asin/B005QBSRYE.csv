The filmmakers have obviously been influenced by the work of Terrence Malick and ardently strive for the sort of power he achieves through the use of images, sound and silence.  Unfortunately, the effort shows.  At one point, midway in, I found myself thinking about the Foley artist while watching one of the main characters lope down a road, his pants swishing crisply and his feet crunch-crunch-crunching on the amacite.  If your audience starts thinking about the guy in the studio re-creating those ambient sounds, then, on some level, your film has failed.

In terms of its story and the ideas it was trying to convey, it reminds me more of a work of literature than cinema.  The plot is extremely simple, a couple moves from the city to the rural countryside to escape some unspoken tragedy.  The man works as a day laborer with a local construction crew, leaving the woman alone every day, feeling bored and trapped.  There are three neighbors, an eccentric elderly woman, her melancholy blind daughter and a precocious tomboy, all of whom I felt were merely presented as symbols of various aspects of the couples predicament rather than human beings.  If that weren't enough, there are repeated metaphors for isolation and imprisonment  the blindness, a caged bird, a labyrinth  and the ominous portent of a coming solar eclipse.  Everything is heavy with meaning.  Almost comically so.

The performances are mostly flat and dispassionate, although I suspect that might be what the director was after.  However, veteran actor Rip Torn, in his one scene, mops up the floor with everyone else in the cast by delivering a powerful monologue that is strange, poignant and 100% believable.  Funny, I only really know him from the Men in Black films and an unfortunate incident in my state (Connecticut) where he drunkenly broke into a bank after hours and made some sort of scene, so it was wonderful to see the power of his acting in a serious performance, however brief.  The film couldve used more of him.

In many ways, I enjoyed this film.  It was a huge change from most modern cinema - quiet, slow and gorgeously photographed.  Comparable to Gus Van Sant's Gerry or the work of the aforementioned Terrence Malick, although not nearly as accomplished.  But as a story, it left me wanting more.",1428019200,,2350,4.883838383838384
