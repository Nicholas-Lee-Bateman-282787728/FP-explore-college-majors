8503921,5,B006T5IBZQ,"If you already have some of the belly dance moves under your belt, this is the dvd for somebody who is an absolute beginner for cymbals but definitely not for bellydancing. If you don't already know the moves, you may find it a little bit more on the challenging side. However I do own Virginia's dvd for beginners. So I had to go back and forth between the dvds. If I could see some of the moves with the feet on the screen, I probably would not have to go back and forth as much. I still give this dvd 5 stars because I like the way she broke down the patterns. I believe  I benefited a lot from this dvd in my earlier months of learning cymbals.",1405728000,2,648,4.0625
