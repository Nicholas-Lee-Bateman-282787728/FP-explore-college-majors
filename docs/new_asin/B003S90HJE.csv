8404106,4,B003S90HJE,"Great song selection, great backup band.
Been a fan of Larry for many many years
Probably his best CD yet",1393372800,,105,4.3
8404107,5,B003S90HJE,"Love this effort by Larry Carlton and his Sapphire Blues Band. I liked this dvd as good as ""The Paris Concert"".",1363305600,,111,4.333333333333333
8404108,3,B003S90HJE,"Nice concert from a skilled band, sound and vision are OK. This is not top class but enjoyable if you like jazzy blues.",1353715200,,119,4.217391304347826
8404109,5,B003S90HJE,"This is a particularly great display of why Larry Carlton became, and remains, a truly great guitarist. Even for him, Larry sounds at the top of his game. The rhythm section also rises to the occasion, led by the amazing drummer Moyes Lucas, Rick Jackson (keys), and Travis Carlton (Larry's son) on bass. A stellar horn section rounds out the band. A definite buy!",1350172800,,364,4.703125

8404111,5,B003S90HJE,"A combination of excellent musicians led by one of the best guitarists around.  Larry is awesome displaying his distinct style and love for the blues, yet it isn't just blues.",1324598400,,175,4.833333333333333
8404112,5,B003S90HJE,"This is by far, the best Carlton performance I' ve seen of his long and rich career. Relaxed, adventurous, creative, he is enjoying the show and having a great time. He takes his time, explores the songs from the inside, gives the impression that he can go wherever he wants to go in his fingerboard. He is free.
The band is solid but flexible, right on the feel and on time. If you like Carlton's work, do yourself a favor...",1322697600,,426,4.3375
8404113,5,B003S90HJE,"Larry with great ""4"" piece horn section.

Much, much different than the Larry Carlton/Steve lukather DVD, which is great.

Who doesn't love a good horn section: Mark Douthit/T sax; Doug Moffet/Baritone; Mike Haynes/trumpet; Barry Green Trombone

Keyboardist/Rick Jackson/phenomenal(same as Carlton/Lukather DVD), Moyes Lucas/drums/exceptional and none other than Travis Carlton/Bass/tight.

Songs:
Friday Night Shuffle
Night Sweats
Josie
Sapphire Blues
Minute by Minute
Just an excuse
7 for ya
Tenor Madness
Slightly Dirty
Deep into it
Room 335
sleepwalk
extras

This is great, but do NOT miss the new Larry and Tak DVD.  That thing is just way too much. Phenomenal.

No, I am not a Larry Carlton freak/affectionado/wierdo.  I just love great concert DVDs.",1312243200,7,756,5.628318584070796
