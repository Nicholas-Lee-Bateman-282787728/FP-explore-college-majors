It's electronic rock meets progressive guitarist.  Both musicians sing and it was done long distance. !0 songs and 10 Videos,  The music is better than the videos and can be had independently here on Amazon https://amzn.com/B00GSA7162",1475280000,,376,4.769230769230769
8629141,5,B00H1YMEMK,"It's so good to see independent artist that have some imagination and are not just trying to sound like eveyone else. Though half the music is instrumental it still gives you a foundation to create your own interpetations that fit with the concepts of the lyrical stories. Very well done videos and music!

Well worth a few bucks!",1387065600,,330,4.689655172413793
