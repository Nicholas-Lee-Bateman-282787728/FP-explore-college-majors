8229295,3,B000XS54LE,"First saw this movie in a theater with some friends back in the seventies. At the time it was new, with great color, and a decent sound track.

The video, however , seems to be printed from an old copy someone found in a closet.

It is still watchable, but the colors have faded somewhat,and there seems to be a few scenes missing.

I may have just gotten a bad copy, but I was not thrilled by this version.

They actors try to do a good job, but with less than great writing, and amateur acting.

If someone wishes to sample the style of the ""soft core"" epics of the time, there are still plenty

of undressed ladies, sword fights, chases through the woods, bad guys, heroes, and helpless damsels.

The bottom line is that it's cheap, and If you have a free afternoon, and do not expect Errol Flynn,

it's not too bad a way to waste an hour.",1350691200,,842,4.21875
8229296,2,B000XS54LE,The quality of the print was unbelievably BAD!  It should not have been sold!!!  I bought it as a quirk and paid for my quirkiness.,1274486400,5,131,4.2
