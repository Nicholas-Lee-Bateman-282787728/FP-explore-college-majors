8727225,5,B013C6OQWG,"Death Nurse II was originally released in 2013 (sent out in Nov 2012 for pre-ordered DVDs) for its 25th Anniversary.  The special feature ""Brownie Goes Shopping"" was filmed in Phoenix, AZ behind TallCat Studios.  Originally there was only one audio commentary (featuring Nick Millard, Irmi, & Jesus) but it was lost on a defective HDD.  A second commentary was created with Jesus and Jason Duron (of Severin Films) to replace it. After some searching, the original commentary was found on a HDV tape, which was sold to Slasher // Video by the Director.  Both commentaries are featured on the DVD release.",1451952000,,604,4.9504950495049505
8727226,4,B013C6OQWG,"More of the terrible, amateur stuff here!! In fact, this one is more of the ""shot on video"" (SOV) than you wished for. This is god-awful. But, if you know what you are purchasing, this is great. Kudos to Olive Films / Slasher Video to bringing us this trash. And, I say that with respect.",1451433600,,288,4.254545454545455
8727227,5,B013C6OQWG,"If you watched the first one, the abrupt ending will finally make sense.  The movie continues where part one left off; exactly where it left off.

You pretty much get more of the same here.  More long phone calls, more scenes taken from another movie, and scenes repeated from DN Part One, and our nurse taking multiple naps.

This one is still fun.  You get a bum named Brownie who is hilarious (she also played a drunk nympho at the clinic in part one).  This time a detective is cracking down on our nurse's suspicious activities.  Well, and, that's about it.

Death Nurse 1 and 2 really could've been one hour and half film if you excise the padding and the scenes added from other movies.

Death Nurse is hilarious SOV film, if that's your thing.  If shot-on-video '80's movies ARE NOT your thing, Death Nurse 1 and 2 will not make you a believer.  This is specifically for a special audience.  To judge DN on any normal cinema merits would be a mistake, because this is not good in any way except for the so-bad-it's-clinically insane kind of way.  This is sub-atomic cinema scraped from the grungiest of sewers.  Know what you're getting into if you're buying blind.
