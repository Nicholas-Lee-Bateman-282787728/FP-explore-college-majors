8523629,2,B0080KAOTO,"Ok.....I tried to like this film.  I was perhaps hoping for more....like humor and good dialog and some fun scenes.  Not found in this film.  I had loved Outsourced, both the film and the TV series.  This was NOTHING in comparison.  It was slow moving and dull.  I would not suggest this to anyone looking for an entertaining movie.",1443225600,,332,4.5423728813559325
8523630,5,B0080KAOTO,"Loved this movie.  A charming tale about the criss crossing of cultures from India to New Jersey.  It's in the vein of My Big Fat Greek Wedding but FUNNIER!  Lots of fun surprises...one of the guys from the Sopranos (Paulie Walnuts) plays the character of an the Indian god Ganesha..hilarious.  Very original take on the call center world but at it's heart it's about a family of colorful characters including a chai-fueled Mary Poppins from India who takes the cake.  You'll see a lot of actors from the NBC series ""Outsourced"" that was on a couple years ago...I get the feeling they nabbed that cast after seeing this movie.  Not your typical immigrant tale..lots of wit and humor.",1368144000,,683,4.745762711864407
