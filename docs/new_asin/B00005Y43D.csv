7956287,5,B00005Y43D,"Loved this series when it was on LOGO several years ago.  Season 3 introduced some new cast members, but still a good women's prison series.  Used price is the only affordable version at this time.  Wish it would be produced in Region 1.  Similar to Prisoner: Cell Block H.",1460160000,,273,4.510204081632653
7956288,3,B00005Y43D,"At this point, the series was fast becoming a soap opera, but having enjoyed the story from the beginning, it was hard not to continue to follow the antics, spats and hysterics of its characters! If you want the whole collection, you must get this one - otherwise, be content with the best - Series 1.",1411776000,,301,4.392857142857143
7956289,5,B00005Y43D,"If you loved Bad Girls s1 and s2, you need to see s3 to find out what happens to Nikki and Helen. Oh, yeah, and to those other characters, too...
Shed productions is to be commended for allowing fans to have a (spoiler alert) happy ending for one of the most compelling love stories ever told or seen on TV. But it doesn't just happen--the characters have to earn it!
Some fun stuff in the extras, but no deleted scenes, although, there are no scenes like the one in s2 (YOU know the one), so, no worries. Some good cast interviews.",1285200000,,532,4.2772277227722775
