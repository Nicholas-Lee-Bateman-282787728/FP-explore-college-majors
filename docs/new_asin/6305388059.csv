1025750,4,6305388059,"I rented this film (and then later bought the DVD) with fairly low expectations.  I knew it was straight to video and low budget.  I rented it because I am a huge Michael Wincott fan and he actually has a starring role in the film.  Basically, there is a whole lot more to this film than you would think.  It's about redemption, honor, deception, love, friendship, and the ability to make the right decisions and gambles to change your life, all tied together....  I thought Michael Wincott was brilliant in it (Diane Lane and William Peterson were also solid).  I can't talk about my favorite scenes without giving away the end, but when his character, Frankie, sees what is happening, you see the realization on his face and it is heartbreaking.  He rocks thru the end of the film. I felt his performance was extremely underrated - I'd never even heard of this film.  Check it out.",988848000,20,883,4.579617834394904
1025751,3,6305388059,"The other reviews for this film notwithstanding, this is NOT the ""Gun Shy"" that stars Neeson and Platt.  This particular film stars William Peterson (""Manhunter"")as Jake Bridges, and Michael Wincott (""The Crow"")as Frankie McGregor, in what appears to be a fairly cut-and-dried exercise. Jake, a down-and-out writer is befriended by Frankie, a collector for a local mob boss.  Jake needs money and something to occupy his mind so he won't drink himself to death.  Frankie wants an education.
The two of them not only click,they become very good friends, and Peterson falls in love with his friend's girlfriend Melissa, (Diane Lane ""The Cotton Club"")setting up your basic triangle.  The rest of the film is about how this whole thing plays out between them.
What makes it really interesting, though is the strong, homoerotic thread that winds through the film.  By the end, you have to wonder why Melissa is even in the film (Butch assurance, perhaps) since the guys are so emotionally entwined they have made huge sacrifices for each other.  (Don't want to give too much away here, so you'll have to see it for the particulars.)  Even in the details, this thread seems obvious, at least to me.
But hey, don't take my word for it.  If you don't see it, that's fine too.  The film can be enjoyed on a number of levels.  It's not a great film by any stretch, but the acting alone puts it way up on the list.  All three principals turn in wonderful, nuanced performances, making this film well worth seeing.  Give it a shot.",978393600,21,1519,4.733840304182509
1025752,4,6305388059,These reviews are not for the movie shown above. This movie doesn't even have Liam Neeson in it! Just letting you know.,977702400,2,119,4.454545454545454
1025753,3,6305388059,"Liam Neeson plays a top notch, gutsy undercover DEA agent who loses it big time after after almost being executed by some gangsters who uncover his identity in his last bust.  He no longer has the nerves to carry out his undercover actions (thus becomes ""gunshy"").  He has been undercover for awhile and must carry out one last bust before his dream retirement can be fulfilled.  He goes into psychotherapy and makes friends with others in his group session (all likeable characters even though they have problems of their own).
Neeson is the middle man between the drug cartel and a trigger-happy mobster (Oliver Platt) in a multi-million dollar deal. Neeson is convinced Platt will wack him at some point and time during the undercover operation.  However, Platt's character isn't all bad...and as you learn more about his unhappy life a bond of some type forms between Platt and Neeson.
The first 20 minutes of this movie was a little dry and slow as it sets the background for Neeson's current state of mind and intruduces the other characters.  However, the humor really picked up after that...and kept on going til the action packed ending.  I found myself cheering in the end!
If you like only standard humor...this movie may not be for you.  If you like black comedy (i.e. ""Gross Point Blank"" or ""Angel's Dance"") then this movie will fit right in.  It isn't a great movie; but, I found it to be entertaining...and, couldn't wait to see how it would end (by the way...the ending was great! )  I added the video to my collection...and will watch it again.",969753600,2,1561,4.730627306273063

1025919,5,6305388059,"OK first a 'neg' comment .... The tile of this film is so so wrong .... the cover blurb on the cover of a movie about 'Cold Blooded Killers' is wrong and even the picture of the two male leads holding guns is wrong too .... Whats with the gun thing here ... very little gunplay in this movie .. most of it was physical violence on torture .... So probably the producers tried to make this film seem like a ripoff of those 'Tarantino' Cold Blooded killer movies ....

This is a character study movie of a collector for the 'Irish' mob in Atlantic city befriending a down and out writer who seems to have lost his 'edginess' .....

Irrespective of the cold heartedness of the collector, the movie paints the Irish mob boss as so mean and vicious that we start to root for our hero. Seeing him walk into stores or restaurants and break legs of the people who have failed to pay almost becomes fun ....

Great great little film",1119571200,5,923,4.293103448275862
1025920,5,6305388059,"Diane Lane is either the character in real life or has beautiful, understated acting skills.  Her performance is worlds away from acting, it is real life character.  I've seen her in other films but this is truth.  I enjoy subtlety and understement, she made the character sweet, sexy, accessible, and hot, the gitl accross the street from the girl next door.  I am impressed.",1118707200,6,376,4.828125
1025921,3,6305388059,"Wincott was great in Alien Resurrection, but had to be killed off early so Sigourney Weaver could be the strong lead.  He rocks in Gunshy, while Peterson is terrible and Lane has virtually nothing to work with in this poorly written script.  There are huge, gaping holes in the plot, which was apparently written for TV -- or should have been.  This is a movie that survived bad dialog on the basis of reasonably good direction, quite good photography & editing, and excellent acting by the key character, Wincott.  In the end, he was the only one you cared about.  The DVD was cheaply made using the VHS master, thus it is merely 4:3, not widescreen, a major disappointment.",1118534400,3,675,4.638655462184874
1025922,4,6305388059,"A very dark film whose script is surprisingly effective and very, very original. An informer makes a deal, and he introduces in a mobster band as a simple writer who has lost his muse. his right arm will be a simple guy who obeys orders: extremely predictable with a clear of cultural ascendent. Our hero William Petersen much better actor than most of people believe makes a sharp portrait. He works out as a mirror image of Pygmalion and tries to open his eyes through a painstaking reading of Moby Dick with a lot of new discoveries about the life.
The drama completes its circle when Diane Lane a real Supreme Goddess, with natural talent and well gifted skills for acting eventually will be in a brief love affair with our informer. But Petersen is a very straightforward human being. And suddenly something simply doesn't fit where it should have been.
A thriller that keeps its cohesion and dramatic force from beginning to end. No fissures, good cast, excellent illumination and a very good cast. Lane and Petersen shine brighter with more intensity, obviously and establish a very good sexual chemistry.
Above average.",1112140800,4,1127,4.844559585492228
1025923,4,6305388059,"An OK movie, William Petersen carries it. He's an incredible actor, as we all know and too die for handsome & sexy- loved where he was throwing back the straght shots of boos- very realistic- kinda of a weird ending- Diane Lane & him had OK chemistry-don't know the other actor, never have seen , or heard of him before or since- just glad I can see WP on CSI- wished he'd make a killer Oscar winning movie",1077753600,2,406,4.217948717948718

Diane Lane is as always good & beautiful, the chemistry between her & WP was pretty good, lucky girl, to be in bed with him. I liked the last line he spoke in his jail cell, very profound & prolific.

7889126,4,6305388059,"This is one of those films that passed me by but I decided to stream it and I have to say I was greatly impressed. The plot is Jake Bridges (William Petersen) is a down at luck journo, `he likes a drink' and winds up getting fired - arriving home early he finds his wife in bed with another man. So he decides to head to Atlantic City (where they like losers apparently) and get himself royally drunk.

Then he gets into a bar brawl with Meat Loaf - as you do - and is saved from a heavy weight pasting by a low rent crime enforcer Frankie. Said Frankie takes him home to be ministered to by his nurse girl friend. This is Mellissa and Jake falls for her more or less on the spot. Soon, despite initial; reservations, Frankie and Jake are working together; but as you guessed it there is going to be a bumpy ride especially where we have crime, drugs, violence and raging hormones.

This is just a really well made there are twists and some pretty fine acting, Petersen is great and has a terrific on screen presence as does Michael Wincott as the `school of hard knocks' Frankie. If you are at a short end and fancy a decent movie you could do a lot less than giving this a go - recommended.",1425168000,2,1192,4.178260869565217
7889127,3,6305388059,"Not bad, but certainly nothing to write home about. I do wish that there were more ""good"" movies on Prime...",1381622400,,108,4.45
7889128,4,6305388059,"I'm saying up front I liked this movie a lot. A good crime thriller should thrill, and this one had enough thrills to keep me in the game.

Here's the scoop. Jake Bridges (William Petersen) is a writer/investigative reporter who has lost his edge. He heads to Atlantic City to crawl into a bottle. Through a fluke he ends up being befriended by Frankie McGregor (Michael Wincott) who runs ""errands"" for a local thug. Frankie takes a liking to Jake. He likes that Jake is educated and is feeling he could use some of that. The two begin a relationship and Jake starts taking a shine to Frankie's girl Melissa (Diane Lane). That begins to complicate issues as does something else Jake has not told Frankie (don't want to spoil). Now the pot is really boiling.

The first few minutes made me think I was in for the same old same old but that stopped rather quickly. Due to some surprisingly good dialogue and nifty turns in the plot this kept me involved. Why Michael Wincott is not the alpha male in some big budget movies is beyond me. He's got a good camera face, has that raspy drinker's voice and is generally a good actor. He's really good as Frankie. I like William Petersen enough but I'm not a fanboy. This is as good as I've ever seen him and he has some great lines to deliver. I'd pay to watch Diane Lane eat corn flakes so my opinion of her doesn't count here.

Director Jeff Celentano hasn't had much of note in his history, but writer Larry Gross has offered up a good script and given Jeff something to work with. This isn't totally original. It contains many elements of the previous year's ""Donnie Brasco"" but it's still a solid effort well worth watching.",1367798400,,1671,4.454248366013072
7889129,5,6305388059,"This movie  has it all...as far as I'm concerned: Great story, great acting and great location.

7889130,5,6305388059,This is one of those stories that I guess could actually happen to someone that is at a low point in their life. Well acted by the cast. William Petersen makes his character come alive and with his hesitations becomes real. By the end of the film you want him to have what he seaks but also want him to be safe. I would recommend this and did share it with friends.,1265155200,,365,4.083333333333333
