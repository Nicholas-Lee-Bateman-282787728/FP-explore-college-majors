8348491,5,B0020CNQAM,"A marvelous one-woman play, could be adapted for groups.  A fascinating and sympathetic look at the horrendous ways in which our patriarachal society has dealt with women and their spirituality. Pearson achieves with her pen and sense of humor what others can only dream of doing with protests and lobbying.  Power to the Women!  This play needs to be produced and seen like Wilder's ""Our Town.""",1380672000,,395,4.954545454545454
8348492,5,B0020CNQAM,"This book is really great as one learns about the strength of WOMEN throughout history (Herstory)
When you think of the word HISTORY it is about how men view the world. HERSTORY is how WOMEN view the world. I found the strength of each woman portrayed helpful and meaningful for all women. We have been a strong force throughout all the ages, yet very little is mentioned about women's strength.
Very good book and video portraying the strength of women.",1301529600,2,454,4.6875
