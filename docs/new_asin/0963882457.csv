7793725,5,0963882457,"As a young gay man coming out in 1970, I remember reading in the Advocate about LA filmmaker Pat Rocco and his film Mondo Rocco. Finally after 40 years I get to see Mondo Rocco and what a fun trip back to a more innocent and very sexy time.

Rocco accompanies us through the gay events of the day in LA, and he's a great interviewer, jumping into scenes of gay life, asking participants their opinions of the events, cruising in Griffith Park, covering well attended street protests (led by gay activist Reverend Troy Perry), young men with few clothes or in towels act out a kind of soft core plot that revels in the spirit of the day. Rocco is with his camera and crew in a bar as its being raided for having a nude dancer! Later we talk with the lawyers, then back to the drag show in the bar and impersonator Jim Bailey as Mae West singing the music from Hair!

I recommend Mondo Rocco most highly, This is a precious romp back to another era.",1331078400,,947,4.2555555555555555
