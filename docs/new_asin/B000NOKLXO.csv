2776743,5,B000NOKLXO,"Bellydance Basic is a nice starter for a new dancer and is GREAT for practice! Princess Farhana's technique and fun persona will really inspire you to dance. I have been studying and dancing for several years now, and I still find myself refering back and practicing with this DVD for fun.

This DVD covers posture, a brief warm-up, arm positions, basic hip movements, traveling, basic shimmy, figure eights, undulations, arms and hand technique, arm and hand technique with shimmy, and a snappy performance that includes a cute drum solo.

Throughout the instruction she gives clear visuals that are easy to understand, and then shows you how to perform the movement so it looks flawless and graceful. She also includes how to present each move with arm positions. (I had taken classes where they didn't even do that). The way she structures the exercises on this DVD, help prepare the beginning dancer for the more advanced movements you will learn later on.

The lighting, camera work, and sound are good. Although, there are points, you can hear a slight sound of cars driving by in the very beginning of the dvd, it's not distracting, or noticeable throughout.

If you are looking for a fun, beginner level bellydance DVD to supplement your at home practice or if you are new and want to get your feet wet, I think you will enjoy this one.

NOTE: Belly Dance Basics is structured more like an actual bellydance class, you will get excercise but I would not really call it a ""workout.""",1204070400,6,1489,4.778210116731517
2776744,1,B000NOKLXO,"I was singularly unimpressed with this offering from ""Princess"" Farhana.  It looked like it was shot in someone's living room, with wrinkled sheets/curtains as the backdrop, and intermittent loud traffic noise in the background.  She demonstrates moves but does not explain in any depth how to perform them.  I would not recommend this video to any of my students.  It was absolutely painful to view.  I found her calling a large Egyptian-style hip circle a ""butt-wipe"" extremely unprofessional.  While a reasonably competent dancer, she is not by any means a teacher.",1192492800,11,568,5.186813186813187

8180243,5,B000NOKLXO,"After reading Princess Farhana's books (Escape from Houdini Mt, Showgirl Confidential<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showgirl-Confidential-My-Life-Onstage-Backstage-And-On-The-Road/dp/1940213754/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showgirl Confidential: My Life Onstage, Backstage, And On The Road</a>, and Bellydancer MUST HAVE  ""Belly Dance handbook<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Belly-Dance-Handbook-A-Companion-For-The-Serious-Dancer/dp/0615938310/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Belly Dance Handbook: A Companion For The Serious Dancer</a>"") I thought it was high time to start collecting her DVD's. As a Dancer she has studied in Egypt ('over there' as its commonly called) and is a international, and nationally known dancer very active in the Bellydance community.
She gives very clear instruction, and demonstrates  movements in a natural organic way, she explains  in a easy to understand way. She starts off with a nice warmup, and goes through, Posture, Arm and Hand positioning, Basic Hip movements, Basic Shimmy, Traveling steps, figure eights & Undulations plus performances.
She has a ""down to earth"" style and if she ever comes to my area I will move ""heaven and earth"" to see her. She is funny and sweet and you can see from her performances she loves Belly dancing & teaching.
I plan on getting more of Princess Farhana Videos. I have watched her video ""Underbelly"" and recommend it also. I feel Princess Farhana doesn't get the credit she deserves. She is very hard working, funny, professional, entertainer.
I am not a beginner dancer... however I do believe in practice, practice practice. If you get the basics down you won't be like a ""deer in the headlights"" out on the dancefloor. My Teacher teaches learn the basics and let the music take you. I am not one for choreography, although simple combos can help learn steps.
I believe in learning the basics and practice.
I think this is a great video for beginner as well as more advanced dancer to practice with. I like to work with DVD and online Dance classes in between classes with my teacher. Princess Farhana's DVD will be worked into my regular dancing practice/workouts. If you're advanced dancer Dance to Farhan's performance! You will work up a sweat! Great Video!",1399593600,5,2319,5.895833333333333
8180244,4,B000NOKLXO,"This video really helps me ""get"" some moves that had been eluding me before. I like Princess Farhana's no-frills style of instruction and have probably used this DVD more than any of my other beginning belly dance selections. I feel it was well worth the money I paid for it and I recommend it to anyone who is trying to learn the basics of belly dance.",1342310400,,353,4.363636363636363
8180245,5,B000NOKLXO,"I am a beginner, taking bellydance classes. When I bought this DVD, I wasn't sure what to expect (some of the reviews seemed less than stellar). But after working with it, I am glad I got it. The instructor teaches everything well and has a fun personality. This DVD covers almost everything we do in bellydance classes- like basic dance posture, some of the hip movements (like hips drops-up & down, hip circles, figure 8's), undulations, the shimmy.

I really liked the way she taught the hand and arm movements. They were very graceful and she showed you how to pair them with your hip movements. I can see with a little practice that I will eventually be able to achieve that look for myself. It was also great to have get another ""take"" on the bellydance moves. I was having trouble understanding a few of the moves in class, and wasn't able to perform them very well. The way she taught them really clicked with me  and I finally ""got"" it. She also covers some traveling combinations, that look more advanced but were do-able for me as a beginner. She is also constant about your posture, (very helpful for me) and how to maintain it though each movement. She includes what ""not"" to do, as well as, lots of repetition of the correct movement.

Some mentioned, Jenna's ""Bellydance Basics & Beyond."" I have this one too, and it is very good, a bit better production and covers all the bellydance basics. But I am glad I didn't pass Princess Farhana's up, based on that. I found she has some different methods of teaching that worked better for me, as well as, some different material (traveling combinations, history, hand technique, etc.) that is not covered on the other. Over the last few weeks, I find I like rotating between the two beacuse they both have alot of great information.

I would not say Princess Farhana's ""Bellydance Basic Workout""  is the definitive of beginner bellydance dvds, but it does have alot of good material & technique that is valuable for the beginner studying bellydance. It probably won't satisfy those looking for a serious workout, (like Kathy Smith's-areobics styled with a few bellydance moves), because the material is really like a class, to actually learn bellydance technique. The title is misleading.

I would recommend it to any beginner bellydancer that wants to work on technique and broaden your learning.",1333670400,5,2356,4.776412776412776
8180246,5,B000NOKLXO,"Princess Farhana is a great teacher, who not only teaches basic technique, but also gives background information about the dance form and its history.  She is smart and funny and teaches a very enjoyable class.  If you truly want to learn how to belly dance and want a solid, basic foundation, then this video is definitely for you!",1329782400,6,332,4.706896551724138
8180247,1,B000NOKLXO,"I too was taken in by the beautiful photo, the pretty pink chiffon, and the word 'Princess'.  I guess those sales people really do know how eye appeal sells!  First off, this lady is TOUGH! Tough, as in her demeaner, someone you wouldn't want to make mad at you!  Her beautiful photo on the cover was totally different than the tough girl from the streets that I was so glad that wouldn't want to run into an alley.  (sorry, but I'm trying to be truthful).  Her  personality must have came from her pauper who lives in the dungeon!  I have bellydanced for some time, off and on, but have never seen such a terrible tape, the organization, the hesitation in her 'what do I do' to show the steps, which often she didn't!  I don't like bad reviews, but this was real bad!  I haven't seen the second tape that came with the second one that yes, I bought her double DVD set.  I beter stop, as I don't have any more to say.  O.K., one more thing, I have been seeing a chiropracter and masseuse, to help my muscles, yet, with her workout, I have to look up at the t.v. so much, I torked my neck and through out my back by trying to watch, since she gave no instructions.  All done, good night!",1273622400,3,1186,4.199115044247788
8180248,2,B000NOKLXO,"I just bought this dvd, but it was over before it even started. The workout was so short, did not even brake a sweat, I could not believe it was over so soon. The whole workout session was like a warm-up! Seems many of these belly dancing dvds are all about bios, and promoting their clubs, gyms, whatever, than of really focusing on teaching how to dance, which is why I purchased this in the first place. In the end She spent a good part of the video dancing in full costume, but for what!? I did not buy this video to see how good she can dance, I expected to see how good she can dance and SHOW me how I can achieve the same. Total dissapointment, don't even bother with this dvd, spend a little bit more money on a dvd that has more instruction, rather than intros, bios, and show off performances that don't teach you anything. You will learn a thing or two, but that's it! Really, a THING OR TWO............",1248134400,,914,4.228571428571429
8180249,1,B000NOKLXO,"I'm quite unsure how anyone gave this a good review.  They must have NEVER seen ANY other belly dance video in the world EVER.  The girl seems like she's on drugs.  Her teaching skills are awful.  If you must see this terrible monstrosity, rent it from the library.  Don't waste your money.  I highly recommend one of Jenna's DVD's.",1236297600,2,332,4.5423728813559325
8180250,1,B000NOKLXO,"The pretty cover is a total dupe! Inside the video is the EXACT opposite. Lord almighty, this is the ugliest bellydance video I've seen in 15 years.

Looks like it was shot in a 1930's catholic school gym with a dirty, old and stained, hardwood floor. Behind Farhara dressed in basic black (no princess accroutments evident...she looks less glamourous than a soccer mom) hang dragging-floor-to-ceiling tattered blue satin curtains of the gaudiest color, making your eyes beg for relief. I don`t know what those curtains are hiding but I kept expecting basketballs from the junior high team no doubt playing behind her, to come flying in.

Farhana herself is not a terrible dancer persay - but lets face it, bellydance for all it's technique and work is not rocket science, but a dance whose technique is constantly under interpretion, unlike, say ballet, so tho I would not classify her as `bad`, she`s no inspiring swan song either. Her technique is sloppy and ungainly as far as a teacher goes. She's good-natured enough but does not have the polish of a professional educator and I felt ripped off by this two-bit, pathetic production and frankly was flat out angry I`d wasted my money.

The audio is terrible! The echo of her voice in the empty room is unforgivable. The cover leads one to believe a romanitic almost princess-like class awaits - or at the very least, a dvd with some composure and class, but alas it is not so. Save your cash and buy almost any other bellydance video. Best of luck in the future, Farhara, and blessings to you, but this video is just not worth the purchase.

If you want to see the total opposite in style, panache, and sophistication, purchase `Luscious - The Bellydance Workout for Beginners (2008)` - it is gorgeous and smart and gives you the experience you were probably looking for in Princess Farhara`s instruction and production distaster of a dvd. There`s just far too many excellent bellydance dvds out on the market to settle for the likes of this very unroyal wasteland.",1223337600,8,2020,4.795977011494253
8180251,1,B000NOKLXO,"I got this dvd for a cheaper price at another store.  I was not even worth the cheaper price.  I use to pass by it with my mind telling me not to get it, but I finally fell for it and purchased it.  My mind was right, it was not good.",1213401600,6,234,3.549019607843137
