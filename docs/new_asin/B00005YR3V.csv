1676545,5,B00005YR3V,"A great product for aficionados of art film. These aren't the easiest films to get your mind around. However, the product has useful helps - a brief but incisive summary of each film on the back of the case, ""chapter"" headings, and a discussion featurette concerning the cinema of Godard. Discussion points in the featurette are supported by scenes from the four films in this package. ..The aim of this type of cinema is to stimulate thinking and to educate, but these films are sensual, erotic, comical and poetic as well. Lots of slapstick, film genre-hopping and beautiful actors and actresses.",1227657600,18,598,4.930693069306931
1676546,5,B00005YR3V,"This box set was worth the money and space on your shelf. The movies are some of Godard's less known, but also very creative, with great actors.",1206748800,6,144,4.37037037037037
1676547,4,B00005YR3V,"Give me a cinematic film over a naturalistic one any day. I'm an unapologetic fan of pretty pictures, and auteur Jean-Luc Godard made some of the most beautiful, ever.

If you're like me, you will want to see Lionsgate's new collection, entitled simply: The Jean-Luc Godard Boxed Set. While these later films in the famous French New Wave director's oeuvre are not his most popular, they are certainly right up there with the rest of his work as far as good looks go.

Passion
First Name: Carmen
Dtective
Oh Woe is Me

I watched Dtective (1985) for the first time, mainly because it seems to be singled out as one of his ""worst"" and ""most commercial"" movies, done ""just for the money."" It is supposed to be a film noir farce, but it's hardly a send up of a genre ala the films of Edgar Wright. In this one, you have to look pretty hard for the satire. But that's OK - it's gorgeous, and the characters are quirky.

More about mis-en-scene than the mystery at hand, Dtective ostensibly follows the intersecting - but not necessarily connected - stories of a collected group of people ensconced in the Hotel Concorde St. Lazare in Paris. Watching them all is the titled detective, Isidore (Jean-Pierre Laud), his uncle (Laurent Terzieff) and their luscious young love interest, Arielle (Aurelle Doazan).

As the detective himself says, ""To sum up: Lots of stories here, ours and other people's. Something is bound to happen."" A lot does happen, but in a very languid, roundabout manner - this is definitely the kind of movie you watch for love of art, not for mindless popcorn-munching.

The DVD is fairly skimpy on the extras, nevertheless there is an excellent, short-but-sweet documentary which serves to introduce the viewer to the filmmaker's singular sensibility and his personal philosophies. There are some great quotes from Godard himself, and refreshing observations from a handful of film historians focusing on these movies in particular. It's very well-done. Recommended.

I stumble onto this godsend of a box set which is cheap as dirt and the transfers look just as good if Criterion had done them. The films are all top shelf if you're into Godard and are ready to absorb his later style. I have the lone 90's film on this set to watch yet, so maybe this review is a little too early, but the first three films merit 5 stars alone - add a little documentary and 4th film on and sweet baby jesus throw these in your DVD player.",1465344000,3,503,3.9313725490196076
7956970,4,B00005YR3V,"The two really good films in the set are Passion and First name Carmen, which is Godard's take on the Bizet opera. I love the way he threads elements of the opera into the contemporary story line. Marushka Detmers is strikingly pretty and Jacques Bonnafe is virile and funny, a sort of young Brando. Detective has some good moments but is not top-drawer, while Oh Woe is me wastes the talents of Depardieu and Masliah.",1455062400,,418,4.586666666666667

7956972,4,B00005YR3V,"The director's long, complicated relationship with beautiful images is worked in this package of four films: Passion, First Name: Carmen, Detective, and Oh, Woe is Me. Best one? Passion.

There's no story, per se, in any of these, so you must watch for other reasons, and chief among these, for those of us who love Godard, is the sense that any image is multiple: the director is writing an essay, sorting through different 'tries' at understanding pieces of his life; the director is making a traditional film, with characters, with motives, with desires (which braid with the director's desires).",1397260800,3,599,5.05050505050505

As a serious film watcher, I'm pretty tough on rating them.  Four stars is about the maximum any film gets.  Had the passage of time not made these features less shocking and controversial, I probably would have given them a five star rating.",1355961600,3,502,4.659090909090909
7956975,4,B00005YR3V,"This three disc set of movies includes four films, and one 29 minute documentary about these particular films. The films are as follows:

""Passion""(1982) is a film about a director who is struggling to make a film, just as Godard is struggling to make this and other films. This film is about the process of film making, but also about the struggle to make art, which is illustrated with various live sets of famous works of art from Goya to Rembrandt, Rubens and Delacroix. Hanna Schygulla, and Isabelle Huppert appear in this film.

""First Name: Carmen""(1983) is a satirical film that is reminiscent at times of a Charlie Chaplin or the Keystone Cops film. One particularly humorous scene is of a bank robbery, with one of the cops firing at one of the robbers (Carmen, played by Maruschka Detmers), which evolves into a close contact wrestling match, and then into a scene of two lovers on the floor kissing oneanother. The two lovers then eventually run off together running from the law. The rest of the film focuses on the two lovers and their quarrels. Godard uses a pastiche of fragmented sounds and images to evoke a story about conflict that goes beyond two lovers in order to address various political issues about gender,power and economics. Godard appears in this film as a film director who is living in an asylum, and who is Carmen's uncle.

""Detective""(1985) is a collage of styles from film noir, melodrama, slapstick, and comedy to romance. A detective stakes out a hotel of people, some of whom are involved with the mafia, all of which takes place in and opposite a hotel in Paris. Laurent Terzieff and Jean-Pierre Leaud portray the detective and assistant. Johnny Hallyday is a fight promoter who is having an affair with Nathalie Baye, while Alain Cluny is a Mafia head. Julie Delpy also appears in the film.

""Oh, Woe is Me (Helas Pour Moi)"" (1992) is one of the rare Godard films that mostly takes place in the out of doors amongst nature. Gerard Depardieu portrays Simon, who has been possessed by a cruel God. This is a modern take on the tale of Zeus coming to earth and disguising himself as a woman's husband. The film is beautifully photographed and lighted with multilayers of sound and voices.

All in all this is an interesting and varied collection of films. These films won't be to everyone's taste, but they are entertaining in a thoughtful way. Godard is all about the truth of making a film, and he never lets us forget that we are watching a film all the while discussing a variety of subjects. As Godard says, ""Cinema is truth at 24 frames a second.""",1316649600,18,2590,4.671052631578948
7956976,1,B00005YR3V,"The films are stupid, pointless and sloppily done. Plus the unnecessary underage nudity made them even more offensive. No wonder they're forgotten.",1268611200,2,147,5.7272727272727275
