8029013,1,B0002M5U5Q,"Some of the moves are nice to look at and some are even awsome, but it doesn't have that same touch of reality and heart it brought from the veyr first mixtap in the 90's. Its like when wrestling was hot you had Stone Cold and the Rock and Undertaker and now its more fake and water down with garbage. Even the moves arnt as realistic as they use to be. They are some good things like Johhn  Cina but this is just a comperissen I CAN MAKE WITH MIXTAP DVD THE OLD IS WAY BETTER THEN THE NEW AND IT FEELS LIKE ITS MISSING SOME THING",1294099200,,530,3.953271028037383
8029014,3,B0002M5U5Q,"This dvd is good.  It didn't blow my mind or anything.  However if you own the seasons of the and 1 streetball tour which aired on espn you will recognize a lot of the footage.  Some of the footage is from the shows just from different camera angles.  There is a substantial amount of new footage including dunks from hellicopter.  This dvd is definately worth a look especially if you are collecting all the mixtapes, but I suggest you buy it used.",1113782400,,449,4.426829268292683
8029015,5,B0002M5U5Q,yo my name is josh and i just watched tha and 1 mix tape vol. 7 and it iz sick. its got a bunch of awesome new moves an ballas. i definetly recomend this movie to any1 who likes streetball.,1099094400,2,189,3.75
8029016,5,B0002M5U5Q,"Yo this dvd is the truth. I never seen b-ball like this in my life, so go out and cop this one for real peeps.",1096502400,3,110,3.44
8029017,4,B0002M5U5Q,"I just watched vol 7 - the highlights are nice...especially of the rookies - professor, helicopter....the battle scenes with hot sauce and the other dribble guys are smooth.  The dvd shows highlights from and1 games and its put to music with some natural sound (you can hear the MC) in the background.

I liked this dvd - its solid....but the Jason williams highlights were weak...just basic shots and passes..nothing fancy from high school that you wouldn't see at any HS game...the helicopter dunk contest is not that good either cause it has no natural sound just slo mo and music in the background...

but overall, the rest of the dvd makes up for this cause the highlights of professor and helicopter are too sweet....helicopter is one of the best dunkers in the world - he must have like a 50"" vertical since he's only 6-1.  Professor is a white guy who can dribble and gaffle dudes on the court - he's much more flashier than even jason williams...kinda skinny though but he does some awesome moves...

I would get this dvd cause the highlights are top notch.",1095206400,4,1066,4.679144385026738
8029018,4,B0002M5U5Q,"This is the best tape since volume 3. The mixtape begins with scene of nba players like skip to my lou and ricky davis, skip is crazy. After you got scenes with jason williams in high school. Then you got the guys that started all that and then you got my favorite part of the mixtape, professor with his game winners, got get it and helicpoter with their amazing dunk !!! Overall, you got good music with amazing basketball scene, not better then the 3 but a great mixtape",1094774400,3,473,4.325842696629214
8029019,5,B0002M5U5Q,"yo just grabbed the new DVD at the AND 1 store down in Philly.  simply put, this is the best AND 1 Mix Tape since Vol. 3 when they broke out with AO & Sauce on VHS.

The footage is unreal; there is some from Streetball Season 2, but it is only the hottest clips from the show and you get to see the moves/etc. from other angles.  This is only a small portion of the joint too - there's AO college footage which is nice & of course the JWill footage of him tossing oops to R. Moss back in high school.  The break out the guys into rookies - Copter, Go Get It, Professor - and then two sections of the Mix Tape Players.  There's also Skip, Ricky Davis and Speedy Claxton footage along with some 'crash the courts' in different cities and AO just wilin' out.  The music is pretty hot too - they got some big names like beastie boys and mobb deep but those aren't even the best tracks on the thing.

Bonus features are cool - the 'Copter NCAA dunk contest is hot and there is a ton of other stuff on there.  They also included the Flash video they played before the game this summer.  Bottom line, def worth the buy - there's a trailer for Ball Access 2 when they go over to Europe that i'm already saving up for.  I think AND 1 is back - i'm gonna buy all of their tapes regardless, but now I will watch them over & over again like the old days.  If you know AND 1, go get Mix Tape Volume 7 right now.

I'm out.",1094428800,5,1408,3.9539007092198584
