541328,4,6303029310,"This miniseries is great in that it presents Dr. King as the complex human being that he was with some of his insecurites and personal issues intact as opposed to the saint that he is often portrayed. The intracacies behind the Birmingham, Memphis, and Vietnam campaigns are handled well and Winfield makes a very good MLK. Cicely Tyson does very well as Coretta and incidentally, Rosa Parks is played by MLK's daughter Yolanda. The scenes of MLK smoking cigarettes and the adultery issue will shock a lot of people, but after all, the man was born in Atlanta and not Bethlehem, and these are based on acknowledged facts.

However, these is a scene that will annoy historians and Malcolm X fans. The treatment of King's meeting with M/X is an unfair fictionalization of what really happened. M/X is shown as hatemongering lunatic who encourages people in the ghettoes to burn down their cities. The producers have Malcolm confused with a later generation of militants, as the record shows that while the real Malcolm had his faults, he never publicly condoned mindless violence aside from self-defense.

This aside, and the composition of characters as prototypes of Bayard Rustin and Jesse Jackson aisde, this stays pretty close to the facts. Watch and enjoy, but read a good King bio such as ""Bearing the Cross"" by Taylor Branch, or ""Let the Trumpet Sound"" by Stephen Oates afterwards to get a broader picture.",1106006400,41,1412,4.903765690376569

541330,5,6303029310,"KING is one of the best miniseries I've ever seen. Paul Winfield is terrific as Martin Luther King, Jr., and is supported by a great ensemble cast (including Ossie Davis as King, Sr.). A fine film worthy of praise. God be praised!

541502,5,6303029310,Loved this movie!!! I think it's a great bio.,1453680000,,45,4.111111111111111
541503,4,6303029310,"I was in the fifth grade when this movie first aired on television.  I was a history buff even in those days, so I enjoyed most of it (I was only ten years old, so parts of it were over my head).  I watched it again several years later after I had earned my bachelor's degree in history.  By that time I had read quite a bit about Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement, so I viewed it somewhat more critically.  Even then, I must say it held up pretty well.  The movie begins when King, as a young ministerial student, is first introduced to Coretta Scott.  They later get married, and King becomes pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.  The movie then depicts Rosa Parks' arrest for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white man, and the ensuing bus boycott.  King is very popular in the black community, so he is enlisted to lead the boycott.  After Mrs. Parks wins her case, King realizes he has launched a national civil rights movement, so he resigns his pastorate in order to devote his full attention to the cause.  The movie depicts all the upheavals of the 1960's and ends with King's assassination.  It also devotes some attention to how the movement affected his family life, and not always in a good way.

Like most Hollywood productions, this movie contains some inaccuracies, but they're fairly minor.  For one thing, Paul Winfield was much taller than the real Dr. King.  One scene depicts him meeting with President Lyndon Johnson, and the two are about the same height (in real life, LBJ was 6'3"" and MLK was 5'7"").  I suspect the producers decided Winfield's acting talent made up for this historical flaw, and I have to agree.  However, even a fine actor like Winfield was not up to the challenge of recreating King's speeches.  Listen to Winfield's speeches in the film and compare them with actual recordings of Dr. King, and you'll see that they just aren't the same.

Those points aside, I thought this was a very good movie.  It depicts King not as a superman, but as a human being with real flaws.  I also like the movie's treatment of President Kennedy, who is often inaccurately portrayed as a champion of civil rights.  As the movie depicts, Kennedy was actually rather slow in dealing with civil rights issues, and this created some friction between him and King.  The movie also accurately presents King's break with the Johnson administration over the Vietnam War, which caused some tension between King and other civil rights leaders. Winfield was great in the title role, but he also had a solid supporting cast.  Ossie Davis gave a very convincing performance as Martin Luther King, Sr., and Dolph Sweet, who later played Chief Kaninsky on ""Gimme a Break"", was very impressive in his portrayal of the menacing J. Edgar Hoover.

My favorite part of the movie is the way it shows King's refusal to lead from behind.  He knew other people were paying a price for civil rights, and he was determined to pay that price with them.  As a political conservative, I can't say I agree with King on all issues (redistribution of wealth, for instance), but I'll be the first to admit that the man had guts.  If you want to see a movie that makes the struggles of the civil rights movement come alive, I highly recommend this one.",1453507200,,3299,4.585324232081911
541504,5,6303029310,"King, 1978 film

It begins with a news movie that recreates the struggle and turmoil of a demonstration. Some of the supporters had never been seen before in this Memphis Tennessee march. [This was in support of a strike by sanitation workers.] Is non-violence a tactic or a principle? The story begins in 1952 Boston where M. L. King Jr. called Coretta for lunch. They become friends. M. L. King Sr. tells Coretta about his son. Handling money is important. Rosa Parks tells of the incident in December 1955. She was arrested for refusing to give up her seat. There will be a protest, no bus riding on Mondays. A man gave advice on a boycott. M. L. King Jr. headed other campaigns for reform with modest demands. Terrorists bombed his home! Dr. King tells his supporters to avoid weapons. But he applies for a license for a gun. Does non-violence work? [It depends on the situation.] Then Dr. King is arrested and put in jail; he is hit. He is found guilty: $10 plus costs. He refuses, he didn't deserve it.

Somebody put up the bail money. The police arrest many, the laws make their behavior illegal (waiting for a car pool isn't loitering). The US Supreme Court ruled segregation on buses illegal. Can Dr. King become the leader of other groups? Bus boycotts spread to other cities. Dr. King was stabbed on a visit to Harlem; he survived. He later visited India (he was an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi). Dr. King and a friend visit a whites-only restaurant; they are arrested. King is denied bail then given six months on a Georgia chain gang! Candidate JFK calls Kings wife and offers support. The Freedom Riders created controversy and violence. Attorney-General Robert Kennedy ordered Federal Marshals to protect King. The bodies of three civil rights workers were  found buried beneath an earthen dam in Philadelphia Mississippi (June 1964). King went there. Is the FBI doing its job enforcing Federal laws? J. Edgar Hoover calls King a notorious liar. They demonstrate in Birmingham and are put in jail. What can the JFK Administration do?

Some people ask them to leave. People can be hurt or killed. Will they use children in their demonstrations? The jails are filled with demonstrators, theres no room left for new arrests. The children follow the example of their elders. They violate the city law of demonstrating without a license. Fire hoses are used against them! Police dogs threaten them! This is televised to the nation. Dr. King is arrested again while praying (they are out of bail money). This time the Fire Department refused to hose down the protesters. The turmoil (and economic damage) caused a change in policy: Birmingham was desegregated. But the bombing of a church killed four young children! Is it worth it? Will JFK make a speech in support? Yes, even if it prevents his re-election. It is a moral issue, he asks for a new Civil Rights law. The FBI investigates Dr. King and his associates. They want to dig up dirt against Dr. King or his wife! Dr. King plans a March on Washington.

Dr. King is told to get rid of one of his valued advisers; he does. After this they learn of JFKs assassination! Dr. King predicts his fate. President Lyndon B. Johnson meets Dr. King and tells what he will accomplish. Dr. King wins the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. J. Edgar Hoover sent a letter against Dr. King; Hoover got signatures from the Attorney-General for his actions. Will Hoover obey orders? People want to register to vote, they are forbidden. Some because of legal problems. They will appeal to Governor Wallace and the legislature. They will march from Selma to Washington in protest for a voting rights bill. [Note the period automobiles.] Tony Bennett sings to entertain the marchers. A housewife from Detroit shows up to help. Another car follows at night. There are shots! Later Dr. King visits Chicago to talk about jobs, housing, and schools. They show one rental apartment. King talks to Malcolm X. Can they end poverty for black people? What is the right thing to do? Malcolm tells King they have one thing in common: they are both dead men. Chicago will better police housing violations. Does the press play on peoples fears? Is Chicago different from Birmingham? Mayor Daley explains.

Dr. King will speak out against the War in Vietnam next. But his friends advise him against this, it will go against the President. But Dr. King persists. This leads to attacks in the Press and attempts to destroy Kings family life. A letter is sent his wife, there is a tape recording as well. [These can be faked liked letters.] King talks about his death; he doesnt want a long funeral. Only talk about what he did for others. Some attack King for his attack on the War in Vietnam. Was it the most unjust and brutal war in American history?  [Didnt Bishop Fulton J. Sheen also do the same?] People in Chicago are angry. Worse than in Georgia? Mayor Daley agrees to a Housing Commission. Why do these people hate so much? [Human error or sinfulness?] King says the War in Vietnam is a sign of deep problems. [Wars are about loot and always have been.]

King speaks to the SNCC against violence and hate and evil. They show scenes of poverty. What can be done? King plans to unite people in a war against poverty. In Memphis Tennessee two sanitation workers seek shelter from the rain; there is an accident. The families won't be compensated. They ask King to go there to make a speech, then return to Washington for the Poor Peoples March. There is violence. Later King reminisces about the past. King will go back to Memphis. Young men were paid by the FBI to interrupt the march! This young man is not the only one. Kings speech reiterates his past accomplishments. He just wants to do Gods will. [Did he have a premonition?] Guards are withdrawn from the fire station across from the motel. There is a shot! Martin is hit in the throat, a fatal shot. The doctors in the ER work on him. Im sorry, weve lost him says the surgeon.

Was this a lone gunman or a conspiracy? There are books published that question the idea of a lone gunman as the shooter. This movie avoids anything against the man who was accused and plead guilty. Did the family of M. L. King Jr. believe in a long gunman?",1453334400,,6217,4.649681528662421

The late Ossie Davis convincingly played his father Martin sr. If you looked up Martin St photo n Ossie Davis's as the father they have an uncanny resemblance.

541681,5,6303029310,"This movie had a profound impact on white me! I thought Paul Winfield did an excellent job as Dr. King. I have read that ""CASTING"" is the key to any great movie, and in this case it was outstanding! Cicely Tyson was superb as Coretta. I could not stop crying through most of the movie. It was fascinating seeing Dr. King's daughter, Yolanda, playing Rosa Parks during the Montgomery bus boycott. I was also fascinated by seeing Dr. King's sister, Christine, singing a solo during one of the church services. Dr. King's son, MLK III was supposedly in the movie, too. Could you imagine if our first BLACK President of the United States had been Dr. King, or even his son, MLK III???? Would white and black American soldiers be killing hated Muslims by the millions? My how we refuse to learn from the history portrayed in this movie! And, how many years after the Civil War did the Civil Rights movement take place? How many of you readers know that Dr. King's Mother, Mama King, was shot and killed on 06/30/74 while playing the organ during Sunday service at Ebenezer Baptist Church?

541880,5,6303029310,"I've seen a few movies on King and have gotten something out of all of them.  What I particularly enjoyed about this presentation is how it showed King's vulnerability, his concerns over where political activism would take his life, and how it would effect (even endanger) his family.  That's a quandary for many activists, activists we'll never know the names of.  I know lawyers who have challenged large polluting businesses and have received threats for their efforts.  There are people all over this country/world challenging powerful interests in one way or another who encounter challenges similar to those that King did, or Jesus did.

This DVD provides a good depiction of how it is that people often choose to keep supporting efforts for justice, including people in the entertainment industry like Tony Bennett, and people who once were part of the establishment like Ramsey Clark - both of whom make appearances in the film.

I'm going to get a copy of this DVD and donate it to a Goodwill after all my friends and co-workers have seen it.  I want to be sure that people with few resources have a chance to discover it.

I was amazed to learn that Al Freeman Jr (who played Elijah Muhammad in the MX movie) also played one of MLK's colleagues in the MLK movie, & that all 4 of the real King children (Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter & Bernice) played other characters in the movie.

Among the differences between the movie & the facts is that the church bombing in which the 4 girls died actually happened after, instead of before, MLK's ""I Have A Dream"" speech. Also, the funeral scene shows 4 caskets, whereas in real life one family opted for a separate funeral. As for the meeting between MLK & MX, it happened in Washington DC surrounded by reporters & photographers, not in Chicago behind a closed door; in fact, MX had already been killed by the time MLK went to Chicago. And of course, the names of a few characters were changed.

All in all, it's a wonderful movie, with 3 parts lasting about an hour & a half each. Now that I have DVDs of both MLK & MX, I keep them side by side in front of the rest of my DVD collection.",1127088000,11,1729,4.837837837837838

It came out on Jan. 11th. Having grown up watching King I'm at a loss for words...the late Paul Winfield's protrayal of Dr. King was superb, and the march/arrest scenes were almost identical to the actual footage. Watching King for me was almost like being there, I only wish that I'd been blessed with the chance to meet him in person as my mother did. That having been said,off to Media Play & Best Buy I go, GOD BLESS DR. KING(RIP) and PAUL WINFIELD(RIP).",1106179200,19,614,4.3478260869565215
