4104632,5,B003AT9DDS,Clint Eastwood....really is there anything else I. Have to say? He is such an amazing groundbreaking influence in cinema. People say it's Steve Mcqueen who started the macho genre. I say no! It was Clint Eastwood. This is a compilation showing his directorial side and really shows how amazing his talent really is. All four movies are amazing and he directs them well.,1347321600,3,369,4.873015873015873

4104634,5,B003AT9DDS,"I purchased this used in ""Like New"" condition and it was no different than buying it new from the store.  So instead of paying over $50 I only paid $18. The discs and case were in perfect condition.

Now, I am a huge Eastwood fan.  He is not only one of my favorite actors but he is also one of my favorite directors.  Each movie comes with plenty of special features and the picture and sound for each film is awesome in HD.  What I love best about this set is the compactness.  All four movies come in a regular size blu-ray case.  If you're like me, I love to save space and this set does that very thing.

Don't hesitate, buy it today!",1294444800,5,639,4.096774193548387

4104639,1,B003AT9DDS,So the old egg-sucker wanted to do something slow & boring to prove that he's a deep artist rather than mere day-making gunslinger. MYSTIC RIVER made of molasses & then boiled down a bit for thick. Weak granny's revenge on strutting Sean Penn.,1453852800,2,243,4.674418604651163

4104648,5,B003AT9DDS,"These are Eastwood's great films. I had previously avoided ""Million Dollar Baby"" but now have seen it. An excellent film. Eastwood's films always end with good triumphing over evil. I especially enjoy the commentaries as an added feature.",1408147200,2,238,5.2894736842105265
4104649,5,B003AT9DDS,"Movie language is all in Japanese, subtitled in English. Although being subtitled, I found this flick very interesting even though I had to read the subtitles. The Japanese Military had to put up with the same propaganda and BS as we Americans had to put up with. I rated it 5 stars because of the truth being told. [2006 Academy Award; Best Sound Editing]

The other three movies which ALL won acadamy awards:
MILLION DOLLAR BABY--4 Academy Awards [2004 Best Picture]
MYSTIC RIVER--2 Academy Awards, starring Sean Penn [Best Actor],  Robbins [Best Supporting Actor]
UNFORGIVEN--4 Academy Awards.[1992 Best Picture, Best Director, best editing, Best supporting Actor, Hackman] Starring Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris.

4104652,5,B003AT9DDS,After watching these films you have to wonder why Eastwood would attempt comedy. But the movies are great; well made and engrossing. But this isn't the collection to watch back to back.,1357689600,,185,4.8125

4104655,5,B003AT9DDS,"When you think about it, Eastwood the actor and Eastwood the director are the same person but two different careers.

As an actor, Eastwood built his reputation playing macho tough guys. Of course, he evolved throughout his career. But its those roles that are the most iconic ones. As a director he started out tackling genre pictures. But eventually he moved on to more ambitious material. (Side note: Even his genre pictures often offered more depth than the run of the mill competition. His High Plains Drifter is definitely among the top 10 greatest westerns ever.)

Essential Eastwood Director's Collection is a 4-DVD set that contains 4 of his greatest dramatic films: 1992's Unforgiven, 2003's Mystic River, 2004's Million Dollar Baby and 2006's Letters From Iwo Jima.

All 4 movies are excellent. Unforgiven, while tough to watch at times, definitely deserved all the accolades it received. No offense to LOTR: Return Of The King. But Mystic River was THE film of 2003. Million Dollar Baby is definitely a modern classic and one of the few films that has legitimately moved me to tears (Precious is another]. Letters From Iwo Jima is an excellent companion to Flags Of Our Fathers and the stronger movie overall.

The only real gripe about the DVDs is the lack of special features on them. Unforgiven and Mystic River both feature audio commentaries. But for the most part the set is fairly bare-bones. But since the primary reason most people will have for purchasing it is for the movies theselves that's not a serious demerit.

Seeing as this is only $9.99 on Amazon and I bought my copy for the same price elsewhere, the odds are good you can find this cheap. So I definitely recommend doing so. You can't get a better bargain than four great movies for $10.59. My hat goes off to Mr. Eastwood, a true auteur. Just don't talk to anymore furniture at political conventions eh.",1348012800,4,1888,4.814814814814815

So I ordered and received this item but the movie was NOT in English but still in the original Spoken Japanese with English subtitles.

His masterpiece western, Unforgiven, is also one of my favorite movies ever. Sands of Iwo Jima is one of the more gripping war dramas I have ever seen. Mystic River contains some out-of-this-world acting in a crushing drama about friendship and time. The movies in this collection are all worthy of watching again and again and prove quite beautiful and introspective.",1488758400,3,516,5.154761904761905
