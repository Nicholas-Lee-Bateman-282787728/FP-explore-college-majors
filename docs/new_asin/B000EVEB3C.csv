8114715,3,B000EVEB3C,"I grew up loving these kinds of movies, and remember all these ones very favorably. However, this particular set of DVDs were taken directly from the tv videos and done very poorly. One of the movies is so dark, it is often hard to see the faces of the actors--and definitely hard to see the monster that was the focus of the movie. It was still good to see the old Gamera movies again, and the other three or four--but it is a case of getting what I paid for (and I didn't pay much).",1307836800,3,484,4.105263157894737
8114716,4,B000EVEB3C,"If memory serves, 4 or 5 of these are Gamera movies from the 70's. (He was the flying turtle with those two big teeth.) Yongary was Korea's answer to Godzilla, and Warning from Space was a Toho Studio space opera.  Monster from a Prehistoric Planet, I believe, was the other name for Gappa, the triphibian monster, this was a family monster movire with a mamma, daddy and baby. If you liked the giant rubber-suited monsters of the 70's this looks like a good collection.  While I have seen all these movies, I have not previewed this set so I have no idea what the quality might be like.  Since these, Gamera and Godzilla (no big-G movies in this collection) have grown up and there are much better outings filmed in the late 90's and 00's.",1151020800,6,740,4.466666666666667
8114717,5,B000EVEB3C,"growing up i would have loved to of had this set of movies. they are silly but fun movies and as cheese as i remember them. these bring back the days of rushing home after school and watching the afternoon movie.

  the best thing about this collection is the transfers,they look very good and the company that puts out these sets put extras with them and that makes them even better. give these a try,the price is right.",1147046400,9,421,4.371794871794871
