2522672,5,B000EMG918,"Imagine you could pick your favorite villains, from your favorite TV show, and do more than just reinvent those villains, but invent those villains,  infront of the eyes of a viewer totally familiar with who those villains are, then go back and tell the story of their origin from the perspective of the protagonist. When that protagonist is a TIMELORD, it's easy to tell that story. That is just what Genesis of the Daleks is, the story of how the Doctor's greatest enemy comes to be. But, this concept is taken further than just telling their origin, the Doctor's mission is to stop that origin!

This is truely one of the best story arcs of the 4th incarnation of the Doctor, as played by fan-favorite, Tom Baker (currently narrator on the successful ""Little Brittain"" series).

This gritty and sometimes extremely dark story is one I and many fans have been waiting on for DVD release. The Doctor questions his own morality, wrestling with the decision to wipe out the Daleks like some terrible disease: To destroy an intelligent life form, wiping out a race, would 'he' be any better than the Daleks.

One short-coming is the price of BBC 2-disc sets is high and the special-bonus material is usually less-than special.",1142640000,33,1224,4.786729857819905
2522673,5,B000EMG918,"Featuring Tom Baker, the most popular actor to play Dr. Who, this adventure wherein he meets the twisted, megalomaniacal creator of the Daleks, Davros, is essential viewing material for all Dr. Who fans. Dr. Who's mission in this episode is to go to Skaro and prevent the Daleks from evolving and reuniting with their creator. It's easy to see where the Daleks get their thirst for conquest after their creator, Davros, is introduced.

This is a terrific episode full of fun and entertaining performances, makeup, and sets. Dr. Who's companion in this episode is the cute-as-a-button-but-ever-so-slightly-whiny Sarah Jane, well played by Elisabeth Sladen. ""Exterminate! Exterminate!""",1141603200,4,683,5.504761904761905
2522674,5,B000EMG918,"This is one of the greats of the Tom Baker era. It features the only really good (and the first) appearence of Davros, mad creator of the Daleks.

It is moody, atmospheric, suspensful, tragic, really all the best things that Dr. Who does.  The costumes recall Nazi uniforms quite effectively. One really believes we are seeing the bunker days of a facist regime.  I always thought the Daleks were so one-dimensional, but Davros and his thirst for power, his almost pornographic obsession with it are really quite effective. The scene where the Doctor asks Davros if, if he had created a virus that would wipe out all life, would he use it is quite chillingly played. Davros is able to alter his speech and mood from the same shrill ranting of his creations to a reasonably lucid being. This idea of a warped human, mostly but not entirely evil, creating something of pure evil is much more interesting than the mere cry of ""Exterminate!"" that we all know and, er, love?

This episode also includes one of the most abrupt (and cheating) cliffhangers when Sarah falls from a rocket scaffold to her obvious demise only to be stopped by something in the next episode that you didn't see in the previous. (I, for one, was hoping she would splat -- I know I'm awful, but Sarah always bugged me).

I know this is months from release, so I can't say a thing about the transfer quality or the extra features, but this is one of the best episodes of this long-running series.",1141257600,6,1465,4.576335877862595

2522692,5,B000EMG918,"In 2014, I made a goal for myself...to watch all 50 years of Doctor Who; every available serial, episode, movie, and special...and I gave myself one year to do it. It took eight months, but I eventually achieved my goal, and just in time for the 50th anniversary special. I then decided to buy/own my absolute favorite serials/episodes from each Doctor, and this was one of them.

The Fourth Doctor and his companions, Sarah Jane Smith and Harry, are summoned to the Daleks' home planet of Skaros before their rise to power. Hoping to prevent the dominating beings from developing their warlike behavior, the gang soon finds themselves in the middle of a war between two races, the Kaleds and the Thals, and uncover a plot by a Kaled scientist, Davros, to render his people invincible as the metal-encased Daleks. Will the Tardis team be able to stop Davros? And given the chance, will the Doctor stoop to committing mass genocide and destroy his enemies before they're even born?

There's a reason this serial is considered one of the greatest stories of Doctor Who's long run. It not only fleshes out the back story of the megalomaniacal, robotic Daleks, but also presents a thoughtful storyline with elements that remain topical, even today, like cultures locked in an endless war, and genetic experimentation.  Add to that the chilling villain and mad scientist, Davros, who manipulates both his enemies AND his own subordinates like a master chess player; stopping at nothing to take over the galaxy, and letting nothing stand in his way (phyisically, he even LOOKS like a chess piece). Two of the best moments of the show are contained in this story; the first being when the Doctor and Davros have a little ""chat"" about the fate of the universe, and what they would do if they had the power to destroy everything. Davros' insane speech just builds and builds, and it's nothing short of memorable.

The other comes when the Doctor is about to blow up the room where the Daleks are being created, and with the simple act of touching two wires together, he's left with an insanely difficult choice....if he kills the Daleks now, he'll be ridding the galaxy of a great evil forever...however, many planets put aside their differences and came together only because of the united threat of the Daleks. And even more importantly, for how evil the Daleks are, they ARE still an intellegent race, and taking this rare chance would mean committing mass genocide.  Does he, or anyone else, have the right to do that?  It's a heavy question with no clear answers.  (You know this scene is famous when it becomes the cover art for the DVD.)

As for Sarah Jane and Harry, they're good as always, although argueably, they're not really given much to do this time around, and personally, this story could've easily been trimmed down to four parts instead of six.  But for how good the stuff with Davros and the Daleks are, I can forgive this; I'm probably just nitpicking at this point.  The DVD picture quality is excellent, and there's a ton of cool special features to check out, including behind the scenes of the making of the serial, and episode commentaries from the actors themselves.

If you're a fan of classic Who, or just Doctor Who, period, then you NEED to give this serial a watch. It gives us a ton of backstory on the Doctor's deadliest, most famous enemies, while also giving an important commentary on the consequences of having to make life changing decisions.",1430092800,3,3472,4.77
2522693,4,B000EMG918,"The Doctor has faced many monstrous opponents through his many years, and many lives, but few have been as iconic as the Daleks.

2522712,5,B000EMG918,"Genesis of the daleks, yes a complete classic but I will explain that this story has some bad parts. This story is very comedic in some parts like when the guard asks the doctor to empty his pockets and he keeps pulling junk out of his pockets and seeing the expressions on the guards faces watching , all the scenes were perfected for Tom Bakers 4th episode he rocks it.
In the first couple episodes like the ark in space and later on revenge of the cybermen it has more been the doctor and Sarah but in this episode the first 3 to 4 parts it is just the doctor and harry while Sarah is wandering about skaro avoiding mewtoes or however you spell it , like I said not all scenes were perfect like when harry is bitten on the leg by a giant clam after hitting it with a stalagtite hit slides away i'm sorry but correct me if i'm wrong but clams do not move that way and in this story the thals are more ruthless then in planet of the daleks and at the end of part 4 or 5 the doctor is looking in davros's testing lab and a string of kaled flesh wraps around his neck and tries to strangle him and at the end of part 2 when Sarah and the mewtoes  are climbing the outside the rocket and the thals shooting at them (They might be thals) and during this Sarah is climbing a huge rocket in yes high heels and when she gets to the top she has to jump a 3 foot gap and she is afraid to.
But the characters play their roles like pros and Michael wisher who plays davros is great though I did not like the daleks killing him and somehow coming back in destiny of the daleks covered in cobwebs.
""Do I have the right if, I murder a hole intelligent race then I will become like them the daleks"" This line is the best line in Doctor Who history if you ask me it shows that the most evil thing in the universe must bring something good.

But overall it was a 10/10 or 5/5 on amazon",1416009600,,1869,4.008042895442359

2522732,5,B000EMG918,"This origin story for the Daleks is an extremely well done Doctor Who story. It's that rare six part story that doesn't feel at all padded. It has great cliffhangers at the end of every episode. And in Davros, you're given a villain who is has the malevolent evil  of Hitler while also possessing the genius of Stephen Hawking, with a bit of Machiavelli thrown in for good measure.

Whether it's the greatest Doctor Who story of all time is a matter of debate. The seminal moment where the Doctor makes the decision of whether to wipe out the Daleks by blowing up the incubator seems to be an overblown moment as there were are already several Daleks activated and as the Doctor admitted later, the destruction of the incubator would only slow them down. But perhaps the character point is what matters for the Doctor and how that contrasts him with Davros.

A good story is open to some interpretation as to what the point of it is and to me what stands out is the inability of characters to understand the true evil nature of Davros. The Kaled High Council, the Thals, and disgruntled scientists under Davros are all played by Davros who takes advantages of due processes and bureaucracy and their belief that he's a reasonable person and uses it to his full advantage. Even the Doctor tries to reason with him and is taken in by Davros' last gambit with the dissident scientists.

Overall, this is a great story that is a must for every fan of Doctor Who for what it tells us about the Doctor's most iconic enemy.",1403740800,,1516,4.521897810218978

What I really liked about this narrative was the introduction of the Daleks' creator Davros, played by enigmatic Michael Wisher, who had an exceptional visual design. The script was further enhanced by Philip Hinchcliffe and Robert Holmes, who made the tweaks that changed the original script and made the story that much darker. Terry Nation, the original creator of the Daleks, had intentionally modelled them on the Nazis, which was further explored as the frame work theme in Genesis. The story also throws up the moral issues that come with fiddling with history through time travel and the concept of genocide. As ever the filming was done on location in a quarry.",1385424000,,763,4.922480620155039

The special effects being the late 1970s are a bit dated but still serve their purpose well even now because of the actors. What I liked most about this episode was that it truly was an example of what the Classic version of Doctor was all about; namely solid science fiction writing brought to life by a talented cast of actors.

GENESIS OF THE DALEKS
Story # 78
Season 12's Fourth Story
Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker Era, First Season 1974
Ninth Classic Sarah Jane Smith Story

OVERALL RATING 10/10
Consistently rated either at or near the top of ""All-time-greatest WHO stories"" since first broadcast, GENESIS OF THE DALEKS was most recently rated at #3 on the 2009 Doctor Who Magazine #413  ""Mighty 200"" list, behind CAVES OF ANDROZONI and BLINK.  Watching GENESIS OF THE DALEKS again for the ""umpteenth"" time in preparation for this March 2013 review, confirms that the story's punch remains just as powerful as with the first personal viewing back in the 1970's.  Production-wise, visuals, story and acting have little to date them to the specific time of actual 1975 production, a major reason GENESIS OF THE DALEKS still plays so well for a 2013 audience.

On a story-by-story consideration, GENESIS OF THE DALEKS may actually be the best story of the top three on the ""Mighty 200"" list. The main problem with GENESIS OF THE DALEKS as a story in the ""Whoniverse"" and likewise, a problem of Season 12 itself, is that some important ""Doctor Who"" elements are barely seen.  The entire six-story-arc of Season 12 production, has the TARDIS appearing for only a few seconds of screen time, and the TARDIS interior is never seen at all.  The ommission of the TARDIS and its significance in Doctor Who for most of Season 12 was a bit problematic.  For example, American audiences, who were introduced to Doctor Who by Seasons 12,13 & 14, did not even know what the TARDIS interior looked like for six full stories, until PLANET OF EVIL in Season 13!

The 6-story-arc that comprised Doctor Who Season 12 production, from ROBOT through TERROR OF THE ZYGONS[produced in Season 12, broadcast held to start Season 13], is full of creative, imaginative, and unique ideas, and is one of the ""Crown Jewels"" of Doctor Who story arcs.  While many of the tightly-paced stories within the 6-story-arc may be individually criticized for lacking important elements critical to Doctor Who, when each story is viewed as a chapter of the entire story arc, it is no wonder that Season 12 is considered a major element of the WHO ""Golden Age"".

""Favorite era"" in WHO will rest in the opinion of each viewer.  But it is telling when a six-story-arc from Season 12/13, 38 years ago, places three-of-six stories in the top 28 of the ""Mighty 200"" list, rivaling modern stories much fresher in the memory!  Stories from 38 years ago still resonating powerfully in the memory to rival more recent productions is reason enough to recommend all of Season 12 production, from ROBOT through TERROR OF THE ZYGONS, as essential viewing for veteran Whovians, and SARAH JANE ADVENTURES fans.  The main reason to watch all stories of Season 12 production however, is because this is Doctor Who in one of its finest eras, made by a top-notch production and acting team. A team that ""pushed the envelope"" very far.

STORY & SCRIPT 10/10
This is Terry Nation's finest Dalek script. The script was commissioned by Barry Letts and Terrence Dicks, and Terry Nation was guided by Barry Letts' suggestion that he write a story about the ""genesis of the daleks"". The new production team of Philip Hinchcliffe and Robert Holmes, whose intent was to attract more adults to the Doctor Who audience, tweaked the already-serious script even more toward gritty, realistic drama to attract the desired adult audience.

GENESIS OF THE DALEKS is not dated at all and plays very well for modern viewers.  Again noting the fact that the story still rates third among the top WHO stories of all time on the 2009 ""Mighty 200"", 38 years after original production, speaks more of script/production quality than volumes of printed praise.  GENESIS OF THE DALEKS seems genuinely timeless, a ""story for the ages"".

ACTING 10/10
Carefully watching this story many times over the years, has never revealed a weak performance anywhere, even in the smallest roles. Every actor seems to take their role and the story very seriously.  And, many of the roles go beyond flawless to mind-searing memorable.

Michael Wishers's ""Davros"", is well beyond superb.  Acting inside a rubber mask and glove, Wisher uses voice intonation and subtle understated movement to create a horrific madman who brings the most inhuman Adolf-Hitler-like-characteristics chillingly to life onscreen.

Peter Miles almost steals the show as the Himmler-like right-hand-man for Davros, ""Nyder"".  Nyder is a moral chameleon who will not stop at anything in advancing the mad plans of Davros.  Peter Miles does an incredible acting job in giving the mad-vision-driven, ruthless ""Nyder"" an oily thin veneer of civility.  Only a performence as incredible as Wisher's ""Davros"" could possibly overshadow the almost equally heartless, inhuman ""Nyder"" of Peter Miles.  The chilling ""one-two-punch"" of Davros-Nyder onscreen gives GENESIS OF THE DALEKS much of its timeless power.

Other standout performances to watch for are Dennis Chinnery(Gharman), Guy Siner(Ravon), Stephen Yardley(Sevrin), James Garbutt(Ronson), and Harriet Philpin(Bettan).

The three regular cast members work together with natural, effortless ease in GENESIS OF THE DALEKS, the same as in every other Season 12 production story.  The story quickly splits up the regulars into the Doctor and Harry together, and Sarah Jane off on her own.  This gives the viewers another chance to see how superbly Tom Baker and Ian Marter work together. Meanwhile, Elisabeth Sladen's solid ""Sarah Jane"" separated from the Doctor and Harry, and left to fend on her own, quickly reacts like the same Sarah Jane of TIME WARRIOR, as she rapidly integrates herself with the locals, and is soon influencing and even leading them in a gutsy break out attempt. Ultimately a failure, the attempted breakout still manages to disrupt and delay progress. Reunited, Sarah, Harry and the Fourth Doctor demonstrate the charming, effortless rapport and smooth teamwork that many Whovians, familiar with both the Classic and New Series, still consider as one of the finest-ever TARDIS Trio teams.

PRODUCTION QUALITY 10/10
The atmosphere of this story is incredible, and the viewer cannot resist being pulled into the war-ravaged world of Skaro. From the mesmerizing World-War-One-like opening scenes, to Duncan Brown's superbly lit bunker scenes, GENESIS OF THE DALEKS is a production masterpiece.  Every scene in every location is filmed and lit precisely right to set the perfect atmosphere to grab the viewer.  It is difficult to visualize any way GENESIS OF THE DALEKS could be improved, even with modern production methods. Indeed, one fears a modern remake would hurt a story so well done with 1974 production methods. Even special effects are practically flawless, with a notable exception detailed in SPECIAL EFFECTS later.

SPECIAL EFFECTS 9/10
Practically flawless, across the board with no really weak points to be noted anywhere, EXCEPT for the giant clams, which force one point off because the effect is closer to funny than scary in those scenes.  If there is a weak point in GENESIS OF THE DALEKS, those scenes involving these giant clams are it! Even then, so perfectly delivered is the ""I'll never eat oysters again!"", by Elisabeth Sladen, that the ""giant clams"" are forgiven.

STORY IMPORTANCE 10/10
Consistently rated from first broadcast in 1975 as one of the top WHO stories ever made. Firmly established as a story of fundamental importance in the ""Whoniverse"", GENESIS OF THE DALEKS marks the absolute beginnings of one of WHO's oldest and most enduring enemies, the Daleks, and introduces their creator Davros, who goes on to become one of the greatest villians in WHO history. Those who consider themselves genuine ""Whovians"", simply must see this story, even if only familiar with the New Series up to now.  Also essential viewing for SARAH JANE ADVENTURES fans, who will be astonished to see how the Sarah Jane of GENESIS... is exactly the same Sarah Jane of SJA. She may be younger and realistically full of the brash confidence that naive youthfullness gives, but she rings totally true as ""Sarah Jane"".  Yes, GENESIS OF THE DALEKS is at minimum, a ""10/10 PLUS"" in story importance in the ""Whoniverse"".

DVD EXTRAS 10/10
Commentary by Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Peter Miles and director David Maloney is unmoderated, but absolutely superb and a joy to listen to. The text commentary by Richard Molesworth is likewise superb. Both commentaries add such delightful depth and background to this important story that each is a ""must"" after initally watching the story as broadcast.

The documentary, ""Genesis of a Classic"", like the audio and text commentary, adds too much depth and background to this important story to miss.  Participants, are in order of appearance, Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks, David Maloney, Philip Hinchcliffe, Elisabeth Sladen, Dick Mills, Tom Baker, Roy Skeltonn, Duncan Brown, Sylvia James, Guy Siner, James Garbutt, Peter Miles, Dennis Chinnery and Peter Day.  Sadly, many of these participants have passed away, making this documentary quite a treasure. Keep it running past the credits for a cute, if somewhat touchy moment from Elisabeth Sladen!",1363046400,,9380,5.102614379084967
2522799,5,B000EMG918,"Tom Baker is the best Doctor and this story shows why. He is so good in this story with all of it's plot developments that it is a wonder that the story holds together so well. If you are a fan of the new Doctors I recommend you get this one and see why us old fans still relish the Doctors before R.Davis and take a look at this episode in particular.

This was to be a Christmas gift and fortunately, I found a copy locally.

In short, DO buy Tom Baker DVDs. Do NOT waste your money and faith on faster shipping. Had I gone with standard shipping, I'd probably have had the item in a shorter time than it took to be told that the item wasn't deliverable.

2522816,5,B000EMG918,"I got hooked on Dr. Who from Tom Baker. This was one of the best of the Dr. Who stories. It was in Tom Baker's 1st season. It has the late great Liz Sladen as Sara Jane Smith and who could forget Harry Sullivan. As you watched it you can see how this story was inspired by Englands war with Hitler, with Daveros representing Hitler and his various henchmen representing Hitler's henchmen. To me the Daleks represented the SS, a merciless instrument of terror and death that walked the earth lacking any compassion, mercy or remorse, simply put they were killing machines. This story tells how it all began, how the Doctor's most feared enemy originated. Like I said, this is a must own for any Dr. Who fan.",1353715200,,706,4.48062015503876
2522817,5,B000EMG918,"The Doctor is summoned against his will to the planet Sharo by a typically arrogant Time Lord, who explains his mission (whether he wants it or not) is to thwart the creation of the Time Lords&apos; oldest enemies, the Daleks. And then the guy just dumps him and his two companions - Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan - off and leaves, apparently expecting them to figure out how to do it all on their own. What a jerk.

Skaro is a war-torn planet. The two dominant civilizations, the Thals and the Kaleds, have been fighting each other for centuries, to the point where they aren&apos;t even aware that there is even any other life in the universe except on Skaro. During a commando raid by some Thal soldiers, Sarah gets knocked out. The Kaleds ""rescue"" the Doctor and Harry, killing the attacking Thals and taking them prisoner. Sarah is assumed dead and left outside, where she is helped by a friendly vagabond named Sevrin before the two get caught by a Thal patrol.

The fascist Kaleds introduce the Doctor and Harry to their greatest scientist, Davros, an ancient, ugly man confined to a motorized wheelchair, who unveils his latest scheme to wipe out the Thals: mutant creatures inside of armored battle vehicles designed after his own conveyance. The Daleks! The Doctor&apos;s warnings about them fall on deaf ears. Davros is only concerned with seeing his Daleks come to fruition to wipe out the Thals as soon as possible, and when some of the Kaled leaders begin listening to the Doctor, Davros conspires with his assistant Nyder to wipe them out so their Daleks can reign supreme.

Meanwhile, we learn that the Thals are little better than their enemies, as Sarah Jane, Sevrin and other prisoners are being used as slave labor to construct a powerful rocket to destroy the Kaled city with: the Thals&apos; answer to the Daleks. Sarah Jane and the others begin making plans to escape so she can find the Doctor. But will she succeed? Can the Doctor prevent these two warmongering civilizations from annihilating each other and convince everyone of the evil the Daleks will unleash upon the universe?

One of the darker and more depressing Doctor Who tales, with many a nail-biting moment. More than once we see the usually triumphant at very low points. Time and again he fails to ensure that the Daleks don&apos;t get created, and his efforts to bring the Thals and Kaleds together are met with hostile resistance to the idea. He almost literally finds himself in an unwinnable situation, and it takes the Daleks (of course) turning on their masters and deciding to kill both the Thals and the Kaleds to get anything done. A very tense and riveting if at times slow-moving story, one of Doctor Who&apos;s best.",1328832000,3,2724,4.777070063694268
2522818,5,B000EMG918,"""Genesis of the Daleks"" is a Doctor who story from 1975; which is considered by many to be the greatest of the classic ""Who"" stories.

2522819,5,B000EMG918,"The Daleks may have been the most popular nemesis Doctor Who ever faced, but efforts to revive them after their popularity peaked in the mid-1960s largely fell flat--until this classic story featuring the Fourth Doctor came along in 1975.

Public mania for the Daleks had forced the BBC and their creator, Terry Nation, to churn out story after story (and toys and books and movies) featuring the robotic menace from the planet Skaro, but the backstory of how the Daleks came to be was sketchy and often inconsistent based on bits of dialogue included here and there in the dozens of episodes produced up to the advent of the Fourth Doctor. ""Genesis,"" for the first time, gave viewers the definitive story of the Daleks' creation and introduced their creator, Davros, a megalomaniacal genius who would become a recurring villain in the series.

In the first of the story's sprawling six episodes, the Doctor is summoned by the Time Lords to a rocky, smoky planet where one of them offers the Doctor the chance to alter history by modifying the Daleks at their creation or, failing that, by wiping them out completely. The Doctor accepts and is told he's already on the Daleks' wartorn home planet of Skaro. This is a gritty world, ravaged by radiation and inhabited underground in dimly lit passageways, where the Daleks' progenitor race, the Kaleds, wear all black, and their rivals, the Thals, have not yet become the enlightened, all-blond race seen in earlier stories.

Curiously for a story that strives to say something new about one of the Doctor's oldest foes, ""Genesis"" recycles everything--prop weapons from past stories like ""Galaxy Four,"" a rocket ship from ""Ambassadors of Death,"" the back plate of an Ice Warrior to create a lizard creature guarding the ventilation outlets of the Kaleds' underground base. The supporting cast is well chosen: Michael Wisher essentially defined Davros' character from the floor up in this story, and Peter Miles and Dennis Chinnery turn in solid performances as Nyder and Gharman, two Kaleds who represent, respectively, the darker and brighter impulses of their people.

One other small but important point: the laser effects used in ""Genesis"" showed, for the first time, beams of light emitting from the Daleks' guns and striking their targets before the customary ""negative"" flash that comes before an actor keels over dead. It makes one wonder why the show continued to have such haphazard, unconvincing laser effects in later stories like ""The Invisible Enemy.""

The second disc is packed with Special Features, including two hourlong documentaries that tell the story of the making of ""Genesis"" and trace the history of the Daleks from their debut in 1963 to their final appearance in the original series in 1988.",1313798400,,2766,5.043763676148797
2522820,5,B000EMG918,"Tom Baker is often cited as one of the best, and most memorable, actors to play the Doctor and this story is a perfect example. A story that ties into integrally into the central mythos, revealing the origin of one of the Doctor's most feared enemies, and introducing their demented creator.

2522824,5,B000EMG918,"This has to be one of my favorite Doctor Who stories of all time and it was one of my first introductions to Doctor Who. I stumbled upon Doctor Who one saturday night flipping through the channels (all 5 of them)  when I was 9 or 10 years old. Genesis of the Daleks was one of those first few episodes that I saw and it was the one that stuck in my memory the most. I remember Davros and the Daleks just being all out creepy especially their voices. I actually saw the episode quite a number of years after it had originally aired. PBS used to show full-length stories rather than episode parts so I watched Doctor Who like it was a TV movie 90-120 minutes long.

Genesis of the Daleks has the Doctor and his two companions, Sarah Jane and Harry Sullivan, taken to the planet Skaro by meddling Time Lords in order to stop the creation of Doctor Who's and the Universe's greatest adversary, the Daleks.  The Doctor is faced with the moral dilemma of becoming as bad as the Daleks in his task to annihilate them before they are created.

What is so amazing about this story is that by the time this story aired, the Daleks had already appeared in numerous episodes before. All three previous doctors had tangled with the Daleks in one way or another. They were well-established villains on Doctor Who and when you have such popular icons, doing an origins story 10 years after their first appearance can be a bold risky move. You run the risk of annoying and alienating fans who might not be pleased with their favorite characters' origins preferring mystery to knowing. That's how I felt with the Star Wars prequels. I'd rather have my own imagination of what the clone wars were and Darth Vader's fall to the Dark Side than what I got in the prequels.

Genesis avoids the pitfalls that the Star Wars prequels later fell into and gives a fine story. Meeting the meglo-maniac creator of the Daleks was a boon to the series and not a let down.

In short, if you love the Daleks, you'll love Genesis. Tom Baker is at his finest in this episode ranging from witty to serious. His two companions, Sarah and Harry, in my opinion are some of the best companions to have ever entered the Tardis. The three characters had good chemistry between them. It's a shame that the studios decided to ax Harry's character a few episodes later.",1264636800,,2324,4.46933962264151

2522843,5,B000EMG918,"This was the first Doctor Who serial/episode/feature I ever saw.  I really didn't know what to expect, but the local PBS station (WTTW in Chicago) used to have a British night when they would show Monty Python, Dave Allen, and Doctor Who for 2 1/2 hours on Sunday night.  So I watched this.  Even though I didn't really understand everything, I found it fascinating.  I was hooked, and have been a Doctor Who fan ever since.

This is probably not the greatest place to start on Doctor Who.  This episode requires you know a little about the series before it starts.  The TARDIS isn't in this one. for example.  The Doctor and his companions are intercepted by a transmat beam by the Time Lords.  They send the Doctor, Sarah, and Harry back to Skaro, the home of the Daleks.  There is a civil war between the Thaals and the Kaleds that has raged for a 1000 years.  The Doctor is assigned to alter the genetic development (or kill) the Dalek race, because they have become far too powerful in the universe and the Time Lords are concerned about this (even though the Time Lords are supposed to be ""neutral"" in these matters).

While this episode's special effects are questionable (they always were in the early years of Doctor Who), the writing and acting is exemplary.  It's an intelligent, thoughtful, and fascinating episode that really gets better when you learn more about the Daleks and Doctor Who folklore.  It's one of Tom Baker's best episodes (only his fourth), and one of the better Dalek adventures, far superior to Baker's later (and somewhat boring) Destiny of the Daleks.

I find that I like the older Doctor Whos better than the recent series.  David Tennant (the current Doctor) is excellent, but too often the series is given over to special effects instead of people.  The writing isn't as sharp, and the series seems a bit hollow.  Regardless, this is one of Baker's best ones, and a must for any Doctor Who fan.",1215907200,,1931,4.646017699115045
2522844,4,B000EMG918,"I discovered Dr. Who back in the 80's and loved it.  When it came on again, I called my kids into the room and asked them to watch it.  Much to my amazement they loved it too.  There is something timeless about this show, even with its cheesy special effects, corny dialogue and plot holes you could drive a truck through.

Genesis of the Daleks is well acted-Baker and company do a great job.  Davros and company are engaging villians.  The running back and forth between domes and such.  The main flaw is that, in the end, the authors cop out.  Dr. Who has had no trouble meddling with the Sontarans and killing one of them to prevent a war between them and the humans, so why not wipe out the Daleks too (except that to do so would change the series.)  This isn't the moral equivalent of killing Hitler as a child, but killing him as he's getting ready to annex Austria or invade the Sudatenland.  The Daleks have already wiped out two civilizations at the end of this episode.  I freely grant that for plot purposes Dr. Who could not wipe out the Daleks, but his reasoning at the end is feeble and vapid.",1215561600,,1108,4.330097087378641
2522855,5,B000EMG918,Great Dr Who Classic. The origin of the daleks and Davros is a must see - and a must see again!!!,1202515200,,97,3.6666666666666665
2522856,5,B000EMG918,"Genesis Of The Daleks is, in my opinion the best Doctor Who story produced to date.  The story is the fourth to feature to Tom Baker as the Doctor, meaning he was still at the height of his abilities as the Doctor. Add to that Terry Nation's amazing script, an excellent supporting cast, and above-the-average Doctor Who production values and one finds a classic piece of Doctor Who.

The serial finds the Doctor and companions Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan sent by the Time Lords (the race of whom the Doctor is a member) to Skaro towards the end of the Thal-Kaled war on a mission to p[revent the creation of the Daleks. Along the way they meet Thals, Kaleds, mutants, the nefarious Nyder (played to perfection by Peter Miles) and the creator of the Daleks, the crippled scientist Davros (Michael Wisher, who was best known for supplying Dalek voices during the Pertwee era).  As they carry out their mission, each of the characters sees the horrors and futility not just of war, but of eugenics, genetic experiments, and what happens when you play God.  Needless to say, this is heavy stuff for a show that was in the eyes of many ""just a children's show"".  This story is an eerie, tense, and thought provoking one in the style the show was going at the time. Yes there are polystyrene monsters (only a couple in a cave) but outside of those there isn't anything to complain about in production values from the Nazi-like costumes of the Kaleds to the amazing Davros make-up to the bunkers where so much of the story takes place.  Then there is the Daleks. The show;s longest running and most-popular villains, they had some uninspired usage during the Pertwee era and they have there revenge here. For anyone trying to understand why the Daleks are so popular and evil, watch the last five minutes or so of the last episode because who'll understand why. So as I wrote above, the best Doctor Who story produced to date.

The special features are a real treat. Of special interest are the two documentaries on the second disc. The first, Genesis Of A Classic details the behind the scenes story of the story's making through interviews with surviving participants  and rare production stills and drawings. The other documentary is a real treat for fans: The Dalek tapes. This hour long documentary is a fascinating look at the Daleks, from creation to their various appearances and evolutions during the run of the classic series. Other feature include the continuity commercials from various broadcasts of the story, Blue Peter showing off Doctor Who models made by a fan,  an excellent  commentary for both audio (featuring Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Peter Miles, and director David Maloney) and a text one on the production.

Now for the ultimate question: is this worth your money? Considering this story is two and a half hours long (longer then some major movies) with a second disc full of bonus features, I would say yes.  Why is it worth it? Because Genesis Of The Daleks is a morality story wrapped up in a nice science fiction wrapping paper with a bow on top.  And also, because they just don't make it like they used to.",1200528000,4,3143,4.703096539162113
2522857,5,B000EMG918,"Genisis takes place long before Hartnel's initial Dalek story and of course also takes place before Invasion Earth 2064.  Keep this in mind while enjoying the story.  It is not totally counterdictary to ""The Daleks"" and you must be forgiving of Dr. Who that is notorious for this neglect of reference in most stories anyway.  Hartnel's Doc #1 refers in ""Invasion""  That is, his first Skaro visit was ""millions of years in the future.""  Puzzling the Daleks are more advanced in locomotion in 2164 AD than in the first story where they could not leave thier city.  Here the pre-dalek race is referred to as ""Kaled"" yet in the first it is ""Dal"".  That is the only real counterdiction and still yet, maybe the Doctor initially misinterpeted the runes in the sand in the Thal's enclave,(The Daleks 1963).  This is the best story I know in bringing light to a desparately needed backstory to not only Daleks but the Thals as well.  Thals, as any #1 encarnation fan knows, once were very warlike and became passive as result to thier repulsion to the surrounding world. Bettan, a true Thal and her little war band along with the smarter rebel mutos and a hand full of Kaleds like ""Raven"" ""Chief scientis Ronson"" and ""Thane"" not to mention ""Garmon"" supposedly become the first real resistance force of ""Thals"".  Mutos not being ""pure"" yet what ""Thal"" is after the war?  Kaleds are more advanced than Thals(yet Thals know of rockets) and in this telling Kaleds are ""Nazi"" totallitarians, who obsessively want control over all distircts and results in this war.  The wheapons of the first war resulted in the bunker which appeared in ruin in ""Destiny of the Daleks"" , and it's ""scientific"" research via Davros, creation of the Daleks and a team of scientists to research for purpose only to survive and in self defense, not to control.  Yet this turned into a power struggle between the Thals and ""wheapons of mass distruction""(Daleks) were in demand as the new goal of this organized Kaled city and Davros.  Mutos resulted from failed experiments of the past and thus the tale is very well thought out.  Thier is no better story or screenplay than this in Doctor Who!  Now the real mystery would be ""Genisis of Davros"".  How/why is he a mutant himself and how did he become so through a birth accident via the first chem war or of a circumstancial accident?  Being a ""Kaled"" mutant, he hates ""mutos"" himself.",1200009600,,2399,4.712230215827338
2522858,3,B000EMG918,"Never having seen the early Dr. Whos, I bought the three early ones just to see how they compared with the current one. I did not like Hartnell as Dr. Who, but Tom Baker is a much more sympathetic character, and a bit more ""off the wall"", as I expect Dr. Who to be.",1196121600,,265,3.925925925925926
2522859,5,B000EMG918,"This story is one of the classics, written by Terry Nation (who created the Daleks in 1963), and well-acted by the whole cast. Although Davros is always remembered I thought Peter Miles as Nyder was a particularly evil looking baddie. You realise watching this that Terry Nation was clearly influenced by the Nazis - just listen to Davros's voice. Another reason this is a classic is because of the moral dilemma that the Doctor faces at the end. Spell-binding stuff.

This series is from early in Tom Bakers reign as the Doctor, but he had already made the role his own. In fact Tom Baker was so good as the Doctor that the series went into decline as soon as he left, because nobody could match the charisma that he brought to the part. Only a 16 year break from the screen and the introduction of the Christopher Eccelston brought the Time Lord back to its former glory.

The extras are very good. The commentary is well worth listening to. Tom Baker is as eccentric and witty as you'd expect. Heres his opening line:
""Hello, my name is Tom Baker, I don't know why that should be, but there you are"".

All round its a marvellous series and a well put together package.",1194393600,2,1171,4.488262910798122

2522863,5,B000EMG918,"It's hard for me to make up a list of the best ""Doctor Who"" episodes. Well, let me restate that. I can make a list from here to Ravalox and back, but it's hard to put them into any order. It's a list the contains things like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Talons-of-Weng-Chiang/dp/B0000AGQ27/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Talons of Weng-Chiang</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Tomb-of-the-Cybermen/dp/B000067FPD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Tomb of the Cybermen</a>, and, of course, ""Genesis of the Daleks"". I'm not sure if it's the best story (what's your favorite? Comment!), but it's definately the best Dalek story.

The story opens with our heroes trying to return to Earth after one of their most recent adventures. They get, essentially, pulled over by the Time Lords. One of them, dressed, for some odd reason, rather like Tim the Enchanter, explains to the Doctor that he's on Skaro and must prevent the construction of the Daleks.

Now this opens up a great many interesting doors, including such things as the grandfather paradox. A lot of them don't get opened, but some do, such as the Doctor questioning the morality of destroying the Daleks. He sites the evil that they do, but also explains that by forcing various species to work together against them they also cause good (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Omens-The-Nice-and-Accurate-Prophecies-of-Agnes-Nutter-Witch/dp/0060853980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch</a>&nbsp;it's observed that evil sows the seeds of its own destruction. This is a great example).

The story is also notable for the introduction of Davros. Ah, Davros. For some reason, despite the Daleks appearing every-other episode of the new series, he hasn't shown up yet. Probably only a matter of time, as it were.

Both the story and the acting are of quite high caliber here. Tom Baker, who hadn't been the Doctor for long, does an excellent job of developing out the chracter he'd play for seven years. The various supporting roles, especially the Kaleds, are also very well-done.

As is usual with the ""Doctor Who"" DVD releases there's a wealth of extra materiel. Especially of note is the entertaining commentary. I couldn't help but laugh when there's a shot on the screen of a man wearing a gas mask and Elisabeth Sladen says, ""Mummy!"" (if you don't get it, watch the new series. Most of it's... well, adequete).

Any ""Doctor Who"" DVD collection simply must feature this story. If you don't have it, get it.

(as a side note, years ago I, in what I can only guess was a sleep deprived state while attending Norwescon, began to shout out randomly, ""We- are- Daleks- of- Borg! You- will- be- assimilated! Assimilate! ASSIMILATE!"" Yeah... I'm just that weird)",1181260800,8,2958,5.678733031674208
2522864,4,B000EMG918,This is a great story line except that this story contradicts an earlier story by the first Doctor.  It does set the stage for the eventual war between the Daleks creator and Daleks that decide they don't need him anymore.,1174608000,,222,4.55
2522875,5,B000EMG918,"It's all too easy to say of anything that it's a classic, to the point that the word almost gets cheapened from overuse. But sometimes no other word will really do, and that really does go for ""Genesis of the Daleks"" here, for on the one hand it's very typical and characteristic of the show (especially  as it was in the mid-1970's), while on the other hand it's a bit of a cut above the rest. It features the Doctor's most popular nemesis, but does so in an unusual way that's interesting both if one's been following the show up until this point and if this is the first time one's ever even heard of a Dalek. And it succeeds both as a thrilling science fiction adventure and as an exploration of some fundamentally important issues.

This is also clearly a transitional moment in the show's history, shifting in emphasis somewhat from a kid's show that grown-ups can also enjoy to a grown-up show that kids can enjoy too. A subtle shift, but noticeable. Really we have a dark and bleak storyline with this one, lightened only by the Doctor's ever-reliable oddball eccentricity, Sarah Jane's lovable feistiness, and Harry's doofishness (always putting his foot in it). Otherwise the themes of genocide, eugenics, militarism, fascist totalitarianism, wars of attrition and genetic mutations, forced labor, suspicion and betrayal, megalomania, stark moral dilemmas and such cuteness all add to the somber lighting and the dull ash-grey sets (definitely a ""Death Star"" palette here, folks) to make this a compellingly grim adventure indeed. In some ways the moral dilemma faced by the Doctor at the climax is a variant on the old ""would you kill Hitler when he was an infant?"" conundrum, but it is disturbing enough to him on the spot--and to us, who understand his hesitation and the issues involved but also kind of just wish he'd throw ethics to the wind and nip the Daleks in the bud. Geez. All a little heavy for Saturday afternoon tea time, I'd think. There's a new depth of seriousness here that we hadn't quite seen before in ""Doctor Who.""

It is also an exceedingly imaginative masterstroke to set this storyline back when the Daleks were first invented or evolved or whatever, though it may be easy to overlook just how innovative this was after the fact. Dalek storylines can get a bit repetitive after a while if the writers aren't careful. They invade, they exterminate, and the Doctor stops them. Instead of a retread, though, ""Genesis"" succeeds admirably in breathing new life into the concept, exploring their formation in a compelling manner. And the Dalek's inventor, Davros, is a superb villain, a man of science and reason like the Doctor but who puts that knowledge to very different uses--the contrast between them is depicted wonderfully in one of their key dialogues (script-writing at its best). And Michael Wisher probably deserves an award for bringing Davros to life, convincingly portraying a wide range of different evil emotions and radiating creepy charisma all while immobilized in body (except for a right hand), crammed in a lower-Dalek wheelchair contraption, and encumbered by a well-designed and realistic mask that covered most of his face and blocked his vision. Finally, the final scene between Davros and his new creations, the Daleks, is a beautiful example of good old-fashioned irony, or maybe instant karma--a nice touch that also (for what it's worth) serves cleverly to maintain continuity with the many preceding Dalek stories in the series.

Don't get me wrong. Not everything's perfect. The writers lead the Doctor up to the big moral dilemma only to kind of let him off the hook, only to lead him back to the hook and yet pretty much release him again. This makes for some annoying anticlimax. And a few things stretch one's credulity just a little. And yes, the giant clams look fake. But overall, if I were introducing a friend to this show and wanted to find an exemplary story that exemplifies much of what's great about ""Doctor Who,"" this would likely be one of my choices--though probably I'd want to compliment it with another one a bit more upbeat.",1174521600,5,4108,4.872675250357654

2522877,4,B000EMG918,"THE PLOT: (This 1975 story is part of an excellent arc that began with ""Ark in Space"" and concluded with the next serial ""Revenge of the Cybermen"".)  The Doctor (Baker) and his companions Harry (Marter) and Sarah (Sladden) are intercepted by one of the Doctor's fellow timelords, and brought to the war torn planet of Skaro.  Who fans know that Skaro was the original homeworld of the implacable Daleks - horribly mutated creatures that live inside machines, and exist only to conquer and ex-term-in-ate!!!  Anticipating a future in which the Daleks reign supreme over the universe, the timelords dispatch the Doctor on a desperate mission to Skaro at the point of the Dalek's creation.  Learn as much as possible about them, inhibit their evolution and, if possible, destroy them.

Unfortunately (and as you'd expect for a Who story), The Doctor and his companions become embroiled with the politics of pre-Dalek Skaro: between the two warring humanoid races of the planet - the Kaleds and the Thals, and between factions of the Kaleds, the apparent progenitors of the Daleks.  We also meet Davros, a horribly mutated Kaled scientist and the apparent creator of the Daleks.  With their planet scarred by every known form of weaponry - including chemical, bacteriological and nuclear - there seems no hope in preventing the Kaleds from devolving into globby things that will need to travel inside the machines that will become the Daleks.  However, Davros has a mind and soul to match his scarred body - he also engineers a new form of organic life devoid of conscience or any sense of compassion.  Rather than mutant Kaleds, it is these twisted organisms that will become the dreaded Daleks.  The Doctor struggles against both Thals and Kaleds, while occasionally making use of both.

This was a great episode that lives up to its hype.  Though it loses steam in the latter half - in which the insidious Davros uses every form of trickery he knows to protect his project from doubting Kaleds - it's always riveting in true  ""Who"" tradition.  The planet Skaro - burned by centuries of futile war - is a compelling setting, while Davros makes an engaging new enemy - he's something of a Dalek himself.  In a powerful exchange between Davros and the Doctor, the two debate the meaning of power over life and death and the morality that must come with it (somewhat prefiguring a similar conversation between Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson in ""Schindler"").  Though a kid's story, the dilemma the Doctor faces is very mature - he finds himself empowered to destroy the Daleks before they can threaten the universe - but does he have the right to commit genocide against a then-innocent life-form?

FOR THOSE WHO KNOW NO ""WHO"" - this is one of the stand-out stories that makes a great entry for those knowing little about the show.  ""The Doctor"" is apparently human, but is actually an alien timelord (over 700 years old, two hearts, and the ability to regenerate every time the role needs to be re-cast).  Having a time-spaceship (not seen in this story) the Doctor can travel anywhere in time and space.  Though originally a kid show, this era of ""Who"" coincided with the show's inroads to older American viewers.  Though production values are low, they're more than adequate given the crisp writing which puts the shows light-years ahead of the sedate and sterile thrills of ""Star Trek"" of the late 1980's.  Best of all, the story is a perfect highlight for Tom Baker's dramatic range - his ability to go from a child's whimsy to an adult fury.  Baker was still new to the role (he would hold it for about 7 years) and the producers scheduled this and a Cybermen story (""Revenge"") to get him up to speed.  Toss in Sarah-Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan as prototypical modern-day British who can go anywhere (or time) the Doctor goes, but never seek to understand what they're doing there.  This was strangely the last Dalek story for years, and probably the last really good one for even longer.  If you've only watched the new series, ""Genesis"" may be your strongest argument for getting into the original show as well.",1169078400,6,4114,4.808238636363637

This is by far the best Dalek episode ever made.  I watched this story several times on repeats on PBS as a kid.  The story is essentially about how Davros created the Daleks in his own image.

2522882,5,B000EMG918,"The darkness of this story is looming over all others.  Tom Baker(though quite silly and quirky as usual) is more like his real self and perfect for the role in this one.  From landing as in ""arriving"" late and the Time Lord(evil wizardly type guy) giving Doc a ring and his light-heartedness goes from empting his junky 10-year-old toy pockets and saying ""boy soldiers and very young generals"" to battling with himself(of all people) about killing a race(Xenocide) and seeing Davros go from a ""sit down and talk reasonably"" scientist to a mad megalomanic slayer of madness and distruction.  The Daleks are not much until the last chapter where they realize thier true power and capabilities.  The story revovles around The Director Davros and his minion scientists and soldiers one in particular, Nydar, Played by Peter Miles who is also a comentator on this DVD.  He stands out from other characters with his sharp calasue voice.  I once mistakeningly took him for the voice of Jarl the 1st Cyberman in the Hartnel Episode he sounds exactly the same, but he is not.  He is like Davros in Human form.  Micheal Wisher takes on the role of the mad wizard-science guy himself.  He was also in Carnival Of Monsters to get an idea of his voice acting quality.  Tom Baker(surprisingly) still does these commentaries.  He and Elizebeth Sladen do most if not all of the ones she was in.(He doesn't work with Lalla of course).  Liz is still young enough to put two sentences together co-herently but Tom is and never was able to do this.(must have ADHD).  Think Syd Barret of Pink Floyd as in low functioning yet brilliant.

2522883,5,B000EMG918,"Fans of the original ""Doctor Who"" series know that it was originally planned as a children's show.  It grew into so much more than that over the years.  So much so in fact that it drew fire from a British children's television watchdog group ran by one Mary Whitehouse.  To get a ""Whitehouse"" mention, I guess, became to the producers of ""Doctor Who"" a badge of courage, because they were doing their jobs right.  After all, I don't think the producers, writers, or actors of this fine show believed they were writing for ""children.""  They were writing for everyone.

""Genesis Of The Daleks"" was my favorite serial of them all because it trancended its limited (even for the '70s) production budget and format to become a tale important for everyone because of the themes it raised - the rights of state vs. the rights of individuals, the role of military sponsorship in scientific research, genetic engineering, and the right to kill in order to fulfill a greater good.

Tom Baker will always be my favorite Doctor because he could inject humanity and levity in any situation, thus making the heavy bearable and the most fantastic believable.  This quality is needed more than ever here because the Doctor's fellow Time Lords stick him with a difficult job:  changing the development of, or wiping out completely, the universe's most aggressive beings before they destroy all other life in existance.  To do this, he, and his companions, must take on two warring nations on the planet Skaro.  This is made more difficult by the governments on both sides have been so embroiled in this war that they've been dominated by their respective militaries and they've recently found out that their genetic structures have been unalterably mutated.

A story such as this is already more layered and nuanced than the typical ""sci-fi"" show, but writer Terry Nation piles on  more by making the villain NOT the Daleks but the scarred scientist responsible for their creation, Davros.  It's HE that's engineered the mutants who will become the first pilots of the Dalek travel machines and alters them further by genetically removing the sense of conscienceness essential for all powerful beings to limit their actions.

It's no wonder that parents hated this particular serial because of its thought-provoking story.  It was also VERY violent for its time - although by today's standards, it looks quaint indeed.  But if one gets beyond such things, ""Genesis"" will be revealed to be a very worthy thing to watch for their own entertainment AND for their own thoughts.  The story matter is as timely today as it was back in the '70s, and the acting by everyone, even those travelling in the ""Pepperpots-with-arm-plungers"" Dalek rig or those stuck with heavy makeup, is more in keeping with the best of theater than of a limited-budget ""Kid's Fantasy"" program.  After all, isn't that what the roundheads of network programming thought ""Star Trek"" was?",1153699200,2,2938,4.94704684317719
2522884,5,B000EMG918,"If you love classic Doctor Who, and the Daleks then this is your kind of story.  The story writing is strong with several overtures of apocalyptic war.  This is a marvoulus tell of the Kaled war with the Thall.  This DVD also includes tons of special features of how this story was made and a history of the Daleks!",1152316800,,315,4.305084745762712
2522895,5,B000EMG918,"The Daleks! Two words that genuinely strike fear into British children of a certain age, no matter how old they may be now! The `pepper pot' enemies of the BBC TV's heroic Time Lord - Doctor Who, made their debut in the second story ever broadcast from their long running serial and were so successful that they appeared and again and again in the subsequent 26 year run of the show and indeed made a stunning re-appearance in the new adventures in 2005. This pair of DVD releases from BBC Video celebrates two of their encounters with the Doctor, dating from 1975 and 1985. And they're both classics.

Genesis of the Daleks was the fourth of five stories broadcast in Tom Baker's first season as the fourth Doctor, albeit recorded fifth. It has to be said that by the time the mutant Skarosians met the Gallifreyan in this story, the Daleks seemed to have run out of steam. Their three appearances in the last three seasons starring the third Doctor, Jon Pertwee, were somewhat lackluster and certainly covered a lot of ground previously explored by writer and Dalek creator Terry Nation. Thankfully, when he submitted yet another retread of the Dalek tales, outgoing producer Barry Letts and his script editor Terrance Dicks, tactfully pointed out to Nation that it was all getting a bit tired and that perhaps a story about the Genesis of the Daleks would be more interesting. Nation leapt on the idea and came back with arguably one of the greatest stories in the entire Doctor Who canon. Genesis has been seen on the BBC five times over the years, a record for any Doctor Who story, albeit in two cut down versions on occasions. The full six-part adventure is re-mastered and released on DVD for the first time now in it's episodic format as originally broadcast in the late winter, early spring of 1975. It is almost a faultless story and the execution of the script beyond parallel. Indeed, although a fan of the Letts/Dicks era, I do wonder how it would stand up had they still been in charge when the show was made. It was left to new producer Philip Hinchcliffe and his script editor Robert Holmes to bring the show to the screen and this story goes a long way to proving why they are regarded as the show's most successful production team.

If you are a Doctor Who devotee, there are some niggling continuity problems to worry about in terms of the Dalek history that had been established over the preceding 11 or so years, but Nation has indeed done a great job in reinventing his malevolent creatures without too much disruption to their past storyline. The Daleks themselves play a relatively minor role in the story as the focus is on their evil genius creator Davros and his team of humanoid henchmen. The performance of Michael Wisher as Davros is truly outstanding and one of the finest and most chilling turns ever presented in the series. The regular cast of Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen and Ian Marter are simply superb and the guest cast dazzles. It is rare for everything to come together so perfectly in Doctor Who and Genesis is truly one of the best examples of such an occasion.

Revelation of the Daleks, made and broadcast in 1985 and starring Colin Baker as Doctor number six isn't quite up to the same standard, and will probably suffer in comparison to the earlier story, but when taken in context of Baker's short run as the Time Lord, this really is one of his classic adventures. Made as two 45-minute episodes and broadcast in March 1985 at the end of Baker's first season, alas the story came to air just after it had been announced that the next season had been postponed and the show was going to be off the air for 18 months. The BBC was blaming the overtly violent nature of the show as their reasoning for the cancellation, and this story does indeed highlight many of their concerns. But it is also a very humorous script, albeit darkly so; and again the performances and the production values do go a long way to raising it up in an otherwise mediocre season.

Davros makes a fourth appearance in this story, penned by script editor Eric Saward, this time played by Terry Molloy. Although Molloy turns in a good performance, comparison with the `original' Davros is inevitable and he may disappoint as a result. Colin Baker takes something of a back seat in this story, as do the Daleks themselves, which allows the assembled guest cast the chance to shine and indeed dominate. Clive Swift, Eleanor Bron, William Gaunt, John Ogwen, Hugh Walters and even the incomprehensibly bad Jenny Tomasin, really stand out in this story, with a neat cameo from Alexei Sayle almost stealing the show. Even the minor characters really stand out in this adventure. It's a shame that this story aired when it did. Despite ratings of over 7.5 million viewers (something David Tennant's much hyped Doctor is struggling to achieve), the earlier disappointments of this twenty-second season of the Doctor had rung the death knell loud and clear.

The extras for these two stories are as always superb. The six-part Genesis is contained on one disc, with commentary by Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen (Sarah-Jane), Director David Maloney and guest actor Peter Miles (Nyder). The quartet provide a very, very interesting and entertaining insight into the making of the show as does the accompanying disc featuring two lengthy documentaries. One covers the making of the show from concept to screen; the other is a potted history of the Daleks. There are also continuity announcements, a Blue Peter featurette, Photos and other PDF files accessible on your computer. The only minor (very minor) criticism I have is that the information subtitles that follow the storyline are somewhat repetitive of what features in the documentaries and the commentary and in a lot of cases are on screen so briefly, that hitting the pause button is the only way to read them. For Revelation, the extras include a commentary from Nicola Bryant (the Doctor's companion Peri), Terry Molloy (Davros), Director Graeme Harper and writer/script editor Eric Saward. Molloy is billed as ""Malloy"" on the sleeve. Oops! There's also outtakes and `in studio' footage from the recording, new CGI effects, continuity announcements, photos and soundtrack options. Full credit goes to BBC Video for such interesting and indeed extensive extras. These alone make the purchase worthwhile.

The Dalek stories that remain on the shelves are perhaps the least interesting from their canon, but if the folks at BBC Video can pull together the same quality of extras that they have for these two releases, they will be worth waiting for.",1151193600,2,6614,4.802458296751537

2522897,3,B000EMG918,"Not even the best Dalek story. In fact, I'd have to rate this one near the bottom of Dalek stories.  Only Tom Baker is the saving grace.  It's too long and the ending does not satisfy the viewer.  One point that needs to be made, however.  Before any clueless opponents of capital punishment claim that the Doctor is one of them just because he questions his right to destroy the Daleks, reasoning that in killing them he'd be no better than they are (a mindless fallacy considering that killing a brutal murderer is nothing like killing an innocent victim), it's worth noting that he only comes to this decision after being told by Gharman that the elite scientists have convinced Davros to cease his experiments. When the Doctor realizes that Davros has tricked everyone, he goes right back to the incubator room to finish the job.

Now for my pet peave. Why do the people who produce the DVD insist on loading it with so many extras that they have to make this a double DVD?  It's just an excuse to charge an unreasonable amount.  Most of the extras on DVDs are garbage anyway, not worth the extra money.  Here is an idea, which I'm sure will fall on deaf ears, but nevertheless.  Just give us the story and price these DVDs at $10-$15.  When I buy a Who story, all I care about is the story. I never find worth it the extra junk used to justify driving up the price.  That is why I prefer VHS editions.  Of course the quality of a DVD is much better than that of a cassette. But again, all I really need is the story.",1149638400,10,1521,4.3356890459363955

I was not impressed by what I saw until they ran Genesis of the Daleks during a PBS pledge drive. That was all it took to make me a diehard fan. Other reviewers have gone into detail about why this story is so good so I won't repeat their excellent comments here.

With this release my Top 5 favorite stories are now on DVD. Shame about the price increase though. On the plus side we're getting one of the Tom Baker's best stories and he's even doing a commentary!

I've gotten most all my other Doctor Who dvds from Amazon and they have all been much cheaper.  That includes the other two disk sets.  I was thinking all the other two disk sets were around $24 dollars and the beginning box set is only selling for $34 dollars so what gives?  I also noticed that the other release Revelations of the Daleks is higher than normal as well.  I'm hoping that Amazon has made a mistake on the price on these two releases other wise I'll have to look elsewhere.  I think even Best Buy may be a little cheaper in the long run.

This must be one of the, unfortunately growing, number of DW DVD's stateside that has gone out of print.

If you really want to watch this episode to have in your collection, just purchase The Daleks DVD for the same episodes at a lower price.

8111214,5,B000EMG918,"Third Doctor Tom Baker gets stranded by the Time Lords on Skaro, the home world of the Daleks. A Time Lord is there to explain their plan: they want the Doctor to alter the evolution of the Daleks, to find some weakness in them (yeah, good luck with that!), or to eliminate them. Skaro is at the end of their cataclysmic civil war, when mad scientist Davros created the Daleks so that his race, the Kaleds, would overcome the Thals, the other humanoid race on the planet. Companions Sarah Jane and Harry are also stranded with the Doctor. They find their way to the Kaled scientific base (an underground bunker, naturally) where they confront the Kaled military leaders, scientists, and Davros himself. Davros is in charge and has made a great deal of scientific progress but he's tipping over into the shouty madness of a megalomaniacal mass murderer, a perfect father figure/creator for the Daleks.

While the Daleks are their usual evil selves and Davros is his usual evil scheming self, the other characters have more depth. Many of the Kaled scientists and military have doubts about the Dalek project and are willing to overthrow Davros. As options start vanishing, the Doctor has to confront whether he will destroy the Daleks, essentially committing the sort of genocide that the Daleks themselves are bent on achieving. The show has some interesting moral reflections to go along with the well-paced plot and action. Davros' schemes are interesting and the make-up job is respectable if not perfect. This six-part show is very satisfying and well worth a watch.

Highly recommended.",1491868800,,1591,4.955056179775281
