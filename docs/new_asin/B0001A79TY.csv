8167555,1,B0001A79TY,I knew the item was used when I purchased it. Its  condition was described as very good: it was not illegal in very good condition. It arrived with several scratches which caused the disc to skip in multiple places over multiple episodes.,1504483200,,238,4.666666666666667

8167557,4,B0001A79TY,"Kind of like Mad Magazine for adults.  Lots of black humore and hard-edged satire. British accents too!  I wish more of the ""CV"" episodes were available.",1300579200,,153,4.846153846153846
8167558,5,B0001A79TY,"this show is amazing but the dvd sucks it on ly had 5 episodes.  it says best of but it starts of introducing all the people in the villa, and is contunious like a soap opera.  Itz like a soap opera on acid.  the show is british and aired on channel 4 which also originally aired monty pythons flying circus and triger happy tv.  but this is unlike both those shows this is raunchy with volgarity and nudity troma style.  so still this is worth owning itz amazing and they will probably release another 5 episodes so give it a shot",1109116800,,531,4.217821782178218
