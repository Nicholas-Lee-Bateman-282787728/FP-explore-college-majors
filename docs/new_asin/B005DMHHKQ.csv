4660976,4,B005DMHHKQ,"I'm pretty jazzed for this set.  Ok, I already have most of them on prior sets, but they should look pretty nice in 1080p.  I wonder how they will be framed on widescreen sets?  Also, it does seem that these bluray sets will present the various shorts in a more logical manner (i.e. grouping all the Marvin ones together).  I have always found it an exercise in frustration trying to find a particular cartoon on the six golden collection volumes.",1311811200,7,447,4.55
4660977,5,B005DMHHKQ,"***** - the films
***** - the discs

This review may seem contradictory, this is a five-star set of cartoons presented in a five-star Blu-ray release, and I have to rate this set on those merits. But there are some things not five-star for those of us who have been collecting the Golden Collections on DVD.

O.K, , you are probably saying ""These Looney Tunes Blu-ray titles seem familiar"", that is because just about all of them have been released on the DVD Golden, Oscar, & Superstars Collections. Why? Because when they were restored for those Collections they were restored in Hi-Definition 1080p, so Warner had an easy Blu-ray release here with out spending much money for new film transfers.

This means that unlike the ""Wow"" effect we got when we first saw the Golden Collection DVDs after watching washed out Laserdiscs & VHS tapes, this time we will see the same film transfers with improved restoration in 1080p resolution.  I have seen the Blu-ray presentations of ""Rabbit Hood"" and ""I Love to Singa"" and they look nice, but you will need a rather large HD-TV to notice any kind of improvement over the Golden Collection DVDs.  ""I Love to Singa"" still looks grainy & has negative dust just like the Golden Collection DVDs.

One BIG improvement is with BABY BOTTLENECK, the original film transfer has undergone further restoration work to reduce the grain seen in the older DVD. There is still grain, but it is a big improvement.

Warner did spend some money to make a few new Hi-Def transfers for titles not previously on DVD:

Disc #1
Lovelorn Leghorn  - Foghorn Leghorn - only available previously on VHS

Disc #2
Hasty Hare - Bugs Bunny & Marvin Martian - previously available on the Laserdisc ""Looney Tunes After Dark""
Hare-way To The Stars -  Bugs Bunny & Marvin Martian - previously available on the Laserdisc ""Looney Tunes After Dark""
Bill of Hare - Bugs Bunny & Tasmanian Devil - previously available on the Laserdisc ""Stars of Space Jam""
A Witches Tangled Hare - Bugs Bunny & Witch Hazel - only available previously on VHS.
Feline Frame-up - previously available on the Laserdisc ""Assorted Nuts""

Disc #3 (Presented in STANDARD DEFINITION unless noted)
Marvin Martian in the 3rd Dimension (1996) - non-anamorphic letterboxed small screen presentation.
Father of the Bird - Foghorn Leghorn (1997)
Museum Scream - Tweety & Sylvester (2003) - High Defenition, anamorphic widescreen
And some Chuck Jones productions:
Hell Bent for Election (1944)
Hitch In time (1955) - High defenition
The Door (with Bill Cosby 1968)

It is puzzling, and disappointing that disc #3 is mostly in STANDARD DEFINITION Blu-ray, with noticeable scan lines. It is obviously hobbled together quickly to give this set a third disc.  I saw only three Hi-Definition cartoons on disc #3: ""A Hitch In Time"" (1955), ""90 Day Wondering"" (1955) and in anamorphic widescreen ""Museum Scream"" (2003).  ""Superior Duck"" also looks good like it might be in Hi-Definition but it clocks in with the other standard definition cartoons.  ""Marvin Martian in the 3rd Dimension"" (1996) is a real disappointment in standard definition, it is letterboxed and not anamorphic,  the picture is really shrunk down. I was also looking forward to seeing ""The Dot and The Line"" as well as ""The Bear That Wasn't"" in Hi-definition, but that was not to be here.  Maybe if a Chuck Jones MGM Cartoon set comes out in Blu-ray we may see true Di-Definition presentations of those cartoons then.

So if you have all of the DVD Golden Collections, The Oscar Winners & Nominees collection, and the Superstars Collections, you will likely only be buying this for the 6 newly restored cartoons on discs 1 & 2.
I guess a direct re-release of the Golden Collections on Blu-ray would have sold less than a Blu-ray collection featuring 6 new titles not previously on DVD.

Notice that there are only 50 classic cartoons here, the old Golden Collection DVDs had 60 cartoons per set. So it will take more Blu-ray sets to cover the same quantity of cartoons as the old DVD sets.

** If you are trying to decide between the expensive ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" and the regular edition, there is really nothing ""Ultimate"" about the ""Ultimate Edition"".  The Ultimate edition adds a Bugs Bunny shot glass (yes you heard me Bugs Bunny is promoting alcoholic drinking) and a certificate of authenticity (like we are worried about bootleg Blu-rays), a tin with a picture on it and a matted lithograph.  I think reproductions of the cartoon lobby cards that appear shrunken in the booklet would have been a better deal.
Save your money & get the basic version, the discs are the same.**

At least something is being released for the animation fans again by Warner Home Video.  If you can afford it, lets support this Hi-Def project and keep some new titles coming out.

***UPDATE ABOUT THE DVDS***
The Looney Tunes Platinum Collection Volume 1 release was originally a Blu-ray ONLY release, and this review pertains to the Blu-Ray discs only.
Due to popular request, Warner Home Video later released a standard DVD 2-disc version which did not include the bonus disc #3.
Since each cartoon runs roughly 7 to 8 minutes, that means one disc with 25 cartoons on it runs about 3 hours and 8 minutes which is a maximum for a dual layer DVD before increasing compression artifacting.  While I do not have the standard DVDs to tell you if they include the bonus material on the Blu-ray discs #1 & 2, consider that there may not have been room on the discs to include them.",1311638400,466,5505,4.8101802757158

The video is in full screen.  Not the best transfer, but pretty good considering these are VERY old cartoons.

The bad news comes in the spanish dubbing.  I used to watch these cartoons when I was a kid back in the 80's.  Episodes such as Rabbit Of Seville, Duck Amuck, I Love To Singa, and Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2 century were instant classics.  The dubbing was part of what it made the episodes so good.  Perfect voices for the characters.

I watch in pain that the voices were redubbed with other actors, and now it lacks most of what made the episodes good.  Why did they have to redo the spanish dubbing?  Is like watching the Simpsons and having a guy doing Homer's voice instead of Dan Castellaneta. Is just not the same.

While he never got tired of watching the same cartoons, I saw the Platinum collection and thought it was time for us to see some different classic Looney Tunes. These are 1940 vintages and are very well crafted but the humor is oriented more towards teenagers and adults and the subject matter is often times more dark than the later lighter fare of the 50's and 60's. To be fare to the publisher, there is a caveat (on the Amazon website and on the disk) that the subject matter may not be acceptable to younger children. I assumed this to be just a politically correct statement and not really indicative of the cartoons but they are correct. This collection is not ideal for small children (my grandson is 5 years old).The cartoons did not hold his interest and I was actually a little uncomfortable during the few cartoons we did sit through together.

4661046,4,B005DMHHKQ,"In an effort to bring classic animation to Blu-Ray, WB decided to release Looney Tunes Platinum Collection back in 2011. For those who already have the Golden Collections, this is something you can live without since much of the main content is found on those as well. For those who do NOT have the Golden Collections and just want a glimpse of the whole picture, this (along with Vol. 2) is recommended.
Disc 1 showcases the main Looney Tunes stars in some of their most celebrated shorts.
Disc 2 brings in a few of the most celebrated one-shots, as well as the complete small repertoires (usually 2-5 shorts they only starred in) of minor characters such as Marvin The Martian, Taz, Marc Antony and Pussyfoot, Witch Hazel, and Ralph Phillips.
Disc 3 is loaded with special features paying homage to Chuck Jones with documentaries, shorts for the United States government, his two MGM one-shots (The Dot and The Line is UNRESTORED in contrast to the restored version in the Oscar Animation Set, while The Bear That Wasn't is MARRED with DVNR), as well as post-Golden Age WB theatrical shorts that allowed him to extend his legacy in the history Warner Bros. animation.

While this set has quite the amount of Jones' work, his Hunting Trilogy shorts, as well as others such as Elmer's Candid Camera and Ali Baba Bunny are actually found on Vol. 2. As said before, if you already have the Golden Collections, you can pass this set. If you want to see classic animation in 1080p HD, give it a shot.

4661053,5,B005DMHHKQ,"With all of the main Marvin The Martian movies on one of the three discs, this one is a no-brainer as far as I am concerned.
Here we have almost the pinnacle of the classic Warner Bros. Looney Tunes output give or take a few misses.
A box set of joy in sparkling HD which is perfect for old and young alike (some of the classics seem much funnier and ironic for the former).
Duck Dodgers and the 24th and a half Century, the greatest short ever made in my estimation, looks and sounds like the masterpiece that it is.

4661068,5,B005DMHHKQ,"Back in 2011, volume 1 of the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection was only on Blu-ray; it wouldn't be until the summer of 2012 that we saw it on DVD, with no bonuses at all! But that's OK, since the 2 DVDs in each of all 3 volumes are crammed with classic Looney Tunes shorts, 50 in all per volume, all restored and remastered in HD. With volume 1, 4 of the shorts featuring Marvin the Martian and Taz are finally in their original Fullscreen format on DVD, as they were in Faux-Widescreen on the Bugs and Daffy Super Stars DVDs. All the old Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts were made in Fullscreen to begin with, from the early years of Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid and Buddy & Cookie, all the way to the Seven Arts era of Cool Cat and Merlin the Magic Mouse & Second Banana! Luckily, the WB took that to heart with the Porky and Hippety Hopper volumes of the Super Stars volumes and left all those shorts in Fullscreen! Volume 1 contains 6 shorts never before on DVD, as 4 others are in their original Fullscreen format. Go ahead and add this to your classic toon DVD/Blu-ray library if you want to, unless you prefer the Golden Collections as they are, which are still being made and sold brand-new today!",1447632000,2,1206,4.364444444444445

I bought it because I noticed that many of my favourites - such as 'Hareway to the Stars' and 'Hasty Hare' are on it.  I love Marvin the Martian; he's absolutely delightful.  I never tire of his classic line, 'Where the kaboom?  There was supposed to be an earth- shattering kaboom!'  These cartoons are great for adults and kids alike, and if you find the price a little high, wait for it to come on special.

4661136,5,B005DMHHKQ,"Before a review or critique of these cartoons can be made, the viewer of this material MUST grasp 2 facts about the material:
1) The content was NEVER intended for Children to be the main audience. A lot of (mis-directed) criticism has been thrown towards Warner Bros. for the violence and racial comedy in these cartoons. Although the cartoons are (mostly) appropriate for all ages, the original intended audience was the adult American movie goer. These cartoons were created to be shown at the movie theater, on the big screen, before the main show. it was in the 1940's, 50's & 60's considered to be part of an 'evenings entertainment"" at the cinema.
2) To ""whitewash"" or to pretend that some of the material is obviously racially insensitive and abusive is to ""whitewash"" and ignore the reality of American culture of the time period when these films were created. America at that time was a racist and segregateonal society. This is an undisputable fact and any attempt to downplay or ignore this is an affront to the victims of the abuse.
Racism is wrong, has always been wrong,
But to act as if it has never existed in our culture is even more wrong, it's insulting.

With that out of the way, this wonderful collection of cartoons has to be among the greatest film treasures for ANY fan of comedy. If you are from my age group (mid-30's) then you will no doubt recall some of these cartoons from your Saturday mornings.
When I was young, these cartoons was hilarious. As an adult, the same cartoons are even more funny, and for all different reasons. The ""gang from termite terrace"" were some very funny and clever fellows, and it shows all through this collection.
The blue-ray HD quality of the films is AMAZING. Especially when you compare it side by side to the old TV Show quality. Breathtaking.

And did I mention that these cartoons are SOOOO FUNNY!!!! I am looking forward to sharing these treasures with my newborn son when the time is right, and hopefully, my grandchildren in the future.
In contrast to the garbage that is released as ""comedy"" in modern times, these cartoons are actually FUNNY and will make you LAUGH.
There is also a special treat on disk 3 of Vol. 1
The cartoon ""Museum Scream"" featuring Sylvester and Tweety Bird is the most hilarious modern Looney Tunes cartoon I have seen. Good Job Larry Doyle & Team. The ending gag is such a great payoff and really made me smile.",1410739200,2,2409,4.652582159624413
4661137,5,B005DMHHKQ,"Memories - that's what this box set is - memories.

As did most of my age group (50's and 60's) I watched these on Sat morning for many years. I even used to watch them with my brothers (who are 10 and 12 year younger than I). It was nice to visit with Bugs again. But my favorite was always Marvin the Martian. I had never seen the very first Marvin so this a big thrill for me.

Picture was great - probably as good as possible. Sound was very good - not perfect but much improved. Price was reasonable as well. Shipping was very quick and DVDs arrived in perfect shape.

I do agree with those who like to see this stuff released in a more organizied fashion - not in pieces and not the same episodes over and over. But then, in today world, it's all about the money so this is probably as good as we're ever going to get.

I would rate this an extremely high 9.25 to 9.75 - not very much that could be improved on here!.

This is the third collection we've bought, being suckers for BB and DD that we are. The problem was this volume contained some classic BB shorts like those with Marvin the Martian that were not included previously. According to Wikipedia 7 shorts here had not been included before. I don't like the DVD edition of this volume, as the case doesn't even come with a sleeve listing the episodes. Just two discs that look poorly manufactured. So far both seem to play fine but honestly my kids and I haven't watched all the shorts since most of them are on the other collections especially the Golden Collection already.",1403913600,,833,4.635135135135135

My kids are 15 and 17 and we are a conservative Christian family and I feel they are just now the right ages for some of the adult themes that some of the cartoons use. I guess we are old fashioned that way, but I don't think kids need to be exposed to some concepts quite so young.

4661207,2,B005DMHHKQ,"I guess I can say ""We will never learn"".
  While I love the looney tunes with all its stereotypes and imperfections, I regrettably fell into their trap again. I bought the Blu ray version thinking that the video transfer would be some how astonishing. I could now say that I'm a bit disappointed. Not only because I paid a high price, but because i'm back in their skimming of re-releasing the same material again and again with some new material to keep you hooked.
  The video transfer is good, but not great. you can still see ghost dots (from the films imperfections) going back and forth in the background of some of the shorts. So from now on I will pay more attention to the unfavorable reviews than those that rush into their computers and like a little kid start jumping and jamming about their newest toy, giving it 5 stars without using their common sense.
  So for all those that have not fallen into their trap yet, I will recommend them to stay way from the Blu ray version of this collection. It is a repetition of the old golden collection with a new fancy name to catch your attention. Besides if you own a decent Sony Blu ray player (S390 - S590 - BX39 -BX59) you will be able to enjoy your old DVD collection in astonishing 1920 x 1080 @24Hz up-conversion quality.

In my opinion, that was a slap in the face to those of us who had invested in volumes 1 through 6.

So, you'll understand if I have to look askance at the PLATINUM collection because so many of these titles were previously released in The Golden Collection.

For those who may be wondering (and I apologize if someone has already done this exercise) here, in alphabetical order, are the 6 cartoons on this Platinum Volume that I did NOT see among the cartoons on the 6 Volumes of The Looney Tunes Golden Collection:

BEDEVILED RABBIT
BILL OF HARE
DUCKING THE DEVIL
DR. DEVIL AND MR. HARE
FROM A TO Z-Z-Z-Z
A WITCHES TANGLED HARE

I would love to add the above 6 to my collection, but not at the cost of adding 19 duplicate cartoons.

It's bad enough that excellent offerings such as CAPTAIN HAREBLOWER and
RACKETEER RABBIT (a personal favorite) were given short shrift and wound up tucked away as extras on other disks (CAPTAIN HORATIO HORNBLOWER and PUBLIC ENEMIES: THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE GANGSTER FILM, respectively).

The 100% best of these cartoons were during their heyday in the 40's with my favourite overall 'The Great Piggy Bank Robbery'. ""Nothing's impossible to Duck Twacy!""

Since these sets contain many shorts from previous releases they're cost is incredibly cheap 30$ and lower!

4661227,3,B005DMHHKQ,"It is hard to believe that it has nearly been a decade since Warner Brothers decided to finally release the Looney Tunes cartoons on DVD. There have been a few smashes and a few misses as well. But overall, with the six Golden Collections, they have done well with bringing in the timeless gems of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and others to a whole new generation nicely. While there have honestly been a few hits and misses, they did a mostly good job. Still, there were a few gems that were definitely missing that could've been highlighted from each of the 6 volumes from 2003-2008. When Warner Brothers though decided to stop releasing new volumes after Volume 6, what would they do. Well, they decided to start from scratch by making a new array of collections called the Platinum Collection. But is the first one worth the money? Well, for the avid collector there are some highlights, but others well not really.

(This review is exclusively for the DVD edition, not the Blu-Ray edition of the Looney Tunes: Platinum Collection: Volume 1.) The Looney Tunes: Platinum Collection: Volume 1 is a sampler of some of Warner Brothers brightest shorts from Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and their escapes with humor against Elmer Fudd, Witch Hazel and others. The collection should've been overall what Warner Brothers should've tried overall for what they had failed with the lesser-known spotlight collections which definitely weren't worth their money for the overall long run. The 2 disc DVD set includes some gems from the classic era, but no extra unlike the Blu-Ray edition. The collection does include favorites like the definitive What's Opera Doc?, the hilarious Robin Hood Daffy where Daffy tries to impress Porky with his marksman skills, the Oscar-winning Speedy Gonzales, and Duck Amuck where Daffy is furious at a mischievous animator (Bugs) for not focusing on getting the animation right in a classic cartoon. There are a few shorts that are highlighted that have never been on the Golden Collections including Hare-Way To The Stars where Bugs gets accidentally shot into space and has to save the Earth from Marvin The Martian's grasp, and A Witch's Tangles Hare where Witch Hazel wants to use Bugs as a brew, and gets sidelined in a castle where he has fight his way out of her witchcraft but also a wanderer that desires to be a writer named Sam whom had once dated Witch Hazel. Overall, the highlights fare well, yet there are a few faults. Honestly the biggest fault is that there aren't as many features for the DVD edition over the blu-ray edition. So you don't see as many classic gems or extras that are highlighted to match the other versions. Second of all, they still have had some of the same faults that the first Golden Collection had suffered. Mainly the music from The Rabbit Of Seville wasn't in tune from the original version on video years ago. That should've been fixed up.

Overall, there are a few highlights from the Looney Tunes: Platinum Collection. It is a better bet on Blu-Ray for the die hard Looney Tunes collector. But overall, you really could've gotten more for your money's worth. But still, it is a better sample than what Warner Brothers had rolled out from the cheaper Spotlight Collections from 2003-2009. If you are new to the Looney Tunes cartoons though and have never owned a single collection of Bugs Bunny and all his rascal friends, than this would be a nice place to start. But, overall I would definitely recommend buying the Golden Collection Volumes 1-6 instead.

All of your favorite characters are here (Bugs, Marvin, Foghorn, Taz, Wile E. Coyote, Daffy, and so on), and some of the greatest American cartoons ever (Duck Amuck, What's Opera Doc) are here.  Of course, when a studio has a library as extensive as Warner Brothers', it seems likely that no single collection is likely to contain all of the classics.  Missing from this collection are some unforgettable cartoons like Rabbit Seasoning, Duck! Rabbit, Duck! and A Sheep in the Deep, but all-in all this is an amazing collection of great old cartoons.  They're remastered beautifully and are a sight to behold.
If you want your kids to grow up with an appreciation of Chuck Jones and Mel Blanc (that's why I bought this), then you can't do better than this amazing collection.",1342310400,686,1979,4.7354651162790695
4661229,3,B005DMHHKQ,"Because it mostly has previously release shorts from the Golden Collections. But at least there are some shorts from the Super Stars DVD that were improved on this Blu Ray release (they're left in fullscreen on this release unlike the Super Stars where they were cropped in widescreen loosing the top and bottom of the picture). Only 6 shorts are new here (counting ""The Hasty Hare"" because it's the original version unlike on the Saturday Morning cartoons DVDs where it's featured with TV titles) and are incredibly remastard in HD. And it contains a couple new bonus shorts like ""The Door"" (1968) and new bonus features. In conclusion, it's good but I'd rather get Looney Tunes DVD and Blu Ray releases that contains mostly (or only) new-to-DVD/Blu Ray cartoons and less previously release shorts and I already have all 6 of the Golden Collections. So I'm not buying it, it's kind of a waist of money.",1341792000,4,903,4.794871794871795

4661231,2,B005DMHHKQ,"Excellent cartoons, but disappointing DVD release.  While the Blu-Ray version of the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection had tons of great extras, including a whole extra disc devoted to special features, this was just a two-disc bare bones set.  Many of the cartoons have already been released on Golden Collections.  Why not just release the ones never released before on DVD?  I really hope the next classic Looney Tune DVD release is better than this.",1341446400,6,452,5.0675675675675675
4661232,5,B005DMHHKQ,"Forget all the complaints that this set contains too many ""double-dips"" of cartoons already released on DVD. These are not double dips. These versions of these classic cartoons, which now probably look as good as the day they were released, have never been available on home video before. Plus, even if you do own all the previous DVD releases several new cartoons and special features make this set worth a purchase.

But I want to get to my main reason for this set being better than any Looney Tunes Golden Collections: a better set list. Yes, the individual cartoons are like songs and any collection is like an album. This Blu-Ray set hits exactly the right balance of variety and cohesion. In the Golden Collections entire discs would be dedicated to one series or theme or director, and to all but the most dedicated fans this is detrimental. I love Bob Clampett, but his frequent repetition of gags and storytelling devices means that after an hour or so of his cartoons my eyes begin to glaze over and everything runs together. On the 50 cartoons over these two discs the individual ""chunks"" in the set list (Bugs cartoons, Daffy cartoons, every Marvin the Martian short, ect.) average at five cartoons, which are perfect digestible chunks.

Disc one starts with a chunk of Bugs Bunny cartoons, followed by Daffy, then Porky, and rounding out the disc is one or two cartoons from other main stars (Tweety, Road Runner, ect.). There's a nice balance within these chunks, too. They aren't skewed towards one era of a particular character. You get a nice sample of that character through the years and various permutations: earlier, heckling Bugs and later, more heroic Bugs; screwball Daffy and conceited Daffy; Clampett's wild Tweety and the more reserved (by Looney Tunes standards) Tweety of the Sylvester cartoons; ect.

Disc two starts with a sampling of some of the best one-shot characters in Looney Tunes history. These are some of my favorites: The Three Little Bops, I Love to Singa, and The Dover Boys! The bulk of this disc is dedicated to the complete runs of characters who served as villains to Bugs and Daffy, and who only appeared in a few cartoons despite their popularity: Marvin the Martian, The Tazmanian Devil, and Witch Hazel. Rounding out the set are three of the wonderful Marc Antony and Pussyfoot cartoons (there are actually five of these. I wonder why the other two aren't here?) and both of the Ralph Phillips cartoons.

Disc three contains several documentaries on director Chuck Jones and about 20 bonus cartoons split into two groups: cartoons by Jones made for either the US government or MGM, and several of the newer Looney Tunes cartoons which have been made in a scatter shot fashion for TV and theatrical presentation in the years following the end of the original series. Most of these cartoons are in standard definition and a little worse for wear, but a few are in HD.

In short, this is a must-buy for a Looney Tunes fan, and if you've never collected them on home video before this is the perfect first set to get.",1340409600,,3066,4.766478342749529

This comes with a ""collector's glass"" but it's really a shot glass, so you can tell that this is intended for a more mature audience.  These cartoons, may now be considered too violent, or racy, for this generation of children, were great cartoons and still are.

I bought this product because I loved watching Looney Tunes when I was younger and I've found that I still enjoy it.  For me this was a must because I love blu ray, and I love collector's editions.

4661236,4,B005DMHHKQ,"In a surprising move, Warner Bros. is releasing a DVD version of the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection this July. If you don't have the Blu-ray release (or if you don't have a Blu-ray player at all) then fans should double-dip. Why? The reasons:

-4 of the shorts from the first wave of Looney Tunes Super Stars (Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck) will be in their original full screen formats for the first time.
-6 cartoons will make their DVD debut at long last.
-Complete collections of Marvin The Martian, Taz, Witch Hazel, Mark Anthony, and Ralph Phillips

The only con is that it won't have a DVD version of the 3rd disc from the Blu-ray release but this set will port over the same extras from the first 2 discs of the Blu-ray.

4661237,5,B005DMHHKQ,"I'm 34 and grew up watching cartoons like Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry, and later GI Joe and Transformers.  In my opinion, many of today's cartoons just aren't funny or entertaining.  I purchased this box set with the idea that I could sit down with my 4- and 5-year old kids and have a laugh, and that's exactly what keeps on happening.  My kids don't laugh at ""Jake & the Neverland Pirates"" or other lame Disney or Nick Jr. cartoons, but they DO laugh out loud at these Looney Tunes cartoons.  I think the Blu Ray upgrade makes it look newer to them, and I'm not sure if they would enjoy Looney Tunes as much if they looked as grainy as they did when I watched them when I was young.  For you picky video types, keep in mind this is an upgrade to Blu Ray, so it's not a perfect picture. But, to those familiar with Looney Tunes, you'll appreciate how your old favorite cartoons look like they've been spring-cleaned.  I wish (and think) they could've included more cartoons in this set given the storage capabilities of Blu Ray, but 50 is a good start and makes me eagerly anticipate Volume 2.",1332288000,,1095,4.3431372549019605

I mean, the very very old from the begining and may be a little bit more variety. The original soundtrack in English is O.K. but the new spanish dubbing is ugly and it doesn't match with the characters and the origianl voice that I used to listen. So, if you are a spanish speaker, and you used to like the original dubbing, re-consider to purchase this product because it doesn't include the original, and some of the cartoons are not available in spanish, just a few of them. But if you are very nostalgic about the looney toons, I strongly recomend this product even if you watch with the original language (english) and subtitles in spanish or english. All cartoons are re-mastered but you can see a lot of artifacts on the screen. Colors are O.K. and so is the audio.",1330387200,,899,4.454545454545454
4661239,4,B005DMHHKQ,"I have all 6 volumes of the Looney Tunes Golden Collections on DVD, but don't own any other Looney Tunes DVDs. I bought the Platinum Collecion on blu-ray because I am a sucker for this stuff and want to get all the shorts I remember watching when I grew up. To my reckoning, of the 50 shorts released in this set (on disc 1 and 2), 39 are available on the Golden Collections which makes for 11 new shorts for me. This is pretty good considering that this could have been a complete double up. I don't really care for the extra shorts or bonus material on disc 3, but that's bonus content for ya. However there is easily room on those 2 discs for a lot more shorts so they really should have put 60 shorts on here to keep it in line with the golden collections approx 60 shorts per volume.

What really suprises me is the improvement in quality between the blu-ray and DVD versions of the shorts. Some are better and some are much better. I really didn't think I'd be impressed with the difference, but I am. The cartoons aren't any funnier in blu-ray, but I really appreciate how much better they look remastered and in HD.

The mix of shorts on this set is very good. Lot's of the well known ones that myself and many people will remember from their childhood are on here. All of the Marvin Martian, Taz and a bunch of my favourite Bugs and Daffy shorts. Only a couple of older ones that, although may be classics, just aren't entertaining for me. I really wish they would release these sets in a chronological fashion the way they have done so far for Tom and Jerry. However, unlike Tom and Jerry, I suppose WB would find it hard to shift the volumes containing the really early B&W stuff which isn't nearly as good as the best stuff (to put it nicely) which is probably why they mix up the sets in an almost random fashion.

Hopefully all the shorts I remember from my youth, including ""Wild and Woolly Hare"" which I beg WB to put on volume 2, that didn't make it to the golden collection eventually do make it to the platinum collection. Time will tell. This first volume of the platinum collection is a good start.",1330300800,9,2119,4.319095477386934
4661240,3,B005DMHHKQ,"I was really excited about this and not even upset about the white dots issue since it seemed like how I saw them as a kid.

I would have liked to have been warned that these were cut and censored before purchasing.",1329955200,,391,4.444444444444445
4661241,2,B005DMHHKQ,"They, again, are mixing up many of the ancient, unfunny, undesirable, 1930's shorts with the more familiar late 40's and 50's classics. And as the Golden Collection on DVD got into later volumes, each new volume had less and less of the shorts that we cherished in syndication on Saturday mornings during the late seventies and the eighties.

So, No way!  Not this time!  I am not going to invest in Looney Tunes on Blu-Ray if they are going to follow the same reckless release formula.  I'd rather see them release these animated shorts in order of their original release dates. Like the way the seasons of our favorite TV shows are done.  I'd like to see them release a separate 1930's Collection in volumes, and then a 1940's collection in separate chronological volumes, and then the 1950's, and so on.  You know, like ""Looney Tunes: Volume 9: 1943-1945"".  Then we can all collect the discs in a way that we'd enjoy watching them.  I'd probably even enjoy watching those less-than-amusing 1930's shorts IF they were all released together in their own time capsule package.

And what was even more of a waste of space is all those featurettes.  I don't mind a one hour featurette here and there, but the Golden Collection had the history of Looney Tunes and Termite Terrace at a point of extreme overkill.  Not that they are terrible, but they are all not worth watching more than once, so that proves to be a lot of wasted space that could have went towards another 30 or 40 animated shorts, which is why we want these cartoon collections in the first place!

So, Looney Tunes, maybe you'll get it right with the future upcoming Bronze Collection if you ever get the sense to release these animated shorts in a PREFERRED chronologically released sense of order.",1329696000,41,1765,4.676375404530744
4661242,4,B005DMHHKQ,"Most fans of Bugs, Daffy, Wile E, etc, likely have already bought the Golden Collections.  Which comprise over 33% of the whole (350 cartoons net sold, of the over 1100 available).

The first Blu-ray set does feature a number of never-before released titles, some of which are classics, but many of the cartoons already having been released might make some want to reconsider double-dipping, for now.

Personally, waiting for the set to drop price might be interpreted as ""lack of interest"" by the publisher.  Since other TV shows and film series have had releases halted or discontinued due to lack of interest, it's a shame the devout fans of the programs are the ones who suffer the most.

To be honest, the level of restoration gone into these films is really well done - in terms of restoring color, and eliminating enough film grain but without eliminating the feel that would have accompanied their presentation in the late-1940s through 60s (their 'golden age' in terms of story ideas and sight gags).

More on restoration:  As to peoples' complaints of white specs, or white glaze that appears when a character appears, a lot of these are due to how the animation was made (cel animation, placing numerous transparent sheets of drawings on top of each other.)  These aren't the usual film scratches and other defects you'd expect, and for the sake of ""authenticity"", these particular ""defects"" are not removed, and some of them can't be - not without a level of effort that is just impractical.

So the set is worth getting, even if it's a partial double-dip.  The added Marvin and Witch Hazel material alone make this set worth splurging for.

One other thought - I own the first 7 Golden DVD volumes.  Some of the later volumes went back into history -- these are great for historical purposes, but the Golden age material (50s and 60s) are definitely the ones that general audiences tend to remember better.  With luck, future volumes will focus on this half of the era first.",1329696000,3,1988,4.794721407624634

4661246,5,B005DMHHKQ,"""Eh, what's up, Doc?"" I bought the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection on Blu-ray Disc and watched it on my family's big screen TV. The cartoons have never looked this great before! The picture was so crystal-clear, I could see the original film grain, along with the dust and dirt that were photographed on the original animation cels. The mono soundtrack was so clean and bombastic, it literally blew me away. The same high-definition masters were reused, but this time, most of the cartoons have undergone further restoration to remove any imperfections that Warner Bros. had missed when they first restored the cartoons for the Looney Tunes Golden and Spotlight Collections on DVD. For instance, I watched ""Baseball Bugs"" on DVD, and there were some emulsion stains and one splice bump that Warner Bros. forgot to tackle. That splice bump appeared in one frame as Bugs Bunny paced his first pitch. The DVD version also had excessive film grain. I watched the same cartoon on Blu-ray, and I noticed a huge difference. The emulsion stains are now gone, the splice bump has been eliminated, and the film grain has been reduced. ""From A to Z-Z-Z-Z"" was shown on television with the Merrie Melodies Blue Ribbon title sequences from the early 1960's reissue. And now, the Looney Tunes title sequences from the original 1954 release have been restored for the Blu-ray release. I'd strongly recommend this Blu-ray Disc set to die-hard animation fans alike. I'd also recommend it to aspiring animators, including myself. ""That's all Folks!""",1326499200,7,1532,5.035433070866142

4661249,5,B005DMHHKQ,"I own all 6 Golden collections and Superstar collections (Bugs, Daffy, Foghorn and soon to be Pepe). I ordered the ""Ultimate"" edition of this Platinum Collection, and soon after I received it, I didn't realize that this was also a limited & numbered collector's edition! Everything that's contained in the box is way cooler than I expected! The discs are amazing! All the cartoons are carefully selected from all 6 Golden collections, re-mixed up and upgraded into hi-definition as well! They're so well upgraded that it makes me forget just how old these cartoons are! This is the first time I ""double-dipped"" with something that I technically already have. But, because its an upgrade to the Golden collections, and a Vol. 1 to a new collectors series, I understand. I just hope Warner Bros. knows their fans and keeps giving us what we want. Like, I hope they continue releasing the Superstars collections for example, because at least those have new content (even though those ones also have a few of the same cartoons we already have. Us fans actually have to educate ourselves with every LT release now because the Tweety disc had zero new material and the Roadrunner disc was also a waste of time. If it wasn't for the internet & customer reviews, I and many other fans would have been screwed over). A Sylvester stand-alone Superstar disc with (at least some of) his unreleased cartoons would be amazing.  I wish... Wait a second, didn't the description on the 5th Golden collection say ""Your wish is our command""? Common Warner Bros. please finish what you started. Just do it once then never again at least. I'm totally fine with limited  collectors editions. As long as you guys release the rest of the cartoons, my money is yours!

If there is going to be a Vol. 2 in this new Platinum blu-ray series, I hope its all unreleased cartoons. If I have to start my collection all over again then I'll just stop buying because that's not fair to us fans. I'm not rich like they are and I can barley make a living myself. If they release SOME unreleased cartoons mixed with many we already have (like this set) I guess I'm a sucker for it. As long as there is new content, that's all that matters. Thank you Warner Bros. regardless.",1325116800,10,2237,4.658227848101266

4661251,4,B005DMHHKQ,"Warner has done an exceptional job of restoring many of these classic cartoons first for the DVD presentation and now for Blu-ray using the same high def masters for both.

Unless giving the deluxed, limited boxed set as a gift, there's really no advantage to spending the extra money to me as the essential content (the shorts, extras, etc.) are the same.

How does this set look? The DVDs looked exceptional--with bright, bold colors and crisp detail. The Blu-ray although it isn't as much a huge jump from, say, VHS to to remastered DVDs but they are still worth picking up. What was dazzling in the DVD sets is even more dazzling here. There's improved detail and other improvements that are quite noticeable. Your mileage may vary depending on your set up but for me this was an improvement.

Be aware however that dark backgrounds still show the dust that was on the animation cels when they were photographed to create the film. I'm fairly certain that Warner chose not to remove this because it's technically not considered a ""flaw"" by them--it's like film grain an inherent element of the shorts and there was concern about overuse of digital clean up tools to remove all the character of the originals. You may like this, you may not but it's still there so be aware of it.

Audio sounds quite nice with a nice restored mono presentation of the original soundtracks.

This three disc set contains 50 cartoons on the first two discs. Unfortunately Warner has once again mixed up these cartoons often sequencing them in a sometimes puzzling fashion; I would have group them by character, era or type of cartoon. There is a pretty good comedic flow in the sequencing here but it is a bit frustrating if, for example, you want to stick with a certain era or director. The first disc is grouped with a series of classic Bugs Bunny cartoons followed by Daffy Duck and then a smattering of the other popular characters.

Hare Tonic
Baseball Bugs
Buccaneer Bunny
Old Grey Hare, The
Rabbit Hood
8 Ball Bunny
Rabbit Of Seville
What's Opera, Doc?

Robin Hood Daffy

Kitty Kornered
Scaredy Cat
Porky Chops

Tale Of Two Kitties, A
Tweetie Pie
Fast And Furry-ous

Twilight in Tunes: The Music of Raymond Scott
Powerhouse in Pictures
Putty Problems and Canary Rows
A Chuck Jones Tutorial: Tricks of the Cartoon Trade
The Charm of Stink: On the Scent of Pep&eacute; le Pew

It's pretty clear that most of the critical and audience favorites were the focus on disc one.

The second disc features a mix, again, of Bugs and Daffy along with some of the ones associated strongly with certain directors for example ""One Froggy Evening"" by Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese and ""The Dover Boys at Pimento University"" (a cartoon that I've never cared for and the appeal of which, honestly, has always escaped me) by Friz Freleng and Ted Pierce.

One Froggy Evening
Three Little Bops (A clever jazz retelling of ""The Three Little Pigs"")
I Love To Singa (another cartoon the appeal of which escapes me)
Katnip Kollege
The Dover Boys at Pimento University

Hasty Hare, The
Duck Dodgers In The 24th Century
Hare-way To The Stars
Mad As A Mars Hare
Devil May Hare
Bedevilled Rabbit
Ducking The Devil

Dr. Devil And Mr. Hare
Bewitched Bunny
Broom-stick Bunny
Witch's Tangled Hare, A
A-haunting We Will Go
Feed The Kitty

Featurettes include:
It Hopped One Night: The Story Behind One Froggy Evening
Wacky Warner One-Shots
Mars Attacks! Life on the Red Planet with My Favorite Martian
Razzma-Taz: Giving the Tasmanian Devil His Due
The Ralph Phillips Story: Living the American Daydream

The third disc includes 9 Chuck Jones government shorts including: ""Point Rationing of Food"", ""90 Day Wonder"", ""Hell-Bent for Election"", ""Drafty, Isn't It?"", ""So Much for So Little"" and ""A Hitch in Time"" plus ""The Dot and The Line"" Jones' Academy Award winning short based on Norman Juster's book and ""The Bear That Wasn't"". ""The Door"" an anti-war parable produced by Bill Cosby is included in what appears to be an SD transfer upscaled and we getthe pencil tests for ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"".

We also get ""Chuck Amuck"" the movie about director Chuck Jones; ""Chuck Jones: Extremes and In-Betweens"" a salute to Jones; ""Chuck Jones: A Memory of Childhood""

The last disc is rounded out with the following cartoons with popular characters ""out of their element"" as it states and documentaries/featurettes. Almost all of these appear to be in standard definition which is a bit disappointing. : ""Fright Before Christmas"" (an SD presentation of the cartoon which suffers from some interlace issues), ""Spaced-Out Bunny"", ""Duck Dodgers and The Return of the 24 1/2 Century"", ""Another Froggy Evening"", ""Marvin The Martian in The Third Dimension"", ""Superior Duck"", ""From Here to Eternity"", ""Father of the Bird"", ""Museum Scream""

The packaging is quite nice. The discs are packaged on the inside of the outer covers. There's a book in the center that gives us details on each cartoon (although curiously the years they were made in aren't listed)and the special features are listed along with a synposis for each cartoon included. There's also nice artwork including photos of model sheets, pencil tests, etc. as well as information on various characters.

Warner has done a good job of putting this set together much like the strong job they did with the DVD sets but, again, I would have preferred that these be grouped by characters, directors or themes for the whole set. I understand why Warner puts these sets together the way they do (just enough of the popular cartoons along with unknown gems and some outright stinkers)to they continue to sell it's a bit annoying for collectors.

Most of the work here is exceptional but as noted there are some issues with SD transfers being used (I'm assuming no high def master exists for these)and some other minor issues with the set.

Stupor Salesman gets me every time, regardless of the picture quality. Between VHS and DVD I have an impressive collection, but I am still missing so many more. So I hope they keep em coming, even if I have to buy 30 to get 3. My biggest problem might be owning a VHS player that works for the next 20 years.

These are historical documents, yet they are treated as if they are brand new cartoons. The cover art looks like slick cereal box design. The holographic foil material looks ultra-modern. I would have much preferred a retro design. How about the ubiquitous Loony Tunes / Merry Melodies intro for a cover; you know, the concentric circles. That would have been classy. And maybe a matte finish. That would have been cool IMHO. Of course, that would perhaps be more suited to a true chronological collection. It also bugs (pun intended) me that they don't even list the dates of the cartoons in the digibook. Weird. Oh, well.",1322092800,10,839,4.714285714285714
4661257,5,B005DMHHKQ,"I'm not very good at reviewing products, because I don't like expressing my opinion to the general public, but I'll tell you a little bit about this DVD.

You might be wondering what the difference is between the regular platinum collection, and the ultimate collectors' edition is.  I'll tell you.  With the regular one, you get all the cartoons, and all the bonus footage, most if not all of which was probably released in the Goldens.  You will get nothing more, and nothing less.

The ultimate edition does not have any more cartoons or bonus materials than does the regular edition.  All of the viewing content is EXACTLY the same.  The other little things that come with it are just collector perks, in the way of souvenirs.  That is, you get a little 2.5 ounce glass, which is slightly larger than a standard shot.  It has Bugs Bunny text by Warner Bros, and on the opposite side is a photo (actually a drawing because he's a cartoon) of Bugs in his rabbit hole, and smiling in a presentative fashion.  You will also get a tin souvenir sign about 4 or 5 inches square with Bugs and Daffy hanging out of the Looney Tunes circle.  It has a magnet on the back of it as well.  Last, a framed litho cel of the main LT characters marching down the street parade style, and a certificate of authenticity.  Also, your ultimate (special limited) set will be numbered, to mark the fact that this is a limited production.  Only 36,000 units will be produced.  And that's it!

So, I think you are all aware of the new cartoons vs cartoons previously released, and I will not go into detail with that.  It's up to you whether you want to pay the extra five bucks to get extra junk that you probably won't care about, unless you just like nicknacks.  If all you care about is the viewing content, which is really the whole point, then go with the regular one and save 5 bucks.  But if for some reason you do want it, 5 bucks isn't unreasonable for what you get.  The price might change anyway, who really knows?

If you do not own ANY of the prior collections, and you have a taste for blu-ray, then I'd highly suggest this product.  It's a great stand-alone small collection of toons (50 of them) and a couple extra ones in the bonus footage.  If however you have been collecting all the DVDs that are worth buying, then there are only about 8 new toons here, with more post-jones cartoons in the bonus featurettes.  Unfortunately, this is enough to stop a lot of people from buying this who have given up hope on restoration for new cartoons.  They might say you're paying 50 bucks for 8 new cartoons, which for the collector, you can't really argue with.

I am not going to discuss video quality/playback/transfer or any of the sort either.  I really don't know what I'm looking at to tell you.  To me, a cartoon is a cartoon.

I really like this product.  That's the only opinion I'll give, and the only way I'll give it.  Thank you.",1322006400,14,2930,4.430711610486892
4661258,5,B005DMHHKQ,"The main draw for me to purchase this set was that it included the complete collection of Marvin the Martian and Taz cartoons, as I already have the 6 Golden Collections and all the Superstars discs. Well after getting it and watching some of the cartoons my mind was blown as to how well the cartoons look on a 1080p set. The colors pop as if they were produced just yesterday. Although in some of the cartoons scratches and dust are more noticeable (one has to remember that these cartoons were made around 60-70 years ago), but it does not detract from the overall experience.

Also included in the collector's set is a certificate of authenticity,a framed lithograph titled ""The Looney Tunes March,"" a tin sign that features Bugs and Daffy, and of all things a Bugs Bunny shot glass. According to the box, only 36,000 of these sets were produced, so for die-hard Looney Tunes collectors this might be right up your alley!

Disc 1 contains a random assortment of goodies from Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and other Looney Tunes stars.

Disc 2 contains the complete Marvin the Martian, the complete Taz the Tasmanian Devil, and the complete Witch Hazel, as well as complete collections for other stars. This disc also features one-hit wonders such as I Love to Singa, The Three Little Bops, and One Froggy Evening.

Disc 3 contains films revolving around one of the greatest animation directors of all time Chuck Jones, and features some of his greatest non-Looney Tunes shorts such as: The Dot and the Line and other rare Chuck Jones oddities. Also included on this disc is 9 bonus cartoons such as: Spaced-Out Bunny, Superior Duck, and From Hare to Eternity.

4661259,5,B005DMHHKQ,"This set is a revelation! People who think the DVD is ""good enough"" are nuts.

I just watched all the Clampetts and the early Jones cartoons on my ten foot screen and every single one had my jaw on the floor. They're beautiful. The overall saturation level is too high and the volume of the cartoons is a bit low, but I turned down the color and turned up the sound and they were perfect... No, beyond perfect. I've seen these cartoons projected theatrically quite a few times, but the colors weren't anywhere as well balanced in theatrical prints as they are here. It isn't like the Disney films where everything is goosed up and shifted to primary colors. These transfers have very sophisticated color schemes with muted colors AND vivid ones. Great Piggy Bank Robbery and especially Kitty Cornered had some of the most amazing color I've ever seen. The lines were sharp, you can see textures and brushstrokes on the backgrounds and every frame is crystal clear with no compression or DVNR artifacting. I've been quite critical of the transfer quality of the Looney Tunes on DVD, but this time, WB got it right.

Don't believe me? Check out this photo I shot off my screen using my iphone...
[...]

If you think your DVDs look good, pop in One Froggy Evening and skip to the scene where the crowd of people is exiting crossing the scene about 3/4 of the way through the cartoon. Still frame on that crowd. On DVD, it's a macroblocked mess of colored boxes. On bluray, it's pristine. The color balances, digital noise reduction and frame sharpness are MUCH worse on the DVDs. This set is a thousand times better. When I put in the third disk with the standard def documentaries with the old prints, it was like going back to the stone age.

4661264,2,B005DMHHKQ,"So six volumes, altogether comprising maybe half the Warner Bros. cartoon library, and then back to the beginning in Blu-Ray? Oh, well, for those who haven't bought the first collections, they might as well start with these.

Frankly, it gets a little tedious, this continual worship at the shrines of ""What's Opera Doc?"" and ""One Froggy Evening"" which, great cartoons that they are--let's face it--lose their punch after 60 or 80 viewings. (Forget this ""best of"" nonsense: the best are the ones you enjoy the most, not the ones Leonard Maltin or Jerry Beck tell you are the best.) And I don't know about you, but I don't WANT to see the entire pencil test of ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas,"" like seeing the dreary mechanical backstage area of a beautiful theme park ride. ""Making of"" material can be intriguing in small doses, but tends to dilute the magic of the main event.

The only surprise is that they've included ""The Door,"" a rarely shown ""special"" cartoon made during the 1968 last gasp of the series (the other one, ""Norman Normal,"" appeared in Volume 6) when most of the classic Merrie Melodie/Looney Tune artists were working elsewhere--if they were working at all--and the cartoons themselves had that generic '60s Jay Ward look.

But I mustn't be too much of a spoilsport. I'll be vewwy vewwy quiet now and let the customers decide what they want to plunk their money down for. There are worse expenditures than an optimum quality collection of Warner Bros. cartoons.",1316217600,25,1484,4.834645669291339

When I found out about ""Marvin the Martian in the Third Dimension,"" ""Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24 Century,"" and ""Father of the Bird"" being released in this set, I nearly leapt around the room like Daffy Duck! Woohoo! Woohoo! Woohoo! Not only that, but finally being able to see this hilariously memorable cartoons in high definition makes me feel like a kid again. The anxiety of waiting for Christmas to see if his most-wanted toy is wrapped up under the tree is almost too much to bear!

Now let me step down from Cloud Nine to explain some imperfections with this set. First off, I realize that I can't have it perfectly the way I want it unless I'm the one in charge of making these collections. I'm the kind of guy who likes to keep things in order - y'know, so neatly organized that it makes you wonder if I've been outside in the past year. With that said, I like the way the flow is organized by character, but I'd prefer to have the shorts organized chronologically, by theatrical release date. Also, I see that ""Museum Scream"" is included as a bonus short. This was originally released on the Australian version of the Brendan Fraser film, ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action."" Granted, ""The Whizzard of Ow,"" ""Hare and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" and ""Attack of the Drones"" are already available on other recent sets, but what about ""Cock-A-Doodle Duel"" and ""My Generation G-G-Gap?""  It would've been nice to include all seven of these in this new Blu-Ray set. On the other hand, I could see why they didn't. If they're planning to continue this Platinum Collection, maybe they're going to release these newer shorts on sets to come.  Time will only tell.

Another wonderful thing about this set is the disc devoted to Chuck Jones. I love his animation style and am eager to watch all of the documentaries about him and see his non-Looney Tune shorts on Blu-Ray.

All in all, this looks like a well-thought-out collection that's going to make a lot of fans happy. We'll see what happens when people have actually had the chance to sit down and watch this all the way through.",1316217600,5,2226,4.622784810126582

That wonderful disc included a bonus feature of two classic cartoons (""Rabbit Hood"" and ""Robin Hood Daffy"") in high definition!  Wow, talk about a difference!
