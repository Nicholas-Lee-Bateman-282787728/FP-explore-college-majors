2446322,2,B000BYA4F6,"My 6 year old daughter saw this advertised on tv and wanted it so badly that she emptied out her piggy bank and bought it for herself.

She is SOOO disappointed--the dance instruction is WAY too fast.  Even the ""break down the moves"" section is too fast and short.  There is not enough instruction or repetition--this video is for those who already know the dances.

For anyone with younger kids, Bella Dancerella is MUCH better.  My daughter's friend has it and they both enjoy THAT one.",1140220800,6,488,4.627906976744186
2446323,1,B000BYA4F6,"The video as far as what it is for was great. The only problem was it went in fast speed. My granddaughter is 11 yrs old and took dance lessons for 2 yrs. She loves to dance and also needs this for weight loss.

This video is not very well set up. It gives you the step by step for each dance/workout but it is very very fast.

You would have to wait the 1st part for 5 mins. a day each day to just get the 1st steps down and continue. It would take forever to ever learn the steps at this speed. In future they need to slow it down. I don't recommend this for adults or dance pros.",1140220800,3,582,3.8016528925619837
2446324,4,B000BYA4F6,"I don't like to exercise, but I do like dancing. I am out of the age range for this DVD, but I thought it looked like a fun way to learn dance steps. It is! As another reviewer mentioned, the steps are hard. The DVD obviously relies on viewers to pause and rewind, as it goes through many steps in a short period of time. That's ok -- it just means it will take longer for me to go through the DVD. Overall, I would definitely say it's worth the price and to just have a little patience learning the moves.

The special features are a bit unnecessary, as I'm not really a fan of Sabrina Bryan and don't really need to see her music video or any behind the scenes footage. The shoe shopping extra is also a bit lacking, as it never really mentions that there are special sneakers for dancing that the viewer may want to buy, and only really talks about regular sneakers.",1139097600,11,869,4.203592814371257
2446325,1,B000BYA4F6,"I love dance work outs, so I thought this would be a great addition to my collection. However, this DVD was impossible to follow! Save your money.",1324944000,,146,4.444444444444445
2446326,2,B000BYA4F6,"I don't like to write negative reviews in general so please don't think I'm one of those people who has to find something wrong with everything.  That said, I think this video is a great concept but fails in function.  In order to be considered an exercise video it keeps moving and adding new steps too quickly to learn them before moving to the next sequence.  On the other hand it still tries to ""teach"" the steps so it's too slow (and overwhelming) to keep up any kind of aerobic benefit.  If your child isn't talented, experienced and/or willing to rewind the video to death to get it down you may fair better with another video.  Read my review for Urban Jam with Laya Barak.  She gets it right!",1297209600,,701,4.395348837209302
2446327,3,B000BYA4F6,"The workout was fun for a bit, but Sabrina doesn't thoroughly teach you the steps so you're left behind in the dust and it can be a bit obnoxious at times too.",1293494400,,159,4.0
2446328,1,B000BYA4F6,I bought this for my 13 year old daughter thinking it would be good exercise for her but it is way to hard. Very fast paced and very hard to keep up,1293494400,,148,3.65625
2446329,4,B000BYA4F6,"I really like this dance workout. Sabrina is a great teacher and she goes through each step so you can keep up! I didn't know what to expect, but I'm glad I got it!",1238457600,,164,3.8529411764705883
2446330,5,B000BYA4F6,"I absolutely love this DVD. I love the warm up, exercise 1, and exercise 2.  Sabrina is a great dance teacher, and yes, it does take a few times watching the dvd to get the steps right, but once you learn it, you know the routine, and it's really easy and fun to do.  It also gives you a great workout. Not to mention the music. With a lot of other workout DVDs, I don;t think that they have cool music like this one. I really recommend this to people who are 11-15, but not really younger than 11, because it may be kinda hard for them to keep up. But if you are in the age range that I said, it's literally not a hard program, maybe a little quick, but totally worth it in the end.  These are super fun dances, that I love to show my parents :)",1231632000,,746,3.9271523178807946
2446331,4,B000BYA4F6,"I think some reviewers are hard on this DVD.  If they got familiar with the DVD before rating it, it would help.  For instance, there is a section that shows the dance moves.  And, maybe it isn't 'on the music' as the one reviewer/dancer expected, but it's not JUST for dancers - it's for EVERY young girl!  My daughter (12 yrs) & I had fun trying out the moves.  And, I think you have to give them credit for repeating the moves again & again in the first exercise section (Pure Fun).  Though, honestly, at first it doesn't LOOK like they are - bcs the moves ARE challenging, so, no, I couldn't keep up... but they ARE repeated over & over!!  My daughter kept at it (she has NO kind of dance OR hip-hop training) & SHE GOT IT!!  Give it a CHANCE!!  It's SILLY FUN, IF you give it half a chance!  And, we LOVED that Sabrina included an actual dance video of her own.  The thing we didn't understand were the 2nd & 3rd exercise sections.  They were ODDLY distracting.  The 2nd & 3rd sections were strictly dancing by Sabrina & the backup dancers (not something you could 'follow' along with), but the WORST part was... it wasn't even Sabrina singing, tho SHE WAS singing to the camera.  That seemed VERY strange... you were watching HER sing, but it wasn't HER voice, OR her music... you were hearing OTHER music, WHILE she's singing.  That didn't make ANY SENSE!!  Listening to one thing... while watching another???  But, the message to young girls IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT... & made more valuable coming from someone like Sabrina!  I think they handled that quite well for young girls!  It's about FUN & MOVING... not being perfect... or even doing it like someone else does! It's about being YOU & ENJOYING who you are!",1230854400,,1720,4.490322580645161
2446332,1,B000BYA4F6,"Well, it sounds good on paper. This is just way too complex for most kids. Sabrina Bryan is 24 and has probably had more dance training than any 10 or 11 year old could possibly have at their young age. It moves way too fast. The set is really boring too.",1222905600,,255,4.019607843137255

2446334,5,B000BYA4F6,"I have been looking for a good dance workout video and this is one of the more fun ones. It does go a bit fast so unless you pick up on things quickly, this won't be nearly as much fun. She walks you through the steps as if you're in a real dance class. It is better for the teenage and older rather than preteens just because it takes being quick on your feet and the ability to mirror what they are doing.",1218153600,,407,3.9156626506024095

2446336,3,B000BYA4F6,"This dance DVD is too hard for a beginner with little to no experience in dancing. SHe does repeat the moves sveral times, but it is done too fast and it was hard to keep up. The only reason I got some of the dances down was through Pause, Rewind, and Step. I had to constantly rewind the DVD to see her repeat the moves. The music was enjoyable, and if you are able to keep up, it would be pretty fun. But for first time dancers like me, it is very hard. But if you don't mind a challenge, for for it! =)",1192579200,,505,3.8653846153846154
2446337,1,B000BYA4F6,"I bought this for my daughter thinking she would love to dance along with one of her favorite ""cheetah girls.""  After being very excited to try and up on her feet for the first 10 minutes she gave up.  This video would be fun if it had more breakdown of the dance moves and was slower paces.  Even I after years of dance and cheerleading had difficulty keeping up.  Don't bother buying this video if you looking for something your child can actually follow along with.",1189555200,,468,4.406976744186046
2446338,1,B000BYA4F6,"If you want to learn dance steps as a fun way of exercising -don't buy this DVD!!  There is hardly any instruction to speak of.  It's more of a performance DVD than a teaching DVD.  After 2 minutes of the warm-up I gave up and watched.  If you don't have dance training, forget it!  If you do have dance training, forget it!  Very disappointing.",1182038400,2,345,4.3125

2446341,3,B000BYA4F6,"My 7.5 year old daughter old niece loved it.  5 Year old was a little intimidated at first, but once she tried it she loved it.

2446342,1,B000BYA4F6,The lesson goes to quickly & before you know it Sabrina is ready to do the entire dance.  Her voice is annyoing & she doesn't break the steps down slow enough.  I've been a hip hop dancer half my life & this wasn't quality.  Save your money.,1170028800,3,241,4.085106382978723
2446343,4,B000BYA4F6,"My daughter and I worked out to this DVD and we had a really good time.  The routines were a little difficult, but that is what made it so fun.  We laughed and laughed at each other.  It takes a while to learn the moves, but when you get them the work out is even more fun.  The moves are very popular dance moves, so you feel like a real hip hopper when you do them.",1168300800,3,367,3.789473684210526
2446344,2,B000BYA4F6,"Way too hard to follow. My 4 year old refuses to bother, and my 9 year old is getting very frustrated. It goes very fast, and there is no step by step instructions. Even *I* tried it, I do aerobics on a regular basis and am familiar with the format, but I couldn't keep up with this video either. I hope that she doesn't give up on it, because it could be really fun. But she's going to have to watch it two hundred times for her to be able to catch on to the steps.",1168214400,4,466,3.8645833333333335
2446345,2,B000BYA4F6,"I bought this DVD so my daughter and I could dance along together and get some exercise -- however it is far too difficult for a young person to follow, and get this -- even with my many years of dance training, it was too difficult for ME to follow!  The moves are NEVER broken down by count, and the instruction is incredibly poor.  Virtually every dance class I've ever taken - including Master classes - broke down moves by count, so you can be on time, ""on"" the music.  Not so here.  It felt muddled and confusing.  Additionally, in the ""instruction"" segment, the moves are shown just once, from one angle, so if you aren't already familiar with the move shown, the guidance is inadequate.

It gets the two stars only for its appeal to teens & tweens, an underserved group when it comes to mixing exercise and fun.  I'd like to see more dance/exercise videos for this age group, but PRODUCED BETTER.",1167868800,26,904,4.475609756097561
2446346,1,B000BYA4F6,"Two minutes into the video and my daughter as already given up.  The moves are way too fast for anyone, who isn't already a trained dancer, to mimic.  There is absolutely no instruction, and like another reviewer said, the dancers face you which is also hard to copy.  I feel like it was a waste of money.  A dance video marketed for girls shouldn't be so complicated.  My daughter has wanted this video for a while and I am sad that she is so disappointed with it.",1167177600,11,465,4.2988505747126435
2446347,1,B000BYA4F6,"First, this is only for people with a serious dance background... there is virtually no instruction.  You just watch the girls do the moves a couple of times and then go on building from there.  And there is no instruction in how the moves are done either.

I also like to watch people dance facing away from me, wathing them from behind (if I am learning full blown choreography).  That way I am doing the exact same moves of them... not mirroring them, which is a much harder way to learn.

Anyway, if you are a serious dancer, who is up on all the hip-hop moves, this vieo will work for you... otherwise you will end up being totally frustrated.  This is not the mother/daughter workout I hoped it would be.

Thanks ""Byou"" for taking $10 I will never see again.  Not!",1166745600,6,770,4.373239436619718
2446348,2,B000BYA4F6,"I bought this for my niece who is 10 years old. She's so into the whole cheetah girls thing so I mainly bought it for that reason.  Overall it is well-put together and very cute choreography. However, they do a *terrible* job breaking down the routine and actually teaching it. My niece was getting really, really frustrated, as they move lighting fast.  I would expect with any of these type dvd's you would stop and start the dvd as needed to get the moves. However, I had to stop the dvd player, chunk the routine out myself and teach  it to her just to keep her from crying, which is something I think a dvd targeted to kids should do on its own. If you have a dance background and plan to be around to help the kid learn the routine, I would recommend it. Otherwise don't buy it for a kid unless they have a good amount of dance/cheerleading experience.",1166572800,7,858,4.316770186335404
2446349,5,B000BYA4F6,"While I understand that some younger children may get totally frustrated trying to do these moves, as a fitness instructor, I understand what goes into creating a workout that is both interesting, challenging and fun.  It is difficult for one fixed program to be all things to all levels, so perhaps this may be better suited to girls with a dance background.  But I don't think it is really required - just a willingness to try, try again.  While this may be marketed to younger girls, teens and even adults will enjoy this - if they can get past the common frustration of learning - it's actually a great dance program!  If it came too easy, you would quickly get bored, so laugh at your mistakes and remember that if you are not messing up, you're not learning anything new!",1165017600,4,777,4.5285714285714285

2446353,1,B000BYA4F6,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchase this DVD.  It is obvious that a profession choreographer was not involved in the making of this product at all.  You are shown too many moves at once and they are shown to you very quickly.  Even the ""break down"" section of the DVD is impossible to follow.  VERY Disappointing.",1148169600,10,331,4.377049180327869

This seems to me to be more of a ""tween"" kind of product.  Sabrina tells people in the beginning that they won't get the steps on the first try and to keep practicing.  I know for me, I hate doing videos that are so easy you get everything on the first try and then you're bored after watching it a few times.  There are three different workouts on the dvd so you can keep progressing as you get more skilled.  Talk about value for the money.  My niece will be able to use this dvd for years.  My sister loves doing the Byou workout with her daughter and she says it's great that they get to spend quality time together and are getting healthy as well.

After reading all of the reviews that accurately stated that the steps were too complicated for an 8 year old, I didn't follow my instincts and I ordered this product.  Bad mistake.  All I heard tonight was ""it's too hard, it's too hard"".  I sincerely doubt she will bother trying it again.

She started with the ""one on one"" lessons.  At times they zoom in on Ms. Bryan's face, and you totally miss the foot work necessary to execute the dance move.

It's a shame because the music is good & the moves aren't trashy - a rare combination in this day and age.",1140652800,8,675,4.21875
2446367,1,B000BYA4F6,"My 9 year-old saw this advertised on t.v. and expressed an interest--she needs the exercise and rarely finds activities that appeal to her, so I thought it would be great.  Unfortunately, it's very complex and difficult, and unlike most workout routines, has very little repetition. In order to complete the ""easy"" workout, one would have to master over half a dozen brief combinations that are not terribly well-explained even on the ""breaking down the moves"" bonus material.  I think we'd have to work on this for weeks in order to be able to follow well enough to get a decent workout. I kept telling her it was just as much exercise to do the steps wrong as to do them right, and not to worry about it, but frankly, it was so frustrating as to be useless.  We spent most of the ""workout"" standing still, trying to study the dance moves and understand how to execute them.  Contrast this to Richard Simmons dorky-but-easy-to-follow moves which get your heart rate up effectively.
