8011936,4,B0001FUJLE,"FYI: The photo shown for this item is wrong. The photo shows the Newhart show from the 80s with Mary Frann and the Stratford Inn (incredibly terrific show!). The item in this listing is actually for the Bob Newhart show from the 70s, also a good show.",1319155200,,251,4.361702127659575
8011937,4,B0001FUJLE,"""The Bob Newhart Show"" was part of what is arguably the greatest Saturday night lineup of all-time when CBS had not only it but ""All in the Family,"" ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" and ""The Carol Burnett Show.""  Obviously Saturday night was not the least watched night of television back then like it is today.  Newhart played Dr. Robert Hartley, a Chicago psychologist living with this schoolteacher wife Emily (Suzanne Pleshette), his neighbor Howard Borden (Billy Daily) a clueless airplane navigator.  Bob best friend is Dr. Jerry Robinson (Peter Bonerz), an orthodontist who works on the same floor of Bob's office building, where they share a receptionist, Carol Kester (Marcia Wallace).

""Bob Newhart Show Double Episode Volume 2"" offers up a pair of early episodes from the comedian's classic television sitcom (the first one, not the second one).  Actually, if you were doing the complete ""Bob Newhart"" on videotape two episodes at a time this would be Volume 3 because it has episodes 5 and 6, but that is not the case.  Go figure.

Episode 5, ""Good Night Nancy"" (Written by Susan Silver, First aired October 21, 1972) has Bob being haunted by an old flame.  It seems that on his 25th birthday Bob was dumped by his college sweetheart Nancy (Penny Fuller).  Now Nancy is in town with her husband, Chuck (Richard Schaal) and wants to see her beloved ""Bobby"" again.  Bob does not know if he should be more worried about what Emily thinks or by Chuck's idea of taking his two-wood and driving Bob's head 400 yards if he has lunch with Nancy.  Just calling Newhart ""Bobby"" is enough to make you laugh, but what really works here is the idea that Bob was a stud muffin once upon a time.  Notice also this is the first episode in which no one says ""Hi, Bob.""

Episode 6, ""Come Love With Me"" (Written by Jerry Maye, First aired October 28, 1972), shifts the love troubles to Carol (who says ""Hi, Bob"" twice), who falls for Roger Dixon (Eugene Troobnik), the guy who sells Bob his Kleenex.  Of course, Roger is married, and while Carol really believes the man she loves will divorce his wife, that is before Bob helps the couple to reconcile.  Otherwise, Carol would end up being Carol Kester-Dixon and that is not as funny as Carol Kester-Bondurant.  It is really too early to tell this story, because Carol is still primarily comic relief (then again, everybody but Bob is on one his shows).

Neither of these episodes is a true classic, but the first one is heading in the right direction.  Keep in mind that this is very early on and the show is still trying to figure out the characters.  In terms of Bob's patients, James B. Sikking shows up as Dick in the first one and John Fielder makes his first appearance as Emil Peterson is the second.  I have been of fan of Fiedler ever since I saw him in ""The Odd Couple"" movie (mainly because he is one of those rare actors whose voice is pitched higher than my own).  Remember him in ""True Grit"" where he played lawyer J. Noble Daggett?  The common denominator in the episodes is that Jack Bernardi plays the waiter for both restaurant scenes.",1111622400,2,3093,4.605839416058394
