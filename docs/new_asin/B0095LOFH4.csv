The included bonuses covering composition, lighting, portrait, etc. make this DVD an absolute bargain.",1392076800,3,276,5.155555555555556
8536182,5,B0095LOFH4,"I loved this video. There was a lot of information and it was so informative. I am a visual person and so I  think its great to have a video that is well executed,and to be able to teach me all about my camera. I love that there is so much more that is included than just information about the camera. Would be great for any skill level. I highly recommend this video to anyone who is interested in learning a lot of new things.",1382140800,3,428,4.035294117647059
