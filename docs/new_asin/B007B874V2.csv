8513707,5,B007B874V2,"This double CD documents an impromptu house concert featuring two of the most illustrious vocalists of carnatic (South Indian classical) music in the last century, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and M.S. Subbulakshmi. There is no percussion here except the occasional clapping of hands; there is no violin support. Instead the singers are accompanied by another doyen of carnatic music, the vainika K. S. Narayanaswamy - imparting a feel of what vocal sessions might have sounded like in the old days, before the introduction of the violin in the seventeenth century, when singers were accompanying themselves on the veena. Semmangudi's nasal voice was once described by a fellow musician as the noise created when a coconut shell is scraped on a rock. To me it is one of the most glorious voices not only of carnatic music, but in the entire musical universe. In this recording it blends perfectly with Subbulakshmi's sweet and equally bhakti oriented style of singing - blending as it is written in the liner notes, ""like saffron with milk"".
It is almost impossible to single out a highlight among the ten songs of this performance, as all of them are really outstanding! Even so I will venture to mention two wonderful renditions of songs by Trinity composers. In ""Kamakshi"" by Shyama Sastri (Raga Bhairavi) the depth and emotional power of Semmangudi's singing has almost reached unbearable proportions when he suddenly interrupts the flow of bhakti with a joke - as was allegedly his habit. A perfect example of Indian mentality where humour and seriousness are equally valuable, and the opposites are allowed to exist side by side, not exclusive of each other as in the western world. Another highlight is the Ragam Alapana of Thyagaraja's composition ""Chakkani Rajamargamu"" in Raga Kharaharapriya.
If I were allowed to bring just ten musical recordings with me to an uninhabited island, this double CD from Swathi's Sanskriti Series would definitely be one of them!",1383955200,,1967,5.111801242236025
