The genre which he continues to reinvent to his own taste and it always works. While not his best film, it is still much better than most people's best. He makes other horror directors look like children and this has to be hard to do considering Japan has some of the best horror films out there. Personally, I love this movie. I had to watch it on Youtube because it's not available on Amazon (ahem-hem). To make a modern day horror film about a mummy is brave in my opinion. But that concept is what drew me to this movie. That and having seen and purchased most of Kurosawa's work. Upon watching the movie however, the viewer sees that the movie isn't just about a mummy. There's so many elements to this film and it scared me yet I was smiling when I watched it because I was so happy to find a great horror film. It's a shame that more horror films aren't like this. There's really nothing cliche about the movie at all. It's also a shame that it's unavailable because I could watch it everyday. I hope someone reads this and makes it happen. Or, maybe, someone will read this and watch the movie and feel the way I do. If you like original, non-cheesy, intelligent horror with a slow pace and beautiful camerawork AND great acting, Loft and every other Kurosawa horror film is for you.",1343692800,,1396,4.4147286821705425
