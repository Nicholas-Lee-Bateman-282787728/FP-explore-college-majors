8000790,3,6305837376,"Bruce Brown is the most famous surf film artist dating back to the late 50s where his films were shown in small auditoriums.  This is his second film in the last 50s.  Bruce narrates and has a friendly personality.  The background music is good but not the typical surf sound to be found three years later.  Watch this film to view history.  Recognize this is 50s surfing and it's very good but very dated.  The surfing was amazingly good for the type boards they used.  But still, this is very dated and I found that it didn't hold my interest like other movies like the 70s Bustin Down the Door.  Not bad, but very dated.",1307750400,,623,4.356521739130435
8000791,4,6305837376,"Of all the non-""Endless Summer"" films in the Bruce Brown Golden Years of Surf Collection, this one has always been my favorite.  This is my third time to purchase this movie (my previous two VHS copies were worn out  from use at parties). It lacks everything a ""quality"" film  requires - and yet it beats the mainstream by a mile.  If you want to feel  like you were there (Mazatlan or the North Shore) and you love vintage surf  movies, this is it.  Pure, honest, classic.  This is a must for true soul  surfers.  (Why only 4 stars? Two words: ""Endless Summer"" - only  ES gets a 5.)",963446400,36,583,4.305555555555555
