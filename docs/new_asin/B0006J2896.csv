2189721,5,B0006J2896,"I bought this DVD for my two year old twin girls who absolutely love Disney charachters. I was amazed at how much I liked the movies myself as well. It brought me back to my early childhood when my brother and I watched all of these same types of movies.

This Goofy DVD has some real great classics as well as a couple of not so well known cartoons; all of which are fun and entertaining for children of all ages. The sound quality and picture quality are great.",1237248000,3,463,4.202247191011236
2189722,4,B0006J2896,"Every volume in this series has only a small number of cartoons on each disc (about 9 each).  They are excellent cartoons, but the small number of cartoons leaves you wanting for more.",1212969600,2,184,4.575757575757576
2189723,5,B0006J2896,My kids absolutely LOVE this DVD!  All of the short films keep their attention (they are 3 & 2) much better than a full length movie does.  They laugh at Goofy and it's so funny to watch them enjoy a Disney character that I can remember watching when I was growing up.,1211846400,5,268,4.134615384615385
2189724,5,B0006J2896,This DVD is great.  I bought it for my daughter because I remeber how much I loved these cartoons when I was her age. She watches these cartoons and just laughs the entire time.,1186617600,2,177,4.205882352941177

2189726,5,B0006J2896,"Goofy is hilarious. when I used to to watch him alot as a kid on Disney I couldn't help but laugh at his type of antics for humor. it was so stupid it was funny. he really touches kids too . even in his short cartoons. I would recommend everyone give Goofy a chance. young or old. you're never too young or too old for cartoons. enjoy what you will

When I got this on Dvd I was so happy. Walt Disney and others created some amazing toon characters.",1109116800,12,449,4.044943820224719
2189727,4,B0006J2896,"Here's a quandry.  I would definitely say you should buy the Disney Treasures Complte Goofy set since all of the shorts on this DVD are in the Treasures set.  You get EVERY Goofy short in that Treasures Set.  Trouble is it's out of print now and only available in the seconday market.  If you can get that at a resonable price then that is your best bet.

This is a very good DVD however containing 9 Goofy shorts made in the 1940's and 1950's.  it includes several of Goofy's ""how to"" series where Goofy takes part in the demonstration and a narrrator does the voice over.  These include: How to Dance, How to Swim, how to Fish, and The Art of Skiing.  These are all quite funny.

It's worth the $12 or so but any Goofy fan should try and find the Complete Goofy set if possible.",1105401600,35,780,4.2517006802721085

2189751,5,B0006J2896,"I bought this DVD because I used to watch the ""how to ski"" episode several times every Christmas when I was a kid.  I was surprised hat how good the picture was.  I expected it to not be that good since it is SO old.  The sound is not great though.  I can understand what is being said but not sure if my two little ones can.  I'm not really complaining though, because I'm not sure anything can be done for the sound, once again, because it's so old.  I can say that I am excited I could find that episode that I loved so much when I was young, so I am happy.",1388707200,2,560,3.8684210526315788

2189756,4,B0006J2896,"The biggies I wanted were the ""how tos"" like 'The Art of Skiing', 'How to Fish', 'How to Dance', etc.  They were as funny as I expected and worth the cost of the DVD.  There were a few that felt like filler like 'The Big Wash' but I wouldn't expect just the big hits on this DVD.  Classic Disney, classic Goofy, and if you like that you'd probably like the whole thing.  If you are new to Classic Disney some of these may seem a little hokey but the How Tos are still funny, although the pace and the jokes have a different feel than today's 'tunes.",1373932800,,549,4.102803738317757

2189764,3,B0006J2896,"I was expecting Goofy to be the main character but this DVD is more about the announcer.  It is a bit sarcastic and over my sons head.  So, if you are a mom shopping for cartoons I would recommend Donald, Mickey, and the Chip & Dales of this series.  Which are Volumes 1, 2, & 4. I am glad I purchased it for our family collection it just wasn't as ""Goofy"" as I expected.",1307577600,,371,3.9864864864864864
