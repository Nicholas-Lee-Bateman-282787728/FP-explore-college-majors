7971257,1,B00006L945,The CD I received would not play on my CD player. I tried numerous times but nothing happened. The other CD's I ordered worked fine so it wasn't my CD player,1360886400,2,157,4.096774193548387
7971258,2,B00006L945,The music itself is well done. Too many slow (and somewhat boring) songs. A lot of talent displayed by all...just not what i was hoping to hear.,1359504000,2,144,4.37037037037037
7971259,4,B00006L945,"There are some great worship tunes on here! Some are telecast before large churches and a few in more intimate settings, but all are great songs. Just be aware that this is far from HD due to the cameras and when it was recorded.",1355270400,3,229,4.2272727272727275
7971260,5,B00006L945,"These ""Songs 4 Worship"" DVDs are a God-send for anyone dissatisfied with the current state of Christian worship music.  In retrospect we can see that the late 1990s really were a golden age of contemporary worship.  The spirit of performance had not yet infected the church and the songs reflected a genuine passion for God.  The music and lyrics were simple and the message was direct: hearts connecting with their maker.  No special effects were necessary.  Pure worship brought the power of the Spirit.  These 3 DVDs are an amazing value.  Each contains about an hour and 20 minutes of live performances by Don Moen, Paul Wilbur, Darlene Zschech, Alvin Slaughter, Benny Hinn, Women of Faith, Twila Paris and Ron Kenoly.  The production values are excellent.  The sound quality is terrific on a surround system.  Highlights range from a rousing rendition of ""Ancient of Days"" to ""Shout to the Lord"" performed by Darlene Zschech, Alvin Slaughter and Ron Kenoly to the heavy anointing on Paul Wilbur's ""Let the Weight of Your Glory Fall"" to giant choirs singing ""Crown Him King of Kings"" and ""Hear Our Praises"".  It makes you hungry for more.",1289520000,15,1142,4.895833333333333
