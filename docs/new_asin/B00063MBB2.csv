The DVD is pretty short, and there is no way to play each segment one after another from start to finish.  You must click on each segment to get it to play, and since no one segment is that long, it feels like you're constantly clicking through the menu to get to the content.  I just feel that if they were going to go to the trouble to put out a DVD, they could have put more material on it.

That said, I liked the music videos, and I'm hoping that a live concert DVD will someday be released.",1100736000,6,578,4.0
