7781126,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"I love both of the DVDs in this set.  Disc 1 has two different kinds of fireplaces Vivid and Big Log. Both give you choices of sounds - fire sounds and music. In all cases of fireplaces, I REALLY prefer the actual fire sounds. I don't want music to be playing while I could be listening to the actual fire. Thats what I like to hear  the crackling and popping of a fireplace. I also like that it encompasses the whole TV screen. Just two wonderful videos of fireplaces.

Disc 2 is a set of two aquariums and you have your choice of bubbles, water, and piano music. Whatever you choose, its so soothing and takes me away from any stress I may be having. The first aquarium is peaceful with the gentle movement of the coral and fish. The music is quiet so it doesnt interfere with your enjoyment of the tank. Personally, I prefer the 2nd aquarium, so many fish in an array of beautiful colors  I am especially fascinated by tropical reef aquariums. I could just sit and watch the fish and coral endlessly. It settles my mind. Normally I prefer nature sounds, but with an aquarium, the soft piano music (which is on the first aquarium) is best for me. As for the second aquarium, the music is louder, and I just decided that I didn't need any sound at all on that one. That worked out fine for me.

This is a great 2 disc set if you're into fireplaces and/or aquariums.",1470528000,5,1366,4.299610894941634
7781127,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"The DVD set is really great. Here you have not only fireplaces for a cozy evening at home but also relaxing aquarium scenes. What I like best is that you can play both DVDs with natural sounds or music. Personally, I like the sounds of nature best, the fire and the aquariums seem even more real with its many colorful fish. I also like that you can see the fire burn down, it even makes all more realistic.",1469232000,,407,4.230769230769231
7781128,5,B01H7JGGQ8,I have used these crackling fire DVD and fish with live bubbling to relax me at night when I cannot sleep right away. They are as if I am sitting in front of the fire (wish I could feel the heat too) ....reading my favorite book. Or I am mesmerized by the relaxing view of the various fish swimming carefree in my virtual aquarium. These DVD's are so worth the price.,1513814400,,367,4.183098591549296

7781131,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"I absolutely love these DVDs. We live in Southern California and most of the time, having a fire is not possible (unless you want your house to feel like an oven). I missed having a fire during the holidays and this totally made up for it. Love the crackling of the real looking fire or you can choose to play the music version (without crackle). The aquarium one is ok. Other reviewers are right....one aquarium has too many fish and one has too little fish, not to mention theres a bully fish in one tank that keeps picking on the other fish...LOL!!  Other then that, the fish tank one is relaxing. You will not regret this purchase and great price for 2.",1512172800,,657,4.385245901639344

7781135,5,B01H7JGGQ8,I drive an executive limo that has a large screen TV in it. I was looking for something to soothe and calm my clients while traveling. This DVD is perfect with both the fireplace and the aquarium. I like the feature that one can have either background music or actual wood-burning fire sounds or aquarium sounds.  It is so restful.,1483920000,3,331,4.516666666666667

7781137,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"Did a lot of research and review-reading to get this right - for loved ones who know well, and very much miss, the experience of a real fire in a fireplace.  Just what I wanted - gave 2 of these as Christmas gifts this year. Real logs that burn down over a period of hours, real burning sounds, very very relaxing to watch and have as ambience - and it loops for long play.  One of my family members opened it on Christmas eve - as I'd hoped he would - and said he played it continuously for two days at Christmas!  Haven't tried the Fish yet, I expect the quality to be the same.",1483056000,4,580,4.026086956521739
7781138,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"The disc was great! Bought it to use on Christmas AM and it didn't let us down. The fire fit the aspect ratio on both of our TVs. The crackling fire sounds were nice. The one thing I was concerned about was how long the clip would last b/c I didn't want to keep restarting the DVD, but it just looped through 4 tracks continuously. The fire would die down then go right to the next clip, so you always had a fire burning.",1482883200,6,421,4.023809523809524
7781139,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"OMG. I love this. The logs actually burn down-like a real fire. The music is annoying, so I just listen to the fire sounds.  Ahhhhh......

Not crazy about the aquarium. One has too many fish, one has too few. I'll try it again' maybe I'll like it later",1481846400,,252,4.229166666666667

7781141,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"There are two separate DVD's here; one is the fireplace, which has the natural fire sounds available but also a music background as an alternative.  The different fires go from start to embers, and are very well done.  The second DVD is of tropical aquariums: both are available with water sounds, bubble sounds or music.  Both of them have plenty of activity, and are excellent.  For the price, it is hard to beat",1479513600,,414,4.63013698630137
7781142,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"We absolutely love the DVD'S. We bought them for our new camper and it has increased our joy tenfold.  We ordered them online on the way home from buying the camper and did not think we would get them in time for our first venture.  Awesomely enough, they arrived in three days, one day before our departure.  The fire actually burns down over time and turns to ashes.  As for the Fishtank being included with the purchase, it was divine intervention as we have a saltwater aquarium at home and now we have one in our camper as well.  Thank you Ambient Collection.  Your product and service are better than 5-star.",1479427200,4,614,4.486486486486487

7781144,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"Bought this at the request of my in-laws (MIL and FIL). They love it! They have an apartment basement now with no fireplace, and so they really enjoy winding down in the evenings, with a cup of coffee, while listening to the crackling of the fireplace. The aquarium is nice too, but they really love the fireplace.",1477008000,2,314,4.526315789473684

7781146,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"Great to have fireplace videos and aquarium videos in one box! What I love most is that the fires start from the beginning and then completely burn down, leaving soft glowing embers, just like the real deal. And I get to choose to play a fire with relaxing music, which I love! or with the real sounds of crackling wood for an even more realistic experience. For every mood an option!
The aquarium videos are a natural decoration in my living room that I play when Im working, reading or cleaning up or when friends come over. They are colorful and relaxing and you can choose to play the video with calming music or aquarium bubbles.
The images are crystal clear, the music is romantic and relaxing and the sounds are realistic. Im a fan!",1474070400,2,739,4.481481481481482
7781147,5,B01H7JGGQ8,"Relaxing, HQ static video scenes designed to turn your TV into a virtual fireplace or an aquarium. The fireplace disc has two fire videos and two different soundtracks to choose from - crackling fire (very realistic sound) or soft piano music. Very soothing - all the visual benefits of a cozy fire without the fuss! The second disc in this set features two long aquarium scenes and your choice of ""new age"" classical piano, bubbling aquarium or trickling water audio to accompany the visuals. Tank one is a lovely community fish tank with an array of small, peaceful freshwater fish (I spotted mollies, tetras and neons). The second tank is a colorful African cichlid tank.
