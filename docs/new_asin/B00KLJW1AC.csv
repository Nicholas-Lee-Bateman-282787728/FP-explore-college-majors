8659745,1,B00KLJW1AC,"This movie is horrible. It's free market propaganda and incredibly racist. It's so racist.
It's not even so-bad-its-funny. It's just bad. It will make you feel dirty. Thank goodness I had some liquor before I saw it.
Don't do it to yourself. Runaway now and runaway fast.",1411689600,,271,4.787234042553192
8659746,4,B00KLJW1AC,"Rise Up Black Man is an independent feature that touches upon a range of socially pertinent subjects. In short it is the story of corruption, passion, blackmail and true friendship. It is also a story of challenge and inspiration. It is the story of friendship between two men  Gary, and Will.  Both have just finished college, and both are trying to figure out what their next steps in life will be.

Gary, a 24 year old white man who views life as just a fun trip. He has trouble caring for others and drinks too much.

Will is a young black man with high standards and moral convictions. He has a good heart and wants to impact the world in a positive way.  He cares of his aging grandmother who helped raise him, and he cares about kids. He likes helping others.

Garys life takes a sudden change when he meets Smack, a young street-smart kid. His attachment grows and this relationship helps him to see a new perspective on life. Will becomes involved with an association called the Risen Foundation, a group operating under the curtain of God and religion. But what is really going on is a shake-down of companies, church members and the black race. Will becomes more and more entrenched with the groups leader, the Rev. Franklyn J. King, and he fails to see what is really going on.

If you like indie film, this is a good choice with a positive story line.",1401408000,,1364,4.475806451612903
