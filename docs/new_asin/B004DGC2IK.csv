8425316,5,B004DGC2IK,"This DVD covers desert survival by focusing on prevention and preparation which, , I would argue, are more important for travel and recreation in that environment than in the forest.  The key point is that there are generally more resources and people in the forest than the desert. Generally, people have more experience traveling, living, and recreating in the forest as well.  These considerations should lead you to search for the knowledge presented on this DVD.  After you watch this, I recommend Ron Hoods' DVD on desert survival.",1357862400,3,537,5.079545454545454

As I have a son currently serving in Afghanistan, the chapter titled ""Tips for Troops Deploying Overseas"" is especially appreciated.

Production values: although this isn't the most important part of a life or death survival video, the top quality production values, music, scenery and overall sound and visuals make this an easy to watch DVD.

Ideally, desert travelers should sign up for and experience one of Tony's outstanding survival courses in person. If you can't do that, this DVD is the next best thing.

For those who live in the desert or are just planning a visit, this video is highly recommended. It for sure will make your trip safer and more enjoyable. It could also save a life.",1293148800,6,1224,5.187817258883249
