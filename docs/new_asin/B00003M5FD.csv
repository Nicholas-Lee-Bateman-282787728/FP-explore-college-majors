7919133,5,B00003M5FD,"Remember when Nickelodeon used to play movies every Sunday?  I watched some great movies on it, like the first and best Prehysteria, Doom Runners, Magic Island (I didn't actually watch it on Nick, I saw it before on the Disney Channel & was excited to see it again so I recorded it, but dumped the recording when Nick cut off the ending; strangely in my recording collection I found a recording of it from an airing on the Disney Channel) Dragonworld (I had seen it before on VHS, & loved it so much I gladly watched it again) and this gem (now I'm especially glad I still have a VCR).  The funny thing was, I didn't know what it was called until years later.  For some reason, Nickelodeon didn't advertise it, at least not to my knowledge.  Even when I used a thing I had on a remote to check what was playing it didn't register.  So I tuned in one Sunday afternoon after the title had passed & didn't know what to expect.  As soon as the phoenix appeared, I was hooked.  Peter Ustinov deserves credit for giving a great voice performance for the character.  His distinguished voice always reminded me of Virgil from the awesome cartoon Mighty Max, voiced by Tony Jay.  After it was over, I did my hardest to find out what it was called.  I found this tape years later at a drug store, but then after only having it for a year or 2 my VCR chewed it up (please note that the VCR I keep ranting about is not the one I play my tapes in now) & I've searched for it at thrift stores ever since.  But now I have it again, & will take very good care of it.",1378252800,,1550,4.167785234899329
