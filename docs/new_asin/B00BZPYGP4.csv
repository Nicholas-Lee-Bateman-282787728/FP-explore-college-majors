5683186,5,B00BZPYGP4,"This 2 hour lesson will give you VALUABLE and PRACTICAL information on fast track motor skills to evade and counter unwanted physical advances and common aggressive moves to protect yourself from damage...rapidly prevail over aggression...and escape to safety.  You do not need prior kickboxing,karate, trapping or grappling skills.  Several female students ranging from their 20's to 40's demonstrate effective skills under Mr. Worden's coaching.  (Yes, you do need to practice a bit...learning any new motor skill requires some reps.)  A couple of male students of college age also demonstrate on this video. (could come in handy should the trek to physics lab cross fraternity row, especially shortly after the football team loses (or wins) their latest contest, just sayin').

This gentleman is a legitimate subject matter expert. You would be well advised to learn from him.",1392422400,4,879,5.4338235294117645
5683187,5,B00BZPYGP4,"You are an ordinary personscrambling to make ends meet, not in the best of shape, not ready to commit to spending the next ten years in a dojo four days a week in order to master a complex system of martial arts that might not even prove to be what you need in order to survive on the street.

Yet you do not want to become a victim. Nor do you want to shirk the responsibility to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from predators. While you are looking around for a reputable self-defense instructor in your area, you can acquire sound protective skillsskills that you can put to use immediatelyby taking a few minutes a day to watch these videos and practice with a training partner.

The criteria for a truly practical system of self-protection can be summed up as follows:
 a pro-active mindset, generating preventive actions that minimize the likelihood of life-threatening encounters;
 a relatively small number of movements that can be easily learned and applied in a wide range of circumstances;
 sound principles to guide the course of training and provide the basis of a defensive strategy in situations of extreme stress;
 methods of training that instill proven tactics and good body mechanics that the beginner can acquire quickly, in a step-by-step manner.

Kelly Wordens Personal Protection Program delivers the goods. Together with the paperback book that outlines the system, the two discs of P3 provide a solid base upon which anyone, young or old, can build an effective repertoire of defensive tactics that can be adapted to his or her own unique body type and personal attributes. Simple drills and a logical training progression allow you to move forward at your maximum staying speed.

Throughout Mr. Wordens long career, as a practitioner and teacher of martial arts, self-defense, and military combatives, he has maintained an unswerving devotion to what is truly useful in maximizing the likelihood of survival on the street. His ability to discard the fluff and teach the right stuff perfectly qualifies him to put together a course that works for people like you & me.  I highly recommend this package.",1390003200,,2134,4.93854748603352
5683188,5,B00BZPYGP4,"I have many other self-defense DVDs in my collection that I thought were pretty good, but now I realize that they have just been wannabes produced for wannabe tough guys. I love that this DVD is made for regular people, and shares techniques that regular people can do well enough to protect themselves effectively. If you want a martial arts program that you can show off with, this DVD is not for you, because this program is all about avoiding violence unless the only choice is to counter violence with your own determined violence. Don't forget to get the book that goes with program too. I'm buying this for my wife and daughters this Christmas, and for my Scout Troop as well..",1384300800,6,684,4.614754098360656
5683189,5,B00BZPYGP4,"I'm not one who always write reviews but this is one that I think I should share. I have always felt that the skills taught in martial arts did not make me feel like I could defend myself in a bad situation. This was especially since as a woman, I have less muscle mass and upper body strength. So the punches and kicks that were taught always made me wonder how well I would be able to deliver them, and in fact whether I would be able to remember some of the more complex moves.  Then I found Kelly Worden's Personal Protection Program, and I am impressed at how much hitting power I can now generate with my elbows, or how much damage I can do with my fingers in the right places. These lessons are instinctive and intuitive, surprisingly easy to learn and really hard to forget. I'm definitely buying it for all my girlfriends this Xmas.",1380067200,11,841,4.322784810126582
5683190,5,B00BZPYGP4,"My husband purchased this DVD for me as a gift.
Kelly Worden's Personal Protection Program provided me with detailed instructions for a variety of self defence techniques.
The techniquies were easy to follow for some one with no martial arts training.
The program was done in a logical systematic order.
I feel that I have gained valuable knowledge for defending myself if the situation should arise.
I would recommend the Personal Protection Program for any one looking for a practical self defence program.

5683191,5,B00BZPYGP4,"I am a martial artist and I have been interested in women's self defense since 2006. I have come to believe very strongly that it is up to each person as an individual to actively participate in their own protection and I am happy to see this view demonstrated in Kelly Worden's Personal Protection Program. The lessons are informal, easy-going and are produced so that a viewer with no previous skill can practice on their own or with a partner. The skills are also arranged in a way that is easy to teach with. This is where I will personally get the most use from P3.

In following up my interest in women's self-defense I have come across individuals who do not have the time to devote years of study to martial arts. Kelly Worden's foundations are easy to pick up and practice and they are effective. The casual tone makes the lessons easy to follow and do not require physical prowess, athletics, endurance or a certain body type to be successful.

For people who do not wish to be violent, Kelly Worden's Personal Protection Plan focuses on escape tactics, yet still offers tools for a more aggressive defense to create opportunities for escape.

Finally, I've met women who are afraid of confrontations or deny that they will ever be in a situation that endangers them or others. While it would be a lovely world to live without violence, being prepared is not the same as giving in to paranoia. Awareness is up to each of us, and infinitely better than denial. Kelly Worden shows that any situation--even a very frightening one--can be dealt with in a way that is positive for the defender, leading to escape or safety. If you find yourself in a confrontation you are *NOT* helpless and you *DO* possess the skills to survive. The skills are simple and easy to learn. Kelly Worden exemplifies this and I strongly believe in this. I would like to share this concept with everyone, and P3 is a very useful resource for starting on that path.

I highly recommend this DVD-set to any person interested in learning practical self-defense. It is an excellent foundation of skills and philosophy and enough to get started with. And I would recommend this to anyone interested in sharing their knowledge of self-defense with their loved ones but don't yet know how to pass on that information.",1379894400,17,2294,4.684863523573201
5683192,5,B00BZPYGP4,I found this DVD set very useful. The lessons are easy to follow and very effective.  Perfect for someone who has no martial arts training and a great teaching tool for those who do. This is well suited for women and teens. Great at any skill level. Professor Worden keeps things light during the instruction in these DVDs. Making it fun while learning alot of important tools for personal defense.  I highly recomend these DVDs to anyone wanting to protect themselves and family.,1378857600,,480,4.771084337349397
5683193,5,B00BZPYGP4,"Kelly Wordens Personal Protection Package DVD is an excellent training aid for anyone interested in self-defense, novice and experienced martial artists alike.  The DVD is well organized into training modules and each self-defense technique is clearly demonstrated and explained.  The tactics and techniques presented on the DVD are appropriate for those newly interested in developing self-defense skills as well as those seeking to review or refresh existing skills.  Mr. Worden is one of the most skilled practitioners and instructors of practical martial arts.  His techniques were developed for ordinary people to defend themselvesyou don't have to be Bruce Lee or an MMA fighter to execute them.  Full disclosure, I first met Mr. Worden 20 years ago when he was teaching Air Force Airmen and have trained with him periodically throughout this period.  Hes trained thousands of Air Force and Army Special Forces throughout this period on combat skills including hand-to-hand, knife, and improvised weaponry.  Ive had a lot of military instruction and can vouch for the instructional quality of this DVD as well as the applicability of the content.  Overall, this DVD is a great bargain for the money.",1374883200,9,1205,5.338624338624339
5683194,5,B00BZPYGP4,"Everything I know about Professor Kelly Worden is nothing short of Impressive.  Obviously success leaves clues and I  OWN NUMEROUS DVD's from Professor!  I am writing this review with an upcoming FOLLOW-UP that will breakdown the DVD once I receive it and watch it.  But for the most part, I wanted to at least put it out there that I am buying this DVD from the credentials of Professor Kelly Worden ALONE and having worked with Professor himself.  It is 4 stars ONLY because I haven't received it yet.  And it would only be fair for me to give a follow-up on my review once done!

Post Review once Product received:

I received my DVD and had a chance to go through the material.  At first, I thought the DVD wouldn't speak to me as much being an experienced Martial Artist, especially one who has gone to Professor Kelly Worden's Seminars.  But I was rather impressed AGAIN at how Professor brings in what we already know or DON'T know, into a manner that speaks to EVERYONE.  For the experienced person with classical training, you see the lines, the moves, and the angles that Professor shows and how he explains the theory behind these classical movements and its simplification.  A Muay Thai Artist, Filipino Martial Arts practitioner, a boxer, etc... will have light bulbs go off in their heads and smile as they recognize these patterns and movements in their respective arts.  It will seem simple and yet you can appreciate the deep thought process put into it.  Much Respect!

And As a beginner who is looking for self defense and personal protection you get a culmination of moves that have practicality and sense!  You don't have to attend classes and rank up, instead you are given the right to have the knowledge to protect yourself and your family.  You can sense that when Professor Kelly speaks about that topic which is near and dear to his heart and how adamant he is about being a bodyguard 24/7.

WHO DO I RECOMMEND THIS TO?

I recommend this for personal use, for a gift to someone you love, for any martial artist looking to ""CONNECT the SYSTEMS"" that they are practicing in or already know.......basically for everyone!  It's done and presented in that manner.

SOME COOL THINGS ABOUT THE DVD!!
What was really cool was seeing that there was no PAUSE or STOP in the teaching and thought process.  Professor didn't stop the camera and get upset if a move wasn't perfectly executed as he used different models with different experiences and backgrounds to demo.  With the models being all kinds of shapes, sizes, and experience levels; He allowed them to freely express what they were learning on the spot!  And when Professor saw a slightly different move, he explained where and why that person did that!  He Commended them on it, never reprimanded them saying it was WRONG but rather showed them efficiency and best practices.  He then addressed why it happened the way it did.  That made for authenticity in the making, kept true to REALITY BASED Training, and made it personal for ANYONE viewing it to feel human and realize you DO NOT have to be a martial artist.

THank you Professor Worden for Giving us the opportunity to Spread a basic right to protecting oneself and our families!

As Mr. Worden says in the introduction, if someone were to assault you and take off with your wallet, then they would also have your driver's license with your address on it.
