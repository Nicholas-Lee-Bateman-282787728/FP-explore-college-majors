1280665,3,B00003CXKP,"I don't usually always agree with critics and their negative reviews for movies I might wish to attend so I usually try to go and see for myself.  I have often found in the past, what they classify as ""sleepers"" often turn out to be pretty good.  Unfortunately, after having been to this one, I have to agree with most reviews.
the only reason I went was because my favorite country artist, Randy Travis, also stars in this film, not nearly as much as i would have liked but because of his performance, i've probably even rated this higher than i would have.
I don't want to be the judge of others but it is as some have stated pretty much like any other western - shoot 'em up, move 'em out to the next encounter.  I just felt the entire story plot was strange and much more violence than  I would have liked - not only the shooting but also a couple of hangings.
Perhaps some will enjoy this type of thing; as for me, not so.  Will I buy the movie if it comes out...yes, but only because i am a collector of Randy Travis items.  Would I pay to see it again...no.
As the Dallas Morning News said, they probably hired Randy to fully add credibility to the ""goings on.""  If there is some truth to that, they probably knew they would need someone like him and people like me to get viewers...and it worked.
I am not indicating others should not go - I'm only advising of the violence and some sexuality and the fact that personally, I did not enjoy it.

This is the story of the Texas Rangers cleaning up border between the US and Mexico.  Dylan McDermott stars as Captain Leander McNelly, the preacher and Ranger, and Robert Patrick as Sgt John Armstrong, lead a ragtag group of newbies to find King Fisher (Alfred Molina).

James Van Den Beek stars as Lincoln Rogers Dennison, McNelly's scribe and conscience.  Van Den Beek's performance is understated and quiet, perfect for the part.  Cigar chomping country singer Randy Travis is there with little to do with the movie.  He seldom even speaks which is a tragedy since his voice lends credence to the culture of the American Southwest.

""The Texas Rangers"" is a little like ""The Patriot"" in that it involves land, shooting, revenge, and Americans coming together to fight armed intruders.  ""The Texas Rangers"" puts the focus on a time in Texas history when violent gangs rode into towns and took what they wanted and killed anyone they felt like killing.  The Rangers banded together to stop them.  It's a violent story, yes, but it's rooted in American history.  Also, there are some very good actors in this movie, and I was pleased to see that Randy Travis was in it. Any movie that is tied to American history and keeps the viewer interested is worth seeing.

1281086,4,B00003CXKP,"TEXAS RANGERS

When I was little my grandfather made me a fan of westerns, he introduced these films to me and I have been a fan since. So from time to time the mood hits me and I dig into the crates for a western. One day upon doing so I picked up this flick since I live in Texas and the Rangers actually are a real thing. In fact the people in this story are based on real people but the flick is not accurate with all the facts. That's ok though since it is an entertaining movie.

The story follows Leander McNelly 10 years after the Civil War at a time when he is asked by the governor of Texas to bring back the Texas Rangers. John King Fisher is stealing cattle from some wealthy people and taking them across the border. So McNelly brings back a few guys who used to be Rangers alongside him but the majority of the new group are a bunch of young new guys who need a lot of training. This lack of training and the over confidence of the veterans leads to a slaughter during the first attempt to stop King and his gang. So after such a big loss will they be able to pull together to get the job done, or will the outlaws reign supreme.

Now this is not the greatest western film ever made but it is a fun one. The actors here do a great job in the film and over all it is a fun flick. The storyline here is an interesting one and the film moves at a good pace so it never seems to slow down. Still it is not a perfect flick and I will admit that, although I did really enjoy the film. The script could have used some work and the acting at times seems off, even still I liked this flick.

James Van Der Beek is not annoying here like some have said; I thought he played the role well. Usher of R&B fame as some of you may know him is good here as well. Still I think he was better in ""Light it Up"", but as the film goes on he seems to settle into the role. Ashton Kutcher is very Ashton Kutcherish in this film but the character called for it I guess. Alfred Molina is great as always and Randy Travis is great as well, he of course is another singer on the film, country. Still my favorite here is Dylan McDermott; something about the character is cool to me.

Now like I said earlier this is based on real people and events but the story does take liberties. These of course can be found here on the internet. But this is a movie and it is all about entertainment which thankfully this flick is. Like I said earlier this is not the best movie out there but it is a good one. I also like the ending of this flick, kinda reminds me of ""The Alamo"" flicks except reversed, if that makes sense.",1332806400,,2599,4.0

This 2001 film shows how an undisciplined insufficiently trained bunch of cowboys, led by a sick, dying, and embittered ex-preacher who returned from the Civil war to find his family were killed, rebuild the Texas Rangers after the war, in 1875, to fight against bandits who overrun Texas and rustel cattle.  The ex-preacher leads a small army of about two dozen men against the outlaws. One of them is a young man whose parents and brother were killed by the outlaw leader, a man who is intelligent, but can't shoot. Another is a black man who is mistreated by the ranger sergeant because of his color. The ranger captain doesn't follow the rules of law. He captures men and hangs them without trial.

1281176,1,B00003CXKP,"I will start out saying I am a native Texan and have some bias in my review of this movie.

That said, this movie is a very fragrant pile of horse manure.  The movie claims to be based on fact, and then throws all the fact out the window to tell a sickeningly PC morality tale.  Be aware that the only ""facts"" in this movie are some of the character names.

Here is a list of some of the more glaring inaccuracies:

1.  McNelly's Special Force of Rangers was not a bunch of kids.  They were mostly seasoned frontiersman, and George Durham stated in his book that the only reason he was allowed to join was that his father had served under McNelly in the Civil War.

2.  King Fisher might have been ( and probably was ) a criminal.  However he was also the elected sheriff of his county and highly thought of by many in the area.  McNelly tried to arrest him several times, but could never make it stick due to lack of evidence.  The two certainly never had a pistol duel.  King Fisher was asassinated, along with the famous gunfighter Ben Thompson, coming out of a theater in San Antonio, TX many years later.  And he certainly never massacred the citizens of a town.

3.  Captain Richard King ( called Duke in the movie) was never captured by bandits and was certainly never hung by them.  The name change is probably the result of the King Ranch not wanting anything to do with this travesty of a movie.

4.  There were no African American Rangers serving with McNelly.  The only black man with the force was the cook. ( Stereotypical, but true ) I imagine Usher's character was added to boost ticket sales and to placate Hollywood's PC paranoia.  I don't know who dreamed up the ""scout"" and ""rifleman"" ranks, but it's complete b.s., they were simply rangers.

5.  This movie was filmed in Canada, which looks nothing like South Texas.  I live in South Texas, and it is semi-arid brush country.  Not very photogenic, I assume.

6.  The main culprit behind all the unrest along the border at that time was a man named Juan Nepomuncio Cortinas.  He was a former bandit, Governor of the state of Tamualipas, and a general in the Mexican army.  The bandit gangs were encouraged and sanctioned by the Mexican government, not Anglo outlaws.

There are other gaffs, but I am tired of listing them.  My main gripe is the portrayal of McNelly and his men being loose cannons who just didn't give peace a chance.  The border was in a state of undeclared warfare at this time and McNelly did what had to be done to stop it.  He was not a cop, he and his men were soldiers.  The Rangers at that time were not a law enforcement agency, that came later.  ( They also didn't wear badges.)

In short, read George Durham's ""Taming the Nueces Strip"" or Walter P. Webb's ""The Texas Ranger's"" for the real story.  Toss the movie in the pasture for fertilizer.",1158105600,10,2841,4.415057915057915

1281178,3,B00003CXKP,"I've read quite a few books lately about the Texas Rangers, including 'Taming the Nueces Strip' by George Durham, on which this film is supposedly based, and 'Texas Ranger' by N A Jennings, on whom the character of Lincoln Rogers Dunnison is obviously based.  Jennings' book, as he himself admitted, is not wholly truthful, yet his character (Dunnison) is made the hero of the film, while Durham's character (given his real name) is a foil to Dunnison.  Jennings lasted two years in the Rangers before going back east and never rose above private (and secretary to McNelly), while Durham lasted a whole lot longer and fought alongside McNelly with distinction.  Yet in the movie Durham is made to look an excitable idiot, while Dunnison becomes a Ranger captain.  Why the scriptwriters should have chosen to do this is a mystery.

Dylan McDermott as Captain Leander McNelly gives a very good performance, as does Robert Patrick as Sergeant John Armstrong (who captured John Wesley Hardin in later years).  Alfred Molina's performance as a grinning King Fisher is neither menacing or cruel - just inept.  The real King Fisher was confronted by McNelly but always escaped justice at the time.

The young McNelly made his reputation as a leader in the Civil War and further enhanced his reputation as a Ranger captain in the Nueces Strip.  He once led a daring (and illegal) raid into Mexico to retrieve stolen Texas cattle from bandits but his men were never massacred by bandits, despite a few close shaves in Mexico.

Jesus Sandoval was a vengeful sadist, whose wife had been killed by Mexican bandits, but this character hardly figured in the movie (his gruesome exploits could not have been shown anyway).

The true story of McNelly and his rangers in the strip of land between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River in Texas has all the ingredients for a great action movie, so why did the director and scriptwriters put together this distorted tale?  I just don't get it.  I enjoyed watching the movie and was stirred by the final scene, where the rangers ride out from the Dukes (King) ranch, but all too often I was annoyed by the tampering with history and King Fisher figuring far too large in the story.",1120694400,14,2209,4.781578947368421
1281179,1,B00003CXKP,"Does anyone have any sauce for this rotted piece of meat I would like to call a film?  It has left this dry taste in my mouth that I feel only some A1 or actual oxen blood would be able to quench.  Seriously, this was one of the worst excuses for a western film that I have seen in a very long time.  I grew up watch the ""Duke"" with my father and was always impressed with the vast landscape of the uncharted America and the troubles that faces these pioneers on a daily basis.  I expect to see that same quality or better in the westerns that are made today because we have the technology to make them stronger, more entertaining, and powerful, but I guess Texas Rangers decided to go a different route.  They decided to hire a TV director and a bunch of TV stars to help create that sense of reality in the film.  So, instead of seeing Texas through the eyes of the adventuresome, we witnessed Texas through a sound stage in Hollywood as our youth of the WB whimpered in their trailers and thought about the girls of tomorrow.  Who decided on final casting for this film?  I know the Weinsteins were not behind this, or were they?  This was the biggest hurdle to overcome in this film, and while I spent most of my energy on that, I discovered that there were actually more hurdles to follow.  The story coupled with the poor production was another hit to this already devastating picture.

Let's talk about the actors that chose to place their names to this picture.  How about I actually start with a quote from Dylan McDermott from the supplemental features of this DVD.  He says something along the lines of, ""Material like this doesn't come around everyday, and when it comes to your door, you have to take it because you never know when it will be around again.""  Can we be certain he was talking about Texas Rangers?  I wonder how much he was paid for that sound bite.  The material was rated second worst behind the acting in this film.  Anyone with a 4th grade reading skill could see this.  I guess McDermott had someone else reading his work for him.  While I would say that McDermott was the only one holding this film, he continually dropped it on more than one occasion.  His character was decent, but not the greatest hero that I have seen emerge from the Mason-Dixon line.  I think what hurts him the most was that he had to work next to James Van Der Beek, who never felt like a hero to me.  I never really watched Dawson's Creek, but I have this feeling that he brought some of his character from the television show to the film.  It was embarrassing to see him act, especially during his climactic ending that seemed more like amateur night at the local bar instead of acting.  Can we be certain that this wasn't community theater we were witnessing, except with a bigger budget?  The same can be said for Randy Travis, Usher (in a very pathetic role), Kutcher (suffers miserably from miscast syndrome), and Molina (typecast for the paycheck, and it was very obvious in this film).  I think that most were so excited to be working with their friends, that they forgot that this was an actual paying role and they would need to put some work into it.  Even Rachael Leigh Cook was absurd.  Her final speech in the film had me laughing hysterically, and it wasn't intended to be funny in the least bit.  Miner completely miscast this entire film, and it is obvious from the revenue that nobody else was buying it either.

With no support from the actors the story was sure to fall, and it did.  There was nothing spectacular or original about the story.  I have even read articles that state that the overall story behind this film was false and very fabricated.  How can you take yourself seriously when you are trying to make a true story from fiction?  Only Charlie Kaufmann could successfully do this and I did not see his name anywhere on the credits.  This was a shoddy piece of workmanship that does not deserve to be called either a ""western"" or a ""adventure"" or a ""drama"".  I would only use the word ""junk"" to describe what Miner has created.

Overall, if you couldn't tell already, I didn't like this film.  From the opening credits until the futile ending it was nothing but pain souring through my eyes and mind as I watched the story unfold.  The ensamble acting proved that you could bring together all the wrong people and create 100% disaster.  Nobody in this film seemed to fit in the least bit.  With the actors completely miscast, the story seemed like wet paper.  Nothing was of any substance.  This was a poor excuse for a film, a poor excuse for history, and a poor excuse to try to appeal to the pre-teen girls of America.  Hopefully we have all learned a lesson from this and can move on without any troubles.  GULP.  I hope...

Sure, the timeline is a little wonky (think of this as McNelly's greatest hits) and takes some liberty with the history (namely McNelly's family life and his relationship with King), but those are pretty small flaws.

1281183,2,B00003CXKP,"Hot off the popularity of their television shows, James Van der Beek (Dawson's Creek) and Ashton Kutcher (That 70's Show) attempt to score big on the big screen.  That has since happened, but this film wasn't the reason why.
The producers were obviously attempting to throw quantity not quality at the big screen, since they employed a host of well known television actors and a couple of singers.  You have Dylan McDermott as the Captain in charge, Robert Patrick, Matt Keeslar, Usher Raymond, Tom Skerritt, and even Randy Travis.  As an after thought they've even thrown in Rachel Leigh Cook as the token female character.
The acting is never bad, it's just that there's really not much going on here to warrant any excitement.  You can sit and watch this film from beginning to end without blinking and you'll swear that you must have missed something.  That's what makes this simplistic film bad.
The plot is super simple:  bad men kill innocent people.  Young studly guys band together as the ""Texas Rangers"" to right the wrongs, but not for revenge.
Unfortunately, this story doesn't have oomph to make it any good.  Alfred Molina, as the bad guy, just never comes off quite as bad as he should.  The reason?  A fine actor, Molina seems to be bored and somewhat ashamed to be in such a stinker.  He does bad things but he never comes off as evil or homicidal or even psycho.  This movie really begs for a Bruce Dern in ""The Cowboys"".
And the good guys...these guys are apparently sharing one brain among the 30 of them.  In one fight scene, they come charging in a single line across the plains to a wooded area where the bad guys are holed up with tons of places to hide.  Of course the good guys are masacred.  Since no one bother to introduce us to any of the good guys beyond the major players, we really can't care too much if any of the good guys get killed.  In fact, I was hoping that more of them would be killed off - they really started to annoy me.
In short, Texas Rangers is long on being a Teen Beat homage and short on being a real western.  There is very little character development in either the good or bad guy camps and there is no storyline, but the central one.  I think there was an attempt to throw in a love story angle, but it gets lost when Kutcher jumps in the tub with van der Beek.
This film isn't the worst I've seen, but it certainly isn't even noteworthy.
If you want to see a bunch of your favorite television studs in a cowboy outfits, then by all means rent this.  Otherwise rent a decent western, such as The Cowboys, Rooster Cogburn, Shane, or Tombstone.",1059955200,6,2598,4.431578947368421

1281255,3,B00003CXKP,"Texas Rangers, one of the earliest organized law enforcement in America, has been treated in movie industry, and probably the best one remains King Vidor's version made in 1936.  Since then, the name has been used as a TV series, and even as a baseball team, so it is time for someone to pick up this ledendary figures to make a film out of their eventful history.  And here is a film based on this important part of American history again.
The film starts with massive killings of innocent people by the villainous John King Fisher (Alfred Molina).  And in order to regain the justice in the land of Texas, young gunmen get together under the command of Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott), whose way of carrying out justice seems sometimes very dubious.  James Van Der Beek is one of these brave youths recruited for the purpose, as are Usher Raymond and Ashton Kusher.  Robert Patrick also appears as Sgt. John Armstrong who supports McNelly, and you will find Rachel Leigh Cook, who falls in love with one of them.  Also, Leonor Verela (""Blade 2"") appears, but her role is a very painful one, I warn you, fans.
OK, and about the film ... well, first, don't expect something that might enlarge your knowledge about American history.  Though the character of McNelly is a real one, and the location of the film is very beautiful and authentic, the story itself is nothing new, nothing inspired, just what you have seen in other western films.  Though the film at least doens't stop to muse, and during this short running time there are enough shootings to keep you absorbed, you will feel something missing in it.
The actors including Van Deer Beek are not bad, but it is McDermott who attracts the viewers most, with his comparatively complex characterization.  However, I find Alfred Molina, usually a very reliable actor, is fatally miscast as a villain, and Rachael Leigh Cook looks very uncomfortable (though she was once in a costume drama ""True Women."")  Probably it is because we know (and she knows) that her role is just an obligatory one.
Director Steve Miner, like his ""Lake Placid,"" keeps the story going anyway, but he neither hits the right mark, nor misses it too wide.  Surely ""Texas Rangers"" is entertaining, but needs something more to be really original.",1034467200,4,2274,4.760814249363868
1281256,4,B00003CXKP,"Texas Rangers is a very thoughtful film. Kyle McDermont gives a very good performer as the captain of the now failing Texas Rangers Corr commissioned by the US President in the mid 1800's. These men were there to protect the Texas landowners land, cattle and homes. (Including their wives and children.)
Steve Minor who has done a lot of low budget films but actually carried this film to its end directed the movie.
The characters and they way they developed with their convictions was very well done. The performances were genuine and honest. It's a film that has a small - but honest - heart.
The DVD extras include a nice little behind the scenes docudrama about the making of the film and the interviews with the cast and director are quite interesting. This is a film that if you like westerns you will enjoy it. It has action, drama, life, death, friendship, loyalty and heroism.

1281258,2,B00003CXKP,"Well, I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in this movie. I mean, the basic idea was good, and I'm sure someone could have made a decent movie out of it if they had 1) fired the writer and gotten a better script, and 2) done a better job casting actors who actually fit into this kind of movie. Dylan McDermott, Robert Patrick, James van der Beek, Rachael Leigh Cook - they are all good actors, but neither one of them (with the possible exception of Rachael) fits into a Western movie at all. Same goes for Ashton Kutcher, who is cute but should stick to teen comedies and the likes!!! I am absolutely convinced that a better script and different actors could have made this movie into a hit!!!
The way it is now, though, the story is simply going nowhere ... actually, there isn't even a real story that runs from beginning to end ... instead, there's just many events thrown together with no connection (or explanation) whatsoever - I mean, the whole movie doesn't make any sense at all! After watching it, I still have no idea what is happening or why it is happening ... the only possible explanation I can find is that maybe they cut and re-cut this movie so many times that not even the director knew where the story was supposed to go anymore.
The only reason why I even finished watching the movie was that I kept thinking ""There's got to be more ... this has got to get better 'cause it sure can't get any worse ...""! If you want to see this movie real bad for some reason then rent it or wait till they show it on TV - don't waste your money on buying it!!!",1022112000,2,1574,4.2675585284280935
1281259,3,B00003CXKP,"This film was a huge disappointment to me.  The plot was fairly OK, but someone could have done much better in casting.  Dylan McDermott overacted throughout the entire film and Usher Raymond seemed like a ""token"" to fill the racial quota.  Ashton Kutcher either really is [not that bright] in real life, or he just enjoys playing one--I kept expecting him to say ""Dude, where's my horse?"".  And then there was James Van Der Beek.  I am so happy he was able to find styling gel in the wild west--his pretty-boy image made his character impossible to believe.  If I were to believe that this character ended up COMMANDING this bunch, then I would expect said character to look older than 12.
The only shining performances in this film, were played by Robert Patrick and Randy Travis.  I truly hope that poor Robert Patrick will someday get a role in a film where he is not the only redeeming quality--(think Striptease).  He has to be the most underrated actor in show business.  If you do see this, see it only for these two, because the rest of the actors in this film are completely forgettable.",1020902400,,1097,4.584615384615384
1281260,5,B00003CXKP,"""Texas Rangers"" may not be historically accurate, and it may not be ""Tombstone"" (despite the many similarities), but it is an excellent, action-filled Western in the ""Young Guns"" tradition. Despite the presence of James Van Der Beek, Dylan McDermott is the heroic presence of the film. In true Clint Eastwood style, he does a lot of squinting, very little shaving, and a lot of shooting - never breaking a sweat even as he spits out quite decent one-liners. The cast may be ensamble for the most part, but Dylan steals the show. It is unfortunate that ""Texas Rangers"" didn't enjoy a wide release last November. Given some of the awful movies that DID enjoy wide release last year (""Tomb Raider,"" ""The Musketeer,"" ""Planet of the Apes""), it is truly a shame. Watch this movie - particularly if you're a fan of the genre. It doesn't have the class or quality of a Clint production, but it's good fun all the same.",1019001600,3,910,4.658385093167702

1281262,2,B00003CXKP,"How do you film a movie about Texas in Canada? The town representing Brownsville, Tx was indeed filmed in Canada. The location scenery definitely proves that. Anyone familiar with the Brownsville area can see a total mis-representation. Why did the filmmakers not go to Bracketteville, TX to film. Bracketteville and the surrounding area is the home location to may great westerns; i.e.: The Alamo, Bandolero!, Lonesome Dove, Bad Girls, just to name a few. And the landscape is more appropriate to representing the Brownsville area. The movie took a lot of liberties with actual events, also. The movie was based on the book, ""Taming the Nueces Strip"" by George Durham as told to Clyde Wantland. George Durham was a real person who's exploits with McNelly's Rangers are well told. In ""Texas Rangers."" Durham is nothing more than a minor character,played by Ashton Kutcher,  represented as the friend of the central character,Lincoln Rogers Dunnison (who was he?), played by James Van Der Beek. If the movie had followed the real historical events as they really happened as told by Durham, it would have been a much better movie.  Alfred Molina as King Fisher was very disappointing, greatly over-playing the part, probably trying to enhance a poor scripting of his character. I was greatly disappointed.",1011312000,7,1304,5.117370892018779
1281263,3,B00003CXKP,"In the after-effects of the Civil War, Texas is a sleeping giant falling prey to vicious marauding and theft by Mexican invaders. The Rangers were disbanded to fight for the South; now they are to be regrouped, with a former pastor-turned-lawman, Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott), in he lead. Persuaded by the government to undertake the training and leadership of thirty rag-taggled, half-bit schoolboy-turned-lawmen, McNelly finds himself at odds not only with his own priorities and shaken faith, but his inability in leadership.
One member of this poor crop of unshaven boys is Dunnison (James Van Der Beek), whose family was slaughtered by the Mexicans. Due to his writing talents, he is chosen as McNelly's personal aid and undertakes documenting all of the reports to Washington.
With very little time for training, the Rangers saddle up and ride off to meet their fates. But prejudice, poor shooting skills and mistakes are the least of McNelly's problems. There is also a traitor among them... a character who will turncoat... and a violent climax in Mexico.
Texas Rangers (PG13) has a good heart and could have been a great film. It's been a long time since there's been a truly excellent western on the market -- not since Jimmy Stewart donned his white hat and rode into the west. Sadly, this one will not fill the void. The fact that the film was not pre-released for the press is a dead giveaway that something is lacking. The acting is excellent -- pity the scriptwriters didn't give Dylan McDermott and Rachael Leigh Cook more to work with. The soundtrack is gorgeous -- will it be released? Probably not, considering the big-screen failure of the film.

The movie abounds with clever camera angles, gorgeous photography and costuming, and truly unanticipated moments -- ambushes, traitors, and clever banter. Sadly it is based more on gunfights and cheap thrills than pliable emotional conflict. Characters are under-developed; we hope they don't get killed but don't really have a reason why. The female leads in particular are too overlooked, the actresses unable to exhibit their full potential. What this film desperately needed was a side plot or a stronger main plot to draw from -- more emotion, less coldness. Perhaps a stronger romance; more background information. Too many characters are left in the lurch, their personalities trailing off as if the writer didn't know what to do with them.
In conclusion, it was worth a matinee. I came away sorry for the under-development and violence, but willing to watch it again on video or DVD (prefurably a Director's Cut). If you like the tradition of old westerns, ""Texas Rangers"" fits the bill. But if you shy away from nonstop violence and cheap character development, you may want to pass this one over for a Christmas blockbuster. It had a lot of potential... but was too slow on the draw.",1008201600,11,2865,4.96875
