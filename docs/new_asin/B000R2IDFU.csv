8198390,4,B000R2IDFU,Very good Spanish-made movie with the great Spanish movie and singing star Sarita Montiel.  The story is sort of a retread of the Camille love tragedy.  I saw this recently on a Spanish-language movie channel.  The picture quality was great.  I hope it is released very soon on US DVD.  Recommended.,1401494400,,299,4.784313725490196
