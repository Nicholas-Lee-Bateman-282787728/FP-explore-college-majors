8159154,4,B0001MMGCC,"There are so many English dubbed DVD versions of the Sonny Chiba Street Fighter movie series out there (roughly 20 or so in various combinations), that it's hard to figure out which ones to buy.  Many are probably from the same source.  I happen to pick this one up cheaply, and at least the set is in widescreen format with decent audio.  Also, this collection has all three of the original Street Fighter films: ""Street Fighter"", ""Return of the Street Fighter"" and ""The Street Fighter's Last Revenge"".  Not much for extras, but the films are here, and if you like Asian action Cinema, Martial Arts films, etc., you'll like these.  The ""Sister Street Fighter"" films are also highly recommended.  Again there are many DVD sets to choose from, including Blu-Ray:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sister-Street-Fighter-Sister-Street-Fighter-II-Blu-ray/dp/B000YDBP6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sister Street Fighter / Sister Street Fighter II [Blu-ray</a>].  Depending on preference, one might seek out Sonny Chiba's films in the original Japanese language with subtitles.
