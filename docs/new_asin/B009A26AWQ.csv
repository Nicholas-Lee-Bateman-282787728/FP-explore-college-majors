8538245,3,B009A26AWQ,It's good whenever the amazing story of the Chicago 8 is acknowledged. The problem is always that actors and script writers consistently dumb down the characters. This film is no exception.,1447977600,,189,5.129032258064516
8538246,5,B009A26AWQ,GREAT,1432339200,,5,5.0

8538248,5,B009A26AWQ,"Buy it. Watch it. Share it with your friends. This is a very good movie.

But, on a technical note, when I put it in my old cathode-ray tube TV (yes, they are still around), I get a full screen version, not a widescreen version as advertised. Nor can I figure out how to get the digital copy that is promised.",1426377600,,309,4.065573770491803
8538249,4,B009A26AWQ,A movie that grips your mind from the start. Its an account of some young political activists fighting for racial equality in the 1970's. The smart and beautiful Mayim Bialik gets less of a role in the film than she deserves. Proving herself a talent powerhouse in the Big Bang Theory as Amy Farrah Fowler and starring in her own show Blossom in the early 1990's her inclusion sealed the deal on it for me.,1381017600,3,406,4.426666666666667
8538250,5,B009A26AWQ,"This is a great movie and I am glad I have it. I was actually the on-set stills photographer for this production and the photos on the cover and back I took. It was great to be a part of this kind of movie, the History and drama that is involved.",1375833600,,246,3.843137254901961
8538251,5,B009A26AWQ,"This film is entirely based on the transcripts of the trial of the Chicago 8.

The judge appointed to try the case was Julius D Hoffman (the ex-law partner of the standing mayor, Richard J Daley). When it became apparent that the jury wouldn't convict, he sentenced all the defendants and all the lawyers for the defense to terms of months to years in prison for ""contempt of court"", causing in each case a mistrial. This would allow Nixon's federal prosecuters another try at convicting the prisoners later. The court of appeals reversed the contempt of court decisions in 1972. The court of appeals reversed all subsequent convictions related to the case, in 1972.

Watch the film and decide for yourself....

Full disclosure: I was there, in Chicago, at the time and sixteen years old. The police were so violently inclined that while I was walking down the street with friends a police car ran up over the curb and three police jumped out with billy clubs. A couple of elderly women, in their sixties or seventies grabbed two of the officers by their arms and that prevented them from hitting me and my companions. My dad and brother were inside the convention, working on the computers. They saw that when the New York delegation wanted to walk out in protest of the police violence the delegation was stopped by armed police, in the aisles of the convention.

Watch the trial. It wouldn't happen nowadays. Because the defendants would be imprisoned and no trials would occur. You don't see war reporting on television anymore. And you don't see the returning caskets of the dead. And you don't hear anti-war songs on your oligopoly owned radio stations. Bin Laden lived to see his wish, the end of the free people of the United States of America.",1361145600,13,1752,4.7344262295081965
