8433365,3,B004KSA4MW,"One Exciting Night is a 1922 silent Mystery film directed by D. W. Griffith. The plot revolves around the murder of a bootlegger and the attempts of the cast to uncover the true murderer. The film, inspired by the Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood play The Bat (1920), led to the production of similar ""murder mystery/old dark house"" films such as The Bat (1926) based on the play, The Cat and the Canary (1927), The Old Dark House (1932) and even the fabled London After Midnight (1927) with Lon Chaney. At the time of this film, Henry Hull was starring on Broadway in the stage version of Mary Roberts Rinehart's The Cat and the Canary.

If your a fan of Griffith, its a must buy as its next to impossible to find a copy anywhere. The only problem its not a great picture, but a historcial must. INtresting note that Carol Dempster talked Griffith into having a hurricane scene at the end of the picture, because she wanted something exciting like Griffith did for Lillian Gish in Way Down East, and the ice flow scene.

The VHS tape is from the Killiam collection and looks great on a small screen. If you have a wide screen TV in the 42 inch range and up it looses it's sharp look. But until it comes out on DVD enjoy it for what it is. Just rememebr were spoiled by sharp Digital video these days, and this VHS tape was made in 1997.",1315872000,3,1344,4.350597609561753
