8500910,1,B006MIAOJQ,"Why fix what ain't even broke?  There's been a lot of recent noise stirred up to condemn a charming classic of British comedy because it was designed for Caucasian actors/singers/comedians.  So there is nothing for Asian-Americans to ""take back"".  This film is fun because it presents an Asian-American view of Gilbert & Sullivan, but the makers of it seem to have forgotten that this was a film about the English, by the English, and for the English. Otherwise, they are taking this story far more seriously than it was intended to be.",1425081600,,536,4.804347826086956
8500911,4,B006MIAOJQ,"If you like indie flix with music, laughs and heart this is for you. The director, Chill Kong, is a terrific character actor who's been memorably featured in Hollywood films.",1394668800,,174,4.833333333333333
8500912,5,B006MIAOJQ,"The Mikado Project was a really enjoyable film. I enjoyed the dry wit and humor in the writing style. The actors were all well cast in well-crafted characters. The story itself, about a Asian-American company's near demise, and the use of ""The Mikado"" as a device to bring attention, recognition and money to save the dysfunctional family environment of the company's members, was very clever, creative, and well executed. Although the plot element of mistaken identity of the grant inspector/examiner was a bit formulaic, most of the film moved very effectively and had lots of great dry wit that made ""The Mikado Project"" very entertaining.",1329609600,,642,5.123809523809523
8500913,2,B006MIAOJQ,"I'm noticing a LOT of glowing 5-star reviews and a rather harsh one-star review and for those who actually SEEN the film (I do not count the opinions of the film's cast, creative team, or friends/family members of such folks), the film at least to me falls in the middle.

Like the harsh one-star reviewer, I caught this film at the 2010 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival so for those of you wondering how I'm really reviewing this without purchasing the product, there's your answer. You can check out the program link if you STILL don't believe me, you can check the link out here: asianfilmfestla.org/2010/program-guide/program-26/

(Funny enough, nobody questions the 5-star reviewers whether they seen the film or not, just the negative reviewer was questioned. Hmm...curious, no?)

I'll give the film the strong credit that they have a very strong premise and a very interesting Asian American cast but as a whole, I felt like the film ultimately struggled to nail a strong cohesive narrative that carried effectively throughout the film. Perhaps this was in due part because of the deadline the film was supposed to be finished, but a lot of the editing, sound, and story frame structures were rushed and felt very sloppy. But if the film had gone through major revisions since its screening from the 2010 LAAPFF, I stand corrected.

It was as if care was made for its individual parts but not for the whole package. The parts were then put together in due haste and as the film progressed, I got completely lost in the random editing mess of it all. Once again, if the editing disaster was fine tuned in the final release of the DVD, I stand corrected.

So technically, this is the review of the film I saw back in 2010. If the film is EXACTLY the way it was before then, then I believe the film merits two stars but not 5-stars. 5-stars belong to masterpieces, to which this film is certainly not. While I was almost tempted to give it the 1-star review that another person here did, I give kudos to Chil Kong, the crew, and the cast for at least putting an effort to tell this story.",1327795200,,2099,4.631720430107527
8500914,5,B006MIAOJQ,"As an opera singer and voice teacher, I have seen many productions of The Mikado as well as Madama Butterfly, Turandot and even the lesser known Iris by Mascagni.  All of these Musical works stem from the western fascination with Asian culture during the later part of the 19 century into the early part of the 20th century.  Debussy and Ravel were also composers that tinged some of their music with the western idea of asian ""sounding"" music.  In the United States the audience would cringe at the thought of an all caucasian cast performing Porgy and Bess.  We give little thought about this when casting The Mikado, Turandot and Madama Butterfly.  We also give little thought to the centuries of tradition in asian culture and how those traditions should be respected.  The Mikado Project is an eye opening film in this regard.  I applaud Chil Kong and his very talented cast for holding a mirror up to these stereotypes in a very funny and entertaining way.  the script was very well written and the story was told with ease and economy that is VERY rare in an ""indie"" film.  As a side note to the story it is also interesting to see the economics of a small theater company and how grants are the majority of their financial existence. Excellent performances were given by Tamlyn Tomita, Allen Liu, Ryun Yu, Yuri Tag, Raymond Lee and especially Erin Quill as Cheryl who infused much humanity as well as beautiful singing into the film.",1327017600,7,1441,4.664031620553359
8500915,5,B006MIAOJQ,I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it in NY a few years ago and am glad to see it is coming out on video as I have a few friends who weren't able to make the limited screenings. I liked the way they took back the Mikado and made it their own. Hope you enjoy their performances as much as I did!,1326067200,,294,3.6825396825396823
8500916,1,B006MIAOJQ,"The idea of a struggling Asian American theater company putting up a play that was infamous in their portrayal of Japanese people is a promising one but you can't have a good movie with just that alone.

Everything about this film is off, starting with the inconsistent technical aspects that just screams sloppy. While there was the idea of a plot, the movie ultimately falls apart in the end with various scatter shots of the ""production"" that leaves the viewers confused in who was actually editing the film in the first place.

I will add that I was able to see the movie, if people are wondering that I'm just bashing without any merit. The film premiered at the 2010 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival and so I was able to check it out, from the recommendations of my peers. Trust me, I wanted this film to succeed given that the premise was so strong and there were a lot of cast members that I know personally that are wonderful actors.

The one star is kinda harsh, no? Yet I can't seem to give it at any higher than that because it was that sloppy and inconsistent of a movie. It was perhaps the worst film I've seen at the festival that year and it is not something I recommend to my friends. Asian American films tend to fluctuate in terms of storytelling quality and this is one of the worst to offer in that category.

If you want good examples, check out ""The People I've Slept With"", ""Saving Face"", or go back to the APA film that was able to break into mainstream, ""Better Luck Tomorrow"".",1325980800,2,1510,4.420863309352518
