5480408,5,B00AR6A8X6,"If you're a hardcore Sigur Ros fan, then you need these. Some are beautiful, some are weird, some are pretentious, but that happens when you get into experimental art projects. Adding imagery to lush, delicately beautiful songs is a nice dimension to add to  Sigur Ros music.",1365724800,3,275,4.851063829787234

Sigur Ros rules. Sigur Ros rules. Sigur Ros rules. Got it?",1365379200,,125,5.0
5480410,4,B00AR6A8X6,"It is always a fascinating experience to see what other envision when they hear music. This is especially true for music by Sigur Ros. Their long slow progressions, poignant builds, and raw emotiveness create the perfect soundscapes for directors and fans alike to produce dreamlike visions of stories, myths, comedies, and dances.

There are some truly amazing moments on here and I would have gladly given it 5 stars if there were any sound mastering to the DVD. Their is only one ""audio track"" to select and it's a stereo LPCM output. This results in both sound deterioration at the higher decibel climaxes of many of the songs and also unmetered sound output from some of the videos that employ narration as accompaniment to the Valtari soundtrack. For something so beautiful in both music and visual composition, this seems like an oversight. I would love to see this in Bluray format someday!*

Review in Summary: Eye Candy for Ear Candy! Amazing as is, but could have been a lot better if it was utilizing some form of DTS or Dolby mastering (preferably DTS Master or True Dolby HD...but really anything would have been better than LPCM).

*Note: There is a bluray version of this listed on Amazon, but be careful as it is a Region B/2 Bluray and will not work unless you have a region free player (which I do not have so I stuck with DVD).",1363824000,11,1347,4.651260504201681
