7813511,5,6301560787,"Knight and Day (with Tom Cruise) reminded me of this movie. Yes, it's dated with 80's fashion, but a great thrill ride. The problem is that you can't get this movie anywhere. I spent almost $100 getting the VHS tape of it. This movie would actually be worth remaking.",1418774400,2,267,4.469387755102041
7813512,4,6301560787,"One of my favorites from this period of brassy, neon-lit fun flicks.

In no way could I ever be construed as a fan of Director Albert Pyun. But all things being equal and honest - he really cranked out a sweet action/thriller in 'Down Twisted'. Taking the best from the then neo-Hong Kong action flick industry and combining it with the then-cultural innovator of ultra florescent styling: Michael Mann's Miami Vice television series. Blended, Pyun produced a quickfire 80's flick, jacked up by ample amounts of sarcastic humor in the form of eternal smartass Charles Rocket.

In this movie Rocket plays a character in his own name - Charlie a.k.a. Reno. And Charlie leads a team of thieves. They've been contracted by a billionaire to steal the cultural icon of an entire nation. Similar set-up to Disney's 2004 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Treasure/dp/B00005JN5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Treasure</a>&nbsp;with the cast taking off with the Declaration Of Independence.

But fictional San Lucas' prized cultural icon isn't a piece of animal skin, theirs is a huge solid gold 'cross' embedded with precious stones. Crafted by Spanish conquistadors and their religious clerics, a symbol of the new religion in the New World. Real value = incalculable. Price to steal it = $3 million cold hard cash.

Problem is that Charlie has recruited some serious scumbags to the team, and the word ""cross"" comes into play to mean more than just the icon - as in 'double' and 'triple'. You never know who is going to end up dead or left holding a bag of steaming poopy.

The lone character we know isn't involved is cute Carey Lowell. Long before she wed that actor-who-isn't-gay and before becoming the impassioned associate district attorney for 'Law & Order' - has her playing Max, a smart girl in the wrong place at the wrong time and having the misfortune of having lousy roommates. Via misunderstanding and misdirection, the gang of thieves believes she's the last person to know the location of the hidden cross, despite the fact that she really doesn't.

What follows is Max trying to figure out a way to get out alive and/or not end up in some South American craphole prison.

And like all truly good 80's flicks you must have a Tangerine Dream-like soundtrack. If you can't appreciate the thumping electro-synth tempo and quiet melodic waves of other-worldly sizzle then I truly feel for you, because you'll never truly appreciate the ""night"" vibe with any other form of music as so clearly expressed in techno rhythms.

Even though dated, this flick still has enough juice to carry a modern audience's interest in Con Artist/Action/Thrillers, a genre that happily continues to be played out in the 21st century.

Personal Note:

I created a custom poster for this film that can be seen in 'Customer Images'. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it. :-)",1321574400,6,2932,5.089583333333334
7813513,4,6301560787,"First thing you must keep in mind this is a Golan Globus era movie.  That means, this is a B movie that has its flaws but you know they were going for something. If ripping off other movies, or bad acting, or bad sets really really bothers you.. well you probably won't like this movie. But if you love watching a great story trying to get out.. you will like this one. Since no one wants to release this movie on DVD I think the last time I saw it was like 1994, so bear with me.

I believe, the story starts with a normal type girl (Carey Lowell) who is a waitress trying to get a better job. She looks about 30 here but I am sure is supposed to be about 23 or so.  One day she does a favor for her roommate and ends up... plucked out of her LA life to some horrible little third world country. As the audience we have no idea it is coming (seems like an LA style mystery) and it all happens so fast you are hooked.  Just before she is kidnapped she literally bumps into what she believes to be an innocent bystander, Reno (Charles Rocket). She believes both have been kidnapped (him by mistake) and are trying to escape being dropped in the middle of a 3rd world jungle with no money.  But of course, all is not what it seems. Most of the rest of the movie is finding out why she was kidnapped, what her roommate was involved in and got her involved in, and how to get back to the USA alive. A little like ""Romancing the Stone"" but more dark and twisted.

Here is the key to why this movie will have me forever, Charles Rockett, a strictly comedic actor and SNL alumn, plays it perfectly straight for most of this movie and was actually, the love interest. And I bought it. I mean, in this movie, Charles Rocket is handsome (which actually he kind of was but his comedic persona kind of obscured that), ruthless, sexy, and sneaky. For that alone, someone need preserve this movie.",1309996800,2,1883,4.1878453038674035
7813514,5,6301560787,"This isn't anything like a Bruce Campbell movie, but if you've liked him in everything you've seen, including Briscoe County Junior, then you'll love Charles Rocket. His character is gritty and yet cracks me up. I've seen this movie about five times, but now can't find it. The sound quality on VHS is horrible. It's very hard to understand the dialog, which is too bad. If you miss the dialog, then you'll lose track of the plot and miss out on a lot of the humor. Heck, if you get up to grab a beverage without pausing, you'll miss a critical plot point.

If you have a chance to see this, don't miss it! It's a very fast paced and clever, tight plot with a few excellent twists (get it?). Just make sure you can watch it at a time when you can turn the volume way up. You'll need it loud to catch all the dialog, and the action scenes are even louder.

If this comes out on DVD or BD, then I'm pre-ordering; no questions asked. Charles Rocket is primarily a TV star, and has had some bit parts in movies. Too bad. In the lead role of this movie, I thought he was awesome.",1273190400,5,1074,4.183574879227053
7813515,5,6301560787,A 1980s classic.  Very interesting and engaging plot.  Watch it several times to catch all the twists - that by itself makes the movie special.  Very under-rated film.,1264118400,4,167,4.892857142857143

good to see her but stll not enough",1234828800,,117,3.72
7813517,2,6301560787,"May be of interest for fans of Carey Lowell (who I wish I hadn't learned was married to Richard Gere), or for ""fans"" of bad-movie maestro Albert Pyun.  A somewhat fun little romp with plenty of stupid.

I think the general idea was to rip off ""Romancing the Stone"".",1209945600,,265,4.387755102040816
7813518,4,6301560787,A good film all the way to the end. I liked the characters and the originality.,1082592000,4,79,4.0
