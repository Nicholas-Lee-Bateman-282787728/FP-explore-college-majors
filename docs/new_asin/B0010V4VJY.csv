3050306,5,B0010V4VJY,"After all the classes that I took in school on the Medieval period and from what I've read on my own, Terry Jones has taken something that (to some) is dry, dull and boring and turned it into something interesting and fun to learn about. Just like his series on the Crusades, this series takes all the myths from that period and shows that what you've read about isn't true at all. Take for instance, the Medieval Damsel in distress...She wasn't as helpless as one would seem to be. That was an image the Victorians wanted to  show in order to ""downplay"" female sexuality. All in all, a very interesting  and funny take on many of the myths of the Medieval period.",1217462400,,664,4.434426229508197
3050307,5,B0010V4VJY,I like this series a lot! Why? Because it showed me that people were not as miserable as they had been made out be in that period of history. We often think we have it so good and we are so much smarter then our ancestors were in the past. This series by Terry Jones give the viewer a new perspective. I also enjoyed the Humor presented by Terry Jones too. I say buy it because it can be a great educational tool that many peole can watch and enjoy.,1215993600,,449,4.0
3050308,5,B0010V4VJY,"Where was Terry Jones when all of us were in the History of Western Civilization 101? Medieval Lives has to be the most entertaining, informative treasures of man's ascent from the bog! The DVD format is wonderfully produced with much of the creative descendants of Monty Python; brilliant use of art, music, interviews with academics and a whole range of scientific observation. Mr. Jones creates the perfect balance of humor and historical perspective as he traverses the map of civilization - dispelling the myth of Roman superiority with hilarious delight!",1215820800,7,560,5.233333333333333
3050309,5,B0010V4VJY,"I used to live in the UK and I saw Medieval Lives when it ran on the BBC and on reruns on UK History.  I also have the book and recently reread it for the second or third time and thought to myself yet again, ""Why isn't this series available on DVD?""  My entire family enjoyed this show, even my then 11 year old son.  This show is legitimate history but presented with a light comic touch that makes it accessible and definitely NOT boring.  If you liked any of Terry Jones other history shows, you will like Medieval Lives.",1211068800,8,525,4.22
3050310,4,B0010V4VJY,"I really loved this DVD. Terry Jones is a real historical super sleuth. It is funny in places and best yet, it treats the audience with respect and acknowledges a modicum of intelligence (unlike any American history shows which seem to think we need to reminded every 10 seconds of what we've just seen!!) Anyway, Terry's portrayal of Medieval Lives is great for the whole family. Informative and fun.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terry-Jones-Medieval-Lives/dp/B0010V4VJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terry Jones' Medieval Lives</a>",1209945600,3,570,6.613333333333333
3050311,5,B0010V4VJY,"I've enjoyed Terry Jones's Hidden History Series (Egypt, Rome, History of Weapon technology) and purchased the ""Barbarians"" documentary. This one is enjoyable and educational like the other ones but adding the animation is brilliant! Considering that Monty Python always had animation, they  should have done this on all the Terry Jones documentaries! There is also a bonus documentary on gladiators in Rome which is about an hour or so. Nice!",1208736000,18,443,5.328571428571428

3050320,4,B0010V4VJY,Terry Jones brings history to life in a entertaining way. Informing you of Medieval lives and myths by humorously portraying the people he is enlightening us on.,1401580800,,161,5.0
3050321,5,B0010V4VJY,"If you are interested in Medieval times, Terry Jones does a great job. Being a former Monty Python member, you can expect lots of dry humor. But Terry also delivers the serious side. What were knights really like? What was the condition of women? How ruthless the Church was. The injustice shown to the poor. And yet, like wasn't as bad as I thought. Except of course, punishment for crimes.",1397779200,,391,4.6

Humor and history do not often go together, but that does not mean they conflict.  I was learning while laughing.  From his videos to his books Terry Jones is the best.  No way to disappoint unless you are looking for a sleep aide.",1396915200,,329,4.327868852459017

3050324,5,B0010V4VJY,"Peasant's revolt 1381 is also called Wat Tyler's Rebellion turns out to be more complex than first thought. An excellent view of medieval lives presented by Terry Jones is not a bunch of sound bites and redundant information from obscure experts. They get right down to the bone. The 1349 Black Death plague is also spotted.

Then there is the monk. We learn the truth about monkhood. Most of the monks look like Terry Jones. We see that prayers became a commodity. We learn about bare bottom piety. There is a competition to have the best relics. There was the 1327 rebellion against a monastery; it was a preliminary to 1381.

Now consider the Damsel. Also looks like Terry Jones. The archetype of the passive female. Nicola de la Haye pushing 70; she was aided by William Marshal. We get the real story with the use of puppets to keep this PG13. We have stories of women abducting men. We follow women's fashion. 1429 Joan of Arc story is told; her real crime was that she wore men's clothing.

Would you believe the Minstrel? In 1066 At the Battle of Hastings, Taillefer recited the Chanson de Roland to the Norman troops while juggling with his sword. They tell of troubadours that tell stories in the vernacular. He mentions Geoffrey Chaucer who mysteriously disappears; dispatching is suspected.

A knight to remember. William Marshal returns as the subject in an interesting story of his life and how he became a knight. We see them train horses to kick shields. We learn about the order of the garter founded in 1348.

Shall we consider the philosopher? A medieval scientist and possibly doctor. We get a look at a field where they grew all the herbs needed for medicine. We get pictures of experiments with newer medicines. We even found anesthetics. We find Washington Irving is responsible for making us think that they thought the world is flat. Nobody never thought the world is flat. We also get to see an astronomical clock. All to display our ignorance of our own past.

Stand and deliver. Not midwives but the outlaw. Terry asks ""Did outlaws never where trousers?"" We learn about ""The Folvilles"" (John De Folville 1312 - 1363 and his sons.) Among other gangs. 1150 trial by jury, but not as we know it. We get to see unique ways of execution and/or mutilation. We learn that outlaws are part of the heart of what makes England.

Midlevel kings divided into the good, the bad, and the ugly. We cover three Richards. We get a spot of Richard the third form Shakespeare. He tells of the King of England that on one has ever heard of.",1394150400,,2548,4.623893805309734
3050325,4,B0010V4VJY,"Short and droll views of medieval life!
Usable as a source for middle school history resource. Each episode is less than an hour. Expect some irreverent humor and some myth busting.",1390953600,,181,4.870967741935484
3050326,5,B0010V4VJY,"This series gives a lot of information about the medieval times, mostly dispelling the notions we have about the way they lived.
It's full of humor, but lots of good information and it teaches you a lot about how these people lived so long ago.
The only gripe I have is that I don't agree with his assessment of Richard III, but I won't dive into that here. Overall, intelligent and entertaining at the same time. A must see documentary!",1380067200,,437,4.475
3050327,3,B0010V4VJY,"interesting premise, and some kernals of wisdom here and there, but much of the show meanders as, i imagine, medieval life would, before the dawn of television, mass communication and transportation.  i expect more substance from my documentaries, and this just seemed a bit watered down.",1377216000,,288,5.260869565217392
3050328,4,B0010V4VJY,"This was a really fun and informational dvd. It's packed with fast moving stories,satire and facts. I enjoy this type of thing so I give it a 4 star. My husband was less impressed but I say go for it!!!",1376265600,,202,4.075
3050329,5,B0010V4VJY,I stumbled upon these when planning for my middle school history class. The kids loved it and they learned a lot!,1371600000,,113,4.428571428571429

3050332,1,B0010V4VJY,"This is a poorly done and silly application to a subject that I have researched for years. It was off track in so many areas that I felt violated. I received this item over a week after the promised 2 day shipping delivery date.  I had wanted the DVD so I decided to go ahead and keep it, even though I had requested a return.  You can imagine my horror when I opened the poorly packaged item to find the package broken and 2 2nd disc instead of a 1 and a 2.  Needless to say, I will not be keeping this item, which really ticks me off because I wanted it.

I don't know about the stars, I meant to give the worst review, however,  in my ignorance, I may have the given the best.  Hope not.  Alice",1351123200,,697,3.971223021582734
3050333,5,B0010V4VJY,"I have seen ""Medieval Lives"" on my DVD that seemed to grow legs and walked so I was glad to find it again on amazon Prime.  Terry Jones as researcher and medieval scholar presenting this material with humor is delightful. Reminders of the importance of knowing who writes or recounts the history you think you know - is always welcome.",1321488000,,335,4.583333333333333
3050334,5,B0010V4VJY,"I came across this by chance. I watched it figuring it would just be another nonsense documentary mixing historical fact with political or social undertones (some of which are actually mentioned in the series) to promote the maker's agenda.

 I was completely shocked by what I saw. Today, when people ask me for a good history lesson (I'm well known in my local community for understanding history) I usually refer them to this.

 Rather then simply painting sources as pure good, evil, happy, unhappy etc., Terry Jones digs in to the depths of how different groups and movements came to being and uncovers finer details from the archaeological and written record to prove his case and build a full picture of what was really happening and why. For instance, in the episode about monks. Rather then just painting them as inherently corrupt and pure evil, he explains how a system that was originally meant to serve a good purpose got corrupted over time as it became more and more embedded in societies led by ""mafia-like"" power holders who tended to replace their brains with brawn. Something the monks were able to capitalize on.

I especially appreciate his method of examining ancient letters, tax records, court records etc. to dig out clues unwittingly left behind by the writers as to what was really going on at the times.

 If there is one episode that really impressed me, it was the ""Philosopher"" episode, where he gets in to Roger Bacon (a VERY interesting historical figure) and demonstrates the medieval world's real obsession with science and knowledge, and the fact that the same church that built many of our great universities was clearly leading the western world in science throughout most, if not all the middle ages, and that some of our popular beliefs about church persecution of seekers of knowledge are simply not true.

 If there is one thing you wouldn't expect to see in an accurate historical documentary, it's a sense of humor. But Mr. Jones again overcomes all expectation by making his series not only extremely accurate and informative, but also keeping it full of humor, often in the form of humorously putting historical happenings in to perspective.

 While I agree with another review that it could use a ""season 2"" to explain the lives of other groups in medieval society such as aristocracy, priests etc., I still vouch that it's the most accurate and complete documentary series I've seen yet on the subject of medieval life and a great starting point for anyone getting in to the subject.",1313020800,4,2531,4.876456876456876
3050335,5,B0010V4VJY,"I ran across this series and just loved it.  I had to watch the whole thing and
wished there was even more.  It's great how he does research on the various topics
but also adds some humor along the way.  The photography in the many locations is
super also.  You will love this new twist on old stories.",1308960000,,302,4.155172413793103
3050336,5,B0010V4VJY,"This DVD is medieval history at its finest!  I loved it, and even my family, consisting of a 10-yr-old and a 15-yr-old, as well as a hubby, loved this video history of medieval times in Western Europe.

My husband and I always enjoyed Monty Python, so when we found this gem on Amazon by Terry Jones, and discovered that he is actually a medieval scholar, we were curious to see how the subject matter would be presented.  We had a blast!  It was totally appropriate for the kids, and we really learned a lot about medieval Europe that we did not previously know.  For example, the Peasant Revolt of the 14th century was something glossed over in high school courses, but Terry Jones actually points out some very interesting facts to wrap one's mind around, such as: how did a bunch of peasants have the wherewithal to get together and how were they able to communicate in order to be organized enough to rebel in the first place?  Answers provided, and it was a neat surprise.

If you are an Anglophile, Francophile, or history buff, get this DVD!  If you just want to expand your mind without the use of illegal substances, get this DVD!",1308096000,,1140,4.5268292682926825
3050337,5,B0010V4VJY,"And here I thought that the Medival Age was a time of complete ignorance, absolute stupidity and unbelievable brutality!  How wrong can one get?  But then, isn't that the picture most of us received way back in secondary school when we were forced to study such things?  As it turns out, with the help of a delightful Terry Jones, those perceptions are not necessarily true.  This is a most unusual documentary that never depends upon dull lecture-type tirades, long boring speeches, or statements of absolute truths.  Instead, Mr. Jones always leaves the viewer with a whole lot of questions.  Along with Jones' command of the situation in every case, there are the incomparable standards of the BBC production team, the camera angles, and the script writers.  This mini-series is funny, informative and factual.  I recommend it to any history buff...or even to mildly curious buffs.",1306800000,2,884,5.048275862068966
3050338,5,B0010V4VJY,"I enjoyed the whole series - very well done and entertaining.
Only one thing wrong: most of these are mislabled.
The only two episodes that actually are what their titles claim them to be are ""the Monk,"" and ""The Outlaw.""  The others are as follows:
TITLE______________ACTUAL EPISODE
The Peasant--------The King (I did enjoy that irony.)
The Knight----------The Peasant
The Damsel---------The Minstrel
The King------------The Damsel
The Philosopher-----The Knight
The Minstrel--------The Philosopher

It doesn't matter a whole lot though.  They're all worth watching.",1302220800,3,567,5.9753086419753085
3050339,5,B0010V4VJY,"I really enjoy these Terry Jones history lessons. He challenges the stereotypical history I learned in school which was dry and uninteresting. If you are not familiar with his style then you may be put off at first but understand this is about making history fun and he is a wonderful story teller and you will definitely pick up many interesting and little known tidbits. The videos are very enjoyable - the opposite of Ken Clark's Civilization was dry and boring.

Also, highly recommended is Terry Jones' Crusades and Barbarians. The Terry Jones Collection was made much earlier than all of the above video sets and is not as good as his later work but still not bad. Again, Medieval Lives, Barbarians and Crusades are all highly recommended, 5 stars, and the Terry Jones Collection is 4 stars",1298419200,2,796,4.768115942028985
3050340,5,B0010V4VJY,"Terry Jones does an outstanding job debunking some myths and fables about life in the Western European Middle Ages. I especially like his coverage about The Monks. All in all, some good fun and some great history telling!",1288051200,2,221,4.842105263157895
3050341,4,B0010V4VJY,"Whilst some of the Pythons have continued to milk the MP catalog as much as possible (let's name no names, squire, nudge nudge), others such as Palin, Cleese, Gilliam and Jones have each done interestingly original things, and Terry's Medieval Lives is a fine addition to that list.

I haven't read his book of the same name and thus have no idea how the two intersect, but did come across this dvd in the local library and gave it a spin. Many misconceptions about the middle ages are dispelled here, and other theories are given new life. The best thing is that TJ doesn't take himself too seriously, and manages to have plenty of fun with a topic few would think worthy of comic spelunking (unless they'd seen Python's Holy Grail...and if you haven't, run don't walk and watch that golden comic masterpiece immediately!).

Some of the skits here are rather daft, but others hit the nail on the head. The best of the bunch might be The Knight, which skewers many misperceptions about chivalry and shares some most unpleasant truths about how very brutal many knights actually were. The Peasant and The Minstrel chapters are standouts as well; the latter also turns some typical historical assumptions upside down, and Terry's happy, goofy grin shows how much he really does love this topic.

I do know that I would have loved seeing this in school! If you teach history and want to wake your kids up, show them some of this dvd. If only all of history was approached with the same irreverence for cliches, matched with reverence for the subject, that we find here. And no doubt about it: Jones loves the medieval period and does his best to share that love here, and when it works it works quite winningly indeed.

Plus which, the guy can still make funny faces with the best of 'em. As with Palin traveling around the world, it's hard to not smile as you watch Jones have a good time here. The fact that we learn plenty in the meantime is a lovely bonus.",1286150400,3,1957,4.566951566951567
3050342,5,B0010V4VJY,"Terry Jones makes medieval English history absolutely fascinating.  If he had been my social studies teacher in high school I never would have been able to sleep in class because his presentation of all things quirky, quacky, off-the-wall and interesting come to life in this two-disk set.

From his animated lessons one learns that peasants were not as dumb as we may think they were, monks were not always as angelic as the church had us believe, damsels in distress were just a figment of the church and the minstrel's life was nothing it was drummed up to be.  The church was run like a business during the medieval ages and as many monks, abbotts and merchants tried to get rich at the same time.  And if they could get away with sex, they had that, too.  But you won't find that in church documents!

Jones presents the lessons with a sense of humor, appearing in each skit in era costume and dry humor.  Some of the animation appears Monty Pythonesque. But what sells this work is his use of primary source documents.  Jones knows his history and he knows how to weave every bit of everyday life into one significant picture.

Although some of the subjects may be taboo for a high school class, (especially a Catholic high school class!) any history buff would be delighted with this set of medieval lives.",1284249600,,1313,4.600858369098712
3050343,4,B0010V4VJY,"Anyone familiar with Month Python will know of Terry Jones' use of animation. Looking slightly crude, the simple style does not detract from the message, possibly a relief in this modern age? Packed with information and delivered with a smile, could this simply be Terry's view of history? Well, possibly, but do you really care? I only wish my history teachers could have made his classes so interesting, I'm sure I would have remembered more from all those hours. Well worth a watch if you are interested in British history.",1268092800,2,526,4.855555555555555

History sometimes sinks in better if taken with a grain of humor, and there's plenty of that here, liberally mixed with facts. Myths get debunked, and history is improved. There's a lot of meat mixed with the fluff, and you'll be surprised how much you can learn. Recommended to both those with mild interest, and to those who really really LIKE this stuff.

3050346,5,B0010V4VJY,"Terry Jones sheds light on the day to day  lives of people living in medieval England in this incredibly clever, funny and intelligent series. Borrowing from Chaucer by categorizing the characters by profession Jones humorously guides the viewer through each chapter while providing insights that escape many scholarly treatments of the same period. Much of the filming is done on location so in addition to the historical treatment there is also a travelogue aspect leaving me with the desire to visit some of these sites on my next trip to England. Really great and atypical viewing. Highly recommended.",1252108800,3,605,5.173469387755102
3050347,5,B0010V4VJY,"What an excellent series! Terry Jones goes way beyond the standard history to tell us what lives were really like in the Medieval period. It makes much more sense than the stylized traditional picture we normally get from historians, it gets to believable people leading believable lives. If you want a down-to-earth, realistic account of what life was like in Medieval times, you must watch this series. It also tells much about the political and personal reasons for familiar (and some not at all familiar!) events of the time. Quite fascinating.",1243382400,3,548,5.032967032967033
3050348,4,B0010V4VJY,"Terry Jones does a wonderful job of bringing to life characters from medieval times, using contemporary images, stories, museums and of course some tongue-in-cheek personifications of various players of the time. A great introduction to this period in history if you are studying it or just a humorous diversion about the Middle Ages... either way it works and works well.",1240617600,,372,5.216666666666667
3050349,5,B0010V4VJY,"Critics can complain about what this is lacking,etc. I'm taking a class on the time period and wanted a visual history that wouldn't annoy the whole family to watch it with me. We loved it, a few parts I had to talk over movie so my child wouldn't hear the topic discussed (knights improper conduct). This struck up family discussions about history. My husband and I laughed a few times and my history class education was maximized by this purchase.

I purchased this and Crusades also by Terry Jones and enjoyed them both very much.  We rented History Channel's versions and found we didn't get as much out of them. History channels shows a lot of stock footage, again and again.. Terry Jones, however, shows us artwork in creative ways. Making this visually a much more enjoyable experience. I think this is a great springboard for future reading into history. He has done what I had hoped he would, inspire us, make history come alive, and leave us with a few laughs.

Definately worth the money, continue the purchase of both this and Crusades.",1226188800,,1048,4.684782608695652
3050350,4,B0010V4VJY,"Though he's best known for his Monty Python stuff don't be fooled into thinking this series is comedy. Terry Jones is an expert on this topic and presents some very compelling detail about roles in medieval society. The real gem of the series is that with each profession you watch another piece of the whole puzzle fits together to give you a broad picture. Finding real information about this time period that isn't about nobility or war is virtually impossible and Jones fills that gap admirably. Invaluable (and very entertaining) knowledge for anyone with a casual or professional interest in this sort of thing.

If I were pressed to find a negative about this series, it feels like a few ends are left dangling- I'm left wanting to see more chapters about the daily life of professional soldiers or lesser nobles. Some chapters, such as the one about kings, is more concerned with interesting trivia over daily life. All in all, minor complaints.",1223510400,37,953,4.846625766871166
3050351,4,B0010V4VJY,"I echo all the praise of the previous reviews.  As a medieval historian turned businessman, and a multimedia producer, I can't say how  impressed I am with Mr. Jones' treatment of the subject, with his beloved humor and creativity - challenging our misperceptions and revealing details of medieval life we can appreciate through our shared humanity with people who lived so long ago.  Thank you for caring so much about history, and sharing your enthusiasm!!

I challenge Mr. Jones to take another look at medieval monastic life and medieval spirituality.  His episode on monks leaves the viewer with no sense of the value of spiritual life in general, or medieval or monastic life in particular.  Mr. Jones' criticism of religious institutions and their worldly nonsense is most welcome, but can he look beyond these diversions from spirituality toward the real values and benefits that genuinely attracted people from all strata of society, and still do today?  For a very different look at monastic life, I recommend the DVD ""Into Great Silence"" by Phillip Groning - a glimpse into the lives of Carthusian monks today, at the Grande Chartreuse monastery in the French Alps, founded by St. Bruno and his followers in 1084.

I think one of the most important jobs of a historian is not just to present the facts as accurately as possible, but actually help us see the world through the eyes of the people studied - and most medieval people lived in a world profoundly centered around religious belief and practice.  Could he share with us something of the personal experience of devotion and spirituality, in a way that doesn't seem to assume that medieval people  were too ignorant to know better?  The medieval world was rich with imagination and meaning that, in my personal opinion, makes our modern experience, for all the real benefit of modern science and technology, seem somewhat pale and shallow.  I can't think of anyone better able to help us rediscover and appreciate those things about the medieval worldview and medieval spirituality that have stood the test of time, if only Mr. Jones would turn his attention to them.

Just like his series on the Crusades, this series takes all the myths from that period and shows that what you've read about isn't true at all. Take for instance, the Medieval Damsel in distress...She wasn't as helpless as one would seem to be. That was an image the Victorians wanted to  show in order to ""downplay"" female sexuality.

3284821,5,B0010V4VJY,"Peasant's revolt 1381 is also called Wat Tyler's Rebellion turns out to be more complex than first thought. An excellent view of medieval lives presented by Terry Jones is not a bunch of sound bites and redundant information from obscure experts. They get right down to the bone. The 1349 Black Death plague is also spotted.

Then there is the monk. We learn the truth about monkhood. Most of the monks look like Terry Jones. We see that prayers became a commodity. We learn about bare bottom piety. There is a competition to have the best relics. There was the 1327 rebellion against a monastery; it was a preliminary to 1381.

Now consider the Damsel. Also looks like Terry Jones. The archetype of the passive female. Nicola de la Haye pushing 70; she was aided by William Marshal. We get the real story with the use of puppets to keep this PG13. We have stories of women abducting men. We follow women's fashion. 1429 Joan of Arc story is told; her real crime was that she wore men's clothing.

Would you believe the Minstrel? In 1066 At the Battle of Hastings, Taillefer recited the Chanson de Roland to the Norman troops while juggling with his sword. They tell of troubadours that tell stories in the vernacular. He mentions Geoffrey Chaucer who mysteriously disappears; dispatching is suspected.

A knight to remember. William Marshal returns as the subject in an interesting story of his life and how he became a knight. We see them train horses to kick shields. We learn about the order of the garter founded in 1348.

Shall we consider the philosopher? A medieval scientist and possibly doctor. We get a look at a field where they grew all the herbs needed for medicine. We get pictures of experiments with newer medicines. We even found anesthetics. We find Washington Irving is responsible for making us think that they thought the world is flat. Nobody never thought the world is flat. We also get to see an astronomical clock. All to display our ignorance of our own past.

Stand and deliver. Not midwives but the outlaw. Terry asks ""Did outlaws never where trousers?"" We learn about ""The Folvilles"" (John De Folville 1312 - 1363 and his sons.) Among other gangs. 1150 trial by jury, but not as we know it. We get to see unique ways of execution and/or mutilation. We learn that outlaws are part of the heart of what makes England.

Midlevel kings divided into the good, the bad, and the ugly. We cover three Richards. We get a spot of Richard the third form Shakespeare. He tells of the King of England that on one has ever heard of.",1394150400,,2548,4.623893805309734

3284831,5,B0010V4VJY,"I came across this by chance. I watched it figuring it would just be another nonsense documentary mixing historical fact with political or social undertones (some of which are actually mentioned in the series) to promote the maker's agenda.

 I was completely shocked by what I saw. Today, when people ask me for a good history lesson (I'm well known in my local community for understanding history) I usually refer them to this.

 Rather then simply painting sources as pure good, evil, happy, unhappy etc., Terry Jones digs in to the depths of how different groups and movements came to being and uncovers finer details from the archaeological and written record to prove his case and build a full picture of what was really happening and why. For instance, in the episode about monks. Rather then just painting them as inherently corrupt and pure evil, he explains how a system that was originally meant to serve a good purpose got corrupted over time as it became more and more embedded in societies led by ""mafia-like"" power holders who tended to replace their brains with brawn. Something the monks were able to capitalize on.

I especially appreciate his method of examining ancient letters, tax records, court records etc. to dig out clues unwittingly left behind by the writers as to what was really going on at the times.

 If there is one episode that really impressed me, it was the ""Philosopher"" episode, where he gets in to Roger Bacon (a VERY interesting historical figure) and demonstrates the medieval world's real obsession with science and knowledge, and the fact that the same church that built many of our great universities was clearly leading the western world in science throughout most, if not all the middle ages, and that some of our popular beliefs about church persecution of seekers of knowledge are simply not true.

 If there is one thing you wouldn't expect to see in an accurate historical documentary, it's a sense of humor. But Mr. Jones again overcomes all expectation by making his series not only extremely accurate and informative, but also keeping it full of humor, often in the form of humorously putting historical happenings in to perspective.

 While I agree with another review that it could use a ""season 2"" to explain the lives of other groups in medieval society such as aristocracy, priests etc., I still vouch that it's the most accurate and complete documentary series I've seen yet on the subject of medieval life and a great starting point for anyone getting in to the subject.",1313020800,4,2531,4.876456876456876

My husband and I always enjoyed Monty Python, so when we found this gem on Amazon by Terry Jones, and discovered that he is actually a medieval scholar, we were curious to see how the subject matter would be presented.  We had a blast!  It was totally appropriate for the kids, and we really learned a lot about medieval Europe that we did not previously know.  For example, the Peasant Revolt of the 14th century was something glossed over in high school courses, but Terry Jones actually points out some very interesting facts to wrap one's mind around, such as: how did a bunch of peasants have the wherewithal to get together and how were they able to communicate in order to be organized enough to rebel in the first place?  Answers provided, and it was a neat surprise.

This is a most unusual documentary that never depends upon dull lecture-type tirades, long boring speeches, or statements of absolute truths.  Instead, Mr. Jones always leaves the viewer with a whole lot of questions.

I haven't read his book of the same name and thus have no idea how the two intersect, but did come across this dvd in the local library and gave it a spin. Many misconceptions about the middle ages are dispelled here, and other theories are given new life. The best thing is that TJ doesn't take himself too seriously, and manages to have plenty of fun with a topic few would think worthy of comic spelunking (unless they'd seen Python's Holy Grail...and if you haven't, run don't walk and watch that golden comic masterpiece immediately!).

Some of the skits here are rather daft, but others hit the nail on the head. The best of the bunch might be The Knight, which skewers many misperceptions about chivalry and shares some most unpleasant truths about how very brutal many knights actually were. The Peasant and The Minstrel chapters are standouts as well; the latter also turns some typical historical assumptions upside down, and Terry's happy, goofy grin shows how much he really does love this topic.

I do know that I would have loved seeing this in school! If you teach history and want to wake your kids up, show them some of this dvd. If only all of history was approached with the same irreverence for cliches, matched with reverence for the subject, that we find here. And no doubt about it: Jones loves the medieval period and does his best to share that love here, and when it works it works quite winningly indeed.

Plus which, the guy can still make funny faces with the best of 'em. As with Palin traveling around the world, it's hard to not smile as you watch Jones have a good time here. The fact that we learn plenty in the meantime is a lovely bonus.",1286150400,3,1957,4.566951566951567
3284839,5,B0010V4VJY,"Terry Jones makes medieval English history absolutely fascinating.  If he had been my social studies teacher in high school I never would have been able to sleep in class because his presentation of all things quirky, quacky, off-the-wall and interesting come to life in this two-disk set.

From his animated lessons one learns that peasants were not as dumb as we may think they were, monks were not always as angelic as the church had us believe, damsels in distress were just a figment of the church and the minstrel's life was nothing it was drummed up to be.  The church was run like a business during the medieval ages and as many monks, abbotts and merchants tried to get rich at the same time.  And if they could get away with sex, they had that, too.  But you won't find that in church documents!

Jones presents the lessons with a sense of humor, appearing in each skit in era costume and dry humor.  Some of the animation appears Monty Pythonesque. But what sells this work is his use of primary source documents.  Jones knows his history and he knows how to weave every bit of everyday life into one significant picture.

Although some of the subjects may be taboo for a high school class, (especially a Catholic high school class!) any history buff would be delighted with this set of medieval lives.",1284249600,,1313,4.600858369098712

I purchased this and Crusades also by Terry Jones and enjoyed them both very much.  We rented History Channel's versions and found we didn't get as much out of them. History channels shows a lot of stock footage, again and again.. Terry Jones, however, shows us artwork in creative ways. Making this visually a much more enjoyable experience. I think this is a great springboard for future reading into history. He has done what I had hoped he would, inspire us, make history come alive, and leave us with a few laughs.

Terry Jones is an expert on this topic and presents some very compelling detail about roles in medieval society. The real gem of the series is that with each profession you watch another piece of the whole puzzle fits together to give you a broad picture. Finding real information about this time period that isn't about nobility or war is virtually impossible and Jones fills that gap admirably. Invaluable (and very entertaining) knowledge for anyone with a casual or professional interest in this sort of thing.

If I were pressed to find a negative about this series, it feels like a few ends are left dangling- I'm left wanting to see more chapters about the daily life of professional soldiers or lesser nobles. Some chapters, such as the one about kings, is more concerned with interesting trivia over daily life. All in all, minor complaints.",1223510400,37,953,4.846625766871166
3284848,4,B0010V4VJY,"I echo all the praise of the previous reviews.  As a medieval historian turned businessman, and a multimedia producer, I can't say how  impressed I am with Mr. Jones' treatment of the subject, with his beloved humor and creativity - challenging our misperceptions and revealing details of medieval life we can appreciate through our shared humanity with people who lived so long ago.  Thank you for caring so much about history, and sharing your enthusiasm!!

I challenge Mr. Jones to take another look at medieval monastic life and medieval spirituality.  His episode on monks leaves the viewer with no sense of the value of spiritual life in general, or medieval or monastic life in particular.  Mr. Jones' criticism of religious institutions and their worldly nonsense is most welcome, but can he look beyond these diversions from spirituality toward the real values and benefits that genuinely attracted people from all strata of society, and still do today?  For a very different look at monastic life, I recommend the DVD ""Into Great Silence"" by Phillip Groning - a glimpse into the lives of Carthusian monks today, at the Grande Chartreuse monastery in the French Alps, founded by St. Bruno and his followers in 1084.

I think one of the most important jobs of a historian is not just to present the facts as accurately as possible, but actually help us see the world through the eyes of the people studied - and most medieval people lived in a world profoundly centered around religious belief and practice.  Could he share with us something of the personal experience of devotion and spirituality, in a way that doesn't seem to assume that medieval people  were too ignorant to know better?  The medieval world was rich with imagination and meaning that, in my personal opinion, makes our modern experience, for all the real benefit of modern science and technology, seem somewhat pale and shallow.  I can't think of anyone better able to help us rediscover and appreciate those things about the medieval worldview and medieval spirituality that have stood the test of time, if only Mr. Jones would turn his attention to them.  Please do!",1223078400,38,2147,4.947075208913649

If you wish to avert piracy (Amazon / noted studios) this is certainly not the way in which to conduct business. Try to catch up to the 21st century. I did wait over two years to obtain it legally, at which point I simply gave up after receiving no indication that it would be available in America in a digital format. I bought the DVD but am disappointed that it is still not available digitally.",1525132800,,489,4.384615384615385
8238571,5,B0010V4VJY,"I used all or part of several episodes in a 9th grade unit on comparative Eastern and Western social history. I have a masters degree in Medieval and Early Modern European history, and it is, I think, far and away the best series on what society was actually like in the middle ages. Even though the focus is on High and Late Medieval England, much of the material is applicable to surrounding periods and societies and (and if you know what you're doing, there are clips that can be used as a teaching tool for very distant periods and societies). I've also used bits of the ""the Peasant"" episode (best in the series) which dealt with open field farming to teach about the so-called ""tragedy of the commons"" and the rise of capitalism.

What also really stands out about the series is that it is much more heavily geared towards a critical reading of history (albeit usually overstating his arguments), and is in this way arguably much more like the work of real historians than almost any other documentaries you find (naturally there's less kooky animations and dressing in drag going on in the work of most professional historians). It is a very useful resource for teaching history, wherever it is relevant, for High School or Middle School (though some episodes may talk to frankly about sex for the tastes of some schools).",1493337600,,1330,4.708154506437769
