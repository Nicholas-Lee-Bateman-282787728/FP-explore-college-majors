8556757,2,B00AR4B0VC,"This movie is very weak rubbish!  A total wasted of time and money!  It's not funny or sexy at all like ABC TV once said. It is gory and gross, though, if that's what you like. Joe Dallesandro never took any acting lessons, that is apparent. His expression never changes, it stays a blank  stone face.
He says his lines like a zombie would say them. Monique Van Vooren is a much better actor, but stuck in a real dog of a movie.
The guy who plays Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant both over-act and mostly keep shouting throughout the entire movie.
I was glad when it finally ended.",1503273600,,583,4.330275229357798
