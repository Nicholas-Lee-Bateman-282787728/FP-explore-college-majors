8709207,2,B00V4TU4AW,"This documentary? Is really just an interview (but not really an interview because nobody asked questions) with Charles Hall.  Charles Hall apparently was an unlisted military man who worked as a weather station ranger at Area 51 (Or as he calls it - Dreamland) in the 1960's.  He basically talks to some unmentioned person off camera about his experience with Tall White aliens whilst providing weather station support.  He goes into some incredible and unbelievable accounts with these aliens but every now and then contradicts himself in such a way as to make the viewer think that he might not be telling the entire truth.  Specifically he refers to these Tall White aliens as very fragile creatures who are almost all the same height of 5 feet inch 11 inches or 6 feet tall.  This doesn't seem to be so tall as to give them the name Tall Whites does it? Anyway, he goes on to say how fragile they are yet if you got too close to the short? White alien children the female aliens might just kill you! And they are also much lighter than and have no teeth so I guess they'd kill you by gnawing at your genitals or with their weapons that he never mentions.  He also gives an account about how when he was in his weather station and the aliens visited him in his shack, he gets concerned about a can of Coca Cola that he has on a table and is afraid that if one of the kids drank his Coke, he might be in danger of being killed because I guess soda kills the Tall Whites.  He never mentions how they can communicate with him and they understand English very well.  So on and on we go about tow long the Tall Whites live and the fragility of their bone structure and other details that I can't even begin to understand how he found out about these aliens.  Apparently Charles is quite popular with these aliens and continues to account for their physical attributes to the point where I lose interest at 31:57 into this show.  Why? Because he starts going on about how scared he is if them and how scared they are of him but this doesn't begin to make any chronological sense.  Why would he ramble on for so long about these aliens without giving any credibility to why they would only visit with him.  I want to believe him because he seems quite convincing but when he says that the US military built their scout craft but that the aliens provided the propulsion system I get the feeling that I'm witnessing this mans delusion or some other fictional story telling.  Please give it a watch and tell me if get the same feeling of incredulity in this mans account with not so-tall, fragile white alien beings who are easily killed by soda.

While I believe that we are not alone in the Universe and that we might have been in contact at some point with aliens in our history, Mr. Halls account seems strangely fictional.",1446422400,3,2821,4.420849420849421
