6156347,5,B00HEEAM94,"Not alot to say about the wonderful story which has been described by many. Other than it is my favorite movie of all time. My husband and I took a pilgrimage to Mackinac island in 1981 to see where it all was filmed.  There wasn't much on the island about the movie at that time. Only a couple photos on the wall in the Grand Hotel. But theroom that appeared as the  Hall of History in the move was the same with it's red wallpaper. (Now all changed.)
  Other things have changed too and the storekeepers have since realised what a travelogue this movie was for their quaint island and sell memorabilia. Of course the SIT fan weekends made a big difference in awareness of the movie's impact.

I have had every version of this movie since it was released on video back in the 80s. My first version was laden with dropouts from the frequent viewings.

The last dvd version was good but not perfect--

 Never have I see truer colors, more detail (and thats hard when you've seen a film as many times as Ive seen this.) than on this bluray release. I don't think it was this brilliantly colorful when I saw it at the movies back when it was released. Also Jane looked even more stunning in bluray if that is possible.

It almost has a 3-D quality to it, the forefront images are so crystal clear.  I never noticed Chris' victorian shirt was a mint green, his striped suit a lightweight wool. Anyway, I waited for this film on bluray for quite some time and it did not disappoint.

Only 2 scenes were a little grainy--One when Susan French comes back from the stage play clutching Collier's program

and the second when Jane Seymour is in her dressing room before the play.

 Other than those the bluray edition is 100% improvement over all those that came before. If you love the film before, you'll enjoy it even more on bluray.

The specials are the same as on the Special edition 20th anniversary DVD release.",1393977600,20,1910,4.432664756446991

I finally got this beautiful movie on Blu-ray.  THIS update has everything to do with the Blu-Ray restore.  The Blu-Ray restore SHOULD BE sold as a YELLOW-Ray retore!!  Yes. The restore IS clearer. BUT this ""blu""-ray copy turns EVERYTHING YELLOW! Jane's beautiful white clothes, the Grand Hotel, the Gazebo etc, etc, ARE ALL YELLOW! Universal?  What the heck did you do to my favorite movie??????  What a horrible disgrace you made this!!  As professionals, HOW could you let this out and sell it????

*** March 4, 2014***

I was 13 when this movie came out and fell madly in love with Chris, Jane, John Barry's score and Mackinac Island.  I know every word of this movie because like many, I NEVER get tired of this movie and I have seen it MANY, MANY times!  Yes - the movie is a fantasy so ""circles within circles"" plots were fashioned by writer Richard Matheson. Since it came out in 1980, I have visited Mackinac because of it multiple times, I have been in contact with the INSITE founder who was an extra on the film, and most of all have actually talked to Jane Seymour at a book signing about it!!  For people who love this film like me, you need to know that 99% of this film was filmed on Mackinac in places you can still visit! The ""Hall of History"" is a fabricated banquet hall adjacent to the Salle Manger restaurant in the Grand Hotel.  The theater where Elise delivers her famous ""Man of My dreams"" speech still exists at the college on the opposite end of the island AND it still retains the very chair Christopher Reeve sat in when she gave it.  For the past 21 years, there has been a commemorative stone from INSITE where the ""Is it You"" speech took place. Elise McKenna's house as an old woman is still standing on the shore.  The gazebo used to be on the Govenors Mansion property but at least as early as 2008 has been relocated on the island and weddings are held on it. If ANYONE is a fan of this movie, get yourself up to Mackinac and see first hand where it was filmed....AND watch in on the island. This is a movie like no other fashioned by a man who was one of the best writers of the Twilight Zone series.  I have owned EVERY medium that this movie has come onto since inception. This blu -ray is COMING HOME. :-)",1393891200,7,2267,4.3619047619047615
6156349,1,B00HEEAM94,Another shameful Universal release with a monophonic soundtrack. Even a basic stereo release would have been better than this. I will not be purchasing this release and suggest others boycott it also.,1393027200,7,200,5.28125
6156350,1,B00HEEAM94,"It can now be confirmed that the Universal blu-ray release of ""Somewhere In Time"" 1980, has a mono soundtrack.

To describe it as having ""DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0"" is misleading and a pure con.

Also, picture sharpness is no better than the HDTV broadcast transfer that is widely available on torrent sites.

Universal should bow their heads in shame. It stinks of pure greed.

Clearly a case of minimum outlay for maximum return.

Shame on Universal.",1392940800,8,450,4.868421052631579
6156351,5,B00HEEAM94,"I have been waiting such a long, long time to finally own this film in Hi-Def.

The first time I saw the film (in a theater during its original release), I was ambivalent.  But I went to see it a second time a few weeks later and was simply bowled over.  ""Come back to me.""  Simply haunting.

A wonderful love story.  If it is the first time you are seeing it and don't think so, wait a couple of weeks and watch it again.

Then it will hit you.",1390867200,,445,3.932584269662921
6156352,5,B00HEEAM94,"Get ready to own this Blu-ray for $14.

I remember seeing this many years ago on a rather small CRT TV as a movie rerun and was mesmerized by this love story involving time travel.  Even the ""Time Traveler's Wife"" doesn't hold a spark to this masterpiece.  If anything else Christopher Reeve should be remembered for other than his best portrayal of Superman, it is this lost gem.

Also includes the most haunting theme song from Sergei Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0!  I wish it was remastered in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 using source audio masters but beggars can't be choosers.  I'll take it for the HD picture and stereo audio!

Too bad Christopher Reeve isn't around to do a special feature with Jane Seymour...

The 35th Anniversary is coming up in a year and it would have been perfect timing for this release.

6156360,5,B00HEEAM94,"I've always loved this movie. It had been a number of years since I'd last seen it, and felt it was time to add it to my movie collection.  The BluRay quality was very fine, as was the sound quality.

As for the movie, it is slow paced. And, there are some plot issues for some viewers. Neither of these are issues for me. I find the pace perfect for the story that is being told. And the ""loose ends"" people seem to refer to are common to time travel stories. As The Doctor says ""wibbly, wobbly, timey, wimey stuff."" Cause and effect don't always make sense with time travel. Try to relax the logic and enjoy the romance. Because, this is a romance far more than it is a science fiction story.

Is the ending exactly what I would have preferred? No, But, then, I'm not the writer. So I don't get to choose those details. And the ending that does exist is good enough for me. Again, my advice is relax and enjoy the ride. I know I always do.",1519344000,,941,4.15934065934066

6156398,5,B00HEEAM94,"I rather resented having to buy this on Blu-ray, since I already had it on DVD, but the DVD is letterboxed, not anthropomorphic, and has a horrible mega-grainy picture.  It was downright painful to watch it on my large screen TV.  The picture on the DVD is so bad, I have many VHS tapes that look much better.  So, when I noticed that Amazon was offering the Blu-ray rather inexpensively, I went ahead and bought it, but not after some trepidation about that as well.  That was precipitated by reading some of the other reviews here, which suggested that the Blu-ray picture quality wasn't very good either.  I even went so far as to look at some professional reviews elsewhere first.  One of those said that the parts of the film occurring in 1912 were purposely photographed in a soft-focus impressionistic style; so, I figured that perhaps that is what some of the reviewers here were noticing and commenting on.

Having just finished watching the Blu-ray, I can report the following.  It is not the greatest Blu-ray picture I have seen by any means, but it is just fine.  Clearly parts of the film are purposely soft focused or have an over-exposed look to them, but that seems to have been intentional.  It is not all parts of the 1912 scenes that are photographed that way by any means, but just some parts, and this is occasionally seen in the more modern scenes as well, although only very briefly.  I have no complaints about the picture quality on the Blu-ray.  Bottom line:  The picture quality on the Blu-ray is fine and vastly better than the abysmal DVD.  If you like this film, for what the Blu-ray is selling for, you would be crazy not to buy it, even if, like me, you already have the DVD.

As to the film itself, sure it is based on a ridiculous premise, but it is otherwise delightful.  Jane Seymour looks absolutely gorgeous in it and Christopher Reeve doesnt look all that bad either.  Loved it when I first saw it years ago and still do.",1482969600,12,1960,4.5227272727272725

6156400,5,B00HEEAM94,"I have always liked Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. They had some wonderful chemistry in this movie, I think. It is definitely a love drama, so not for everyone. There are no explosions or gun fights. So, if you are looking for those, they are not here. It's pretty much about a man, Christopher Reeve, who is a playwright. One day at a party, he gets a visit from an older lady who he has never met before. He then becomes obsessed over who this woman is and decides to do some investigating on his own. Stuck on a play that he can't get completely written, he decides to take off for some R&R.
Going to a Hotel Called ""The Grand Hotel"", he then begins to discover who the woman is (Jane Seymour). But, you see, he lives in a different era, 1979, and she lived in the early 1900s. So, he discusses the possibility of removing all physical items from his era and tries to ""convince"" himself that he is actually ""living"" in her formidable years at the Hotel. He stays at the Hotel for several days in able to conduct this experiment, in which he succeeds, but for a ""Time.""

6156416,5,B00HEEAM94,"Because of my proximity to Mackinac Island, I have often been able to participate in the ""Somewhere In Time"" weekend held each October. The most memorable was the weekend Jane Seymour returned to the island and spoke in the auditorium of the Grand Hotel. It was the first time she had returned since the filming, and she surprised the audience with a telephone call to Christopher Reeve. We listened intently as the conversation between Elise McKenna and Richard Collier continued in real time! The strong friendship between them was obvious. Jane is as beautiful in person as she appears onscreen!
As a retired English teacher, I have used the movie in the classroom, to inspire students with a powerful love story and the most amazing on-screen kiss ever filmed.
Mackinac Island is one of the most beautiful places on earth! This movie captures its beauty and natural charm. At least once every summer, I try to visit the island, and stepping off the boat into a time of horse drawn carriages and a slower pace of life, is captivating. Seeing the lighthouse, the gazebo, the Grand Hotel and the tree lined path where Richard and Elise first met, leaves me with a sense of undeniable eternity!",1469318400,4,1194,4.800970873786408

Earlier in my career in the television production business, I went to the Grand Hotel and shot video for a production we were doing for the State of Michigan It was to show potential filmmakers  locations in our State. I went to the room used in the film and even though I hadn't seen the film ironically shot some of the same scenes that were used in the film.  When I later saw the film I fell in love with it.  I also enjoyed the documentary that came with the Blu-ray that told that originally they wanted to use the Hotel del Coronado on Coronado Island, California but couldn't because there were too many modern things like TV antennae at the del. To this day they don't allow motorized vehicles on Mackinac (Mac-in-naw) Island where the Grand Hotel is located.  The music is haunting and beautiful.  When I see the film I feel like I'm actually back at the Grand Hotel.",1456790400,8,929,4.461538461538462

6156444,5,B00HEEAM94,"I hesitated requesting this Blu-ray as a Christmas gift as I already owned the DVD.  I must say that I am positively thrilled that I did ask for and receive Somewhere in Time in Blu-ray.  I played the DVD for approximately 5 mins. and then popped in the Blu-ray and the difference in quality was positively jaw-dropping.  I didn't expect to see such a HUGE difference as playing a DVD in a Blu-ray player automatically bumps up the quality.  Perhaps the DVD has degraded over time--I'm not sure about that--all I can say is given that Somewhere in Time is probably my all-time favorite romantic drama.  It is pure magic and so, in my estimation, is worthy of being viewed in the best quality format available.  I can't believe that the Blu-ray is selling at such a low price as I paid a lot more originally for the DVD!

  This early 1900's period movie lives up to the expectations, and more., perhaps Christopher Reeve's best movie period!  Romantic movies have the potential of being redundant at a very consistent level the genre has been overused badly, but that, is not the case here,  I've seen entire Kleenex packs vanish before my very eyes at our house when we see this one (let this be a warning to you), perhaps Jane Seymour best performance as well, excellent contribution by Christopher Plummer is a bonus",1430438400,,579,4.877551020408164

6156513,5,B00HEEAM94,"..Not that one more positively glowing revue will move you to hit that ""buy"" button..However I recall gathering around the betamax and 24"" TV with my roomates to watch Somewhere in Time, for the first time in 1982. Who can remember (KC and Jazzer...can either of you?) what exactly it was that was so enthralling about this movie, but whatever it was, we watched it several more times over the next month or so. To call it a ""cult"" favorite would not do it justice...it's much more that that.

Excellent writing by Matheson ( passed July 2014),  expert direction by Szwarc, moving score by John Barry ( passed 2011), Reeve at his peak, and Seymour at her most beautiful, not to forget Plummer's addition that lent authenticity to the entire production: a touch of class! The location of the movie: the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island.  If you read Matheson's book from which this movie was taken, Bid Time Return, you will recall the location was the equally beautiful Hotel del Coronado on Coronado Island in California.  But I digress....

This work has become a very personal favorite to thousands of fans, and who can say what the appeal is exactly?  Find out for yourself, if you have not seen it, and you consider yourself a ""romantic"".  This will definitely rank along side ""An Affair to Remember"", and others.  The format really does it justice.  Preserved on Blu-ray.  Lucky too...My Betamax  tape broke....",1416528000,,1415,4.7818930041152266

6156544,1,B00HEEAM94,"Time travel movies, more or less, are full of it; yet, some are enjoyable to watch.  This one is probably the least imaginative ever conceived.  Hollywood, I know, loved it, because it was cheap  to produce--no  fancy gadgets necessary.  Just change your clothes and think your way into the future--what a bunch of glop!

An old lady, who is the love object when she's young, gives him a watch and tells him to come back to her; this is where the subtle suicide request comes in.

Later in life he breaks up with his girlfriend, falls for a portrait of girl and gets advice from a mentally incompetent professor about thinking yourself into the past.  Mental,ly he gets there the first time; the 2nd attempt costs him his life.  He gets to see her alright... but in the spirit realm--because he's dead.

So, that's what the old lady (who lived her life to  a ripe old age) asked him to do--to kill himself, so that he could spend eternity with her in the spiritual realm.

It's a tale (a really big one) about a very selfish old lady and a very stupid young man.

This movie is implausible; a man shows up out of the blue and immediately wants to make love to a woman in 1912, and  she's going to allow this to happen--in 1912?  Any man attempting such crude, crass and lusty behavior during this period, would have been thrown into jail forever.

The guy becomes salacious looking at her picture and then when he meets her wants to commune with her body?  Pardon me, but there's not an ounce of romance in that act... not to mention in the entire movie.  ""Roman Holiday,"" is a romantic movie.  This, is not.

This movie is about selfishness, lust and suicide.

It can't be about anything.

6156546,2,B00HEEAM94,"I was disappointed in the quality level of the video. I guess I expect more when it is a Blu-Ray, and this has such great out-door scenes of Michigan's famous island that it deserves more. I found a lot of scenes to show grain in any dark parts. The movie is great of course, but the video quality is about the same as DVD, for many that would be fine, for me, not so fine, and that's the reason for the lower rating",1401408000,6,416,4.024096385542169
6156547,5,B00HEEAM94,"To blatantly steal Jack Finney's TIME AND AGAIN and then name the professor in the film who is working on time travel Professor Finney is, for those of us who fell in love with the original illustrated novel, at least a bit of credit that seems to be less than actually given.  Universal, I hope, realized the origins and filthy lucre crossed many palms.  At any rate, this is probably thought of by many as a ""chickflick"", but, hey, romance is pan sexually received.  The acting is wonderfully near melodramatic, but not so heavy handed that the story cannot be connected with.  Really, if we had the chance to go back and make something work that didn't , wouldn't we give it a try.  I WOULD.

6156556,5,B00HEEAM94,"So, I was a twelve year old boy when this movie first aired on HBO. A young boy, who was becoming obsessed with ""Star Trek"". Star Wars"". ""Halloween"" was my favorite horror movie, them among other Sci-fi, action, and horror genres, and I still somehow managed to get the meaning and feel for this movie, that so many others have gotten out of it, that has made it a true cult classic survivor.
  An absolute flop at the box office, it was dismissed by the critics, as being riddled with loose ends, and loop holes. However, cable tv, and video rentals, just breathed a new life into this movie, and now we have it in the best format possible(for now). Like any Blu-ray movies that I have seen and own, it is like watching it for the first time. It just pulls you in, with so many details that were impossible to notice before. Only noticed a bit of grain as the older Elise, is looking out her bedroom window, on the night that she dies. The sound is not very good throughout the film. It's a bit hollow and thin. No surround at all. It's not the worst sound I have heard, I just think it was the best they could do with a low budget, mono sound released in the theatres.
  I can say so much more about this movie, but I would just be repeating what many others have said throughout the years, so I will just say that I'm very pleased with the Blu-ray release which has just come out. Visually, it's a beautiful transfer. Fans, should definitely have it for their collection!",1397952000,5,1474,4.310469314079422

6156567,5,B00HEEAM94,"I am 28 years old and my mother was the one who introduced me to this movie. She'd come across it during her divorce from my father and it struck a special chord in her heart and she fell in love with it. I, in turn, found out that it was based off the novel ""Bid Time Return"" by one of my favorite authors, Richard Matheson. So I read the book, loved it, bought the movie, and loved it just as much.

It is a simple story of a love so awesome that it could only, truly appeal to those who love deeply, and love grandly. As a student of film I could pick the film apart a few times over and come away with a handful of complaints, but in the right frame of mind it hits all the right notes. It appeals to those who are madly in love. It appeals to those that suffer from loneliness and yearn for love. It appeals to those who are dreamers and seek to be and live for something that is greater than themselves. Which is probably why it grabbed me and hasn't let go.

For her 57th birthday I took my mom out to Mackinac Island where the movie was filmed and got us rooms in the Grand Hotel for the Somewhere In Time Weekend held by the fan club: INSITE...yes, there actually is a fan club. Everything in this movie feels alive and tangible and that, along with an impeccable soundtrack, is what makes it amazing. I implore all to watch it.

It inspired me so much I ended up writing my first novel in the wake of returning home from Mackinac Island and I mention the source material directly in my book. Should you come to enjoy this movie and seek to immerse yourself in some similar material, by all means check out my novel SPIRAL DOWN right here on amazon.com.

6156569,5,B00HEEAM94,"This is a classic chick flick, heart warming love story. Filmed entirely on Mackinaw Island, a historic and beautiful island situated in between Michigan's upper and lower peninsulas.  Accessible by high speed catamarans which run hourly during the summer, this island remains ""vehicle-less"" to this day.  The only way to tour the island is by bicycle (bring your own or rental), walk or take a horse drawn carriage.  The Hotel, it's dining room and it's famous long front porch & vista's seen in the film, is still in operation. There's a long waiting list to rent the rooms they used in the film. It's a place for the entire family to visit for a day or week.

Up until seeing this film my best were 'Gone With The Wind' and 'Phantom of the Opera' Claude Rains, Susanna Foster (1942) both obtainable at Amazon. However both these great movies have been undone by a  film made on a very low budget. The storyline is great and all acting is greaterwhich proves something. If you have a BluRay macine get the Bluray copy from Amazon which has just lowered the price of this film. One does not have to go on and on just GET IT !!
