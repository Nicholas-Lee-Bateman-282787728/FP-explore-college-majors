7622431,4,B01B800K96,"Very interesting. Never thought how difficult having that name would be. I feel a great sorrow for the great nephews, such a miserable burden to carry.",1469059200,,151,4.846153846153846
7622432,2,B01B800K96,"Rather exploitative. The director's insistence on ""outing"" Adolph Hitler's descendants in the U.S. is shameful. These gentlemen want to live their lives in peace, and the director's pushy quest is irresponsible and voyeuristic. All-in-all some interesting points, but not enough to merit a positive review.",1468108800,2,306,5.822222222222222

7622435,5,B01B800K96,"Fascinating subject matter, well paced, balanced presentation, beautiful cinematography, excellent music score.  Matt Ogens and crew know their craft.  Features a nice cross-section of people who have found ways to cope with their name.  My only criticism would be I had trouble understanding whether there was one or two German guys with the Hitler name.  Otherwise, very well done.",1464998400,,383,5.440677966101695

7622437,2,B01B800K96,"Too long...Hitler's few direct descendants are sadly ordinary and nothing was said about the alternate American spelling of the name withe 2 t's, ""Hittler."" I had hopes for more compelling insights from the people who shared his name, some awareness of Hitler's monstrous deeds and place in history. Other than the boat navigator raised in an orphanage, interviewees seemed oblivious.",1463356800,2,384,5.416666666666667
7622438,3,B01B800K96,"I borrowed this from the library. This movie more like a People's magazine story. shallow, sensationalistic.  I was disappointed and bored. nothing against the people that were interviewed, They are not shallow, just the handling of their story is. I respect their courage in coming out of hiding.  The real story here, or mystery for me, is why is Hitler the icon for evilness? When unfortunately there are so many others who vie for his record? or even supersede it. And I wonder if other countries view him the same way or whether this is mostly true in America.",1463356800,3,565,4.696969696969697
7622439,5,B01B800K96,This documentary is beautifully made!  It looks incredible!  I found it intriguing and thought provoking.,1460592000,3,105,5.933333333333334
8749545,5,B01B800K96,"I am very interested genealogy and have wondered if Hitler had living descendents.  The documentary was interesting and informative.  It begins by asking how they feel about having the name Hitler. One man's mother was going to name her son Adolf.  She didn't know how bad Adolf Hitler was going to turn out to be. A 16 year old says she's not related to Hitler. Another man had not known there was an Adolf Hitler. One Hitler who lives in Germany lives on a ship.  That's all he owns and is where he lives.  Yet another Hitler is a neo Nazi. William Patrick Hitler, is Adolf Hitler's nephew and came to America wanting to conceal his identity.  He served in WWII and received the Purple Heart. There are lots more facts!!!",1522195200,,723,4.480916030534351
8749546,5,B01B800K96,"As an English professor, I showed this video to my students after we read a chapter from Freakonomics and also a chapter from Trevor Noah's Born a Crime. Both chapters dealt with the relationship between name and identity and how names' connotations can vary across different cultures. The students were very interested, and this video allowed them to explore the relationship between name, culture, and identity in more detail.",1498176000,2,428,5.217391304347826
8749547,1,B01B800K96,Just uninteresting people with the same last name. Would have been good to get interviews with the actual descendants that are still living in NY.,1485043200,3,146,4.88
8749548,2,B01B800K96,"Definitely would've like to see the story of the nephews further developed.  Quite honestly most of the other stories were uninteresting.  The only other story that had some substance was the family that lost their children.  I wouldn't mind seeing a documentary just focused on that story.  Also, I believe the nephews are going by the name Houston.  During the film, a phone book was researched. Right there I pretty much guessed the last started with ""Hou.""  Look info. up on the internet and easily found that William Patrick changed his name to Stuart-Houston.  I may be wrong about the last name or maybe everybody already knows the Houston last name.  Anyway, again, I wish the nephews' story could have been further developed and they would've been more willin to talk.",1479340800,3,777,4.877862595419847

8749552,3,B01B800K96,"I have always been intrigued by Hitler and the influence he had on people to carry out his horrific ideals but I'm glad that this was not another portrait of him or the survival stories of his victims. It is simply a portrait of a handful of people unrelated to Hitler living with his same name and the effects it had on them. I think the documentary could have had more depth. *Spoiler* The man who claimed to be the only living relative of Hitler and had been orphaned could have been examined more. Emily's story was vapid and uninteresting. It would have made an incredibly interesting story if the nephews of Hitler decided to speak out but they didn't and it is what it is. Also, wouldn't you like to know more about the diary?",1472428800,2,733,4.397058823529412
