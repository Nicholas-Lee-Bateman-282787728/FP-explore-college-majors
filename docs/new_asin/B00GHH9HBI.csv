6075518,1,B00GHH9HBI,"I think that this show is so boring compared to H20 just add water they need to do a college version with Emma,Rikki, Cleo, Bella, and Lewis . And they need to have Rikki and Zane get back together . They also always change the cafe on the seasons thats weird it needs to stay rikki's cafe. Make some new episodes of H20",1397692800,3,320,4.095238095238095
6075519,5,B00GHH9HBI,"Mako Mermaids is a completely different story line than H2O Just Add Water.  As I got further into the program, it got more interesting.  I purchased both Vol 1 and 2 of Season 1.  I'm looking forward to Season 2.  Whereas H2O was about three teenage girls who accidently became mermaids and learning to cope with it along with their normal activities,  Mako Mermaids is the opposite.  Its about three natural born mermaids that find that they have to learn to live on land with land folk.  Its a sort of fish out of water story -- pardon the pun.  I enjoyed Mako Mermaids, but If I were to choose between H2O and Mako Mermaids, I'd select H2O.  I'm hoping season 2 gets better.",1397606400,11,678,4.403225806451613
6075520,4,B00GHH9HBI,"Watching Mako Mermaids when it was broadcast on Netflix was out of the question for me due to my data allowance. YouTube did have some postings- of poor quality- that left DVD for me. I knew that I wanted to see it, Jonathan Shiff did good work in Ocean Girl, H2O and Alien Surf Girls. I bought the Australian DVD on eBay because there was at the time no sign of a US release. The US edition is a bit better than the Australian.

The only H2O connection is Mako Island (with a version of the Moon Pool) and mermaids, not a lot other than that. This time around our three mermaids are Nixie, Lyla (Lucy Fry from Alien Surf Girls) and Sirena- this time born mermaid, not magically transformed. They are members of a large ""pod"" of mermaids living in the waters around Mako and, full moon coming up, are given the task of keeping humans away from the island. The girls end up allowing human boys Zac & Cam do some fishing, ""they'll get a fish and leave""- they don't leave but spend the night camping.
 In H2O there was a surface tunnel access to the Moon Pool, this time around a cave entrance opens at moonrise and Zac finds his way to a chamber with a mysterious glowing design on the wall. He touches the thing and is magically dropped into the moon pool to the horror of the mermaid girls.
The mermaids somehow get Zac to the beach where he awakens the next morning. The boys return home, meanwhile Nixie and the other two are cast out for their ""crimes"" and the pod leaves Mako because of the danger now present (not explained until later in the season). Before leaving- Sirena's sister Aquata gives her a moon ring, ""she'll need it"", and the three mermaids are on their own.
Meanwhile Zac has discovered his new abilities and shows off to Cam. The three mermaids become human with the power of the moon ring and go after Zac.

While ""Mako"" has several similarities to ""H2O""; mermaids, powers (not quite the same as H2O), the island (new sort of Moon Pool) it isn't really a sequel but actually stands on it's own. While I think H2O might be a little better, many will prefer Mako Mermaids- it's worth owning and is so much better than the usual Disney channel junk, give it a try.

The most important differences between the Australian release (which most US DVD players can't play anyway) and the US is that the Australian had character profiles of the three mermaids, Zac & Cam and no captioning (if you have accent trouble or deafness), the US has captioning (with some errors such as similar sounding words spelled out instead of the correct words) and cast interviews. The cast interviews are just Amy Ruffle, Ivy Latimer, Lucy Fry, and Chai Romruen talking about the series (no captioning) while behind the scene  footage is shownthat's interesting.",1396137600,10,2758,4.519038076152305
6075521,4,B00GHH9HBI,"When this H2O spinoff came out on Netflix (which I don't, can't get- on my data plan) this past summer I knew I wanted to see it. I already knew that it was a spinoff and not a sequel, only vaguely resembling H2O.
Amazon didn't have it (my searches kept coming up with H2O instead of Mako Mermaids) and YouTube, only briefly, had awful copies of some episodes so I got a copy on eBay.

I find myself preferring H2O's cast and stories but- if you can play the DVDs- you'll find the picture and sound quality to be excellent, the FX are great. The only extras are character profiles.

Be warned though, I see that Amazon is offering both vol. 1 & 2 in Region 1 NTSC format on March 18th 2014 so if you were thinking of this DVD as a Christmas gift put a note under the tree instead. Why didn't it get offered in time for Christmas?
The Australian edition has a more attractive cover than ""our"" edition will have (no idea when/if their vol. 2 will come out) but with the NTSC format version coming out I'd buy this one only as a collectible of some sort.",1386806400,6,1051,4.198019801980198

6075559,5,B00GHH9HBI,"This is a good sequel to the original H2O, Just Add Water series. Alien Surf Girls viewers will be familiar with one of the mermaids, and the other two have their own respective charms. The addition of a merman sounds crazy at first but actually throws a whole twist into the storyline. I've only watched the first 13 episodes so far, but the series keeps me coming back. I hope it continues for a few seasons.",1443484800,,410,4.407894736842105

6075574,3,B00GHH9HBI,I purchased both volumes of season one for my daughter. She absolutely loved H20 and was disappointed when shed finished all of the seasons. I though this was going to be a big hit but it was a bit of a bust. Its not nearly as good as the H20 series. My daughter watched two episodes and lost interest. Wish they would have done something along the lines of a follow up to the previous story line.,1420761600,,397,4.1688311688311686

6075576,1,B00GHH9HBI,"It's always bummed me out that guys don't think it's cool to like merpeople. I mean no one thinks twice about girls liking pirates. They're just tomboys, no big. But if a guy likes mermen/mermaids...well...he's queer. I keep hoping someone, someday will prove that a person's sexuality does not correlate to their favorite fantasy character. That's why I bought Mako Mermaids. My hopes were so high that Jonathan Schiff Productions would accomplish just that.

Well, those high hopes took a nosedive off the Peak of Delusions and splattered all over the Sandy Shoals of Disappointment. I don't know what made me sadder; the fact that the much harped about merman only has brains and a backbone when he's the bad guy, or the fact that when he's 'good' he's stupid and spineless! I felt so cheated by the screenwriters. Here I was thinking that some amazing band of someones finally broke the gender barrier preventing macho men from admitting a closet affection for these 'sea'tizens, when all it does is confirm why guys hide their Little Mermaid DVDs under piles of smelly socks in the first place. Mermen are nothing more than mermaids without seashells; emasculated wimps incapable of saving the day w/out a deus ex machina from the screenwriters. Harsh words, perhaps, but after watching Zac Blakely in action, I can't think of better to accurately describe my disappointment.

So, in closing, if you're considering buying these DVDs because you're a guy who thinks that the idea of being a merdude sounds uber heroic and machismo stupendo, you're better off avoiding this show like it's a Mako shark.

*Just in case you decide to give it a whirl anyway, you may find this tidbit helpful. The description on the DVD box says it has closed captioning. But when I've tried to activate it my screen always says, ""no subtitles are available"". Since I have friends in the deaf/hard of hearing community, I thought it worth mentioning.",1416787200,4,1933,4.90519877675841

8623103,5,B00GHH9HBI,"Grab your gills, flip your tails & dive under the sea! When I first heard about a sequel to H20: Just Add Water, I was a little bit nervous, not really sure how they would be able to pull it off without bringing back the original cast members. But I was surprised that the only thing in common they had was Mako Island. It was like they totally changed everything, and I had a theory that it could've been the prequel to Just Add Water instead of a sequel. But in later episodes, it in a way it was kind of a mixture of both. Surprisingly good, and I liked that it wasn't just some cliche story. I was impressed with the writers who were able to create something that I feel that everyone will enjoy! :)

However, after watching the 4 seasons they have so far, I notice that they can't seem to keep the cast members, and that did send a few warning bells my way. But it kept things focused on the story line which was good.",1499644800,,923,4.127777777777778
