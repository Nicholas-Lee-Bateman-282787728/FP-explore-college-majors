8285978,5,B001C4ZQGQ,"This story is about a young man named Rin. Rin lives with his friend Kaede. Both of them lost their mothers in an accident, and Kaede takes care of Rin's every need. It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry. There is also a classmate named Asa who is gunning for his affections. After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.

This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too.",1354924800,2,920,4.317919075144508
8285979,4,B001C4ZQGQ,"I must admit, I didn't know what I was getting into. I bought the collectors edition at best buy without doing any research. Its was more of an impulse buy really. I watched it and found it pretty good. Im only commenting on the box in this review

I enjoyed this anime that I decided to buy the enders box set. What can I say, Im a collector in anything that I enjoy. Only came with vol 6 and of course the panties. Honestly, as a man, what the hell am I going to do with these god panties? Wipe my nose with it? Id perfer the stuffed animal cat that Primula carries everywhere.

The box is beautiful, but Im going to have to buy the 5 volumes just to complete the pack, which is why I gave this 4 stars. Thankfully, each vol is around 3$, but still.",1261353600,2,751,4.033557046979865
8285980,5,B001C4ZQGQ,"Well, this anime is definatley ment to be for older audiences, and NOT for shounen fans like review 1.(especially if you didn't buy the product) The story Finishes up in this volume, and it obviously is for fans of volume 1-5 or those who want the GOD panties. As far as the show goes, It is a typical moe show, and it has arcs as the other review wrote but it is showing all of the game in a short show, where as if it had a season for every girl, like review 1 wants, then the ender box would bundle with volume 26, not 6. In all, a good moe/harem anime with good animation and nice extras.",1241308800,3,592,4.02542372881356
8285981,1,B001C4ZQGQ,"I don't even know where to begin. I guess I should first say that Anime's based off henatai video games are always a bad choice. This awful garbage is no exception. Shuffle is like a roller coaster ride that gets stuck as soon as you get to the top of the tracks. It just breaks down, and crashes right before you get your thrill in leaving you with nothing but dissapointment. I've never seen a story line fall apart so quickly as I have with Shuffle!. This anime makes you hate it, it makes you dislike it. It's like they start out with some fun characters (minus the male lead he's an idiot), and just destroy any hopes of making them interesting or likeable. It's like they each have their own special episode that creates that suspense that something may become of them, then next episode BOOM! it's gone and that story arc is never brought up again. It leaves you feeling like ""what was the point in the first place?"" This is the first anime I've watched that I feel I didn't get anything out of, and that's saying alot for someone that got this series for free. I felt that I couldn't wait for it to end. I was hoping Rin  actually did end up killing himself, or that Asa went on and died just so that I could be put out of my missery of having to watch this garbage.

The bottom line is that I watched this series for free and I'm mad about that. I couldn't imagine how enraged I'd be if I somehow purchased this waste of carboard and plastic. I mean think about it, these materials could have been used to produce a box set worth buying like Solty Rei, Elfen Leid, Neon Genesis, hell... even Pokemon! Just anything put this garbage they call Shuffle! I mean this anime is bad, really bad! So bad infact that I've written a letter to myself in the future, so that in hopes that they make a time machine I can go back in time and save myself from ever having watched this garbage in the first place! I warn you, watch this at your own risk!",1237334400,2,1947,4.245283018867925
8285982,3,B001C4ZQGQ,"It would have been a bad choice between the characters I liked anyway but to pick one I didn't care for and didn't really think he would... boo.

Although I did like getting the ender box to collect them in and the GOD panties are priceless.",1222646400,,241,4.239130434782608
