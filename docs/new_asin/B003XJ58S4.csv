8408134,4,B003XJ58S4,Here in this volume the story of Gundam 00 is soon reaching its climax but the downside is the DVD itself has fewer episodes on the discs . No Special features and not much in the way of anything special.,1354320000,,204,4.125
8408135,5,B003XJ58S4,"I fail to understand why people choose to review products before they are released without seeing what they contain, focus on only one aspect of the product, or commit any other type of negative activity. Also, the other review gave this product a low score because (yet again) Bandai stated a release date then pushed the date back. I can understand a little because they've done it multiple times, but that's the company's policies, not the product, so it shouldn't be the main reason to give a low score.

As for me giving this product 5 stars, I have seen the episodes which will be on this release (through subtitles and youtube), so as long as the rest of the details are the same as past releases I have no reason to give it any less.",1283299200,3,741,4.448529411764706
8408136,5,B003XJ58S4,"Every Gundam 00 DVD and all other Previous DVD's from Bandai always seem to keep getting pushed back on release dates and this is rather annoying, this is a good way to lose customers and loyal fans if it continues",1283040000,,214,4.375
