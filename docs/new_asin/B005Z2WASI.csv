4906684,5,B005Z2WASI,"Excellent movie! These guys are my favorite animated characters! I have all the motion picture movies and their TV Nickelodeon series. If you loved the 'boys' in the Madagascar moives, you will like Op Blowhard! I do recommend it!",1372896000,3,230,4.923076923076923
4906685,5,B005Z2WASI,"I purchased all 8 available Penguins of Madagascar DVDs since Nick doesn't seem to broacasting Penguins any longer and it's not available on-demand on Verizon FIOS.  This DVD is a ""must have"", as are the other seven.  The total playing time is 73 minutes and the included episodes are: The Return of the Revenge of Doctor Blowhole Parts 1 & 2, and Dr. Blowhole's Revenge.",1368316800,5,371,4.6923076923076925
4906686,4,B005Z2WASI,"This Order I Reviewed After I received Them, Maybe I Didn't Have Enough Words Or Maybe I didn't Submit Correctly,
Goods Were Address Correctly, Wrapped Very Tight, And A Little Hard To Open But Made Secure
  Thank You",1354838400,,217,4.684210526315789
4906687,5,B005Z2WASI,"Blowhole is a great plot and of course the characters are playing their role to the hilt.  The many films concerning the team of great little black and white penguins are always entertaining and bring laughter again and again.  I have all their films, keep 'em coming boys.",1353196800,,273,4.666666666666667
4906688,5,B005Z2WASI,"This DVD, Operation Blowhole, is the first Penguins of Madagascar DVD we ever saw -- and, IMHO, the best one!  It's HILARIOUS!  We instantly loved King Julien -- he's so funny!!  So we immediately rented ""King Julien Day"" and ""Operation: DVD Premier"" only to be disappointed by King Julien's mean-ness & rudeness.  I realize that the essence of the King Julien character is self-centeredness, which is really what makes him so funny ... but he just seemed more ruthlessly selfish (almost evil) on the other DVDs.  In fact, we returned those two DVDs after just one viewing; didn't feel like exposing our kids to that.  However on *this* DVD (Operation Blowhole) he wasn't mean or ruthless, just funny -- which makes it more ""family friendly"" for us. (Our kids are 6 and 4.)",1336521600,3,773,4.774436090225564
4906689,4,B005Z2WASI,Although the DVD contained just a few episodes it is almost an hour in length. Almost like it was a special or something. Overall I think Manfredi and Johnson would have approved of this one.,1335484800,,191,4.485714285714286
4906690,5,B005Z2WASI,"This is pretty funny, I thought Alex the lion was kinda weird in this but hey...he was always sorta weird.
The end was funny as well but I am not going to say anything, You'll just have to see for yourself.
Great show though!",1334966400,2,225,4.136363636363637
4906691,5,B005Z2WASI,Absolutely hilarious! I have to say these four penguins are definitely very entertaining and funny. My kids absolutely loved it and the price was also quite good.,1329350400,2,162,5.037037037037037
4906692,1,B005Z2WASI,"The penguines are great, the ""new to the zoo"" DVD might be the funniest thing I have ever seen, with ""zombie"" being a close second.  Problem with this DVD is half of it you have already purchased if you purchased ""Operation DVD"".  Basically, you are being ripped off, because rather then offering the penguines in chronological order, they are packaged in ""sets"", and this ""set"" is anchored by a repeat.  The second half of the story tries to be ""different"", so the character interaction is not as funny because the individual characters are not acting like themselves, there is also a prolonged appearance of the lion from Madagascar, which I never liked anyway, which is why I bought a Penguines DVD not a Madagascar DVD.  If they want to sell a new DVD shouldn't it be new content?  Guess they don't make as much money that way, guess I will wait for reviews before I buy another one!",1329004800,36,887,4.5886075949367084
4906693,5,B005Z2WASI,"This is a great kids show but also a good show to watch with them.  Everyone can get a laugh out of this movie. If you like the penguins at all then you will love this funny, cute and over all humorous movie.",1327881600,,208,3.8372093023255816

4906698,5,B005Z2WASI,"My son loves these penguins.  I think he gets a little too carried away with the characters.  He watches them over, and over and laughs throughout the day watching them. Great price & Quality!!!",1394150400,,194,4.676470588235294

4906703,4,B005Z2WASI,"I like this video and my kids LOVE it. It is one of the best penguins story lines.  The musicals in the second part are funny and my kids love to sing along.  I especially love the Power Ballard as older Proud Metal head.  The only reason I didn't rate it as a 5 is because the first episode is one another Penguins dvd, so now I have two of the same episodes.  But that being said, if you or kids like the Penguins this is definitely a must have.",1376697600,,447,3.933333333333333
