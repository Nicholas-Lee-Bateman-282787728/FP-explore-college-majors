8015555,5,B0001OGVTE,"Red Skelton, one of the great comedians of a by-gone era. It probably helps to have been growing up when these shows were current. But these are great ole-timey fun shows. If your 60-ish, I bet you like them.",1427846400,2,208,4.358974358974359

8015557,4,B0001OGVTE,"This is a solid set of Red's earlier b/w work. However as a previous reviewer wrote, some of the material is repeated. It's a shame that they repeated the material like that on the same set. I was very disappointed to see material being repeated. But, for the price, I guess it's a fair set. There are better set's out there but they are more expensive. Would I recommend it perhaps, but, the buyer should be aware that the given time includes material shown over again in the same set.

8015558,3,B0001OGVTE,"These discs contain skits, out takes, and full shows. The full shows include commercials and singing/dancing numbers- remember Red Skelton had a variety show. Fabian sings in his appearance. The best part was the ad libs or when he forgot his lines. He had some great straight people to play off of and several times they steal the scene. Youll really be taken back in time when Tide was a new detergent for wringer washing machines. Red works the sponsor and products into his comments. Sure different from today.

While some skits are funny, fans of Red Skelton will be disappointed that his gut splitting skits do not fill the discs. Some of the skits are repeated on the 2nd disc. My preference would be for his show in the late 1960s through the 1970s.",1356393600,5,757,4.607407407407408
