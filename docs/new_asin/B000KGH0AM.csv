8156652,5,B000KGH0AM,"My 3-4 year old just loves these series and will sit for hours if we let him as he watches them.  I have to say that he does learn things on them all.  It does give a good overview of things he sees like trucks, ships, etc.  This is a good one on building homes and wood production industries.",1296345600,,293,3.9322033898305087
8156653,2,B000KGH0AM,The guy that leads the kids through this DVD...'Backpack Jack'...is kind of hokie.  Not very interesting.  It didn't hold my grandson attention.,1283731200,,144,5.5
8156654,2,B000KGH0AM,"I gave two stars because I like only 1 of the 2 episodes. The first half (building) is pretty boring...and not just because of the annoying Hard Hat Harry character. The Lumberjacks episode is very interesting to my son who is 2. For seeing building/construction equipment, I recommend the Construction episode. Much more interesting.",1268352000,,334,5.203703703703703
8156655,5,B000KGH0AM,"My little boy loves Police, Firetrucks...any kind of truck period! He loves these video's. To be honest my older kids 5- 10 years old love them also.
I also like the fact that most of the video's come with 2 shows in one...so less dvd's in the house and more $$$$ in my pocket.",1247011200,,277,4.148148148148148
8156656,5,B000KGH0AM,"my son has been in love with this, and other hard hat harry dvd's, from age 2-3.  I am amazed that he wants to watch how buildings are made, but he requests this show often.  It's got entertainment but it also is actually about how to build a house, using adult terminology and concepts, what I would have thought was too advanced for him.  I think it's great.",1242864000,,360,4.264705882352941
8156657,5,B000KGH0AM,My son loves Hard Hat Harry and he has almost all of the videos.  This is one of his favorites and asks to watch it frequently.,1231632000,,127,3.8846153846153846
8156658,5,B000KGH0AM,"My son who is 4 LOVES this DVD. His favorite is the Lumberjacks. I recommend the ""All About"" DVDs for kids.",1228003200,,107,4.142857142857143
8156659,4,B000KGH0AM,"This looks like a decent, fun series for kids who like to know how things work.",1215648000,,79,4.0
