8407740,3,B003X3BYMO,"Features a collection of clips about celebrations, goals by goalies, non-fighting, kiss cam, and more. Hosted by Darius Rucker.",1489017600,,127,5.7368421052631575
8407741,3,B003X3BYMO,"When watching this on an HD set, there are two blurry bars added to the sides of the standard definition imagery to make it fit the HD format.  It wouldn't be too bad except you can see unrelated motion in the semi-clear sidebars making it very distracting.  The content is fine, just the presentation and technical aspects are poor.",1362182400,,333,4.627118644067797
8407742,5,B003X3BYMO,This movie is a winner in our household.  We put it on in the car heading to a pro hockey game and the group of boys did nothing but laugh and cackle.....kept them occupied the entire car ride and got them in hockey mode for the game they were about to watch.,1361491200,,259,3.980769230769231
8407743,4,B003X3BYMO,This is a great video!  The entire family laughed the entire way through.  Nothing like bloopers to bring on belly laughs!,1353196800,3,122,4.761904761904762
8407744,2,B003X3BYMO,"As a die hard hockey fan, and as an adult, I found this a little hard to watch. It's kind of like America's Funniest Home Videos where you have Bob Saget saying dumb stuff during the clip, all the while you're thinking to yourself, ""This host is an idiot.."".
Although he is Canadian, the host Cabbie Richards seems like he's never played a second of hockey before and displays little working knowledge of the sport. He says a few words.......and then waits three seconds....... while his lines are fed to him....... through his earpiece. This gets kind of annoying! And, the humor that Cabbie supplies is super lame. Super lame.

This DVD is for kids. Good footage, but not for hardcore fans.",1336694400,10,692,4.672131147540983
8407745,5,B003X3BYMO,I bought this as a birthday gift for my nephew.  He hasn't seen it yet~we are celebrating his birthday on Thursday of this week 3/22.  I am sure he will love it. He is an avid hockey player.,1332201600,,190,3.973684210526316
8407746,5,B003X3BYMO,Perfect video that shows unusual hockey plays from the NHL.  Interesting to see things that happened that I forgot about or never heard of.,1326412800,,139,4.791666666666667
8407747,4,B003X3BYMO,"Slightly different than I imagined but still worth wild.

I purchased this DVD as a gift for my nephew (turning 3). He simply loves everything to do with hockey, so I thought this was a must. He opened it and shouted ""hockey!"" While he did enjoy the cover, he was too active to stay and watch it. We played the DVD and the adults loved it.

To be short, its basically the best hockey bloopers. It had good memorable moments and included the pros like Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky.",1323043200,13,483,4.355555555555555
