8660690,5,B00KQ05TGE,"Chao Pangs DVD Manifestation of Chi goes a long way in demystifying Chi and provides exercises for its cultivation. The DVD is divided into helpful sections which include: The explanation of Chi in the Energy Principals, the practice and cultivation of Chi in ""Finding the Flow"" and ""Lan Zha Yi"", the Mother Form.  These exercises are inner teachings that are considered the secrets to mastering Wu-Hao Taiji.  Wu Hao Taijii is the subtlest of the various schools of Taijii and is known for its smaller frame and simpler forms. The focus is on the inner form rather the outer, physical form. The practices are, of course, meant to be applied to the individual forms in both the 49 form and the 96 form Wu Hao practices. This understanding of Chi, space and flow can be used to enhance any Taijii practice, not just Wu Hao.

There are two sections in which Chao Pang demonstrates both the 49 form and the 96 form.  He does not break each form down or repeat them, but they are easily reviewed by clicking the skip button at the bottom of the screen.

In terms of my own practice, when I was introduced to Wu Hao Taijii as taught by Chao Pang, I felt like I had come home.  It is exactly the emphasis on Chi, space and flow that was missing in my other experiences with Taijii and from most books on the subject.  This understanding not only has transformed my Taijii practice but also has had ramifications on many levels for moving through daily life.",1427500800,3,1451,4.515267175572519
8660691,5,B00KQ05TGE,"Chao Pang is a fantastic teacher of Wu-Hao Tai Chi.  The Wu form is actually the most sophisticated & wonderous tai chi & Chao Pang teaches all about it!  His explanations are clear & fascinating to me.  I have been practicing tai chi for over forty years so to find such an engaging teacher was quite a surprise!  The production values are great & I really like watching & listening to it over & over as he covers
so much interesting material.
Big Bonus is that I watch it & practice tai chi with him on my computer screen. I feel like I am getting a private class with a true master!
I love this!!",1427328000,3,599,4.182608695652174
8660692,3,B00KQ05TGE,"Wu-Hao Style is very interesting. It has small arm movements without crossing the body and emphasizes turning to either side rather than stepping forward. It's reputation is that it is the best style to develop ""chi"" since it relies less on physicality than any other style and, otherwise, specializes in in-fighting as a martial form due to its turning skills. I am very interested in this style, however, there are very few actual resources regarding Wu-Hao style of tai chi, so I was excited about this DVD.

Summary: It is a very good introduction, however, it is completely lacking as an instructional resource and, accordingly, it is overpriced for what information is provided.

Mr. Pang is a friendly host and his sincerity is apparent. He begins by providing a history of the style and, thereafter, discusses 13 energy principles to emulate as one practices the style (e.g. chest open, shoulders down). Next, he provides a set of chi kung exercises to begin developing the small, meditative movements which characterize this style.

Thereafter, three forms are presented: Lan Zha Yi (the mother form),  the 49 form, and the 96 form.

Lan Zha Yi is actually one posture/movement which can be done either to the left or to the right. The form is simply the Commencement posture and then doing the LZY posture to the left, then to the right, then to the left, turning and doing right LZY, left LZY and, finally, right LZY before a final turn and closing posture. The form is a teaching tool to learn the slow, rounded arm movement common to the style, how to step properly, and the toe/heel turning maneuver prevalent throughout this style. Mr. Pang is thorough in his instruction on this ""mother form"".

The two actual forms, 49 and 96, however are merely shown one time each by Mr. Pang without any instruction or advise. So, while the DVD does give you a good sense of the unique qualities of the style, it would be very difficult to learn any of these forms unless you have substantial patience to continually rewind and, otherwise, to analyze how the feet and hands should be coordinated in each posture and transition. Such is way beyond me and, so, the DVD serves no material instructional purpose (at least, not for me).

The DVD is well-organized and the presentation is highly professional. It is very informative. However, I find $30 to be too much to pay for general information. At this price, I expected instruction of, at least, the 49 form. Since no such instruction is included, I must give it only three stars.",1413417600,16,2534,4.784897025171625
