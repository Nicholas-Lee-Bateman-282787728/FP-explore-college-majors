7919995,1,B00004CWLU,Stolen from a library and in really bad condition. The movie plays though. I was just expecting better than this.,1388275200,,113,4.7
7919996,5,B00004CWLU,"This is a must have for fans of Thunder In Paradise. Despite the absence of my second favorite actor Chris Lemmon, this movie delivers on all angles. Grace Jones yells a lot, Hulk Hogan interacts with a smart-aleck parrot, and---just like in Thunder--there's a ton of great jet-ski footage.",1382832000,,290,4.938775510204081
7919997,5,B00004CWLU,"As strongly as I recommended ""The Secret Agent Club"", I endorse this even more intensely. So if you were thinking of buying ""The Secret Agent Club"", buy this first it's better. And if you already own ""The Secret Agent Club"", buy this and be prepared to get REALLY blown away.",1134864000,,275,4.52
