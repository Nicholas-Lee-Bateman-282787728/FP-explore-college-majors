8315266,2,B001KL3H0S,"This bio was missing a lot--eg, Toscanini quietly said Bravo when he heard Chaliapin sing in rehearsal--and said Chaliapin was the most talented singer he had ever meet--Chaliapin bombed in the US because of his too-realistic behavior in Barber of Seville--other opera singers were astonished at his acting ability--and his friendship with Rachmaninoff was just about unique in friendships between men--and what about his visit to Tolstoy with Rachmaninoff?",1307318400,2,457,5.63768115942029
8315267,2,B001KL3H0S,"I'm not sure excatly why this failed to satisfy me. Certainly the film has all of the basic information and the short clips with his daughter (I wish her interview was more extended) are fascinating. Possibly it's that the narrator's voice is uninteresting or perhaps it's because so little of Chaliapin's singing is used. In any case, it is not a bad effort, but simply one which will have to do until a better one is available.",1305331200,3,429,4.584415584415584
