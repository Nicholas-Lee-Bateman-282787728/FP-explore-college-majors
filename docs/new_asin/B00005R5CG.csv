7951709,1,B00005R5CG,"If ever there was an example of a film that should have never been made, this is it.  The advantage of a video presentation of a subject is its ability to attract viewer interest through the use of both image and sound.  Instead, the creators of this video have managed to deliver an hour of excruciating mental flack, which was both a challenge to endure and a temptation to stop the video presentation.

The presentation begins deceptively with an exciting soundtrack and gothic images that are commonly found the horror genre.  Unfortunately, this wonderful first impression becomes a false hope that leads to greater disappointment.  Shortly after the introduction to the film series, the video launches into maritime footage and then deteriorates into highly narcoleptic repetitive sequences.

These sequences included the scrolling of faux vintage manuscript texts, silent film re-enactment of early settlers kneeling to pray, nature walks by the experts featured in the film, portraits of early American and British icons, tedious panning over skeletal and artifact finds.  This technique of image repetition forcibly reminds viewers of what a communist indoctrination video would employ.

Re-enactments of settlers unloading cargo from ships, early settler real estate, firewood gathering, slow wandering around the shoreline and writhing terminally ill settlers also did nothing to ignite the remotest interest in the film.  These depictions are better left confined to the minds of film makers as they only serve to enhance viewership decline.

Also, scenes and narrations of archeological techniques such as gentle scraping of the earth, the inadvertent laboratory tour, footage of the expert browsing through a book and his departure from a building seem to illustrate the dearth of creativity involved in this production.  The excitement level and pace of the film was as kinetic as the skeletal remains they were conducting research on.

Despite the melatonin inducing qualities of the video mentioned, there is a fleeting moment of suspense where the possibility of a plot to poison the settlers is raised.  This faint glimmer of hope for the film is quickly blanketed by the film's inability to depart from its inherent snail's pace.  It does not help that the expert testimony and opinion provided in the film is delivered by old men in beards, reminiscent of grandfathers lulling their grandchildren to sleep with a bedtime story.

In conclusion, it is perhaps the content and direction of the film that defined the movie's fate from the start as it is a monumental challenge to breathe life into a story about the demise of an early settlement town's population.",1249430400,,2681,5.26056338028169
7951710,2,B00005R5CG,"I really enjoy the ""Secrets of the Dead"" series, but this has to be the most disappointing one I've seen.  The basic question is this:  does the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem house the burial site of Jesus of Nazareth?  And the answer is: maybe or maybe not.  Which is basically the same answer I could have had before I watched the program.

The viewer does learn that the edicules, or shrines, which cover the traditional burial site within the church are still intact.  At least, it appears that way.  The program was not able to answer this definitely, but it may be that every few hundred years, a new edicule has been built over the previous one, so that there are now four edicules standing over the supposed site of the burial.  However, there is no way to get inside these edicules without taking them apart, and so, there is no way to know what, if anything, lies beneath them.  So is the ""Tomb of Christ"" here?  They don't know.  And they didn't need to use 50 minutes to tell me that!

Two stars. The viewer might learn a few interesting facts about the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, but there are few answers about the tomb here.",1181520000,3,1154,4.4170616113744074
7951711,5,B00005R5CG,"""Death at Jamestown"" tries to determine what caused 80% of the inhabitants of Jamestown to die in just three years, starting with its founding in 1607.  The worst drought in 700 years hit the Americas at that time, so that most likely was a cause.  Unsanitary conditions was probably another.  Hostile natives never help.  But was there infighting in the colony?  Perhaps.  And what about arsenic poisening?  Could be!
This episode looks at all the factors (known and possible) that led to the failure and abandonment of Jamestown.  While some seem to be a stretch, there is some circumstancial evidence which makes one at least consider the possibilities.
This is a well-done production, with much evidence (some very convincing) to support the various theories.  A few history books blaming the ""laziness"" of the colonists may have to be re-written!
Five stars.",1061424000,4,863,5.0638297872340425
