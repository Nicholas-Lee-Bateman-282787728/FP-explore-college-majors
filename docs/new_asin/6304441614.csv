876185,4,6304441614,"The foundational story, which is the 1961 capture of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann by the Israeli Mossad, is engrossing.  I thought the Argentine post WW II atmosphere was nicely created.

The weak link was Arliss Howard, who played the principal agent in the capture operation.  Very, very weak.  At one point during the mesmerizing dialogues that took place in the makeshift temporary ""jail"", I recall thinking what a shame it was that this lightweight actor was turning in such a shallow performance during this intimate and captivating interview of the infamous Eichmann.  Then I had to remind myself that this wasn't Eichmann . . . it was Robert Duvall.  Which brings us to the matter of Robert Duvall . . . .

Duvall deserved an Oscar for this.  (I realize that this was a made-for-cable film and it was impossible).  Just an awesome piece of work on his part.  He became Adolf Eichmann. SUPERB!

Watch this for two reasons:  It is a very important and well presented piece of history, and, to watch the great Robert Duvall in perhaps his greatest performance.",1220054400,4,1069,4.781420765027322
876186,1,6304441614,"The story ofthe capture of Eichmann, is extremely simple. It can be described in 2 sentences. And that happens to be the content of the movie. So to fill an hour and a half the director had to fluff up the movie with very very very long conversations. After a while these conversations get so boring that you can't help pressing the fast forward button. Which brings you right to the end of the movie.",1126051200,,401,4.36
876187,4,6304441614,"Nazi mass murderer and holocaust kingpin, Adolph Eichmann (Robert Duvall) is located by the Mossad (Israeli Secret Service), in Argentina in 1960, with the help of a blind holocaust survivor.
The task to capture him is handed to Peter Malkin (Arliss Howard) , an Israeli who lost his sister and nephew in the holocaust, thanks to the work of Eichmann. He is to lead a team to Argentina to capture Eichmann alive, and to take him back to Israel for trial, so that the truth can be exposed to the world and so that the world will know why a Jewish homeland must exist!
What follow is a re-enactment of the whole plan, how it was carried out, and the interaction of Malkin with Eichmann, after the latter is captured.
It is done in a made for TV documentary style, more given to realism than to action and drama, but is important to watch for those who want to know more about the holocaust , and the hunt after World War II for Nazi war criminals.
We need to relive these events , because the role of the Nazis has been overtaken by others , who wish to enact genocide against the Jewish people, particularly against the Jews of Israel .",1098921600,11,1135,4.38388625592417
876188,3,6304441614,"The bad guy is played wisely by a good actor; the good is played by an imitation of an actor. I don't think the capture of Eichmann in '61 was a party. Howard plays like it was one. Could have been Dean Martin instead, result would have been the same. Otherwise, interesting tv movie. Not more than that.",1034726400,2,304,4.258620689655173
876189,4,6304441614,"Any time you get the opportunity to see Robert Duvall work, you should take it. When the pot is sweetened by the chance to learn a little  (or a lot) about an important historical event, then it's a no-brainer.
A far  more carefully crafted story line distinguishes this film from the 1961  `Operation Eichmann'. The source of this film is the book, ""Eichmann in my  Hands"", by Massad agent Peter Malkin, the primary Israeli Agent involved in  Eichmann's capture in Buenos Aires.
The film is presented pretty much  from the point-of-view of  Malkin, played superbly by Arliss Howard, an  actor who's career to date is papered with non-distinguishable work in  non-descript films. His portrayal here is right on target. There is a nice  turn as well by Jeffrey Tambor, a wonderful comedic actor, here cast  completely against type in a serious role.
Much is the time when TV has  been dismissed as a learning medium. Thankfully, made for TV movies like  `The Man Who Captured Eichmann"" go far to dismiss that notion.",952905600,24,1015,4.8313953488372094

7871117,4,6304441614,"The Man Who Captured Eichmann, 1996 film

It begins in Argentina. There is a cattle round-up. Cattle are being shipped away for processing in Buenos Aires. People eat in an outdoor caf. A man quickly leaves after meeting a man in dark glasses. In Israel Mossad agents practice their trade. There are few photographs of Eichmann; can he be identified? This would be a very important job for this team. Operation Attila begins. Surveillance continues to verify identity. The team arrives in Buenos Aires. [They would travel singly to avoid notice.] Military forces patrol the streets. [No mention why this is done.] A house is rented. Men practice a capture. There is a plan, it is criticized, then revised. Watch the preparations. It begins to rain. [A good omen.] The bus arrives, it does not have the passenger. But another arrives with the target. Momentito, seor.

He is captured. The rain hampers sight and hearing, but no one was there. The man is questioned and admits his identity. A loose end is secured. [Men wear hats.] Later he is questioned about his former associates. He worries about his family. His captors worry about his health: food, exercise, elimination. Eichmanns on visits a hospital to search for him. Eichmann tells about his past. The fortunes of war. He had been assigned to study Jews. Then he was in charge of transportation, nothing more. Now the Israelis have to transport Eichmann for trial. Eichmann boasts he kept his trains running instead of being used for military transportation! [In effect, he sabotaged the military effort!] He justified his actions as just following the law. [Should unjust laws be obeyed?] The team is bored. There is danger in delay.

Eichmann listens to music. The Argentine police watch the airports and shipping ports; he cant be taken out of the country legally. Eichmann is asked to sign an agreement; he does. The Israeli Foreign Minister visits the country. The airplane will have an extra passenger, one dressed in an air crew uniform. And so they leave for Israel. There was a famous trial, conviction, and execution. It established a legal principal. [You wonder about the fear of other hidden Nazis.]

This is educational, not an entertaining action film. It reminds me of the old You Are There TV series popular in the 1950s. This was the big news of May 1960. Along with that stopped U-2 flight. In 1976 the book A Man Called Intrepid was published and told about war-time activities. Yes, they knew what was happening but kept it secret. This movie shows the methods used by secret agents, like some movies about intrigues.",1443139200,2,2597,4.882086167800454

Duvall did a great job, and I loved the addition of Her Muller, played by Gregory Dayton, as the SS officer trying to stop the kidnapping..
it gave some excitement, though he was probably the only part of the money that wasn't historically acurate.",1311465600,5,287,4.538461538461538
