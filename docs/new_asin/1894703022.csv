I leaned interesting facts about how Greek sailors planted olive trees and remembered why I loved the olive oil I purchased there far too many years ago. It is honestly the best olive oil I have ever tasted and seems impossible to buy here, except occasionally I can get it through mail order.

Still dreaming of a return visit. How could you not fall madly in love with Provence!
