4314010,5,B004B93RCO,"If you need a good laugh, watch this! Denis Leary and friends are very funny. I laughed really hard, and I am sure you will too, as long as you aren't a douche bag. The band is great too.",1333152000,,187,3.8205128205128207
4314011,5,B004B93RCO,"If you like coarse and gritty humor you will love this!  I personally didn't care for the opening, but afterwards it is simply great.  I am going to buy this DVD for everyone in my family and all of my friends.",1329955200,,210,4.097560975609756
4314012,4,B004B93RCO,"I just watched this last night. Lots of laughs. All of the comics are good. I really liked Lenny Clarke's set.

I was particularly amused when Denis was ranting about guys wearing wool hats in the middle of summer just because they saw Brad Pitt or Colin Farrell do it. All the while Denis is dripping sweat, his t-shirt under his leather jacket is soaked in it. Wouldn't want to take off that leather jacket! It actually made the joke funnier.

Very funny show.",1316908800,7,462,4.488095238095238
4314013,5,B004B93RCO,"Denis Leary is at his best in this video. If your a fan of Denis Leary or of Rescue Me you will find this to be very funny. Lenny Clarke is a gem in this as is Adam Ferrara, they have a new comedian with them and she is quite funny also Whitney Cummings. All in all you will fall in love with this video",1310428800,5,303,3.6769230769230767
4314014,1,B004B93RCO,"Rescue yourself by not watching this one at all.  This was by far the worst comedic performance I've ever seen.  From a guy I though was hyterical, failed miserably at trying to make people laugh.  Quite honestly, I hope I never see this guys face again.",1307750400,4,254,4.478260869565218
4314015,5,B004B93RCO,This is a hilarious DVD! Its' Denis and friends at their best. It's worth buying and the money goes to the charity Denis founded in 2000 for firefighters and their families.,1306972800,3,173,4.612903225806452
4314016,5,B004B93RCO,I actually had the opportunity to see this live in Chicago last year and was really excited to be able to have this on DVD to watch again.  Very funny stuff and worth the road trip.,1301875200,2,181,4.027777777777778
4314017,5,B004B93RCO,"Father Dennis Leary delivers again. I could not stop laughing after watching this special on Comedy Central. He says what everyone else is thinking but is to scared to say. If you have a sense of humor, I definitely recommend watching this show.",1295654400,7,245,4.72093023255814
4314028,5,B004B93RCO,Who does not like Denis Leary.  Funny as hell.,1449187200,,46,4.111111111111111
4314029,3,B004B93RCO,Not what I was expecting. OK but mostly disappointing - middle two comics were not that good. Dennis and closer were ok.,1441843200,,120,4.5

4314034,4,B004B93RCO,A little saner Denis Leary is a good sequel to his first stand up but the first one is funnier.,1425600000,,95,3.8
4314035,2,B004B93RCO,I really don't appreciate anyone making fun of someones religious beliefs.  I wouldn't listen to anything of his again.,1420243200,,119,5.2631578947368425
4314036,5,B004B93RCO,I bought this for my boyfriend who is a Rescue Me fan and I know he was laughing a lot so I give this 5 stars.,1415318400,,110,3.269230769230769

4314039,1,B004B93RCO,"I don't mind the profanity, it's the smut and the reference to God that bothers me.",1405468800,,83,4.25
4314040,3,B004B93RCO,"This is not a Leary stand-up concert. Granted, I knew that going in, but I was still expecting more Leary. The jokes are a bit more stale and the presentations are uneven, coming as they are from various comedians, each with their own short solos. Leary's solo act about ED drugs was quintessential Leary though, and worth the cost of the DVD all by itself.",1402185600,,357,4.507692307692308
4314041,1,B004B93RCO,"My husband and I are all for a crude movie, we love it but this one was just for shock it seemed. Not funny and Dennis constant jokes about child rape and putting a cross on set was in very bad taste.",1394755200,,200,3.7857142857142856
4314042,1,B004B93RCO,I thought it was funny but not worth the price of buying. Would be nice to have the option to rent.,1392595200,,99,3.761904761904762
4314043,4,B004B93RCO,"Dennis Leary's irreverent humor at it's best. Definitely not for kids or those who are easily offended, but very very funny.",1371340800,,124,4.9523809523809526
4314044,5,B004B93RCO,"Leary and friends, Lenny Clarke, Whitney Cummings, and Adam Ferrara, are all hilarious here! Leary especially is just awesome, classic Leary! Leary has NOT faded from his comic heyday, like some reviewers say, he is at his best here, especially in his rants against the Catholic church.",1369008000,,286,5.1063829787234045
4314045,2,B004B93RCO,"Dennis was alright, but his friends straight out sucked.  Have seen better standup at some local amateur nights, want something better try Louis C.K.",1365897600,,149,5.208333333333333
4314046,1,B004B93RCO,"Mr. Leary is Reaching, and is desperately trying to bring 'humor to the table'; comedic singing isn't his 'cup of tea'. The 'friends' portion of the show was at least more entertaining than Dennis. Much Better Days:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ref/dp/B006RXQ1EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ref</a>",1365811200,,351,7.585365853658536
4314047,2,B004B93RCO,"I've enjoyed Dennis Leary in the past and figured I'd give this a shot.  Wow was I disappointed.  I made it through 30 minutes and realized that I hadn't laughed once.

He seemed off on this recording.  Missing lines and off key deliveries were the norm.  You saw the jokes coming as soon as he started the segment.  Far from inspired work.",1364342400,,340,4.403225806451613
4314058,4,B004B93RCO,"Was ok, the surprise was the other comedians and the band. Over all the show Mr Leary put on was funny.",1364256000,,103,3.9523809523809526
4314059,5,B004B93RCO,"What can I say, Denis is hilarious and hits the nail on the head with the state of society today. He's as in tune to America as was George Carlin.",1364169600,,146,3.9
4314060,5,B004B93RCO,"The gritty Bostonian Denis Leary tells it like he sees it and pokes fun of anyone and everyone who falls in his target zone. Not only does he do standup, he sings with an accompanying rock band and has guest comedians as well.",1363478400,,226,4.27906976744186
4314061,4,B004B93RCO,"He is funny but you gotta be ready for his down and dirty sense of humor. He doesn't pull punches and tells it like it is. Hits current events that are just too stupid to be real, but they really happened.",1362787200,,205,4.024390243902439
4314062,4,B004B93RCO,"I love Denis Leary so anything he does is ok with me, but this had others in it also and they were all pretty funny too. Lenny Clark was the funniest of the others.",1359676800,,164,3.8529411764705883
4314063,1,B004B93RCO,If you like vulgar jokes this might be for you.  He better stick with the Ford commercials where someone else writes the material.,1357516800,,130,4.6521739130434785
4314064,1,B004B93RCO,"I'm soooo glad i have the prime membership.  It cost me nothing to flip thru this horrible performance.  Simply pathetic.  You know you it gonna suck when the primary actor must rely on a monitor.  Reminds me of an elected official that was recently re-elected.

Amazon should allow negative stars.",1357257600,2,298,4.88
4314065,5,B004B93RCO,"I love dennis leary, he is brilliant. The rest of the comics are pretty awesome in their own rights as well. Definitely worth the watch.",1356652800,,136,4.48
4314066,1,B004B93RCO,"Dennis is slowing down, this show sucked! Celebrity Mug shots from 20 years ago for the first 20 minutes or so when the show finally starts. He cant sing and the song wasn't that funny any way. I could only watch this crap for 25 minutes or so.",1354838400,2,244,4.104166666666667
4314067,2,B004B93RCO,"Bad things inevitably happen when comics attempt to crack jokes about politics. With as much certainty as the first law of thermodynamics, people who agree with said comics and their political views assure them that this is their funniest and best material. This has more to do with the fact people like being told things they agree with than actual humor. Even worse, people who don't actually find it funny (in other words, the vast majority of people who don't need their policy positions spoon-fed to them by comedians) will be hesitant to speak up for fear of being labelled ""offended"" or lacking a sense of humor.

It's one thing to get up on stage and tell controversial jokes......if they're funny. It's another to get up and state a political diatribe with intermittent pauses for laughter and applause. This is mostly the latter. Regardless of whether you support liberal policies or not, the material just isn't that funny and Leary relies heavily on the confederacy of the audience to pull off the performance.",1339286400,,1022,4.907514450867052

8421643,3,B004B93RCO,"I love Denis Leary. Compared to his first DVD (NO Cure for Cancer) which I think is one of the best standup performances ever recorded, it's kinda hard to follow-up. I wanted to see more Denis Leary and less of his friends. But it was good. After watching it like 3 times, I was kinda done with it. OK though. And it's Denis!",1490918400,,325,4.174603174603175
