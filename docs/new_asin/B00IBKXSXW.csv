6256589,5,B00IBKXSXW,This is a very interesting video.  If you are interested in World War II it is really worth watching.,1452816000,,101,4.315789473684211
6256590,2,B00IBKXSXW,"In my opinion, not great. One of those British documentaries where they have actors representing non-speaking roles of the historical people. Hitler is unconvincing - much too good-looking, and trying too hard. Himmler is chilling. The film is continually interrupted by the faces of the narrators jumping on the screen, and by brief street scenes of traffic in Berlin: but while they are talking about Berlin in the twenties, the street scenes show vehicles from the forties. It is very disturbing to me. It might not bother somebody who doesn't analyse things the way I do. I particularly hate the imposition of these narrators' faces on screen.
I learned a few details that I hadn't known. Other than that - a waste of my time.

6256591,5,B00IBKXSXW,"Well documented story of Hitler although I will continue to puzzle over how he got a whole nation of reasonably intelligent people to follow, and even assist in, his madness and evil dreams. Could it happen today? Guess so as there are ISIS and other scary beliefs and believers out there. A must see for anyone who wonders what WWII was about.",1441411200,,344,4.564516129032258
6256592,4,B00IBKXSXW,"This is a highly informative look at how Hitler, Herman Goerring, and a handful of others started the Nazi Party and soon brought it to power in a war torn Germany desperate for leadership and direction. Unfortunately the German people chose these mad men to follow and attempt to restore Germany back to prominence. There are wonderful films and pictures of the demonstrations that took place in Munich as the Nazi Party began its climb to prominence with such actions as the ""Beer Hall Putsch"".

This DVD is well worth the investment for anyone interested in the history of the years between the world wars, and the rise of Hitler and his Nazi Party.",1429056000,6,652,4.719298245614035

6256595,5,B00IBKXSXW,"EXCERPT from the movie:  ""This is the story of how Hitler and the Nazis bent an entire people to their will and groomed them into participation in the most evil regime in history.""
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent in-depth DVD documentary detailing through the voices of a number of historians how Hitler lured the WWII German people into adoring him, glorifying him and following him into the most evil and criminal regime in history.

Most WWII Germans did, indeed, enthusiastically support Hitler's Nazi regime.

There are 7-10 internationally recognized and respected historians narrating this documentary who are experts on WWII history.",1404691200,12,703,6.142857142857143
6256596,5,B00IBKXSXW,"Fast paced history documentation. Astonishing film archival use with commentary from experts. Narration of historical fact seems more like TV news reports. Nazi history is reawakened with an educational perfection. Modern reenactments (segments in color film) are extremely convincing compared to the B/W visuals of the 1930-40s. Few people alive today lived in these times--BUT--all need to view this DVD, as lessons can yet be learned. Nazi tactics are alive and well in the world; just renamed.
There are many Hitler and Nazi DVDs to choose from. This is a good look at the high points of the rise and fall. Good for teens through all adults, but be aware, there is graphic war footage.

SUBTITLES for all 10 50 min. segments.
1 NAZISM IS BORN: Hitler makes his political more at WWI's end. He recruits Goring & Himmler and prepared ""Brownshirts"" (SA) to help him siege leadership of the new Nazi Party by 1921.

2 BECOMING RESPECTABLE: Nazi propaganda rises through Goebbels after Hitler is released from prison. German economy is improving--until 1929. Success includes the black uniformed SS.

3 SWIZING POWER: 1923's Depression & street violence sparks Nazi popularity and Hitler is in position to take command of Germany. A master of political theater, he takes the election. Night of the Long Knives leads to the Fuhrer.

4 IN POWER: Fuhrer Hitler strengthens the army and cuts unemployment. Forced new laws identify new Nazi enemies targeted during Kristalinacht (Nov 1938). War is next; and Volkswagon for the Volk.

5 PREPARING FOR WAR: Hitler unveils accelerated land grabs via military invasion of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. WWII begins Sep 1939. Axis alliance.

6 HITLER'S BIGGEST BLUNDER: Russia invasion, Japan & Pearl Harbor, Stalingrad, North Africa, German city bombing, and the tide turns. Hitler underestimates America in 1941.

7 THE FINAL SOLUTION: With a 2nd World War going badly, Hitler places blame for German history losses and trouble on Jews. The German citizens are groomed for Holocaust. Jewish war is its own front. Zyklon B.

8 PLOTS AND DELUSIONS: Battlefield losses cause an officer coup plot. Hiltler clings to victory belief in late 1944.

9 ENDING GAME: Soviets nearly to Berlin. Hitler, a personal wreck at age 56, vows to fight. Other Nazi heads go into self-preservation mode. 1945.

10 AFTERMATH: Allies open Jewish camps with some survivors and many corpses. A program to end Nazism coincides with the Cold War start.

8640708,1,B00IBKXSXW,"I thought I'd add a review since there's only one.  HISTORY MAKES THE WORST DOCUMENTARIES ON EARTH!!!  They are far from intellectually stimulating, they use silly jump cuts, gratuitous graphics, silly dramatizations (#1 sign of poor film making), ridiculous sound effects and stupid Transformers like music scores.  THEY ARE AWFUL!!! NO HISTORIAN is employed by History as a producer and it shows!!!  They're all cheap, corny, TV jockeys.  Now they're ruining the Brits documentaries as well - the best in the world at constructing them.  PLEASE STOP HISTORY - They only people that watch your garbage are 13 year old mouth breathing fools who don't care and hate them by the time they mature and see how terrible they are.  This doc is shallow, silly, filled with terrible interviews making stupid emotional commitments, voice overs and dramatizations -  They use SWOOPING sound effects when cutting and Camera Snap shot sound effects POINTLESSLY AND AT NAUSEAM.  Its so forced and desgined to create drama - speculating on Hitler's sex life - Really?  Its WORLD WAR TWO - You don't need to fabricate any Drama!!!  JUST AWFUL!!!  FIRE THE PERSON MAKING ALL THIS TRASH.  History has NEVER produced a good documentary - they're famous for it.  I hate History Channel!  There's nothing historical about it.  Dreadful.",1475107200,,1316,5.079439252336448
8640709,5,B00IBKXSXW,"THIS IS A GREAT SERIES ONLY UNTIL I WATCHED THIS DID I REALIZE THIS IS THE SAME AS THE SERIES ""NAZIS:EVOLUTION OF EVIL"" THAT CAME ON AMERICAN HERO CHANNEL!!",1472774400,,156,4.413793103448276
8640710,5,B00IBKXSXW,"This is the same series repackaged by AHC as ""Nazis : Evolution of Evil"". The main difference is the announcer is British, but he seems to have the same script. Also, the episodes might be a minute or two longer (based on reported run length) than Evolution of Evil (not that AHC would cut programming content to fit in more commercials ;) )

One draw back is there are a number of ads you have to skip through at the beginning of the DVD.

If you like the AHC series, run out and grab this while they last.",1466208000,3,507,4.163265306122449
