1888821,1,B00009RDHD,"My husband and I couldn't wait to get Series Three.  We were so excited about Katrina and Archie finally getting together.  They were so well suited.  Series Three takes a plunge downward.  We can't ""stomach"" another series and will not be ordering Series Four if there is one!!!",1118361600,2,279,4.75
1888822,5,B00009RDHD,"We have seen all the series, but the 3rd is even better than the other two. Great cast, stories, and scenery. You do not need to be Scottish to enjoy this masterful series of Scottish life.",1117843200,5,189,4.277777777777778
1888823,3,B00009RDHD,"I can't say that the series improved in year three, but it was still entertaining.  I'm angry that Katrina's leaving was taken so flippantly.  I find that the story lines seemed redundant, too.  I like the character Archie, but I think they spend so much time making him seem an idiot, or at least very naive, that he lacks depth.  Well, if you're caught, you're caught.  I will continue watching.",1116806400,5,397,4.614285714285714
1888824,1,B00009RDHD,"I loved Seasons 1 and 2 - absolutely loved them.  BUT, after waiting for two season to see Archie and Katrina finally get together and then have her, out of the blue, leave the show was too much.  What the hell was that all about. All of a sudden she gets this dream job offer that we've never heard of and she's gone.  No farewells, no goodbye party, nothing.  It's almost as if she never existed.  Certainly none of the characters seems to care.  Yet we are supposed to believe that she loved Archie and Glenbogle?  Bah, humbug.  Actually, to be fair, I only watched the first episode.  When I realized that she had been written out of the show I didn't watch, nor will I watch any more episodes.",1116633600,5,698,4.3076923076923075
1888825,5,B00009RDHD,"This series is beyond a doubt, one of the most unusual and delightful series we have witnessed. Is is just a joy. I have asked for series 3, and as soon as series 4 is available, I'll order that. Just a wonderful production.",1112572800,6,224,4.232558139534884

1888827,5,B00009RDHD,"You've made the boglie population (in this neck of the woods) very happy with finally releasing Series 3...when do we expect to be able to order Series 4?  ;) If you love, Series 1 and 2, you'll love Series 3!  :)",1108684800,11,213,4.170731707317073
1888831,5,B00009RDHD,Dvd was exactly how the seller described and I was very happy with the purchase and delivery!,1266883200,2,93,4.529411764705882
1888832,5,B00009RDHD,Alexander Morton tells a good story and I thoroughly enjoyed this series of his.  I recommend it to other readers.,1265587200,,114,4.7
1888833,3,B00009RDHD,"In the third season of Monarch of the Glen, the young laird, Archie MacDonald, is still working hard to keep Glen Bogle from going bankrupt.  To that end, their creditor bank's provided some unwelcome aid in the form of Stella Moon, who is to work as the estate's business manager. The only estate resident who likes her is Duncan, who likes Stella a bit too well.  And let the MacInations continue, Stella's doing her best to work her way into Archie's affections.

I still love this program, but this season is a bit trying. Between Stella and a bad-apple MacIntosh, we have got some serious troubles for the good MacDonald clan.  Less humor and more conflict here.

The end of the series is a heartbreaker which still brings tears to my eyes.

1888834,5,B00009RDHD,"Series Three continues a very entertaining story of life on a Scottish estate.  We watch Archie and the family and staff suffer a great setback when the bank sends Stella Moon to take over running the estate.  Then we watch Archie mature and regain confidence while learning to work with Stella.  At the end of the  series the family faces tragedy, and we are left wondering if Archie has finally found a love that will last.  Alastair Mackenzie, Richard Briers and Susan Hampshire excel in their roles as Archie, Hector and Molly MacDonald.",1239667200,3,541,4.774193548387097
1888835,4,B00009RDHD,"This picks up directly after the events of Season 2<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monarch-of-the-Glen-Series-Two/dp/B0001DMUCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monarch of the Glen - Series Two</a>.  Archie needs some serious financing of his estate and quick.  The bank sends out Stella Moon an accomplished executive/BOW(depending on your perspective).  Throughout the season she has mandates and proposals that go against the Glenbogle household.  Alexandra Gilbreath is a good addition to the cast.  However, the show's writers did not seem consistent with her character development.  An ambitious woman can fall in love.  In one episode she was intentionally sabotaging her chance for a huge career advance.  For what?  She had fallen in love with Archie/Glenbogle.  No promise of a ring.  If she is having conflicts make it without having to suspend too much disbelief.

Simon Weir was also a good addition as the cad/developer, Stuart MacIntosh.  You wanted him to be just the honest business/love rival to Archie.

I know many people are dismayed by Archie's emotional density, I found this to be positive.  It established consistency to the story.  After all, it shows he's a chip off of the old block of Hector MacDonald.

Susan Hampshire continues to be excellent.  Julian Fellowes as Hector's frenemy Kilwilly adds to the cast.  Hamish Clark, Alexander Morton, and Dawn Steele as the household adds to the series.

Katrina Finlay's(Lorraine Pilkington) exit did not affect myself as much as others' exits.

Monarch of the Glen has a character for everyone.",1200787200,3,1600,5.638655462184874
1888836,4,B00009RDHD,"I enjoyed this good highland drama so far.
The plots have been intreasting, and there is always romance.
So far so good!",1190160000,,120,4.5
1888837,5,B00009RDHD,"My wife and I own all DVD's available in this series and absolutely love them. Series 3 remains my personal favorite. The characters really seem to hit their stride and settle into their rolls in 3.

I like the tension that Stella Moon brings to the storyline and how could you not wish Hector was your own Granddad? Unlike others, I wasn't invested in the Katrina / Archie relationship and wasn't bothered by  Katrina's departure. I was, however, terribly sorry to see Hector go. Series 4 and beyond seemed to lose their center of gravity without Hector.

The writing is consistently good in all episodes, but series 3 seems to have more continuity and flow to the overall story. Can't understand the negitive reviews of others.",1187827200,5,729,4.76984126984127
1888838,2,B00009RDHD,"I watched series 3 very soon after greatly enjoying the first two series.  Disappointment is the only word for my reaction, and I'm trying to imagine why so many reviewers liked it. Only the beautiful scenery and Molly are there to recommend ""3"".  It is as if all the humor and energy of the other main characters had been drained.  Plots got very serious (new writers, surely), and the addition of the new bank character added gloom (she seemed to be in some psychological drama, not ""Monarch""!). Romance in these episodes is unconvincing, and, after the tragedy at the end, there is no mention or appearance of the daughter and grandchild or other key characters in the first two series -- unforgivable!  If you loved the first two seasons, as I did, then remember them fondly and let them stand.",1176076800,4,798,4.678571428571429
1888839,5,B00009RDHD,"Wonderful acting, believable characters and breath-taking vistas; Monarch of the Glen is pure family entertainment.  Better than anything that can be found on American television.",1171152000,,179,6.16
1888840,5,B00009RDHD,"More of the best scenic Scottish countryside, more family hijinks, and more of everything to love about this series.",1169769600,3,116,5.157894736842105
1888851,5,B00009RDHD,"I love this series. It has humor, romance, drama, and much more. I am just sad that they stoped showing it on PBS/WGBH in the USA. They got us up to season 4 and then just left us hanging. I hope they bring it back soon. (Or they lower the price on Season 5's dvd.)",1157760000,4,265,3.8363636363636364
1888852,4,B00009RDHD,"TV shows are rarely as good once the original cast members start being replaced by ring-ins, and this is the last series of 'Monarch' that still features all the old crew.

Hector is still at his crotchety best, Lexie is her old sassy self (but perhaps growing a little wiser in the ways of love), and Archie is still struggling with the often conflicting desires to live his life, and secure a future for Glenbogle.

In my opinion the first two series of this show really are the very best, but this one with it's humor, drama, poignancy and farce, isn't far behind.",1143072000,5,567,4.495145631067961
1888853,5,B00009RDHD,"My daughter and I absolutely love the whole series of Monarch of the Glen--in fact, we've already ordered the 4th series even though it isn't out yet!

It's got everything for the Anglophile/BBC lover: funny, witty, and some of the most incredible Scottish scenery I've ever seen.

It's just too bad they stopped making it!

1888854,5,B00009RDHD,What a perfectly written light hearted look at life in the highlands.  I absolutely recommend this series for the whole family.  You will lose yourself in the characters!  A great alternative for the mindless trip on network television today!,1137801600,4,242,5.153846153846154
1888855,5,B00009RDHD,"This series continues the addictive, comical, and yet sometimes poignant story of our favorite fictional Scottish family.  (Picture ""Northern Exposure"" with kilts and the Scottish highlands and you'll have a pretty good idea if this series is for you.)  True, there are some significant changes this season, but the cast is still as refreshing as ever and the storylines are gems.  It is truly rare when a show can be as good at making one laugh as it is at eliciting tears, and this one certainly has those skills.

I highly recommend this series for anyone who wants something a bit different--a walk off the beaten path, but with all the features that make us similar:  familial problems, love, jealously, life, and death.  This series has a little something for everyone!",1125360000,14,775,4.877862595419847
1888856,4,B00009RDHD,"I love the quirky characters in this series, but have become a little impatient with the constant romantic triangles and the general denseness of Archie when it comes to matters of the heart.  His parents can pretty much be counted on to stick a crowbar in the spokes of any project too.  Couldn't the complications come from outside of the glen ocassionally?  On the other hand, the supporting characters are all first rate.  The season ends on enough of a ""down"" note, however, to make me wonder what Mollie and family will be able to do to cheer the whole clan up again.",1124841600,9,573,4.533980582524272
1888857,5,B00009RDHD,Once again the BBC strikes gold with a series I enjoy immensely.  Highly recommended for those who just can't seem to get enough of Britain's programming.,1123977600,2,154,4.923076923076923
1888858,4,B00009RDHD,"I have to resort to the American DVD releases, so I have only seen what is out on DVD:(  Release them faster!

This season brings the bank into the lives at Glenbogle and all kinds of fun happens as a result.

The only thing I really hated was the end - not only because Season 4 isn't out yet, but because the wrap up was somewhat lacking and felt like maybe the show had been cancelled and they wanted to tie up some loose ends quickly.  I know the show goes on, and have no idea if it was in trouble or not at the time, but it does feel like that.

Despite this, I found myself glued to it and watched the entire season in just a couple days then sent it to my mother who did the same thing and then my friend who also sat and watched the entire series.

Thanks for another great DVD release - keep them coming!",1121731200,15,814,3.96319018404908
1888859,4,B00009RDHD,"I found this season much better than the first two.  Frankly I didn't realize how much I found the Katraina character annoying, until I was able to watch the series without her.  Her character became irritating in that she was always jumping to ridiculous, biased conclusions about Archie to the point where you just wanted to shake her.  I realize that the writers were trying to keep some sort of conflict going between the two characters -- but really I think that's all that they had between them. They wrote almost no real moments of connection and understanding. If this had been someone that I knew in real life I would have thought Archie a complete idiot for having any interest in such a self-righteous holier-than-thou prig.

I thought that this season's conflicts with the bank's representative, while also contrived, did at least follow naturally from their conflicts over the need to make the estate viable financially.  The final result of all of this is actually a reasonable culmination, as the plot follows where the emotions are connected.  So I really liked this season.",1119571200,11,1090,4.896739130434782
1888860,5,B00009RDHD,"I just don't understand the negative reviews.  Series 3 had some of the wittiest episodes to date as well as the most heart-wrenching ones.  It introduces some memorable new characters, including Stella, an alpha female banker handpicked to bring Glenbogle out of debt.  Hector and Molly are as charming and as eccentric as ever.  This is a series not to be missed, and I wish Series 4 would come out quickly, since in the U.K., Series 5 has already been released.  Monarch of the Glen is television at its best.",1119052800,24,512,4.644444444444445

7992805,5,B00009RDHD,"Quality of the show continues. I love this show, the acting, the scenery.

Let me just give a warning to US fans who are looking to order all the series. Series 1-3 are the same episodes in the UK and US. But starting with series 4, the US DVDs are edited and we're missing scenes. I realise PBS and BBC America had time constraints and adverts to fit in, but I thought with a DVD they do the full release. When I ordered Series 4 I found I was wrong.
