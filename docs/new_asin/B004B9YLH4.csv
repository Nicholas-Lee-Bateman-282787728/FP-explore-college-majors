4314775,4,B004B9YLH4,Fast and fun 4 mile walk! This is just added to my Leslie collection and I love it. It is fast so be prepared! :) Would recommend for a good workout!,1366156800,8,149,3.838709677419355
8421746,1,B004B9YLH4,"I like to mix it up even if a lot of her DVDs really are very similar. I played the 4-mile today and heard the ""Every time I kick I kick a cat,"" and couldn't believe my ears. That's enough to put me off Leslie. It's just not funny. To people with cats, their cats are family. That's like saying: ""Every time I kick, I kick my child."" WTAF?! You just don't say that! You sure don't let it go out like that. Edit. Something. Wish I'd never heard it because I just bought some more Leslie stuff and I'm really put off.",1468540800,2,515,4.009708737864078
8421747,5,B004B9YLH4,"I am no stranger to Leslie's walking DVDs.  This one is a bit easier than most.  If you are a beginner, or want an easier 2 mile walk, go with this one.  But as always,  I love Leslie and her energy!",1457049600,,199,3.7804878048780486
8421748,1,B004B9YLH4,"In the four mile walk, at the start of the second miles, Leslie goes: ""And now we kick! And every time I kick, I kick a cat! Haha! Take that, cats! Giggle giggle!!""

Seriously? What's so funny about animal abuse?

The best Leslie DVDs are those where you can do the workout with a music-only track option, and not have to listen to the incessant and inane chatter. She frequently improvises small talk aimed at her onscreen walkers, but because she's ad-libbing, what she says frequently comes out as insulting, and then she tries to backtrack and makes it worse. Just call the exercise movements, please, Leslie. It's OK not to talk for a few seconds.

Picking the music-only option (which is not available on this DVD) also spares you her bad English (""let the body temperature raise"") and her Christian references.",1431302400,,817,4.73943661971831
8421749,5,B004B9YLH4,"Even though I am an advanced exerciser who loves intense cardio and weight training, I also love doing walking and easier exercises.  I have learned the hard way that one can't be doing intense exercise all of the time.  Well, one can try, but then a lot of injuries happen.

I am reviewing this from two perspectives:  1. That of an advanced exerciser and 2.  That of a beginner.

This little gem has two workouts:
* A 30 minute, 2 mile walking and strength training routine.
* A 60 minute, 4 mile walking routine.

A bonus light resistance band is included as well.

WALKING AND STRENGTH TRAINING ROUTINE (30 minutes)

This was least favorite of the two routines.  I found the pace excruciatingly slow.  I didn't feel a thing when doing the strength moves with the light resistance band.
I liked this routine better when I did it a second time.  I added two pound weight gloves to make the walk a tad harder.  I also used a medium resistance band, which helped me feel the moves.

This would be a great routine for those very new to exercise since it is fairly gentle.  It's also a good way to ease into strength training.

SUPER CHALLENGE (60 minutes)

I loved this routine.  My heart rate was up there the entire time!  This has the usual Leslie moves of basic walking, side steps, kicks, and knee lifts.  It was also very helpful to have the mile markers to track your progress.  The beat of the music is perfectly synched with the moves, so it is an added motivation.

I love doing workouts like this on my rest days.  I feel that I am getting my body moving, but I'm not overstressing my joints or my body.  I feel so energized and happy after completing this workout.

Overall, I really enjoy Leslie as an instructor.  She sure talks a lot, but I find it funny and it's a good way to distract myself from the workout.  She is also very nice and encouraging.
I was happy that the background exercisers came in all shapes, sizes and ages.  As attractive as the fit 20 somethings are, it's more motivating for me to see `regular' folks as background exercisers.

If you are fairly new to exercise or if you are looking for something to do on your rest days, this workout may just be for you!",1430784000,2,2196,4.393034825870647
8421750,5,B004B9YLH4,"This is a great two for one collection.  The Walk Strong is just 30 minutes and ideal for a short, energetic workout.  The Super Challenge is a little easier, but much longer so also a great workout.",1425772800,2,199,4.351351351351352
8421751,4,B004B9YLH4,Really fun and enjoyable!,1423180800,,25,5.5
8421752,5,B004B9YLH4,"I am happy with the DVD. I do listen to music on my iPod while doing her exercises.  I haven't tried the Super Challenge yet, but I'm looking forward to it.",1417996800,2,156,4.032258064516129
8421753,4,B004B9YLH4,"This DVD includes two workouts, one a four mile program of walk aerobics, the other a two mile program with strength training with the resistance band.  I liked the workout, but I already have the four mile walk on another Leslie Sansone DVD called ""Walk Away Pounds Ultimate Collection.""  Just be careful you don't have the Ultimate Collection before you buy this one.",1412121600,8,369,4.841269841269841
