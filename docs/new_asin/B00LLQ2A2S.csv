6490328,5,B00LLQ2A2S,Having seen the first two episodes I must agree with Mr. Howard that this is a noteworthy series.  I also agree with Jack about the bed business; I get the metaphor for moving Chicago buildings but that was silly.  I'm a bit put off by some of the connections made by the writers such as today's data collection is based upon the cholera victim mapping done in London in the 19th century.  It seems a bit tortured but still somewhat thought-provoking.  I'm looking forward to the remaining episodes on PBS and recommend this series.,1413676800,,532,4.627659574468085

This program, How We Got to Now, is one of the most interesting new science based series that I have ever seen.  It tops my list of great new series of 2014.  It takes me back to some of the more interesting topics from my study in microbiology and chemistry and provides the visuals to make for engaging television.  Steven Johnson has a great ability to connect with the viewer and literally goes to great depths, sloshing around San Franciscos sewer system, to give an extremely fascinating perspective of how historical events have lead to where we are today in society.  If you are able to view this series on your local PBS station, as I was, you are in luck.  But Ive enjoyed this series enough to purchase the DVD to have for future viewing and sharing with friends and family.",1413504000,23,1058,4.542105263157895

We love documentaries. I started this one day when I was home by myself. Four minutes into the first episode, I realized that I had to wait and watch this with my spouse. It is one of the best series of documentaries we have ever seen. Every episode just opens your mind of just how great our world is and how it came to be. Also I wonder why I was never taught any of this in school. The research that was put into this series must have taken years. It is appropriate for young children too. It is amazing how people we have never heard of made our current lives possible. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this!

6490345,1,B00LLQ2A2S,"When I first saw this, I was hoping it was like James Burke's connections series. Well it attempts to be, but fall quite short.

There are lots of positive reviews here so I'm going to focus on the problems.

First, he says things that are just not factually true - for instance in the episode about glass he talks about how it led to mirrors and how this break-through was the first time people could see themselves. While large mirrors are nice, it is fairly obvious that there were metal mirrors that worked fairly well a long time before modern glass.  Also, people would see their reflections in water. Unfortunately for him saying something that sounds profound, but isn't true, induces indigestion rather than awe.

His description of Charles Vernon Boys makes him sound like a crackpot that only discovered fiberglass rather than a physics that has contributed in many fields ignoring that he used his fiberglass to make a better measurement of the gravity constant - what a miss!

So the writing is not nearly of the caliber of the Connections series. But there is another problem even worse. The narration by Steven Johnson is annoying. If he wrote it or someone else, the self centered bit - as if the series is about Steve rather than the evolution of technology is unforgivable. Couple that with constant dropping of PC propaganda and his dripping of condensation and what could have been a delightful series was ruined. After seeing him with his forced smile, smarmy pompousness, misplaced conceitedness, narcissism for a couple episodes I can only think if I saw him at a party I would move to the other end of the room or leave. I have decided to re-watch Burke's old connections series instead.

<time passes> I did re-watch Burkes old connections series - Still awesome - still relevant - the real thing.

6490348,2,B00LLQ2A2S,"I cannot recommend this program. A friend assures me the book is better, so you might try that, but the program is not good. Leave aside Johnson's distracting gestures. (Couldn't someone tell him to put his hands in his pockets?) This comes out of the ""Gee Whiz"" school of history. The learned explainer will tell you all about the ""mavericks,"" the ""garage tinkerers,"" the ""people you've never heard of"" who revolutionized the world and you will be amazed! And it's nonsense. Galileo (""Time"") was no tinkerer, nor a maverick. (Copernicus had demonstrated the reality of a sun-centered system some years earlier.) (And do not tell me about his skirmish with the Church. Six popes were fine with his teachings, only one disagreed.) And how is it possible to talk about ""Clean"" without mentioning the germ theory of disease, nor Pasteur, nor Koch? These were trained scientists working in laboratories and using scientific principles, not maveicks, not tinkerers; and hardly unknown. If you have to get your learning from your TV, try ""Connections."" Or you could always try reading a book on the history of science. Try Boorstin's ""The Discoverers"" and go from there. You might even try Johnson's book.",1444521600,5,1199,5.030150753768845

There are six great episodes here that are both informative and fun.  Strangely , there's a scene in episode one where our host is carried on a litter that angered several people  It was done in fun so just enjoy the pointless scene and move on.

6490392,5,B00LLQ2A2S,"This is an interesting book about six inventions that have created the modern world.

One of the most interesting is the story of glass, something we take for granted.  It turns out that the molecular structure of silicon dioxide just happens to let light through.  Otherwise there would be no glass.

Time is probably the most relevant topic since we seem to losing it as modern life demands that we rush around in a frenzy.  An unknown fact the author mentions is that before the industrial age people used to sleep in shifts.  They would go to sleep at dusk, get up after about four hours, and then sleep again for the last four hours before dawn.  Much of today's insomnia epidemic is due to the forced eight-hour sleeping shift.

Another interesting story is about clean and the fact that 100 percent clean water, used for making microchips, would actually harm you.  It would leach minerals from your body.

As one reviewer states, most of these inventions were made by individuals with a new idea.  Contrast that with today's demi-god Obama who berates free enterprise  in his scheme to create a socialized mass herd.",1417478400,,1124,4.737113402061856

The episodes in this new series are a bit more simplistic, but that's not a bad thing. I would say the shows are informative and entertaining - but the host comes off as being a bit goofy which can be annoying at times.

With this two disc set, you get six episodes - Clean, Time, Glass, Light, Cold, and Sound. Plus, there is a bonus interview with the host. Each episode is about 55 minutes, the bonus interview is a little less than three minutes. The episodes are subtitled in English.

Like the Connection series, there is a book associated with this series - the host is the author.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-We-Got-to-Now-Six-Innovations-That-Made-the-Modern-World/dp/B00INIXU5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World</a>.",1415404800,3,1207,6.178571428571429
6490398,3,B00LLQ2A2S,"While Johnson has an affable grin and high quality production values, it is not really fair to claim that these stories are untold. James Burke did a much more thorough and dramatic job illustrating many of the same points in his ""Connections"" series thirty years ago. You can find episodes on Youtube. This is the third episode, from 1978: http://youtu.be/vBb7UD62woE.

Credit should also be given to economic historians such as David Landes, who used several of the same inventions to demonstrate human progress in his wonderful book, ""The wealth and poverty of nations: Why some nations are rich and others so poor."" More recently, Niall Ferguson's ""Civilization"" and the accompanying TED talk (http://www.ted.com/talks/niall_ferguson_the_6_killer_apps_of_prosperity) offer many of the same insights about medicine and science in furthering human life. Even Matt Ridley's ""When ideas have sex,"" (http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex) tells us a lot about the importance of linking often seemingly disparate ideas into grand movements.

The common theme across all of these observers and analyzers of history is the role of human ingenuity in creating innovation -- often for personal gain or out of sheer curiosity -- that changed the world in dramatic ways. Contrast this with the current Dem credo, ""You didn't build that."" and you appreciate the role of the ""little guy,"" the capitalist, the innovator, and the maverick. Yes, the government built the Hoover Dam and funded the Manhattan Project, but give credit where credit is due to the people with ideas that changed the technology if not the politics of the world.",1414972800,12,1644,5.51984126984127
6490399,5,B00LLQ2A2S,"As a scientist and inventor, I find ""How We Got to Now"" to be a delightful series on invention and innovation. Steven Johnson focuses on six area of innovation: glass, cold, sound, clean, time, and light. For instance, in glass, he traces the development of lenses, eyeglasses, telescopes, microscopes, and fiber optics.

The stories of invention and how society has been changed is fascinating. For instnce, clocks and railroads gave us time zones and standardized time based on atomic transitions, not on the rotation of the Earth.

In the course of the series, Johnson reveals a little-known realization about invention. Invention is not always the result of a light bulb going off over an inventor's head.  He emphasizes the role of collective information exchange in invention.  By confining all of their glass blowers to a single island, the Venetian authorities fostered the collaboration of the workers, leading to innovation.  One of the glass blowers of today tells Johnson that he learned more spending time in the tavern than working in the shop.

Of my 118 issued United States patents, there are a small number for which I am the sole inventor. These represent the light-bulb-above-the-head type of invention. The majority were inventions-by-committee, where typically three or four people of different backgrounds combined their knowledge to come up with new solutions. When I was interviewed by another company about how we did invention at our company, I emphasized the importance of networking.

I thoroughly enjoy Johnson's informal style of storytelling. I also agree with his thesis on the nature of invention.",1414022400,21,1631,5.25

Amazing wealth of information that will get you going days and days after watching each segments since you will be exposed to so much information that it will get you to do more search and more reading about those geniuses, inventors and creators introduced in six hours of this documentary. Informative, educational and extremely well done documentary. Must see. Bravo, bravo, bravo.

GLASS: No one knew when the first genius who created the simple glass from sand, that simple glass creation would be the start of many new generation of other discoveries which would guide human beings beyond 20th century from fiberGLASS boats to 2.1 trillion dollar fiberopticGLASS industry to carry light through glass to cameras to telescopes to your simple iPhone.

CLEAN: John Snow, a genius whose daring dedication in finding a solution to a disease called Cholera took him to the center of England by proving that the cholera is spread through water not breathing the infected air as many assumed in 1800s. To prove that cholera is in the water not in the air, in 1985 John Snow went door to door by recording the number of deaths at each address in Soho when everyone was trying to leave Soho just to prove his new radical idea of collecting data in finding a solution to a disease. It was John Snow's approach of gathering data which was a push inaugurating the new science of epidemiology using maps and surveys instead of lab-based experiments to uncover the pattern and causes of diseases. This world owes a lot to John Snow for revolutionizing many industries through techniques of gathering data not to mention that I owe my health to John Snow since although I love beer, I do not care for alcohol but his research of no cholera at the brewery is a good data for me to keep beer as an important part of my diet.

TIME: In 1583, the 19 year old Galileo writes to a friend ""The marvelous property of the pendulum is that it makes all its vibrations, large or small, in equal times."" Then a Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens produces the first true pendulum clock. Thanks to Aaron Dennision a madman to many but only a visionary to the smarts who can not simply accept conventional wisdom who sticks to his vision and democratizes watch in 1840. In US in addition to each town having their own time, each railroad had their own time as well and there were 50 different railroads. Thanks to William Allen, secretary of the General Time Convention who introduced and figured where to divide the four different time zones in US which where divided on the basis of where different railroad lines ended. In November 18, 1883 the bells of Trinity Church rang out the first ever 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.",1414022400,27,2735,4.705636743215031
