8136842,5,B000H5VEFS,"I didn't know quite what to expect when I ordered the DVD. It was fascinating how these men were able to handle these big motorcycles with limited suspensions in off road conditions. Almost all were amateurs, and in 1952, three BSA 500 cc Star Twin bikes taken off the assembly line, did just normal maintenance, road to Austria, competed and the ISDT, each won a gold medal. Afterwards road to Oslo Norway for a total of 5000 miles to win the Maude Trophy. I just cannot see this generation of riders even wanting to complete in the ISDT on bike taken from the production line without any modifications. So far watched it twice, very entertaining.",1393372800,,648,4.643478260869565
