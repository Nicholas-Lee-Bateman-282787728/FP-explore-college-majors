8537343,2,B00979KQ54,This was not what I expected. The part Delores Del Rio played amounted to nothing. This had to be cut up. Made no sense At all.,1395964800,,127,3.923076923076923
8537344,5,B00979KQ54,"Why did I love this movie so much? Because of its romantic ""Boys Own Adventures"" style plot? Because of the nobility of the characters all madly sacrificing themselves for love? Because of the clever dual role twist? Because it conjured back a time when heroism, patriotism and a stiff upper lip where represented without irony, without smirking?
All those things but above all, because it showcased the unique personality that was George Sanders at the beginning of his career, even then, sardonic, seductive and insouciant.",1387065600,,525,5.188235294117647
8537345,5,B00979KQ54,If you've seen and liked Man Hunt (1941) then you will definitely want Lancer Spy.  The lovely and talented Dolores Del Rio lights up the screen with co-star George Sanders in this WW I espionage thriller.,1379203200,,205,4.694444444444445
8537346,5,B00979KQ54,"Provides historical stereotype or German military leaders/aristocracy that led to eventual defeat.  Surprised to see some actors who became Hollywood stars.  Typical Bristish humor aimed at the rigid German culture.
As a German speaker I enjoyed several instances where German responses were part of a conversation, but were not translated in subtitles.  Some scences, like the car chase, went too far in trying to make the Germans look inept/stupid.",1364342400,,450,5.492753623188406
8537347,2,B00979KQ54,"I've waited years to see this movie, and I'm not sure I have seen all of it yet - between the obvious breaks/cuts and a transfer so dark I couldn't even read the titles. Enjoyed what I could see, but it's such a shame MGM are charging top dollar for such poor quality.",1354406400,8,268,4.0754716981132075
8537348,4,B00979KQ54,"Let me begin by saying how thrilled I am that 20th Century Fox has joined the bandwagon by releasing many of their old classics in a new MOD series. They had stopped releasing all of their golden gems on DVD, which was disappointing to me, since their library is one of the best from the Goldne Age of Hollywood. I've purchased a number of these films in the MOD format, and I was looking forward to ""Lancer Spy,"" which I hadn't seen in over 45 years (when I was in my early teens). It's a complicated espionage thriller in which George Sanders made his Hollywood debut, and he's excellent in a dual role. Now, here comes my complaint. I don't know the movie by frame-by-frame, because it's been so long since my last viewing, but while watching it, I found the plot rather disjointed, and some scenes were jumping to the next scenes with no transitions whatsover. The running time of this MOD release is just about 75 minutes, so I decided to do a little research. First, I checked my very worn copy of Leonard Maltin's ""Movies on Television,"" which I've had since 1968. When it comes to running times, this book is extraordinarily reliable, and it gives the length of ""Lancer Spy"" as 84 minutes. Then I checked IMDB, which is more accurate as to the current running length of oldies, given the fact that some of them have been cut over the years, and discarded scenes often are lost forever. IMDB states that the running time is 78 minutes, so this version is even three minutes shorter than that. I'm not saying not to buy it, but I am saying that you may find yourself frequently scratching your head when it comes to the plot. If you are a purist when it comes to classic movies, as I am, a missing nine minutes is a VERY long time.",1349740800,15,1737,4.414330218068536
8537349,4,B00979KQ54,"George Sanders plays a British spy in WW I who resembles in appearance a German officer; when the officer is captured, Sanders doubles for him and returns to Berlin to get information on an invasion plan. But Peter Lorre as a German major becomes suspicious of Sanders and assigns spy Delores Del Rio (""cleverly"" named Dolores Daria) to learn what he's up to. She and Sanders fall in love and she helps him get the secret plans. She's caught and killed, but Sanders escapes to Switzerland with the plans to Britain's advantage. Sanders, who had played only bit parts up to this point, became a star with this picture, and he is superb. The espionage story moves along dramatically, and the climax is exciting and compelling. To show that Sanders was not just a heartless patriot, at the end we see that he returned to Berlin every year after the war to pay his respects at Del Rio's grave. Well done all around.",1149379200,4,911,4.595092024539877
