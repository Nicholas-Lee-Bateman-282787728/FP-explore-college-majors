2158568,5,B000621P5Q,"I had a lot of fun watching this movie on an iced-in day. The fact that it pretty much clips along at 2 hours really helped the adrenaline rush. I thought the actors were all good in their roles ( Uday Chopra is a slight exception, but that's also because I really hate the bumbling comic relief guy that's trotted out in movies like these. Still the buddy-movie vibe between him and Abishek is nice). John Abraham is totally hot as the mysterious thief Kabir, and the bike stunts are the true stars of the movie and acquit themselves well. The songs are all high-energy and well-choreographed. I am glad they didn't try to shoehorn in a ""sad song"" etc. The film-makers did a pretty good job keeping everything ( styling, stunts, music, etc) to the character of the movie. I'll be curious to see if the blockbuster casting of dhoom 2 can  maintain the peculiar excitement of the movie or if it will fall victim to the ""bigger! better!"" syndrome. No matter, as long as there's at least one shirtless villain to gawk at. C'mon, all the Indian movies I watched as a kid featured hairy, pudgy dudes. I'm way overdue for my Indian eyecandy.",1168992000,2,1135,4.509708737864078
2158569,3,B000621P5Q,"There's really nothing original about DHOOM. It's a slick-looking action film done up Bollywood style, and if you're prepared to go into this film with that Bollywood mindset, you won't be surprised by the derivative plot, the sometimes broad humor, the prerequisite cheesiness, and the PG-13 sensibilities. Dhoom steals moments from THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, and even from THE MATRIX. And, because it's a Bollywood offering, it's got a smattering of musical numbers. The thing is, I'm actually recommending this movie. Yeah, it's hokey, and lacks in freshness, and certain scenes made me groan. And yet, overall, I enjoyed it.

Maybe it's because, before I even saw it, DHOOM had already garnered some good will from me by having as its lead star Abhishek Bachchan, my favorite actor in Indian cinema. Also a  part of DHOOM's allure is the undeniable eye candy provided by the two lovely ladies, Esha Deol & Rimi Sen (Ohh, Mama!), and the fact that I thought Bachchan and Uday Chopra had good buddy chemistry. The thumbs up vote could also be attritubed to John Abraham's cool, villainous turn as he proved himself to be a worthy nemesis for the supposed supercop Jai Dixit (Bachchan). DHOOM's got big, stylish action sequences. The stunts weren't really anything that we haven't seen before in American action movies. But they were still neat to look at and were done up with polish, particularly the climactic 15 minutes or so, which was quite a display of excess in vehicular stunts and a somewhat blatant plagiarism of THE MATRIX f/x. I got a chuckle out of the sequences wherein Bachchan and Abraham would, every now and then, execute a gaudy, slo-mo martial arts move and then degenerate to engaging in a vicious but pretty basic slapfest.

Plot breakdown and spoilers follow: Straight-laced, laconic, and super-dedicated Assistant Commissioner of Police Jai Dixit (Bachchan) is called in to catch a gang riding souped-up motorbikes who've pulled off several daring robberies, one of which was done right in front of the befuddled police. Jai Dixit, thinking outside the box, hits upon the idea of setting a crook to catch a crook. He latches onto breezy but crooked Ali (Uday Chopra), who is a whiz on a motorbike. Ali, you see, fixes motorbike races and also sells stolen bikes. Dixit and Ali immediately don't like each other (maybe because Ali was hitting on Dixit's beautiful wife Sweety - yes, her name's Sweety!), but the two persevere and eventually get a scent of the audacious biker gang. A television interview by Dixit incenses the gang's calculating, steely-eyed (and often shirtless) leader, Kabir Bhai (John Abraham), who makes a personal challenge to Dixit. He taunts Dixit and unveils to him the location of the next crime. What then follows is a cat and mouse game between the two, as they try to one-up each other. Soon, the clearly defined roles of the hunter and the hunted begin to blur.

The song numbers are actually pretty hot. Lots of PG-13 skin is shown by the sexy ladies, as both Esha Deol & Rimi Sen find occasions to get wet, thanks to a garden hose and the weather. ""Dilbara"" and the Latin-flavored ""Salaame"" were the ones I thought the catchiest; in fact, all the songs (even the first song ""Shikdum,"" which I didn't initially care for) were tuneful. Highlights in the Special Features section include an alternate ending (involving a day in the life of Inspector Ali), sexy Tata Young's ""Dhoom Dhoom"" video, and a ""Making Of"" featurette (23 minutes long and mostly in English).

Now, I'm not really a Bollywood connoisseur. DHOOM and the entertaining KHAKEE are the only two Bollywood action films I've seen. To be honest, I've viewed, almost exclusively, Bollywood movies with Aishwarya Rai in 'em. Aishwarya Rai is so beautiful she makes the two lovely girls in here look like spat-out prunes. Since I knew Aish is co-starring in DHOOM 2, I thought I'd check the original. I'm glad I did. At 123 minutes, DHOOM is shorter than the average Bollywood offering, but, to me, the shorter length just means that there are less opportunities for scenes rife with ridiculous coincidences thrown into the storyline. Which means, less moments where the viewer would burst out with an indignant outcry of ""Oh, c'mon!!"" As I've mentioned, the film is cheesy and goofy. But it does try so hard to be entertaining. So give it a chance before you start nitpicking it to bits. I rate DHOOM just a smidgen above three stars because I believe the positives outweigh the negatives. Enough people apparently agree. Else, there wouldn't be a sequel, right?",1161129600,6,4615,4.903969270166454

2158604,4,B000621P5Q,"This is the first of a series of movies called Dhoom. Although the other two movies are better, you cannot ignore this one. The actors are great. The story is good with just a few little flaws. Perhaps it was not the writing, but the execution. A few spots that were a bit too slow and easy for the audience to catch what was going on. The overall story is very good. The casting is excellent. SPOILER ALERT! The main annoying part was when the camera was trying build the action by switching from the motorcycle thieves and back to the squad car waiting at the red light. Then when the thieves were stealing the money from the truck, you could see just how close the squad car was to the scene (which supposedly they could not see). That is the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars. The movie is still worth watching and leads you to know the two main characters. The humor is a exaggerated and a bit silly unless you are into that kind of humor.  I think the writer or writers of the Dhoom series is awesome. Overall worth watching, worth buying.",1454803200,,1047,4.287878787878788

Once I discovered that there was a Blu-ray version, I did not hesitate to order it. While the picture quality is sharper than the DVD's, the Blu-ray inexplicably left out all the special features and bonus video included in the DVD version. I was hoping to replace the DVD with this Blu-ray but now I am obligated to retain both formats. Yash Raj Films has released a number of impressive Blu-rays so it was an unpleasant surprise to see that they came out with such a subpar version of Dhoom. I have no idea why they would leave out the special additional features that were included in the DVD format. If it was to cut costs, then it was a bad idea to do so. I hate it when these companies cheap out on the Blu-ray releases of older movies.

The movie itself gets top ratings but this Blu-ray does not.",1368835200,,1057,4.28

2158663,3,B000621P5Q,"'Dhoom' is a classic cops-and-robbers movie slicked-up for modern audiences and jam-packed with speed and flash. The action dazzles, but the characters drive the story.

Workaholic police detective Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) is after a motorcycle gang of robbers in Mumbai. Jai is so determined to rid the city of the bad guys that he neglects his eye-popping wife Sweety (Rimi Sen), who wears next to nothing while doing housework in order to get his attention. But her efforts are for naught--she ends up alone in her negligee when duty calls him away. The frustrated-housewife routine and ball-and-chain jokes may be old, but they're groaningly funny nonetheless.

Because the thieves are expert motorcyclists and their bikes are high-end, souped-up machines, Jai forces Ali (Uday Chopra), a mechanic who fences stolen bikes, to help him infiltrate the world of motorcycle aficionados. Jai also needs someone who can ride as well as the thieves and Ali is the perfect man for the job. Ali is a little shady, but he's basically a good guy who wouldn't hurt a fly--and he's desperately looking for love. Chopra makes his character likeable in a pitiable sort of way, playing up his vulnerability with a cloying eagerness to please women and a smile that's too expectant and wide. His romantic hopes are repeatedly dashed--until he meets a mystery woman named Sheena (Esha Deol). When it comes to police work, Ali's a reluctant sidekick, afraid of his own shadow, the perfect foil to the tough, determined, and unemotional Jai.

Kabir (John Abraham), the leader of the motorcycle gang, and his fellow thieves are thrill-seekers--they race and steal for the rush. Kabir knows their crime spree will eventually end with their capture or deaths--which he makes clear to his gang with the cool, creepy acceptance of someone who is crazily self-destructive. A true adrenaline junky, Kabir needs to take bigger and bigger risks in order to get keep getting the same high. The death of one of the gang members in the course of a robbery leads them all to a casino in Goa for Kabir's diciest gamble yet.

The film borrows from Hollywood films 'Point Break' (1991) and 'Thelma and Louise' (1991), and those are the weakest parts of the plot. The immediately recognizable rip-offs are shoehorned into an otherwise solidly crafted story.

The film's sequel, 'Dhoom 2,' was released in 2006.

2158667,5,B000621P5Q,"I basically agree with everything said by the guy who gave it one star. Yet, it was better than any of the James Bond movies, even with Sean Connery. I mean, do any of the stars in the non-Indian movies cited dance? What I love most about Indian movies are the costumes and the dancing. The best dancing scenes are usually not ones that use MTV style but this one had sheer energy. I like the dances that use older costumes and a mix of traditional (the original Chori Chori) and modern. There are more beautiful women and better dancers than those in Dhoom, but this one has chemistry. India has great serious movies with no dancing scenes and none of the cliches, but for entertainment value I loved this one. The male stars were better than any in American movies. And no one even mentioned the copy of Busby Berkeley dance numbers.",1186876800,,835,4.4640522875816995

2158669,1,B000621P5Q,"The wild mash of styles, the lavish musical numbers, the sentimental slop, the predictable plots - they're what make Bollywood movies unique.  I don't expect to be challenged or enlightened; I expect only to be amused for two to three hours.

Dhoom couldn't even do that.

The story of a policeman and a gang of motorcycle-riding bank robbers who work as pizza delivery men, the film is a transparent pastiche of elements taken from more popular films.  It borrows quite a lot from the 1998 French film Taxi, about a pizza delivery boy with great mechanical skills who builds a suped-up taxi, which he races through the streets of Marseille before being caught and forced by the police to help them chase a gang of bank robbers, much like the character of the bike mechanic in Dhoom.  The bank robbery scenes borrow from the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible series, and most of the fights are copied directly from The Matrix, including slow motion bullets and fisticuffs on top of a moving tractor trailer.  Appropriately enough for the cartoonish script, the lead actors have little to do but produce tough-guy glares, and the comic side-kick but to fall down, make funny faces, and take a few blows from the leads.  The music and dance numbers are unremarkable, although a remix of the title track played over the final titles did quite well in the Indian market and is perhaps the most memorable bit of music from this sad excuse of a movie.

Given that Dhoom is such an utter waste of time, talent, and money, it's probably not surprising that it was a huge hit with the Indian public and has now spawned an even bigger sequel, with promises of a third installment to be released in 2008.  This must be to the great delight of director Sanjay Gadhvi, who until Dhoom was a little known film-maker whose only noteworthy project was the 2002 release, Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai, a shameless copy of the 1997 Hollywood production, My Best Friend's Wedding.",1175990400,2,1951,4.697947214076247
