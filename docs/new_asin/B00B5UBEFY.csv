5559424,1,B00B5UBEFY,Very disappointing for an entertainer of his caliber.  The surround sound is terrible.  You can only listen to the mono sound.  Waste of money.  If you enjoy watching an entertainer make the audience sing-a-long you may think this is good.  Tired performance.,1366848000,,259,5.071428571428571
5559425,5,B00B5UBEFY,"For over 50 years Canadian Pauil Anka has been writing pop hits (for both himself and others) and performing. In the late 1960s (I saw him perform in a night club and remember what a tight and professional show he performed. He then became a Las Vegas staple.). Over the years he's honed his craft and, though, the hits aren't there for him anymore, he still puts on a great show and even had co-writer credit on Michael Jackson's last recording, ""This is it!"".

This Bluray contains a fairly recent performance, recorded in Basel Switzerland in 2011 and contains virtually every hit song Anka recorded(among the 24 songs performed during the 85 minute concert. (You also get to hear the songs he wrote for others - ""She's A Lady"" for Tom Jones and ""It Doesn't Matter Any More""). There are a few that he didn't write (but never says he didn't. ""New York, New York"" is Kander/Ebb, for instance, and was a hit for Frank Sinatra (as was Anka's ""My Way""). Speaking of Sinatra, Anka has a lot of the stage presence of Sinatra during his night club years. He loves his audience and encourages them to sing along and he roams into the audience quite often. (The curtain call at end runs nearly 4 minutes before the ending credits roll.
Anka still has the voice and he put together a good band to back him, with a large brass section. Og did I mention he does two songs on acoustic guitar? That's the first time I ever saw him play one.

The image quality and sound are sharp. There are no bonus features. Anka fans (especially those who don't have other DVds of the singer, will enjoy this. I did. For an interesting comparison of Anka now and ""then"" check out the short 26-minute National Film Board of Canada documentary ""Lonely Boy"" (1962) (it's on Youtube).

I hope this review was both informative and helpful.

5559426,5,B00B5UBEFY,This rating deserves 5 Stars because of its video and sound quality. My dislike is Paul Anka is pointing the mike too often to the audience to sing parts of his songs. He should sing most of it because it is his concert. I would recommend it to my friends and relatives.,1366848000,,270,4.211538461538462
5559427,5,B00B5UBEFY,I saw this show on PBS and was so happy to be able to obtain this for my own collection.  Paul Anka's performance is superb!,1366502400,,124,3.96
5559428,2,B00B5UBEFY,"I have other Anka DVDs that are done much better, I.e., did not like the all Anka band that played his music, but still love the entertainer and his music. Usually play my favorite artists over and over again, but this one is a one time play for me.",1366329600,3,249,4.1020408163265305

5559438,5,B00B5UBEFY,"I loved this.  I have been ""in love"" with Paul Anka for over 50 years.  He still sounds as good as the first time I saw him in 1961.  This DVD is NOT a disappointment.  This is well worth the money.",1419465600,,198,3.7560975609756095

5559443,5,B00B5UBEFY,Paul Anka is a wonderfully talented performer. Have been a fan since he started in show business. He was my teen idol. Great mix of music and non-stop entertainment. Have been to several of his concerts and never been disappointed.,1400198400,,231,4.8
5559444,5,B00B5UBEFY,"Enjoyed the concert DVD , similar to the live performance I saw in Australia recently but a lot shorter version, the live concert was excellent and DVD reminds me of the experience",1398384000,,180,4.65625
5559445,5,B00B5UBEFY,"top quality disc- excellent audio and video. have seen paul anka live twice. enjoyed every minute, he is a great personality",1377820800,,124,4.9523809523809526
5559446,5,B00B5UBEFY,PAUL ANKA IS A GREAT SINGER AND AN OUTANDING SHOWMAN. IT BROUGHT BACK GOOD MEMORIES. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD,1377734400,,118,4.666666666666667
5559447,5,B00B5UBEFY,"This film to me is wonderful. Paul Anka was a favorite of mine ever since I was in my teens.  His music and singing has always been the greatest.  He sings these old songs just like he did when he was growing up.  I love it and would recommend this
film and any of his music to everyone.

5559448,5,B00B5UBEFY,"I think Paul Anka is a great entertainer ,,,,and he still has  it .I love him I have most of his songs. I loved his show, its good when you can watch him as well as listen to him....I didn't want it to end.  Loved it and I recommend it.",1374019200,,236,3.7
5559449,4,B00B5UBEFY,"As a new fan, I thought I'd add this Blu-ray to my collection after liking Rock Swing(Montr&eacute;al Jazz DVD) so  much. As It turns out, I prefer the Rock Swing much more as it has the amazing ""duet"" with Sammy Davis and Live in Switzerland doesn't. I also don't care for the sing-along stuff so much. I can't say he has a great voice these days but he is a great entertainer and does a fun show.",1373846400,,398,4.1688311688311686
5559450,3,B00B5UBEFY,Paul tried too hard to get his audience to participate; the concert in Switzerland had an audience that was unfamiliar with his songs.  I decided NOT to keep this dvd.,1373673600,2,167,4.566666666666666
5559451,5,B00B5UBEFY,"Paul Anka seems to keep getting better with age.  His music and his interaction with his audiance is at it's best.
Hope he comes to the Philadephia area to perform.............",1373587200,,176,4.866666666666666
5559452,5,B00B5UBEFY,The human side on this performance by this great artist goes well beyond his artistic side and this is a lot if the artist is Paul Anka. His mini stories behind the songs introduce part of this human side the rest is himself.,1373414400,,225,4.255813953488372
5559453,3,B00B5UBEFY,"While he is a great performer on stage, the video of this concert was not one of his overall best.  We love his music and his personality on stage. If you love Paul Anka, you'll overlook that this wasn't his best performance.",1372809600,2,225,4.357142857142857
5559454,4,B00B5UBEFY,I was looking for Blu Ray concerts for my new home theater system and found this.  Paul is a pro and puts on a great show with lots of nostalgia hits.,1372118400,,150,3.838709677419355
5559455,3,B00B5UBEFY,"Its amazing Paul Anka is still singing and composing great songs even after this time. He's a terrific performer and composer. The video quality of this bluray is excellent but the audio is TERRIBLE indeed as others have said as though recorded by a camcorder like those amateur you-tube videos. It seems the band is distant, far far away from the singer and NOT with him. Even though it has a surround track, it might as well be mono. The entire musical orchestra is congested in the center speaker and not much anywhere else. Really amateurish audio recording indeed which really angers me for such a high quality singer to be pinned to this recording.

This is a performance I will unfortunately hear just once and not repeat, sadly for the terrible recording they made.

PS
Oh, btw did I mention the audio was terrible and also w/o surround information??? Sheesh! End of rant ...(sorry!)",1371340800,,891,4.741935483870968
5559456,5,B00B5UBEFY,I have always been a fan of paul anka. This is one of his great concerts. I love it! Superb performance!,1371254400,,104,4.0

5559458,4,B00B5UBEFY,"Good song selection.

Perhaps the audience in the concert is too mature to let themselves with the music, even with a lot of encouragement from the artist.",1369353600,,155,4.7407407407407405
5559459,5,B00B5UBEFY,"Excellent music. Excellent performer. His music has lasted for decades and I hope will last for many decades to come.
The band is of a superior quality with a good director.
Daniel Willy and Graham Lear are one of the best percussion players in the world.
My rate is 10 of 5.
Get it, you will enjoy it.",1369353600,,302,4.224137931034483
5559460,5,B00B5UBEFY,"Enjoyed seeing his interaction with the audience. I have seen him in person and his attitude, smiling etc. all is genuine.",1369008000,,122,4.857142857142857
5559461,5,B00B5UBEFY,"Another great DVD by Paul.  A must buy especially for those not fortunate enough to have ever seen him perform live.  After you watch the DVD, you will want to buy tickets to one of his concerts to get the full experience.  Paul gives over 100% while performing and the fans feel his energy.  There is nothing like a Paul Anka concert.  He is a multi-talented legend who has entertained worldwide for over 55 years.",1368748800,,415,4.48
5559462,4,B00B5UBEFY,"Have an earlier DVD of Paul Anka ""in concert"" made about 12-15 years ago that was almost the same program format (songs, jokes, banter) as Paul did in this more recent one in Switz.  The sound quality and liveliness of Paul (He as in his mid-late 50's I believe) could account for this......but the sound quality was tinny, weak, soft.....in comparison to the older and not even Blue Ray edition.  STILL, I always have loved Paul, his songs...his own that he sang and those written for others....as some of my favorite.  I guess I still would have bought it, but was somewhat of a disappointment.  Aloha from Hawaii!",1368489600,,616,4.675925925925926
5559463,5,B00B5UBEFY,"What can't you say about paul Anka, singer, songwriter, and entertainer 5 *****..

5559465,5,B00B5UBEFY,"I was kind of blown away by fact, you can see it, he's had no cosmetic surgery and yet is over 70 now and looks very good, voice strong, presents himself well and do know all he sings he wrote. I did so enjoy and bought another for one who remembered when he too was young and they were songs of the day, for many years.",1367712000,,320,3.8636363636363638

5559467,4,B00B5UBEFY,"This is an excellent concert.  He is one of the best entertainers I have ever seen.  Another one that keeps getting better with age.
If you are a Paul Anka fan you have to get this.  You won't be disappointed.",1367452800,,209,4.175
5559468,5,B00B5UBEFY,"How do you fit 50 years of song writing, performing, acting and singing into a 90 minute time slot? I have been lucky enough to see Paul Anka perform live 13 times, and his performances, his connection with his fans never cease to amaze me. This concert, taped before a Swiss audience in 2011 is, once again (as if we needed any more) proof that Anka is timeless. His style, his grace, his ability to adapt is second to none. The sheer amount of songs he has written for countless singers through the past 50 years is staggering. If you are expecting to see some has been crooner belting out some ancient tunes, you are in for some surprise. Paul Anka is just as fresh at 70 years old as he was at 19. The music is fantastic, his voice superb, the band outstanding and the set somehow manages to encompass a good chunk of his career. Up to date, modern and very tight, Anka and his band rip through songs old and new with a certainty of a hit Broadway play. Van Halen's ""Jump"" cuts with the precision of the finest knife, Michael Jackson's ""This is It"" sails like the wind and the acoustic set will leave you speechless. Paul hits the stage is like a hurricane blowing into town, taking everything in it's path with him. The audio is crystal clear, and the video looks like film, smooth and colorfulwith moody atmosphere. This is one concert DVD not to miss, You will find yourself playing it over and over. Mr. Anka, you never cease to amaze me. Wait, I already said that! Well, it's worth repeating!",1367193600,,1501,4.402877697841727
