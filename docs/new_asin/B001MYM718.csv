3704187,5,B001MYM718,"Admittedly, with a little initial hesitation I decided to watch the DVD and cut my three kids' hair. Could it really be this easy, I wondered? Well, once I actually watched the hair cutting chapters, my 'stage fright' faded. The step by step instructions were SO clear and SO easy. I've cut my three kids' hair on four different occasions, now. And, each time, friends complimented me on how cute their styles were! Trust me, this NEVER happened after I went to one of those kiddie shops. Friends were shocked that I had done it myself because the cuts appear so professional. A good friend even asked if I could cut her childrens' hair! I'm a busy working mom of three kids and really appreciate the time savings alone. Not to mention I don't miss shelling out $15 bucks per haircut, especially since they frequently disappointed me.",1235001600,,834,4.680272108843537
3704188,5,B001MYM718,"I am a full time mom and work full time, I feel like I never have time to go to the salon.  Needless to say I am getting old and the grey is starting to creep up on me... I used the videos hair dying techniques to dye my hair, it came out looking like I went straight to the salon, and the only cost was the hair dye from any store!!!! My husband now cuts his and our sons hair based on what he learned in the video (that alone saved us 50 a month).  I also cut my daughters bangs now when they are too long and they do not look like I butchered them :)  I love this product!!!  I am thinking of getting the nail video next.",1232323200,,624,3.7404580152671754
8322571,4,B001MYM718,"This is a haircutting DVD for people that aren't in the hair styling business, basic cuts and styles are taught.  I've given my toddler son all of his haircuts since watching this DVD and I only had to watch it once.  I'm an intuitive learner, I like to learn the basics and then add my own finished style.",1387843200,,306,4.258620689655173
8322572,3,B001MYM718,"VERY BASIC. ALL DEMOS WITH BEAUTIFULL BLONDE HAIRS, HARD TO REPEAT IN OTHER KIND OF HAIR. NOT USEFULL FOR ME. BUT NOT BAD AT ALL.",1362096000,,129,4.2
8322573,5,B001MYM718,"The video is professionally produced, clear video, excellent audio. I was impressed with the detailed,but uncomplicated instruction.

8322576,5,B001MYM718,"Although I am French and does not understand everything in english, this DVD allows me to cut my 12 years old son hair perfectly. He is very happy, because I can cut his hair with scissors, not too shortly and nobody knows this cut was made by his mom....",1300492800,,255,4.224489795918367
8322577,1,B001MYM718,"Not what I expected after reading the reviews. Very simplistic, one cut for bangs, one cut for straight long hair - cutting it at one length throughout. No guidelines on how to cut layers, or any more interesting styles.",1294185600,9,220,4.666666666666667
8322578,5,B001MYM718,"This is a great buy if you have never cut hair before and are looking to learn very basic steps. It is very clear and makes everything look so simple and easy. It gave me great confidence to cut my friend's and family's hair. Ever since I got this video the hair cuts I do actually look like a proffessional. It also gave me skills on how to style my own hair, whereas before I had no clue on how to correctly blow dry and curl my hair. Now it takes no time at all and it looks 10x's better then before.",1278460800,5,503,3.9411764705882355
8322579,5,B001MYM718,The easy to follow directions are fablulous!  I can now color my own hair like a pro.  What a great investment-at over $100 for a cut and color this pays for itself the first time you use it.  A must for anyone who wants to save time and money.,1244678400,2,244,3.938775510204082
8322580,5,B001MYM718,"GREAT PRODUCT! I absolutely love it.  It is so detailed yet easy to follow.  It didn't leave me guessing. I felt comfortable and confident after watching the video just once that I could cut my son's hair.  (It turned out GREAT, in fact much better then when I took him to the salon and paid a fortune!)  I was so impressed with the hair video that I just went and purchased the nail video.",1235865600,2,390,4.22972972972973
