At the end, friendship prevails and both characters mature in their life.  Andy Lau plays a 26 year old illegal biker who just gets his license back after being suspend for seven yrs.  David Wu plays his 25 year old unlikely best friend who eventually saves his relationship with his fiance played by 18 year old Gigi Leung.

The only complaint I have is that this is a bare-bones DVD.  The subtitles are burnt into the picture although you have both the Cantonese and Mandarin language options.  The trailer is also absent.  Recently, this movie has come out in Blu-Ray, however it's very expensive.  But still, it's worth every penny.",1402358400,,788,4.777777777777778

7880783,5,6305034427,"We rented this dvd and enjoyed it so much that we bought it. We've watched it several times over the years.  The available audio languages are Cantonese and Mandarin.  We used the English subtitles, since we don't speak any Chinese.  This is one of the best Chinese movies that we've seen.  We enjoyed the street racing, the plot, and the development of the relationships.  It's one of those rare movies that doesn't depend on violence and sex to keep the audience's attention.  This movie is not rated and it is certainly no more than a PG rating.",1069027200,2,548,4.597938144329897
7880784,5,6305034427,"Joe( Andy Lau),a motorcycle streetracer that races illegally all over Hong Kong. One night he meets young racer named David,and the two become friends. But things turn out that David is in Joe's dad's motorcycle team. See, Joe's mom died when he was young, and Him and his dad have what you might call not so good of a relationship.
And there's Joe's struggling girlfriend, Annie(Gigi Leung), she wants Joe to stop racing because she is afraid of Joe getting killed in a race.
One day, Joe races David and gets into a fatal accident, Joe re-thinks of what he is doing in life and becomes scared of bike. Annie is there for Joe, taking care of him and stuff. And when he finally gets out of the hospital, Annie wants him to promise her that he will never race again.......
this is one of Andy's finest, of course his dramatic weight and presence is not as much as Chow Yun Fat or Tony Leung, but he was almost there in this movie. The racing scenes were more than normal( think, it was made in 96.)But Gigi was kinda....ehhh how can i put this, i believe 96 was the time she was developing as an actress. however, overall a very good movie so check it out.
and Legend of SPeed starring Ekin Cheng, Kelly Lin, Cecilia Cheung is a *sequel* to this movie..see if you look at Legend of Speed opening, it says Full Throttle 2 in Chinese...",1026518400,5,1333,4.379032258064516
7880785,4,6305034427,"I'll say this right up front: ""Full Throttle"" is a damn good movie. The only thing is, if you're looking for a roadracing movie where the racing is primary and the plot is secondary, try ""Race for  Glory"" instead. ""Full Throttle"" is less about bikes and more  about relationships. Namely, the relationship between Joe, the street  racing king; Annie, Joe's long-suffering girlfriend; and new guy David, and  up-and-coming racer who befriends Joe.
The street-racing scenes are more  than decent, but where the movie shines is in the drama department. Andy  Lau (Joe) looks suitably tortured as he recovers from a debilitating crash,  attempts to reconcile with his father, and tries to stop sabotaging his  relationship with Annie.
Without the convincing dramatic elements, the  movie would not have held up, and while I would have preferred more racing,  I found ""Full Throttle"" to be a solid piece of work. You can't  ask for more than that.",959385600,3,942,5.012903225806451
