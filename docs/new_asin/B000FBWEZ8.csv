8120490,4,B000FBWEZ8,"Always an enjoyable movie to see, since this is the prequel to ""Five Shaolin Masters.""  It doesn't exactly follow the same continuity, though, but it does give you a good bit of background information on how the characters in Five Shaolin Masters came to be.

It's nice to see an all-star cast that worked exceptionally well together, as well as seeing some of the future Venoms getting started.

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because the audio quality isn't quite as good as the other Shaw Brothers' Kung Fu movies.  It's not horrible, but you can certainly notice lesser audio quality in this disc.",1421625600,,625,4.603603603603603
8120491,1,B000FBWEZ8,"This is a terrible piece of junk. If it is the Shaw Brothers you will never to able to tell from this print. All titles and final credits are missing. The movie doesn't even end. The final fight scene is cut off and replaced with a one shot screen that is clearly not original. The title on the disk ""FlyGuillotine2. Stay away from this dvd and the people who sell it.",1393804800,,368,4.197183098591549
8120492,3,B000FBWEZ8,my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.,1370822400,,170,3.8857142857142857
8120493,4,B000FBWEZ8,"I enjoyed it but, would have rather have it in Chinese with English Subtitles rather than in English. Great movie though. Brings back memories!",1347840000,,143,5.0
8120494,5,B000FBWEZ8,"I love this movie action from the beginning to the end.
I like the story too.
A true shaolin kung fu...
I wish they still do kung fu like this.
Must see............",1325289600,,164,4.15625
8120495,2,B000FBWEZ8,Well made but average 1976 Shaw Brothers Kung Fu flick. Production values are very good for the time and the movie features most of the major actors working for Shaw Brothers when it was made. The highlights are actor Fu Sheng fighting spinning wooden men in tight corridors and several fairly creative deaths.,1322092800,,310,4.867924528301887
8120496,4,B000FBWEZ8,"See all your martial artists in one film: Ti Lung, David Chiang, Alexander Fu Sheng, etc. Great action! See the training of crane, snake, dragon, tiger, and leopard techniques. Even the bad guys are good.",1313798400,,204,4.857142857142857
8120497,1,B000FBWEZ8,"I bought this movie thinking that it was the classic ""death chambers"" or otherwise called ""shaolin temple"" with alexander fu sheng and many others. I was mailed a copy of shaolin temple starring jet li when he was still really young. be careful if you buy this movie if you are expecting a shaw brothers classic.

i haven't watched the jet li movie yet but i'm still kinda mad at the fact that i just simply got something completely different then what i paid for",1232323200,5,463,4.447058823529412
8120498,3,B000FBWEZ8,"There are some excellent Martial Arts in this film. And for its time and day, its excellent. What I found in this movies is the scattered story's that all wound up joining together. I have to say that some of the Scenes are very graphic. The Actors seem'ed to really get into thier parts. And some of the blood and guts are pretty detail. Don't let children watch this one. However This is a must for any Shaw movie Fan! Get this one for sure.

As for the Region code thing, many people have American made DVDs what Red  Sun did was provide a way for Americans to enjoy these films without having to go out and buy a DVD. As the legal thing goes, I know nothing about that. I personally don't think they would take a chance like that.

This is a good movie and has a good cast of Actors / Martial Artist. I felt they really got into this film. Alexander Fu Sheng is very believable and also Chi Quan Chun. Man that guy is crazy! But Fu Sheng? He was a huge star in Hong Kong. He tragicly died at an early age of 29. This is a must and tribute.

Get this Shaw Classic.

8120499,1,B000FBWEZ8,"shame the dvd is a bootleg. The image has simply been stolen from the Hong Kong dvd, and not that well I might add. The film is owned by Dragon Dynasty in the US and should be coming out in the next year or so. If you have to see the film, get a region free dvd player for $40 and the world is your oyster!",1161561600,3,306,3.6515151515151514
