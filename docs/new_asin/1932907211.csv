203167,5,1932907211,"The film ""The Sacred Sites of the Dalai Lamas"" is the best film that I have ever seen on Tibet and their spiritual tradition.  I recommend it to anyone who has any interest in Tibet, Buddhism, spirituality and the power of sacred places.

I have been very involved with Tibetan Buddhism for over twenty years and with the Tibetan community in the U.S. since 1,000 Tibetans were allowed to come to the U.S. in the early 1990's to settle here and become citizens, and the film shows the warmth, charm and religious passion of the Tibetan people.

I have visited Tibet, Nepal, Mongolia and other Buddhist countries, and know that the knowledge, experience and perspective of your tour/pilgrimage leader is extremely important to the value of the experience.  Clearly Mr. Mullin is an exceptional leader and scholar.

The interviews with Mr. Mullin and the Buddhist monk from Bhutan who accompanied the group on the pilgrimage, were very informative - and I would recommend that viewers watch the interviews before seeing the film.

The film has inspired me to want to return to Tibet and see the sacred sites that I did not see on my first trip.  It also has inspired me to purchase books on Tibetan Buddhism and Buddhist art by Mr. Mullin.",1172102400,3,1237,4.752336448598131
203168,5,1932907211,"As a person who knew very little about Tibet, it was exciting and magical to plunge into this rich world and culture.

203169,4,1932907211,"I loved this movie and have watched it now 4 times.

Although I have seen many docs on Tibet and the Dali Lama, what stands out to me is the positive focus of this piece.  Although it's important to understand the history and politics of the struggle for a free Tibet, it was refreshing to see a doc that focuses on the beauty of the people, the music, the culture and the religion.

What a blessing to see these sacred sites that most people will never get to visit, let alone film!  I feel very lucky to have stumbled across this film.

It's a must see for anyone with an interest in Tibetan culture, in the Dali Lama, or in visiting Tibet.",1171238400,4,642,4.229508196721311
203170,4,1932907211,This is a good opportunity to take a trip to Tibet and see a few of the spiritual hot spots that we've heard and read about for years. It's a colorful and personal journey that made this foreign land more familiar. Good film.,1170979200,,225,4.255813953488372
203171,4,1932907211,"I highly recommend ""The Sacred Sites ...""  It is truly and inspirational journey that touches the heart and lets us inside the passions and commitments of some extraordinary people.  This film will change how you see Tibet and how you perceive those men and women who are dedicated to perservin a way of life that is being systematically destroyed.

You may never get to Tibet in your lifetime, but through this film you will share in an incredible journey that will stay with you forever.",1170979200,,489,4.729411764705882
203182,3,1932907211,"""The Sacred Sites of the Dalai Lamas: A Pilgrimage to The Oracle Lake"" is a 70 minute collection of home movies of a 2007 trip to Tibet dressed up as a feature documentary.  There is some wonderful footage of the Tibetan countryside and numerous sacred sites, including temples, mountains, caves, and lakes.  If you've never been to Tibet and know nothing about it, this film might serve as a good visual introduction to the culture and the landscape.  Discerning viewers are left to wonder if the project was simply a clever means for recovering the expenses of what looks to be a rather financially substantial pilgrimage.

The film is narrated in flat, almost dispassionate tones by Steve Dancz, an American music professor, who along with a group of what appears to be around 15 other middle-aged Americans is led across Tibet by American Buddhist teacher Glenn Mullin and Bhutanese religious scholar Khenpo Tashi.  Along the way Dancz relates the rather typical tourist reaction of wonder and surprise at being in Tibet, as well as reporting historical and contemporary spiritual claims of supernatural events.  Most anyone who has traveled in the region has had similar reactions, and who when visiting a place for only a few hours, or even a few moments, is going to risk insulting the locals by asking if they really believe that walking around a pile of rock reciting a mantra has the power to affect meteorological conditions?  Most of us just try to soak up the experience.

But if you are inclined to produce a commercial document of your visit, one that you want to share with the world, one that has the potential to inform and help people understand the relevance of your pilgrimage, it seems such a document is the appropriate occasion for questioning, for examining your experience, for evaluating the meaning of your journey. Perhaps for Dancz there was no need to question, in which case The Sacred Sites of the Dalai Lamas is an example of what you see is what you get.  I'd like to think there's more going on, that Dancz was on deadline to finish the film, that perhaps producer Michael Wiese forced him to excise the more interesting observations, and that a more introspective book or film may be forthcoming

For anyone who might be looking for a video document of Tibetan landscapes and scared sites, this is a film worth checking out.  For anyone hoping to learn about the Dalai Lamas, about Buddhism, about the meaning of pilgrimage, about the experience of ambition fulfilled, you would do better to look elsewhere.

203183,5,1932907211,"As a teacher of Buddhist meditation, I read the reviews of this DVD with great interest. Watching it, I felt it had been made with a real sense of reverence and respect for things Buddhist. No one made fun of anything and the reactions were all sincere. This is a great film for teaching classes on Buddhist sites and Buddhist art. One gets a real feeling of what it's like to be in Tibet, which is a stretch today, with the Chinese domination. I would highly recommend this DVD to any serious teacher of World Religions or of Buddhist meditation.",1223510400,,547,4.48
203184,5,1932907211,"This beautiful film bring us exquisite photos of the the mythic monasteries we read about and whose names are embedded in any study of Tibet or its religion. Thank goodness, not a travelogue, it captures, but lightly, the spirit of pilgrimage.
A Tibetan monk once told me you should always meditate for a time which is shorter than what you would like, leaving you wanting more. So it is with this film. We are left wanting more, and that is good.
There is a lovely, clear and thoughtful interview with Glenn Maullin who is both scholar and guide and, charmingly, old Tibetan hand.",1210032000,,581,4.650485436893204
203185,5,1932907211,"I'm not a follower of any organized religion, I'm a journeyman filmmaker and it is from that perspective that I truly enjoyed this film.

The great American director, Frank Capra was one of the first filmmakers to have his name above the title. Why? Because he believed in the concept of ""One Man, One Film."" He believed that the director was the man who was responsible.  I have seen no better example of that concept than at a recent screening of Michael Wiese's documentary feature, ""The Sacred Sites of the Dalai Lamas""

This is a documentary that harkens back to the 1960's work of Pennybaker and Wiesman, because Mr. Wiese has stripped away all of the fancy filmmakeing equipment and simply taken his digital camera to Tibet and observed. He observed its beauty, its simplicity, its sacred sites, many of its truely gifted ""holy men"" as well as the daily trials of the didicated deciples who went along on the journey.

This feature is so inspirational as a work of truely independent cinema that I believe it should be taught in every film school on the planet. This entire film is the work of basically three gifted men: the director / cinematographer / ediitor, Mr. Wiese, as well as two of his long time friends and associates who did the beautiful music and charming narration.

I recommend this film to anyone in the world who has a story to tell or who has the itch to make a movie. Watch this film and learn how to use the simplicity of a digital camera, available locations and abvilable light to make your own feature film.

Micheal Wiese has empowered you to do it...

Many of the deciples who went on this adventure to Tibet, claimed to have had ""a vision"" wile visiting one of the Sacred Sites. Mr. Wiese remarked that he was too busy shooting to take the time to have a vision...

I must humbly disagree with him. I believe that he difinately had a vision, a strong, clear and independent vision... and every bit of it is up there on the screen...

203186,5,1932907211,"What a lovely journey Sacred Places of the Dalai Lama gives us.

 I really liked that it was focused so closely on the experience itself, the particular monasteries, and the people associated with them. Not having it sullied by other ""modern"" things worked well to give we viewers more alignment with the internal experience the filmmakers and others must have all been having on such a pilgrimage.

One could almost feel the thin cold air, rusty metals, peeling paint and worndown woods. And I swear a few times I smelled sweet diesel fumes and dark wood smoke.

 All in all, it was an enjoyable and informative and intriguing journey film.

Whether you plan to go to Tibet and follow some of these paths, or are content to experience it second-hand, this movie will be both inspiring and informative about one of the remaining very special places on this planet.

Nicely done!",1206144000,,878,4.774834437086093
203187,5,1932907211,"This film is remarkable for two reasons. First, while I'm interested in Buddhism, I'm not a Buddhist, and have always found Tibetan Buddhism just too far out of my sphere of experience and knowledge to pursue in any depth. This film succeeded in making me want to learn more.

While the film chronicles a brief journey, it manages to evoke the long and fascinating history of Tibetan Buddhism, and becomes a very powerful testament to belief, dedication, and sacrifice.

This could also be said about the film itself. The journey to some of the highest places on earth is a saga in itself, yet the director and narrator seldom call attention to their own travails, except lightly and humorously.

As someone who's taught documentary and fiction film for four decades, I also have to comment on the remarkable achievement of the director in producing such a compelling and moving film on what appears to be a budget that most filmmakers -- documentary or fiction -- would consume in a single lunch. Using a single camera and onboard microphone that any layperson can probably buy here on Amazon, and working under what I assume was the ever-watchful censorship of government officials (several scenes were obviously shot surreptitiously), he managed to produce a thoroughly professional and fascinating film.

This film demonstrates what you can do with little money or resources if you have the passion and commitment, and if your movie is ABOUT something.

203188,4,1932907211,"Pilgrimage as Initiation: The Sacred Sites of the Dalai Lamas

Look at the true-life arc of development experienced by Steve Dancz, narrator of The Sacred Sites of the Dailai Lamas, a Michael Wiese documentary which  demonstrates the inestimable advantages of timeless pilgrimage over trendy tourism. For Dancz, an accomplished composer, traveling to Tibet was a long-held dream come true, with  its sonorous chanting, chiming bells, and bass-below-bass horns providing a veritable home-coming. When one of his Mentor-guides indicated a well-preserved, ages-old sea-spiral fossil in the same outdoor site where incense spiraled upward, earth and sky were wed. And when Dancz played a water-filled singing bowl in the Marketplace, it resonated with shimmering visual and aural fore-shadowing of the Lake itself. Beautiful.

The trials and physical demands of this group pilgrimage to the 16,000-ft.-plus Oracle Lake were brutal at times, the sort of purifying ordeals  typical of many Initiatory paths to wholeness. Soon after accessing the Lake, (after visiting a plethora of holy locales, any one worthy of pilgrimage) these altitude-challenged devotees were assaulted by a hailstorm. Fitting, since the I Ching's Hexagram # 29 speaks of the orienting, sustaining reliability of frozen waters: when they melt, you are  left with the solid mastery within despite the formlessness without.

Dancz may have intuited this, as he fared relatively well in the punishing climes, even receiving a vision: ""As the winds blew across the Lake, it created a shape like an hourglass, but with the sand flowing up rather than down ~ a reminder for me of the fallacy of time."" Timelessness, liminal space, an opening to the Eternal Zero Source.

For me, that image triggers something else of Indigenous value: the notion that prescribed, doctrinaire teachings need not be handed down from hierarchical institutions;  Revelation can also  rise up from Nature, to re-orient and inform. The Loa of Voudon rise up the ceremonial center-post (poteau mitan) from the waters, the dance of the Hula "" raises and spreads the Light."" This Earth-based reverence begins to bring a female balancing element to thousands of years of dominating patriarchal religions.

It is some measure of the Dalai Lamas' balance of yin and yang that they are able to read the depths of a Lake, even a yang-located mountain-high one. There is another I Ching Hexagram, # 31, that includes ""the Lake on top of the Mountain,"" meaning ""Reflection,"" but in this case, because of its heightened, liminal location, Reflection of the Divine. There is also a note of relative humility when the summit of a mountain is yin, carved out to contain water, rather than yang, jutting boldly upward into the sky. A site of such receptivity counsels ""opening the self to receive great teachings."" Indeed the case here.

While this film is composed such that the access to Oracle Lake is in every sense its high point, there is a sweet aftermath. Because Dancz has been our narrator, we've been invited to identify with him, from his early dream of Tibet to his sense of Spiritual home-coming.  Thus it is quietly thrilling to glimpse the delighted expression on his face during their descent when they visit the cave and chapel of the great poet, yogi, and musical composer, Milarepa. Late in his life, the much-beloved mystic promised that ""anyone who even hears his name, even once, will receive an instant blessing, and will not be reborn in a lesser state for the next seven life-times."" As a musician himself, of refined sensibilities and sacred inclination, this must have resonated deeply within Dancz ~ how wonderful",1201046400,2,3665,5.160202360876897
