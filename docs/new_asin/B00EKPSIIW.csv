5926546,5,B00EKPSIIW,"My children enjoyed this movie.
The music was similar to Indiana Jones, but more appropriate for this movie.  Lots of adventure and little children play all the roles!  Very funny too.
It is a very enjoyable movie to watch.",1327708800,,223,4.6923076923076925
5926547,5,B00EKPSIIW,"In my quest for quality, Godly family movies, I came across this one.  We watched it last night for the first time and we all loved it - powerful message, great acting, Indiana Jones-type music in the action scenes, adorable children (5 who play all the parts!), funny moments that our kids just loved... I highly recommend this movie!

If you're like us, the beginning didn't quite make sense until we got a bit further into the movie; then all the parts fall into place and you'll be happy you stuck with it!  Enjoy! :)",1327708800,,521,4.463157894736842
5926548,5,B00EKPSIIW,"My kids, ages 4 years to 8 years, my wife, and I watched this last night and absolutely loved it.  The novelty of having all of the parts done by the 5 kids aside, it was extremely well done.  I really can't say enough about it.  Very pleased, keep 'em coming!",1326585600,4,260,4.0588235294117645
5926549,5,B00EKPSIIW,"This FABULOUS movie was great for the whole family.  Beautiful message, scenery and acting!  A talented family with very professional production skills.  Keep it up!",1324080000,,165,5.52
5926550,5,B00EKPSIIW,"I am a 12-year-old boy, and I loved it. There is suspense, action, and even special effects. The wardens are always behind the prison escapee, and but for an inexperienced guide, they would surely capture her. The guide tells her of the City of Refuge, where the wardens are not allowed. But will they make it there before the wardens catch up to them? There is a slightly malfunctioning rocket car on call.",1311120000,5,407,4.589041095890411
5926551,5,B00EKPSIIW,"This movie was superb from start to finish. The children were all wonderful actors but more than that, the message of the film came shining through without the need for any obvious hints. The plot was subtle and the characters, though the children often played dual roles, were thoroughly individual. Very encouraging film, highly recommended for the whole family.",1309046400,8,364,5.186440677966102
5926552,5,B00EKPSIIW,"This is now hands down my favorite movie! I LOVE this movie; and I'm very critical of movies normally. It's got GREAT acting--those kids are just amazing! And oh, the cuteness!!!

The music, the set, the action, the humor--everything about this movie is spectacular. I can't remember the last time I wanted to watch a movie twice, but I will definitely be watching this one again and again. Did I mention that this movie is hilarious?

Everyone should have this movie, really.

P.S. Try and get the version with subtitles. There are one or two places where the kid-factor made it a bit difficult to understand what the actors were saying, but this was very rare and didn't take anything away from the movie.",1453593600,3,707,4.685483870967742
5926553,5,B00EKPSIIW,Great movie.  Well done! Engadging for all ages. The message is great. Don't have to worry about content when I let the kids watch this,1449014400,,135,4.4
5926554,4,B00EKPSIIW,"This was a truly remarkable work of love. Now if you buy this and expect to watch a masterpiece such as the Lord of the Rings, you will be sorely disappointed. But, if you view this film for what it is, a simple production involving less than a half dozen actors on a very tight budget with a story of redemption to tell, then you will enjoy this little piece of work for what it is. If you're picky and don't appreciate the simple small things in life, then you will probably not be that impressed.",1437955200,3,499,4.208333333333333
5926555,5,B00EKPSIIW,Kids love it,1428278400,,12,3.3333333333333335
5926556,5,B00EKPSIIW,This is a great family film that will tickle your funny bone while it delivers an important message.,1421884800,,100,4.611111111111111
5926557,5,B00EKPSIIW,Fabulous!  Very well done and so delightful to watch with the whole family!,1412380800,,75,4.769230769230769
5926558,4,B00EKPSIIW,"It was cute and well made.  Please note:  this is a child's movie in my opinion.  It was not geared enough for adults in my opinion.  The little actors were darling, though.",1411516800,,173,4.3125
5926559,5,B00EKPSIIW,We watched this movie at a friend's house and my kids had to have their own DVD to watch over and over and over again!!  The love it!!  We are able to really have good conversation around sin and our Savior Jesus Christ.,1404691200,,220,4.093023255813954
5926560,4,B00EKPSIIW,"Ok. My kids would likely give this 5 stars and for an I dependent , low budget film=amazing.
  If I had not read some background on the film storyline and also had the subtitles on to understand all that was verbalized , I may have been slightly lost.
  BUT well done . Great acting by the kids . Amazing set an special effects .
  Lovely cinematography .
My kids ages 2,5,7,9&11. All loved and laughed.
  I can't imagine any little ones not enjoying watching these other kids act this out.
  Great, clean family movie night film with a message that might go over the little ones heads for now, but could have lasting positive results .",1388016000,,636,4.405172413793103
5926561,5,B00EKPSIIW,"The first time I watched this film, I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a charming tale of sin/redemption, great filming, and the music score is awesome (if not a bit of a rip off from Indiana Jones / Star Wars).  I was very surprised indeed, the production crew has created a truly unique experience with this film.

It's also very decent for the whole family, no sex/profanity, the worst violence is seeing kids beat each other over the head with sticks at one point (of course the good guys win).",1381881600,,499,4.522222222222222
5926562,5,B00EKPSIIW,"The humor and cuteness of the child actors doesn't diminish the allegorical tale of the Runner, who is trying to get out of prison, and who has to decide whom to trust. Sometimes, help comes from the least likely places. This tale of redemption and salvation can also serve as a great discussion starter with your children.",1369785600,2,323,4.684210526315789
5926563,5,B00EKPSIIW,"If you're looking for an entertaining children's movie that will point your children to Christ, this is it!  I almost never give movies a five star rating, but this movie even edified and strengthened me.  It wouldn't be worth lowering my star-vote, but you may want to know that there is a scene where one boy punches another in the face.  I tell you this because my three-year-old son decided to do the same after he watched this movie.  It's better for older kids, maybe five and up.  Enjoy!",1360627200,,494,4.50561797752809
5926564,5,B00EKPSIIW,"This movie is entirely acted by kids from 2-9 years of age, and they do a superb job.  But the story is equally superb in concept and delivery.  It shows how relentlessly we are pursued by evil, how easily we give up and allow it to take us captive and how we ignore or resist the only way to peace and protection. The runner chooses to do it her way, trusting in herself more than the one sent to help her.  My granddaughter and I saw it on television and just had to have it to watch over and over and to share.  We know some adults who have not quite grasped the simple truth this film reiterates so plainly.  Even it you have grasped it, it's good to be reminded in such an entertaining way when life tries to get you down.  I recommend it for people of all ages.",1357689600,3,767,4.046357615894039
5926565,5,B00EKPSIIW,This movie was perfect for my young grandson. So nice to have an exciting story without ugly monsters or disturbing violence. It reminds me a little of the little rascals type of show with all kids as the main characters. Excellent!,1356652800,,232,4.682926829268292
5926566,5,B00EKPSIIW,"My kids have watched this movie over and over and seem to never tire of it!
Great kids movie....with lots of hidden lessons.
Love it.",1356393600,,133,4.36
5926567,5,B00EKPSIIW,"I ordered this movie to have on hand for the ""family"".  We have not watched it yet, but know it will NOT be a disappointment.  Am looking forward to the time we get to see it together.  Product was exactly as described and shipped really quick!!",1354838400,,245,4.282608695652174
5926568,5,B00EKPSIIW,"This is one of the best independent Christian films I've seen. I've got kids from 9 years and down and every one of them couldn't stop talking about the film for days afterwards. It has humor, drama, adventure and a heart-warming redemptive message.",1353628800,,249,4.813953488372093
5926569,5,B00EKPSIIW,"This is so well done, every adult (we shared with family friends) that viewed this agreed it was an excellent family movie!!! Action packed, excellent message, super cute actors!",1335052800,,178,5.172413793103448
5926570,5,B00EKPSIIW,Runners from Ravenshead was a very entertaining movie for our whole family!  We had 50 year olds down to 5 year olds and they all enjoyed it!  The kids in the movie are so natural and entertaining!  If you like the rascals you will enjoy this movie!,1332892800,,249,4.25531914893617
5926571,5,B00EKPSIIW,"The movie is delightful and highly entertaining.  It is thoroughly family friendly having no objectionable material.  In fact, it is a moral tail closely paralleling Pilgrims Progress, which has not suffered greatly in the retelling. The young people in the cast did an excellent job.  The cinematography is excellent.  Just a pleasurable experience in every respect.",1332806400,,367,5.5

8606428,5,B00EKPSIIW,"Such a cute movie. Lots of adventure. The all-children cast is priceless. I watched with captions to understand some phrases that were difficult to make out, but overall this one is a winner. I can't wait to watch the second film put out by Little Film Studios: The Defense of New Haven.",1508889600,,287,4.538461538461538
8606429,5,B00EKPSIIW,"The Runner from Ravenshead.
Is one of the best movies I've ever seen! It's not a cheeply made film. It has hart and humor! And the acting is outstanding!",1494028800,,153,4.310344827586207
8606430,5,B00EKPSIIW,"This is an outstanding Christian allegory! I recommend The Runner from Ravenshead to every family, church, and homeschooler. The kids that act in the movie do an excellent job. You'll be amazed at the wide range of characters the five kids were able to play. They did awesome! You and your kids will want to watch this over and over again. The Steege Family is extremely talented. You'll want to purchase the soundtrack cd too. The music is beautiful. When you purchase The Runner from Ravenshead, go ahead and get their second film, The Defense of New Haven... It will blow you away! Its phenomenal! An inspiring, touching masterpiece!",1491523200,,636,4.844036697247707
8606431,5,B00EKPSIIW,Our family loves this creative movie!,1490486400,,37,5.333333333333333
8606432,5,B00EKPSIIW,Love this film as well as the next one The defense of New Haven.  We laughed so hard.  The whole family from 4 to 40 loved them both.,1482537600,,133,3.7142857142857144
8606433,5,B00EKPSIIW,"With a unique all-kid cast (the oldest is 9; the youngest 2), this delightful movie won my heart and the hearts of my grandchildren six years ago. The Runner from Ravenshead tells the allegorical story of Sam, who has been sent to Ravenshead Prison. It is a dismal place, so when she finds a way to escape she takes it. The prison is guarded by wardens who keep constant watch for runaways and relentlessly go after them. Sam is no exception.
Enter the City of Refuge Guide Service. They are dedicated to directing poor souls to freedom in the City of Refuge, where the wardens cannot enter. Unfortunately, the guide service is understaffed and forced to send Henry, the day-dreaming, accident-prone Guide Service janitor, to lead Sam to this city. Through a series of narrow escapes, untiring Wardens, Henrys good-hearted bungles, and Sams desperation, there is never a dull moment as the runner, Sam, seeks to find freedom from the wardens in her life that are intent on keeping her imprisoned. Its a childrens allegory along the lines of Pilgrims Progress.
My eight grandkids of all ages adore this movie! The five child actors are gifted, and the visual effects (to make it look like many other characters are playing roles) and musical score give the movie a feel of the big screen. The movie climaxes with a mad chase involving a rocket car that zips along a zip line at fantastic speeds. (How did they do that?) Written, produced, and directed by Joel and Lisa Steege, the childrens parents, The Runner from Ravenshead is truly family affair. Two thumbs up!",1474761600,,1564,4.7749077490774905
8606434,5,B00EKPSIIW,A cute story with a great message.,1461801600,,34,4.0
8606435,5,B00EKPSIIW,"This is child acting at its finest -- the same boy under age ten portrays both the blundering hero and the undercover villain with a skill that can put some adults to shame.  A creative tale executed with a quality and seriousness that can almost make you forget that all the characters are little kids.  Excellent message, great score, and hilarious fun to watch!",1454889600,,364,4.671875
