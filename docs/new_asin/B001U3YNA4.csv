8549200,5,B001U3YNA4,"This is a 2-disk set, covering 8 different people from various walks of life as they come out to friends and relatives who mean a lot to them. The stories are told honestly and thoroughly. Very moving -- you can feel the anxieties of each person as they approach the coming out moment. I like the way the videos periodically display a quote that is about to be said by someone in the video. Very effective. Each ""story"" runs about 25 minutes. The picture and sound are high quality. We've shown several episodes at our high school's Gay Straight Alliance meetings and they sparked much discussion. I highly recommend this video.",1298073600,,628,4.666666666666667
