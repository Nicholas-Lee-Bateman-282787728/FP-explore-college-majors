8454986,5,B005355FT8,"This is Beany and Cecil Vol. 1. It is full of short goofiness. It was great when I was a kid, but know it's humor has aged, but even so it is a real classic cartoon series. The titles are:  SPOTS OFF A LEOPARD, INVASION OF EARTH BY ROBOTS, CECIL MEETS A SINGING DINOSOR, LITTLE ACE FROM OUTER SPACE, SUPER CECIL, & WILDMAN OF WILDSVILLE.
This is a rare tape of an almost lost cartoon series. It was extremely popular with all the kids in my elementary school.  It was a real hoot and fun to watch and a cartoon series that my parents could not understand.  That was worth watching for that reason alone. Now, these tapes are very hard to find. I have had this volume since I first discovered it in a big box store bin in 1992. I immediately grabbed it up along with another Beany & Cecil volume. I now wish I had purchased the other B&C volumes in that bin. Great fun and silly humor.",1423353600,,884,4.157894736842105
