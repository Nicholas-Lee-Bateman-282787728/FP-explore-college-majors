8279910,4,B001AVXOSS,"I bought this VHS in the mid 1980's when I had a sailboat that I used just about every weekend.  If someone that had never sailed before was going with me (which happened a lot), this tape was ""required watching"" for them and it served the purpose well!

If you are absolutely new to sailing, you may find this tape useful but if you are looking for a program with high-level sailing detail, this tape is not that.

Only negative is the VHS format but it was released when VHS and Beta was all there was.",1261008000,,504,4.229166666666667
