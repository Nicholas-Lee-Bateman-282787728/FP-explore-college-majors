8419529,5,B004A6G798,"I enjoyed this new Ripley adaptation very much, had waited for it for decades!
It's at least as good as the Matt Damon remake from ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" or ""Ripley's Game"" with John Malkovich.
However, the best Ripley adaptation til this day is definitely ""Purple Noon"" (Alain Delon, 1960) [...]
available on amazon.com. Give it a try!

Two of my favorite scenes from the novel are unfortunately missing in the movie: Derwatt in Salzburg, Austria, and Ripley being buried alive in the little grove. I wonder why director Roger Spottiswoode decided to skip those particularly thrilling scenes?

For Highsmith readers it might be a bad thing, but if you regard the movie as an oeuvre in it's own way and not expect to get each scene from the book, then you might enjoy the movie.

BTW in the novel ""Ripley Under Ground"", H&eacute;loise's parents are still alive, living somewhere in France and Belle Hombre is a small mansion, not a castle as huge as in the movie.

This is for sure a lot better than Wim Wenders' ""The American Friend"" with Bruno Ganz which was the most disappointing Highsmith adaptation for me.",1352073600,4,1115,4.761658031088083
