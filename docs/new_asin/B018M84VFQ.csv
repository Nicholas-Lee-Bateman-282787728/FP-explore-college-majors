8742628,4,B018M84VFQ,Close to five stars.....I purchased to fill an opera hole and would definitely watch this performance and opera again. Not shown much in the big houses but deserves a chance.,1516060800,,174,4.833333333333333
8742629,2,B018M84VFQ,"Let me be totally honest.  This is vintage Nielsen: superb sonority, particularly in its handling of choirs. Absolutely great singers.  So, what turned me off? The biblical source for the story and its unintended glorification of religious and nationalist fascism-- emphasized by the absurd  military costumes.  I found it both hollow and pompous.  I am glad I have heard it, but I am not keeping it.",1495929600,,400,5.0
8742630,5,B018M84VFQ,"The Nielsen Year in 2015 gave us a chance to see the great Danish composer in the round. The focus was naturally on the symphonies and concertos, which surely place Nielsen among the top 20th century composers. But new productions of his comic masterpiece Maskarade and his tragic Saul and David give us a chance to see experience Nielsen's greatness as an operatic composer as well.

Saul and David is in the sadly small subset of operas one can call dramatically coherent. Credit for this goes to the source material and the librettist Einar Christiansen, but equally to Carl Nielsen, whose music plays a major role in moving the story along, building its climaxes and giving us room to breath and reflect when the action flags. Robert Layton says Saul and David is ""...borne along effortlessly on the essentially symphonic current of Nielsen's musical thought."" Most importantly, Nielsen's music opens a window into the tortured soul of the protagonist, King Saul. The hero of this new DVD from Dacapo is conductor Michael Schonwandt, whose finger is always on the dramatic pulse of the work. He ensures that his players and singers (including the very important chorus) keep the musical pulse in sync with the drama.

I would most definitely call the production, by the English team of David Pountney (stage direction) and Robert Innes Hopkins (set and costume design), fascinating, but it's not perfect. To call it half-baked is an exaggeration. Though it maybe could have used a bit more time at 350 degrees/gas mark 3, there are lots of tasty bits here. In an update that pushes forward to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict there are plenty of opportunities for striking scenes and situations, especially since there is constant ambiguity about who's who in terms of Israelites and Philistines. If Nielsen's music reflects Saul's inner turmoil, the flickering TV sets in the bombed-out concrete high-rise apartments surrounding the stage that house the chorus show the effect the King's actions have on the outside world. His inner troubles and power struggle with Samuel/God have a terrible impact in the Real World, and the Media is there reporting it all. The mixed chorus makes more sense singing about martial affairs when women and men are dressed in battle-gear, with berets and AK-47s. Pountney's depiction of the prophet Samuel as a religious fundamentalist is a master-stroke, though I won't spoil the full extent and dramatic reveal, of this crucial change.

On the other hand, I found some design and direction decisions puzzling. The light show at the beginning of Act 4 seems superfluous to the great depiction of battle provided by Nielsen in his Prelude. The costumes and props were hit and miss. The bull sacrificed in Act 1 lacked something (glamour? maybe not glamour, but something), though the call-back of the hook in Act 4 is devastating. However, I loved everything about the Witch of Endor scene, including the bicycle. The ballet set-pieces (choreographed by Rebekka Lund) were lovely diversions, and helped David Pountney sell his concept, though maybe not in a completely organic way.

In terms of sound, this version of the opera is a definite advance over the Jascha Horenstein 1972 recording from 1972. It's a closer contest between the new recording and the Chandos one from 1990, conducted by Neeme Jarvi, which has great sound. Of course, the DTS 5.1 audio on the DVD is an advance, so I'm going to give the new disc top honours in this regard. As to the relative musical merits of the three recordings, it's instructive to note all three come from Danish orchestras. This is a demonstration of the odd disregard for the opera outside of Denmark. Surely this work would be a big hit in New York or London or Toronto, especially with the juicy acting/singing role of Saul. The available recordings have all been lucky with that part: Horenstein had Boris Christoff in his prime, Jarvi's Saul is the marvellous Aage Haugland, and here baritone Johan Reuter is really outstanding. The rest of the cast is very good as well, uniformly good as actors, and the chorus is excellent. Pountney makes good use of the chorus as actors, which is something that seems to happen routinely in today's best productions. Gone are the days, I guess, of standing in line up-stage, singing hard and looking awkward in a toga. In spite of Christoff in the Horenstein version, though, and fine singing and playing in the Jarvi version, I'm most impressed with Schonwandt's vision and follow-through in this excellent recording.",1464048000,,4545,4.992084432717678
8742631,4,B018M84VFQ,"Opera by Danish composer Carl Nielsen. Saul & David is Nielsen's first and only tragic opera. It is rarely staged outside Denmark, which makes this DVD quite rare, although older recordings may exist. The libretto is taken from the Bible's Book of Samuel. The main character of the opera is Saul King of Israel. His internal struggles and his emotions towards David are the most intense ones (similar to King Lehar), while other protagonists, Samuel, Michal, Jonathan and David, are not afforded much character development throughout the opera.
Even on its debut in 1902 the main criticism of this opera was its lack of romanticism. The music is more in the form of an Oratorio where the choir plays a very important role. Accordingly, the music for the choir is very elaborate and beautiful.  Which brings me to the staging: it is transposed to our present times, with clear references to the Israel-Palestine conflict.  If the music lacks some romantic touch, this staging accentuates it.  I don't find the time transposition makes sense, or is needed.  It certainly doesnt add anything and puts too much focus on the staging, drawing attention from the interesting music that should be the priority.
Acts 2 and 4 have substantial preludes. The one in Act 2 is festive and the director, David Poutney, staged a ballet referring to a United Nations meeting.  It is interesting, although somewhat distracting.  Act 4 opens with a stormy prelude, suggesting the war happening off stage.  The music is quite graphic, so the addition of actual war footage is not only not necessary, but highly disturbing and distracting.  Wasnt Nielsen good enough with his music?
The singers are very good, the music is interesting and beautiful - so, despite the staging, I would recommend purchase of this DVD.  There will not be too many to choose from for this opera.",1460592000,6,1853,4.932475884244373
