8292420,4,B001D9R316,"Contact seller before you purchase this item! Even though i bought this on E-bay, when i received it, this tape is factory labeled "" A Private Heaven"" but contains the songs from her previous tape release "" Telephone Long Distance Love Affair"" "" Machinery "" "" Ice out In The Rain "" And "" Morning Train ( 9 To 5 )

This Tape is supposed to have these tracks, Note: ( I got this box cover with the right label ""A Private Heaven ""and wrong songs! )

A Private heaven tape has these songs labeled in the back of the box.

1. STRUT

2. SUGAR WALLS

3. SWEAR

4. BACK IN THE CITY",1360627200,,573,4.0265486725663715
