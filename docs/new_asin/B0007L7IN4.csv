8047914,5,B0007L7IN4,"The ""Perry Mason"" novels were a form of mystery stories where the lawyer is a detective and the solution occurs in a courtroom. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers by mentioning new technology or medico-legal facts; they often warned of scams and swindles. A real life trial is not as dramatic as these stories. The prices date these stories, as do the vehicles. Gardner was a founder of ""The Court of Last Resort"" that worked to reverse unjust convictions. These TV stories are the simplified and condensed versions of the original novel; the stories and names of the characters could be changed. Some may criticize the tactics of Perry Mason but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The monetary figures from the 1950s are far out of date; multiply by ten (or more) for today's figures.
