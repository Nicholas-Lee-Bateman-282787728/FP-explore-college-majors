7296404,5,B00ZYW5N1U,"A very interesting film, especially for someone who grew up in the West. Since my hubby does not speak much German, he has to rely on subtitles. At times that becomes a problem when the background for the subtitles is too light.",1476316800,,228,4.4523809523809526
7296405,5,B00ZYW5N1U,"I caught this series on TV, and what a flood of memories!  I entered the Air Force in the mid-70s, and spent my entire career in the intelligence field.  Historically accurate!  The techniques, blackmail methods, everything!  I like the way the episodes are named after NATO exercises, several of which I was a participant.  I went over there a couple of times on temporary duty, and I also spent my last years in the service in Germany.  I enjoyed my time there.  And the soundtrack, as already noted by many, is vintage 80s.  If I could go back in time, it would be back to the 80s.  This series helps me do that just a little bit - it was a blast!",1472256000,,650,4.262295081967213

7296407,5,B00ZYW5N1U,"If you are a fan of the 1980s; then you will love this television series! It's spoken in the original German, with English subtitles. Basically, it follows a east German border patrol guard who is recruited by the east German secret service (the Stasi) to infiltrate west Germany during their Close cooperation with United States during Reagan's ""Star Wars"" missile defense shield.",1472083200,,381,5.161290322580645

And, this gives an excellent insight into the mind of the Russian Communists in today's world.",1470096000,,272,4.510204081632653
7296411,5,B00ZYW5N1U,"Yes, this series does live up to its hype by critics who fawned over this in the summer if 2015 when the Sundance Channel picked it up. Obviously it has English subtitles (some of which are hilariously wrong...more on that later) for this German TV series. It comes in at a short, sharp eight episodes so the pace it very good. You definitely won't get bored. I will say the first two episodes are mere setups because things go crazy off the rails in the next two episodes and away we go.

Also, this is probably the finest series to use songs of the era in EXACTLY the right moments to convey a tone. it also figures out that when visiting someone music is often on in a household so we get some Cure tunes at the commune in the background as well as having actual TV shows or new reports from the era on in homes or government offices. When our East German spy Moritz Stamm (played by the terrific Jonas Nay) first discovers a Walkman and on comes Duran Duran's ""Hungry Like The Wolf"" or when David Bowie's ""Modern Love"" plays as he makes his moves on a potential mark, it works so well. OK,  you will find things move way too fast as far as Linda professing love for Moritz after just a handful of dates, but just go with it.

The entire cast is terrific albeit the three (or four) main leads all seem super young. Bit of trivia you find out on the extras is that the actor Sylvester Groth who plays Stasi head Walter Schweppenstette actually was an East German who defected. Plus all scenes in Stasi HQ are shot in the actual Stasi HQ in Berlin. The series gets the look of East and West Germany in the early '80s down. The computers and phones are laughable looking when you compare them to today. There's a great joke about modern floppy disks.

Back to the subititles, not to give too much away but there is a scene where Martin (Moritz Stamm's real East German name) is used but what the East German speaking actually says to the other character is ""our son."" That's an example where the translation does not do the plot justice as it explains a lot of the whys and whatnots regarding Martin/Moritz's situation.

The extras are all great additions. They are all in English so you can rest those eyes following subtitles. One has interviews with the actors Jonas Nay, Ludwig Trepte (who plays Alex Edel, the disturbed son of General Edel) and Sonja Gerhardt (Annett, the East German girlfriend of Martin). Another is a sit down with the co-creators of the series, married couple Anna and Joerg Winger. They offer terrific insight into each of their backgrounds that help make the series what it is. The last is a 20+-minute Q&A at the Goethe Institut in New York after a showing of the first episode...and it's hosted by Grantland's Andy Greenwald (who I now know what he looks like after hearing his voice on the Grantland and now Ringer podcasts).

The other odd bit of trivia for all you about to become fans of the show is this US version features an intro track of the German artists Peter Schilling. German TV had a different intro song (New Order's ""Blue Monday""). Go to YouTube and check both out.

Lastly, great news: There's going to be a Deutschland 86 and 89 taking us all up to the fall of the Berlin Wall.",1468368000,2,3226,4.430016863406408

7296413,5,B00ZYW5N1U,"I first caught Deutschland 83 on television.  I watched a few episodes and somehow didn't see the rest.  I was captivated from the start.  First, this all takes place in a time from which I'm very familiar.  Second, I'm also extremely familiar with a lot of the NATO issues and exercises owing from 20 years in the US Navy.  Lastly, it is absolutely believable!

The acting in Deutschland 83 is better than many programs.  It ""FEELS"" real.  I also love that it isn't dubbed.  Something always seems wrong to me about dubbed programming.  No, I don't speak German well enough to understand it all, but I do know enough to catch important things.  Season 1 has DDR (East German) soldier Martin Rauch, nephew to a ranking DDR Intelligence Expert, infiltrate the West German (DBR) Army as Lt Moritz Stamm, an assistant to NATO BDR General Edel.

This is serious stuff.  It does have a few sideline issues, many which citizens of the United States would very little have a feel.  When the NATO forces speak of war, they are fearful of both imminent attack and their own soil.  We, citizens of the U.S., had not had the feeling since Pearl Harbor.  (Discluding the 9/11 attack which would be near 25 year in the future.)  This could be a very good Cold War history lesson the SHOULD be taught at the high school level.",1467417600,,1312,4.562231759656652

7296415,5,B00ZYW5N1U,Deutschland 83 is quite a thriller that brings into life the consequence of the Russians in East Germany. Many people forget how bad East Germany was with the Berlin wall. It all seems very tidy and normal now that there is one Germany. The Russian Winter is still there in Deutschland and the Russian Spies are still very active all over the world not just in Germany. I don 't think there will be a second series. It would be nice to see what happens when the wall comes down. That would make for quite a FEW STORIES!,1464652800,2,519,4.3061224489795915

7296417,5,B00ZYW5N1U,"A fascinating look at the cold war in the 1980s from the viewpoint of those (i.e. Germans both East and West) smack in the middle of things if cold became hot. Although it has very serious and challenging themes - and international military politics is not exactly an easy subject  - the exciting but realistic plot, fascinating characters, subtle acting and clever use of contemporary music. It also provided rare  insights into how Russia cleverly manipulated naive and gullible  intellectuals,  academics and students in the West into becoming de facto agents for the Russian military and spy network. Some of the crucial details are amusing yet significant e.g. the reliance of east german security on obtaining IBM computers to rreplace the their Russian duds, and their computer Geeks' need to conceal their enthusiasm, which was tantamount to admitting western technolofy was superior to Russian technology. Highly recommended.",1463529600,2,934,5.333333333333333

7296423,5,B00ZYW5N1U,"I love this show!!!  I lived in Germany from 1977-1983, so it's great to see Germany as it was at the time.  This show brings back memories of living right next to the Iron Curtain and the fear that was drilled into us on a daily basis.",1459209600,2,236,4.0
7296424,4,B00ZYW5N1U,"Beautifully designed and photographed series about the cold war in 1983, taking place in Germany.  A young border guard is recruited by the East German spy agency to impersonate and replace (the murdered) aide-de-camp of a West German general.  It brilliantly recounts the extraordinary moment, in 1983, when WWIII and a nuclear holocaust could have been triggered by the insanity of both eastern and western powers.

Wonderful acting and writing.  Jonas Nay is perfect as the naive young man who becomes the perfect spy.  Very realistic about the spying and dirty dealing between East and West.  Neither side ends up looking very good.  People are hurt and killed in the name of 'the greater good' -- a time-worn excuse to maintain power and ruthless authority.

This would have been a clear-cut five-star series if it weren't for the dreadful subtitles:  they are tiny and, being white, are impossible to read if the background is light.  Very surprising coming from Kino Lorber who have been experts in foreign films for over 60 years.  Standard procedure now is to have subtitles outlined, or in yellow, so they can be distinguished from the background at all times.  A terrible oversight as one cannot read more than about 60% of the subtitles.  Otherwise, a compelling and suspenseful series and first-rate in all departments.

If you have an all-region player, certainly get the UK version from Universal as the sub-titles are large, bright white, and outlined.  A clear winner and a full five stars for the British version.  Thumbs down, though, in the US to Kino Lorber.",1459036800,5,1579,4.969465648854962

7296430,5,B00ZYW5N1U,"Having grown up in the 80's, having experienced the fear of imminent nuclear war and the mistrust between the West and the East, and also having had the opportunity to visit and experience first-hand what things were like in the German Democratic Republic, I enjoy the current genre of productions such as,The Americans, Bridge of Spies, and Deutschland 83.

Deutschland 83 certainly doesn't disappoint and I love how it keeps me on the edge of my seat and the plot keeps shocking me.  As far as the DVD quality, there were maybr 3 or 4 momentary ""pauses"" during the series, but they immediately resumed and this technical issue did not adversely affect viewing pleasure.

Our hero has grown up in East Germany during the height of the Cold War, but he is no ideologue.

Now he finds himself as a well-placed spy in the NATO hierarchy.

While there are a lot of thrills, the most endearing thing about the series is that our hero has significant doubts about the motivations of his seniors and sometimes purposefully does not accomplish the mission for his dark masters.

Deutschland 83 is well written, well cast, well acted, energetic and fun. I wish the season had had more episodes but maybe there were budget limitations. Really hoping it will continue with the rumored '86 an '89 seasons to the Berlin Wall coming down.

There is absolutely zero degradation in the enjoyment factor from the show being presented in German.  What you get is 100% authenticity.

Granted, I'm a total sucker for East Germany/Stasi/country-in-a-bubble-and-on-the-brink tales.  I'm of the opinion that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lives-Of-Others/dp/B000XKZQ74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lives Of Others</a>&nbsp;is one of The Top Five Movies of All-Time.

But take that history and mix it together with Golden Age of Television alchemy from co-creators  Anna Winger & Jrg Winger? Magic.  The high point: Northern Wedding, the 4th episode.  You'll never see anything better.

There's so many good performances it seems ridiculous to list them all.  I'll just give one special shout-out to Sylvester Groth as Stasi manager Walter Schweppenstette.  Just so good.  There's one wordless scene that summed it up for me -- he's watching a show featuring this East German band of ersatz western rockers & does this small little jig in his office.  Just the brilliance to pull that off.  It conveyed so much about his character.

Plus, let's not forget about the soundtrack.  It's an absolute blast.  The team that curated it deserves an award alone for good taste.  And that starts with the selection of Peter Schilling's under-rated classic ""Major Tom (Coming Home)"" that is draped over crackling good opening credits that reek of 1983.  You'll want to breathe deep to gather it all in.  if you told me I could watch an hour of those credits on a loop, it'd pay to go see it.

What's next, Anna and Jrg?  The ending teed up -- in fact, almost demands -- a Season 2 (Deutschland 84?). I'll watch right now.",1446249600,2,2335,6.247648902821316

7296448,4,B00ZYW5N1U,"Deutschland 83 is an espionage TV series from Germany.  Martin (Jonas Nay) is a 24-year-old East German who is taken from a comfortable life in the military and, against his will, turned into a spy for the Stasi, the nations secret police. His assignment: he must assume another mans identity and become an aide to a West German general at the heart of NATOs nuclear-deterrance strategy. The show blends actual historical events with fiction. Ronald Reagan and other world leaders of the period are seen in video clips, issuing their blunt Cold War threats and warnings and serving as backdrop to the adventures of burgeoning spy Martin.

The show succeeds in capturing the paranoia of the 1980s when superpowers mistrusted each other and each played a game of one-upmanship from diplomatic posturing to the size of their nuclear arsenals. The personal story often feels forced, as when Martins aunt (Maria Schrader) pushes her nephew into the spy game, promising that his success will place his mother, who needs a kidney transplant, on a high place on the transplant waiting list. Theres also a so-so romantic subplot involving a girlfriend whom Martin is reluctant to leave.

What distinguishes the series is that Martin isn't immediately transformed into a Teutonic James Bond. Hes initially awkward at even the most basic of tasks. The writers also have fun showing Martin being baffled and amazed at the culture, luxuries and technologies of the West. For those who like good old-fashioned spy-vs.-spy intrigue, there is that, too, but it all has a refreshing look as channeled through the eyes of a novice agent learning on the job.

The DVD release contains 8 widescreen episodes on 3 discs. Bonus features include interviews and a Q & A with cast and creators. Episodes are in German, with English subtitles.",1445472000,19,1817,5.006622516556291

7296450,3,B00ZYW5N1U,"After seeing Generation War, an outstanding German miniseries that addressed WWII, I was eager to get D83, hoping for a similar treatment of Cold War Berlin.  As an American I wanted to experience a bit of history from a different POV, one that was demonized during my youth.  While D83 is not as good as GW, it does take viewers into the minds of E and W Germans during the 80s.  Of course, it is Americans who are demonized/parodied here and that is equally frustrating, but there is more good than bad in the series and it is worth some time and thought.  My major problem with the show was that it seemed eager to smooth out history, to help viewers gently forget certain intensities and ugly realities.  There is certainly tension in the episodes, but it is more sitcom cops and robbers tension than lurking Stasi tension.  Their treatment of the Stasi is at stark odds from what I have read about it and heard from survivors.  Perhaps it is part of a world wide trend toward revisionist history telling.  In Texas they recently put out a textbook that said Africans were brought to the American colonies as workers.  Describing slaves as workers is an obvious attempt to change the emotions that go with that historical period.  Are Germans now primed to see the Stasi as an overly meddlesome PTA group (Zersetzung-to-Fahrvergnugen)?  One of the leads escaped from E Germany during the 80s, so if he's ok with this kind of ""history-light"" . . .  Still, I felt they could have done better.",1444521600,6,1494,4.617424242424242

8721157,5,B00ZYW5N1U,"Not accurate as to specifics, of course, but, viewed overall a fair representation of the time period. The main character and his experiences are generally an amalgam of the real and imagined. In other words, it's a melodrama with occasional fantastical elements set in the context of the early 1980s in the two Germanys. Nicely photographed and acted. I enjoyed it very much.",1516406400,,376,4.984126984126984
8721158,2,B00ZYW5N1U,"Disappointingly insipid and implausible. Doesn't hold a candle, in terms of bleakness, menace, cynicism, to The Spy Who Came in From the Cold or The Lives of Others.

  The film also avoids easy or trite answers and endings. Top notch Cold War spy thriller with a touch darkness reminiscent  of Film Noir.",1496793600,2,359,4.3283582089552235
