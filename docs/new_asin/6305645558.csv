1054799,1,6305645558,"This movie only had 2 offical fight scenes! And there were some additional ""fight scenes"" where Lorenzo gets jumped, and one where he goes into this guys night club and beats up a few men. Not incredibly bad storyline, but almost no fighting! Lorenzo doesn't even do his jumping pump roundhouse (a move which he is most notable using in his TV show Renegade).  The movie came out one year before his show started, so I guess he was desperate for a role, so he didn't mind starring in this film.  Lorenzo plays Miles Keane, a night club owner and photographer. He payed off his loan to the guy who gave it to him by fighting for him. His employer wants him to fight again, he refuses, and then gets framed for murder. Lorenzo has to fight again to save his mom and his girlfriend. This movie only gets one star because Lorenzo Lamas is in it.",990316800,3,841,4.350318471337579

Hubby, son, and friend started watching this - and about every 15 min, they busted out laughing so hard they woke me up.  Needless to say, I wasn't a happy camper, but they sure had a good time.",1395100800,,290,3.9827586206896552
7892425,3,6305645558,"""Night of the Warrior"" is the first action vehicle for Lorenzo Lamas outside of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snake-Eater/dp/B00005MM6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snake Eater</a>&nbsp;franchise, as well as his first outing to focus on martial arts over general action. It has a pretty bad reputation, having received a very poor review in Black Belt Magazine and since then garnering little positive feedback on sites like this. Personally, I can see where its appeal is limited, but low expectations made this one easier for me to appreciate. In truth, the movie sways between a two- and a three-star rating and isn't worth a purchase, but if only because this is a good day, I'm going to go with the latter amount of stars and acknowledge that Lamas can definitely do worse.

The story: photographer by passion and fighter by necessity Miles Keane (Lamas) is violently extorted by a greedy loan shark (Anthony Geary, ""General Hospital"") to participate in a high-stakes brawl, therein putting his new girlfriend (Kathleen Kinmont,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-4-The-Return-of-Michael-Myers/dp/B000FA57UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers</a>) in danger as well.

The script is written by fellow action hero Thomas Ian Griffith (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Excessive-Force/dp/B0000AZT7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Excessive Force</a>), and I was surprised to find that there's a lot more to the screenplay than your typical fight film yarn. Griffith places emphasis on examining diverse relationships between the characters, so we get plenty of scenes devoted not only to Miles and his girlfriend, but also Miles and his mother (played by Lamas' own mom, Arlene Dahl), Miles and the best friend he inadvertently maimed while sparring (Richard Redlin), the loan shark and the Yakuza lord who's terrorizing him in turn (Danny Kamekona,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robot-Jox/dp/B000AM6ONU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robot Jox</a>), the former's bodyguard (Ken Foree,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>) and his drug-addicted love interest (Felicity Waterman)... Not all of these lead anywhere substantive and the writing could be a lot tighter, but as a result, many supporting characters end up better defined than one would expect. By the same token, Lamas' character may be a bit *over-developed*, to the point that exposition on him just wastes time.

The fight content is what Black Belt Magazine really got down on the movie for, but you know what? - I don't see where the big problem is. These aren't great fights and there definitely should be more of them, but they're far from dreadful. The gritty opening match between Lamas and Ray Sua (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Weapon/dp/B006A8XFUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Weapon</a>) shows a lot of potential, and both the wrestling match Lorenzo has with Richard Redlin and the showdown with stunt staple James Lew have high points as well as low ones. Personally, I think Lamas does better in this film than a bunch of more modern Van Damme vehicles. Beyond this, the movie remains a mixed bag: the production values are serviceable, but one thing I really, really dislike about is the soundtrack. Grating electronic noise and out-of-place jazz makes for occasionally uncomfortable listening.

With a couple more fights of the opener's quality and with less emphasis on the subplot of Lorenzo's character being a soulful urban photographer, this one would be a better movie, but as is, I still consider it a respectable entry into the martial arts subgenre of yesteryear. Don't buy it other than cheaply, but don't shy away if my description sounds like it could interest you.",1368921600,2,4041,6.2495511669658885
7892426,5,6305645558,GREAT DEAL THE PRICE WAS RIGHT AND THE MOVIE IS VERY GOOD. WHEN I SEEN IT I HAD TO GET IT,1360627200,,89,3.2857142857142856
7892427,5,6305645558,"This is a great movie!..Acting is pretty good and Kathleen Kinmont looks great in this

Get to see a side of Lorenzo not typically seen in all of his other movies..

A must see for any Lamas or Kinmont fan!",1258502400,4,206,4.125
7892428,2,6305645558,"I'm not a huge fan of Lorenzo Lamas, but I purchased this movie since it's focus is around illegal underground fighting.  That end up being a dissapointment since there were only two underground fights in the film.  There was little other action throughout, and the story treads along similar ground that other martial arts films use.  Overall, this was an ok film that ended up being a pretty boring watch.

For what there is, the acting could have been far worse.  Lamas doesn't do too bad a job, but he always seems too tiresome when he acts in his films, and its no different here.  Kathleen Kinmont is his love interest in the film, the same girl who seems to play his love ineterst in many of his other films such as Final Round and Final Impact.  James Lew (Timecop, Perfect Weapon, Showdown) makes a nice appearance as the fighter Miles Keane (Lamas) fights in the end, although the fight wasn't very inspiring and a bit slow paced.

This ends up being a pretty unexciting movie that doesn't give much.  For what it is, its ok and the highlight of creativity goes to some interesting musical choices, especially the tunes in the nightclub.  The fighting is sparse and weak and the story is nothing you haven't seen before.",1189468800,2,1230,4.60091743119266
