Galtar and the Golden Lance, another one of Hanna Barbera's action cartoon heroes. Along with Space Ghost,The Galaxy Trio, Johnny Quest,Dino Boy, Birdman,The Herculoids, Thundarr the Barbarian, etc. Thrilled legions of boys and girls every Saturday morning back in the 80's!",1457913600,,394,4.984848484848484

7504616,4,B017GEWDAC,"One of the last 'great cartoons' made by the Hanna/ Barbara group, an excellent example of why children used to love Saturday morning!",1448928000,4,134,4.869565217391305

7504619,5,B017GEWDAC,"This is a Hanna-Barbera classic that many might not know of.  On the East coast this show played on Sundays.  It was on The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera.  I still remember the theme song of It's Fun! Fun! Fun! Funtastic!""  It played with other cartoons as well.  One that stuck out was Fantastic Max.  Galtar was more of a Thundarr the Barbarian mixed in with Dungeons & Dragons and Sci Fi.  This was one of my favorite Sunday morning cartoons.  There are 21 episodes so I don't know why they put it on three discs.  7 episodes a disc.  The usual Archive MOD offering has ten episodes a disc.  They couldn't just add one more episode on one of the discs?  I already have this series on DVD.  They are burned from the Boomerang channel.  I found them on the net years ago.  It is excellent 480 quality.  I burned them on two Discs.  This set seems to be remastered (Im not sure) but they did NOT do the digital makeover.  Some scenes are blurry for a few seconds and other scenes are dark.  Be prepared for shaky camera scenes.  Its still better than my burned copy but I thought others should know what they are getting.  Im just happy it was released.  My favorite episodes are:  Shadowhaunt, The Master Fighters and the Silver Sword.",1447718400,16,1239,4.408888888888889

7504621,5,B017GEWDAC,best show ever......,1484611200,,20,6.0
7504622,4,B017GEWDAC,"This is an enjoyable watch, and probably one of the best action toons that Hanna Barbara put out - I don't really include Thundarr since that was Ruby-Spears. The voice actress for Goletta I believe to be the same voice actress who was Lady Jay in the G.I. Joe cartoon. The voice actor of Tormack (the villain ) is the same voice actor who was the villain Bloth in the Pirates of Dark Water cartoon (he has an excellent villain voice). The main drawback with these Hanna Barbara cartoon collections is that they are sold on DVD +R format - the only exceptions being the Space Ghost and Birdman series. That kind of irritates me, but I won't complain too loudly. This seems to have been Hanna Barbara's way of competing with He-Man. In some ways it is not as goofy as He-Man , no morals, no stupid Cringer or Orko, on the other hand He-Man had some better developed characters, including the villains. I have a few more Hanna action collections to get - Shazzan, Centurians, perhaps Gobots (maybe not). What we really need is a release of the original Fantastic Four cartoon (the one with the Human Torch and not the Robot that replaced him in the second series).  I am almost certain that that was a Hanna Barbara creation, with the sanction of Marvel, but the odds of that seem slim now that Disney has Marvel rights - they haven't even managed to release the final season of their own cartoon Gargoyles yet (which in my opinion is the best thing that Disney ever produced. Anyway buy Galtar if you are an 80's action cartoon buff.",1480636800,3,1532,4.491039426523297

7504629,4,B017GEWDAC,"Galtar is a beautifully animated cartoon fantasy genre series where Galtar and his female co star have to find a golden shield to thwart and conquer the plans of the evil Tyrant trying to rule the realm. There are lots of unique stories, though my main criticism would be that Galtar is often losing his most valuable possession, the Golden Lance, way too many times. It's almost expected that each episode he'll lose it and then need to recover it. That gives his character a sense of carelessness and a point against his efforts to dispel the evil of the realm. But one point is returned to his credibility because he usually accomplishes what he set out to do, even if it's with the help of his friends. Lots of monsters, magic, villainy, sidekicks, humor and outstanding, fluid animation for an animated series on 3 discs, 448 minutes.",1461196800,2,839,4.675675675675675
8739053,4,B017GEWDAC,"Amazing cartoon, and reminiscent of what cartoons should and can be about, instead of the more modern crap these days.",1526601600,,118,4.95
8739054,5,B017GEWDAC,"Great 80s cartoon show. Bought a copy for my DVD collection, but mostly to catch up no those missed Saturdays morning cartoon shows. Whether you missed your Sunday, weekdays or whatever days morning/afternoon cartoon show, this is a good  get your Galtar dvd before its gone. Packaging was good, mine arrived on time via Prime, no missing or damaged/scratched DVDs. Played well, no missing episodes or skipped parts (that I know of). If you like the 80s style cartoons and or collecting 80s cartoon shows, this is a great addition to your collection. Had to wait few months for price to go down before buying it. Comes with 3 discs.",1525737600,,632,4.745454545454545

8739057,5,B017GEWDAC,"Ordered along with some other Hanna Barbera series I had watched as a kid. Never saw before. If you like Space Ghost and etc, buy this as well.",1518480000,,143,4.142857142857143
8739058,5,B017GEWDAC,Awesome cartoon!!,1515542400,,17,8.0
8739059,4,B017GEWDAC,To be fair I'm not trying to be too down on this at all just maybe some nitpicks.  The series is good but as an adult a few things bothered me.  Galtar keeps loosing his magic weapon far to much and falling for the greedy scheming dwarves far too often.  It still has some good adventures but not quite the levels of He Man or Thundarr the Barbarian.  On the tech side using my PlayStation 2(I like to play stuff on an old crt) some of the episodes had glitches but were fine in my Samsung Blu Ray player.  Most of the MOD stuff I got before worked great in anything but it might just be my presnicty old game console.  Overall if you like fantasy adventures give this shot. You won't be disappointed.,1511654400,,701,4.1940298507462686
8739060,5,B017GEWDAC,"Absolutely love this series. Galtar came out in the height of the 80's cartoon popularity when Hanna Barbara reigned supreme. Great back story Chosen-one style hero, super capable heroine, evil villain bent on taking over the world, complete with henchmen cool animals and awesome sound effects. This is one of my all-time favorites.",1503964800,,333,5.30188679245283
