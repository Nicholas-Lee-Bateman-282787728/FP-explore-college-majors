3682919,1,B001LF35WS,"I bought this video interested with the premise of the DVD, a documentary on tracking the story of Mad Max through the actual locations where the movie was shot and people who were around when it was filmed.

THE VIDEO DOES NOT DELIVER AND THEREFORE I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT.

The DVD amounts to nothing more than a few guys riding around and cracking jokes. Very little information on the making of Mad Max and just when the plot became interesting the film-makers do not deliver the goods.

Go back to the drawing board guys and spend more time getting real interviews and footage.

The scenes involving burning rubber sucked!!

You also need to add a soundtrack to the video and add sound to the opening screen. Get a script and reshoot it.

Looked like a college classroom assignment gone wrong",1238371200,4,795,4.642857142857143
3682940,5,B001LF35WS,Although starting to date a little the time has never been more right to embrace this slice of V8 sub culture and collision with film making as Mad Max Fury Road prepares to assault. The film maker of welcome to Wherever You Are has a new post apocalyptic feature film releasing on June 26th of this year called The Rare Earth which is set in Australia 2039. #dustpunk,1429056000,,368,4.426470588235294

3682944,4,B001LF35WS,"I found this an interesting documentary study not so much of the Mad Max films but of southern Australian culture in general. For an amateurish production, I found it mostly well done. I would have liked more interviews with people involved in Mad Max films, and more time spent at the location of Mad Max 2/The Road Warrior. It was cool to see old cars from MM2. Australian hillbillies acting xenophobic was pretty interesting. For some reason I thought it would culminate at a Road Warrior festival in the desert, but it was more of drunken Australian male crash derby that was interesting and a bit disturbing in itself. The filmmakers had their hearts in the right place, and the two Interceptor replicas were cool, but the documentary was a bit all over the place at times. I did like how it begins and ends, tho. Overall, B. Worthwhile if you are interested in The Road Warrior film or southern Australian culture from the beaches to the cities to the bush.",1409270400,4,963,4.637426900584796
3682945,3,B001LF35WS,NOT REALLY MUCH ABOUT THE CAR Build. More of a silly young guys road trip movie. but kinda cool seeing all MAD MAX places.,1361145600,2,122,4.125
3682946,4,B001LF35WS,"I liked it enough to feel I wasn't ripped off.  The fellas with a mach-up of the last V-8 cruising about in Australia, searching for the original interceptor and seeing some of the landscapes from the movie.  Low tech hillbillies like me can relate. The cars being manually destoyed and burned by regular party types was pretty neat. I know from expierience that swinging a sledge or a steel pipe at a vehicle can be educational as well as therpeutic.",1326067200,,451,4.625
3682947,2,B001LF35WS,"yea so a couple guys got together to shoot a doc - that's ok enough if you understand what it takes to make a film (the editing, the lighting / time of day / shot angles) but the guys totally miss the mark of trying to make it fun for anybody else watching. I'm sure it was fun to make, but really, in total it was lame. The Bathurst scenes are pretty crazy because people are throwing Molotov cocktails back and forth at each other. They do interview a guy that has a real Interceptor, but they never pop the hood to show the supercharger. Indeed it works since they can barely speak over the whine, but still, besides those two parts, there's no other stars - hence my rating",1270339200,4,677,4.2153846153846155
3682948,5,B001LF35WS,"Thoroughly enjoyed this reality doco meets road movie hybrid!  The characters are dedicated Road Warrior fan boys on the trail of the fabled wreckage of the original Interceptor from Mad Max and the Road Warrior movies. Obviously spontaneous,taking the piss and unscripted it delivers continuous comedic moments as the boys run the gauntlet of dodgy outback locals, film nazis and one pissed off stripper. Loosing a bit of cred with the fake accents and hollywood hairdos, the film picks up the pace again as it culminates at the zenith of Mad Max and aussie road race culture on thunder road at Mt Panaorama with some of the wildest footage of the mountain at night.  A film for true believers.",1248480000,4,695,4.831932773109243
3682949,5,B001LF35WS,"This is a review in response to the review already posted. It is clear that the reviewer of that review missed the point of this movie. It never professed to be a bio on Mad Max. The description clearly states what the movie is about ""A band of Mad Max devotees build their own replica interceptor, drive it across the desert...etc"". There are several independant reviews on the web and the majority are very very favourable. ""This movie is best enjoyed with a few beers!"" ""You don't have to be a Mad Max fan but it helps!!!""  The destruction of various street vehicles at the films climax has to be seen to be believed. There is nothing else like it on film. If a ""reviewer"" who doesn't have a broad view of films, documentaries, reality based programs etc has an opinion then they should frame their response in a way that reflects the content at hand. Focusing on emotions such as anger offer very little to other potential viewers. It would be a shame if people passed on this for the wrong reasons. A reality based independant review can be found at:  [...]
The many positive feedback reviews of the movie on [...] are also testament.",1239580800,11,1139,4.524271844660194
8317932,2,B001LF35WS,"Not at all about mad max mythos. Very poor filming and very... strange. But it was ok. I liked the end only because of the crazy festival footage. Just know that the film is not what one might expect. Definitely not worth the price.
Came sooner than expected and packaged nice.",1515542400,,277,4.450980392156863

8317935,4,B001LF35WS,"I love learning tidbits on a movie's production and the people playing the parts and what the writer/producer envisioned as well as any other interesting factoids that may be thrown my way. So, this was a neat find for me!",1445040000,,222,4.575
8317936,5,B001LF35WS,"A fun and insightful look into then impact one film can have on ordinary people... if you consider these ordinary people, given the extreme lengths they go to in order to pay homage to their hero. A road trip with a difference, this is for true fans of Mad Max and those who can appreciate the stranger side of life. Plus the Bathurst footage is amazing - a time of sanctioned lawlessness that the world will never see again.",1439251200,,425,4.3924050632911396
8317937,1,B001LF35WS,"Very little to do with the mad max movies. Just further proof I suppose that just about anyone with a camera and  low enough scruples to accept funding from a supporter can make a film, well at least a documentary",1438732800,,213,4.325

8317939,1,B001LF35WS,"Really boring amateur film. Lots of footage of drunken idiots, not much content about Mad Max or the famous Interceptor. The car on the poster is insanely misleading, as you will only see it for a couple of minutes of the 84 minute run time. Save your money.",1431907200,3,258,4.395833333333333
8317940,1,B001LF35WS,"I just saw Max Max: Fury Road today, so I thought that this ""documentary"" might be fun. Sadly, this is pretty awful, and celebrates idiots revving the tires of their cars and setting fires and generally behaving like cretins. There is a film to be made about the subculture of Mad Max fans, but this isn't it.",1431648000,,309,4.43859649122807
