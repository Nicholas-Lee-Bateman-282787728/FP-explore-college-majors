8153529,5,B000JYW5DC,"Two great creepster films, Ghost Ship is a bone-chiiler about a seaward soul collector that lets nothing get in his way, well, almost. Dreamcatcher, actually one of Stephen King's better translations into film about butt birthed aliens. Don't eat berries in the woods~!",1238112000,,269,5.27906976744186
8153530,1,B000JYW5DC,"As the other reviewer said, neither one of these movies is all that bad (I quite enjoyed them both) but Warner Brothers has become a bunch of liars as of late.  The back of the box CLEARLY states these are WIDESCREEN and the movies are NOT widescreen at all.  They are presented in crappy full frame and had they been marked correctly on the packaging I would have saved my hard earned money.",1172707200,,392,4.3561643835616435
8153531,1,B000JYW5DC,"Both of these movies are good, however, I was very dissapointed that the back cover lists both in Widescreen when they are actually presented in full-screen.",1168732800,,157,5.076923076923077
8153532,4,B000JYW5DC,"Both of these movies are alot of fun.  They have some really good special effects.  Dreamcatcher is like the old monster movies of the fifties but a little more graphic.  Based on work by Stephen King this was a hoot to watch.  There are some plot holess and plot threads that never really develop, but this is not rocket science.

Ghost Ship is a little more formulaic but still fun to see.  It does use all the rules of horror films which make the action predictable.  Still it is fun.  Some really good effects especially in the opening sequence.

These are fun to watch so go ahead and get them.",1162944000,,599,4.372727272727273
