8277447,3,B001AHKGYC,"This isn't your typical giallo. Hundreds of giallos need to be released still by the way. Great flicks in which a killer stalks victims and usually you only see their arms as they do it. Films like 'the killer reserved nine seats' all those great flicks are being misplaced by shameless. Instead we do get this decent lenzi film about a young couple who plot with a woman to kill her husband. Lenzi made the great giallo 'eyeball' which is available on amazon.de entitled 'labrynth of the shrekens' and many other good films too.  This was decent but not great, it's a good b movie . The acting here is first rate which puts this one above other b movies somewhat. It's not a murder mystery as much as a erotic early 70's flick about a planned murder and betrayal. Will the older woman seduce the couple and use them? are they using her? Well you just have to watch it. I love Italian cinema so this was a good one for me , and this is a good erotic thriller.  Now shameless common and PLease get some real giallos out. there's hundreds of them out there that have never been on a dvd yet.",1312675200,,1089,4.307317073170732
