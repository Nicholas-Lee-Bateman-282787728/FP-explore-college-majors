7799643,3,159365054X,"Unfortunately, I don't understand Polish, and English subtitles were no help - half of dialogs was skipped, another half mistranslated. I will get a Russian dubbed version, as much as I hate dubbing...",1156032000,2,201,5.121212121212121
7799644,1,159365054X,"Waste of time and specially money (isn't cheap). Bad acting, dumb plot, ordinary costume (can do it yourself with some wigs and very fake beard and moustache) and the visual effects aren't that good. I gave it one star because of the concept of shuflandia.. maybe well design and better visuals could be very cool. But... do me a favor, don't even try to see it; you're gona be dissapointed cause i thought that polish actors were good... maybe they are, but in this movie they just flunked. If you wana see big and little people and lots of imagination see Gulliver's travels instead... WAAAAAYY BETTER!!",1155340800,,605,4.716981132075472
7799645,4,159365054X,"I must have seen this movie a hundred times in Poland, and I'm about to buy it so I can see it again!  What some people might not realize is that the conservative gnome society represents a comunist one, and the freedoms and pleasures of being a human represent the life beyond the ""iron curtain"", in the West.  The way in which tiny gnomes use human - sized objects really cracks me up.  Also, one of the main characters is played by Jerzy Stuhr - my favorite actor, who's also played in ""Sexmission"", another great movie by Juliusz Machulski.",990576000,,544,4.474747474747475
