8249002,4,B00133KFI0,A Perfect cast for a  Viennese operetta. I am old enough to remember the true viener spirit.,1459900800,,92,4.411764705882353
8249003,4,B00133KFI0,"Lovely operetta by Franz Lehar, excellent production staged in the open air",1425600000,,75,5.333333333333333
8249004,3,B00133KFI0,"I bought this DVD in October 2012. It played well when it was first received and I enjoyed it immensely. The singing was superb., particularly that of Lilian Sukis. However, when I tried to play the DVD recently, it stopped playing midway through it. Something wrong with the technical production? I am giving it 3 stars for that reason.",1404345600,,337,4.728813559322034
8249005,4,B00133KFI0,A felicitously crafted video of a nearly lost art form: the operetta.  Modern technology and sensibility used in the service of transporting the viewer back in time to a long-gone era and doing so with style and beauty.,1370390400,4,219,4.7631578947368425
8249006,5,B00133KFI0,"The venue at the Moerbisch Lake Festival site makes an ideal setting for this wonderful production of another of Franz Lehar's masterpieces, replete with lively dance sequences.",1354579200,,177,5.592592592592593
8249007,5,B00133KFI0,"This is my first review and I probably wouldn't have written this except that I've enjoyed this DVD so much and it has no other reviews. If you like Lehar and would like to see a production of the Count of Luxembourg, be sure to check this one out.

This is one of the series of operettas produced for German television in the 1970s.  The plot is changed somewhat from the Lehar original but is not as divergent as the Vienna Opera version with Bo Skovhaus.  Because it is not a stage production, the producers are able to use a wider variety of locations.

I found the first act a little slow going musically until the wedding scene between Angele and Rene.  From there, it's one gorgeous song after another.  I was particularly struck by Lilian Sukis as Angele.  To these eyes she is heartbreakingly beautiful - I have no difficulty in believing that Prince Basil is willing to go to such lengths to obtain noble status for her, so that he can marry her. She's not just a pretty face - she sings beautifully as well.  Unfortunately, this appears to be the only video of her available and she has relatively few audio recordings.  She and Eberhard Wachter convincingly play the leads.  The singing is excellent.  Erich Kunz, Helga Papoushcek and Peter Froehlich are good as Prinz Basil and the younger couple.",1342915200,13,1310,4.579399141630901
