This DVD is about when Baby makes his way to earth and starts taking over Goten, Gohan, and Vegeta's body as well while Goku, Trunks, and Pan were still in space looking for the Black Star Dragonballs. By the way, what's up with the young goku from the Dragonball series? Can he be able to be changed back to normal? Will baby finally be destroyed? Check out thwe other releases coming out next month: Ramifications and Preparation.",1055116800,2,578,4.514285714285714
