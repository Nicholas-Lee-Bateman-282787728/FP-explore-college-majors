5609297,4,B00BEMH2F4,low budget but interesting and thought provoking,1465948800,,48,6.0
5609298,1,B00BEMH2F4,The acting in this movie was terrible. Like a B rated movie. I could only watch the first 10 minutes.,1464048000,,101,4.1
5609299,4,B00BEMH2F4,"Remember The Outer Limits where questions of morality and changing times and ethos were questioned? This film delves into these subjects in a unique way. What is right and what is wrong? Does a massive technological shift herald a large societal revolution? If this happens, does the dilemma of moral boundaries need to be redefined?
What is life? What is the personality of a person? How far is it permissible to reach into the mind of a subject to force change? What are the ramifications of actually changing the thought processes of a person?
This is a well-made movie with a compelling story line that is gripping and sometimes intense, but always artfully filmed.",1430352000,5,669,4.87719298245614
5609300,4,B00BEMH2F4,"The movie left me thinking about the blurring of virtual life and reality.  As we continue to move further and further into the virtual world with the internet and beyond,  how far will it go in the future and how can we continue to hold onto our humanity with the changes in technology?  It is a small production studio, so doesn't have a huge studio budget behind it and no ""stars"" to speak of, but the story carried it through and provoked a lot of thought.",1362009600,10,460,4.325581395348837
8567268,2,B00BEMH2F4,"Such and interesting story, such a terrible delivery. It would have been good if there was a second or third reading that was used for the film, because using the first read of the script was a bad idea. All of my voice appliances could have been more convincing.",1510531200,,263,4.387755102040816
8567269,2,B00BEMH2F4,A promising story but the acting was really bad... REALLY BAD.,1497484800,,62,4.7272727272727275
8567270,1,B00BEMH2F4,Unwatchable.  This movie is a perfect candidate for Mystery Science Theater 3000.,1492128000,,81,5.75
8567271,3,B00BEMH2F4,It was good held my interest.,1485302400,,29,4.0
8567272,2,B00BEMH2F4,"The premise of the movie is interesting, but the acting is terrible.  The picture looks for a better word: ""foggy"".",1483833600,,115,4.75
8567273,2,B00BEMH2F4,"I started to give one star, but changed it to two after reading the comments of others. I guess that the concept is worthy of review, but this movie is horribly acted, and not well directed, in my opinion. The actors were so wooden and robotic in reciting their lines that it was embarrassing to watch.",1476316800,,302,4.410714285714286
8567274,2,B00BEMH2F4,"A slow story, but well worth the wait to see the incredible detective played by Mr. Froehner.",1472428800,,93,4.529411764705882
8567275,3,B00BEMH2F4,"I have to say this movie was strange, in that the plot and even the dialog was pretty good, but the acting was horrible...completely stiff and unbelievable, virtually every character. Funny seeing a movie about modern technology so badly acted and produced. But maybe it doesn't matter so much, because the point was good. I think in the end it shows that reality is not always what it seems...",1470700800,2,394,4.72463768115942
8567276,3,B00BEMH2F4,Good plot.  I wish I could say the same for the acting.,1468540800,3,55,3.5833333333333335
8567277,1,B00BEMH2F4,Usually I'm pretty forgiving for low budget or B rated movies but I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes. The plot might have been interesting but honestly I can act better and show more enthusiasm just by reading to the kids.  It seemed like it was their first time reciting lines.,1467158400,2,284,4.461538461538462
