It also allowed me to see a fault that was not fixable in a guitar that was still under warranty and was sent back to the builder, to be replaced . I recommend having a guitarist tool kit available when viewing this video so you can check clearances then and there.  The fender tool kit available from amazon is a good one. You will need a set of feeler gauges, capo and small ruler in 16th's at the least .  Anyone can learn a simple set up from this book.  The section on Floyd Rose tremolos is good.  If you are looking for a tremolo set up for a fender it is not on this video, but there are some good ones on youtube and this product will prepare you to understand those .",1393545600,,751,4.0134228187919465
