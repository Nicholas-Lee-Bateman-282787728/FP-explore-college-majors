Very expensive to have not work.  I bought for my class to finish a study on Elisha.  Disappointed when we went to watch it was defective.  Returned and afraid to order another.  :(",1416614400,,332,4.360655737704918

8137536,5,B000H8AGTK,"Nest Entertainment has produced some wonderful DVDS for Children's Bible Study. They are made extremely well, and are made true to God's Word. I purchased all the New Testament videos some time ago, but now I am replacing them with the DVDS, and adding some Old Testament stories as well. I have been really pleased with each and every one that I have watched.",1378080000,,360,4.640625
