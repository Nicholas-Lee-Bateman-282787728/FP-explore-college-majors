5367890,4,B009TR7A08,"Hi Friends,

I really loved this movie.  Clay Brothers. Turner Clay..More! More!
I watch every zombie movie that comes out and many are bad.
This is an intelligent movie that works at many different levels.
Our Actors, they can act!  The camera work--professional.
The screenplay worked.  Some movies, have the characters talking too
much and saying things like ""Ok, I am going around the corner now..""
Not this one.  It is different.  It has suspense out the wazoo and the
building of the suspense is great.  It is a horror in the true form.
It has some gore and some scare, but it makes you wonder what's behind
the door..The zombies are fresh from a release of nerve/biological agent
at a military lab.  Red eyes, not white, some runners. Does not have
hoards of zombies, but it makes up for it with the overall story.
No spoilers, but a fresh breeze in a zombie movie.  It isn't a cookie-cutter
film, with fantastic cover art and good story and awful film.
  Turner Clay is an awesome film maker and I hope this movie is
a big enough hit to allow him to share more of his talent with us.
The last zombie film that I enjoyed as well as this was ""The Dead""
by the Ford Brothers.  Some things in a zombie movie are going to
be similar, a zombie apocalypse, hero's struggling to survive,
anyone with a lot of money can make a bad zombie movie, but it takes
talent to make a good one with the many others out there!",1366070400,4,1414,4.375478927203065
5367891,4,B009TR7A08,"I have to confess:  when I first saw the DVD cover for this film, I thought it was going to be a comedy.  I'm not sure why, but the expression of the character on the cover gave me the impression that he was in a funny situation.  Thus, my expectations weren't very high when I started watching it.  But wow...I'm glad I did give it a chance; STATE OF EMERGENCY is a top-notch zombie flick that delivers on many levels.

I had never heard of STATE OF EMERGENCY before I got the press release, but I would wager that horror fans will definitely be hearing about this one soon.  While it does not really bring anything new to the table, it is a taut, thrilling survival story that will have you squirming in your seat and hiding your eyes.

One major aspect of this film that jumped out at me is the way it looks.  I saw in the closing credits that it was shot on a Red One camera, and you can certainly tell; the picture is crystal clear and the quality of the imagery is beautiful.  This clarity lets the audience see every blood-splattered detail of zombie head-shots as they occur.

Aside from the look, STATE OF EMERGENCY is shot well and the acting is great.  The production value seems high, which would fit since IMDB.com estimates the budget at $1.3 million.  Even so, that's still not much for a movie, and it appears the production team made excellent use of the money they had.

My sole complaint about this film is a very minor one; I don't like the fact that the zombie head-shots were computer generated.  Don't get me wrong...they are very well done, but they are still ""off"" enough to stand out.  The rest of the effects are practical, though, and look fantastic.

STATE OF EMERGENCY is a great zombie film, and it will definitely generate buzz in regard to slow-moving-zombies-versus-fast-ones (the creatures in this film run).  I highly recommend giving it a shot.  It not only looks good, but it's haunting and entertaining as well.  The film hits store shelves next week, so make a note.",1365465600,38,2006,4.49171270718232
5367892,2,B009TR7A08,"Zombies are attacking, and you're stuck in an abandoned farmhouse. You're without supplies; you've seen a loved one die. Does this sound familiar to you? Have you been transported back to 1968 in Night of the Living Dead? Nope, it's just another generic zombie film called State of Emergency, featuring the same old tired cliches with the red-eyed sprinting dead instead of walkers.

Directed and written by Turner Clay, State of Emergency looks and feels like every zombie movie you've seen before. We get lush but lonesome suburban environments, moments of solitude where our heroes seek shelter and keep a watchful eye on the zombies, and fast-paced enemies more akin to the rage infection of 28 Days Later than the kind from the Dead films that turns people into staggering slugs. The film takes much of its cues from modern day films, though: paranoia about the government runs rampant here, as well as more than a few references to the popular series The Walking Dead.

If you can't guess what happens in the movie, here's a little scoop - Jim (Jay Hayden) finds himself stranded in a farmhouse after a chemical outbreak turns people into angry dudes who've had too much espresso. With his girlfriend dead (car accident, the unnecessarily drawn-out flashback scene reveals), Jim fends off a couple of zombs himself before finding a friend in Scott (Scott Lilly), who's holed up in a warehouse with his wife and a really moody chick named Ix (Tori White). Enter zombies, enter shotguns, the fun starts here.

Except State of Emergency isn't fun, despite its easy premise. Zombie films are easy to create but difficult to succeed at crafting into something memorable, and that's exactly what Clay's movie suffers from. Since the film resembles its older genre mates so closely, there's nothing in this film to elevate it above the rest. In fact, it's almost counterproductive in that regard.

That's because the film tries for a more character-driven approach with its small population. Yet none of the characters seem real; the film spends a lot of time trying to develop Jim and Ix as friends, but neither of them feel like actual people. Ix is super bipolar, to the point where it's just not as much fun to root for her as it is to root against her. I'm not sure what Clay was going for here, but it works out about as well as using a garden hose to fill a swimming pool.

The characters also make poor decisions; for people who seem to do so well during the initial outbreak, the middle and end portions of the film force the people to make stupid mistakes in order to create tension. State of Emergency is never a tense movie; any suspense generated by loud thunderstorms or spooky dream flashbacks is dispelled by endless scenes of unnecessary dialogue meant to give details about characters we don't care about. Jim's backstory is pointless - we already know his girlfriend died, and just learning how it happened doesn't give us more insight into his grief, and it certainly doesn't affect the film moving forward. It's as though Clay realized that his movie was boring and decided to try to put some cliche in to try to liven things up.

But maybe if Clay had spent more time adding zombies to the film, State of Emergency would have been more fun to watch. There's only a handful of the creatures that we see, and they're fairly easy to dispatch; even then, the characters only make it look harder than it probably is. For a film with a name like State of Emergency, there's not a lot of urgency to its approach.

It's one thing to be generic, but to be generic and boring is unforgivable. State of Emergency is not the worst zombie movie ever, but it's tiresome enough to warrant a skip, even if it is on Netflix Instant. The characters aren't worth the time, and the happily-ever-after ending made me want to retch up the cereal I chomped through while trying to pay attention to the movie. I have more exciting bowel crises every day than State of Emergency.",1481241600,,3975,4.6944045911047345

5367897,2,B009TR7A08,"Ummm... this was just not very interesting.  There weren't many zombies in it and the human characters are pretty lame as well.  Speaking of the zombies, a few times when the characters are attacked by these zombies, the zombies don't really try to bite the people, the zombies just kind of tackle the people and sort of paw at them.  I thought that was kind of weird.

I will give the movie credit that the soldiers actually looked good in their gear and they actually looked like real soldiers.  Also the sets they shot the movie at looked pretty cool.  I liked how the barn and the warehouse looked.  They were these big cavernous buildings that kept you safe but at the same time they looked creepy as hell!  The zombies that were in the movie were not very good looking.  They looked like someone just smeared some mud and grit on the actors and then they were given the directions to just growl a lot.

It helps pass the time but it's nothing special.",1465171200,,957,4.417142857142857
5367898,5,B009TR7A08,"Note: Spoiler free.

""State of Emergency"" is not meant to be your typical zombie film nor your summer blockbuster. This movie does what most high budget films seem to have a problem with - taking time with your characters and your story so that they seem REAL, not just lifelike. But this isn't a soap opera neither. Dialogue does not crowd the film. There is no shaky cam and no cliched dialogue taking up space meant for simply watching the story unfold. It's more like life and less like a typical script. Don't expect the usual, normal action pact thrill fest. Just expect to be told a dramatic story that you didn't know before.

The zombies are shown in slightly different stages, but they don't crowd the screen. The shining light of this film is that it's a story about a man and the people he finds during the outbreak, not the outbreak itself like most other movies. The outbreak is simply the setting. This makes it feel more realistic as average citizens won't know such details as to the hows and whys of the dangers present. If we as the audience knew, we could not relate to the characters as well as we could, right? The zombies shine in a way reminiscent of the alien in Alien(1979) - always present somewhere, whether in your fear or literally. Subtle yet threatening. When they do show up in mass, it is not entirely expected because of the pacing, so don't expect predictable patterns in this movie either because there aren't any to find. This makes it better because you won't see the dangers beforehand.

Essentially, you will ruin your viewing experience by giving yourself any expectations because those expectations are fueled by the scripts and script patterns present in movie theaters. This story has a very classic film making formula within...but you won't see it if you don't leave the world behind when entering.

I love this movie and the film making process used. It feels very natural, not rushed and let's your imagination play a little with the film. Turner Clay, Jay Haden and the rest of their crew are telling us a story. We would sorely disappoint ourselves if we did not realize that fact.",1463616000,,2132,4.662234042553192
5367899,2,B009TR7A08,"This is really more of a 3 star because the acting was good, story ok, but the pace was really slow, and the cover photo deceptive. There might have been 6 zombies they fought in the entire movie never two at once. So figure it out. Not that action packed. There are a lot more zombies in the cover photo. I don't think two zombies were ever within 1000 yards of each other. It was basically a movie about people waiting.",1463443200,,421,4.209876543209877
5367900,2,B009TR7A08,"I think they really tried. It had a few tense moments here & there.

All in all it just dragged on too long. The acting wasn't great (granted there wasn't a lot to work with script wise). And, even though I am well aware of the fact that zombies are completely unrealistic, it would be nice if screen writers would do a bit of fact checking before using a plot device like diabetes. A diabetic would not be kept alive in an apocalypse with a stash of candy bars. PLEASE do a bit of research before giving a primary or secondary character a major illness/handicap. Also, anyone who unleashes attitude on a stranger for no apparent reason in an apocalypse situation should be fed to the zombies immediately. Try dialing it back a bit lady.

So many other gripes about this film/story line...

Not the worst zombie flick ever.",1457913600,,823,4.510067114093959
5367901,5,B009TR7A08,"I think State of Emergency proves I don't interpret zombie movies like most people do.  I have to STRONGLY disagree with any negative reviews for this movie.  I prefer zombie movies to be slow-paced and atmospheric instead of over the top and action-packed, and that's why I love State of Emergency so much.  Every single zombie appearance and encounter feels like it's important.  *This* is how you make a scary movie with zombies.  Of course in this day and age, with so many zombies films out there, I sort of have to make the distinction between the serious horror zombie films and the comical ones since both genres exist now.  I do like comedy zombie films don't get me wrong, but when they're frightening and presented like this one is, I favor the horror version of zombies.

This movie also proves that being low budget can be a benefit instead of a problem, because I feel confident that high production would have totally ruined this movie.  It's about a man played by Jay Hayden who's stuck in a warehouse alone.  We see him a nervous wreck preparing for a zombie to break in any moment with every odd sound he hears.  Really chilling and awesome suspense.  Then he gets a phone call from a man (Scott Lilly) who's in the warehouse across the field.  He invites Jay to stay with him and two other people (women played by Tori White and Kathryn Todd Norman) who can offer him food and protection.  He runs across the field and accepts.  Of course it's late at night while this happens adding to the suspense that a zombie might catch him by surprise.

Wow this movie is awesome seriously.  It's really chilling whenever Jay or Scott see zombies in the distance just standing in the field, and they watch them through their gun scopes preparing for a potential encounter.  The zombies don't seem to be very good looking at their surroundings and instead focus straight ahead which results in an interesting scene later when Jay has to escape for an emergency.  I also like how it was explained not all zombies are the same, as evident by the woman who knocked on the door late at night with a normal speaking voice asking with concern to come in.  Jay doesn't think she sounds right, so he shines the flashlight on her face and we see a red eyed zombie!  Awesome moment!

I like how the storyline progresses too.  We see flashbacks of Jay's past with his wife before the zombie outbreak occurred.  They were living peacefully in a nice suburban home until the sirens went off and the zombie infection changed everything.  The pace is really remarkable.  Proof that being low budget can be beneficial as I explain above.  I like how the characters are mostly solid and how it remains just the four of them the whole way through.  Tori's characters acts like a total you-know-what but eventually she comes around and becomes likeable, and Jay even risks running through fields to save her life in one scene.

I was expecting anger/friction to eventually develop between the four since being secluded inside a warehouse all day inevitably creates tension, especially when planes and helicopters pass over and Scott has a clueless moment and runs outside to wave his arms putting all four of them in great danger since several zombies are out there, but not really.

The ending's pretty good but for a moment I thought some kind of really big twist was coming.  It never happens though.  This is a bit of a SPOILER so don't read this next line- I thought the men who were rescuing the four could possibly be causing the outbreak and trying to turn them into zombies.  I thought for a moment Jay was trapped in a prison as part of some experiment.  Hey for a moment it looked that way!

This is how zombie horrors are supposed to be guys.  I know I know, people will disagree, but State of Emergency is a masterpiece in the zombie genre.",1456617600,,3842,4.583577712609971

5367903,5,B009TR7A08,"I really enjoyed this film.  The acting falters a little at times but it's a really excellent homage to the whole ""28"" franchise.  There are some wonderfully unnerving moments, the outbreak is portrayed so credibly.  The smart cinematography and score make it all hang together nicely.  If you love this genre you'll likely totally overlook the film's handful of faults because it does so much so right.",1456617600,,403,4.970149253731344
5367904,3,B009TR7A08,"To say this is a BAD movie would be unfair as I'm sure it is low budget. In fact, it HAS to be with the lack of time spent on actually making it a ZOMBIE film. I feel like more effort was gone into promoting the image than actually the film. Look at the cover and see tons of the undead reaching for our hero. In the movie, you are even lucky to get interaction with one zombie at a time. I believe there were 4 total zombies who actually did something the movie. One was within the first 20 minutes or so and after that, it was pretty barren of the undead. The beginning of the movie even lets on that a big encounter will happen from behind a closed door, and when you see it later on play out, it's hardly anything special at all as the door opens. Now, I don't usually complain about a ""lack of zombies"" but from what this movie seems to promote, it didn't have a whole lot to begin with. Spoilers ahead. The relationship to start off the movie has you not really caring a whole lot, but it dives in deeper as time goes on and you genuinely feel bad about what happened to his girlfriend. That feeling you may feel though is expected to be erased though when our hero meets a new girl and almost suddenly opens up to her. He almost starts to feel deeper than he should for her. This bugs me. The movie is an hour and a half, and not even an hour into the movie, he has already started a potential new love interest. I can't hate the movie as it did have some unique, interesting scenes, but there wasn't enough to give this a FOUR star review. I think 3 stars is even generous.
All in all, the first encounter with a zombie when the main character is alone, is intense and interesting, and the way some zombies TALK is unique, but I feel like there was too much nonsense and little to no action in between. The fact that I refer to the main character as ""our hero"" can't be good either, as I just watched the movie with no interruptions and I can't even remember his name. If you can get this movie for 5 dollars or less, I'd say it is worth it, but don't pay any more and expect a movie full of zombies.",1454284800,,2108,4.081927710843374
5367905,4,B009TR7A08,"Rarely have I seen a DVD box less representative of the movie it contains than this one. The movie is almost the opposite of this box. This picture shows a guy with a gun surrounded by zombies reaching out for him and a helicopter in the sky behind, inferring a big zombie action film. This is a disservice both to the zombie action flick fan who will likely hate this movie, and to the drama with a zombie apocalypse as a backdrop fan who would often avoid a cover like this. This movie is the latter.

It's a small-budget film, so you have to give it the usual leeway and not criticize it for failing big budget expectations in terms of cinematography, acting and effects. What they did here is create a good solution to the small budget problem by avoiding the mistake of trying to execute big budget ideas with no money. Instead they focus on four people who have taken shelter in a Kentucky tobacco warehouse during a zombie outbreak. And for the record, these are not zombies but ""Infected"" and the outbreak is local instead of global. Only two of the people know each other, and one of them says little. There are only 6 or 8 Infected in the entire film and they don't all attack at once, so again, don't expect anything like the picture.

The acting is reasonable and the main character, Jim, is well-played by Jay Hayden. This ends up being a surprisingly good suspense-type film which almost seems real. with its minimal cast and location. It actually seems to be just the way a few random people holing up in a building during an emergency would behave, confused and afraid and not always talkative. The pace is slow and the film has lots of closeups and looking out windows instead of action. Yet in its quiet way it does build tension. It's nothing great, but it is worth watching if you're in the mood for this kind of thing.

For the record there is another photo, the movie poster, that shows a closeup of Jim and a zombie face behind him against a dark background, which much better conveys the reality of this film. I highly recommend that Amazon use that picture here instead of the misleading one currently (Jan. 2016) being used. This picture seems to have been dreamed up to sell the film to zombie fans without any regard for honesty.",1453593600,,2257,4.48661800486618

5367919,3,B009TR7A08,"There really isn't a lot to this movie. There are four main characters in this movie and the rest are zombies. The military intervenes at the end of the movie and that is the only face time that those characters see. The main lead male actor is found at the beginning of the movie. He is hiding in a barn. His wife just dies. He gets a call from another building just down the hill. There the lead male actor meets up with two women and another guy. The other male actor almost acts GAY in this movie when he is talking to the male. He acts too serious or personal to the lead male, in my opinion. The delivery of his lines to that character seemed almost homoerotic. It was almost like that conversation could have lead to something else. That other male lead character wasn't nearly as nice or personal to his own wife in the film. It was just a little less of a guy relationship and more of a weird male relationship. The movie could have gone all ""Broke Back Mountain"" if it had wanted to. The movie even tries to make the lead male character into a hero when he goes to find insulin for the anti-social female. The anti-social female can't be bothered by this zombie apocalypse so she zones out and listens to music and acts like a jerk to the people who are protecting her. So of course the lead male starts to fall in love with that worthless character. And meanwhile the wife in the movie has a completely unmemorable role. She does little to nothing in the movie. She is simply the help mate to her somewhat gay acting husband.

The best parts of the movie were the far away shots of zombies who stood motionless in the distance. The old lady zombie who asks to be let into the barn was also memorable because she spoke and delivered her lines well. The fact that she spoke was due to the fact that the neurotoxins affected people in different ways. So I didn't find the speaking zombie groundbreaking.

Anyway, this isn't much of a movie but if you have some time to kill it might help to satisfy a zombie movie junkie. It is only slightly scary.",1415404800,,2056,4.310077519379845

5367928,3,B009TR7A08,"Well, it was cheap (I meant inexpensive, really).  But it was not the full-bore Zombie flick I was hoping it would be judging by the deceptive DVD cover art.  Nor was it even remotely like the synopsis printed on the back cover.  There was no ""roaming army of flesh-eating zombies.""  As for ""the small band of others,"" that our lone, so-called hero Jim (Jay Hayden) joins up with, just 3 people in an enormous factory.  They do not ""fortify their stronghold"" against the occasional zombie, they just sit there and yap and bond with one another.  Calling this isolated incident an ""undead apocalypse"" is stretching things mightily.  This is zombie-lite.  This is amateur theatrics in the same vein as a bunch of kids getting together to put on a show.  Sadly, somewhere along the line they forget to invite the zombies.

Yes, it is very stylish looking.  But the acting was marginal and the dialog hopelessly prosaic.  The FX was sparingly used to some effect.  Instead, they relied heavily on the overuse of sound, trying to make every footstep operatic in scope.  This is definitely the noisiest suspense thriller I've ever watched.

5367937,4,B009TR7A08,"I had first heard of Turner Clays State of Emergency a few years back and then it fell off the radar for me. No news on a release, no news on production, etc. Honestly I had forgotten about the film until recently we were asked about giving away a couple copies in a contact. Score! Not only was it back on but a slew of trailers and a review copy showed up on my doorstep. After a few years of waiting how did the film hold up?

Well this one isn't your typical zombie film. While the plot isn't too original the execution and focus on build up instead of gore and mass zombies was a nice change of pace. Most of the indie undead films that have been out as of late have been too fill of both so it was a nice change of pace.

The film opens with Jim (Jay Hayden) watching the madness of an outbreak that is the result of a chemical explosion that is decimating Montgomery County. As he finally decides to get the hell out of dodge hes pretty much ignored by the military whose attention he tried to get for help. Unsure of what to do and thinking he will be out on his own he conveniently is contacted by a group whose taken refuge in a nearby warehouse that is full of supplies.

There he meets with the group and he and Scott (Scott Lilly) become the two leads with the rest of the cast really feeling either weakly written or just there as the background. Im not saying that the acting was bad there just didn't feel to be a focus on the rest or that there was any real connection to be made with them. That being said Jim truly is a normal guy you can get behind and root for. Honestly from near the beginning I really wanted him to be able to survive the entire film.

So yes youll be expecting to want to see how this group of humans survives the infection, other humans and how they get along with one another. Its a good mix of drama, suspense, with a touch of horror mixed in.

As the area they are in is secluded you don't have to worry too much about the zombies in the film. Lets be realistic here were really talking about infected over undead. They are suffering from an infection that makes them very classic zombie feeling though aren't going to be coming back from beyond the grave. The lower budget probably showed up the most here as those that were infected looked to have been done in CGI for head shots in a way that didn't fit with the quality from the rest of the film. That complaint was in the minority though as the rest of the film though really did look great. Desolate location shoots, minimalistic scenes, I loved the visuals from the rest of the movie.

While this would fall into the indie category for zombie movies its one of the more enjoyable ones Ive seen in awhile. Its a character driven piece so don't expect hordes of the undead and gore being up in every scene. Its really more of a slow burn but one that fans of the genre who are looking for something with some build up should be able to get behind.",1392681600,,2947,4.179577464788732

The good:
-The infected, and the scenes with them, were very well done. One aspect I really enjoyed was that these zoms are smart. Not just doorknob-turning, I-know-he's-in-the-closet smart, but they're able to problem solve on a much higher level. This touch made it a far more dangerous situation for the survivors than if the zoms had just been mindless chomping machines.
-The explanation. The backstory is detailed enough to be plausible, but not a lot of time is wasted on it. I hate zombie movies or stories where no explanation for the outbreak is given, so I was glad to have one here.
-The acting/characters. In general, the acting was decent, save for one minor character who was too busy trying to play Holly Hostess during the crisis, though that's the writing, not the actress, I suppose. The characters' actions are mostly believable for the situation, nothing too far-fetched here.
The bad:
-Not enough zom action. While the parts with the infected were extremely well done, there weren't enough of them. There are also no big hordes of zoms as pictured on the cover and generally expected in this type of movie. The parts that had them were fantastic, there were just less scenes with zoms, and less zoms, than one might expect.
-Some things were a bit unrealistic. In one scene, a character takes down zom after zom with long range head shots, hitting his target every time. Without a backstory of some sort of history in shooting, this made his success in this scene highly unlikely as shown.
-One character is the stand-offish outsider, initially. We never learn her story or why she's so nasty to everyone- she just is. A good opportunity to show some more zom-scenes backstory was not utilized there.

5367950,2,B009TR7A08,"This review will contain some spoilers. I'll do my best to keep them to a minimum, but in order to properly review this ""zombie"" movie, there has to been some specifics.

First off, I wanted to watch this because I'm a huge fan of zombies and the 4th Season of ""the Walking Dead"" just had its mid-season finale and won't return until Feb 2014, so I thought this movie might hold me over until then. I have to admit, that I'm not really a fan of a fast and athletic zombie variety. I like the more traditional, ""Night of the Living Dead"" or more currently, ""The Walking Dead"" type of zombies. The zombies in this film are more like the zombies from ""28 Days/Weeks Later"". This trend of fast and athletic zombies seems to be the norm these days, so I'll let this one slide, although I REALLY wanted to see the traditional style zombies.

Ok, one of the major problems with this movie is that it is one of those movies that shows you the end of the movie at the beginning and then the rest of the movie is about all the events that led up to that moment. Well this really sucks for a zombie flick, because it GREATLY takes away from the drama. Think about it: if you see all of the characters at the beginning/end, and the entire movie is a flash-back leading up to that point, then what does that tell you about the characters? You already know you don't have to worry about any one of them, because no matter how dicey things seem to get, you know that they simply can't die! This was a huge mistake in my opinion.

Also, let's talk about the cover of the movie, it is highly deceptive. Based on the cover, you'd expect these to be undead zombies, but they aren't. These zombies seem more like regular humans that have lost their mind, and in fact, in one scene, one of these zombies is shown to be clearly speaking (yes, actually talking and carrying on a bit of a conversation!) to the main protagonist. Also, in another scene a ""zombie"" is shot in the leg and it seemed to clearly respond to the pain. I wouldn't even really call these things zombies in the traditional sense.

Another way that the cover is deceptive is that the main protagonist, Jim, is surrounded by a dozen or so undead zombies... well at no point in this movie do any of the character ever encounter more than one zombie at a time. Basically, this movie's main problem it feels very ""safe"". At no point are any of the characters really in trouble. And of the times when it may have seem like they could run into trouble, you already know they won't be, again, because this movie is a flash-back leading up to the events you see at the very beginning.

The only redeeming qualities of this movie is that thanks to the awesome cinematography and the decent acting, it doesn't necessarily feel like a low-budget film. But if you're wanting to get your zombie itch scratched, then you'd be better look elsewhere.",1386547200,11,2882,4.389513108614232
5367951,4,B009TR7A08,"STATE OF EMERGENCY

I am a big zombie movie fan especially the no to low budget kind so when I ran across this I had to pick it up right on the spot. This one looked great based on the DVD cover, which of course usually means a bad movie. So when I got back home I called up my brother [an even bigger zombie fan] and told him to come on over with the drinks. Once he arrived we started this flick up and..

The story follows a young man trying to survive in a small town that had a factory explode. In doing so the contents of said building turned everyone in the area into zombies. Stuck in the quarantined zone he must survive on his own or try to find other survives that are not infected. It just so happens that those people find him. The only problem is he has to make his way to them once they make themselves known.

This is a slow moving film that builds to its end showcasing its human characters more so than the zombies on the outside. I actually really liked that and thought the characters and the actors portraying them were interesting enough. There are some tense moments throughout the film but like I said this is mostly about the people and how they live with one another.

Writer/director Turner Clay did a good job here as the film plays out smoothly and that opening scene alone is excellent. I am looking forward to more films from him and will be looking into the one he made before this. This is a cool little flick over all with some behind the scenes stuff on the DVD. I would recommend checking this out if you are a zombie or horror fan.",1384992000,,1568,4.182119205298013

5367953,4,B009TR7A08,"State of Emergency (Clay Turner, 2011)

The best of the movies I watched this week was, surprisingly, not watched on Tuesday. (A glimpse into the life of Your Favorite Goat: I work from home every Tuesday, so for eight and a half blissful hours, when I am not on the phone with users, I am able to watch movies back to back, and I can usually get through four or five on any given Tuesday.) I was home alone on Wednesday night and on the verge of falling asleepI'd been awake all Tuesday night thanks to a medication change that brought on a severe bout of insomniaand so I did what I often do, trolled the bottom of my sorted-by-star-rating Netflix queue to find a crappy horror movie to which I could blissfully drift off until the family got home. I chanced on State of Emergency, pulled out the pillow, and prepared to pass out cold. Ten minutes later I was bolt upright, glued to the screen, and I realized that this was one of those wonderful times when the public had gotten it wrong, wrong, wrong, and I was seeing a minor, overlooked gem.

To be fair, I went into the movie with expectations even lower than that paragraph conveys; somehow I had gotten the Clay Brothers (Turner wrote and directed, while John Will produced; if you are truly unlucky, you may remember seeing John Will Turner in front of the camera in Hannah Montana: The Movie)  mixed up with the Cole brothers, Derek and Shane, who directed a godawful 2006 no-budget snoozefest called Human Behavior. So I was pretty much expecting Human Behavior with zombies. Oh, no. No, no, no. State of Emergency wears its horror-loving heart on its sleeve, drawing liberally from 28 Days Later..., The Crazies, Night of the Living Dead, and a handful of other horror films (and, as much as I hate to say it given how much I despised the movie, Cast Away), but they do it well enough, and with enough tender loving care, that I am more than comfortable calling this an homage, not a rip-off.

Plot: Jim (The House Bunny's Jay Hayden) is just about to propose to his girlfriend Emilie (Overnight's McKenna Jones) when the world ends. No, really. He doesn't have all that much in the way of details, but thanks to a TV station outside his area he can pick up with rabbit ears (talk about a Crazies throwback!), he discovers there was an explosion at a nearby chemical plant, and the military have quarantined the area. As we open, Jim is carrying Emilie through a field; she has been mortally wounded. We do not know how. (Minor spoiler alert/plothole: we never find out. Doubtful she was attacked by zombies, since we don't see one for a while. Flying shrapnel? He would have known about the explosion before finding a TV. And why didn't he just go home? Note that I cared about none of this while actually watching the movie.) She dies in his arms. Dead weight is heavy, so he finds a horse barnseemingly abandoned, but with working water, power, and phoneand goes about setting himself up a defensible position. (Which leads to the conclusion that, okay, she was attacked by a zombie. But... you know, one more script rewrite would have (a) solved all this and (b) kicked this movie's review up at least a half a star.) Jim finds an industrial barn in which to hole up; it's pretty defensible, but it's also large, which leads to the inevitable hey, there's a zombie or two hiding out in here. The phones are still working, and a small group of survivors holed up in a warehouse just over the hill gets in touch with Jim; he heads over there, meets them (there's husband and wife Scott [Fading of the Cries' Scott Lilly] and Julie [Kathryn Todd Norman in her first screen appearance], as well as Ix [Desert of Blood's Tori White, whom they found in a state of deep shock and brought back to the compound), and the bunch settle in for a siege with the hope, ubiquitous in zombie movies, that this is a local problem and the government will eventually drop in and rescue them.

It would be one hell of a spoiler to tell you one of my favorite things about this movie, since it's the final sequence, but as soon as that sequence started, I was waiting for the other shoe to drop...and eventually it dawned on me that the Bros. Clay were actually going to play that final sequence straight. I don't think I have ever seen that in a zombie movie before. Even if the rest of the movie had been barely competent, that last sequence would push this over the line into recommend territory. However, this is not barely competent; this is well-thought-out, paced like an art-cinema talk piece (which will probably not sit well with some horror fans, but those who have the patience for it will be amply rewarded), acted well enough for government work, and with a surprisingly satisfying resolution. I'm not a huge fan of one of the twists the story takes (there's an obvious romance subplot being set up between Jim and Ix that just doesn't ring true given that Jim's almost-fiancee has just died a few days previous), but that ends up being a minor complaint in an otherwise very pleasant surprise. Well worth the time if you stumble across it. *** ",1383696000,,5105,4.537459283387622

5367957,5,B009TR7A08,"As a long-time horror film addict, I am not easily impressed.  Trust me.  I grew up in the '60's and '70's on a regular dose of Twilight Zone, Thriller, Night Gallery, Dark Shadows, etc., and every horror/scifi movie I could find-- especially on Saturday night when scores of local stations ran the old classics, before ""Saturday Night Live"" came along and ruined this great American tradition, something I have never forgiven them for. I've been thrilled, chilled, and terrified in as many ways as a kid can be, and probably far more than most, but I loved it.  As an adult, I still love it.  The only problem is, at this point if I can find a horror movie that gives even so much as a small chill, it's worth its' weight in gold.  And if I can't get a decent chill or two, I at least want a decent story line.  ""State of Emergency"" delivered both.

Most zombie movies are so far over the top that-- aside from the notion of the dead being reanimated or viral infections going airborne and transforming people into insane flesh-eating machines-- they lose their credibility from the start.

The original Romero classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) was the one that set the standard, and the fact that the local militias and the authorities were getting things back under control by the end of the film was one of the most believable elements.  Granted, it is highly unlikely that so many zombies would be drawn to an abandoned farmhouse in the middle of the Pennsylvania countryside as was depicited, but that is forgivable considering this was the one that originated the zombie paradigm as we know it, and a lot of zombies were necessary to bring the plot to the high level of intensity it needed.

The sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978) carried the idea of the zombie rampage getting out of control a bit too far, but at least the idea that the reanimated dead might be drawn to a shopping mall due to the vague memories they might retain of its' allure was logical, explaining why such a crowd of zombies would gravitate there.

""Day of the Dead"" and ""Land of the Dead"", though great fun to watch and due their respect simply because they were Romero products, seem hard for this zombie film lover to swallow.  After all, these are dead bodies, ergo they are in a state of decay.  They are also incapable of reproducing, unless you consider infecting the living with bites so they eventually die and turn into zombies themselves a form of reproduction.  Even so, those folks, once dead, will also decay.  Within a short time, the zombies would basically self-destruct.  Thus, the idea that such a scenario (from the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", the dead being reanimated by space radiation from a satellite) would end up with a world overrun by the reanimated dead (who suddenly seem able to go on and on like Jason Voohres, regardless of decay) is quite a stretch, even for a zombie film.

That stretch is made even greater when one considers the reanimation of the dead taking place in a free society like the United States, where the majority of private citizens own firearms and know how to use them.  Sure, at the outset there are going to be a lot of victims taken by surprise because they aren't expecting a dead person to shuffle over and take a bite out of them.  But once the word got out, I doubt seriously that these shambling dead things would be much of a match for all the fire power they'd be facing.  (Europe and the United Kingdom would be a different story, of course, thanks to their gun control laws, but they're already sitting ducks for the next Hitler or Mussolini who comes along, so they'd may as well get it from zombies this time around.  You'd think after we Yanks had to save them in two world wars from their crazy notion that they don't need guns, they'd learn a lesson, but apparently not.  Maybe they deserve a zombie epidemic to frighten some common sense back into them.)

Of course, ""State of Emergency"" features not so much true zombies, but that variety that aren't really reanimated dead people, just people infected with some virus that allows them to avoid the effects of decay and move very, very fast (and presumably last longer as well).  Thankfully, as would be expected, firearms are equally as effective against this variety as they are against the earlier Romero variety, one just has to be quicker on the draw.

Going back to plot plausibility (again, overlooking the fact that this is a zombie movie, or at least something very similar), the fact that the zombies are sparse actually lends a lot to the story.  The film is set in Montgomery County, Kentucky and, not unlike the abandoned farmhouse in the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", the horse barn and warehouse featured in the movie are in fairly remote areas.  Even if the zombies (for lack of a better word) are able to sense or smell the living, and even if they are considerably smarter than their older counterparts, it's doubtful their senses could lead them across the miles to the four survivors.  Hence, the fact that we don't see that many adds a great deal to this productions' realism.  (Remember the old adage, sometimes less is more-- it works pretty well in this story line.)

The way the characters of the four survivors work together and deal with their personal issues while leaning on one another is both believable and reminiscent of the personal interactions of the characters in the original classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" on a smaller scale.  It helps us better relate to them, and successfully brings the quality of the film to a higher level, one above what is expected from the average ""B"" horror genre.

As for the fact that there were inconsistencies in the way the zombies acted (most just hissed and attacked, while the one lady came up and asked to be let in), keep in mind these are the ""infected"" variation, not the reanimated dead variation.  The chemicals could have easily affected them in different ways, especially considering the fact that the survivors were not affected at all, hence solving the ""are they smart or not?"" riddle I've seen posed in at least one review.

All in all, I have to say-- in my humble opinion, honed to a razors' edge on decades of horror movie viewing-- that ""State of Emergency"" is now in my Top Ten zombie film list (and the fact that it was shot in my own state admittedly adds to the personal appreciation, but doesn't alter my honest critique of the film).  I must disagree with many of the criticisms I've read in various reviews regarding this movie.  It is not ""the same old thing"", nor is it so much ""slow-moving"" as it is balanced.  The characters are all good, and the actors who portray them do so very well.  And, in the end, another thing I really liked about this one (which is definitely refreshingly different than most all zombie-genre films before it) is that the four main protagonists survive.

""State of Emergency"" is well worth the time and the cost of the DVD, especially to the more evolved zombie film connoisseurs who prefer a more realisitc, personal approach to over-the-top hordes of biting, thrashing flesh-eaters ripping mindlessly through the set by the hundreds-- even if the set is supposed to be in rural America.",1380758400,,7248,4.6328125

5367959,4,B009TR7A08,"This is a good creepy movie, with some believable concepts. The zombies are victims of a chemical leak, and they can be killed without being shot in the head. They are not walking dead people, they are poisoned people. That concept is much more believable than the dead getting up and craving human flesh. The poisoned people attack normal people, and possibly each other. There are not hordes of them trying to get in, only one at a time, and you still get that creepy feeling of something outside watching you. Sometimes a representation of reality can be much scarier than fiction. Why does the title cover show hordes? Gets more attention I guess.",1376956800,,651,4.719298245614035

quite fierce--the old days of zombies skulking around in slow motion are pretty much
over. Now they run, although some of them just stand there. The film is low budget,
but expertly delineated. My problem lies with the protagonist, who is one of those
taciturn chaps who seldom does anything promptly even when danger demands it. He's
too pensive for a man against the zombie world. Even when he is suddenly confronted
by soldiers who could shoot him in an instant, when one of them says, ""Talk!""
(to prove you're not one of Them), he just stands there. I find this maddening. But
it is interestingly offbeat for a zombie flick.",1376352000,,796,4.612676056338028

He takes shelter first in a barn, then in a warehouse with three other people. I really loved how it played up the suspense and fear of not knowing what the heck was going on in the world. Others have criticized the film for not being gory enough, but i didn't mind that.

But - the acting is quite decent, the zombies are unusual (you're really never sure what to expect), and when you THINK you know where the plot is going, it takes another turn.  I don't want to give spoilers, so suffice to say the group of survivors holed up in the warehouse are NOT the usual ""one's a former SEAL, one's a coward, one's a screamer, one's secretly hiding a bite"" medley.

5367963,3,B009TR7A08,"What's interesting about this movie is how far computer generated effects have come even over the last five years. Even a very low budget c movie can now have some decent effects, with cgi helicopters flying around and realistic big explosions. These would have looked really fake just five years ago at this budget and 10 years ago even a higher b movie would have looked like this.  If this were made in the 1980's it would have had little models flying around. Which is fine for back then. Still, sometimes even a low budgeter like this should build some real heads and blow them up, that looks better than most cgi. This is a first timers film, and it's not too bad in that regard, many first timer flicks are much worse and have no idea what they are doing. This at least had some finesse to it and that's a good thing. The acting is good for first timers too. It is a rather slow flick but that is ok as it's a solid story here. A chemical plant has blown up making some people insane and rabid. This is a retold story that has been done many times since ""the crazies' first came out in 1972. But this is ok. the picture is in HD and that helps a lot. I am getting to where I won't stream most shows unless they are in hd. Unless it's a older flick or show like x files.

5367965,3,B009TR7A08,"I watched STATE OF EMERGENCY for free on my gaming console last night; until it popped up as a ""free rental"" I had never heard of the film. I watched the trailer and thought, since I love the zombie/infected ghoul genre, that I'd give it a go. I went in with mediocre expectations and was not let down but, on some levels, the film exceeded my expectations. For a low-budget ""zombie"" movie, it is okay. It's not great but not bad. However, if you are going into it looking for an action-packed gore-fest then you will be disappointed.

The film-makers focus more on character development, on the protagonist, than on combating the infected (I use this term rather than ""zombies"" since it's more fitting for the ghouls in this film). The fear that the film tries to project onto the viewer (tries to make us feel) is more psychological than visceral in that, as I stated before, this is neither action-packed nor full of gore. I think a lot of the negative critical reviews and watcher reviews are due, in large part, to the fact that the story is atypical for this very popular genre and that it is a low-budget affair (budget a little over $1 million).

The film-makers do not try to ""sell"" this film as the next 28 DAYS LATER, DAWN OF THE DEAD, or even THE CRAZIES. So if you go into this film expecting such, you will most likely stop watching after the first 20 minutes or so, or you will simply not like the movie. It avoids some of the ""zombie"" cliches which is refreshing, but it does fall prey to some indy/low-budget ones (for example, some poor dialogue/acting, some sentimentality, some goofs, some missing pieces). For me, the worst part about this film  is that there are some missing pieces (I can get over the cap being on the rifle scope almost every shot and the acting), especially some unanswered questions regarding the protagonist; but it seems that some of those pieces ended up on the cutting room floor due to time and budget constraints.

If you've read Max Brooks's ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE, you may appreciate some of the aspects of the film more. For what it is and all things considered, I would give STATE OF EMERGENCY an honest 6.5 or 7 out of 10. An honest 3-star rating here because the film was okay--nothing too fancy or groundbreaking, but it wasn't trying to be.

Other than that it was a great film.

This movie has none, but then again, these guys have a terrible time handling one zombie at a time.

This movie stands out because it is driven by pure tension rather than buckets of gore (don't get me wrong, I love an exploding zombie every bit as much as the next guy). This movie has a realistic feel that most miss. I was skeptical at first, thinking it would be more of the same. I was wrong. This is actually damn good! It has more of a feel of Right At Your Door in many ways. I say that this one is worth a look.

5367979,4,B009TR7A08,"After an explosion unleashes the contents of a military bio-weapons plant, the population of a county is transformed into an army of flesh-eaters. Trapped in the quarantine zone, Jim finds himself cut off from everyone else and fighting for his own survival. Contacted by a small group of survivors unaffected by the toxins, Jim sets out to reach them. Taking charge and becoming their leader, he struggles to keep order as they hunker down, fortify their stronghold and arm themselves against the flesh-eaters. Radio reports from outside the county hint that a last-ditch government rescue plan is being put together. But can he & the survivors hold out until help arrives?

What amazes me about the film is the fact that, with the cover to the DVD like it is, you'd expect this movie to be something akin to Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead...when, in fact, it is anything but that kind of film. It was on that fact, alone, that I almost didn't buy the film as I figured it as something of the former or, at the very least, an even lower-budget zombie movie that would be a decent time-waster while throwing back a few brews. So, I take a quick look online on my phone and see what everyone else had to say about the movie. Considering it was mostly favorable things about the film, I decide to buy it. Getting it home, I pop it in my DVD player and press play...and came away amazed. State of Emergency rocked! It, too, reminded me of another chapter of The Crazies. Shot on Red One cameras, the film looks astounding. These cameras are blurring the lines between low-budget and high budget efforts. I'm seeing more and more films being made with them(Death Race 3:Inferno, for example). I see a time, in the near future, when these cameras will be the standard issue camera to use to make your low-budgeter look big-budget. Production was good, acting was good. No complaints...except for two things. First and foremost, State of Emergency got off to a pretty slow start. Then, once it got to rolling good, it was over. Second, which is my biggest complaint, is the ending. <Spoiler Alert(?)> Jim actually reunites with his friends at the end and all is good? No surprise at the end? No hint to a sequel? Just hugs and smiles. <Yawn> Come on! I set through a 90 minute movie for that? Please!

At any rate, State of Emergency delivered on all other counts and that's all that mattered to me. It's a zombie film that rise above the others by making things more personal. You can tell Director Turner Clay put some thought into this zombie film.

The zombie genre might be a sea that's been well-swam in but State of Emergency stands out amongst them all. I do hope this is one zombie film that sees a sequel happen.",1367971200,,2717,4.574948665297741

5367981,3,B009TR7A08,"In a day and age where zombie movies are a dime a dozen, filmmakers have to do something in order to stand out from the crowd. It's not enough to just show the walking dead running or lumbering toward victims and then eating them. There's only so many times you can be shocked by a flesh-eater getting plugged in the head with a rifle. George Romero, Danny Broiled, and countless other directors have already given us those moments hundreds of times over. Unfortunately, ""State of Emergency"" is another in a long line of films that brings nothing new to the table at all.

A chemical plant explodes outside a small town. The residents soon show signs of contamination and become ravenous animals with an appetite for flesh. The government closes off the town, leaving any survivors in the area to fend for themselves. Four people holed up in a warehouse must find a way to stay alive and keep the rabid mutants at bay as they await rescue by the military.

There's really not much to say about ""State of Emergency."" It's a fast-moving zombie movie where they have bloodshot eyes, growl, and attack people ferociously. The whole film is forgettable and gives us little to nothing to get excited about. You get mentally and emotionally numb after seeing dozens of these with the same basic set-ups.

Another of my complaints is that we get one zombie at a time in ""State of Emergency."" There's never a ferocious pack of them attacking anyone. One at a time they come out the grassy fields and attack one of the four survivors. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to save money on make-up by only showing one mutant at a time. Granted, the make-up looked good. It should have. There was only one person to apply it to at a time.

Now that I've completely trashed the film, let me give some positive feedback. There are a few moments of genuine suspense when you're waiting for something to jump out from behind or beside a character. The scenes of various mutants standing alone in the distance are also strangely disturbing.

Special features included deleted scenes and two featurettes. One highlights the visual effects and the other is entitled ""The Making of 'State of Emergency.'"" It's very short and consists of several clips of different scenes being shot.

""State of Emergency"" is the type of movie you watch when you've ran out of all other options. If you're a zombie fan, it will temporarily satisfy you're hunger on a boring Saturday night. However, chances are you're not going to remember it in a week. You're definitely not going to remember it after seeing just the trailer for ""World War Z.""",1367625600,4,2610,4.675381263616558

The lack of zombies didn't bother me at all. Anyone remember that one film that had a bunch of zombies in it? So many that they'd form a ""herd"" and chase down any survivor(s)? No? Well you should.

Some might find it dull at times, as there are not zombies running around every five seconds but they are used effectively and the heroes never become super zombie smashing characters, keeping them somewhat realistic.

I do wish they used more practical FX and less CGI. And the zombies are runners and scream like jungle cats. So it is like the Dawn of the Dead remake or 28 Days later sort of thing. So if you hate those sorts of zombies be prepared. IT really is a good movie and worth checking out. Ignore some of the more negative reviews. I will not spoil the plot to much, but one of the reviewers is outright wrong. The lead does not fall in love with a new woman after 6 days. They become friends but that is really as far as it goes. Maybe a hint that she is interested in him, but really she is not used to others caring about her in the least, so it is really just friends through the movie.

One was the fact that one of the infected talked while the others just made guttural noises and stood around like they were in a trance. Seems like more could have been brought out about the infected... were they evolving the longer they were infected, or where they becoming more animal like? Another problem I had was the fact that James seemed to bond a little to soon and really tightly with his new found friends, especially the single woman, seeing as how he has just lost his only friend / girlfriend of 2 years who he was fixing to pop the big question to. There was also a few lulls in dialogue at times, dialogue that seems just a little stiff. But over all, the characters seemed to do pretty much what I would expect folks to do in their situation.
If you are looking for a gore feast, then State of Emergency is not for you! State of Emergency is not a global ""zombie"" infection or a non stop action packed thriller full of hoards of infected cannibals and non-stop shoot um up bloody gore and guts.  It's mainly about the relationship that develops between a group of survivors. I kept feeling like there should be just a tad more ""something"" to this movie. A lot of the bonding that the survivors share was edited out and put in the deleted footage. I think it would have added a little more character development if we had been able to see more interaction between the survivors; a little more of their day to day life. A little more ""zombie / infected"" interaction would have also added a few more moments of tension and the survivors' fight for survival too.
Over all, I give high praise to State of Emergency as well as all involved in the making of it! I enjoyed it for what it was just as much as for what it wasn't. If I were to ever make an infected / zombie movie, I would like to think it would be a little something like State of Emergency!",1366588800,4,2629,4.34349593495935
5367994,4,B009TR7A08,This is a good movie if you are a zombie fan. Not too much gore in this one and still a good scare.,1366588800,,99,3.347826086956522
5367995,3,B009TR7A08,"This turned out to be okay. It isn't a big budget for sure. The 2nd character Scott was a bit weak on acting at first but he got better as the movie progressed. The lead character Jim did a pretty good job.
If you are a fan of zombie movies this was a little different as there were no super heroes. There was a realistic look at a guy that can't just stand by and not act when a person is in trouble. It was just four people trying to be cautious and careful and make it through.
I will watch it again in a couple of years when I have forgotten most of it.
This movie hit the shelves at wal-mart for $9.99.",1366588800,2,607,3.903225806451613
5367996,3,B009TR7A08,"The film opens up with a rather lame scene, then gives you a 4 days earlier.

Jim (Jay Hayden) is the center of this film as he manages to survive a zombie outbreak caused by an explosion at the Montgomery County chemical storage facility. He meets up with three other people held up in a warehouse. It takes 19 minutes before the first zombie attack. The zombies are fast moving people with bad makeup and red contacts. Jim attempts to get the attention of the CG helicopters overhead, but cannot. And that is pretty much it.

What this film had going for it was the realism of the situation and how it was handled. On the downside, it was boring due to the realism of the situation and how it was handled. The dialouge was also boring. No quirky characters in pirate outfits, wearing an eye patch, or pretending to be Bill Murray. And they had a chance to do this with Ix (Tori White) and instead they made her moody and quiet. The whole film was on the dull side.

Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. No f-bombs that I recall. 2 1/2 stars.",1366502400,,1040,4.323076923076923
5367997,2,B009TR7A08,"My husband and I were hopeful about this movie.  We love zombie flicks - usually.  This one was slow moving - it's only 1 hour 30 minutes long but it felt like it was at least 2 1/2 hours long.  The main actor who played ""Jim"" was a mediocre actor at best, the others, particularly the actor who played his friend ""Scott"" was really a bad actor - painfully bad.  With that being said, we did watch the whole thing, so it wasn't completely unbearable - thus, 2 stars.  Don't waste your time or money with this one.",1366502400,3,513,4.1938775510204085
5367998,4,B009TR7A08,"I've seen a fair number of zombie flics over the past number of years and I have to say that I rank this among the best.  It wasn't fast paced, nor did it have famous actors or lots of special effects, but what it did have was believable characters, with believable scenes without all the blood and gore seen in so many movies (just enough to say it was a zombie movie) and real hero's without all the darkside moods.  It won't be recognized as a block buster, but I like happy endings with (spoiler alert!) the survivors surviving.  Highly recommend it!",1366416000,,554,4.411764705882353
5367999,4,B009TR7A08,"Wow...now this is movie making...but not so much for cover art making!

In all seriousness i almost passed solely because of cover art because it struck me as comedy zombie which is almost never done well(exceptions..Zombieland, Dale and Tucker vs, Evil)). Cover art like posters or trailers or even web presence for that matter can break even the greatest movies. Close call indeed...

Now If you liked the Crazies then you will like this movie. I honestly thought just for a moment, that this was a side story or better yet a prequel/sequel(thats right a presequel) to the Crazies which i loved. I found this on a fluke and am giddy to say the least, as finding anything of this quality in the apocalypitc zombie genre is unheard of. Now It doesn't feel budgety, but Im sure it had to be because i certainly never heard of it, and it wasn't available for streaming anywhere but Amazon despite being made 2010?...and furthermore there are no bonafide ""stars"" in it...just solid great acting by all. It kills me to think how many have yet to discover this fluke of apocalyptic nature...

I Don't really Spoil...so read on...
I won't give anything specific away from either movies but lets just say, what happens in SOE could very well have been why the Crazies, in the Crazies happened. They(in The crazies) had to move the remaining stuff cause of the.....yada yada yada Thus my deducing that this could easily be the 3rd episode in: the Crazies, a new series on FX. Great character development, just the right amount of story, nice intro to the ""Crazies"" mindset and again this would just make a fantastic episode for season 1...especially when this takes place in the beginning of the ""problem"". This could definitely be a Walking dead contender in every way, oh man what a nice surprise indeed. This is the kind of quality I've come to expect from Walking Dead and very very few hollywood givings in this category. Hollywood only thinks scifi and action are worthy of budgets, and continually dispenses bad comedy/gorefest/unscripted woefully underbudgeted zombie junk under their pseduo brands..as to avoid the disdain that comes with that mess they call apocalyptic Zombie etc. movie making...unlike this.

Beautifully filmed, great look, great atmosphere, great direction and even better cinematography, in short this movie felt real, looked great, had fantastic acting and a simple idea and execution to match. I can nit-pick anything, no really i can almost always find something. There were literally 2 moments when I said eww bad production/directing decision or why'd they do that? But other than that this was a slow moving delight, with somewhat subtle/light character development but a fantastic sense of dread with no unnecessary gore throughout.

...And I would only call it a zombie movie in the lightest sense; SOE had that 28 days, the Crazies or Berlin Undead vibe just on a smaller quieter scale....

I implore the producers to pitch this as a Walking Dead like worthy adversary to any other cable network...Cable, not any of the big 4(lets count Fox even though..well yeah)...FX would be ideal considering their forray into great television, while SHO or HBO would simply be too much to hope for...best part, the timeline and setting in this movie would serve as the perfect intro for getting this movies idea in the running for a series...in my most humble opinion.

Ill shut up now..

5368000,3,B009TR7A08,"After reading the 4 star reviews I figured I'd give this flick at shot.  I have to say it was surprisingly better than I thought it would be.  The zombies are kind of a mix between the 28 days later drones and the walking dead monsters.  They did have a bit of intelligence to them, which definitely lended to the spookiness of them.  This isn't exactly a gore fest film.  Obviously our heroes do some zombie slaying, but there isn't the mass amounts of blood and guts as in most zombie movies.  Instead, the film-maker focuses on the survivors and how they deal.  I did like the fact the characters didn't clammer around making all the ridiculous mistakes that most do.  They took steps that it seemed like actual people might take in the situation.  All in all, it's not the absolute best of the genre, but it's worth a watch.",1366329600,30,828,4.430463576158941
5368001,4,B009TR7A08,"This was not your usual fast paced Zombie thriller with tons of gore and blood. It was more of a thoughtful movie with a handful of well crafted, suspenseful scenes. I thought the acting was good, and I base that opinion solely on the fact that I cared for the cast by the end of the movie. The movie's ending was nice, with hope rather than the usual slaughter of the main characters. For a low budget movie, I thought it was a winner, and I probably would have given it a fifth star if there were some hard laughs. I did grin a few times. No F-Bombs that I can remember, so when people spoke, they actually said something that a person could think about. Of course, there was that once scene where the female lead tells the male lead what she'll do to him if he touches her candy bars again.",1366329600,,793,4.189542483660131
