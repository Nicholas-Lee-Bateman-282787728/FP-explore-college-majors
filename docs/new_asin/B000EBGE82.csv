2513434,4,B000EBGE82,"TAGS is still a great show, even without Don Knotts as Barney Fife.  In Barney's absence, many other colorful characters were given a chance to shine, including Howard, Goober, Helen and of course, Floyd (at least until the last season,when he was simply too ill).  Barney was an icon, no doubt, but the show still shined as a family show without all the filth of today's so-called sitation comedies.  Not as good as seasons one through five, but pretty darned entertaining still.

As for 'Judith's' review below, the man's name is HOWARD McNEAR! How on earth does one consider themselves a TAGS fan who doesn't even know the name of the cast members????  And as for

'Judith's' remark that 'it was cruel' to keep HOWARD McNEAR on the show after his stroke, HOWARD McNEAR'S family was indeed very grateful to Andy Griffith for keeping him on the show as long as he did (This according every book I've ever read about TAGS).  And the man continued to be funny! SO THERE! Actually, anyone whose main complaint about a character is his 'silly little mustache' doesn't sound like a fan at all, but someone who reviews to ridicule.

My opinion, even without Barney and with color, MAYBERRY RULES!!! (by the way, it was #1 when it went off the air...only two other shows can claim this...'I Love Lucy' and 'Seinfield'.

Pretty good for a show that should've 'folded its tent' huh?",1141948800,10,1374,4.691666666666666
2513435,4,B000EBGE82,"I have to disagree, at least somewhat, with all the reviewers and fans of TAGS who constantly criticize the color episodes (seasons 6-8, episodes 160-249).  Though I have to agree the consistency of the scripts wasn't as good as seasons 1-5, there are some hidden 'gems' in each season, beginning with season 6.

Some of my personal favorites include:

ANDY'S RIVAL (EPISODE 163) - Great performance by veteran character actor Charles 'Wild Wild West' Aidman as a school teacher sent to Mayberry to teach Helen about a new grading system.  Andy does a classic slow burn in several scenes as the seeds of jealousy are gradually planted, and Goober spats the classic line 'if you've seen one monster, you've seen them all' when reviewing the film 'The Monster From Mars'...

A WARNING FROM WARREN (EPISODE 169) - No, Jack Burns was no Don Knotts...not even close.  But as Andy would say 'let's be fair about this thing'...the man was put in an IMPOSSIBLE situation.  Firt off, no one but NO ONE replaces Barney Fife. Secondly, the producers and writers were obviously still writing for Don Knotts.  That said, this was the one 'Warren' episode I truly enjoyed.  Again, Andy gives it the 'slooooooooow burn' until the very end, when he unceremoniously dumps Goober and Warren into Myers lake...

NOTE: Goober's order from the diner: A peanut butter and tuna sandwich...with a milkshake...um um good.

THE LEGEND OF BARNEY FIFE (EPISODE 177)- 'Big Barn' returns to Mayberry to find an admirer of his past heroics (Warren) and an escaped prisoner on the loose.  A prisoner he once helped put away.  Just like old times, its Andy to the rescue of his old comrade. Great to see Barney in action once again, and he shows great class in giving the credit of the arrest to Warren.

LOOK PA, I'M DANCING (EPISODE 181) - Hey, just the single scene where Andy and Helen 'bust a move' is worth the price of admission...ol' Ange jumps and hops about like he truly has 'ants in the pants'....Geez, and I thought I was rhythm-less.

EAT YOUR HEART OUT (EPISODE 182) - Goober falls in love with Flora, but Flora falls for Andy.  Helen stews at Andy while Goober is oblivious until Floyd 'spills the beans' about seeing Flora kiss Andy.  Goober confronts Andy, who eventually convinces Flora that its the Goob she ought to be crazy about.

Welcome to 'Days of Our Lives', Mayberry style.  NOTE: Have to admit, that 'meatloaf plate' looked pretty good.

THE COUNTY CLERK (EPISODE 185) - Introduces everyone's favorite 'mama's boy', Howard Sprague, Mayberry County Clerk. Nasal, whiny, and under constant surveillance by a mother that can only be described as 'Ultra-controlling', Howard is brilliantly played by Jack Dodson, who would later portray 'Ralph Malph's dad on 'Happy Days'.

Again, are these episodes as consistently good as the black and white shows? No.  Does the show miss the late and GREAT Don Knotts' once-in-a-lifetime portrayal of Bernard P. Fife? Of course.  Then again, as someone has earlier stated, I consider the worst color episode of Andy Griffith better than the complete garbage being offered on today's network and cable 'sitcoms', who seem to revel in insults and bodily functions.

Bottom line: Mayberry is still a great place to visit...even in color!

I'll happily add seasons 6-8 to my DVD collection, and hope we see a few extras tacked on.",1141171200,81,3355,4.86443661971831
2513436,3,B000EBGE82,"Yes there are actually two of the now filmed in color episodes from Season Six in which Don Knotts appears as Barney Fife, but the old magic is no longer there as during the previous five seasons. Those two episodes, ""The Return of Barney Fife"" (the saddest episode of the entire series) and ""The Legend of Barney Fife"", along with the two episodes ""Eat Your Heart Out"" and ""Goober's Replacement"" are the main reasons why I will buy this DVD set when it is released. Also, because of completing my DVD collection of the series, I will buy this and the last two sets when made available. I won't look forward to the releases as much as before though. It was still a good show, but was never again to be the classic it once was. As someone else has already said, after Barney Fife left Mayberry, the show stopped being a classic and became just another just another 60's show. I wonder if they will also eventually release the series ""Mayberry RFD"" on DVD? It was in the very first episode of ""Mayberry RFD"" that Andy and Helen finally got married and Barney was also in the episode as Andy's best man. Andy and Helen later had a baby on the show and Andy also made several appearances alone during the show's three-year run. I also wonder if they will ever release the series ""Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C."" and the t.v. movie ""Return to Mayberry"" on DVD?",1141171200,20,1344,4.445344129554656
2513437,2,B000EBGE82,"For a good part of my life I've used the epithet ""that's about as funny as a color episode of Andy Griffith"". There's no more damning phrase that can be hurled at someone attempting to be funny, IMO.

Anything with Warren is painful to watch. Goober isn't funny at any time. Floyd was just about gone by then, no episode centering on Aunt Bee was worth watching in any era. Howard? Emmet? More of angular Helen Crump? Opie with pimples?

No thanks.

What some perceive as depth and social consciousness is to me ham handedness. Barney, Otis, Ernest T. in his prime, some of the best physical comedy seen on TV. The color episodes? ZZZZZZZZZ.

I've got 1-5 and that's all. Might even skip the last episode of season 5  as it was a precursor of things to come.",1140998400,17,758,4.424460431654676
2513438,5,B000EBGE82,"I prefer them to the black and white seasons. The last three seasons offer a greater depth of character acting, variety of topics(contempoary and controvertial for the time),more humor and wit, and a pleasing charm. I'm glad that the series release has reached season 6, and look forward to the prompt release of seasons 7 and 8.",1140912000,7,329,4.7894736842105265
2513439,4,B000EBGE82,"Season 6 saw major changes to The Andy Griffith Show.  The main changes were that the shows were aired for the first time in color, Barney Fife was no longer a regular character, and characters Warren Ferguson (briefly) and Howard Sprague (`til the end of series and Mayberry RFD) would make their entrance.  Many fans do not prefer the color seasons (some even refuse to watch them).  I want to use this review and the reviews for seasons 7 and 8, to stick up for these seasons.  For this review, I want to particularly defend a character who is often maligned: Deputy Warren Ferguson.  He replaced Barney Fife for 11 episodes in season six until he was written out of the series (with no explanation) and never replaced.  He was played by a very underrated actor, Jack Burns, who went on to be a variety show staple through the late 1960s and early 1970s as part of the comedy duo Burns and Schreiber (having their own show in 1973), and later was head writer for The Muppet Show and script supervisor and co-producer for Fridays in the early 1980s.  I thought his Warren character was an excellent addition to the cast and had a main role in a few of my favorite color episodes (A Warning From Warren, Aunt Bee Takes a Job, Girl-Shy, and Otis the Artist).  He was also very easy on the eyes for us female fans.  The criticism about his ""huh-huh-huh"" gimmick (used in his routines with Avery Schreiber) is blown up a bit as he didn't say it that often on TAGS.  He used it the most in his first episode The Bazaar, where his character was being introduced. If you do a web search for ""The Revenge of Warren Ferguson,"" you will find a tribute I created for him. Give Warren a chance.  Now for the season six episodes:

""Opie's Job"":  Another season begins with an Opie ep.  Opie competes with another boy for a grocery job.  Andy is disappointed when he finds out his son gave up on the job, until he hears Opie's reason.

""Andy's Rival"":  It is time for Andy to be jealous for a change.  Helen begins working with a handsome teacher who seems the superior to Andy in every way.

""Malcolm at the Crossroads"":  The last episode for Malcolm Merriweather and Ernest T Bass (I'm not a Ernest T fan, so this was OK by me).  When the bicycling Englishman takes Bass' crosswalk job, Ernest T wants to fight him.

""Aunt Bee, the Swinger"":  Bee wants to impress an old beau who became a politician, and runs herself ragged trying to keep up with, what she believes, is the fast pace he is used to.

""The Bazaar"":  Warren's first episode.  Warren arrests the ladies' auxiliary for illegal gambling (bingo) and the husbands are angry with Andy because who's going to fix them dinner? (can you believe that?!  It's called cereal, milk, a spoon, and a bowl).

""A Warning From Warren"":  Warren believes he has ESP and senses danger lurks for Andy and Helen's planned picnic at Myer's Lake.

""Off to Hollywood"":  Andy gets a $1,000 check for a movie that is being made about his sheriff without a gun story.  Aunt Bee, Opie, and Helen convince him to use the funds on a trip to Hollywood and the townsfolk keep asking Andy for favors (autographs, etc.).

""Taylors in Hollywood"":  One of the funniest color eps.  On location in Hollywood, Andy, Opie and Aunt Bee watch the filming of the movie about them and, Aunt Bee is not pleased with how they and the town are portrayed. Gavin McLeod (Love Boat Captain) plays Andy, and boy is he funny!

""The Hollywood Party"":  A Helen blow-up episode.  Helen sees a publicity photo of Andy (still in Hollywood) and an actress and goes off.

""Aunt Bee on TV"":  Aunt Bee is a winner on a tv game show while in Hollywood and, when she gets back to Mayberry, her friends get tired of hearing about all the prizes she won.

""The Cannon"":  A state mobile museum comes to Mayberry for Founders' Day.  Warren is in charge of guarding it, but is more interested in the old town cannon nearby.

""A Man's Best Friend"":  Maybe the silliest TAGS ep.  Opie and a new friend (a real sarcastic kid) use walkie talkies to convince Goober that his dog can talk.

""Aunt Bee Takes a Job"":  Aunt Bee gets a job at a print shop and doesn't realize her employers are counterfeiters.  This is one of my favorite color eps.  Mr. Clark is a very funny villain (""we're adopting a kid"")  and Warren trying to dislodge the getaway car from the bumper of the squad car while explaining the benefits of advertising-that's classic!

""The Church Organ"":  After the church organ goes flat during her rendition of ""Love Lifted Me,"" Clara refuses to play the old organ and Andy, Warren and a group of businessmen try to put a fund together to buy another organ. Things hit another sour note when Andy can't collect on the pledges.

""Girl-Shy"":  Another classic Helen blow-up episode.  Warren is shy around women until he is sleepwalking. In a somnambulistic state, he gets fresh with Helen.  Bad move!  Hell hath no fury like Helen!

""Otis, the Artist"":  Another favorite of mine.  Warren thinks mosaics might be an appropriate safety valve for Otis to stop his drinking.  Give Warren credit; his plan almost works but, for once, Andy gets in the way of success.

""The Return of Barney Fife"":  Don't worry, Barney appears in this season!  In fact, Don Knotts won an Emmy for this episode.  He returns for a class reunion and learns something shocking about Thelma Lou.

""The Legend of Barney Fife"":  Warren thinks Barney is a living legend but his hero worship is put to the test when Barney appears a coward when a convict he managed to capture escapes.

""Lost and Found"":  Aunt Bee loses an antique brooch and collects on the insurance, only to end up finding the pin.  Jack Dodson (later to play Howard Sprague) appears as the insurance man.

""Wyatt Earp Rides Again"":  The last appearance of Warren.  A fellow claiming to be a descendant of Wyatt Earp along with his big-mouth promoter comes to Mayberry and teaches the kids that ""the man who can fight is the man who is right,"" much to Andy's chagrin.

""Aunt Bee Learns to Drive"":  Andy is worried when Aunt Bee is bent on learning to drive, especially with Goober as her instructor.

""Look Paw, I'm Dancing"":  Opie dreads going to a school dance because he's got two left feet (so to speak).  Unbeknownst to him, this problem was passed down from his father.  Watch this episode to hear some REALLY bad music!

""The Gypsies"":  A gypsy curses Mayberry with a drought after Andy forbids them to sell their wares in town (how often did it rain in Mayberry, anyway?  In ""Quiet Sam"" and I remember Ernest T's ""Sweet Romeena"" mentioned it had rained during Mrs. Wiley's party).

""Eat Your Heart Out"":  Goober has a crush on Flora, but Flora has her sights on a certain sheriff.

""A Baby in the House"":  Aunt Bee takes care of a baby and is saddened because, every time she holds the baby, it cries (maybe the baby knows something about Aunt Bee that we don't).

""The County Clerk"":  Enter Howard Sprague.  Andy and Helen try to fix Howard up with a date but his overbearing mother does not approve.  One of my favorites.  I like the eps with Howard's old bat mother.

""The Foster Lady"":  Aunt Bee becomes the Foster Furniture Polish Lady.  Trivia:  Actual TAGS crew members are members of the commercial crew.

""Goober's Replacement"":  Flora fills in for Goober at the filling station and her feminine charms increase business.

""The Battle of Mayberry"":  Opie tries to get info on the famous town battle and, of course, everyone thinks their relatives were the heroes.  What really happened was not near as heroic.

""A Singer in Town"":  Aunt Bee and Clara write a poem ""My Hometown"" that they try to get set to music.",1139875200,135,7657,4.546989720998532

I felt Andy's character seemed more than a little lost without Barney, especially at the start of the season.  A replacement deputy filled in, then also disappeared.  Jack Burns did well as the new deputy, but then he was gone.  The void left by Barney was ably filled by other cast members, notably Goober receiving a lot of screen time.  I gave this season only 5 stars because Barney was such an important character in the show, and his absence was very noticable.  What made his absence even stranger was that no explanation was given for it, until his guest apperance; that seemed unfair to Barney.  This season seemed to find its footing right after Barney's appearances, and the second half of the season seemed much better than the first.  Although it might not be quite as good as the first five Barney seasons, it's still an entertaining show, and Andy is one of tv's finer straight men to all the crazy characters in the town.",1461024000,10,1032,4.601092896174864

2513699,5,B000EBGE82,"I already knew that the values and life lessons portrayed in the series were exemplary. Then I was even more overwhelmed when I watched Season 6 Episode 29 ""The Battle of Mayberry"" airing originally 4/4/1966. Growing up in the late 50's in the US I saw lots of western themed content and played 'cowboys and indians' as a kid. I have some Native American ancestry on my father's side somewhere that I have always been interested in. As time has come along and we have seen more of the history regarding Native Americans and less accepting of stereotypes we have improved their portrayal. I didn't expect much of that as I watched this episode. As 'blood thirsty savages' were mentioned. But that is not how it was left. Opie realizes that there may be view from the 'indians' who were involved and seeks out a Mayberry citizen whose Indian ancestors had also passed down an account. I think this is pretty remarkable for something that was created in 1966. How can something from this time period be so much more 'politically correct' than our society has become today?

I really wish children had this kind of content (maybe even adults?) to show by example how people can honorably and graciously interact with others. Andy Griffith for President! (and Will Rogers for his Vice President or Secretary of State).

Watching this show gives me a spark of hope for humanity.",1454284800,4,1372,4.7364016736401675

If you are old enough to remember the original CBS broadcasts of the AG show, then you'll probably recall that the same man announcing credits for the b&w years continued doing so for the 3 color seasons.  (That's when I first heard a pronunciation of Frances Bavier's surname.)  A few years ago, a VHS taped from an original CBS print of a color episode confirmed my recollection.  It's strange that this voice-over is missing from syndicated prints of both AG and MAYBERRY R.F.D..

Like the b&w episodes transferred to DVD, these color ones also lack the original closing scene showing Andy and Opie walking back from their fishing hole.

2513870,2,B000EBGE82,"Two stars for any of the ""color"" seasons is probably too generous. If ever there were an obvious line of demarcation for a show going from good to bad, it's this. For me, the show ends after season 5. I don't believe filming this in color had anything to do with that as these episodes would have been bad in any tone, including black and white. Was TAGS even a comedy any more after season 5? Laughs are sparse if they even exist at all. However good or bad Warren may have been, I believe Howard Sprague was one of the most ill-placed characters in a ""comedy"" show. What an incredible bore he was. Yet the entire downfall of the show cannot be placed all at his feet. The entire cast suffered from diminished performances.

The only decent color episodes of TAGS were the ones with Don Knotts.

I hate to rate anything related to TAGS low, but I have to be honest.",1391126400,2,866,4.306748466257669

2513883,2,B000EBGE82,"Season 6 gets a 2/5 star rating from me because the series really changes from hereon in, for the worst. With Barney Fife gone, the show needed another supporting character/deputy. Thus comes Warren. Warren is in my opinion the WORST thing to happen to the show. Why? Because first off HE'S NOT FUNNY!! He's a very boring character who just cannot make me laugh like Fife did. He can't fill Barney's shoes and angers me rather than make me laugh.

The show really loses its humor in season 6. It's like you're watching a bad spin-off of the first 5 seasons. In Seasons 1-5, nearly every episode had me chuckling. Seasons 6-8 don't even manage to get me to smile. There are some good moral episodes, but the show's BEST years are seasons 1-5. Another thing that I hate about these last 3 seasons is Helen Crump. I know she's been on the show since about season 3, but she REALLY got on my nerves in these final seasons. She always fights with Andy, making their relationship seem like a nonstop feud. Also, not as important, season 6 begins broadcasting episodes in color. These episodes being in color has nothing to do with them sucking though.

Please take this review as a warning. If you want the REAL Andy Griffith Show, buy seasons 1-5. The show was obviously intended as a comedy/good moral show, but the ""color seasons"" REALLY lack humor. Do you want the funny and nice side of Andy Taylor? The young and innocent Opie? Barney Fife, arguably the show's funniest character? Well then pretend seasons 6, 7 and 8 don't exist.",1389657600,3,1530,4.58029197080292

2513889,3,B000EBGE82,"OK, up front.  Why 3 stars?  Because (like X-Files, another favorite show of mine) lousy TAGS episodes are still better than most TV, even with 100 stations at our disposal.  Now the rant.

As some reviewers have mentioned, the reasons why the color seasons were substandard compared with the B&W episodes were NOT because the episodes were in color.  Nor were they substandard because Warren replaced Barney.  They were substandard (in my opinion, as well as others) because Bill Idelson & Sam Bobrick and Fred Freeman & Lawrence J. Cohen replaced Jack Elinson & Charles Stewart (seasons 1 & 2) and Everett Greenbaum & Jim Fritzel (seasons 3 & 4) as the main writers.  Quick footnote:  I got my info on the writers of TAGS episodes from Wikipedia.  Thank you, Wikipedia.

As others have noticed, in season 6, Sheriff Andy Taylor becomes much more short tempered (Helen-like, if you will) and is quick to doubt his son Opie.  Case in point.  In the first episode of season 3, Andy believes Opie regarding Mr. BcBeevee.  As we all remember, ""No.  No, I don't believe in Mr. McBeevee.  I DO believe in Opie.""  Yet in the opening episode of season 6, Andy is quick to get sharp with Opie over him losing out on a job.  BTW, Mr. McBeevee was co-written by Harvey Bullock, another major contributor to the B&W episodes.  So Sheriff Andy Taylor acts out of character when it's convenient to the plot.  Writers of the B&W seasons (again, in my opinion, and yes, there were good and bad episode in every season) would've found ways to further the plot... to introduce dilemmas, situations, whatever, without having to take the easy way out of having Andy be ill-tempered or Opie conveniently spouting stilted dialogue that puts Andy in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations or having Helen... never mind.  Helen was Helen, no matter the episode, season, or writer(s).

And I guess the other party I hold culpable for the characters acting ""out of character"" would be Andy Griffith the actor.  Since he was the star of the show and had his name in the title, I'm sure he had SOME power and/or authority to suggest dialogue changes, adjust plot devices or whatever it took to protect the town and citizens of Mayberry.  (I am fully aware that Mayberry is fictional... to some people.)  One possible reason for Andy and the writers not being as good stewards as they could have been is they never assumed there would be VCRs, DVD's, or internet discussions of the most mundane facts of the show.  (So, what WAS Barney's middle name?  Milton?  Oliver?  or P?)  Again, my assumption is they did the best they could, within the confines of a 1960s weekly sitcom.

Wrap up:  If I didn't care for season 6, I didn't have to buy it.  Money talks, so apparently even the color seasons are worth something to me.  However, I am glad to be able to add my name to those who think Jack Burns is unfairly blamed for the sixth season.  And if the writing had been on par with seasons 1-5... especially 2-4... the addition of color wouldn't have mattered.

Proud waves your banner in the sky.  Mayberry Union High.",1387152000,,3092,4.661111111111111
2513890,4,B000EBGE82,"Many Andy Griffith fans can relate to that groan that always came out of me when a color episode of The Andy Griffith Show would come on TV. Not only was there no Barney Fife or Thelma Lou, but the writing wasn't quite as funny as the older seasons, and the color made the show feel different somehow. Now that we have DVD sets, it's no longer necessary to rely on TV to rerun those old favorites, so it's a little easier to watch the color episodes when you don't feel like you've been cheated out of a black-and-white episode by them.

Having said that, I think Season 6 is the best of the three color seasons. Looking through the episode list, there are more here that I like a lot than Season 7 or 8 have. It starts off with ""Opie's Job"", where he gets hired to sweep at the grocery store, but quits so his rival can get the job and help his family pay bills. It has the episode where Malcolm Merriweather and Ernest T. Bass face off for a crossing guard job. I also like both ""The Bazaar"", where Warren arrests the entire Ladies' Auxiliary, and ""A Warning From Warren"", where he convinces himself he's psychic (with help from Goober). I actually like the Hollywood episodes, where Andy, Opie, and Aunt Bee go to California to see ""Sheriff Without a Gun"" being filmed, then return and watch Aunt Bee win a TV game show. This season has ""Otis, the Artist"", where Otis discovers his amazing talent for creating mosaics (while drunk). There are two episodes guest starring Don Knotts, ""The Return of Barney Fife"" and ""The Legend of Barney Fife"", which are two of my obvious favorites. Some other favorites are ""Wyatt Earp Rides Again"", where Andy faces off against a ""relative"" of Earp, ""The Gypsies"" (always did enjoy that one), and Howard Sprague's first episode, ""The County Clerk"".

Obviously, Season 6 has a lot of strong points. It does have a few episodes that aren't that great, but most of them are at least fairly good, and several are above average. Not many after the first episode (""Opie's Job"") reach the level of great, but this is not at all a bad season. At the very least, it's better than I gave it credit for in the past, and at best, it's a B+ season of a show that had just come off five straight A+ seasons. It's totally understandable why so many people, me included, never fully embraced the color episodes, but thanks to the DVD sets, I'm now gaining a hair more admiration for the show's later era. Black-and-white or color, it will always be my favorite TV comedy of all time.",1385164800,,2505,4.455337690631808

2513939,3,B000EBGE82,"I just adore Andy, it is one of my favorite shows of all time and truly one of the best in television history. While there is not enough time to comfortably tell everything i like about this show, i have chosen to review a color season because i echo the sentiments of many others on the later seasons. In addition to superb acting, timelessly loved characters, and small town charm, what truly lent this show its charm is that in the b&w seasons the characters, time and again, always tried to spare each others' feelings, sending a theme of deep morality and caring. While jabs and insults can be funny, the show derived its humor from building their friends and loved ones up, not tearing them down. Whole episodes were built around this kind of caring, with comedic results. The Pickle Story was built around, as Opie says ""Not hurting Aunt Bea's feelin's"" as Andy, Opie, and Barney go to great lengths to not insult Aunt Bea's prized cooking. In Barney and The Cave Rescue, Andy and Helen go so far as to crawl back into the cave to spare Barney's dignity after he assembles a town rescue operation.  In Barney and The Choir, they also go to great lengths to not insult Barney and his singing. On other shows, as in real life many times, one would be told to just buck it up, or be insulted to their face about their cooking. The characters would have you know that something as seemingly ""small"" as sour pickles or sour singing were important parts of their loved one's self and identity, and insulting them to their face was pretty much unthinkable. Because it wasn't just about a bad batch of pickles, it was, as Aunt Bea says ""blue ribbon enough for me"" if the family likes what she makes. Next year, she says, you boys are gonna be the winners. (With the way they treated Aunt Bea with the utmost respect, i think they truly were.) Rather than the humor deriving from telling Barney directly that his singing was bad, the choir arranges to meet at another place to practice, and the humor comes FROM the oblivious and good natured Barney showing up right in the middle of Good Ol' 14-A. Some would think that this implies that the characters are overly sensitive and their friends in denial about imperfection, but it implies just the opposite, that they were MORE than aware that that ""caterwauling tenor"" would disrupt their performance, and were still big enough to treat the situation with grace. Even the town drunk Otis & petty criminals were treated with dignity, patience, and fairness.

This is one of the reasons the later seasons sank. In addition to the things mentioned, such as Andy's grumpy moods, the loss of Barney & other characters, the addition of Howard Sprague, the lifeless acting and bland presentation of the stories, much of this good natured patience towards the town's citizens was gone. Andy looses patience with Aunt Bea, Opie, and Goober. Even tho Andy does attend his three obligatory spaghetti dinners (which is a hilarious episode, btw), and while downing three dinners is a bit different than a few extra pickles, it is done with much more irritation. Another example is ""Goodbye Dolly"" is which Goober sees a plane going over, only to pretty much be ignored by Andy and Howard. Howard replies ""Well, i've seen planes before, Goober."" Lame and lifeless.

In the early days, Andy stopped at nothing to buy Aunt Bea the bedjacket she wanted for her birthday, but if i remember right, was pretty resistant to her taking driving and flying lessons in the later seasons. In the b&w episode ""Class Reunion"" the fact that Aunt Bea had given Andy's highschool yearbook away to a disease drive was met with gentle humor; things even more trivial than this were met with Andy's irritation in the colored ones.

The addition of Howard Sprague just didn't fit. Up til the later seasons, there were no wimps in Mayberry. Even criminals usually came around to a higher moral ground at the end of the show, and the town's citizens acted out of strong character, however bumbling. The idea of an overgrown mama's boy chronically dressed in a suit and getting his daily quota of vitamin c just wasn't that funny.

While i do like a few of the colored episodes and hope to complete my collection someday with the later seasons, nothing can ever compare to the charm and laughs of the original b&w days. I do miss Mayberry.",1301616000,2,4349,4.657552083333333

For those people who are buying the fifth season (1964-65), before viewing the first, the Andy Griffith Show is unique in a sense that it started out fun and had all the standard encounters and stories that most TV programs had but it never deteriorate or got so left field as to lose its appeal. Every show is entertaining and usually carries a message.

Many other programs spun off form the characters that played in this series. Moreover, you always think that Opie Taylor (Ronny Howard) is always young; do not look at that old dude that is now a producer of exceptional movies. Everyone knows that he/she issued Deputy Barney fife ""1960-1965"" (Don Knotts) one bullet that has seen a lot of action in his pocket. Too many people to name here.

Most of the time she's just going against what he says, and telling him what he should be doing. She's not a good picture of a submissive woman at all, in my opinion. My family & I can't stand episodes with her in them. She just bickers with Andy constantly. I loved the time when ""Miss Ellie"" was still around. She had spunk, but wasn't a bossy rag. =)
And another thing...having Barney leave the show was really dumb. He was the life of the program! And he brought out Andy's good/funny side.

2513962,5,B000EBGE82,"I'm so glad these DVD box sets exist, because they gave a twenty-something such as myself the opportunity to become acquainted with one of America's finest television programs...

The story is set in the fictitious little town of Mayberry, North Carolina during the early 1960s. Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) is a widower with a small son. He asks his Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) to move in with him and Opie (Ron Howard) as housekeeper and surrogate mother.

Many of the storylines center upon Opie's childhood dilemmas and coming-of-age situations. While Andy is quick to discipline his son, he is also understanding of the gray areas a child might encounter, and no matter the outcome of a situation, he strives to enforce in Opie the need for kindness and truth.

Other storylines focus upon Warren Ferguson, the town's deputy sheriff. In previous seasons, the role was played by Don Knotts, who was Andy's cousin Barney. But somewhere in Season 5, Barney simply disappears without an explanation, and is ""replaced"" - rather poorly - by Warren. The character is just as bumbling and good-hearted as Barney, but lacks Don Knotts' charisma, especially when fans have been accustomed to five years of it.

Mayberry also includes a number of unique residents, such as Floyd, the kindhearted but vague barber; Otis, the town drunk who is trusted to let himself into his cell as needed; rock-throwing hlllbilly Ernest T. Bass;  the goofy and childlike mechanic Goober; and Opie's teacher Helen Crump, who is also Andy's girlfriend.

If you haven't ever seen an episode of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" give this box set a try! You'll soon be searching for further seasons.",1165536000,3,1680,4.982142857142857

But, after purchasing it and seeing it again, it does not have that much to do with Barney being gone.  OK, it is a factor......Don Knotts was funny!  But, the character of Andy changed drastically.........to this annoying, angry, yelling all the time, grouch! What happened to the loving father knows best Andy?  Several episodes are nothing but he and Helen being angry at each other and bickering.....it's just not funny.  I watched the whole series without even a smile, let alone a laugh!  Warren, who I remember being beyond annoying was not that bad.  The huh, huh, huh, stuff we all remember was exaggerated by other actors taking off on him.....he really does not say it that much. We won't be getting another season.
Ok, I've watched them a few more times and there are a few ""cute"" episodes. Aunt Bee learning to drive is comical, Warren being obsessed about the cannon is also entertaining, along with Goober thinking his dog can talk.

I like Warren as well - not a replacement for Barney but a ""somewhat"" suitable alternative.  My 10 and 12 yr-olds actually prefer this season (6) to earlier seasons.  I personally found some of the earliest shows in the first seasons a bit corny although I know that (corniness) is an appeal to many TAGS fans.

  Ok-ok-ok-so the later (color) seasons aren't as funny as the earlier ones were, yes it was a shame to lose Don Knotts, no Warren is not the equal of Barney, etc, etc, alright, fine, WE GOT IT.  That Still Does Not Mean that season six is worthless or that it cannot and should not be purchased and enjoyed.  Quite the contrary, I went through the whole 30 episodes in about three days, finding lots of laughs and plenty to hold my interest.

  While there are not nearly as many side splittingly funny episodes as there were in earlier seasons, there is still plenty of humor.  While it is unfortunate that many of the old crew are gone or their presence severely diminished (Barney, Thelma Lou, Gomer, Otis), their absence does provide opportunities for more appearances by other already established characters (Floyd, Helen, Clara, Goober) whom we previously hadn't seen as much of (especially Helen.  If you thought she was a hottie in black and white, wait till you see her in color).

  Season six includes lots of re-appearances by actors seen in previous episodes of Andy Griffith (or other sitcoms), such as Robert Emhardt (the ""Man in a hurry""), Ronnie Dapo (the spoiled brat from ""Opie & the Spoiled Kid""), Amzie Strickland (Lila from ""Barney Fife, Realtor"", and she was also Miss Rosemary from ""Andy the Matchmaker""), Ruta Lee (the `college girl' reporter from ""Andy On Trial""), Herb Vigran (the ""Bookie Barber""), Maudie Prickett (Aunt Bee's obnoxious sister from ""The Family Visit""), Vito Scotti (the Japanese sailor and also the mad scientist from two great episodes of Gilligan's Island), Ronnie Schell (CPL Slater from Gomer Pyle USMC), Byron Foulger (Wendell the engineer from Petticoat Junction), Alvy Moore (Hank Kimball from Green Acres), Sid Melton (Alf Monroe from Green Acres), and Frank Cady (Sam Drucker from Green Acres & Petticoat junction).

  Among the highlights of the season six episodes:

-The multi-part episodes where the Taylors go to Hollywood.  These are really funny, on a par with any episodes from previous seasons.

-Malcolm At The Crossroads.  I personally was never a fan of the Malcolm Merriweather character, nor much of Ernest T. Bass either, but this episode features them both and really is a hoot.  This was both characters last and only color appearance.

-The two part episode where Barney and Thelma Lou return to Mayberry.  While these are among the most depressing and unfunny of the entire series run, they are interesting historically, particularly just to see Thelma Lou in color (also her last appearance).

-The County Clerk.  The first appearance of the character of Howard Sprague and his Alfred Hitchcock-esqe domineering mother.  The actor who played Howard, Jack Dodson, also appears in an earlier episode of this season as an insurance salesman (""Lost & Found"").

-Aunt Bee the Swinger.  I usually don't care for any episodes centering around Aunt Bee since they usually just aren't funny, so I was not expecting much here.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  This episode is very reminiscent of the earlier classic AG episode ""Man in a Hurry"", humorous and yet poignant.  The ending (trailer) scene on the porch is really nice.

-Warning from Warren.  The character of Warren takes a lot of flack for some reason.  Ok, so he wasn't Barney Fife, but to have him around is still better than having nothing.  This episode features him to good effect.

-Otis the Artist.  One of only two color appearances of Otis (the other is in the 7th season).

Also worth recognizing and enjoying is what there is, thankfully, none of-teen sex, child pornography, out of wedlock pregnancy, rape, drugs, homosexuality, brutality,  violence, and other ""chic"", `hip"", ""cool"", ""progressive"" behavior that modern day Hollywood likes to push on us in their efforts to indoctrinate us with their anti-American agenda.  You can let your children watch this without fear of their innocence being violated.

  With only one or two questionable exceptions, all the episodes look to be complete in their running times (generally coming in at around 25:15), and are professionally transferred with clear sound and picture quality.

  Keep in mind that part of the benefit of supporting existing seasons is to encourage the bigwigs to keep putting out future seasons.  Mayberry RFD, Gomer Pyle USMC, The New Andy Griffith Show, all these are still yet to be released.  The more support the existing seasons get, the more likely it is we will eventually see the release of these other shows (one can only hope).

  Bottom line-it may not be perfect, but it's still better than anything else out there.  Buy It and Enjoy!!",1150243200,15,4789,4.973518284993695
2513967,4,B000EBGE82,"Although not one of my favorite seasons of the series, this sixth year of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" is most definitely worth placing alongside Seasons 1 through 5 in this series of Paramount DVDs.

Even without the incomparable Don Knotts as a regular cast member, the 6th ""TAGS"" season (1965-1966) still consists of several noteworthy episodes -- including the two shows which have Don Knotts (""Barney Fife"") putting in a guest appearance (""The Return Of Barney Fife"" and ""The Legend Of Barney Fife"").

One thing that really surprised me (in a very positive way) about this sixth-season TAGS set when I started watching these episodes on the DVDs was how sharp and clear and colorful these episodes look on these discs. This was the first (of three) ""in color"" seasons for this TV series, and I have never seen these color shows look any better than Paramount presents them in this 5-Disc DVD set.

The episodes I've watched thus far exhibit just about flawless picture quality, with colors that rival much-newer television shows and movies. Take the very first episode of this sixth season for example (""Opie's Job"")...which is one of the best shows of this season, in my opinion -- the colors jumped right out at me during this episode. I especially noticed the brightness and boldness of the colors during the scenes that take place in the Taylor's kitchen and dining room. The dinnerware (plates and cups) shown in these scenes produces a brilliant blue color on the screen. And Opie's red-headed ""carrot-top"" shows up quite well too. This hardly looks like a show that was filmed four decades ago.

It's yet another fine example of the care that Paramount Home Entertainment has put into many of its TV-on-DVD releases (including all of the 6 ""TAGS"" sets to date -- notwithstanding the few flaws to be found within the Season-Three and Season-Four boxed sets of ""Andy Griffith"" due to some editing out of certain portions of some of the shows).*

* = BTW, fixed fourth-season replacement discs, with the missing laugh tracks restored (except for the tail-end of two episodes where the laughter is STILL missing on the corrected discs for some strange reason), can now be obtained through Paramount in Hollywood. Just mail them the proof-of-purchase off of the Season-4 box flap and ask for the two replacement DVDs in question, and they'll mail them right to you, free of charge. I did just that, and was amazed at the quick response. I mailed in my request for the fixed discs on May 15, 2006, and received the discs by return express mail a mere 9 days later.

Paramount Studios released ""The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Sixth Season"" on May 9th, 2006 (less than three months after that studio cranked out Season 5). Season Six comes in a handsome DVD package just like the previous boxed sets produced in this series by Paramount.

The studio has provided very nice continuity between all of the products in this DVD series of TAGS (with only the box for Season 1 being slightly bulkier in size when compared to the subsequent seasonal sets). And the assortment of colors used for the spines on each ""Andy"" boxed set looks appealing to the eye when all seasons are assembled together.

There's one difference I took note of on the sixth-season box though -- it has the ""CBS DVD"" eyeball logo adorning it. That CBS logo was not attached to the first five DVD collections. All other markings and lettering are identical to the prior releases however.

There's a sturdy outer carton to hold the three slim (clear plastic) cases that reside inside. The five DVDs are spread throughout the three slim cases, with different artwork being displayed on each case. The packaging ""themes"" used for Season #6 include a ""Hollywood"" theme (to tie in with the episodes during this season when the Taylors take a trip to Hollywood, California)....plus a ""Mayberry Courthouse"" theme and a ""Schoolhouse"" setting for the last case.

The composite picture of Andy, Opie, and Aunt Bee that's featured on the front cover of the outer box is one of the better box pics that has been used thus far for this series, in my view. The background showing the Taylor's house and front yard adds a nice homey touch to the artwork as well.

There are 30 full-length programs on these five discs. At least I don't think there are any chunks of these shows cut out anyway. The original opening and closing credits seem to all be intact here as well.

No bonus features are offered up within this DVD set however. The 1.33:1 video is accompanied by audio soundtracks in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono for each episode (English only). A ""Play All Episodes"" feature can be found on all five discs. No episode ""Chapter"" Menus are provided, although chapter breaks are included for every show. The Main Menu is not an animated one and is music-free, and also serves as the Episode Selection Menu screen, just like the earlier TAGS seasons on DVD.

---------------------

Season Six isn't in the same ""classic"" league as the earlier ""Barney Years"" of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" (IMHO) -- but this very first color campaign of T.A.G.S. still provides many laughs and heartfelt moments with the good folks of Mayberry, North Carolina.",1148601600,8,5196,4.810538116591928
2513968,5,B000EBGE82,"To be certain, the sixth season of the Andy Griffith Show marked some notable differences in the series that set it apart from the previous five seasons.  Some changes were good and some not so good.  The evolution to color marked a typical change to the medium that was seen in many TV programs of that era and that was simply a technological improvement.  The loss of Don Knotts to the series proved to be painful, but it was not the end of the road as the series managed to churn out two more seasons even after the sixth.

For us true Andy Griffith Show fans, this DVD collection is a must have for our video libraries because it represents just another chapter in the entire series, and while it may not have the comedic edge of the earlier seasons, it still holds it's own charm and nostalgia and earns it's spot in our video library.  In fact, season six takes some serious criticism from some folks; but there are many enjoyable and memorable episodes in this season - so don't put too much faith in the skeptical reviews.

Once again, Paramount has done a superb job of documenting and presenting the sixth season for our viewing pleasure.  Just as they have done with the previous five DVD collections, this set features handsome packaging and branding on the cases and the discs, plus a good menu system that allows you to skip the ubiquitous previews found on most DVDs.  Most importantly, the video quality is excellent with a sharp digital transfer and good color saturation and contrast.  I don't see anything wrong with the quality of the color as some have noted.  If you are a true fan of the Andy Griffith Show, then you will not be disappointed with this DVD collection.  Don Knotts makes an appearance on a couple of the episodes as well.",1148256000,5,1759,4.534810126582278

thanx",1148169600,2,183,4.083333333333333
2513970,5,B000EBGE82,I agree that the Don Knotts was definately missed on the last 3 seasons but I am so happy to finally have a chance to own all the episodes. The show had to pick up and carry on after Barney's departure and I think they did a great job! I think there were still some great episodes! You can't beat the price tag of each season when you compare to other shows out on DVD!  Plus you know you can pop in a disc without having to worry about content when the little ones are watching!  What a great place to escape to in these trying times! I love Mayberry in b/w and color!,1147996800,2,569,3.982456140350877
2513971,2,B000EBGE82,"Let us be as kind as possible to this season, without being moronic. We all agree that black-and-white was better for AGS. But, ALL television was shifting to color in the mid-1960s and there was no way Griffith, Leonard & Co. could buck that tide. And yes, the color of mid-60s TV is especially ugly. Not sure why, but that's the way it is. And, Don Knotts -- bless his soul -- wanted to move on to do ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"", ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"", ""The Reluctant Astronaut"" and other masterpieces. What was Andy Griffith supposed to do -- kidnap the guy?

BUT. There is no dang reason in God's good universe for why the tone of the show changed so drastically with Year 6. None! Why did Andy and Aunt Bee become so much more harsh? Why is Andy Taylor always annoyed and angry? Why does he make such rash and silly decisions? What happened to the calm, gentle, wise, Zen-like Sheriff Taylor? WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

Can someone please tell me?????",1147996800,9,959,4.443181818181818
2513972,4,B000EBGE82,"Ok folks, we know Barney's gone - we know some of the episodes are a little rediculous, but the show is still very enjoyable.

It's neat to watch Opie going thru adolescence and it's nice seeing other characters further developed.

For me, the color years are part time capsule and part nostalgia.  I'm like several reviewers in thinking that the last 3 seasons get much maligned, more so than they actually deserve.  I received my set on Tuesday (kudos Amazon) and the color is outstanding.  Have only watched 4 episodes, but the picture seems even better than seasons 1-5.

A couple of things I like about the color years and season 6, so far:

It's awesome to see these episodes complete and uncut.  Also, I think some of the epilogues in the color years are the best of the whole series.  The one in ""Aunt Bee, the Swinger"" is great with Bea and Charles Ruggles falling asleep on the front porch.

I hope the final 2 seasons are released soon.  Season 7 has my all-time favorite episode ""Dinner at 8"" where Andy must eat 3 spaghetti dinners in one night.  Great stuff.  Also, the episode, Howard's New Life, where Howard goes to the island to get away from the rat race and then realized his own true paradise is back in Mayberry.  Personally, the epilogue in that episode is the best of the whole series.  Andy, Gomer, Howard and the boys at the filling station drinking a bottle of pop at sunset.  Classic stuff!

Lastly, don't forget, Andy Griffith was one of the only shows in history to end in it's last season as the #1 show in the Neilsens.  So, somebody must have liked the color years.",1147305600,9,1598,4.489583333333333
2513973,2,B000EBGE82,"No use piling on Warren.  He was fired after a handful of episodes, and they didn't even TRY to replace the deputy role.  Obviously, Barney was irreplaceable.

However, the producers made an honest mistake in permitting Don Knotts to return.  In a ratings/business sense, it was good.

But, in the Mayberry-as-fantasy/utopia, it was a disaster.

Barney returns to attend a high-school reunion, and we can see he is overjoyed when he learns that the girl he presumably jilted, Thelma Lou (whose last name we never know), is going to show up, too.

However, the writers betray the character when they have ol' Thel' married to the foreman of a wrecking crew.  Andy can't save Barney from crushing heartbreak.  This destroys the illusion of Mayberry, and damages Andy's role as The Man Who Always Makes Things Right.

This isn't comedy; it's painful to watch.

The same kind of people made Jim Phelps a traitor in a Tom Mapother ego-fest.

No thanks.",1146182400,16,947,4.85
2513974,5,B000EBGE82,"One of the most beloved shows in television history, The Andy Griffith Show takes its viewers back to a simpler time of small town America, apple pie, and black and white television... The trademark whistling theme song is one of the most recognizable in history, and the duration of the show in syndicated reruns is unrivaled by its peers. The Andy Griffith Show follows the exploits of the small town of Mayberry and its family values, no nonsense sheriff Andy. Widowed, and father to a small boy named Opie (Ron Howard), Andy is joined in Mayberry by his sidekick Deputy Barney Fife, his relative and housekeeper Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier), and a host of other eccentric characters.

But the show stealer is Barney Fife (Don Knotts) who plays the role of a sometimes incompetent, kooky deputy always in over his head. The onscreen dynamic between Griffith and Knotts is truly magical. Both men would go on to heralded careers in show business with Knotts starring in numerous roles, such as Mr. Furley on Three's Company, and Griffith as the title star of Matlock. And Ron Howard (Opie) would go on to establish himself as one of Hollywood's most well-known directors...

The Andy Griffith Show (Season 6) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Opie's Job"" in which Opie falls into a heated competition with another boy for a grocery store job, prompting Opie to run all over Mayberry delivering goods in an attempt to please his boss... Other notable episodes include ""Off to Hollywood"" in which Andy receives a one-thousand dollar royalty check for his idea for a show ""Sheriff Without a Gun,"" prompting those around him to convince him to take a trip to Hollywood with the money, and ""Aunt Bee Learns to Drive"" in which Aunt Bee buys a car from Goober so she can learn to drive for herself and not be reliant on others for transportation...

2513975,2,B000EBGE82,"It is true that the Andy Griffith Show never again achieved the kind of bright writing, and great direction after Don Knotts left.  Jack Burns, as Warren is not Barney Fife.  But, Jack Burns never intended to be Barney Fife.  He was pidgeonholed into that role by sponsors, and production staff who wanted to try and catch lightning in a bottle once more.  Jack Burns was, and is a talented man.  He deserves credit where credit is due.  Can you imagine yourself trying to step into a replacement role for Don Knotts??  Largely, these episodes are insipid.  Aunt Bee is bossy and obnoxious.  Goober has been changed into a completely different character than we originally got to know. Andy is almost always angry. Helen is even more of a shrew. (I never did understand what made them settle for Helen Crump as a character in the first place.)  The writing is barely above amatuerish.  There is just no sparkle.  There are a few ""okay"" episodes, but the only really good episodes are those featuring the return of Don knotts. I have seasons 1 through 5.  My collecting stops there.

2513977,4,B000EBGE82,"Unlike lots of folks, I hadn't seen TAGS since it originally aired, and hadn't thought much about it. My Michele got me seasons 1-5 as a gift and I sat down alone to watch them because the show went off the air the year before she was born and she has other interests. Just seeing these old shows and their respective commercials really brought back the memories of the Sixties to me.

I would have been content with this alone but after a time I notice my 8-yr-old was watching all the episodes with me and he became a huge fan and knew all the characters and, of course, his favorite was Barney. The fact they were B&W made no difference to him, he never mentioned it. Not soon after he started watching, Don Knotts passed away. Dad, why did Barney have to die, he asked me. And he was very upset. I brought up a current picture of Don Knotts on the PC and he was shocked to see he was old. Opie bald and past fifty shocked him even more! I was finally able to make him understand the Barney he saw on TV was from long ago, when I was eight years old. He was all right with Barney dying then, because Barney was young and alive whenever he needed him to be, just by putting in a DVD. Since that time he has seen color episodes in syndication. His favorite episodes are still the Barney episodes, particularly the episode where Barney is cluelessly living with the supermarket robbers, but he likes all the episodes because he has embraced all the characters and Mayberry has become like a playground visit for him. These later episodes are not as good, episode for episode, I admit that, season six being no exception, but TAGS is more than a pleasant childhood memory of old guys like me, it is a wonderful experience for little guys like my boy, who somehow still find a way to love Andy and Barney and Mayberry despite all the video games and MTV and skateboard park distractions.",1143849600,26,1885,4.355113636363637

He was great in his own right-Really added a new dimension to this show, and I actually prefer the color episodes to the B/W (I know I'm in the minority...so what?)

When this season starts, we see so much more of the other characters that we get to know them all better!  Opie gets a job, Aunt Bee gets out more, we see a whole other side to her-she wants to be a career girl!  We get to know more about Helen, and I love Howard!  Probably one of my fav characters.  Floyd is hilarious!  And I like seeing what Andy's house looks like in color! BOY-DO THEY LIKE GREEN OR WHAT?!

Some may point out that Barn wasn't in every episode in seasons 1-5 however even when he wasn't his ""letters home"" were even often the highlight. I'm not sure when the likes of Ken Berry and company show up as I'm not as literate in the carnate of this show after Don Knotts, but none of them are properly cast and the show was clearly riding on the chemistry created by Andy and Barney.
