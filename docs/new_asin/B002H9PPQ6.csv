8370198,5,B002H9PPQ6,"I will comment upon Wallander, which I think is very entertaining. True, Wallander is shown throughout brooding, and this is somewhat off-putting, but it fits in with the plot. One of Wallander's fellow police officers has been shot. Although he had no knowledge of it before, never thought about it, he discovers that this officer considered Wallander his best friend. Just before being shot, this man told Wallander that something was bothering him, but Wallander not only missed the fact that other people knew that the officer liked Wallander, he also missed the opportunity to find out what was bothering the officer. This explains his brooding, but not his death.
Several young women are reported missing and are later shot. Other people are also shot. There is no apparent motive and no apparent connection between the deaths. Wallander must find who did the shootings and why. He also needs to find if there is any connection between these deaths and the death of the officer. He discovers a picture of a woman and this leads him to more discoveries.",1487289600,,1058,4.916201117318436
8370199,5,B002H9PPQ6,I ordered this based on another review saying that it could actually play in a U.S. region 1 DVD player. I wasn't disappointed! It plays just fine. This version of Little Dorrit is much cheaper than the others and comes with an extra movie! I couldn't be happier. :),1385078400,3,266,4.448979591836735
8370200,5,B002H9PPQ6,"This listing is for the PBS version of the 2008 Little Dorrit miniseries.  The listing seems to state that the DVD is Region 2 (Europe).  If it is, then most USA DVD players will not play it.  If the listing is incorrect (which I believe it is) and the DVD is actually Region 1 (USA) or region free, then note that the PBS broadcast lasted only 436 minutes versus the BBC DVD broadcast which lasted 452 minutes.  The PBS Masterpiece Classics series editor edited out about 15 minutes of the miniseries and replaced it with the Laura Linney introductions and other PBS related promos and advertisements into the airing.  The PBS DVD also does not have the ""extra"" supplemental material that is included in the BBC DVD version.  Also, English subtitles are not an option on the PBS DVD and you cannot go to a specific point of an episode (no chapter access).  If you want to watch the miniseries as it was broadcast on USA TV in April 2009, then this DVD would be that exact program.  However, please note there are 15 minutes of the original BBC miniseries edited out when it was shown on PBS in the USA.  This DVD version was distributed to the Emmy Award voting audience for their voting for the 2009 Emmy Awards.  Little Dorrit won seven of the eleven nominations in the miniseries category.  This DVD has the miniseries broken down into 5 parts versus the 14 episodes on the BBC DVD version.  There is also on this DVD set one episode of Wallander that was also under Emmy consideration as well.",1254700800,10,1498,4.507407407407407
