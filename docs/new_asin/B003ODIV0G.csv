4162389,2,B003ODIV0G,"Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni made a number of romantic comedies together, but this uneven 1970 film is the only one I've seen so far. Unfortunately, it's more dramedy than romantic comedy, with long stretches of uncertainty where the story can't quite decide what it wants to be. Ultimately, the movie turns out to be an overlong slog that's best saved for late-night television re-runs rather than a DVD purchase. But there are some good points in this English-language Italian production where many of the minor characters are badly dubbed.

First, on the positive side, the two leads are magnetic and charismatic, generating some real chemistry together. Loren is perfectly cast as the sensual woman obsessed with unavailable men who finally has the ultimate misfortune of falling in love with a Catholic priest; like her outfits, her facial expressions are incredibly varied and often funny in a very physical role. Mastroianni likewise nails the characterization of a brainy young priest who is unable to repress his feelings after Loren pursues him relentlessly; he realistically portrays the priest's slide from feeling flattered to becoming obsessed with this erratic woman -- a woman he initially tried to counsel through a hotline after she discovered her lover of four years was married and tried to kill herself. These two leads, evidently used to each other, really shine in capturing the human dynamics of their scenes together in an often uncomfortable and always realistically humorous way. They are masterful.

Second, the film demonstrates real complexity and nuance in many aspects. The immaturity of this budding romance between the superficial girl and the emotionally inexperienced priest is captured along with all of their cute little romantic moments. And while the movie challenges Catholic celibacy by showing a priest who loves his work and grows obsessed with a woman, it also portrays the misery of a married former priest whom Mastroianni visits at one point for counsel, only to discover that the ex-priest now resents his wife as much as he loathes himself and is barely making ends meet financially. This scene is among the funniest and most real in the film. But as the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the relationship between the priest and woman is completely unworkable, leaving the story without any real tension except the dubious entertainment of discovering how badly the woman and priest will hurt each other before it's all over. While the film captures a less noble side of Catholic experience accurately, showing an irresponsible priest allowing himself to be seduced by a girl who loves transgression, it's not terribly entertaining to watch two broken people make bad choices with each other in a movie billed as a comedy.

Unfortunately, the film only grows heavier and more uncomfortable after a clever set-up, quickly surrendering its credentials as a romantic comedy in favor of an increasingly uncertain dramedy tone that drags the plot down like a lead anchor. The ending is either tragic or melodramatic, depending on how you look at it, but it is not romantic or funny. And this gradual shift in tone really kills the picture.

Intermittent bursts of buffoonish humor don't help either. As the relationship between the priest and woman gets more complex and serious, the filmmakers try gamely to inject humor to distract us from a number of genuinely uncomfortable scenes, leading to a number of clownish sequences without any connection to reality. In one particularly bizarre series of events, we watch seminarians dressing in drag for theater performances, priests and seminarians frolicking in cassocks at a sports match where Hail Marys are assigned to losers, and an elderly nun injecting some medicine into an older priest's rear end as he lifts his cassock and bends comically over a bed. During various scenes with church and Vatican officials, we also witness a total lack of logic and taste in several bits apparently meant to satirize Catholicism. Rather than being funny, these scenes distract from the realistic performances of the movie's two leads, and they set up a disconnect with the film's finale where the church clowns suddenly get serious again. So just when the movie has convinced us that we're watching the story of two real people, it hits us over the head with silly bits apparently intended to reassure us that this sort of thing doesn't really happen after all. And then it gets deadly real again at the finale. It's a disorienting effect.

Ultimately, ""The Priest's Wife"" is an intriguing film that tries with humor to capture some of the chaos in the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council, when everything seemed to be up for grabs in the faith. It has two fine performances by the leads; it's also funnier and more sensitive than most cinematic attempts to make a comedy out of priestly celibacy. But it ultimately can't decide whether it wants to be funny and romantic or serious and critical, leading to the strange experience of watching two serious performances surrounded by silliness in a story that ultimately can't commit itself to either path. I'm glad I saw it, but I probably won't re-watch it.

As with all Warner Archives discs, this manufactured-on-demand DVD has nothing on it other than ""Play"" and chapter stops. The picture and audio transfer are actually pretty good for an older film in this series, as the remastering on these discs is often weak. Personally, I found this one overpriced for the content, but I'm grateful to Warner for putting these hard-to-find movies out in any format at all.",1450224000,,5645,5.077586206896552

4162394,5,B003ODIV0G,"Who can resist these leading couple, the Italian equivalent of Hepburn & Tracy, Bogart and Bacall, with the pairing of Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni.
They absolutely shine in their comedic genius and Sophia looks absolutely ravishing in her mod clothing. And WOW what a looker she is.
There is also some good camera work with some swell sights of late 60s/early 70s Italy
A definite must have for all Sophia and or Marcello fans.",1360713600,3,437,4.84

The explosive chemistry between Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren is undeniable.  Although this is not one of their best films together, it is still very good.  Sophia is delightful as the hot tempered, scorned woman who fails at all her relationships and then sets her cap on a priest played by Marcello.  Handsome Marcello is incredibly believable as the celibate, pious priest who tries to help Sofia while attempting to rebuke her advances.  Of course he fails so the age old duplicity of priests is well highlighted.  Very good movie, well worth a view.,",1308441600,8,715,6.1
4162396,5,B003ODIV0G,"(1971) Valeria (Sophia Loren) has just broken up with the man she's been dating for four years, seeing as how she just found out he's married and has a family all this time, by demolishing his car before verbally tearing him a new a*hole. Distraught, she goes home where she lives with her parents (which was still commonplace at that time in Italian households), heads to her room and begins ingesting twenty narcotic pills to end it all. The pills she begins to take are laid out on a magazine cover that has a suicide hotline ad displayed, and she phones it as a comically ironic last gesture. The person at the other end of the line is Prof. Don Mario (Marcello Mastroianni), who just happens to also be a priest. He advises her not to go through with it, but she continues to ingest the narcotics while they converse, ultimately passing out while still on the phone with him.

Father Don gets a phone call from the local hospital while teaching a classroom of Catholic hoodlums the next day, and is surprised to find out that Valeria was brought in for overdosing and has been calling his name incessantly since regaining consciousness. He takes the call and she implores him to visit her at the hospital. Reluctantly agreeing, he shows up and she finds out that he's a priest, but isn't deterred one bit from her attraction to him. She pursues him religiously (pun intended), and the comedic chemistry between these two iconic actors from the Silver Age of cinema , who have appeared together in a total of twelve films, is kicked into high gear for our amusement, enjoyment and, ultimately, befuddlement by the time the film ends. I wasn't prepared for the flick to end the way it did, as it fought the typical Hollywood prerequisite prevalent at that time in popular films. And it confronted the age-old Catholic conundrum by questioning the consequences of celibacy. Which may be why it's not as well known as some of their other pairings like 'Marriage, Italian Style' or 'Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'.

If you're, like me, a fan of both or either of these wonderful actors, this is mandatory viewing, even at the steep price-gouging by Warner Archives (you'd think that if they were asking Criterion prices for these films, they could throw in some bonus material, but we don't even get a trailer, let alone a featurette). Regardless, Sophia and Marcello are superb and superlative in their roles, and I enjoyed this film tremendously. As they say, ""they just don't make 'em like that anymore""...",1293926400,16,2509,4.739130434782608

It intertwines with Sophias personal life because she and Carlo Ponti had difficulty getting married in Italy in the 50s when the Catholic Church had control of the divorce laws in Italy, (Carlo had to divorce his first wife to marry Loren).
