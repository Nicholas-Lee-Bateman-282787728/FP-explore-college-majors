He has terrific talent in singing & writing music as well as acting. Michele,  well, whats to say ,she is always beyond terrific! Would have liked more of  Jacksons 'music, loved the title song he wrote! Blows me away! It is  powerful and full of emotions, and everyone needs to get a glimpse!  Personally I will OWN it, I already have the soundtrack! Would love to see  more of Johnathon Jackson in the future! Keep On makin the hits !;)",936057600,,578,4.519230769230769
10918,3,0767819519,"Ok, I rented this because I figured my girlfriend would like it, but so did I. Michelle Pfeiffer is her most riveting. I normally don't like Treat Williams, but I found his character very beleivable here. Also the young  man who played Vincent (17 yr. old) will do well to keep acting, he has a  road ahead of him. I know it sounds like a movie-of-the-week plot, but it  is quite effective. The DVD itself has a short (5 min) featurette, that is  about as enlightening as it sounds.",934416000,,482,4.382022471910112

10940,2,0767819519,"This movie is not credible on a psychological level. Sam/Ben was too well-adjusted, too articulate, and too mature for his age. Any kid in real life would not be expected to abruptly pack his bag and leave his home behind. He would not have been able to psychologically heal--never mind forgive--his older brother. It would have taken years of therapy for the family to come together as a family. Basically, this is an escapist, feel-good movie with competent enough acting.",1497657600,,474,4.9375

10974,5,0767819519,"One of my all time favorite movies, when my son was 3 we went and saw this movie it just tugged at my heartstrings because as a mother I can totally understand what goes through your mind and heart when you can't find your child for most people you find you child right away and all is well but for others it is years or maybe even never when they get to hold their child again in their arms. I remember the day after we went to see this movie we were in a grocery store and my attention was distracted for an instance and my son wandered off I still remember the panic I felt looking down and he wasn't there, it all turned out great he had just go to see the toys and he is now 22 years old. I would recommend this movie to any one who is a new mom and if you like the movie you really need to read the book it is based off. I couldn't put it down.",1470096000,,850,3.8079096045197742

11011,3,0767819519,"I love Michelle Pfeiffer and she was amazing in this movie, but this movie could have been so much better.
The story was slow and boring, and very sad from beginning to end.

Beth has three small children.
Her three year old son (her middle child) is kidnapped.
She can't handle the loss and can't move on.
She neglects the two children that she still has.
Her marriage suffers.

I could feel Beth's pain at the loss of her child, but I felt more of her guilt over him being kidnapped right under her nose (which really could have happened to anyone, so she was way too hard on herself).

SPOILER ALERT..

The three year old, Ben, is never found by Whoopi Goldberg and the experts who were working for years to find him.
Instead, as a twelve year old, he actually walks up to the family's door and just rings the bell.
He had no idea that this was his real family.  He was simply going door to door, looking for work mowing lawns.
This kidnapped child remained in the same neighborhood all along, and later, both the older brother and younger sister admit that they had seen him around, many times.

Absolutely every character in this movie is miserable.
The irony is that Ben was the only character who was happy, that is, until his real family wants to take him back and away from the only life that he knows, and then, Ben becomes just as miserable as everyone else.

Ben was kidnapped by a woman who was an old acquaintance of Beth's, a woman who was aching for the death of her own child, and so she kidnapped Ben to replace her own three year old boy.
The woman died, and so Ben was raised by the woman's second husband, who had no idea that Ben was not his wife's biological child.
This stepfather described Ben as the happiest child that he had ever known, until it came out that he had been kidnapped, and then he became the saddest child that he had ever known.
For me, the most heartbreaking part of this movie was when the stepfather said this.

Ben is reunited with his real family, but everyone stays miserable.
Beth is thrilled to get her son back, but her joy does not last when she realizes that her son does not remember her and does not accept her.
The real father is relieved to have his son back, but he is also hurting and angry that Ben feels like the stepfather is his real father.
The older brother never wanted Ben back and has a lot of his own guilt and resentments toward Ben.
The little sister was only a baby when Ben was kidnapped, and so she is still too young to really understand what has been going on.

At the end, the family must admit that Ben needs to be with the stepfather, and they reluctantly send him back.
So, this movie begins with the sadness of the kidnapping and remains sad all the way through to the end.",1442620800,2,2755,4.303088803088803

It's like they were meant to find each other. Also, great score collaboration with the movie, the emotional drama of it all. This is the kind of thing i'd imagine Lifetime Channel would play. But, it is worth every penny to own it forever rather than taping it for temporary. Just as good as I remember.

The film benefits greatly from finely crafted, understated performances from Pfeiffer and Williams, as well as the moodiness of Jonathan Jackson as the older brother, Vincent, who is trying bitterly to hold things together.

11090,5,0767819519,"This is a heavy movie, but it rests comfortably on Michelle Pfeiffer's not so fragile shoulders.  I admit I loved watching this because her performance is so spectacular.  Probably one of the best I've seen her do.  It's unfortunate that her performance wasn't in a better film, but this film is good.  You can't compare it to the book which so many are doing.  I think by this time we all know a movie will never be as good as a book.  This could've been a lifetime made for movie, but instead it was a feature film.

Michelle plays Beth Cappadora who heads to her high school reunion with her kids only to have her youngest child abducted.  We're taken into the whole gritty scenario of what would you do if this happened to you?  How would you react if your child is missing for 15 minutes and then two hours later and no sign of him and the police are there.  You would be a mess!  How would you be each day thereafter with no sign of him.  Imagine it.  Nine years goes by and the kid is more grown up and shows up at her front door to mow her lawn.  He matches the description of the projected images that the FBI made him out to look as he got older.  I won't tell you what happens, but you get the drift of the turmoil this poor family goes through.  Michelle falls into the rabbit hole of emotions giving us some of her most brilliant acting work on screen.  The movie is tragic and even more tragic that it wasn't more seen.  I personally enjoyed it and found it to be a nice dramatic family film.",1353283200,,1506,4.170138888888889
11091,5,0767819519,"What makes the Deep End of the Ocean shine bright is in the way the storyline gradually improves as it goes along, and you will find that your emotions are harder to keep under control as it happens.  The writing is mostly good with a few exceptions, and the way the story keeps you attached to the TV screen is definitely one of the positives.  I seriously wasn't expecting such a phenomenal performance by all the actors and actresses involved.  Putting into words what makes this movie so great is very difficult since there's so much attention to emotions and specifically, crying (not exactly tears of sadness either, which is what's so surprising).

With all that said, I can't help but think Michelle Pfieffer's character was slightly and oddly out of whack when she first reacted to her young son getting kidnapped in a crowded area.  Her immediate reaction was confusion and only a slight bit of worry.  Considering how many people were around, and given the fact her son was only 4 years old, it's hard to believe she wouldn't freak out more.  As harsh as this might sound, I'm almost glad she eventually responded with a nervous breakdown when the reality set in that her son is actually missing.  This scene saves the whole segment.

I suppose as the weeks turn into months and the months turn into years, it's somewhat normal for a mother (and father) to move on by removing pictures of their child and pretending the child was never in their lives (or that the child was in their lives at one point, but recognize they are now a distant memory).  Then again... I've never been in such a situation (kidnapped son or daughter) so I can't say I would have responded the same way.  Given how I usually keep pictures on the living room hutch and never take them down, I suppose I'd have kept the pictures if he were my child.  I wasn't sure if Michelle's character was throwing away pictures of her son in the trashcan or, since she was a photographer, throwing away pictures of the things she used to find meaningful (since she's now depressed and her perception has faded).  This is where it gets confusing- Michelle's character was secluded and depressed... I think.  I'm not 100% sure she was.  Her character felt off some of the time so her behavior was hard to understand.

Even more unusual is the father who was more than ready to move on with business related stuff.  The oldest son -who was standing directly beside his younger brother in that crowded area during the kidnapping- was reacting even more unusually by not showing even the least bit of concern (as evident by the way he was playing his Game Boy at the breakfast table and showing signs of happiness or rather expressing feelings that ""It's no big deal"").  This is more the result of bad writing I believe.  The kid probably should have felt *somewhat* responsible for his brothers disappearance despite his young age.  We *do* find out later he was more than old enough to understand what he'd done wrong however.  Of course it could be argued that what Michelle did was wrong too- leaving two young boys alone for a moment and not being confident enough to know exactly where they were standing amongst the chaotic crowd.  That's not a smart parenting decision.  Then again, leaving kids alone and assuming no harm will be done is a common feeling among many people so I can't really blame her there.

Michelle's character eventually settles into a ""Oh that makes sense- that's how a mother should react to such a traumatic situation"" but the father and oldest son were never really given the same kind of believable treatment, which makes me think the writers intended to focus the film around Michell Pfieffer's character and reactions all along.  Hey, she was the most popular actor/actress the time it was released after all.

Anyway, when the kidnapped son miraculously comes home under the most hard to believe circumstances (he was living 2 blocks away the whole time?) this is when I'm certainly confident in giving this film a solid 5-star rating.  The kidnapped son was the best actor in the entire movie.  Whether it be his reaction to having to move away from the man he once called his father and suddenly having to radically change his lifestyle with his real family (that he barely remembers and therefore feels out of place) or the way his upbeat personality has a knack for bringing out the raw emotions in his older brother and mother, he definitely steals the show here.  No doubt about it.

Oh and what's up with that scene where the parents were fighting and the oldest boy walks up to his baby sisters crib and smuggles her mouth?  I THINK the reason is because he wanted her to cry so their parents would stop fighting and quickly run to the bedroom, but the boy could have found a better way of ending that argument than putting his sisters health in danger.  I guess it can be chalked up to ""Kids will be kids"" and do silly irrational things.

Overall, an emotionally award-winning performance all around.",1346630400,,5014,4.654937570942111

11098,3,0767819519,"""The Deep End of the Ocean"" is based on Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling novel. It's the story of a busy mother, Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose son Ben is kidnapped at the age of three. Nine years later, Ben is found and is reunited with his family, but he doesn't have much interest in getting to know them and is resentful about being yanked out of his old life.

I enjoyed this movie. It's pretty true to the novel, and the few things that were changed for the film aren't all that important. I think the biggest difference between the book and the movie is that the character of Beth is much more toned-down and sympathetic on the big screen than she is on paper. Mitchard's version of the character is more interesting and complex, but I can see why the producers probably thought it wouldn't do well on the big screen. Pfeiffer delivers a strong performance, as does Jonathan Jackson, who plays the oldest Cappadora son, Vincent. The only casting decision that left me puzzled is Whoopi Goldberg, who is probably the last person on earth I would have picked to play Detective Candy Bliss, but oh well.

Bottom line: This is a good, solid film. Not great, but very good. The story is about as unrealistic as you can get and I think the ending is way too optimistic, but stranger things have been known to happen in this world.",1192752000,,1343,4.568464730290456

11100,3,0767819519,"One of the fringe benefits of a major format change is the inevitable markdowns of old stock of the old format.  I've been taking advantage of the VHS sales in local video stores for quite a while now.  Many of them are dirt cheap, and if you still have a functional VCR and don't demand all the ""extras"" of the DVD format, you can find all kinds of bargains.

And all kinds of dross too, unfortunately.  I purchased this movie recently, along with several other films starring Michelle Pfeiffer and was contemplating holding my own personal ""Pfeiffer Film Festival,"" but for better or for worse, I started out with DEEP END OF THE OCEAN and that pretty much nipped those plans in the bud.  I wound up shelving the other entries in the Pfeiffer filmography for another rainy day.  This one was just too depressing.  And I don't mean the content.

I think most people recognize that Michelle Pfeiffer is a talented actress as well as being a very beautiful woman.  But like many good actresses, she seems to wind up in mediocre film after mediocre film.  Maybe it was ever thus.  How many truly great films did a Katharine Hepburn or a Bette Davis really do in their day.  And Liz Taylor did clunker after clunker in the late 60s and early 70s.  But there was a significant change in recent decades.  Even our biggest stars of today don't carry films the way they once did.  No one goes to see a Michelle Pfeiffer film just because Michelle Pfeiffer is in it these days.  The pressure is on, then, for an actor to pick vehicles worthy of his or her talents.

A number of the reviews I've seen posted here and elsewhere have elaborated on THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN's storyline, so I won't belabor that here.  Suffice to say that the story of a child's kidnapping and the subsequent emotional trauma it inflicts on an entire family is a potentially powerful one.  Pfeiffer heads a strong cast, including Treat Williams as her equally grieving but more resilient husband.  They all have good moments and make the most of their screentime, but the story never quite gels.  And it doesn't get much better when after ten years, the family is abruptly reunited with their lost son.

The fact that the reunion is highly unlikely is not so much the problem.  I'm not out to revoke anyone's dramatic license here.  What makes no dramatic sense or even common sense is the family's handling of the situation.  In the Age of Oprah, how come no one even considers any kind of counseling for ANYONE in the family.  Many people (and many entire families, of course) are resistant to seeking psychological help, but under such extraordinary circumstances, it's hard to imagine this family not even considering the option.  If not for themselves, how about for the boy?  After all he's been through, even the proudest of families should feel little compunction about his receiving professional help.

Like many other reviewers who have not read Jacquelyn Michaud's acclaimed novel upon which this film is based, I am guessing that this is likely one more case in which the ""book was better.""  A novel, of course, can indulge in more leisurely pacing, and provide more background and, most importantly, can utilize techniques like interior monologue which contemporary cinema rightly eschews.  (Voiceovers don't cut it--and never did).  I wonder too if the book might not have provided us with some kind of explanation for the evocative title.  There seems to be a trend toward a kind of emotional topography in recent fiction and cinema (not only ""deep ends of the ocean"" but also ""maps of the world"" and of ""the human heart"").  Apparently, they mean something.  The book may make it clear.  The movie doesn't really bother.",1127520000,7,3706,4.709175738724728

11104,5,0767819519,"""Deep End of the Ocean"" is one of the most effective and emotionally heartwrenching films I have ever seen. It really shows how it only takes a minute for a child to be kidnapped and his family to be permanently affected because of it. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Beth Cappadora, the loving but somewhat ditzy young mother who takes her two small sons and her infant daughter with her to a high school reunion at a hotel. There, Beth makes perhaps the biggest mistake of her life when she leaves the two boys alone right smack in the middle of a very crowded lobby while she pays at the front desk. As can only be expected when two young children are left unsupervised, something happens. The younger son--3-year-old Ben--disappears and is not found. After a series of breakdowns and withdrawals, Beth is finally able to start putting her life back together with the help of Pat, her extremely loving and supportive husband. Just when things are finally getting better for Beth and her family, a 12-year-old Ben randomly shows up at the Cappadoras' doorstep, so beginning another long period of confusion, fear, discomfort, and pain for everyone involved. It really is a very moving film; much like ""The Face on the Milk Carton,"" but with a very different conclusion. ""The Deep End of The Ocean"" really grasps the issues of child abduction, the effects that it has on the other children in the family, and everything a mother goes through when she realizes that her child is lost and may never be seen again. I was personally touched by Jonathan Jackson's character--Vincent, the oldest Cappadora son. Only seven years old at the beginning of the movie, he ends up holding his family together when Ben disappears, and he is clearly overlooked throughout it all. Obviously, this plays a big part in the behavioral issues and problems that Vincent develops as he grows older. The character he plays is very realistic, and you come to understand how much he truly was overshadowed when Ben disappeared and how much he needs to know that his parents still love him and have forgiven him for what happened. (I won't say what he needs forgiveness for, but it all ties together in the movie.) Treat Williams was masterful as the loving husband. To me, he was the strongest part of the movie. He loved his wife unconditionally, he was a very caring father, and all he wanted was to help make his family whole again. Although he is sometimes a little unrealistic through his opinion that everything will fall right into place, it is very nice to know that there is a character in the movie with a very optimistic viewpoint and a belief that things will be all right in the end.
This is a movie that may move you to tears and may disturb you at some parts, but it is definitely worth seeing. The plot and the characters are presented in such a way that you can really see, know, and understand the ordinary life that they are forced to leave behind and the family issues which they don't choose but must take. Recommended viewing...very effective and poignant with a very strong message.",1025308800,2,3083,4.679558011049724
11105,4,0767819519,"As a parent, I could certainly empathize with the mother.  Losing a child is definitely a concern most parents have from time to time.
Once it was realized that Ben lived down the street, the emotions began to arise again.  In me, this time, it was more for the child than the parent.  While, I still wanted Ben to be reunited with his family, you have to stop and think of the emotions this child is going through.
As a three-year-old, he loses his mom when he is abducted.  Then, the ""mother"" that reared him committed suicide, so he lost his mom a second time.  Then when his natural parents find him, he is taken away from the ""dad"" that reared him.  I cannot begin to imagine the confusion going through his mind.
I felt the portrayal of the DSS (Department of Social Services) was rather good.  In my opinion, they were portrayed as being cold and heartless.  While there are many in the DSS who are not heartless, the general trend of the agency is cold.  The DSS needed to spend time working with this teen to acclimate him to the news that his ""dad"" was not actually his father and that he had been abducted as a child.  They needed to work with him through his grief and work out a solution on how he could see the man who did rear him for so many years, who also was a victim in this situation.
The story would have been stronger if it dealt more with the emotions of the child/teen and less with the mother.  Most people, especially parents, can easily see her pain, but Ben's was overlooked in parts.
I would highly recommend the movie.  Be committed to seeing it through as there are some slow parts.",1017964800,,1614,4.325581395348837
11106,4,0767819519,"The Deep End of the Ocean is a drama about child/stranger abduction.  The Cappadora's are a family of five living in Wisconsin.  The mother, Beth (played by Michelle Phillips), is a photographer.  One fall day, she and her three children Vincent (5), Ben (3), and Carrie (a few months old) take a weekend trip to Chicago to attend her class reunion.  Beth and the children arrive at the hotel, where she is greeted by many past and present friends.  Amongst all the chaos and excitement in the lobby, Ben was kidnapped while Vincent was supposed to be watching him.  Pat, Beth's husband (played by Treet Williams), was notified and immediately went to Beth's side.  Beth remained in Chicago for two months while Pat returned to Wisconsin with Vincent and Carrie.  While Beth was in Chicago, she became close to a police detective named Candy Bliss (played by Whoopi Goldberg), basically living at the police station.  Beth finally returned home after two months of staying in Chicago.  Pat was the backbone of the family by taking care of the children and the family business while Beth fell deeper into depression.  Even though she has two children that need her to love them, she can only think of Ben and how she lost him.  The story moves ahead nine years.  Pat opened a new restaurant in Chicago, where they moved to two years before.  Beth started taking pictures again and appears to have adjusted to their life without Ben.  Carrie was now nine years old and Vincent was a teenager with many behavioral problems.  Life moved on until one day a boy knocked on their door asking if he could mow their yard.  Beth froze in disbelief.  Beth took a few pictures of him, while he mowed the yard and compared them to the pictures to the age-progression picture that the police had made of Ben.  The pictures looked identical.  Life turned upside-down again.  The police, Beth, Pat, and Candy went to Ben's home.  Ben's ""father"", George Karras, didn't understand what was happening because he had legally adopted Ben.  Actually, he adopted Sam, Ben's new name.  This plot in the story is astonishing since Beth doesn't know the identity of the abductor and George didn't realize that Ben was kidnapped.  Moving Ben into the Cappadora's home is stressful on the whole family.  Many conflicting emotions between Beth and Pat surface as they search for a way to reconnect with the child they had lost.  Vincent and Carrie sit in the background while Beth and Pat focus on their relationship with Ben.  The attention Ben gets from everyone adds stress to the already strained relationship between him and Vincent.  Ben tries to stay open to the possibilities and doesn't want to close any doors.  He wants to keep his relationship with George, but Beth and Pat make it virtually impossible.  Ben doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings but wants happiness for himslf also.  At the end of the movie, everyone seems to relax as the light at the end of the tunnel gets closer.  A serene, calm atmosphere absorbs the last scene as Ben and Vincent finally connect.  This story has many sides.  When Beth loses Ben, the pain she felt makes your heart heavy.  Any mother can only imagine how that feels.  Watching it happen to someone else is painful but the thought of that happening to your own child is overwhelming.  A joyful side of this movie is when Ben is found.  The excitement, the wonder, and the anticipation of Sam being Ben, was a high point of the movie.  He had been two blocks away for two years.  A simple knock on the door changed their lives again.  The section of the movie that included Sam was a little slow.  Beth, Pat, and Ben (Sam) seemed to be living the same way for months with no noticeable progress.  This made this movie seem to last longer than what it really needed to be.  An aspect that could have made this movie more realistic is Ben's personality.  He is an extremely mature twelve-year old.  His reactions were too optimistic and cheerful most of the time.  I think that the typical teenager in this situation would have rebelled or become more isolated.  If Ben had been more confused, perhaps his reactions would have been easier to sympathize with.  I didn't feel a connection with Ben.  Even though he was one of the main characters, I didn't feel any kind of relationship with him.  This story is divided into two sections.  The first part is from the abduction through three or four months following the abduction.  This part pulls on your emotions of how you would cope with the loss of your child.  It's as if Ben were dead but not knowing exactly if he is or not is worse.  The second half deals with the return of Ben and how the family including Ben copes with this adjustment.  The twists in this half seem to fade compared to the first half.  The struggles and accomplishments appear to compliment each other but without a climax.  The family pushes each other away but together at the end.  There's not a huge event or tragedy that brings them back together.  This movie is what I would call a ""chick-flick"" in regards to the story following the mother's perspective.  It really calls to mother's emotions.  It brings the viewer to a level that is uncomfortable and to a situation that only happens to other children, not yours.  ""What if my child was kidnapped?"" is a powerful statement.  This movie makes you examine your own habits or practices and what you would do in the same situation.  I left this movie realizing that I could be Beth.  Even though this is only a movie, it has an underlying message about how child abduction only takes a second.",985564800,13,5596,4.642857142857143
11107,1,0767819519,"Michelle Pfeiffer fails to convince me of her grief at losing her son to a kidnapper. She seems guilty about losing sight of him momentarily and for letting him get lost. Her guilt overtakes everything, and she is not a very devoted mother to her other two children. You can see that they are suffering from her neglect and total self-absorption. I felt that the movie was supposed to have been very compelling on an emotional, almost primal, level, but it was not compelling at all. I imagine that the book did a better job of conveying the terror of losing your child and realizing that your child may be gone forever. The people in the film all seemed to be too obsessed with themselves. Naturally this kind of tragedy will cause introspection and times of real doubt and soul searching, but I did not get the sense that the people here had any level of depth or sincerity.",985564800,10,876,4.515723270440252

11118,4,0767819519,"""The Deep End of the Ocean"" is one of the best movies of 1999, complex and moving, with truly emotional characters played by actors who carry the weight of the story on their shoulders with incredible ease and make it heartwarming and believable. The movie is actually two different stories, one being a family's emotional coming-to-terms with a missing child, and then the pain and stress they must endure when he shows up nine years later.
On her way to her high school reunion, Beth Cappadora is told by her husband that if her head wasn't attached to her, she would lose it quickly. This provides a short laugh, while also setting up what is to come. At the reunion, she leaves her three-year-old son Ben in the care of his older brother Vincent, only to come back moments later and realize that he is gone. Hysterics grow, and after a thorough search of the building, he is nowhere to be found. Surrounded by family and friends, Beth begins to cope with her mistake as the community gets involved in the search for Ben, without success. Resigned to the fact that he will never be found, she returns home, and while the first steps to coping with what has happened are rocky, the family seems to be getting along well after the passage of nine years. They have moved to a new house in a new town, her husband has the restaurant he always wanted... A knock on the door turns everything upside down. Beth immediately recognizes the boy as her son, and is relieved and confused that he lives only two blocks away from their new residence. The authorities get involved, and soon Ben is taken from the only home he can remember and placed in a new and somewhat emotionally frightening setting where he is called by a name he does not know and lives with people he does not remember or feel much for.
What makes this movie work for me is the complexity of the story as well as the characters, and the magnificence in which the two blend together. The first part of the story admittedly is the more believable of the two, diving into the emotions of the family as they must cope with the grief of the missing Ben. Beth's reaction to her son's disappearance is superbly acted out by Michelle Pheiffer, who carries it like she's been through it in reality. The first half of the movie shows her dealing with the pain in the only way she knows how: shutting everyone else out, ignoring the optimism of life that is to be explored. This causes her to become somewhat distanced from her husband, played by Treat Williams, and her oldest son, who feels the great weight of responsibility set in when he must take care of his little sister while his parents argue.
The second half of the movie is the more emotional of the two, however, as the family, who is just beginning to enjoy life, find their son and bring him back home. There is an unmistakable truth in what occurs emotionally between the two brothers, Vincent and Ben, who goes by Sam. Vincent, who has just begun to gain the attention he never got from his parents, feels threatened by the presence of Ben, and does everything he can to make his long-lost sibling feel unwelcome. This, accompanied by the emotional baggage toted by the family in their struggle to be happy together all conspire to make the movie more heartfelt, warming and true.
Some of the best acting talent ever has gone into the making of this movie, which is heavily called for considering the amount of emotion that needs to be conveyed to the audience. Michelle Pheiffer is Beth Cappadora, and in this role, she is literally required to become her character. She does this with superb talent, playing Beth as an overall emotional person with a strong will hidden beneath her sorrows. Treat Williams makes the perfect supportive husband, as well as a father who just wants things to be like he always imagined for his family. Ben's return has a big effect on him, and when he puts his foot down about what the family does together, the acting is nothing short of amazing. Jackson does a great job in playing the older brother Vincent, as well as the wild-child teenager who gets into a lot of trouble. Whoopi Goldberg seems like a stretch as the detective working the case, but she works the camera as well with her serious demeanor.
Complexity and integrity are what make a movie worth watching, and ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" has all of this and more. The fact that the plot is basically two parts should not be a deference from the film; believe me, the story rolls right along. Dynamic performances and highly likeable characters also add to the film's appeal. What more can you ask for?",980294400,19,4618,4.5516826923076925
11119,5,0767819519,"Surprisingly good film despite some of the reviews it got.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays distraught mother Bethy Cappadora whose three year old son Ben goes missing during her High School reunion.  If you are looking for an exciting film with lots of action then don't watch this.  ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" is an intelligent film about a family coming to terms with the loss of their child and then his miraculous recovery nine years later.  Pfeiffer is excellent in her role as mother and photographer who must come to terms with her guilt of turning her back for just a moment and loosing sight of her small son.  Treat Williams gives a credible performance as her bewildered husband and Jonathan Jackson who plays Vincent, the Cappadora's oldest son at 16, is quietly believeable as a boy with a troubled conscience.  Add to this the talents of Whoopi Goldberg as a gay black Police Woman assigned to the case and you have a solid film that is both compelling and watchable.  I enjoyed ""Deep End of the Ocean"" because of its intelligence and the compassionate way it treated a very sensitive subject.

11121,1,0767819519,"I must say, after watching this movie, I was looking forward to reading  some hilarious amazon reviews that would rip it to shreds....however, it  seems that most of the reviews were written by people that liked this  movie.  All in all, it was AWFUL!  The actors, some of whom did a fair job,  suffered from the terrible script.  Who wrote this movie anyway?  Most of  the dialogue was so unbelievably generic that it could have been written by  fifth graders.  I'm not really sure why Michelle Pfeiffer would waste her  time with this movie.  Unfortunately, she had to look as sad and vulnerable  as possible in nearly EVERY scene--this became OLD FAST.  Whoopie Goldberg  as an agent of the law?  Treat Williams, not a bad actor, also suffered  from his horrid lines.  I kept waiting for him to begin chasing Michelle  around the house with a butcher's knife yelling how it was really him that  planned the whole thing.  Then there's the oldest kid--all he does is WHINE  his dialogue throughout the movie.  And then there's Sam, the kid that was  lost for so many years...he looked as though he was quietly plotting the  demise of his biological family and just waiting for the right moment to  kill them all.  About the only role that didn't suck was the little girl,  who mysteriously disappears half way through the movie, never to be heard  from again.  And then there's the costumes and scenery.  I know this is  supposed to be suburban chicago, and I love movies set in Chicago, but the  wardrobe people apparently decided to dress everyone in the most cliched  suburban way possible, actually they look like they're modeling the new  fall wardrobe for some department store, and scenery....well you'll see  what I mean.  I haven't read the book, I must say, by the end of the movie,  it seems like the writers either forgot what they were writing about, or  the production ran out of money and had to end the movie the way it was.  Remarkably, the longest any dramatic tension is sustained is for about two  seconds, and any emotional interest in the characters is completely  non-existent by the end of the movie.  The chain of events throughout the  movie is nonsensical and ridiculous.  All in my opinion, of course.",969235200,4,2230,4.690104166666667
11122,2,0767819519,"The story begins with Beth Cappadora going to her High School Reunion in  Chicago.  For some reason, she brings all her kids and leaves her husband  behind.  However, a tragedy strikes when she leaves the older boy (Vincent)  to watch the younger one (Ben) and he goes missing.  He goes missing for 10  years.
Much of the movie involves the consequences of such an action  immediately after the abduction as well as the scars that it leaves even 10  years later.  Vincent, who is not like 17, has become a hardened teen,  partly because of his guilt for letting Ben go and partly because his  mother stopped doing her job as a parent for so many years.  The  wife/husband relationship is also strained but is on the mend as Ben (now  called Sam) comes back into their lives.
However, Ben/Sam is not happy  to be back.  He has been living a quiet, happy life with the only parent he  ever knew, his father.  To be stripped of his father because of something  the now deceased mother did is also a tragedy in itself.  Who are the  parents here?  The Cappadora who raised him to age 3 and are the biological  parents or George Karras who raised Ben/Sam for the remaining 10 years and  is the only parent that Ben/Sam ever knew?
Well these questions are not  really answered in this melodrama because Ben/Sam becomes less the focus of  the story.  Actually the director goes all over the place patching up story  leaks with quaint little fixes that are reminiscent of Sit coms.  I felt  this plotline belonged more on ""Growing Pains"" than on the silver  screen.  The worst part of the movie comes at the end when George suddenly  lets Ben/Sam go ""home"" and Ben/Sam suddenly feels that the  Cappadora's are his real family.  This is after Beth lets him go and  Vincent is a real jerk to him.  It is a cop-out ending IMO.

11125,2,0767819519,"Like far too many films these days, ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" begins promisingly then collapses midway under the crushing weight of heavyhanded plot mechanics, incredibility and sentimentality. The premise  of the story is so compelling that the audience can't help but be drawn  emotionally into the intense plight facing this family.
Michelle  Pfeiffer portrays a young photographer, living an idyllic life in Madison,  Wisconsin with a loving and devoted husband (Treat Williams) and three  adorable young children. While in Chicago for a class reunion, every  parent's ultimate nightmare becomes a reality: her middle child  unaccountably disappears in the middle of a crowded hotel lobby. These  scenes, in which she undergoes a sense of mounting panic as well as a  crushing sense of guilt and personal self-doubt, are more terrifying than  anything contained in a conventional ""horror"" film. We cringe too  as the investigators come up against one blank wall after another,  empathizing fully with a mother driven to desperation in the face of the  unspeakable.
As months pass, the family attempts to cope with the  horrific reality of their situation and the film promises to become an  insightful study of the effects of the loss, fear and guilt that  accompanies the disappearance of a child. But then the film goes agley as  it moves ahead a decade and the child is miraculously discovered living a  mere few blocks away, happily ensconced with a man first thought to be a  kidnapper then revealed as an innocent pawn in an abduction scheme gone  awry. As the child moves in with his ""true"" parents, the  screenplay settles into a bland T.V. movie formula, in which each character  must act out his or her customary little drama with little heed given to  believability or originality. Instead of exploring the various stages a  family goes through in the wake of a devastating loss, the film cheats us  by coming through with an unconvincingly upbeat resolution. It becomes  quite clear that the filmmakers are far more concerned with jerking out  tears than with providing a truly thoughtprovoking exploration of its  theme. This is a shame because the actors (especially Pfeiffer) handle  their roles admirably. Only Whoopi Goldberg, in a totally thankless role as  a compassionate investigator of missing children, seems hopelessly miscast.  This film might well have been a labor of love for her (and indeed for  everyone involved), but for the audience, it only makes one sigh over how  much better it might have been.",964396800,6,2537,5.080097087378641
11126,5,0767819519,"The Deep End Of The Ocean was a very touching movie. The acting in the film was great. The movie was like 2 movies in one. The first half was dealing with a family who had just lost their son. Nobody knows what has  happened to him. Then the next half of the movie was when the family moves  into a new house a couple of states away and their long lost son comes  knocking at their door asking them if they want their lawn mowed. That is  how they become a family again. But then they start to realize that the boy  is not happy with this ""new"" family. So they give him back. Then  at the end he goes with the origanal family again. Very good movie.  Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Willaims gave outstanding performances.  Jonathan Jackson was also a very big part of this movie. He also did very  well. This was a good movie and you should buy it. It will inspire you.",962928000,3,866,4.137724550898204
11137,2,0767819519,the cast in this movie is trying to make this movie dramatic and touching but is wasted with bad acting and cheesiness. Michelle Pfeiffer could have done a lot better. Whoopi Goldberg was kinda good in this,960768000,,206,4.594594594594595
11138,3,0767819519,"This movie is two movies really, and that is why it may appear longer than what it is. The first half deals with the loss of a child at a school reunion. The child does not reappear, and the way the family deal with it  is extremely well done.  Pfeiffer portrays the mother who never gets over  the grief extremely well.  The second half of the movie deals with the  family moving to Chicago, and by an amazing twist of fate, stumble across  their son. Naturally it is NOT all roses from here on.  The son is taken  out of the home he is used to, told that he was kidnapped and expected to  fit in to his new family. By this time, I was very sad as I just wanted it  to come together nicely for the family. For awhile the movie seeed to drag,  but it was still watchable.  Fine performances from Treat Williams as the  father who expects everything to fall into place, and as mentioned above, a  great performance from Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother who has to endure so  much pain. I agree with others, it seems like a telemovie only because many  telemovies focus on similar family themes. The movie will promise you this  though: in the blink of an eye, your whole life can change.",958867200,,1185,4.2657657657657655

7788852,4,0767819519,"What I liked about this movie was the very real, deep emotions one sees as we view a tragedy in one family. It was a real challenge to watch this mother so unable to mother her other two children after losing her middle child. Thankfully, unlike so many other parents, their child was recovered. The challenge of seeing them try to fit him back into their life was almost unbearable. The part of Vincent broke my heart. This boy who still has a little boys heart, was just crying out for forgiveness. He admitted his part, finally, in the end, to his little brother's disappearance. Oddly enough at the gathering at the Hotel, the mom was making fun of the woman who actually took her son. The mom and dad remain so far apart emotionally but it was touching to see so many scenes of him loving her with his eyes. Treat Williams is a genius actor. Love him in anything. Michelle Pfeiffer, of course really falls into the part of a mentally ill mother. She seemed that way, to me, from the start. I felt sorry for all of them. I really liked the part where the husband tell her she has made a career of being unhappy but he tries to be happy as much as possible. It made me think. All in all, a sad movie but a movie made from a book. One woman's imagination of what might happen when a child disappears from it's family. I liked that the movie ended well.",1517356800,,1354,4.272373540856031
