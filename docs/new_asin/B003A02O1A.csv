8392717,5,B003A02O1A,"This is great. I started creating mandalas and bought a sketch pad and all types of pens and markers. I have never had an interest in drawing, art or mandalas. Alot of neat ideas come to me and I am so peaceful after. Maybe it's just in my head but I love this video.",1449446400,,267,3.962962962962963

8392720,4,B003A02O1A,"I did buy this DVD from Amazon, but for some reason there are currently 2 product pages for this same DVD, one of which omits the creator's name at the top. So I'm writing this review on the product page that correctly lists Dr. Gibson's name.

This is a 30 minute video. The audio part contains suggestions related to creative thinking which were well spoken by a man with a British accent. The spoken suggestions were things like 'I am always creative.... My intuition helps me.' The main musical instruments were flute, drums and electronic keyboard. The tune was nice but frankly became monotonous because it was the only thing played over and over again for a half hour. No doubt the goal is to become so deeply entranced by the repetition that it doesn't matter, but I think it would have been nicer if similar melodies embedded with theta were added to provide greater variety and a sense of flow.

There were basically three video images, each shown for about ten minutes before moving on to the next image. Each of the three images contained beautiful moving colors giving a sense of motion like moving through a tunnel. They were quite hypnotic and nicely reinforced the audio suggestions that accompanied them.

I have hypnosis CDs by Glenn Harrold and brainwave CDs by Tom Kenyon and Jeffrey Thompson that I can highly recommend. You can search on these names and get their products on Amazon or go to their websites if you are interested. This DVD by Dr. Gibson is my first experience of combined audio and video, and I found it to be interesting and effective. I also highly recommend visiting the website of the Monroe Institute which does ongoing research in these areas and they offer excellent CDs, DVDs and in-house training programs. On Amazon, you can do a search on 'Hemi-sync' and that will display many Monroe products.",1359504000,13,1843,4.735202492211838
