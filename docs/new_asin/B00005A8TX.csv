1412310,5,B00005A8TX,"Never heard of this flick and don't like foreign subtitles? Forget all that rubbish and buy this flat out great gangster film. Before you do, offer a prayer of thanks to Criterion for providing us with a gorgeous digital transfer, and an informative and entertaing interview with the 89 year old director Jules Dassin. This film is a monster, and if you ain't seen it, there's no excuses, now that you've heard it from me and the other lucky viewers. A simple story with tension, twists and the right ending, this film is worthy of repeat viewings. A winner from Dassin and Criterion!",993600000,4,584,4.679611650485437
1412311,4,B00005A8TX,"This is hands-down the best crime film ever made; not because it has the maybe the best heist scene ever (30 minutes of no dialogue), but because of the utter realism of the main characters and the performance of the actors (especially the magnificent Jean Servais, working for peanuts, because he had a bit of a drinking problem at the time, according to Dassin) nailing the total 'amoral modus operandi to immoral function' that makes criminals so endlessly fascinating as archetypes of what goes on in less extreme form and under more hypocritical guise throughout society all the time.
The Criterion DVD is not perfect, some very annoying lines are visible in a couple of chapters, but image depth & detail is as good as any DVD from this period. It's odd that this huge hit & Quentin Tarantino favorite (several things in ""Reservoir Dogs"" are direct modifications of things in ""Rififi"") has been unavailable in any decent home-viewing form for so many years (I've been watching awful video copies for years and very few video stores carried those). The quality of the picture is especially important in this film because the carefully picked neighborhoods in Paris and the other locations outside it where the film was shot are a key ingredient and they literally push it beyond the level of Jacques Becker's classic 1953 film ""Touchez Pas Au Grisbi"" (Honor Among Thieves) starring French macho icon Jean Gabin, which lacks enough location shooing, and inspired Dassin's film in more ways than one (especially since Becker was a friend of Dassin's who went to bat for him in France during the five years he was unemployed in Europe when the long arm of the Hollywood blacklist prevented him from even working over there by refusing to distribute his films in the states). To shoot any film that's supposed to be realistic and not working on a fantastic level like ""Singin in the Rain"" or ""The Red Shoes"" in the studio is to cheapen it irreparably 98 out of a 100 times. Authentic, wordlessly expressive neighborhoods are part and parcel of a 'real' atmosphere and they put it in context.
Dassin got paid very little by the producer of the film who was basically taking advantage of his dire straits to get a cheap director. However, he had asked for a percentage of the gross in his contract, which the producer gave up thinking it would come to nothing anyway. A year later the film was a HUGE HIT and even eventually got distributed in both dubbed and subtitled versionS in the States, and those points made Dassin a lot of money and independent of the blacklist. The film was popular enough to have a hilarious parody of it made by Mario Monicelli called ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" (also on Criterion) starring Marcello Mastroianni, Vittorio Gassman, etc. Dassin himself made a parody to even greater international success with the fantastic and endlessly immitated ""Topkapi"" starring Maximillian Schell, Peter Ustinov, and his wife Melina Mercouri (John Woo and Brian De Palma need to come up with a few new original ideas of their own).
Above and beyond the great film itself, Criterion has included a 30 minute Dassin interview that's maybe the best short interview with a famous Director I've ever seen. At nearly 90 years of age, the guy's still going strong, and tells one great fascinating story after another, stuff more edifying than any 'audio commentary' (who the hell invented that waste of time anyway?) nonsense ever is.
Even though his career was nearly ruined by guys like Kazan and Robert Rossen who decided to 'patriotically' rat on some of these comm[unist] rats that they were sick of seeing weild power in the arts, he makes it obvious by the way he talks about them, that he doesn't bear a grudge against them for almost forcing him to flip burgers for a living, and that he knows the real culprits were the studio heads and politicians who started that witch-hunt business in the first place. ... He did hold a grudge in 1955 though when he himself played the Italian safe-cracker character in ""Rififi"" who gets shot by Jean Servais after he delivers the immortal line ""You know Macaroni...I liked you...but you know what the rules are.""",993427200,2,4170,4.809192200557103

1412313,5,B00005A8TX,"Jules Dassin does have a seat of choice in the gallery of Movie History. The movies he directed in Hollywood in the late forties are now classics and his courage under the Mc Carthy era demands our utmost respect. Exiled in France, he directed RIFIFI aka  "" Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes "" in 1954 based on a S&eacute;rie Noire novel of Auguste le Breton. And it's simply one of the best films noirs ever made.
Jean Servais is perfect as a french Bogart marked by tuberculosis, Robert Hossein, in his first role, terrifying as a drug addict tougher than George Raft and Jules Dassin himself, in the role of an italian bad guy, very convincing. Add a wonderful singing act of Magali Nol, the french starlet of the sixties, the great Alexandre - The Children of Paradise - Trauner as art director and the 30 minutes anthology scene, without musical score nor dialogs, of the robbery and you have a movie you can't neglect if you are a true movie lover.
The copy presented in this Criterion DVD release is definitive and the 25 minutes interview  with Jules Dassin a bonus feature very appreciated. There is also the choice between the french subtitled version and a dubbed version for the lazy ones. How can you still hesitate ! Go, buy and be happy.

1412314,5,B00005A8TX,"This film is probably solely for people interested in the history of film and its development.  Don't get me wrong, it is a great film, but I doubt it is for a general audience of modern viewers.
I have wanted to see this film for many years after having once seen the previews in some theatre when I was very young.  It never played on cable, and was unavailable in any medium (VHS, DVD)....at least when I was looking for it.  So, I am very grateful that Criterion has brought out this beautiful edition.
Having grown up in the 50's I can see why this film was such a sensation.  It is tough and gritty, no nonsense, frank and nonchalant about sex (no one today can know how refreshing that was in 50's America, and how people craved foreign films for that reason among others).  This film takes its place with the great Asphalt Jungle and The Killing (of roughly the same period) about thieves falling-out and meticulous plans coming undone.
Dassin's audacity in filming the robbery sequence without music track or dialogue still looks pretty courageous today.  The robbery itself looks somewhat dated only because it has been copied and elaborated on by so many, including Dassin himself who satarized it in Topkapi.
Like the old Frankenstein, or King Kong, or It Happened One Night, or Stagecoach, or any original genre classic, I enjoy seeing the work of the guy who did it first.  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and Jules Dassin's Rififi has been imitated many times.  I was glad to finally see the original in this pristine copy.
The Criterion DVD is fine.  My copy had no problems with subtitles or anything else, so I don't know what happened with the other reviewer's complaint.  The interview with Dassin is quite good, and will remind the viewer of not only the effects of the blacklist (Dassin was Blacklisted) but also how excellent films can come out of strange and humble origins.
I must mention Jean Servais, the lead in Rififi.  He is simply great, with his gravelly voice and his lived-in face, and his mournful yet tough, been-there-done-that eyes. He is the epitome of a Bogart-like French tough guy.
All in all, a real treat for the discerning viewer.",988588800,11,2187,4.684073107049608
1412315,5,B00005A8TX,"After something of a dry spell, Criterion has finally released a bunch of great DVDs this month.

Its a crime story - its about a quartet of thieves who after pulling off a daring robbery (the robbery itself is an wonderfully extended silent sequence) and it has a lot of the ""late-noir"" ambience that the ""Third Man"" and ""Touch of Evil"" have.

RATING: 3.5 out of 5.0

The director of 'Rififi', Jules Dassin, was down on his luck at the time he was asked to get involved with this gritty film noir. Dassin was a successful American director of film noirs up until the end of the 1940s when he was suddenly blacklisted during the days of the Senator Joe McCarthy witch hunts and barred from working in the United States. Speaking during a 2000 interview featured as part of the Criterion Collection's DVD extras, Dassin remarked that he was paid very little to direct 'Rififi' as the cast and crew also worked under an extremely low budget.

'Rififi' is a very atmospheric film noir, shot intentionally under low light conditions. The plot revolves around a gang of jewel thieves led by Tony ""le Stphanois"" (played by Jean Servais, a successful French actor in the 30s, whose career was in in decline at the time, due to alcoholism). Tony, just out of prison on a five year bid for a prior jewel heist, is approached by former pal, Jo, who proposes that they accept mutual friend Mario's plan to steal some jewels from a window display case of a prominent Parisian jewelry store.

The plan is initially rejected by Tony who is preoccupied with his former girlfriend, Mado, who has taken up with a tough guy nightclub owner, Pierre Grutter. In the first of a number of scenes, craftily infused with a palpable, violent edge, Tony beats Mado up for going with this other guy.

With Mado now out of his life, Tony decides to accept Mario's plan but instead of a simply 'smash-and-grab' of the jeweler's store window, he proposes knocking off a safe in the apartment above the jewelry store. Mario's friend, the Italian-speaking Cesar (played by director Dassin himself) is brought in to complete the team. The gang goes through a rehearsal before committing the crime itself. This mainly involves de-arming the sophisticated alarm system. I'm not sure if we needed all the pre-heist rehearsals, particularly because much of it is repeated during the actual heist itself (I'm thinking particularly of the spraying of the fire retardant foam into the alarm box, which appears to be rather redundant and anti-climactic).

Nonetheless the bulk of the heist scene is particularly noteworthy due to its having been shot without any dialogue. Also quite remarkable is the way in which an umbrella is utilized to prevent the alarm from going off, during the burglary. To my surprise, this was actually based on a crime involving a travel agency break-in, dating back to 1899!

After the heist is committed, the plot takes a few other clever twists and turns. The gang is undone by the simple greed of Cesar, who pilfers a small diamond ring for his girlfriend. Grutter and company get wind of this, and end up murdering Mario and his girlfriend (another shocking scene of violence in the film), in an attempt to extort information from Jo, as to the whereabouts of the very expensive jewels, taken from the jewel company's safe. I wonder why, however, Grutter's gang failed to ransack Mario's apartment, before giving up on trying to find the jewels.

After Tony finds a tied-up Cesar (captured by Grutter), he reluctantly murders him in revenge for violating the 'code of silence' between thieves. It's said that this represented Dassin's feelings toward colleagues who betrayed other colleagues during the blacklist era.

The plot races toward its inevitable conclusion after Grutter kidnaps Jo's son and holds him as ransom for the jewels. Tony tells Jo to sit tight while he tracks down the kid. But Jo can't wait and meets Grutter with the cash they got from a fence for the jewels. Inevitably Grutter kills Jo and is about to make off with the jewels when Tony shows up (somehow Mado had heard that Grutter had swiped Jo's son and knew where he was). With information provided by Mado, Tony indeed tracks Grutter down and after being seriously wounded, shoots and kills Grutter (why Grutter doesn't make sure Tony is dead, before attempting to make his get away), seems a bit far-fetched.

Despite his crimes, Tony performs the great sacrifice by driving Jo's son all the way back home, before he expires, with a suitcase stuffed with millions, in the backseat.

'Rififi' has all the ingredients of an engaging, taut, film noir. Particularly notable is the great on-location cinematography, sure-fire editing, very believable performances by some lesser-known actors as well as director Dassin's determination not to tone down the violent scenes in order to mollify a few prurient filmgoers. 'Rififi' suffers from a few flat notes including the long-winded 'heist rehearsal' as well as a number of (aformentioned) questionable plot contrivances, that don't always add up.

Overall, 'Rififi' is a pretty, solid noir. Jules Dassin was said to have regretted only the use of the song that bore the film's title. Dassin didn't want to use any music at all but was somehow talked into using the out of place song 'Rififi'. The title translates as 'rough and tumble'--a rather trite allusion to the overall atmosphere the film engenders.",1407628800,2,5122,4.9086705202312135
1412356,5,B00005A8TX,"This BD copy of the film is EXCELLENT!  Beautiful picture that shows off the great B&W photography and the soundtrack is great, crisp and clear.  There is a French language soundtrack as well as an English dubbed soundtrack.  Subtitles are also available so you can run it in French with English subs (or vice-verse).  Earlier DVD reviews stated the synchronization of sound and picture was off, NOT the case here and one review complained the subtitles only flashed on the screen for a second, again not the case here.  The bonus interview with Dassin is simply wonderful, I am so glad Criterion did it, it gives insight onto the director, his career and the film.
Without doing an analysis of the film (like all the Siskel & Ebert wannabes), I can say that I really enjoyed this film.  It is a great ""tough-guy"" ""heist"" film that has been imitated and copied so many times parts of it have become cliches (just like things from Citizen Kane).  Reviews have praised the film making, photography and denigrated the treatment of women and macho elements.  These reviews forget it is a MOVIE and depicts a specific group of criminals, not all Frenchmen or women.  Dassin was out to make a good picture on a low budget and succeeded.  The low budget may have helped as it limited the salaries for the actors resulting great choices for the parts (with Dassin playing a part himself) and a crew that really did an excellent job from camerawork to editing.  The film is not too long as some complain but rather allows the characters to develop and give explanation to why certain things are being done.  Some plot twists lend to the overall suspense of the film and the clash of personalities between the characters.  Remembering this in the French underworld in 1955 may help some people understand the film better.

1412403,4,B00005A8TX,"I judge a film mostly by whether or not I enjoyed watching it.

I enjoyed watching Rififi quite a lot, and will probably watch it again.

I liked the suspense, the criminal conspiracy, the atmosphere - all the things that make a movie ""noir"".  I don't think it's the best noir film - I would nominate The Maltese Falcon for that honor.  But Rififi is very good.  (""Rififi"" means ""fisticuff"", or by extension, a fight or a struggle.  A loose translation of ""du Rififi chez les hommes"" would be ""regarding men's little wars ..."")  The heist scene is excellent, as everyone agrees.  The aftermath of the heist is not very credible, but I suppose it's no worse than the end of Hamlet, with bodies strewn all over the place.  We are willing to forgive Shakespeare for his plot weaknesses because of his other strengths, so we can cut Dassin some slack, too.

The acting is excellent, with very good performances from all cast members, with one big exception:  Dassin is not at all credible as an Italian, let alone as a Milanese safe cracker.  His accent is not Italian, and anyway a true Milanese would speak at least some French - perhaps not as fluently as his friend Tony, but enough to get by.  But mostly Dassin just isn't a very good actor.  Everyone else is in role, but he just can't stop being good old Jules Dassin, seeming to say, ""Look at me, aren't I cute, playing an Italian crook in my own movie!""

The Criterion Edition that I watched is an excellent production, as usual.

A comment about the liner notes by Jamie Hook, leading to some other comments about Dassin and Communism.  I quote Hook:  ""... his career had been ruthlessly strangled by the obsessive hand of the paranoiac House of [sic] Un-American Activies Committee.  Named as a communist, he fled to Europe ... ""  No, he wasn't ""named as"" a Communist, he WAS a Communist, in the late 1930's, along with many other American intellectuals.  He at least had the good sense to leave the Communist Party in 1939 because of the Hitler-Stalin Pact, unlike many of his contemporaries.  HUAC did a lot of damage to some fairly harmless people, but Stalin's Communist Party's infiltration of the organs of American public opinion formation wasn't just a figment of HUAC's imagination - it was a deliberate strategy designed to facilitate an eventual Communist revolution in this country.  It's all in the KGB archives, for those who are interested.

The fact that Dassin was blacklisted was a hardship for him, but at the same time it forced him out from under the thumb of the Hollywood machine into a position of artistic independence and allowed him to make some pretty good films.  And HUAC's persecution was inconceivably mild compared to that visited on Soviet artists like Pasternak and Solzhenytsin, to provide some perspective.  Self-exile to France vs. a Siberian Gulag?  I think I would take France any day.

I apologize for this digression into 20th century history, but Dassin's fans have made his blacklisting an issue.  It is certainly an important fact in Dassin's life, but in my opinion it has very little bearing on his art, which stands on its own.

With all its faults, Rififi is a film worth watching more than once, especially in the Criterion Edition.

1412404,5,B00005A8TX,"Stories about safe crackers, con men, and cat burglars have always been a popular ticket, and such films as the 1950 THE ASPHALT JUNGLE certainly paved the way, but it wasn't until the 1955 RIFIFI that the heist movie really exploded as a genre.  Based on a portion of the French novel DU RIFIFI CHEZ LES HOMMES and written and directed by Jules Dassin, RIFIFI is particularly famous for the fact that the entire heist sequence is performed without any dialogue.  The silence heightens the tension in an extraordinary way.

Tony (Jean Servais) is only recently out of prison on a theft charge.  Disillusioned and embittered, he declines to become involved in a smash-and-grab theft planned by friends Jo and Mario (Carl Mohner and Robert Manuel); after he has a brutal meeting with former lover Mado (Marie Sabouret), however, he envisions a much more elaborate robbery of the same store.  The plan requires the team to cut through the ceiling into the store, defeat a complex alarm system, and break into a safe to get at the jewels.  The latter requires an expert, and the team involves Cesar (Dassin, who stepped into the role when the original actor withdrew.)  The planning is meticulous.  Nothing can go wrong.

Can it?

Shot on a miniscule budget in black and white and without major stars, RIFIFI was an unexpected smash.  It was also controversial.  Not only did it contain some then-steamy sexual content, many felt it was a detailed lesson in how to knock over a jewelry store, and the film was actually banned in Mexico when several robberies seemed to imitate the process involved.  It also won the Best Director award for Dassin at the Cannes Film Festival, a fact that did much to reclaim his reputation after he had been blacklisted by the American film industry several years earlier.

RIFIFI sparked a host of imitators, but few followed in the same norish mode.  Films such as HOW TO STEAL A MILLION, GAMBIT, OCEAN'S 11, and even THE STING were really more comedy than heist, and even Dassin himself turned the genre into the satirical TOPKAPI.  Whatever the case, RIFIF (the word translates more or less as ""trouble"") has held its own for more than half a century, engaging and unsettling audiences with its mixture of crime, brutality, and sexual tension ... not to mention that famously nerve-wracking thirty-two minute sequence without dialogue of any kind.  There seem to be several versions available on DVD.  I suggest the Criterion release, which has very good visual and aural elements and which includes a notable interview with Jules Dassin himself. Recommended.

1412405,5,B00005A8TX,"His name is misleading. It sounds French, but Jules Dassin was an American filmmaker. And not a bad job Jules Dassin did in directing this low budget film, not bad for a blacklisted director who so couldn't get work in the States he had to go overseas to ply his craft. In 1955, after five years of not working, he got the nod to helm RIFIFI, a French heist picture so successful it immediately revived his career.

Rififi is a French slang of which English translation is hard to pin down. I guess the closest one gets to it is Magali Nol who plays ""Viviane"" in the movie and who, while singing the title track, refers to ""rififi"" defined as ""rough n' tumble."" In any case, RIFIFI is one of the greatest and influential heist films in world cinema. Echoes of its style and grit and themes can be detected in just about every heist film since, from Dassin's other acclaimed caper film, TOPKAPI (1964), to Soderbergh's remake of OCEAN'S ELEVEN (2001) to THE ITALIAN JOB (2003).

RIFIFI (original French title: Du Rififi chez les hommes) is impressively atmospheric and noirish. It is a nerve-jangler, an edge-of-your-seater. It introduces the stone-faced Tony ""le Stphanois"" (Jean Servais), an ex-con who'd just got done serving a five year stretch. Except this isn't the sort of film in which the sinner stays on the straight and narrow. Tony initially rejects an offer to take part in a jewelry heist but then later changes his mind. Dassin's virtuoso filmmaking inexorably hooks us in, from its stark look at a crew of small-time French crooks to its near lyrical depiction of the Parisian streets at dawn. We're shown each step of the heist, from casing the joint to testing the imposing alarm to the detailed execution of the crime, of which haul is worth 240 million. Keep an eye out for an unforgettable 24-minute sequence, absent of score and dialogue, that tracks the execution of the heist. It's the undisputed highlight of the film.

Jules Dassin himself gets in on the acting. When the actor selected to play the Italian safecracker became unavailable, Dassin elected to take on the role under the screen name ""Perlo Vita."" And Perlo Vita was great. The performances are across-the-board great.

And then because it's that kind of film, we're kept glued to the screen, post-heist, as this and that indiscretion work towards a falling out amongst thieves. Jean Servais's character is the central protagonist and it's tough roads trying to gauge how hard you should sympathize with him. Tony ""le Stphanois"" is a hard man adhering to an unforgiving code. What he later does to a partner-in-crime is harsh but just in his world of noncompromise. It's also Dassin's not-too-subtle jab at those in Hollywood who were willing to sell out their contemporaries in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. No one likes a rat. Anyway, RIFIFI. A masterful piece of cinema, taut and gritty and brilliant and tragically evocative. Poetry in grime.",1357862400,,2956,4.847524752475247
1412406,4,B00005A8TX,"Recently I went out of my way to honor the French cinematic crime noir tradition in reviewing Jean Gabin's Touchez Pas au Grisbi, a film right out of the Hollywood gangster shoot-em-up and ask questions later genre.  The film under review, Rififi, reflects another French cinematic homage to a different aspect of that tradition, the well-planned (almost) heist saga. In fact, given the approximately one half hour depiction of the heist itself, I would argue that it more than put paid to that homage. Maybe the fact that the film was directed by American red scare black-listed director Jules Dassin was key to those dramatic, skillful and realistic scenes. While reading his Marx in the morning Dassin, maybe, spent a few afternoons at the local two films for the price of one movie theaters of the day watching, intensely watching those heist scenes.

So, as I have already telegraphed,, this one revolves around a heist, a big jewel heist, naturally at an almost impossible to bust, high tech (for the day) protected establishment. Of course to take on such a risky task you either have to be very smart (street smart) or desperate, or both. Enter one Tony, just out of stir, with no prospects, no dough, and no pension (occupational hazard of the profession). And with about seven chips on his shoulder, number one chip being two-timed (who knows maybe more) by his woman. (Ya, I know, two-timing women, and the crazy way they turn smart (street smart) guys goofy in the plot lines of crime noirs, are a dime a dozen.) Tony is ready though to go for the brass ring. And he grabs it, almost.

See, while two-timing women may be a dime a dozen, two-timing women who take up with rival boss gangsters and live to tell about it, are not. So said rival boss gangster, once he cops to the fact that our Tony has ""scored"" is ready to move heaven and earth to get the jewels, and get them cheap. Cheap? Ya, easy, just kidnap one of the heist guys' kids and that will have them squealing and handing over jewels ASAP. Well no, not at all. Remember Tony is not going back to stir, no way. And come hell or high water he is not leaving his buddy (and his buddy's wife) in the lurch. Without giving the whole thing away let's just put it this way, Hollywood or Paris, film wise anyway, crime does not pay. RIP Tony.",1338422400,,2309,4.545673076923077
1412407,5,B00005A8TX,"I knew nothing about this film before sitting down to watch it and chose it largely because it was filmed in Paris in the 1950s - what I hoped for was lots of atmospheric, ""period piece"" shots of the city - what I got was lots of atmospheric, ""period piece"" shots of the city and... one of the best thrillers I've ever seen.

Everything about it - the wonderfully grey almost malevolent street shots, the excellent understated acting, and the superbly edited black & white photography - builds tension. But what makes it genuinely gripping is the stunningly effective, virtually silent 30 minute sequence that follows in meticulous detail the execution of the ""perfect crime"". From the moment the sequence starts, and even though you know it's got to go horribly wrong because ""crime doesn't pay"", certainly in the 50s, you'll be transfixed. Sure, the film suffers from too much of the typical 1950s ""gangster movie"" stereotyping but these weaknesses are quickly forgiven and forgotten because the plot is just so good. And, of course, backing it all up are as many brilliantly filmed, highly atmospheric ""period piece"" shots of the city as you could hope for.",1329350400,3,1160,4.888324873096447
1412408,5,B00005A8TX,"I love the heist movie genre and enjoy weaker films in this catagory like Seven Thieves and the original Oceans Eleven.  The really great heist movies are few and far between and Rififi ranks along side The Asphalt Jungle, The Red Circle and maybe a very few others like Thief.  If I were backed into a corner and had to choose I would put Rififi right at the top.  Sure, the silent heist is impressively done; yet, what impresses me most is the vibrancy and uniqueness of the the characters, the magnificent acting from a very inexpensive cast, and the grey forboding look of Paris.  This is not Gigi lol.

The last 10 minutes minutes may be the best edited and most suspenseful piece of film I have ever seen.............It is amazing.  Highest recommendation.",1328572800,,762,4.649253731343284
1412409,3,B00005A8TX,"The legendary wordless heist is pretty good. The silence isn't driven by any need within the story for most of its duration, but it's cool nonetheless. The characters are well defined and the story plugs along well until the end with a final segment that doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all and seems stylistically out of place.",1323993600,,333,4.566666666666666
1412410,5,B00005A8TX,"""Rififi,"" (Du rififi chez les homes), (1955) is a riveting thriller, the granddaddy of all heist/caper movies, and another triumph of French cinema.  But the black and white crime drama, French language film was scripted and helmed by an American, Jules Dassin, rather than a Frenchman, and thereby, of course, hangs the tale.  For Dassin, a victim of America's 1950s McCarthyism and the Hollywood Blacklist that McCarthyism spawned, went on to win Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival for this cerebral noir caper, and, eventually, to be able to return as a welcome hero to Hollywood.

In a brisk, no second wasted, exciting 118 minutes, we follow Tony le Stephanois (Jean Servais) as, after his recent release from five years in prison, he plans one last perfect heist: to hit the internationally famous then and now jewelry store Mappin & Webb. To do so, he gathers criminals Jo le Swedois (the Swede-- Carl Mhner), Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel) and Cesar le Milanese - (the Milanese, Jules Dassin himself, who grew a moustache and took a screen name to play the part: contract difficulties had cost the director the actor originally expected to play it).  Tony finds his former lover Mado les Grands Bras (Marie Sabouret) who has become the lover of the gangster Pierre Grutter (Marcel Lupovici), owner of the night club L'Age D'Or, where she works. Unfortunately, human error does them in in this dark, understated tale: Cesar foolishly gives a priceless ring from the loot to another girl Viviane (Magali Noel, a great French/Italian favorite at the time) who works at Mado's club. The three Grutter brothers quickly figure out the story and demand some of the loot.  Tony refuses.  The competing gangsters retaliate by kidnapping Jo's five-year old son.

Somehow, Dassin put all this together on a miserly budget, even then, of $200,000.  To do so, he had to skimp on his cast.  Servais, once a big French star, had not worked for several years because of his severe alcoholism; luckily, the toll his alcoholism had taken on his face could easily be seen as the toll of five years of prison life.  Several of the other actors, and of the behind-the camera personnel, had also not worked for several years for various reasons; some of them were green beginners.  (Of course, Dassin himself had not worked for a while, due to the Blacklist.)  Dassin filmed on the actual streets of Paris -- he couldn't afford back lot sets, and he and his camera traveled all over that beautiful city.  He did, however, have to build a false caf in the middle of the road, so that Stephanois and his gang could sit ""across the street"" from Mappin and Webb to plan the job.  (M. Webb apparently did really live over his store at that time; he agreed to let them make the film there, although Dassin says he thought the shop owner never would.  But there's nothing so priceless as free worldwide publicity.)  The director insisted on filming only on damp, overcast days, to establish his mood; that nearly drove his centime-counting producer crazy, Dassin says.  The streets, the vehicles, the clothes and the interiors, are all, of course, perfect for the era, and I loved the pinstriped suits and hats the gangsters all wore: well, of course, that was ""de rigueur"" for gangster pictures at the time.

The movie is most famous, of course, for its extraordinary, silent 30-minute burglary scene, now many times imitated but still the greatest.  Dassin explained it by saying the burglars were professionals: they didn't need to talk.  This silent scene is 1/3 the film's running time.  There isn't even music:  Georges Auric, the greatly talented French composer who did the score thought perhaps there should be, and wrote the music.  But after Dassin showed him the picture with and without, Auric agreed with the director that the scene should be silent.  This scene, to me, graphically showed how physically difficult the burglary was: the men carried suitcases of tools in and worked at the burglary for several very sweaty hours.  On the other hand, you also could say the scene was  a primer in how to burglarize a store, and, according to the director, the film's scene was imitated in actual burglaries several times - so much so, that Mexico insisted the picture be withdrawn there after playing for eleven weeks.  Look closely at the men's footwear during this crucial scene.  Several of the men are wearing sneakers, surely footwear they never would have been seen in on the street, and Cesar is actually wearing ballet shoes.

The level of detail throughout the picture is remarkable: at the beginning, we see Jo the Swede get up from a couch where he's been playing with his son. Jo's leg has fallen asleep, and he briefly limps.  Many of the son's toys are shown in all their cuteness.  Viviane was given a specially-written song at the night club - then anyway, a scene also ""de rigueur"" in gangster films--so that she could tell the audience what ""rififi,"" a word from Parisian argot--slang--meant.  Rough and tumble, apparently: roughhousing, rough trade.  No character in the movie ever utters the word.  The movie was ostensibly based on a novel of the same name, written in deepest Parisian argot, so that few people--not Dassin either--could understand it.  But Dassin hardly used the novel, which he characterized as nasty - including necrophiliac scenes; and racist, with the villains Arab North Africans (the director changed them to French, with Germanic names).

The ending of the film is as memorable as they come.  I've always wondered whether the child's obstreperous behavior there, as he wears a cowboy costume and shoots his fake six-shooter, was intended by Dassin as a comment on recent American behavior.  The director had not worked for five years in Hollywood, due to his blacklisting, and hostile forces, including Clare Booth Luce, then the ambassador to Italy, well-known playwright, and wife of Henry Luce of Time magazine, took away a proposed Italian movie from him.  The great French communist director Jacques Becker is said to have helped Dassin to get RIFIFI.  Becker was soon to make his own gangland masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Touchez-Pas-au-Grisbi-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0006HC0I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Touchez Pas au Grisbi - Criterion Collection</a>, which resembles Dassin's film in several ways; not least that Becker was able to afford that great French star Jean Gabin, because his career had been in decline for several years.

Cinematic craftsmanship at its most compelling, this DVD benefits from the excellent production standards of Criterion and adds an illuminating interview with Dassin himself, as well as an  item entitled ""Production Notes"" that tells as much about the shameful McCarthy years as about this particular film. I found it interesting that several of the relatively unknown actors who appeared in Rififfi also joined Dassin in his very next movie: He Who Must Die.

The archetype of all caper films arrives on DVD from the esteemed Criterion Collection.  If you have never seen this film, or only recall it as a washed-out, scratchy print, you will be stunned -- not only at its beauty, but also with the mesmerizing story of four thugs who plan one last heist.  The film, shot in and around an often shimmering, wet Paris at night, has a naturalistic, almost documentary feel that perfectly evokes the moral ambiguity of the postwar period.  The famous set piece in the middle of the film is an almost silent, dialogue free, 34-minute break-in.  Dark humor, unbearable tension and betrayal abound in this fable about four bad guys who meet much worse guys. Dassin himself plays Italian safecracker Ceasar le Milanais (in the credits he's listed as Perlo Vita).

At the end of the 1940s, Jules Dassin fled America because of the blacklist.  Exiled in Paris with his family, he soon became desperate for work.  But when he attempted to direct films for European companies, he was told Hollywood would block their distribution in the U.S.  When his French agent sent him, ""Rififi,"" Auguste le Breton's crime thriller, he tried to read it, but couldn't understand a word -- it was written in an argot that made no sense even though Dassin spoke fluent French. Finally he asked his agent to come over and read it aloud and translate as he went.  However, when Dassin understood the story, he hated it.  But it was a solid offer to write and direct -- alas at a ridiculously low budget.  Dassin wrote the screenplay quickly.  During a meeting with le Breton, the novelist put a pistol on the table and said, ""I read your screenplay.  Where's my novel?""  Dassin loved him for that tough guy gesture.  They became fast friends and le Breton worked on shaping the trez authentic dialogue.

By the time the movie was presented at the Cannes Film Festival, Dassin was again broke.  In a casino, the producer was throwing his money around and Dassin asked for a few dollars so he too could have some fun.  The producer handed him some money.  Dassin was about to bet on a roulette number when he asked the producer what was the first day of production.  The producer told him and Dassin put all his money on that number and won.  He and his family lived on those winnings for almost a year!  Dassin also won Best Director for his film and the movie became an international hit.  In French slang, rififi mean ""rough 'n tumble.""

The superb DVD transfer with fully restored sound and picture (23,235 pieces of dirt removed or scratches repaired) as well as a newly-improved English subtitle translation makes this about as perfect as a film can be.  The bonus material includes a riveting interview with Jules Dassin (who died in 2008 at the age of 96).  From Criterion.

1412415,2,B00005A8TX,"I have decided to re-watch this movie recently with a friend who has not seen it.  I remembered from years ago that the film impressed highly, with its silent scene, of course, and the suspense.

But as it went on this time, I found it incredibly long and boring, also moralizing in somewhat naive sense - that crime is futile, all bandits die at the end.  Thus, it's not even realistic, while it's certainly made in that style. Of course, it's worth watching for its past merits, Jules Dassin (the father of the famous singer), and so on, but what is its value for a modern viewer?

It seems it can be used as an advertisement by cell phone industry - 'WHAT A HORRIBLE LIFE WITHOUT THE iPhone' - could be one header;

And secondly, it reinforces a stereotype that French women adore male brutality; the more she is abused, the more she is ready to serve.  ""Story of R"" could be another title as well.  The scene of the whipping is so pathetic, and devalues the hero's presumed masculinity - is whipping a woman the only thing he could do to her in the bedroom?

1412418,5,B00005A8TX,"It's a mystery to me as to why I haven't caught up to this masterful 50s caper film - turned brooding noir until now, but I'm certainly glad to report that it didn't disappoint.  I haven't seen any of Jules Dassin's American films for several years but based on this I'll probably be going back and re-watching BRUTE FORCE and THE NAKED CITY quite soon.  However much the blacklist hurt Dassin's life and psyche, it certainly didn't inhibit his abilities as a director - though he wasn't always able to get the pieces all in order and achieve masterpieces like RIFIFI.

Tony (Jean Servais, a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its hardness and coldness), has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films (hey, there wouldn't be a story otherwise) isn't coping well with the straight life.  An opportunity presents itself:  an easy multi-million-dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men.  The taut filming of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what people most remember about the film of course, and indeed it's pretty remarkable; but I liked the half-completed location of the final shootout, once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves; the excellent portrayal gritty sides of Paris in stark black and white; and Servais' channeling of both Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart in his spare but brutal performance.

Perhaps it's a bit too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn't exactly deep or thought-provoking; George Auric's at turns modernist, romantic, and jazzy score is another highlight.  And for myself - a huge fan of both Fritz Lang and certain more romantic noir specialists like Max Ophuls - the handling of the world-weary Servais as he goes to his obvious doom is quite moving and powerful, ""realistic"" or not.",1260489600,,2009,4.6875
1412419,5,B00005A8TX,"If you came into the theater during the last five minutes of this film, you would see a 5-year-old with a toy six-shooter pretending to be an American cowboy while circling the Arc de Triomphe in a convertible driven by a cooperative chauffeur.  The scene would be highly misleading--but on second thought, maybe not.  There's a lot about ""Rififi"" that captures the first joy of watching movies at those Saturday matinees that were the highlight of every child's week.

Were it not for the humiliation and beating of a woman who had proven unfaithful to her lover (Tony, played by Jean Servais) during his prison time (he's a professional thief), we might assume this is a comic caper film.  After the exhilarating, protracted safe-cracking in the middle of the film, the director sets up a mis en scene and cutting sequence identical to that in the climax of John Huston's ""The Maltese Falcon,"" in which the thieves sit around the table salivating at the thought they are about to uncover the ""real"" Maltese Falcon.  But this time there is no Humphrey Bogart, and the weighted sack turns out to be the real deal--priceless jewels.  Even the flim's ceaselessly grim-looking protagonist, Tony, offers the barest trace of a smile.

But soon the fun comes to a screeching halt, as the house of cards falls apart one by one.  The thief whose specialty is safe-cracking (played by Jules Dassin, the film's director) cracks himself when he can't resist the temptation to go back for that one extra jewel, a ring, which he then gives to a girl friend, who's the ""property"" of a rival gang.  At this point the story becomes as ""moral"" as ""The Maltese Falcon"" (Amazon's prefatory commentary equating the tale with ""nihilism"" is ridiculous), exposing the self-destructive consequences of those who can't control their greed--or the childish impulses that lead make-believe cowboys to become grown-up hoodlums.  It's just a matter of time before the last man standing (out of seven) expires at the moment of the film's completion (appropriate, since the last survivor, Tony, is director of the heist, just as Dassin is director of the film).

But such a summary does the film a huge injustice.  ""Rififi"" has an ingredient lacking in the tightly-scripted, ultra-efficient, supremely-acted ""Maltese Falcon"": breath-taking visual composition, editing, and style that are a sheer joy to watch throughout.  Moreover, it's cinematic spectacle that allows the viewer to become a participant in the ""back-stage"" action--the collaborative process so essential to the power of cinema itself.

Above all, it is the robbery of the jewelry shop that is analogous to filmmaking--from the collaborating it entails, to the specialties required, not to mention the hard work, the self-control and discipline, the tensions and uncertainties about the outcome, the ultimate triumph.

For the film's protagonist and director of the intricate operation, Tony, that is enough.  Each of the other thieves has a grand plan for what he will do with his share of the take (which, like the profits of commercial filmmaking after the middle man's cut, is drastically diluted by the need to go through a fence specialist).  But when the question is finally put to Tony, his response is: ""I dunno.""  Then he adds, ""the risk was worth it.""

Of course, apart from the process itself, great movies have meaning, and ""Rififi"" makes its points unmistakably clear--about the roots of greed and gangsterism (and, for those familiar with the director's previous political life in America, loyalty and betrayal).  The best films, moreover, are at their core an imitation of life, and ""Rififi"" individualizes its characters, its hoodlums, its scenes and activities with vivid verisimilitude.  Even the female characters run the gamut, challenging some film stereotypes-from the victimized house wife/mother to the gang moll willing to risk her life (and pay for it) to the night club chanteuse (who plays out the rififi--i.e. rough, dangerous living--that she will soon unwittingly unleash by accepting the ring as a ""fake"") to the aforementioned beaten woman whose presence of mind hatches the clever ploy that will ultimately lead to the rival's location and the final shoot-out.

The cineastes, or film academics, would have you believe that in French filmmaking of the 1950s, it's the ""new wave"" directors who matter.  But Jules Dassin makes the filmmaking of Godard's ""Breathless"" or of Francois Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player"" or of Alain Resnais' ""Last Year at Marienbad"" all look like the work of amateurs (which it is).  Not only is Dassin a more gifted, ""professional"" director, capable of employing light and shadow and Hollywood ""classique decoupage"" to perfection, but he engages the spectator more completely in the magic of cinema.  Andre Bazin may not have known it, but Dassin is the most deserving French ""auteur"" of the period.  More than any other director, he puts into play what the French philosopher, Roland Barthes, would later describe as the ""juoissance"" of the text.

1412420,5,B00005A8TX,"This forerunner New Wave film shines a beam into the underworld of Paris in the early 1950's. Filmed in black and white, in clubs, streets, alleys and crummy smoke filled flats and back rooms, the viewer catches a fading glimpse of this city at the end of one era, on the brink of another.

A band of case hardened thieves and night crawlers and their weary, fish eye ring leader,played by Jean Servais,recently out of prison, conspire just one last time to knock over a very high end jewelry store in Paris.

Rififi breaks into new film territory by daring to include a long period in the movie with virtually no dialogue whatsoever as the thieves carry out their break in with painstaking detail.

Right from the beginning there is a sad foreboding and yet also a tense fascination as we watch them carry out their plan, complete with their own set of street-wise code of ethics. A sense of fatalism hovers over each character. In the end our stone cold leader, musters up a gutsy act of gallantry and love. The film's final scene of redemption adds another dimension to what would be an entirely predictable existentialist saga.",1239494400,,1131,4.673366834170854

I feel sorry for the ""film studies"" students who must endure this movie and write silly, politically correct essays on its ""message.""

This is hardly surprising as French contributed a great deal to existentialism with Jean-Paul Sartre declaring that ""All human actions are equivalent and all are on principle doomed to failure"" back in 1940's. How true. Of course later on Sartre developed this further with ""L'enfer, c'est les autres"" which is often translated as ""Hell is other peoples pretentious movies"", which is also very true.

""Rififi"" is one of the better French movies and the single reason for that is the absolutely amazing scene of a jewelry store heist. It is quite long, shot in a documentary style and completely lacks any audio accommodations. Towards the end of it one feels as being part of the crew that just pulled it off.

I don't believe the director intended to, but the movie is quite educational in potentially penitentiary aspects - I didn't expect to learn how to crack open a bank safe when I set out watching this story, but now I feel I could do that if needed, not that I ever intent to.

A minor technical point is that audio seems to be may be 1 sec or so behind, this could be a DVD transfer issue.

There is a crime that is planned and executed in suspenseful and interesting detail.  There are the real bad guys that are pretty unappealing (compared to our ""good"" bad guys with their humane and humorous qualities).

There is excellent cinematography and editing throughout, too, which is compounded by the wonderful performances of all actors. The ""fab four"" of criminals are top-notch, but even the supporting players are great, including Robert Hossein (later a star in the Angelique series), a drug-addict brother of the main character Tony's arch enemy and Magali Noel, who went on to become one of Fellini's muses, like in ""Amarcord"".

1412427,5,B00005A8TX,"Or vice-versa.

This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by Hollywood thanks to HUAC.  The premise of the story is rather familiar--one last jewel heist for Tony le Stephanois and his buds--and so is the ending with everybody getting...  Well, no spoilers here, for sure, since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important.

Dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of Paris using actors and actresses who are not glamourous.  The engaging--sometimes intruding--score by Georges Auric nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from American film noirs from the forties and early fifties.  Jean Servais plays the hardcore, consumptive lead in a fedora much as Humphrey Bogart might have played him.  Tony's recently out of prison, past his prime, but still tough and decisive when he has to be, his mind still sharp when focused, the kind of anti-hero whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall.

Dassin plays the Italian safecracker and would-be ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless.

In film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys.  Often there are levels of bad guys, the ""good"" bad guys we are identifying with and the ""bad"" bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys, and then maybe there's a really bad, bad bad guy or two.  (Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a slightly sadistic druggie.)  Then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so.  In more modern film noir the bad guys are not even ""good"" bad guys, and they get away with it or something close to that.  In the old film noir, which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties, the usual motto, following the old Hollywood ""code,"" was ""Crime Doesn't Pay,"" with every criminal having to pay for his or her crime before the end of the movie.

Probably the most impressive feature of Rififi is how nicely the film moves along.  The plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly much the way the great film directors always did it, directors like Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle, and the best of Hitchcock.  Some have actually compared this to Kubrick's The Killing (1956) and suggest that Kubrick stole a little.  Well, directors always steal if need be, and there are some perhaps telling similarities, such as it being ""one last heist"" for the protagonist, and having the girl gum up the works.  The similarities may go deeper because as this film was nearing its end I suddenly thought, oh, no! the suitcase in the back seat is going to fly out of the convertible, hit the ground, burst open, and all the money is going to fly into the air!  Those of you who have seen The Killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film!  Which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money: Oliver Stone's U Turn (1997) starring Sean Penn.  There the money in his backpack gets blown to smithereens by a shotgun blast.  Ha, ha, ha!

Getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue (when there is some: the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue, about 30 minutes worth) is terse and easy to follow requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles, which, by the way, are quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out.

One other thing: all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film, that is off camera.  A guy gets his throat slit.  We don't see it.  I kind of like this approach.  We don't have to see the gore.  You could almost let your kids see Rififi--almost.

Catch this one now and be on the lookout for a Hollywood reprise starring Al Pacino and directed by Harold Becker coming out next year in which you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played out in full.",1165363200,,3938,4.5354107648725215

Although the caper goes as planned, other elements of the underworld get wind of it and move in to steal the proceeds, kidnapping the young son of one of the conspirators.  This is a gritty crime story with wonderful black and white photography.  There are really no good guys here.  Le Stphanois, whom we see whipping his unfaithful girlfriend with a belt in one scene, is sympathetic only by comparison with the characters who do not follow the code of honor among thieves, which is the only moral standard in the world that director Jules Dassin has created.

I remove one star for the extended 28-minute scene detailing the break-in, which many hail as the heart of the film.  Although the scenes in which they plan the crime and study the alarm system are fascinating, watching every moment of the jewel robbery was, for me, as dull as watching guys work on a car, and I literally dozed off.

1412429,4,B00005A8TX,"As far as I am concerned, this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is Paris, France; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog.

Both make this movie a bit unique, at least to English-speaking film noir fans. Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a European film. Initially, I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, once that silent segment started - the actual heist (you already know what's it about), the film picked up considerably and just got better and better.

In fact, I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist. The best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography. This is what makes the disc worth owning. It's excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen Paris...and this is Paris in the mid 1950s. There are lots of bleak-but-interesting rain-soaked Paris streets and buildings I found fascinating to view. In fact, there were many more of those great shots than of London in the much better known film, The Third Man.

1412432,5,B00005A8TX,"This review is for the 2001 Criterion DVD.

Jean Servais stars as Tony le Stphanois, a recently paroled convict living in Paris who decides to pull off an incredible jewelry heist by teaming up with his nephew Jo and several others including Milanais, played by director Jules Dassin.  The planning is meticulous and brilliant.  Stphanois also has a score to settle with a lowlife club owner named Grutter who shamelessly exploited his wife while Tony was in prison.  This sets up the rest of the movie for one of filmmaking's most captivating robbery scenes with an incredibly climatic aftermath.

Even though this is a French movie with English subtitles, it was a very easy film to follow based on the actions and emotions of the characters.  At first it looked like it was going to be a lot like ""The Aspalt Jungle"" but went into a completely different direction with a gutch-wrenching segment involving a ""minor character"" in the plot (sorry I won't spoil it).  What I also enjoyed was the energy and charisma of the characters plus using ageless Paris as a backdrop for this noir movie.  The nightclub acts in this film were also very unique and entertaining and the jewelry heist was also original, lasting for at least 20-25 minutes without a single word being spoken.  The robbery also used some innovative ideas for accessing the safe and jewels.  Finally, there is an emotionally charged scene near the end with some very original film editing.

A nice bonus added on the DVD by Criterion is a 2000 interview with director Jules Dassin with very informative and at times humorous antedotes.  Of course Dassin was blacklisted from Hollywood and was in France out of work and flat broke.  Fortunately, someone convinced him to make this movie, which was based on a French book and he did it on a shoe-string budget with either has-been actors or unknowns.  The rest is history and arguably his best film.

The DVD B&W picture quality is near pristine and the sound is extremely good for a 50 year old film.  Criterion did another splendid job with this production.  If you love post World War II noir movies, you won't be disappointed.

The plot was based on a meticulously conceived and flawlessly executed jewel heist masterminded by Tony le Stephanois played by the haggard looking Jean Servais.  The film is highlighted by a lengthy scene where the four man team works to secure entrance to the jewelry store in total silence.  Tension mounts as their predetermined time limit becomes exceeded and local shops are beginning to open for business.  Local police patrols become suspicious when they discover a car stolen by the gang outside the store.

The gang makes a clean getaway however Cesar la Milanais the safecracker played by Jules Dassin himself, decides to help himself to a ring not part of the booty in the safe.

I wonder which came first: The Killing or Rififi? Anyway, both films have since been imitated hugely, not least by Tarantino. Watching Rififi for the umpteenth time, there are a number of plot flaws --- and so there are in The Killing. It would be tedious to list them, but they become noticeable the more familiar you get with the story. The first time, they don't bother you so much. The similarities between these heist films doesn't end with the detailed planning and execution: they include the detailed presentation of the private lives of the gangsters --- which comes out strongest in Tarantino. That is, crooks live and talk, have the same worries and seem to think like the rest of us. They just have a different line of work. To be frank, I didn't think Servais, the anti-hero, did too good a job as an actor, since he looked exactly the same in every shot. Still, perhaps that's the way he was directed. Dassin was very good in his part. In the end, however, it boils down to: Was this film memorable? And the answer is, Yes.

1412437,5,B00005A8TX,"This movie may seem a bit familiar to modern audiences, even those that have never seen or heard of it.  That's because ""Rififi"" is the ur-heist movie, the prototype for dozens if not hundreds of caper movies over the years.  First, a target for the heist is identified.  Second, the team is assembled.  Third, intricate preparations are made.  Fourth, the actual heist is performed.  Fifth, everything goes horribly wrong.  You've seen this a hundred times before - but never with the sincerity and energy of this original.

The actual heist is 30 minutes long and plays almost completely silent.  I had no idea of that until I read the production notes after watching the movie.  That chunk of the movie is so well shot and acted, and so compelling, that it just doesn't get boring - an amazing achievement.  It just doesn't seem like it's 30 minutes long.

Unlike much of French cinema of similar vintage, which to my mind meanders endlessly and indulges in faux-arty navel gazing, ""Rififi"" has plot aplenty and interesting characters.  If you do not particularly care for French cinema, you may love this movie anyway, because it is definitely different from the French art-house fare of the period.

1412438,5,B00005A8TX,"RIFIFI opens with a card game.  Cigars, cigarettes and smoke fill the air.  Beat fedoras shade tired eyes that rest uneasily over puffy flesh.  RIFIFI is a crime thriller, a heist movie made in France in 1955 by Hollywood blacklisted director Jules Dassin.  It's about the planning, execution, and unraveling of the perfect crime.

  Jean Servais plays the weary and tubercular Tony le Stphanois, the brains of the outfit.  RIFIFI was shot mostly on location in Paris.  Its Paris is a city of overcast skies, rainy nights, slick streets and pools of reflected light. Tony and his gang - Carl Mhner as Jo le Suedois, Robert Manuel as Mario Ferrati and director Dassin as Cesar le Milanais - meticulously (florist delivers outside the jewelry store at 5:50 am every morning) plan the job.  With a little luck nothing can go wrong.

  The robbery itself is, famously, played out in its full 30 minutes without dialogue or musical underscore.  It shouldn't work as well as it does, and anybody without the total control Dassin had on the film probably wouldn't get away with it, but it's a gripping chunk of film.  Heist movies that obsess over the crime, and this one goes into great plan-and-execution detail, can draw the audience into the object of their obsession, which this one does relentlessly.  Of course, few things are perfect, especially crimes, and the third act details what happens when a good crime goes bad.

  I was a little hesitant about a French crime thriller, especially one fifty years old.  The French were great fans of Hollywood urban crime movies of the forties, but flattery aside, imitation usually leaves you lonesome for that which is being imitated.  RIFIFI had me hooked after the first couple of minutes and held my attention throughout.  It's smart, carries more than its share of surprises, and makes great use of Paris locations.

  The film is in very good condition.  Also included on the dvd is a half-hour 2000 video interview with director Jules Dassin.  The interview contains much reminiscence on his career, or lack of same, after he was blacklisted by Hollywood in the 1950s.

While I liked the safe-cracking sequences, and I understand why they are one of the reasons the film is a classic, and they are especially notable because of the lack of sound or music. I still must say they are not what I enjoyed most. Instead, I enjoyed the betrayals, the lighting, and yes, the wardrobe. Everything was so deliciously noirish. My favorite scene was a delightful spin on the torch song. I wonder where the song came from because it is sung in French but the lyrics rhyme in English.

But what Rififi has in its content is much more. The famous mude fifteen minutes became a discrete but original tribute to the glorius mude films.
To be true, I have to name Bob le flambeur as another strong candidate among the best exponents of the french film noir. It's very close to Rififi about it respects to its freshness and another virtues.
Jules Dassin also directed the Naked city, but I'd rather prefer Rififi.
Buy this DVD sooner as you can and don't forget the fact that the new wave will burn three years after. And between you and me, Rififi would be a close ancestor of that important french movement. Don't you?",1083542400,,808,4.541095890410959
1412449,4,B00005A8TX,"""Rififi"" is a terrific heist movie, and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since.  Jules Dassin had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live---you will not find here the Hollywood glamour of ""Ocean's Eleven.""  The robbers in ""Rififi"" don't rob for the thrill, and they're not playing a game.  They rob to survive, to pay for their children's upbringing, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world.
The much-lauded heist scene is a nail biter, filmed in virtual silence.  I did have the feeling that the plot went on a bit longer than it needed to, but the high-speed race to deliver the child to his mother that ends the film is classic.
Be warned---this movie is very bleak.  But it's also very good.

1412450,5,B00005A8TX,"""Rififi"", made in France in 1954, was a groundbreaking film at the time of its release and still holds up well today. It is a film about a caper heist and the 28 minute jewelry store robbery, filmed with no dialog or music, is the highlight of the film. However, the film offers much more. The actors are all superb and memorable. Director Jules Dassin had a very small budget and had to use lesser known actors. Jean Servais, gaunt and haggard after years of alcoholism is perfect as Tony, the leader of the gang. Dassin himself plays Cesare, the safe cracker whose careless indiscretions following the robbery spoils their ""perfect crime"". The film also features superb cinematographer, gritty and stark, and the city of Paris becomes a character in itself. Dassin would only film outdoor scenes on cloudy and rainy days which gives the film a documentary-type feel.
Criterion's DVD release is superb. The print is flawless, as far as I could tell on my 35"" screen, and I could not see any flaws or distractions. This is the original un-cut version of the film. The film was initially condemned by the Catholic Church in the U.S. and slapped with a ""C"" rating. It was then released with 3 scenes edited and a Bible verse flashed onto the screen before the opening credits! This is the version Dassin intented without the cuts or the Bible verse. A dubbed version is included for those who dislike reading sub-titles.
Other extras include an essay, trailer, and a 30 minute interview with Jules Dassin which was filmed in the summer of 2000. Dassin talks about the blacklist, which ended his career in Hollywood in the early 50s, and about the making of ""Rififi"" in France and how it ressurected his career.",1061337600,13,1708,4.7157190635451505

Technically, now, this film transfer is outstanding - the picture is superbly clear, better in fact than a restored print recently screened in Sydney.
*
For me, the film itself gets better with each viewing.  Kind of amazing considering this is overtly a suspense thriller, where not knowing the outcome should be crucial - perhaps this reveals that it is more a character study, particularly a rumination on a character accepting his fate, a fate portrayed as virtually predestined.  Also there is a sense that Dassin delights in the making of this picture - his performance as Cesare the Milanese is similarly brimming with enthusiastic charm.  The production design by Alexandre Trauner (Les Enfants du Paradis) is another factor in allowing enjoyment to grow with each viewing - the film looks wonderful.  There's a sense that each carefully considered part of the film is necessary, and that to change any would be to the detriment of the film as a whole - a little like the feeling inspired by a great musical symphony;  possibly it's a little ironic then that the one questionable element is the title song!  In the notes, Dassin is said to have rued his dismissal of an alternative, and at the time largely unknown, songwriter - Charles Aznavour!

It is also amazing to think that for decades this film was rarely available for public screening and not obtainable on video.  It deserves to be seen by everyone with a love of cinema.  A truly great film.",1007769600,49,1862,4.8454258675078865
1412454,4,B00005A8TX,"Director Jules Dassin was one of many film-makers blacklisted during the McCarthy purges of the early 1950s, and he made 'Rififi' while in European exile.  This explains why a work which on the surface is simply another crime movie exerts such a charge.  It is most famous for a 25-minute silent sequence detailing the elaborate  unfolding of a jewel robbery.  Unlike 'The Asphalt Jungle', which is often considered the first heist movie, this sequence is not primarily interested in revealing character or in proving some abstract theory about chance, destiny or human failure.  It is 25 minutes of men working, as if they were welding or working a factory machine.  Even the generic elements that glamoriese this work - suspense, tension, human error, character antagonism etc. - aren't as important as they are in the later nerve-wracking plot involving child abduction, extortion and murder.  This patient sequence privileges the dignity of labour, the reality of men (and it is men.  Women get beaten up or wail hysterically) doing a job.  In Dassin's world it is not a conflict between robbers and cops, but between workers and informers, those who would try to indolently profit from the toil of others, just as film-makers in Hollywood ratted on their colleagues to save their professional skins.  there is an element of wish-fulfilment in Dassin's portrait and treatment of informers in 'Rififi' - in reality, they were making millions and winning shedloads of Oscars.
'Rififi' was an immensely influential thriller, especially in France - the concentration on the mechanics, rather than the psychology or sociology of crime allowed for greater formalism in the genre.  The influence on Melville is especially apparent, and 'Rififi''s creator, Auguste le Breton, would write the screenplay for Melville's first gangster film 'Bob le Flambeur'.  Especially in its final third, 'Rififi' is very exciting.  Dassin doesn't try to impose any bogus sentimentality on his flawed characters (the ex-con hero is a vicious, melancholy invalid who flogs his faithless mistress).  There are relatively few visual flourishes in a film of conventional set-ups - some excellent carnivalesque scenes in the attic of a night-club, where masks and gurning props look on at the crime capers (anticipating TV's 'The Avengers'); the terrifying, near-Expressionist point-of-view watching trees and roads of a dying motorist.  My French friends assure me 'Rififi' is a wonderful portrait of the old Paris since destroyed by modernism and post-'68 political paranoia.
For all its quality, however, and in spite of Le Breton's reputation for injecting a local authenticity into the genre, 'Rififi' doesn't feel like a genuine French noir, more like a transposed American one.  There is little of the atmosphere or sensitivity of location you get in Becker or Melville, little of the narrative ambiguity, local resonances or stylistic depth.  After you have enjoyed this, I would recommend you try 'Grisbi' or 'Bob le Flambeur' to see what the French can really do with the genre.",1003449600,4,3063,5.256673511293634

The film itself is one of the greats in the genre of crime thriller, and so it is a criminal shame that Criterion have released the film with a French soundtrack well and truly out of synch with the action.
However - there are NO, repeat, NO - such problems with the English language (dubbed) soundtrack !
So - you have the choice of either suffering the sound problems (but getting the original language and thus a better psychological ambience) or suffering the dubbed English (but having the sound effects in synch).
Either way, if you are a devotee of films, or just heist movies, this is a Must-Have !

7935070,4,B00005A8TX,"Rififi, 1955 film

This 1955 film was a sensation because of its unsentimental realism that differed from films of the 1940s. It begins with a gambling game. Tony from Stphane is short of funds, and asks for help. They drive a 1940s Ford in Paris. Another man shows up with a plan to burglarize a jewelry store. But Tony is too old and slow to run fast. Tony visits a nightclub to find Mado, an old girl friend. The conversation reveals their character and relationship. Then Tony decides he needs to earn money and make a big score. A long distance telephone call takes scheduling. Mario drives a Buick. Conspicuous consumption? After meeting at the nightclub they contact a fence in London.

They take great care by studying the jewelry store for their big job. They create a key for a door. Cesar knows how to case the joint and they study the alarm. It's the latest technology, designed to go off if a wire is cut or there is any vibration. Tony gets an idea about using a fire extinguisher! A simple idea defeats high technology. The next night the job is on. Tony steals a car. Note how the French store has a concierge on the premises. The thieves go about breaking in through the ceiling. They open an umbrella indoors. Tony descends to silence the alarm. The safe is carefully tipped over to drill into the back and cut a hole to reach inside. Cesar takes a souvenir. Two gendarmes find the stolen car and call it in. There's always the unexpected. But their getaway succeeds and plan to fence the jewels in London (a comment on the financial center of the world).

Cesar disobeys his orders and hooks up with that nightclub singer. He gives her a clue. Pierre discovers this and decides to take over. Ida and Mario are captured and forced to talk, but they don't betray Tony. Now Tony is out for revenge on the Grutters. He finds Cesar and reminds him of the rules of the game. The Police Inspector watches over the funeral procession. The Grutters take steps to obtain the stolen loot. Tony will hunt the Grutters by contacting his fellow crooks. Someone tells Tony where they are. The tension builds. Then a messenger is sent to Remy and Tony follows him for a final showdown. I won't give away the ending on this old film, but justice is served, the guilty are punished.

Do parts of this film remind you of ""The Asphalt Jungle""? Note how costs are kept down with a small cast and limited scenes. The long silence during the burglary reduces the costs of dubbing in another language. Tony was the first man into the store, but not the last man out. This resulted in the fatal flaw. But there could have been a squabble over the loot. There's more to go around when there are fewer shares. Or a gangster could have figured out that Tony was a jewel thief. In real life the Paris police would have rounded up all known jewel thieves and questioned them on their alibi. Why did the London fence carry a small fortune without guards? The biggest flaw in this film is the indoor alarm; they are placed outdoors and high off the ground. The presence of an innocent child adds irony to this story.",1477440000,,3103,4.477031802120141
