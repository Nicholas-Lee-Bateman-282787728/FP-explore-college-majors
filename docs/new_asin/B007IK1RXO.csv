5089422,1,B007IK1RXO,"The whole movie, I'm thinking ""This movie was written by Muslims."" I no sooner saw the first credit that my suspicions were affirmed. It is a post-9/11 stream of thought to infiltrate the American mind with the seed of confusion, that we Christians serve the same God, that we are just like the Muslim, and that the Muslim terrorist is not following the will of the satanic Koran. The sad part is that they are successful. Make no mistake, we do NOT serve the same God. They serve the Moon God, who was worshiped before and during the time of Muhammed, the ""prophet"" of Allah. Compare the Bible and the Koran; they describe two completely different Gods. Those not trained in Biblical truth WILL be swayed by propaganda such as this waste of film. What a shame.",1347062400,5,761,4.562043795620438
5089423,5,B007IK1RXO,"The story has a couple of surprise turns to it.  Action runs through the movie while at the same time you get to see an angle of the Muslim culture that does not get into the daily news.  A muslim leader who lives in NYC is identified by the Turkish secret service as a wanted terrorist in Turkey.  So the Turkish police put a call out to the FBI to apprehend the muslim leader.  Then all of the action begins as the Turkish secret police along with the FBI try to apprehend and hold the leader until they can get him deported to Turkey.  Then the surprise turns in the story begin.  Watch it!  You will find that the time spent watching the movie will be worth your while.  And don't forget when it comes to enforcing purity of any religion, purity has already been destoyed and all that we are left with is hate clothed in self right-ness.",1346544000,11,841,4.245283018867925
5089424,5,B007IK1RXO,"I'm coming from the view of a Muslim--living in America. I loved this movie, though it's not really much difference from other movies that show Man's greed, deception, the wanting of power, and most of all, ""the diseases of man's heart.""

The most powerfulest moment of the movie was when the American Government was holding the Sheikh under charges of terrorism with the idea he was part of an Islamic Extremest Group--(which there is no such thing), so, when both leaders were in a cell right next to each other, the ""True"" Sheikh quoted the Quran and Hadith(sayings of the Prophet), which explain that the jihads weren't fought under simple or minute matters, and, in addition, it was the Prophet who received the Order from Allah; the only other authority that can declare a jihad is a Caliph under Allah""s order. And today, there is no caliph in Islam, which means that NO ONE CAN DECLARE A JIHAD.""

This is the instructions for the jihad.

5089425,4,B007IK1RXO,"Originally released in 2010 as ""Five Minarets in New York"".

In Turkey there is a major terrorist raid. Meanwhile in the US, FBI agent David Becker (Robert Patrick) arrests the calmly praying Hadji Gumus in his home. Gumus fits the description of ""Dejjal"" (Anti-Christ) an internationally wanted terrorist who has lived in the US with no criminal record. Hadji's wife Maria (Gina Gershan) is alarmed by the arrest and doesn't believe the charges. Danny Glover plays Marcus who wants to prevent the deportation.

We quickly discover Becker is a man with conservative views, one that might be considered anti-Islam as he has to deal with two Turkish agents who come to NYC to pick up the prisoner. When Danny Glover orchestrates an improbable rescue of Hadji, the two Turkish agents (Mahsun Kirmizigl, Mustafa Sandal) go rogue to find him. Is Hadji a terrorist or do they have the wrong guy? That is the question put to the viewer as the plot develops and takes a twist.

The movie contains killing, good blood splatter with head shot, torture, rocket launchers, flame throwers, and three men in Muslim woman's garb who whip off their top layer and start firing with automatic weapons. The flames coming from the weapons is CG. More drama than action-thriller.

2 MF bombs. No sex or nudity. 3 1/2 stars",1339286400,9,1301,4.846846846846847
5089426,3,B007IK1RXO,"""We're both able to figure people out at a glance. We've got the wrong guy."" After a man is taken into FBI custody for terrorist activity his wife (Gershon) wants to know why. When two Turkish agents show up in New York to bring him back an accident occurs that results in his escape. With the threat of an attack on New York looming it is a race against time to recapture him. But is he the one they really should be looking for? This is a very complicated movie to review. Much like most people's thoughts on the currant anti-terrorism strategy we want them stopped, but at the same time we don't want them involved in our everyday life. This is a movie about just that. Following leads that sometimes divert their attention from the actual problem and being so stuck on one idea that it is hard to admit you may be wrong. Without sounding too political this is a movie that points out the flaws in the system but also shows what happens when it works correctly. The acting is good and the ending will shock you and break your heart. A movie that keeps you guessing right up until the end and makes you wonder how often this really happens. This has the feel of a TV movie and the quality could have been better but that's one of the only complaints. This is a movie worth watching. Overall, a very interesting and intriguing movie about how the FBI tracks terrorists and what happens when they are wrong. I say B.",1338595200,4,1416,4.347169811320755

5089435,1,B007IK1RXO,"After 3 minutes I knew how the movie would end. The story is so flat and full of stereotypes I could not watch for too long (skipped to end to see my assumptions about the plot being confirmed). Tons of cheap animations in the movie that I could do better on my desktop PC...I don't know what to say, I'm astonished that Amazon added such a movie and that they even charge for it...makes me thinking about changing to Netflix.",1347580800,,426,4.3375

8517607,3,B007IK1RXO,"This film (retitled from Five Minarets in New York) attempts to dramatize the complexities of life in the secular Turkish state and the difficulty the West has in distinguishing between ordinary Muslims, devout Muslims, and Islamic terrorists. It's a worthy effort, but somewhat melodramatic, and many nuances (radicals wear Shiite garb, the main character is a Sufi called Hadji, ethnic differences between the Turkish detectives) are largely lost on Western audiences. Haluk Biliger makes a valiant attempt to portray a peaceful devout Muslim caught up in circumstances beyond his control, and Gina Gershon gives a creditable performance as a Catholic Christian married to a Muslim. Danny Glover and Robert Patrick are particularly wooden in stereotypical roles as a Black Muslim and an antiterrorist government agent. Mahsun Kirmizigl and Mustafa Sandal portray two Turkish detectives doing a difficult job out of their element in New York City.  The depiction of police operations within Turkey is not convincing.",1467936000,2,1017,5.519230769230769

8517612,1,B007IK1RXO,I thought it was going to be a 'who done it' type of movie. The innocent guy gets accused and then gets killed in the end. Seriously? i wanted to slit my wrists by the end. I kept waiting for some sort of twist to the movie. Nope. No twist. Just melodramatic.,1399420800,,259,4.0
