6185087,5,B00HNGC56G,"I bought the first DVD several years ago and expected the entire series to be released in a timely manner. Much like other TV shows, the low life's that released the first DVD released only that one season. I was so pleasantly pleased to discover that Shout Factory would be releasing the rest of the seven remaining seasons. Season three continues with the charm and wit of all of the principle actors and actresses from season two, with Julia Duffy and Larry, Darryl and Darryl contributing more and more laughs. This was such a great comedy with good clean humor and wit that is sadly missing in the ""reality"" crap shows that dominate today's TV. Kudos to Shout for making this beloved series available. Known for their quality and thoroughness, I completely expect all seasons to become available in short order. Season two was made available just several months ago and here in mid April we have season three. Thank you Shout Factory for making this beloved series available in pristine condition. Great quality DVDs.

6185088,5,B00HNGC56G,"I always loved this show, but never realized how funny it truly is as compared to what is described as comedy today. This show is hysterical, and Bob Newhart and company never fail to deliver the laughs. I also love his dry sense of humor, and this season had me laughing the entire time. It makes me long for the days when this kind of programming was the norm.  Loved it, and looking forward to the release of the next Season. I also cannot wait for Season 5, as the episode Goodbye and Good Riddance Mr. Chips, was hilarious, as Dick decides to take a typing class, and his teacher is none other than the same man who taught him Geography in elementary school, and he still treats him and the class as if they were all ten years old.",1398556800,7,736,4.257142857142857
6185089,5,B00HNGC56G,"Am enjoying the 3rd season of Newhart. Hope they keep putting out more seasons.
These DVD's bring back memories, and they represent values that are not in current
comedies on TV. Would highly recommend for all to watch.",1398124800,3,219,4.7894736842105265
6185090,5,B00HNGC56G,I  am a great fan of Bob Newhart and this series is great.  Am really hoping to get all of them.  Great family shows for all.,1394928000,11,125,3.730769230769231
6185091,5,B00HNGC56G,"I'm so happy that season 3 is being released.  Let's hope they can release all of the seasons quickly.  Newhart is a wonderful series that got better and better as time went on.  In season 3 we get to see some of the crazy townspeople begin to evolve into regular characters, including two of my favorites: Jim and his sidekick Chester.

Let's keep the seasons coming until the entire series is released.  Thank you.",1394755200,13,416,4.5675675675675675
6185092,5,B00HNGC56G,"There were alot of transistions over the first two and season 3 is the best one yet. In this the 3rd season we get to know some of these characters better and better which will eventually lead to the hilarious 4th and maybe best season.  However, there never was a bad episode of Newhart and we get some classics here like ""My Fair Larry"", ""the Prodigal Daryll"", ""A Hunting we will go"" and ""Happy Trails to you"", which was also the title of the last episode of the Bob Newhart Show. I found that interesting.  In this season we start getting to know some of the eccentric side characters better like Jim and Chester and Harley. We even meet Stephanies father played wonderfully by Jose Ferrer. This only deepens the richness of the shows atmosphere. One thing I have always appreciated about this show is that the setting is Vermont, and you truly get the feeling that it was filmed there even though I think it was filmed on a soundstage in Hollywood. Hopefully the Shout Factory has got the bugs worked out of this and gives us a flawless print this time. It is obvious there are alot of us fans out here wanting to buy it.",1393977600,26,1125,4.403846153846154
6185093,5,B00HNGC56G,"After the interminable wait between the release of Season 1 and Season 2, and now with Season 3 coming out so quickly, it looks like the Newhart DVD series is finally starting to roll out - hopefully - in its entirety.  It has taken way too long for this great series to be released on DVD.  I could not be happier.  This series just got better and better every season with the characters and writing really developing into something outstanding.  Oh, how I have missed this series.  Whoever the decision makers are here - thank you for releasing these DVD's.  I'm looking forward to a marathon of Newhart watching.",1393372800,26,615,4.5963302752293576
6185094,5,B00HNGC56G,"Well with this news it looks like we can count on the Newhart series to finally get the dvd treatment it deserves.  With season two out in February and now the announcement of season three to come, there is hope for long suffering Newhart fans to get decent copies.  I know we need to hold judgement on the release quality, but for fans season 3 boast some classic episodes.  These include Harley Estin's sale of burial plots and ""Beaver Hunt"" which has spawned a family tradition around my house, Michael's getting fired and replaced by Dick, the feud between the Larry, Daryl, Daryl & Dick, the hunting trip with Chester & Jim, and Stephanie's turn as receptionist at WPIV.

6185138,5,B00HNGC56G,"Some sitcoms find the perfect mix right away, giving us laughs and characters we love right from the start.  A few, however, take a couple seasons to fully grow.  That was the case with Newhart, the 1980's sitcom starring comedian Bob Newhart.  While there are certainly laughs in the first two seasons, it wasn't until season three that the show really found its funny bone, and it kept this cast and the great laughs for the rest of the show's run.

The basic set up of the show hasn't changed.  Dick Loudon (Bob Newhart) and his wife Joanna (Mary Frann) own and run the Stratford Inn in a small town in Vermont.  What has changed are the characters around them.  Handyman George Utley (Tom Poston) has stayed around, but last season brought them a new maid in the form of Stephanie Vanderkellen (Julia Duffy), an heiress who has been cut off from her family.  Of course, she is used to others doing all the work, and this adjustment just isn't working out for her.  While introduced in a couple of episodes last season, Michael Harris (Peter Scolari) is on board full time this season as well.  Michael is the producer at the local television station where he and Dick clash over the guests on Dick's new TV talk show, ""Vermont Today,"" something he's added to his other job of writing how-to books.  Michael also happens to be dating Stephanie.

But I've left out the most popular and famous characters on the show.  While never full time cast members, this season brings Larry, his brother Darryl, and his other brother Darryl (William Sanderson, Tony Papenfuss, and John Voldstad) into many more episodes when they buy the cafe next to the inn.  Sometimes, they just show up for a scene; other times, they are featured in the main story.  Either way, these backwards woodsmen are a riot.

So, what do these characters find themselves facing this season?  Dick starts off the season by facing off with Michael over a commercial to promote ""Vermont Today.""  He also goes too far and hurts George's feeling at a roast at their Beaver Lodge.  Stephanie quits her job at the inn when the station hires her as the new receptionist, with predictably disastrous results.  One of Dick's how-to books becomes the subject of a plagiarism lawsuit while adding Joanna as a co-author on another leads to a fight between husband and wife.  A feud over a goat with Larry and the Darryls leads to problems at the inn.  In another episode, Joanna tries to help the brothers attract customers to their restaurant.  Meanwhile, Stephanie and Michael go to visit her parents and see some unsettling changes in her and crazy demands during a contract negation lead to Michael being fired.

The characters have become wilder in this season, which allows for funnier story lines and more straight laced reactions from Bob Newhart.  Yet the show treats all the characters seriously enough that we care for all of them.  They are a strange bunch, and yet somehow we buy them.

And it is well worth it because the laughs are plentiful.  There are so many perfect lines and moments that crack me up no matter how many times I've seen the show.  I've always remembered season three as when the show really got good, and I was not remotely disappointed.

The cast is excellent.  They are walking a very fine line as they create these wild and crazy characters for the comedy but keep them real enough that we still buy things.  It absolutely works.  I do have to give a special shout out to Tony and John, aka the Darryls, who never speak.  Between the writers and their performances, if an episode calls for them to do more than stand behind Larry, we buy everything happening with them.  The praise for the cast includes some of the recurring characters, like the towns people we have been getting to know as well as new characters who work at the station.

Considering fans have been waiting years to get anything past the first season, I'm sure no one will be surprised to learn that we get nothing in the way of special features in this set.  It consists of all 22 episodes from the season in their original full frame and stereo sound.  The sound is good, but the picture features noticeable dust and artifacts.  It's better than season two was, and it's certainly not enough to ruin your enjoyment of the show.  Honestly, within a couple of minutes I'm laughing at the story and forgetting about any imperfections with the picture.

I really can't tell you how happy I am to be laughing at the classic third season of Newhart.  Get this set today, and you'll be laughing before you know it.",1434499200,,4571,4.627329192546584
6185139,4,B00HNGC56G,"Bob Newhart is one of a kind, and his comedy is situational.  Great supporting cast.  Love the three brothers Larry, Darryl, and Darryl.  Stephanie played by Julia Duffy is worth the price of admission all by herself.  Her boyfriend played by Peter Scolai is a trip and as different as one could be matched as the counter to Stephanie, and of course Bob Newhart himself.  Newhart's wife Joanna played by Mary Frann is a one of a kind sweet and loving wife who doesn't have a mean bone in her body.  Then there is of course George Utley played by Tom Posten the Vermont Inn's handyman.  This is the third season.  In all there were 184 episodes produced.  That in itself speaks volumes of the quality and durability of this series.  I liked it much better than Newhart's earlier successful show titled The Bob Newhart Show.  The storyline basically is that Dick Loudon and his wife Joanna decide to leave life in New York City and buy a little inn in Vermont. Dick is a how-to book writer, who eventually becomes a local TV celebrity as host of ""Vermont Today."" George Utley is the handyman at the inn and Leslie Vanderkellen is the original maid. She is later replaced by her cousin Stephanie, an heiress who hates her job. Her boyfriend is Dick's yuppie TV producer, Michael Harris. There are many other quirky characters in this fictional little town, including Dick's neighbors Larry, Darryl, and Darryl...three brothers who buy the Minuteman Cafe from Kirk Devane. Besides sharing a name, Darryl and Darryl never speak (until the final episode of the series).",1432944000,,1563,4.730627306273063

A classic if there ever was one. Highly recommended.",1412035200,,374,4.681818181818182

Bob Newhart is always hilarious, but even more so with this excellent supporting cast. They work together like a well-oiled machine, from George the handyman to Larry, Darryl and Darryl.
