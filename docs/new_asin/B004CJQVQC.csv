4327558,4,B004CJQVQC,This is a true documentary. It is a great example what people can do when they work together. This is a motivator that if you have a passion and work hard the sky is the limit!  But the greatest thing is they take others trash and they turn it into treasure worth millions. If you don't speak brazillian as i don't you read the captions. Its a good movie to show art classes from 9th- grade up thru any age after that.,1471910400,,418,4.097560975609756

4327569,5,B004CJQVQC,"I used to think Vik Muniz was a bit of a ""schtick-artist"" but this video illustrates BEAUTIFULLY how following a thread of heartfelt interest and personal inspiration can change much more than just your own path and vision.

This film was bought  as a Mother's Day gift. Fortunately, in this case it was the thought that counted, not the actual disk itself.

4327574,5,B004CJQVQC,"My middle school students were engaged and interested in this film. I felt bad at first to see that there were so many subtitles thinking they would not be able to follow. In the end i think the subtitles provided a wonderful opportunity to read, interpret and understand the emotion of the dialogue.

I highly recommend it; it is an extremely heartwarming look at 'fringe folk' who make the most with what they have - joyfully. We owe it to them to watch; imho, the west is directly responsible for much of the misery our fellow humans endure.",1421452800,,307,4.310344827586207

4327588,5,B004CJQVQC,I really liked how one artist (and a film crew) could make such a long lasting difference in the lives of a few catadores.

4327590,5,B004CJQVQC,"I caught this on TV and it is a powerful documentary. I was thrilled to find a copy. The story and the resulting artwork are amazing.

Highly recommend this film!

4327603,5,B004CJQVQC,Vik Muniz is an artist who achieved great success and then proceeded to give back to his community.  This film is about a project he started to help people who spent their days picking through stuff at the dump.  Muniz and the filmmakers treat these people with dignity and you really begin to have empathy for them.  I was enjoyable to watch these thoughtful and articulate people talk about the society that they live in at the dump.  Muniz's project was assisted by these pickers who assembled giant works of art to be photographed.  Some of the pickers served as models for Muniz's work as well.  It is a great story of how Vik helped reveal the dignified people who worked in this recycling industry in Brazil.,1391558400,,715,4.590551181102362
4327604,5,B004CJQVQC,Touching reminder of life and how we impact each other.  Life is all about the live we give through acts of beauty and art.,1390953600,,123,4.125
4327605,5,B004CJQVQC,This film is an excellent counterpart to the photos of Vik Muniz that recreate famous paintings using garbage from a huge dump in Brazil. It explores the lives of the people who work and live there and how they are affected by this project. A film that poses important questions.,1390262400,,279,4.6
4327606,5,B004CJQVQC,"You have to watch it for yourself, but I was blown away by Vik's humanitarian efforts that were put into his artwork!  The things he did for these people!  If only more artists were this down to earth.  I cried, but was moved by these people's stories!  Too bad his art work is so expensive, or I'd buy some!",1389916800,,308,4.169491525423729
4327615,5,B004CJQVQC,"Vik Muniz goes into a ""garbage dump"" in Rio de Janeiro and manages to take you into an unexpected journey into the things that we see from far away all the way to a close view and even deeper into the hearts and souls of people.  And all through his Art.  Mind blowing journey a real life ""expert"" at seeing things differently for the better.  Always always a reminder of the beauty of people everywhere and how poor does not mean stupid, and does not mean ugly and does not mean anything more than a four letter word.",1389657600,,518,4.26530612244898
4327616,3,B004CJQVQC,"The premise of this film is the documentation of Vik Muniz' art project gift wrapped in what sometimes feels like a self serving balm of altruism that is applied liberally (pun intended).  No doubt Muniz and his art have had a impact on the lives of some catadores in the Gamacho landfill, landfills in Brazil and how the poor are viewed in that country.  More broadly, the store to me however, is how individuals embrace opportunity, deal with setbacks in their lives and persevere.  I imagine the subjects were picked because of their affinity toward personal growth, their raw Brazilian beauty or because they fit the lens perfectly.  The characters are interesting, if not representative (how would we know?).

Overall the film was well made and followed the project's timeline so that in the end you got a sense of the plan and the success it enjoyed.  I'd have preferred that the project plan be laid out to the viewer in detail in the beginning.  It may have been much more of a compelling story line had we been privy to the project team's selection process, the plans to take them to London, and the eventual art tour of Brazil that Muniz' work takes.

As an ad for Vik Muniz' art, I found it also effective and wondered whether an investment at the auction house in London paid off for any of the patrons.

Ultimately, my initial cynicism that the project was nothing more than a feel good exercise for the project team was not abated.",1388534400,,1445,4.61328125
4327617,5,B004CJQVQC,"Hello,
This film leaves viewers thinking about the emotional & mental effects of successes and failures, along with questions about human morals & struggles with themselves and natures. Simply a wonderful movie. I know there are a lot of great reviews for this art documentary already, so I do not want to repeat them. But the things I want to repeat are quotes that still vibrate in my brain during and after the film [yours & mine may not match] :

Valter des Santos: ""The fight is long comrade, but victory is certain.""
  ""It's not bad to be poor. It's bad to be rich at the height of fame with your morals a dirty shame. That's bad.""
  "" 99 is not 100."" [I don't think I can forget this one.]
Irma: "" I don't let anyone go hungry.""
Tiao:  ""Oh man, if I complained God would punish me.""
Magna:  ""I find it [picker's job]  more interesting and more honest. It's more dignified.""
  "" I may stink now, but when I get home. I'll take a shower and it'll be fine.""
Vik: "" I was never ashamed of being poor.""
  "" I rather want everything and have nothing than to have everything and want nothing.""
  "" Because at least when you want something your life has meaning, it's worthwhile.""

The film seriously reminds me to be grateful for what I have and motivate me to make the most out of my life instead of looking at the negative sides even when things go miserably wrong. Which when part of our lives failed or goes in ways we don't like, often we feel hopeless or become a complainer. Expect the unexpected, learn to love & forgive yourself, and be strong.
Here's my 2 cents and sorry for the bad English.",1388534400,,1602,4.328859060402684
4327618,5,B004CJQVQC,"This film has so many beautiful layers to it that it draws you in more and more by the second. From the actual artwork itself to the people that this art pulls from, you are completely captivated by the story and relationships that develop. 100% recommend.",1387929600,,256,4.586956521739131
4327619,5,B004CJQVQC,"A tour de force of art, dignity and friendship, but more words can't do it justice in this critique; period!",1387670400,,108,4.45
4327620,5,B004CJQVQC,"Thank god for his unspeakable gifts that he has bestow upon us.

4327621,5,B004CJQVQC,absolutely recommended. shows vision and process from concept to fruition of art's function as a social mechanism to shine a light on what most people take for granted. Real noblesse oblige: empowering and ennobling these otherwise forgotten human cogs in the societal machine. Zumbi for president! plus I love the music inherent in Brazilian Portuguese.,1386806400,,354,5.454545454545454
4327622,5,B004CJQVQC,It's like a combination of a documentary and a reality TV rags to riches drama. Pretty engaging with great real world characters and stunning visuals.,1384387200,,150,5.04
4327623,5,B004CJQVQC,I could not take my eyes off this...Vik is not your typical artist. He spent 2 years of his life with people who faced the most unsanitary conditions but this man had a goal and that was to take his art to such a level of respect that would sell for a price beyond what money could buy. I loved this film and would recommend to anyone.,1381449600,,335,4.014925373134329

4327625,5,B004CJQVQC,"What an amazing movie!  What an amazing artist!!!  He not only created art from trash, but saw more than 'trash pickers' when he got to know each of the workers and their stories.  WOW!  How great to have that kind of vision and to involve the people.  It was inspiring in so many ways!",1379116800,,286,4.222222222222222
4327626,5,B004CJQVQC,"For an American who does not travel abroad much, this was quite an eye-opener.  Trash seems so simple but when a well known artist sets out to enlighten the rest of us through his art, we, the viewer, become enriched by the human component of what it takes to process trash in Brazil...  and we're talking ALOT OF TRASH!  Everyone should see this movie.",1379116800,,353,4.484375
4327627,5,B004CJQVQC,"This is an amazing documentary.  It follows an artist through a service-oriented art experience.  The videography is well done.  The people are engaging.  The interviews go a little long, in my opinion.  If you  do an online search, you can find some classroom activities geared to high school, but adaptable to middle school or college students.",1378598400,,346,5.089285714285714

4327633,5,B004CJQVQC,"In an offhand manner, not sure that I would like it, I chose this film to watch one night when I had a little extra time. I was totally mesmerized by it.  It is extremely interesting, wonderful to watch.  I bought a copy to give to a friend who is in art school and is very socially conscious. Vic Muniz is a great artist and an extraordinary person.

4327636,5,B004CJQVQC,"I think EVERYONE should see this film.  It struck me that these people working in this landfill were considered the lowest in social status, in terms of what they do to make a living, yet without them, there would have been no more room for the garbage from those of the classes above them.  Hence, all of the city would have become one large dump..  And just where would have that ""upper class"" group been forced to move?  But even more, by performing their jobs, in order to support themselves and their families, they were doing a very environmentally conscious thing, even if they weren't aware of it.  I was especially moved by the camaraderie between the workers, and the pride they took in being able to support themselves being pickers instead of prostitutes and drug dealers.  I know this was just a look at one small group of them, but it left me with a feeling of hope for them.  I think it is a great thing that Vic Muniz donated the profits to help fund cultural issues in their ""Homeland."" I think it was great that most of those people filmed did something different with their lives, but even the ones that didn't, got the chance to try it, even if it didn't last.  I did agree with some of the producers that it was a very scary thing to just give them a taste of what life could be like, but I also agreed with Mr. Muniz that sometimes it could also make them actually want more enough, to make some changes in their lives.  I originally saw this film at our local art gallery, and I left there thinking of these people for days, and kept reminding myself how lucky I am to have such a good life----not having to worry how I am going to feed myself and family.  I don't have to spend days and nights picking recyclables out of a garbage dump just to live.  I think after this film was made they had a little more sense of pride. I think the whole construction of the portraits was absolutely fantastic, especially since the workers helped make them.  I loved this film so much, I had to purchase it myself.

4327638,5,B004CJQVQC,"My high school students reside in the Arts and Humanities house of our school in Texas. We were mesmerized by Wasteland and the possibilities it inspired for using art to transform lives. From our pre-viewing discussions of ""What exactly is art?"", to post-viewing analyses of human rights violations and implications for community projects that integrate the power of art with the need to focus awareness on women's issues, we found Wasteland to be an incredibly rich source of ideas, enlightenment, and inspiration.",1365120000,,516,5.304878048780488

4327646,5,B004CJQVQC,"An artist took an original idea and gave us all a look at a world we don't think to consider; one we turn away from; like so much garbage. In that world Muniz brings together three things that don't mix: people, garbage, and those leery about beholding the spectacle. But it wasn't as uncomfortable as one might have thought at first, and we see how life at the bottom is not without its dignity, not without it's usefulness, not without its beauty.

When art is used to improve lives, bring attention to the human condition, make us self-reflective, then I believe it's the highest form of all.  This is the story of an artist who does just that.  The movie shows garbage-pickers who live in dehumanizing conditions yet whose spirit triumphs over it.

The only reason I gave it fewer than five stars was that it could have gone further to explain the landfill situation in Brazil and reasons for not sponsoring recycling programs to reduce the need for garbage-pickers.  Putting the garbage situation in a larger context would have emphasized more global responsibility.  However, the movie didn't lose focus by telling the story of an artist embarking on a interactive journey with art and the plight of people in his homeland.",1360454400,,899,4.96

In fact, every American period, should watch it. Sometimes we are blind to how people in other parts of the world live, and the sacrifices they have to make just to get a bit of food and shelter and water every day. This is no ""save the children"" type movie where you see people starving in a desert or jungle. This is people on the fringes of a growing society (and growing wealth disparity, just as it's happened in every western country), letting you into their lives, showing you how incredibly lucky you and I are... and maybe getting us in touch with our humanity, our God (if you're religious), and our world a little bit more than before we watched. It's hard to forget once you see it.

With the World Cup coming up in Brazil, I can't think of a better time for people to watch this and think about what it means to be a ""global citizen"". We hear all this lip-service from media about ""global economy"" and ""global social media"" and ""connecting worldwide"" to anyone we want... well if that's true, then my hope is the things you see in this movie won't be a reality anymore in 10 years. Do we have the courage of our convictions? I don't know.

4327654,2,B004CJQVQC,"Artist Vic Muniz begins the narrative by saying that he wants to change people, that he wants to help them. Muniz assumes that he knows better what is good for these people and that these people, whom he has never met need him to swoop in and change them. Vic tries to seem more legitimate by including his ""very low middle class"" home where he grew up, and the low paying job he had as a kid. There are several shots of him in his gigantic library talking about how he is tired of people who have higher incomes thinking they are better than people with lower incomes. In fact, the whole time Muniz seems to be trying to legitimize himself and artwork in general in the face of the devastating poverty of the recycling pickers in Jarmin Gramacho. I see this as an extension of a colonial dominating spirit. The recycling pickers stories are interesting, but all the while I am watching there seems to be something wrong. Vic and his assistant are posing the pickers, taking their pictures and also videotaping it. While Vic is speaking to the emptiness of material goods, he is claiming footage and pictures of the pickers. The documentary in general seems more for the audience, feel-good of Muniz and his group than it is a sustainable social change for the recycling pickers as a whole. The story packs a punch because of the pride and hope these recycling pickers have for life, not because of the egotistical artist coming in to solve the worlds problems with money.",1351987200,2,1472,4.579545454545454

4327661,5,B004CJQVQC,"Lucy Walker's documentary ""Waste Land,"" filmed over three years, is another must-see and worth the effort (despite some difficulty with the subtitles). Walker's film while a family movie is better suited for those 17 and older, not due to mature content, but due to the development of the plot and featured characters. The younger set will not have the patience to sit through the story development. Walker's story, while a story of the human spirit, centers on human dignity, the untapped potential of every human, and unconditional giving.

Walker focuses on Vik Muniz, a world renown modern artist who escaped from a lower middle class area of Rio de Janeiro and subsequently returns to his native Brazil at the peak of his fame to ""paint"" trash pickers of recyclable materials who work at the the world's largest garbage dump, Jardim Gramacho, on the outskirts of Rio. Muniz investigates the lives of the trash pickers- who live with a special dignity and camaraderie - and then ""paints"" a number of them creating photographic images using garbage from the dump. Those whom he painted were hired to help in painting their image, and in this new ""job"" learned about themselves and the dignity of being a ""picker.""

These works of art were then displayed and sold for $50,000 each at shows in London and Sao Paulo. The featured subjects participated as guests at the shows, and achieved fame never anticipated. Proceeds from the sale of the art were given to the ""pickers"" union and the lives of those featured were changed forever as they discovered self-worth, the possibilities of life outside the dump, beauty, and the artistic potential of ""trash.""

The rubbish is classless, but Rio is not classless because the ""filthy"" rich display themselves on the boulevardes and beaches of the city whilst the slums of the poor cling to the surrounding hills. Vanity Fair on the other hand is a peek into the lives of the rich and wannabe rich. One Rio class is connected to the other through the rubbish, but the syzygy is also the contrast between the two.

""Waste Land"" does this without exception, and in the hands of director Lucy Walker, succeeds on all levels. Artist Vik Muniz went, with trepidation, back to his native Brazil, to examine the vast enigma that is Jardim Gramacho in Rio, the world's largest garbage landfill. It's not really known what he plans to do there at the outset, but with observation, he gets to know the people who work there, many of whom are down on their luck; others who know no other form of survival. How he gets these wonderful people to open up, and ultimately change their lives, is the stuff of fairy tales ...yet, it happens, and you can't help but cheer. Without prejudice or name-calling, we have a documentary that explains a global issue, alternatives, sincere compassion for all involved, and the realzation that these changes can, actually, happen. It's not always pretty, but brutally honest. That ""Waste Land"" was nommed for an Oscar doesn't surprise me at all. This is a film of power and strength, which is really about the sweetest and simplest people finding worth in themselves. This IS a great documentary, and, on most every other level, a great film. Indeed, ""99 is not 100"". In context, that line says everything you need to know. WARNING: Subtitles are often washed out. Excellent DVD extras.",1308614400,3,1435,4.8612244897959185
4327686,5,B004CJQVQC,"There's a world of difference between the glitz and glamor of the New York City art scene, and the stink and grossness of sorting recyclables from the used diapers, rotting food waste, and broken glass of the world's largest landfill.

Brazilian-born artist Vik Muniz has now walked in both worlds.  Extremely successful for his edgy and contemporary photographs of people and places, Muniz decided to return to Brazil to capture the ""flavor"" of Jardim Gramacho, the recipient of 70% of the garbage from the area surrounding Rio de Janeiro.  Hundreds and hundreds of people make a living at this landfill by wading through the freshly delivered garbage to extract anything salvageable or salable.  The recyclables are sold.  The wearable is worn.  The readable is read.  The dead bodies are reported.

Ironically, Muniz brings out the beauty in this place, particularly with the catadores who scavenge and sort here. He can't, however, capture the smell, which must be horrific.  Muniz and the workers soon suffer olfactory fatigue, although ""suffer"" in this case is probably a good thing.

These catadores are nameless until Muniz brings us their stories.  They are parents, and dreamers, and philosophers, and activists.  They sort, and cook, and discover.  They are proud of what they contribute, yet they hope their children graduate to better things.

Muniz builds confidence with these workers, and highlights a limited number of them as subjects for an exhibition... people of the garbage.  He develops these huge murals of their portraits using materials collected from the landfill as his media.  It's beautiful and the people are lovely.  But you begin to get uncomfortable.  The selected catadores really seem to enjoy their moment in the lights, but what happens when Muniz and his team leave?  What is the legacy here?

Watch Waste Land to find out.  Highly recommended.",1306886400,5,1883,5.148514851485149

4327688,4,B004CJQVQC,"""Waste Land"" documents a two-year project of Brazilian photographer Vik Muniz who, driven the question of whether art can change people, returned to his native Brazil to photograph ""catadores"" or ""pickers"" who collect recyclable materials at the world's largest garbage dump, the Jardim Gramacho landfill outside of Rio de Janeiro. His intention was to photograph a group of pickers, transform those photos into salable art, and donate the proceeds to the Association of Pickers of Jardim Gramacho (ACAMJG), a co-operative that represents the 2500 pickers who work at the site. Filmmaker Lucy Walker followed Muniz and his team around the landfill and studio as he got to know his subjects and they became more intimately involved in the project.

While Muniz' artwork might be most valuable for what it can do for the pickers of Jardim Gramacho, ""Waste Land""'s value is in introducing the audience to a foreign subculture that most will have previously known nothing about. Even Vik Muniz, a Brazilian of lower-class background himself, was at first nervous about working at the landfill due to its proximity to the favelas, which are known internationally for their violence. That's probably because the only time we hear about the favelas is when there is a gang war of epic proportions taking place. But there was no war while Muniz was working on this project, and the pickers who lived in the favelas did not seem concerned about it.

The half-dozen pickers to whom we are introduced in the film are interesting, forthright people who speak frankly. Though many of them work at the landfill because they could not get more comfortable jobs, they view picking as no different from any other manual labor occupation -just smellier. Tiao  Santos, the young president of ACAMJG, has great ambition for his organization and is proud of what the pickers do. They remove a tremendous amount of recyclables from the landfill every day, including many materials that are rarely recycled in the United States. It is interesting to see what effect their participation in Muniz' portraits has, which seems to surprise to Muniz and the pickers as well. Art did change things, and ""Waste Land"" allows us to see the process unfold.

The DVD (New Video 2011): There are two bonus features. ""Beyond Gramacho"" (18 min) talks about what happens after the movie ends, the continuing aid that the artwork provided to the ACAMJG, and the impending closure of the Jardim Gramacho landfill, as explained by Tiao Santos, among others. ""Untold Story"" (10 min) is the story of a seventh picker who was not included in the film but who was the subject of a Muniz portrait. The film is in English and Portuguese with English subtitles.",1302912000,5,2712,4.9801324503311255

4327690,5,B004CJQVQC,"I'll be honest - my expectations going into this movie were not very high - a conceptual artist that I've never heard of is going to preach to me about how we're consuming too much and generating too much trash? No thanks.

My preconceptions couldn't have been more wrong. Vik (the artist) grew up in the lower classes of Brazil so he has a clear connection to the ""pickers"" and their circumstances. The characters are real people who are well developed - you understand how they ended up at the landfill and what they think about their work, their place in life and society.

You will not look at your job on Monday the same way after seeing this film. You will not blindly reach for the garbage can again either. This is such a powerful story with universal themes - I don't know why the movie hasn't gotten more attention. One thought on this: I watched the trailer after I saw the movie and it just doesn't make me want to see the movie.

Best line of the movie: ""99 is not 100"". Excellent film, highly recommended.",1301875200,37,1019,4.409574468085107
4327691,3,B004CJQVQC,I can tell this is a great movie. I wanted to see it. I was prepared to love it. But the SUBTITLES  are illegible and inadequate and I am going to protest this problem every time I am subjected to it. Legible subtitles have been around for many decades. There is NO EXCUSE for these.,1301097600,6,283,4.1454545454545455
4327692,5,B004CJQVQC,"Lucy Walker's documentary 'Waste Land' was head and shoulders above any other film we saw at the 2010 Dallas International Film Festival.  I've been telling everyone about its excellence for a number of months, mostly getting shrugs and blank stares in return. So, it was gratifying to see it score a justly-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Documentary.

Walker's film pivots around two centers:  the large-scale artistic vision of Brazilian-born/NYC-based artist Vik Muniz; and a small group of residents of the favelas of Rio and their working environment, which happens to be Jardim Gramacho, the world's largest (and still growing) landfill.  Think you have it rough at your workplace?  Think you had a bad day?  Think again.  These workers are the vital cog in the (for lack of a better term) 'Brazilian model' of recycling.  No curb-side pick-up in this market.  Instead, human resources sort though the piles of garbage as it arrives, literally picking out the recyclable commodities by hand.  Walker's camera is right there close up in the fresh mess, which piles up at fierce, unrelenting rates.

Muniz's audacious project: he aims to construct large-scale portraits of the workers, with their assistance...made from the very garbage that threatens to inundate their existence.  And, to top it off, he plans to sell the works in a London auction and donate all the proceeds to the dump's nascent workers' training center.  By design, Walker doesn't really let on at the outset what Muniz is up to exactly. So, like the workers selected to participate in the project, you're quizzical as to what Muniz has in mind.  When it all comes together, it's magnificent.  What's best is the reaction of the workers.  They admit: ""Hey, we had no idea what you were up to, you crazy man.  Now, that we see it...wow.""  They're overwhelmed.  And triumphant - for the project has instilled brimming confidence and re-instigated dreams.  So, too, will you be surprised by the emotional wallop you'll get when viewing this film.

The breakout star of the film is Tio Santos.  Even before Walker and Muniz arrived on the scene, it's clear that Tio possessed the strength of character and intellectual drive to transcend his environment.  This is a man who'd constructed - and devoured - a library of works pulled from the fetid stacks of his workplace.  You'll cheer for his success - both in the film and beyond.",1300838400,,2406,4.972431077694235
4327693,4,B004CJQVQC,"Waste Land begins with Vic Muniz, a well-known artist, living in Brooklyn, New York, who decides to return to Brazil his birthplace, to do an art project that has social relevance. Art that will somehow help the people involved. Muniz's work mainly combines photography with other media. He has gained recognition worldwide. He decides to go to Rio de Janeiro to photograph ""Catadores"" who make their living picking recyclable materials out of the huge garbage dump/landfill known as Jardim Gramacho located on the outskirts of Rio. Muniz plans to take photographs of a number people, blow the pictures up, project them as templates and have the individuals participate in painting themselves with the recyclable materials or ""garbage"" as it's called in the publicity. Muniz then re-photographs these ""portraits."" His plan is to exhibit this work and sell prints with the proceeds going to the ""Catadores.""

As much as Waste Land documents the process of creating the art it also, by default, explores the influence of both the artist's involvement with the subject and the act of making the documentary on the ""pickers.""  As the story continues, questions regarding the motivation of the artists and their self-proclaimed altruistic goals, becomes apparent.

Director Lucy Walker allows all the contradictions that surface in the telling of the Waste Land story.  Muniz's possibly nave, even self-serving notion that he can somehow use his art to invoke change in someway, is confronted by the social realities of the ""pickers.""  The individuals interviewed and photographed are in some cases second generation. Many are illiterate. They form a caste at the very bottom of Rio's multi-tiered society. As the film progresses you meet and learn about six of the ""pickers."" JRMARTINMEDIA [more] [..]",1300665600,4,1797,5.269230769230769
4327694,5,B004CJQVQC,"Artist Vik Muniz returned to his native Brazil for a two-year project to produce large-scale portraits of the Brazilians who scavenge through garbage in a dump, in search of recyclable materials, with the portraits constructed from the materials themselves.  The documentary is about the project, conceived as a way of ""giving back"" (auction revenues would be donated to the scavengers' group, for their betterment). The documentary establishes Muniz's importance, and delves into the lives of the scavengers and what led them to this very low rung on the ladder. Their sense of their own dignity is a strong theme, along with their refusal to sink lower. The process of being involved in an art project and seeing the results expands their horizons; and with that comes the ethical question of whether or not it was moral to intervene in these people's lives and raise their consciousnesses to the point where question how they've been spending their lives.

It's all very well done, with great sensitivity. The film has a gritty feel both in its subject matter and in its production (grainy, high saturation and contrast). Definitely recommend this.",1300492800,,1151,5.117021276595745

Mind you, I was the only one in the class that looked as deeply affected by the story line as I was. This makes you rethink the way we live in America, with all its commercialism and such. It makes me want to recycle and consume less
and slow my deep rooted urge for materialism.
