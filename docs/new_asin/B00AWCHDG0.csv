I walk on a 3.5 speed and visually it made it very hard to stay with especially when the trail is very rutted and so many roots crossing the paths and I walking and the camera stops to look out over the land.  I just couldn't get it. I'm sorry I didn't like it, I know it received great reviews and that is why I purchased it. For me I need a trail that makes me feel more like I am on it. I never felt as it I was on the trail. This did not do it for (me). I'm back to watching TV series on Netflix so my time seems not as long.",1486339200,,594,3.6692913385826773

8558320,5,B00AWCHDG0,"I just worked out in Hawaii! This is a wonderful hour long workout. The scenery is beautiful. Lots of lush tropical foliage, which is a refreshing change from the desert I call home. As the trail gets steeper, the vegetation reflects the change in altitude. And the hiker is rewarded with a beautiful view of the ocean toward the end of the hike. The workout is as challenging as you want to make it. Be ready to go uphill! The hour just flew by. At the end of the workout you have the option to use the Hawaiian beach section as a cool down. Thanks for making exercise so enjoyable!",1401580800,,583,4.3090909090909095
