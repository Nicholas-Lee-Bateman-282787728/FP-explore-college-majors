7951449,3,B00005R1ML,"The cover of the Region 2 release of ""Fatal Blade"" (aka ""Gedo"") doesn't feature leading man Gary Daniels at all, but rather co-star/pop singer Kiyoshi Nakajo; I consider this a more accurate representation than the North American cover, since this may very well be the first of Gary's starring movies wherein he has the film wholly stolen out from under him by another performer. Nevertheless, even though the promotional folks seemingly didn't have a sound understanding of the film, it's still a pretty good picture - a somewhat unbalanced one that doesn't have enough action scenes and doesn't encompass the complete Gary Daniels experience, but it's definitely better-than-average DTV fare.

The story: a vengeful Los Angeles cop (Daniels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodmoon/dp/B000034DDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodmoon</a>) and an imported Yakuza hitman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nakajo/dp/B000A1EC94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nakajo</a>) seek similar ends alongside eachother in the middle of an LA street war.

The plot follows two main threads: Gary attempting to track down the murderer of his partner (Eric Lutes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caroline-in-the-City/dp/B00005JOMR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caroline in the City</a>) and Nakajo seeking to assassinate an underground kingpin (Victor Rivers,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mask-of-Zorro/dp/6305182493/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mask of Zorro</a>) while kindling an unexpected love interest with a woman he saves from deportation (fellow Japanese pop artist&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seiko-Matsuda/dp/B000008KJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seiko Matsuda</a>). The latter takes precedence, and while I'd usually be disappointed that Gary takes a backseat in his own vehicle, I can't fault it because the assassin's story is much more interesting than the cop's. Kiyoshi Nakajo does a very good job of portraying the archetypal Japanese antihero, and the romance angle is done artfully - you've seen it before, but that doesn't make the end tragedy any less weighty. By comparison, Gary comes across bland and the LA cops in general aren't folks you'd root for. This story clearly belongs to Kiyoshi.

...but the fight scenes belong to Gary. One of them isn't very good, but the other two feature smooth, inspired choreography (by Akihiro Noguchi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Belt/dp/B001F0TT2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Belt</a>) and impressive stuntwork. The first isn't very long and the final one is frequently interrupted by intercutting, but Gary's packing some undeniably cool moves in addition to his stellar kicking. Nakajo supplies some sword-swinging, but there's only one actual duel in the end (with Kentaro Shimizu,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kibakichi/dp/B00097E76M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kibakichi</a>) and it's not very good. Some shootouts and a lengthy car chase aren't awful but aren't pulled off as well as their ambitious staging suggests they ought to have been. An extra two or three hand-to-hand battles with Gary would have bumped this one's rating up another star, but as things stand, the movie's meager action offering is my biggest complaint.

I love the abundance of Japanese dialogue, but the script and story still feature a number of goofy and/or disappointing things: Nakajo is introduced as a ninja-esque master assassin but still does stupid things like trying to drive on the wrong side of the road, (SPOILER) and the abrupt death of his girlfriend is a big let-down. The film features a rare onscreen appearance of Cuba Gooding's father, but Christopher Duncan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jamie-Foxx-Show/dp/B0006N2F04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jamie Foxx Show</a>) ends up being pretty useless after he's built up as a tough bodyguard. In the end, all of these things accumulate in a way that makes it easy to understand why many folks are divided on this film. I have my own complaints about it, but in the end, it comes together as acceptable for me, and probably will for you, too, if you're in the mood to see a DTV action movie about a Yakuza assassin in America who falls in love while pursued by an American policeman with a British accent.",1306886400,,4568,6.545454545454546

7951451,2,B00005R1ML,"One of the more generic martial arts films released as of late, Fatal Blade is an uninspired and droll film that features Gary Daniels as another cliche renegade cop that plays outside the rules. Contrary to the movie's box art, Mr. Daniels hardly wields a katana in this flick, and the few action scenes which could have been somewhat gratifying are played in fast-forwards, making them appear cheesy and goofy, instead of exciting. If you're a fan of Gary Daniels (all three of you), check out some of his better performances, such as Fist of the North Star and stay away from this turkey.",1012867200,3,591,4.6923076923076925
