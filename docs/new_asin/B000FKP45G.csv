8124456,1,B000FKP45G,"A military genetic experimental creature is accidentally let loose in Bulgaria (thanks Russian mafia). An Army special ops ""A"" Team is brought in to ""quietly"" take out this genetic scorpion-bug.

We do get to see our CG bug at 14 minutes into the film. Most of the film is consumed making us believe this could really happen and tactics to confront the insects. The bug becomes camera shy for much of the film.

We get some minor ineffective character build up as we watch the ""A Team"" do a training drill.

This is no ""Starship Troopers""  but it does have a smart bug in it.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Some blood spray.

8124457,2,B000FKP45G,"Why do I say this? Because Scorpius Gigantus is an almost scene for scene remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnosaur-3-Primal-Species/dp/B00004OCXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnosaur 3: Primal Species</a>, except instead of genetically engineered dinosaurs, we have genetically engineered bugs. Not only is the story exactly the same, which Scorpius Gigantus lifting lines directly from Carnosaur 3, it even goes as far as using stock footage from the film.

The use of stock footage starts off with small clips at the beginning of minor things, such as helicopter footage being lifted from Carnosaur 3, but nearer the end the film gives up entirely, and takes the entire end scene of the container ship (that the dinosaurs/bugs in both films end upon) being blown out of the water. In fact, if you freeze frame the film, you can tell this is the case as the clips used have the actors from Carnosaur 3 in them!

The acting in this film is nothing short of atrocious, and while the scorpions looks okay, the rest of the CGI is poorly done, ESPECIALLY when it comes to fire and explosions, which look pathetically fake... which probably explains why they opted to use the scenes of the ship exploding from Carnosaur 3, which where done using a combination of matt painting and practical effects, instead of redoing them with CGI

Personally, I'd recommend you skip this film, and just watch Carnosaur 3 instead. Carnosuar 3 may be a bad b-movie, but at least it's entertaining to watch, and quite fun in places too, which is more then can be said for this film",1354406400,,1613,5.172413793103448
8124458,5,B000FKP45G,"This is an awesome movie that I saw.
It has gore,creature violence,terror,
action,explosions. And the most important
thing a happy ending. So do more good
reviews for this movie ok.",1336262400,,181,5.066666666666666
8124459,2,B000FKP45G,"Well, at least they have the creatures done right...the rest we have seen

before.... small crew, lots of bullets...blah blah

blah.  Roger Corman should find some exta money, add in a extra few scenes

of the creatures out in the open (village.cities) doing damage, and this

movie could have been a 3-4 stars...but noooo...save a few bucks, stick

to the formula and make more so so films.

Luckely the acting is fairly good, and there is no screaming bimbos.",1174262400,2,461,4.7594936708860756
8124460,2,B000FKP45G,"If you're a horror fan like me, when you think of the name Roger Corman, you think of some of the cheesiest horror films ever, with the basic ingredients as such:  bad acting; weak script and direction; and cheesy special effects.  That's why you end up liking Corman's ""B"" films.

SCORPUS GIGANTUS is not a classic even for Corman, but the effects of the bug are much better than usual, but alas the acting is atrocious.  Even the usually dependable Jeff Fahey goes overboard in his role as the head of an elite delta force called in to battle--what else---a genetic experiment gone wrong.  Most of the action is set in dark places like warehouses and on a boat, so you don't get to see a whole lot of the bug monster, but when it does appear, it's not too bad.  If you're a fan of cheesey films, this one won't disappoint nor excite.",1155340800,4,835,4.3896103896103895
