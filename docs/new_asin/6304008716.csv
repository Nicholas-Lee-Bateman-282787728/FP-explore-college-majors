760988,5,6304008716,"As a die hard classic movie fan before Hollywood became Hollyweird I use to go to movies once a week. This is one I was lucky enough to
see on big screen. I tried to tell people about this gem. I like Depp's earlier movies when he had a unique talent instead of just being over
the top outrageous and making money makers. Walken is always good in anything! He is the star of the movie. His scenes are so good.
He's got so many great lines and uses his unique acting skills to the highest effect. Depp is okay not great. The movie has a great plot
and moves in real time and you feel the tension and suspense of the situation as if it were happening to you. I thought the ending could
have been done better but it was not bad. It's a rare thriller that all real movie fans should see. Hollyweird can't touch this movie now.",1486598400,,822,4.111801242236025

761202,5,6304008716,Johnny Depp is a super actor in this cleverly written movie.  The author has a wild imaginative way to create and solve situations.  I'm happy I watched this movie.,1478649600,,164,4.620689655172414

761210,5,6304008716,I'm not sure why so many people gave this movie a low rating.  It gets you right into the action after a brief 10 minute intro and is suspenseful and entertaining the entire way through.,1478217600,,186,4.314285714285714

761342,1,6304008716,"Now let me get this straight: This is about a plot to assassinate a governor because she's a liberal???! This is a laugh-out-loud ridiculous film with a laugh-out-loud ridiculous premise and a laugh-out-loud ridiculous plot. A group of conspirators, including the governor's husband, want to kill her apparently because she's a bleeding heart and the best plan they can come up with is to pick a guy at random to do the deed and threaten him with the life of his daughter. Not only is the movie a piece of crap, but the implication that a group of ostensible right-wingers want a political opponent out of office so bad that they're willing to do anything up to and including murdering a little girl is frankly disgusting. Everyone associated with this movie should be ashamed of themselves and John Badham should go eff himself.",1477958400,,829,4.804195804195804

761346,3,6304008716,"This movie was fun to watch.  It took me awhile to realize Johhny Depp was the main character, lol. It just seemed really bizarre that these criminals would willy nilly pick someone out of a crowded train station and be like, ""There. That guy, we want him to assassinate the governor and we're going to do it by blackmailing him."" Then gain the film did come out in the mid 90s so maybe that's just the result of the times.  I get that they were trying to use him as the fall guy but it still comes off as very weird.  Then the motivation for the governor's assassination is never really clear, either except she had a bleeding heart that made enemies- yet earlier in the film it's stated that she's united the parties multiple times, I don't know.  Then again we're seeing most of the movie through Gene Watson's eyes and he obviously is just as lost, if not more lost, than us. And understandably extremely stressed out.

However, I do feel it is worth the watch as I have no complaints about the time I used to watch it.  The actors all put a lot into it and it shows.  The plot leaves a lot to be desired but it's still worth the time to watch it.",1477699200,2,1151,4.228310502283105
761347,5,6304008716,"Johnny Depp. His acting chops in this film made it an above average political suspense thriller. Besides that, I really loved the storyline along with the duration of the film itself though certain parts seemed to have been forced into the plot haphazardly. Will you like this suspenseful political thriller? Only you will be able to tell, so watch the first 10 minutes of this film and see what you think.",1477440000,,406,4.732394366197183

761601,3,6304008716,"Decent plot, a times troubling acting lines written on the water-cooler napkin, and the cinematography is the worst I've seen in a move in a very long time. Compared to period movies, it is C+ or B- grade in quality. Who does rapid fades, swirling and horribly shot close-ups? They spent more on the introduction (which was a stretch to the movie) than they did on the operators and equipment of the movie itself. Johnny Depp looked lost as  a priest in a red-light district at times and made the best he good with terrible writing.

761781,4,6304008716,An old Johnny Depp film with a -what would you do- story line. This movie has characters that you will like and characters you will despise. I did not care for the not so subtle political bias I felt the movie was trying to project but I did enjoy this story of a man who is put in a no win situation with his daughter's life literally at stake. I do not care for excessive profanity in my entertainment so the language issue cost this flick the 5th star. Otherwise I would strongly recommend spending  90 minutes with this great cast.,1446768000,,535,4.297029702970297

761952,5,6304008716,This is one o our family favorites because of the brilliant way it was shot. The plot entails a man who is randomly selected at a train station by hired killers posing as some federal agents.

Sounds like the formula for the perfect movie, but something's just missing. Maybe it's the fact that this film is almost 20 years old, and we've grown too sophisticated. Maybe politicians don't seem as precious to us anymore, LOL. I'm not sure how it was received when it was originally released.

762191,2,6304008716,This plot is so convoluted that no one would or could ever believe any of it. The premise of the movie is absurd and the notion that any of us would kill a sitting state governor to save their little daughter is absurd.  The action is there but it is such nonsensical action that you will be totally detached from the story. If someone kidnapped your daughter and told you to kill the governor or they would kill your daughter would you for one single minute trust them to let her go? Why would you trust them to anything but kill you and her? That is the story line and it stinks really badly.,1418256000,,594,4.2105263157894735

First of all, the entire storyline is preposterous, as several of the other reviews pointed out. Then the opening scene is incredibly unbelievable. Someone would have to be a total idiot to allow that circumstance to happen. The ridiculous incidents that happen throughout the film are too numerous to mention. But the biggest blunder for me was the totally implausible ending. Christopher Walken's performance is way over the top. Marsha Mason's character is weak. But Johnny Depp does his best to make a silk purse (his performance) out of a sow's ear (the script). This would've been done much better if Hitchcock directed it. It's his kind of thriller. But he would've cleaned it up, getting rid of the weak spots, tweaking up the suspense with a ""McGuffin"" or two, and just drawing us into the story by making it more believable.

Johnny Depp as always, right in character - much different than his usual roles - a respectable businessman caught up in a sinister plot to assasinate the governor of California.  Christopher Walken also on hand, villanous and played with his usual off-hand manner - quite effective as Depp's nemisis.  Also, Roma Maffia - now cold-blooded, remembering her in other favorite roles - the attorney in ""Disclosure"" who saves Michael Douglas's skin in a sexual assault suit - and always good to see her pop up in old ""Law and Order"" reruns, and reccalling her brief moments in ""Double Jeopardy"" in the prison scenes--another favorite.

762635,4,6304008716,"NICK OF TIME crackles like a good, taut thriller ought. The plot unfolds like a good, old-fashioned Hitchcock nerve-jangler. Heck, even the score is reminiscent of Hitchcock's past film scores. I like the conceit of the story's taking place in real time. And since this film runs only a bit past 90 minutes, no sooner do public accountant Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) and his young daughter Lynn (Courtney Chase) disembark at the Union Station in downtown Los Angeles than they're menaced by two government officials, Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia). Having gained privacy in a van, Mr. Smith spells it out for Gene. Unless Gene assassinates a prominent public figure, his adorable child will be murdered. He has 90 minutes to get it done. He gets handed a gun and an itinerary. Let's start the clock-gazing.

Johnny Depp imbues his character with this unassuming trait that makes him relatable, but then he also sneaks in a dash of subversive pluck, and this makes him rootable. Faced with an impossible dilemma, Gene Watson balks and tries repeatedly to throw a monkey wrench into Mr. Smith's plans, on the sly, of course. He slips a note to the taxi driver. He approaches a cop. He waves the gun and attempts to commandeer the van. But Mr. Smith, constant shadow, thwarts him at each turn, at each try to recruit help or get the word out. And as the clock winds down closer and closer to deadline, a desperate Gene begins to contemplate doing the unthinkable. In the eleventh hour, in a harrowing sequence at a hotel lobby, Gene is at last able to convince and enlist the help of a skeptical half-deaf, one-legged shoeshining man (Charles S. Dutton). But if your hopes lie in a disadavantaged dude like that, how secure do you feel, really?

John Badham - who also directed two favorites,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WarGames-25th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0015NORDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WarGames (25th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stakeout/dp/B000065V3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stakeout</a>&nbsp;- knows what he's doing, knows how to exquisitely ramp up the tension. The experiment of the real time ticking clock helps. It draws you deeper into the narrative, the fact that, mostly, we can account for the elapsing minutes. Most of the action takes place in the swanky Westin Bonaventure Hotel (also in downtown L.A.), a structure that practically becomes a secondary character, so well does Badham utilize the spaces within to establish certain key sequences. In the Bonaventure, the governor of California (Marsha Mason) is scheduled to hold a political rally. In 90 minutes.

At this stage, Christopher Walken is done being subtle. Christopher Walken is basically playing Christopher Walken, and it's always entertaining to take in his brand of crazy and quirk. He does exude menace. He makes you believe he really is capable of pulling the trigger on a little girl. For most of the movie he succeeds in flustering Depp's everyman protagonist. Luckily, Depp doesn't ever resort to trite action hero theatrics. To the last, he applies his wits. It lends a measure of credibility to a pretty preposterous plot. Because, really, long before Chris Walken's Mr. Smith lost his cool, he should've opted to just do the job himself. I figure, to a professional's professional, it wasn't worth it tolerating the accountant's frequent acts of defiance. Anyway, check out NICK OF TIME for a brace of unexpected (and expected) twists. Check it out for Depp's good restrained performance and for Walken's predictably showy turn. Check it out for Badham's swerve on that old Hitchcock convention in which the man-on-the-run meets and is abetted by a lovely girl. But don't check it out for that cameo by former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley. He dates the film something awful. And maybe the shoeshining man turns out to be more resourceful and timely than is believable, and the motivation for wanting the governor dead not explored enough. And maybe, near the end, that waiter was too convenient with his cart. Still, I think John Badham pulls it off with great flair and taut execution.

He is chosen in the most cynical way by bad guys Mr. Smith (Christopher Walker) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia) because it is apparent he would do anything to protect his daughter.

So they are going to hold her hostage to force him to kill the governor of California, Eleanor Grant (Marsha Mason). Problem is, he does not know who to trust. He tries to stop a cop on the beat to tell him about the situation, but Smith is watching him. He tries to tell the cab driver that takes him to the hotel where the governor is going to be speaking, but the cabbie throws away the business card on which he has written an urgent note without even reading the back of it. He tries to tell the governor herself in an elevator, but Smith pushes in. All the while, Jones is in their van with his little girl.

The story is done in real time, including runs to the bathroom (part of the plot line), rides in elevators, walks down stairs and corridors. But the action is still pretty non-stop, because we are following different characters at different times.

A man and his daughter arrive by train in Los Angeles. A man and a woman intercept them. Unless the man will shoot a politician his daughter will be killed! He is closely shadowed to prevent disobedience to his orders. Can he rescue his daughter? Will a guard check him for his hidden revolver? The fix is in. Smitty is in control! The conspiracy involves the politician's security (like the Praetorian Guard). Will Watson be immediately shot after he performs his task? [Yes, they will leave no witnesses.] Can Watson get help from the Governor's aide? ""Yes, its real."" We learn of the surprising conspiracy behind this assassination.

Governor Grant was not following the wishes of her backers. Can Watson get help from the workers in that hotel? He tells Governor Grant about the plot. Does she believe Watson's story? Will she cancel her speech? She learns the truth from her husband! ""The Governor has been shot!"" Can a successful plan go awry? Yes, when it involves a person who is not a willing member of the conspiracy. [I suspect Watson was a hasty replacement for the original patsy.] Of course, the villains fail and suffer so the good guys win in the end. Will the Big Shot behind the plot get away? Too big to fail?

This is a very intense film with little padding to fill out its allotted time. You can compare it to actual historic events, such as the assassination of William Goebel the Governor of Kentucky in 1899. You'll never see this mentioned in the Corporate Media. I suspect that Watson was a hasty replacement for the original patsy who tried to get out (but he knew too much). Smitty told about having to kill his buddy.

I especially didn't like the governor's character. She didn't seem that bright. Depp's character told her that he was going to have to kill her to save his daughter if she made a final speech. He said her husband wanted her dead, advised her to get out of that speech, and that she wouldn't be able to. She tried to cancel...but her
husband convinced her to change her mind.

Then, the husband said he sent her assistant on an ""errand""...but Depp had told her that the assistant was dead. I figure that was more than enough to definitely not do the speech. When the guns are going off, she just stands around forever.

Ultimately, it was Mr. Walken's portrayal of the blackmailer that carried this film. He was evil and had some funny moments at the same time. I chuckled when Depp said something like ""You're insane."" and Walken pauses a moment and goes ""What's your point?""; or when Depp's leaving a bathroom and is told to wash his hands.

His character wasn't perfect, of course. I would have especially been more suspicious when Depp goes to the shoe shine man a second time; also, when I saw the man laugh a bit/nod after I said something to him...after being told that he was deaf.

The ""real-time"" idea was cool, but I wish it was more...real. When the clock changed in the film to 12:17 and my digital clock nearby said the same thing, I expected it to be accurate with the passage of time. Yet time passed too quickly in the flick.

As interesting as the characters Johnny Depp usually plays, the two villains in here were more fun to watch than him. Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia were riveting as the killers. Depp actually played a normal person, which is not normal for him.

****possible spoilers****  The suspense was excellent in this real-time story. That was the best part of the movie.

762776,5,6304008716,"A complex real-time thriller with a fantastic cast.

Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken anchor a strong cast which also includes Charles S. Dutton's finest film role.

To long-time Depp fans this should be a classic. Amongst his strong film roles in the 90's (The Astronauts Wife, Ed Wood, The Ninth Gate), in my opinion this is the strongest.

Depp plays the father of a kidnapped child who must find a way to do what is right, while still protecting the life of his child. Christopher Walken is the antithisis of Depp, an agent of evil who will do whatever it takes to achieve his goal of assasinating the governor of California. Charles Dutton is an innocent bystander (the same as Depp) caught in the middle of this cat-and-mouse game being played by Depp and the many forces that have put him in the precarious position in which he now finds himself.

The real-time aspect of this film serves to heighten the tension, while providing a unique measuring tool which the viewer can directly relate to.

Long before the 'Pirates of the Carribean' franchise vaulted Johnny Depp to A-list fame in Hollywood, he was churning out many top-notch performances such as the one found here in 'Nick of Time'.

762777,3,6304008716,"In director John Badham's stylish thriller Nick of Time, audiences are given the unique opportunity to watch as the suspenseful story unfolds in ""real time"". The film, which has often been dismissed by critics as a typical thriller, deserves a second glance. The film's too quickly overlooked and forgotten, which is a shame considering how enjoyable it is to watch.
Starring a terrific cast headed by Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken, Nick of Time is a more character and plot driven thriller than most. Although it's many overt references to Hitchcock films grows tiresome, the film succeeds on many levels, particularly because of the pairing of Depp and Walken.

The story follows accountant Gene Watson as he and his young daughter are put into mortal danger. They are approached by a sinister man, named Mr. Smith, who proposes to blackmail Watson. Mr. Smith says that he will kill Watson's daughter in exactly 75 minutes if Watson doesn't assassinate the Californian governor Eleanor Grant. As Watson struggles with his conscience and fails repeatedly to free himself of his situation, he soon learns that he cannot save both himself and his daughter, while protecting the governor. However, he manages to use his resourcefulness and arranges a meeting with the governor's aide and her secretary. That seems his best bet to avoid committing murder, until it turns out that the people that hired the ever-present Mr. Smith are part of the governor's own cabinet. Racing against the clock, Watson must uncover the source of this assassination conspiracy and save his daughter from the clutches of Mr. Smith and his insidious supporters, but the clock is ticking.

Though the film was poorly received during its initial release, it has since become a modest hit. What makes the film so interesting, from my own perspective, is that it set the template for the television show 24. The entire first season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B00005JLF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>&nbsp;follows a Counter-Terrorist agent named jack Bauer as he is blackmailed into assassinating the first black presidential candidate or else his wife and daughter will be murdered. Like Nick of Time,  the television show also unfolds in ""real time"". Each episode, which runs at about 44-47 minutes without commercial interruption, takes place during one hour in the day of Agent Bauer's life.
Certainly Nick of Time is a flawed film, but it does feature some impressive performances. Johnny Depp, who at the time was only playing weird outcast characters, gives perhaps his most underrated performance as the desperate Gene Watson and Christopher Walken is unforgettable as Mr. Smith.

What a stupid story!  The entire premise is so preposterous that I imagine this film can only be enjoyed if you have the ability to suspend all critical thinking while viewing it.  As others have commented, it makes absolutely no sense that this random accountant would be enlisted at the last minute to assassinate a governor, especially given the apparently large network of conspirators involved.  Why Johnny Depp's character wouldn't have screamed for help as soon as he and his daughter were being abducted is beyond me.  (Are we really to believe that he assumed that the ""police"" had a legitimate reason for detaining him and his daughter the way they did?)  Later while he's pointing the gun at the head of the woman watching his child and she effectively talks him out of pulling the trigger by scaring him that the gunfire would ""go through the seat"" or be ""deflected by a button"" and hurt his girl, I could not believe how stupid his character apparently was.  A quick shot in the woman's head from the angle at which he was holding the gun would certainly not go through the seat or deflect off a button, and the woman would certainly be dead and he could have taken his daughter and fled.  And on and on with the ridiculous scenarios.

A man's daughter is kidnapped and held hostage while he is blackmailed into killing a politician to keep his daughter alive.

The movie itself is suspenseful and somewhat of a nail biter. Depp and Walken are excellent as usual and the plot also holds your interest.

Pre-dating the ""real time"" gimmick made famous by Fox's hit series 24, Nick of Time utilizes this technique very well for the most part, even though there is danger of the film coming apart before it reaches it's climax.  Despite that, Nick of Time is a potent nail biter, with a great performance from Depp as an everyman in over his head, and a superb performance from the always excellent Christopher Walken as a man who seemingly has his eye on Depp every second.  A box office disappointment in 1995, Nick of Time is definitely worth seeing for fans of Depp or fans of ""real time"" thrillers like 24.",1117238400,3,746,4.552238805970149
762925,5,6304008716,"This certainly isn't the best film Depp or Walken have ever done, but its well worth your time and money.  Set in real-time, Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) and his young daughter Lynn (Courtney Chase) arrive at the Amtrak station in LA, presumably for a business meeting Watson is scheduled for.  Watching the new arrivals are Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia from Disclosure), shady characters who are looking for someone at random to murder a woman for them.

They choose Gene, approaching him and identifying themselves as cops, they take him and his daughter off in an official looking van.  Holding his daughter ransom and threatening to kill her, they send Gene off to a hotel to kill the woman they gave him a picture of.  The woman turns out to be the Governor, and Mr. Smith is watching every move Gene makes.

Gene only has an hour and a half to complete his mission, one that he doesn't wish to carry out but cannot figure out how to keep his daughter from harm any other way.  Every time Gene attempts to find someone to help him, Mr. Smith is there with his guns and threats.  To make matters worse, Gene soon finds out the Smith and Jones are not the only ones in on the plot, and that finding someone to listen to him is going to be a more difficult task than simply pulling the trigger.

'Nick Of Time' is a highly suspenseful movie, some of its plots and intrigues a bit far-fetched, but nonetheless worth your time and money to watch, particularly if you are a fan of Depp or Walken.  Both are great in their roles, as is Roma Maffia and Charles Dutton as the shoeshine man.

I could feel myself wanting to bite the face off of Walkin's character, feeling the flesh and gristle grinding under my teeth, and wanted to slap some sense into those who turned their heads away from helping Gene.  Walken plays a great bad guy, and Depp plays a great innocent, making this intense thriller a pleasure to watch.  Enjoy!",1114214400,64,1950,4.490084985835694

The forced choice--faced by Gene Watson (Depp)--ninety minutes and six bullets to kill the Governor or lose his kid, kept me on the edge up to the end of the movie. Depp was pentultimately believable and single-handedly unraveled the threads of fear, rage, and revenge as he struggled to rescue his daughter.

The four other supporting actors/actresses who were outstanding in their roles were: (1) Christopher Walken who played the chief villian role (Mr. Smith) in forcing Watson's choice to kill; (2) Roma Maffia (Ms. Jones) who played the role of an assistant to Mr. Smith and acted as the point person assigned to kill the daughter if Watson did not follow through with his assignment; (3) Charles Dutton (Huey) the hotel shoe shine guy who turned out to be the saving grace for Watson and his daughter; and finally, (4) Courtney Chase (Lynn Watson) played the young daughter and performed well as the little chatter box who Ms. Jones preferred to return as an unwelcomed ransom.

While they played minor roles, it was great seeing Marsha Mason in the role of the Governor and Gloria Reuben (of ER) in the role of Krista Brooks, the Governor's Assistant.  The Cameo appearance of Tom Bradley, former Mayor of Los Angeles and the consultation with Governor Gray Davis' staff added to the real timeliness of this movie.

762929,3,6304008716,"I got this DVD purely for Johnny Depp, plus it was quite cheap, so that makes all the difference, right? Apart from the fact that he looked so much better without the glasses, and he was called Gene Watson (of all names!), it turned out to be an alright movie.

If you can ignore the continuous clock watching, and Christopher Walken always suddenly appearing in the background, and generally getting in the way, you'll probably get sucked in. But if you find these things distracting, you probably won't enjoy it as much. To be honest, the clock watching was getting on my nerves, as well as Christopher Walken & his ratty little mustache. But Johnny Depp is pretty much the centre of attention the whole time.

I've never seen the series 24, so this was my first experience of ""real time"". I found it quite good actually, despite the clock watching, and there were no slow bits, and you're constantly on the edge of your seat. Although, Johnny is far better in the more eccentric roles he chooses - he's never been a Hollywood starlet, who accepts every script he's shown. Most of the time, he looks uncomfortable with the gun, and as the clean shaven, short haired, bespectacled smart guy, he doesn't have the same appeal as the long haired kooky guy he normally portrays.

Some people have said why at the start, didn't he just grab his daughter, and shoot Christopher Walken's character in the head? Well, stupid, then there wouldn't be a movie!

There is a rather dodgy scene, a dream sequence, which will throw you completely. I didn't really think about it at the time the movie is supposed to be in real-time. I was too distracted by the fact that a gun which only holds 6 bullets, manages to shoot 7 or 8 if not more, without ever running out. Strange.

Sure, the plot of the story has a few minor holes, but it's still a good movie. But if you want to see a good Johnny Depp performance, grab one of his older movies, Benny & Joon, or something similar. They can probably be bought dead cheap. He's good in Pirates of The Caribbean, but the rest of the movie isn't up to scratch.",1093392000,14,2090,4.489473684210527

I think most of us like to believe we are smarter than the 'bad guys'... and even though Depp always takes a contrarian approach to society and characters, i nevertheless felt my need to identify with the victim and overcome the villain was not being sufficiently fed.  Who knows, maybe that's what Depp was striving for, the uncertainty and uncomfortableness of being in such quagmire of absurdities as to leave us (me) feeling angry at the good character, for being so dense.  Christopher Walken turned in an average performance as one of the villains (If he really wants to expand his range he should try playing a vulnerable good guy).  Perhaps that's what's really missing in this film- proper casting.  Walken should have been cast as the hero and Depp as the villain. This 'Real Time' (Pre-'24') Drama really didn't work for me, but it appears to have set the standard for other 'real time' shows.  What makes this film better than '24' is that it's shorter, and you actually DO root for the characters daughter to get rescued.",1089331200,6,1270,4.745454545454545

Johnny Depp, an ordinary Joe, is assigned to kill a senator or his daughter will be killed by Walken and the Mafia. All he has is a photograph, a gun and an ultimatum.
I am not convinced that the ambitious concept of real time played out too well, but with this much talent on board it still holds it own. A throwback to the Hitchcock everyman thrillers of years ago, Depp plays his character well and you always believe he is just an ordinary man in an unbelievable situation rather than an action hero in the making while Walken does what he does best and plays the villain well.
You'll be on the edge of your seat until the denouement when you find stuff out at the same time as Depp. Part of the conspiratorial stuff is a little feeble and perhaps could have been skipped without a dent in the script, but thankfully it doesn't dilute the tension around the chemistry of Depp and Walken.

Christopher Walken is as evil as he can be, his ruthless ""quest"" always a constant threat; Charles S.

762965,2,6304008716,"Already with heavy-arsenal names such as Depp and Walken ""Nick of Time"" still doesn't manage the must-see league of its genre. Without them, hmm, it would quietly drift into oblivion.

  It's a rather highly unlikely plot, where the secret service(s) wait till the last moment as the pick someone straight out of the crowd (!) , blackmail him that they'll kill his daughter should he not succumb to a deal where he has to go and kill the governor in a rally about to take place. Now you need as a viewer to get past this before you can begin enjoying the film. If, that is, and that's an ""if"" that comes with major complications. But back to the plot: what we have here is basically a major joke of an idea. the secret service and security of the governor's rally are all involved in the assasination plot, but since this is so major why would they wait till the last moment to find an assasin even if he needed be a patsy? And how would they have guaranteed results by simply picking him out of a crowd in a station??? This guy could've been a psycho, he could've been a cop, he could've been vasically anybody who wouldnt fit the schem not to mention they don't even check whether this guy can even shoot at all, let alone if he ever held a gun in his hands. Nope, it's as if all this doesn't matter. Yet, the picked patsy (J.Depp) goes along rather easily with the blackmail, which by the way only becomes convincing much, much later in the film, and then more absurdities begin to rain down on us:
  the agent who's responsible for putting the whole scheme in motion (Walken) has to be omnipresent to make sure that the the patsy doesnt talk to anyone or doesnt try anything that would put the whole plot in jeopardy. This alone becomes almost comedic at times as Walken is following Depp around coaching him (""go and do your job now"" or ""dont mess up again"" etc etc...) and all the time along Depp tries various methods of revealing the plot to someone or trying to escape to get his daughter back...And everytime Walken gets him back on track with the same monotonous ""admonition"": ""go do what you're told"".
  The funniest part of that ""plot"" is where Depp finds a shoeshiner to whom he starts revealing the whole thing but then he passes him off to Walken as deaf even though Walken has been seeing him actually talk at length to the shoeshiner...That's basically where the whole thing falls apart completely..
  Still, and considering what kind of faulty plot we're dealing with here, the movie does work. That would be mainly because of Walken's everconvincing performance as well as Depp's but on a secondary level.
  Walken, is simply a joy to watch as he pulls off the tough merciless guy role in imposing fashion. He always does actually regardless of role. Depp follows to par without overimpressing really but without letting Walken alone in his task to carry the movie.
  The 2 actors are the primary reason to watch this. Other than that, turn off your cerebrum because if you don't you might not make it through. Mostly for fans of Walken and Depp.",1077926400,3,3066,4.512635379061372

762969,3,6304008716,"Nick of Time (John Badham, 1995)
John Badham is yet another of those directors you alternately want to embrace and pummel. Originally a stock director on Rod Serling's wonderful series Night Gallery (and responsible for that show's most genuinely chilling episode, ""Green Fingers""), Badham went onto one of those painfully inconsistent movie careers that make one wonder whether the hits are talent or luck. Is the guy who directed Saturday Night Fever and Wargames really the same person responsible for Stakeout (and, worse, its sequel), Short Circuit, and the stultifyingly bad made-for-TV flick Brother's Keeper? So one never knows what one is going to come up with when encountering a Badham film.
Nick of Time falls halfway between, but nudging onto the good side. Much of this has to do with Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken in the main roles, with support from an astonishingly fine cast of minor characters (Charles S. Dutton, Marsha Mason, Gloria Reuben, Peter Strauss, Roma Maffia, and many more). In this episode of ""generic thriller,"" Walken (with Maffia as an accomplice) have kidnapped Depp's daughter, and in order to get her back, they want a favor: kill the governor of California (Mason), who's on the campaign trail for re-election. Depp has ninety minutes to do so, and Walken is usually standing over his shoulder trying to figure out why the guy's so blessedly incompetent.
While this is not one of either Depp or Walken's more outstanding performances, both are quite capable in their roles. The plot is good, if brainless, and the pace is well done. There's really nothing bad to be said about this film, although there's nothing that makes it stand out from the crop, either.

763025,2,6304008716,"Thankfully, this movie seemed to scare Depp back into doing the characters he was created for. :)  He makes do with what little he's given here, and Christopher Walken puts in his always tremendous performance as the  off-the-edge bad guy.  Unfortunately, despite the gimicky real-time plot  line, there's just so little to work with for both of them.
  There's  little suspense because the outcome is never really in doubt, and the plot  stretches are HUGE.  The political commentary was transparent and heavy  handed.  My friend and I had a bet going as to whether the lead character  was actually going to be named ""Nick.""  I was a bit surprised to  find that I had won and that Depp's character was named ""Gene.""  The rest of the movie is so formulaic that I wouldn't have put it past  them.
Completist Depp or Walken fans will want to see this, but don't go  into it expecting too much.",945043200,6,891,4.608974358974359

Id love to see this on Blu-ray disc, but it does not look as if there is an English version with English subtitles for the hard of hearing.  As the audio on the DVD was not first-rate, it was hard to understand some dialog.

Therefore, my review is based mainly on the DVD format.  If the movie were to be reissued on Blu-ray disc, I might have cause to review it again!",1523404800,,504,4.1020408163265305

But I thought the entire supporting cast was also good. The story was a little far-fetched but still a really exciting tail. All in real (or close to real) time.",1517356800,,311,4.672727272727273

If you like suspense and thriller, then this is the movie for you! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Johnny Depp is also great in it. I watched it when it came out in 1995 and always wanted to have a copy of my own and now I have it to watch anytime I like. Two thumbs up!",1512777600,,439,3.943820224719101
7859191,5,6304008716,"A Three Star Reviewer said this was a great movie for a ""rainy day"". I agree. But I'm going to go further than that and give the film a Five Star Rating. It was just so riveting to me. I found only one plot loophole and that will be described later in my review.

SPOILER ALERT!

Johnny Depp plays Gene Watson, a man who has recently lost his wife. He and his adorable daughter arrive in LA and are immediately kidnapped by Mr. Smith and his henchwoman. They plan to have him assassinate the governor, played remarkably by Marsha Mason. The level of the conspiracy to kill the governor is staggering! Her husband, her chief of security (But Not Her Personal Bodyguard Or The Campaign Assistant, Krista Brooks, Played Wonderfully By Gloria Reuben), another security man (The Wand Waver), along with another man in the crowd setting up Gene Watson by videoing him on several occasions are all involved to some degree not to mention Mr. Smith (Who Becomes A Secondary Shooter) and Ms. Jones. With such an elaborate setup one has to wonder why they didn't just hire an outside shooter and ferry him in and out of Los Angeles with a disguise. This has been done on at least two or three other occasions in American history. Indeed, the supreme architect of the plan is seen walking away from the failed plot with nary a stain on his hands.

I liked the stress that Johnny Depp conveyed throughout the production. This was realistic as one sees a man's anguish at having to commit a crime in order to save his helpless daughter. Too, Mr. Smith's hanging around to cajole, intimidate and warn Watson is also realistic. Now we come to the gaffe in the plot. I don't think Mr. Smith would have been so easily duped into thinking Charles Dutton was a deaf man--despite the generic sign hanging on the door of his shoeshine booth. It would have made more sense for Dutton to have overheard their discussion in passing or whilst to the side or behind an obstruction that was not solid. Despite this oversight in the script I still liked the film. Made at a time when California was run by a right wing governor named Pete Wilson, the film melded in with the current politics of the time. I liked seeing the discussion of the cameramen in the Bonaventure Hotel bar as they talked about how Governor Grant had become ""too liberal"" and how she was making the state ""too multicultural and diverse."" Indeed, those men might very well have been Donald Trump supporters 20 years later. Ironic how the very conversation discussed then in a 1995 movie was prescient and current in today's political climate. Sad that people buy into such B.S. but then again such bigotry and ignorance got a man named Trump elected President. I could see a plot to prevent a liberal governor slain in order to push the politics and policies of the hidden alternative right-wing. I won't tell you how this film culminates except to say that the climax is an exciting and exhilarating smash of wits, improvisation and finesse over force. Watson gains a bevy of allies and enemies in the bargain. But he triumphs against all odds while still keeping his honor intact.

I'm proud to say that I'm the 300th person to review this fine film. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.

I won't go into too much detail on the plot. Suffice it to say that it comes together and I really liked the film. Filled with great supporting performances by Gloria Reuben, Peter Strauss and Bill Smitrovich, Badham's film is a solid action-suspense yarn that more than delivers on all the punches. It's just so incredible! I never saw it in theatres but I did see it on cable and I taped it from Showtime I believe. This film is a Four and a Half Star gem of a movie. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.",1504310400,,3743,4.5474777448071215
