2922583,5,B000UNYJV8,"I'm so glad this film saw some theater time in the states. Even in Pittsburgh of all places! Saw it at the first showing, having waiting several months to see it.  Wasn't disapointed.

A lot of people are going to inevitably slag on this because there's never going to be a film depicting skins that's going to please everyone (some fresshies are going to inform us that not all skins... blah blah blah).

This is doubtlessly the most honest take on skins, and the writing comes off as realistic, as do the characters which has everything to do with stellar performances.  And Graham who plays Combo... this guy is crazy, off the charts talented.  Its a good movie even if you're not interested specifically in the subculture it depicts.  If you've got a chance to, I say don't miss it.

I can't wait for the DVD to come to the States. I'm going to track down Dead Man's Shoes next.",1188086400,6,882,4.475

Movie depicts a growth of Nazism in the UK and, perhaps, is interesting especially for locals comparing the past and present realities of day-to-day grass-root existence.

For outsider, this story of mother-of-democracy modern time xenophobia and racism is just a next testimony to a nothing-is-absolute practical notion.",1188086400,6,635,5.604166666666667
2922585,2,B000UNYJV8,"Based on the filmmaker's own experience in a working class English neighborhood in the 1980s, this is the story of an 11 year old boy who is befriended by a bunch of skinheads.  There was a bit of violence and some good acting but there was much too much talking.  Even though it had a some emotional impact, I found it rather choppy and amateurish.  I also found it hard to understand the English accents and think that there should have been subtitles for an American audience.  The directors and one of the actors spoke with the audience later but even though I applaud them for trying, I would not recommend this film.",1187308800,4,622,4.477876106194691
2922586,5,B000UNYJV8,"This story, both beautiful and disturbing in it's messages and imagery, is about many different themes, all brilliantly woven together by British director, Shane Meadows.

The themes cover Thatcherite England in the 80's, Skinheads (good and bad), racism, bullyism, and the loss of childhood innocence. The film is strongly influenced by Director Shane Meadows childhood experiences as a skinhead, both good and bad.

The outline of the story is that a young ""Shaun Fields""(played amazingly by newcomer Tomo Turgoose) lives in a small un-named Northern English town in 1983. ""Shaun"" has recently lost his father in the early stages of the Falklands War. On the last day of the school term before summer break ""Shaun"" is harassed over his choice of hippy-like clothing by several cooler kids.

On his way home from school, Shaun chances upon a non-racist skinhead gang (which includes two Jamaican members), led by the charming and lanky ""Woody"" (played by the affable Joe Gilgun). ""Shaun"" immediately takes to ""Woody"" as a surrogate father figure and is soon admitted in to the gang. Admission means parties, a new girlfriend (Rosamund Hanson) a new haircut, a new Ben Sherman shirt, and a new pair of boots (purchased by his mother (Jo Hartley) in an extremely funny scene) as well as a whole new group of friends who treat Shaun as an equal.

All seems well in this quiet English town until one incident changes all of their lives about midway through the film. This is the return of ""Combo"" (the electrifying Stephen Graham in his first major leading role) from 3 years in prison. ""Combo"" is the former leader of this gang and wastes no time trying to re-establish his dominance in a direct confrontation with ""Woody"". ""Combo"" has become a racist during his 3+ years in prison and views skinheads as the prefect front line soldiers in the National Front's (an extremely conservative political party) war to keep England for ""Englishmen.""

This confrontation with ""Woody"" soon splits the gang, some siding with ""Combo"", others with ""Woody"". ""Shaun"" is now forced to choose among father figures and the movie takes a decidedly chillier tone from it's lighthearted first half.

The film is brilliant because all of Meadows characters are complicated and feel like real human beings. ""Combo"" even offers ""Milky"" (Andrew Shim), a black skinhead, the chance to join his gang because ""Combo"" views the immediate problem as the ""Paki"" (Pakistani) workers who have flooded his town in recent years, taking jobs and houses from Englishmen.

It's the complexities such as this that make the characters (such as the Swastika tattooed Combo) so approachable and compelling to watch.

Even Shaun still appears like an adorable little child as he dresses in an English Cromby coat to go ""Paki Bashing"" at the local store.

The movie comes to what seems like an almost inevitable violent clash between two of the main characters that, despite its predictability, still jars the viewer, hopefully leaving you sickened. Shaun is then left to decide where his future lies.

The movies story is set against the backdrop of the Falklands War, whose brutal images Meadows deftly juxtaposes against the current violent and desolate climate of 80's England. Meadows was, interestingly, granted full access to many war footage images that had never been released to the public previously.

The film contains a fantastic soundtrack of early ""skinhead reggae"" tunes, including several songs by Toots and the Maytalls, including ""54-46"" which is played over a collage of media clips from 80's Britain and the Falklands War. It's a terrific mood setter for the rest of the film.

Meadows shines so brightly (as does his cast) because he intimately knows this material and these characters, many of whom are based on or even named after childhood friends of his.

Some American viewers may initially be off-put by the idea of any ""Skinhead"" related movie if all they know of skinheads is what they have seen in the American press in the last 20+ years. It may surprise many viewers not familiar with the original skinhead scene (circa 1966-72) in Britain to learn the the original skins (now often called Traditional Skins, Trojan Skins, or '69 skins) were a multi-racial bunch who were an off-shoot from the Mods. They were known, like the Mods, for being sharp dressers and they chose as their music Jamaican Rocksteady, Reggae, and American Soul. The skinhead movement in England largely died out in 1972 and then saw a revival in the late seventies. It's this revival group that was penetrated by the likes of the National Front that Meadows covers here. If you choose to not watch this film based on it's subject matter, you are missing not only one of the best acting performances by a new-comer(Turgoose)in recent history, but you are also missing what will no doubt become considered landmark moment in British film history.",1186531200,87,4905,5.0036809815950924

2922594,5,B000UNYJV8,"Hands down, one of the very best films I have seen in many years. An honest, powerful and genuinely realistic story about the beginings of the skinhead movement in England. I was amazed by this movie, simply amazed. The directing is some of the best I have seen in recent memory. The acting is some of the best I have seen in a very long time. This film is slow moving, but It's not a film that relies on action or brutality to tell it's story. It's a movie that has a real sense of realism, right down to the music, which clearly was particularly treated with special care. There are some underground songs in this film that I was very suprised to hear. Such as Strawberry Switchblade's 'Since Yesterday', and a very moving cover of The Smiths ""Please Please, Please- let me get what I want"" among other music tracks that add to the very realistic feel of this film. This film is certainly the most realistic rendering of the true skinhead movement. It has moments that will remind you of films like Romper Stomper and American History X. And while not nearly as violent as either, you'll come out of this feeling that you've seen an honest portrait of the skinhead movement. I can't say enough good things about this movie. And again the acting is way beyond fantastic. Highly recommended!!",1367625600,,1292,4.549356223175966
2922595,5,B000UNYJV8,"Neither for the squeamish nor those who choose to see the problems of racism as in decline, ""This is England"" places at the forefront of its subject matter a Thatcherite England dealing with the struggles of classism, racism, and a society that has turned upon itself.  This story is wrought with violence and humanity, with characters that subvert the classic image of an ideal potential existence and, thus, in a sense we are all doomed to commit some sin (post-lapsarian maybe?).  While characters can never achieve a perfection, they can, and do, achieve a chilling potential for evil.

Superbly shot and acted, this movie is great.",1366675200,,636,4.981132075471698
2922596,4,B000UNYJV8,"THIS IS ENGLAND makes up for its relative uneventfulness with immediate realism, truly fine acting, and well-developed characters. Young Thomas Turgoose's performance is simply out of this world! As stated, it's not the most uplifting film you're likely to see, but it does have its funny and/or poignant moments. The view it affords of racial intolerance and anti-immigration sentiments in England during the 1980s remains quite pertinent today. THIS IS ENGLAND also includes a balanced and believable expos of the punk and skinhead movements and the motivations behind them. The Special Features, particularly the Deleted Scenes and Alternate Ending, are definitely worth a look. The heavy north English brogues are a bit hard to understand sometimes, but the subtitles should help here.",1361836800,,789,5.475409836065574
2922597,5,B000UNYJV8,"This is one of my favorite movies that I saw on TV late at night. As always amazon had it! It tells the story of a young boy who joins a group of skinheads. The split from Trojan (Traditional Skins) to Rascist/Far Right Skins is shown here with Combo. It does very good to show the Skin Culture in a movie (the director was a Skin in his youth and it's pretty autobiographical). It is a great coming of age tale, a great Skin movie, it  also examines how hatred can spread through manipulative people and how through reason good will rise in the end. Be warned this movie is quite an emotional experience and the ending is cathartic.

All the music is great (Toots and The Maytals, Percy Sledge, The Specials, U.K. Subs, the Piano themes by  Ludovico Einaudi, Et cetera) in short  it's all good.

 As for extras there is an essay on skins, a making of feature, and the deleted scenes (including the alternative ending)

 10/10 movie I would highly recommend it to those who keep the spirit of '69 Alive  and those who aren't skins at all. It's just a great movie that has a powerful message, it's pretty universal and not just about a subcultute that is very misunderstood.",1360195200,4,1173,4.44392523364486
2922598,4,B000UNYJV8,"I watched This is England on Netflix and found it to be an enjoyable albeit a vague movie about the skinhead culture or counter culture depending on how you perceive it. The movie basically has to do with the segregation between the skinheads, one section is just the traditional skinhead while the other section is the new nationalist skinhead. I was uninformed about what a skinhead actually was, it was my understanding that skinhead instantly meant a racist, however this wasn't the case as one of the skinheads is of Jamaican descent. All in all it's an enjoyable movie if you are looking for something a little different, a fan of British, movies or just want to check out a movie with solid performances and a good story.",1358121600,,728,4.6953125

2922604,5,B000UNYJV8,"In a beautifully honest look at the intimate enticement of Nazi comradeship, `This is England' tells the true story of young twelve year old Shaun; an impressionable `fatherless boy' being raised by his mother in 1980's England.  Shaun is a pudgy, oft teased young boy who craves the attention his deceased father cannot give him.  In the film's opening scenes we see this young kid thrash out at those who verbally aggravate him with a faux sense of confidence.

Inside, Shaun is living in loneliness.

That is, until he meets Woody.  Woody and his friends are a certain breed of skinhead; nothing too abrasive but more embracive of their new young friend.  Shaun is instantly drawn to the idea of friends and the thought that he could have something special and form bonds with these young people.  Woody takes young Shaun under his wing, and all is good and swell until Woody's friend Combo is released from prison.  Combo is abrasive and aggressive and hypnotically manipulative.  He comes home with a ravenous new agenda, one corrupted by racism and a neo-political viewpoint.  This permeates his every word, seething from his lips with an estranging quality.  Instead of being repulsed, like Woody and his friends (which include Milky, who is black), young Shaun is entranced.  Praying on his innate need to please his dead father, Shaun firmly believes that Combo can bring him closer to an intimate understanding of his father, but Combo doesn't even understand his own beliefs.  Combo is just as confused as everyone else, hanging firmly to a conviction he doesn't quite understand.  As their relationship grows, Combo and Shaun both begin to see a clearer reality that explodes in a sequence that is emotionally unsettling yet ultimately inevitable.

With a sharp eye for realism, director/writer Shane Meadows uses his own life lessons to script a film that bleeds with a sense of purpose.  Every frame rests comfortably in an air of discomfort, using the awkward layers of honesty to flesh out a very raw and believable depiction of the devastatingly mental, emotional and physical effects of hatred and misplaced loyalties.

Shane's brilliant direction is accompanied by a stellar ensemble that truly understands every nuance of emotional complexity within their relatable characters.  Young Thomas Turgoose gives a marvelous performance as Shaun.  The way he absorbs the charismatic presence of his cohorts is intensely believable.  You can see the little boy trying to fake being a `big man' in order to fit in with a crowd he doesn't fully understand.  Better yet is Stephen Graham.  His electrifying performance as Combo is breathtaking.  The way he gets the little things (fully fleshing out Combo's own naivety within his sharp outbursts and manipulated convictions is fantastic) just helps layer his every moment on screen.

This man isn't evil, he's just confused.

In the end, `This is England' is a powerful statement piece that plays out like so much more.  It is an intimate drama that unfolds like a personal love story to adolescence, a time of mistakes and misfortunes by most of all, a time of growing up, wising up and eventually becoming a man; your own man.",1325635200,,3189,5.003795066413662

2922606,4,B000UNYJV8,"'This Is England' is a pretty stark and hard hitting look at skin head culture and life in 1980's England. It follows a young boy who becomes friends with a group of skin heads and the things in society that influenced them. It is expertly inter-cut with realtime footage from the Falklands war and other events from 1983 (when this film is set) and the actors are all pretty good at portraying the influences in England at that time. Some of the violence is quite brutal and it is depressing to see such harsh attitudes that were in England then. The main character is quite good in this, his first film, and the rest of the cast add the right mix of naivety (to be influenced so readily) and menace that they needed to have for this story to have it's full impact. This film has been highly lauded and it is very good indeed. It's well worth a viewing, but it can be quite graphic at times. A solid four stars.

Set in 1983 during the Falklands War, it's a autobiography of his youth and how he became a skinhead. There is some real emotion in this flick and I found it very easy to identify with almost every character. Particularly Shaun.

The kid who plays Shaun, Tom Turgoose, does an amazing. What makes it more amazing is that this was his first movie and he had zero acting background. Meadows just saw him one day and offered him the part.",1277337600,,537,4.414141414141414
2922610,5,B000UNYJV8,"First off, i am a skinhead. (i have no need to elaborate on this title. I am too old. and you have a computer. I shouldn't have to explain myself due to others ignorance.) This amazing, energetic, misunderstood sub-culture has little press. The extremes of the culture are fodder for generic sensational stories. (I mean who wants to hear about 50 skins drinking and seeing a band with no violence occurring?).
representation of skins in cinema: Some awful 70's ""Skinhead"", which was in name only; ""Suburbia""; ""Meantime"", ""Made in Britain"", accurate, but scary. And the ultimate in ridiculous, ""American History X"". Despite stunning cinematography from Kaye - phenomenal acting from D'Angelo, Gould and Norton - this script was a glorified After School Special, contingent on a contrived script. Although it does represent the Metzger sub-section, all in all it was silly.
""Made in England"" by Shane Meadows (who was an actual skin) is a strong film. It explores the chasm between pride and ism (nationalism, racism, etc). It is set in the tumultuous 1982 of England. It portrays a fatherless (lost in the Falklands conflict)child, a working mother, and the charismatic draw of a single, struggling man.
When i watched this on the big screen in Newport, i was floored. Here is finally a film that can delve into the nuances of a culture without falling into the tempting traps of sensationalism. Here, there is not nazis and anti-racists; not a clear contrast in ideologies. What there is, is blossoming Nationalism in a time of fear and unknown repercussions.  This dances on the fine line of how confusing a sense of pride can be and the frightening slope that people slip down. We watch these images through the eyes of a child, and it is easy to see how simple this predicament could be. But naivet is no excuse. and the will be consequences. Beautifully shot, Superbly acted; kept taut and tense and morose, Meadows skilfully tells a compelling story.
This film had a scary reverberation in a post 9-11 America. And should serve as a warning. Too bad no Oi bands would attach themselves to this, but a fantastic skinhead reggae soundtrack over images of desolation and war is fun. and to see boots, braces, and Ben Shermans on a big screen that is usually filled with pop culture and vapid people, moved me. i love this film.

This is England is one of the greatest efforts I've yet discovered to completely capture a time and place.  Admittedly I'm an American who never visited 1980s Britain, but the film's gritty yet poignant visuals of urban decay and anti-authority fashion make This is England's self-contained world fascinating and engrossing.

The story of Shaun coming of age in a time and place where love is scarce and comes in sometimes horrific forms is fascinating and told with remarkable restraint.  Beautiful performances make every character, no matter how minor, believable and fascinating.  Shaun comes of age in a way that displays his own turbulence while never losing sight of the ugliness of those already living in the adult world of war and hatred.

This is England is ambitions without being overly contrived.  It tells a small story very well, and takes a very un-pretty idea and makes it immensely compelling.

2922618,5,B000UNYJV8,"Superbly written and directed by Shane Meadows, ""This is England"" provides us with an unflinchingly realistic and grimly depressing look at the skinhead subculture of early 1980's Britain.

Shaun is a twelve-year-old lad who has recently lost his father in the Falklands War.  Even though Shaun has learned to give as good as he gets when the schoolyard and neighborhood bullies go to whaling on him (both verbally and physically), that still doesn't keep him from being ridiculed and harassed on an almost daily basis by kids who are bigger than he is - until, that is, he hooks up with a gang of social delinquents who take him under their wing, drastically altering his appearance and bringing him along on orgies of destruction as part of his initiation.

Although ""This is England"" is harrowing in what it says about a generation caught in an out-of-control spiral of purposelessness, rebelliousness and violence, there is a surprising amount of humor and tenderness in the film as well.  Shaun may be mouthy and obnoxious a good part of the time, but he also possesses a whip-smart sense of humor, a strong instinct for self-preservation, and a wise-beyond-his-years perceptiveness about how life on the street actually works.  In a similar way, even the punks who befriend and corrupt the boy are portrayed as complex, three-dimensional individuals, their occasional displays of charm and decency going a long way towards explaining just why it is that Shaun and even his own well-meaning mother are so easily taken in by them.

The real trouble begins when Combo, a neighborhood troublemaker and now radical ""England for the English"" nationalist, is released from prison and proceeds to infect the group with the idea of ""taking back"" the country from the hordes of dark-skinned ""Pakis"" who have increasingly made their home there.  A gifted rabble rouser, Combo not only exploits working class dissatisfaction with the economy and the war, but appeals to out-and-out racism and xenophobia to win the men over to his side.  This proves too much for a number of the gang's members - including Woody, the nominal leader - who quietly bow out of the scene, but Shaun, still feeling sorely the absense of his father, continues to find a home with the group.

The thing that is most striking about ""This is England"" is how remarkably fleshed-out and true-to-life the characters are, a result stemming as much from Meadows' thoughtful and intelligent screenplay as from the brilliant performances by Thomas Turgoose and Stephen Graham as Shaun and Combo, respectively.  Turgoose has an astonishing ability to be both childlike and strangely adult at one and the same time, while Graham keeps us on edge throughout with his volatile combination of charm, charisma, love of violence and hair-triggered temper.  And there are numerous other first-rate performances in the film as well.

Even though the story, in this case, is played out against the backdrop of bellicose speeches by Margaret Thatcher and file footage of the Falklands War, the themes the movie deals with - the irrational fear of ""the other,"" the radicalization of disaffected youth, the seductive nature of the mob mentality - are sadly universal and relevant to all times and societies.  It is an eye-opening, cautionary tale about where modern society may be heading if we don't learn to see beneath the superficial differences of skin and culture and find the common ground of humanity that unites us all.  It's an old message but one that is delivered with unforgettable force in this film.",1242518400,,3562,5.02546689303905
2922619,5,B000UNYJV8,"First off, the film maker should be commmended for showing that many aspects of the skinhead culture appeal to those who want a sense of belonging, identity, and need for empowerment. Joining a group with a ""hard"" style and outlook provide for this. Many skinhead films solely rely on violent scenes to get this point across, but this film shows how the main character (and the other characters also) was affected by many different emotional influences, like Shaun's loneliness and the violent Combo's sense of his glory days being long gone.

Combo's sense of frustration is given an outlet and validated by the usual nationalistic, ""everyone in the government and minorities are the source of all your problems"" rhetoric that still goes on even today in the U.S. as well as Europe. Of course this leads to a horrifically violent act, and young Shaun shows his sense of being let down by everything that has happened in his life so far at the end of the film.

Sadly, an epiphany such as this is sometimes what is needed during the course of growing up to advance to the next stage of emotional maturity, which is to be secure enough to deal with the disappointment and loneliness that sometimes comes to us in life in a positive way.",1242172800,,1235,4.686635944700461

2922623,3,B000UNYJV8,"This is England came to me highly recommended as a smart, insightful film that told a story of modern history that I agree is worth telling. The problem is, I am left clueless as to what this movie was about. It didn't quite work as political commentary, as history, as a coming of age tale, as a story of the aftermath of grieving and loss, or as a buddy film. Its gaping ramblings about skinhead culture, race relations and changing times during Thatcher's ""reign"" needed more focus and a better script. I think too much was ambitiously aimed at by the makers of This is England, and as a result, what could have been an entertaining tale with a sound message ended up being a scattered, drifting, inexplicably stuttering exercise in missed opportunity. What was worth sticking around for were the performances here by some talented actors, young Thomas Turgoose as the emotionally needy central character, and the charismatic Stephan Graham most of all. Graham's sympathetic lost soul skinhead character, Combo, was in equal parts endearing, repulsive, and fascinating, and if this movie had a saving grace it was to be found in him. Other characters were maddeningly underused, namely Joseph Gilgun's Woody, who seemed poised to be the film's protagonist, but vanished as the plot grew toward its mid-point. This is England is in part inspired by real people and events in its director, Shane Meadow's, life, and I'm sure had much personal meaning to him, but it was still a sadly empty motion picture that did not live up to its billing.",1230076800,5,1542,4.84469696969697

A young boy living with his recently widowed Mom is befriended by a group of fairly benign older kids who are marginally into the skinhead scene. There is an actual warmth about the way they take the younger kid in and get him the clothes and the haircut that helps him fit in. They seem like a likable enough and relatively harmless bunch guilty of nothing more than some vandalism.
The film takes a decidedly ugly turn when a former neighborhood leader returns from prison and the group splits into 2. From that point on the inevitable descent from racist posturing to actual violence is quick and brutally depicted.

2922633,4,B000UNYJV8,"""This is England"" is strong and unsettling in the way powerful and violent literature can often be.  The story is a simple one:  A youngster, Shaun Fields (in a flawless performance by newcomer, Tomo Turgoose), lives with his mother in England after losing his father in the Falklands during the early 1980's.  Bullied, ridiculed, or ignored by his classmates, he is befriended by a gang of skinheads, led by the likeable Woody, (Joe Gilgun).

Shaun's role gradually changes from mascot to convert as he begins participating in increasingly horrifying acts of violence until the movie's brutal climax.

Like literary classics such as ""Native Son"" or ""A Lesson Before Dying,"" ""This is England"" is as much about youthful initiation and class disenfranchisement as it is about racism.  Due to this movie's violent realism, it can be difficult to watch at times, but it captures a period in history, as well as the universality of needing to belong, in a remarkable and unforgettable way.",1203033600,,984,5.04320987654321
2922634,3,B000UNYJV8,"I am a Yank and didn't really understand the historical events and culture surrounding this film. And watched this film partially to educate myself on the whole skinhead culture (perhaps a documentary would've served better). While the first half of the film caught my interest, it ultimately disappointed me as I absolutely hated the ending and felt that it was unnecessary to portray Combo, one of the skinhead's, as an unstable psychopath, rather than someone with an honest political agenda. The focus should never have left the tension between Combo and Woody. This was sort of unresolved and really left me feeling kind of cheated. Felt like the writer eventually got tired of the screenplay, ditched being creative and copped out by appealing to the shock factor.",1199836800,4,770,5.070866141732283
2922635,4,B000UNYJV8,"First of all, I have to say that I enjoyed this film more than any recent film I`ve seen in the past 2 years. Some may say that coming of age is a gentre that`s been done, but This Is England gives it new life. How can you not root for confused pre-teen Shaun? He`s an average kid in 1983 Britain who is befriended by a group of older teens who dress in punk fashions and love reggae music. The early scenes of Shaun and his new friends really convey the jubilation you feel when you`re young and hanging out with peers, however clueless you may be at the time.  All is well until the appearance of ex-con Combo, an older guy who hangs with the neighborhood youth in order to recruit them to racist thinking and the National Front group. Shaun appears to take to his agenda at first, but then the plot goes down another path and there is a more positive ending than one would think.
The film does`nt sugarcoat adolescent behavior-Shaun and cohorts smoke pot and engage in  petty vandalism- but neither does it aim for shock value. Every character is just amazingly real, an archetype of people we`ve all grown up with, no matter where you live or what kind of music you like. Extra points for the soundtrack- lots of Toots & the Maytals. And yes, we learn a bit about the politics of 80`s England, which is fascinating since you don`t always hear about recent history in Europe or America. An underrated gem I know I`ll watch many times.",1199232000,11,1437,4.398496240601504
2922636,4,B000UNYJV8,"That's what I said to the person who suggested this film to me.  Then, I got a history lesson.  Turns out, the original or 'Traditional' skinheads in Great Britain were a multi-racial bunch. Reggae was even one of their primary choices of music.

Shaun (Tomo Turgoose) is going through a tough period in his life. He just lost his Dad in the Falklands War, and he's understandably not doing too well. Unfortunately, a wardrobe malfunction makes him the target of a group of kids needing someone to pick on.

Shaun finds friendship and respect in a skinhead gang. At the time, the gang's led by Jamaican, Woody. Later, the original leader of the gang Combo returns from prison and he's gained a whole new racist agenda there.

Still, Woody is welcome and even a Black member can join, because Combo sees his agenda as anti-Pakistani.

""This is England"" covers a lot of painful and controversial territory:  student bullying, gangs, racism, war.  It's not an easy watch--but a good one.

I think the characterization is some of the best I have seen in British films.  Shaun, Woody, even Combo come alive on the screen.  And yes, Shaun grows up--getting older and wiser, but still looking like a cherubic innocent.

2922639,5,B000UNYJV8,"This Is England, the fifth feature film by Shane Meadows (whose debut feature was the 1998 boxing drama Twentyfour Seven), is set in the summer of 1983 and concerns an 11-year-old boy named Shaun (played by newcomer Thomas Turgoose) whose father has recently been killed in the Falkland Islands war. In the course of the story, the boy grows up mighty fast as he falls in with a couple of gangs.

First, lonely Shaun is befriended by a fun-loving bunch of skinheads led by the affable Woody (Joe Gilgun). Woody and his mates are a likable and fairly harmless lot, and their scenes together are quite entertaining. But the party doesn't last forever: Soon a rift forms in the group when their old friend Combo (Stephen Graham) returns from a stint in prison transformed into a nationalistic neo-Nazi, and Shaun chooses to side with his seething posse.

In the hands of lesser talents, Combo might have been portrayed as a one-dimensional racist monster, and it would be a total mystery as to why Shaun would be drawn to him. But it's a credit to both actor Graham and screenwriter Meadows that there's so much more to the character: Combo is handsome and charismatic, he sympathizes with the fatherless Shaun, and though cursed with a frightening, hair-trigger temper, he also shows vulnerability; furthermore, even if you don't approve of his rants or how he terrorizes the local Pakistani immigrants, at least you can sense the frustration and fear behind his words and deeds. Indeed, the entire cast is uniformly strong; Turgoose, Gilgun, and Graham are the dominant figures here, but the many fine supporting players include Jo Hartley as Shaun's caring mother, Andrew Shim as Woody's Afro-Jamaican pal Milky, and Vicky McClure as Combo's former girlfriend Lol.

I must note that, while TIE is an undeniably personal story for Meadows (it was mostly inspired by incidents from the British writer-director's own childhood), you don't have to be a Brit who grew up in the '80s to appreciate it; for one thing, the notion of the gang-as-surrogate-family is timeless and universal. Also, when Combo rages about unemployment, cheap immigrant labor, a ""fake war,"" and needing to ""fight"" to take back his country, it hits uncomfortably close to home. (Much as I hate to say it, just replace the references to ""Pakis"" with ""Mexicans,"" Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with President Bush, and the Falkland Islands with Iraq, and such scenes could almost be taking place here in the US today.)

As Shaun falls further under Combo's influence, what started as a funny and sweet (if gritty) coming-of-age tale becomes as disturbing and powerful as Meadows' previous feature, the 2004 anti-revenge thriller Dead Man's Shoes. When I first caught DMS on DVD earlier this year (my first exposure to Meadows' work), I thought that it was nearly as good as anything by fellow Brit Mike Leigh (whose films I've admired for their realistic, emotionally rich style) and that Meadows was a talent worth keeping an eye on. TIE only further confirms my initial opinions of the guy, and I will be looking forward to any projects he has planned for the future.",1197504000,3,3138,4.9375
2922640,4,B000UNYJV8,"Shane Meadows' semi-autobiographical story of a dejected pubescent boy's transformation into a skinhead in recession-wracked England of 1983 earned ""This Is England"" top honors at the 2006 British Independent Film Awards. Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) is a defiant and cocksure 12-year-old who recently lost his father in the Falklands War. Surrounded by unemployment, malaise, and picked on at school, he finds companionship and an outlet for his frustrations among a group of skinheads whose leader, Woody (Joe Gilgun), takes the boy under his wing. This seems harmless until violent, insecure Combo (Stephen Graham) rejoins his fellow skins after a 3-year stint in prison, shattering the group's camaraderie with racism and crime.

""This Is England"" dives into the skinhead counterculture that gave working-class young people a place to belong and share their dissatisfaction. Unemployment and a poor economy made them susceptible to the inflammatory rhetoric of the National Front, causing skinheads to be associated with racism and violence in the popular consciousness. The two stand-out performances are, not surprisingly, the most emotionally charged characters. Thomas Turgoose is completely natural as a foul-mouthed, moody youngster -who looks closer to 9 than 12. Stephen Graham makes Combo's instability and insecurity menacing, always in danger of erupting. I found the poor quality DV out of place in the period setting and less than this film deserves. But the fine performances are worthwhile. The only bonus feature on the IFC DVD (2007) is a theatrical trailer. No subtitles.",1197331200,10,1588,5.56198347107438
2922641,4,B000UNYJV8,"This movie touches on a subject that isn't too well known amongst the general public. The concept of what a traditional skinhead is vs. a neo-nazi, and when the traditional skinhead movement turned into a political mess during the 1980's, and the Falklands being only a part of what caused a lot of the political chaos amongst the working class, the patriots, and the youth.

The story is told through the life of a young fatherless boy who lost his father in the Falklands war that befriends a group of traditional skinheads. He is tired of being picked on, and he's tired of being bullied. He's a loner, and the traditional skinhead group he meets become part of his family. When the group encounters Gumbo, a former member of the group, it's a world that the young boy never imagined, and a divide occurs between the traditional skinhead gang and Gumbo's National Front inspired movement.

I have to say that I found the story to be a little bit more realistic than ""American History X,"" and a little bit more educational. The soundtrack to this film is also very fitting, and the soundtrack of traditional ska and northern soul music is wonderful. The characters in the film are also great, esp. the black skinhead, Milky.

2922642,3,B000UNYJV8,"I agree with one of the other reviewers that this is the most accurate portrayal of the skinhead cult to date, but considering the other ""skinhead"" movies, that's not saying much. I was heartened to see that most of the skins in this movie were trads - those who do not subscribe to the racist/nationalist rubbish of the NF and other hate groups. However, I think that many who are trad skins or former trad skins have been blinded by the fact that this movie portrays some skins in a positive light. It's such a refreshing novelty that it may lead one to ignore all the shortcomings of the film. If you take the skinhead equation out of it and just look at this as a film - pretend all the characters are just ""ordinary kids"" not affiliated with any controversial youth cult - it's hard to argue that it doesn't come up short. The plot is thin and, other than the main character, Shaun, so is the character development. Woody, probably the most important living character in the film, basically drops out of the picture once Combo arrives on the scene. The whole thing is a bit amateurish and undeveloped. It's as if the novelty of making an honest film about skinheads allowed so many other blanks to be left unfilled.",1195430400,9,1220,4.5
2922643,5,B000UNYJV8,"A hard-hitting, naturalistic ""social drama"" reminiscent of the work of Ken Loach and British ""angry young man"" films of the early 60s (with a slight whiff of ""A Clockwork Orange"") ""This is England"" is set against the backdrop of the Thatcher era, circa 1983. The story (reported to be loosely auto-biographical, based on the director's Midlands upbringing) centers around a glum, alienated 12 year-old named Shaun (first-time film actor Thomas Turgoose, in an extraordinary performance) who can't seem to fit in with any of the cliques at his school. Shaun presents a real handful to his loving but somewhat exasperated mother (Jo Hartley),a working-class Falklands War widow who does her best to support herself and her son. After a particularly bad day of being bullied about by teachers and schoolmates, happenstance leads Shaun into the midst of a skinhead gang.

Shaun's initial apprehension is quickly washed away when the sympathetic and good-natured gang leader Woody (Joe Gilgun) takes him under his wing and offers him an unconditional entre into their little club. Shaun's weary working mum is initially not so crazy about his new pals, but after sizing them up decides essentially to leave her son in their care. Some may feel that this development strains credibility, but I think it's a pragmatic decision. Her son has no siblings, no close friends,and is suffering from the loss of his father; perhaps this surrogate family will give him what she cannot provide.

The idyll is soon shattered, however, when the gang's original leader, Combo (Stephen Graham) is released from prison. Combo's return causes a rift that divides the gang; his jailhouse conversion to racist National Front ideals doesn't settle well with Woody and his supporters, and they break off on their own. Shaun decides to stay on after forming an instant bond with the thuggish Combo, who easily parlays the impressionable Shaun's grief over his father into a blame-shifting hatred of immigrants, with tragic results.

The film works successfully on several levels; as a cautionary tale, a history lesson and a riveting drama. As cautionary tale, it demonstrates how easily the neglected and disenfranchised can be recruited and indoctrinated into the politics of hate. As a history lesson, it's a fascinating glimpse at a not-so-long ago era of complex politics and social upheaval in Great Britain. As a riveting drama, it features some very believable and astounding performances, particularly from the aforementioned young Turgoose and Graham, who positively owns the screen with his charismatic intensity.

2922645,4,B000UNYJV8,"""This is England"" is a riveting story about a lonely young boy who lost his father in the Falkland War and who turns to a group of young ""skinheads"" for kicks and friendship.  All of the kids are tough troublemakers who get the kid, Shaun, involved in activities that no twelve year old should be involved in, but they are depicted as mainly a good group of kids, who don't have much besides each other and so really care about each other.  They are into music and drinking and the occasional ""spliff"" but aren't haters and don't like violence.  That is, until  the return of an old friend who spent three years in prison and acquired a violent and totalitarian and racist streak, and tries to recruit the ""gang"" for his own ""political"" activities.  Shaun, who is apparently based on the director's own past, has to make a choice, and the film is about how that choice will profoundly affect his young life.  The film also draws an ironic connection between the colonialist activities of England overseas and the xenophobic and nationalistic tendencies of the homegrown skinheads.  The music is perfect, and the film should be seen for the soundtrack alone; the filmmakers do a nice job tying the story to documentary footage from the era and seem to have created a spot on characterization of the period; the film is hard to watch, especially because everything that happens is happening to or is directly participated in by a twelve year old boy; and the language, while presumably authentic, is extremely harsh (both in the sense of its extraordinarily prolific usage of a word that begins with f, and in the sense of being hard for at least these ears to discern fully due to the heaviness of the regional accents).  Still, if you like your films to open you up to a different world, and to be honest in their depiction of that world whether it is comfortable or not, and if you appreciate thoughtful filmmakers who take risks and who push in small ways the envelope of commercial filmmaking, then this is definitely one to watch.",1192752000,3,2034,4.662011173184357

I say the first half because by the time I got into the 'scene' all of the Nazi skinheads had been run out of the area or went very underground. Never really had to deal with them thankfully. The follow-up TV series' are fantastic as well.
Everything about this film shines, from the performances by all involved, to the attention to detail such as the clothing, and of course the fantastic reggae/ska/2 Tone soundtrack. This one (and the TV series' as well) will tug you in several different directions emotionally. There's very few films out there that have moved me as this one has. There's plenty of fun and humor to be had, especially in the first half when Shaun meets up with Woody and his crew. Things take a decidedly darker turn once the fresh-out-of-jail Combo shows up with his newfound racist and nationalist views. But even Combo is shown as a complex character that is deeper than you're average 'bonehead'. Not that his ideology is of any merit...but his character is written in such a way that the audience is given a chance to somewhat understand, If not agree with why he is how he is. He could've ended up a very one-dimensional character and I think the film is better for not portraying him that way.
As I mentioned, this is a top 5 film for me, and one I can watch weekly amd still enjoy every time. I will admit that sometimes I do just watch the first half as  once Combo shows up it definitely takes a much darker turn and im not always in the mood for that.
I also want to give kudos to the seller I ordered this from used....quick shipping and the disc/case as described. I was pretty surprised to find a damn-near like-new copy of this film in Region 1 for a fair price.",1481673600,,1845,4.3790087463556855
