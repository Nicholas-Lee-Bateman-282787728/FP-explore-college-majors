8302997,5,B001FXG1Y0,When i first saw Gundam Seed Destiny the whole series i ask myself why the hell did the creators decide to put so many flash backs that were over used even in seed and not only that they used massive repeated animation which was unacceptable in the era this anime was made.so yes overall the series was a disaster the only thing great about destiny the series was the amazing openings 1-3 the 4th opening was horrible also the sountracks were great and the ending themes were awesome.okay enough about the series lets talk about the destiny movies which puts the series to shame and puts on par with Gundam 00. Gundam Seed Destiny Tv Movies are simply amazing it cuts all the useless filler the series had and the animation gets a huge buff digitally looking lke 00 in some areas with great detail and the 5.1 surround sound is great.,1322611200,,834,4.493421052631579

8302999,4,B001FXG1Y0,"The third movie that re-tells the Gundam Seed Destiny series covers episodes 29-42. In other words all the major events from battling the Destroy Gundam in Berlin, Shinn in the Impulse taking down Kira in the Freedom, Athrun's desertion, the battle at Heavens Base and the start of ZAFT's attack on Orb. During all this the Destiny, Legend and Strike Freedom Gundams as well as the Akatsuki are introduced into the story. The movie ends when Athrun launches in the Infinite Justice Gundam for the first time.

The only flaw I found in this movie was the scenes with Neo Roanoke being a prisoner on the Archangel being cut. We see him unconscious in Berlin and then the next time we see him is when he's being freed by Murrue Ramius. It just left you with the feeling that something was missing. Other than that this was my second favorite of the four special edition movies for Destiny. The first movie was good, but since it covered the first, best part of the series there were a lot of things that weren't in it that I thought should be. The episodes covered in this movie however are around the point in the series when we started getting vast amounts of flashback montages, plus two of the episodes were pure clip shows. So trust me when I say that you won't be missing anything important from the series.

In the Special Editions some new things are added and some things are changed, redrawn. Mostly many parts of the battles were redrawn, changed a bit which I'm all for. The animation quality is always much better in the Special Editions compared to the series. Some interesting things were Rey's dialogue being changed when he's shooting at Athrun in the hanger for example. In the series he goes on about Athrun being a traitor, but now he says something like, ""We no longer have any use for you,"" making him appear more evil. I also liked that they cut Shinn leaving in the middle of his battle with the Strike Freedom to return to the Minerva for maintaince and repairs. I thought that was stupid to begin with.

When the credits start rolling at the end we hear a new song by High and Mighty Color, ""Enrai-Tooku ni Aru Akari."" It's a really awesome song! You won't be disapointed by this quicker telling of Gundam Seed Destiny.",1250985600,2,2242,4.544554455445544

The tv movies otherwise known in Japan as the special editions have extra footage and alternate takes of how the characters experienced the situations depicted. In this volume the viewer is treated to how Shinn viewed the events and the results of his decisions. For Kira and Athrun fans, taking it from Shinn's vantage point equals less scenes of your favorites so keep that in mind. High and Mighty color provides the ending theme for this Volume this time, so please look forward to it.",1230422400,2,552,4.642857142857143
