3873381,4,B0028RY4LE,"i bought this on amazon.com because it was unavailable in the UK. it took just a week to come. My son and daughter adore george and this was a nice little follow up film for their birthdays. Its not as good as the first but its a nice story that will keep them entertained. its a shame they used different voices for the second film, i don't think the children notice but i miss dick van dykes voice :) the following week it was on Virgin movie channel so i neednt have bothered buy it, now i have the dvd copy and a recording.",1272585600,,527,4.076923076923077

3873384,2,B0028RY4LE,"We purchased this movie because our 2 and a half year old loves Corious George.  I mean LOVES.. watches it several times a day (thanks Tivo).. but for some reason this Movie took three viewings to watch it all the way through.  Each time we would watch from where we left off.

Don't know what is going on there but I think it's that there is way too much dialog.  In the first movie that had a large budget all of the movie was well done.. lots of musical elements and it didn't seem like crazy amounts of dialog.  Always something going on... however in this movie that is just not the case at all.

We have only watched this all the way through once.. which makes it not worth the money.  The first movie we have seen hundreds of times.. and all of the episodes as well.  If you are looking for a Curious George movie get the first one and the Christmas one.",1270598400,4,861,4.175757575757576

3873386,4,B0028RY4LE,"I absolutely, completely and totally am in love with this adorable little monkey. Curious George is the epitome of a fun loving, spontaneous toddler. He has a heart of gold...but trouble seems to find him no matter how good his intentions.

The IE Twins have watched this numerous time and each time have been excited about our adventure. Laughing, cautioning and cheering George on throughout every step of his adventure.

George's heart of gold leads him to the aid and rescue of a baby elephant. George meets her when The Man With a Yellow Hat takes her (unwillingly) to see a Magic Show. George is enthralled and of course becomes part of the act...only to find a little sad baby elephant.

The rest of the DVD allows you to journey with George and The Man With a Yellow Hat as they find the baby elephant's family.  A sweet happy ending is offered when the baby finds her family.

Definitely a keeper!",1268438400,2,906,4.60248447204969
3873387,1,B0028RY4LE,"This movie is a direct sequel to the Curious George movie and has some of the same characters, such as Ivan the Doorman and Mr. Bloomsbury, the owner of the museum. The Man With The Yellow Hat is voiced by the same person who voices the character in the PBS series.

As a parent, I am extremely disappointed in this sequel. What kind of kids' movie mentions *murder* and has a *kidnapping* theme??? There isn't an actual murder, but why bring it up so little kids can ask about that word? (It's brought up by the security guy character, voiced by Jamie Kennedy, who is investigating the disappearance of a circus elephant)

Unlike the PBS series, The Man With The Yellow Hat does not keep his cool or patience. He yells at George and freaks out several times.

There is not nearly enough George and way too much of The Man freaking out and of Matt Lauer reporting on an elephant kidnapping. The character the kids love in this series is George, yet you'd think he was a supporting character with how little we see of him and his antics.

We loved the original movie and adore the PBS series, but I do not recommend this movie.",1267833600,81,1126,4.42512077294686
3873388,5,B0028RY4LE,"Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey is a fantastic follow up to the 2006 original. Curious George meets a new friend, Kayla, a homesick elephant who wants to see her family again. Together, with the Man in the Yellow Hat, they embark on a cross-country adventure where comedy and adventure ensue. I thoroughly enjoyed George's new adventure. I would even say I enjoyed this movie more than the original. The animation is bright, vivid and fluid. Carbon Leaf who provided the songs for this sequel fit harmoniously with the story and the world of Curious George. The highlight of the soundtrack is ""The Friendship Song"" when George and Kayla first meet. The voice actors do a nice job giving life to these wonderful characters; you just can't help but smile when hearing George's coos. I HIGHLY recommend any fan of Curious George, family movies, and/or animation to add Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey into their collection. Hopefully we will continue to see our favorite curious little monkey on many more big adventures.",1267488000,9,1028,4.9479768786127165
3873389,5,B0028RY4LE,"The popular curious monkey is back once again in another adventure along with Ted and a new friend named Kayla in a cross-country adventure filled with action and humor!

With the success of the first ""Curious George"" film back in 2006, the popular character from the children stories by H.A. and Margret Rey makes his return to the sequel ""Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey"" in a direct-to-DVD release (note: the film made its world premiere last Summer in several countries) from Universal Studios Home Entertainment.

In ""Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey"", Mr. Bloombsberry wants Ted (played by Jeff Bennett) to become the next museum director.  Excited about his job, he now needs to impress the museum's Board of Director's and has been too busy focusing on his work.  With the Piccadilly Circus coming to town, George wants Ted to take him to the circus and Maggie wants Ted to spend more time with her.  But he is too focused on working on his presentation.

But nevertheless, he feels he does owe it to George to take him to the Piccadilly Circus and somehow, the two get selected to go up on stage by the magician Piccadilly (played by Tim Curry).  But George as curious as ever, ends up at the bottom of the stage and meets a new friend named Kayla, an elephant from the circus who has the talent of juggling and ends up breaking him out of the circus.  Government investigators led by Danno Wolfe (played by Jamie Kennedy) are called in to find out on what happened to Kayla the elephant and why its missing.  Meanwhile, George is missing as well.

George and Kayla end up walking through the city together with George taking back Kayla to his home.  George and Kayla then watch a newscast in which Hark Hanson (played by NBC's ""Today Show"" host Matt Lauer) talks about the missing elephant and how he lived in California with his siblings.  George realizes that Kayla is homesick and missing his family.  Meanwhile, as a search for the elephant continues and news reports saying that the elephant was stolen, Ted goes back home and finds out that George and Kayla have been at the residence all this time.  This is the last thing he needs to deal with because he has to prepare for his presentation to the museum Board of Directors.

But before he can make the call to have Kayla returned, George decides to help Kayla go back home to California by going to the train station.  And thus, Ted goes after them and finds the two inside a train box car.  As he tries to convince them that they need to get out of the box car, the train starts moving and the next thing you know, the three are stuck inside and now are being taken cross country in the middle of nowhere.

Meanwhile, the investigation starts to center on Ted as the main suspect in Kayla's disappearance and people including Ted's boss Mr. Bloomsberry and even Maggie believe there must be a reason why Ted may have escaped with Kayla.  Ted knows he's in a deep mess but hopefully he can clear his name.  But for George, all he wants is to make sure Kayla the elephant sees his brother and sister.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey"" is featured in anamorphic widescreen (1:78:1).  Featuring the same vibrant style and painted backgrounds along with CG incorporated from the first film, ""Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey"" manages to capture the characters and the world of ""Curious George"" quite well.  Featuring a pretty colorful pallet, and beautiful artistic backgrounds, fans of the first film will no doubt enjoy the animation used in the sequel.

As for audio, audio is presented in English Dolby Digital 5.1 and Spanish and French Dolby Digital 2.0.  Audio quality is nice and clear, dialogue is understandable and music is also crystal clear through the front and center channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey"" comes with the following special features:

  * Curious George's Cross Country Caper Game - Using your DVD remote control, you can help George and Kayla travel throughout the country safely.
  * ""Hold On, Here We Go"" Music Video - (2:25) Featuring an animated video with clips from the film.
  * DVD-Rom - By playing the DVD on a computer (DVD-Rom Drive), you can access printable coloring pages, wallpapers and more.
  * Bonus TV episodes - Featuring two never-before-seen TV episodes (around 12 minutes each) from the new TV season of ""Curious George"" - ""A Monkey's Duckling"" in which a baby duckling thinks George is its mother.  In ""George's Super Subway Adventure"", George as curious as always, hops aboard a subway in the city without Ted and thus Ted tries to go after him.

JUDGMENT CALL:

In my household, ""Curious George"" has been a big part of my young son's upbringing.  From the animated television series, to the coloring books, reading books and the first film, I watched ""Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey"" alongside with him and he absolutely loved it and giggling at many parts of the film.

As for me, I enjoyed the film.  As usual, George's curiosity tends to get Ted in a bit of a bind and in this case, a fun adventure throughout the country. The sequel also features a good number of talent such as Tim Curry as Picadilly the magician, Jamie Kennedy as investigator ""Danno"" Wolfe, Matt Lauer as news host Hark Hanson, Jerry Lewis as the stationmaster, Frank Welker as a cow, Amy Hill as a flower pot lady and many others with short vocal cameos.

Where the first film featured adventure and the romance between Ted and Maggie,  there is less of the relationship factor between the two adults but focusing on the adventure of Ted, George and Kayla ad featuring a message to those  who tend to put work ahead of their love ones. But for the most part, this is a fun ""Curious George"" film.

In a parent standpoint, for me...I felt the film was quite safe but there is one segment in the film which Ted, George and Kayla meet new friends who own a farm and the son of the farmer is jumping high and landing in a haystack and then they all take part in the jumping of the haystack.  My son thought that was such a cool thing and wondered if he can go up high and land on things and thus, it's important to talk to your child about those type of situations and making sure that he/she knows that they can't jump high from anything and land on whatever.

As for the DVD, it's a pretty entertaining and educational DVD with a game, DVD-Rom features such as coloring pages and wallpaper, two never-before-seen TV episodes and more.

Overall, ""Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey"" is just as entertaining as the original animated film.  A lot of fun, humor, beautiful and vibrant animation and both myself and my seven-year-old enjoyed the film/DVD and I imagine parents and their children would enjoy this DVD release as well!  Definitely recommended!",1267488000,28,6874,4.661410788381743

My son LOVES the fact that he gets George AND a sweet and silly elephant named Kayla all in the same movie.

The characters are cute and I like that the songs are easy to listen too and pleasant to listen too.  Some of the fast-moving train scenes present some perilous moments, but what would a road-trip movie be without a little taste of adventure? The Man with the Yellow Hat falls from a cliff (but is saved by an elephant). More peril when characters parachute from a plane; nobody is hurt. There are some themes of abandonment and separation from family, but everyone is brought together for a happy ending.

3873469,4,B0028RY4LE,"This is my 2nd least favorite of all curious George movies. Least favorite is the 1st movie. And that rating is based largely on my child's lack of interest to this movie. My 2 year old absolutely LOVES all of the Curious George episodes on PBS. He LOVES LOVES LOVES the 3rd movie and the Christmas movie. In fact we play that repeatedly every day and he never gets bored of it. However this movie is hard to grab his attention.

Why 4 stars: The man in the yellow hat, Tim's personality is quite more obnoxious than what is depicted in the later movies and shows. The animation is better than the 1st movie but not nearly as impressive as the later movies. And the plot is 4 out of 5 stars.

But this movie is better than many of the child's movies today and as such I am giving it a 4 star.",1456790400,,792,4.136363636363637

3873492,5,B0028RY4LE,"I bought this and Curious George 3 at the same time because they both aired on PBS last week.  My oldest just started school so he had to miss them and this was a ""reward"" for making it through his first ever week of school.  I had only promised him the 3rd movie, but it seemed so strange to have the 1st and 3rd movies without the 2nd one, so this made it into the cart as well.  It was a good thing, too!  The kids ended up liking this one better than Curious George 3.  Although both movies are entertaining, this one has a part where George is teased by the ""bad guy"" and George ends up getting what he wants... basically because he's a monkey.  For some reason, the kids LOVE that part.  They laugh like crazy and ask how George did it.

The ""bad guy"" isn't really a bad guy but more of a guy that you just REALLY don't like because he does everything bad and uses inaccurate or incomplete information to make a bad decision.

The voice of Ted is back to Jeff Bennett which is the voice in the tv shows (not the voice in the first movie which was Will Ferrell).  For me, that is good because I like the voice played in the tv show and have come to know it as ""the man in the yellow hat"".  For the kids, I don't think they really care.

It was a little weird seeing Ted put work ahead of George, though, and although the story line was trying to teach kids about the importance of loved ones, etc., I don't know if my kids completely understood the reasoning of why Ted was even preoccupied with work to begin with.  (My kids are pretty young.)  The journey was fun and entertaining, though, which is what I was expecting from the movie.  There really wasn't anything scary in it for the kids (although I was very surprised at the scene with Ted chasing after the train... the kids seemed to expect a happy result so they weren't shocked in the least)... and obviously you don't have to worry about bad words or inappropriate scenes.  So... good movie overall.",1440374400,2,1965,4.227882037533512

However, I have to agree with one of the other mom's reviews I saw after I purchased this.  There is a scene towards the beginning that uses the word ""murder.""  Now, it's a short scene and they don't talk about it much, but it is said once and repeated.  Basically, a detective gets mad at the Man in the Yellow Hat (did anyone else know his name was Ted?) and asks if Murder would just not be a big deal and then Ted says ""Murder?!""  It's hard to describe if you don't know what's going on but it's one of those things where if you didn't have kids you probably wouldn't even pick up on it and think it's completely g rated, but then when you have kids you realize, ""oh, my child is going to either repeat the word or start asking what it means"" and then you wonder why they even put that line in there for such an innocent film?  It's a line that could have been take out and was not necessary at all because nothing even remotely close to a murder or death in general is in the movie at all.  Overall still a good movie, but they just shouldn't have put that line in the movie.",1417564800,4,1252,4.1193415637860085

Different animation and not the same as the other movies.  George sounded the same, but that was it.  Really he likes the pace of the more education movies and the show.  Not a great story line & wasn't easy for him to follow.  This film introduced a bad guy (on Curious George?  Really?) & we're just not into that.

With our luck, the DVD had the same ones we've been watching over and over again, on our local station. When I finally got tired of the repeats, I figured I'd give amazon a shot.

Unfortunately it's nothing like the TV series, which I love for its simplicity and elegance.

This is more like a run-of-the-mill Hollywood action movie: there are the good guys (which includes George) and the bad guys; the bad guys are chasing the good guys in a big pursuit; the situation seems desperate; but at the end the good guys win and the bad guys lose.

3873620,5,B0028RY4LE,"With so many detailed reviews I don't really need to offer another.  I will say that this is one of the few movies/shows available to stream on Netflix that I can put on for both my 2 year old and my 7 year old. I was surprised at how much my 7 year old still enjoyed this! The adventure appeals to him, and he can really get into some of the more intense themes, but meanwhile my 2 year old is not bothered or scared by anything in this.  He absolutely loves this and asks for it daily. We have always loved all things Curious George, and so this is an easy ""go-to"" for us.  I think the music is really catchy too, and find myself singing along.  One negative review mentioned that it was inappropriate, but I agree with another reviewer that it just goes over their heads anyway.  I did cringe when the word ""murder"" was mentioned only because my 2 year old is right into that repeating stage, but have not heard anything about that....yet. He did however tell us at dinner about a guy who shot a baby elephant the other day(they ""catch"" Kayla at one point with a gun that shoots a net).  It took me a minute to figure out that he was talking about this movie and not the graphic National Geographic magazine about elephant poaching that we have kicking around the house! I don't believe in over sheltering the kiddos really.  Don't get me wrong, we are not watching horror movies here, but with an older boy who is way into star wars and the military, being able to put on Curious George and have them both engaged is a relief, and I am not at all concerned with the subtle points that are in this movie that may be a concern for some parents.

3873644,4,B0028RY4LE,"I started to watch this movie when my 3 year old grandson started to watch it.  It has succeeded Toy Story 3 as his favorite movie.  He seems to love to watch George, and Kayla the co-starring elephant, endlessly.

I was underwhelmed the first time I watched it, probably because the animation wasn't particularly interesting.  But the story and depth of character are really very good.  The story has many clever moments in the style of a comedy of errors which should hold an adults attention through multiple viewings.  The villian, who in this movie is the investigator who invents the crime of kidnapping through his over-zealous sense of criminal suspicion, has become one of my favorite comic criminals. The voice actors in this movie seem to create characters that are both believable and familiar mild stereotypes typical of whatever genre you want to call this type of movie.  The music is catchy and uplifting which is appropriate for this type of movie.",1320624000,,965,4.883435582822086
3873645,5,B0028RY4LE,"You're probably looking at this b/c you've got kids, so you don't have extra time. Let's start.

1) There's a monkey. Not just any monkey, tho, it's Curious George, whom my 2yo loves to watch on PBS during the week. Although just any monkey might have sufficed. Hard to say.

2) There's an elephant...who appears out of a BUBBLE. My 2yo loves elephants & blowing bubbles. Combining the two simply results in the most fabulous concept ever. Period. (To add to it, eventually there are THREE elephants!)

3) There's a train, & the monkey & elephant ride on it. My 2yo LOVES trains.

So, as you can see, the above results in the toddler trifecta for the perfect movie ever made...at least for my 2yo.

Here's why I can stand it.

1) I've always loved Curious George, & this is a not-annoying cartoon sequel, unlike what the Disney franchise likes to crank out.

2) The music is surprisingly decent, even borderline good. I find myself singing along while my 2yo is watching.

3) It is the ONLY thing (indoors) that will hold my toddler's attention for longer than 15 mins. Not even Legos or Sesame Street can boast that accomplishment.

4) It's available on Netflix streaming (as of the time of this review). Um...awesome.

5) The bad guys aren't really bad...just socially awkward & perhaps lacking some intelligence.

6) ""Scary"" things happen, but my toddler knows that it will be resolved satisfactorily, so she doesn't get scared. There's no death or heavy emotional challenges. No trauma (unlike Disney, again).

7) And there's no romance! I really appreciate that. I get tired of children's movies feeling a romantic element is necessary on some scale. Not all do it, but enough do that it gets annoying. This doesn't have it, & I like that.

8) Yes, the story's full of holes, but it doesn't matter. My toddler can't tell, & the story remains cute & engaging.

9) It's 80 mins long. Perfect.

10) We haven't seen the first movie, but this stands alone, just like the books.

So overall, it's a very cute, acceptable movie that I'm comfortable letting my toddler watch. It reaffirms the concepts of friendship, filial love, & doing the right thing. It's not perfect, but it doesn't have to be. I'd definitely recommend it for little ones.",1319760000,19,2241,4.722365038560412
3873646,5,B0028RY4LE,"This is a really good kid's movie.
In the first movie, The Man With The Yellow hat's voice is done by Will Ferrell, and in this one it is done by the same voice as the PBS series. I think it is better that that way for the sake of continuity.
As for the Man's behavior, isn't it only appropriate that he is stressed out over his current work situation and the fact that his monkey wandered off with an elephant on a train headed for California? Kids see us (adults) handle life's stress and can relate to how George feels as he has to deal with the Man's stress. I don't think he lashes out at George or ""freaks"" out any more then the average, NORMAL, adult.
My three-year-old has watched this movie over a hundred times and has never once asked me about what kidnapping or murder is, but when he does, I will respond with the truth, since these things do happen in real life, why not deal with it when the source is a harmless movie?
In response to the ""talentless band"" who preforms the music for this movie, I think they are great. The songs are appropriate for the feeling of each scene and are really very good. So they aren't ""mainstream"" but they are good.
Over all, I think this is a wonderful movie for any child who enjoys the PBS series.",1318809600,,1248,4.2478991596638656

3873649,3,B0028RY4LE,"I watched this movie initially on Netflix because my autistic 5 year old son is in a Curious George phase and the first movie was not available to Instant Stream.  He loved the music and the story, and honestly, I really enjoyed it as well so we bought it on DVD for watching in the car.  There are some very funny lines, even for adults, and it's a nice sweet story with not terribly detailed, but beautiful animation.

3873654,1,B0028RY4LE,"I wonder how many of the reviewers saw Curious George read on Captain Kangaroo. I did. It is my seminal experience with George, most closely resembling the creature in the books by the Reys. Suffice to say, this is not your Captain's George. Somewhere over the years, George, an animal whose curiosity landed him in one predicament after another and from which the human, his friend the Man in the Yellow Hat, repeatedly extricated him, has metamorphosed into a socially conscious being who has to overcome the random acts of irresponsibility of the human. This movie is a sad travesty of the Curious George penned by H.A. Rey and Margaret Rey.
As a final note, my two year old grandson, who loves George, watched all of ten minutes, and then asked to go to the park.",1290816000,7,767,4.647058823529412
3873655,1,B0028RY4LE,"This movie was unbelievably bad.  While I echo the sentiments expressed in other one-star reviews regarding the topics of inappropriate subject matter (""murder"" and ""kidnapping"" and wanton law-breaking by the Man with the Yellow Hat), I have other criticism to add.

The story was completely disjointed and ridiculous.  This movie lacked by a longshot the charm, depth and sensitivity of its fore-runner and is instead an absurd caper movie looking for cheap, predictable laughs from young kids.

We lost the voices of Will Ferrell (Man with the Yellow Hat--replaced by the PBS series' M w/ YH voice, at a much lower cost, I'm certain) and Drew Barrymore from the first movie.  In their absence, there was--as was mentioned in other reviews--too much emphasis placed on the worthless Jamie Kennedy/Mr. Wolf investigator character.  It's as if the movie's producers are admitting that they went ultra-low budget on this sequel and decided to over-use the only ""semi-hip"" star whose voice was utilized.  (Way over-the-hill Tim Curry and Jerry Lewis must have come aboard at a very low price, if only to get the work.  And, Matt Lauer's reporter character was also useless and over-used.)  The end result is a bunch of cheap, slapstick-based laughs and a bad story in which the lovable George sadly becomes nothing more than a supporting character.

And, perhaps the hardest pill of all to swallow was that the wondrous, melodic music of Jack Johnson from the first movie is replaced by some horrible, shrill music from some unknown, talentless band.  (Again, I'm sure that a bargain was had by the producers.)

The producers--who include Ron Howard--should be completely ashamed of themselves for producing this low-budget, worthless piece of crap movie that trades only on the good name of Curious George.  H.A. and Margret Rey must be rolling over in their graves.",1290729600,7,1864,5.092105263157895
3873656,2,B0028RY4LE,"I watched the debut of this on PBS with my 3 children 6, 5, and 3.  I was upset by the bad decisions the man with the yellow hat made.  The point of the movie was ""Life is about family"" I suppose.  But the man , instead of making decisions that will benefit his ""family"" (he and Curious George), follows the advice of his  preschool-minded monkey and aids him in stealing an elephant who wants to be reunited with his elephant family.  In the process, they break the law on numerous occasions and do a lot of damage to property.  They hide from the police and fire department - in the real world, this decision will land you in jail.  The man with the yellow hat fully expects his imminent arrest, and in order to avoid those consequences steals keys and jumps with the elephant and his monkey from an airplane.  The guy deserves to be behind bars and have his monkey taken away!!  (I can't believe I am having this discussion).  Yes murder is mentioned and really stood out to me as well as inappropriate.  I suppose I wouldn't mind so much if I had rented this myself, but I watched it on PBS -it was heavily advertised and promoted there.  Where is the education in all this??  It taught my children nothing of value.  I gave it 2 stars because it was wonderfully animated.",1290556800,2,1276,4.351694915254237
