8336551,1,B001QVHD70,sorry but this was crap. you appeared they just hand copied it right off the television on a vhs tape and then copied it to a dvd.  Some short parts were even cut-off.  Poor quality all the way through.,1405641600,,202,4.153846153846154
8336552,3,B001QVHD70,Direct copies from TV. Which means the quality is much less than you expect. But unavaiable elsewhere and Phil Silvers IS funny.,1391040000,,128,4.863636363636363
8336553,5,B001QVHD70,We are great Phil Silvers fans and these dvds make us laugh.  Good clean humor is hard to come by these days.,1356480000,,109,3.9545454545454546
8336554,4,B001QVHD70,"This is Pretty Good Bilko, considering that it is otherwise unavailable. These are later shows, only the first season has been released by the studio, God knows when they will release season 2, and these are from later seasons, I think.

Granted they are bootlegged from Comedy Central and TV Land. The quality isn't ideal, but they're quite watchable. They look best on an old-fashoned TV, I just happen to have one left.",1323302400,,422,4.780821917808219
8336555,2,B001QVHD70,"The discs arrived in a timely manner. The difficulty is that they were recorded from a Comedy Central Cable broadcast. Comedy Central's logo is displayed at the start of each show and the quality is at times adequate to very bad at other times. The only redeeming quality is that the program is not available from the copyright holder. Still this information should be included in the item description, but it is not.",1287360000,8,417,4.726027397260274
