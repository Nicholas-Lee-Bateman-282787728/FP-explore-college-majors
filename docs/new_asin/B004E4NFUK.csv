8426447,5,B004E4NFUK,"Another fantastic drama from Korea. I got hooked when seeing Jumong and was not disappointed with Dong Yi either. I first saw it on TV and really looked forward to seeing each episode to sees how she, Dong Yi, would get out of any predicament she found herself in. I think the acting is superb and appreciate the English subtitles (I don't speak Korean). Also, a couple of actors are in this that were in Jumong, but play totally different characters. If you enjoy Korean dramas set in the days of swords and arrows, you should enjoy this one as well. You will also be captivated by the smile of the actress that plays Dong Yi, it always seems sincere and from her heart.",1296518400,,671,4.419354838709677
