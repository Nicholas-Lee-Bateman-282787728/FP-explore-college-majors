8383042,3,B002WG8TYY,"There are 24 movies and I 12 chapter serial with Bela Lugosi. There were some real turkeys here but also a couple of hidden gems, as well. I enjoyed WILDCATS with Richard Arlen The sequences in the oil field are very realistic. Arlen also co-starred with Buddy Rogers in the silent classic WINGS (1927), which was the very first film to be awarded an Oscar.

The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery was released in 1959 and features a very young and wet-behind-the-ears Steve McQueen There is also a movie that dramatizes the life of writer Jack London and a silent version of LAST of the MOHICANS which dates from 1920.

As previous posters have noted the DVDs are unlabeled but they did improve the packaging with a better quality DVD storage case, as opposed to the flimsy 'slim' cases.  .",1525737600,,785,4.5928571428571425
8383043,2,B002WG8TYY,"Before you buy ""25 Action Classics"" remember the old saw that if it seems too good to be true it probably is. Despite its low cost, that is the case here given that a huge percentage of these ""action classics"" are installments from an awful Bela Lugosi serial about the Coast Guard, the evil inventor of a deadly disintegrating gas (guess who,) a murder, and the shipwreck of a vessel named the ""Carfax."" There's a plucky female reporter, her ludicrously over-the-top photographer, and a steely jawed hero of the USCG. This was bound to happen when the box boasts ""25 action classics"" yielding ""over 20 hours of entertainment."" (You do the math.)

There are some other actual movies (e.g. ""The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery"" and ""The Fast and the Furious"") starring big name actors like Steve McQueen, Robert Wagner, and Telly Savalas. None of the movies are especially exciting by today's standards, but while the Lugosi material is painfully trying, some of the other films are modestly palatable making the collection deserve two stars overall. Unless you're a glutton for punishment or just can't get enough of Bela Lugosi, skip the serials and watch the rest. That is not a glowing endorsement by any means, but the price certainly is right.",1394755200,2,1245,4.872641509433962
8383044,2,B002WG8TYY,I was disappointed to find that 12 of these so-called classics are actually 12 segments of a old serial that used to be shown weekly in movie theators and not seperate movies or classics. The 2- disc packaging is awful and there is no label on it to let you know which side is which. As it turns out only one side is used but you will only find this out as your DVD player does not accept the other side.,1355961600,,404,4.0
