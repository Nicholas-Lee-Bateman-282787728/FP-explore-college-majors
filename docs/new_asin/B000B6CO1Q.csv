This show fallow the lives of three roommates; sounds boring right?  Well not when the roommates are a floating thing of french frys, a wad of meat and a shake.

2402968,5,B000B6CO1Q,"This gem of a show is on Adult Swim, it airs every Monday through Thursday at 12:00 o'clock midnight, and it usually lasts 15 minutes. What I love most about this show is their abrupt endings, they always leave me ROFL'ing. I love all the characters on this show. The main Characters are Master Shake (A Milk Shake) who is lazy, greedy and mean-spirited, Frylock (French Fries) the most mature character with sense of reason, could be considered the ""Paternal Figure"", and Meatwad (A Meatball) who is naive and innocent. These 3 live  in a house they are renting in Southern New Jersey, and are supposed to be crime fighters, but we barely see them doing any of that. Their next door neighbor is Carl. The only human character on the show, and sometimes we get appearances from The Mooninites named Inignokt and Err who are 2 two-dimensional creatures from the moon, and claim to be more advanced than us. Other Characters are Dr. Weird and Steve, and the Plutonian League. If you enjoy extremely random humor then watch this you won't be disappointed.

Epoisodes that I recommend:

The Cubing (Season 3)
Dumber Dolls (Season 1)
Interfection (Season 1)
Mc Pee Pants (Season 1)
Mayhem of the Mooninites (Season 1)
Mail Order Bride (Season 2)
The Shaving (Season 3)
Ol Drippy (Season 1)
Bad Replicant (Season 1)
Super Trivia (Season 2)
Meat Zone (Season 2)
Super Sirloin (Season 2)
Super Model (Season 2)
Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future (Season 2)
Spacecataz (Special Featured episode in Season 4 DVD.)

2402969,5,B000B6CO1Q,"If you are into Python, BUY THIS!!!  I've always tried to watch ATHF whenever I got the chance, now I can watch this whenever I want!  I have never laughed so hard in my entire life.  I think by now we all know the premise of the show, so I won't bore anyone with that, but this is comedy, pure and simple.  Granted, one needs a slightly deranged and weird sense of humor to fully appreciate this, but it is truly ""Number 1 in the hood, G!!!!!""",1165017600,6,444,4.068965517241379
2402970,5,B000B6CO1Q,"If you like funny, then slap some cash down on the table, sit back and enjoy the ride.  Don't be greedy and try to watch too many in one sitting.  Too much of anything ruins the experience.  2 episodes at a time, when you are not distracted, is perfect.  After volume 4, you will be stronger, faster, smarter...probably even better looking.  If you think the humor is too sophmoric, go buy the Frasier DVD's and continue to dream about Niles..this is not for the weak hearted or the stiff upper lipped.",1153180800,6,502,4.472527472527473

8082301,1,B000B6CO1Q,"(update) This is a 5 star collection, but is currently selling on Amazon for more than the cost of buying the seasons individually.  As long as people support price gouging on sets like this, Amazon and others will try and get away with it.  Moral of the story - before you buy a high priced set, set what buying the elements individually would cost.  If the price for this comes back under control, I'll re-raise my rating to 5 stars. (see review below)

For me, this is the perfect set, as I think the first four seasons of ATHF were the strongest. It seems like since then they've been straining a bit to come up with great concepts.

There's no question this is an uneven show.  Some episodes don't work at all.  But that's more than made up for by those episodes that leave you laughing so hard you cry, while your brian quietly explodes at the insanity of it all.

While this has worn off for me a bit from when I was first enthralled by it's sheer dada-esque insanity, the best
episodes still transcend to inspired levels of bizarre, gross, tweaked humor.  When your starting premise is a giant talking
shake, fries, and wad of meat living in New  Jersey, how wrong can you go?

As far as my personal ratings, on a scale of 1 to 4...Season 1; `MC Pee Pants', `Love Mummy',
`Dumber Dolls' ***1/2, `Escape from Leprecopolis', `Circus',***1/4 ; `Bus of the Undead', `Ol' Drippy',
 `Revenge of the Moonanites', `Dumber Days', `Bad Replicant'***.  Remaining 8 episodes **1/2 or **3/4.

Season 2: `Mail Order Bride', `Universal Remonster',  `Super Bowl', `Super Squatter', `Super Spore',
`Super Computer' ***1/4. `Super Birthday Snake',  `Super Sir Loin', `Meat Zone', `Super Trivia' ***.  Remaining 3 **3/4.

Season 3: The Clowning ***3/4, Total Recarl, The Last  One ***1/2, Revenge of the Trees, The Cloning, Broodwitch, The Cubing, The Shaving ***1/4,  Frat Aliens, The Dressing,  Remaining 2 **3/4.

 Season 4 `Video Oija',`Dusty Gonzangas', `Hypno Germ' ***1/2,  `Unremarkable Voyage', `E-Dork', T-shirt of the Undead', `Spacegate World' ***1/4,  `Gee Whiz', `Little Brittle',***, remaining 4 **/34 or **1/2.

If you like strange, gonzo humor (Monty Python would be my generation's touchstone) and/or out-there
adult animation, you owe it to yourself to give this a try -- and give it a couple of episodes to let your head get into what the creators are doing.",1299974400,,2367,4.899244332493703

8082306,3,B000B6CO1Q,"Most of the ""cartoons for adults"" genre leaves me a bit cold.  I don't care for ""The Simpsons"" or ""Future-rama"".  Even ""South Park,"" which has moments of brilliance, has dry, preachy, stretches -- often, if not always, the show ends with an explicit statement of theme, which is always an artistic gaffe.  I also have no affection for any kind of Anime -- whose plotlines may or may not be clever.  I just can't be bothered to tell.

Not so, however, with this divinely funny little show.  I will admit to requiring a bit of a learning curve for ""ATHF"" -- but immediately, on a first viewing, I realized there was something different about it.  It seemed to exist in its own vacuum-universe, where the allusions were to things beyond my ken.  Eventually, with a few repeated viewings, I realized the show was a lot more old-fashioned (in a good way) than I originally thought.  It was not like ""Family Guy"", whose humor is almost entirely allusive -- references to obscure (and not so-obscure) pop culture are the rule in both ""FG"" and ""Simpsons"".

The humor of ""ATHF"" is almost entirely self-contained, and that is the source of its strength.  The main characters are absolutely worked-out personalities, perfectly etched and realized.  Also, none of them is above ridicule, or beneath sympathy.  They are (to borrow the familiar phrase from Aristotle) ""people just like us.""  We, at one point or another, have had roommates like Shake (bossy, selfish) or Meatwad (the idiot-savant with the strange aura of 'cool'), or neighbors like Carl (by turns paranoid and inappropriately chummy; desperately lonely).

People like the Frat Aliens (obnoxious, drunk, horny), or the Plutonians (dictatorial, combative) exist.  The Mooninites are those pushy friends of yours who can be counted on to get you into trouble (witness Meatwad's brief life of crime at their instigation).

""ATHF"", then, is a ""commedia"" in the old-fashioned sense, like Chaucer, or Dante, where various instances of human nature are examined, placed before the viewer's eye like laboratory specimens.

Finally, the dialogue is, line for line, consistently brilliant.  I have watched all of the episodes multiple times, and I am always finding new hidden gems.  Sometimes, in the process of laughing at one screamer (particularly some of Carl's better lines, e.g., ""Normally, I wouldn't date a fat chick from the flag corps, but this is a new era"") I miss several others in its wake.

Let's hope Maiellaro and Willis stick to their original formula -- good old fashioned comedy of matters, sprinkled here and there with scatological humor.",1193011200,2,2603,5.020979020979021
