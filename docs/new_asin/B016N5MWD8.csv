7476471,2,B016N5MWD8,Common David! Maybe you like the feel of these cheap balls that callous your hands. I'll bet yours is not that rough. I'd spend the extra money if I had the option to order a finly honed one in place of this orange crate wooden one. One of my balls already splintered. It should compliment the smooth movements of Tai Chi exercises,1469059200,5,331,4.354838709677419

8736788,4,B016N5MWD8,"When I first opened the box, I was very disappointed that the balls did not come with the dvd portrayed.  Instead, it came with two other dvds, Tai Chi Flow Strength and the Tai Chi Flow Fit. I think perhaps the error occurred when they were packaged.  But after watching them, I discovered that the Tai Chi Flow Strength one does also incorporate the balls, so I guess it's ok.  I like David-Doran Ross and I wanted the two balls because I wanted to incorporate some weight.  The balls are really not weighted very much, and kind of large in diameter, and  I felt over priced because I went out and got two toning  balls elsewhere for $4.99 each that have sand in them and so I do feel the weight.  But I decided to keep the set anyways. It's too much hassle to send it back and I do like the DVDs even though they weren't what was showed.  I'm fairly new to Tai Chi and the workouts are easy to follow and he speaks in a very pleasant manner.",1514592000,,944,4.176795580110498
