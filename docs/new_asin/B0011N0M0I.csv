8709418,5,B0011N0M0I,I watched this movie on the TV and I loved it. Now I have it at my house to watched and show to my children the wonderful movies that were produced at Mexico.,1364428800,,158,3.8181818181818183
8709419,2,B0011N0M0I,I think the product was okay but I needed English subtitles for my film class as the film is in Spanish but was not advertised as not having English substitles. I believe my money should be returned as I return the film. I think advertisements of products like this need to have more information for the purchaser. I am very disappointed because I wasted my money and time on a product that could not be used by me or my students.,1353628800,,430,4.320987654320987
