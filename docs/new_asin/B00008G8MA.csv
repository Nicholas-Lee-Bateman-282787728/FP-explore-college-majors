7982970,1,B00008G8MA,"IT WAS ALL RIGHT: [I BOUGHT IT AT THE TIME BEFORE VIDMARK BECAME LION'S GATE STUDIOS] BUT IT'S A CHEAP RIP OFF OF SHARON STONE'S ""BASIC INSTINCT"": [A PREPROCESSOR, WHICH WAS A SOFTCORE SEX/MURDER/MYSTERY THRILLER, BEFORE ""PLAY NICE"" WAS MADE] WHILE SHARON STONE'S CHARACTER DISPATCHED HER VICTIMS WITH SEX & A ICEPICK, ROBEY'S CHARACTER WENT ONE STEP FURTHER; THAT AT THE TIME OF CLIMAX, [SHE] STICKS A GUN IN THEIR MOUTH, AND WELL.. YOU GET THE PICTURE.... ROBEY WAS MEDIOCRE AT BEST IN THIS FEATURE, AND MANY OF THE NUDE SCENES WERE DONE BY A ""BODY DOUBLE"": OR SO I WAS TOLD BY A[NOTHER] STAFF MEMBER AT VIDMARK AT THE TIME.... I WAS ALSO TOLD LOUISE FELT SHE WAS ABOVE EVERYBODY ELSE WHO WAS NOT OF THE SAME CELEBRITY STATUS & CALIBER AS SHE WAS, MAKING FILMING DIFFICULT FOR ALL OF THOSE AROUND HER.... (COULD THAT BE THAT IS THE REASON ""WHY"", SHE HASN'T DONE ANY MORE FILMS SINCE?)...... IF YOU ENJOY A RIP OFF OF ""BASIC INSTINCT"", & MEDIOCRE ""WACTING"", FEATURING A MEDIOCRE WOULD HAVE PRIMA DONNA, [IN SEMI NUDE PARTS] THIS THIS LOW BUDGET SOFTCORE SEX/MURDER MYSTERY FEATURE IS FOR YOU....",1368403200,,1096,4.683937823834197
7982971,3,B00008G8MA,"everyone is right, kind of a stupid slow movie. However, if you are a Louise Robey fan, its a must have!",1283558400,,104,4.0
7982972,5,B00008G8MA,"Okay, I bought this DVD because it has a nude scene with Robey in it. Robey being a singer and also an actress in the Friday The 13th: The series television show which I recently got on DVD and am enjoying. So I wasn't really caring about the movie which turned out much better than I was expecting. Not that I was expecting it to be bad. It was a nicely paced thriller with some humor thrown in. Acting was good and the story was intriquing. I would have enjoyed it even if Robey wasn't in it.",1242259200,4,494,4.103092783505154
7982973,5,B00008G8MA,"There is no better film.
The acting, the writing, the cinematography.  The key grip was outstanding.
Robey as Rapunzel was not seductive, not chilling.
Ed O'Ross as Mouth was (...) ugly.

And at the movies climax, when Mouth dumped silverware on Rapunzel, I wept.",1085529600,2,475,4.925
7982974,3,B00008G8MA,"This ""who done it""  has some bad acting in it. I couldn't believe some of the trite lines and bad directing.
If you are a fan of Friday the 13th Robey than you will like seeing ""all of her"". She tried to save the film but it didn't happen. Save this one for a ""steamy"" night when you need something to get you going.",1023062400,6,316,3.9375
7982975,2,B00008G8MA,"A compelling trifle for the fan of either the TV series, Friday the 13th or the actress Louise Robey.  Recommended for completists of either of these schools -- Robey is as lovely as ever, and given the opportunity to  expose both acting chops and skin.  However, if you are not a fan of this  actress, then I would not recommend it -- except for her, it is a rather  bare-bones, predictable, tepid serial-killer yarn.",945820800,11,418,4.594594594594595
