8298825,5,B001ELXSP8,"Finally, two classic martial arts films have been resurrected from the void!  ""Chinese Hercules;"" Since the beginning of the home video market, this great Martial Arts cult classic, has been available in only the most awful, faded, blurry prints, with the 2:35,1 aspect ratio, chopped down to 4x3 size, obliterating almost HALF the picture.  This edition offers up the movie in it's original widescreen glory, along with another lost gem, ""Black Dragon,"" with Ron Van Clief. The inferior sequels have long been available, but the original was impossible to find. This one too, presented in a nice, widescreen print. I don't think fans ever expected these titles to be restored, but this is awesome. This has got to be the coolest double feature set ever; ""Chinese Hercules"" & ""Black Dragon"" together on one disc. Good choice, as both movies take place in modern (1970's) era, and both are crime fims dealing with similar subjects. Whoever thought of putting these titles together should be commended. Fans should pick this one up; it's bound to be a collector's item some day.",1517443200,,1076,5.005586592178771
