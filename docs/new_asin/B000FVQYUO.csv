2592598,4,B000FVQYUO,"Fascinating, well told and ultimately touching, this short (60 minute) biography of the legendary sharpshooter tells
the tale of an amazing life, full of more than it's shares of ups and downs.

Oakley was, without setting out to be, a pioneer among women, competing on even terms in a man's world, at a man's
sport, and beating men at their own game at a time when that was generally unthinkable, becoming an international
star in the process.

At the same time, she stayed outwardly to the Victorian ideal of seeming demure and `lady-like'.  Yet she would fight
ferociously to protect herself, her position and her image.  A woman full of contradictions, a moving love story, a fight to break
through a disastrous childhood, and the story of an amazing talent make this a very entertaining piece of history.

One lovely touch is there is actually some early movie footage of the real Oakley from appearances late in her career, a nice
addition to the usual talking heads and still photos.",1354752000,6,990,4.8
2592599,5,B000FVQYUO,"I just watched this on PBS and it was great.

Great story about about a great American woman.  I never knew
about her life and I am glad I watched this.",1327968000,3,152,3.870967741935484
2592600,5,B000FVQYUO,"Annie Oakley's life has become much distorted by bad biographies, musical plays and movies as to be lost forever.  But here we have at least a sincere attempt to tell her story without romantic gimmicks and half-truths.  The real story of her life is far more interesting than the one invented by Hollywood or Broadway.

Her early life was filled with poverty and pain, of feeding the Oakley family by hunting game, and shooting was the unlikely talent that lifted her above being forgotten.  The rather dainty and feminine Miss Oakley met and bested one of the champion shots of her day, they married, and she became world famous.  It sounds easy to put it that way, but it was anything but easy.  Starting in pre-vaudeville, they later traveled with Buffalo Bill's Wild West, were the toast of Europe, met Queen Victoria, the Kaiser, and other dignitaries.  Not bad for a girl born in a small Ohio town, a girl who had to be hired out to cruel employers because her mother could not feed her.

It all sounds like some bizarre Horatio Alger story, of course, and it goes to prove that real biography can exceed the exaggerations of the dime novel.",1320105600,8,1148,4.620689655172414

8127383,5,B000FVQYUO,"I have seen and enjoyed many American Experience shows, but this one was one of the outstanding ones. Although I have always been involved with the ""shooting sports, I've never given a second thought to Annie Oakley. Now I know that she should be a inspiration to young American women (but fat chance of THAT happening in our liberal climate).",1418256000,3,343,4.733333333333333
8127384,4,B000FVQYUO,"Annie Oakley, 2006 film

It begins with the last shooting exhibition by Annie Oakley at age 62; she never missed! Phoebe Ann Moses was born in Ohio around 1860. Her father died when she was young, they lost the family farm and became destitute. Annie was hired out as a servant and suffered mistreatment. She learned to shoot and became a market hunter to help support her family. Shooting contests were a spectator sport then. [No infringements on the right to keep and bear arms then.] She met and married Frank Butler, They performed indoors on a stage. [Where did the bullets go?] Traveling performers were the rule then. They joined Buffalo Bills Wild West Show when there was as opportunity. It was very popular in the big cities of the East. [They show old movies of this circus.]

She could hit and split a playing card by its edge. Annie displayed a little girl persona. They were popular in New York city, then sailed to perform in London there. Queen Victoria watched their show. Prince Wilhelm took part in one show. [No security concerns then?] Annie was photographed by Edisons moving picture machine. The Wild West movie would supplant Wild West shows in time. [I think there was a Wild West rodeo in New Yorks Madison Square Garden in the 1950's.] A train accident in 1901 injured Annie. A press report said she used cocaine and was arrested! It was false, that woman was an imposter. Annie brought suits against the newspapers. She won, but lost money overall. She retired in 1913. She advocated the use of firearms for women for self-protection. She died in 1926. Some said it was due to lead poisoning from all that shooting. Believable?

The show Annie Get Your Gun was a Hollywood History of her life. Hollywood makes entertainment, not history. No one has written her biography. Annies shooting skills would not be popular with our corporate aristocracy who keep infringing on the right to keep and bear arms. Their flunkies campaign to take away peoples rights. Imagine a shotgun toting Barbie?",1417824000,,2017,4.773638968481375
