7931571,3,B0000560X6,"Not a bad movie, standard martial arts flick from China from 1977. There is a lot of action, well let's call it martial arts dancing. Two kung fu 'gorillas' that are impervious to swords, and some literal 'tongue fu', some really colorful costumes and two pretty women. The streaming version is lousy however, the entire movie is out of focus, and it is a widescreen movie shown on a 4:3 screen, and some pan and scan, a lot of faces and heads cut off by the edge of the screen and similarly much of the action takes place off screen because of this. The on demand video is not worth it, even if you can get free with prime.",1475020800,,624,4.2521008403361344
7931572,1,B0000560X6,"While one can appreciate bad dubbing and cheesy wire moves in old Kung fu movies, it is everything else that brings down this movie: too much brightness/contrast issues, such a slow framerate that it gives you nausea during the fight scenes, and the extra loud hissing and popping of the audio is one of the reasons this movie is destined to remain in a bargain bin",1433721600,,365,4.545454545454546
7931573,1,B0000560X6,"Carter Wong, early in his career in this film. The movie is not even bad enough to be good. Terrible gorilla costumes, and really, kung fu gorillas? And the actors took it all so seriously. Good god, they had to be desperate for cash to do this idiotic movie. IT IS LAME. Few of the fight scenes are even passable, the dialogue is terrible, and the Jack Long scene is atrocious. The only reason I kept with it (read: skipped ahead a LOT) was Carter Wong- so if that is worth your time, cool. If not, forget about this terrible, terrible flick.

7931574,2,B0000560X6,"Shaolin Invincibles has your usual martial art movie plot - powerful and evil tyranical overlord commits an atrocity against the protagonist or his family, enigmatic martial arts master rescues and takes the protagonist under wing where the protagonist studies the master's brand of martial arts for 10-12 years and then proceeds to enact revenge against said tyranical overlord working his way up through the overlord's henchmen and ultimately meeting and defeating tyranical overlord satisfying the protagonist's oath of vengeance.  The twist in Shaolin Invincibles is that the protagonist in this story is a girl.  The girl, finally ready, leaves the Shaolin monastry (with her friend and sparring partner from her 12 years of training) on her quest, inexplicably gathering 2 more male friends on the way who are well-known martial artists.

When you sit down to watch a Chinese martial arts movie you expect to see the plot above delivered through over-acting mediocre performers with hokey FX, made even more rediculous if the movie has been over-dubbed into English in China.  The reason why you watch is to see the choreographed martial artistry in the fight scenes.  And I suppose to cheer on the hero, even though you already know that he will triumph in the end.

The martial artistic ability of the female actors is poor at best.  The make-up and prosthetic application is poor.  Even though this movie was released in 2007, the production values are horrid.  It almost seems as if the origin of this title was an astigmatic pirate sitting in a movie theatre with VHS camera from 1983.  The picture is out of focus and sides are cut off as the aspect of the pirates camera are 4x3 and the screen from which it was stolen was 16x9.  In my humble opinion you may wish to skip this one and see Red Cliff which was released in 2008.",1389225600,,1839,4.843450479233227
7931575,3,B0000560X6,This is the stupidest Kung Fu movie I have ever seen.  Other than that the video quality was poor.  So stupid it is entertaining.,1374278400,,129,4.333333333333333
7931576,5,B0000560X6,"Let me start the review by saying that this is terrible - a bad film on an even worse DVD. Its poorly dubbed bad sound quality is only outdone by its abysmal picture quality which gives us a scratched (more like run over by a truck!) full screen presentation of a widescreen film. So why in the world would I give this monstrosity 5 stars?!?!?

Three words - KUNG FU GORILLAS!

To be more accurate I should say, stunt guys in the worst $10 gorilla outfits ever, trained by wizards with 4 foot tongues that can be used as weapons, that fight two hot girls (including the drop dead gorgeous Doris Lung Chung-erh from the classic old school ""Master of the Flying Guillotine"") and are invincible except for the soft spots on their heads that projectile erupt blood. Carter Wong fights the wizards (and their tongues!), there are even more gorilla fights, and if you insist on some real kung fu in your kung fu movies, let me remind you that we not only have the talents of the aforementioned Carter Wong, we also have Jack Long and Delon 'Flash Legs' Tam from ""The Hot, The Cool and The Vicious""!

Sadly there is no DVD with a better presentation of this cheesy kung fu classic, so this will have to do. Who knows, maybe it wouldn't be as fun if it was all cleaned up and shiny.

This is not a movie for uber-traditionalist martial arts fans who demand realism in the on screen fighting techniques and serious story lines, but if you are a fan of films like the equally over the top (but more serious) ""Master of the Flying Guillotine"", I think you will really have a lot of fun watching this film. A classic!",1240617600,,1605,4.393939393939394
7931577,3,B0000560X6,"I didn't exactly know what to expect from this weird movie. I picked up hoping to have a good time watching old school king fu, so I gave the flick a chance; results were that I did have a good time watching it but it wasn't exactly what i was expecting. The film combines kung fu with sword fighting; which is not bad, as a matter of fact it's very well choreographed. The only thing is that there are these recurring characters that ruin and kind of gives you mixed feelings about the flick.
for example; there's  this scene where the two main characters are looking for this ruthless king; in the scene we have the king sitting down in forest when out of nowhere these gorillas pop up, and for some weird reason they know how to fight kung fu.

The whole movie is about these two young shoaling girls who are seeking revenge for the deaths of there family. It seems this king is responsible for the deaths. the plot isn't really important, what's important is the fight scenes which are quite descent, yet they are ruined once again by stupidity such as these weird long tongued fighting dudes that use there tongues to fight, anyway its hard and weird just explaining it. For sure you will laugh and enjoy the fight scenes just don't take it seriously. By the way the picture quality is average compared to other poor kung fu releases.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5",1201392000,2,1371,4.432539682539683
7931578,4,B0000560X6,"I saw this flick many years ago, and alway wanted it as part of my vast collection of old school kung fu.  I really enjoyed this film,as the old school kung fu very transparent.  I felt this flcik was truly entertaining, and nicely reflect what old school kung fu is all about.  However, the fight scenes with 2 guys in gorilla outfits, I though was kinda over the top.  With that a-side, an amazing movie, with Carter Wong, Tan Tao Liang and the amazing Miss Doris Lung!! Definately a must have for the collection,,you can't go wrong!!",1152489600,3,536,4.494845360824742
7931579,4,B0000560X6,"This is a fantastic movie, that is, if you like cheesy kung fu movies.  The basic plot is that an evil Chinese ruler has a family killed (for one reason or another), however, two sisters escape the massacre with the help of a Shaolin monk.  They grow up and seek revenge with the help of two of their Shaolin buddies.
The plot is not what's important in this film, the fighting is. Shaolin Invincibles features entertaining kung fu with a strange variety of opponents.  The sisters and their pals, aside from fighting hordes of ""normal"" bad guys, fight GORILLAS! Yeah, you heard me... Gorillas!  Kung Fu Fighting Gorillas at that!  In addition, they fight two wizards that have extremely long tongues that they use as whips; really cheesy and really entertaining.  Finally, the sisters do battle with a mutated/scarred old man who has one gigantic eyeball.  Add all this together with a small amount of really fake gore and you've got yourself a winner.
The DVD itself has a few low points.  First of all, and most obviously, is that this appears to have been transferred directly from the 1983 video-tape source material.  This is apparent as that the ""Ocean Shores"" distibutor logo appears at the beginning of the film and in the lower left of the screen at one point during the movie.  The picture quality is good, not outstanding.  I didn't expect this film to be pain-stakingly re-mastered as if it were some film classic and it's not.  Also, the trailer is not the Shaolin Invincibles trailer, but merely an advertisment for Tai Seng Entertainment's other kung fu movies.
In closing, this is a DVD worth having...Besides, who doesn't want to see KUNG FU FIGHTING MONKEYS!!! YEAH!!!",987724800,9,1687,4.799307958477509
