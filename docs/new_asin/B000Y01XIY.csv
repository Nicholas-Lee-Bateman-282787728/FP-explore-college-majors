8230396,5,B000Y01XIY,I began playing bluegrass bass almost a year ago and have struggled with creating runs and putting them in the right places.  This DVD is exactly what I was looking for.  Everything is explained in basic simple steps like all the Murphy Method DVD's I have.  Now I am hoping for a third installment in the series: Advanced Bass Techniques,1363737600,,338,4.6
8230397,2,B000Y01XIY,"I've recently resumed playing base after a (very) long hiatus.  While I'm progressing well in reacquiring my skills with bass (this time on an upright), I thought I could augment the learning process by purchase of an ""intermediate"" bass DVD - specifically for Bluegrass music.

So, I purchased this DVD.  While it contains information and instruction that would benefit folks just starting to play the upright bass, it was just too basic for me.",1211328000,,446,5.0
