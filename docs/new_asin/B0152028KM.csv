The only issue I have with this is that the video quality is not that good.  The source used for the it wasn't very good at all.....it was run through a computer it looks like at too low of a resolution...I know this because of the way I had watched it before which was at higher resolution without the jaggies or other anomalies on the video.  The sound is also not true stereo.  The actual subtitles are yellow text and they kind of mess up at differing spots.

So I cant give this a 5 star rating.",1473033600,,634,4.190082644628099
8732341,3,B0152028KM,"From the packaging this looks to be a bootleg from Hong Feng Entertainment based out of Malaysia. A bootleg yes, but affordable compared to paying $300+ for the official release.",1455667200,2,178,4.966666666666667
