7983224,3,B00008G8N1,"David (Miles Buchanan) and Jack (Marcus Graham) are two good friends attending college. Jack works out and David knows computers. They are on the onset of dating Kathryn (Kathryn Walker) and Ziggy (Sandie Lillingston). There is also a psychotic suspended police officer named Murphy (Steven Grives) who has it in for Jack and anyone he knows. This isn't a who-dun-it. We know Murphy is the killer (see DVD cover).

The kids, on a bet, enter a huge department store at night, only to get trapped inside by the creepy Murphy. Like Val Kilmer in ""The Traveler"" Murphy likes to whistle, except his tune is ""When Irish Eyes are Smiling."" The film manages to generate suspense.

If you like kids in a store, try ""Chopping Mall.""

7983225,3,B00008G8N1,"This is a review for the 80s dangerous game not the madonna one. This aussie movie was strange and definatly unique. Dangerous game is kinda hard to catagorize, its not a teen horror film per say, Its not exactly an action flick either. It seems to have both of these elemnts and doesnt really pull either of them off. The first 20 min of the film are definatly the most interesiting. The set up is a good one, (disgruntled cop with a grudge) however by the time the kids sneak into the warehouse the film gradually loses steam. It takes to long for things to happen and starts to become boring. The film does have its pluses though, its atmospheric, visually engaging and obviously directed with skill. Unfortunatly its to muddled and drawn out. a decsent curiosity piece but nothing memorable.",1315267200,,795,4.6453900709219855

7983227,3,B00008G8N1,"DANGEROUS GAME is an early film from director Stephen Hopkins (The Ghost and the Darkness; Predator 2).  Filmed in the early nineties in Sydney, Australia, it's a clever, but overwrought, little thriller that doesn't know when to end its welcome.  We meet a quartet of teenagers who are being harassed by a particularly abusive cop.  Seems that he lost a promotion due to one of the teenager's father's actions, so now he hounds this boy and gives him speeding tickets, moves his car into a no parking zone, that kind of ""harmless"" abuse.  Things go sour though when the cop wrecks his motorcycle into a bunch of other cop's cycles on a supposed high speed chase with his teenage nemesis.  Needless to say, he is suspended and he seeks revenge.  The cop obviously has some deep psychological problems.  Meanwhile, the computer nerd of the teen group, shows off his hacking skills by getting the foursome into a high profile department store after hours.  They manage to get into the building, but they didn't count on maniac cop following them, and they end up getting trapped in the building with the cop.  The movie then loses its steam because it takes too much time showing the kids exploring the store, and the cop isn't menacing until he accidentally kills one of the teens with his knife.  From there on, it's just one long chase, that does have some atmospheric impact, but if they had sped up the action some, it might have been a much better movie.  The cast does very well, though.  Steven Grives as Murphy the cop, is excellent in his portrayal of a man who is on the verge of losing the life he loves; Miles Buchanan, Sandie Lillingston, Kathryn Walker and John Polson don't stretch their limits, but they are effective as the somewhat doomed kids.  Its cryptic ending is a little over the top, but for movies of this type, DANGEROUS GAME does okay.",1112140800,,1862,4.640243902439025
7983228,4,B00008G8N1,"Abel Ferrara is back with this nauseating and nihilistic tales about creation and redemption (or redemption in creation).
A director (Harvey Keitel) who's unable to manage his private life, tries to find reality and truth in his new project, a film about a woman, Claire, who finds her faith, when she's been leading a rather promiscuious, wild life with her husband.
A film in a film. His two leading actors, Madonna and James Russo are to give him this truth he cannot find alone. And as the film progresses, the two actors lose touch with their own reality and can't make the difference between the character they're playing and themselves.
Keitel is perfect as Ferrara's alter ego. It's also interesting to note that Ferrara used Madonna for what, generally, people took her for: not a really good actress. But the transformation she goes through in the film while playing an actress who becomes a good actress playing a woman finding God, is very impressive. (She was the surprising revelation for European critics.)
This mirror game leaves the viewer rather confused, but Ferrara's statement about creation, illusion and images is more than interesting.
Unfortunately, the film is much too dark and hopeless. But if you manage to stand this nihilistic experience, you'll discover quite a good film.",1082592000,2,1304,5.041666666666667
7983229,3,B00008G8N1,"Starring Madonna (don't let that put you off) Harvey Keitel and James Russo, and directed by Abel Ferrera, this is an interesting psychological drama about a directors obsession with his film, and the stars breakdown of reality during ther making of it.
A dark, interesting but flawed film, which is well acted (certainly top 3 for Madonna, Evita and Desperately Seeking Susan being her best) but leaves you unsatisfied because of the ambiguous ending and that the film they are making seems to be more interesting than the actual film!
Its worth noting, that Madonna refused to do any promotional work on this film, as she was disappointed with the edit.  Apparently her character was much stronger prior to editting than the victim portrayed in the final cut.
No extras on the DVD.",1079481600,,783,4.887218045112782
