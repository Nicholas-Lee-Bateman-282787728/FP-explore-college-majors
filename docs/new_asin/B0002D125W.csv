8026437,2,B0002D125W,"When I first put this dvd on, I thought I was watching an old, worn out videotape. The quality of the screen is very bad, I think it was a bad copy from video to dvd.

Apart from that, the workout is definitely for beginners: the moves are very simple and not challenging at all. But most of all, I thought it was very boring. Just doing a lot of the same repetitions. I sold the dvd immediately, what a waste of money.",1134259200,3,419,4.048192771084337
8026438,3,B0002D125W,"This workout is ""OK"" It is a bit different from other kickboxing work-outs that I have done. I just wanted a bit more of a cardio-kick. I also expected more ""LATIN"". But This is a good workout.",1120953600,6,193,4.243243243243243
8026439,5,B0002D125W,This is one of the best workouts of any kind I have ever tried! It is an excellent muscle toner and it's a lot of fun too! Whoever wrote the one bad review here doesn't know real music when they hear it and this is definitely NOT just for beginners. It's my favorite!,1116460800,4,267,4.056603773584905
8026440,5,B0002D125W,"This video compels me to get up, shake and move! It's high energy with a spectacular flare for creating a spiritual expression of the bodies movement. Frankly, it kicks ass!

I highly reccommend this video for anyone who has a desire to live with vigor and feel the life force within them come alive.",1110240000,6,300,4.555555555555555
8026441,2,B0002D125W,"Don't buy this DVD if you are looking for a more intermediate workout.  I am in decent shape, and I barely broke a sweat doing it.  Another caveat, this DVD work-out is to a Latin BEAT, there's NO MUSIC.  I really like Spanish music, which is why I bought it, but there is just a salsa-sounding synthesized beat in the background that didn't get me too excited about the exercises.",1095811200,13,381,4.414285714285715
8026442,5,B0002D125W,"This workout is exciting.  There is approx. 30 mins of kicks and jinga moves, 10 mins of upper body, and 10 minutes of toning.  Very challenging and fun!  The jinga moves work every muscle and really gets your heart rate high and keeps it there.

I can honestly say, I have tried hundreds of workout videos, and this is one of my favorites.  It is definitely my favorite kickboxing video.

This review is for the VHS copy.",1092182400,7,422,4.415584415584416
