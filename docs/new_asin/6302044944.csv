422324,5,6302044944,I watched A gathering of old men on TV when it was first released and thought it was a very good piece of work but I could never find a VHS tape or whatever of the film the casting was great along with a great story line I enjoyed seeing this movie again if you have not viewed this movie before check it out you might just like it,1425600000,,331,3.8115942028985508

422326,5,6302044944,"Oh wow, to see the binding of community,  awesome! I don't know if this is a true story or not but it could be.",1418428800,,111,3.625
422327,5,6302044944,This is an excellent film. Our youth need to see this film and understand that things really are no different from that era. Only the form of racism has taken on a different disguise. It is also great for adult learning and discussions in the discourse of racism.,1415836800,,263,4.5
422328,5,6302044944,"Subtle, gentle humour about a serious subject.  I loved Ernest Gaines's book, and the film is very faithful to the novel.  Both are excellent.  A gathering of old men get together one last time to take a stand against racism... and discover that their world has changed.  Or has it?  Read the book first!",1409788800,,304,4.555555555555555
422359,5,6302044944,"An excellent book. that explains the depths of emotion among older men qnd,their relationsship to each other. This story tellls us how  some older men hcoped with and prepared for  to handle racial problems  oduring their time.",1403222400,,227,5.081081081081081
422360,5,6302044944,I don't know how I missed this movie when it came out!  What courage and strength displayed by those GROWN OLD MEN!!,1391644800,,116,4.2727272727272725
422361,5,6302044944,"wow, what a powerfull movie, we loved it hadn't seen it for a long time but we enjoyed it, thanks",1388016000,,97,3.9

422363,4,6302044944,"While some of the acting was a bit subpar, the movie was still worth the time and effort it took to view it. The film gave an excellent insight into the lives of the people of South Louisiana during that time, even going beyond the black/white dichotomy and including Cajuns and/or Creoles. A good discussion tool for family/school/or church.",1374537600,,342,4.813559322033898
422364,5,6302044944,"This was a great read and was used in my Adult Literacy Program.  The dvd's were distributed to our students after we had our movie date, which featured A Gathering of Old Men, which was a hit.  We",1365724800,,197,4.157894736842105
422365,5,6302044944,History of African American people is always worth while and need to be known to all. I highly recommend this information. May not be actual history but close to it.,1365292800,,165,4.533333333333333
422366,4,6302044944,Rather than run and hide from their responsibility; everyone involved linked to the action' steps forward and claims they did it.,1359417600,,129,5.190476190476191
422367,3,6302044944,"I listened to the book on audio book and it was great. 5 star
The movie was a disappointment. It followed the book pretty well until the final confrontation. This was an important part of the book and the movie ignored the gun battle and deaths of two important characters.
It left me with the feeling that the cast and director(s) couldn't get along and they just decided to hurry up and get it over with.",1355184000,,406,4.355263157894737
422368,5,6302044944,WATCHED THE MOVIE BECAUSE OF THE CONTENT AND THE FACT LOUIS GOSSETT WAS IN IT. TO MY SURPRISE I SAW IN THE OPENING CREDITS PAPA JOHN CREACH. MY GREAT UNCLE WHO I NEVER MET. I WATCHED THE MOVIE IN AMAZEMENT. AS THE CHARACTERS EVOLVED AND AS HE FAMOUSLY PLAYED HIS VIOLIN. WHAT A GREAT MOVIE AND FEELING IM HAVING. WISH I HAD THE HONOR OF MEETONG HIM. MY GRANDMOTHER RUTH HIS SISTER OFTEN TALKED ABOUT HIM.WHAT AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE.,1335225600,,429,4.443037974683544
422399,5,6302044944,"This movie is great Iv'e watched this move before it came on DVD when it was shown on TV it has all the best actors and I recomend it to anyone, this is a great choice for buying you want be dissapointed.",1306281600,,204,3.880952380952381
422400,4,6302044944,I read the book long before seeing the movie and they are pretty consistent with each other. Bullies eventually get theirs. I like how all the blacks got together on the shooting. It was wonderfully woven.,1273190400,,205,4.722222222222222
422401,5,6302044944,"A Gathering of Old Men is magnificent on many levels.  To start with it has an all STAR cast.  While you may not have heard of many of the senior Black actors in this movie, make no mistake about it, they all have a long film career.  This movie is a must have if you are to have a complete film library of really great films.  It depicts a time in American history that should never be forgotten, a transitional time that happened out of site of many, but was important to all.  The civil rights era changed many things, but it was the spiritual change that was most significant.  A Gathering of Old Men is a tribute to that change in some of the last hold outs of a dark time in American history.",1203897600,,698,4.133333333333334
422402,5,6302044944,"This is another movie I had never heard of, but it was thoroughly enjpyable.  Goof cast, good story.",1197072000,,100,4.555555555555555
422403,4,6302044944,"Ernest Gaines is a writer who just happens to tell a very good story.  Subsequently, his output is interesting, educational, historic, and witty at the same time.  If one wants a historic look at race relations during the period of ""Modern Slavery"", then this is the book to read. This book basically tells of one Black Tenant Farmer who has reached his breaking point and refuses to be beaten by the White property owner as a matter of course.  It shows that Blacks can come together for a common cause and against a common enemy. It also tells of the interrelationship of Blacks and Whites with some Whites maintaining a superior position through intimidation and unpunished violence, while another side maintains that position through care and compassion, much as the ""good"" mistress took care of ""her people"" during the period of sanctioned slavery.  This, as all of Gaines' works is very good reading.",1178928000,,906,4.901960784313726
422404,4,6302044944,I really enjoyed the book but as usual the movie cannot capture the feelings and thoughts of the characters. Otherwise the movie was fair.,1167868800,,138,4.791666666666667
422405,4,6302044944,I enjoyed the DVD tremendously. The younger generation of Black-Americans have forgotten their heritage. This DvD is  a sad story of man's inhumanity to man. It also shows us the beginning of Black-Americans and some White Americans working towards justice.,1121385600,,257,5.425
422406,4,6302044944,"This is a very poetic, thoughtful, human, often funny, and altogether well-done movie. I highly recommend it. There is hardly any violence in it, and still it is about violence and discrimination in Louisiana in the 70s. Also, it is a good adaptation of Gaines' novel, A GATHERING OF OLD MEN. I haven't the faintest idea why another reviewer compared this movie with Ed Wood stuff - incredible.",1052352000,,394,4.8088235294117645
422407,3,6302044944,"Anyone who doesn't appreciate the effectiveness of this movie has never lived in Louisiana.  The complicated relationships between the races is perfectly depicted in the characters of Candy, Mathu, Sheriff Mapes, and the Boutans.  The book upon which this movie is based is an outstanding work of reality disguised as fiction.  The film version does a creditable job of transferring literature to the screen--that is, until the ending.  The movie's conclusion is not as effective as that in the book (A GATHERING OF OLD MEN, by Ernest J. Gaines).  All-in-all, however, this one is worth seeing!",1015113600,,594,5.145833333333333

7820920,5,6302044944,"Really good ""Made For TV"" movie with some really admirable talent!  Lou Gossett Jr. was great, as were Holly Hunter, Richard Widmark,and Julius Harris and I actually got to meet many of the actors in it while it was being filmed.  Gossett and I argued over the New Orleans Saints hopes that year!  ;-)
  A good number of talented and awesome old Jazz musicians like Tiger Haynes and more.  They put a lot of talent on the screen and it shows.  I highly recommend this movie.  It was severely underrated!",1480032000,,503,4.511111111111111
