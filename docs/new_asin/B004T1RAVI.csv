8559121,5,B004T1RAVI,"For fans of distorted imagery, kaleidoscopes of visual arrays, and almost brainwashing like image precessions- this is the DVD for you. Great for people who want to say ""what the..."" a lot, or just like random imagery. It is very similar in many ways to the Qatsi trilogy of films (Koyaanisqatsi, Naqoyqatsi, Powaqqatsi), or even the nature themed Baraka. I enjoyed this film immensely and highly recommend it.

Porij Neoplasm is actually 2 films.

Porij is about 1 hour long and is a compilation of mostly still imagery. Some have movement, most do not. Some are in a succession on images that change one aspect or move one thing around. Almost all of the images are original and it never gets really dull.

Neoplasm is just under a hour and is similar to Porij but contains mostly moving imagery. All of the images have some kind of visual effect placed on them. The imagery does have a fair bit of repetition, not quite as original as Porij, but the great effects the images have on your eyes make you not mind so much when some images come back round again.

I highly recommend combining the viewing of Neoplasm along with this product: prism diffraction fireworks glasses.

It adds so much more depth to the imagery. Definitely a plus for any not quite sober types who may be watching this film on another level.

Special note: both films are completely silent. There is no sound in any way. I did not mind this so much, as I knew this before buying it, so I made my own MP3 themed soundtrack to it blindly, then played my compilation while watching it with friends. If you pick very weird sounds, techno, and greatly bizarre music (i.e. Serat, Fantomas, Ween, Lords of Acid, Crystal Method, etc...) it will truly make the film, and add your own personal touch. This does require effort on your part, but I felt it was worth it. I recommend using various songs to express a wide range of emotions to have a more fun and experienced trip.

This is definitely not a film for all. I see many being bored as hell with it or just not getting the point at all. I think you need to be a fan of randomness, the beauty a single shot can hold, the fun of a moving picture, and most of all the places each image take each of your minds. Great fun for anyone on a 8 hour journey with friends, but still enjoyable without. Enjoy at your own risk.",1335571200,,2574,4.825396825396825
