4235323,5,B003ZSJ212,"I'm sure the picture and sound for these will be top-notch.  I've abandoned all hope for a re-release on Blu-ray of the originals.  I never really minded the addition of things to the OT, but the modifications were, IMO, generally for the worse.  See the title for this review.  That being said, I'll buy the full set opening day, and probably start with Empire, and it will be killer.",1294272000,12,385,4.536231884057971
4235324,1,B003ZSJ212,"No, I won't support Lucas and his madness. I have the LaserDiscs of the original three (and only) films. I will stick with those.",1294272000,11,129,4.416666666666667
4235325,5,B003ZSJ212,"I don't understand why there's obsession and whining and hate over not getting the originals.  If you're the kind of person who can't appreciate Star Wars unless you've got see-through speeders/X-Wings, horrible skipping lightsabers, and matte paintings that are obviously matte paintings, well then, you really don't need that stuff in hi-def, do you?  The originals are on DVD, you can buy them (on the cheap, no less,) and see Star Wars just the way you remember it - the way it's ""supposed"" to be.

I grew up with the originals, don't get me wrong.  Return of the Jedi is the first movie I remember seeing ever.  I watched the crap out of my VHS tapes - and many of the changes needed to happen.  Luke igniting his lightsaber, for instance, for the first time - that cut was horrible.  I was in high school when they released the special editions, and I remember thinking, ""man, I hope they fixed that.""  Almost.  Then, when they released the DVDs again around 2005, they finally got that part right.  I like that they tinker with it.  I missed the yub yub song at the end of Jedi at first, but the flute section John Williams wrote for it is beautiful.  I can't imagine watching A New Hope without seeing Han confront Jabba, or Empire without the gorgeous detailing added to Cloud City.

Now, go ahead and say this review wasn't helpful.  Scream at me about how Han shot first and how Jedi Rocks was horrible.  I will happily be clicking the pre-order link while you're doing that, and crossing my fingers that George has something special in store - maybe even MORE footage added in, further tweaks to the graphics, and more digital goodness.  THAT's the reason we need blu-ray.",1294272000,128,1684,4.600671140939597
4235326,5,B003ZSJ212,"Either you want this or you don't. Either you enjoy the Star Wars films or you don't. I don't want to hear any of this nonsense about the ""originals"" or the special editions. WHATEVER! It's Georges baby and you are either on board, Jar Jar and all, or you are not. Honestly any reviewing sword casting aspersions on the new editions are semantics at best. If this came out when you were 7 you'd have imploded from excitement. Even negatives like Han fired first has become an entire joke industry in and of itself and who knows, maybe George intended it and he is light years ahead of all of us. Either way, he changed my childhood, my direction in life, and even my kids lives with interesting fantasy and hero adventures. Seriously, there are an entire galaxy, (far far away) of things to complain about before you start complaining about Star Wars. We all know the films. We all know the quality will be top notch. He invented THX Sound for crying out loud. I doubt the set will be below par. And if by some phantom chance they are lame, I'll be happy to come back here and amend my speculation. I love those that are down on Amazon for allowing reviews before the product is out. You guys just don't get business. What is going on here right now before the release is called ""buzz"" and it's a retailers dream scenario that a bunch of nerds would all congregate and debate the minutia of an upcoming product. Any press, buzz, or chatter is good for business. And finally, if you are down on Star Wars and you are here making noise how lame it all is, well, you and Jar Jar can be BFF.",1294272000,6,1587,4.346801346801347
4235327,5,B003ZSJ212,I Love the star wars complete saga blu-rays they look and sound amazing and the extra content is just very cool overall I am very happy with the blu-rays. Star Wars is awesome and so are this blu-rays.,1294272000,5,201,4.315789473684211
4235328,5,B003ZSJ212,"What a bunch of whiny kids these so called ""fans"" are. I just checked Vader's ""Nooo"", and the new Dragon call, and I find nothing to object. What's the big deal? Get a life guys!

While you will go on whining about it, and I will be enjoying the Blu-ray discs of the Entire Saga!

Cheers, and may you get help.",1294272000,6,310,4.065573770491803
4235329,5,B003ZSJ212,"I admit, I had some concerns with the changes made in the set upon first hearing of them, but that does not hinder me from purchasing my favorite Saga. The changes are minor when put next to the rest of the epic.

The blu ray release shows all the movies in stellar 1080p, with amazing 6.1 sound. The films look great, and we all know the story of Star Wars.

The biggest factor to get this edition is the 3 bonus disks that show the behind the scenes footage, interviews, concept art, and deleted scenes from all 6 movies. Then the documentaries and spoofs disk has a great deal information for fans of the series.

Don't let the negative reviews sway you. You know if you're a fan of the series you'll enjoy the set. Everyone wants to hate on this set because of the changes. If you pass on this, you are only denying yourself the technical quality that Star Wars represents on Blu Ray. Also, most of the bad reviews are from even before the release, knee jerk reactions of changes not seen in context. Judge for yourself. But for me, this is worth it, and a great addition to my collection.",1294272000,,1093,4.348039215686274
4235330,3,B003ZSJ212,"This is easy. Episode IV was awesome. Episode V is the best, and Episode VI was also some awesome job of a film, but not as awesome as Episode V. Episode I was terrible except for the Jedi vs. Sith lightsaber battle, but still the rest of the movie sucks. Episode II was quite terrible as well, but the Jedi vs. Sith lightsaber battle was pretty cool. Episode III was easily better than I & II, if only that Jar-Jar Binks doesn't talk at all in the film. Episode III did have some bad acting and some terrible writing, but was a decent film overall.

This is a mixed package. Honestly, I'd advise getting Episodes IV - VI on Blu-ray Disc and Episodes I - III on DVD.",1282953600,11,666,4.203125
8410866,1,B003ZSJ212,"The box looks fine and the discs look good but the DVD quality varies widely. Episode 1 was extremely grainy and the spoken word was so soft that I had to turn the volume almost all the way up. During the action sequences, however, I had to turn it way down or risk blowing out my soundbar. You get what you pay for. These are bootlegs. Dont be fooled.",1528848000,,352,4.115942028985507
8410867,2,B003ZSJ212,The package looks very nice if the plastic wasn't ripping off and the actual box holder wasn't broken. It'll do as it's a you get what you pay for but the DVDs appear to be in working order.,1528761600,,190,4.026315789473684
