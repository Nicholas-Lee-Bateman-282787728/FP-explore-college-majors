2592339,5,B000FVQUZ8,Just happened to catch this movie the other night flippin through the channels - got hooked in the first few minutes couldn't tear myself away. . . it's probably one of the most creative projects I've ever seen... been telling all my friends about it since.  I've seen Stephen in so many different movies but had no idea what a funny guy he really is!  Would never have dreamed that a 90 min movie of someone telling stories could be so entertaining. . . truly charming! Buying it for family members for the holidays.,1160524800,6,517,4.48936170212766
2592340,5,B000FVQUZ8,"Tobo has a wonderful gift for telling a tale. We have enjoyed his podcast for years. Looking forward to his new film, The Primary Instinct. He's a great entertainer!",1398643200,,165,4.724137931034483
2592341,1,B000FVQUZ8,"I wanted so much to like this doc. ST is a funny guy, a pretty good actor, I wanted to learn more about him. By the end of it I intensely disliked the man as his massive ego pushed everyday stories up and beyond tolerable.",1398297600,,222,3.9555555555555557
2592342,5,B000FVQUZ8,Stephen Tobolowsky is such a delightful storyteller and this dvd is a shining example of that. I highly recommend this dvd to everyone!,1398211200,,135,4.913043478260869
2592343,4,B000FVQUZ8,"I'm a big fan of ""It's that guy!"" actors, and within that genre, Tobolowsky leads the pack.  Who knew he'd be so interesting in real life.",1396656000,4,138,4.3076923076923075
2592344,5,B000FVQUZ8,It is not easy to find a movie that makes one laugh and cry at the same time. Stephen does this in this movie. Life is meaningful.,1364774400,,130,3.8518518518518516
2592345,5,B000FVQUZ8,"Stephen Tobolowsky. We all know him but don't know it.  He's a top character actor (the unsung heroes) of our time. Google/IMDB him.  His credits are amazing.  Now- this DVD is one of the most amazing, endearing, honest, and hilarious ""autobio-documentaries"" I've ever seen. Stephen tells stories, mostly in the context of a birthday party at his home, surrounded by friends, of his personal life and life as a character actor. He is a master story-teller. It's like being invited to a really good party with the best host who is a dear friend. You don't want the party (or DVD) to end.  Hats off to this ""top 100 coolest person in L.A.""",1360540800,,637,4.610619469026549
2592346,5,B000FVQUZ8,"I loved his podcast, so I tried the movie. The movie is just as enjoyable as he takes you from story to story. The transitions are a little awkward, but who cares.",1318464000,,163,4.125
2592347,5,B000FVQUZ8,I am someone who enjoys stories. Especially when they are true and personal. This movie fit that perfectly. Having never really paid attention to Stephen other than just enjoying his work like other character acters in film. This brought a glimpse into his life and world we would otherwise never have a clue about. Listen to his podcasts and these wonderful stories go on and on. Stephen appears to me as someone who has lived life and is living it still.,1268006400,4,456,4.6419753086419755
2592348,5,B000FVQUZ8,"This movie consists of Stephen Tobolowsky telling stories about his life. Who would watch this movie thinking that's what it is? I wouldn't have, but I did, thinking it was a kind of a funny ""man on the street,"" hidden camera thing (thanks to Netflix's representation).  I really enjoyed it.  It's similar to ""My Dinner with Andre"", but with more movement and funnier.  It is the sort of movie you would want to buy and watch again.",1249862400,4,432,4.584415584415584
2592349,4,B000FVQUZ8,"I first experienced this film last year during a screening at FilmFest Kansas City. I was delighted to see a different side to an actor whose work I already enjoyed. I knew after seeing it that it was a film I wanted to own. I bought it for myself for my own birthday and am eager to share the gift. Tobolowsky's anecdotes amused and moved me; his experience filming MISSISSIPPI BURNING nearly brought me to tears. As a member of Toastmasters, I appreciate the art of telling a well-crafted story--the ease and economy of his gestures during the Ronald McDonald story demonstrates this. I felt certain that the DVD release would surely include additional material, and it does not disappoint--another 90 minutes of good but sometimes less-compelling stories with less emphasis on his film career. Both the feature and the additional material are appropriately accessible by story. I recommend this DVD with great affection. Tobolowsky is definitely one of the 100 coolest people on DVD.",1163203200,2,986,4.9818181818181815

8127314,5,B000FVQUZ8,"Stephen Tobolowsky has a rare gift.  As soon as he starts speaking you are immediately engaged in his story, and remain engaged as he seamlessly transitions to another, and another...wrapping them all up with a moving, emotional conclusion.",1504742400,,240,5.315789473684211
8127315,2,B000FVQUZ8,"this is a very exceptionally made film with the titular actor. well made and thought through.
named after a play/film and band.
that said, I didn't like it at all.",1461715200,,163,4.466666666666667
8127316,5,B000FVQUZ8,Great book by a great storyteller and actor,1444176000,,43,4.5
8127317,5,B000FVQUZ8,"This is a great intro to Stephen if you haven't listened to his podcasts.  If you have, it's fun to see him do some of those stories live. Plus, there are several great ""new"" stories in there that are the frosting on the cake. Good Stuff!",1442534400,,238,4.173913043478261
8127318,3,B000FVQUZ8,"I love Tobolowsky's storytelling amd regularly listen to his blog. This is more of the same, but filmed. The situation seems contrived, though, and the production values pretty low rent. For instance, when others were interviewed about him (of which there was far too little), there were no titles to tell us who they were. Still, a cute little film, worth a watch.",1441152000,,365,4.809523809523809
8127319,5,B000FVQUZ8,"I love listening to Stephen. If you enjoy the film, check out his podcast, ""The Tobolowsky Files"".",1436918400,,98,4.823529411764706
8127320,5,B000FVQUZ8,If you love the Tobolowsky Files then this is the movie for you.  Very entertaining!,1431302400,,84,4.6
8127321,4,B000FVQUZ8,"If you've read Dangerous Animals Club, some of these stories are ones you've heard before, but this is a ""must watch"" for Tobo fans.",1401667200,3,132,4.541666666666667
