7885596,4,6305233837,"No. It's no gem. Not well written.  An horribly uninteresting story line.  Could've been spiced up a little more... No, a lot more.  Absolutely no conflict, at all.
Yet, for what it is...  A beautiful movie.  The women are gorgeous (especially Kimberly Rowe) and the scenes are effective and beautiful.  All in all, because of Kimberly Rowe, I'm glad I bought the DVD.",996624000,6,368,4.761904761904762
7885597,4,6305233837,Good cast and excellent music make this DVD a good purchase.  Kim Yates is hot!  Setting really adds to the film.  Playboy should focus attention towards this type of production in the future.,942451200,12,192,4.757575757575758
