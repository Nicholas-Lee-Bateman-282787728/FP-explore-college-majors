2925951,3,B000UVV2AQ,"I have to say that I really enjoyed the premise behind ""Plasterhead"". Despite the goofy name, the film packs a decent little slasher punch. ""Plasterhead"" himself is a pretty impressive monster/killer. The guy is HUGE and menacing! The supporting cast are made up of your usual horror film cliches, but not so annoying as to ruin the film. (Luckily, the most annoying character in one of the first people to buy it!) The make up effects when used are very good, and the lonely wooded landscape and small town are a perfect setting for a horror film.
I just wish the film makers had a larger budget for special effects. The lack of on-screen kills really hindered my enjoyment of the film. I want to see some slashing in my slasher flicks, and unfortunately most of the kills happen off-screen. Still, this isn't a bad flick, and with a larger budget they could have started a nice new horror franchise.",1203292800,,901,4.6375
2925952,5,B000UVV2AQ,great movie - so exciting.  scary story plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat,1198368000,,84,3.9411764705882355
2925953,3,B000UVV2AQ,"Regardless of what people say, this movie is a pretty solid slasher film. The atmosphere was great- not many slashers take place in the Winter. The killer was a pretty damn big guy, and really well done. The movie is low budget shot on DV, but the cinematography is great and better done than a lot of 35mm 20 million dollar movies.

I thought the movie was very well paced and for an indie the acting was pretty good. For lovers of the Friday The 13th franchise, the movie had scenes shot at the diner and gas station from Friday The 13th.

In the end it's a fun flick.",1197072000,3,570,4.220183486238532
2925954,2,B000UVV2AQ,"This movie is about 25 years too late!!!!
It would have been received alot better if it was created during the slasher era.
You've seen this type of movie a thousand times before,
and this one does nothing to add anything new or unique to the genre.
The director has alot of potential too; and it's apparent in the cinematography,
with scares reminiscent of the original Halloween.
BUT it's so slow and boring, that not even they could save me from sleep.
The lack of gore was forgivable but ultimately disappointing.
The acting was so ridiculous at points that it was distracting,
and furthermore the characters didn't have anyhting to say at all,
It didn't even seem like they were the type of people that would hang out together.
They were pretty much type cast.
The B****, The token black guy, Mr. Uptight, & Survivor Girl.
The story was typical; something tragic happened in the past in a sleepy town, and now someone is on a murderous rampage because of it.
The one good thing I CAN say about this flick is...
If you're suffering from insomnia, boy do I have a cure.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
Don't operate heavy machinery or consume alcohol while viewing.",1193875200,7,1157,4.616504854368932
2925955,3,B000UVV2AQ,Plasterhead is a decent low budget film. It has better scares than most of its peers but suffers a bit from slow pacing. Overall you could do much worse if you are a fan of this type of movie.,1192492800,2,192,3.948717948717949
2925956,1,B000UVV2AQ,"I rented this movie a few days ago, and it was awful.
Horrible acting, ultra low-budget, with a plot that made no sense.
I fell asleep, it was so boring.
Save your money and your time.",1191801600,2,184,4.138888888888889
8215261,5,B000UVV2AQ,"I got this on a whim but really enjoyed it.  Im not a huge blood/guts fan, and there were a few actors could use some lessons in not sounding high school play-ish but overall, I enjoyed the story, plot and acting!",1382227200,,213,4.195121951219512
8215262,5,B000UVV2AQ,i liked plasterhead. the story of a beaten to a pulp black man who returns and slaughters the racist in a small virginian town. it is good to see a movie with a different theme and villian who i was actually rooting for and would like to buy him dinner. although i didn't like the goody two shoes heroine and wanted to 'wack' her myself. good movie!!!!!,1380672000,3,353,4.2835820895522385
8215263,4,B000UVV2AQ,"I've been on an Amazon Instant Video binge. I've reviewed every offering in the horror genre (3k+), rented dozens, and this is the ONLY movie I watched straight through with no fast forwarding.

pros:
Well made, not your usual guy with a vidcam and made up dialogue. Good lighting. Scenes - actual scenes.
The actors are a bit thin, but no worse than most and better than some.
Plasterhead is a genuinely scary dude.

cons:
Plot disconnects - 1) Plasterhead lives in an immaculate house. 2) He decides to go kill some townfolk seemingly out of the blue. 3) He walks into town (several miles) and makes it back in plenty of time to inflict mayhem on the usual young idiots who go places they shouldn't.

Overall, I liked it. Liked it well enough to buy it.",1340150400,4,755,4.4963503649635035
8215264,2,B000UVV2AQ,"<strong>Plasterhead</strong> (Kevin Higgins, 2006)

Utterly generic slasher flick notable only for the appearance of scream queen Raine Brown (<em>Horror</em>). That it is generic, not to mention intensely stupid, is not why I hated it quite as much as I did, however. That is because the movie could have, with another revision or two to the script, had some very interesting things to say about race and vengeance (think <em>Candyman</em> here, naturally), but that part came off as nothing more than a confused muddle at best, a plot device at worst. Depending on which of the two interpretations you go with, the movie is either incompetent in the former case or offensively racist in the latter. I chose to at least give the screenwriter the benefit of the doubt. * ",1327449600,,771,4.9689922480620154
8215265,3,B000UVV2AQ,"They certainly should of showed the demented and deformed masked mad man Plasterhead FAR,FAR,FAR MORE than what is shown in this movie. Most of the movie is about the young college men and women visiting the home where Plasterhead lives and then theres more talking amongst the folks of the town. I thought Plasterhead looked great and quite grusome with his dark eyes piercing through his mask and can be compared to Jason of Friday the 13th or leatherface of Texas Chainsaw Massacre but they absolutely should of shown him far more in the movie,I mean he was the star. They need some tips from Rob Zombie.",1316390400,,607,4.682242990654205
8215266,2,B000UVV2AQ,"PLASTERHEAD starts off decent enough with a blond girl showing her boobs within the first three minutes. Then a creepy guy named, Henry calls into a radio station and narrates us through the story of a killer so gruesome, so scary all the while the blond drives her truck on a dirt road. Suddenly, for some bizarre reason, she pulls over and decides to go frolic in the meadow but all that happiness comes to an end when she steps on a bear-trap and is suddenly the prisoner of Plasterhead. Thus, the movie begins but it really gets choppy after that. The second kill doesn't come for another forty minutes after the initial one so my attention started to wander. The story was weak, the acting weaker and the make-up the weakest. It was a step above a student film but definitely a step below a major studio film, but I don't know where that leaves their future. So, in the end, one homicidal maniac with a face covered with paper mache, four dumba@@ kids, one pissed off sheriff, one cow head, seven kills total...presuming the kid doesn't make it at the end when she ditches out. That was pretty f-ing lame now that I think about it. I give it two stars because one scene scared me, I swear, but it was so tiring watching this movie, I could barely keep my eyes open. Pass.",1298505600,2,1276,4.411016949152542
8215267,2,B000UVV2AQ,"This movie had a good story but the movie kept going on with nothing really happening. Plasterhead would appear but really do nothing important. He was probably the dumbest horror villian i've ever seen. The few death scenes are decent but nothing that made me stand up and say cool. The last half hour really gets dark and you can barely see the movie.

Overall, didn't have bad acting and there is a story. However, it goes nowhere and I really wouldnt recommend it to anyone who is looking for gore and killings.",1278201600,,515,4.537634408602151
8215268,4,B000UVV2AQ,"""Plasterhead"" is unique in it's ability to pay homage to the great slasher fims of the 1980's. A lot of the (who done it) murderer flicks of the last decade or so, seem to insist on placing an ordinary coed or long lost relative as the serial killer by the end of the story. This is okay from time to time, but what I really miss from the genre, are the truly frightening villains of days gone by (A.K.A. Jason, Freddy, Michael and Leatherface)...
""Plasterhead"" provides us with a new revisioning of this, through the birth of ""Ray Williams"" (A.K.A. Plasterhead). A man tortured and disfigured, before being left for dead by the townsfolk of Rolling Glen some years ago. Enter the horror movie standard ""Dumb Teenagers"" on a roadtrip to Florida, who must stop in the small West Virginia town to unravel the mystery of a discarded purse, and you have the makings of a slasher flick for next generation.
 Cinematically ""Plasterhead"" looks outstanding, and director Kevin Higgins certainly has an eye for what ""Horror"" should look like.
The story has it's merits, and puts an original spin on the ""Brooding"" villain seeking his revenge concept.
Where the film falters, is in it's young (no name) actors, whom appear quite stiff in front of the camera, and deliver their lines like they're reading a book. Some performances are better then others, with the stand-outs being Ernest Dancy as ""David"" and Brandon Slagle as ""Henry"".
Southern accents seem to be an issue for those actors who are playing folks from West Virginia, as their East Coast vocabulary always bleeds through. Another constant problem appears to be the locations, as Plasterhead's house is immaculate and doesn't really fit in with the mystique of his character.
Aside from these issues, ""Plasterhead"" manages to entertain, especially fans of the 80's slasher genre. The gore in admirable, and the musical score fills the viewer with suspense and dread. Keeping in mind that this is a low budget independent film, ""Plasterhead"" should be a welcomed addition to any Horror fan's collection.",1238025600,2,2054,4.936416184971098
8215269,3,B000UVV2AQ,"This movie was really surprisingly good.considering its a direct to dvd movie and an indie slasher the director shows that if he had more money to work with we'd have another icon of horror.the story itself is really good and creepy(i don't wanna spoil it),the monster and his backstory are original,and his face without the plaster cast(seen in the begining of the film)is trully a greusome sight to behold.i think horror fans will be really surprised by the quality of this film.not much gore or blood but its understandable considering the budget this movie probably had.hopfully they make a sequal,with a bigger budget.but go see this film,rent it if you don't wanna buy it but trust me horror and slasher fans will NOT be disapointed.",1228348800,,739,4.92
8215270,2,B000UVV2AQ,"*** My review may contain spoilers, so please read at your own risk.  Thank You. *****

Started out all right, with a young lady with some old newspaper clippings, wanting to learn the real story about, ""Plasterhead/Ray Williams"".  Of course she's toast the first 10 minutes of the film.  Enter 4 college buddies on their way to Miami, who make a pit stop in a small town and find a messenger bag filled with 500 dollars and old newspaper clippings about some, ""Bad stuff"" that happened a few years ago.  Turns out the stories may or not be true regarding a young man of color who stopped into the town years before and the local boys didn't take kindly to him and hurt him big time. Sheriff Earl Taggart covered the whole thing up and since then, Ray Williams / Plasterhead, hasn't been too happy.

The 4 friend's stop at the house whose address is listed in the messenger bag they find.  No one home.....or so they think.  Ray Williams / Plasterhead grabs a couple of the kids right away and does his thing ( involving sharp instruments ) to them.  Sheriff Earl Taggart  comes charging in, in a sterotypical, ""Good ole Boy"" way and is particularly harsh with one of the remaining 4 friends.  The supposed, ""good girl"" heroine of the group eventually escapes, runs over her previously captured boyfriend in her escape vehicle, and doesn't bother to stop and see if he's okay.  You see her drive off in the sherriff's car and then the credits roll.  It's like the movie ended too fast and left a lot of questions unexplained.  In all fairness though, the acting wasn't bad.",1209254400,,1573,4.551601423487544
