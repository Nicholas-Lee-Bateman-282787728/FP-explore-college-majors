8374989,5,B00004YKMY,I have been looking forward to this movie since I became a Kawajiri fan watching Highlander search for vengeance.  I am thrilled with the action and the voices of Wendi Lee & Steve Blum. I highly recommend this to fans of this genre. Enjoy!,1351641600,,240,4.454545454545454
8374990,5,B00004YKMY,"I bought the first ova vhs years ago before the dvd craze, and completely  forgot about getting the second one, That is until I stumbled across it on amazon. A great buy, that is if you like the oldschool ultraviolent anime like I do.",1226361600,,234,4.318181818181818
8374991,5,B00004YKMY,"I know a lot of anime, and I can say you this one is  very good. It made me think to Cyber City and Ninja Scroll for the graphism, but in fact it's different from the others. It's very dark and violent, and I had a lot of fun during fights. Gokuu is very strange, and the idea he has a special  eye is very good. So buy it!!",985996800,,324,3.681159420289855
8374992,5,B00004YKMY,For lovers of anime this is a must see. Goku 2 has  the best artwork I've seen in a long time. The  story is real good. it keeps you one your toes. I don't want to tell you the story. But if you are a  fan of the first one then you will be a fan of this  one. I give this movie 5 stars. It is a must buy.,970444800,4,304,3.3
