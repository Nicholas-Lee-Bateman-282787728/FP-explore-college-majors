These are five of his greatest films, including his Oscar-winning role as ""Rooster Cogburn"" in ""True Grit"", and his last film ""The Shootist"", for which he should have won an Oscar and which Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly calls ""The best western I've ever seen.""

1711878,5,B00006674Y,"Very nice box set of some of The Duke's best pictures. In ""The Shootist"" see excellent scenes with Lauren Bacall, Ron Howard, Scatman Crothers, and Jimmy Stweart. ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" has some excellent work, and a few scenes with Johnnie Crawford who played the 'son' character on ""The Rifleman"" with Chuck Connors.  There's also a scene where John Wayne rides a horse backwards straight as an arrow for quite a distance as he didn't want to turn his back on his adversaries. Horsemanship like that you don't see in movies any more. And it wasn't some stuntman either. All 5 pictures are worth watching again and again, a true test of really good films.",1256169600,,659,4.681034482758621

1711884,5,B00006674Y,"If you are a fan of John Wayne's famous OOAK swagger and tough guy drawl, you should own this DVD set. Always a class act, this is certainly some of John Wayne's most memorable 10 gallon hat entertainment. His style and heart were as big as Texas. His acting range is amazing, though seemingly stone faced, true fans always ""get"" his very subtle but sincere emotion. Highly recommended by a ""fan"", I also bought this for my 83 year old father. A great gift!",1168300800,2,457,4.4523809523809526

Maybe they forgot to add it when they made this DVD and it was very disapointing so that is why I only gave it 2 stars. Maybe you can look at this problem for me. A great movie

1711886,5,B00006674Y,"Five excellent John Wayne movies that span the latter portion of his career.  Each movie in this collection is special in its own way.  Liberty Valance has the great pairing of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart.  Throw in a terrific bad guy by Lee Marvin and a host of familiar characters and you've got magic.  Katie Elder has action, suspense and Dean Martin.  True Grit, an Oscar performance, also feature a young Glen Campbell and Robert Duvall, always fun to watch.  The Shootist is the capstone of Wayne's career.  Wayne went out with his boots on, in the movie and in his career.  Finally there is El Dorado, my personal favorite.  Relaxed, conversational dialogue, action packed plot, characters you can like and care about form the basis of great movie making.  Sure the story was done before,even by John Wayne in Rio Bravo, but who cares??  All in all this is a great set for the John Wayne fan or for the person who wants to know what he was about.",1149206400,7,955,4.526315789473684

1711889,5,B00006674Y,"While a Western 'purist' would certainly prefer seeing a 'dream' boxed set of John Ford/John Wayne's 'Cavalry' trilogy, ""Stagecoach"", and ""The Searchers"" released together, the ""John Wayne DVD Gift Set"" is an excellent collection of some of the Duke's finest westerns from his last two decades.

The classic of the collection is ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", John Ford's 1962 'deconstruction' of the genre he'd helped to create. A visually simple, yet deeply layered tale of how a western legend was born, the film echoes Ford's ""The Last Hurrah"", as well as taking a tongue-in-cheek 'jab' at critics of his more idealized earlier westerns. While Jimmy Stewart, at 55, is far too old to play an idealistic young lawyer, his confrontations with desperado Lee Marvin, and pragmatic (yet ultimately doomed romantic) Wayne are terrific. And don't miss Edmund O'Brien's 'takeoff' on actor Thomas Mitchell, in support...Ford's directorial 'style' was never better than in this remarkable film.

""The Sons of Katie Elder"" is an important film in Wayne's career, as it marked his 'comeback' after losing a lung to cancer. While much of his dialogue had to be 'looped', and oxygen was kept nearby throughout the filming, Wayne proved that he could still play an action hero believably. Certainly, he looked all of his 58 years, and the idea of Dean Martin being one of his brothers is farfetched, but when Wayne first appeared on the screen, 1965 film audiences stood and cheered...and his dominating presence still makes the film 'work', today.

""El Dorado"" is, if you are unfamiliar with the film, simply a reworking of 1959's Hawks/Wayne classic, ""Rio Bravo"", but it stands very well on it's own merits, beginning with the terrific chemistry between Wayne and co-star Robert Mitchum. A very young James Caan offers a funny counterpoint to the two veteran stars, and wonderful character actor, Arthur Hunnicutt (who, for trivia fans, played Davy Crockett in 1955's ""The Last Command""...thus making this a unique opportunity to see TWO Davy Crocketts in one film!) plays a rustic variation of Walter Brennan from the earlier film. With plenty of Howard Hawks' signature comraderie, the film is very entertaining.

""True Grit"" is, of course, John Wayne's Oscar-winning role, as pot-bellied, one-eyed Rooster Cogburn. While many believe Wayne won for his career longevity rather than his performance, the film is, in fact, very entertaining and lyrical, and Wayne's portrayal is the glue that holds it together. Certainly, Glen Campbell offers a less-than-stellar performance, but it is more than compensated for by Kim Darby and Robert Duvall, and Wayne, guns blazing, reins clenched in his teeth, provides an image that has become classic.

Finally, there is ""The Shootist"", Wayne's final film. Shot as the Duke's health was declining, dramatically, the production was a difficult one, with director Don Siegel struggling to work with the ailing actor (Co-star Ron Howard would say he learned more about directing from this film, than any other). Because of the Duke's fragile condition, many friends took roles at far below their usual salaries to work with him a last time (including James Stewart, Richard Boone, and Lauren Bacall). The finished film is a labor of love, from the ""Classic Wayne"" film clips that open the story, to the final gunbattle, with Wayne's character, the cancer-ridden John Bernard Books, going out in a blaze of glory. It may not have been among Wayne's 'best' films, but it was certainly a most fitting end to his career.

It's easy to see why this is a worthy Wayne collection to own...But don't take my word for it; buy it, and see for yourself!",1115856000,43,3675,5.086235489220564
1711890,5,B00006674Y,"Maybe some reviews haven't been of help  because you haven't SEEN all of the movies on this DVD (and others not on it) as some reviewers have; maybe I can help. ""El Dorado"" (1967) is nothing more than a remake of Wayne's 1959 classic ""Rio Bravo"" with James Caan as a more inept gunman (if a better actor) than Ricky Nelson's character in the original, Robert Mitchum is in the Dean Martin role and Arthur Hunnicut replaces Walter Brennan as the crusty oldtimer.  ""Rio Lobo"" in 1970 (the least of them all) was also a remake of ""Rio Bravo"", trust me. (When you got a winner, stick to it).  By now you know the plot of ""True Grit"" taken from a novel. Glen Campbell joked (?) that the Duke looked so good and won an Oscar because he (Campbell) was so bad but Wayne matched the performances of formidable actors Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper and Strother Martin. Also giving good performances in their smaller roles were Jeremy Slate and Tennessee Jack Pickard. Myron Healey (the orignal Doc Holliday on TV's ""Wyatt Earp"") has a cameo as a deputy early in the picture.  Not to be forgotten is Kim Darby (at least 21 and not 14 like the character) whose character spoke the most overenunciated English I've ever heard for a character from Arkansas.  ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", director John Ford's classic work on the power of fame, even if unearned, also has a lot of faces familiar to those who love Westerns.  Vera Miles is beautiful here and a talented actress in a slightly subdued part as the love interest of both Wayne and Jimmy Stewart which adds to the poignancy of the plot.  Stewart is a given (still looking young in his 50s) but the movie also showcases familiar Western actors John Carradine, Woody Strode, Andy Devine (a Ford favorite) and others with a nasty Lee Marvin as the cowardly bully, Liberty Valance, and a typically weasely Strother Martin (again) and classic badman actor Lee Van Cleef (""High Noon"", two Eastwood spaghetti Westerns, etc.) as Liberty's henchmen.  You have to respect ""Katie Elder""; at the time of her death in the movie, her oldest son (Wayne) was 58 and the youngest (Michael Anderson, Jr.) was 22 in real life.  John Wayne was not well when the movie was made but you can't tell it. Earl Holliman and Dean Martin (again) provide strong support in gaining back what was stolen from Katie and her husband.  ""The Shootist"", the Duke's last picture, was actually underrated but was his most poignant as he ended up as did his character with terminal cancer.  His dying gunfighter is the prominent character given strong co-star support which included Jimmy Stewart (again) in a smaller role, Ron Howard, Lauren Bacall, Richard Boone, TV's ""Wyatt Earp"", Hugh O'Brian, classic dancehall-type Sheree North and (with an over-the-top performance) Harry Morgan (TV's ""Mash"" and many others).  It was an appropriate farewell for the much beloved icon Wayne who was in the movie for 50 years (40 as a star).  This is a very good DVD to be in your collection.",1100131200,6,2995,4.7036328871892925
1711891,5,B00006674Y,"This splendid collection of John Wayne's Westerns is a must-have for any fan or would-be fan of John Wayne (if you don't have these films already, that is).  It contains some of the Duke's best movies, at an affordable price and in an attractive packaging.  All of these movies are great:
THE SHOOTIST was the Duke's last film, and is truly a door-closing sort of movie.  It is a fitting end to a very long and very great career.  Wayne plays an old, dying gunfighter who is ready to hang up his guns but just cannot be left alone to die in peace.
THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER:  Wayne stars as John Elder, the eldest son of a woman named Katie who has just died.  John and his three younger brothers (one of them played by Dean Martin) return to their hometown to mourn their mother and to set things right with the people who wronged her.
TRUE GRIT:  Old, fat, and ornery.  That describes Rooster Cogburn (played by Wayne) as well as anything.  Duke one an Oscar for his performance in this film.  Truly, this is a unique character for Wayne, and a good film.
EL DORADO:  This is one of my favorite of Duke's movies.  He plays a gunfighter-turned-deputy, and fights to aid his alchoholic friend (the sheriff) of a gang of outlaws infesting the town.  Features James Caan in a great performance as 'Mississippi.'
THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALLANCE: Wayne stars opposite James Stewart in this John Ford classic.  Wayne's character (Tom Doniphan) is a rancher/gunman whose noble spirit saves the life of a young lawyer (Stewart) come to bring 'order' to the small territorial town of Shinbone.
These are five great films by the Duke, three of them (Liberty Vallance, the Shootist, El Dorado) among the Duke's best (in my opinion), and all of them very enjoyable.  This box set makes a great addition to any home DVD library.",1055721600,27,1816,4.561728395061729
1711892,4,B00006674Y,"I received this set as a Christmas gift.  I am pleased to now own a DVD version of ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" which is my favorite Western and ""True Grit"" which previously held that personal title.  I was also happy to own ""The Shootist"" which ranks as a near-great Wayne movie.  I will enjoy ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" a time or two again but I am disappointed that ""El Dorado"" couldn't have been replaced by the better movie it copied; ""Rio Bravo"".  This is, of course, the problem with movie ""sets"".  I'm not sure whether the person or persons who put these collections together include lesser movies in order to market them better or whether they really think that they're in the same class as the others.  What would have been hard to top would have been ""Red River"" replacing ""The Sons of Katie Elder""  along with the aforementioned switch to ""Rio Bravo"".  Oh well, at least it didn't include ""Rio Lobo"".",1049500800,4,917,4.515151515151516
