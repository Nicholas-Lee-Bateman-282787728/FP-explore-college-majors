It was so worth the wait.  I think Media Blasters did a great job, and I can't wait to see my 4 kawaii bishounen in another edition.  That's another thing too, there's 5 episodes on here guys, I mean, what other animes offer you that!?  This is a great buy, there's laughs, tears, anger, and every other emotion you can think of.  So buy it today!

1630550,4,B00005NB8H,"The ultimate bishounen (beautiful boy) anime has finally made its official bow on U.S. shores. Fangirls who have worn out their fansubs (and who spent many hours cringing at typos like ""Byce"" instead of Weiss) now have crisp, clear DVDs to drool over (and they keyword here is drool . . . eye candy has always been the main thing this series had going for it, although its plotline also makes an excellent springboard for fanfiction). The premise: Four young men are Tokyo florists by day, vigilantes by night. Under the aegis of the secret Kritiker organization, they eliminate heinous criminals who have slipped out of the grasp of the authorities. The episodes contained on this disc explore the pasts of two of the group members, Ken and Yohji, and show how much of a ""normal"" life all four have to sacrifice to complete their mission. (Including heterosexual romance. Small wonder this series has spawned so much yaoi -- male-male love -- fanfiction). So, it's not high art -- so what? These discs deliver good, mindless fun -- action, nice music and ""anime babes who make me think the wrong thing"" -- for relaxing at the end of a long day with a bucket of popcorn, and there's certainly nothing wrong with that. Those familiar with the original fansubs should avoid the dubbed version on this disc like the plague . . . the character voices are all wrong, especially Omi, who sounds 10 years too old and has lost all of his sweet innocence. But the subbed version is superb, with readable titles that don't distract from the lovely view of the boys. If you're a fan of bishounen stuff, like Gundam Wing, Kenshin or Tokyo Babylon/X, by all means, check this out.",1009411200,12,1667,4.673469387755102

1630554,5,B00005NB8H,"The first video in the Weiss Kreuz series will finally become available, which is something I've been waiting for for a long time.  I became obsessed with the series months ago when my friend let me borrow her tapes she got from Japan.  I was drooling by the end of the first episode.  Now, I've seen every single episode and the first OAV movie.  Everything in the series is near perfect.  The plot is dark and yet beautiful, with pretty well done animation to boot.  And I immediately downloaded the music and burned it.  Well, I'm done raving about the series; it's time to get back to Diablo II.  Read some other reviews to find out about the storyline, which, if I haven't mention, is wicked.  Okay, that's all I'm going to say.",1002844800,2,733,4.451127819548872
1630555,4,B00005NB8H,"Or something like that, I forget the correct quote. *looks sheepish* The brainchild of the band Weiss (aka the main voice actors for the series) Weiss Kreuz is full of eye candy, and one of the more surprising plotlines I have seen. Usually, one can guess the nature of a series from the get go, but there's a few loops thrown into this one! About four bishounen (pretty boys) turned assassins with equally tragic pasts fighting against unjustice that is untracible by normal Japanese law. It is worth a glance (or more).",1002067200,5,521,4.673913043478261

The story is more than your usual anime, with plenty of death to go around.  What made it for me was the voice acting in the original Japanese.  The voice actors bring a depth of emotion that is hardly ever found in American dubbing.  Buy it now! ^_^",998438400,,370,4.083333333333333
1630557,5,B00005NB8H,I seriously just watched my subtitled version of Weiss Kreuz and just said I wished it was dubbed. This is a great series filled with comedy and drama in one about a group of (beautiful) assassins taking on missions that eventually all tie into one. I loved the subtitled version but I prefer me dubs so this should be great!!!!,997747200,,328,4.483333333333333
1630558,4,B00005NB8H,"This anime is one of the first I've picked up. I'll just share my opinion since the 1st reviewer did such a great job of explaining events, characters, plot...etc.  The animation isn't the greatest, however it is at times impressive. It's chock-full of great voice actors, that's a plus. The soundtrack and image albums are euphonic.  It shares the humanity of the antagonists, which is quite common in anime. Therefore, in my opionion, although this may be an action-packed, bishounen-full series, it still grasps on to depth within the story and characters.  I did enjoy the series and the characters, but there seemed to have something missing within the storyline...a bit choppy (like my review), if you ask me.  Nevertheless, this is one of the more appealing animes, I believe, because it breaks away from the 12-year old superhero/mecha-dominated shows that are oh-so-common.  This series does contain some humor (meaning superdeformed/funny faces/sweatdrops kinda thing), not as much as Fushigi Yuugi, and not anyless than Gundam W.  So all in all, the cute boys (especially Ken and Schuldich ^_^) shallowly make up for the relatively inconsistant storyline and the music makes up for the less than super animation.
BTW...I didn't watch the DVD version, I watched it in the original Japanese.",997056000,5,1300,5.166666666666667
1630579,4,B00005NB8H,"When I first came across this title, I was interested.  Aya, Yoji, Ken, and Omi are the four young men who are florists during the day but at night, comprise Weiss Kreuz, an assassin group who eliminates certain menaces to society.
Animation is superb, action is generally well done and the amazing music are actually sung by the seiyuus(voice actors) themselves whom have formed a singing group.  Despite this, I find the plot to be slow at times and uninteresting, which caused me to fastfoward the certain sections.  I also found the story displayed in a rather choppy manner.  At one moment, you see Ken die and in the next, he's fine.  I quickly caught on to the plot again, but the moment of confusion pops by more than a couple of times.  Not a show for kids with its mature themes. I'm thinking PG 15 or so.
In general, each episode is worth some time and can stand on its own.  You get the villian of the week and some action.  There are also bits and pieces of the greater plot involving the Takatori's and you get to know the Weiss gang on a personal basis.
That was what stopped me from giving this show a three star rating.  This show is pure bishounen, meaning that it has been loaded with so many hot guys so that it is impossible not to fall in love with one of them.  Not only are they cute, but they actually got personality and alot goes into understanding what makes these guys tick.
As for the DVD, I liked the clear menu, though flipping through each episode kinda annoyed me.  There are some nice extras, such as the outtakes.  In general a show that has something for the mature guy and girl.  Definitely not a DVD for everyone.  I would suggest renting it if possible before purchasing it to see if this is to your taste.",1024617600,3,1746,4.365325077399381
1630580,3,B00005NB8H,"Overall, I think this was really great! I love the manga and I've been waiting for this for a long time.... I really DON'T like the voices. They [stink]. But anyway, the main reason I only gave this 3 stars is: WHERE IS NAGI?!?!...",1024531200,,231,4.2727272727272725
1630581,2,B00005NB8H,"...On the upside, the packaging and DVD menu for this are quite nice.  Anime Works does a great job with their DVD's--it's packed with features, my favorite being the outtakes by the English dub cast.  But I digress.
To put it simply: this anime is of poor quality.  The opening sequence is allright, but once it gets to the actual show the quality goes down tremendously.  My first thought when the show started was, ""Was this made in 1985?!""  The art and animation quality are THAT bad.  Now, something like that can be overlooked when there is a good story there, but there simply isn't.  This series, to put it simply, is about four men who are florists by day, and part of some big assassin ring by night.  They garner the affections of young schoolgirls who pass by their flowershop, and are masters of disguise.  For a show with such an out-there premise, it takes itself WAY too seriously.
Now, I was scratching my head as I suffered through the five episodes on this DVD wondering, ""What could anyone possibly see in this show?"" and the answer was clear.  Obviously, if you have an infatuation with any of the voice actors on the show you are going to love this.  To be honest, I'm a bit of a Koyasu Takehito fan myself, but this is hardly his best work [check out Master of Mosquiton to see him in something fantastic!].  Sure, the songs at the opening and closing are allright, but that's about it.
This show definitley had promise, but the sloppily done animation, cheesy storyline, and weak plots bring it down.  If you REALLY, and I do mean really, like the voice actors and must have every work they have done, then go ahead and buy it.  But if you're not like that, then don't.  If you like ""bishounens"" then go for another series, like Earthian or something.  This is simply not worth it--save your money!
The only reasons I'm not giving this 1 star [but 2] are that the DVD quality is great--lots of features; like I said before, the English dub outtakes are hilarious, and the opening sequence is actually pretty good.  Needless to say, I won't be continuing on with this series, but I'm glad I've seen it for myself and am now happily de-mystified.",1019088000,4,2168,4.517948717948718
1630582,5,B00005NB8H,"Big fan of the manga (especially Yohji-kun ^_^), and now I'm a definite fan of the anime!  Sure, Omi's outfits are awful, and the atmosphere can go from heartbreak to indigestion in a second, but Japanese girls (like myself) love that kinda thing!  I mean, it's soooo Rurouni Kenshin -- except Schuldig and Aya are prettier redheads than Kenshin, any day.",1017187200,,355,4.80327868852459
1630583,5,B00005NB8H,"Hey, I've been a big fan of Wei Kreuz for a long time had the entire series in fansubs and was really excited when they released it to American DVD.  I was very VERY disappointed in all the dubbed voices.  They didn't capture the characters like the original four.  I don't know who the American voice of Aya is but he is definatly not Koyasu.  I didn't mind the dubbing until episode two when Aya sees Taketori and screams out his name.  Ther person absolutly had no emotion in his voice during that scene that Koyasu has in the Japanese.  I only recommend getting the DVD of this anime that way you can watch the original four guys behind their characters.
Other then the dubbing the DVD is great it has little dubbing bloopers that make you sit back and laugh.  Also has a biographys on Koyasu and the gang.  In case you haven't picked up on it Koyasu is one of my favorite voice actors.  Seeing him now with an anime of him and his groups own creation is just the best.",1013385600,4,973,4.273224043715847

1630585,5,B00005NB8H,"Unlike some people(or is it one) I don't think this exploits anyone. I found it a refreshing change compared to a lot of the nicey-nicey anime out there. The heros are assasins and they know it, they do not try to cover it up. The assasins are in the service of good but have their own probs. Be forewarned, The first 2 episodes are ssslloooww and hard to get thru but it is worth it. The series picks up with the 3rd episode so slogging thru the intro stuff is ok. Pick it up you will like it.",1011744000,,494,4.051020408163265
1630586,5,B00005NB8H,"Why they called it Knight Hunters is beyond me. This is a story of 5 male friends who are assasins & any girl who gets too close to them dies.
If you liked X1999 the movie, Oagre Slayer, or Vampire Princess Miyu, this series is right up your alley.",1011744000,,248,4.081632653061225
1630587,3,B00005NB8H,"On some level, how can a show about a group of prettyboys who work in a flower shop by day and assasinate ""above the law"" villans by night go wrong? There is actually alot to like about Knight Hunters / Weiss Kreuz. The plot is actually far more complex than most anime of this ilk, and if you give the series time, the characters show a surprising amount of depth given the nature of the series. The show also rises above the ""villain of the week"" syndrome with some very well thought out within-episode storylines that hook you.
On the other hand, this show looks like it had a $100 budget. While the character designs are nice, they also look *very* dated once they show up on screen, and the animation is also extremely poor. Perhaps they were going for an style/theme effect, but for me it just reeks of low-budget b-team animation (lots of stills, extremely stilted motion, simplistic lines, obvious pencil lines everywhere, etc). Think along the lines of the original Bubblegum Crisis series.
Technically, the DVD itself does a fine job. The picture is true to the source material, and the sound is fine. So if you can look past the extremely bland visuals, you might discover a series well worth your time. Decent number of episodes per disc makes it less of a risk, as well.",1011225600,,1283,4.582608695652174

The animation is horrible, and the story is pretty bad. One episode from this dvd had good animation, that's it.
But it's not just animation that makes an anime good, it's everything. But this one had not only bad animation, but bad everything. English voice acting sucked, the japanese voice acting was decent, as it usually always is. Do not be decieved by the pretty box art! I was... and by god did I pay for my mistake.. yeah. 20 freaking dollars! LOL.. do youself a favour and don't buy this.

7946592,4,B00005NB8H,"Aya, Ken, Yohiji, and Omi are florists by day, and silent killers in a war against crime and evil at night.  Classic bishonen (beautiful boys) our heros have dark pasts, haunting memories, and a tendency to tragic relationships, sprinkled with light banter and serious mayhem.  The people they are fighting are archetypically evil - gambling on death fights, providing women for violence, and poisoning health drinks.  The kind of folks you wouldn't mind dead.

I wouldn't call the episodes repetitious, but they do follow a form - using interconnections between the characters personal lives and the ongoing assassination to build a whole story.  This allows for considerable variation and one has to credit the writers with making an effort to avoid the overly hackneyed.  It quickly becomes obvious that the violence isn't the plot, but the backdrop for the emotional development of the characters.

The artwork is to about a 2001 standard.  Better than many efforts, but is quickly eclipsed by what is being done at present.  Sometimes it is hard to remember that work that was great when it came out can look very tame a few years later.  Nothing wrong here, but don't expect fine details or complex animation.  The dubbed version works very well, although the actors have trouble with some common Japanese names.  This is one of those occasions where the actors reworked the Japanese script and managed to avoid the awkwardness that often plagues word-for-word translations.\

A high level of action, lots of emotional content, and characters that are easy to look at, this is one of the better examples of shojo (for women) anime.  One that manages to hold interest across the gender barrier as well.  Mainstream it is, but good mainstream.",1099440000,,1747,5.017361111111111
7946593,5,B00005NB8H,"I don't know where all these reviewers are coming up with the notion that Cheesiness, Angst, & Extreme High Melodrama are *surprising*-- or *unwanted*-- in a shojo anime. Come on! Really. This is for us. We want our angst and family tragedies and long-lost siblings and haunted pasts and Good Vs. Evil and unrequited love and knee-weakeningly beautiful boys... we want it all, and we want it bloody.
That said, the Weiss Kreuz collection is one of the best things that you could possibly take home & watch on the sofa with your box of chocolates & your pink tissues. Four pretty young things, each one with a worse revenge-complex than the next, all with clashing personalities; an expansion on the buddy-cop concept, only better... four pretty young vicious bloodthirsty international assassin boys who run a flower-shop. And of course they're all straight. If you don't love an idea like that right away, then you shouldn't be renting this in the first place.
The DVD edition is fabulous, easy to navigate, crammed with features, sketches, interviews, you name it. I was especially (pleasantly) surprised at the existence of outtakes. Recording all that drama had to be taxing, so it must've been a scream to make a pink-clad Omi say, ""But I can only dance to Madonna.""
You can watch most of these stories independently of each other without worrying about the overarching plot, which is nice for those who don't want the full collection. The boys get a mission, they go out and find the bad guys, and much fighting & bickering ensues. Most episodes have at least some brokenhearted weeping, and they all have bloodshed (although the fight-sequence style in this anime doesn't do much for me). If you're lucky, you'll get to see the gang of psychic/psychotic villain boys, who are even more interesting than the heroes. You can start watching with an eye to just absorbing the cheesy missions, but you will soon be hooked on the tangled interpersonal relationships and vendettas, which is, after all, the point.
I personally like the animation well enough; it's not groundbreaking, but it does not look like 1987, either. The dubs and subs are equally good here, in my opinion. They put a nice amount of effort into it. I think the English translation was pretty great, very natural-sounding. Bold yellow subtitles were easy to read. The voice actors were often lackluster, I agree with everyone on that point. I privately think Aya could be even bitchier (although he couldn't be colder, which was nice), Omi even squeakier, and Farfarello even crazier. But Schuldig's erotically snide baritone is the definite bright-point of the English dub; you may find yourself listening to him purr ""ruined lives taste like honey"" repeatedly until you freeze up your Pause button.",1082937600,7,2772,4.950643776824034

7946599,5,B00005NB8H,"I've been into this series, Weiss Kreuz, for years; named Knight Hunters for its commercial release here in the states.  I normally dread to see releases of series that I like commercially, but in this case, the DVD edition of this series is truly one of the better that I own. The quality of the image and sound are both very high, and at five episodes a disc and a good amount of extras it is well priced.
In the case of anime in general, I normally do not support dubbing of anime, believing that it takes away from the original work. For this release, Media Blasters/Anime Works has done the series justice in both languages.  While I don't necessarily prefer the dub, it is worth watching for some of the completely ad-lib lines that you don't find in the subtitled version.  The American voice actors are not spectacular in my opinion, but they aren't terrible either. I do like the voice actor that does Yoji's voice for the simple fact that he can ad-lib lines so perfectly and they fit in with the character's personality. Sometimes there are points when the English just doesn't seem to go too well and comes out sounding a little weird. Still, my opinion might be a little biased since three of the four main Japanese voice actors (seiyuu) are among my favorites, and it's hard to accept any English voice for those characters. I do consider that the dubbing is above average and it would be fine for someone who does prefer dubbing rather than subtitles. While there are slight changes to the script it does not take away much from the translation itself. Since it is a DVD though, there is always the choice of both Japanese and English vocal tracks, so if you prefer one version rather than the other you can just change the setting. Both the dub and sub translations are thorough and true to the original script.
In addition, the extras on the DVDs are a wonderful addition. I was extremely excited to find out that the voice actor talk sessions from the original Japanese VHS release made it into the American DVD release (starting in the second DVD). I thoroughly enjoyed those subtitled topic discussion sessions since the only time I saw them before was years ago without subtitles and before I had an adequate understanding of Japanese. The production sketch gallery was very interesting, sketches being taken from the Japanese artbooks, and the English outtakes were hilarious.  Overall, this DVD and the others in the series are ""must buys"" for any anime fan that likes action series, bishounen/pretty boys or really neat extras.",1026172800,4,2551,4.700223713646532
