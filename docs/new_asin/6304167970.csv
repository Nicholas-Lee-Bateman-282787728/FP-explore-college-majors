809956,3,6304167970,"Race the Sun (1996) is the story of a racing team from Konawaena High School in Hawaii that built a solar powered car and raced it in the World Solar Challenge in Australia. The course covers 2000 miles of Australia's worst road conditions - the Stuart Highway, from Darwin to Adelaide. The surface of the asphalt called bitumen, a mix of rougher and larger stones to resist road wear and increase traction during flash floods, is very rough on the tires. Extreme road temperatures are also common (150 degrees Fahrenheit). Several off-asphalt detours provide especially trying conditions for the experimental vehicles. Other hazards include three trailer road trains that are nearly fifty meters long and travel at better than 70 mph along the highway, creating severe wind vortices.

In 1990, the race was entered by the Hawaiin High School team. After several days, it became obvious that the high school race would be close, and, in the final two days, media focused on the unofficial battle of the high schools. Konawaena continued to pass other entrants and, on the last day, passed Dripstone High School from Australia to lead the pack.  Konawaena maintained that lead and was the first high school team ever to finish the World Solar Challenge. The team finished 18th overall out of 38 entrants, beating many corporate and university teams in the process.

The movie is loosely based on that race, but instead of a rivalry with another High School team from Australia, there is a pompous European, Hans Kooiman (Steve Zahn) as well as their corporate sponsor, trying to bribe them to throw the race, and when they run out of enemies, they can always fight amongst themselves, or at the very least, they can fight their own low self esteem.

It's kind of predictable, but surprisingly entertaining. You can easily get caught up in the drama and competition. The race covers the whole continent of Australia, from top to bottom, and it is stunning terrain indeed.

The cast features (Hit 'N Run) Halle Berry, as the science teacher who inspires the low achieving kids to step up to the competition. This is long before her biggest triumph, winning the Oscar for Monster's Ball, and also long before some of her flops, like Catwoman, or Storm, in X-Men (I know X-Men did OK at the box office and spawned several sequels, but Miss Berry was nominated for a Razzie award for bad acting, for X-men and Catwoman both. She is one of three woman to win both awards, the other two being Faye Dunnaway and Liza Minnelli).

Jim Belushi plays the shop teacher who is initially skeptical that the students will finish the project, let alone the race, but once they get underway, he throws his weight into it. Not a fan of Jim's, but he did OK here, and was well cast.

Casey Affleck also knows how it is to be overshadowed by a talented brother, but here he does an adequate job in one of his very first roles. He is an inarticulate kid who likes to express himself only through drawing, and the job of designing a solar powered car seems tailor made for him. His name is Daniel Webster, but the name was chosen for irony, because he has a limited vocabulary and is a terrible speller. He is an outcast among outcasts, as being White he is a minority. Bad boy Eduardo keeps calling him howly, but at least he doesn't call him a mahu.

Eliza Dushku plays Cindy Johnson, Daniel Webster's step sister. She was Faith in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She continues with her usual ""edgy"" characterizations. Anthony Ruivivar plays Eduardo Braz, the obligatory ""bad boy.""

Dion Basco stands out as the class clown, Marco Kito. Ditto for J. Moki Cho, as Gilbert Tutu. He is a gentle giant, who is kind of goofy but has hidden talent as a computer whiz. Nadja Pionilla is Oni Nagano, Adriane Napualani Uganiza is Luana Kanahele, and Sara Tanaka plays Uni Kakamura. She was cute and flirtatious, and I think her name was another little joke. Uni is the word for Sea Urchin, used in sushi.

Steve Zahn was the pompous Hans Kooiman. I loved hating him, and I loved rooting for him to lose the race. He was the apotheosis of hubris. Steve usually plays the sidekick and is more of a quirky character actor. He had a small part in Reality Bites. He makes a great villain.

809957,4,6304167970,"For curious movie buffs, ""Race the Sun"" is a blend of ""Breaking Away"", ""Walkabout"", and ""Summer School""; making it quite unique and considerably better than its rating. It's neither ambitious nor technically brilliant; in fact the cinematography somehow manages to NOT capture the inherent scenic beauty of a series of Hawaiian and Australian locations. But the casting and directing are solid and the story has so much charm that you don't mind it being corny and predictable.

Halle Berry and James Belushi play teachers at a Hawaiian technical high school who reluctantly sponsor a team of students building a solar-powered car. ""Race the Sun"" was inspired by a group of Hawaiian students who actually entered the World Solar Challenge in 1980. The film would have been better if the cartoonish corporate villain had been replaced by some actual scientific explanations and a bit of background on the race itself. Speaking of cartoons, the solar cars look like something out of ""Wacky Races"" but there is no sign of Penelope Pitstop in this entertaining race.

The school is in Hawaii, which makes for some interesting cultural details (as does the race's Austrialian setting), but for viewer identification purposes the settings could be anywhere.

Thankfully the film avoids a couple of obvious traps. Berry and Belushi end up liking and respecting each other but there are no obligatory romantic sparks between them. Likewise for Casey Affleck and Elisha Dushku (who plays his step-sister).

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1179705600,,1543,5.135458167330677
809958,2,6304167970,"This movie was ""okay"" but if I hadn't been from Hawaii, I doubt if it would have held my interest. If you are from Hawaii, don't expect all the characters to be authentic - seems like they had mainland actors trying to act like locals. The acting and the script were sub-par. Fortunately, I watched on TV so I could turn away whenever the racing part was not on. Who wants to watch typical adolescent conversations if they can avoid it? This is one of those stupid PG movies that will not hold an adult's interest but they throw in some bad words and a middle finger so you wouldn't want your kids to watch it.",1172361600,,610,4.267241379310345
809959,5,6304167970,"I teach science and this is entertaining and deals with science and science fairs, the kids love it and it is inspirational.

809990,1,6304167970,"I'm simply amazed at the reviews this film has received so far; nearly 5 stars???  You gotta be kidding!
Race the Sun was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Halle Berry (who is GORGEOUS), James Belushi, and Steve Zahn.
The movie brings to the screen the story of several Hawaiian High School kids that in trying to put together a high school project end up participating in a Cannonball Run type race in Australia.
The acting is surprisingly (!) weak, the humor and the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is just bearable, and then there's the great locations; Hawaii and Australia...
It seems as though the actors/directors/producers went to the isles on vacation separately, while there they met up with each other at the hotel lounge over Pina Coladas, and then decided, on the spot, to make the best of their stay by doing a quick and easy film on the side for some extra cash/spending money.
In short:
Belushi's character was next to non-existent and really not the great; he was unexpectedly plain and bland.
Halle Berry and Steve Zahn were given terrible lines.  What a waste of talent...
Most of the kids' (especially the girls) acting was sad, with the exception of Casey Affleck who seems promising.
So it's a weak plot, terrible dialogues, bad acting, a great setting, wonderful music, and a good cast, which when put together fail to take off.
The potential for a decent movie was definitely there.
In a nutshell, it's an ok movie if you're under 13 and/or are heavily intoxicated, and that's about it; no masterpiece here... Wait till they show it on TV.",1153440000,,1605,4.749103942652329
809991,5,6304167970,"I have enjoyed this movie, I have been looking for this movie for awhile.  All the movies that I have bought are the movies that I love and have not been able to find in the stores.",1141171200,,181,3.891891891891892
809992,3,6304167970,"A feel-good film about a bunch of disadvantaged kids from a school in Hawaii who miraculously secure a spot in the annual Darwin to Adelaide international solar car race.

Reminiscient of the old Andy Hardy movies, the kids overcome all the odds to borrow, beg and steal the materials  for their car. The usual array of Hollywood good guys and bad guys don't detract from the convincing performances of James Belushi and Halle Berry to make a good flick the whole family can enjoy.

Also suitable for science & technology high school classes studying solar energy.",1129680000,7,564,4.854166666666667
809993,5,6304167970,This movie is so cute! It just teaches us how to deal with the problems that life brings to us. And Eliza Dushku kicks ass!,1104105600,3,123,3.96
809994,3,6304167970,"Dude, you still don't know who Jim Belushi is. James Gandolfini is in ""The Sopranos."" Jim Belushi is the brother of the late John Belushi (""Animal House"" and ""Blues Brothers""). He co-stars in the ABC-TV show called ""The World According To Jim.""

Anyway, most of the reviews are correct. This IS a fun film to watch and be part of. The bulk of it was filmed in Australia. I was in Maroubra (which is a suburb of Sydney) when they were filming the scenes of the race's start. I got a chance to talk with J. Moki Cho (who plays Gilbert Tutu) and Jim Belushi actually said ""how's it going?"" to me while he was in the makeup chair. I have a photo of Halle Berry standing underneath an sun umbrella and nearly bumped into Kevin Tighe (remember the TV show ""Emergency""?) as we came around a corner of the convenience.",1103068800,2,810,4.364238410596027
809995,5,6304167970,this movie was the greatest movie considering it took place in a small island. this shows that it dosen't matter where you are from but it shows how much time and effort you put into something and you really have to want it to win!

809996,5,6304167970,"Wow, we just watched this today in science and I was amazed. This movie is really entertaining, with a cast of some major actors to back it up (Jim Belushi, Halle Berry and Casey Affleck who is Ben Affleck's younger brother). The story is really inspirational. Based on a true story, it follows a group of high school students who come together in detention class.  Things happen in the beginning, giving these kids the motivation to build a solar car and race in the world championships. After overcoming many obstacles, the team eventually makes it into the big games.
Here's where things get interesting, as we look into each character's personality. For instance, we have the stereotypical fat guy whom no one would expect to fit into a car, let alone race. Then there's the troubled girl with the alcohol problem, who gets disqualified from the races. Next comes the nerdy girl, who finds love in interestig places.
Jim Belushi and Halle Berry once again prove how good they truly are in this wonderful movie (based on a true story). I hope everybody watches this because it is really exceptional.",1066780800,8,1102,4.8

He's actually the best one out of all of them. Even though, Eliza Dushku is my favourite actress, she's only 15 years old here, so she still has a bit of her childhood left. Meaning, a little more whining then she usually does. Casie Affleck, later to become her ... partner in Soul Survivors, also stars in here as her step-brother. And of course, Halle Berry, who is almost always delivering at least a fine performance. This movie was predictable, but it reminded me of the movies I used to watch as a child, but without the cheesy dogs talking and stuff. So, it was a little more realistic. The Sun, is a motorized-vehicle that they built for a science project. Turns out, they race in Hawaii and win so they head off to Australia to compete for the championships. It's a really fun movie and I do plan on buying this if I find it. This movie is one of the best I've ever seen, I love it!! TWO THUMBS UP!!",1044057600,2,1074,4.2439024390243905
