The gorgeous Andrea Roth plays both Kim and Kate ""Domenique"" Jameson, and the duel role showcases this actress' wide range of acting as she alternates between the bookish sister and the glamorous sister in the early part of the movie. The scenes where the twins are together are very well done.

Rick Springfield as Philippe looks older and a little worse for wear when up close, but no woman in her right mind would say he isn't still handsome. He has perfected the soap opera look from his work on General Hospital and he gives a fine performance of a distrustful hero with a painful past. I must admit I have a soft spot for Rick, who comes from my hometown of Sydney. And who can forget his hit song from the 80's, Jessie's Girl?

The first-rate supporting cast includes the beautiful Stephanie Beacham (Dynasty) and classical actor, Ian Richardson, who appeared in a wide variety of films throughout his career. Add to the mix magnificent buildings, grand architecture and stunning art. Music with a trendy background beat gives the movie a liveliness that complements the cosmopolitan storyline. A really enjoyable movie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Society-Seduction-Silhouette-Desire/dp/0373730659/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High-Society Seduction (Silhouette Desire)</a>",1289001600,,1456,5.554054054054054

8018640,5,B0001Z48RU,"This movie really amazed me.  It's a high-end romantic comedy, exquisite and as smooth as silk.  Only by seeing it can you realize the impeccable  photography and casting and direction.  Andrea Roth is simply stunningly beautiful and irresistable.  And Rick Springfield is a talented actor. I wish there were more films with Roth and or Springfield.  The sets are magnificent esp where the models and catwalks are.  To me it looks like a high budget film.  The plot is unique and charming but for me the characters are the best part of this seamless romance.",1187049600,3,558,4.8

8018642,4,B0001Z48RU,"This was a great tv movie.  It made me remember how cute Rick is.  The story revolves around twin girls, who switch places so that one can get over her problem with alcohol.  She is a model, while the didter who takes her place is an art history major.  She has to learn to be a model, and many funny and swwet things happen.  It was very well done for a romance.  I give it a thumbs up!!",1083628800,33,388,3.91025641025641
