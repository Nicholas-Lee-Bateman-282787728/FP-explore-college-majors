8320076,4,B001LX4BU0,"I was pretty impressed with this low budget movie.  Narrated by Bob Sessions in his usual monotone, what you get here is not some splendid CGI or expensive special effects.  Instead, you get to-the-point narrative with the help of four British historians who analyze the Punic Wars and Hannibal's actions.  It was the demise of Carthage, afterall, that gave way to the strength of the Roman Empire.

Carthage needed to be destroyed for two reasons:  to defeat it as a competitor in sea trade, and to prevent the city-state from falling to the Numidian Empire of northern Africa.

If you want high dramatic war footage, look elsewhere as the warriors here act like theatre stage actors waving rubber swords around.  There is no blood (except in a short eye-poking scene involving ""Hannibal""), no screaming except in the background, and no graphic death scenes.

All the acting takes place in the background as Sessions narrates the scenes. The era clothing was pretty accurate except perhaps that the armors depicted here were too shiny (Scipio's armor had nipples on the outside?!) and the red cloaks were perhaps too red.  Although it is mentioned that Hannibal crossed the Alps with 37 elephants, what isn't told is that only one elephant survived the trek,  However, there is enough authenticity to make the 52 minutes of narration worthwhile.

The ageless actor depicting Hannibal, a fair-skinned middle-aged man wearing a full beard streaked with two white strands in the brown beard, was never credited.  I wish I knew who he is.  And seriously, did Hannibal really look so fair-skinned?

There is nothing new revealed in this work.  Everything we know about Hannibal was recorded by the Roman historian Livy, who is quoted in a few scenes with great theatrical drama.  Because of the lack of gore and outright violence, this would be a decent movie to show high school students.",1278115200,8,1885,4.955414012738854
