It is totally extraordinary--highly literate, supberbly acted and truly compassionate.  It is beyond praise.  I watch an episode a day while using my treadmill and am truly saddened to know that one day I shall get to the end.  It should never have been canceled.",1140652800,6,355,4.415384615384616
8084652,5,B000BBOUV8,"The West Wing holds, in my opinion, the title of worlds best drama.  The issues that it focuses on range from religious counterpoints to race views and simple party politics. Characters deal with loss, love, work stress and have a lot of fun doing so.

The writers of the West Wing have done a superb job not only creating very realistic scripts (while possibly being slightly idealistic) but very humorous moments that will stay with you forever.

I am on my 10th time through the series, and I am still finding things that I haven't seen before, while still loving every moment of the rest.

If you've got the money and the time, I highly recomend buying as many seasons of the West Wing as possible! It will be worth it, trust me!",1139270400,6,733,4.488721804511278
