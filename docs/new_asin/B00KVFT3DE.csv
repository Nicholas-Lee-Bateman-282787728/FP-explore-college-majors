6449134,3,B00KVFT3DE,"Watched this on Velocity, the action and speed in this sport is insane. However, I ended up not enjoying it because quickly into it I noticed something. The two commentators would not SHUT UP. I wanted to enjoy the vision and sound of the action but that was rendered impossible because of the CONSTANT (and unimportant) chatter of the irritating announcers.",1406246400,3,358,4.885245901639344

8661841,5,B00KVFT3DE,"Excellent coverage and amazing camera work. You actually get dizzy during parts of the on-board camera shots. Lengthy and complete coverage and I appreciated the narrative for providing useful information. It is helpful to know who is who and what their background history. The scenery was well photographed and there appears to be no expenses spared in the production of this Blu-ray. The quality of this Blu-ray is top notch, sound is excellent and the action breathtaking. Very well done, brilliant!",1428624000,2,502,5.209876543209877

8661844,3,B00KVFT3DE,"I have several of these from the recent past races.  For some reason this year is more talk and not as much action as before.  The bikes really impress and the riders are fearless.  But this time the shots change too quickly and jump around.  And then there is the background talk, talk, talk.  Some color is nice, but this year was way too much.  Still, it is the ultimate street race.",1424736000,,386,4.291666666666667
