8462957,3,B0059GVBD0,"I bought the collection more on the fact of his association with John Ford and his later work. He was also the main acting influence of John Wayne. They are very low budget westerns with for the most part no soundtrack so you hear the bump and scratches  like old 16mm films. But the package was cheap so i did not expect much.

But shoot me , i liked them . This is what my father watched on Saturday matinees when he was a kid . The films are not the quick cut
fast paced movies of today. It seems back then  the films gave you time to reflect on what you saw while you were flinging popcorn at the bad guy or joining the fight with your cap pistol. . All in all i thought it was a good buy. I wish someone would package his early John Ford silent westerns he did at Fox.  Those were much better.",1410480000,5,798,3.96875
