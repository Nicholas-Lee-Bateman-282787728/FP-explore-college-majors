4588632,4,B0056IXS7S,"What I appreciate most about Kristen Wiig's comedy style on SNL is her refusal to pander to an audience. Portraying her gallery of solipsistic eccentrics week after week, she's never afraid to be unsympathetic because she exposes a truth that is smart and funny. Translating her gift to the big screen proves to be surprisingly fortuitous with her breakout 2011 comedy, which has already been dubbed the distaff version of the alpha-male mega-hit, 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B001UV4XEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>. They share an ensemble approach, a sometimes raunchy sense of humor, and the context of an upcoming wedding but little else. What you won't mistake this movie for is one of those dreary rom-coms starring invariably Katherine Heigl, Kate Hudson, or Jennifer Aniston.

Co-written by Wiig and fellow Groundlings alumnus Annie Mumolo and breezily directed by Paul Feig (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office/dp/B002BFBB1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office</a>), this is a sharp, character-driven farce freed from chick-flick predictability and showing the unmistakable fingerprints of co-producer Judd Apatow all over it. The plot centers on thirtysomething Annie Walker who is not in the best place in her life. Deep into debt after losing the cake shop she owned with a boyfriend who subsequently abandoned her, she is already a bit unstrung when her childhood best friend Lillian gets engaged. She names Annie her maid of honor, but there's competition for the coveted role from Lillian's new bestie, the wealthy and pretentious Helen. Much of the storyline focuses on the tension between Annie and Helen over Lillian's preferential attention until the wedding day. Within this context, much of the humor comes from the preposterous excesses that come from the ""wedding industrial complex"" with Helen obviously having the resources to fund them including a ludicrously over-the-top Paris-themed shower.

Along for the ride are the three other bridesmaids - Lillian's cousin Rita, a sex-starved mother of three; Becca, a newlywed who pities Annie for her single state; and Megan, the groom's unfiltered, adventure-seeking sister. Needless to say, things don't go according to plan (the diuretic bridal shop scene is a hoot), and the shenanigans are underlined by the obvious rift occurring between two best friends when one moves on with her life. Beyond her comedy set pieces (e.g., her increasingly hilarious efforts in attempting to get a traffic citation), Wiig turns out to be a resourceful actress as Annie and dials back her trademark neurotic lunacy just enough to make Annie's dilemmas humanly relatable. As Lillian, SNL alumnus Maya Rudolph (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Away-We-Go/dp/B0021L8UOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Away We Go</a>) has less to do but does it with warmth and wit. Rose Byrne, who showed deft comic chops in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Him-to-the-Greek/dp/B003VPX5Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Him to the Greek</a>, captures the haughtiness and insecurity in Helen with lan.

However, stealing scenes with sheer abandon is a makeup-free Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan with such balls-to-the-wall force that it's hard not to respond to her uncompromised honesty. Her character is arguably the most mentally stable of the bunch. Wendy McLendon-Covey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reno-911/dp/B0001XAODE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reno 911</a>) and Ellie Kemper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office/dp/B002N5N5SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office</a>) have their moments as sarcastic Rita and naive Becca, but they aren't given much screen time to flesh out their funnier bits. Jon Hamm (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Men/dp/B0038M2AOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Men</a>) really nails the blistering albeit charming indifference that his character Ted shows toward Annie's romantic longings, while Irish actor Chris O'Dowd proves likeably puppyish as her burgeoning love interest, a traffic cop constantly reprimanding her for not fixing her brake lights. In her final film appearance, the wonderful Jill Clayburgh is sweetly amusing as Annie's whimsically off-kilter mother. It all runs a bit too long at 125 minutes with the resolutions a bit pat, but still, this is one of the funniest movies of the year.",1305504000,4,4620,6.460420032310178
4588633,4,B0056IXS7S,"And so the masses cried out,""Where is the twenty-something gross-out comedy for women?"" and lo, the gods of cinema did smile and outpoured Bridesmaids, the latest effort from producer Judd Apatow, the genius mind behind such films as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up.

The movie centers on Annie (Kristian Wiig, who also wrote the screenplay), whose best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph), is about to get married. Her newest friend (Rose Byrne), a type-A who organizes everyone's parties/lives, appears to be stealing away affection from Annie who starts to go slowly mad. Annie's life hasn't been in the best of shape anyhow since she lost her business, lost all her money, lost her job and her apartment. Having this added stress on top of it doesn't make things easier and though she eventually gets a new boyfriend in the form of an Irish immigrant cop (Chris O'Dowd), her life remains chaotic and unhappy. Mind you, this is a comedy.

And for the most part, it's a very funny! It's rude and crude in parts (particularly in a scene in a bridal shop), but those parts are funny, so I'm fine with that. I will say the movie starts off very strong, sags significantly in the middle (the airplane scene went on way too long), and recovers somewhat in the end. There's still some laughs in the later parts, but the first portion of the movie is where most of the fun is to be had. I will also say that the first part is strong enough to make up for the sagging parts in the middle.

This isn't a perfect movie, but it is fun and it is worth seeing. Hopefully it will be the start of a trend where people write good comedy films about women and their relationships, much as they have with men. This movie stands well on its own, but if it's the start of something bigger, I'll be quite pleased.",1305417600,28,1794,4.513846153846154
4588634,3,B0056IXS7S,"I'm not the biggest Judd Apatow fan, but I do consider his films entertaining. A good majority of the films produced under the Apatow Productions moniker are more than a little amusing, as well. In fact, I'm partial to both Anchorman and Pineapple Express. Despite Apatow's involvement with the film, Bridesmaids didn't really interest me all that much in concept. Another R-rated comedy revolving around a wedding with a mostly female cast? Who cares? The underestimation on my part probably helped the film more than anything as Bridesmaids turned out to be an adult comedy with a little more meat on its bones than the trailers perhaps lead you to believe.

 While the film is both filthy and raunchy at times, the foundation of Bridesmaids lies within the relationship between Annie and Lillian. Their chemistry along with the way they both screw up their lives when they're away from one another is the heart and soul of the film. Lillian's marriage falling apart is kind of a given just with how eccentric each character in the main cast is, but Annie's depression, downward spiral, and inability to drive herself forward rather than continuously pushing herself back is key to giving the film an emotional kick that isn't even hinted at in the trailers. Melissa McCarthy steals nearly every scene that she's in thanks to her outrageous antics and incredibly high self esteem. Nearly every one of the bridesmaids gets a good laugh at some point in the film even if a few of them (Reno! 911's Wendi McLendon-Covey and The Office's Ellie Kemper) don't get as much screen time as others.

Bridesmaids almost felt like it was stronger during its more dramatic and softhearted sequences in comparison to the overall comedic atmosphere of the rest of the film, which is weird since it is absolutely a comedy. While the obscene and sometimes scatological jokes used in the film were mostly original in execution and chuckle-worthy at times, it somehow all just felt very familiar to me. The Brazilian food that gave them all food poisoning felt like it borrowed heavily from Dumb & Dumber, the Wilson Phillips joke was funnier in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, while most of the scenes on the airplane seemed to offer a female version of a scene straight out of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles with more profanity. Then there's the film itself which was like Wedding Crashers if seen through the eyes of the women in the actual wedding. I guess on one hand, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. All of those comedies are rather exceptional while at least two of them would be considered classics, but that sense of familiarity was still there like Dj vu sneaking up behind you and trying to tickle you while spewing a constant string of F-bombs.

Bridesmaids is a dirty, vulgar, over the top comedy that attempts to affect your limits of compassion just as much as the extent of your hilarity. While some of the gross-out humor came off as a little much at times, Kristen Wiig is able to prove just how talented she really is. It is at least able to offer an R-rated comedy that both sexes will enjoy, which is more that can be said for most PG-13 romantic comedies. Bridesmaids is an entertaining stumble into borderline comedic genius that will keep people talking about it long after it's relevant.",1305244800,7,3303,4.779334500875657

4588712,1,B0056IXS7S,"Everyone was surprised I hadn't seen Bridesmaids as a woman who loves female-centered comedy. I hated it. A lot of predictability and I barely laughed. The thing that bothered me the most was Annie's relationship with the cop. Overly simplistic. And he's supposed to be the nice guy, yet he expects her to bake him cakes the morning after she goes home with him. But it's ok supposedly because he's encouraging her to persue the passion she gave up on. Friendship dynamics were also shallow.",1512691200,,491,4.788235294117647

I went to see it with my family, 17 year old at the time, I loved it. It was amazing. Best movie of 2011, in my opinion. Still one of my favorite movies ever. I would say it follows the non-canon storylines of Mean Girls to Bridesmaids to Bad Moms. All hilarious movies focusing on female groups of friends. No, it is not a chick flick. Grow up. Don't even use that term any more. It's 2017. Man or woman, I recommend this movies. It has a little something in it for everyone.",1505952000,,616,4.099173553719008

4588844,5,B0056IXS7S,"Hilarious!  I've already seen this movie, a couple of times, so there was no question about that.  I bought it from Amazon because, duh, they had the best price.  This is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen let alone funniest ""chick flick.""  It IS a chick flick b/c the cast is almost exclusively well, chicks.  If you've ever seen ""The Sweetest Thing"" this is in the same family of ornery chick movies (but not nearly as raunchy as The Sweetest Thing, because you can watch this with even the most um, ""moral"" friend and I think she'll think it's funny, not so with T.S.T.  Oopsie, I didn't know.  Lesson learned!)  Anyway, there are many, many funny scenes, I love when Kristin Wiig's character is trying to get her ex-man's attention by doing ridiculous drive-bys capped off by ever so slowly crashing into his police car!  Super funny!

Melissa McCarthy totally STEALS the movie!  IDK how she can do the scenes without laughing (I know they edit, but have you seen her on SNL, she doesn't crack, even during the funniest stuff). This is a fabulous movie from beginning to end, it never hits a dull spot or lull in the humor.

Vegas for the bridal shower? Really? I don't think the author has ever talked to a real person outside of the fantasy land that was created for this movie. The cake shop that fails because of the recession and the baker goes to work in a jewelry store instead of another bakery?

4589016,5,B0056IXS7S,"Following my engagement, I bought my husband to be a collection of wedding themed movies. In the years we were dating, we went to the movies on an almost weekly basis. Leading up the wedding, movies got pushed aside to save money and save time planning.

Bridesmaids is a lighthearted, sarcastic film about a group of girls working together to plan a friends bridal shower, bachelorette and wedding details. This was a great film to put on to get excited for our own wedding and bachelor/bachelorette festivities. The main character struggles with the extravagant tastes of the maid of honor. This was almost too relateable, as one of our bridesmaids was less than thrilled about the financial commitment of being a bridesmaid. Even still, it is laugh out loud funny. My husband and I can relate to this style of sarcastic humor. It may seem brash, or crude, but you can't please everyone.

4589093,5,B0056IXS7S,"BRIDESMAIDS should be required viewing for bridal parties and book clubs -- and any other group of women, for that matter. Smart, sassy, and seriously funny, it's the female-centric, irreverent buddy comedy we've needed for ages. (Seriously, why did it take so long?) Biting with humor and generous with heart, Bridesmaids reminds us of the value of true, enduring friendships -- and that we have the power to wriggle our way out of the toughest spots if we let others help and, most of all, choose to help ourselves.

Wiig makes an enormously flawed character likable, while Rudolph turns in a grounded, authentic performance. And their chemistry! They share such an easy rapport that it's totally believable that they're friends for life. Big applause to the writers (one of whom was Wiig) and director Paul Feig, as well: While the bachelorette-party-goes-awry subplot is pretty predictable (though it does produce one hilarious airplane scene) and a few of the characterizations are a little one-note (like Annie's boorish sometime-boyfriend, who's played with gleeful abandon by Hamm), Bridesmaids is ultimately a joy to watch.",1470700800,,1132,5.254143646408839

Kristen Wiig is terrible. Hate her. Never saw her before in anything. Won't ever see her again. I'm not even going to see Ghostbusters because she's in it. She's not funny. Not even a little. Just annoying and constantly pulling stupid stunts.
Matt Lucas? What was the point of him being in this? He's good, but no reason to have him or his character in this movie.
Melissa McCarthy is awesome! Watch the trailer for this movie, most of the good bits are in it. And all of the good bits have Melissa McCarthy.
I wish I could get a refund. I should have rented rather than purchased, but it received such good reviews, and looked so funny. The only notable things are this are Melissa McCarthy and it's a comedy with female leads.

Fortunately the bridesmaid gets a grip and pulls herself together towards the end of the movie. Never trade a life long friend for a new one just because she maybe prettier and richer. Freinds are friends and hold on to them as long as you can. That's what this movie is really saying.

It's about a down on her luck woman fighting to be better than a second runner up bridesmaid to a long time friend.  She does all she can to sabotage the runner up and only destroys a wedding in the process.  During this self destruction, she manages to to have a one night stand with a local Sheriff.

The only reason why I am giving it the rating I am is because 2 of the 3 Bridesmaids movies I bought were broken and the clip holding the DVD in place was disintegrated and the DVD was just flopping around the case.
The reason I bought 3 was to give them to my bridesmaids to ask them to be in my wedding line. So they were all the same movie.
And only one of them wasn't broken, I don't think it was because of the way it was shipped because it was in a box with those inflated cushions to keep them from moving around and when I took them out of the box they had the plastic wrap around the actual DVD case and when you moved the case ever so slightly you could hear it moving around. I asked my girls if they were scratched and one of them said it skips in one spot in the movie but other than that it was okay. I hope this is helpful!",1443052800,,856,3.84180790960452

4589618,4,B0056IXS7S,"What's not to like about this distaff-oriented laugh and raunch-fest, brought to us by the reliable Paul Feig? I think this is the film that launched Melissa McCarthy on her current trajectory in film - it would be worth a whole post just to talk about why she is so awesome. McCarthy is the anti-woman: raunchy, opinionated, in your face, beautiful in ways that idealized caricatures of women in American films just don't even touch. But I digress. Kristen Wiig is the main event here, and she is fabulous, in her wilting self-destruction. She seems to specialize in this type of character, as evidenced by the more recent ""Skeleton Twins"" and ""Welcome to Me"". Wiig's bottom-hitting Maid of Honor (who brings to mind Charlize Theron in ""Young Adult"") is expertly reflected and reacted to by the marvelous supporting cast, including the aforementioned McCarthy, an understated but solid Maya Rudolph and indie darling Rose Byrne, playing completely against type as the evil rival for Rudolph's affections. This is a film that takes women seriously, and which is seriously hilarious.",1438560000,7,1082,5.084269662921348

4589671,2,B0056IXS7S,"I wanted more from this movie.  Influenced by the good reviews, I expected more.

Annie Walker/Kristen Wiig is occasionally sympathetic but not likable.  She has faced some disappointments, but instead of trying to make the best of a situation, she constantly sabotages herself.  She wallows in self-pity, is constantly devastated every time something good happens to her dear friend, and she is so self-absorbed, she refuses the good.

Her friend, Lillian Donovan/Maya Rudolph is getting married, and Annie Walker is asked to be a bridesmaid.  Instead of feeling happy for her friend, Annie is upset, because she had recently suffered a series a setbacks, including the loss of her bakery business.

Helen Harris III/Rose Byrne attempts to thwart Annie, and Annie is only too happy to comply.  But you understand Helen is not happy, and there is a reason why she acts the way she does, because she is a really good person.  She could be Annie's friend, if only Annie would let her.

I thought both Wendi McLendon-Covey/Rita and Ellie Kemper/Becca were witty, humorous, and exceptional.  They had great chemistry together, and I hope they appear in film again.

Of course, the standout is Melissa McCarthy/Megan Price.  This was the perfect role for her.  She is oblivious, confident, and hilarious.  Always she is good-hearted and sincere, and I enjoyed every time she is on screen.

I didn't love this film.  There were a lot of faults, and there were a lot of bad scenes.  But there were a lot of good scenes as well.  I don't understand the enthusiasm but maybe it was due to my anticipation being too great.",1436572800,,1612,4.881918819188192

Melissa McCarthy and Rebel Wilson steal every scene that they are in.

I kept hoping Prime would allow me to view it as a free streaming choice, but that didn't happen. I suppose the studio would not allow it. I don't think it is truly up to Amazon to determine which are free and which have a rental or purchase cost.

If you know of someone getting married soon, or someone recently married and you want a stay at home entertainment - or even a girl's night with popcorn - this will give you lots of laughs - not a tissue box kind of movie.

I play these two scenes over and over again and practically pee my pants laughing each time!!!! When Wiig is given a couple of sedatives and then drinks scotch on the plane to calm her nerves, she looks out the window and thinks she sees a colonial woman out on the wing churning butter!!  Who came up with that simpleness?!!! and then she's chased up & down the aisle and then tackled by Melissa McCarthy aiding air marshall Jon!
There are some sad/lonely scenes in this movie for Kristen Wiig and she plays those amazingly well...the expressions on her face alone really touched me.  Leads me to say, I'd love to see her in a very dramatic part. I think she would knock something like that out-of-the-park.

I'm a huge mess of a human being but even I was shaking my head like, ""get it together"". It wasn't believable. The plane scenes were my favorite though. I'm a bad flyer too so it was funny to me.

Rose Byrne, Melissa Mccarthy, and Chris O'Dowd stole the movie from the rest of the cast. By the middle of the movie I was just watching it to see what happened to them. But the ending finale with a certain band was 100% worth the cost of the rental. So funny and I like movies that end on a high note.

At the risk of betraying my penchant for finding the little known gems of the year, I did not even have to wrestle too long to realize there is no other film this year that I laughed at as much and had the immediate desire to see with all my friends over and over again.  It is the best comedy released since Old School, legitimately establishes Kristen Wiig as a star (not to mention Melissa McCarthy) and your sides will ache from laughter while you may just tear up in a place or two.

What I did not expect was an underlying story of an ""every girl"" hitting rock bottom in her life.  Kristen Wiig's character deals with the sense of panic and self loathing one feels as they watch their childhood friends excel in both their careers and personal life, while simultaneously dealing with their own shortcomings in both areas.  In my case, it cut very close to home, and there are several parts of the movie you spend movie in tears.  With that said, there were plenty of uplifting moments and laughs to pull you out of the sad points in the movie.  The ending is a little cliched, and the overall plot is very predictable.  Yet, there is enough heart and comedy to make this a really satisfying movie.",1426032000,9,844,4.662162162162162

It has funny moments with the maids and the bride to be going through some hysterical moments. The comic lines are funny for the most part and Kristen Wiig gives a funny performance as the maid.

This movie is at times compared to being the women's version of the Hangover. Hmm.. I don't think so. It stands as it's own unique comedy. It's not for everyone but if you enjoyed the 40 Year Old Virgin or the first Hangover movies then this movie is definitely watchable.

4590148,1,B0056IXS7S,Terrible and low brow humor. Stupid and not even remotely funny. I can see why it had such mass appeal but it you actually have more than 10 brain cells you will find nothing at all appealing about this video. The acting is poor from everyone involved and I am sure it was shot over the weekend. Clearly the script was pulled out of some dumpster as a reject before heading to the recycling plant. I just can not say enough about how poor every aspect of this terrible film were.  Avoid it.,1419897600,,490,4.268817204301075
4590149,1,B0056IXS7S,"After hearing a lot of positive review about Bridesmaides I figured I'd give it a chance. I was extremely disappointed. The movie was just all over the place. She's dating a jerk, her business failed, bad roommates... I get it she's reached rock bottom. Then her friend gets engaged, and the battle starts with a new pseudo girl friend fighting to become the maid of honor. From there the movie just has no real focus and bounces between to many situations. By the end you think she's going to start baking again, but no... She just randomly makes up with the bride and her prince waits for her after the wedding...that was planned by the pseudo best friend. I just don't get it...",1419811200,4,681,4.544715447154472

This film, from the producer of celluloid triumphs such as ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up"", is a teenage crowd-pleaser. It is a female center story line that moves slowly, takes disjointed, raunchy, missteps to an bland ending. It begins with an unpleasant humping sequence and moves on mid-film to a revolting barfing and bowl movement expose. I watched most of the film, my wife watch had more stamina. Her view: It's a boring waste of time. Side note: We both enjoyed ""National Lampoon's Animal House"".",1419811200,,629,5.0

Also, I think it's nice to see a movie that doesn't make all men into jack-asses. There is a nice balance between good people and bad people and just plain old weird people. I have seen the movie twice now. The first time was making me squeak while laughing while trying not to wake anyone.

With the exception of a couple of scenes the only thing I positive I took away from this movie was discovering Chris O'Dowd, one of two characters I even liked and the ONLY character that I didn't find absolutely grating by the end of the movie.  Melissa McCarthy's character was the other character I enjoyed but her schtick lasted just long enough to get annoying in almost every scene she was in, the director needs to learn that sometimes less is more.

4590431,4,B0056IXS7S,"I've heard such varying reviews of this movie from hilariously funny to ""don't bother.""  I put off watching it until someone else recommended it.  I have to admit that the first part of the movie with the bedroom scene with the loser boyfriend really put me off, but I persevered and was glad I did!

Annie, played by the delightful Kristen Wiig has had her share of bad luck and wears it on her sleeve.  She's lost her bakery business, she's rooming with a Brit guy and his sister who are beyond weird, she's in a ""relationship"" with a hot looking guy who is not that into her,  and she now has a job in a jewelry store courtesy of her mom.  The bright spot in her life is her best friend from childhood, Lillian, who announces her engagement and wants Annie as her maid of honor.  And this is where the misadventure starts!

This movie I liked because it's a total spoof on the whole wedding industry.  And in this case, it clearly goes over the top because another woman in the wedding party(wife of the fianc's boss) decides that she is now the best friend of Lillian and is going to give her a wedding to remember.  The competition is on between Annie and Lillian's new friend.

What happens is a series of disasters that only happen in a movie.  A bad reaction to Brazilian food results in embarrasing moments at a bridal salon,  a Las Vegas trip interrupted by security issues,  a bridal shower of Hollywood dimensions, and all of them involve Annie.  Another bright spot though, is being stopped by a not so bad looking cop, played by Chris O'Dowd.  This starts to be promising, but Annie is still having issues.  The most important being that Lillian is upset with her, and she feels a loss.

Friendship is the biggest theme of this film.  Keeping long time relationships intact.  Trying to understand those that need friends and try too  hard to please them.  Or ignoring those that want a friendship and actually can be more therapeutic in hours of need.

Melissa McCarthy really stole the show as a bridesmaid, sister of the groom. There are so many laugh out loud moments that involve her--starting with the fitting session and then on the plane, as well as adopting all the ""shower favors.""  I've enjoyed seeing her in movies and I'm going to have to watch more of them.  She is funny and also brings reality to the story.  It was great to see Jill Clayburgh again, and she played Annie's mother very well.  This is a light movie that entertains but there really are good lessons to be learned.",1409270400,2,2508,4.491150442477876

4590449,4,B0056IXS7S,"I read a review that started out Bridesmaids *is+ an unexpectedly funny new comedy.
Unexpected? Are you kidding me? Did this reviewer check out any of the numerous trailers?
How could you watch one and not be laughing out loud. The trailer for Bridesmaids made me
want to see this movie immediately if not sooner and, so it would seem, did a number of other
people. My sister and I went to a Saturday afternoon show thinking we would have the place
to ourselves and unexpectedly the place was packed. Obviously, the general public is better
able to recognize funny when they see it then the aforementioned reviewer.
I expected this movie to be essentially Hangover with a female cast, raunchy and a bit over
the top. In fact a better comparison would be 40 Year Old Virgin. It was funny but had
genuine moments of caring and compassion. Relationships were explored. Insecurities were
exposed. A person comes of age. There are explosions, some, temperamental, some, - well,
lets just say, some are more earthy (this is a family friendly weekly). So yes, it can be a bit on
the disgusting side, but when you were in your teens and twenties these things made you
laugh. Try to find that inner youth in yourself and laugh along with the rest of the audience,
who were howling at six women dealing with food poisoning.
The movie stars Kristen Wiig who along with Annie Mumolo wrote the screenplay. You know
Kristen Wiig from SNL and both she and Mumolo were with the comedy troupe Groundlings.
Like Second City, Groundlings is about improvisation. As I was watching the movie I wished I
had a script in hand, because I knew that with these two actresses, as well as Maya Rudolph
and Ellie Kemper, a lot of improve was going on. Im thinking they probably have a whole other
movie consisting of out-takes.
These women are great, but the scene stealer is Melissa McCarthy (Gilmore Girls, Samantha
Who, Mike and Molly). I put those references in because I don't think you are going to
recognize her. She plays every moment completely straight no matter how ridiculous which
makes her the funniest. Go see the movie if only to hear her initial introduction of herself to
Wiig.
Final words: Guys, you're gonna love it too. Go.",1408406400,,2215,4.667519181585678

It starts off pretty funny, but it quickly turns into an Adam Sandleresque depiction of self loathing and personal issues. There are very limited hijinx and well-constructed situations. In fact, the ""Brides Maids"" actually spend very little time together. This is not a gal pal comedy, as it is billed. A lot of the movie focuses on Kristen Wiig dealing with her personal issues and unfulfilling live with a seemingly pointless focus on her failed bakery, which she was running with her ""boyfriend"" and romance with a local law enforcement officer.

4590584,5,B0056IXS7S,"Here's the thing: I love chick flicks. Steel Magnolias, The Wedding Date, Sleepless in Seattle, all classics in my personal library. Bridesmaids has taken it's own place right alongside these stereotypical chick flicks because of the ridiculous element of reality. BFFs forever having to navigate the different paths down which each of us have to travel; the failure of a dream business; the tendency to screw up the one good thing we've got going; the bizarre sister-in-law. Kristen Wiig is at her finest, but Melissa McCarthy steals the show. The best thing about Bridesmaids, besides the fact that you can recommend it to male friends and they'll love it, too, is that the comedy isn't slapstick and improbable, it's wonderfully possible. You can see it all happening to you and your friends. Plus it's interwoven with equally true-to-life relationships, interactions and scenarios. I already have Bridesmaids on DVD for myself.

I might have been able to look past the lack of comedy if the actresses were all good looking, but they weren't. I get that having a lot of supermodels to fill the roles would not have had the same effect, but it would have at least given me a reason to keep watching.

I personally don't recommend this movie for men. The humor was very scarce and seemed forced. I could predict almost everything that happened in the movie, which prevented it from being funny.",1401494400,,610,4.169491525423729

The main character is a complete loser, extremely immature, and whines throughout the film as if the world owes her something.  She's the least funny of them all but...  the rest of them are duds too.  There's a phony rich chick, a fat chick, an aging slutty chick...  you name an undesirable stereotype of a female, and this film features it prominently.

4590611,4,B0056IXS7S,Well the film critics were correct - this is a film that is extraordinarily in its depiction of all types of women.  And so very nice to see women competing for affection of a female friend.  There was barely a man involved in their relationships with one another - so refreshingly real!  Melissa McCarthy was barely recognizable and brilliant. Many scenes were outright hilarious and others were so authentic that you thought it was your life on screen.  Well worth watching.,1400803200,,476,4.839506172839506

Brides Maids is a very raunchy movie, this isn't one you're going to want to sit down and watch with your parents.  It contains some of the classic ""chick-flick"" themes as well, and the general pacing of the ""acts"" of the movie are very standard.  The really crazy moments are what make this film however, and you'll find yourself laughing uproariously at some of the wackier moments.

And I think Jack Black was hysterical in Orange County.

If you have any sense, or a heart, or decent politics, or whatever, read the negative reviews first. I am adding this review just to increase the one-star numbers, in hopes that someone like me will notice them, and be warned. I still have flashbacks to the disgusting diarrhea scene.

I like Kristen Wiig, laugh my way through most SNL skits, and enjoyed the trailer but this movie is awful.  Every attempt at humor is more depressing than funny and you can see any 'twists' coming a mile away.  I felt sorry for Kristen Wiig as the Director didn't allow her to do anything new or creative.

I love comedies and even dumb comedy but women with the same old jokes, feminism,  whining, crying...well it didn't really interest me. So, I'm talking to my friend and she references a scene in the movie - I'm fluent in movie so imagine her surprise when I had no idea what she was talking about.  My friend proceeds to demand that I watch Bridesmaids that night - her words ""its the funniest movie ever.""  Now, I'm a skeptical of peoples movies reviews because many of my girlfriends declared Knocked Up (Written/Produced by J. Apatow) by to be a hugely funny film which I found to be an outright lie. In fact, I would rather cut myself then see Katherine Heigl in anything ever again.  YAWN...but I regress...back to Bridesmaids. My original idea of the film content was wrong. There was plenty of female neurosis but it was done well :-)

Bridesmaids is in fact...VERY FUNNY.  I liked it a lot. Some of the scenes were so funny my husband insisted on rewinding in order to watch the scene again. All the ladies did a great job but Melissa McCarthy was kick my butt funny as the raunchy and rather unfeminine future sister-in-law. What great comedic timing!

All women stars, ( except two few men, one shallow, the other a keeper), telling the tale of  the struggles women go through as friends, dealing with bridal showers, dress fittings, etc, made for a great female friend movie.

The movie is a bit predictable in some parts, but the exceptional acting carried things through. Some compare to the movie Hangover, which I have not seen, so I can't comment on that.

I had not seen much of Kristen Wiig before this movie, but she is extremely captivating to watch. She has great comedic  timing and is very versatile in this role. Her character, Annie, goes through depression, then happiness, then deep anger, then depression, happiness again. Her struggles with her friendship with Lillian is something many women have gone through in their own lives. Annie already feels terrible and like a failure about the direction her life is headed, then her long term friendship with Lillian is tested by a new wanna be friend who is vain and insincere. The best part of the movie is that Wiig's character is honestly and palpably struggling with all aspects of her life, but she still manages to keep moving forward, by behaving honestly (and hilariously), and keeps her faith in trusting her instincts about Lillian's new wanna be friend and her own failures in life.

Melissa McCarthy is amazing, as usual. She is a great comedienne and I will watch ANY movie she is in. The scene at the bridal salon is by far the best scene of the movie, she steals this scene 100%. The scene is a bit gross, but it made it all the more real life. As always, Melissa acts inappropriate at times, but always hilariously.

If you want to view a movie that will make you laugh, gross you out at times, make you  feel nostalgic and feel  just plain silly, watch this movie!!",1392422400,,1888,4.611940298507463

I felt nothing for the character Kristen Wiig plays except that the screenplay had to have been beyond dreadful.

4590807,5,B0056IXS7S,"It took me a while to see this movie, only because I did NOT want to be stuck watching another comedy movie like the Adam Sandler ones (poop and fart jokes galore) or a crude one like Hangover(s) that focused on cheap laughs and things just to gross the audience out. And with Saturday Night Live crew members in this one, I couldn't be sure...but one day I was bored, saw this in Redbox and tried it out.

Man was I surprised. As one viewer said, this was definitely written by a woman and showed both the most negative aspects of women (catty passive-aggressive mean behavior - Helen) and the most positive (the powerful love and devotion between two female friends), which is why I love this movie No generic female roles in this one, thank GOD. Every character is deep and 3-dimensional, strong in thier own way but also flawed, not perfect - as we all are.

But even though this movie is from a women's perspective (in my opinion), ANYONE that watches will laugh like crazy at this one, both my boyfriend and I laughed our @sses off when we watched it together.

Melissa McCarthy is wonderful, Kristen Wigg is hillarious (the airplane scene, omg), and even the cop is endearing and adorable.

My second was in sitting through it, hoping for some speck of decency, a reflection of older days.  I just can't believe that our country has come to this and that this is the accepted normal behavior of woman in the new millennium.

I have watched this movie about 5 times, and could watch it again and again.  Watching a movie more than once is my yardstick for how much I love it.  I also fell in love with Chris O'Dowd, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, ""Megan"" (her real name escapes me now, and I don't want to look it up), and all the other bridesmaids.  Wiig just nails all the emotions, letting them flit across her face and body -- emotions that most women don't want to admit exist, such as jealousy, envy, insecurity, etc., and even her behavior when drunk/drugged on the airplane.  Not a pretty sight, but of course, all of this is so funny in this movie!  My favorite scenes are the ""low-riding"", the ""Stove"" parts, and natch, the wedding-fitting fiasco.

4590923,5,B0056IXS7S,Saw this in the theater and figured it would be good to keep on hand when I want a great laugh. It was delivered quickly.,1386633600,,121,3.88
4590924,2,B0056IXS7S,"I was expecting more.  When they were promoting this movie, they showed a good portion of the actual movie. I had already seen the best parts.  There wasn't much left!  I was disappointed.",1386633600,,188,4.636363636363637
4590925,3,B0056IXS7S,"I saw this because of the comparisons made to The Hangover, and how it was better. That's giving it little to surpass in my book, but I will give it that much. But it was still like watching a typical Saturday Night Live character for more than a typical skit length, which alone can be uncomfortable in watching and getting past the typical delivery, which Kristin Wig's got down to a science. There's the now expected ""gut busting"" scenes that are now so wide reaching in their urge to be raunchy that they're cliched and unfunny, such as the bridal gown fitting scene. That's pretty par for the course of a SNL product's desperate need to reach for its chuckles. Melissa McCarthy is the obligatory misfit which evoked not nare a chuckle from me, as I can see she was designed to. And the mix of varying characters for clashing personality works as it's done pretty much the other million times I've seen it. Only here, at a much more drawn out SNL skit pace that wore itself out the first 15 minutes. However, where I don't find Wig as funny as others seem to, she did evoke a certain heart throughout the movie that keeps it above water enough to separate if from some of its contemporaries. These movies will always have an audience. They're packaged visually and audibly in the manner that is standard quality for flicks of this genre. And many will also go see it because of SNL brand loyalty, or following the actors involved, or obligatory need to see the current hottest flicks. And the box office on that basis will show it's a successful movie. Me, I'm glad I'm no longer dating a girl where I'd have to see crap like this to prove how much I cared. And it took me almost of year of having it DVRd before I was able to finally sit through it all. Kristin Wig is too SNL assembly line for my taste-her pace, inflections delivery, etc.  But hey, I made the effort to watch it on my own to prove I'm not averse to contemporary comedies, much less movies in general. But I'm starting to think there may just be a hint of truth to that. So few movies engage me lately, But every now and again, I find one worthy of my time. This one wasn't it.",1386460800,,2150,4.361596009975062

4590928,3,B0056IXS7S,"If you market a movie as a raunchy, feel-good party time of laughter and hijinks, it ought to deliver that. This is not that movie. In reality, it's a story about recovering from loss and low self-esteem. It's a story about facades and pretense and envy and self-acceptance. Which is fine. But it ploughed that middle of the road rom-com trajectory. Funny, but not too funny. Serious, but not too deep. Heartwarming, but not too sentimental. Unfortunately, that old formula ends up being very mediocre and tepid. It is certainly a film with a message, which is kind of easy and tidy but not interesting, ultimately.",1386201600,,615,4.811320754716981
4590929,5,B0056IXS7S,Absolutely love this movie. It's not a chik-flick whatsoever. Kristen Wiig along with a top notch cast make a hilarious movie for ages 16 plus.,1386201600,,143,4.76

4590931,4,B0056IXS7S,"The trailers are misleading. This movie is about watching an adult woman fail spectacularly at life. I was expecting a lame gal-pal comedy, but this movie made me cry a lot. I really identified with Annie feeling ""behind"" at life, with her lousy job, dumb roommates, and jerky friend-with-benefits. Then she feels even worse when she loses those things due to her own behavior. The wedding thing was only a side plot. I would definitely recommend it.",1385769600,,450,4.857142857142857

4590937,5,B0056IXS7S,This was so stupid hilarious.  I was amazed at every scene and the crass-ness of it.  But I also laughed a lot.,1384992000,,111,4.0
4590938,5,B0056IXS7S,Hilarious movie!!  It is definitely not for anyone under the age of 18.  This is a funny movie that depicts humor related to getting married.  Over the top at times but well worth the buy.,1384905600,,188,4.314285714285714

The cast was brilliant in compatibility, timing, delivery of their lines, and well developed believable characters. I was in tears from the very beginning to the end. Where is the actress who portrayed the maid of honor?
I haven't seen her we since, and this clearly should have propelled her to comedic superstardom, as it did the actress who portrayed the sister of the groom ( brilliant funny woman) however, as I think about it, the DIALOGE was  truly the star! Amazing!",1384905600,,564,4.755102040816326

4590942,2,B0056IXS7S,Crude.  It was funny and touching and heartfelt and raucous but there was no need for just plain crudeness.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone because any redeeming humor and plot is cancelled by crudeness.,1384819200,,215,4.783783783783784

4590945,4,B0056IXS7S,"This is a fun, sometimes corny (in a good way) light comedy about and for women--one that many men ultimately won't mind too much if the woman in their life insisted that they watch this with them.  As for the infamous food-poisoning scene, I found it neither offensive nor funny--just way too dumb. Most of us grow out of poop humor.  And realistically, regarding women, the downward spiral of the main character would have probably done in the best of friendships.  Honestly, this is not a sophisticated story, but it's often endearing, has many laughs and many will enjoy it.",1384560000,,578,4.76

4590962,3,B0056IXS7S,"This movie was semi-funny....hence the 3 stars.  HOWEVER....I feel so much of this movie was way too ""over-the-top""...like the writers just wanted to shock and gross out, as opposed to crafting a more sophisticated in-depth comedy about two friends.  Wait a minute, that's it...that's what's been bothering me about this movie...it's not at all SOPHISTICATED!  It's more like a gross-out movie for men - geared for women.

I wanted to like Bridesmaids.  After all, it's a chick-flick and I am a chick.  In the movie, Kristen Wiig is best friends with the bride-to-be, and is chosen to be the maid of honor at her wedding.  Enter Helen, a woman who is also friends with the bride-to-be....a smug superior ""perfect"" women who is going to wreak havoc on Kristen Wiig's already beaten down character's life.  Helen is there to take over all the bridesmaid ""duties.""  She is also there to take over the duty of ""best friend"" to the bride.

Before long, the bride-to-be (played by Maya Rudolph) is bonding with Helen ten times more than she is bonding with Kristen Wiig's character.

So sets up a huge female rivalry...the basis for the movie.

There are also other colorful characters, such as the pack of bridesmaids......all very different from each other....one is quite nave, another is very manly, and still another is sick and tired of her kids and ready to have some ........in her face at a bachelorette party in Vegas (fill in the blank)!

Okay, Kristen Wiigs character:  She's insecure, in a nutshell...still reeling after the failure of her bakery (Cake Baby)....and in a bad relationship with a jerk who is only using her.

Now let's talk about the actress Kristen Wiig...she is very funny.  She can take a scene and play it out in such a way that it leaves you in hysterics.  She's quirky and likable....not the usual leading lady these days...not trashy or clich.  She is unique, which is definitely a plus for this movie.

I liked the first half of this movie way better than the second half.  After a while, the movie did seem to drag on a bit.  WARNING:  without giving anything away, there is a really, REALLY gross scene in this movie....my husband liked it.  In fact, he was annoyed about being forced to watch a ""chick flick""...then ended up enjoying the movie more than me!

So what's my final word on Bridesmaids?  I'm still not sure!  On the plus side, there are definitely funny parts to this movie....there is also some character development and actual real emotion tossed in here and there...the cop is cute (thought I'd add that!)....on the minus side, though, I think they were going too much for ""over-the top"" shock value at points instead of developing the characters more and creating funny dialogue.

But....if you just want to be entertained and not have to use your brain for awhile...go for it!  Bridesmaids is perfect to just pop in and veg out to...just don't expect to laugh and feel the emotions like you did in Bridgette Jones Diary...or even He's Not that Into You.  They do try to manipulate you into ""feeling emotion"" at the end of the movie, but it seems a bit forced and fake to me at that point.

However, I am rambling.  Just watch the movie...be entertained....and include your husband or boyfriend.  He may enjoy it more than you!",1383436800,11,3276,4.743362831858407
4590963,4,B0056IXS7S,Very funny.  The type of irreverent humor usually associated men/boys but successfully used by this all female cast.  Not the fluff chick flick that I thought it would be when my wife suggested it.  Will def watch it again.  Two thumbs up.,1383264000,,239,4.619047619047619

It is a great chick flick if you just want a fun night at home with the girls!  The uncensored version just has bad words, nothing too bad that I wouldn't let my 13 year old daughter watch.  I ordered the DVD so I can watch it when I want and see the movie as it was originally made, with no commercials.  It is rare for me to watch an entire movie but I watch this movie all the time.

Experience with representative was great.

Unfortunately it was too late to watch the entire thing so we had to wait until the next night.  Watched the movie, but it froze again with only 10 minutes to go.  Again, had to get on Amazon chat and get them to download another copy.  Who doesn't want to see how a movie ends after they've waited for the download twice and then watched it for almost 2 hours?

4591037,5,B0056IXS7S,This has become my go-to movie when I want to laugh. Kristin Wiig manages to carry her character's sadness in her body & face in a way I rarely see--in addition to being really funny other times. Chris O'Dowd is absolutely charming and lovable; Melissa McCarthy is gross and hysterical; and John Hamm is so funny in his selfishness. The scenes in the bridal dress shop and on the plane are so funny I think about them often. This movie is a must for anyone who wants to see a funny movie that actually has round characters and a very human story underneath.,1379462400,,557,4.41747572815534

I'm sure there is a new audience every day that needs to hear the messages but I am of an age where where I've heard them all before and in so similar a fashion that much of the movie seemed to be rehashing the same old themes.,1379030400,,346,4.17910447761194

4591082,1,B0056IXS7S,I have a wonderful Sony BlueRay player that I can stream video from.  I rented the HD version of this and it looked like an old 1960's film - it was awful.  I have rented from many other streaming video companies and never had this problem.  Don't waste your money getting the HD version from Amazon!!,1378166400,,301,4.339285714285714
4591083,2,B0056IXS7S,"Very tired story line. The acting was what you would expect from a Saturday Night Live Cast.  Repetitive junk humor that wouldn't conjure a laugh from a village idiot.  Most of the film didn't even make sense, the lead charcter has this ""shoot me in the head"" love life which she presumably hates, yet when the right guy comes along she rebuffs him.  Really!  That's what you would do, you're so messed up you would rather take abuse rather than find true love?  I don't think so and the sub stories, gosh they were so awful I wanted to poke my eyes out, not really but you get my point.  If you haven't seen the movie, DON'T, if you've seen it and you liked it, seek help or better yet rent some real movies that have good actors, great story lines and a director that has a sense of direction.",1378166400,,795,4.266666666666667
4591084,2,B0056IXS7S,"Even though Mellissa McCarthy is funny in other movies i.e. The Heat, I did not find her 'steeling the show' as reported by others. I found the main characters life sad and desperate to be the best Bridesmaid to her childhood friend who, by the way, is shallow besides.",1378166400,,269,4.510204081632653
4591085,2,B0056IXS7S,"Couldn't stand the language and the way it was used.  The actresses were good, but the way situations were handled was obtrusive.",1378166400,,129,4.863636363636363

4591087,5,B0056IXS7S,Very funny girl humor.  Every character in the movie is someone most women have known personally.  Kristen Wiig is hilarious and Maya Rudolf and Melissa McCarthy crack me up.,1378166400,,174,4.9655172413793105
4591088,4,B0056IXS7S,"Hilarious...great acting and great writers. Was one of the funniest movies we've seen all year, if not the funniest.  It works because we all know people just like this in real life!",1378166400,,182,4.6875
4591089,5,B0056IXS7S,This movie came to my attention when my daughter was getting married. She also played this at the brides maids party two years ago. I saw it last year and I think I peed in my pants the first time. Enough said.,1377993600,,210,4.023809523809524
4591090,5,B0056IXS7S,"Perfect movie if you want to laugh and feel good. Kristen Wig is hysterical. She's so beautiful, but still pulls off playing the underdog that need a little help from her friends to pull herself together.",1377993600,,204,4.694444444444445
4591091,1,B0056IXS7S,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Kristin Wiig stars as a terrible person that no one could possibly have sympathy for. Meanwhile, all the other characters try really hard to out-bizarre each other, which comes off like your six-year-old brother trying to get attention when company is over rather than anything remotely resembling entertainment. Comedy is obviously dead.",1377907200,,380,5.245901639344262

4591094,3,B0056IXS7S,Viewing this film the 2nd time around was a good experience. I wanted to watch the performance of Melissa McCarthy and she was just outstanding in the supporting role. Melissa McCarthy is quite versatile and has great comic presence and timing.,1377820800,,244,4.975609756097561
4591095,5,B0056IXS7S,"This movie is THE BEST.  It does get a little chick flick sappy but they bring it in with more inappropriate and hilarious scenes.  After you watch this movie, you will begin to speak in Bridesmaids quotes.",1377820800,,206,4.54054054054054
4591096,5,B0056IXS7S,I supppose the best way I can explain it is that it is the equivalent for females to the Hangover for males. It's heartbreakingly honest for some women and just plain clever and funny in general. Every guy I know that has seen it loved it too. It's not what you think... :0),1377820800,,274,4.188679245283019

4591102,3,B0056IXS7S,"I'm not crazy about it, but Bridesmaids is entertaining. I'm not into movies about weddings or similar topics, but I understand people can enjoy this movie because it has funny moments and the acting is good overall. The gross ""funny"" part and the exaggerated breakdown are a little bit too much for me, but overall, it's enjoyable. I give it a 3 or 3.5 stars out of 5.",1377561600,,369,4.4411764705882355

However, I love this movie so much that I felt I needed to own it so I can have it ready whenever I need a pick-me-up. This Blu-ray combo is GREAT! I wasn't expecting all of the bonus features (extended scenes, deleted scenes, alternate scenes galore!), there's so much more hilarity to be seen! GET IT.",1377475200,,418,4.371794871794871
4591108,2,B0056IXS7S,I really thought this would be a lot funnier. Didn't even finish watching it. The humor was too crude and just missed the mark.,1377475200,,127,4.333333333333333

4591112,1,B0056IXS7S,It took all kinds of things just to rent the movie and then when you finally got there the movie took a long time to play. About 3/4 of the way through the movie it stopped working and even though my rental lasted for 24 hours I couldn't access it or get it to play after it stopped working. It was very frustrating. All I wanted to do was watch my movie.,1377129600,,355,3.9444444444444446

4591121,3,B0056IXS7S,Chick flik at best. Stupid comedy except for scene when they went to get their dresses. They all got food poisoning and that was the only part I actually laughed.,1376870400,,162,4.433333333333334

4591127,5,B0056IXS7S,This was a fabulous and hysterical movie. At one point we had to pause it since we were literally crumpled on the floor in hysterics. Classic comedy.,1376784000,,149,4.555555555555555

4591131,4,B0056IXS7S,"I enjoyed Annie's breakdown and the tension between Annie and Helen. Characters' development is great too! Each woman is memorable by herself. The jokes worked well, although some of them are too much for my taste. Nevertheless, they came naturally.",1376697600,,249,5.25

4591134,5,B0056IXS7S,This movie is full of nothing but pure laughter from the beginning of the movie to the end of the movie. I can honestly say I have never laughed so hard watching a movie before in my life. I am not kidding when I tell you I was in tears laughing so hard. This is adult humor though I wouldn't suggest your children watching it but as an adult I really enjoyed it.,1376697600,,363,3.9863013698630136

The other people who give it lower than a 4 are too conservative and should just be watching documentaries that contain no curse words and involve fluffy bunnies, meadows, pretty flowers and butterflies with some classical music.

Will be watching this as relief from reviewing  for my boards!!",1376352000,,519,4.431578947368421

4591156,3,B0056IXS7S,"I LOVED the first 2/3 of the film.  The viewer feels an identification with the hapless, yet good-hearted Annie.  It's extremely funny while maintaining the good vibe.

The last third of the film is not so funny.  Annie, instead of being someone I felt like rooting for, shows herself to be more cruel and boorish that those who she feels tormented by (Helen and Ted).  She degrades a teen girl who comes to buy jewelry at her store, calling the girl a c*nt.  She destroys an important event for her best friend, while being self-righteous about it.  Is this the same woman we met in the first 2/3 of the film?  It is like she had a head transplant. I hate when writers do that.  It is lazy writing.  The film could have been just as funny if they had kept her in character.",1376179200,,774,4.3125

It was one of those movies I could not wait for it to end and found myself fast forwarding towards the end so i can hurry up and finish it. i felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this. I had heard good things about this movie and I can not understand why.  No I don't recommend this movie. Distasteful and vulgar.

I thought it was desperate and sad. I caught the first entrance of Melissa McCarthy then quit watching.

 I didn't pay that much, but wish I could get a refund.

I don't have an patience for the type of female character this movie centers around. I can't speak for every over 60 woman, but we've usually seen too much to enjoy these co-dependent, needy, shallow, door mat characters.

With the cast, you'd think it would be two hours of funny skits brimming with womanly humor. Not so much. Kristen Wiig is one of my favorite snl ladies ever, and while I loved watching her on the big screen, I was severely taken back by the central focus on her character's life story instead of a focus on, crazy me, a wedding. Maybe I went into it unrealistically, expecting something more akin to the female version of the hangover.
Don't get me wrong, there are some great moments. I've never witnessed women vomiting all over a bridal shop, nor a bride crapping herself in a street. The love story that ends up stealing the show is adorably cute. I got a great kick out of the jewelry job, considering I was in jewelry for many years. I just feel that if you're going to title a movie Bridesmaids, have it be about being a bridesmaid. Or something akin to it.

4591228,4,B0056IXS7S,"I purchased Bridesmaids (Blu-ray) after hearing the movie's positive response and 2 Oscar Nominations. The premise and movie title sound silly but the film really is well crafted and at times extremely funny. As someone who hates cheap chick flicks, such as 27 Dresses and He's Just Not That Into You, this was a nice little treat. But as a warning, it does fall under some stereotypical chick flick factors. I would really only recommend this movie and review to women or men who have any somewhat enjoyment in romance and chick flick type movies. Because if you do not - this movie is not for you!

Bridesmaids is about Annie Walker and Lillian Donovan. They are absolutely best friends and when Lillian gets married, Annie is obviously going to be maid of honor. But here is some background on Annie. Her life pretty much blows chunks. She has a self absorbed boyfriend that uses her for sex, her apartment sibling roommates are obnoxious, and her baking career was an absolute failure. Now back to the story. Annie eventually meets the other bridesmaids who will be in the wedding! This consists of cousin Rita, friend Becca, sister-in-law Megan (nominated for an academy award for best actress), and Helen. Wondering why I did not describe Helen? Well she is one of those girls we all hate to be jealous of. She is Lillian's soon to be husband's boss's wife. She is beautiful, knows how to take charge, and most importantly... comes off as she is trying to steal Annie away from Lillian. Throughout the movie the girls make wedding plans and disasters and drama unfolds! Will Annie, Helen, and Lillian be able to solve their jealous girl problems? Will Annie ever restore her career and find the man of her dreams? It is all pretty obvious but unlike most chick flicks, it is actually funny and entertaining to see it all play out. They go through ridiculous events of finding the perfect wedding dress with stomach illness, the over the top glamourous bridal shower which included getting your own puppy as a party favor, and the sort of bachelorette party. The audience will be gasping at the crazy things these grown women will do!

The most enjoyable character in this movie was Megan played by Melissa McCarthy. She is absolutely hilarious in everything she says and does. Not to mention, she gives a surprisingly heartfelt pep talk to Annie late in the movie! I feel that all of the other bridesmaids were enjoyable but overshadowed by Megan's brilliance. We need more strong and unconventionally beautiful actresses like her in the world we live in. On a strange note, there are a lot of over the top scenes from Annie. While they were funny, a part of me wanted to cringe seeing her throw a tantrum like a young child. While she found her footing by the end of the movie and turned out to be a successful women, the way she cried and put an unbelievable amount of selfish stress on her friend during her wedding planing was unfair and immature. What is good, is that the movie does correct this and teach a lesson in the end.

On some other somewhat downsides, I felt like this movie did not know if it wanted to be a raunchy comedy or a girly film for mothers and daughters. Many elements such as the romance and concept of weddings and girl power definitely makes this movie at least half chick flick. But it is so very raunchy. The girls vomit, the girls are absolutely vulgar, and honestly the sex scenes were a little ridiculous and I would have appreciated them to be a little more tasteful. Nonetheless, it was still all entertaining and interesting combination of genres.

In conclusion, I really enjoyed watching this movie with my family. It would make a good movie to pull out on a girls night as long as the audience is 15 years old and up. While the language and jokes probably would be find, I really have a hard time imagining a parent wanting young girls to see the sex scenes in this. My younger sister, 13 years old, did watch it but I wish I could have known ahead of time to fast forward. In a way, this film promotes successful women but in other ways makes them seem selfish and foolish. As long as you take this movie in the right way and look at it in the right light, it was a better than average chick flick that won't completely dumb your mind.",1373932800,,4284,4.55974025974026

Slooooooow, inept acting, except for an occasional well timed line by Melissa McCarthy.  Put you to sleep when you weren't sickened.

This is so much better and funnier than the Hangover franchise, which I found aimed at teenagers who enjoy laughing at a dog crapping in the yard. The Hangover films relied primarily on gross, over the top, shocking humor. This film has gross and shocking but makes the tasteless actually enjoyable. Instead of showing you the details it allows your imagination to fill in the blanks....this is what real art is about.

I could not feel any sympathy for her as she was whinny and immature beyond belief, determined to make the lives of everybody around her miserable because she and her best friend couldn't remain 9 years old forever. When they started to fly to Vegas, I was hoping it would get funny, but no, we didn't get to see Vegas, we ended up just watching Annie moping at home in a short, sleeveless outfit. On the plane, it looked like it might get a little amusing as Melissa McCarthy started to chat up the air marshal, but no, later McCarthy blocks his path, and makes crass sexual advances.

4591263,1,B0056IXS7S,"Those of you who liked this movie, I am not trying to tell you what to like, but this is not an accurate portrayal of women and how they act socially. I know that because I have been around women. Many people liked this film, and even demanded a sequel! So I had to see what the hype was.

Sadly, I was more than disappointed. The story is that Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is chosen to be Lillian Donovan's (Maya Rudolph) maid of honor. Unfortunately Annie manages to ruin every event of her engagement party, on both the plane ride, the bus ride, and the restaurant. Annie hopes for love with Ted, but begins flirting with a police officer, Nathan Rhodes. Annie goes through a tantrum after Helen gives Lillian a trip to paris. Lillian and Annie are then no longer friends. Megan, who is basically a wannabe lesbian character, gives Annie a pep talk. This the most absurd story ever written! No one, I repeat,  NO ONE ACTS LIKE THIS! I have spoke with many women and they have never had any type of experience. It is completely over exaggerated and unrealistic.

The amount of profanity in this film is beyond unnecessary. They drop the ""F"" bomb in almost every line. Nobody talks like that, I don't care how uptight you are. There is absolutely no chemistry between Annie and Nathan at all. There is absolutely not entertaining about this film. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's just pathetic! I love chick flicks, but this has to be the worst I have ever scene.

Sigh, I am just gonna say this flat out, this movie sucks! Now before you jump down my throat, I am a big fan when it comes down to movies portraying women and their social lives, I am a big fan of Sex and the city etc, but if this is the best writer's can come up with these days, I don't think there is any hope in reviving american chick flicks. I believe imdb rated it a 6.8, and rotten tomatoes rated it a 90%?! You got to be joking! And people are demanding a sequel?! I know I'm not sold. Sorry but maybe this film is not for everyone, I can't be the only one who felt this way.",1372982400,2,2060,4.315245478036176

4591312,4,B0056IXS7S,I picked this because my wife had already seen it and suggested that it was hilarious. Mellissa McCarthy was a knockdown funny character in it. The theme was outrageous and some of the scenes were guy type quality funny. Even dudes will laugh at this.,1371686400,,251,4.6

Oh, and while they're vomiting on top of each other over a toilet, another girl with the runs is relieving herself in the sink. I thought I was going to throw up. I don't find vomiting entertaining in the least! If you're looking for anything even remotely uplifting, save your money! This is a barf movie for childish minds.",1371254400,14,575,4.592233009708738

4591333,5,B0056IXS7S,"Before you watch this, know that the beginning appears rather graphic for the type of movie it is.  Don't worry too much about it as you never really see anything (aka no body parts), and that's the only actual sex scene in the movie.  Otherwise, the humor in the movie is fantastic and this really has become the female version of the Hangover.  My girlfriends and I love to sit around and watch this when we just need a good laugh.  So grab that bottle of wine (or something stronger) and grab a few friends and sit down to enjoy a truly hilarious movie.",1370822400,,556,4.3173076923076925

And although I like Kristin Wiig, I'm not a seven year old boy, and I don't want to throw up my popcorn when I'm watching a movie. But I recently found out that Chris O'Dowd, whom I've come to really like as an actor, is in it, and my daughter cued me in on when to fast forward. So leaving out the stupidity in the bridal shop scene, the rest of the movie was a surprising treat. It's got a lot of nuance on class, friendship, self-worth and love, and I enjoyed it a lot. For a baker, though, I didn't believe that Wiig has eaten an actual cupcake in a long, long time. And some of the character development felt uneven, like Helen's friendship with Lillian, and the fact that the only thing you know about the groom is that he's rich and his sister thinks he's a jerk. Chris O'Dowd's character, though, was totally worth it.",1370736000,,919,4.287356321839081

A lot of the ""humor"" in Bridesmaids is very crude and crass. The actors did the best they could in their roles, especially Melissa McCarthy, but it was a lame script. The fact that so many people liked this film makes me think there is no hope for humanity. Thank God I got it for free from the library and did not pay for it.",1370476800,,487,4.180851063829787

This was the first movie I'd seen with her in it, and I think she's just one of those people who could crack you up just by standing there.  The worst part - Maya Rudolph.  I have seen her in other things, and she continues to be annoying as always.  The surprise part (at least for me) - Kristen Wiig.  I was really amazed by how talented of an actress (and writer) she is.  She's way more than just another SNL wash-out.  Overall, thumbs up.",1370044800,,610,4.101694915254237

The ensemble works very well together and a few of the lesser known characters are now (updated review March 26, 2017) well-known: Wendi McClendon-Covey for The Goldbergs and Ellie Kemper for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. I would love to see a sequel, perhaps a baby shower version?

It's fun to see women acting in the types of roles that have been traditionally the venue of male actors. While some parts of the movie are kind of silly in the run it doesn't matter because it was so hysterically funny!

I mean, there is a strange amount of belching, vomit, and s*** jokes in this movie.

After watching (and this movie felt like 5 hours), I could not believe that so many people have been raving about this movie... I don't think I laughed once.  Any parts of the movie that could have been funny were in the trailers or previews - and they still weren't that funny.  I guess people just have a really lame sense of humor, but this movie was not even worth the $2 I paid to rent it.  To sum up this movie in one word - LAME.

4591490,5,B0056IXS7S,"I enjoyed this movie Immensely and was familiar with Melissa McCarthy from her show ""Mike and Molly"", Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph. Having been a fan of the series ""The Hangover"", I decided to see this movie. They are very different, but similar in the way the characters go from one mess to another, one bad situation caused by Rose Byrne character with her need to be perfect and the ensuing madness of Wiig character after discovering what she had done.
What separates this is the heart that the Melissa McCarthy character has vs the Zach Galifianakis character in ""Hangover"". I thought that originally she would be like many characters that are overweight comic relief (ie John Belushi) but as the movie progressed, the scene she had with Kristen Wiig later made her a lot more real and much more centered as person who was helping her friend. I can see why she was nominated and yes, she deserved it.
I'm a guy, I like guy movies, and yes, I liked this one because while it was emotional, it was not pretentious.",1364515200,,1018,4.5989010989010985

Ok, we all have bridesmaid horror stories...but this was just plain gross. Really...the scene in the dress shop was over the top...come one, plenty of things happen there on a normal basis to howl over. And bridal showers are a great source of amuzement - why didn't anyone just ask a new bride for some examples?
Hollywood - the writing stunk...you could have done so much more with these actresses - they all had the potential to take this one over the top. But really, stuffing them into this flop was just plain senseless.

Forget that Hangover movie(the 1st one only), this movie rocks. If you saw women on the DVD cover and thought, ""They've all got their clothes on"" then might I suggest a movie with Paul Rudd instead?

4591511,1,B0056IXS7S,"I rented this because I love Kristen Wiig.  She used to do such subversive humor on Saturday Night Live.  Or sometimes it was just over the top and bizarre, but always hilarious.

I can't believe she could make something so mediocre like ""Bridesmaids"".  This movie was not funny at all.  I did not laugh once.  People often compare it to ""The Hangover"" but the ""The Hangover"" actually had some funny moments of sheer stupidity.  I wouldn't say that was a great comedy either.

The message I got from this movie is that if you don't get married or have a great career your life is pathetic and not worth living.  The fact that Wiig's character works in retail is portrayed as almost tragic, like she's the biggest loser ever.  I can't believe humor like that would go over so well, especially in this bad economy when most people are lucky to have any kind of job.

Considering Judd Apatow produced this it makes sense.  Any film he is involved with usually involves mocking working class people.  They should change the name of this movie to ""White People Problems"".

Could anyone honestly sympathize with Wiig's character over losing her bakery?  I mean businesses fail all the time.  Owning a bakery is a pretty self-indulgent career, most people do not need cupcakes.

Also, half the female characters in this film seem to be suffering from Borderline personality disorder, they are needy, emotionally unstable, and have no ability to be alone.

God, what an awful movie.  I really feel stupid that I fell for the marketing hype.

Kristen Wiig can do so much better.  So can Rose Byrne.  What a waste of talent.",1363737600,5,1614,4.689285714285714

You must know that it is an intimate look into the life of two best friends. You have to understand what is going on the inside with these women before you can make a judgement on the content. It has a lot of wisdom and a ton of laughter. You need to watch it at least three times before you make it your fave!,1362614400,,446,4.079545454545454
4591544,2,B0056IXS7S,I rented this movie because it has Melissa McCarthy in it. I didn't like the cursing and only watched about 20 minutes of it. I was ready to turn it off.,1362614400,,153,3.967741935483871

It was however produced by Judd Apatow, and that alone made me give it a chance. Basically, Bridesmaids is a girls version of The Hangover meets Knocked Up, with an almost trip to Vegas and without the hangover. Kristen Wiig is the writer and star of this film and she was great! I'd never even heard of her before this film came out, but after seeing it, I want a lot more. It seems pretty hard for a woman to make it in comedy, it's a fairly rare event, but she's got a tremendous future ahead of her. As for the story it's pretty solid, it's a comedy, so you're not really looking for realism, just something cohesive that you can follow and this definitely fits the bill. If you're looking for something funny, but different, I'd highly recommend this film.",1361577600,,911,4.396449704142012

4591567,1,B0056IXS7S,"Is this supposed to be a comedy?  If it is, i sure could not tell.  The story revolves a completely unlikable character and her unlikable best friend, who has an unlikable new best friend, and then there are some marginal bit players throw in as well.  This all might work if the movie was a parody or over the top ridiculous, but there is a serious tone for the majority of the movie.

The main character has a terrible life.  She intentionally does a poor job at work, is attracted to a man that literally treats her like garbage (and she knows it), and she tries to sabotage her best friend's wedding because her best friend is now incredibly materialistic and she cannot keep up financially.  And, the best friend's new best friend is even more unlikable and materialistic.  Oh yeah, all of this happens while the main character plays the ""boo hoo, poor me"" role like life has dealt her a bad deck of cards.

It is obvious that the producers of the movie compared this to The Hangover in order to generate buzz, because i just see no parallel.  Stay away.",1360972800,6,1059,4.44559585492228

4591573,1,B0056IXS7S,"After watching this movie as a free rental from the library both my girlfriend and I agree its one of the worst movies we have ever seen.

Spoiler alerts from here on out.

In the beginning of the movie I thought perhaps this is going to work.  Like so many reviews I'd read I was expecting the Hangover treatment at any point.  The fart and vomit jokes were just so sad they weren't funny.  I can't imagine why anyone thinks puking on someone's hair is funny but if you do so be it.  The main character is unlikable and depends on finding a man to save here, which is so pathetic but even one she meets a good man she's too dumb to realize it.  So when the movie leads to a trip to Vegas I was thinking finally the funny is going to kick in.

This is where things go wrong.  They never make it to Vegas which might have been the movies promised land.  Instead a flight scene carries on for what seems like forever and the movie reverts back to its boring ways.

Avoid this hot garbage at all costs.  Its not even worth a free rental.",1360368000,15,1034,4.115

4591611,5,B0056IXS7S,"There's a reason the Golden Globes nominated this film for Best Comedy and Best Actress to Kristin Wiig (who also was one of the writers and by the way the Academy Awards nominated said script for Best Screenplay). At first you think it's another romantic comedy sold as the ""female hangover"" but if was just that then why has it received so many nominations and walked away with a few, too?

Quite simply the tale has depth and nuances that many female romantic comedies can never hope to attain. I don't wish to give spoilers in the tale so I'll avoid talking about specific scenes that will break the movie enjoyment.

Tale focuses upon a woman named Annie Walker (played by Kristin Wiig), who recently lost her bakery to the Great Recession (she works a crap sales job now) and is in the works to realizing that her current boyfriend (played by John Hamms) only wants a sexual relationship. Things get worse as she realizes she cannot meet the rent and even worse her best friend is getting married and planning a huge celebration of it and oh this best friend brings in another friend who threatens Annie in several ways. Did I mention her roomies are amusing yet creepy, too? Heh.

Even though it's a comedy there are serious questions that roll with it. What do relatively intelligent people do when their business fails during the Great Recession? How far should a friend go in helping a depressed friend especially when the former is busy preparing for her wedding? How much do you help a depressed friend before you have to call them on reveling in their victim mentality? How much of one's depression is self destructive and only makes matters worse?

Sometimes you wince at the painful moments but more often you're laughing because there are some great moments. Look for the Ethel Merman reference on the plane and the special dance when the police dude thinks she is intoxicated. I especially liked at the end when she tried to incite the cop dude (played by Chris O'Dowd) by breaking every law possible as he tried to pretend he did not care. Yes, he became a lover interest later if it wasn't already apparent.

Notable performances also by Maya Angelou (the bride), Jill Clayburgh (Annie's mother), Rose Byrne (the female opponent) and especially Melissa McCarthy who played a foul mouthed ""man in a female body"" future sister-in-law who said and did all the wrong things that needed to be communicated in this picture. As far as supporting cast go she nailed it and it's no surprise she was nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress because she was so much more than Miss Raunchy.

The budget for this film was a bit over $32M and it made roughly a whopping $288M at the Box Office. Wilson Phillips fans will appreciate the ending song.

Nothing fresh about it, just the same old ""meet cute"" between Annie and the cop (who is waaaayy too good for her!), with a half-million F-bombs thrown in.  The women who appear in the movie are good actresses, but the all-too-predictable story stinks.  I'm sorry I wasted my money buying it, but so many reviewers said it was hilarious.  Very, very disappointing and I do not recommend it.  Go with New Year's Eve or Rock of Ages, if  you want a fun movie night.",1356998400,,577,4.447619047619048

Ladies one word of caution: make sure you use the restroom before starting this and if you laugh as hard as me, you may want to pause it when they get to the dress shop and use the restroom again. I had to pause the movie during this segment to avoid an accident I was laughing so much. Absolutely great. Definitely will watch again. Definitely recommend watching with your friends. And recommend the dvd extras on this one too. Some are more crude but others are just as funny as the movie itself. A+++ I will be watching this one again and again and passing around to friends.

I'm tired of the cliche genre of comedies that is only approved for the female gender- romantic-comedies, ones where the mom switch places with the daughter, BFFs fighting over something or other. Why is raunchy humor reserved for guys?!

I was texting my friend as I was watching it telling her how funny it was. It's a very funny movie and it brings up so many truths to parenting, marriage, relationships, dating, friendships, finding a breaking point and all of those things we assume when we're dating and how right and wrong they might be and much more.

4591666,4,B0056IXS7S,"Given the reviews and the comments by many of those who'd already seen the movie, I was expecting ""Bridesmaids"" to be a bit more of a raucous affair than it ultimately turned out to be. Yet, while it isn't exactly the ""groundbreaking"" film so many people had described it as being, there's enough you-go-girl sassiness and charm to make it a pleasant enough comedic experience.

SNL alums, Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig (who co-wrote the screenplay with Annie Mumolo), play best friends from childhood, Lillian and Annie, the former a career-woman who's getting ready to tie the knot with a wealthy banker, and the latter, an insecure bundle of neuroses with commitment issues whom Lillian has asked to be her bridesmaid. Into the breach steps Rose Byrne (Glenn Close's bete noire from TV's ""Damages""), as Lillian's snooty new friend whom Annie sees as a rival for Lillian's affections. The focus of the screenplay is mainly on Annie, as she goes about subconsciously sabotaging many of the traditional pre-wedding festivities, as well as her own chances at happiness.

Though the women here are occasionally foul-mouthed and uninhibited in their behavior and topics of conversation, they really aren't as crude and vulgar as the media - looking for a look-even-women-can-be-as-bad as-men storyline - has made them out to be. In fact, the tone of much of the movie is sweet and thoughtful, as Annie copes with her very recognizably human feelings of inferiority and jealousy.

Directed by Paul Feig, the movie alternates between broad slapstick and sophisticated satire without skipping a beat, though there is the occasional dry-spot to slow down the proceedings. And Melissa McCarthy (""Mike and Molly"") steals every scene she's in as a straight-talking tomboy who obviously flunked out of the Miss Manners School of Social Etiquette.

It's not a great comedy by any stretch, but it's hard not to be won over by it in the end.",1354492800,,1927,5.031347962382445

4591670,5,B0056IXS7S,"There has been a debate in comedy and film circles for a long time about whether or not females can ever truly be considered as funny or funnier than their male counterparts.  I've been in groups where women have done the same joke as a man had done for a different, though similar in demographic, audience.  The women delivered the joke in much the same way, but never got as many laughs.  Don't get me wrong here, this movie doesn't deliver jokes that is absolutely the same as any other movie.  But look at all of the one star reviews!  Does this movie feature vulgarity?  YES - and I understand that one-star reviews will come with that every time.  Does Kristen Wiig's character (main character) whine and act selfish?  YES - it's part of the comedy and story and it's too bad that this went over the heads of some viewers.  It's too bad because when they were focusing on those things, they missed out on an amazing movie.  Melissa McCarthy had me laughing so hard I cried.  Ugly cried, even.  Her performance stood out, even though she was among some big comedy names.  I was thrilled to see some talent from across the ocean(s) in Chris O'Dowd, Rebel Wilson, and Matt Lucas.

I love a good comedy, but this was surprisingly awful. The only redeeming characters were the Irish? Scottish? (hard to place the accent) state cop and the strangely likeable sister-of-the-groom. The main character (Kristen Wiig) was overly pathetic/insecure and her bride-to-be friend (Maya Rudolph) weak and spineless with little care for her supposedly BFF's financial struggles and emotional issues. I really love Kristin Wiig and Maya Rudolph from SNL days, but this vehicle didn't do either of them justice. I see lots of positive reviews for this movie and looked forward to watching it. In hindsight, I regret the 2+ hours I will never get back. This is just a barely mediocre movie with some really awkward scenes complete with disgusting vomit, fart and poop jokes.

4591683,5,B0056IXS7S,"When I first went to see the movie Bridesmaids in theatres, I was weary at first.  I'm not into chick flicks and romance movies, honestly, I was really only going because my sister was paying.  The movie Bridesmaids is about a woman, Annie who becomes Maid of Honor at her best friend, Lillian's wedding.  As happy as Annie is for Lillian, she can't help but feel bad about herself, as she is single and working a job she doesn't want because her bakery shut down.
  To me, this film can be classified as a romantic comedy.  It's a romantic comedy because Annie, the main character is sleeping with a guy who only wants a sexual relationship, and then she meets a trooper, and gets together with him.  She then ditches him because he tries to get her to achieve her goals by restarting her failed bakery.  Towards the end of the movie, she realizes what's best for is the trooper.  There are many characters in a romantic comedy.  There is the antagonist, the protagonist, the suitor, the unsuitable suitor and of course, the best friend.  The protagonist in this movie is Annie (played by Kristen Wig).  Annie is the Maid of Honor at her best friend's wedding.  The best friend is Lillian (Maya Rudolph), who is getting married.  The unsuitable suitor is a man named Ted (John Hamm), with whom Annie has a no-strings-attached sexual relationship.  The suitable suitor is a state patrol officer named Nathan (Chris O'Dowd) whom Annie meets after she gets pulled over.  Then there's the antagonist, whom without her there would be no story, is Helen (Rose Byrne).  Helen is one of the bridesmaids that Annie clashes with, because it seems that Helen is trying to steal Lillian away from Annie.  Also appearing is the hilarious Melissa McCarthy as one of Lillian's bridesmaids.
  While weary at first, I would give this movie two thumbs up.  From the food poisoning scene, to the wild chase on the airplane, this movie will have you constantly laughing.  Probably the best thing in this movie is Melissa McCarthy, who plays Lillian's future sister-in-law.  The things she says and does just make the movie so much better.  If she is in the scene, you know you will be laughing until your stomach hurts.  The movie Bridesmaids can be described as the female hangover, but not just for females, men I bet would love it also.

4591687,3,B0056IXS7S,"Bridesmaids was a huge hit with both critics and audiences because it successfully combined what women think is funny with what men think is funny.

Women think relationships are funny, whether the relationships are with men, other women, children, pets, cars, jobs (more or less in that order) ... with anything, in other words, as long as the humor gently points out how exasperating but challenging and potentially rewarding it is to try to relate to other creatures, animate or inanimate. In sharp contrast, men don't think anything is funny except doing in public what normal people do only alone in the bathroom with the door locked. Bridesmaids' considerable achievement is combining those two seemingly incompatible elements seamlessly into one coherent movie.

As a gay man, I most enjoyed the relationship humor, but as a man, I laughed out loud (and I really couldn't help it, because I tried) ONLY at the scene where all the women suffer food poisoning in the high-class, by-appointment-only, white-carpeted bridal shop - especially Melissa McCarthy perched on the sink.

I think I can safely say that every single male human being who saw this movie laughed out loud at that scene; and many of the straight men afterward congratulated themselves, astonished that they were able to enjoy a chick-flick. That's because THIS otherwise ordinary chick-flick was peppered with enough guy gross-out humor to keep them from fidgeting, but not with so much that it turned women off. It's still 80% orthodox chick-flick, but 20% farting, vomiting and explosive diarrhea is enough to keep most men satisfied.",1347667200,,1610,5.137404580152672

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

Many people compared 'Bridesmaids' to 'The Hangover' but in terms of the comic tone of its characters, I found it much more similar to a recent indie film, 'Cyrus'. Both films attempt to get laughs by introducing a series of passive-aggressive types. The passive-aggressive credentials of the film's protagonist, Annie Walker, is established very early on when she sleeps with a boyfriend who also is afflicted with a passive-aggressive personality. When the boyfriend aggressively declares he has a rule about not sleeping over, instead of acting angrily, Annie lamely declares, ""you're funny in the morning.""

The interesting thing about the passive-aggressive type is that the passivity masks a deeply repressed reservoir of anger. When the anger finally rises to the surface, it often comes out as a challenge, marked by a hurried retreat. We see this when Annie and her best friend Lillian (the bride to be) attempt to take an exercise class in the park without paying. When they're found out by the instructor, they run off with the excuse that they can no longer afford the high price of admission (despite actually costing $12).

Annie's lack of self-esteem is on display when she turns off her customers by telling them that you can't trust anybody, while working as a salesperson at the jewelry store. As is often the case with a lot of the characters here, there's a thin line between the unsavoriness of their blatant aggression and viewing that aggression as humorous.

Often the language of the passive-aggressive character is cloaked in overly diplomatic terms; the underlying sub-text of course, is an insult. For example, when Annie's mother (played by Jill Clayburgh in her last film role) tries to put a positive spin on Annie's negative life situation, she relates a story of a floundering gay prostitute she met at an AA meeting, concluding that ""hitting bottom is a good thing.""

Screenwriters Wiig and co-writer Annie Mumulo try to mine as many laughs as possible from Lillian's assorted bridesmaids with mixed results. Lillian's cousin Rita can't stand her ""disgusting"" three teenagers and the joke about semen being all over the house is too crude to be funny. Becca, Lillian's friend from work and Megan, the groom's sister, ineptly conclude that Annie isn't single when they spot her next to two successive creepy guys who they should have known she would have no interest in. Little is done with newly married Becca character throughout the film but Megan (Melissa McCarthy from the 'Mike & Molly' TV series) proves to be one of the more amusing aggressive characters in the passive-aggressive pantheon. Megan not only can bond with a dolphin while on vacation but isn't afraid to make her sexual wants known (in spying one particular tall guy at the wedding, she proclaims, ""I'm going to climb that like a tree"").

It's Helen, the snippy Trophy wife of the groom's boss, who turns out to be Bridesmaid's central antagonist. Again, the dialectic between her passive and aggressive side is evident when we first meet her. Helen aggressively attempts to steal Annie's thunder as they lock horns with their back and forth toasts to Lillian at the engagement party (the joke becomes tiresome as it goes on for much too long). There's more silly shenanigans during the tennis game, when we view Helen and Annie blasting one another with tennis balls in slow motion. Only Helen's completely lame, passive remark to the stepson's expletive (""put a quarter in the smear jar"") hits the mark!

Annie begins to lose Lillian's affections when she brings the bridesmaids to the Brazilian restaurant and most of them end up with food poisoning later on at the fitting room. It's a scene that doesn't work at all as it's too divorced from any kind of recognizable reality (both Megan and Lillian end up defecating in inappropriate places including a sink and outside in the middle of the street). Annie's meltdown on the plane to Vegas proves to be only slightly more amusing. Most of it relies on Annie's face-off with the flight attendant while she's intoxicated. The bit with Annie in sunglasses pretending to be a first-class passenger is something a real drunk would do--but when Annie exclaims that there's a 'colonial woman' churning butter out on the wing--that is truly a line of inspired lunacy! Meanwhile we do take some pleasure in Megan's vindication over her insistence that the man sitting next to her on the plane indeed turns out to be an air marshal.

There's one more truly amusing moment before 'Bridesmaids' devolves into sentimental romantic comedy--that's Annie's confrontation with the young woman back at the jewelry store, resulting in her being fired (in substance: Young lady: Did you take your Xanax? Annie: You have four boyfriends--have fun having a baby at your prom).

Once Annie has her final meltdown at Lillian's shower, Lillian expresses her true feelings toward Annie (how she's truly screwed up the pre-wedding preparations). Events are now set in motion where whatever comedy remains in this very spotty laugh-fest, is lost. Megan drops her animosity toward Annie and conscripts her to help find Lillian who's gotten cold feet about going through with the wedding. I haven't mentioned Officer Rhodes as he's the least interesting character in the film. After Rhodes reluctantly agrees to help locate Lillian (he traces through her cell phone messages), it's only inevitable that he and Annie will end up together after Annie's initial sabotage of their relationship.

'Bridesmaids' probably has gotten more accolades than it deserves as it's one of the few films today that features an ensemble of women in comic roles. Unfortunately those roles are formulaic, as the passive-aggressive types proffered up here, could probably fit into any situation featuring contemporary mores. Occasionally there's a clever line or two but the humor quickly devolves into silly slapstick or outright crudity. Perhaps with some tighter editing, 'Bridesmaids' might have proved more palatable in the end.",1344729600,3,6107,5.07876370887338

No job, no money, has to move home and now her best friend, Lil, who's engaged, is warming up to a new friend, Helen. So now, Annie sees her BFF drifting away from her and it's unbearable for her. The scene in the bridal shop is gross, but the scene in the airplane is hysterical. At the bridal shower scene we not only see Annie's total breakdown, but also Lil finally blowing her top at Annie. Up until that point, we see Lil as a really good and understanding friend. The brother & sister roommates are total madcap hilarity...and it was great to see Jill Claybourgh in her last role. I think you need to see this movie several times to catch all the undertones of friendship, marriage and someone really frightened that she's losing everything important. I took away one star for the following...when a woman gets engaged, her bff wants to see the ring, talk about the ring, etc. Annie just takes a quick peak, which is strange since she works in a jewelry store. Also the dress Lil wears for her wedding looks like the one she tried on at the bridal store.

The Wilson Philips song at the end is a good theme song for her. I love Megan because she is so genuine.",1343174400,,438,4.4875
4591701,4,B0056IXS7S,"Kristen Wiig is a comedic goldmine.  She just knows how to milk `funny' out of any and everything.  The fact that she wrote this screenplay is testament to that fact.  What it is also testament to is that she understands the importance of layering her comedy with drama, and by drama I don't mean your textbook drama of the theatrical kind (although some of that is here too) but what I mean is genuine, heartfelt drama of the almost bitter-sweet kind.  There is a sadness here that meshes beautifully with those `funny moments'.

`Bridesmaids', which was marketed as a `Hangover' for chicks (complete with focus on a Las Vegas bachelorette party) is anything but a rehashing of that successful 2009 comedy.  Instead, Las Vegas is a minor scene that doesn't even really happen and so the focus of that event in the trailer was an obvious misleading of audiences, but it was a twist I was so happy to embrace because last thing I wanted to see was this turn into `Hangover' redux.  Instead, `Bridesmaids' tells the story of a Maid of Honor trying to get a grip on her own thankless life while trying to support her best friend, who happens to be getting married.  Annie is so lonely and pathetic and depressed and yet Lillian is glowing with marital happiness.  When Annie meets Helen, Lillian's `other' best friend, a rivalry is born for Lillian's affections and attention and soon the crazy is unleashed in various forms.

`Bridesmaids' primary problem is that it doesn't know when to call it a day.  It is probably about twenty minutes too long.  That isn't to say that there is a lot of fluff here, because there really isn't and the more mellow moments (especially concerning Annie's budding romance with traffic cop Rhodes) are needed in developing the film as a whole, but it really should have been trimmed back.

The performances are all wonderful.  Wiig is flawless here, truly developing her character beyond the comedic timing.  Just watch her face as she hears about Lillian's engagement.  There is such sadness behind those eyes, such depth of character.  You can see her telling her story without uttering a single word.  Rose Byrne should probably stick to comedy forever since she isn't having much luck with the drama side of things and her performance here is the highlight of her career (she was also lovely in her jovial scenes in `Marie Antoinette').  She is totally on her A-game and delivers some of the film's funniest moments.

And I just love Chris O'Dowd!

In the end, `Bridesmaids' is a great little film.  It is funny and charming and sincere, which is a hard combination to come by these days, especially in this genre.  Wiig exercises her funny muscle in more ways than one and develops a film that keeps on giving.",1342483200,,2746,4.722689075630252

Her efforts to seduce the man seated next to her on a flight are unforgettable. Even in the background of other scenes, she is always engaging in some sort of funny behavior.

Also what happened with the failed bakery? Why keep showing it and incorporating it into the plot, when nothing will be done with it. I assumed the cop (who had an invested interest in the bakery for some reason) would buy it, Annie would reopen it, and they would live happily ever after. That whole plot idea was tossed aside or simply lost on the cutting room floor. I feel like I didn't get to see the WHOLE movie. Like I went for popcorn and missed huge sections of the plot.

4591729,4,B0056IXS7S,"I always love the notion of women being dubbed ""the fairer sex.""  I've always been raised that a woman can do pretty much anything a man can do, and if my 41 years on this earth have taught me anything, it's that women can be just as crude, boorish and stupid as men.

Hollywood seems to forget this, basing far too many of its female characters (especially in comedies) on sterile models of Barbie-esque perfection.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Hollywood has milked the ""funny good guy must steal the bombshell from the rich jerk"" storyline for ages - the object of desire in these movies is invariably given little to do.  (Think Rachel McAdams in ""Wedding Crashers"" - a talented actress does little more than grin and look gorgeous).

""Bridesmaids"" takes a refreshing break from tradition by focusing almost exclusively on the ladies.  And these ladies, by and large, do not act like ""ladies,"" but instead are well-rounded, flawed, funny women.  Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph of ""SNL"" fame play lifelong friends who are going on different tracks as they head into their 30s.  Wiig's Annie has her self-esteem in the dumpster after her Milwaukee bakery failed - now she's content to be on the booty call speed dial for a spectacular jerk (Jon Hamm of ""Mad Men"").  Rudolph's Lillian, on the other hand, has gotten engaged to a successful guy in Chicago and she seems destined for a life of country clubs and European vacations.

Both friends understand they are growing apart, so Lillian asks Annie to be her maid of honor, naturally.  Annie is thrilled, only to be horrified that Lillian's future sister-in-law appears to be all-too-eager to become Lillian's new best friend.  This harpy, Helen, played with WASPy evil by Rose Byrne, is everything that Annie is not - rich, poised, and (seemingly) self-assured.  What ensues is a traditional battle royale between Annie and Helen as they vie for the role of maid of honor.  Thanks to the other bridesmaids, including Megan (Melissa McCarthy) and Rita (Wendi McLendon Covey of ""Reno 911""), this is a battle spiced with raunchy humor and replete with poetic profanity.  These are good things.

I must admit that I came to ""Bridesmaids"" late, after all the hype and Oscar nominations.  Ultimately I can't say that this is a great comedy - it is genuinely funny and has a few laugh-out-loud moments, and it definitely has a heart.  But all I've heard is that ""'Bridesmaids' is the new 'Hangover.'""  That just flat-out isn't true - even despite the great comic performance by Melissa McCarthy as Megan, there is nothing in ""Bridesmaids"" that is as original as ""The Hangover,"" if only because there is nothing in this movie that approaches the comic genius of Zach Galifianakis.  (Perhaps if Wendi McLendon Covey had been given a little more to do - she inexplicably gets no lines in the second half of the movie.  The lady is comic gold.)

Definitely a solid comic effort - something that is all too rare these days - and an enjoyable reminder that women can do far more in a comedy than be the sterile object of desire.  Recommended.",1336089600,3,3090,4.7560975609756095
4591730,4,B0056IXS7S,"Meet Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig), whose life is not going well. Her bakery shop on which she spent so much money has failed. Her life is falling apart like her old car. But her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph), who is going to marry, asks Annie to be her bride of honor. Annie is happy to accept, but soon realizes that organizing a wedding requires great patience especially when you have to compete with rich and domineering Helen (Rose Byrne).

Whether or not you like ""Bridesmaids,"" one of the biggest hits of 2011, depends on what you expect from the film, which is produced by Judd Apatow. ""Bridesmaids"" is a ""laugh-out-loud"" comedy, not a romantic comedy. The film's story is more about the rivalry and friendship between women, which is told with several gross-out jokes involving sex, food poisoning and drinking.

In comedy there is a thin line between ""laughing with"" and ""laughing at."" While wavering between the two territories, ""Bridesmaids"" often leans toward the latter with episodes (the bathroom scene) that will make you laugh at the expense of the characters' dignities. While some audiences will find it hilarious, others will think it is embarrassing. OK, ""The Help"" also has a pie-eating episode, but it is not that crude.

""Bridesmaids"" is a string of sketches cobbled together. The sketches are mostly funny, but the film loses momentum when it starts to take itself seriously, with a subplot about Annie's romantic interest. I enjoyed watching the film, but does it deserve Oscar nominations? I don't know....",1336003200,,1537,4.99609375
4591731,1,B0056IXS7S,"A lot of people I know love ""Bridesmaids"".  I keep wondering if they watched a different film than the one I saw, because if I were an executive from Kodak, I would have sued the producers for defamation of perfectly good film stock.

With the exception of Melissa McCarthy, who was absolutely hilarious as Megan, ""Bridesmaid"" is simply not funny.  It ranks among the worst films I've ever seen in my lifetime - right there with ""Pulp Fiction"" (another movie a lot of people like) and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (another Judd Apatow movie I really wanted to like but can't).  There is absolutely no one in this movie I care for, least of all Kristen Wiig as the relationship-challenged Annie.  I fully understand Annie's predicament - she's trying to compete with Helen (Rose Byrne) to demonstrate how much affection she has for their mutual friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph), the bride-to-be in the movie.  And there's no way Annie can compete, not with Helen holding the financial cards.  I also understand Annie's frustration with life itself.  It's hard to take things in stride when your world is falling apart and others around you are enjoying success, seemingly without doing much at all to earn it.

But ""Bridesmaids"", which has so much subtext and room for depth and development and could've been a classic along the lines of ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", devolves into the kind of juvenile humor that has supplanted sharp writing and timing in modern Hollywood.  The food poisoning scene, which many have found funny, revolted me.  I've had food poisoning before.  There's nothing funny about it.  I think there is a place in movies for humor like that, if it's kept within the context of the movie.  For example, in ""Big Momma's House"", there was a scene in which Big Momma had to go because of some prunes she ate.  That was funny because the occassional urgent need to go is an almost universal experience that is relatable, but even more so because Martin Lawrence's character, who was hiding in the bathroom at the time Big Momma let go, was exposed to the aftermath.

Even more egregious was that this was the final film for the normally reliable Jill Clayburgh, who I enjoyed watching in movies such as ""First Monday in October"" and ""Silver Streak"".  It's tough to watch a fine actress working in a film with this level of schlock, and Ms. Clayburgh honestly deserved a better sendoff than this.

On the whole, ""Bridesmaids"" owes me three stars - one for me sitting through it, one for me writing this review, and one for me not being an executive of Kodak and thus not in a position to sue them for wasting a lot of film that could've been used to make a better movie.",1336003200,6,2686,4.666666666666667

4591733,1,B0056IXS7S,"Kristen Wiig simply doesn't have what it takes to be a movie actress.  She was very funny in some of her earlier work with SNL, but now she's just stupid.

Maya Rudolph is also really bad in this movie.  Maya used to be funny, but now she acts like she's a hottie and that's very weird because she is quite ugly.

I kept skipping thru it for what seemed like forever and the movie was still not even close to ending.  It's over two hours long.

Something that made no sense to me about this movie was all the british people or actors playing british people in the movie.  Did that add anything?  NO!

This movie is very similar to the ones with Jason Sudeikis in them.  Maybe they have fun making the movies, but I certainly had no fun watching them.",1335744000,7,750,4.21830985915493
4591734,4,B0056IXS7S,"Saturday Night Live have generated many female stars who have transitioned successfully from television to film and you have to add Kristen Wiig to that list as her film ""Bridesmaids"" is hilarious, fun and a fantastic comedy!  Definitely recommended!

It's time for another Apatow produced comedy but this time, it's not about the guys but all about the ladies in ""Bridesmaids"", a film written by Saturday Night Live star/comedienne Kristen Wiig and actress Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig (""The Office"", ""Nurse Jackie"", ""Weeds"").

The comedy was released in May 2011 by Universal Pictures and was met with critical acclaim and surpassing ""Knocked Up"" as the top-grossing Judd Apatow film to date (the film was budgeted at $32.5 million and earned over $281 million in the box office).

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Bridesmaids: Unrated"" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen.  Picture quality for the DVD is very good as a lot of the scenes are shot outdoors BUT if you are wanting the best quality version of this film, the Blu-ray version is the way to go, because this film is quite vibrant and looks much better in High Definition.

The Audio is presented in English, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 and English DVS Dolby Digital 2.0.  On DVD, the audio is clear coming through the front and center channels, good use of ambiance from the crowd and music coming from the surround channels but if you want better audio quality, once again, you will want to go for the Blu-ray version which should have a much more immersive soundtrack ala lossless.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Finally, we get to see Kristen Wiig show us her true talent as a writer and as an actress in ""Bridesmaids"".

Yes, she has appeared in ""MacGruber"" and ""Extract"" and of course, we see much more of her comedienne talents on ""Saturday Night Live"", but ""Bridesmaids"" is the film that allowed her to show her creative side as a writer but also as the lead actress.

And what I loved about the movie is that while it does contain the hilarious, gut-busting gross out scenes that we are typically used to seeing on a Judd Apatow film, what ""Bridesmaids"" does much better than other Apatow films is that it manages to keep things real, in the fact that the situation Annie is in, happens to many people during this survival era during this economy.

Depression from losing a business, depression from not making much income, depression of working a job that you don't enjoy, depression of things not working right in your life and things tend to compound itself one after the other with Annie that she is unable to deal with it.  She becomes reclusive, doesn't have many friends and the one true friend that she does have, she finds out that she has this other life with friends and also has a best friend, while Annie had always thought that she was Lilian's (Maya Rudolph) ""best friend"".

Fortunately, ""Bridesmaids"" is a comedy thus the film doesn't explore the psyche, dark depression that Annie is in but instead showcases her ability to sabotage things in her life.  Her jealousy towards Helen (Rose Byrne) ignites this inner jealousy of trying to one-up her, but she is unable to and it just causes problems.

Maya Rudolph's role as Lillian is possibly her best role to date.  While she does partake in some of the hilarious moments in the film, it's not forceful like other Apatow films where everyone has to be hilarious (or borderline-stupid).  She cares about her friend and trying to keep things balanced between her childhood friend Annie and her best friend Helen.

And Rose Byrne does a fantastic job in playing the somewhat devious best friend that clamors for attention and always trying to remain positive despite not having any close relationships with anyone else around her but Lillian.  Similar to Rita, her stepkids are just as mean to her.  But Byrne looks absolutely ravishing in this role and also partakes in some of the fun moments of the film.

But then you have the other female characters and once again, I'm sure people can relate to these type of women...Becca (Ellie Kemper) as the woman who has been with only one man and has never experienced other men, so she never really had the chance to explore and the other friend Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey) is a woman who may have married wealthy, but she is bitter about how life has changed after marriage and having children.  Having a husband who doesn't look at her the same when she was younger and having children who are young but yet are quite profane towards her.  So, Rita acts as the negative person towards Becca of how life will not always be happy and cheerful because of marriage.

And then of course, you have the odd-ball Megan.  Melissa McCarthy's character is so off-the-wall, you just don't know what is going to come out of her mouth.  Surprising, hilarious and once again, the Apatow style of filmmaking of where improvisation really brings out the craziness of the character.  And just as off the wall are Annie's British roommates, you just don't know what will come out of their mouths as well, especially the visual of the female roommate (played by Rebel Wilson).

And the film also has the one of the final appearances of the late Jill Clayburgh and also features the musical reunion of Wilson Phillips.

The DVD contains both the regular theatrical edition and the director's cut. The main difference from what I have found is a scene in which Annie's British roommates are bathing with each other and when Annie goes on a blind date with a single father. There is nothing extra raunchy about the unrated version, but it was good choice for Paul Feig to eliminate those scenes from the theatrical edition.

There are a good number of special features included and but if you have a Blu-ray player, I would definitely choose the Blu-ray edition over the DVD edition because their are many outdoor, colorful scenes and I have no doubt in my mind that those scenes would look much more vibrant in HD.

Overall, ""Bridesmaids"" is a fantastic comedy.  Guys who are used to Apatow films can easily get into this film and see how an-all female cast can be equally funny (and gross) but I have to admit, of the many Apatow films I have seen so far, ""Bridesmaids"" is well-written and well-cast and strikes a fine balance between the crazy and hilarious moments of an Apatow film but yet managing to incorporate a screenplay that is fun, entertaining and worth watching.

Only to have her ""win"" in the end...but what has she really won...after 30 some years apparently how to act mature for the final 4 minutes of the movie.

4591750,4,B0056IXS7S,"When BRIDESMAIDS made its theatrical run the spouse and I heard great word-of-mouth compliments from movie-goers, but we were never able to catch it.  So when this film appeared on cable I went out of my way to plan a viewing; now, having seen BRIDESMAIDS several times, I will be adding this hysterical romp to my movie collection.  BRIDESMAIDS is laugh out loud funny; it's snorting your drink through your nose funny; it's rolling on the couch funny.  Kristen Wiig leads this exceptional cast as insecure, self-destructive Annie, a woman with a knack for picking loser boyfriends (Jon Hamm in an uncredited role), with her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), getting married--and asking Annie to be her Maid of Honor.  Among the other bridesmaids is the beautiful, organized, and filthy rich Helen (Rose Byrne), who is vying to become Lillian's new best friend. . .and the cat fight is on, with knee slapping results and donkey-braying comedic bliss.

This is not your Aunt Edna's comedy; this film has a decided raunchy edge, from total anarchy on a flight to Vegas, to a food poisoning attack during a dress fitting.  (""It's coming out of me like lava!"" proclaims Melissa McCarthy, part of the bridesmaid ensemble and an unabashed scene stealer.)  If seeing the female gender push the envelope into locker room humor makes you uncomfortable, BRIDESMAIDS is not for you.  Wiig aptly carries the freight, and her genuine chemistry with Rudolph is no doubt a byproduct of their years together on SNL.  You'll feel a twinge of sadness seeing Jill Clayburgh, playing Annie's mom, who died just a few months before the film's release.  One star off for the inevitable ""chick flick"" moments, including a sappy Wilson Phillips sing-a-long, along with an ending that was strangely wanting.  But who cares?  If you're looking for belly laughs by the barrel, BRIDESMAIDS is right down your alley.

4591758,1,B0056IXS7S,"Here's a theory I have, anonymous people of internet-land. You might want to sit down first, because your mind will literally be BLOWN.

Judd Apatow is the M Night Shamalan of Comedy.

Read that sentence again.  Let it sink in. Wait...don't go anywhere! Allow me to explain.

I'm shocked to be uttering (typing) these words, almost as much as you are to be reading them. But the truth is, as I sit here and type this I am officially about forty five minutes into ""Bridesmaids"" and I really haven't laughed once. Not one time. It may be the least funny movie ever made. I say this with out any kind of prejudice. Its not unfunny in the same way that American Pie movies are unfunny, i.e. it insults your intelligence to the point of absurdity. It just isn't funny. All of the jokes are duds. If it were filmed in front of a live studio audience like SNL, you would be hearing crickets.

Have you ever taken a girl on a date to a really bad comedy? A girl you really like and want to show a good time to?  Accept the movie you chose is so god awful that you can literally hear the other people in the audience eating popcorn, slurping down their sodas, texting? Literally doing EVERYTHING accept laughing? Bridesmaids is that movie.

This by itself isn't necessarily all that interesting. Hollywood releases a lot of comedies every year. Some are bad, others are good. What makes this instance so unusual is that literally EVERY SINGLE critic gave Bridesmaids rave reviews. Literally every single one. Don't believe me? Try googling ""bridesmaids"" and ""bad review""....you won't find one. At least not from a reputable critic. There are always bloggers with axes to grind.

What also seems strange is that this is the ten millionth Jude Apatow film to be a comedic vehicle for depression. What I mean by that is, much like ""funny people"" its seems like Apatow is less interested in comedy and more interested in a strange kind of audience manipulation.  Each of his films are really about lovable losers who draw the audience into their conundrums with loads of syrupy sentimentality sprinkled with just enough irreverent irony to neutralize any whiff of cheese.  The problem isn't that the formula doesn't work, but that it does, and too well. Like one of those sappy health insurance commercials you can't help but get whimsical about, Apatow's formula works splendidly until you realize that there is a man behind the curtain, and that nothing is more insincere than over-sentimentality.

That's why Apatow is the M Night of comedy: he can fool you once, but once is one time too many, and afterward you are immune from being fooled again. It's ironic that 'Maids has a running gag about the groups love of a certain Wilson Phillips song...one that appeared in Harold and Kumar six years ago. The Harold and Kumar gag worked well because it was sincere and non ironic. Bridesmaids reference of the song is dripping with irony, the kind of hipster referencing of kitsch 80's cultural artifacts that has become too commonplace but not commonplace enough to trigger a backlash. Its great parity when comparing the two films because they are both about friendship and navigating the world of being an outsider and the outsider's precarious relationship to the opposite sex. It works for harold and kumar because they are genuinely ashamed of liking such a terrible song, yet they go on singing it anyway, unable to help themselves. In Bridesmaids however, the characters celebrate the ironic kitsch, reveling in the so wrong its right-ness of it all. Its the ultimate example of what separates the post-Apatow films from the pre-Apatow ones: if irony is going to be your trump card, you have to know when to play it, and you can't play it every time. Woody Allen has made a career of doing the same comic formula over and over again. He gets away with it because he knows that subtlety is the key when laying the trump card of irony on the table. Apatow has no such talent. He plays the ironic/sentimental/dramedy card over and over and over again. Sooner or later an audience is going to call his bluff.",1333152000,3,4099,4.710893854748603
4591759,5,B0056IXS7S,"As a guy, it's definitely not cool to watch a movie that goes by the name ""Bridesmaids"" but, to my total amazement, the GREAT news is that, not only is the humor intended for *both* guys and girls, but it actually hardly focuses on the wedding itself (until the very end, other than a quick party segment in the middle).

Bridesmaids seriously had several really well-written and laugh out loud segments that never irritate nor feel tacky either.  The storyline focuses around the blonde-haired woman played by Kristen Wiig who stars is many adventures, or rather, MISadventures, haha.  She meets a cop and they fall in love but... well, I wouldn't be so quick to call this ""love"".  More like the cop falls for her but she's too afraid to make an impression when the relationship tries to take a serious turn.  That's one of many elements to this puzzling relationship.

SEVERAL of the laughs come when Kristen's character meets up with all her friends and they unintentionally find themselves caught in situations where things go horribly wrong.  To give a few examples, in one scene they all go out to eat together at a restaurant and afterwards while shopping for wedding clothes, they become violently sick.  This leads to a scene that's best not to spoil not only for the surprise factor, but for the appropriateness of the matter, haha.  You'll CERTAINLY know what I mean when you see how disgusting this particular bathroom segment is!  Another hilarious segment comes during the plane ride when the blonde woman takes drugs and gives the steward and stewardess a hard time.  I like this plane segment in particular for the many layers of depth between ALL the characters.  Many of these jokes qualify as humor done in a subtle way, but it works beautifully.

The storyline is SO well-written in fact, that it manages to keep your attention the entire way through.  The writers did a good job coming up with a script that both men and women can enjoy together, however I do believe some of the jokes are a little too offensive for women (such as one scene where a woman explains how dirty boys become when they reach their teenage years- she doesn't hold anything back).

Other than that, expect a quality storyline, lots of laughs, and well, how can we forget the one woman of the bunch who's rock solid both physically and attitude-wise?  She's actually tied with Kristen Wiig's character for most exciting actress of the group.  All the characters in the film end up fitting the role perfectly as the story unravels.  Highly recommended.",1333152000,,2547,4.763097949886105
4591760,5,B0056IXS7S,"Yes, women can be funny too!  Before this film, it seemed as if the cream of female comedy acting talent was consigned to amusing cameos while the male counterparts stole the show (see collective back catalogues of Messrs Stiller, Pegg and Apatow, the works of Messrs Sandler, James and Green are excluded from this analysis on accounts of good taste). Now with Bridesmaids we have five outstanding female performances, the hilarious and perfectly judged script co-written by Kirsten Wiig (who also stars) the ideal platform to display a wealth of comedic ability.  Please let there be a sequel and soon.

Original review below:

I had no idea how much I would like this movie until I rented it. Then I see that Universal had crippled all the special features on the DVD, making it a rental-only version. The only way to see any extras was to buy the movie. So I liked the movie so much I decided that this was worth the purchase. I don't buy many movies and the ones I do must be worth seeing multiple times.

I quickly order the movie from Amazon only looking for the Blu-ray version and when it arrives I see that it comes with a DVD version and, for a limited time, a digital copy. Awesome. So I open the DVD box to find that the certificate to download the digital movie expired last month, on February 25th 2012. This is a pity because I would have loved to see this movie on my tablet or iPhone or any other place that I could take it with me an enjoy.

So I ask Universal to assist and see if they would assist in getting me a working link to a downloadable copy. Their response?

""Thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately, we have no way to assist you.

The digital copy authorization period for this title has expired, and the digital copy is no longer available.  All Universal digital copy features are available for limited time periods only, with the terms of the offer listed on the outer packaging.""

Ah too late. I missed the expiration date in the item details on Amazon and unfortunately for Universal, these fine print items are very small, printed like a small disclaimer. So now people who paid the same amount that I had, now have three formats and because of Universal's Scrooge-like policies, I have no way of easily getting what I feel I paid for.

Don't get me wrong. I understand coupons expire, but unlike a coupon, I paid for the full product and this only a Universal policy to limit the digital copy download time that has me upset. This is a POLICY and I am a customer, capable of purchasing many other of their products. They should honor that fact, make me a happy customer and allow me to download a copy for myself to enjoy JUST LIKE others have before me who've purchased this movie. A time-limiting a downloadable format is not an incentive for people to buy a movie and it should be honored for any customer of theirs who purchases their products. And face it: it costs them precious little to do this.

Now I am an unhappy customer and will never consider buying another Universal DVD because of their short-sightedness.

The problem I have is with Universal and not with the movie. I loved the movie and do recommend it. I just warn everyone that you will miss out on the portable digital copy of this movie if you buy this disk--and if taking it with you on your portable device is important for you, Universal will not care or extend any courtesy to you, their customer, to provide you any help.

4591766,4,B0056IXS7S,"After all the hype, I was glad to see that the film had many funny parts. However, I did not expect the story of the main character to be so poignant. I laughed and cried throughout the film. My friend observed that this film was superior to male gross-out movies. In those movies, the characters act excessively for no reason. In this film, the main character always tried to do the kind and generous thing but due to her challenging situation, things often backfired.",1332374400,,469,4.595238095238095
4591767,5,B0056IXS7S,"This film makes me laugh!  It had a great story line about best friends and a wedding.  It is heartwarming, funny and ridiculous all at the same time.  The men in the film are funny and Chris O'Dowd plays the perfect boyfriend/foil for Wiig.  The characters are all extremely likable and more or less believable, except for the hyperbole of Jon Hamm, who is every single woman's nightmare of a very bad boyfriend, but you even have to like him, in a perverse way.  Although it focuses on the women and their relationship, it creates a bigger movie than that - and not near as over the top as the ""guy"" movie, Hangover (I & II).  Wiig does a very good job of writing and acting as well and I feel that she has a created a classic while exposing all of the flaws of American wedding  ""traditions"" in present society.  I enjoyed Wiig even more than I have on SNL and see her not only as a woman who can do comedy, but also a talented writer and actress showing a wide range of her talent.

Maybe it was that I saw a blooper reel that was ridiculously funny before the movie came out, and I expected too much.  Or, maybe it was just an unimpressive movie.  The truth is that it doesn't really matter what it is exactly that made Bridesmaids disappointing to me, it just was . . . profoundly.  I'd heard it billed as a female version of The Hangover, and having seen both, I can definitely say that was a steep oversell for Bridesmaids.  Rather than amusing me, the story just made me sad for the people involved.  The acting wasn't exactly inspired.  The music was flat.  And, every fight and joke made me feel like I was back in middle school, watching the cool kids pretend to be all grown up by creating baseless drama and catty quibs.  Overall, I don't plan to watch it ever again, wouldn't recommend it to friends, and can only say that if you're in the mood for some cheap, Hangover knock-off humor that doesn't have even half the punch, and some of the catty girl quibbles that make most people roll their eyes, this is the movie for you.",1331769600,,1128,4.308056872037914

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie though. Yes it is very similar to the hangover for chicks but not the same movie at all. Yes, it is vulgar but I happen to like it when it's done right.

Kristen Wiig steals the show in this, she really hits its home and makes you feel for her character. Melissa McCarthy just comes out of nowhere in this and shocks you, and gets you laughing. Yes I know she's Alan but she's hilarious in this. I love Wendi McLendon-Covey in everything she does, and she's great in this movie. She proves she can go beyond Clementine and still make you laugh. Chris O Dowd is awesome.

The hairless roomie and his sister were a little bit of a distraction and kind of freaky, and the movie is slow at times. The main character isn't incredibly likable but she grows on you after a while.

It was a total disappointment, especially after all the glowing reviews.  There were gross moments but not funny at all and the women characters had no chemistry amongst them.  I found the women characters covered the range of pathetic women stereotypes and did not seem genuine.  I'd expect this kind of writing from male writers but disappointed from female writers.
I know this is not Shakespeare and was not looking for that, but even as an escapist comedy, the sad fact was the movie was not funny! I had to fast forward parts of the DVD as I was so bored, but since I paid for it, felt like I should finish watching it.

Melissa McCarthy is the one sort-of bright spot, and even she goes beyond comedy to just plain gross in too many moments. The character development overall is lacking and the plot is predictable.

This movie has much more heart that you would expect, and although the comedic parts are over the top, there is a ton of truth to this movie as well.  We have a bride caught up in the moment, she is not yet a Bridezilla, but she none the less lets her BFF get pushed aside for a newer (and richer) BFF with much to prove. In the quest for the perfect wedding we have everything from questionable food at a gaucho steakhouse, real toilet humor at the couture bridal salon, a bridal shower with puppies as the goodie bag, and of course forced removal of the entire gang while flying to Vegas.  Needless to say they made it to Vegas, and no, this movie is far from the ""female"" Hangover.

With much being made today about the right to marry, this film provides the answer to why smart couples (no matter who you are), take off on their own and marry at city hall.

All of the characters of the bridal party had well-developed roles with great back stories, lines and personalities. It is easy to imagine any of these characters playing a starring role in a spinoff. I would love to see a movie based on the character of ""Megan,"" for example. One of the best things about this movie is that it isn't mean-spirited. You laugh with, rather than at, the characters.

4591836,1,B0056IXS7S,"I NEVER write reviews on Amazon for movies, however I feel compelled to write this review. There is nothing funny about this film. In fact it's depressing. It should not even be called ""Bridesmaids"" --  it should be called ""Maid of Honor,"" because we never get to know any of the bridesmaids in this movie or learn their stories.

The movie centers on the sad life of a self-absorbed woman (Annie) who is down and out.  But the truth is that Annie creates her own problems and then fails to take responsibility for them. This film's focus is too much on Annie's problems and her lack of reality about how pathetic her life really is.  Look at her! With her sunken dark eyes and dirty, greasy hair, she looks like she just came off a bender in every scene. You just want to yell at the screen, ""Pick yourself up girl and move on with your life!""  There is nothing funny here.

Because Annie is so self-absorbed, she can't even be truly happy for her best friend, Lillian, who is getting married. And even though Annie has been asked to be the maid of honor, she goes out of her way to take all the joy out of her best friend's wedding. The scene that sticks with me most is when another bridesmaid, Helen, gives the bride a trip to Paris; instead of Annie being happy for the bride she implodes and goes nuts at the shower. Is this supposed to be funny? Sad -- that's what this is.

When a good man comes into her life she treats the guy like crap because she is so messed up. Then when she sees what she's lost, we are supposed to think it's funny when she spends an inordinate amount of time trying to say, ""I'm sorry,"" instead of finding out where the bride is (who has gone missing). Again, not funny.

The ""funny,"" if you can call it that, centers on the groom's sister, played by Melissa McCarthy, but she just feels out of place and shoehorned in to provide the comic relief. She tries to save this trash, but she can't.

When the opportunity arises for this movie to hit comic gold via a trip to Vegas, Annie screws that up, too, and we don't even get to Vegas! What a wasted opportunity to flesh out these ""Bridesmaids"" individual characters and provide some true laughs, but again let's face it, this movie is not a comedy no matter what the box cover says.  A hip fun song at the end of the movie doesn't save this mess; are we supposed to forget all that came before?

What's more ironic are the lyrics from the Wilson Philips song blasted at the end of the film. ""You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness, you got yourself into your own mess..."" Are you listening, Annie?

""Bridesmaids"" is an unfunny, depressing, boring film. I expected more.",1328227200,12,2662,4.355555555555555

Apparently she was supposed to be a sympathetic character but she came off as simply a pathetic, whining, self pitying, anorexic jerk. Why on earth would any girl get so bent out of shape by the engagement of a girl who was supposed to be her best friend that she just goes nuts. Or, was she nuts all along and the engagement just pushed her over the edge. It leaves you with the impression that this friendship was the only thing she had and if it was changing then she just had to behave so badly that everyone would notice her instead of the bride. Instead of being happy and supportive of her friend, she made the whole thing about her starting with the way too long scene near the beginning of the movie where she competes with the stepmother in making the toast. And, couldn't they have found a better looking bride.  That girl was just ""plain"". But, the movie was funny and I guess that is what it was meant to be. The scene near the end where she keeps racing her car up and down breaking all kinds of laws trying to make the policeman notice her was too long and annoying also. Contrived is what comes to mind. Halfway through the movie, you simply don't care about this ""heroine"" anymore. You just want her to gain a little weight, get a job, actually care about her friend's happiness and, for the love of Pete, stop whining.  The fat girl was the best thing in the movie.

4591851,2,B0056IXS7S,"Yeah...yeah...yeah... I can hear you.  Moondonkey?  What the heck are you doing watching Bridesmaids???  I know.  But cut me some slack here - my wife got the movie as a gift and wanted to watch it with me.  So I bit the bullet.

It pretty much sucked.  It wasn't the worst movie I've seen - there were some funny parts and we watched it all the way through.  However, the good parts were overshadowed by the overall worthlessness of the film.

The plot it basically this - a spoiled rotten women is getting married and she invites an ""old"" friend and a ""new"" friend to stand up for her in the wedding.  The old friend is the maid of honor.  The film is about how the old and new friend turn the wedding planning and preparation process into a big `ol fight.

There are almost no likeable characters in this film.  The main character is the ""old"" friend who is initially named the maid of honor - I think her name is Annie, but I don't recall.  The chic is psychotic, sleeps with men who treat her like garbage, can't hold down a job, and has no money so she spends most of her time trying to make the wedding as cheap as possible.

On the other side, we have the ""new"" friend - who spends her time trying to prove that she is a better friend to the bride than the old friend.  She is the ""perfect"" girl, while Annie is the ""flawed"" girl.  Blah, blah, blah... In other words, 90% of this film is about the fight between these two selfish and self-destructive nags.

Then we have the bride herself - who is worthless.  She doesn't do much of anything except complain.  And why not really?  Isn't that what we teach women now?  That a wedding is nothing but a license to spoil yourself, overspend, and complain?  What does the groom say about this?  Nothing of course - the dude is barely in the film at all.

There is another bridesmaid who does nothing the entire film but whine about her kids and her husband.  We also have the ""innocent"" bridesmaid - a character with some potential, but she never gets developed.  Her role as the ""innocent"" girl is to listen to stories and get ruined by the ""used up and jaded"" girl.

Finally, there is the ""fat girl"" bridesmaid who plays the part of comedy relief.  I actually thought this was the only good character in the film.

So what does this group of hags accomplish?  Well, nothing really.  They try to have some fun, but the fighting keeps throwing the wheels off the cart.  For example, they decide to fly to Vegas for a party, only to force the plane down early when Annie gets high on medication (which was given to her by her revival - the brides ""new friend).
The next scene takes place on a bus - which I thought was continuing on the Vegas.  Nope!  The got on a bus and turned around and went home.  What the heck?

I've heard a lot of comparison between this film and The Hangover.  Seriously?  The Hangover is a comedy about a bunch of guys having fun.  On the other hand, Bridesmaids is about a group of rotten women who self-destruct and, in the process, screw up the whole wedding planning process as well.

Personally, I think this film would have been much better if the women actually did some things, got in some trouble, had some fun, etc.  Instead, we get a couple hours of personal problems, complaining, and jealousy.  Is this what passes for female entertainment these days?  I thought it was just annoying.

My wife thought that Annie's new love interest was an ok guy - the ""nice guy"" cop who treats her good.  But of course, she blows the relationship up because she is used to being treated like crap so she runs away from a nice guy, etc, etc, etc.  I though the guy was a tool.  Dude - the chic is obviously a head case and you take her back?  What the heck is wrong with you?  The guy deserves what he gets for dating that train wreck.

As a side note, have you noticed that EVERY show about a group of girls is based on a handful of generic models?  The main character is the ""dreamer"" girl, then you have the innocent girl, slutty girl, professional girl, fat girl, etc.  The plot typically involves the characters' problems, insecurities, jealousy, blah...blah...blah.  Every show or movie also ends with a sappy song.",1326931200,,4197,4.367875647668394

4591859,5,B0056IXS7S,"This movie is just plain awesome. 3 stars, people? Really? I honestly don't understand how folks can rank a movie like this, which is obviously well crafted, even if you may not like the brand of humor, a low rating and then give a piece of crap like ""What's Your Number"" a high one. The script, partially by Kirsten Wiig is great here; in some respects your standard comedy plot that you can see coming from a mile away, but in other respects very daring (the main character has to deal with a bout of depression in the middle of the movie, for instance). The directing is by one of the co-writers of the Freaks and Geeks TV show who has also been in the Judd Apatow ""stable"", so that's quality, too.

But what really, really sets this movie apart are the characters. Very rarely does a guy-comedy have a set of characters as nuanced and funny as this one - off the top of my head, I can think of some Apatow/Apatow family movies that reach this: Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the first Hangover movie, and Superbad, for three. But aside from those, which are fantastic in their own right, don't get me wrong, you have to go back to some of the great comedies of all time for this level of characterizaton: American Pie, There's Something About Mary, and Annie Hall are some that come to mind here. It's a wonderful combination of script and actor that gets these roles just exactly right. Maya Rudolph is funny and raunchy without losing her cool-person aura as the bride-to-be, Wendi McClendon-Covey (of Reno 911 fame) is hilarious as the foul-mouthed housewife, and Melissa McCarthy... oh man, Melissa McCarthy. I always liked her in Gilmore Girls but who knew she could not only play off the female Zach Galifinakis role but do it as well as old Zach could? Every single scene she's in elicits a belly laugh.

So I don't want to say that if you dislike the movie you are probably racist against women, but you are. No, seriously, screw what other people say about this. If you're a guy and you like the Judd Apatow series, you will like this movie as well. If you're a girl and wished those movies would have more chicks sharting in them, you will like it as well. If you are a member of the Moral Majority... why are you reading reviews of Bridesmaids in the first place? I'm pretty sure that's a sin.",1326672000,2,2304,4.470308788598575

4591865,3,B0056IXS7S,"For everyone whose life has hit rock bottom, or so they thought, we have Annie (played by Kristen Wiig). Working as a jewelry store clerk after suffering a massive business failure and living with two very, to say the least, eccentric fraternal twins despite being chronically late with the rent. Meanwhile, Lillian her best friend (played by Maya Rudolph) is engaged and to a man she's deeply in love with who makes a great living. And as her beast friend, Lillian enlists Annie to act as her maid of honor at her wedding. It's at the engagement party where Annie first meets Helen Harris (Rose Byrne). Helen's husband employs Lillian's fiance and has become strangely close to her as a result.

  The other bridesmaids provide little more than comic relief while Helen, who plans on the order of a Martha Stewart clone on steroids, is the antagonist as she seems intent on usurping Annie's role as maid of honor and Lillian's best friend which, given Lillian's impending change of address, appears to be a position that will be vacant soon enough. During all this, Annie's romantic life is complicated by a waning entanglement with a man whose interest in her is mainly physical and a relationship with kind and respectful police officer whom she met thanks to a long-broken taillight.

  The story isn't all that interesting and the fact that only the audience sees things from Annie's point if view is near infuriating, in my opinion. That said, Wiig, Rudolph, Byrne and company are hilarious as the events depicted, though some seem meant to make the viewers cringe or test their gag reflex which runs counter to my personal taste.

4591887,3,B0056IXS7S,"For starters, Bridesmaids is produced by Judd Apatow, so you know it's going to be raunchy.  Nothing wrong with that--the dress shop scene has some of the funniest moments I've seen in a while.  But its comedy works against it at times.  Annie's bit in the airplane is evidently supposed to be funny, but she's in such a sad place in her life that her antics only left me feeling sorry for her.  It's kind of like meeting someone on the bus who has an obvious disability or speech impediment.  You want to help them, but can't.  What might be funny from someone who's otherwise in control of their life (say a drunken night on the town) suddenly turns to sad when that control isn't there.  It's similar to someone who laughs hysterically at something that's not funny--you wonder what's wrong with them, and likely feel a pang of sympathy.

Annie's like this throughout the entire movie.  You want her to take a deep breath, realize that she has something to offer the world, and really try to look beyond her first impressions of people.  Nobody is really quite what they show to the rest of the world.  In Helen's case, a seemingly perfect life is only a mask for her own insecurities.  The opposite is true of Megan, who adopts nine dogs, but turns out to have adjusted very well to her situation in life.  What's truly sad about Annie is that she doesn't have the emotional intelligence at 40 to say ""Stop--how do I really feel about this wedding?  What does it say about me?  If I've always turned to my best friend before, who can I turn to now to talk about this?""  Instead, she just backs herself into a corner until she alienates everyone she cares about.

4591889,4,B0056IXS7S,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my fiance, who saw it in the theaters, and I loved this almost as much as she did!  The movie is a tremendously funny look at getting ready for a wedding from the perspective of a less-than-perfect Bridesmaid.  It mixes in some very funny jokes and moments that could take place anywhere with some really outrageous and funny moments that have to be seen to be believed.  The nice thing about this is, like the first ""Hangover"" movie, while the moments are over the top (such as the food poisoning scene in the bridal shop), none of them really seem out of place or forced, which is a tough thing to pull off in a comedy.

Kristen Wiig is fantastic as the old friend who feels like she's getting pushed aside by the new friend who seems to have it all.  She's obviously got a lot of issues of her own to work through already, and you can see this as the straw that breaks the camel's back.  She's desperate for the love and attention of someone, and her reactions to not gettting it range from the mild to the hysterical!  The nice thing about the performance, though, is that you never feel like Wiig is screaming for the attention.  Rather, you feel like she keeps getting the short-end of the stick from everyone, whether it's her creepy British roommates, the guy she's sleeping with but who won't commit (played by a very funny Jon Hamm in an uncredited role) or the bridesmaid who's trying to steal her best friend.

The rest of the cast is just as good.  Maya Rudolph is very good and very restrained as the bride-to-be who is struggling to make everyone happy.  Chris O'Dowd is slightly awkward (in a good way) and sweet as a cop who is trying to develop something with Kristen Wiig.  And Melissa McCarthy is hilarious as the sister of the groom and the one who seems to understand the best what Wiig is going through.

I only have two issues with the movie that keep it from getting five stars.  First, there should have been a little more development of the other two bridesmaids' characters, as I thought they were just as funny as any other character in the movie.  Also, some of the gags dragged on for too long (such as when Wiig is trying to get pulled over).

Overall, though, the movie is very funny and very sweet at the same time.  The end is perfectly done and refrains from going in the totally obvious direction that so many other movies like it would.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.",1325808000,,2457,4.398230088495575

4591893,4,B0056IXS7S,"I just watched the movie Bridesmaids on DVD and was pleasantly surprised! Enough so that I came here looking to purchase it. Many reviewers complain about it not living up to the hype, I'd say it earned about half. It should also not be compared to movies like the Hangover. Yes, it is supposed to be a comedy. And yes, it can be raunchy, but in the end it's still a film for the girls. Not the gooey romantic or cutesy/fun kind. Not the tissue-inducing kind either. But, more of an off-beat, slightly raunchy, sincere kind.

I'd like to think of it as honest chick flick comedy. There are definitely scenes where things get taken over the top, but the dialogue keeps it engaging and real. The characters are quirky and personable(Melissa McCarthy for sure!). And I felt like I could relate and empathize with most of the women.

Lillian outgrew Annie a long time ago and I think the movie would have been more realistic if they'd realized that and Annie was not part of the wedding at the end.

Rather than showing that ""women can do comedy"", Bridesmaids instead ends up saying ""women comedians can be as gross as men...but not as funny."" It was the movie let-down of 2011 for us. The unsympathetic characters leave you with no one to root for, adrift for 2 hours waiting for it to end. There were long stretches that were more painful than funny, and it jumped from storyline to storyline with little coherence at all. That said, it does have a few funny quips that I am sure can be gleaned from imdb.com without giving up $4 or 2 hours of your life.

4591919,2,B0056IXS7S,"Why do comedy writers believe they have to write in so many swear words in their script to make their movie funny?

Bridesmaids had one redeeming value and it was not the script, the women or the humor.

What happens when two best friends are divided because of a woman with money? You get the plot for Bridesmaids. Lillian is getting married, her best friend Annie is supposed to plan her party and all the fun. Unfortunately everything Annie plans fails. Enter Helen to the rescue. Her money will buy all kinds of love. Including a bridal shower in which the guests go home with puppies as party favors.

Touted as the year's funniest movie, but I didn't laugh once.

Even when they try to devolve to bathroom humor with food poisoning puke and diarrhea, this movie barely registers on the funny meter.

As I said, the only redeeming value for this movie comes in the form of the loveable police officer played by Chris O'Dowd. (From tv's The I.T. Crowd) He is a breath of fresh air in this putrid calamity.

I was thoroughly entertained by the film, but comedies don't usually fare well at awards time. Kirstin Wiig is definitely a force of nature; co-writer and star of the manic romp that pushes the envelope in many ways. A fine ensemble cast mainly features 4 actresses: Wiig, Rudolph, Byrne & McCarthy. All are fine. The DVD I watched had no extras, which is a drag, because I wanted to know more about how director Paul Feig put it all together with such precision.

Unless you're a complete curmudgeon, I don't know how you won't be entertained by this film about how regular people like you and I show their vulnerability and humanness. Kick back, enjoy...",1324598400,,738,4.811023622047244

I do not however feel like it was a total waste of time, there were a few scenes that made me and my husband laugh pretty hard.

The pacing of the movie was a bit of a problem for me, every so often (much like SNL or Mad TV) there is a joke that just isn't that funny and goes on for way too long.

4591981,5,B0056IXS7S,"This is one of those movies that has received such exceptional praise and a particular comparison to being a female version of THE HANGOVER that most people have high already set expectations before viewing this movie.  I did not see this in the theater and was filled with anticipation to watch the blu ray.  I love most of the women here and was not let down at all.  Funny though, after all the hype, it was not anything what I expected.  The comparison to THE HANGOVER?  This film involves a roadtrip but differs greatly for it is a comedy with heart.  Kristen Wiig is the true headliner here and she carries this film from beginning to end.  She provides many of the greatest laughs but her character also provides the true heart and emotion to this film.  Yes, it is a laughfest comedy with humor that is sometimes a little gross but under all that is a heartfelt story.  Maya Rudolph also provides heart to this film.  For the comedic part of the film the greatest performance is given by Melissa McCarthy.  This is a huge breakout performance for her.  If you aren't too happy after your first viewing of this film I highly suggest ginving it another viewing without expectation.  You will then see the many layers that make this film a huge success.

The blu ray comes with the theatrical version as well as the unrated version.  The video is amazing and colors pop while fleshtones are realistic and lovely.  Black/white ration is excellent and the picture just jumps off the screen with a vibrant crispness.  And the clarity shows every detail in every frame to great detail.  The audio is also excellent.  Dialogue is always present and clear and when music comes the surround speakers are put to great use.  This film honestly shows blu ray at its best.  And the blu ray edition also has hours of amazing extras that are not on the dvds.  I highly recommend this film.  It is an amazing comedy with an all female cast that will have you in stitches.  But try to forget the hype and try to not have any expectations for this film is different and better than it is being described.

It is not always buoyant but it is certainly filled with vivacity.

This has to be one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Now I am pretty intelligent and not by any means a 'bottom feeder' and I think that sometimes you just have to let it all hang out. And in this frisky, frolicking movie the characters certainly do. My husband claims the bridemaids acted much like they do in real life with the squabbles and fights. I must say that the character Megan played by Melissa McCarthy was absolutely so great it was beyond wonderful. Some of her lines like the loaded gun in the carry-on bag were too funny.

The Bridesmaids was cute at times but I mainly felt really uncomfortable watching a ""mature"" (as in older) woman totally humiliate herself over and over again (Kristen Wiigs character).  If she were a teenager or young adult I could see more humor to her character but as it was it was like watching someone's mom have several nervous breakdowns on screen.  Awkward and ""ewwww"".  Kristen Wiig just isn't charismatic. I also didn't think this movie was very clever.  More like embarrassing and sad. I like movies to surprise me.  I like original humor and there is little of that in The Bridesmaids.  The best part of this lamefest was Melissa McCarthy (who stole all the dogs and badgered the cute little guy on the plane into a relationship).  She was awesome! If Hollywood made a movie about her character I might actually spend money to see the film.  The Irish cop was also a pleasant surprise.  He wasn't Hollywood hunk material which was refreshing.  He was just a sweet, normal, average guy with a good heart and a good sense of humor.  I didn't understand what his character saw in Kristen Wiig's shallow, one dimensional self-pitying character except that he felt sorry for her or wanted to rescue her or something.

4592003,5,B0056IXS7S,"I literally laughed aloud for most of the movie and haven't laughed that hard since I saw 'Tommy Boy' for the first time way back when.

Brides Maids is a funny movie that really breaks the mold. In fact, I didn't want to watch it because of the title alone, as much as I've always liked Wiig. The title is reminicent of all those wedding related 'comedies' we've seen before: Best Friend's Wedding, 27 Dresses, and on and on. But the fact of the matter this really isn't a wedding movie at all (thank heavens). the wedding is just a vehicle to show the interaction between two good friends and all the craziness between them that makes a woman's life an intricate thing.

Brides Maids is funny on several levels, which probably explains its' broad appeal. There's the easy gross out humor (the food poisoning scenes are painfully funny) but then there are subtle things like Wiigs' car (could a crappier car be found?), her failed cake store renamed by vandals (baby c*k s) and driving 'exposed' (but not completely) that show how much thought went into every sight gag, every line and every setup/punchline. What makes it better is that it's an ensemble piece where every actor hits it out of the park every time. Even the 'Air Marshall', who has only a few lines, pulls them off with knock out funny timing and attitude.

Bridesmaids is undoubtedly the funniest 'all-girl' comedy I've ever seen and can stand toe-to-toe against any classic comedy out there.",1323129600,,1460,4.6953125
4592004,1,B0056IXS7S,"I consider myself a fan of ""low brow"" humor.  Don't get me wrong, I love my smart and witty humor ala Woody Allen.  However, I have no problem switching over to crude jokes and physical pratfalls to grace a smile and to induce chuckles.  I really enjoyed ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Horrible Bosses"", hell I still think ""Dumb & Dumber"" is hysterical.  With that being said, I was eager to watch ""Bridesmaids"" since I had heard only great things about it. Well after watching it the only word I can conjure to state my reaction to this film is ""disappointment"".

The movie is about a thirty something woman named Annie (Kristen Wig) who is the maid of honor at her best friend Lillian's (Maya Rudolph) wedding.  Annie and Lillian have been friends forever and as of recent their lives have taken different paths.  Lillian has attained a new gal pal Helen (Rose Byrne) and it appears that Annie doesn't really care for Lillian's new friend(s) and new life.  Now take the character of Annie and add some self loathing, neurotic tendencies, callow behavior and absolutely no regard for anyone else and you have the movie in a nut shell.

What destroyed this movie for me was the character of Annie.  I found her to be utterly unsympathetic, self-centered, annoying and instigator of her own misery.  A perfect example is the scene involving her and the cop (Chris O'Dowd) and baking supplies.  I am not sure what Kristen Wig was attempting to do with this role, but I couldn't stand the performance.

For a movie called ""Bridesmaids"", there really wasn't that much interaction between them.  I was told this was the women's version of ""The Hangover"".  I don't know about that.  ""The Hangover"" was alright, a bit overrated in my humble opinion, but at least there was interaction with the guys in that movie.  In ""Bridesmaids"" it is some interaction with the ladies, Annie being an emotional train wreck, Helen and Annie fighting over Lillian's affection.

To be objective, I will say there were a couple funny parts in the movie.  I really liked the scene where everyone became ill while trying on the dresses.  There were also a few funny one liners that also made me laugh.  However, these few moments were overshadowed by forced humor or things that weren't funny at all.  A perfect example was when Annie and Helen kept fighting over the microphone when they were doing their toast for Lillian.  This was one of the longest scenes I have seen in a recent film.  Actually the movie was way too long.  It ran just over two hours and again more than half of it was Annie's pity party. Not to mention there was no atonement or redemption of her character.

I watched this movie with my wife and she hated it too.  It was actually a chore to sit through the entire film.  We kept looking at time to see how much time was remaining. Notwithstanding, this film did very well critically and financially.  I was also told by numerous people how amazing it was.  I still think Annie would be a great paradigm for abnormal psychology.",1323129600,32,3028,4.647834274952919

4592012,3,B0056IXS7S,"I finished watching ""Bridesmaids"" last night, and if you were to ask me then if I would review this movie, I probably would have said, ""No"".  But even 24 hours after watching, I find myself still thinking about the themes and messages in ""Bridesmaids"" and am compelled to share this.

NOTE: Possible spoilers!!

""Bridesmaids"" is the story of Annie, a woman who has apparently hit rock-bottom.  She lost her bakery shop and is forced to take a boring job as a jewelry sales clerk, meanwhile living with two crazy youngsters and being literally and figuratively ""screwed"" by her hot f-buddy, Ted.  Her childhood and best friend, Lilian, is getting married and this unleashes a whole new world of pain for Annie.

I got the impression, from trailers and rumors, that this would be a rip-roaring, laugh-out-loud, gut-splitting comedy about the bridesmaids in a wedding.  Maybe for some it is (particularly if those ""some"" don't mind bathroom or obscene humor), but what stuck with me more was the message.

Annie lives a lackluster life and does nothing to help herself.  Instead, she wallows in self-pity, complaining and offloading to her long-suffering friend.  When Lilian gets engaged to Dougie, Annie begins to realize that she is, in a way, losing her friend.  At the engagement party, she meets yet another competition for Lilian's attention, the over-achieving, attention-seeking, super-organized Helen, wife of Dougie's boss.  Annie immediately becomes jealous of Helen and thus begins her descent to truly ""rock bottom"".

I am struck most by how much Annie is ""every woman/man"".  Who hasn't wallowed in self-pity, stayed in a dead-end job, kept being around people who take advantage of you?  Annie's journey in this movie--from clawing to keep Lilian's slackening attention on her to self-annihilating her relationship with an amazing, caring guy in the form of Officer Nathan Rhodes--is one we can all relate to.

This movie was billed as a goofy comedy centering around bridesmaids, but really, that isn't the story we see here.  The actual bridesmaids make far too few appearances (and in the case of Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper, it is truly a shame--I would have loved to have seen more about both women).  The humor ranges from witty and sharp to bathroom humor to obscene, with some jokes (such as the Annie-Helen vying to out-speech each other at Lilian's engagement party and the scene where Annie attempts to get Officer Rhodes attention by driving by doing various illegal things) going on far too long (no one seriously thought to take the microphone away from Annie or Helen?  How much time did Annie waste trying to get Officer Rhodes attention when she could have been scouring likely places for Lilian?).

Some people say this movie makes it seem like Annie's life only improves when a man enters her life.  For once, I would like to counter that.  Annie's life does not get better upon meeting Rhodes; it is only when she is faced with a friend, in what I consider to be the best scene in the movie, does her life turn around.

To elaborate: Annie, unemployed and homeless, is wasting away in her mother's house, watching ""Castaways"".  Megan, played to perfection by Melissa McCarthy, enters and chastises Annie for not answering Megan's calls.  Annie starts to whine about her life and not having friends when Megan counters (paraphrased), ""You are whining about not having friends, but here I am.""  Megan then begins to poke and prod and wrestle with Annie, trying to get Annie to fight back and stop taking her crappy life, until Annie finally gets annoyed and slaps back.  It is at this moment that Annie's life begins to turn around; not when she meets Rhodes, not when they consummate their relationship, but when a friend forces Annie to take a good long look at her life and decide to fight back.

While Annie was a relatable ""every woman/man"", I still found her obnoxious (or perhaps that is me finding my inner wimp obnoxious).  Lilian was a good friend, but even she had her trigger-point and didn't let Annie get away with all her stupid antics.  Megan was one of the best aspects of the movie; sure, her humor tended to be crude and obscene, but, as I said above, her scene with Annie was the best in the movie.  I was most impressed with Helen; our protagonist assumes Helen is just a rich biotch, but Helen isn't.  She is married to a man who is rarely with her, living with her step-children who yell profanities at her.  She has no female friends--possibly because other woman of her class are so backbiting, possibly because woman are intimidated by her beauty or annoyed by her Martha Stewart perfection.  The only woman to be able to tolerate her even minutely is Lilian.  (Of course, self-centered Annie cannot see this at the beginning of the movie.)  Officer Rhodes is a great guy who has been stereotyped by Annie's bad relations with men.  Ted seems abnormally insensitive (calling Annie a ""f-buddy"" in front of a cop when he goes to pick her up off the side of the road seems a little, um, rude), but sometimes things have to be super-obvious in order for us to see them.

The naming of this movie seems rather peculiar, as it deals more with the maid of honor and her troubles than the bridesmaids as a whole.  Perhaps ""Maid of Honor"" was too long or too close to another movie, which is why ""Bridesmaids"" was chosen instead.

I know I've been long-winded and rambling, so I'll wrap up.  ""Bridesmaids"" is truly a thought-provoking movie, something I hadn't expected.  Instead of busting a gut over some crazy joke, I found myself thinking more and more about life and friends and self-respect.  This movie won't be for everyone--Annie can be obnoxious, the humor isn't for everyone--but for those that don't mind the caveats, there is a really intriguing movie to be found.

4592013,5,B0056IXS7S,I got the DVD of this movie.  I like to watch all the extras so I should have gotten the blue-ray because it said it has more extras.  The DVD has extras but I always want more.  Can't get enought of this move it was so funny.,1322870400,,226,3.765957446808511
4592014,4,B0056IXS7S,"I had some misgivings when I ordered this. I was afraid that it would not live up to its hype, a malady that seems to afflict so many films of this genre. I can't say it was a great film, but it had some truly great comedic moments. It started out dragging and un-funny, then enter Melissa McCarthy!! You could almost count on any scene with her to be a sweet bit of comedy. The delivery of her lines proves that she has unequaled comedic timing, and it was when she came on screen that the movie turned around.

 The film has 1 major flaw: it seemed that no one told Kristen Wiig that this was a comedy, so the film seemed to lurch along at times, trying to decide if it was a comedy or a drama, while Kristen Wiig opted to portray Annie as a hyper-excitable and manic Tina Fey SNL character. It didn't work for me. Characters were painted with too broad a stroke and there was very little character development.  McCarthy took a part that could have been played as a buffoon and turned it into the part that 'stole the show'. Unfortunately, at times it seemed that Paul Feig (the director) seemed to be cowed by Kristen Wiig's role as co-producer and was unable to control Kristen Wiig the actor

That said, this was truly a funny movie. I rarely laugh out loud at comedies, but this movie had me laughing as hard as I have ever laughed. It is definitely worth watching this if you crave an evening of laughter. I bought the disc and am glad I did. I expect to watch this many more times.

Not quite The Hangover funny, but funny.  As a girl, I also found it strangely accurate about how crazy people can get during weddings.  That thing with one bridesmaid trying to supplant the maid of honor?  Happened at my last wedding.

4592019,5,B0056IXS7S,"...so there. I was suprised to see that this release had so many negative reviews. I really liked it, even though maybe my judgement was tarnished because I watched it with a horde of cackling women. (I am a man...technically)

I think the main one (Kirstin Wiig) is particulalry adorable, and bears the rare gift of being hilarious and indeed female. Hell, even her name makes me lol like there's no tomorrow! She is a great comic actress of the old school, and does provide many laugh out loud moments during the film.

Maybe it's too coarse for some? Wouldnt have thought so in this day and age though. Street defecation, repulsive sexual fetishes and coarse language (even the C word lmao) all abound in this film so not your average chick-flick. Viewer discretion should be advised!

The casting is inspired,they got some quality British actors like the guy from IT crowd and the fat bald one who looks like an egg but upside down from Little Britain, and was fun to see Jon 'the ham' Hamm in a more comedic role than his usual sultry one. Pretty much the entire cast provided gigglesworthy moments at some point.

So don't listen to anyone else's reviews. What do they know?

And they don't love you like I do.

Because of some potty humor themed scenes, I would definitely consider this movie an untraditional approach to women's comedy. But don't let that scare you away! The dialog and wit of the characters more than makes up for those scenes. Besides some very silly scenes that will make you smile, there is more depth to this movie because of some honest character development in the women. One theme in particular that stood out to me, *spoiler?* was that one of the characters struggled with low self-esteem and had a tendency to be attracted to unavailable men and sabotage relationships with good men. This is a realistic situation that is not addressed in many movies, and I think it is good for young women to have some insight into this behavior if they are stuck in the same low self-esteem rut.",1322524800,3,941,4.57396449704142

Real women don't talk that way, especially at an engagement party. Our daughter watched the whole thing, and she didn't like it either.

Melissa McCarthy delivers the performance of probably I think the best character in the whole movie, however the entire film is filled with strong comedic women who are great actresses.

The girls from Mad TV, Saturday Night Live are just so good at comedy, this film had no hope of dissappointment. Add ""Megan"" to the list and some great bit parts by ""Rodes"" the Irish love intrest and ""John the Air Marshall"" provide some great dimensions to this cracking comedy.
The plot is hardly important, the script, casting and physical comedy are done perfectly. Kristen Wiig is just perfect as Kate, the ""Maid of honour' in this flick. ""Megan"" steals the show with many great scenes and one liners and a great effort by Rose Byrne as the beautiful nemesis.

main story: a woman is simply getting married and her best friend aka maid of honor starts getting jealous of another friend of the bride she never met because she (the bride) seems really close with her. this so called friend is pretty malicious towards the best friend, trying to get in the way and take her place, but the bride doesn't realize that. the main character is the MOH and there are other things going on in the side. like the MOH has men problems but meets a cute cop. the main plot overall is about friendship i think, and how things can be handled in different ways than usual.",1321920000,2,1092,4.107476635514018

I watched it twice. Parts of it are funny, but the overall movie left me feeling a bit let down. I felt as if this movie were being directed towards a completely different group of people--primarily college-age and younger who might find the subjects of bodily misfunctions humorous.

Parts that I found charming were Chris O'Dowd as Officer Nathan Rhodes. Kristen Wiig's writing is clever and her characterization of a self-centered woman who learns to take self-responsibility was well done. I did enjoy the friendship between she and Lillian as well. The characterization of Helen as the upstaging friend was intriuging, but the writing for that character was simply flat for me.

I use the word ""performer"" to describe Kristen Wiig's job skills because the titles ""actress"" and ""comedian"" are typically reserved for those who can actually act or for those who are actually funny.  Wiig certainly does not fit into either of those two categories.

""Bridesmaids"" has the honor of being listed in my top five worst movies of all time list.

I let it drag on and on because I'm not a fan chick flicks so to speak.  I thought, ""Oh another movie about a bunch of women pining over some fairy tale with lame cliches.""  Boy was I wrong, this movie is the equivalent to ""The Hangover"" except its with women.  Thus proving that women can be equally fraternizing, comedic and intoxicated as the fellas in ""The Hangover"".  Kristen Wiig plays the protagonist Annie with a fantastic performance that takes you back to the Lucille Ball slapstick days, but put here today in modern times.  I almost want to go out on a limb and say that this may be more of a film for guys.  Never mind that it's all women in the leads of the film, don't let that turn you off guys, as the humor is downright crude, almost repulsive and crass.  Women who are seeing this hoping for a sweet, romantic love story will be sorely disappointed and maybe even turned off.  This isn't to stereotype men and women as I'm simply generalizing that the Bridesmaids title with all female leads can suggest to someone this is another kind of film.  It most definitely is not.  I highly recommend this and in fact make it a double feature one night with a group of friends and watch, ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" in one sitting and get the best of both worlds.",1321660800,2,1453,4.301470588235294

4592074,5,B0056IXS7S,"Bridesmaids is a rare breed of comedy, one that provides the raunchy, gross-out laughs of a guy buddy film like The Hangover & Wedding Crashers, but one with a heart.  The film focuses on the downward spiral of Annie (Kristen Wiig) as her best friend Lil (Maya Rudolph) plans her wedding and names Annie as maid-of-honor.  Annie had a bakery that tanked and now she is forced to work at a jewelry store and live with an extremely creepy British brother & sister in a cramped apartment.  She degrades herself by sleeping with Ted (Jon Hamm) who is more than upfront about the relationship being just about hooking up.  In the meantime, she gets into a competition with Lil's new friend Helen (Rose Byrne) on who is really Lil's best friend and running the wedding.  Along the way she falls for an Irish cop Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) with whom she can't really commit.  Lil's future sister-in-law Megan (Melissa McCarthy) adds the most comedic relief as an in your face, over sexed woman who seduces an undercover air marshal on an aborted trip to Las Vegas.  While Ms. McCarthy has been garnering much deserved praise for her portrayal of Megan, it is Ms. Wiig who is the heart & soul of the film.  Watching Annie slide further and further into depression and misery could be painful, but Ms. Wiig handles it with just the right touch to where you feel sorry for Annie but she stops short of becoming completely pitiful.  There a far too numerous hysterical scenes to detail, although the trip to an exclusive bridal shop stands out.  Suffice to say, Bridesmaids will make you laugh, maybe even cry and you will have enjoyed the two plus hours of the film.",1321574400,2,1651,4.623287671232877
4592075,1,B0056IXS7S,"When a person wallows in self-pity after being chosen maid of honor for her closest friend's wedding because another of the chosen bridesmaids is wealthier, better adjusted, appears to have grown closer to the bride, and over-the-top extravagant in her prenuptial celebrations, one may be inclined to show some sympathy.  When that same person allows herself to repeatedly be used and then discarded, erupts into a jealous and destructive rage at bridal shower, rejects a decent man who really does like her and proves beneficial, and desperately attempts to suppress the joy of happy customers while working as a saleswoman in a jewelry store, reactions more likely range from wanting to slap her and tell her to get over herself, to strongly suggesting that she seek immediate psychiatric help.  So is the protagonist of Bridesmaids.

While billed as a comedy, its overall tone is a bit sad: a woman whose business has failed, cannot seem to succeed in a relationship herself, and has been forced to move back home with her mother begins to come unglued as her best friend approaches her wedding. Sure, there are some mildly humorous episodes: the eccentric mother who has never had a drink but attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings because she finds them inspirational, the vacuous roommate who gets an atrocious tattoo because it is free, the competitive toasting between the protagonist and her adversary.  But these minor episodes are overshadowed by an overall tone that is not very happy, a plot that is not particularly interesting, and a protagonist that is not all that likeable.  Add to that the horrendous bridal shop scene, in which the viewer is treated to both vomit and defecation, and one has, well, a dud.

If one wishes to see a romance about a likeable but dispirited woman who finds some manages to persevere and find some pleasant romantic joy in her life, see Bridget Jones' Diary.  If one wants to see pure comedy, watch Seinfeld re-runs.  Bridesmaids is successful as neither a comedy nor a romance.",1321401600,26,2025,4.970414201183432
4592076,4,B0056IXS7S,"Like many people, I was driven to rent this movie after hearing rave reviews. It was not what I expected (constant, slapstick comedy), but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. If you've ever been a bride, a bridesmaid or a maid of honor, you can probably relate to most of the humor in this film that has clearly been written by (and to an extent for) women. I would caution that the bulk of the main character's storyline is probably more relevant to viewers in their mid-twenties and older.

A lot of the disappointed reviews share the same theme - they weren't anticipating the downward-spiral situation Kristen Wiig's character experiences throughout the movie. I'm not a particular fan of cringe-worthy embarrassing moments, but I found these fairly tolerable because those that weren't realistic were funny, those that were realistic I could somewhat relate to, and the rest simply weren't bad enough (though yes, you may have the urge to yell at Kristen Wiig to 'snap out of it') to ruin the whole movie for me.

The only real chuckle came at the expense of fart and poop jokes in the dress fittng scene - and I have nothing against said jokes!

I must say i don't know why, it just dragged on. I just couldn't get into it, as a chick flick is was unconvincing, sure as hell was not funny (meant to be a comedy), most of it is boring and uncomfortable to watch. save your time and money on a better film.",1320537600,15,390,3.8875

4592098,1,B0056IXS7S,"I was genuinely looking forward to this movie since it had so many excellent reviews by both friends and critics.  I was shocked at how painfully bad it was, and I can't comprehend what could possibly be likeable about this trash.  As in many formula rom-coms, the women characters live only for the day they find a man to rescue them and make their sad, pathetic lives worth living.  They have no worth or redeeming qualities of their own.  They have no interest in doing anything except finding a man although they are mysteriously able to afford affluent lifestyles despite the fact that they appear to have no talents.  The main character in this movie is so pathetic, whiny, and weak that I had no sympathy for her and didn't care what happened to her.

As for the humor itself, most of it was so painfully overdone that it was almost awkward to watch. One example is during the engagement party when the main character and another bridesmaid try to upstage each other by continually taking the microphone back and forth from one another to make gushing speeches to the bride.  It's mildly amusing for about a minute, but then it keeps going, and going, and going.  I understand the suspension of disbelief, but the jokes in this movie were so over-the-top that any logic at all ceased to function.  There is also a good deal of bathroom humor, which I guess is somehow incorporated into the movie as some sort of ""feminist"" statement that women can laugh at fart and vomit too.  I have nothing against bathroom humor, but again, it was so over-the-top that the jokes were ruined.

The women in this movie are so utterly shallow, catty, and unlikeable that I cannot imagine how anyone could find their behavior even watchable, much less funny.  Why do women take these roles?  There are romantic comedies out their that treat their characters with respect and although their plots may be a bit far-fetched, their humor and charm is enough to make them enjoyable (When Harry Met Sally comes to mind).  Unfortunately, like its miserable, worthless characters, ""Bridesmaids"" lacks any of these redeeming qualities.",1320537600,54,2116,4.777472527472527

But if you wait until everyone tells you: ""You gotta see this move- it's hilarious!"" you're going to be disappointed.  And that was just what happened with Bridesmaids.  I thought it was okay, but I didn't understand what everyone was talking about.  The female version of The Hangover?  I thought THAT movie was comic-gold (and that kind of proved my point- I saw it when it JUST came out in the theatres).  So, if you're expecting a rip-roaring, send you into hysteric laughter...

There were a few moments that brought a chuckle, but as with much of Kristen Wiig's writing, the jokes were forced and generally, not funny.

4592113,4,B0056IXS7S,"SNL alum Kristen Wiig co-wrote and stars in this raunchy comedy all about the ladies.  Much has been made of the fact that this film is for the girls what the celebrated Judd Apatow movies are for the boys.  It's true.  In fact Apatow is a producer.  While there is plenty of in-your-face humor related to sex and bathroom mishaps, the best stuff is more subtle and will produce chuckles rather than guffaws.  In fact, the two 20 year old dudes sitting behind me at a theater viewing clearly didn't get the jokes.  Wiig is terrific as the best friend of the bride (Maya Rudolph) who has found a new friend who wants to control everything.  She's played by Rose Byrne as you've never seen here before...damn funny.  While everyone has their moments, the best character is chubby Megan, the sister of the groom and played with great vigor by Melissa McCarthy.  I could have done without the vomit and diarrhea scene as the ladies were trying on dresses, but hell I was laughing.  While the movie is no doubt a comedy, there is some touching moments when Annie (Wiig) hits the bottom.  The movie should also be noted for being Jill Clayburgh's last film.  She plays Annie's mom.",1320192000,,1175,4.569377990430622

Third, she kept nagging in car how the bridemaid was trying be prettier than her with big ball gown, smh... she should let it go! But instead she ran so fast passing light, causing trouble with law.

4592120,1,B0056IXS7S,"For the life of me, I don't understand all the hype about this stinker. This movie was really, really bad. It appears to me that people these days have humor confused with anxiety, foul language, and disgusting behavior that will make one physically ill. It's difficult to find a movie that contains true, witty humor. If great written humor is what you're looking for in a comedy, keep looking. You won't find it in ""Bridesmaids"". On the other hand, if you think food poisoning, diarrhea, graphic vomiting, extreme anxiety bordering on psychotic behavior, and rude, crude, foul language is funny, you'll think this movie is hilarious. I was either bored to tears, perplexed and shocked by the behavior and dialogue, completely grossed out and sickened, or offended by the terrible language. As a matter of fact, about 15 minutes into the movie, I picked up a nearby book I had been reading earlier, and started reading where I had left off. Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with adult situations and adult language in a movie. However, this movie went way overboard with the offensive language. It also went way overboard with a food poisoning scene involving pretty well every main character in the movie with the graphic results of eating some tainted food. It seemed like this disgusting part of the movie would never end. It went on and on...or so it seemed. I hated what the film did to the character played by Melissa McCarthy (Molly of ""Mike and Molly""). Maybe some people think a disgusting, foul mouthed, promiscuous, vomit spewing pig is funny. Personally, I found that her character took offensiveness to a whole new level. In fact, I pretty well found the entire movie did that. My girlfriend and I rented ""Bridesmaids"" and the Kevin James movie, ""Zookeeper"" on the same evening. We watched ""Bridesmaids"" first, followed by ""Zookeeper"". Thank goodness we watched these movies in that order. While I would rate ""Zookeeper"" with 3 stars, it certainly provided some desperately needed comedy relief after we had just been exposed to such a disgusting, trashy movie which had left us completely offended, grossed out, and shaking our heads as we tried to figure out where the funny parts were supposed to have been with ""Bridesmaids"". If we had been watching ""Bridesmaids"" in a theater, I have no doubt we would have walked out on it. Fortunately, this lesson only cost me a buck at a nearby Redbox.",1320019200,5,2413,4.845036319612591

4592124,5,B0056IXS7S,"I completely loved this movie. I had heard so much about the gross-out humor, and 'women behaving badly' themes, that I was expecting this to almost be a female Hangover. But it's not at all - the core story is much more soulful, and it's really a kind of romantic comedy, but the focus is on Kristin Wiig's character, as opposed to a man. It's a nice counterbalance to all the male-centric movies out there. There is one gross-out scene, and I did wince and cover my eyes at that, but some people like that humor, and so why not have women doing it for a change (we have bodily functions too after all!!) All of the female leads were outstanding, and the 'real-life' friendship between Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig shines through as the centerpiece of the plot in this one. And for what it's worth, my husband liked it too - it's not just a chick flick.",1319932800,,855,4.383647798742138

4592126,2,B0056IXS7S,"I was expecting this to be an ensemble comedy, something like a female version of Wedding Crashers.  It's not -- at all -- which is unfortunate.

It's actually a movie about Kristen Wiig's character, with Maya Rudolph and Rose Byrne there to drive the plot, a couple of funny scenes from Melissa McCarthy, and next to nothing with the other two bridesmaids, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper.  Jon Hamm is pretty funny, and Chris O'Dowd is an appealing romantic interest, but overall, there just isn't enough entertainment in this movie to justify the runtime of over 2 hours.

The central conflict is a classic love triangle, with the poor protagonist competing against a rich rival.  The twist here is that all three characters are women, and it's a friendship relationship rather than a romantic one at stake.  That's fine, I guess, except that while I understand romantic relationships need to be exclusive, I spent this entire movie wondering why they don't just all be friends.  Maybe it's because I'm a guy, but if some rich guy started buying a bunch of expensive gifts for my best friend, I can't imagine that my reaction would be open and public outrage. (To be fair, my fiancee didn't like this movie either.)

To the movie's credit, it doesn't paint Wiig's character as the blameless heroine in this situation, and it does show some amount of emotional intelligence.  The main reason I didn't like it is that all the comedy set pieces (and they are very much self-contained little units rather than organic outflows of character and situation) have the feel of mediocre SNL sketches: amusing at first, occasionally outright funny, and then they overstay their welcome by 3 to 5 minutes apiece.",1319846400,10,1709,4.885813148788928

It is being compared to the Hangover which I thought was hysterical and laughed throughout it.  I just don't understand the high marks and reviews for this movie.

Kristen Wiig can be hilarious and infuriating, which shows a terrific range, but it doesn't make you like her character - which ultimately
makes the unfunny moments in this film (and there are MANY) feel like a sharp stick in the eye.

On reading through, there's not much I can add to the negative ones. They are in the main spot-on.
My DVD cover states ""Unrated"" and ""The Best Comedy Of The Year"" Wow, let's hope during the next few months, another title pops up to more deserve these two statements!

It's not too late, Movie Houses take note!

I guess it wears the ""Unrated"" badge as there are females shouting four letter words normally reserved for males.
There is absolutely nothing else in this title to cause raised eyebrows in any age category in a sexual sense, save a couple of very sick segments of nothing other than depraving vulgarity, added I guess to try and keep the flow of non events moving on.
It's mainly women on women in conversations about really nothing at all. Sex and the City fans would wonder how something like this could accelerate at all. If this movie did not include a couple of laughs centering on the ""Officer of the Law"" and an airplane segment, I would predict many more comments of a negative nature than are here at present.
This movie does no justice to American movies whatsoever and I would definitely warn lovers of European movies of any genre to well give this one a very big miss. It may warn such viewers away from possible great American movies out there and to come.",1318896000,3,1324,4.554621848739496

4592187,4,B0056IXS7S,"""Bridesmaids"" was not just a laugh 'em up type movie.  Oh yes - there were some hilarious parts.  Actually quite a few of them.  But there were also some parts of the movie that were emotional to watch.

Jealousy (of your best friend status) and don't lie - especially to yourself - you have probably been there; drinking too much and making a fool out of yourself; sleeping with someone just so you won't be alone even if the guy is the biggest user/loser on the planet; keeping your eyes open for Mr. Right when he's standing right in front of you; and on and on.

Kristen Wiig was great as wounded best friend Annie; Maya Rudolph was perfect as Lillian the bride; Chris O'Dowd was VERY cute as Officer Rhodes; Rebel Wilson/Matt Lucas were the creepiest brother/sister roommates ever; and Melissa McCarthy as Megan was spectacular in all of her role but especially her pep talk.

4592192,5,B0056IXS7S,"Bridesmaids is sort of a female version of the Hangover. There's the person who's about to get married (with the fiance largely absent), a goofy sibling comes into the picture, with one of the main characters of the film in a lousy relationship. But Bridesmaids stretches the story over a longer period of time and includes more characters (and it packs in way more character development). It's also funnier, even if it is a bit more formulaic and relies somewhat too much on caricatures (like, as gut-bustingly hilarious as they are, main character Annie's screwball roommates, a disgusting brother-sister pair). As interesting as it is to watch Annie's goofy ups and downs, and her fine acting, she does come off as a younger Meg Ryan in the way that, as attractive and likable as she is, she just can't seem to get her life together. Better than all that is the dialogue, which is pretty sassy, especially when it comes to the over-the-top sister of the groom, Meghan, played by Melissa McCarthy, who is a swarthy and raunchy butch chick (her suggestion for a bachelorette party is to do a ladies Fight Club for the young bride). Jill Clayburgh is awesome as Annie's wacky mother; sadly, it was her last film as she died of leukemia in November 2010 (ironically, her first film credit was for The Wedding Party in 1969). As for the plot, it's pretty predictable... but what a ride! Like all comedies, this one also devolves into a few pivotal ""key life lesson scenes"" that are as serious as they are unnecessary (do we really care how and when the bride came to her senses and realised who her true friend really were?), but they are short-ish, and we quickly get back to the hilarity with a dose of... Wilson Phillips?",1318723200,,1722,4.667763157894737
4592193,2,B0056IXS7S,"So I have to wonder if what I saw was the same movie that got all these positive reviews. It just doesn't seem possible.

The ""Bridesmaids"" I saw was a thinly-veiled romantic comedy that was slow moving in several parts, employed many of the same comedy devices as its counterpart ""male buddy comedies"" (right down to the fat, uncooth friend getting most of the funny/gross lines) and, in the end, was a movie that provided very few memorable moments or lines.

Another Judd Apatow production, ""Knocked Up,"" was praised for being a raunchy comedy that both male and female viewers could enjoy (translation: a chick-flick love story with penis jokes). ""Bridesmaids"" is a little more accomplished in the comedy department, but in the end, is also just a love story -- this time with poop jokes (and thankfully sans the annoying duo of Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl).

It appears as if this movie tried to be the female version of the ""The Hangover,"" or maybe more pointedly, the anti-""Sex and the City."" It accomplishes the later with great precision, however unless it's in reference to the down-right terrible sequel, ""Bridesmaids"" is hardly in the same comedy class with the better written and sharper-paced first ""Hangover.""

Sure Kristen Wiig is a very funny actress and possibly even most versitile comedian on SNL since, well, Phil Hartman. Playing basically a more likable version of the hapless Liz Lemon (Tiny Fey's character on 30 Rock) Wiig does her role justice in this movie, but when the film ends with her knight in shining armor just appearing to wisk her away in a squad car it seems maybe the writers would have been better served with Sandra Bullock or Meg Ryan, as opposed to wasting the talent of an actress with real comedy chops. As good as she was, this isn't Wiig's best work. This was a love story with jokes tacked on -- not a comedy that employed the love story angle to make the jokes better.

In the end the movie isn't all together terrible, but reviews claiming viewers ""laughed so hard they hurt"" or that ""Bridesmaids"" is the best comedy in years makes me wonder what it was I rented. Maybe I picked up some rare director's cut before the film was edited (over 2 hours for this story?) and before some of the funniest scenes were re-inserted from the cutting room floor. The copy I got was funny in spots (mostly Melissa McCarthy doing her best Zach Galifianakis material), but was ultimately slow moving with a cliched love story and a few shining moments from Wiig and Maya Rudolph.",1318723200,9,2517,4.711363636363636

4592200,5,B0056IXS7S,"When it comes to reviewing movies on Amazon, one must remember that there are two ways to approach this. One way is to review the movie content itself and the other way is to review the product itself. In this case, I'll do both.

PRODUCT REVIEW :: This specific item was the package deal that contained three editions of the film: the Blu-ray, the DVD and the digital copy. I love it when films come out in this way because it makes it easier to watch in places where you don't always have access to a Blu-ray player. For example, when you're going over to your friend's house or your parent's house and neither of them have made the step forward to getting Blu-ray, you can still enjoy the movie. Or how about when you're traveling and you don't want to add more things to your luggage...the digital copy makes up for this by allowing you to download it right into iTunes.

I know plenty of friends that found this package to be a much better deal than buying the DVD version by itself. In this case, you spend a few more dollars and get the other editions. Even if you don't have a Blu-ray player, buying this package is a smarter deal.

MOVIE REVIEW :: When I first heard about this movie, I naturally thought it was going to be a ""chick flick"" and when a female friend of mine asked me to go see it, I reluctantly said yes. When we got to the theatre, we were met with 4 of her other girlfriends and I knew I was in for it! But I was bored and wanted something to do.

The typical ideology in Hollywood is to create movies aimed at the younger generation and in the process, they are leaving out the late-20s and early-30s populations. This movie breaks down through stigma and goes straight for that demographic. It doesn't hold back and its popularity proves that there is still a group of women that don't mind a down and dirty comedy from time to time. But it doesn't stop there; for all the men out there that felt (or feel) like this is a movie that only women will like, you couldn't be further from the truth! I'm a typical guy that loves movies like Gladiator, Braveheart and American History X, yet I loved every moment of this movie!! It was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and even in the midst of the sappy, bridesmaid drama that connects the characters together and the sort of quasi-love story subplot, I still enjoyed it.

There's plenty of raunchy comedy and also an overlay of simplistic reality that everyone can relate to. Well, everyone except the kids. While I expected this movie to be funny, I also thought it was going to be preachy and very biased against men by teaching young women how to be in control of their own weddings or to be man-bashers for the rest of their lives, but it was so not that. There seemed to be no political agenda here, no man-bashing and no belittling of anybody.

It's certainly not a family movie, but for anyone interested in a comical look at life and how friends can be during the stressful time of getting married, while laughing your butt off the whole time, pick up this movie! You will not regret it!!

P.S. I've watched the ""unrated"" version and there's nothing much different. Don't expect any additional outrageous scenes or crazy things they couldn't put in the theatrical version. The extra footage is merely cutting-room floor fotter that could have easily been left out, which is probably why they did so in the first place.",1318550400,2,3418,4.424483306836248
4592201,5,B0056IXS7S,"It seems people think this film contains too many crazy unbelievable scenes just for laughs.  Well, having been to several weddings and close to wedding party members I can say that these aren't too far off.  In fact, I could picture many of these events occurring at anyone's wedding.  I guess to fully appreciate this film, you must also know about the ins and outs of wedding planning.  I actually think comparisons to ""The Hangover"" are unfair to this one.  Maybe it was inspired from it but I found the two ""Hangover"" movies to be boring and unimaginative unlike this one.

Also, I should note that I haven't bought a DVD in like 5-6 years because I haven't wanted any thanks to Netflix streaming.  I just couldn't wait this time and wanted the easy portability of a DVD.",1318550400,,776,4.579710144927536
4592202,3,B0056IXS7S,"For me, Kristen Wiig is at her best doing her own brand of physical comedy.  Usually her face is contorted, her voice rises and falls several octaves, and in general she's spazzing out.  I really like that Kristen Wiig, and I didn't get to see enough of her in this movie.  She's really only allowed to let go in a few scenes, which is too bad.  I kept hearing that she made it a point to step aside and let the others share the spotlight, and I think that was a mistake.  I don't know some of their names but here are my thoughts on the other characters:  Wendy what's her name from 'Reno 911' had some funny stuff and I wanted more.  The girl from 'The Office' might as well have not been in the movie.  Maya Rudolph was really the straight character in the mix and so didn't have much range to work with; she was pretty bland.  I liked the heavy set gal and again wanted more.  I didn't like the Rose Byrne character or her assoctiated plot device at all.  I don't mean that I hated the smart, rich, girl, but instead that the character didn't work or fit.  They could have taken this film so many ways and on any number of adventures and yet decided to work solely on the ""scorned best friend"" angle.  Byrne's charecter was just a really bland foil to Wiig; they're was never really any zing or spark in their rivalry.  They're scenes together seem to take up at least a quarter of the film, and they're not good.  The toast scene at the first engagement party comes to mind; it felt like it was a half hour long.  This was no 'Hangover,' as it seemed to be billed.  It's a vehicle for Wiig that didn't ever really let her get behind the wheel, and so as a result it's just an average chick flick with a few really funny scenes.",1318550400,2,1732,4.18429003021148
4592203,3,B0056IXS7S,"I think my expectations were set too high since I was told it was ""like The Hangover"" - they are similar in some respects but Bridesmaids lacks the clever plotting, carefully planned payoffs and inherent likability of the broken characters.

Bridesmaids has a couple of extremely funny scenes linked together by a very predictable story but it never really delivers on the promise of the premise. Kristin Wiig's character is a mashup of the SNL roles she's played in the last season and comes across as annoying and unbearable. Maya Rudolph snoozes her way through the film and doesn't really have any funny scenes to play to. The Unrated edition has some over-the-top dialog that doesn't really add anything to the film.

I ordered it on On Demand and just shut it off after about an hour (the only On Demand movie I've ever just shut off).  Nothing funny; just shockingly bad. Very crude, which I am ok with, but this movie took it to extremes, with no humor involved. How in the world is this awful film rated so highly on Amazon? Are people associated with the film or its production company giving it all the high reviews? I just saw Horrible Bosses recently, which is also crude in many spots, but at least it was VERY FUNNY. Yet this soul stealing movie is rated higher than that film? Something is not on the up and up if this movie is rated higher than Horrible Bosses. Bridesmaids is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I can't believe it's not the worst movie that everyone else has ever seen. This is my first and only Amazon review, as I couldn't hold my tongue after getting sucked into renting this disaster by the deceptive marketing campaign.

It is not a chick flick, unless comedies are meant only for women. It does not overplay the romance angle. It is first a foremost a comedy. Yes, there is mostly female cast here. Which is refreshing. Most comedy movies keep women as supporting actors. But, just because it has ladies in it, doesn't mean they sit around drinking tea and talking about menstrual cramps. There is lewd humor. There are d!@k and fart jokes here. If you don't like that sort of thing go watch Beaches or a Lifetime movie. The humor is great because it does not insult the audience or the women. It is not an insipid rom-com where a beautiful women is always tripping or is a klutz and somehow that is supposed to be funny. That just insults the audience and is not funny. If you to want to try a comedy that actually makes you laugh, and is just plain fun and highly enjoyable... Watch Bridesmaids, because that's what this movies is.",1318118400,,1233,4.310344827586207

She behaves intolerably towards the very giving new friend in her supposed best friend's life and then has everyone bending over backwards at the end of the movie to either apologise to her for THEIR behaviour or forgive her for hers.  AND she has the really nice guy she in no way deserves come to her cap in hand, thereby setting himself up for a life of misery pair bonded with a self-centred flake.  I saw the end of the movie as a tragedy more than a comedy, all these rather nice characters being lumbered still with a selfish, self-centred cow as a friend/partner.  God help any poor person who has a friend like her in their lives.

Or picturing that awful woman slinging her leg on the door post while the air marshall was trying to get to his seat. Or that awful Kristen Wiig destroying the bridal shower decorations and food because she was jealous.

No one is going to meet someone for the first time and then say how they broke a child's blanket in half because it was so full of dried semen.  The lines were so over-the-top and ridiculous.

Some scenes that could have had anyone on the floor with laughter were not pushed far enough.  The movie wound up just being really cheesy and full of scenes of improvised, badly-acted lines and lame jokes. (the one woman takes about 10 puppies from the bridal shower  -  who cares, it's not funny.

The scene where the bride had diarrhea in the street:  you saw nothing but her sitting on the ground.  How was that funny?  Should of had it all over her dress, she could have slipped on it........

The point is, you can't try act serious (as with the street crap scene) but then go OVER THE TOP the next minute.  Either you do it, or you don't.  And this movie only did it half-way.

  Lillian is a friend with an open heart, open ears and a strong shoulder for Annie who does not have her life together and is making all the wrong choices for what she really wants in life.  Annie has a job currently because of her mom being an AA sponsor after losing her business to the recession and her intimate relationship with a man consist of  late night booty calls.
  When Lillian tells Annie of her engagement Annie is happy for Lillian and they begin the Brides maid rituals with Annie being the Maid of Honor.  Trying to fulfill the obligation of the Maid of honor becomes overwhelming and stressful for Annie and she is soon replaced by Helen which is Lillian's new best friend.  After several competitive and embarrassing moments between Annie and Helen it is decided by Lillian to have Helen plan the wedding.
  While at the rehearsal party Annie finally snaps and destroys the wedding cookie, throws chocolate from the fountain into the yard, all while throwing a childish tantrum due to Helen taking intimate details of Annie and Lillian's friendship and uses them to her advantage to try and trump Annie as a best friend to Lillian one more time. Lillian then asks her not to come to the wedding.
  After conning her way into the friendship between Annie and Lillian, Helen, on the wedding day cannot find the Bride.  Helen asks Annie for help knowing that Annie would know Lillian the best.  After finding Lillian alone in her apartment, Annie brings to life the true friend that Lillian needs at her side for such a special time in her life and they forgive each other and the wedding is as beautiful as planned.

Though it occasionally presses too far over the line separating awkward humor and legitimate discomfort, the flick's lively, personable cast is never far off, life preserver tucked under one arm.

The only way i could see this getting high ratings is because of kristen wig who was spectacular and the other girls are all gorgeous other than that it's just potty humor hands down! And apparently from all the 5 star reviews people really like potty humor! I only watched this film because it was in the most popular category on here and on the zune.net website. I downloaded it and watched it with my wife. And when all was said and done i wondered why this movie would be even in the top 100 most popular. I am a movie buff and watch tons of movies. This one i gave a 2 because it had some funny, entertaining moments. But i found it overall very crewd, improper, foul and mostly uniteresting and boring. I do not recommend this movie.

I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift because we had heard how hilariously funny this movie was.  My friend's fiance even went as far to see that this was one of the funniest movies of all time.  We had numerous people tell us how funny this movie was.  Add that to the glowing reviews from rotten tomatoes and you have some very high expectations to live up to.  We were very excited to watch this movie.  I cant even begin to tell you how disappointed we both were once we started watching it.
Let me add that I like low brow movies just like anyone else.  I really liked Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, etc.  However, I also did not find The Hangover very funny, but I liked that movie a lot better than this one.  Like other reviewers have pointed out, the funniest parts (the few of them that were there) were in the previews.  I probably laughed a total of 3 times.  The rest of the time, I was wondering how long it would be until the movie was over.  My wife even fell asleep watching it.  How many times have we seen a movie where people get diarrhea at the worst possible moment and do something zany?  Seen it a million times before.  Does this movie have that?  Check.  It is supposed to be funny just because women are doing it now?  Also, how many times have you seen what I like to call the ""sing-a-long"" scene?  You know, the ""funny"" part of the movie when the characters lip sync to a song that was once a guilty pleasure for many people.  Does this movie have that?  Check.  I could have sworn that Harold and Kumar lip synced to the same song.  More or less, what I am trying to say is that this movie has been done 100 times before, but just because it is women doing it now, it is REALLY funny because it is out of the ordinary for them?

THEN Lillian gets engaged and another woman, Rose Byrne, aggressively comes between Lillian and Annie, wanting to be Lillian's Maid of Honor instead of Annie who, to be fair, IS in over her head.  There are moments of vulgarity and a little too much bathroom humor, but all in all this comedy is good-natured and in the end has a sweet lesson to learn: Only Annie can make her life better.  Chris O'Dowd was wonderful as the cop who pulled her over because of broken taillights and, then, when they meet again they strike up a friendship.  He wants more but Annie is so used to bad guys that she doesn't know how to proceed when a good guy comes along.  Also, it was nice to see Franklyn Ajaye who played Lillian's father again after not seeing him for years in anything.  Melissa McCarthy was a standout performer.

 I do not go to movie theaters as I find them overpriced, crowded with insane twits who would rather text & talk on their cells then enjoy the film they paid to watch and generally a bad experience all around. Rather, I rent films either through Amazon or Netflix.
 After talking my boyfriend into watching Bridesmaids (again, because of the reviews), we sat back waiting for some laughs. They never came. In fact, about 10 minutes into the film he said 'What the hell is this crap?' and the rest was history.
 Kristin Wiig is a terrible actress (apparently writer, too.) She is great at playing the low self-esteem, down on her luck type character but she is ALWAYS Kristin Wiig, in every one of her performances. How sad that she brought the ever-funny Maya Rudolph down in flames with her.
 We made it to the bridal store scene before I finally stopped the show. We didn't laugh, we didn't feel sorry (or any other emotion for that matter) for any of the characters and we certainly didn't find what others found so appealing.
 Before the Bridesmaids fan-wagon attacks this review I feel I should point out that I am not a prude or a ""conservative Christian"" as one commenter said ""all the negative people"" who criticized this film were. I enjoyed the Hangover, Old School, 40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, etc., etc., etc. This movie wasn't even in the same realm & frankly I could care less if the characters had been female or male; the film just plain sucks!
 Do yourselves a favor, folks. Tread with caution. I'm not gonna say to save your money, or to not watch this at all.

I will definitely be buying this movie.",1316995200,2,934,4.037837837837838
4592284,5,B0056IXS7S,"I begged my boyfriend to see ""Bridesmaids"" with me, but he said no several times because it was a ""chick flick"". After it started playing at the discount theater (I believe tickets are $2.50 each) last month, I finally talked him into it. We both enjoyed the movie a lot, cracking up laughing at several parts. The movie dragged in some places (like during the bridal shower and engagement party), but the other hilarious scenes made up for it. I have previously found the star, Kristin Wiig, very dry and too dead-pan (not my style) in previous movies, but she was much more animated here and carried this movie well. Melissa McCarthy was the funniest one out of all the girls. I recommend this movie to anyone (well, anyone over 18) who enjoys a good knee-slapping comedy, whether you are male or female.",1316995200,,806,4.643356643356643

Bridesmaids.  Because that's what movie it is.

It does no good to compare it to the Hangover as they are (wait for it....) two different movies.  I guess The Hangover Part 2 was another version of The Hangover for people who had already seen The Hangover, but I digress.

It is refreshing to see women comedians being funny in a major motion picture. My direct comparison is Hall Pass where two very funny women (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) are cast as boring wives who go for walks and roll their eyes because ""all men do this"" and ""all women do that."" yawn.

I thought this movie was hilarious in the theater with my female friend and still hilarious on DVD with my husband. Kristen Wiig is wonderful and very relatable. The rest of the women in the primary, secondary and even tertiary roles all provide funny, solid performances.

4592286,4,B0056IXS7S,"Kristen Wiig is one of America's most talented comedic actors and it was great to finally see her in a starring role in a film. BRIDESMAIDS is outrageous fun and a bit of a shocker at times. This times it the ladies who get to be the ""bad guys"" but in a good way. Lillian played by Maya Rudolph is about to get married. Kristen Wiig is Annie who just happened to be Lillian's oddball but loveable best friend. Enter Whitney who is desperately competing to be Lillian's new best friend and the best wedding planner ever. Annie and Whitney try to outdo each other and become number one in Lillian's eyes.
Bathroom humor and wild language abound in this film. BRIDESMAIDS is not a family film but both men and women will enjoy it. It goes far beyond the so-called ""chick flick."" Kristin Wiig is always a delight to watch and nothing is funnier than her trying to get arrested for a moving violation as her boyfriend cop is ignoring her. Who is driving that car anyway?
That late Jill Clayburgh plays Annie's mother. It's bittersweet to see her one last time in a not so inspiring role. Matt Lucas, star of Englands hit comedy series, LITTLE BRITAIN, has a bit of an odd role as Annie's roommate. The living situation is even more odd as his sister has planted herself in the apartment and is paying no rent. I'm not sure why a popular British comedic actor was thrown into the mix and not used at all to the best of his talents.
Not to be missed is the girls as they go to try on wedding and bridesmaids dresses after having some seriously bad Brazilian food. Bathroom humor explodes-literally.
I took the time to watch the extras and Paul Rudd was originally in the movie in a small role that didn't making the cut in the end.

4592302,3,B0056IXS7S,"After reading the blizzard of strong reviews for this movie, and with lots of enthusiasm for the cast and interest in the premise, I was eager to see Bridesmaids but underwhelmed when I did. The movie gets billed as groundbreaking and unusual and is widely described as edgy and beyond the usual bounds of the rom-com+grossout genre that has been being mined for decades now. But it's standard fare in all respects, from the writing (you've seen this plot tens of times) and skit-type situations to the characters and underlying ideas and themes. You know how the stories will resolve; you know how the characters will develop. Many of the performances are fantastic -- Wiig, Rudolph, and Byrne are amazing -- but other characters are only halfway there and the actresses who play them are wasted. I did not find the film ""hilarious"" (as so many claim); it was generally funny, sometimes very funny, but as with every aspect of the film, even the comedy underperformed. I think the responsibility goes directly to director Feig, as the material, premise, and cast are full of promise but hardly used to best advantage. Example: When Maya Rudolph, who is an amazing performer of both characters and physical comedy, has her character pooping in the street underneath the wedding dress she is trying on, it's funny and gross, as it's meant to be, but that incident is shot abnd edited so poorly that what could have been a blizzard of images of a great comic actress in a spectacularly funny/gross incident is most just shown from mid-distance. You get the idea, you sort of laugh, but what could and should have been a larger scene providing an infinitely greater number of ""hilarious"" shots never gets beyond a ""Porky's""-style sequence. Sure, I liked it, but I can't help feeling that the material and cast could have been treated with a whole lot more effect by the director. I wanted and expected to love this movie, and while I enjoyed it, I thought there was a lot less here than there could have been.",1316908800,2,2006,4.750716332378223

Wiig plays Annie, a very hapless woman whose was completely all miserable, and Rudolph plays Lillian, Annie's longtime BFF. And to make it real brief, one of the scenes I like was an altercation between Annie, Lillian, and her other friends against two flight attendants who made Annie find a seat on the plane, so apparently it was an SRO flight to Vegas. But that flight, however had to be stopped over in Casper, Wyoming as the ladies were all forced out of The Plane. So much for the trip.

For starters, I don't think the Hangover I or II are the funniest movies ever made. I actually went to see the 2nd part to the movies because of a cousin; I laughed a few times but that was it. Anyway, Bridesmaids is mainly focused on the life of Annie, whose life seems to be going nowhere after the failure of her bakery. She's sleeping with a man who doesn't care for her and she's working a job she hates. I've read how some people state that the characters are not real, but I don't see what's unreal about any of that? I can totally relate to them and their situations, and just because this movie shows the real side of women, it doesn't have to be bashed upon. There are a few nasty scenes that some people considered them to be too much, but I think they added to the movie and just made the characters seem even more real.

I didn't know much about Kristen Wiig until recently and I have fallen in love with her. I think she's naturally funny and I will continue to watch her movies. The lines that are said throughout the movie were original and truly funny. I do have to say that the cop with the bizarre sort of British/Scottish accent was a little weird, but nothing major.

I loved her on ""Saturday Night Live"" and I'm always amazed at how talented she is.  In BRIDESMAIDS, she not only stars but also shares writing credit...which is another reason I enjoyed this movie so much:

Only a woman would have written this.

As crude as BRIDESMAIDS sometimes is, rivaling male-oriented gross-out comedies like THE HANGOVER and such, this is still a story that only a woman would write.  My case in point: the scene where Kristen feels the need to keep snatching the microphone from best friend Maya Rudolph's rich soon-to-be sister-in-law.  The need to assert just how much these girls love and respect and care about Maya...only a woman would have written that.  Guys wouldn't understand how much that means to a woman.  Male writers would've just come up with schtick to embarass the girls.

So BRIDESMAIDS ends up being a fairly interesting insight into women and how they think.

That said...this movie is over two hours of ""men suck"" and is so immersed in self-pity that it is nearly unwatchable. I did, unlike many other reviewers here, watch the entire movie. It's a Lifetime original movie wrought with the occasional four letter word and one or two instances of bawdy humor. Never in my life have I seen a movie so incredibly misleading in it's advertising.

But there are a couple of scenes in particular that will go down in movie history as being classic comedy.  While I won't give anything away here to those who have not seen this movie yet, all I'm going to say is the ""Bridal Shop"" scene and the ""Little Boy w/Glasses"" scene.  All of the characters are great, but Kristin Wiig and Melissa McCarthy's characters are far & away the scene stealers here.  The movie isn't hilarious the entire way through as there is a meaningful plot that plays true to life for many I'm sure.

This movie was just sad, and the parts that were supposed to be funny were just awkward.  I do not understand what other people thought was funny.",1316822400,6,398,4.142857142857143
4592322,1,B0056IXS7S,"Huh. I really fell for that b.s. advertising campaign.

Unusual for me as I'm normally quite adept at seeing through the manufactured manure. But give credit where credit is due - they caught a cynic and an experienced film fan. I got sold a pile of poo dressed up as a steak.

Extremely disappointed would be an understatement.

The campaign made this out as the female version of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B001UV4XEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>', so I had very high expectations. This was NOTHING LIKE like that hilarious flick. This was...

Geez, I don't know. I don't have a frame of reference to compare this to or with another film. Maybe something seen on the Lifetime Channel or Oxygen. Maybe.

I suppose there were some silly moments, and Melissa McCarthy's occasional flatulence flare-ups and profanity laced commentary mildly livened things up a bit here and there. But there were stunningly long stretches of Kristen Wiig's character being overwhelmed, extraordinarily uncomfortable, and dealing with a mega heavy dose of soul-crushing low self-esteem.

Ha ha?

I don't get it.

The body expulsion scenes were gross without any real sense of hilarity. That's a gimme in comedies. And it failed. What the bleep?

And that was sixty-minutes worth of the film. The only real laugh out loud moment was... uhm.... there wasn't one. That was one tough hour let me tell you.

The second hour... can you believe this was actually two bleeping hours long?!?!?!?!

The second hour was the start of the ""Vegas Trip"" which was heavily advertised, and I completely don't get this part, but they didn't end up in Vegas. In fact, there isn't one scene in Vegas and the characters all return to their homes and lives in Wisconsin.

<deep breath>

And the downward spiral continues from there.

<sigh>

I haven't been this fooled before in a very long time. And how sad is it that an AC/DC song got pulled into this pile?

Two hours, ten minutes, and sixteen seconds. I bet I'll want that back one day.

So sad.

One final note - what does it say when the funniest parts of this entire flick were the 15-second outtakes with, again, Melissa McCarthy?",1316822400,10,2222,5.0576923076923075

And then you get to witness every event prior to the wedding get completely messed up in some way, from the engagement party, to the bridal shower, to the bachelorette party. And probably one of the funniest scenes- the girls go pick out their dresses.... Really, it's best to just watch it instead of having people talk to much about it.

While there are some girly moments and an entirely predictable ending, I did find some things to laugh at and enjoy.  This will not be going into my collection as I felt no real connection to any of the characters, but it is nice to see an attempt at all women comedy to break up the usual male ensemble.

4592332,3,B0056IXS7S,"BRIDESMAIDS is not a film this viewer would normally have watched, but in a week where there is very little else available On Demand on television, the button parked here.  In many ways the film was a surprise, actually better than expected. The promo for the film was that it was a female version of HANGOVER or BORAT, an attempt to demonstrate to guys that women can be just as gross and vulgar as men.  But actually the story is more a tale of a group of sad women, unhappy in many ways with their relationships with not only men but also with other women.  Written by star Kristen Wigg and Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig it is a pulled together series of vignettes about women in distress, and while it does include the gross-out promises of PR (barf/flatulence/body insert references) and the manner in which women in competition behave, it still remains a story of how sad people cope.

Annie (Kristin Wiig) is a barely employed woman who has lost her dream of having her own bakery and having a  meaningless physical relationship with cad Ted (Jon Hamm) relies on her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) to get through life, until Lillian announces she is getting married and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. Even though Annie is broke, living with a disgusting British brother and sister as a roomer, she accepts the responsibilities.  The sparkle of the wedding dream plans fizzles when Annie meets the incongruous group of women who will be bridesmaids: the wealthy, haughty Helen (Rose Byrne), the obese socially gross Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the oversexed inappropriate mother Rita (Wendi McLendon McCarthy) and the silly insubstantial Becca (Ellie Kemper).  In a series of gag moments - eating in a Brazilian caf&eacute;, trying on dresses, a grossly overdone flight in the direction of Las Vegas, and a preposterous wedding shower - the girls fall apart as potential friends only, of course, to some together in the end.

There are a few redeeming elements in the film that are worthy of attention - the Irish police officer Nathan Rhodes  a sparkling Chris O'Dowd) who provides the only semblance of true sentiment in Annie's ridiculous life and Annie's mother played by Jill Clayburgh in what was to be her last role (she died of Leukemia seen after the film was completed).  Kristin Wiig does carry the film, despite the fact that her expressions and character show minimal variation as the story plods along. But in the end, despite all the attempts to out-gross HANGOVER, this is a sad little film about bruised women  and how their interdependence provides a way out of the meaningless lives they lead.

4592358,2,B0056IXS7S,"I got my advanced copy of Bridesmaids(theatrically released May/11),through a store which mistakenly released it too early,anticipating great things according to all the hype and reviews on it,and of course the big bonanza at the box office. Boy was I disappointed;gags that a one year old could see coming even before the movie rolled. It stars Kristen Wiig as Annie who also co wrote the screenplay along with Annie Mumolo. Jill Clayburgh who I hadn't seen for far too long plays Annies mother. It is a shame she passed away late last year before the movie even opened as she gave as best a performance as she could considering the inane material given to her. There is even an outtake where one actress apologizes for making her having to say the lines that she does. Add to this,in Canada at least,a terrible layer change hesitation on the disc,the length of which I've never encountered.
Anyways on with the plot. It involves the aforementioned Annie who had a bakery business that went bust and like the business,her romance department is in equal doldrums. She is going with a self absorbed twit named Ted(John Hamm) and she lives with two totally off the wall characters by the names of Gil(Matt Lucas) and his sister Brynn(Rebel Wilson).Thrown into the mix is Annie's life long friend Lillian(Maya Rudolph)who is getting married and Annie is picked as her maid of honour.
One of Lllian's bridesmaids Helen(Rose Byrne) doesn't see eye to eye with Annie and the two from the get go pick at each other and try to out do each other at every turn. Helen is married to a well off banker exec so she can afford the luxuries to throw Lillian's way and at the same time impress the heck out of everyone else. Things just go steadily downhill for Annie who manages to get everyone sick at a restaurant they eat at and on a flight to Vegas for the bachelorette party she becomes drunk(in big part due to Helen's advice)and gets the plane diverted to Wyoming.
Back home Annie flirts with and eventually sleeps with a local Irish born cop named Nathan(Chris Dowd).However due to the stress of everything she shy's away from getting too deep and backs off any further personal interaction. Annie travels to Chicago to attend her friends bridal shower only to find that Helen has stolen the very Parisian theme she had envisioned for it. When Helen offers to take Lillian to Paris for a dress fitting with the designer himself she melts down and trashes much of the table settings and leaves. Annie is banned from the wedding by Lillian.
On the way home Annie's car breaks down,and that being the final straw,she retreats into her apartment. Fellow bridesmaid Megan(Melissa Mccarthy)comes around and gives Annie some much needed advice and gets her out of her depression. Annie bakes a cake to makes amends to the cop but it remains on the doorstep where she left it. Helen then shows up saying Lillian has disappeared but also apologizes for her behavior towards her. The search for Lillian ends at her apartment and the two reconcile. Annie is reinstated as the top bridesmaid and the wedding goes off without a hitch,with Nathan arriving on the scene to also reconcile with Annie.
Some of the best moments in this movie come from the unexpected places and not necessarily from its' two main characters. Melissa Mccarthy plays the over weight but plucky and steadfast friend/bridesmaid and she is given some worthwhile moments on the flight to Vegas and her heart to heart with Annie. The brother and sister Annie live with are almost alien like and quite creepy but so off the wall that you have to shake your head more than once. Ben Falcone as the ""no I'm not an Air Marshall"" gives an understated but decent performance,as does Franklyn Ajaye as Lillian's dad. And watch for a brief appearance by Terry Crews who played Gerard Butler's nemesis in the great action film Gamer.
However over all the so called gags are strained and quite,QUITE shallow. It starts from the very beginning where Annie is leaving Ted's place and the motorized gate is closed. Of course this wouldn't happen in real life as it would be obvious the gate would have to get opened in order for her to leave,but yes I know,this is just a movie. Who couldn't see that once she climbed that gate to get over it,it would somehow open with her on it? We then find Annie talking sexual humour with her friend Lillian...whoopee. The scenes where the bridesmaids get sick is quite gross and WAY too obvious. Her roommate Byrne is on the big side and when she shows Annie her tattoo on her back of course this is time to show all the fat folds and the butt crack...been there,done that.*yawn*.Chris Dowd's lackluster performance as Nathan is no where near believable,so I cannot suspend my disbelief long enough to believe why a good looking lady like that would ever fall for a milk toast guy like Natahan. Annie and Helen's attempts at getting Nathan's attention by her constant driving by his squad car are just plain childish stuff and very unfunny. And Wiig's over all performance as Annie is far from ingratiating. It's underplayed too much and the spark just is not there.
Technically speaking the film is in its a/r of 2:40:1 and the picture is clear and crisp. This release comes with the theatrical version and the unrated version. There are deleted scenes,extended and alternate ones,a gag reel,commentary and more. There is also(at least in the Canadian release) a terrible layer change hesitation. The scene goes from Nathan and Annie sleeping together to a shot of Annie laying on the bed. I counted at least an eight second hesitation which is the longest I have ever encountered. The disc I checked and it is pristine. This is obviously a manufacturing error and not as a result of a disc scratch or film flaw. Universal take note.
All in all a disappointing movie from this reviewers perspective. The humour is oft times of the toilet brand and quite juvenile,so shallow you can see through it and it is telegraphed way,way ahead.

All that nonsense isn't required when the script is so very good.  It is smart, funny writing in the hands of smart funny actors. Someone else said it, and I agree, movies rarely portray women as they really are.  Our humor is not necessarily gentle or feminine and our language not always clean, but we can be wicked smart and funny as hell.

Sure, I can see the comparison (Happens before a wedding, they go to Los Vegas, ect.) But this movie is so much more than the Hangover I and II. There's emotion, comedy, laugh-out-loud throw up scenes, and most of all it's so realistic! Like they don't pick someone like Megan Fox or Eva Mendes. They pick people who A.) Are up and coming stars and B.) People can actually relate to!
My Mom and I saw this together and the first 5-10 minutes was so awkward! But, rest assured , after those first 3 or 4 scenes, the movie starts to lighten up on the sexuality and actually cracks jokes that are hilarious without relying on sex!
Kristen Wiig has to be one of the funniest women on the planet! Closely followed by Melissa McCarthy! But, this movie is so greatly casted, so greatly acted, and so Laugh-out-loud hilarious! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to cry from laughing so hard! Or someone who is looking for a movie that will put the Hangover to shame!",1316217600,7,1080,4.459595959595959

I'm a Family Guy type of person and that makes me just die laughing lol

When I saw this it was just the greatest movie (99 percent of the time I don't laugh out loud at comedies, just chuckle on the inside) but I was laughing out loud at this movie!
I know it may seem like an inappropriate/trashy movie the first three or so minutes of the movie (I'm trying to convince my mom to watch it when it comes out, and just to ignore the first part) But it really is just the greatest movie.

The story line is even great, the characters are all so unique too. Great actresses and actors even though they're not big time stars, they're actually better than a lot of huge actors/actresses. I had a lot of hopes throughout the story, like the outcome, and when it's a really good movie like this one, I get into the story and am like ""oh I hope this happens ahh!!""

There were so many OH MY GOD!!! HAHAHAHHA! moments, and it really made my day and I wanted to see it again and again.

After thinking she is being replaced as best friend she tries too hard to compensate. Almost ruining the wedding in the process. This movie has what I call the ""Due Date"" or ""Hangover"" curse. Like those movies, the first people to see it, before the hype and word of mouth got out of control think this is great and hilarious. People like me who have waited a little too long and have outrageous expectations are left disappointed. Going in thinking this is the female ""Hangover"" I was excited. While I can see the comparisons, it was more chick-flicky then I was expecting. While this did have funny parts and I did laugh it wasn't as good as expected. Overall, this is a good movie, but because of the expectations I had I didn't like it as much as I thought. I give it a B.

We've been seeing this in the workplace for some years and finally it has hit the big screen. The ensemble cast sports a wide sampling of female comedic talents who take aim at so many ""inside jokes"" of life as a female that we get a unique comedic voice that we will be  hearing from for years to come if the audience I sat among was any indication. There were times that the jokes were so ""inside"" that the women in the audience were howling with delight, while many men looked sort of puzzled. Great movie for a ""girl's night out""!

4592394,5,B0056IXS7S,"I'm 22 (almost 23 now) and a guy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's funny when I look back on the film that I can't really remember too many specific parts that stood out to me as vulgar or horrible. The food poisoning scene only last what I felt like was 5 minutes at maximum. I could be wrong though... What I found to be especially interesting about this film is that even as a 22 year old guy I was still able to draw a lot of similarities from this movie. It's just about this woman who has had some really bad luck. The scene with Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph in the very beginning of the coffee shop was really funny to me because it felt like when I would go to the local coffee shop and meet up with all my friends. The really complicated part of this story is Kristen Wiig's struggle to realign herself with all of her wife's new country club friends. It is something that can happen to many people in the US. Many of my friends have gotten married and have ask me or other friends to partake in certain event but it was just impossible. The scene where she is really stressing out over the Vegas trip was quite a real moment for me. I think there has been many times like that for many people out there.

Also, for people that are saying that women don't ""talk like that."" Are you kidding? Out of my group of friends the girls are definitely the more dirty ones. That could be just my group however. Anyways, in conclusion the story is good and the comedy compliments it nicely. I think that the girls in the film are some very believable characters that I could find in my hometown or in my circle of friends. I think watching a woman's struggle with this feeling that everyone around her moving on to married life while complimented by elements of comedy was a really refreshing mix.

At the least, give it a try. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy especially stood out for me and I hope they do the same for you. Have fun and laugh.",1315008000,,1950,4.2533692722371965

Kristin Wiig's story of a hapless maid of honor who just can't seem to get it right, is hilarious and touching, all at the same time.  The casting is brilliant.  Maya Rudolph (daughter of the famous Minnie Riperton) plays more of the straight role to Wiig's over the top comic relief.  Rose Byrne is divine as a conniving maid of honor wannabe, and Melissa McCarthy steals the show on many occasions as the one friend who ultimately gets Wiig's character ""Annie"" to finally see the light.  This is not a chick flick, but for those ladies looking for a delicious leading man, Chris O'Dowd plays a cute (and strong, and funny) Irish cop who stops ""Annie"" for a broken tail light, and eventually becomes the man she never realized she needs.

4592401,2,B0056IXS7S,"I got so bored with this movie in the theater that I stopped caring about what happened in the end, which is a pretty steep insult.

The main problem for me was that the plot is wildly uneven. The story doesn't know where it wants to go. The poster/cover makes it appear as though it's about a group of bridesmaids and their wacky adventures, but in truth it's mainly a story centered around the maid of honor. The conflict is that she's down on her luck, and feels like she's being replaced as the bride's best friend by one of the other bridesmaids - an overly cheerful, slightly two-faced, rich woman. The other three bridesmaids hardly feature, which is a shame, since they were the more interesting characters.

About halfway through the film, it seems as though the action is going to pick up as the gang boards a plane to Vegas, however, they all end up getting kicked off the plane, and take a bus back home. What happened to Vegas?? Apparently they ditched those plans. It's these weird plot detours that make me wonder why the movie couldn't just choose a plot and stick with it.

The adventures of the mismatched bridesmaids in Vegas, or anywhere really, would have been much more interesting than watching the main character/maid of honor mope around their small town. She begins to get increasingly hard to like as she pushes just about everyone in her life away, including the nice town cop who has taken an interest in her. She gets kicked out of her apartment, she's rude to her customers at work, trashes a bridal shower, and acts totally irrational. She only ""saves the day"" in the end when she has to talk the bride back into going to the wedding when she gets cold feet.

Add this to the fact that nothing in the film is particularly clever or funny. The restaurant she chooses makes everyone sick (in a particularly disgusting sequence of vomit and other bodily fluids). She gets drunk on the plane and acts like an idiot. Her roommates are fat, English morons. She has a ""friend with benefits"" who is (surprise-surprise) a total jerk. The funniest bit was a scene almost at the end of the film where she tries to get the attention of the nice cop she rejected earlier by breaking traffic laws, but even that wasn't enough to save the film.

All in all, I greatly disliked it, and am baffled by the amount of people who think it's great. The only thing ""different and refreshing"" about it is that it's a bunch of women being crass and idiotic, rather than a bunch of guys.",1313452800,14,2493,4.518847006651884

4592422,4,B0056IXS7S,"Annie (Kristen Wiig) is not doing well right now.  Her bakery shop has just failed and she's seeing Ted (an uncredited Jon Hamm), who obviously doesn't give a damn about her.  As a result, Annie's self-esteem is at a low point.  To matter's worse, her bestfriend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is getting married, which means she'll soon be spending less time in Annie's life for emotional support.

Lillian has selected Annie as her maid of honor, but given the drama in Annie's personal life, Annie is having trouble keeping up with her obligations.  To fill in the slack, one of the bridesmaids Helen (Rose Byrne) steps in and soon takes over, threatening Annie's friendship with Lillian.

Offering a ray of home in Annie's life is Nathan (Chris O'Dowd), a police officer that gives her a break on a citation.  A romance soon develops, but the emotionally damaged Annie does everything in her power to derail the relationship.

The thing that distinguishes ""Bridesmaids"" from numerous wedding pictures that preceded it is how the women behave.  They are just as wild and raunchy as men.

Also, unlike the wedding comedy, ""Jumping the Broom"" that was released around the same time, the situations develop organically from the characters.  The characters behave in logical, if sometimes predictable ways. They also each have distinguishable characteristics. For example, despite Helen's prissy exterior, we see her humanity and vulnerability.

Also, in a subtle way, ""Bridesmaids"" touches upon some serious issues, like how people have been impacted by the economy and how difficult it is for some people to have healthy relationships.

Despite Annie's many emotional issues, we understand Annie's behavior and where it comes from. One would only wish that it weren't taken to quite the extreme it does in the film.

Overall, ""Bridesmaids"" is an entertaining film with colorful characters that is never dull or boring.  Despite Annie's excesses, she is an engaging character that you want to root for.",1310860800,4,1994,5.130030959752322
4592423,3,B0056IXS7S,"When I am in the mood for a fun, screwball comedy, it is nice to find a film by Saturday Night Live cast members.  Over the years, I have missed a lot of these movies (all of Belushi, Adam Sandler, and Rob Schneider, much of Will Ferrell and Mike Myers and (fortunately) Bill Murray; plus Baby Mama, MacGruber, and others).  And there have been some big disappointments (like Master of Disguise, Stuart Saves His Family).  But I still look forward to the ones I am able to get to the theater to see.  The latest was Bridesmaids, which generally received good reviews but which left me with mixed feelings.  The plot is well summarized by other reviews, so I will not repeat it.

There were some funny scenes.  Stand-outs include the bridesmaids trying on fancy gowns while being stricken with food poisoning from a diner Wiig took them to; Wiig acting crazy on a plane, or to vent her frustrations at the over-the-top bridal shower, or to get a patrolman's attention.  Although crude at times, the movie mainly came across as cute, sweet, and genuine.  Overall, the acting was good.  Wiig's down-to-earth, slightly cranky policeman boyfriend stole the show.  The characters were quirky but had real humanity.  Only the narcissistic pig who Wiig spent the night with at the start of the movie was a total loser, and he got some well-deserved comeuppance (but not enough, due to a too low-key Wiig).  The movie avoided mean-spirited or over-the-top caricaturing.  Even Wiig's nemesis, her childhood friend Maya Rudolph's glitzy, seemingly perfect new friend, ended up being portrayed sympathetically as a decent person.  The characters' actions, even when exaggerated for laughs, mostly seemed to flow naturally from who they were presented to be.  The movie suggested the larger themes that life is what you make of it and that tomorrow is another day.

But the movie fell short.  Qualities that made it endearing also held back and sapped its energy.  The movie was too slight and understated, and its storytelling too choppy, slow, and uncertain (as, to some extent, was Wiig's acting; Rudolph was reduced to a totally straight role, with none of her normal spark).  The film's scattered attempts to be serious and to send a message (including simply coasting on some easy-listening song lyrics toward the end) felt vague, superficial, and false.

For example, at a low point for Wiig, when she is hiding out at her mother's home depressed, a loud, crass bridesmaid who is Rudolph's groom's sister and appears to have no prior relationship and to have spent almost no time with Wiig, suddenly shows up and starts wrestling with her on the couch (to get her to show some spunk, we are told).  But this key scene (which also includes the sister trashing the groom to Wiig for no reason and with no explanation) comes out of nowhere.  There is no preparation for it in the character of this other bridesmaid or any familiarity or rapport between the two women.  It is uncomfortable, drawn-out, and phony.  Wiig, again acting far too subdued (as she does too often in the film), does not even seem to get it, or to take it anywhere.  To chalk this up to Wiig's character's self esteem problems does not make it interesting or effective.  Another example, also a key scene, is when the new friend's plans for a flamboyant, extravagant wedding finally become too much for Rudolph, who goes AWOL, returns to her roots, reconciles with Wiig, and says the whole thing has gotten out of hand and out of sync, financially and otherwise, with her family and friends.  Yet, the movie bulled right ahead, as if the scene had never happened, to exactly the overblown wedding that Rudolph supposedly had come to realize was not true to who she is, just to squeeze laughs out of all of the excess and to close on a flashy note.

Nor did it help the movie that some of the gags did not flow naturally from the characters and story, but were gratuitous, silly, or pat.  A small example was Wiig suddenly becoming childish after a serious scene with the policeman, giggling to him to run the siren, just to provide a light-hearted note to end on.  A much worse example was the ill-fitting, baseless, tasteless scene about a sandwich that was tacked on to the end credits when it should have been left on the cutting room floor or for a deleted scenes disk.

These problems dragged down a movie that I wanted to like a lot more.",1309996800,3,4408,4.7215686274509805

4592451,5,B0056IXS7S,"Here, I'll say it, BRIDESMAIDS is better than THE HANGOVER. The tipping point is that BRIDESMAIDS comes with a core of emotional truth whereas if you lift that sense of mystery from THE HANGOVER, what's left is a series of skits. BRIDESMAIDS comes with more heart. It passes the smell test, demonstrates staying power. Odds are, it won't be long before other films are being lauded as ""the next BRIDESMAIDS."" And, based on that comparison, I might check out that other film, too.

Our self-destructive lead character Annie (Kristen Wiig) is informed that ""hitting bottom is a good thing,"" but I think we all know that's a bunch of baloney, a heap of hooey. Character building can go fudge itself if it means one has to go thru what Annie does just to learn valuable life lessons. Annie's had a bad time of it. Her bakery shop went south. Her boyfriend is this self-absorbed, belittling, non-committing assclown. She rooms with an odd and portly British brother and sister whose presence, let's face it, can't possibly make anyone feel comfortable. Her current job as sales clerk at a jewelry store is as fulfilling as it sounds. And, to point out the cherry on her misery cake, Annie's best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), is getting married, with Annie tapped as the maid of honor.

Oh, does Annie have issues. She's one of life's self-saboteurs; she can be blamed for much of the bad joss what's befallen her. She loves her best friend dearly, but the cheap, pathetic side of her can't help but be resentful that their lives are going opposite ways. And since the hits keep on coming, why not now introduce the magnificent Helen (a very good Rose Byrne). Helen is the gorgeous trophy wife of Lillian's fiance's boss, and she's struck up a friendship with Lillian. Helen, wealthy as Croesus, supernaturally efficient at organizing weddings, and determined not to be upstaged. Helen and Annie immediately get on like houses on fire. Annie senses that Helen is poaching her best friend. Out comes the competitive streak. Except that Annie isn't as straight-faced sneaky as Helen. Watch Annie fall apart.

The theater I went to became sheer bedlam, rocking with belly laughs so raucous that entire chunks of dialogue went unheard. So that means something. Unless you're a friggin' recluse, you must have some down-to-earth women friends. These bridesmaids are drawn from stereotypes, but these actresses are all so funny. I can point out several of my women pals who fit several of these molds to a damn T. The fantastic cast works so well together. I haven't laughed so hard in years as when the bridal shop disaster went down. Anyway, this shouldn't come as a shock: Women sleep around, and often exercise the right to be vulgar when in comfortable company, and they certainly engage in scatological humor. Wendi McLendon-Covey (""Rita"") is one of the bridesmaids, a discontented housewife with unruly kids, and although she's not in the movie a lot, she makes an impression (especially with that ""crack the blanket in half"" line). But it's the unfiltered Melissa McCarthy (""Megan""), built like a pugnacious fire hydrant, who ends up stealing the scenes.

Not having watched SNL in forever long, I didn't know Kristen Wiig from Shatner's wig. But now she's fixed on my radar, and now I expect this same level of funny out of her. Kristen Wiig is amazing in BRIDESMAIDS, co-writing it, performing in it. Her character is at turns petty and self-pitying and abusive, and yet there's a pained vulnerability and an innate likability that makes you invest in her. She's so sad sack. You long for her to get her sh-- together, and you pull for her to get with that charming highway patrol cop with the unexpected Irish accent. But she's so resistant, so stuck in her rut. You pull for her.

Setting aside Wiig's ability to emote (which apparently surprised people left and right), her comic talents are what separate her from the pack. She has exquisite comic timing. What she does in that airplane sequence is spectacular stuff. And she exhibits marvelous chemistry with Maya Rudolph. Their friendship feels real; it helps to ground the story. I think this is a huge turning point for Kristen Wiig's career, if she rides this good momentum. And BRIDESMAIDS, it's one of them rare animals, a chick flick that a guy can sit thru without feeling that he's fulfilling an obligation to the girlfriend or the wife.

Although, appearing from the advertising, this may seem like it's all about the bachelorette party, it's not. The film does not primarily focus on all six girls, but particularly Rudolph (the bride-to-be), Wiig (the maid of honor), and Byrne (the new, rich best friend). Byrne, who is known mostly for drama (FX's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Damages-The-Complete-Seasons-1-2/dp/B003IPCRWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Damages: The Complete Seasons 1-2</a>), does wonders in comedy; to catch her prior comedic performance, check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Him-to-the-Greek-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B002ZG97PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Him to the Greek (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>. And Melissa McCarthy shines as Megan, the future sister-in-law, who -- along with Wiig -- owns most of the laughs in the film! Kemper basically plays her other cute, girl-next-door role Erin (from NBC's ""The Office"") but does well at it. McLendon-Covey (Comedy Central's ""Reno 911"") also does well as the mom of three boys who needs to run wild. And Jon Hamm (AMC's ""Mad Men""), who proves that drama is not his only talent, is great as the jerky pretty-boy, booty-call buddy, Ted. But the triumvirate of Wiig, Rudolph and Byrne are the best ones here! Their chemistry truly compliments this film. The movie, co-written by Wiig, not only is hugely humorous, but also speaks to the very reality that is how catty and territorial woman can sometimes be with each other (i.e., when Wiig feels her role as best friend is being taken over by Byrne). The great thing about the film, besides the laughs, is the true message that Wiig's Annie has to learn as things in her life fall apart all around her. She has to step up and learn to respect herself, not feel sorry for herself, and at the same time be sensitive to others. This may sound like a bummer or too deep for a comedy, but the film pulls it all off without being pretentious or too deep.

Both Wiig and Rudolph have shined in previous roles and proved their acting chops -- Wiig in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whip-It/dp/B002VPTJOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whip It</a>&nbsp;and Rudolph in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Away-We-Go/dp/B0021L8UOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Away We Go</a>. Their friendship in the movie is what overall sells the story. And Wiig's blooming romance with Irish policeman Officer Rhodes (a likeable everyman Chris O'Dowd) does not get in the way of the overall story nor distract from it. If anything, it helps it along and I applaud writers Wiig and Annie Mumolo (who has a cameo as Wiig's neurotic flight co-passenger) for correctly balancing it all without a hitch, and a special shout-out to producer Judd Apatow and director Paul Feig (creator of ""Freaks and Geeks"") for having the wisdom to take on the story. This film attempts what I believe writer Nancy Pimental was trying to do when she wrote the 2002 Cameron Diaz stinker,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sweetest-Thing-Unrated-Edition/dp/B000069HYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sweetest Thing (Unrated Edition)</a>. Pimental was attempting to incorporate the gross-out humor of male comedy films such as ""Knocked Up,"" but also trying to make a touching female-bonding film. In my mind, Pimental, the director (Roger Kumble) and cast all failed. The film came off to me like some pathetic attempt at making women too much like guys. However, ""Bridesmaids"" balances the raunchy with the endearing with great success!

This film works for both sexes: women will LOVE to view it with girlfriends and men will love it for not having to roll their eyes! That's how downright funny and enjoyable this film is! The only thing I have to warn you about is that you may have to see it a second time just to catch the funny lines you missed from you (and the audience) laughing so loud and hard.",1308873600,3,4865,5.998561151079136

4592458,4,B0056IXS7S,"""Bridesmaids"" is a movie I somewhat reluctantly chose to see. I say ""reluctantly"" for two reasons - 1) as a guy I'm not into the ""chick flick"" or ""rom-com"" genres  and 2) the two leads (Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph) are both SNL veterans, and the sub-sub-mediocre Saturday Night Live lost all appeal to me a long time ago. However, a lady I recently started dating wanted me to pick a movie, and ""Bridesmaids"" seemed like the most promising of the dismal batch of movies currently showing in theaters. My ladyfriend kind of looked at me cross-eyed when I told her that's the movie I chose - ""Really? That doesn't seem like the kind of movie a guy would pick"". She was going solely by the title of the movie, though - I had done some internet research and knew that this movie had more up its sleeve than the title would imply. So, I hoped at least it wouldn't bore me to death.

We went and saw it last night, and as it turned out I was lucky enough to have picked a winner. ""Bridesmaids"" is a sendup of male-driven gross-out buddy movies and a romantic comedy, a mix that I thought wouldn't work very well. And indeed there are some themes in the movie that seem forced or contrived, and wear a bit thin as the surprisingly long comedy (2 hours, 5 minutes theatrical running time) unfolds. But Wiig, who I hadn't known of before because of my disassociation from SNL, carries the movie wonderfully. She effortlessly portrays Annie, a discontented mid-thirtysomething who has pretty much failed at life. Her life takes a wild turn when her best friend Lillian (Rudolph) asks her to be maid of honor at her wedding. Annie immediately runs afoul of Lillian's new friend Helen (Rose Byrne), who as the controlling, rich trophy wife of Lillian's fiance's boss, uses her money and passive-aggressive elitism to not only foil Annie at every turn, but to draw Lillian away from Annie as well. Every time Annie tries to regain an even footing with Helen and re-take control of the duties (and prestige) of maid of honor, Helen, and Annie's own self-destructive incompetence, stop her dead in her tracks - always with laugh-inducing results.

Not all the bridesmaid characters are fully fleshed-out in this movie, but they all do get their turn to contribute to the laughs. Bridesmaid Megan, boisterously portrayed by the in-your-face Melissa McCarthy, stole just about every scene she played a major role in. I was prepared to dislike her character based on her first appearance; at first it seemed like she was just cast to be the token, one-dimensional, overweight, plain, ""fart joke"" nobody in a group of otherwise prettier and more polished women. Megan has about as much class and sophistication as an ox in heat. However, as the movie progressed I began to like Megan a lot; in her totally unpolished and uncultured way she was the most honest, wise and forthright of the group. It's definitely worth watching a minute or two into the final credits, as Megan gets one more chance to shine her belching, flatulent light. For better or worse, the words ""bear sandwich"" will be indelibly seared into your mind after watching her final scene.

The movie's most talked-about scene, a vomit- and feces-fest where the bridesmaids go shopping for dresses at an incredibly upscale and snooty bridal boutique after getting food poisoning at a run-down Brazilian restaurant (a restaurant picked by Annie, naturally), is deliberately plunked into the middle of the movie by the director (Paul Feig) as an ode to every gross-out guy flick ever made. Yeah, it was funny in its slapstick, gross-out way, but I'm still debating whether that scene, drawn-out as it was, was totally necessary. It seemed to be artificially inserted in the movie. But what the hey, it got the laughs and ""e[...]"" audience reactions it was going for.

Wiig has a natural gift for physical comedy, and she demonstrates both the subtle and over-the-top aspects of this gift throughout. Her drunken attempts to sneak into first class on a flight to Las Vegas and subsequent run-ins with a prissy male flight attendant and the flight's air marshal are a gem. She's pretty, but in a down-to-earth way, and does not rely on her looks in the least to drive the film forward (other than using her wonderfully expressive face to convey her character's quirky, needy, flawed personality). ""Bridesmaids"" is Wiig's first cinematic star vehicle, and she did very well presenting us with a characterization of Annie as a character who is both sympathetic and humorous, both deeply human and clownish. I look forward to her next effort.

Overall, I consider this movie a winner. Obviously a lot of other people thought so as well; it has grossed over 100 million dollars after costing 32 million to make. My ladyfriend and I both enjoyed this movie greatly. Advice to the guys reading this review - ""Bridesmaids"" is worth your time because although the movie is a nuptial-themed female-driven endeavor, this movie definitely is not your typical chick-flick rom-com. I will be pre-ordering this from Amazon, for sure.",1308355200,7,5063,4.8271889400921655
4592459,5,B0056IXS7S,"I know I'm a little late on reviewing this one, I was going to just axe my review altogether. However, Bridesmaids is a film that is simply too good to be ignored. The reason for this is because it so easily could have been a bad movie. It could have been fake, and unrealistic, it could have featured paper-thin characters with no depth. It could have had a lousy script, with PG-13-friendly antics and adventures. It could've featured ridiculous product placement, and could have involved no realistic conflict, with an even more unrealistic conclusion.

However, it really doesn't do any of these things.

Bridesmaids has a great line of actresses that make the cut, in every possible way, and proves that women can truly be funny, instead of portraying them, as they easily could have, as whiny bitches. Kristen Wiig is a comedic genius. She co-writes the script, alongside Annie Mumolo (who appears in the film as a jittery passenger on a plane, look for her), and these two ladies bring a hell of alot to the table.

Kristen Wiig, while having written a beautifully nuanced script that's funny, yet relatable, and therefore, a bit sad, is the star of the show here. She plays Annie, a lovelorn, broke, and generally unhappy woman whose best friend is getting married, and asks her to be the maid of honor. Whilst dealing with the bizarre and expensive rituals that come with that duty, her life begins to unravel. Friends, love, work, and life, in general begin to blur, and the mistakes of her past become full circle. She's a genuine character, she's not a cliche. As are the rest of the woman in this terrific film.

Maya Rudolph (another SNL favourite) plays Wiig's best friend Lillian, who's in the middle of planning a wedding, and begins to drift from her lifelong best friend, Annie. Rose Byrne (who I love in Damages) has a surprisingly apparent comedic side, playing Helen, a member of the bridal party, who is Lillian's fianc&eacute;e's boss's wife (or something like that), and she is essentially the woman who's (possibly inadvertently) trying to destroy Annie and Lillian's friendship.

Wendi McLendon-Covey (of Reno 911! fame), gives a hilariously deadpan performance as Rita, a relative who is sarcastic, embittered, and generally dissatisfied in her marriage and resents her three sons. She clicks with Becca (Ellie Kemper, of The Office), a newlywed, who is extremely enthusiastic about becoming a wife and mother, who claims to have been ""so distraught"" when she was single.

Rounding out the bridal party is Melissa McCarthy (of Gilmore Girls, and now Mike & Molly) as Megan, the groom's sister. She's the oddball of the group, being decidedly more rough-around-the-edges as the rest of the ladies. While she appears to be for this movie, what Zach Gilifinakis was in The Hangover, she is given room, as are the rest of the ladies, to make exciting, complex, and rewarding characters. But McCarthy is probably the funniest one of the bunch.

It's already being referred to as the woman's answer to ""The Hangover"", or ""Hangover in Heels"", which I don't agree with. First of all, I didn't really like ""The Hangover"". For me, it was impossible to root for those four ass-wipes who weren't genuine, and felt cliched and ridiculous. While this film certainly has its crude sequences, it's more about friendship, and how to react to things that happen in life that are not ideal. It's about how a friendship can survive whatever punches that are thrown at it.

The fact that each of these ladies are given room to make great characters makes this film as good as it is. Given that they don't really whine, and they prove that women ARE funny, and can be hilarious, sets it apart from any other film like this, that has been made in the last decade. It also sets the bar for any R-rated American comedy to be released in 2011. Bring on the sequel.",1307923200,3,3866,4.803007518796992

It is a bit gross in parts, but mostly I felt like we've all been there, the friendships, the ""frienamies"" (people that pretend to be your friend but aren't) as with Helen and Annie, even the humiliating scenes between Kristin Wigg and Jon Hamm in bed!!  It was all too real and soo well done!!

Certainly a few have failed in films like Deuce Bigelow, The Ladies Man, and MacGruber.  Current female SNL player, Kristen Wiig, joins the ranks of the former with Bridesmaids, an occasionally gross, yet heartfelt tale of self worth and ultimately love.  After numerous supporting roles in popular films like Adventureland and Whip It, she has made the big leap into stardom, and she co-wrote the screenplay too!

Annie (Wiig) is an insecure, single woman working a miserable job at a jewelry store and whose love life consists of impersonal sexual romps with a narcissistic playboy (Jon Hamm).  Her dreams of a bakery having failed recently, she has horrible roommates and a doting mother (Jill Clayburgh) nearby.  When her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and asks her to be her bridesmaid, Annie prepares the female bridal party for gowns, showers, and the reception.  When Lillian's wealthy, `perfect' friend, Helen (Rose Byrne), elbows her way for attention and begins to take over the wedding preparations, Annie becomes jealous and overdoes things in a display of one-upsmanship (or rather womanship).  In a series of confrontational events, Annie sinks further into verbal ineptitude and embarrassment in front of her best friend.  Along the way she gets pulled over by an Irish cop, Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), who takes a fancy to her; what puzzles her is why any man would be nice to her?  It all culminates at a pre-wedding reception where Annie unleashes her anger and frustration. Things get worse for her at work and her apartment, and as her world comes crashing down and she becomes an outsider to her best friend's wedding, Annie's fate takes a dramatic turn amid friendship and love.

Audiences have been well aware of Wiig's physical and whimsical skills as a skit comedienne.  What this film does is show an entirely different spectrum of her abilities as an actress and writer (with Annie Mumolo directed by Paul Feig).  By playing a sympathetic character with flaws and yearnings and surrounding herself with a roster of talented actresses, Wiig has positioned herself as an every woman who has had life's ups and downs, but mostly downs and creating such pathos that the payoff at the end is more satisfying.  The scenes between Wiig and O'Dowd, who make a terrific couple, are genuine and really hold the story on a firm emotional footing.  As one of Lillian's friends, Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly) steals every scene she is in and provides the film with some of its funniest moments in support.  Even Byrne shines as the manipulative, scheming friend while Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey round out the wedding party.  As Annie's mom, Clayburgh performs a sweet, final career note; this was her last film.  Jon Hamm is only in a few scenes but is quite effective as a chauvinist jerk.

There are numerous funny moments.  A toast to Lillian and her fianc by Annie and Helen develops into dueling testimonials that become silly and outrageous.  When Annie gets stopped by a policeman, she displays her talent for physical comedy in conducting a drunk test.  A scene where she sits at her mom's home alone watching a video of Castaway's scene of Tom Hanks losing his `best friend' Wilson is a hoot.  On the plane when Annie mixes prescription medication and alcohol, she becomes obnoxiously and amusingly uninhibited, and there is a running gag with McCarthy who thinks her seat companion is really an air marshal.  Bridesmaids a film that is honest and direct about its subject matter and its consenting adults, and it has moments that are crude such as the food poisoning scene at the wedding boutique and some sexual gymnastics between Wiig and Hamm.

The film is a bit uneven in places but when it hits the right notes especially towards the end, when a major character like Annie undergoes a transformation, it feels genuine and at times heartfelt, and we are the beneficiaries of something more than a pedestrian comedy.  When her relationship with Lillian is threatened, Annie reacts in exaggerated, desperate behavior.  She even has trouble accepting true intimacy from a good man because she has never been treated so nice.  It's really about Annie being able to connect in a meaningful way with another human being.  In fact, Annie's plight and desperation shares its DNA with Bridget Jones's Diary.

With its predominantly female cast, this Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up) co-produced film delivers the laughs with feeling.  Don't think of this as just a `chick flick' but rather an entertaining, contemporary comedy that contains just a bit more estrogen.

4592477,4,B0056IXS7S,"The latest film from super-producer Judd Apatow seems out to prove that women can be just as funny, and raunchy, as men. Starring SNL-veteran Kristen Wiig (who also co-wrote the script with Annie Mumolo), Bridesmaids isn't much of a departure from other Apatow-produced comedies, containing the same improvisational, gross-out humor that typically characterizes his films, with the only difference being it has a cast lead by women. I saw the film in a theatre that was about 95% full, with about 85% women, and the other 10% husbands that were dragged to the show by their wives. There is a target audience for Bridesmaids and while it can be enjoyed by both sexes, the women laughed hysterically at every joke I didn't laugh at...Or perhaps it was just every joke. If you fall into this target audience, you may enjoy the film more than I did...And I actually quite enjoyed it.

Wiig plays Annie, whose personal life is in a state of turmoil. Her cake shop has gone under, leaving her to slave away at a jewelry store, she's low on money, and the only man in her life (an uncredited Jon Hamm, who, if you'll excuse the pun, is hamming it up and seems to be having fun) is a little too honest about their relationship status. In the midst of all this, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), Annie's friend since childhood, has recently become engaged and has asked Annie to be her Maid of Honor. She also selects four bridesmaids; Helen (Rose Byrne), Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), Becca (Ellie Kemper), and her fiance's sister Megan (Melissa McCarthy). Adding to Annie's personal troubles is her insecurity over Lillian's friendship with Helen, who takes charge of nearly all of the wedding details. Meanwhile, Annie meets a sweet Irish cop named Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) while the stress of Lillian's wedding piles on.

The six women that lead the ensemble each have a different style of humor that both fits in with and complements the film perfectly. There is, however, an unspoken and rarely discussed rule of ensemble comedies that dictate two things: (a) no less than one character will be underutilized, in this case Becca, the nave newlywed and (b) one character must stand-out from the rest due to the way they contrast with the main characters, in this case Megan, the odd, overweight sister of the groom. Each actress is very funny in her own way, with Wiig convincingly embodying Annie and scoring many laughs throughout. McLendon-Covey as Rita, an unsatisfied wife and mother, has a hilarious deadpan that seemed to really click with the audience. If I were to speculate I'd say that Rita touches on the things that mothers would never say out loud. The whole cast had me laughing at various points in the film, but it is McCarthy whom I would call my personal favorite and, in my eyes, is the star of the show.

I admit to being easily amused and I have found terrible comedies passable because of my lack-of-resistance to amusement. It's easy to make me smile, chuckle, or even laugh a little bit. What doesn't come easily to me is full-on, gut-busting, teary-eyed laughter. From the first moment McCarthy appears onscreen as Megan, she had me in tears and, to my surprise, this happened again and again nearly every time she appeared onscreen. Yes, she plays a character not unfamiliar to the world of comedy, but she brings such a unique charm and comedic presence to the role. There are moments with her character that are built on gross-out gags, but, shamefully, I laughed. In fact, McCarthy made me laugh harder than I can ever recall laughing in a theatre. This is not hyperbole; she had me in stitches.

The gross-out humor in Bridesmaids does not go anywhere we haven't seen men go in thousands of comedies over the years. There is one particular scene at a dress boutique that sent most of the theatre into riotous fits of laughter. I wonder to myself if Wiig included the scene to make a point about double-standards in film, as no one complains when men do the same thing in movies. Well, I do; I'm not a fan of humor that revolves around flatulence and bodily functions. To me, it's nothing more than lazy writing and, while my theatre seemed to place me in the minority, I found it more repulsive than funny. As, by Hollywood standards, the cast is made up of average-looking women (a good thing, as it's easier for an audience to connect with Wiig and Rudolph, who look like normal people), I do wonder if this scene would have elicited the same laughter from a cast of big-star, Hollywood bombshells. Either way, I would have no complaints about this scene being left on the cutting-room floor.

While the film starts off strong, I feel it loses steam in the second half when it veers towards a more dramatic route and becomes weighed down by its own seriousness. Apatow films seem to follow this template often; a first hour of non-stop hilarity and a second of turgid drama. I am being a bit rough on the dramatic elements here, as they have a good message and are essentially well handled, just not as effectively as the comedy. I attribute this to the writing; the comedy is improvisational and spontaneous, which leaves the dramatic stuff feeling more scripted. Annie's romance with the Irish cop, for example, is cute and sweet, but overly predictable. Fortunately, the film is kept consistently entertaining by this very talented group of women, but a little more consistency in the storytelling wouldn't have hurt.

It's not perfect and with a 125-minute running time (with trailers, you're looking at a theatre experience of 2 hours and 20 minutes) it could have been trimmed a bit in the editing room, but Bridesmaids is still one of the surprise comedies of the year. I knew women could be raunchy, but I doubted their ability to carry a raunchy comedy themselves. Wiig, (especially) McCarthy, and the rest of the girls outdo themselves, bringing both charm and consistent hilarity to the proceedings. Far exceeding my expectations, Bridesmaids is the funniest film I've seen this year.

4592481,4,B0056IXS7S,"Annie (Kristen Wiig, TV's ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Knocked-Up, ""MacGruber"") is going through a rough time; her bakery has closed, forcing her to take a job at a jewelers, she has move in with a creepy roommate (Matt Lucas, TV's ""Little Britain"") and his strange sister (Rebel Wilson), and she has a relationship with a rich guy (Jon Hamm) who seems to view her as more of a necessary tool to satisfy his sexual needs. Then, her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph, TV's ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Away We Go"", ""Shrek the Third"") announces she is engaged and wants Annie to be her Maid of Honor. At the engagement party, Annie meets Helen (Rose Byrne, TV's ""Damages""), the wife of Lillian's fiance's boss, and there is an instant competition between them. Because Annie is having such a difficult time with her finances, she tries to bluff her way through the increasingly expensive bridal party arrangements and plans. But the other women are determined to have some fun and spend some money. And every occasion seems marred by some difficulty.

Written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig (an actor with many credits and a Judd Apatow protg), ""Bridesmaids"" is a funny, funny film. Despite the moments of hilarity, some of which could be considered near brilliant, the film suffers from being too long, by at least a half hour, and this detracts from the overall quality.

Wiig is often the bright spot of any ""Saturday Night Live"" episode. The weekend this film opened, she was the star of a skit called ""Ann-Margaret Throws Away A Piece of Trash"". It appeared at the end of the show, but it was a physical, funny and slightly brilliant idea with a dead-on impersonation of Ann-Margaret, circa the late 60s. It was also short. Many of the skits on ""SNL"" suffer because they go on too long. Wiig and Mumolo have written a story to give Wiig's strengths a showcase. There are elements of all of Wiig's memorable characters in Annie and thankfully most have been toned down to make the film more believable and interesting.

But many of the scenes play out too long, beyond the funny parts, causing the film to drag. I realize they are trying to make a film about people we might really know, and want to infuse these characters with some humanity, but smaller doses of this world would have made the film seem funnier. It almost seems as though they couldn't decide if they wanted to make a comedy with some raunch, or if they wanted to make a romantic comedy with some funny moments.

The movie, produced by Judd Apatow, is being sold as a raunchy-female version of ""Knocked Up"" or ""The Hangover"". It doesn't deliver on this. There is one scene like this, and it's good, but there is just the one scene

Annie is played with a lot of heart. She and Laurie are great friends and have known each other for years. This is established quickly and allows us to witness this dynamic. When Laurie announces she is engaged, Annie is overjoyed but you can also see she is just a bit jealous. This is the beauty of Wiig. Much like Steve Carrel on ""The Office"", she is able to quickly reveal parts of her character while portraying something very different. When she hears the news, she is overjoyed but a subtle shift in her voice reveals the jealousy, and her competitive edge. Annie has a lot of different facets to her character and Wiig seems to not only embrace these, but to celebrate them.

Lillian's fiance lives and works in Chicago, so Annie makes the drive from Milwaukee to attend the lavish engagement party hosted by Helen (Byrne). This is an opportunity for Annie to meet all of Lillian's new friends. But she and Helen instantly begin competing against one another, using an evening toast to try to one-up each other.

Given Wiig is the star of the film, she naturally has the lion's share of screen time. But it is nice to see a couple of other characters really stand out. Some stand out for the wrong reasons. As soon as Maya Rudolph's Lillian announces her engagement, she becomes a straight man, trying to remain calm as so many things go wrong. It isn't the flashiest of roles, but it gets the job done. As she begins to take on the responsibility and stress of becoming a bride, her character becomes more and more serious, more of a mediator between Annie and Helen, more of a cheerleader to keep Annie happy.

Rose Byrne's Helen is a more complicated creation. She is necessary to provide the catalyst for Annie's insecurities, but if that were all she is, she would quickly become boring. During the engagement party, Annie's first glimpse of Helen seems pulled from a Grace Kelly film; Helen is tall, glamorous and turns towards her (us) in a way that makes Annie realize how pretty she is. Annie is more modest, wearing her best clothes, but they pale in comparison. And she is also dealing with the effects of the long drive, rumpled clothes and hair. Annie can't compete with Helen. When she feels she can, she tries, but Helen will always be able to outspend her. And Helen seems equally determined to compete with Annie for the one thing she can't buy - Lillian's BFF approval. It is nice to see the different levels of this character and the underhanded things she is willing to do to win the day.

Even though it is natural, given the narrative conventions, for Lillian to ignore Helen's actions, this helps to make Lillian's character seem more mediocre.

When Helen finally comes clean, it seems predictable and a little forced. It seems as though Wiig and Mumolo knew this moment had to come and worked hard to fit it in somewhere.

The real stand out of this group is Melissa McCarthy (TV's ""Mike and Molly"") who plays Megan, Dougie's sister and a de-facto bridesmaid. She is a stocky, manly woman who likes to deal with things matter-of-factly, providing a firm handshake, her wrist covered by a carpal tunnel bandage, and a straight word. At the engagement party, she wears slacks, a button down shirt and a little Kangol hat, covering most of her hair. It's almost a clich, but because she is the least acceptably ""desirable"", she is naturally the most sexually advanced of the group, the most outgoing, the most willing to try anything. She also consistently reveals new things about her character. Because she and Annie are the most different, Annie has the most trouble accepting her new friend. But she proves to be the most interesting of the bridesmaids.

The other bridesmaids, played by Ellie Kemper (TV's ""The Office"") and Wendi McLendon-Covey are the most forgettable. In fact, they seem to disappear completely for the last half of the film.

Annie's entire life is a mess, but the mess of her romantic perils takes center stage. She is in a relationship with a richer, better-looking man (Hamm) and their encounters are funny because they are so painful for Annie and we want to yell at her ""Are you crazy?"" Yet, she keeps coming back. After an evening of sex, which he seems to enjoy much more than she does, Annie leaves and tries to return to her car. But he hasn't opened his gate. Rather than face the indignation of returning to him, waking him up, and asking him, she tries to climb over. Just as she is about to slide over the top, the maid arrives and opens it with her clicker, Annie riding the gate like a mechanical bull.

Later, she meets Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd, ""Pirate Radio"", ""Gulliver's Travels (2009))"", a Minneapolis State Trooper, who pulls her over. They run into each other again, start talking and eventually go on a date. He really is quite charming, and exactly the type of guy Annie should be with. But all of the distractions in Annie's life cause her to flip out when he makes a sweet gesture and she shuts him out. Later, she needs his help and has to go to great lengths to get his existence.

""Bridesmaids"" is better written than most ""SNL"" comedies, most of which seem like a series of extended skits. But it does occasionally feel episodic: Engagement party, Bridesmaids have lunch, Try on gowns, Trip to Vegas, Bridal shower, Wedding. Each of these is funny to varying degrees. But when each of these set-ups ends, there are the 'in-between' scenes, the moments meant to move the narrative along and connect the dots. While well written, they are less funny and slow the entire film down. The best of these are the moments between Annie and her two lovers, because we all know people who are in the same situation and Annie seems to make the same choices they do, both good and bad. With Hamm's character, they are funnier, but with O'Dowd's character they are sweeter, more romantic and even a little charming.

Three scenes really stand out for their comedic value. The engagement party which ends with the never-ending dueling toasts has another funny joke running throughout. Even during the toasts, when the scene seems to be going on forever and ever and ever, we start laughing for that very reason. Neither woman is willing to give up because to do so would give the other woman the upper hand.

Later, Annie gets the bridal party to go to lunch at a Brazilian chiaroscuro. Despite the dubious appearance, they decide to go ahead at Lillian's urging. Everyone digs into the plethora of meats wholeheartedly. These moments pay off later when they try on gowns at a super-chic, expensive boutique.

The bridesmaids decide they want to party in Vegas, despite Annie suggesting a more modest, local idea. Annie buys a coach ticket; everyone else splurges on First Class. As soon as Annie sits down, she starts to freak out because she is afraid of planes. Annie runs up to First Class to talk to Lillian. Helen quickly gives Annie some pills to calm her down. Everything escalates from there.

The trip to Vegas is particularly good, well-written, funny and memorable. But it takes place about half way through the film. When it is over, the rest of the film is noticeably less funny and seems a bit long. It is still a good film, fun to watch, but it almost seems like a different film.

""Bridesmaids"" is very good, if uneven. You should definitely check it out. I get the feeling this is the first of many memorable examples of Kristen Wiig's comedy we will get to see on the big screen.",1306108800,,10178,4.647026125625348

4592483,5,B0056IXS7S,"The last time I watched a movie with female protagonists that stayed with me was 'Kill Bill'. I love 'Kill Bill'. I think that I may have watched both of the 'Kill Bill' movies at least 50 times each, and when basic cable plays a rerun of the 'Kill Bill' movies, I always make it a point to tune in. There is so much going on in the 'Kill Bill' movies.  There are themes of adventure, action, romance, violence and revenge; and what makes 'Kill Bill' so enthralling is that all of the female protagonists who populate this movie are expertly used by Tarantino to explore the above stated themes. I have seen many movies that use male leads to flesh out characters in action movies, and because males have been used so many times in this genre of films, watching them has become sort of redundant. But watching 'Kill Bill' for the first time was a revelatory experience, because for the first time in my life I was watching an American action revenge film that exhibited a woman experiencing the feelings associated with adventure, action, romance, violence, and revenge.  Some people may say that 'Kill Bill' was not a revolutionary film, as there were many Asian films that came before 'Kill Bill' in which a strong female protagonist was required to fulfill the requirements of an action heroine who was expertly skilled in martial arts. But 'Kill Bill' was a revolutionary film because pretty American actresses were inhabiting roles that were usually reserved for Asian female actresses in China, Korea, and Japan.

A woman who excels in the role of a martial arts action hero means a lot more to me than a male who excels in the same role. Maybe its a little bit sexist, but when a woman uses her martial arts skill to eradicate an enemy it sets of something inside me. In American film and television, there are few roles for women that allow them to kick ass while navigating the emotional ups and downs of the lives of these women. Aside from the Beatrix Kiddo character in 'Kill Bill', the only other female action hero themed movie or television show I know of is 'Nikita'. Beatrix Kiddo and the lady from 'Nikita' have showed everyone that a female martial arts hero can be more effective than a male in the same genre if the show is done right.

Effective female driven raunch comedies are also few in number. I cannot recall any from memory. Most of the female driven comedies that have saturated our culture are romantic comedies, and all of them have sucked over the years. As a result, female driven comedic movies had become somewhat of an anathema to me. No matter who has been cast in these female comedies, I've made it a point to avoid all of them. So when the commercials for 'Bridesmaids' started to air on television, I was very skeptical.  But as the time for the release of the movie inched closer, I began to pay attention to all of the reviews on rottentomatoes.com. Most of these reviews were stellar, and the disappointment that was 'Thor' finally pushed me over the edge to 'Bridesmaids'. I watched the movie today, and I am so glad I did.

Many people want to compare 'Bridesmaids' to the 'Hangover', but these are very different films.  Although 'Hangover' is a film that is ostensibly about friendship, its premise is built upon debauchery. 'Bridesmaids' is not a film that focuses on debauchery. There are plenty of gross out moments in 'Bridesmaids', but they are just moments.  Unlike the guys in 'Hangover', these women do not travel to a city where they drink themselves into oblivion. Nope. This movie examines the lifelong relationship between two women, Lilian(played by Maya Rudolph)and Annie(played by Kristen Wiig)whose once strong friendship is threatened by a new character(played by Rose Byrne) as the wedding of Lilian approaches.

Kristen Whig's character is suffering through a life crisis. She dates a man(played by John Hamm)who affectionately refers to Kristen Wiig's character as his number three; her baking business failed and she is without job; she lives with her mother; her car is broken down; and her friendship with Mya Rudolph's character is threatened by Rose Byrne's character.  All of these problems make Kristen Whig's character lose her mind at the bridal shower, and her already fracturing relationship with her best friend is nearly pulled asunder.
With the help of a friendly police offer and and a hilarious bridesmaid(played by Melissa McCarthy), Annie is able to overcome her existential crisis and become a better and stronger person.

All of the principle actresses in the movie are wonderful in their roles, especially Melissa McCarthy. She is really, really damn funny in this movie. Kristen Wiig's and Maya Rudolph's performances in the film convince the movie goer of the plausibility of their friendship, and Rose Bryne is really good as the conniving new 'friend'.

Now, although this is a movie that features a female cast, everyone who has the pleasure of watching this film will be able to relate to the characters. And fellas, let me tell you this: if you choose to attend this movie, you will laugh out loud with the audience.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for entertainment that just makes you laugh.  And do keep an eye on the actress playing Megan, she is hysterical.

8459688,1,B0056IXS7S,"I really hate this movie.  I think Kristen Wiig was funny on SNL but I have hated most of her movies.  I did like her in The Martian and Whip It but she had small roles which were more serious rather than comedic. There are so many parts of this more that I felt were depressing and painful to watch, not funny at all. My friend rented this for girls night and I groaned when I saw what she had picked.  You would have to pay me a lot to watch this again.",1529452800,,455,3.870967741935484
