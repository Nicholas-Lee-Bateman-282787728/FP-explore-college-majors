8556591,2,B00AQQGWLE,"Having watched Glenn Vilppu's gesture drawing video from chapter 1 of his drawing manual series and gaining a deeper understanding with each viewing, I looked forward to a having similar experience with Mr. Bosson's video, only to be very disappointed with it.  I found the video to be more of an exhibition of Mr. Bosson's drawing ability than it was instructive.  Mr. Bosson makes comments and pointers about gesture and then he displays his drawing prowess without giving any explanations of what he's doing as he does it.  He says that gesture isn't preoccupied with the model's contours and then he proceeds to make drawings that feature them.  At no time does he show the reference copy he used to make the drawings, so how are we to interpret gesture from an actual pose?  I found his approach to be lacking in substance.  If you wish to watch an accomplished artist making gesture drawings, buy Mr. Bosson's video but, if you're looking for drawing instruction, pass it by and check out Glenn Vilppu's extraordinary teaching ability.  I'm returning this video and spending my refund on more of the many outstanding drawing instruction products offered by Glenn Vilppu.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-VILPPU-DRAWING-MANUAL/dp/B002I287Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE VILPPU DRAWING MANUAL</a>",1374710400,8,1342,5.58128078817734
