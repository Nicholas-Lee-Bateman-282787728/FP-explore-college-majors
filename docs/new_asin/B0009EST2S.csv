8218339,5,B0009EST2S,"This appears to be a rerelease of the A side of the double feature ""Bedtime Stories/Diary of Seduction"" DVD. It sounds like it has the same content, so I can address that in this review.

""Bedtime Stories"" was a late night cable TV series. This DVD contains three episodes: ""Blind Fold"", ""First Love"", and ""The Rival"". The stories all center around a brothel run by Kim Dawson. Women come to her to get help for problems with their sex life. It's almost identical to the types of stories contained in Mainline's ""Secrets of the Kama Sutra"" releases and is produced by the same people responsible for those stories. And like ""Secrets"", the stories aren't really that interesting, but deliver plenty of well done sex scenes.

There are a total of eleven sex scenes. Five are boy/girl. Two are boy/girl, with another girl watching and providing her own entertainment. One is boy/girl/girl. One is girl solo. Two are girl/girl. The women are beautiful and include several softcore A listers: Kim Dawson, Gabriella Hall, Flower, Taimie Hannum, and Samantha Phillips.

As I stated above, this is a rerelease, and a higher priced one at that. In addition, the original release wasn't just the ""Bedtime Stories"" episodes. There was also a movie (although not a very good one) on the B side. There may be some copies of the original release still available at the original, lower price.

However, even at the new price, I still recommend this one.",1114992000,7,1438,4.833333333333333
