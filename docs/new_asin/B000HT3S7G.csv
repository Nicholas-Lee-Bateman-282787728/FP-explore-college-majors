This is a cardio fusion - sort of mind and body - strecthing and toning rolled into one.  It's not a hardcore cardio workout.  I really enjoy Ellen Barretts barefoot workouts and wanted to add some variety.  This is a great workout when you just want to unwind and stretch and tone your muscles with some light cardio sprinkled in.  You will feel renewed and relaxed and will have stretched and toned you muscles.

So, if you are looking for heavy cardio this is not for you.  This is definitely a workout you would do on a lighter day - but it's great to mix this in with your regular cardio and weight routines to really elongate those muscles.

If you enjoy Ellen Barretts barefoot cardio videos you will enjoy this one as well.",1330300800,8,821,4.4630872483221475
8141379,3,B000HT3S7G,"I got this because I wanted a video with some flowing, gentle cardio. On that count, it totally fails. It's not a cardio workout, it's twenty minute of warmup. Seriously, when it comes to cardio I usually have to force myself (kicking and screaming) to work any harder than a brisk walk would be, and I found this laughably easy. You can't even blame it on being a barefoot, low-impact workout. There are plenty of moves that, if strung together without endless slow taps or plies in between, could have made for a pleasantly invigorating sequence. But instead, every time I felt I was actually working, it was back to standing around barely doing anything. I can't even recommend it to seriously out-of-shape friends who might actually find the energy level appropriate, because it still demands plenty of coordination and balance.

The other sections are useful, but unremarkable- plenty of similar stuff out there, but since I have it I guess I'll use them from time to time when I don't have time for a 45 minutes Ellen Barret video. I got this used for cheap, so I'm not too upset about it.",1297728000,3,1095,4.6735751295336785
8141380,5,B000HT3S7G,"This is in a beautiful outdoor spa-like setting. She has 2 background girls-one modifies a bit. Tracey is more subdued and toned-down in this workout. I am glad, because it is a relaxing and rejuvinating routine. It starts with a yoga warm-up, then onto a flowy, light, barefoot cardio segment to get everything loosened up and warmed-up. Next-upper body Pilates routines using light weights-I used 3lb. Then onto total body toning for abs and lower body. This was a very rejuvinating routine-not at all meant to be a hard-core cardio and weight circut for sure! You will like this if you like Ellen Barrett workouts or the new ballet/barre/yoga/pilates fusion workouts. I was afraid to try another Tracey Mallett workout after her QuickBlast workouts-she seemed so frantic and hyper and her voice was like nails on a chalk-board. I am glad I tried this one finally. I am into these type of routines lately. She did a good job and was very mellow in this routine! I cannot wait for her upcoming Booty Barre workout!",1287705600,9,1015,4.805714285714286
8141381,1,B000HT3S7G,"This has to be the most worthless workout I've ever done. I'm mad for wasting my precious workout time on this but am glad that I only rented it. I never felt the urge to turn it off more than with this one and I'm a workout DVD addict. The cardio portion is an absolute joke. A few taps and stretches that's it. I think a Leslie Sansone warmup is more challenging. She is barefoot throughout, that should be a clue that there is no cardiovascular challenge. I felt completely unsatisfied after this workout, my heart rate was never elevated and I never broke a sweat.",1222992000,4,568,4.367924528301887
8141382,4,B000HT3S7G,"In this 55 minute workout, you'll sweat quite a bit.  I like it - it's a good low impact workout with easy to follow routines.  Tracey is a good instructor.  She's enthusiastic and motivating which I like.
You do the aerobics barefoot and it flows really well.  It's dancey, but in a good way - not complicated.  Then there is yoga type toning and you use weights to work more than one muscle group at once.  It makes it a little different from other workouts I've done and the fact that it's set outdoors is a nice change of pace and makes it fresh.  In this dvd you will get a full body workout and feel good for it afterwards.  This is a great workout for beginners because it's not too intimidating and it's very easy to follow.  I like it and think you will too.",1165449600,17,767,4.198630136986301
