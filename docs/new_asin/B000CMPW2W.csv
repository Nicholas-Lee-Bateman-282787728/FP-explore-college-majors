2465449,5,B000CMPW2W,Love having this wonderful old tearjerker. This has always been my favorite version of the story. Margaret Sullavan is just perfect and so is Boyer.,1354665600,3,148,4.96
2465450,5,B000CMPW2W,"This is one of my very favorite movies, Charles Boyer and Margaret Sullivan give outstanding performance and this version gives you more details and a clearer picture of what can go wrong with your hopes and dreams when someone interferes with your life. It is, in my opinion, much better than the later version with Susan Hayward.  I have been looking for this movie for a very long time and I do hope that one day I am able to find it.

Also I am particularly fond of black and white films.  They are real and the photography is excellent together with the lighting.  They seem to tell the story much better, almost like reading a good book.",1305590400,19,643,4.423728813559322
2465451,5,B000CMPW2W,"This is a wonderful version - I prefer this touching story then the 1961 version with Susan Hayward.  If you enjoy a good cry, your heart will give you one....  I wish I could find a copy of this movie, I haven't seen it in years... but it remains a favorite.",1235865600,11,259,4.0588235294117645
2465452,5,B000CMPW2W,I've always loved this old movie....it reminds me of one of my girlfriends years ago.  I could watch it over and over again.,1406246400,,124,4.391304347826087
2465453,3,B000CMPW2W,"I couldn't remember which of the two versions I watched years ago and wanted to watch again.  I had a 50/50 chance of ordering the right one.  I ordered the wrong one but the story line is the same and I enjoyed this movie none the less. Now I will order the other one,",1404000000,2,269,3.962962962962963
2465454,5,B000CMPW2W,"Charles Boyer & Margaret Sullivan act up a storm in this wonderful old movie. I prefer the ""old"" movies because they are not filled with foul language, steamy-in-your-face sex scenes, crazy camera movements, ear deafening noise. these oldies don't rely on super fast action to try to keep you interested... they actually tell a story! and this is a story beautifully told. don't let the horrid cover on Back Street fool you into thinking this is a cheap, crummy movie... far from it! Back Street tells of a love that cannot be denied... of the consequences of missed opportunities... and missed communications. it bespeaks the honor of one man and the strength of the woman who loves him. life throws you curve balls and this movie speaks of the courage required to adjust.",1400976000,5,773,4.819548872180451

2465458,5,B000CMPW2W,This is a very fine film beautifully acted by Margaret Sullavan and Charles Boyer and fine directing by Robert Stevenson--a very finely structured film from the days when many fine films were produced.,1369440000,,201,5.121212121212121
2465459,5,B000CMPW2W,"What a delightful film.
They sure knew how to make them n the 40's. Main actors did a superb protrayal of love absentee.
Delightful how quirk of fate alters lives.",1369267200,3,163,4.466666666666667
2465460,5,B000CMPW2W,i was glad I was able to find this old movie. I was searching one and there it was. I will always cherish Back Street,1368489600,,117,3.72
2465461,4,B000CMPW2W,"This movie has been done three times, Margaret Sullavan, Irene Dunne, and the great Susan Hayward. The story is similar, but not one compares with Susan Hayward's version. I got this one simply to compare it to Irene Dunne and Margaret Sullavan. It is a good story for comparison of the other two. Good story and a great plot. I still prefer Susan Hayward's version best of all in living color.

8099224,5,B000CMPW2W,This is one of my favorite movies a real tear jerker. It is also the 2nd version of this story first done in 1932 with Irene Dunne and then in the sixties with Susan Hayward. I like the 1942 version better.,1483833600,,206,4.048780487804878

8099229,5,B000CMPW2W,"Tearjerker!! This was my mom's favorite movie and I can see why she liked it so much. Great story, great acting by all. Don't miss this oldie. It far surpasses the garbage movies of today.",1440201600,,188,4.4
8099230,5,B000CMPW2W,"Holds up well and offers fine performances from Charles Boyer, Margaret Sullavan and Tim Holt.  Concentrates on a turn-of-the-century ""affair""
between a prominent banker and a prim young woman from middle-class society.  Emotionally on-target and thought provoking.  The relationship
between the two central characters endures until their deaths and the final scenes are most touching and still highly effective.  Fine performance
by Tim Holt as the indignant son of Boyer who attempts to end the relationship of years and ultimately in the end becomes sympathetic and
understanding...finally realizing the extent of the real love that the two people had for each other.  Superb on all levels.  A true classic!  Far
superior to the later remake with Susan Hayward.",1430352000,,764,5.423728813559322
