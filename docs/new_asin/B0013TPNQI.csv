8252829,3,B0013TPNQI,This dvd is really just watching an artist talk draw and talk about his creative process.  Just a decent reference material at best,1390521600,,131,4.695652173913044
8252830,5,B0013TPNQI,Nice DVD and very informative. Learned some great tips. I've watched the DVD twice now and picked up another good idea on the second viewing.,1378684800,,141,4.68
8252831,5,B0013TPNQI,"I don't usually review anything on here but with this I felt I needed to cast my point of view because in my opinion this is a very good product.

Firstly, before you buy this I would recommend the other 3 DvDs by David Finch about how to draw the body, hands & feet and the human head.  Because this DvD brings all that together.  So if you're starting out on trying to draw comics I would say this DvD is for the more advanced student.

What I appreciate about David Finch is not so much his amazing art skills, it's more how he describes, or tries to describe the mental process of drawing, which for someone with his experience is pretty much gone into unconscious competence now and is probably very difficult to put into words.  For the most part he suceeds in doing this.

I also like how David exposes some of his insecurities when he is drawing, admitting there are times he is just making it up as he goes along and sometimes commiting to an idea and later not being happy with it at all.  I found this very refreshing because when you read so many comic art books you may get the impression that every detail is planned and the artist is happy with it.  This thinking often made my drawings become stale and lifeless, but David leaves a lot of room to be spontanious so I am glad I can go back to my old creative ways.",1310256000,4,1329,4.225296442687747
8252832,4,B0013TPNQI,"First off let me say I'm a huge David Finch fan. I've already purchased and reviewed two other Gnomon DVD's by  him ( Dynamic Figure Drawing: The head and Dynamic Figure Drawing: The Body). Both of which were exemplary. This one, however, fell a little short.
  The video is over two hours long and that is something considering it is played at high speed and is edited for content. There is a considerable amount of detail in this particular drawing so I'm sure it took him a long time to complete. David starts by laying out the drawing but this very important stage is only lightly covered and then he jumps straight into the drawing. I was hoping for more in this section as it is the one I struggle with the most. David narrates as he draws, trying to explain the how and why. Early on he begins to struggle with the face of the woman and ends up adding corrections later on. I love this. I think it is encouraging to see an incredible artist like David struggling with something. It gives me hope and helps me feel better about some of my own personal struggles. The middle of the DVD bogged down some with him detailing the drawing but I enjoyed watching it. I was hoping for more explanation of the rendering process. He does provide some it just seemed a little light to me. The real treat to me was when he began his background. As he begins, he is not sure what he's going to put in the background and just creates it on the fly. I was impressed. It was great to watch but he only briefly mentioned the use of a perspective grid. I would have prefered more instruction in that area. One more con to this DVD is the price tag. It is higher than his other videos and has, in my opinion, less valuable instruction.
  One thing to keep in mind is that David made this DVD at Gnomon. He lacked some of his regular tools and rescources and still created a beatiful piece of art. I recommend this video if you want to see a great comic page created from start to finish but if you want figure drawing instruction you need his other videos.",1293753600,2,2043,4.296103896103896
8252833,3,B0013TPNQI,"If you want a good tutorial in so far as explanation of process then get the one by Stephen Platt.

Although David draws great this video is mainly of him drawing and trying to explain what he's drawing and how except, well he doesn't even know.

Not very good for up and coming artists who want to learn.  It's more just a show to watch someone draw.  To become a solid artist in illustration you need to know the hows and whys behind a creation and this video falls short of that.",1279324800,8,482,4.206521739130435
8252834,5,B0013TPNQI,A look into the mind of David Finch as he does his stuff is amazing. He's top of his game. An Excellent dvd & a must for all artist aspiring & pros. I'm an artist too so & learnt alot from some of the techniques but I won't go into detail. A must is what I can say. 5 stars!,1279152000,,274,3.5833333333333335
