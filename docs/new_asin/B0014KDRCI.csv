8306836,5,B0014KDRCI,"I'm very pleased with this series.  Mr. Wickman really has an effective method for showing a real estate salesperson how to speak with the owners of a property.  This is not a course in high pressure sales, but rather a means of describing the problems associated with selling a property (problem stacking) as support for the services of a professional to represent the owners interests.  It's just good stuff and well worth the money.",1205712000,2,435,4.851351351351352
