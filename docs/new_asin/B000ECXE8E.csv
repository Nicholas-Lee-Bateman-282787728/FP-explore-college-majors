8108402,5,B000ECXE8E,"First of all, this DVD is in the PAL format, used in France and other places, but not the standard in the USA, which is NTSC.  Most computers have no problem playing PAL and many portable DVD players also support PAL, but most region one component DVD players cannot play this and if you try you will get an error message.  If you have a high definition TV with a PC hookup, it shouldn't make much of a difference to you.
The DVD includes a ballet in tribute to Jacques Brel and Barbara(No, not Barbara Streisand but the French cabaret singer, songwriter, and actress known only as Barbara. Her real name was Monique Serf.)  Both Brel(Belgian) and Barbara(French) were singers in the cabaret style, very popular and beloved in the mid to late twentieth century, in France, Belgium and beyond. Many of the songs featured here are also familiar to American audiences, since most of Brel's and some of Barbara's music is well known here. The part of Brel is danced by Gil Roman(who looks very much like Nureyev!) and the part of Barbara is danced by Elisabet Ros.  The choreography is very interesting and typically Bejart--a combination of classical ballet, modern dance, and a bit of the avant-garde. The rest of the dancers are from Bejart's Ballet Company, which includes some of the greatest dancers in the business. The DVD also includes a documentary in French with English subtitles about Brel and Barbara and the making of the ballet. The ballet is 52 minutes long as is the documentary, so there is plenty to see for your money. The image(16/9) and sound(5.1 Dolby Digital, 5.1 DTS, and Dolby Stereo) are first class. This is recommended for all interested in contemporary Belgian/French ballet, as well as Belgian/French cabaret music.",1205884800,11,1743,4.8193979933110365
