The guy that plays Stifflers brother is quite good, maybe a bit to good, instead of playing his brother he comes across as trying to act EXACTLY like Stiffler.

There are some shots of Tad in various states of undress, but never enough. I can't find any more DVDs of tad unclad.

2439801,4,B000BT971I,"If you liked the previous American Pie movies, and thought Stifler stole every scene in which he uttered vulgarity, then you'll probably love this movie.  I laughed over and over, despite the ridiculousness of some scenes and the contrived setup of sending a Stifler to band camp.  About that...

Matt Stifler (Tad Hilgenbrink), the original's younger brother, got into too much trouble on the eve of his senior year with a giant prank played against the outgoing senior class, and the guidance counselor (The Sherminator from the originals) sentences him to a summer at band camp.  His female arch nemesis Elyse (Arielle Kebbel) just happens to be the band leader at this camp.

The predictable ensues - trouble, strife, understanding, camaraderie, triumph - leading to the final battle between the Stifler/Elyse band and the local rich kid band.  Along the way Matt uses some recently purchased spy gear to record ""Bandies Gone Wild,"" video proof of all the wild rumors of band camp (i.e. ""This one time, at band camp..."").

The best part about this movie is the two leads.  First and foremost, Tad Hilgenbrink is PERFECT.  I checked IMDB while watching the movie to see if he was actually related to Sean William Scott.  I'm still convinced he's a second cousin or something.  Arielle Kebbel is absolutely gorgeous and perfect for the over-achieving role.  Despite the fact that none of the originals returned, Eugene Levy stuck around for the paycheck.

Unless you've never heard of the American Pie series - if so, welcome to Earth - this should come as no surprise.  It's racy, crude, filled with sex and nudity, and exactly what's expected.

2439804,5,B000BT971I,"""American Pie: Band Camp"" is the fourth film in the ""American Pie"" franchise, and although it was released directly to DVD it is a fun and hilarious tenn romp filled with sex jokes, gorgeous girls, breathtaking men, and funny lines. This time around the movie focuses on Stifller's younger brother who spends a summer at a band camp. There he encounters some new friends, both male and female, with the laughs being a mile a minute. This is your typical teen comedy made for laughs and sheer enjoyment. The DVD is filled with bonuses including outtakes, deleted scnes, interviews, and more. This film was followed by the next ""American Pie"" movie called ""The Naked Mile"".",1264377600,,671,4.843478260869565
2439805,5,B000BT971I,I've watched all of them and this one probably had the best story line. Not quite as much T and A as the naked mile...but you'll still get an eye full. And Miss Florida Arielle Kebbel is hot,1264118400,,190,4.026315789473684
2439806,4,B000BT971I,"The gang we've all come to know from the American Pie trilogy has left to pursue their lives. With one door closing, another opens. Stifler is still at it in the 4th installment, though it aint the Stifler you think it is. Instead of Steve, we have Matt Stifler, the younger brother who is all grown up now and heading into his summer break of his junior year of high school. The school is having is having a ceremony for the seniors as a last goodbye. The school band is there to play, but Stifler has other ideas. Stifler's little prank goes a little haywire which causes him to get into some trouble. His penalty?... To go to band camp and learn to be a team player. Trying to turn a negative into a positive, Matt decides to buy spy gear and spy on his new found camp goers to catch them doing some dirty acts with one another. Just Stifler being a Stifler.

I really liked Band Camp and think it was a decent installment to the series. Sure it's got a lower budget and a no name cast, but it does feel like a Pie movie. Actually, it could've been called Band Camp without the American Pie name and it probably wouldn't get nearly the heat it gets. While American Wedding tried and failed (in my opinion) to make Steve seem kind of likeable in the end, Band Camp does give you hope for Matt. In the beginning, Matt is a total jerk who doesn't want nothing more than to be like his older brother Steve. Through the movie though, you can see him beginning to become less of a jerk and more of an okay friend to hopefully one day an ok guy. It was nice to see him begin to stick up to his friends, while at the same time still being `himself'. He still liked to play the pranks and he still liked to get the girls, but he stopped with worrying about what some people thought about him.

As for the jokes and nudity, there is an abundance. I laughed at a lot of the scenes, even the dumb ones. I couldn't help it. Maybe it's cause I didn't take the movie serious when going into it. I actually thought it was going to be really bad, but was definitely surprised. Everything from the oboe scene to the special sunscreen I liked. And there were plenty of boob shots thanks to the spy cams. And for you girls, Matt loves to show off his butt.

Also there are even some nice scenes for you love doves out there. It was kind a funny to see one of the nerdy guys who became Matt's first friend at camp trying to get with the bad girl of the group. And there was one scene that I liked that had two people on a dock. It was sweet. Yeah I said it. Do something.

In the end I would say it's a worthy addition to the Pie family. It's American Pie guys, it's not supposed to be real. Even the first three movies were fake as heck also. Give it a try if you haven't.

P.S. - Arielle Kebbel is so so so yummy.",1237939200,,2797,4.1060329067641685

2439810,1,B000BT971I,"This movie isn't just bad. Its really, REALLY bad. Horrible, in fact.

When I first saw this movie on the shelf at the movie store, I couldn't help but laugh. And to those of you who were giving crap to the people that reviewed this movie without even bothering to watch it first, well....can you blame them? I mean honestly. There is a reason why some movies don't make it to the theatre, and go straight to DVD. And this movie would be a great example of why that happens.

Now, ill agree with some of you who say that ""American Wedding"" wasn't very good. In fact, it was a pretty big disappointment. I feel that they should have stopped making these movies after ""american pie 2"" but I definitely wouldn't go so far as to say that it was worse than this movie. Because there is no comparison whatsoever. Atleast ""american wedding"" still had a few good laughs, and there was an actual point to that movie, not to mention that it still had most of the original cast in it.

Anyway, I happened to come across this movie a few nights ago when they showed it on TBS after Sex and the City. I decided to watch it, just to see if it was as bad as I figured it would be. But I was wrong. Because it was WORSE than I thought. Its not even funny in a stupid way. Its just plain stupid. The guy who plays Stiflers younger brother is a really bad actor. I thought he resembled the actual Stifler....for about two seconds. He tries waaaaay too hard to impersonate him, especially when he tries to annoyingly imitate Stiflers facial expressions. Its painful to see. And come on....his punishment after the prank he played on his high school's band is to be sent to band camp? Right.

Seriously. I advise you, do NOT waste your money on this movie. At the very least, if your curiousity gets the best of you, wait until it shows on TV, otherwise, just pass it up entirely.",1212796800,,1860,4.320916905444126

Touching in the end (as all Pie films have been) but always hilarious from start to finish, Band Camp is crude humor at its finest.",1188172800,2,513,4.752808988764045

2439814,3,B000BT971I,"Although based on characters from American Pie, Eugene Levy is the only true common factor between this and the American Pie movies.  Stiffler's younger brother, who in no way seems to be a grown-up version of the kid we saw in American Pie 2, has been sentenced to Band Camp after playing a public practical joke on the school band.  Unlike in the American Pie movies, the lead is not the good guy.  Stiffler decides to use spy equipment to film the girls of band camp and try and outdo his older brother's video business.

Once at camp he meets Levy who is the camp's moral director (not morale).  Stiffler obviously does not want to be at the camp but he revels in the spying.  Soon he learns he can get further by pretending to befriend everyone.  Everything is movie toward a competition between the camp's bands and a possible love interest between Stiffler and his band leader.  Well, the film tries to get you to like Stiffler but he is a real jerk for almost the entire film.

If you like the American Pie movies for the raciness, sexuality or nudity, then you will probably like this one.  If, however, you like all the features of American Pie that are not common to teen sex comedies, you won't find them here.  I had expected better from anything that had the American Pie label but it seems the franchise sold out with this one.  The best thing about the film was an extra involving a sexual education video using fruit instead of anatomy.  Otherwise it was pretty standard fare.",1168473600,3,1493,4.5055762081784385

It's not up to the quality of the other REAL American Pie movies but it's far from the worst.  But I admit it, I like most teen movies.

But the plot is based on Stiflers younger brother Matt, who is aspiring to be like his older brother by making adult movies. Unfortunatly his antics plunge him into the school councillors office where the councillor is played by an old cast member ""Shermminator"", in which he sends Matt off to band camp as punishment.

Making the most of his oppertunity, Matt arrives at Band camp to the dislike of the rest of his band members and sets up a string of hidden cameras to catch all the so called ""action"" that takes place after the lights go out! But distractions happen when he bumps into an old high school flame... and the plot takes the ever obvious path of love, hate and a happy ending with some comical happenings in between! Jim's Dad also makes an apperance as the Band camp macro (regulator).

This movie focuses on the character Matt Stifler, younger brother of Steve Stifler (from the previous American Pie films).  He is sent to band camp as punishment for a practical joke he committed.  He purchases a bunch of spy equipment in an effort to film a ""Girls Gone Wild"" style video of the band geeks (we find out his older brother has become famous doing this).  He ends up falling in love with one of the band girls and ultimately becomes a good guy.

Not surprisingly, the plot has worn rather thin.  This was already evident in American Wedding and only got worse this time around.  However, that said, I found the movie to be rather entertaining and charming.  It has enough gags to entertain us guys and has a genuine love story to appeal to girls.  Personally, I enjoyed both aspects.  However, I truly hope this is the end of the series.",1142380800,,1267,4.623318385650224

Unlike a lot of people, I actually liked American Pie 2 more than the original American Pie (although the original is what brought the word ""milf"" into the American lexicon). But American Wedding was pretty okay; not only had most of the jokes already run their course (especially the scenes with Stifler's mom or ANYthing Stifler-related), but most of the main cast weren't even in the movie. The latter aspect is also evident in the straight-to-video release Band Camp.

I see where other reviewers are coming from when they say that this movie feels more like a spin-off (or maybe a crossover) than a sequel, and I also think that Sarah Borkowski's review is pretty on-point. This movie introduces Tad Hilgenbrinck as Steve Stifler's younger brother Matt Stifler, and that alone shows a continuity errors: in the first two movies, Steve's brother's name was never mentioned; plus, he was played by Eli Marienthal. I think Tad only got the job because he looks so much like Seann William Scott. Before I forget, though, here's a forewarning to the guys: if all you're looking for in this movie is gratuitous nudity, you won't find it here. In fact, you see more of Tad's a** than anything else.

Anyway, on to the movie. Matt and his pals are planning to prank the band geeks at his high school because Matt wants badly to follow in his brother's footsteps. The latest prank has him sent to see the guidance counselor, who turns out to be Chuck ""The Shermanator"" Sherman (Chris Owen). You can tell that that role was meant to give a ""my, how the tables have turned"" appeal, but I don't know; it just didn't do anything for me. Anyway, Sherman sends Matt to band camp for the summer.

Upon arriving at band camp, we meet the only real saving grace to this movie: Jim's dad, Mr. Levinstein, as the head counselor (Eugene Levy is ALWAYS funny, so that's no surprise). Matt also meets his childhood crush, Elyse Houston (played by Arielle Kebbel -- quite a step up from Soul Plane, isn't it?), and she reminds him that he was a sweet guy until he started trying to be like his brother.

After, say, halfway into the movie, it seems like things will get better, but then everything plays out almost exactly like what happened in American Wedding. Stifler's annoying pranks are good for a few laughs, but then he screws up so bad that even the audience at home thinks he's a jerk; then he finally realizes the error of his ways and fixes things up for the girl of his dreams just before the credits roll.

Even a veteran porn star (Ginger Lynn Allen) and a pair of Playboy Playmates (Rachel Veltri and Angela Little) do little to add interest to this movie. Like the case with American Wedding, Band Camp is only worth buying to complete your American Pie collection.

2439837,2,B000BT971I,"When a movie comes out strait to video there is usually a reason, and this was one of those.  This was not the fourth instalment in the American Pie series, but more of a spin-off.  It's unfortunate that a triology like American Pie has this trying to ride on it's coat tails.

Here we see the younger brother of American Pie's Steve Stiffler, Matt Stiffler, who is following in his older brother's footsteps.  His bad behavior at school has resulted in a discipline action: go to band camp this summer or be expelled.  Whoa to the innocents at band camp who are there to feel the wrath of Matt's evil nature.  Matt plots to make the best of his band camp experience by filming a Girls Gone Wild type video to sell and make him rich.  Naturally, Stiffler meets a wonderful girl amidst the quirky, somewhat awkward characters who he tries to clean up his act to have her actually like him.  But he gives into his wants by pulling pranks (the ipecac syrip on the band instruments), is discovered, and emerges from band camp having learned his lessons.

This started off with an alright premiss, but it quickly fell flat.  The American Pie movies set the bar, but we already knew what was going to happen thanks to the other three movies.  The lead, Matt, was actually a dead ringer for the guy who played Stiffler in the original Pie movies, even though he has darker hair and features.  But, the first Stiffler did it before.  And where are the sex games that Michelle kept talking about that all the band camp geeks do!?!  That's why we rented this movie to begin with!

In American Pie presents Bandcamp. Matt Stiffler is sentenced to a summer of bandcamp, after he gets caught pulling a prank during on the band during graduation. Hearing of all the sexual escapes of band camp, Matt orders a bunch of video gear, to make Bandies Gone Wild. After awhile he begins to bond with the band geeks. Eventually learning, that if he continues to act like his older brother Steve no one will like him. So, Matt begins to change his ways and becomes friends with the bandies in the end.

2439850,2,B000BT971I,"IF you like the previous AMERICAN PIE movies, you will probably like this one.  However, you will likely not enjoy it as much as the previous ones.  For what it is, it's OK.  Not fantastic, just OK.

What the movie lacks is the dynamic of the previous AP flicks.  This next generation of AP does not feature the calibre of actors such as Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan and Seann William Scott.  There are a few tie-in actors from the previous AP, but only in bit parts.

The worst idea was to have some actor (not Seann William Scott) stand-in for Stiffler.  This scene was totally unnecessary and superfluous.  Not sure whose idea it was, but you can't fool people into thinking that someone else is capable of playing Stiffler.  Scott has shown himself to have a screen presence that is out of the league of everyone in this farce.

Of course, the whole premise of the movie does not help matters.  To say that the plot is silly would be an understatement.  That's not to say that the plot of the previous 3 could rival Shakespeare, but this one was the weakest of the 4.

The biggest saving grace of the film is the eye-candy drum-major, Arielle Kebbel.  She is beautiful as the wholesome midwestern girl-next door (complete with integrity!).  I fell in love with her about 10 minutes into the movie!  She also has a genuine acting talent and I hope to see much more of her.  Sadly, she's one of the few girls in the film who doesn't take her shirt off (hate it when that happens!).

If you're a die-hard AP fan, you may as well see this one.  Some of the pranks are recycled or @ least variations of the predecessors.  Also, the special features on this one are LAME.  Still, it's just barely watchable if the party movie genre is your thing.",1138233600,,1742,4.429022082018927

And some people here gave this movie five stars? Are you serious? Are you high? Were you high when watching?

I rented this for one reason: to see how bad it was. It came perilously close to a one star rating, but it had a few redeeming qualities, such as Arielle Kebbel as Elyse, and Tad Hilgenbrink's uncanny resemblance to the older Stifler. Amazon says he doesn't have the same impish charm; perhaps they're right. But he showed a softer side than his older brother ever did, and that was what saved this movie from one star. Elyse said something early in the film about Stifler from his younger days - she said that when he was around her, he was Matt, but when he was around his older brother, he was a jerk. Sure, his metamorphosis into a caring person comes too quickly, and sure, Elyse should never have forgiven him for his many, many stupid things (could anyone date a guy who tried to have sex with an oboe and was CAUGHT?) but the metamorphosis does come, and in a rare occurrence for an American Pie movie, someone actually grows up. (The Shermanator does not count. He's a guidance counselor? Give me a break. He could hardly guide himself through a maze.)

The movie's premise was profoundly ridiculous. A guidance counselor sends a bratty teenager to Band Camp when he doesn't play an instrument? And Band Camp is a serious event? The good ol' Shermanator proves he's still a little geeky boy with no ability to make real-life decisions.

The plot, and most of the events surrounding the plot (Stifler ordered how many thousands of dollars worth of spying equipment...when did he become rich?) are incomprehensible, but I have to admit that I did laugh a few times.

Oh, and if you like Tad - that is, if you think he's cute - there are some bonuses in the film for you. There are plenty of scenes where he's in the buff. Party on.",1138147200,13,2041,4.432

His brother pulls a prank on the band and is forced to go to band camp with them over the summer.  It's the typical cool kid finding out that the dorks aren't all that bad.

While the previous American Pie movies were slapstick comedy and full of tasteless, yet hilarious humor, there were elements of wittiness and impeccable timing to the jokes.  American Pie Band Camp was just some random breasts and overdone acting.  Yeah, the characters in the other American Pie movies were over-the-top, but they were well-acted over-the-top.  I liked the kid who played Stifler's brother because you could really believe he was related to Stifler, but he was just too much.  Everyone was just a little too much of whatever stereotype they were supposed to be playing.  It's like it was Not Another Team Movie, and it was just a parody of itself.  There are some parts that are really funny, where I laughed out loud, but the rest of the movie was pretty much awful...

2439869,3,B000BT971I,"Having seen all of the AMERICAN PIE movies, a very safe deduction to make is that the original AMERICAN PIE with Jason Biggs, and the rest of the original cast is the best, period.  AMERICAN PIE 2 wasn't as good as AMERICAN PIE, understandable considering that it is a sequel, yet it wasn't a bad movie.  The last two movies of the AP Series have both been serious stretches.  While AMERICAN WEDDING did include Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott, it was a stretch and didn't feel as funny as either AP 1 or 2.  This movie, I wouldn't venture so far as to say that it is necessarily better than American Wedding, but I would say that it is just as good or about the same.  Still, it is a notch or two below the excellence of the original and even the initial sequal, but it serves its purpose as a somewhat funny, silly teen sex movie.

What doesn't work here with American Pie is some of the comedy or what is supposed to be positioned as funny.  For example, Eugene Levy's role as Jim's Dad (here as a staffer at the Band Camp) is dry as ever, yet the dryness of the the lines and things that he says don't come over as funny or witty as they did in either of the first 2 AP movies.  That isn't to say that he doesn't have his moments, but they don't shine like they do in the earlier movies showing that the American Pie series is definitely showing its age.

Another thing that doesn't particularly shine about AP4 is the fact that it is Unrated. It isn't particularly necessary and it doesn't really add to the film.  By this film, number 4 in the series, everything just begins to fall off.  What this movie truly shows is the fact that there can always be too much of a good thing.  The story line is ultimately silly and unrealistic, yet in some ways it is fun.  What is probably most untrue to the American Pie tradition is the fact that Stiffler's Little Bro changes as opposed to being in the constantly referenced ""Family Business"".  That ending comes over as somewhat sappy and corny, but despite the silly, and sometimes lacking story line, this AP does serve its purpose if not to the level of its better films, aka AMERICAN PIE and stretching the slightest bit AMERICAN PIE 2.  2.5 Stars.",1136246400,,2205,4.34390243902439

This film pretty much tries to follow the original series' formula, but it doesn't really achieve any of those things above. I will say that I liked it more than I thought I would. If it hadn't been for the returning Eugene Levy(and he is in demand as an actor judging by how he always pops up - another reviewer should pay more attention), I wouldn't of been nearly as interested. As far as direct to video goes, it's better than others of it's kind I've seen. But first, the plot. Stifler's little brother Matt(Tad Hilgenbrick)is a cjip off the old block. In ways, he seems even more annoying than big bro. He is caught in the act of a prank and is sent to the guidance councelor(The Sherminator!)and for punishment is sent to band camp. But Stifler Jr. being who he is, he has a raunchy plan. He sets up cameras all over the place and plans to make a raunchy video called ""Bandeez Gone Wild"", and follow in big bro's footsteps. However, he didn't plan on falling in love with Elyse(Arielle Kebell), but we did!. The film also has the expected and cliched ""big tournament"" that our main stars try to win and beat their rivals who have won it year after year. Yawn. The idea for the movie works for the kind of ""spin off"" that this is, but it wouldn't of for a regular part 4. Hilgenbrick is one of the more redeeming qualities here. He is a bit annoying and does take it a little too far sometimes, but he has the Stifler speak down pat, as well as the looks and mannerisms. He has definitley studied Sean William Scott. Kibbell is a lovely thing to look at, but nothing else is going on. Levy delivers as Jiim's dad, but he's not as funny here as he was in the others. But his appearance adds some credibility to the proceedings that the film would otherwise be lacking. Former porn star Ginger Lynn Allen appears as the camp nurse, and comedic character actor Timothy Stack(""Night Stand"", ""Son Of The Beach"")also appears. The film has the raunch down, but the comedy is on a low. There isn't a whole lot to laugh at here. Most of what we see we have seen before. None of the characters are likeable, except maybe Elyse, and none are that relatable. Something that was a key ingredient in the three previous films. The movie tries to have heart, and maybe it has some, but it is not as real, deep, or authentic as any in the other films. It falls flat and seems too rushed for it to be effective. The raunch factor is pretty high. There is more nudity in this film than in any of the others. You'll be in for a treat if you like that sort of thing. I knew going in that this would not be a high mark in the ""Pie"" series, and the film supported my thought. The extras are so so. Some deleted scenes and outtakes, and some time behind the scenes with the crew and the camp girls. A music video of the girls is included as well. Even ""American Wedding"", which is considered the least in the series, is ten times funnier than this one. Jim's dad mentioned that Jim and Michelle were having a baby.

The humor was utterly predictable, this was really bad even for a film with a meagre budget of 10 million dollars. Yeah, I know that this is aimed at teens (no offense)and lowbrows (can you be offended?) but come on...
The acting was so unnatural I kept my eyes open for the shadow of a teleprompter...
The script is nothing more than a dirty version of every ""Gone to Camp"" film ever made...
Your imagination is probably more interesting than the images on the screen... of course little is left to the imagination.

Any money spent on the purchase of this ""watch it once and try to forget it"" movie is money lost forever. Did I mention that I threw this away within 24 hours of buying it?
Straight to video and directly to the garbage truck or pawn shop.",1135641600,7,1001,4.410810810810811
2439889,4,B000BT971I,"Pay no mind to the reviewers who haven't actually seen this movie and are criticizing because the original cast isn't in this, because it's actually a worthy addition to the series.

It has more HEART than any on the movies in the series and UNLIKE AMERICAN WEDDING (which was more of a sequel to JACKASS than AMERICAN PIE), remembered that American Pie was a popular series because of the SEX and not the gross out jokes. Although it did manage to get some of those gross out jokes in there.

Really, the only thing that keeps this movie down is the fact that they weren't given a very big budget. For the amount of money that they had to make this, I think they did a very good job and the mostly original cast managed to be funny, relatable, appealing and should be commended for delivering a worthy addition to the series.

The movie revolves around Stiffler's brother Matt, played by Tad Hilgenbrink, who is trying to live up to his brothers reputation by making a peeping Tom video while being forced to go to Band Camp as a punishment for tormenting the Band.

The Band's leader, Elyse, played by Arielle Kebbel, was also a nice addition to the American Pie women. She's fun to watch with her innocent smile and budding sexuality.

The women are attractive too. Although they had small parts, Rachel Veltri and Carla Alaponte are stunners.

The story is sort of typical, but surprisingly had a lot of nice twists that weren't typical. Some nice surprises and a nice wrinkle of an ending.

After American Wedding spent nearly its entire 103 minutes doing gross out jokes that were more typical of JACKASS than the original American Pie, it was really refreshing to see Band Camp return the series to its true form and explore the hilarious side of teen sex with all its immaturities and vulnerablilities.

Band Camp is a worthy edition to my DVD collection.",1135555200,41,1863,4.624242424242424

You'll like it if your not 80 years old basically. If you don't like these kind of movies, don't waste time complaining about how bad it was on here. I would say buy it definitely!",1135555200,5,344,4.0
2439891,3,B000BT971I,"just when you thought it was over and nothin more could be said:  along comes AP-BC.  I had my reservations about this movie but if you are going to buy this--get the unrated version-yes, there is a plot however thin(but when its a camp-humor, sex-who really cares).  stifflers little brother ""matt"" was a surprise and held is own in the stiffler kin-(remember, he is in the first two AP movies but is not mentioned by name-obviously another younger actor too).  jim's father is there for basically no reason(throwaway-money roll)and I was surprised to see the ""SHERMINATOR""  make a couple of cameos.  no other cast members from previous films are there that I could see.  is this a horrible movie?---well, no, is it great? depends on your enjoyment of what made AP series so fun.  this movie has basically recycled events from all the other movies and in this setting-is well served.  TNA are aplenty, ma$turbation with dreams, crude uses of instruments,  video voyerism and general nasty language with crude potty humor.  I kinda like those kind of things and movies with extensive nudity always rule.  the cast seem to be all unknowns.  I am not sure how well this do, but for the faithful fans who loved the others, might as well check this out too.",1135555200,5,1253,4.74537037037037

They could have saved us all a lot of time, money and aggrivation by sending it straight to the landfill where it belongs. This movie isn't worth the DVD it's recorded on.

They are all to nice and act way to innocent for american pie no sarcasm or plain wild style funny its like they were not even trying.
