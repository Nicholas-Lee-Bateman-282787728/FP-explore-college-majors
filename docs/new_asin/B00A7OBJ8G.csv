5393244,2,B00A7OBJ8G,"I agree with previous review, that this was not so much about Joe Frazier as it was about Marvis Frazier's work.  Marvis is a good man, but this is not what I was led to believe by the DVD cover.",1429142400,,195,3.875
5393245,5,B00A7OBJ8G,A must for Joe Frazier fans or just fans of the sport. It's my opinion that Joe Frazier was one of the greatest of all time not just a great world heavyweight champion but a great man. Not much fight footage but lots of interviews by family and friends who knew him best. A solid documentary.,1415232000,2,292,4.232142857142857
5393246,5,B00A7OBJ8G,Documentary was a great insight to the life of a great boxing legend who faced hardships in his later part of his life.,1392681600,3,119,4.217391304347826
5393247,3,B00A7OBJ8G,"The service for the film Joe Frazier: When the smoke clears was excellent and I would definitely use them again. The film itself left much to be desired! It was overly long and drawn out. I believe Joe's story could have been said in much better ways. That said, RENT the film and don't buy it!",1366675200,4,294,4.267857142857143
5393248,3,B00A7OBJ8G,"If you think this is a insightful view of one of the greats of boxing this is not it. ESPN did a better job in their production that was broadcast after his passing. Yes, there is some good interviews with Joe in his later days but still  there is not any discussion about his career from his point of view. There is very little history here. It is really more about Marvis and his community work. The cover photo leads you to believe one thing...but it does not have the knockout you would expect.",1366502400,8,498,4.297872340425532
5393249,5,B00A7OBJ8G,Best boxing documentary I've ever seen. The definitive film on Frazier. Very poignant portrayal and deeply moving. Puts his life in the wider context of American history...,1365724800,2,172,5.407407407407407
5393250,1,B00A7OBJ8G,"I bought this hoping to see fights of Smokin Joe that I had grown up with, or possibly missed. Although there were interesting scenes with Joe in his later years, I was disapointed to find out this video is all about promoting raising money. I can turn on the TV to most any channel and get this. Not interested.",1363737600,3,312,4.305084745762712
5393251,5,B00A7OBJ8G,A great look at the later life of Joe Frazier. Straightforward and honest portrayal of where his life has gone and how he got by at the end. Good interviews with family and friends help put his life and legacy in perspective.,1363219200,6,225,4.380952380952381
5393252,5,B00A7OBJ8G,"This documentary pieces together what we didn't learn about Frazier in his other documentary, ""Thrilla in Manila"". Here, you learn about Joe Frazier's  extremely humble beginnings, interviewing those who knew him from elementary days, all the way up to his achievement of becoming the World Heavyweight Champion.

Perhaps the greatest aspect of this documentary, however, is what you learn about Joe's values, what he stood for, and what his legacy is. You'll find that Joe, though he endured a relentlessly tough life, is an incredibly admirable and honorable man. The documentary is very well shot, and is very satisfyingly narrated by the person who was closer to Joe than anyone; his son Marvis.

I recommend this film to boxing fans, especially fans of Frazier and Ali's era of boxing. I also recommend this film to those who enjoy the history of boxing as a sport or sports in general, and what these fighters lives were like in this time period. It's actually quite ironic, you come to realize that Joe Frazier set the stereotype of the 'poor boxer in an inner city who makes it big by his heart and fighting will' that was made famous by Sylvester Stallone.",1346976000,7,1165,4.844221105527638

8547975,3,B00A7OBJ8G,"This gives background on the former heavy weight champion of the world, his youth where he grew up in the  south is shown. He moves to Philadelphia and wins a gold medal in the 1964 Olympics. He eventually becomes heavy weight champion and even asks Nixon to reinstate Ali! Once reinstated Ali badmouths Frazier and they fight three times with Ali continuing to badmouth him.

His sin does voice overs and that is intermixed with their work at his rundown gym as he aspires to encourage other young men. Larry Holmes and George Foreman speak. Occasionally disjointed presentation. Appears to have been a good man, RIP. Extras include people at his memorial talking.",1492905600,,665,4.876106194690266
