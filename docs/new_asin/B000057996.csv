It starts with men playing a tape, then a view of the desert in 1949 New Mexico. In 1965 Jim is at Venice Beach in California. [Selections of their music play.] Jim follows a girl from the beach to her home. At the UCLA Film School they play movies from Germany in the 1930s. I quit. There is a conversation about poetry and philosophy. [Does it make sense?] Life hurts. Ray tries acid. Jim writes songs. The band practices; is it right? They sing Light My Fire. They perform at clubs on the Sunset Strip. Break On Through to the Other Side. Young girls are entranced and scream. Theres another venue. Then a trip to the desert with the band. [The words suggest intoxication or drugs.] They play at Whiskey  Go-Go to an admiring crowd. Is that a rational song?

The crowd watches Jims gyrations, the owner fires them! The owner of a recording company meets them. We see people in a park in 1967 San Francisco. They have a following. They fly to New York and mid-town Manhattan. Young girls scream [are they paid or do they lack a vitamin?]. The Ed Sullivan Show gives them national exposure. [A tie-in to CBS records?] Will they change their lyrics? The Stones did it. He said it! Youll never play Sullivan again! Jim posed for a portrait by a famous fashion photographer. They want you. There is a party for artsy types. These people are vampires. [They feed off the famous?] They go to a party; Jim strays. There is a press interview; what does he believe in? Jims talk is confused. Then he meets another friend. Is she sane? Later Jim is with Pam. He drinks whiskey in bed. He loves fame. His stunt at the window shows his problems.

There is a show in 1968 New Haven. A friend learns about Jims father - a Navy Admiral in Vietnam. She traced his school records. Jim imagines what his fans want. He goes on with a scream. Young woman rush the stage. [Are they lacking in something?] The police guard him. Jim talks about this on-stage. The police shut down the show, Jim is arrested! [A sign of a deteriorating mind?] There is a bar scene. Is his drinking out of control? Dropping acid? There is an uncomfortable meeting at a party. A ruined Thanksgiving! Jim drinks more in 1968 San Francisco. Jim lights his fire! He hangs out with witches (to whose benefit?). Some of the audience joins the act. Jim records in a studio, he is easily upset by a managers request.

They see a commercial on TV, this creates a temper tantrum. He is warned against his drinking. [Is his voice deteriorating?] In 1969 Miami a man sings The Eve of Destruction [a song censored from radio stations]. Jim gets fat, he shows up two hours late for a show! The crowd yells in appreciation. His speech shows his problems, he takes off his shirt and joins the audience. Break on Through to the Other Side? He appears in court in 1970. A lack of evidence? He has a complication. Convicted, he posts a bond to stay free. They show the news from that era. Will Jim have a nervous breakdown? He will go to Paris to write poetry and says goodbye to his band members. His drinking continues. In July 1971 he was found dead in a bathtub. He was buried in the Pre Lachaise cemetery (1943-1971). Pam died three years later. Can his heart failure be caused by the effects of whiskey and the lack of vitamins and a proper diet?

What if The Doors continued? Think of The Beatles, The Stones, The Who etc. today. What if Jim had studied accounting or law instead of going to Film School? This is an anti-drug and anti-drinking movie that doesnt preach, just teaches by example.",1441756800,,3564,4.450229709035222
