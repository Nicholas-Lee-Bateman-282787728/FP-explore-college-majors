8151882,4,B000JLTSE4,"A fifth star would have been added if this had English subtitles.  The Spanish by these very elderly people is a little slurred, a little accented, and difficult to understand if you are not a native Spanish speaker.

With that said, 5 stars for this being an excellent first hand oral piece of history by people who lived and survived through the Mexican Revolution of 1910.  It is funny that conspiracy theories are nothing new: many of these older people believe Zapata did not die but left the country with an Arab friend.  (At least I think that's what they said.  I'm pretty sure that's what I heard them saying.)

Super cute to notice is that Mexican people love to sing.",1473897600,,678,4.56198347107438
8151883,5,B000JLTSE4,"My great grandfather fought alongside Emiliano Zapata.  Hearing his compatriot's accounts of their fight for agrarian reform made me feel closer than ever to my Mexican ancestors.  This magnificent account by ""those who were actually there"" brings the past right to the present, where the fight continues . . . this is truly riveting.",1423526400,,334,5.166666666666667
8151884,5,B000JLTSE4,"One of the most touching documentaries made about the Mexican revolution.  It's a must have for your collection.  It takes you back to when our elders told us stories of our past, and the struggles they endured in order to preserve and gain the liberties we enjoy today.",1413676800,,270,4.604166666666667
8151885,3,B000JLTSE4,Heart warming interviews with the last of the men who fought with Zapata to keep the rich owners of the sugar haciendas take over all the cultivatable land.,1402790400,,156,4.607142857142857
8151886,5,B000JLTSE4,"This is a very touching dvd of some of the survivors of the Revolution and how they remember those days and also what their lives are like today.  I enjoyed ""visiting"" the old folks - brought tears to my eyes to hear their stories.",1355961600,3,231,4.25
8151887,5,B000JLTSE4,Extremely well done documentary.  Up close and personal encounters with living links to an extraordinary event in Mexico's history.  Switches gears halfway through and moves to the present and the on-going struggle of peasants to retain land and dignity.  Causes one to recall the loss of family farms in the United States during the 1950s-1980s to a lot of the same forces with a lot of the same results.,1224288000,12,405,4.840579710144928
