6870802,5,B00QJ643JS,"Congrats to the writers and director.........and the producers of course.

This was worthy of an NCIS type episode.

It was predictable from the moment you took that first look at that scary Marine dude; but then the plot is beautifully developed as we find out about the clandestine arrangement he's made with the girls father and the devastating consequences that follow.

Fast paced, to the point, no nonsense and completely believable. keeps you on the edge of your seat.",1429660800,,475,4.987341772151899

6870806,2,B00QJ643JS,"I took a chance on this movie because of the title and Michael Ironside's name was listed.  BIG mistake.  As another reviewer pointed out, there is nothing new or special about the premise of this movie:  35-year old ""teenagers"" are out for a fun weekend at a relative's house-located-not-close-to-anything, and all the characters involved have single digit IQs.  You have your smart-mouthed weenie, a ""Russian"" babe, who's accent was so bad, I expected to see ""Moose and Squirrel"" ANY second, and others who (regardless of all the sinister goings-on) flat refuse to call for help.  There are no red herrings; what you see is what you get...and that isn't much.

This was just bad all the way around.  The story, even though it seemed thought through was not, and even when it was explained, was just waaay too unbelievable.  Michael Ironside's screentime may have amount to 10 minutes.  His character was simply another throw-away character whose only purpose was to try and ""plug"" all the holes in the plot.  Ms. Duff, who I've seen in another movie where she wore boots and screamed a lot, wasn't that bad.  At least she could deliver lines.

The movie is rated R for violence and language, and it could have been so much better.  I say pass on this one.",1423699200,10,1257,4.7373271889400925
6870807,2,B00QJ643JS,"Man, oh man! I had high hopes for this one. I really did. I'm honestly not exactly sure why? It's basically the same old story we've heard a thousand times but with even worse acting. Seriously, it's rough. Don't get me wrong, some aren't too bad, but others are down right AWFUL!

From the start, this movie is EXACTLY what you think it is. There are no secrets here. Who you think is the killer, is the killer, and I'm not really sure they ever try to steer you away from that idea. Maybe that's supposed to be the twist in the whole scheme?! I'm not sure, but either way, it's bad. The movie follows a group of friends on vacation from school heading to Allie McClean's (Haylie Duff) family ranch house. Apparently her father is ridiculously wealthy (later we find out how) and bought the place some time ago. On the property is Ben (Gonzalo Menendez), the caretaker. He's been given free access to live and hunt the land as long as he takes care of the place. The group decides to build a camp fire out on the property and soon come to a locked trailer house. After breaking in, they discover some things that quickly make them want to leave.

The major problem with this film is the acting. For starters, we have Eduardo (Wilmer Calderon). This guy,...NO ONE would be friends with this guy. Acts like a complete moron. You can tell he wants to be the ""Stifler"" of the group, but he just comes off as a complete jerk the whole time. Speaking of ""nods"" to American Pie,....I honestly NEVER thought I'd hear a worse ""Russian"" accent than that of Shannon Elizabeth. HOWEVER, Eduardo's girlfriend, Nina (Vera Rosada) surpasses that horrible performance by a mile! Brutal. Some of the other characters are pretty laughable as well, but none come close to those two!

The whole movie is just one giant mess, in my opinion. The only reason it didn't get a single star, was because it at least held my attention throughout. How? I'm not so sure, but as bad as it was, I never thought to myself, ""I gotta stop watching this.""

Final Verdict: Ughhh,...PASS ON THIS ONE!",1421712000,15,2063,4.508021390374331

I've seen worse, and at least the movie didn't spend too much time trying to get us to sympathize/ identify with the hapless teenagers out for the typical night of wild/ slightly illegal fun before people start going missing. Yes, the characters make some completely unrealistic decisions, but that is one of the prerequisites for a movie like this.

This script could have been great but it seemed more like it was written by someone who could barely write a book report which is really sad because the story line had so much potential. The acting was WRETCHED with the exception of the main characters father who was in I believe 3 scenes for less than 5 minutes. The attempt at comedy; let's just say it was bad since I'm sure Amazon won't permit what I really want to say.

Maybe that was the writer's intention...to get you on the side of the killer...but I couldn't even do that because his acting was just as awful...maybe that's why the classics like Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees have no lines...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE!
