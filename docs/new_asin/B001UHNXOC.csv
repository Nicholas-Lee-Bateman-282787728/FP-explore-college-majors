8343779,5,B001UHNXOC,"Mike Leigh's best work methinks (which isn't intended as a put-down of his films). This edition comes with optional English subtitles, handy for those who might find the accents impenetrable.",1498003200,,191,5.4
8343780,5,B001UHNXOC,I'm very happy to add this collection to my library.,1491091200,,52,4.3
8343781,5,B001UHNXOC,"Some bleak but shrewdly observed social comedy here.  Fans of Mike Leigh know how skilful he can be at showing the nuances of social behaviour:  the little rituals, habits, rudenesses and favours that people engage in.  When successful he can prompt you to see your own relationships in a new light.  By the way, if you enjoyed the recent movie Mr. Turner, you might notice a glass cleaning motif popping up:  Hard Labour ends with a shot of the longsuffering Mrs. Thornley polishing a window, echoed by the final scene of Mr. Turner.

This only appears in tiny print on the underside of the box, but the disks are in PAL format, Region 2.",1452643200,,639,4.56140350877193
8343782,5,B001UHNXOC,"I keep watching the Mike Leigh BBC mini dramas such as ""Hard Labour"" and ""Abigail's Party"" over and over again and I can't articulate why they have such a hold on me. Some of the characters eerily remind me of my English relatives in the way they speak volumes about themselves by saying basically nothing. Some of the films in this collection are very unsettling and uncomfortable to watch, but I keep comming back to them. Some kind of hyper-realism that transcends reality reality??? Highly recommended.",1367798400,4,506,4.895348837209302
8343783,5,B001UHNXOC,"For Mike Leigh fans, this BBC package is the Holy Grail. Especially Abigail's Party and Nuts In May, but the documentaries
on Leigh's working methods are a great insight into his unique and illuminating style of drama and film.
Essential viewing.",1361664000,3,246,5.024390243902439
8343784,5,B001UHNXOC,"Mike Leigh at the BBC is wonderful, and a real bargain.  At least two of the films in it, The Permissive Society and the Five Minute Movies are only available in this collection. Grown-Ups and Four Days in July are among the best movies Leigh has ever made, which makes them, in my opinion, among the best films ever.  Both of them are agonizingly funny and agonizingly sad, an intriguing combination.  To see actors such as Leslie Manville, Timothy Spall, Alison Steadman, Brenda Blethyn, Phil Davis, etc.at the beginning of their careers is a real treat.

Just one warning:  these discs don't play on a standard USA DVD player, so you will have to route them through a computer, but outside of that the technical reproduction is outstanding, especially the Letter Box presentation.",1345334400,6,783,4.857142857142857
