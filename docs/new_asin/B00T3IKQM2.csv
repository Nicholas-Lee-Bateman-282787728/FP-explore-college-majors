6998784,5,B00T3IKQM2,"INTERESTING:
Each episode on the DVD/Blu-Ray is six to seven minutes longer than on the BBC-America cablecast (55-56 minutes per episode on BBC-America).
Surprisingly, the DVD/Blu-Ray episodes are also two to three minutes longer than the Amazon Instant Video downloads:*
Episode 1 = 62 minutes vs. 60 minutes on Amazon Instant Video
Episode 2 = 62 minutes vs. 59 minutes on Amazon Instant Video
Episode 3 = 61 minutes vs. 59 minutes on Amazon Instant Video
Episode 4 = 62 minutes vs. 59 minutes on Amazon Instant Video
Episode 5 = 62 minutes vs. 59 minutes on Amazon Instant Video
Episode 6 = 62 minutes vs. 60 minutes on Amazon Instant Video
Episode 7 = 62 minutes vs. 60 minutes on Amazon Instant Video
Episode 8 = 62 minutes vs. 60 minutes on Amazon Instant Video

EVEN MORE INTERESTING:
The Amazon UK Instant Video website claims the following running times:
Episode 1 = 66 minutes
Episode 2 = 68 minutes
Episode 3 = 67 minutes
Episode 4 = 66 minutes
Episode 5 = 63 minutes
Episode 6 = 75 minutes
Episode 7 = 67 minutes
Episode 8 = 69 minutes
What would account for the difference in playing times between the U.S. and British Amazon Instant Video downloads?
Isn't Amazon one big happy company?
I have not ruled out the possibilities that this may be a misprint, or that the longer UK times are due to Previews of Coming Attractions being tacked on to the main program.
Are Americans even allowed to download from Amazon UK?
If you have seen and timed (not just heard about) one of these Amazon UK downloads, I would be grateful for a Comment at the end of this review. **
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Ripper Street"" is a British police series set in Victorian London.
Contrary to the title, it is not about the hunt for Jack the Ripper, but is set in Whitechapel shortly after the Ripper killings.
Lead character Detective Inspector Edmund Reid is obsessed with his failure solve the Ripper case.
And that's not all he's obsessed with - very much a flawed hero.

Extremely violent - Police interrogations frequently involve beating a confession out of the suspect.
The female characters are mostly current or former prostitutes (with or without a heart of gold).
This is the dark side of Sherlock Holmes' London.
What Would Basil Rathbone Do?

Seasons One (2012) and Two (2013) were produced by the BBC.
After complaints about general naughtiness, the BBC elected not to produce a third season.
Amazon stepped in and produced Season Three (2014) as pay-per-view video downloads.
BBC Home Entertainment has now issued Season Three on Blu-Ray and DVD.
I guess they've buried the hatchet.

Principal Cast:
Inspector Edmund Reid: Matthew Macfadyen
Sergeant Bennet Drake: Jerome Flynn
Captain Homer Jackson: Adam Rothenberg (an alchoholic American ex-army doctor who finds part-time work as a London police medical examiner)

No extra features.

I was worried that, minus BBC support, Season Three would would be done on the cheap, but this fear proved groundless.
Amazon produced a quality product - sets, costumes and cinematography are first class.
The quality of the writing is remarkable.
The plotting is almost too imaginative (a lot of inter-connecting plot-lines), but it's so well done that I had no trouble believing it.

I assume that anyone who wants Season Three is already familiar with Seasons One and Two.
Season Two ended in general mayhem and the three principals have not talked to each other for four years, but by the end of the first episode of Season Three:
Inspector Reid is promoted to Chief Inspector (tentatively).
Sergeant Drake is promoted to Inspector and takes over Reid's old command.
Captain Jackson is still despised by everyone, but his medical knowledge is still indispensable to the investigation.

BULLETIN --- Internet website ""denofgeek.us"" is reporting that Amazon has renewed Ripper Street for Seasons 4 and 5.

* I haven't watched the U.S. Amazon Instant Video downloads - these are the timings listed on the Amazon Instant Video web page.
I did watch the BBC-America cablecasts and can confirm that each episode was cut by six to seven minutes.

** Just to repeat:
I am not allowed to purchase the Amazon UK version because I don't have:
1) a British e-mail address (with .uk at the end)
2) a credit card issued by a bank in the UK.

I am certainly not going to boycott the inexpensive Blu-Rays of the show because of this.
Not to be morbid, but I am over sixty and don't know if I have the time to wait out a boycott.

Also, as I mentioned in the review, I have never actually seen an Amazon UK download, nor do I know anyone who has.
Therefore I cannot absolutely vouch for the accuracy of the timings posted on the Amazon UK website.

6998820,4,B00T3IKQM2,"Ripper Street is a British crime drama TV series set in Whitechapel in Victorian-era England shortly after the Jack The Ripper murders. That is just when the show is set and has nothing to do with Jack The Ripper but focuses on a small team in the local police station dealing with the various crimes in late 1800's Whitechapel.

 I remember back when the show started I was initially put off by the distinct lack of Jack The Ripper business but quickly fell in love with the show. The storylines are fascinating, the acting is outstanding, the sets and realism are great but it's just a very well put together TV show.

  Ripper Street is a fantastic little show that I really do hope continues. Special mention must be made to the acting and chemistry of Jerome Flynn as Detective Inspector Bennet Drake also known as Bronn one of the great characters in Game Of Thrones, Adam Rothenberg as Captain Homer Jackson the 'yankee' and Clive Russell as Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline. I must admit I've never really warmed to lead actor Matthew Macfadyen as Detective Inspector Edmund Reid but the others make up for it.

 I highly recommend Ripper Street especially for it's binge-worthy addictiveness.",1463702400,,1204,4.815533980582524

It was a historical drama, a thriller and one heck of a who done it.  Something television in the U.S. does not do and that is give a satisfying end to each season.

6998854,5,B00T3IKQM2,"This show is well acted, filmed beautifully, and the plots are suspenseful and entertaining.  The profiling skills highlighted once all three of the characters give their observations is pretty fun to watch. The men work within the boundaries of knowledge and technology in the late 1800's while solving cases from Section H.  This is the same Section that housed Mr. Merrick, better known as The Elephant Man (see Season 2), and the infamous Jack the Ripper murders. The focus of the law enforcement team is to preserve and maintain respect towards law enforcement after not being able to catch Jack the Ripper, all the while trying to focus on the normal cases that come in.  (Awesome concept).

All of the characters are tormented by past experiences which can be learned in the first 2 seasons.  Season 3 gives us the story of how they all end up back together in White Chapel after 4 years.
  -Inspector Reid is the Backbone of the team as the law enforcer who seeks to modernize criminology by reading up on advances and increasing his skills while dealing with loss and pain in his personal life.
  -Inspector Drake is the Heart of the team who denies himself love, and has the contrast of being good with his fists, and being able to take a lot of physical pain.
  -Captain Jack is a brilliant doctor who spends just as much time drinking and enjoying the local professional ladies as he does saving or autopsying the patients.
  -Madam Susan is strong and cold in defense of ever having her heart broken again, and moves from Madam to Philanthropist in the 3rd season.

There are not many shows out there that can boast being consistently good for every Season that they have aired.  Ripper Street is definitely one of those shows.  The characters remain interesting and familiar, the plots are strong, and if you like Mystery, Period pieces, and/or Detective shows, you will enjoy Ripper Street.",1452643200,5,1905,4.762195121951219

6998858,5,B00T3IKQM2,"I love this shoe more than Boardwalk Empire. Is that bad? Is that wrong to say? It has everything you could ask for in terms of plot, acting, depth, emotion, excitement, and love. And holy Toledo was the finale amazing.",1450224000,,219,4.5
6998859,5,B00T3IKQM2,"I have been a fan of Ripper Street since the beginning and I am so happy to see that Amazon has decided to pick the show up so it may continue.  With work and life I wasn't able to fully get into season 3 and boy did it start off with a bang!  So I went on ahead and purchased the entire season.  I will probably watch from the beginning again Seasons 1 -3 and binge in preparation of Season 4.

What is the show about.  Well for me it is, mostly, about the law enforcement during the time of The Ripper in White Chapel as well as the citizens who live there. The good the bad, etc.  Is it all about ""Jack the Ripper"" no it's not. It's White Chapel so trust that there are other criminals lurking about.

We even see in Season 3 Det. Reid expanding the scope of police work by starting to archive interviews with people and criminals to use as a tool to refer to.  Similar to what we would call a deposition or something like that. Their words are on record so if brought in again, trying to change their stories, etc won't work. Others think this is crazy and Reid is just becoming a nutter but for those of us in the 21st century it makes perfect sense!

Det Reid is dogmatic, a bit uptight and determined to make White Chapel a safe place for those who put their trust in him and his officers. Dare I say, by any means necessary at times.  To the point of becoming so focus driven to the neglect of his home and family.

Det Drake....oh I just adore Drake.  He is a man who has seen much in his life and feels deep inside that he is not a good man in-spite of the work he does in helping to police the streets of WC.  He is also Reid's go to man when an interrogation is needed because I feel he sees Drake as just a man with fist, a brute.  He will relay on Drake to carry out the violence instead of getting his own hands dirty.  At the end of Season 2 you see all that will change however.

Mr. Homer Jackson (alias)...I LOVE this character who is from America and running away from something and someone with his lady Ms. Susan who runs a Brothel. You see their mystery play out in season 1. They both are running from the past.  You can usually find Jackson in some woman's' bed or with a bottle in his hand, drunk or in varies stages of intoxication.  But as he tells Reid during a heated argument, he is the best he's got drunk or sober.  Ummm yeah it's so true!!

With that said I like to call Jackson, the forensic scientist  of their time!  He is a doctor and US soldier who Reid depends on heavily when there is a crime to solve.  Reid believes in science (what we now call forensic science) while others, like Drake isn't as convinced and sees Jackson as just a drunk, crude American.  As the seasons go on that soon changes for Drake, at least the need of Jackson's medical/science knowledge.

I would say that he and Reid are even friends and get on each others nerves as friends can do but will have each others backs in the end.  Season 3 opens with them not in a good place nor speaking to one another. You will learn why.

Of course there are other characters like Ms. Susan and Rose, who is a prostitute and whom Drake loves so much but can they have a real future when they are both so, well, messed up?  Maybe.  Season 3 continues with their story as well.  Other loose ends are tied up as well for Det Reid which I am so happy to see!

If you check, you will probably see this as my only review.  I usually don't do them.  But for Ripper Street I just had to.  That is how much I truly enjoy this program and hope to see it continue for as log as it can and as long as Amazon has faith in it, like many of the fans do!",1450137600,,3643,4.056022408963585

I enjoyed both Season 1 & 2 and was so disappointed when I heard BBC canceled after Season 2 after it was just getting started. Fantastic season to tie up the loose sends to season 1 & 2. Was happily surprised as most season finales are disappointing. The rumor is there will be a season 4....fingers crossed

I believe the chemistry of the five main characters make the show, three main male characters and two female.

My personal favorite is Jerome Flynn as Detective Inspector Bennet Drake, who Game of Thrones fans will know as Bronn. In this season Adam Rothenberg as Captain Homer Jackson, a former US Army surgeon and Pinkerton agent is my second favorite. Followed by Matthew Macfadyen as Detective Inspector Edmund Reid, the head of East London's H Division who I feel was stronger in the previous season, but it works brilliantly.

The two main female characters are great also Charlene McKenna as Rose and Myanna Buring who plays Susan. Rose has completely changed since her introduction in Season 1 and we finally get to see a side of Myanna that we all knew was waiting to strike.

Give it a shoot I believe you will be hooked!",1444780800,,1215,4.663551401869159

6998945,5,B00T3IKQM2,"Seems to be a consensus floating about on season 3 being the best of the lot. Quite intelligent storytelling with intelligent dialogue, good suspense although sometimes a bit predictable. Authentic dirt & dust & sets & props & costuming. Would have helped, and this is consistently true for period movies, if the actors appearances were more authentic, e.g. mottled teeth, splotchy skin, bugs in the hair. Usual twists 'n turns in suspense, crime dramas. Rare 8+ rating from IMDb.

If you haven't figured it out or already know it's East London, late 1800s and shortly after Jack the Ripper. Follows the Sherlock style work of British and America transplant detectives.

Hard to believe that BBC canceled the show after the second season only to be rescued by Amazon (who would have thought) and even though it had a finale feel to it supposedly it's up for another year or more.",1440460800,,879,4.8533333333333335

6998950,5,B00T3IKQM2,"The third season started out a little slowly and I missed the good working relationships of Reid, Drake, and Jackson.  They were all at odds with each other  But the end of the season was lovely and I liked where all the characters ended up.  A little sad, but good.

I don't know that people really talked this way in the 19th century, but the language is lovely to listen to...

I'm assuming that this is the end of the series...at least, if it isn't, it should be.",1440115200,,467,4.261363636363637
6998951,5,B00T3IKQM2,"This series is well thought out with dynamic characters. It takes place in the White Chapel district and is based around the police left to deal with a depressed area in the aftermath of Jack the Ripper. It has everything: Corrupt business people, the treatment and incarceration of gays and Jewish people, divorce, and, of course crime. These characters are complex and real. Fabulous show!

6998957,5,B00T3IKQM2,I think the British TV series most times are far above the US shows in entertainment value and how they r produced.  I love the period based shows and the cast was excellent!  Hated to see it end with the third season but the characters were well evolved and it would have been become just another crime drama that would grow stale after a while.

We live alongside the characters in their dark and gritty Whitechapel existence, we marvel at the coming of the industrial age and unfettered capitalism, with all of its genius and its horrors.  We see the beginning of the science of forensics in London and its importance in solving crimes of all sorts.  We have some idea of what it was like in late nineteenth century London, both for the high and the low born.  I rationed my episodes so I could soak in the ambiance, the characters, and the stories all contained in these episodes.  The final episode does a good job of wrapping up the lives of the characters I had come to know.  I thank the writers, directors, costumers, set builders, lighting experts, and all involved.  You have given us a time machine with which, if only for a little while, we could experience what it must have been like to live in the past.  Bravo!",1437782400,2,932,4.538922155688622

The characters keep growing, expanding & developing...there is no such thing as absolute good or evil, all shades are found in humanity. It was interesting to learn the series had been cancelled by BBC, picked up by Amazon & will have another two additional seasons! Goes to show that quality can be recognized, appreciated & kept alive. Get the feeling for 19th century culture, society, language usage, life & times...you can almost smell the London streets!

The cinematography, set desgn, and directing/editing is superb. All the actors are spot on. Do not be turned off by the title ""Ripper Street,"" as ""the Jack the Ripper"" plot is only a catalyst  to anchor the entire fabric of the story arc.  (The series takes place after the ""Ripper"" murders.)  Fascinating use of emerging technologies (Electricity,photography, forensics) and historical events drive many of the stories.

6999078,5,B00T3IKQM2,"Thank you Amazon for reviving this excellent series.  I'm sure most of the viewers here have already watched seasons 1 & 2, so will not waste time rehashing them.  Season 3 which I recently ordered from Amazon and just finished watching, continues four years after the end of season 2 and resolves the conflict between the main characters (for the most part) as they have to cooperate together to solve a train robbery which causes the deaths of 55 innocent people in London.  The story line and plot are quite good and keeps one guessing how it will finally be solved.  Excellent performance by the actors and writers.  By the 8th and final episode, it appears that the series will end happily for everyone except possibly Homer Jackson and his estranged wife, Susan Hart (formerly Long Susan).  Now I've read that there will be a 4th and even 5th season and certainly hope that is true as I will definitely order them when they become available.  Thanks again Amazon for saving this very enjoyable show.",1437264000,,1005,4.708571428571428

6999080,5,B00T3IKQM2,"Season 3 gets off to a bit of a slow start, but with only 8 episodes it comes around pretty quickly. Long Susan has a primary role this season, Rose has changed her occupation, and there's a big surprise for Detective Inspector Reid. Without spoilers, I'll just say that one character shoots another, two go to jail, one gets a promotion, and at least one is redeemed...all in all an entertaining season!

I think they thought they might not be renewed, so they did a good job of wrapping things up in the last episodes. But, they got picked up for two more seasons. I think they left just enough doubt about the characters to make you want to come back for the new seasons.

I think this BBC show (like most) is a winner.  My husband and I are bingers - we waited until all the episodes had aired, then bought the whole season here and watched all of them in two days. We're currently going through withdrawals!",1437177600,,912,4.384615384615385

6999144,5,B00T3IKQM2,"Season 3 of Ripper Street is the best by far. For those who come to the last episode and fear the series is coming to an end, don't fret. It has been renewed for a season 4 and 5.
I have a very angry complaint however...the series is not uncut. Episode 6 is supposed to be 75min long. It's roughly 61min...episode 6 from what I saw had some of the best writing and acting thus far. To butcher this fabulous series is in my book criminal and an injustice against the cast whose delivery and acting is nothing short of superb.

In case you're wondering, the episodes on US Amazon Prime and U.S. iTunes are also cut...as will the upcoming UK DVD. The only way to see the episodes uncut is to have access to UK Amazon Prime and live in the UK, as that is the only way to receive UK Amazon Prime due to the strict licensing laws.
Or write UK Amazon and complain, ""why can we not see this fabulous series in its entirety?'",1436140800,16,916,4.175141242937853
6999145,5,B00T3IKQM2,"Powerful performances, beautifully written dialogue delivered beautifully.  This season is as fine as the earlier two.  I cannot recommend this too highly.  Marvelous television.  Matthew MacFadyen makes history.  The entire cast is great. Production values are dazzling.  What fascinates more than anything are the profound moral questions and moral confrontations.

6999202,5,B00T3IKQM2,"Season 3 was the best yet. The ending of this season was very satisfying. I find it tiring when shows feel the need to have cliffhangers at the end of a season. This was wrapped up nicely, probably, because they were unsure they would have a 4th season. I am grateful they are. This season was so well written and had a great storyline through out.",1435968000,,348,4.287878787878788

What ?  he forgot she told him his daughter was dead & buried and was sending her to France - what ? On the other hand, the production is outstanding!  The costumes, locations, scenery, buildings ( inside & outside) are so authentic as to transport one back to that period.

6999278,4,B00T3IKQM2,"Still a decent Blu-ray set. Lots of talk about editing (and the BBC has indeed been guilty of this before on their DVD/BD releases, it's usually due to musical/song royalties/clearances though). I'm not sure if these are really edited from what's available to watch online, the times look similar to the Amazon.com times, but the Amazon.co.uk times might be longer. Here's what I found by checking the BD episode times in my Oppo BD player:

Episode 1 - 1:01:45
Episode 2 - 1:01:43
Episode 3 - 1:00:52
Episode 4 - 1:01:38
Episode 5 - 1:01:43
Episode 6 - 1:02:06
Episode 7 - 1:01:46
Episode 8 - 1:01:52

There are absolutely NO extras on these two BD discs. No commentary, no nothing. It doesn't bother me, but some people like them. It's also interesting to note that this 3rd series BD is presented in only 2.0 stereo, not 5.1 as the last series was. So there is no surround, your surround/back speakers will sit this one out. Blu-ray.com says it was probably due to budget cuts. But it still sounds good and has subwoofer support. These discs DO have English subtitles.

I was happy to get them on BD because I like the series but I don't have cable and I didn't want to pay 2 or 3 bucks each to watch them online.",1435190400,3,1216,4.443946188340807

Glad to see all of the old cast and some new faces-felt like visiting old friends and I can't wait to see what they do next.

6999366,4,B00T3IKQM2,"The characters are almost uniformly extraordinary.  Sgt Drake says more with his eyes than many of the best big screen actors.  The ""American"" is great, and where did they get the one-eared newsman.  Dickens comes to mind with so many of the characters.

I'm not a big fan of Inspector Reid, the character,  but maybe I'm not supposed to be and he still is a great actor.

Some of the stories are better than orhets, of course, but all around very entertaining.  Too bad that irs almost over, if I understand correctly.",1433721600,,519,4.576086956521739

The characters do continue to grow more complex, and there so many layers to the story. Its dark and gritty (eew buzzwords sorry) but there are moments of joy and love and even comedy.

I like that the series is about the working class in England and how they fought to survive. I enjoy the American doctor and how he helps the cops figure out crimes and how money and power corrupts just about anything.  I had read that this was to be Ripper Street last season on BBC, but then I read that Amazon was going to pick up the series and there would be a season 4. I thought that was fantastic news. I watch this series faithfully and can't wait for the next episode. It just keeps getting better and better. I even missed a couple of episodes of season 3 and had to purchase the episodes through Amazon, which I didn't mind doing. I enjoy the show that much.",1432944000,,801,4.201298701298701

not only unexpected, but beautifully realized.  Obviously, I'm a fan, but I came to the show late, and uninitiated.  I had no idea
what to expect when I jumped into season one, but I was taken in right away, and have rarely been disappointed by any episode since.

6999492,5,B00T3IKQM2,"This show, in my opinion, is outstanding. The series has a thread that ties each episode together, yet each can be seen independently if that is what a viewer chooses to do. The acting is superior to most shows out today and the story line is brilliant. One episode doesn't end without me wanting to see the next immediately.  In today's world of competing media, and hundreds of television channels to chose from,  this show is definitely on the ""must see"" list.
