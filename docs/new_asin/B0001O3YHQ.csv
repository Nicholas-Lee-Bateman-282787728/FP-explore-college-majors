2021559,5,B0001O3YHQ,"I lucked out and found a place that put it on the shelf early!  What a great improvement over the first season.
There are a few changes over the first!  One of the better features would be that on each disc, you can either play each episode individually or play all the episodes at once per disc.  I thought about that when I watched the first season and love that little addition.
The extras are just GREAT!  First there's a retrospective on John's career, hosted by Joyce DeWitt which is incredibly touching.  It goes into his whole career from start to finish.  The bloopers reel is really funny -- and I suspect that there will be more bloopers on each season to be released because they seem to be limited to the second season on this disc.
And of course, the original pilot -- it has to be seen to be believed!  In comparing it to the pilot we all know and love, it's LOUSY!  WOW, I can see why they wanted changes!  The two girls are kind of flirty with Jack rather than the other way around and Mrs. Roper is actually kinda hard with a ""New Yoark"" accent.  Plus, the Jenny character (now Janet) is amazingly bad! Well, by comparing her delivery with Joyce, Joyce is way better.  They also seemed to flirt with a little romance between Jenny and Jack (like they did on the British series.)  Plus, there was a bit more racy innuendos in the pilot that didn't make it to the series.  MUST be seen.
Of course, everything else and all of the episodes are just great!  Way better than the first season, hands down.  I'm looking forward to watching them all over again.  A MUST buy for those fans out there.",1083369600,7,1608,4.345637583892618
2021560,4,B0001O3YHQ,"My original review was mostly correct.
But I will say that video transfer quality is an improvement over the first season and that makes me very happy.  Not just as a TRUE FAN of the show, but as a CONSCIOUS CONSUMER who thinks that people should make their products with the utmost quality.  Isn't a dollar something to be respected anymore?  (And should any of us really settle for less?)  The quality is not as great as other TV shows released on DVD (heck, some ""Doctor Who"" stories taped in 1975 look far better, and they were shot on analogue tape as well and made with a lesser budget!  And that's 2 years before Three's Company!), but I've seen far worse released and, again, season 2's quality is an improvement.
And the extras are mega-sweet!
Thank you Anchor-Bay!  Keep up the good work!",1083283200,5,798,4.545454545454546
2021561,5,B0001O3YHQ,"I loved the first season dvd, and with 25 episodes, and all the other goodies on this DVD, i cant wait to watch this one. Three's company is my favorite show of all time and John Ritter was my favorite actor as a kid growing up. I would always immitate his hilarious stunts for my friends. I will buy all the DVDs. I hope they put one out for all the seasons!!! Thanks!!!",1083110400,4,371,4.095890410958904
2021562,5,B0001O3YHQ,I'm glad it took Anchor Bay only 6 months to release the 2nd season. And I totally agree with DVDman. I'm mean come on people what did you expect. You always have your whiners about picture quality. You got to realize all these episodes were done on analog and the show was produced in the late '70s to early 80's. DVD now preserves them more clearer than the VCR counterpart. I think they did a great job with the first season. Looking forward to the extras this time and the first pilot that was done. I've never seen it. And glad they are doing to a tribute to John Ritter with Joyce Dewitt having something to do with it. I thought by far she was the best looking woman on the show.,1082505600,3,686,4.204545454545454
2021563,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Thank you Anchor Bay for releasing Three's Company Season 1 and now Season 2 on DVD. While many here will complain about the picture quality of the DVD, a true fan like me won't care about it. It's a TV Show for crying out loud, what do you expect Superbit? Season 1 was short but great but Season 2 is going to be way better and has more episodes and bonus features. If you're an appreciative fan of Three's Company like I am then you will go right now and buy this DVD set. Enjoy!!",1082332800,2,483,4.094736842105263
2021564,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Well this is  a priceless DVD set with season #2. The first set was only six(6) shows and was a summer replacement show.
With the recent passing of John Ritter which shocked all of us,this collection of 25 shows shows Jack at his best. It's both pure humor as well as slapstick where all ages will laugh and keep on laughing. Watching Jack live with the girls is not to be missed! And don't forget the other character actors such as the Ropers/Larry etc. and you have the whole barrel of monkeys. Pick it up today as these plots started the  all of the future comedy shows  Jack Tripper(John Ritter) was a first rate comedian and he will be missed and with this collection you will watch over and over again! Chrissy! Janet!",1080518400,4,724,4.428571428571429

Three's Company is a show that will last forever, it so much better than anything on TV today in comedy (Perhaps excluding the Big Bang Theory). This is a golden show and there will never be anything as funny or sweet. I recommend fans to buy it, and I HIGHLY encourage everyone who is going ""What's Three's Company?"" to just go ahead and purchase it because it is AMAZING!

My favorites in this season are Strange Bedfellows and Jack in the Flowershop",1368144000,2,549,4.382352941176471

My point is I am a hardcore fan of this TV Series so I wanted it bad enough that I don't even mind these downsides at all. The Series themselves are awesome and the best so it's up to you. I say don't miss out just because of a little less quality.,1364515200,,363,3.9863013698630136

Jack, Chrissy, and Janet are back, and they're still delivering tons of incidental and situational humor. To me this show always seems like it is kind of hidden in the shadows. This show needs you to bring it out into the light. So many people haven't found this show, but when they do, they will not be disappointed. I've been a long time fan of this show, and one thing I really like about this DVD release, is the awesome special features.it comes with a never before seen pilot, without Joyce Dewitt and Suzanne Summers. It's really funny to watch this episode and to think about what this show would've been like without the hilarious pair of women. So buy this DVD, pop it in the player, and be transported back into a place in time, when life was simple, and John Ritter lived with two hilarious women.

2021912,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Three's Company brings back a certain nostalgia from the the late 70s/early 80s that felt fun, warm, and engaging. This is a positive, bubbly and fun show with immensely talented actors truly inhabiting their characters.

This is the first time I saw this show and it's a great watch not just for me but also the family. (Some stuff is probably not suitable for a 13 year old.)

Also in the extras, they have the alternate Pilot episode in which DeWitt and Sommers are not there but different set of actresses (they are really good too).

Actually I'd gone through Season 3 and 4 prior to this and had thought Season 4 with Mr Furley was a bit better than Season 3, but Season 2 is reminding me how much I loved episodes that centered around the Ropers.  The first disc (in Season 2) was just ok, 3 or 4 stars, but Three's Company really finds it's groove by disc 2 and rides that 5 star level - I was busting up all the way through - not surprisingly most of these episodes really involve the Ropers. Stanley and his wife (""Mrs Roper"", aka Helen) just crack me up!  Especially Mr Roper - man, he is so hilarious in his uptight, cheapskate way. Especially when he looks in the camera...  And of course, the girls and Jack are right in their prime (Chrissy is mind-boggling), at the height of fashion 1977. Although I was only 7 at the time, it's still good nostalgia... of course, I wasn't watching these when I was 7, but a good few years later we were catching re-runs when my parents weren't looking and that is what warms me right up again after all these years.

I watched this series as a young child when it was on tv and used to naively laugh, especially with the physical comedy of John Ritter.  As an adult of almost 40, I still laugh out loud.  This is actually a really good comedy for just about the whole family because, although there are various innuendos, most young kids won't understand them.  It's ashame that there aren't more comedies like this on tv now.  I'd recommend this series to anyone.",1216944000,3,545,4.577319587628866

2021959,4,B0001O3YHQ,"There are a lot of die-hard Three's Company fans out there that waited a long time for the series to come out on DVD.  I do not claim to be a die-hard, but I've certainly seen my share of the show and am pleasantly surprised at how much I've enjoyed revisiting the show after not having seen it for many years (10+!).  Certainly there are some topics and situations that make the show seem quaint and/or dated: witness Jack's (over)reaction at the idea that he has a cannabis plant in his apartment, or the general portrayal (or lack thereof) of homosexuality.  But it's all harmless fun, and there are times (especially with sexual innuendoes) where the show could pass as modern.

There are lots of great episodes here, and admittedly some that are not that great.  Certainly the cast has settled into their characters, and the ensemble is a well-oiled machine: the ditzy non-sequitors of Chrissie, the physical contortions of Jack, Janet's sly puns, and the Ropers.... well, unfortunately the Ropers are a 1-joke bit and it gets very tiresome when watching these episodes close together.  Luckily the Ropers fare better when given time to interact with the rest of the cast.

There are some pretty decent extras on this disc - notably the 1st pilot episode (containing the same plot and many of the same jokes as the actual first episode of the series).  Most interesting is, of course, the fact that only 3 of the 5 main cast members are actually in this pilot.  The rearrangement of the parts is interesting to see (the ""Janet"" part is more sexually aggressive, while Mrs. Roper is at least as uptight with the kids as Mr. Roper).  So overall, this is a good DVD edition of the show.",1183248000,,1688,4.653198653198653

I LOVE THIS DVD, BRINGS BACK LAUGHTER AND MEMORYS AND YOU NEVER GET BORED WITH IT,",1181088000,3,99,4.2105263157894735
2021961,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Although I love ""Three's Company"" throughout its run, I think the early seasons - including this one - are the best. Here, we have Janet not looking like she applied makeup with a trowel, and Chrissy not being so over-the-top. Her hair is blonde, but not yet platinum; and while she's a bit fluffy, she's not a complete moron. Within a few more seasons, Chrissy becomes almost a caricature of herself, unrecognizable as anything but a stereotype. This is, perhaps, due to the behind-the-scenes struggles between actress Suzanne Somers, her co-actors and the producers; it seems as though they felt while they were required to keep her character in the show at least nominally, they didn't have to flatter her in doing so. They may have had their reasons for doing so, but it's blatantly obvious to viewers, and takes away from the enjoyment in the show...which should be the No. 1 goal for both the cast and crew.

My main peeve with this season is the Ropers. While they do provide comic relief - especially Stanley - I just get sick of Helen's constant innuendos about her lack of sex life. If it were more sporadic, it'd be a lot funnier than when she's moaning about it 24/7. It makes her seem almost one-dimensional. And, if she's so agitated about appealing to her husband...what's with the muu-muus, huge fake jewelry and big poofy clown hair? I wasn't alive in the '70s, but I seriously doubt anyone looked THAT ridiculous...

Perhaps the best part of this box set is the extras. I especially love the addition of bloopers, and the best of John Ritter - classic!",1175731200,3,1570,4.684782608695652

2022004,5,B0001O3YHQ,"With a new concept, immediate success is never given. Three's Company started off with a lot of press about the sexual overtones surrounding the show. They were singled out as a trend in TV during the mid to late 1970's. After the fire though, the show stayed the course by providing undeniable laughs establishing it as a true powerhouse in the Nielsen ratings.

In Season two, we see the transformation of Chrissy from a blonde to a dumb blonde. The formula was a hit as the laughs were more consistent. The featuring of Larry Dallas also was exceptional and a true sign of things to come. With these changes, the regulars also excelled. Janet became more ""bossy"", the Ropers more argumentatively hilarious. Jack himself was over the top funny! John Ritter excelled in more physical humor and traditional sitcom as well. As a group the cast was gelling and becoming very big.

This compilation features an impressive 25 episodes all providing great laughs.

Ground Rules - Jack leads the charge for rules on apartment reservation times, but is the first to break them.

Jack Looks for a Job - Jack is desperate for a job, but how desperate?

Janet's Promotion - Janet is on the verge of a promotion at the flower shop, but her chauvinistic boss decides on a novice with a perky ""personality"".

Strange Bedfellows - Jack and Stanley wake up together in bed...enough said. Great neurotic acting by Norman Fell in this episode.

Chrissy's Date - An older man (Dick Sargent) comes into Chrissy's life, but his marital status is in question. Jack and Janet team up to warn Chrissy.

Alone Together - Jack and Chrissy are both together one night. Will Jack pursue, will Chrissy give in?

Roper's Car - Stanley sells his lemon to the ""kids"" only to find out his lemon is a classic.

Cyrano de Tripper - Jack plays the ultimate friend as the cook for Chrissy's date. Her date though is a critic that tests Jack's patience.

Chrissy's Night Out - Chrissy is crushed to have been misidentified as a hooker. Her accuser (a policeman) tries to make it up to her.

Stanley Casanova - Stanley tries to prove (and succeeds, kind of) his undeniable sexual appeal to other younger women.

Janet's High School Sweetheart - Janet is on cloud nine when an old jock from her high school asks her out. He is not though a gentleman.

Jack's Uncle - Uncle Fremont is a player with a nasty habit of cutting bad checks. His latest blunder may cost the ""kids"" a roof over their heads.

Helen's Job - Helen wants an increase in her allowance...Stanley will not allow it. She takes a job out of desperation, but does not like it.

Three's Company - Tis the season for a Christmas Party, but the only option is a Christmas with the Ropers. Only Chrissy Snow favors the idea.

The Gift - Stanley has Jack hold an expensive coat for Ms. Roper. It is Chrissy's birthday though and she thinks the coat is for her.

The Rivals - It was only a matter of time before Chrissy and Janet would get tangled up over a man. Except Chrissy is clueless to the situation.

The Baby Sitters - Janet convinces Jack and Chrissy to fill in for her baby sitting duties.

Home Movies - Chrissy lands her self an 8mm and becomes the new amateur filmmaker. Larry knowing of a projector she had rented out convinces Jack to host a night of ""Adult"" movies.

Jack in the Flower Shop - Janet offers Jack a job, but Jack cannot transition himself from a friend to a co-worker.

Jack's Navy Pal - A blind ""friend"" of Jack raises a ruckus as the ""kids"" try to treat the Ropers to Dinner.

Will the Real Jack Tripper...- Jack is in for it as he learns he has impregnated his girlfriend. Only, it isn't who he thinks it is. Richard Kline shines in this episode.

Days of Beer and Weeds - The kids stumble across some cannabis (according to Larry) and must relay a message to Mr. Roper to prevent Mrs. Roper from potential criminal charges. An exceptional episode.

Chrissy, Come Home - Chrissy's father is outraged that Jack lives with the girls. Chrissy must somehow convince him that she deserves to remain put and not be summoned home.

Bird Song - Frank Sinatra tickets and a bird take center stage for a great episode.

Coffee, Tea or Jack - Jack's old flame heats things up, but is he being fooled once again?

Season two especially excels in providing hilarious laughs and memorable moments. A great gift for a fan of 70's sitcoms.",1160352000,4,4377,4.548469387755102

2022040,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Bursting onto the television landscape in Spring 1977, Three's Company quickly skyrocketed in the ratings - cracking the top 8 every season except its last. Sporting a plethora of quirky characters and fresh writing talent that explored modern day issues, the show held its own as one of the funniest programs on TV. Picking up where All In The Family left off, Three's Company delved into the social taboos of its day, dealing with subjects such as homosexuality, racism, sexual harassment, and of course, unmarried men and women living together... But the true success of Three's Company stemmed from the comic talents of John Ritter and Suzanne Somers who became instant stars as a result of their respective roles on the show...

In Three's Company, John Ritter plays the role of Jack Tripper, a young cooking student in San Diego who wants to move into an apartment with his two female friends - the far more mature Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and the blonde and ditsy Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers). But the three friends face the possible wrath of landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell), an old-fashioned guy who would never allow such an arrangement. With the aid of Roper's wife Helen (Audra Lindley), the three manage to convince Stanley that Jack is gay (when he is, in fact, a notorious ladies man). Jack's friend Larry (Richard Kline) also fashions himself a player on the local singles scene, and he makes regular appearances on the show. Following Season 3, Stanley and Helen left the show in pursuit of their own spin-off titled The Ropers. Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith Show fame) was brought in to play the new landlord, Mr. Furley - a nave, loud-mouthed ditz who tripled the hilarity of every scene in which he appeared...

The Three's Company (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Ground Rules"" in which Jack and Chrissy constantly interrupt Janet and her date. The incident causes Janet to demand that ground rules be laid down, and the three roommates agree to abide by ""reservation times"" when the other two roommates will agree to stay far away. The agreement doesn't last long when Jack gets the offer of a lifetime and reneges on his part of the agreement... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Strange Bedfellows"" in which Jack throws a party and wakes up to find Mr. Roper in his bed, and ""Chrissy's Night Out"" in which Chrissy gets inadvertently arrested for prostitution...

But they really did a good job on Season 2's presentation, it is worth the money.

Over all the show it worth it.",1098144000,3,292,4.178571428571429
2022048,4,B0001O3YHQ,I love it because of all the years I have been watching the show this certinly makes it better considering the never before scene footage scince it went on the air.,1094860800,3,164,4.32258064516129
2022049,5,B0001O3YHQ,"The strength of this THREE'S COMPANY Season 2 DVD lay primarily in its bonus materials and liner notes.  Everyone has seen these episodes a thousand times, including now on TV Land and Nick at Night. Sure, it's nice to have uncut, digitally-transferred episodes of this classic show. Consumers should expect nothing less in any dvd tv series release.

But what elevates this release, and hopefully those to come in this series, are the bonus features, particularly the content newly-created for this DVD set  and liner notes. Much of this detailed  content is clearly due to Chris Mann, author of the well-respected and insightful biography of ""Three's Company,"" titled ""Come and Knock on Our Door,"" for which he interviewed nearly the entire cast and production staff.  (Watch The E! True Hollywood Story again if you doubt that statement.) As a respected author and a producer of NBCs recent ""Three's Company"" behind-the-scenes movie, Chris brings depth and the perspective of an insider and expert to this project.  The liner notes and his heartfelt audio commentary show how much he loved and respected John Ritter. And by the way, when John R. appeared on several talk shows after the book's release, he genuinely championed the book.

Mann's audio commentary contains reverent thoughts and stories about John Ritter,  the rest of the cast and producers.  But it is balanced with light-hearted, sometimes tongue-in-cheek observations about the show and the specific farcical episode being discussed. Mann seems to realize that most people loved this show for what it was and and hoped this season 2 ""commemorative"" release would pay respect to John and the show.  (Let's not forget the rushed-for-profit-and-exposure First Season release that was such a disappointment to all of us.)  Chris understands that the show never took itself too seriously, so I would consider him an expert commentator and trusted voice for fans and those who made the show.

My friends and I have heard that Chris wrote a lot of the tribute to John Ritter that  Joyce DeWitt narrates in this Season 2 release as well. Apparently, this ""commemorative"" release would have had little, if any, tributes to John without Mann's involvement. There's buzz among fans that several ""Three's Company"" cast and crew interviewed for the Third Season release, and that Chris interviewed all of them.  So, I would guess that Chris is greatly responsible for their participation.

We all look forward to  the upcoming dvd releases of ""Three's Company.""  We  hope that those involved in distributing the series continue to have Chris be a major part of its production!! Anchor Bay and DLT Ent. should consider themselves lucky to have his cooperation.",1092182400,40,2717,5.122448979591836
2022067,4,B0001O3YHQ,"THE SHOW:
Season 2 isn't the greatest of seasons. At this point the show is still too focussed on life in and around their apartment. That is, it lacks variety in setting. If it's not the trio's yellow apartment we're seeing, it's the Roper's apartment. Speaking of the Ropers, there's a little too much focus on these characters for my taste. Now LARRY, now he was a breath of fresh air when he finally showed up. He wasn't featured in as many episodes as he should have been.  New blood is always good, as the show was suffocating in its repetition stemming largely from a limited cast. Episodes with Larry stood out for me. Stanley and Helen became tedious and their interplay predictable and been-there, done-that. I very much look forward to Mr. Furley replacing them, that guy was hilarious. In addition I look forward to Jack in the restaurant, or anything else that gets the cast out of that same old apartment setting.

PICTURE QUALITY:
The shows look great. Way better than television, these episodes look crisp and clear. And they look infinitely better than botched TV DVDs of much newer shows, like Xena: Warrior Princess Season 1, which was a total hack job of a transfer if there ever was one. However, the Three's Company set isn't perfect, as a couple of episodes seemed to have 3 faint horizontal yellow bars spread across the screen. Not really distracting, but noticeable. I wonder what's up with that. Other than that, no real complaints.

EXTRAS:
Very good. However, there's only one commentary, and it's from some fan who wrote a book. Who cares about him? Not me, not anyone. Listen to the track, though. That guy is so lame you will laugh in pity. Haha.

THE PACKAGING:
I must say I like the simplicity of the design. The discs are easy and quick to get to (it's a book), and everything looks pretty nice at that. I don't really like the fold-out design of some other sets; too cumbersome and inconvenient.

OVERALL:
A decent season of Three's Company on a good DVD set. (The show is funny, but not quite ha-ha funny just yet.)",1091491200,9,2052,4.626373626373627
2022068,5,B0001O3YHQ,"I'm so happy that finally the funniest and cutest Sitcom is able to be owned. That sitcom was aired here in germany a few times and i loved it so much. Years ago i kept saying to myself how i would like to have all the episodes on video to watch it again and again. I would never have thought at that time that i would be able to buy them (ten years later) on a disc!
I really hope so much that all seasons will be released since there are so many awesome episodes. And that blooper real - Keep bringing more of them! Those two DVD-Sets will get a very nice place on my shelf. And i hope they will be joined by six other set's soon..... ;)",1087257600,5,639,3.923076923076923
2022069,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Here are the 25 episodes of Three Company's second season which ran from September 1977 to May 1978. Richard Kline's role of Larry Dallas is more recurred this season and also would be for 1978-79. Here we see Jack(the late John Ritter),Janet(Joyce DeWitt) and Chrissy(Suzanne Somers) devising a system so each one could have an evening alone in their apartment. Jack sells encyclopedia sets. Janet almost gets breast implants. Jack throws a party in the girls' absence and wakes up with landlord Stanley Roper(the late Norman Fell) in Jack's bed. Chrissy is romantically involved with a divorced businessman. Stanley goes away to look at property he might buy. Stanley sells the trio his 1958 Chevy. Jack cooks dinner for Chrissy and her food critic boyfriend. Jack is almost arrested for assaulting a cop who harrassed Chrissy. Stanley is found attractive by women other than his wife Helen(the late Audra Lindley). Janet and an old male friend from high school spend a disasterous evening alone in the trio's apartment. Jack's visiting uncle pays Jack's share of the overdue rent. Helen takes a job at a cafeteria adjoining Janet's flower shop. Jack buys a jacket for Stanley to give to Helen(Chrissy thought it was a birthday gift). Chrissy steals the guy Janet has a business date with. Jack and Chrissy babysit for a couple,subbing for Janet. Chrissy gets into her new movie camera(Kline's 2nd appearance). Jack works with Janet until he's fired for failing to deliver. A mean acquaintance from Jack's naval base ruins an evening of dinner amongst the trio and the Ropers. A pregnant girl tells Janet and Chrissy that Jack is the father. The trio finds cannabis in the Ropers' garden. Chrissy's minister father Luther visits and meets Jack for the first time. Stanley gives Helen a parakeet for their wedding anniversary(the bird becomes sick and later recovers). Jack's stewardess girlfriend visits Jack for his birthday. Also there's the Christmas episode where the trio spend the holiday at the Ropers' apartment.",1086134400,4,2022,5.093373493975903
2022070,5,B0001O3YHQ,I have been waiting for this for a long time..Season 1 was great..Season 2....THE BEST!!!

He just was cool with His Brand of Humor.suzanne summer's was cool but I always dug me some Joyce Dewitt. Larry was a cool cat.the Ropers still trip me out. I dig all the Bonus Material&Extra's involved that were missing from the first season.,1085270400,,359,4.625
2022072,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Season Two of ""Three's Company"" speaks for itself-a classic
series of the sexual revolution finding it's legs. But the
unaired piolot?Well it's the same basic premis as the aired
version-two girls find man in bathtub,asks him to room with them
and he pretends he's gay in order to stay. But the only other
Three things that are alike about this Three's Company are the
Ropers,the actors that play them and John Ritter. But David Bell?
I can ONLY accept Ritter as Jack Tripper-sorry. Aside from the pilot this is a BARGAIN at four DVD's,Great bloopers,a featurette
and tribut to the much missed Ritter and the hilarious ""Days Of
Beer And Weeds"" where the gang discover certain 'illegal' plants
growing in their backyard. 25 laughs all the way,NO CONTEST in the
superiority of this set's image quality compared to the first and
even two collectors coasters for your pleasure. I'm sure John
Ritter would've been pleased and 'Three's' fans WILL not be
dissappointed!",1084752000,,962,4.944444444444445
2022073,4,B0001O3YHQ,"When I first got the 2nd season I went straight to the unaired pilot.  It was like the Bizarro world/Twilight Zone episode. First the funky yet odd opening scene and music. The Brunette girl (wannabe Janet) is not really a good actress. And what's up with the Ditzy blonde? The apartment is setup differently.  Jack's I mean Dave's (lol) room is next to the washroom.  And what's the deal with Mrs. Roeper looking like a disco diva with an attitude?  She really let the roommates have it. Though this pilot is not that funny, I would recommend buying the 2nd season just for this alone, as for the rest of the extras and all the episodes are awesome!!!",1084406400,3,652,4.5
2022074,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Despite the cover art, this show speaks for itself.  It is a true classic...a time capsule, if you will, of the world of the single person in the late '70s.  I am really amazed at how well the transfer from tv to DVD this show made.  The picture and sound are really clear...and it captures the essence of the show fabulously.  I also like the fact that there are many special features beyond the episodes....which makes this set a worthy steal...and a great piece of art/television history.  I think the homage to John Ritter is great...and well deserved.  I wonder what they'll have in store for Season 3.  Guess we'll have to tune in to find out!  Until then, go out and get seasons 1 and 2 of this special show.  It's well worth the money.",1083974400,,743,4.404411764705882
2022075,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Three's Company, Season Two is a great DVD set for fans of the sitcom. They say a television series is either made or cancelled by the merits of its second crucial season and Three's Company came through with shining colors. Watching these episodes last night clearly showed me why this particular sitcom became such a sensation so quickly overnight.
There's almost too many hilarious episodes in this set. My particular favorite is ""Strange Bed Fellows"", always one of the funniest of all Three's Company episodes. The chemistry between Norman Fell and John Ritter was rare and made for endless laughs that never seemed to get tired or redundant.
In this set you get the complete season two, as well as some pretty fun extras. I got a kick out of watching the first ever filmed ppilot original where Jack is named David and there's two completely other actresses playing the parts of his much more flirtacious roomates and Mister Roper is named ""George"" while Mrs Roper seems much harder-edged and hard. I'm happy they decided to make the changes they did, but it's fascinating to imagine what the show would have been had it continued along these lines instead.
True, the episodes themselves are mastered somewhat lesser than I would truly wish for, being a lifelong fan of the show since my childhood. But I have been told that this is probably about as good a quality as you can expect from digitizing an older TV show. I really can't say?
There's even a fun trivia game included with a surprise reward at the end. Overall, this is a fun set and is priced very low considering all that you're getting.
After seeing Loni Anderson make a cameo role in one of the episodes, I got a brilliant idea: I can't wait for someone to begin releasing yearly series of the ultra-classic TV sitcom ""WKRP In Cincinatti""! Please!",1083715200,4,1817,4.716981132075472

8015611,5,B0001O3YHQ,"Finally this series has the entire full first season with twenty plus episodes and extras like the very first pilot with Valerie Curtin (All The Presidents' Men) in a very different ""Three's Company"" where Jack Tripper was David, an aspiring film director originally from New York. The pilot was filmed without Joyce DeWitt and Suzanne Somers as roommates.

The second season has complete episodes with the entire length rather than the syndicated episodes (which were cut at the end). Remember that Christmas episode where the Ropers and roommates went to the Stevens party, well that was cut at the end in syndication. Like other episodes, you can see the entire length of the episode.

Guest appearances included Dick Sargent (Bewitched); Lee Bryant (Airplane); Joyce Bunifant; Anne Schedeen (Alf); Richard Kline (Larry) and more as well. This cast was perfect in casting with Joyce DeWitt as Janet Wood; John Ritter as Jack Tripper; Suzanne Somers as Chrissy Snow; Norman Fell as Stanley Roper and Audra Lindley was Helen Roper.

The extras include a special tribute to John Ritter (1948 to 2003) who died sadly at 55 years old. Joyce gives a touching tribute to her late co-star and friend. I wished there were tributes to Norman Fell, Audra Lindley and Don Knotts who we lost as well. Still there are funny outtakes and other extras worth seeing and adding to your DVD collection.",1501891200,,1386,4.9655172413793105
