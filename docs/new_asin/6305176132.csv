7884361,4,6305176132,South Park Volume 1 does not compare to Later South Park. Animation is a bit crude.but it is a classic and very very funny.with time South Park got better and better.,1244937600,,166,4.387096774193548
7884362,5,6305176132,"South park is one of the best shows on any station.  Sure some people complain about the language and some of the gags, but if you look and you do not have to look all that hard you will find meaningful commentaries on modern life just underneath the toilet humor.  Some of the best episodes are on this volume such as Big Gay Al's big gay boat ride and Volcano, oh hell all of the epidsodes on this volume are winners.",1000080000,,419,4.160493827160494
7884363,5,6305176132,"Okay, well- I'm adding this part to all my South Park Reviews: For this price for four episodes, this is a great deal. I remember buying the VHS versions first (which are split up differently), and feeling I got ripped off on those once I saw how great these DVDs were.  I'll review each individual episode the best I can remember now...
Cartman Gets an Anal Probe: This apparently took Matt and Trey a couple of months to do because they were still using construction paper cutouts. You could totally tell the animation style shift a little between this pilot episode and the rest of them. But as for the story, it's a classic. Anything story that revolves around Cartman I find pretty funny, and this is no exception.
Volcano: Not my favorite episode, but still- it's funny to see Matt and Trey try to make fun of some social concern like hunting for sport. Anyway, cameo by Patrick Duffy. heh heh.
Weight Gain 4000: One of the most hilarious episodes of all time. Cartman trys to get all big and buff with this stuff called Weight Gain 4000. It's funny to see Cartman interact with other people and with the TV.
Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride: This episode had some incredibly funny moments in it and also introduced a character that many people seem to love- Big Gay Al. He shows up in the Movie too, so if you haven't seen this episode, you really should to get some background info on him.",982627200,3,1395,4.44921875
7884364,3,6305176132,"For the price of this disc- especially at some places- four episodes of South Park ain't bad.  These are four pretty funny episodes.  Now I could've given this 5 stars, but why didn't I?  First of all, the video kinda sucks.  I don't know what these other people are talking about but the audio sounded fine; typical South Park fare.  But the video just seemed grainy to me.  For graphics so simple, was it really that hard to get a good video quality out of this?  But the video quality doesn't really bother me after staring at the screen for a minute or two.  What REALLY bothers me is the fact that you're forced to sit through what seems like endless blathering of Matt and Trey (the creators) before each episode.  It's a little interesting the first time, but it quickly becomes extremely stupid and pointless, and having to sit through it EVERY time you want to view an episode without being able to skip it is just inexcusable. And what does this disc have in the way of extras?  A string of Comedy Central show ads.  Like I really want to sit through 15 minutes of Make Me Laugh and Win Ben Stein's Money ads.  Just skip it, especially considering half those shows have been dead for a while.
These are four good episodes and I definately recommend this DVD (and the five others) to anyone who has a DVD player and is a South Park fan, but the quality of this disc easily could have been much higher, thus it does not deserve a high rating.",980294400,14,1450,4.369402985074627
7884365,4,6305176132,"How about chapter stops and fixing the sound problems?  :)  Apart from that, the South Park DVDs are great to have.  Trey and Matt could have just let the shows be put on a disc and sent out the door, but they went one  step further and made introductions to each episode.  In my opinion, some  of these are funnier than South Park!  I especially like the Fireside Chat  intros - good use of the camera in those.",949795200,8,412,4.1923076923076925
7884366,4,6305176132,"This DVD had me ROTFL.  ""Kwitcher bitchin'!""  I didn't notice any sound problems.  I wish it had been possible to access the episodes directly without having to go through the cheesy commentary.  Perhaps the  next group of DVDs could be organized better?",935452800,3,254,4.9523809523809526
7884367,5,6305176132,"Five words:  Cartman Gets an Anal Probe.  'Nuff said.
But....I have to comment on the sound.  I too was disturbed when I first heard this DVD.  But then after watching it (and volumes 2 and 3) several times, I happened  to catch a few reruns on TV(DSS).  Lo and behold, I noticed the clicks and  pops are in the regular TV episodes IN THE EXACT SAME PLACES!! The high  quality of the DVD's just makes them much more obvious.  So, based entirely  on content, I give this DVD 5 stars!",934934400,8,482,4.2555555555555555
