5390225,5,B00A6X66N6,"I love the new ""Life Is Worth Swimming"" DVD.  I've been swimming for 44 years, and I learned a tremendous amount from this DVD.  I've found it ""Worth"" watching numerous times.  There is a tremendous amount of useful information packed into this one DVD.  I have started to implement some of the techniques & I like the results. I would highly recommend this DVD to all swimmers....from age group swimmers to Master's Swimmers. ""Life Is Worth Swimming"" is Worth Buying!",1354838400,,468,4.8125
5390226,4,B00A6X66N6,"As a swimmer and as a masters and age group coach, the DVD has become my must go to tool for coaching.  Rarely, do I find such s DVD that encompasses all facets of swimming, the fundamentals, nutrition and dryland.  As other reviewers have noted the camera angles are outstanding.",1354838400,,280,4.58
5390227,5,B00A6X66N6,"The reason I like this video is because it goes beyond the regular stroke mechanics and embraces racing philosophy, nutrition, dryland and goal setting as well.  The pace is relaxing and enables one to soak in the wisdom of the presentation.  Focus is on the fundamentals; realizing there is no magic bullet to swimming greatness.  The camera angles provide a unique perspective to assist in teaching these fundamentals to swimmers of all abilities.  The video reinforces good work ethic and is encouraging to all age groups.  If I lost my copy of the video, I would want to buy another to replace it.",1354838400,,601,4.796116504854369
5390228,5,B00A6X66N6,"As a coach of all age groups and levels, I have found a lot of very practical information that I will be able to incorporate into my daily swim practices.  The information presented is very concise and applicable to all swimming abilities.  Thank you Race Club for this new DVD.",1354665600,3,278,4.54
5390229,4,B00A6X66N6,"This DVD is a well-crafted overview of all of the key components of competitive swimming, presented in beautiful images which speaks directly to those who love water, the feeling of speed and grace in the water, and the pleasure of racing. To cover stroke technique, nutrition, goal setting creates a good description of what needs to be understood and covered by a swimmer to improve.",1354579200,,385,4.938461538461539
5390230,5,B00A6X66N6,"Whether your family is new to swimming or at an elite level, you should buy this video and watch it again and again to familiarize yourself with the many facets that are important to being great in the sport.  If you're smart you'll buy another copy and give it to your swimmer's coach. It's absolutely the most comprehensive stroke video you can find because it covers every stroke, turn, gives fundamentals, terminology but best of all, it has two elite and respected swimmers in George and Bobby demonstrating at race pace and in slow motion what proper technique looks like on land and in water. The footage was shot in such a way that the clarity and angles make you feel like you're right there watching an actual demonstration from the perfect vantage point. Dr. Hall's narration is second to none, like his training at the race club that's impacted beginner age group swimmers on up to the long list of Olympians he's coached to success. This video will get you and your swimmer excited about the best way to approach being world class fast and gives you not only water instruction but the secrets to Race Club success...land training, stretching, focus training and nutrition! Kudos to Richard Hall and his video team on amazing footage and to Dr. Hall for finding a way to impact every swimmer with his wisdom and knowledge!

From our 14 year old swimmer ""If you want to really compete to win in this sport The Race Club is the place to start and continue your training and watching this video will be a guide to help you get better in the sport. Dr. Hall shares every stroke technique and so many extras.  Because coaches don't always have the time to point out weaknesses during every practice watching this video will enable a swimmer to understand how to execute a stroke, turn, start etc...and practice it on their own.  If you want to have an edge over your competition buy it, watch it over and over and practice endlessly on the details Dr. Hall talks about and George and Bobby demonstrate!""",1354406400,4,2010,4.637640449438202

The swimming techniques DVD covers more than freestyle swimming training, it covers all four swimming strokes to help the viewer swim faster.

8547271,5,B00A6X66N6,Fun to watch these guys swimming and showing how it's supposed to be done.,1432425600,,74,4.357142857142857
8547272,5,B00A6X66N6,I have been coaching swimming for a number of years and have used all of the race club DVDs for information to share with my swimmers.  The concepts and ideas are easily explained and can be used for swimmers of all abilities,1384300800,,225,4.357142857142857
8547273,5,B00A6X66N6,"My daughter swims for a local team where the training is let's say is not creative, we saw the DVD on youtube and decided to order it.  And wow we followed some of the training tips, more of the core training and wow she went from BB times in her fly, back and free to AA times.  I would highly recommend the DVD to any parent wanting to help there child swim faster.  Thanks RACE CLUB.....",1375660800,2,390,4.105263157894737
8547274,5,B00A6X66N6,"Daughter likes the video.  She is 12 and been in USA Swimming for 3 years.  She has watched the videos a couple times, probably will again.  I'm happy with the purchase.  The instruction is good.  I think sitting on the couch and seeing the video, I think it prepares the mind/imagination... and I think that helps the swimmer grow.",1367539200,,332,4.559322033898305
8547275,4,B00A6X66N6,"Life is worth swimming is well done. The video is excellent, but for what ever reason my audio was not up to speed. It is important to watch the video frequently. Some of the dry land exercises I would avoid, and others are to rigorous for me. I am 65 years old. The portion on the supplements seem over done, but nutrition is important and the products are good. Before I go to meet my maker, I plan to visit The Race Club for swimming instructions. Being trained by Gary Hall, Sr. would definitely be cool.",1366070400,,508,4.302083333333333
8547276,5,B00A6X66N6,"This beautifully shot film includes a great array of swimming tips! Lactate swimming, mental training, drills, recovery, strength training, goal-setting, cross-training, and special kick sets are all covered here. The only thing that might have made this a little more useful would have been a notebook or a small study guide.
Still great material and worth seeing!",1365638400,3,365,5.421052631578948
8547277,1,B00A6X66N6,"This is not a training video.  In fact, it is more about pushing a product called platinum performance nutrition.  There are a couple of tips that tha narrator gives but no really training on any strokes.  However, there is a large segment in the middle of the DVD marketing protein bars, protein powder and vitamins made by Platinum Performance.  The swimmer even had a Platinum Tee shirt to push the advertisement more.  Although Hall was pushing the products (is it his company?), it seemed that the swimmer in the video was embarrased that they were using him to help promote these products.  I guess whatever he was paid to swim in the video made up for the embarrasment.  I will return this dvd since I don't want to pay 40.00 for an advertisement scheme.  Unless you like to pay for advertisements, I would pass on this dvd.",1363910400,4,831,4.605442176870748
8547278,5,B00A6X66N6,"As a professional swim coach for over 30 years, you could say I am a swim junkie. I read and watch as much as I can on the sport. Dr. Hall and the Race Club are at the absolute cutting edge of swimming, and are not afraid to go against the ""old/accepted"" beliefs about training and technique. Thus, the video has some great ""new"" insight to the sport as a whole.
The production is very well done and I believe it is a tremendous video for swimmers of all ages. This is not an ""in your face"" technique and training video. The video is relaxed and beautifully shot. This approach is unique, and I believe even better for the swimmers of today.",1363132800,6,641,4.262295081967213
8547279,5,B00A6X66N6,"This DVD is a must have for swimmers and coaches alike!

I personally loved both the beautiful cinematography by Richard Hall, and the simple, yet clear and wise narrative by Olympian, Gary Hall, Sr.

This DVD does a great job showing top swimmers, George Bovell III and Bobby Savulich, and explaining ways you can get the most out of yourself in the water.

8547280,5,B00A6X66N6,"Excellent cinematography. Beautiful scenes and descriptions of perfect technique on all four strokes. The video highlights drills and training styles used by World Class Swimmers at the Race Club. As a current colligate swimmer the most helpful and interesting chapter of the video was the Total package. What I mean by that is how to plan for a season; the mental training, gradual goal setting and information on platinum supplements.",1354838400,2,436,5.242857142857143
