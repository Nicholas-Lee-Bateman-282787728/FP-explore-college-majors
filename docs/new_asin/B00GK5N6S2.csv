6080883,5,B00GK5N6S2,"Must see movie for anyone who loves Thoroughbred Racing or enjoys an inspirational story.  Excited to see the availability of the movie ""Penny & Red: the Life of Secretariat's owner."" My wife and I watched it again last night and found it so moving on so many levels. Penny defied all odds and in doing so won the Triple Crown, the highest distinction in horse racing with Secretariat. It gives you a deep down personal insight into two racing legends...Secretariat and his amazing owner, Penny Chenery.

Even if you saw the 2010 Secretariat Disney movie, this movie produced by Penny Chenery herself and directed by her son John Tweedy gives you an inspirational view into an incredible women and her horse. The FB page says it best: ""...Pennys personal story also exemplifies the rise and sacrifices of women of her generation. The woman who emerges from this surprisingly candid documentary is no Disney princess. Yet Pennys unstinting reflection on her life of caged ambition, suddenly liberated by a horse of transcendent power, still gives off a shimmer of grace.""

We, as racing fans, owe her a debt of gratitude for sticking to her guns and making sure Secretariat had
the opportunity to show his tremendous talent on the race track. Miss Chenery is an inspiration to women, aspiring business persons, and really everyone. She honored her parents memory by following in their footsteps to ""do the right thing"" by the horse....and give him a chance to thrill
the world of racing and its fans. She truly is a great lady of horse racing...I loved her candid interviews and her reflections back on those days
during the thrilling ride thru the Triple Crown series...",1427155200,3,780,4.742647058823529
