8722739,5,B010N4GRGI,"A great movie, finally on DVD. It does a good job of showing the  transition from horse cavalry to mechanization that occurred before the U.S. involvement in World War 2. In my opinion Wallace Berry at his best with an excellent supporting cast.",1488585600,,245,4.6976744186046515

8722742,5,B010N4GRGI,This movie was edited. Theirs a scene where Wallace Beery horse is injured and has to be put down. Wallace is given a piece of chalk from the Veterinarian. Wallace explains to himself that he has to make line from one ear to the opposite eye. That makes an X. You shoot in the middle of the X which kills the Animal Humanely. I never forgot that. Decades later I became a Police Office in a Rural Area. More than once I was asked to put down somebody's pet horse they couldn't do them selves. Thank God I had watched that movie and remembered that scene. I'd like to meet the jerk who edited out that scene in the movie.,1472947200,3,620,4.175
