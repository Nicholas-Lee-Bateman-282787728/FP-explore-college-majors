8576870,5,B00C2XGZ4I,"Everything Heidi Songs does is awesome! There are catchy jingles and motions for dozens of sight words on this DVD. I love that the songs emphasize spelling the words, not just identifying them. I highly recommend this product, as well as her Sounds Fun DVD, which focus on phonics/digraphs like ch, sh, aw, in addition to her Letter sounds DVD, which has songs and movement for each letter of the alphabet.",1481328000,,407,4.746478873239437

8576873,5,B00C2XGZ4I,I teach kindergarten and both my scholars and I love this DVD. It keeps their attention and really helps them learn how to spell their high frequency words. When I introduce a new word I can put it on repeat for just that word.,1386979200,3,227,4.181818181818182
