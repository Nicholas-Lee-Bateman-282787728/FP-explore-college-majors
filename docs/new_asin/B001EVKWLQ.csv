3557451,5,B001EVKWLQ,"Glenn Beck tells his story of going from a raging alcoholic to a church going Mormon, and of God's reality and mercy. When I first saw this DVD, I thought, great, just another being led to Jesus story--a whiny self promoting pulpit pounding affair.

I was wrong. Yes, Beck feels strongly about his faith, and, at first, I thought he perhaps was being too hard on Mormons as a people; however, he came through on all fronts. It's an often turbulent story of rejecting alcohol and finding self respect. My own grandfather had a similar experience, but it was at the end of his life, after he'd lost his wife and family to booze. After the beatings of my father, which he would do in a rage. He, too, finally found the help he needed and died clean and sober, at peace with God.

Beck's description of his denial, his finding reasons to drink, his constant inability to turn his back on alcohol and coke, his swearing, his profane and brutal treatment of people. ""I once fired a person,"" he says, choking with emotion, ""...for bringing me the wrong pen. I...don't even know his name."" Finally, the black outs--periods of time in which his body functioned and his brain was asleep--became such of an issue with him family and his work, that he decided enough was enough. With his wife, Tanya, they decided to go on a church shopping tour, and this recounts that experience.

Whether you're a Mormon or a member of another faith, this account is well worth a place in your library. And if you know anyone in the clutches of alcoholism, this DVD could make a profound difference in their lives.",1223683200,112,1588,4.564912280701755
3557452,4,B001EVKWLQ,"This is Glenn Beck explaining about how he first came to the Mormon Church and talking about how his life was when he was younger.  Some people might find this a little boring, but I liked it and I would watch it again.",1378771200,,219,4.093023255813954
3557453,4,B001EVKWLQ,"Knowing how people come to know the truth is fascinating. Glenn made a complete transformation of his life by finally humbling himself enough to listen to the Spirit. As with so many, God had put him in a place many times to give him the opportunity to learn what he was missing, but again, as with so many, pride or stubbornness kept him from accepting the simple truths of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for way too many years. His life is now a testament to the change God can work in a man.",1369958400,,490,4.223404255319149
3557454,5,B001EVKWLQ,"Glenn Becks constant search for truth brought him to the Mormon church, and being a Mormon myself I have to say he is one smart guy!  Incredibly funny he just tells it the way it is...from his own quirky point of view of course. Gotta love this guy.
I don't care how many people want to knock his politics, because as far as truth goes (and what he has predicted would happen in this country over the past several years) we have never found him to be wrong about everything that counts....sadly. If you want to know why Glenn Beck joined the Mormon church this is a must see video! (you won't be bored!)",1366070400,,603,4.2894736842105265
3557455,1,B001EVKWLQ,"This DVD is a piece of crap. Beck throws around a lot of terms to make it look like he's done some research but he doesn't know what he's talking about. One example is that he mentions the Dead Sea Scrolls, a find of texts from a Jewish sect, not Christians. It's clear in the DVD though that he's talking about the Nag Hammadi Library. Confusing the two is the type of mistake an undergraduate in a beginners course would make. He's clearly out of his depth here. He should do more research before he starts pontificating.",1361491200,3,523,4.402061855670103
3557456,5,B001EVKWLQ,This is a great story for anyone that likes Glenn Beck. It's not long and I've let a few of our friends watch it that are Glenn Beck fans.,1359072000,,138,3.793103448275862
3557457,4,B001EVKWLQ,"I am a Beck fan.  I wanted to learn more about him, what made him so passionate about teaching us of our American history.  I purchased this item to educate myself.  We used it then lent it to a friend, who kept it!  I guess I will have to buy another.",1349308800,,252,3.8823529411764706
3557458,5,B001EVKWLQ,"This is truly an inspiring book/DVD I was truly touched by his change in wanting to quit drinking and his love for our Lord Jesus Christ... What a great conversion story. This can help many that struggle with alcoholism the importance of having Christ in your life to help you. You cannot doing it alone,",1335484800,,304,4.545454545454546
3557459,5,B001EVKWLQ,"A very well expressed conversion story right from Glen Beck himself. Glen uses not only very moving and spiritual stories but also adds his own sense of humor to make a very entertaining experience for everyone, including teenagers.",1326240000,,232,5.131578947368421
3557460,5,B001EVKWLQ,"I loved this very thoughtful commentary by Glen Beck. If you like Glen at all, you will love this CD. It pokes fun at many of the cute quirks of the LDS religion, and makes a non-mormon want to know more. Loved it!",1323129600,,214,4.0
3557461,5,B001EVKWLQ,"As a fan of Glenn Beck, and one who watches his TV program daily, I was interested in Glenn's conversion to Mormonism.  I enjoyed learning this about Glenn from the DVD as his words and feelings come through in a very sincere, forthright, earnest, truthful -- and yet, humorous -- manner.  I've watched it twice already, and will certainly watch it again.  I am firmly convinced of his Christian conversion.  As he stated, ""Only God through Jesus Christ could have changed my life the way it happened and put me on this present path.""

A must-see for all Glenn Beck fans.",1308441600,,571,4.6138613861386135
3557462,5,B001EVKWLQ,"I have never written a review here but I feel it is important to let people know how wonderful this dvd was for us! I was never a Glenn Beck fan until I watched this dvd & now I cannot wait to buy his other recent books & dvd's.
What an unbelievable change I see in Glenn Beck! This is most definitely the work of God alone. But, this dvd will appeal to anyone!
He is such a magnificent person at heart. I literally cried while watching this dvd as it was trul honest & heartwarming.
Anyone needing to be uplifted or see truth should watch this.
It was of great encouragement to me.
I am now enjoying watching him on Fox News. I am not a Fox new person but I wait on 5 PM here daily now just to see what Glenn has to say.
Now, I hear his show is coming to an end?
How sad...
Anyway, this is great for christians, catholics, mormons, any faith out there...or anyone who loves OR hates Glenn Beck.
All I can say is thankyou Glenn Beck! I am on my way to purchase your books now.",1307923200,,976,3.9846938775510203
3557463,5,B001EVKWLQ,Beck is the only one of our current crop of talk radio/tv hosts that tells it like it is.  We better start listening to him or this great country of ours is going to cease to exist.  The Founding Fathers are begging you to pay attention to this man.,1292198400,3,249,4.061224489795919
3557464,3,B001EVKWLQ,"""'There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death' (Proverbs 14:12).

The name ""Glenn Beck"" is now a household name among Americans, especially American conservatives. He is an extremely charismatic individual who is talented as an entertainer, political commentator, and spokesman for conservative values. He is most well known as the host of The Glenn Beck Program, a nationally syndicated talk-radio show, and the host of The Glenn Beck Show on Fox News. Not surprisingly, Beck has had six New York Times bestselling books, with five debuting at #1. If you have seen Glenn Beck on TV, whether you agree with his political views or not, you cannot deny that he is one of the most talented personalities on TV today. His ability to engage the viewer is a rare gift. He made Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People list of 2009. This being said, the conversion story of Glenn Beck is unique in its own right. Although the video is simply a monologue, Glenn engages the viewer in a truly entertaining style in a theatrical backdrop that invites you to feel comfortable with the potentially uncomfortable topic of Mormonism.""

3557465,5,B001EVKWLQ,"I believe he rveals his whole Lovable Self in this video. It was fun and informative and entertaining. He came across as a very sincere man, and his story of his conversion brought all kinds of emotions to me. Not only his pledge of giving up his alcohol which was very uplifting, but the emotions he showed about his baptism. We were very moved on all accounts, truly an inspiring story.

3557466,5,B001EVKWLQ,"Whether or not you are a Mormon, if you are a person of faith, this video is for you. You will be moved by his sincerity and deep belief in the transformation that comes with atonement and forgiveness. You will receive insight, not only into the heart and soul of the man who is Glenn Beck, but you will also receive an insight into your own life.",1276646400,4,347,4.1940298507462686
3557467,5,B001EVKWLQ,entertainly delighted.  I feel like I know the guy.  Good for Glenn Beck.,1275436800,4,73,4.538461538461538
3557468,1,B001EVKWLQ,"The Beck story is very similar to others told by Americans. Drug and Alcohol addiction exchanged for an addiction to a ""higher"" power. Unfortunately for the rest of society, they can't hide the cocaine and express admiration for free markets instead of freebasing. He still has the look and act of an addict, which will lead many readers and viewers to wonder what he is really about. Depressing for those who suffer to overcome these problems without the economic means to cover them up to encounter gainful employment. Beck can truly be believed as a libertarian in favor of the legalization of narcotics.",1270252800,5,607,4.902912621359223
3557469,5,B001EVKWLQ,"As a regular watcher of the Glenn Beck show, I wanted to know more about him. In this stand up, one-man show, Glenn  tells the story of  how he, as a bright young boy, turned his ""gift"" for the ""gab"" into a hugely successful career.  How he then embarked on a self destructive lifestyle of excess which nearly ended his life and how a conscious decision he made, led him to a path of redemption, the results of which are available for all the world to see.  Loved it.  Unlikely Mormon is worthy of multiple viewings.",1267574400,5,516,4.333333333333333
3557470,5,B001EVKWLQ,I love to read about real people who have the courage to tell their stories. This book was uplifting and humorous. The LDS (mormons)faith is an odd religion that asks for a lot from its members. They seem to be service oriented and don't get paid for anytime they put into their jobs or positions. That 10% tithing for one thing during these economical hard times is hard to do. A three hour meeting block every Sunday not to mention other church committments. You gotta be sincere just like Glenn Beck.,1266451200,6,503,4.538461538461538
3557471,5,B001EVKWLQ,"Oh, for God's sake, go take a leap Marvin. No one wants to hear your self-righteous, sanctimonious blather. This is a story of a mans TRUE spiritual awakening, the kind that transforms a person from inside his heart and soul. God lives in all of us and not in dogmatic scripture. Only living lifes lessons and honestly seeking answers to lifes mysteries can bring us to any kind of real salvation and God realization. Anyone who has ever found God has a story like this to tell. The stories are different but the ending is always the same. This is, after all, what life is all about. Thanks Glenn, and God bless you for sharing your journey.",1256601600,8,641,4.487179487179487
3557472,2,B001EVKWLQ,This movie leads people down the wrong path when they talk about God. Which God is he really following. I believe this movie leads people to the gates of Hell. It contradicts the Holy Bible in many ways. If You are a follower of Jesus Christ This isn't the movie for you. This doesn't show the love of the one and only true God. If You Don't believe then check the word of God when you really want to see how things stack up. Also look in Revelation 22:19-22,1256515200,28,458,4.157303370786517
3557473,5,B001EVKWLQ,"Mr. Beck's story is powerful, moving and believable! As he states, the ONLY power on this earth that can transform one's life 180 degrees, as his was, is the power of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ! Glenn's story will have you crying with laughter and heartfelt emotion! Listen to his journey to the light-you will NOT be disappointed! A true inspiration in today's world!",1254441600,7,375,4.7846153846153845
3557474,5,B001EVKWLQ,"This DVD provides the explanation for the 'fusion' of Glenn Beck 'the man', Glenn Beck 'the entertainer', Glenn Beck 'the patriot', and Glenn Beck 'the one who fearlessly places his neck on the chopping block'. Faith in God on this level explains it all.",1252713600,11,254,4.795454545454546
3557475,5,B001EVKWLQ,"Good times or bad times, Glenn Beck tells it like it was. It takes a humble spirit to acknowledge one's own faults and a real man to tearfully acknowledge God's influence in helping him shape his life for the good. Glenn is a self proclaimed comedian but this video is the real him.",1246924800,8,282,4.339622641509434
3557476,5,B001EVKWLQ,I attended a speech that he gave a couple of years ago sharing his life story including the life altering events that let up to his joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and using the gospel of Jesus Christ as his moral compass and how due to some very real events that his life gained an inner-depth and joy previously missing despite his worldly success. Mr. Beck did not spare any details about how challenging his life and events surrounding it were certainly not easy or his choice to join the church and turn his life around a random accident.  I had to admire the brutal honesty and integrity of a man willing to follow his search for truth no matter when it may take him.  It was very engaging and impossible not to watch through to completion.  To me this is a man anyone would be proud to call friend and at the very least completely engaged by his true story in his own words as only Glenn Beck could tell it.  God bless you Glenn!,1231632000,18,960,4.316666666666666

3557478,5,B001EVKWLQ,"We watched Glenn's ""Unlikely Mormon"" together as a family.  It was a hit with everyone.  Our kids especially loved it.  This is a very honest portrayal of Glenn's life and we are glad we found it!",1226361600,21,196,4.388888888888889
3557479,5,B001EVKWLQ,"Unbelievably powerful.  I hate to admit that I was in tears more than once as I listened to this very honest, straight from the heart account of the changing of a man's life.  It does not matter what religion you believe in.  This is more a story about the changing of a man, his growth, his terrors, and his redemption than it is about his joining the Mormon faith.  I recommend it to ALL.",1225756800,48,390,4.22972972972973
3557480,5,B001EVKWLQ,This is not what I thought it would be but this man's sincerity strongly shows through!  Well worth it!,1225584000,10,103,4.421052631578948
3557481,5,B001EVKWLQ,"Glen is a genuine person who doesn't shy away from his past (unlike many people running from their choices). He candidly tells things as they are.

Yes he is a mormon, but his life clearly changed, only when he was at the very bottom, and called to the Lord for help, that redemption came, he was baptized, and truly became an entirely different person,.
