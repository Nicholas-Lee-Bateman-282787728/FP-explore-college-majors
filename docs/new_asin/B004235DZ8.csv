8413232,4,B004235DZ8,"Having bought almost all British mystery and police drama series over the past 10 years or so, I recommend this series to those who, like myself, find them just as entertaining, or more so in some cases, as their USA counterparts. With no commercial interruptions, the plot flows smoothly and allows one to stay engrossed until the end. While Martin Shaw took over the lead after Season Two, I prefer Tim Pigott-Smith as being the more true-to-life portrayal.",1392595200,,459,4.897435897435898
