5495289,5,B00ARX2WHY,in 1987 I was 16 and my brother 14 and we ordered this on pay per view without getting our folks permission. man we loved the show unfortunately  we didn't love when our mom got the cable bill the next month..ha ha.. I am so glad this is on dvd I just got mine the other day in the mail and I am ordering one for my brother. this show was our first real exposure to the dead we grew up listening to our folks albums but they didn't own any dead . we got to see them once in philly at the spectrum for their 25th anniversary tour before jerry died.anyway I am so glad I bought it brings back great memories of that night. been a fan of the dead since this concert on tv all those years ago..,1414972800,,690,3.893617021276596

5495291,5,B00ARX2WHY,"This DVD reminds me of the good old times when Jerry Garcia was alive! What I wouldn't give for one more Bertha or Cold Rain and Snow with Jerry and the Grateful Dead. Anyway great cinematography,nice abstract designs during jams and drums,and great sound for a non-blu-ray. Glad I finally purchased it,every deadhead should own this DVD,thanks again,Bruce Weber! PS I wish they shot more of this incarnation of the band ,it is too bad Jerry Garcia and Brent Mydland are no longer alive,this DVD really shows you Brent and Jerry communicating and jamming!!!!!!!!",1395878400,,562,4.98936170212766

5495295,5,B00ARX2WHY,"AMAZON.COM Editorial as got it wrong, this is the Okland Concert, the top editorial refers to CLOSING OF WINTERLAND.

One of the saddest times for Deadheads since the death of Jerry Garcia is New Year's Eve. The Dead's legendary performances in the Bay Area ushered in a couple of decades worth of new years, and even if you couldn't make it, it was comforting to know the band was carrying on the tradition. Well, that tradition is gone, but there's a video experience that comes pretty darn close--The Grateful Dead: Ticket to New Year's, taped on New Year's Eve 1987 at the Oakland Coliseum. It's a creatively photographed and extraordinarily performed concert film that ranks among the best Dead performances on video, packed with delightful surprises. Some of the best: a robust ""Terrapin Station,"" a rare rendition of the stoner fave ""Dark Star,"" and an unflinchingly bluesy ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door."" The effect of the whole performance is that of a bittersweet valentine to a way of life that may be gone but is still beloved. --Anne Hurley",1370217600,14,1050,4.898876404494382
