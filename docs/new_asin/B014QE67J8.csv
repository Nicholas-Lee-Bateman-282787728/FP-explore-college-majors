7420573,5,B014QE67J8,Absolutely fantastic!!!! it's actually better than any of the extras in the Blu-ray box set. what's up with that?  Highly recommended!!!!!,1446249600,,138,5.571428571428571
7420574,2,B014QE67J8,"This isn't bad. It mostly feels like DVD extras packaged into a film, with copious amounts of focus on the fan following, almost to an excessive degree. Frankly I think I would have preferred more behind the scenes with the actors and filmmakers.",1445990400,9,246,4.744186046511628
7420575,4,B014QE67J8,Loved this one as I'm a huge BTTF fan! Great coverage on the Hoverboards as I was one of thousands of kids who wrote Mattel asking for a HoveRBoard. I still have my reply letters they wrote me in the original mattel envelopes!! Love seeing all the fans talk about their passion for this film series. Love seeing all the stars now talking about how much fun they had on this series. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is they should have edited out that guy who said back to the future 2 &3 sucked every time he opened his mouth it was like he was just disgusted with life in general and was just Very smug and ruined the rest of the documentry for me. I realize everyone is entitled to their own opinion but if your gonna make a doc. For the fans leave the negativity out of it. Aside from that guy who will remain nameless..it was awesome!!! I highly recommend it!!,1445558400,4,876,4.220238095238095
7420576,2,B014QE67J8,"This doc focused far too much on fandom, rather than the making of the trilogy. I don't care about nerds.",1456099200,,105,4.3

7420580,5,B014QE67J8,"It was Very Enjoyable to watch, in my opinion. I would hope that if you are a fan of these movies, then you would enjoy watching this ""Back in Time"" movie, too. It shows: some of the cast members talking, the fans, the DeLorean owners, hover boards, the back story of the back to the Future movies, and how this all came to be. Everyone has their own tastes in movies though, so if you start to watch it, and it just doesnt speak to you, then you might want to watch something else.",1452816000,,482,4.138297872340425

7420582,3,B014QE67J8,"Very little conversation with the actual filmmakers and cast. I honestly don't care to here from fans or inventors of a makeshift hoverboard. Or the creator of The Goldbergs. Glad I didn't spend more money on the Blurays just for this piece.  Not bashing since I'm a huge fan, I figured everything about the franchise had already been said.  Cool to see Mayor Goldy Wilson now but there wasn't much for him to say really. I'll take away from this doc that Bob Gale promised the Erik Stotlz footage is still around and one day will be shown, he has no idea when though.",1450742400,,568,4.451923076923077
7420583,1,B014QE67J8,"Well I just saw the ""Back in Time"" documentary on DVD and I am very insulted. The filmmakers decided to interview the people responsible for the restoration of the Part 1 car and Marty's truck, but decided to not include me. Even the new owner (Bill Shea) of the car didn't mention my restoration of the car, that took me 6 years to restore, I am very passionate about. The filmmakers were aware I restored the car, but had told me the film wasn't about the restorations. Well the film talked about the restorations after all, just not the one I did, the actual Delorean time machine from Back to the Future 3. I am very Insulted!",1450310400,11,630,4.3931623931623935

7420585,2,B014QE67J8,Mostly about fan culture.  Thought it was going to be more about the actual making of the movie - trailers boasted of interviews with the directors/actors and that's why I bought it but that part of it was minimal,1447718400,14,213,4.461538461538462

8731607,3,B014QE67J8,"Back In Time is a documentary about the real impact the Back to the Future movies have had on our culture. The film is many things: a history of the production of the films, a look at the loyal fan base and their nostalgic conventions, and a commentary on the influence of the movies through the years.

Back to the Future director Robert Zemekis, co-writer Bob Gale, producer Steven Spielberg, and stars Michael J, Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson offer their reminiscences on the making of the movie and the aftermath, when it turned out to be a smash hit. An interesting highlight is footage of the original Marty McFly, Eric Stoltz. There is also film of an annual car show dedicated to DeLoreans and interviews with several people who have spent thousands of dollars to make their DeLoreans look like Doc Browns in the movie.

The documentary isn't well organized. The segments jump around and never settle into a straightforward narrative. For die-hard fans, this might be OK, but for the average viewer, this scattered approach can be frustrating.

Very few films have attracted a massive, ongoing fan following. Two prime examples would be the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Back to the Future joins them. It got everything right  perfect cast, dynamite soundtrack, sharp, clever comedy, and one of the most unforgettable movie props ever devised.

There are no bonus features on the unrated DVD release.",1473897600,2,1424,4.916666666666667

8731612,3,B014QE67J8,"If you haven't seen the extras on all three of Back to the Future movie DVDs, or haven't read one of Michael J Fox's autobiographies then you may well get more out of Back in Time than me.  Back in Time is basically the equivalent of an hour and a half long DVD extra, plus a few shorter ones (that are the extras on this DVD).  It's a documentary on the film's popularity and how it has stood the test of time and is also still sought after and appreciated by people who weren't even born 30 years ago.  It does give some film ""goss"" on the trilogy, such as Eric Stoltz originally was Marty for the first six weeks of filming but just didn't come across like they'd hoped, originally the time machine was a fridge and they actually used some of that script for the Indiana Jones Crystal Skull nuclear blast scene.  But as I said this is unlikely to be news to most people and they actually provide less details than you probably already know, such as there is no mention of how Cher treated Fox when he ran into her or anything like this.  In fact this whole there really isn't any negative stuff about anyone, even when they mention the original movie's A car delorean was found rotting in a back lot of Universal Studios under no security and people were stealing bits of it, no one was mentioned as to blame.  They just told us here's the guys who restored it.

All the major role actors in the film are interviewed in this, albeit it they have less screen time than minor role actors and fans.  I don't recall seeing Thomas F. Wilson (Biff) in this, but then again maybe his appearance was so brief I missed it.  In the extras we see how this documentary was filmed, with two guys (maybe they had more crew) flying all over America and interviewing everyone.  It's pretty obvious the fans and delorean car club type people had a lot more time for them, opened up to them and gave them more footage to use than the main actors, directors etc.  Which is understandable.  Also Michael J Fox didn't look to be in great health at the time of the interview so perhaps couldn't give a lot of time when the film crew was there.

The original George McFly  (Crispin Glover) isn't in this and that's a shame as he would have had the most interesting stuff to say since he took legal action over being used in the sequel without his permission (which isn't mentioned in this documentary).  But as I said the tone of the documentary is gushing fan or we made the greatest film ever from the interviewees.  Eric Stoltz also would have made for a good interview.  Perhaps these two were asked, but we'll never know.

Back in Time is certainly watchable and it's nice to see what some of the actors look like today who haven't had any on screen work for a while. But it isn't something I'm likely to watch a second time.",1458950400,2,2810,4.340344168260038
