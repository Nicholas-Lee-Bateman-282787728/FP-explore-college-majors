3755647,4,B001PPLJOU,"Without a doubt, the decade of the 90s has seen more changes to the professional wrestling business than any decade before it & possibly any decade since then which will make the 1990's probably the most memorable decade at this point to any wrestling fan. Now this is one of those WWE documentries just like their ""Greatest 80's Stars"", ""World's Greatest Managers"", and ""Powerful Wrestling Families"" where certain wrestlers are selected and their important moments of the 1990's are profiled. Tazz host this DVD and along with hearing new comments from people like C.M. Punk (listen to what he had to say about Lex Luger & Sting), Gerald Brisco, Jim Ross, Mr. Kennedy, Jeff Hardy, Jerry Lawler, Gene Okerland, Joey Styles, John Cena and Beth Phoenix (check out her comments regarding Kevin Nash)...this DVD also reuses footage & commentary from other DVD sets and past interview archives like the old WWE Confidental show.

Here are some highlights from the profiles on this DVD:

Lex Luger - Being WCW champion, art imitating life with his Narcississt gimmick, buildup to SummerSlam '93 by slamming Yokozuna & the Lex Express (complete with the ""I Need A Hero"" song,"" his jump to WCW & the impact he had there, did he live up to his potential?

Along with this are certain highlight features showcasing how WWE became a big part of pop culture, some of the top women of the decade (Sable, Alundra Blazye, Sunny, Chyna, Marlena, Debra), and just some of the characters from the decade like Baston Booger & Glacier & Repo Man that make you go ""WHAT THE HELL WHERE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY CAME UP WITH THAT!""

DVD extras include one of the original Razor Ramon vignettes, all the vignettes with Undertaker building the casket for Yokozuna leading up to their Royal Rumble '94 match, a Bret Hart ""New WWF Generation"" commercial, Owen Hart being interviewed inside the cage leading up to SummerSlam '94, Shawn Michaels' comments at the WrestleMania XI press conference, one of the original Hunter Hearst-Hemsley promos, one of the first Mankind promos that he did in a basement, a ""The Following Announcement Has Been Payed For By The New World Order"" promo featuring Hall & Nash, the reunion of Bret & Owen & Bulldog on RAW, DX reinacts the Montreal incident, the Rock giving a funeral for Steve Austin that featured a monster truck & a Lincoln Continental & a hearse, and Steve Austin talking about the comical debut of the ""Shockmaster"" in WCW. Hidden DVD extras include one of Sunny's ""Viewer Discression Is Advised"" advertisments before RAW and Road Warrior Animal telling a story about Steve Austin giving the stunner to 12 kids.

Matches Include:
Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair - This is a rare match here as this was their first encounter against each other in Madison Square Garden.  Hogan took control of the match early with the action going both in & outside of the ring.  Just as expected with Flair being ""the dirtiest player in the game"" in that he got the advantage once Hogan took his eyes off him and worked over Hulk's knee.  The ending (classic heel Flair) setup future encounters between two but this was more of a teaser match for their more famous future encounters.
""MSG"" Nov. '91

WWE Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - This one of those matches that have been classified as a ""lost classic"" because it's a high quality match that have gone down as one of the best in both men's careers but always gets overshadowed by other encounters that are more famous (or infamous) for one reason or another.  This was the first singles match between both men on PPV, Shawn Michaels' first PPV main event, and for those Survivor Series historians...this was first of 3 times Bret & Shawn would face each other at this event & this match was exactly 5 years (give or take a few days) before the ""screwjob"".  Shawn Michaels walked into this match as the Intercontinental Champion after defeating British Bulldog for the belt around a week earlier so the added story to this match was that Shawn had the advantage since he recently beat the man who Bret Hart at the previous PPV.  This is a match that I can't describe as words wouldn't do it justice as they went around 30 mins. here in a classic performance that showcased the new era that WWE was going in where it was built on athleticism & wrestling.  Again, a lost classic that made both men walk out with more credibility than they walked in with.
Survivor Series '92

WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Yokozuna - After that ending to WrestleMania IX, this was the rematch. If this wasn't Hogan's last WWF match for almost a decade, it wouldn't have been very memorable as the match never seemed to move out of first gear & was the sterotypical Hogan performance of being dominated before ""Hulking Up"" & making his comeback in the end but I'll give Hogan credit in the fact that he heavily sold for Yokozuna just based on his facial expressions throughout the match & the fact that he didn't slam Yokozuna. The ending was crap but in the end, Yokozuna regained the WWF Title & Hulk Hogan left the WWF to not be seen again until 2002.
King Of The Ring '93

Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart - They started off by trying to one-up each other in the beginning with Owen having some very entertaining taunts towards Bret before both men ended up exchanging slaps to each other.  This went into a very technical match as Owen worked over Bret's back after ramming it into the steel post, doing a variation of the camel clutch, and even doing the imfamous piledriver that he did to Steve Austin years later.  The target would eventually turn towards Bret's knee with Owen using the figure four & hurting it even more with the ringpost.  Bret gained momentum back & we even had a battle of the sharpshooters before Owen was able to get one step ahead of Bret (literraly) and have what was without a doubt the breakthough performance of his career with Lawler quoting the moment perfectly, ""He didn't step out...he jumped out of the shadow.""
WrestleMania X
(""Bret Hart: The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be"")

WWE Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Diesel - This match happened a little while after the classic ladder match between Shawn Michaels & Razor Ramon at WrestleMania as it was time for Shawn's bodyguard, Diesel, to attempt to gain the Intercontinental Championship.  Razor came out very aggressive while Diesel used his power & size to his advantage.  There were times where Razor was able to counteract Diesel's size like a top rope bulldog but in the end, numbers amongst other things caught up to Razor as Diesel would go on to win his first championship.  This was more of a teaser for their upcoming SummerSlam match than anything else but a very good match for the ""Superstars"" show at that time.
""Superstars"" Apr. '94

WCW International Championship Match: Sting vs. Vader - Before I get started, for those who don't remember the story behind this championship...this was the ""big gold belt"" (currently referred to as the World Heavyweight Championship in WWE) that was originally the NWA Championship but when the NWA pulled out of WCW for the last time, WCW owned the belt and just renamed it but kept the status of it being a World Championship.
Now it was during this time that Sting & Rick Rude were feuding against each other for the championship with Vader waiting to face the champion at this show.  Rude regained the championship in Japan but suffered a career ending neck injury causing him to forfit the title leading to this match to declare the new champion.  Vader just boxed & beat Sting down in the opening moments before Sting recovered & hit one hell of an impressive vertical suplex on Vader.  Vader used a different strategy on Sting than normal as he punished Sting throughout the match and did moves that weren't usual for him such as a leg submission hold & a chokeslam on Sting.  Sting & Vader always had good matches against each other with each match playing out different than the previous one and this was no exception
WCW Slamboree '94

WWE Champion Diesel vs. Bret Hart - The story setup behind this match is very similar to the previous Shawn/Bret match on this set in that Bret was again going against the man (Diesel) who defeated & won the championship from the guy (Backlund) Bret lost it to at the previous PPV.  This match showed a more aggressive & intense Bret Hart than we had seen from him previously as he focued less on technical ability and more on just bringing the fight straight to Diesel.  Bret worked on ""chopping the tree down"" by working on Diesel's legs to take away the height advantage while Diesel stuck to his power/strength offense.  With this match being a rare ""good guy vs. good guy"" match, this match kept having constant interference from the heels who had their personal issues with one of the participants at that time such as Shawn Michaels & Owen Hart & Bob Backlund.  Overall, this match was a great encounter as Bret always knew how to bring out more from Diesel than other's did & this match topped their previous match at the King Of The Ring months earlier but this was more of an additional teaser to lead up to their more memorable Survivor Series match later in the year.
Royal Rumble '95

WWE Womens Champion Bull Nakano vs. Alundra Blayze - On paper, this match looks out of place on this set but this match is a lost gem in itself as this is probably ones of the greatest womens wrestling matches in America during this decade.  Bull Nakano was heavily using her size advantage in the beginning by overpowering Blaze and applying various submission holds...some you don't even see the men attempt to do while Blayze counteracted with her speed.  This was a very competitive match that would probably be remembered more if it happened on a PPV than RAW but as I said before, this is probably the best womens wrestling match of this decade & a ""lost classic"" under those circumstances.
""RAW"" Apr. '95

WWE Champion Diesel & WWE Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Yokozuna & British Bulldog - This was a very unique match as for the first time in WWE history that all the championships were on the line in one match with the rules being that if either Shawn or Diesel gets pinned/submits then they will lose their championship but if the same happens to their Bulldog or Yokozuna then they both will lose their tag team championship.  There were multiple stories going into this match was weather Shawn or Diesel could trust each other as Jim Cornette pointed out various times if both men were willing to sacrifice their championship for their friendship while on the other side, Owen Hart was not at the PPV and Bulldog replaced him after already wrestling a match earlier in the night while there was no love lost between Diesel & Bulldog after he turned on him in a tag match right before SummerSlam.  This was a good tag team match that played to everyone's strengths at various moments with a very unexpected ending.  It should be noted though however that because of the way the ending went down, the losers of the match had their championships returned to them the next day.
""In Your House"" Sept. '95

Shawn Michaels vs. Owen Hart - This was the return match from their match on RAW (on the RAW 15th Anniversary DVD set) after Survivor Series that caused Shawn Michaels to be out of action for several months with the special stipulation that if Owen Hart gains Shawn's WWE Title shot at WrestleMania if he wins the match.  Shawn made an entrance here that was more of a teaser for the entrance he would have at WrestleMania the next month.  The opening moments was typical ""Shawn being Shawn"" showing how his charisma & having fun at the expense of Owen and even doing some comedic cheating such as pulling hair behind the referee's back.  From there it went into a nice match between both men as it was good quality that you would expect from both wrestlers.
""In Your House"" Feb. '96

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Vader - This was the biggest (literally) challenge Shawn had during his first WWE Championship title reign as Vader was just a monster going through everything in his path leading up to this match.  Shawn came out aggressive by taking Vader down with kicks & punches before Vader rebounded by working over Shawn's back with his power & even doing a powerbomb on the floor at one point.  This match had various restarts due to Jim Cornette refusing to accept Vader not leaving without the championship before it came back to bite him in the end.
SummerSlam '96

Steel Cage Match: Mankind vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - This was the the third match in the series between these two and with the previous matches getting so out of control, this one was put inside the steel cage.  Hunter tried running away various times to get away with Mankind while Chyna was able to get involved in this match eventhough she was on the outside by reach through the steel bars & later on slamming the cage door into Mankind's face.  This was a great match between these two (when did they ever really have a bad one when you think about it) with some big moments like the superplex off the top of the cage & Mankind recreating the one moment that inspired him to become a professional wrestler years earlier.
SummerSlam '97

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Lex Luger - This match happened on the 100th episode of ""WCW Monday Nitro"" and after chasing Hogan for months, Luger got his title shot here.  This was a different Hollywood Hogan than usual as he didn't try to stall & avoid Luger but went straight at him & took the fight to Luger.  This match was as good as you expected it to be for television with Luger overcoming Hogan & the nWo to finally bring back the WCW Championship to WCW.
""WCW Nitro"" Aug. '97

WWE Champion Steve Austin vs. Undertaker - This was the conclusion of the months long build between Austin & Undertaker at SummerSlam that was dubbed ""The Highway To Hell"" (complete with the AC/DC song of the same name).  Both men came agressive at each other in the beginning with Austin getting knocked out early in the match due to hit accidently butting heads with Undertaker.  From there, you got all the elements you expected in this match as you had the brawling through the crowd & both men putting on a quality match in the ring with both men pulling out some suprises like Taker doing a legdrop off the top rope onto Austin on the outside announcetable while Austin tried doing move wrestling moves like the drop toehold he executed early in the match.  A high quality performance from both men here.
SummerSlam '98

WCW United States Champion Bret Hart vs. Sting - This was the dream match that fans had been waiting on for years since both men shared so many similarites to each other from their finishing moves even down to at times wear very similar ring attire like their jackets.  However, this match didn't lie up to the hype as Bret kept stalling early in the match before Sting just went Bret & brought the fight to him but the match still kept a very slow pace throughout the bout with Bret relying more on his heelish tactics like low blows, knucks, attacking the referee, and even using Sting's bat than delievering a quality performance.
WCW Halloween Havoc '98

Strap Match: The Rock vs. Triple H - A ""forgotten"" match in the feud between Triple H & The Rock as this was to determine the challenger for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam that year...and your treated to a old school Rock promo before the match.  This strap match didn't have the ""touch for corners"" rule in effect as it was Falls Count Anywhere.  As you expect from a HHH/Rock match, this was wild from start to finish as they brawled through the crowd & ringside (with Rock even taking a special photo for a fan) and used the strap to their advantage to whip & choke their opposition.  It was a good quality match that has been overshadowed by their other more memorable & better quality performances over the years.
Fully Loaded '99

Now WWE did a way better job here than they did with their 80s DVD set here in that all the names here have some qualifications to be concidered a top star of the 90's and they had a selection of matches & extras (no throwaway fillers). It was also a welcomed change that WWE actually acknowledged the acomplishments & didn't go out of their way to bury names like Luger & Blayze/Madusa like they've heavily done in the past. However if I can think of something I think WWE dropped the ball on is simply this...people can debate on who should have made the cut & didn't with names from Randy Savage to Goldberg to Curt Hennig but there is one man who's did make his mark on the 90's to the point where he's showcased in two of the bonus matches & even pictured on the inside booklet cover and that's VADER. No disrespect to Yokozuna but quite frankly, how the hell did he get chosen over Vader for this? If you listen to everything they put Yokozuna over for in this DVD, it was the same exact things Vader did as well but better...the two Yokozuna matches selected for this DVD & the two Vader matches on here clearly showcase that fact alone. For a guy who completely dominated WCW for around 4+ years & made his mark in WWE during his run to be overlooked on this list...that's one decision that really makes you think.

In the end, this is your basic ""multi-profile"" DVD set that WWE has put out in the past that really doesn't provide enough classic matches or a heavy in-depth documentry that makes this a DVD set for you to go out of your way & buy but it's something you will enjoy whenever you decide to purchase it so I recommend.",1241827200,7,20358,4.633611111111111
3755648,3,B001PPLJOU,"I would've rated this 2.5 if I could, but 3 will have to do.

This DVD set really just seemed thrown together. It doesn't feel like they put much effort into this. All they did was water down the careers of a handful of superstars and add some questionable matches.  I could argue the list of superstars they picked, but everyone's opinion is different. They could've used 2 discs to showcase 20-25 superstars instead of only showing the ones I am sick of hearing about (HHH, Austin, Rock).",1241568000,,490,4.556818181818182
3755649,3,B001PPLJOU,"The ""Greatest Stars of the 90's,"" as featured in this DVD, are as follows (not a ranked list):

Shawn Michaels, Yokozuna, The Rock, Women (Sable, Marlena, Debra, Sunny, Chyna, Alundra Blayze), Kevin Nash, Owen Hart, Ric Flair, Mick Foley, Hulk Hogan, HHH, Bret Hart, Promoters (McMahon, Bischoff, Heyman), Lex Luger, Sting, Scott Hall, Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin.

However, if you scroll up on this page and either click on ""Explore similar items"" or browse through the ""Customers who bought this item also bought"" section, you'll notice that pretty much all of these great wrestlers already have a best of/anthology-type DVD on the market. Even the promoters have the Monday Night Wars or The Rise and Fall of ECW. And for those who don't have their own DVD out, well let's just say there's a reason why they don't (except Sting).

Disc 1 of this DVD is a series of vignettes about these wrestlers' accomplishments throughout the 90's, featuring interviews with some of the wrestlers themselves, but mostly their peers within the WWE community. For the most part, these sound bytes from the wrestlers have been heard before on their DVD's. Furthermore, I don't really care too much about what young wrestlers such as CM Punk or Kennedy thought about these wrestlers when they were kids. While it was cool to see names like Lex Luger, Yokozuna, and Razor Ramon (not Scott Hall) get some props, it still feels like their inclusion on this list is a stretch, especially when some of the commentary actually buries them a la the Ultimate Warrior DVD.

Furthermore, the bonus matches which are featured on discs 2-3 aren't exactly the best of the best material that these wrestlers have to offer, because those matches are already out on other DVD's. While these performers are indeed great and they rarely had ""bad matches,"" the matches featured here are hardly the ones that defined any of their careers.

Buying this DVD versus any one of the individual wrestlers' DVD's (or to amass a library of those DVD's) is basically a debate of quality versus quantity. For me, my choice is to go for the quality.",1240963200,3,2111,4.86908077994429
3755650,5,B001PPLJOU,"This DVD covers many greats and alot of my favorites (Owen Hart, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Steve Austin). In the late 90's being a nine I remember watching Raw my first time it was a match with Owen Hart after that I was hooked.

Being lucky to catch Nitro at 5pm on Mondays then Raw at 8 do to time zone differences of TNT I didn't have to choose in the Monday Night wars and was able to enjoy alot of the wrestlers covered in this DVD.

WWE did a good job picking great matches to cover the superstars that are covered on the first disc. The bonus features of the first disc covers the superstar is prices promos. One of my favorites is the Razor Ramon promos. Always a good laugh Chico.

I recommend this DVD to my friends and anyone who grew up watching wrestling in the 90's. WWE can definitely capitalize on this by making a best of the Attitude era, or maybe a double disc additional matches.",1239926400,,897,4.233918128654971
3755651,5,B001PPLJOU,"I just got finished watching the main doc. on disc one, I was blown away how well it was put together. I recommend this dvd set to any fan of pro wrestling past or present. This set is alot better then the prev. released superstars of the 80s. 5 Stars",1239753600,,251,4.04
3755652,4,B001PPLJOU,"If you purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Greatest-Wrestling-Stars-of-the-80s/dp/B0009E32TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Greatest Wrestling Stars of the 80s</a>&nbsp;and were disappointed with the profiles and match selections on that disc, WWE redeems themselves with the sequel that focuses on the best of the '90s.

First, the main thing that surprised me about this set was how strong they put over Sting. Sting is currently the world champion of their competition, the dreadful TNA promotion, yet they gave him his due on this release. When you open the 3-disc set up your eyes are drawn to a giant image of Sting on one of the DVD art panels. WWE talent and announcers really talk positively about Sting also and do nothing to make the champion of their rival look bad, very surprising indeed.

OK, on with the rest. Disc one is a 3 hour documentary that focuses on who the WWE considers to be the biggest wrestling stars of the '90s, which is without question the greatest decade in the history of the sport. The recently departed Tazz hosts the documentary and introduces each segment that chronicles each wrestler's career from it's beginning thru 1999. All the major players are covered: The Rock, Mick Foley, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, Hulk Hogan, Sting, Ric Flair, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, Yokozuna, Triple H, Bret Hart, Lex Luger, Owen Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin.
The WWE saves Austin for last and Vince himself puts Austin over, and rightfully so, as the greatest star ever in the company. Some may think Bret, Shawn or the Rock are the greatest from '90s, and they're entitled to their opinion, but it's hard to argue with record setting PPV buys, ticket sales and merchandise sales that Austin achieved in the '90s. He's the best, and it's nice to see the company acknowledge it.

If I had to guess, I would say about 40% of the interviews in the documentary are from previous releases, but we do get some new comments from a few guys, most notably from CM Punk (see his comments concerning Lex Luger, he nailed him!). Each wrestler is covered nicely with what they accomplished in the '90s taking center stage.

WWE is famous for taking shots at people in their documentaries, but they really didn't bury anyone here. There are some subtle shots of note though. The most obvious one to me is how during Mick Foley's segment, they showed footage from his ""This is Your Life"" segment with the Rock from Raw, but failed to say how it was the highest rated segment in the history of Raw, an achievement they've always acknowledged in the past. That was interesting. Also, they take a few digs at Luger, they're fair digs though in my opinion, about how he may have been the total package, but never reached his full potential.

My only complaint with the documentary is that they included Owen Hart and left out a talent like Big Van Vader. I'm sorry, but as nice a guy as Owen was, he was not a main eventer or big draw during his career. Was he good and talented in the ring? Absolutely. Should he be called one of the greatest of the '90s, I don't think so. I would've replaced Owen with Vader. Vader dominated the '90s as a monster heel champion in WCW that helped WCW during a very dismal time in their history. His matches with Cactus Jack, Sting, Ron Simmons and Ric Flair are classics and it would've been nice to see his career highlighted here. That's my only complaint, otherwise it's a very entertaining trip down memory lane. They show a lot of clips and parts of promos during each wrestler's segment that I had forgot about, so there's some great stuff here.

Now, for the match selection. There are some great matches on this set. First, WWE has finally released Flair vs. Hogan from '91 at Madison Square Garden. This feud was going to headline WrestleMania VIII, but Vince scrapped the match after he wasn't impressed with the in-ring work, or the box office results (which I think was unfair because those matches took place during the first steroid scandal and a lot of fans were turning away at this point) from their series of bouts. I have to disagree, this match between Flair and Hogan is great! I never thought Hogan and Flair had good matches in WCW, but they have a pretty good bout here in WWF. It's well worth a look.
Vader is well represented in the match department with a forgotten classic against Sting at Slamboree '94 for the International World Title. For me, this match was worth the price of the set alone.

Other matches of note include: Diesel vs. Razor Ramon for the Intercontinental Title from WWF Superstars (you always knew there was going to be a title change when the belt was defended on Superstars!), Diesel and Shawn vs Yokozuna and Bulldog with all titles on the line from In Your House '95 (great tag match), Bret Hart vs Shawn Michaels from Survivor Series '92, Austin vs Undertaker from SummerSlam '98, Sting vs Bret Hart from Halloween Havoc '98 and Triple H vs The Rock in a strap match from Fully Loaded '98.

WWE continues to release one great compilation set after another, and this one's no exception. Well worth a look.
Future sets I would love to see them make: The history of the World Title (and please go all the way back to when it was the NWA title), history of the ECW world title, a rise and fall of WCW set, a greatest gimmick matches set and 3-disc sets for the following wrestlers - Jerry Lawler, Big Show, Terry Funk, Chris Jericho and Ricky Steamboat.",1239667200,43,5500,4.733820459290188
3755653,4,B001PPLJOU,"Ric Flair vs. Hulk Hogan
Madison Square Garden - November 30, 1991>> I don't think their was a clean winner in any of their matches until their Bash at the Beach match in WCW. But still it's nice to see a rare WWE 1 on 1 match between them on the dvd. I think that Flair vs Bret on Raw should have finally been included on this dvd instead though.

WWE Championship Match
Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels
Survivor Series - November 25, 1992>> I'm glad this one is finally on dvd. It's their better World title match at a Survivor Series. Since it ended the same way that the 1997 match should have ended! But honestly, this is their best match I think.

WWE Championship Match
Hulk Hogan vs. Yokozuna
King of the Ring - June 13, 1993>> Hogan was supposed to drop the title to Bret at SummerSlam but since he was selfish and didn't wanna put over a face that had actual talent, he chose to drop the title to Yokozuna. It was still nice to see Hogan lose this one after he won the title from Yoko in a  very short match at WM the same year.

Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart
WrestleMania X - March 20, 1994>> Owen was pretty under-rated in the ring. The only bad thing about this match is the white foam hanging from Owen's lip after the match.

Intercontinental Championship Match
Diesel vs. Razor Ramon
Superstars - April 13, 1994>> I think that a better match involving the 2 could have been included. I mean a match where they aren't versing each other.

International World Heavyweight Championship Match
Sting vs. Vader
Slamboree - May 22, 1994>> I like all the Sting vs Vader matches but I think a Rick Rude match should have been included. He was great in his WCW matches that the WWE have yet to put on dvd. Rude vs Flair shows how talented the guy was. Savage of course was screwed over on this dvd as well. His matches with Flair are also very under-rated.

WWE Championship Match
Bret Hart vs. Diesel
Royal Rumble - January 22, 1995>> There match at the Survivor Series of the same year was better. It was also their only match where there was a winner by pinfall, there others all ended with DQs.

WWE Women's Championship Match
Alundra Blayze vs. Bull Nakano
Monday Night Raw - April 3, 1995

Disc 3

Triple Header Match
Shawn Michaels & Diesel vs. Yokozuna & British Bulldog
In Your House - September 24, 1995>> The World and IC title on the line against the tag team titles. At the time the idea was fresh.

#1 Contender Match
Owen Hart vs. Shawn Michaels
In Your House - February 18, 1996>> Again, Owen was pretty under-rated in the ring and this is another match that proves it.

WWE Championship Match
Shawn Michaels vs. Vader
SummerSlam - August 18, 1996>> Sting had some good matches with Vader years before this match. Still, it is nice to see included here. But I think a Psycho Sid match should have been on the dvd instead, since you don't see many with him on dvd. He's a very under-rated big man. I also see him as one of the big stars of the 90's.

Steel Cage Match
Mankind vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley
SummerSlam - August 3, 1997>> Mick Foley put over HHH in many matches. I prefer this one where Mankind actually won.

WCW Championship Match
Lex Luger vs. Hulk Hogan
Monday Nitro - August 4, 1997>> I thought I was the only one that considered this one a classic. It's not due to them having a ton of talent. But I still like it better than any of Hogan's matches with Sting since Hogan never put over Sting cleanly. This match was fun and exciting to see at the time. It was nice to see Hogan lose the belt even if he did win it back only a few days later.

WWE Championship Match
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Undertaker
SummerSlam - August 30, 1998>> It's about time this was included on a dvd. But I still think that their first match at an In Your House where Taker was champ was a little better.

United States Championship Match
Sting vs. Bret Hart
Halloween Havoc - October 25, 1998: I think their match at Mayham is a little better. Since it's their only match where someone won clean. This was still probably the best match at that Halloween Havoc. I mean, it is the one where Hogan vs Warrior 2 stunk up the place.

Strap Match
Triple H vs. The Rock
Fully Loaded - July 25, 1999: I don't remember who won this match or if either of them did. I think that the Empty Arena Match between The Rock and Mankind should be on the dvd.

  After thoughts, come to think of it, a Goldberg match should have been included as well. His match with Sting on Nitro for the World title wasn't that bad and could have been included. Same for his match with DDP at Halloween Havoc.",1234569600,3,4589,4.307781649245064

DISC 2

1. RIC FLAIR VS HULK HOGAN-this was one of the early battles between these two as the real world champ Flair went at it with the WWF golden boy Hogan. This match took place days before Hogans rematch with the Undertaker at This Tuesday in Texas. This was a really good match that went from the outside of the ring and back in. Hogan of course used his power to take control but Flair take it back from him with his tactics. Ric of course would use a foreign object to get the win here which I loved. But the refs would reverse the decision once they found it. Good first choice for the set that shows off these two, quick but good.

2.[WWF TITLE]BRET HART VS SHAWN MICHAELS-one of my favorite matches on the set with the two greatest of all time. I remember when this was live and my brother and I were going at it. He is a huge Bret guy and my boy is HBK. This was the main event of the 92 Survivor Series and was without a doubt the best match on that card. This is the definition of back and forth as each has time in control. The action moves at a great pace. These are two of the greatest and it is a shame that they didn't face each other more often because of personal issues. My brother had this match over me forever with the finish that happened. After a classic back and forth Shawn comes of the top and gets caught by Bret, from there it is a victory for The Hitman thanks to a sharpshooter.

3.[WWF TITLE]HULK HOGAN VS YOKOZUNA-I am still upset to this day that Hogan refused to put Bret over. While Bret won the KOTR tournament that night in three classics Bret should have had the title shot here against Hogan but we all know what went down. So here we have these two rematch and I remember thinking while watching this in 93 that I hoped Yoko became a two time champ. This is a decent match with Yoko dominating for most of the match. Hogan does make his comeback but thanks to a flame from a camera he falls to Yoko. I was and am still glad Yoko won this match.

4. BRET HART VS OWEN HART-this match right here between the two brothers is an all time classic and really could be the best match from Mania 10, and I am a huge HBK fan. The storyline here going into was excellent and two of the greatest wrestlers ever go at it. Owen still to this day is very underrated as I think he would have eventually become WWF/E champion. Bret of course is an all time great and it shows here. These two deliver one of the greatest Mania matches ever which means one of the greatest matches ever period. Both men control the match at various points and the fans were so behind Bret. My brother was torn here in this match all though he leaned toward Bret since he is favorite wrestler ever. Great technical battle that becomes a brawl and back again, as the match goes on they get more aggressive. Owen of course as we all know stopped the victory roll to get the clean 1,2,and 3 for the biggest win of his career to that point, maybe ever.

5.[I-C TITLE]RAZOR RAMON VS DIESEL-this match took place on Superstars and was the night that Diesel won the Intercontinental Championship. This was a fun match with Razor taking control early only for Diesel to come back with that size. This was an excellent match especially for TV at the time and one of those rare title changes on TV. This was before the Monday Night Wars were this sort of thing happened more often. I loved HBK at ringside in this match as his interference made it more fun. Also I love the camera shot were HBK sees that Diesel won the belt and he jumps up on him.

6.[INTERNATIONAL TITLE]STING VS VADER-this was an excellent match as these two always gave us. As usual Vader used his size and power to dominate for most f the match. Sting would make comebacks using his speed and agility to his advantage. Harley Race would get involved in the match at different times and each time it backfired on him and Vader. This lead to Sting being able to beat the mammoth after a splash off of the top rope and become the new champ.

7.[WWF TITLE]DIESEL VS BRET HART-this match took place at the 1995 Royal rumble which is one of my favorite Rumbles ever since HBK won it after entering at number one, the first to do so. This is an excellent match and one that I think is a classic. These two always worked well together and this is one of their best matches. They both go at it hard from the beginning with Bret actually looking at times like a heel even though both were face at this point. Still Diesel had the match won at first when HBK came down and attacked him. Still the ref let it continue and Bret worked over Diesels leg. He continues to act like a heel using a chair at one point then going to the sharpshooter. At this point Owen comes down and lays into Bret. The match continues for some time after that until HBK and Owen return but this time with Bob Backland, Jeff Jarrett, and the Roadie. The match then ends in a draw.

8.[WOMENS TITLE]BULL NAKANO VS ALUNDRA BLAZE-great womens match right here, this makes me miss the ladies of this time. I really miss Bull as she was always one of my favorites. Great action with Blaze using her speed and going to the air to take advantage but Bull used her size and power to ground her. The action takes place not only in the ring but to the outside as well as the battled it out. In the end Blaze regains the title on a great match from Raw.

DISC 3

1.[ALL TITLES]DIESEL & SHAWN MICHAELS VS YOKOZUNA & BRITHISH BULLDOG & OWEN HART-in this match all three titles were on the line with Yoko & Owenss tag titles, HBKs I-C, and Diesels WWF title. Now the story here was Owen Hart was not able to be in the match so The British Bulldog would take his place. This still is one of my favorite matches from the early IYH days of the WWF. Shawn is my all time favorite and I love tag matches. Great back and forth action here with HBK flying all over the place, Yoko and Diesel using their size and Bulldog showing off his power. Very fun match that would see Owen make his way out towards the end of the match only to be jackknifed and pinned. This is still a very fun match and one of my favorites.

2. SHAWN MICHAELS VS OWEN HART-the IYH before Mania 12 in which Shawn put his title shot on the line against the king of hearts. This was a great match between these two which always happened when these two went at it. Two of the greats in a very entertaining match with back and forth action that moves at a great pace. Not only was the title shot on the line but also the story of Owen knocking Shawn out with the kick to his head sometime prior was also out there. Of course HBK goes on to win this in a great match although the post match celebration still seems weird to me.

3.[WWF TITLE]SHAWN MICHAELS VS VADER-this was at the time a match I was worried about because I remembered Vader killing people in WCW and thought he was a legitimate threat to Shawn's reign. This one was full of some great action since the start of the match, I love the drop kick when Vader is on the ground. HBK flies all over the place in this one going over the top, off the ropes, off the top, moonsaults [from both] and everything. Vader got the title shot by pinning Michaels a month earlier at the ""International Incident"" pay per view in a six man tag match. First though HBK looses this one by way of count out but they restart the match. The action picks up even more from here but only to have Shawn get disqualified when he attacks Jim Cornett and Vader with a racket. In the third and final round of this match Vader misses a moonsaults only to have Shawn nail one on him, this leads to the pin and HBK keeps the belt.

4.[STEEL CAGE MATCH]TRIPLE H VS MANKIND-one of my favorite matches from one of my favorite events ever, SummerSlam 1997. The feud these two had throughout their careers was one of the all time best. To be honest the feud they had during this period I think may have been my favorite between the two. Great physical match that had many great moments especially Mankinds r is that Dude Loves Superfly moment. Despite Chynas constant interference Mankind comes out the winner here in an excellent match.

5.[WCW TITLE]HULK HOGAN VS LEX LUGER-I still remember this match like it was yesterday. Watching Nitro and just wanting Hogan to lose so bad when this match was happening. At the time I wasn't so sure especially when my boy Randy Savage came down to help NWO team mate Hogan. But looking back seeing that it was the 100th episode of Nitro and such it should have been easy to see that Luger would win the title. This was actually a great match especially for TV but given the time period it really doesnt surprise me. Luger was excellent here as was Hogan as both men put forth a good showing. In the end Luger racks Hogan and takes the WCW title and brings it back home, ah the memories.

6.[WWF TITLE]STEVE AUSTIN VS THE UNDERTAKER-this match happened at the 98 SummerSlam and was a great match like these two always delivered. The match started out more so as a brawl then into a wrestling match and then back again. Of course most remember this match for the leg drop Taker delivered to Austin while on the announcers table. Great paced fight between these two with Austin retaining the title here, lucky for him Taker didn't want Kanes help.

7.[US TITLE]BRET HART VS STING-now I know people who didn't like this match as much as I did but I thought it was pretty good and made sense storyline wise. Bret was a mega heel once again after a great story involving him and Sting. Now I hate that they had Bret betray Sting to remain with Hogan because prior to that moment the storyline with these two was excellent. Anyway all that lead to this match and while not the classic that it easily could have been I still think it made sense. Hart was the heel here and played that out well while Sting battled back. Bret would go on to use Stings own bat against him and lay him out cold with it, a sharpshooter later and Bret retains the US title.

8.[STRAP MATCH]TRIPLE H VS THE ROCK-this was a strap match to see who would face the WWF champion at SummerSlam if I remember correctly. Like every match these guys had this one was great. Full of action that spills all over the place, back and forth and Rocks trademark humor throughout.  Triple H takes the win here in a match most don't remember but should.

This was a fun set that had a lot of good things going for it. The match selection was good and so was the superstar selection, but people are missing. Every other review here has stated all those that are missing but I will say Randy Savage once again got left out like the 80s set. Still over all this was a good set.",1417305600,,11290,4.257476635514019

ECW, if Eric or Vince wanna admit it or not, was a fighting company that was on the verge of greatness. Paul Heyman and his goons, fought hard to get PPVs, TV time, and attention from then WWF and WCW.

The wrestlers of ECW are and still legendary. Such icons like, Terry Funk, Sabu, The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Rob Van Dam, and Tazz himself. I am not denying that the already amazing superstars on the list do not deserve to be on there, I am only saying that 9 hours is not enough time to do the most exciting time for any wrestling fan.

3755811,5,B001PPLJOU,"No disrespect to the decades before (which has more ups than downs compared to now) & after (which arguably have more downs right now or at least in the middle compared to the decades before). But MO, the BEST decade in wrestling & the BEST time to be a wrestling fan was the 90's. So many things were done in this decade that will probably never be done again. And should it be duplicated, it wouldn't match how it was done in the 90s. Highlighted here are the wrestlers who made the 90s what it was. The 90s had things that are missing now. Among them, time for matches, less ppvs, more Title value, the different territories where wrestlers wrestled in & learned their craft while they were at it before hitting the big time, better & fresh storylines & angles, The Attitude Era, Monday Night Wars, and stiff competition between 3 different companies where wrestlers could really shoot on other companies & speak their mind, unscripted promos, and much more. This set lets old fans relived just some of the great times while watching a profile on one of their favorite wrestlers. At the same time, new fans will get a glimpse & why these stars are known for whatever they're known for & just a little bitty taste at why the 90s was THE BEST DECADE IN WRESTLING HISTORY!

Disc 1

The host for this set is Tazz & he did a great job. He was a good candidate as he was in 2 different companies (ECW & WWE) during his ring days. I won't go into detail about what was said about teach individual.

Shawn Michaels - I vividly remember Bobby Heenan saying ""This is the star of the 90s, Monsoon."" I don't know if he was THE STAR of the 90s. Maybe mid to late 90s, most definitely. I liked Shawn. He was a great heel. But a great face too. He shined during his Rocker & post-Rocker days in the early 90s. His best years to me however were his mid to late 90s days where he beat Bret Hart in the Iron Man match that many said could not be done at WM12 in 96 along with his Mind Games match with Mankind & his SSlam 96 match with Vader (who should be on this set IMO), his feud with Taker in 97 (the year that also saw the birth of the original DX) that saw the infamous birth of the HIAC (and the memorable debut of Kane who IMO should've also been on this set). His unfortunate back injury in early 98 hindered what could have been a great 1998 & 1999 for HBK as a wrestler. But the fact that he was able to make a comeback from a career ending injury is a testament to him.

From the Smallest Champion to the Largest

Yokozuna - The big man. I remember him well. His matches with Taker. Bret, Hogan, and later on, Vader all stand out for me.

Samoan Culture

The Rock - While his matches were really something, his strengths I believe showed more in his promos. All his memorable lines & catchphrases. What's not to love about Rock in the 90s?

Drawing the Casual Fan

Women of the 90s - View for yourself & have your opinion. A shocking moment was when Alundra dumped the WWF Women's Title in the trash on a LIVE edition of Nitro.

Tough and Sexy

Kevin Nash - From 93-96, known as Big Daddy Cool, Diesel. He's had memorable times as Diesel. Being a bodygaurd for HBK, his Royal Rumble 1994 run, turning face at the 1994 SSeries, beating Backlund at a record time in MSG first his first & I believe only WWF Championship, his series of matches with Bret, costing Taker the win at Royal Rumble 96 & on RAW (only because he taunted & middle fingered Taker, something never done before to my knowledge prior to this) being dragged underneath the ring by Taker, his match with Taker at WM12 (I personally enjoyed this considering it was 2 big men, which usually aren't as good as this was), and his famous No Holds Barred match with HBK (this was where the prosthetic leg was at). There are other memorable monets as Diesel. Those were just some of the ones I remember. I also remember his & Scott's debut at WCW. Back then, I found it shocking. I liked his WCW run but loved his run as Diesel more.

Battle for Superstardom

Owen Hart - Worthy of being on here. 1994 was his definitely the year of The Rocket turned King Of Harts. I hope a dvd sert with as detailed a documentary as HBK's Heartbreak & Triumpth & Bret's Best There Is, Was, Ever Will be dvd sets are. Hopefully, Bret & Shawn (among others) give comments as Shawn was one of Owen's best rivals & Bret (as well as Jim Neidhart, who along with Owen formed The New Hart Foundation in the early 90s after Bret's singles push) is family. This should be done after Jarrett retires from wrestling so he can be free to comment because he was one of Owen's best tag partners if not his best (outside of The Hart Foundation of course). Also, HHH was one of his great rivals as was SCSA & Ken Shamrock so they should have comments too.

Fun Filled Memories

Ric Flair - Sorry for this but a long rant is coming: He was in the Greatest Stars Of The 80's because he had a right to be. But by the 90s, I was getting tired of seeing the same chops, falling down after being chopped in the corner, stomping & elbow dropping his jacket, the robe, the music, the Wooo, etc all the time. Same routine for decades. With that said, I don't know how long he's lasted & why he's still in the business as an active wrestler (especially after WWE's epic sendoff). Look, I've got no problems with him joining TNA (though if I were him, I'd stay in WWE in some non wrestling capacity). But he should not be wrestling. He's long past an active wrestle's age/prime & long past his own prime. I lost all respect for him after he tarnished his legacy (and he's continuing to do so) by competing in TNA despite his HOF Induction, epic WM match with HBK & as even more epic RETIREMENT sendoff. However, no denying the man's legacy (or the legacy he had anyway). Only part of his legacy that's left is his longevity. I believe he was remembered for other things too. But enough ranting. Let's move on to the next individual.

Infamous Figure

Mick Foley - Oh. Another rant. Sorry lol. Another man who really tarnished his legacy once he become a TNA wrestler. However, while I lost a large portion of it, I haven't lost all respect for him. He is The Hardcore Legend & the things he has done to himself are things the human anatomy is not built to take nor should it have to. He wrestled in WCW, ECW & WWF. IMO, he should have retired as an active wrestler after No Way Out 2000 though.

The Quest for Success

Not So Great Stars of the 90s

The Reinvention

Hulk Hogan - The man who put wrestling on the map. Pretty much same thoughts as Mick Foley though at least he's not wrestling now. Got a feeling it's only a matter of time though. Seems like they're building towards Sting vs Hogan or Sting & Hogan vs ???? or Hogan vs someone from Immortal. If he is gonna wrestle & I don't think he should, it should be against Sting, who is a very respected in ring veteran so Hogan won't have to worry about really anything. While I still to this day have never completely hated the man, I did lose a bit of my Hulkamaniac-ness so to speak once he lost to Taker at SSeries 91 because it was then that I realized he was the The Immortal he claimed to be. Now, I know immortals can lose, but they never die. But how Hogan said it in his promos, he made it seem (at least to me) that he was unbeatable yet SSeries 91 really proved to me that he wasn't as he was clearly dominated that night. I was also uncomfortable with his (and Warrior's) feud with Slaughter in early 91. But otherwise, he was great in the WWF in the 90s. But as far as this decade goes, I think he was more known for his WCW run. He debuted at Bash At The Beach in 96 in his Hulkamania red & yellow colors only to turn heel & along with Hall & Hash form ""The New World Order of wrestling."" That was very memorable. After years of being a true strong babyface, turning heel was one of, probably the best thing WCW did with him, more so since it wasn't expected & it gave them a chance to as Hogan put it his 2002 Hulk Still Rules documentary (but I'm saying it in different words) temporarily shut down the goody too shoe Hogan before he was completely hated by all.

Attitude and Controversy

Triple H - From Blue Blood to The Game. I remember his Blue Blood persona well. It's amazing because on Photoshop, I had on the left, a picture of his Blue Blood day & on the right, his current look & man, what a transformation! It's like two different people. Yet it's the same guy except then, he was much younger & not a main eventer unlike now. His fist WWF Title came at the end of 99 just a mere few months away from the year 2000. But I'll remember him most from the time I liked him most (even more than now), his DX days. The things he did like the famous WCW take over stunt angle, getting women or a woman from the crowd every monday night to expose themselves, among other things. While they were some things the DX of the 90s did that I didn ot like, I can't deny that they were still memorable.

Technical Savvy

Bret Hart - The Excellence Of Execution. The Best There Is, The Best There Was And The Best There Ever Will Be. The Hitman. The 90s started as a great decade. But it did not end well. I'm gonna start with the bad. The infamous Montreal Incident, the tragic loss of Owen, his WCW run (except for the Owen Hart tribute match against Chris Benoit). But like I said, it started out very well. The Hart Foundation run, I.C. Title matches/reigns (matches with Roddy Piper, Perfect, Lawler, Bulldog), singles push continued as he went on to become the WWF Champion (matches with HBK, Taker, SCSA, Owen Hart, Diesel). He was loved & idolized. I love his trademark thing of giving his shades to a fan. It really was special to each fan who got them. Wish I was one of those lucky ones lol. I'd still have them today. You should watch who he gives the shades to at WM12. I think he was his son, Blade. What's funny though is he took off the kid's cap & just let it out of his hand like he didn't care about it, put the shades on him, but didn't give his hat back lol. Probably someone caught it & put it back on him as Bret's opponent was waiting for him in the ring so....

Pop Culture Phenomenon

Vince McMahon / Eric Bischoff / Paul Heyman - Ok. So they mentioned the promoters. And they should. But what about the refs, ring announcers, managers/valets, and commentators/backstage interviews? If you're gonna add non wrestling individuals, might as well include them all.

The Total Package

Lex Luger - I only remember a few things about Lex. His entrance as The Narcissist. In particular, how Bobby Heenan hyped him at WM8 & for some reason, he wasn't seen again till the 1993 Royal Rumble where he was unveiled by Bobby. I remember his entrance because he had women hold giant sized mirrors for him while he flexed his muscles for the crowd. I thought/looked at him as a modern day Rick Rude since he used to pose for the ladies too. But the real modern day Rick Rude had to be Val Venis. Anyway, the other things I remember about Luger is the Lex Express, the slam on Yokozuna aboard a ship or something & his debut at WCW. In WCW, he was known as The Total Package & had quite a career there.

The IT Factor

Sting - A man who as Mene Gene put it, ""Pretty much covered the 90s from top to bottom."" He did just that. From his blonde surfer days, his feuds with Ric Flair, Vader & Muta stand out as well as his partnership & friendship with Luger. From his Wolfpac days, he had a great match on Nitro for the WCW Title against Goldberg (till the ending) & a fantastic match at Halloween Havoc 98 with Bret Hart, which is featured on this set so watch it. But Sting is most remembered for his Crow days. In an interview with IGN.com which took place before he joined TNA, he said the Crow days were the favorite of his career & he also revealed that he had creative control over his character during that time. I'm referring to his original Crow days as the silent, mysterious figure who was in the rafters or crowd if not in the ring and who didn't speak till AFTER he was the WCW Title at Starrcade 97, a match that I'm surprised isn't on this set. It is THAT Sting along with the current on in TNA that are my most favorite incarnations of the man now known as THE Icon. Now, along with Taker, he's my all time favorite (in addition to some others) While I would love to see him at WM (and I believe it's only a matter of time), I respect this man for keeping his word of not going to WWE for years & years now because (1) Every other big name has and (2) Wrestlers aren't known for keeping their word. The subject if retirement is a prime example & Hogan, Flair, Foley are prime examples. Who knows? HBK may follow suit though so far he hasn't & I hope he doesn't as he's done more than enough as it is. I respect Sting so much for keeping his word (among other reasons) that if he did eventually go to WM, my respect for him would not be lost even at the absolute slightest.

The Bad Guy

Razor Ramon - The Bad Guy oozing machismo. Scott Hall had a great run in WWF as Razor Ramon. His promos were good. His vignettes were good (one of them is on this set as an extra). He was a multi-time I.C. Champion & I think he was Tag Team Champion too. He had a Championship match with Bret at Royal Rumble 1993 where he did very well but didn't win. IMO, he should have feuded & faced off with Taker at WM9 & have a rematch at SSlam in the R.I.P. match where he'd take time off afterwards to sell the R.I.P. thing & then return thus turning face (of course he'd have to do something other than return to initiate a face turn). I did not watch a lot of WCW but what I did see of Scott there, I liked. It's unfortunate where he is now in life & I hope and pray he overcomes his demons.

Respect

The Undertaker - Man, what can I say that I haven't said before or that hasn't been said before by anyone period? You wanna talk covering the 90s from top to bottom, Sting did it in WCW but this man, this Phenom did it in WWF. He's seen all the greats come & go. SC, Rock, HBK, Bret, Warrior, Hogan, Savage, Flair, they're all gone in some form or another. Yet, Taker remains doing what he started at SSeries 90: wrestle, entertain, you can now include elevating new guys to that. He's pretty much done everything there is. Granted, he never won KOTR or the I.C. Title. But he didn't need those accolades. He bat Hogan for his first World Title a year after his debut at the same event he debuted in at a time where Hogan was virtually unbeatable. TO me, half of the Bret/Austin Wm13 magic happened during the Taker/Hogan match. Going into it, Taker was booed. He was a heel. During the match & more noticeably after it, he was cheered but still a heel while Hogan was still a face. Taker turned face officially on an episode of SNME where he saved Randy & Elizabeth from Jake Roberts, who waited backstage with a chair in hand to strike one of them. What got me was how cheered & loved he was depite the fact that he hadn't changed a thing about him. They just got into that character. The Undertaker as a character is a myth, a legend, the longest running & most popular gimmick in the history of the wrestling industry. As a man, his legacy, presence are untouchable. A WM 19-0 (soon to be 20-0) streak, defeating names like Snuka, Roberts, Diesel, Sid, Kane twice, Boss Man, HHh twice, Flair, Batista, Edge, HBK twice. A 7x World Champion, Hardcore Champion, he's a multi-time Tag team Champion. He;s feuded with & beat every big name if his generation except for Goldberg & Sting. Call me crazy but I believe a UT/Goldberg showdown HAS TO HAPPEN & a UT/Sting showdown MOST DEFINITELY WILL HAPPEN someday. I mean, who thought we'd see Sting/Bret? We saw it. Sting/RVD? We saw it. UT/Sting? We will see it. In every interview I've read of heard of when Sting was being interviewed & the subject of WWE came up, he always said each time, he was closer especially this past January being the closest, yet he hasn't yet to sign. And when asked about how he'd like to face but never did, what's the one thing left to or questions like that, is one answer is: The Undertaker. Look, entrance, mannerisms, everything worked & still does. He is very similar to both Sting & Austin. But for different reasons. He & Sting are loyal to their respective companies where they became household names (Sting in WCW, Taker in WWE). Both are dedicated to the business, very reliable, have been in the game for over 20 years now I think & are future HOFers. And both had a streak (Sting at BFG, Taker at WM) but while Sting's ended, Taker's, which started first, still lives. Similarities between him & Austin: fired by the same company, told they'd never get anywhere in the business, but both went to WWE & did just that, and as on screen personas, Taker's biker days are similar to the SCSA of the 90s as the were rebellious badasses who lived by their own rules & spit in the face of authorities. Actually, Taker was always like that. It just started to show in 98 & really showed in 2000 - 2003. As far as respect goes, in & out of the ring/the industry, I don't know as the respect this man has. Probably SC & Sting come close but I don't know if thir level of respect matches Taker's. I certainly don't believe their level of respect tops his. You ask anyone in WWE, not in WWE, someone who worked for a promotion but no longer does, ask them about Taker & they'll have nothing but good things to say. I believe the same can be said about Sting, SC & even Kane among others. But no one has the respect of the locker room Taker does & I doubt anyone ever will. I do think that after his career officially ends which many feel will happen at or after WM28, he will continue to appear & wrestle at WM only to defend his Streak against new guys like Sheamus, Miz, Del Rio, at hopefully at WM30 at MSG, Sting. Undertaker IS the 90's of the wrestling & IS the heart, soul & conscience of WWE & WM. He is the true Mr. WM as well.

A Rebel

Stone Cold Steve Austin - Many say he revolutionized the business. He sure did it in one way. But I think others have done it too in other ways. SCSA was the man everyone tuned in to see & the man everyone wanted to be. He lived many people's dreams - beat the holy high living hell out your boss (also his former bosses, Bishoff & Heyman), flip him the bird, etc every night & get paid for it and get paid a lot of money at that!! Without question, he was THE rebel we all wanted to be. It sucks that an unfortunate accident occured at SSlam 97 that cut his career short. Had that not happened, I believe he'd still be competing....well, maybe he'd leave WWE or ask for a UT/HBK/HHH like part time schedule once WWE went PG as it eliminated like 90% of what made SCSA who he is - flipping birds, beating up your boss, and pretty much everything else he did in the 90s that made him popular. But I don't think he'd leave over the PG rating as he knows he became a star in WWE. WCW fired him which turned out to be a big mistake. So had he not been in WWE, who knows where he'd end up after ECW went down? Indies? possible but I doubt he'd be the star he was or make the money he made in WWE so a sense of loyalty would have had to be there whether he likes the PG rating or not.

Tazz - Close

Now, for the extras:

Razor Ramon - Restaurant Vignette
July 11, 1992 - Entertaining. Scott was good here.

The Undertaker Builds a Coffin for Yokozuna
December 1993 - I remember these days well. LOVE Taker's eyes rolling & how is that vintage Deadman voice, he says RRREEESSST INNN PEEEEACCCEEE

Bret Hart - New Generation Vignette
July 1994 - I think this is the one with that little kid who yells Bret;s name. Right before he goes through the curtain, Bret comes back & gives the kid a pair of his shades.

Owen Hart Inside a Steel Cage
August 20, 1994 - I'm telling you. 94 was Owen's year. This is a fantastic interview that happened inside the cage. I think the arena was empty as it was dark except for the spotlight that was on Owen. When I first saw this back then, I was like huh, where's Taker lol?

Shawn Michaels Press Conference Before WrestleMania XI
February 28, 1995 - ""I will give you a show like you've never ever seen before. Why? Because I can."" Shawn was good here.

Hunter Hearst Helmsley - ""Riff Raff""
April 15, 1995 - I believe this was one of Hunter Hearst Helmsely's pre-debut vignettes.

Mankind - ""And God Created Mankind""
January 6, 1996 - Another pre-debut vignette I think. But for Mick Foley's sadistic Mankind persona.

Scott Hall & Kevin Nash N.W.O. Vignette
August 19, 1996 - Loved the nWo vignettes.

The Hart Foundation Reunites
March 31, 1997 - This is the last incarnation of The Hart Foundation which consisted of Bret, Owen, Bulldog & eventually Jim Neidhart & Brian Pillman.

D-Generation X Reenacts the Montreal Incident
November 24, 1997 - Classic DX here. But being a Bret Hart fan, I did find this distasteful.

The Rock Reads Steve Austin's Eulogy
April 19, 1999 - I remember this. SC interrupts.

Steve Austin remembers the Shockmaster - OMG! The Shockmaster! I believe Tugboat was behind the mask. He tripped or somehow fell after coming through the curtain. Wow.

Disc 2

Ric Flair vs. Hulk Hogan
Madison Square Garden - November 30, 1991 - A rare bout & a good one.

WWE Championship Match
Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels
Survivor Series - November 25, 1992 - This was before their more famous Iron Man match at WM12. Here, both men were younger & getting their first singles pushes in WWE. Great match.

WWE Championship Match
Hulk Hogan vs. Yokozuna
King of the Ring - June 13, 1993 - Hogan's last appearance & last World Championship (in WWE) till 2002. Not a masterpiece. I read that it was supposed to be Hogan vs Bret. But Hogan didn't wanna job to him. Don't know if that's true or not. What I do know is Hogan vs Bret would've been better. No disrespect to Yokozuna.

Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart
WrestleMania X - March 20, 1994 - A GREAT match. For me, openers aren't always the greatest. They serve to get the crowd hyped for what's supposed to happen later....kinda like a preview of sorts. Not the case here. This was the match of the night.

Intercontinental Championship Match
Diesel vs. Razor Ramon
Superstars - April 13, 1994 - Another rare bout. I liked their SSlam 94 match over this though.

International World Heavyweight Championship Match
Sting vs. Vader
Slamboree - May 22, 1994 - I loved this match a lot. Recommend it.

WWE Championship Match
Bret Hart vs. Diesel
Royal Rumble - January 22, 1995 - Already on the Royal Rumble Anthology. Considering KOTR never got its anthology set (but should), their match from that event (or the Steel Cage match from IYH in 96) should've been here instead IMO as fans can get their Royal Rumble match via the Anthology set.

WWE Women's Championship Match
Alundra Blayze vs. Bull Nakano
Monday Night Raw - April 3, 1995 - I liked Alundra. I'd like to see a match between her & Trish as both were the best female workers of their respective times.

Disc 3

Triple Header Match
Shawn Michaels & Diesel vs. Yokozuna & British Bulldog
In Your House - September 24, 1995 - Never released till this set. I enjoyed it.

#1 Contender Match
Owen Hart vs. Shawn Michaels
In Your House - February 18, 1996 - Also enjoyed this. More so than the previous match. Recommend it.

WWE Championship Match
Shawn Michaels vs. Vader
SummerSlam - August 18, 1996 - If you haven't seen it, you should. Vader's best performance in WWE, arguably. One of the longest WWE Title matches I've ever seen....or at least it felt that way.

Steel Cage Match
Mankind vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley
SummerSlam - August 3, 1997 - A memorable cage match. Also recommended.

WCW Championship Match
Lex Luger vs. Hulk Hogan
Monday Nitro - August 4, 1997 - Didn't enjoy it that much. Shouldn't have been on here.

WWE Championship Match
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Undertaker
SummerSlam - August 30, 1998 - What a match! Many feel the true main event was the Rock/HHH ladder match. It was a great match, no question. But Taker/Austin was it for me. Be prepared for audio edits during Taker's entrance.

United States Championship Match
Sting vs. Bret Hart
Halloween Havoc - October 25, 1998 - One of the best WCW matches & in Sting's & Bret's respective careers. Recommended.

Strap Match
Triple H vs. The Rock
Fully Loaded - July 25, 1999 - This was good. I enjoyed it.

Individuals who should have made the cut in addition to the names above (in no particular order): Goldberg, Vader, Ted Dibiase, Macho Man, Kane, the managers/valets, refs, commentators. And what about ECW? Heyman's here, yeah. But ECW has its moments in the 90s. If this was a real true Greatest Stars Of The 90s set, they should be here. At least RVD, Sabu, Sandman & Dreamer because to me, they were the constant standouts of that company.

I know the added individuals will stretch this to 4 discs, which may be good because.....

Matches that probably should've been here (I'm listing them in no particular order but should appear in the correct order like the ones above are):
any RVD vs Sabu match
any Sandman vs Dreamer match
Sting vs Hogan - Starrcade 97, Slamboree, Nitro
Sting vs Flair from GAB 1990
The Sting/Vader series
Vader vs Cactus Jack from WCW Saturday Night on April 24
Goldberg vs Hogan from Nitro in July 8, 1998 (first time Goldberg won the WCW Title)
Goldberg vs DDP from Halloween Havoc 98
Goldberg vs Sting (Wolfpac facepaint) for the WCW Title on Nitro (1998 I think but don't know when)
Goldberg vs Nash from Starrcade 98 (Nash used the stun gun on Goldberg here)
Sting vs DDP on Nitro (1998 or 1999, maybe they had 2 matches??)
Ted Dibiase vs Virgil from Prime Time Wrestling on November 11, 1991 (they had 2 other matches at WM & SSlam. But those are on their respective Anthology sets & the PTW one was the best of the 3 IMO)
Macho Man vs Jake Roberts from SNME in 1992 (including the aftermath where Taker turned face)
Kane vs SCSA (KOTR 98), vs Undertaker (RAW, June ??? 1998: the night after Over The Edge 98 where they fought to see who'd face SC at KOTR. SC & Vince commentated with JR & King)
HHH vs Rock - 2 Out Of 3 Falls (Fully Loaded 98)
Mankind vs Rock (Rock Bottom 98 & St. Valentine's Day Massacre 99, Empty Arena match)
The Undertaker vs SCSA - A Cold Day In Hell: IYH, vs The Rock on RAW in 1998 (October, I think?)

Extras: Some Macho Man commercials (Slim Jim 1992, Hasbro Action Figures 1992), WWF Attitude commercial (there were 2 of them. Both were shown at WM14.

-Bret Hart: A nice hype package for The Hitman, where he gives a fan his glasses, much to the fans amazement.

-The Rock holds a funeral for Steve Austin, anything with Austin and Rock is great and this is no exception.

-Steve Austin remembers the debut of The Shockmaster and during the video you can clearly hear Davey Boy Smith say ""Oh my god, he fell flat on his a**"". This was easily one of the worst debuts ever and oh so funny.

Disc 2

-11/30/91, MSG: Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair: This was a rare televised house show match that saw these two icons clash. Hogan was out for revenge against the man who cost him the WWE title a few days prior. Hogan does his usual power moves to pump up the crowd, while Flair uses all kinds of tricks, shots to Hogan's legs to get him primed for the figure four leg lock. Flair makes Hogan look like a million bucks as he usually did in his matches. The action was great back and forth between these two, Flair almost gets away with a win after using brass knuckles on Hogan, but the referree spots them and awards the match to Hogan via DQ. 7/10.

-11/25/92, Survivor Series: WWE Title Match: Bret Hart (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels (I.C. Champion): These two have never had a bad match and this is no exception as both brought their A-games and Shawn had some good momentum having just won the I.C. title a couple of weeks before. Shawn really stepped up his game and had the Hitman on the ropes on several occasions, but Bret pulled out the victory after catching Michaels jumping from the top rope and trapping him in the Sharpshooter to retain his title in about 25 minutes. 9/10.

(Available on Greatest Rivalries: Bret vs. Shawn)

-6/13/93, King of the Ring: WWE Title Match: Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Yokozuna: This was the actual return title match after the brief face-off/fiasco at Wrestlemania IX and it was a good one. Yoko used his obvious size and strength advantage to wear down the veteran Hogan, while Hulk did his best to knock and keep down the mighty Yokozuna, even tried slamming him on a few occasions but failing and injuring his back. As Hogan had Yokozuna down a camera man is on the apron and a flash comes from his camera blinding Hogan, allowing Yoko to hit the leg drop for the win. 8/10. New WWE Champion Yokozuna. Nice postmath beatdown with Yoko hitting a banzai drop on Hogan, loved the shocked reactions of everyone in the crowd.

(Available on Best of the King of the Ring)

-3/20/94, Wrestlemania X: Owen Hart vs. Bret Hart: A match that had been brewing for months comes to a head a the biggest show of the year. There were many who thought Bret would beat his younger brother Owen (myself included) and these two put on a classic mathc full of counter wrestling and great submission moves. Owen did indeed step out of his brother Bret's shadow as Bret was on his shoulders, went to roll through but Owen pinned his brothers shoulders to the mat for 3, much to the shock of Bret and the crowd. 9/10.

(Available on Bret Hart: The Best There Is, The Best There Was and The Best There Ever Will Be)

-4/13/94, Superstars, Intercontinental Title Match: Diesel vs. Razor Ramon (Champion): Two years before they would form the Outsiders in WCW these two faced off just a few weeks after Razor's ladder match at Wrestlemania X. Razor came out full of fire but Diesel quickly used his power to take over, hitting a sidelam and Snake Eyes in the corner. Razor showed his strength lifting Diesel up on his shoulders while on the mat. Razor hits the exposed turnbuckle and Diesel hits the Jacknife to become the new I.C. champion. 7/10.

-5/22/94, WCW Slamboree, WCW Title Match: Sting Vs. Vader: This was for the vacant WCW title as the Stinger took on the man they call Vader. These two have had a rivalry dating back to '92 and have never had a bad match that I've seen. Vader just uses his power, hammer fisting Sting in the corner. Sting counters by hitting and impressive vertical suplex on the 450 lb. Vader. Sting kicks out of two Vader bombs and eventually makes his comeback, going nuts with punches and chops, and Vader goes down. Vader misses a moonsault, Harley Race misses a a head butt from the top rope and Sting hits a top rope splash to become the new World champion. 8/10.

-1/22/95, Royal Rumble, WWE Title Match: Diesel (Champion) vs. Bret Hart: This was easily one of the best matches of the 90's so it fits being on this set. This was a great david vs. goliath match, Diesel kept hitting power moves and using his size to his advantage, while Bret kept trying to chop down the big man. This was a 30 minute classic where constant interference by Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Bob Backlund and Owen Hart forced the referree to throw the match out and DQ both men. That doesn't take away from this match though, 9/10.

(Available on The Royal Rumble Anthology Volume II)

-4/3/95, Raw, Women's Title Match: Alundra Blaze vs. Bull Nakano (Champion): Bull used her size and strength edge to wear down Alundra, using a nice a variation of the surfboard submission and a top rope legdrop while Blaze used her speed, hitting some great dropkicks and even showing her own strength as she german suplexed Nakano for the 3 count to win the Women's title. 8/10.

Disc 3

-9/24/95, In Your House, All Titles On The Line Match: Yokozuna & The British Bulldog (Tag Team Champions) vs. Shawn Michaels (I.C. Champion) & Diesel (WWE Champion): This was a pretty decent main event match that saw Bulldog replace Owen Hart last minute, which I thought helped this match more as there was more strength on display while Michaels used his speed and ability to counteract both men. Nice to see a face off between Yokozuna and Shawn, though Yoko obviously has the strength edge, stunning how he can move like he does at his size. Owen Hart comes down to help his team but gets the Jacknife powerbomb from Diesel for the 3 counts. Winners and new tag team champions, Shawn Michaels & Diesel. 7/10.

-2/18/96, In Your House, Number 1 Contender's Match: Shawn wanted revenge on Owen for putting him out of action with a concussion for over a month. Their styles mix well, Owen targeted Shawn's neck and head and Shawn used his showmanship and athletic talent to combat the King of Hearts. Shawn wins after hitting Sweet Chin Music to go on to Wrestlemania XII. Nice post match celebration with a member of his Clique. 8/10.

-8/18/96, Summerslam, WWE Title Match: Vader vs. Shawn Michaels (Champion): This was probably Vader's best match in WWE as he almost had Shawn beat on a few occasions, Vader hits all kinds of fists, clotheslines, even a powerbomb on the outside. Shawn out quicks Vader, hitting a nice dive over the ropes to the outside. Shawn wins the match via count out, Jim Cornette demands the match be restarted and it is, Michaels uses Cornette's racket for a DQ finish, Cornette  again demands the match restart and it does, Vader even kicks out of Sweet Chin Music, the referree gets knocked out, here comes a Vader bomb that Michaels kicks out of. Vader goes for the moonsault but misses, Shawn hits a moonsault of his own and pins Vader to retain his title. 9/10.

(Available on Summerslam Anthology Volume II)

-8/3/97, Summerslam, Steel Cage Match: Triple H vs. Mankind: Pretty brutal one here, both men take shots against the steel, Chyna makes her presense felt as she tries to help Triple H win the match. Triple H hits the superplex from the top of the cage, Mankind suplex Triple H into the cage hanging him feet first from the top of the cage and hits a running double axe handle. Mankind is about to win when he goes back up to the top of the cage hitting a huge diving elbow onto Triple H. Mankind wins by dropping down to the floor moments before Chyna pulled Triple H through the door. Post match stuff with Mankind going to his Dude Love persona as he exited the ring side area. 8/10.

(Available on The Greatest Steel Cage Matches of All Time)

-8/4/97, WCW Monday Nitro, WCW Title Match: Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Lex Luger: Its Hogan vs. the man the NWA and WCW believed could be the next Hogan, Lex Luger. Power for power here, Hogan wears down Luger in the early going with kicks, fists and clotheslines, in fact besides a small flurry by Luger, Hogan dominates the first part of this match, having him pinned down but not out a few times. Luger does kick out of the Hogan leg drop, then makes his comeback, taking out the interfering members of the NWO. He slaps on the Torture Rack and Hogan gives up. Winner and new WCW Champion, Lex Luger. 6/10.

(Available on The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro)

-8/30/98, Summerslam, WWE Title Match: Undertaker vs. Stone Cold (Champion): This was the match billed as the Highway to Hell match and these two went all out as they usually did. Its a brutal and physical match, Austin wins after countering Taker's top rope walk and hitting the Stunner to retain his title.

(Available on Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line... & Summerslam Anthology Volume III)

-10/25/98, Halloween Havoc, United States Title Match: Sting vs. Bret Hart (Champion): A dream match for wrestling fans, but maybe its just me, something seemed to be missing. There's some delayling by Hart on the outside in the beginning, Sting finally gets his hands on Hart and he starts beating on him slowly and I do mean slowly, Bret gains the advantage even hitting a DDT for a 2 count. The match never seems to get out of first gear. The referree is knocked down, Sting hits the Stinger Splash in the corner but his head hits the ring post, Bret uses Sting's bat on him in the corner, uses a diving elbow with the bat and locks on the Sharpshooter, Sting is out cold and Bret retains his title. 6/10. Nice comment by Bobby Heenan as the referree comes to looking groggy, ""Looks like he's been hanging with Scott Hall for a week"".

-7/25/99, Fully Loaded, Strap Match: Triple H vs. The Rock: Nice pre-match promo by The Rock, this is a good solid match, as both men bring the physicality to each other. The strap marks up both men and the fists fly as well. The action spills to the outside, even into the crowd, into the entrance ramp, back to the ring. Triple H wins after nailing the pedigree, pretty good and brutal match. 8/10.

(Available on Falls Count Anywhere)

While not the greatest set ever put out, its nice to see some of the WCW matches and the profiles on the various stars, though I do wish they would've included one on Macho Man Randy Savage. The bios are short and sweet with some good tidbits sadly though, if you have a decent collection of wrestler bios you've seen a good chunk of them before. But if you want to relive some of the good moments from the '90's decade then by all means buy it. But outside of a few matches its not as great as it could've been.",1304467200,,20374,4.464891041162228
3755835,5,B001PPLJOU,"In my opinion, this the best DVD of 2009. Cool bios of guys you never hear about (Yokozuna, Lex Luger, Sting) and great matches.",1292976000,,128,4.375
3755836,5,B001PPLJOU,It had everything I could ever want mini bio's  perfect matches and it even had sting but if they put sting a person who hated WWE and worked in TNA why didn't they put Goldberg or DDP insanely popular 90s wrestlers who worked for WWE? But other than forgetting Goldberg and DDP it was my first and favorite wrestling DVd,1292803200,,321,4.35
3755837,4,B001PPLJOU,"I like this dvd a lot, WWE picked the right wrestlers that were the greatest stars of the 90's. My favorite stars were always Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, and The Undertaker. However I do think this dvd could have been better. WWE left out some great stars, such as Macho Man Randy Savage, the British Bulldog, and Vader. Randy Savage was all over the 90's winning the WWE Championship for the 2nd time at Wrestlemania 8. As well as winning the WCW Championship 4 times in the late 90's. The British Bulldog won the Intercontinental, Tag Team, and European Campionship. Big van Vader was a huge star in WCW in the early 90's winning the WCW Championship 3 times, and he was also a big star in the WWE in the late 90's. Now that I said all of that let me tell you what is on the DVD.

Disc Two:
A lot of the matches selected for this set aren't neccessarily all ""classic"" matches but morely rare gems that features some of the greatest stars of the 90's squaring off against one another or highlighting their best moments.

Madison Square Garden (November 30, 1991)
Hulk Hogan Vs. Ric Flair - This was one of the first rare one-on-one matches between Hulk Hogan & Ric Flair as they didn't compete much against one another in the WWE. The match is good overall with Flair having to rely on his dirty back of tricks to ALMOST get away with the victory over Hogan. 3.5/5

Survivor Series (November 25, 1992)
WWE Champion Bret Hart Vs. Shawn Michaels - Again, this was one of those classic confrontations between Bret Hart & Shawn Michaels early in their careers only to be overshadowed by their later battles together. This was a technical masterpiece & way better then their rematch at the same event 5 years later. 5/5

King Of The Ring (June 13, 1993)
WWE Champion Hulk Hogan Vs. Yokozuna - This is a WrestleMania IX rematch & a way better match than that 30 seconds of wrestling crap Yokozuna & Hogan put on 3 months earlier. Yokozuna regains the WWE Championship from Hogan in the end after an interference from a phony camera man. 3.75/5

WrestleMania X (March 20, 1994)
Owen Hart Vs. Bret Hart - Just a classic wrestling match from the Hart brothers. Unargubably, one of the greatest matches in WrestleMania's history. 5/5

Superstars (April 13, 1994)
WWE Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon Vs. Diesel - This was a very good back and forth battle. Razor Ramon came out electrified & giving it to Diesel right off the bat. This was a very good encounter from the later tag team known as the ""Outsiders"". 4/5

Slamboree (May 22, 1994)
Sting Vs. Vader - This was a match for the WCW International Heavyweight Championship (soon later the World Heavyweight Championship). This isn't as good as their past great battles but Sting & Vader gave a good performnce & delivered a good match. 4/5

Royal Rumble (January 22, 1995)
WWE Champion Diesel Vs. Bret Hart - If you like their Survivor Series match then you will like this one as well. Nealry the same kind of match as that was. 4.5/5

Raw (April 3, 1995)
WWE Women's Champion Bull Nakano Vs. Alundra Blayze - This match may seem out of place but this is undoubtfully one of the greatest Women's Title Match I have ever seen. Great action & maneuvers portrayed by both ladies. 5/5

Disc Three:
In Your House (Steptember 24, 1995)
WWE Champion Diesel & WWE Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels Vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Yokozuna & The British Bulldog (replacing Owen Hart) - All titles were on the line here similar to HHH/Stone Cold vs. Undertaker/Kane from Backlash in 2001. Overall, a pretty good tag team match. 4/5

In Your House (February 18, 1996)
Shawn Michaels Vs. Owen Hart - Owen & HBK delivered a great match here. Though not as good as HBK's & Owen's matches with Bret from the first disc but still is good. 4.5/5

SummerSlam (August 18, 1996)
WWE Champion Shawn Michaels Vs. Vader - This match proved that HBK can hang in there with anybody. Just a classic ""David vs. Goliath"" match. 5/5

SummerSlam (August 3, 1997)
Steel Cage Match: Hunter Hearst Helmsley Vs. Mankind - HHH & Mick Foley brought their A game in this match. Not as brutal & violent as their battles in 2000 for the WWE Title but still is worthy as one of their best matches together. 4.75/5

Nitro (August 4, 1997)
WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan Vs. Lex Luger - This match is all Hogan beating on Luger until Luger gets the comeback win and defeats Hogan andwins the WCW Championship. 3/5

SummerSlam (August 30, 1998)
WWE Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin Vs. Undertaker - The classic culmination of the ""Highway To Hell"" storyline. This is another classic match as the match is better then their matches in 1999 & 2001. 5/5

Halloween Havoc (October 25, 1998)
WCW United States Champion Bret Hart Vs. Sting - This match is a little bit of a disappointment. The match isn't bad but is certainly not on the classic level this match could've been. 3.5/5

Fully Loaded (July 25, 1999)
Strap Match: The Rock Vs. Triple H - This is another great battle from these two but I think their Fully Loaded 2 Out Of 3 Falls Match from a year earlier would've been a better choice. But this match is good what what its worth. 4.5/5

In the end, WWE did a better job here as oppose to their previous ""Greatest Stars Of The 80's"" DVD as in featuring the true stars that made the 90's what it was. But of course there can be a debate on which superstars (who was better in quality) should have made it to the list. Such as Vader who was just as big as Yokozuna but a far better athlete than him, Goldberg who made a huge impact througout his run in WCW, Mr. Perfect, Rob Van Dam, & a countless of other great superstars who made their names in the 90's. Along with better matches could have been chosen such as Bret & Owen Hart's Steel Cage Match from SummerSlam 1994 instead of their WrestleMania X match (that is also featured on Bret Hart's DVD), Undertaker should have been given his own match such as his Survivor Series 1994 Casket Match against Yokozuna, HHH's & Rock's match could've been replaced with their 1998 Fully Loaded match leaving another match to be chosen from 1999 such as The Rock vs. Stone Cold from WrestleMania XV. Though on the better hand, WWE did a way better job here so therefore, this set is recommended.",1247702400,2,12244,4.715823970037453
3755842,4,B001PPLJOU,ithink its a great dvd in regards the great stars of 90's. great run down on all the stars. great matches between the superstars but being a hulk hogan fan would of liked to see matches he won. got to see some matches  i never seen especially from wcw. sit back and enjoy,1246147200,,271,4.113207547169812
3755843,4,B001PPLJOU,"So what more can you expect from a DVD collection like this but massive amounts of content? It's three discs, two of them full of matches, many of them unavailable on DVD.

Of course, as Tazz even says in the DVD, people will complain about what superstars deserved to go into the collection and which were left out. My only complaint is Lex Luger. I have to ask in what way was he considered at equal footing with the likes of Sting, Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley, etcetera, while people like Vader or Goldberg or Anyone from ECW gets left out. But there I go again bitching and complaining.

The typical mini-biography format for every wrestler involved is excellently done, and special features and such includes great footage to see, including such things as the Undertaker and Paul Bearer's promo against Yokozuna, and Triple H's ""riff raff"" promo as Hunter Hearst Helmsley. Great laughs.

I was highly pleased to see an entire segment devoted to the ""Big Three"" promoters of the 90s: Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff, and Paul Heyman. Of course Paul Heyman is my wrestling hero promoter person. It's also quite refreshing to see them cover Sting so honestly and put him over so well, despite him having never worked for the WWF/WWE ever, and even acknowledge that fact, without burying him.

The entire segment on Owen Hart summed up to me feeling one powerful, pervading thought: Why does Owen Hart not have an entire DVD collection devoted to him?

But there's problems, of course, enough for me to drag this down a star:

Censorship: Blame those Pandalovers who filed that lawsuit on the WWF, and forced them to name-change to WWE. It's a huge distraction and instantly rips to shreds all immersion and intensity of a promo when one of the wrestlers says WWF, only to have all sound muted out on the ""F"". It's annoying, say, during Razor Ramon's promo in his car, hearing him say ""Doubleyou, Doubleyou, _____"" and have that noticeable gap while his lips still move, and even have the background music sloppily skip pace.

As well, all scratchy WWF logos are blurred out, causing huge visual eyesores in many of the Attitude-era matches.

But that's not all as well. Perhaps due to all this I hear about a ""PG-ifying"" and family friendly-izing of the WWE, words and blood are heavily censored as well. Words that they even still say on occasion on TV (like the A word, which is apparently even censored on Amazon) are censored. And any time blood is shown on screen, the image goes monochrome, like we're supposed to think that black goo on a wrestler's face is oil or boisenberry syrup!",1245024000,3,2588,4.722838137472284
3755844,2,B001PPLJOU,"The 90's was probably the greatest wrestling era due to the sever competition that made the writers and performers to out do them selves.

But let's face it after The Monday Night Wars there was no real competition for The WWE and TNA doesn't have the right tools and resources to compete at the same level of the old WCW.

So what's the best business logic for the WWE ... appeal to even a larger segment of audience by reintroducing The PG era again makes since right; while I do respect the company's business logic I don't like the method that they are applying it.

History is history regardless if it was good or bad however the WWE is being so protective of their new PG ratting that they are trying to rewrite their own history!

In this DVD The Rock's classical phrase of taking an object and shining it real nice turning it sideways ...ect wasn't even mentioned, Austin finger gesture is blurred , while if someone bleeds the screen turns into gray shades of black and white ... and so on with the censoring.

Older students of the game will know what I'm talking about and will be disappointed with this new product and if this is an indication of what's the future DVD releases of retro materials will be like then God help us all.

For the new generation of fans note that I won't talk on who should or shouldn't be on this list due to being subjective however the DVD presentation it self is not appealing cramming so many wrestlers into just one DVD set makes the experience unenjoyable just when you get into a wrestler the clip ends just like that ... not as good as a Documentary as WWE Greatest Wrestlers of The 80's which had fewer wrestlers but at least gave each and every one the rightful amount of time.

The other Two DVD's features matches however I won't call them as the greatest 90's matches I'll say good but not great, and if you own other WWE Greatest or Best DVD Collection then you probably have seen most of them.

Bottom-line this DVD doesn't appeal to either old or new generation of fans and I hope this would be a wakeup call for the WWE otherwise the integrity of the product will be destroyed and pro-wrestling fans will be left with an empty feeling inside.",1242432000,10,2199,4.425742574257426
