7853747,3,6303864716,"The last entry of Monogram Picture Corporation's ""Rough Riders"" series of eight films, shot at the ""Monogram Ranch"" in northern Los Angeles County's Placeritas Canyon, this work is a cut below the series norm, not helped by careless direction and editing, unconvincing stuntwork, and some fluffed lines (notably by Jack Daley), but whenever the three principals are on the screen - Buck Jones as Buck Roberts, Tim McCoy as Tim McCall, with Raymond Hatton as Sandy Hopkins - all playing Federal Marshals called upon to aid citizens of a town (Gold Creek, Nevada) infested with a criminal band, the production offers a good deal to enjoy as the trio of stalwarts relies upon its customary guile, cunning and use of disguise to overcome the forces of evil, here led by veteran blackguards of the Western genre Roy Barcroft and dour Harry Woods.",1102118400,4,841,4.929577464788732
7853748,4,6303864716,"This is one of eight Rough Riders westerns starring Buck Jones, Colonel Tim McCoy, and Raymond Hatton. As usual the trio is up against tough guy Harry Woods, but Colonel Tim has a plan to get the goods on Woods. At the  age of 50, Tim McCoy said adios to this series in 1942 and re-enlisted in  the Army. We lost Buck later the same year in Boston's Cocoanut Grove fire.  Hatton, who was actually younger than Buck and Colonel Tim, took his  loveable ol' geezer character, Sandy Hopkins, into another long-running  series of westerns with Johnny Mac Brown.",948326400,8,556,4.575757575757576
