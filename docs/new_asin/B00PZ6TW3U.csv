I will say there were lots of things that were predictable but overall.....fun stuff. No great surprises in the story so I will just say have some fun with it.

6838924,2,B00PZ6TW3U,"If you've seen the old Charles Atlas comic strip ad, you know the bare-bones plot of this movie. Nasty bully interferes with the hero's relationship, hero sends away for the Goddess Diana training course, beats up bully and shows his girl he's a Real Man. Of course there's a lot more to it than that. They try to slather on layers to imply that it's about commitment and hard work, and have him rescue the bland, generic girlfriend from certain death in the end, but the basic message is: you get the girl if you beat up other guys.

The movie starts with a heartwarming scene of Timo as a child, being told a bedtime story about a brave gladiator in a fight.  Even though this movie treats gladiators more like modern-day pro wrestlers than slaves trained to fight to the death...it still felt like a stretch. Does anyone's mom tell their kids bedtime stories about boxers or wrestlers, seriously? In any case, Timo's mom meets the fate of 99% of animated-movie moms shortly afterward as she is smooshed by falling rocks from a volcanic eruption. Timo is adopted by a gladiator trainer and becomes friends with his daughter, Lucinda.

The girl is sent off to school in Greece, which apparently removes all motivation from Timo's life, and he becomes a lazy slob. She finally returns, engaged to the Emperor's nephew, Cassius, an obnoxious gladiator bully. Eager to impress Lucinda after Cassio kicks him around, Timo takes a magic potion that lets him beat up Cassio.  He is immediately drug-tested, allowing for some potty humor, even though this is not an official sporting event...it's a dinner party or something...seriously.  Timo is now thrown out of Gladiator school as a cheater, and looks even more like a loser to his bland girlfriend.

Enter the stacked and sassy goddess Diana in her brass brassiere to force Timo (WHY she magically appears to do this is never explained) into a hardcore training regimen full of physical abuse, pratfalls, farting horses, and one single grateful hug that Lucinda coincidentally happens to witness so she can go into a tizzy of jealousy and refuse to listen to Timo's explanations.

Time to go to the Gladiator Games, which, for novelty's sake, are going to be TO THE DEATH this time, WITH ONLY ONE SURVIVOR!!!!!! The Emperor is fine with his nephew Cassio being one of the contestants...maybe he doesn't like the guy, either. Or maybe he realizes that...nobody is actually going to die anyway. They aren't. Nobody.

If you are over the age of 8, I really don't recommend this movie.  It isn't ALL terrible.  There are funny moments, and the rampaging mob of babies are amusing.  The hair on Timo is carefully animated to swish beautifully at all times, to the point where it is distracting. (If only they had put that much effort into the plastic-doll character designs.)

But if you just want something to keep your little boys riveted to the screen and whacking each other over the head with toy swords, while shoehorning in some lip service to non-cheating and working hard and the motivating power of love, this should fill the bill nicely.",1424476800,,3092,4.791353383458647
6838925,4,B00PZ6TW3U,"3 1/2 STARS FOR MOSTLY ENTERTAINING FEATURE WITH BEAUTIFUL SCENES  -- MAYBE NOT A CLASSIC

This CGI animated feature from Italy is fairly well done with beautiful artistry, excellent voice acting, and a well constructed story for it's genre.  Though the animation is beautiful, the facial expressions can be slightly wooden at about the level of the first Shrek movie (still pretty good).  The story is fairly entertaining with plenty of humor aimed at grown ups as well as kids.  Most of the humor for adults is a little flat.  The antics will still entertain youth below perhaps the pre-teen age.

THE PLOT:  Timo is a little boy who is separated from his mother during the eruption near Pompeii.  He is rescued by a Roman officer who is a famous former gladiator who now runs a gladiator school.  His young daughter Lucilla and Timo become fast friends and grow to early youth together.  When Lucilla goes off to Greece to study, Timo becomes aimless and disinterested in becoming a great gladiator like his step father.  Timo and Lucilla have always loved each other.  But when Lucilla returns from her studies when they are young adults, she is betrothed to marry Cassio, the star gladiator at school.  He also happens to be every woman's heart throb and the emperor's nephew.  However, Lucilla remembers her fondness for Timo and their friendship is rekindled.  Now Timo must find a way to become a great gladiator and defeat Cassio in hopes of winning Lucilla for his own.  In his misguided attempt, he uses a performance enhancing potion and is expelled from the gladiator school.  All seems hopeless, until the goddess Diana appears and becomes his personal trainer for the great games held in the new Colosseum.  True cheats will be revealed and Timo will have to be a hero in more ways than one.

For adults who love animation, this show is only mildly entertaining.  For younger kids, maybe much more so.  It does have some fart humor.  There is no blood letting or addressing slavery of gladiators, so you won't have to explain that to kids.  There is some mention of fighting to the death in the final match.  The little gang of toddlers who play gladiator are somewhat amusing.  I will leave it to individual families to decide what age is appropriate for viewing.  The negatives I mentioned are fairly mild and similar to even some Disney movies nowadays.  Teaches some fairness and work ethic.  I recommend a rental.",1418515200,4,2433,4.767386091127098

8689877,3,B00PZ6TW3U,"Like a seemingly endless succession of mediocre CG animated films before it, Gladiators of Rome is what happens when you take a foreign movie, slap an English dub atop the onscreen antics and release it as a finished piece.

In the case the source material comes to us from the unlikely country of Italy.  In fact, it arrived to us domestically in the year 2014 though it was making its rounds through theaters in its native Europe as far back as 2012.  The film is directed by Iginio Straffi, who also cowrote the screenplay as well as co-produced it.

Built initially upon a budget of $45-million, it is rumored to have barely recovered a fraction of its production costs by the time it had been brought to the Americas.  All told, the global gross for the film is estimated only as returning $50-million.  This is particularly troubling considering in the US alone it somehow earned the distribution efforts of DreamWorks own distribution channel in Paramount Pictures.

The story here follows a lad named Timo- from his humblest of beginnings as a survivor of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii in the year 79 AD.  He is immediately rescued and taken in by Chirone; the fair and honest owner of a gladiator training academy, where he is raised as Chirones own son.

Unfortunately (and slightly disturbingly) when his step-sister through adoption, Lucilla, heads to Greece to get her studies on, our pal Timo decides to throw in the towel on this game called life.  He allows himself to become fat and defeated, picked on even by a marauding band of baby gladiators in addition to taking abuse from his own peers.

Once Lucilla returns home (did Timo really fear no end to her education?), Timo suddenly needs to get his life turned around in a hurry as being a gladiator means a fight to the death in the Coliseum if hes to have any hope of defeating the boisterous Cassio and winning the hand of his step sister once and for all.

If this isn't all askew enough, a nearly-nude, high heel-sporting dominatrix chick named Diana shows up seemingly out of nowhere to train our hapless hero.  Who she really is or why she decides to help is never made clear but by this point in the muddled mess that is Gladiators of Rome, it should be the least of ones concerns.

The films biggest flaw has got to be its pacing.  Moments like Timos having become an orphan and then being taken in to another family are all whisked over literally within the first three minutes of the film.  From there you will endure frequent segments of little more than mindless slapstick.  In fact, its almost impossible to find a sequence in this movie that doesnt try every trick in the book to elicit a laugh of the slapstick/ Loony Toons variety.  There are trips, slips, smacks, whiffs and kicks to the genitals in nearly every shot.

And in the event that even this weren't enough to make the audience chuckle, theres a host of animals integrated as backup: a rabbit that gets beat on for no apparent reason, a tag team bear and bobcat looking for victims to maul, a horse with unrelenting gas. Straffi must not have gotten the memo that when it comes to comedy, often less is more.  Such blatant over-reaching here has almost the opposite effect; scenes that may ordinarily have been cute are nothing but annoying for having been shoved down the viewers proverbial throat with such regularity.

On a grander level there is the subtle fact that nothing about this story really makes much sense- Does Timo even want to be a Gladiator?  Nowhere here is the lifestyle presented as a result of slavery but rather as a legit career choice.  One that just so happens to culminate in a fight- to the death no less.  Is surviving this the only way to win the affection of the woman he loves?  If so, is that really the type of woman he should be hoping to marry?  Of course this isn't even taking into consideration that they are essentially step-siblings.  Or that while Timo was off training in a slap-stick-o-rama with Diana, Lucilla was fraternizing with Timos arch nemesis Cassio.  And who is Diana?  She appears out of thin air with no real motivation to help Timo.  Did I mention there is a band of baby gladiators running around doing, for reasons never explained, Cassios bidding?

Visually the film makes use of some wonderful textures and solid models but the animations are cobby and inconsistent.  Again, the focus here seems to have been on delivering silliness and slappy gags rather than capturing any depth of human emotion through the medium of animation.

All in all, theres a very clear explanation for why, after having toured nearly the entire globe, Gladiators of Rome only barely recovered the money it cost to be made; it simply fails to deliver on any of the promise in its premise.",1487808000,,4806,4.649704142011834

8689880,1,B00PZ6TW3U,"I rented this for my 8, 7, and 4 year old boys to watch on a trip. It sounded cute enough so I sat down with them when they watched it again later. I was shocked to find that the animators and creators were obviously obsessed with breasts! The old witch who provided Timo with magic potion had prominent sagging breasts. His trainer was a veluptious, scantily clad, brass brassiered beauty who, at one point, held the hero down on the ground with a booted foot to his crotch. Most of the female spectators were in scant bikinis.
A couple of times the ""camera angle"" came up on the trainer in such a way that I thought we were about to look up the trainer's barely there skirt.

The plot and the humor are not something I encourage but it was pretty on point for my boys age range (think farting horse). That is where the appropriateness ended. I would not recommend this movie for any age group.",1432857600,,895,4.3273809523809526
