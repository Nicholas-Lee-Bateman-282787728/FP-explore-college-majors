8143057,2,B000I0QLM8,I really enjoy Sophia's work but this DVD is really a poor product and I wouldn't recommend it.  I was really looking forward to Two Women.,1363046400,,139,4.346153846153846
8143058,3,B000I0QLM8,"This is an inexpensive two-pack of two of Sophia Loren's classic films - her famous ""Two Women"", which seems to be public-domain and has therefore appeared in so many different VHS and DVD releases that I've lost count, and ""Get Rita"", which is presented here for the first time on U.S. DVD, to the best of my knowledge. As ""Two Women"" is so well-known, I'll talk briefly about ""Get Rita"". It's a diverting caper comedy starring Sophia and the equally legendary Marcello Mastroianni, about a klutzy showgirl who becomes the object of the passion of a mobster with a serious - and I do mean serious - Rita Hayworth fetish. (One of the funniest bits is a sequence where Sophia's character tries to do a tribute to Hayworth's famous ""Gilda"" song-and-dance ""Put the Blame on Mame"" sequence in a swanky restaurant, with disastrous results.) The transfer is passable quality though not up to the standards of a major-studio release, but for a rare movie like this, beggars can't really be choosers.  Best suited for serious Loren fans.",1225843200,3,1029,4.813559322033898
8143059,5,B000I0QLM8,These were two very different films. Get Rita was a funny romp and Two Women was a serious film. Both were enjoyable. I bought this set for Two Women. In 1961 Sophia Loren won an Oscar for this Italian wartime drama.  It is simply a great film.,1217548800,3,244,4.191489361702128
