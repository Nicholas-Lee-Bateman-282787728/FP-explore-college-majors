2861252,2,B000R7HY5A,"I watched this because it stars Suh Jung, the girl from ""The Isle."" I was very disappointed. Apparently what made her so compelling in ""The Isle"" was confined to that movie. Green Chair was a bore. AND, I never saw a Green Chair in the movie. So what's that about?",1404777600,,264,4.3
2861253,5,B000R7HY5A,"Great movie.

But please somebody help me.  After the end of the party scene in which Hyun is kissing etc Mun-hee against the table (and Jean watches, seated at the table), it fades to black and the next thing we see is the subtitle ""Mun-hee left""....and Mun-Hee appears saying ""One month, two months, one year"" like they have not been in touch that long. ....the VERY ending Hyun is kissing a woman, I THINK it Mun-hee.  So, did Mun-hee leave for a year or more, and then they reunited?  Please if there is anyone who knows answer.  Perhaps the English translation in the subtitles did not fully convey what happened and the actual Korean dialog did reveal what happened (I have noticed often that subtitles or captions are often not accurate).

I was feeling really great when, at the end of the party, Mun-hee and Hyan are making out against the table as Jean looks on.  Then I was grabbed in the stomach when I saw ""Mun-hee left""!!!!!",1397520000,2,938,4.5476190476190474

2861255,4,B000R7HY5A,"This was an interestig take on the age of consent.  The stroy was good, some nudity and sexual content (lite).  The thing I found most interesting is how certain taboos seem to cross all culters.  An older woman and a younger man just doesn't seem acceptable in any culture, but this movie suggests that love has no age limit.  Alright, that sounds ""touchy feely"" even to me.  Hey, but it works and it's entertaining.",1362787200,,417,4.581081081081081
2861256,5,B000R7HY5A,"This movie should be a cult classic any day now if it's not already.  It's artsy enough to pass into any analysis that you might want to give it, and seductive enough to keep any ridiculous boyfriend not into foreign films interested.  The acting was dead on, the emotion was a plenty, and it tells the story of something very very common place in the U.S. these days.  At many levels this addresses the May-December relationship or the Cougar-Cub, whichever you want to call it.  However, it puts all the uncomfortableness and beauty of these relationships in a light that is seldom found in movies.  Gutsy and true to a real good movie I'd recommend this movie to most any one.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.",1319241600,,716,4.5546875
2861257,4,B000R7HY5A,"A very sensuous story about the relationship between a young man and an older woman, although you could never tell the diference in age. One can feel the emotion that exudes between the two characters. This is a remarkable film, tastefully done and one you can watch repeatedly.",1286323200,,278,4.8125
2861258,4,B000R7HY5A,"An affair between a 19 year old man and a 32 year old divorced woman doesn't seem so shocking to most Americans.  It is even the kind of thing that would be applauded on a show like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B0011UBDTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>, and the woman would probably get little more than a few snide looks and maybe pats on the back.  But apparently it is a jailing offense in Korea, where stricter laws bind the morality of a country.

This is where ""Green Chair"" (""Noksaek uija"") begins.  A passionate encounter is consumated and ends abruptly, with the older woman, Mun-hee, jailed and the young man, Hyun, confused and longing for his lover.  Soon released, what Mun-hee thought was just sex and youthful desire becomes more as Hyun refuses to let her go, and pursues her with a passion she thought long lost in her jaded world view.

Even though it is based on a true story, ""Green Chair"" is not the most original of films.  This kind of love story has been played out time and again on screen and in newspapers, with much more shocking variances in ages.  However, when dealing with an unoriginal story, what matters most are the director's style and the actor's ability, and how they make the most of the material to present the tale.

Director Cheol-su Park has plenty of style, and knows how to position his actors for maximum effect.  The first part of the film, detailing the lovers stay at a hotel where Mun-hee teaches Hyun about the more intimate relations between a man and a woman, is incredibly sexy.  The realism with which the scenes are handled makes it much more intimate and enticing, without cheesy music or artistic framing and heaving breasts.  One could easily picture these acts as actually taking place, and probably are in hotels all over the world.  Moving away from the sensual, Park steers the film to the difficult part of relationships, when lust has run its course and two human beings must decide if they can overcome the differences that separate them and make a life together.  There are shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Betty-Blue/dp/B0002TSZH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Betty Blue</a>&nbsp;here, especially when the two make home with a friend, Jean, and live their unusual lifestyle, and even a hint of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Realm-of-the-Senses/dp/1572528338/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Realm of the Senses</a>, but with none of the obsessive insanity.  Just the good parts.

All of the actors also aquit themselves with style and grace.  The beautiful Jung Suh is irresistable as Mun-hee, and makes me wish I had someone like her to show me the ways of adults when I was 19.  Relative newcommer Ji-ho Shim is also excellent as Hyun, projecting innocence and unworldliness without appearing nave.

Not that it is a perfect film.  The steamy first half is too seperated from the second, and one wonders where the passion went.  The story takes some strange turns, not all of which are for the good of the story, but it eventually comes back on course.  But the good outweighs the bad, and ""Green Chair"" is definitely a film to see.",1217203200,6,3289,5.308880308880309
2861259,3,B000R7HY5A,"Green Chair is a tale of forbidden love between a 32 year old divorcee and a 19 year old college student. Based on a true story, GREEN CHAIR is the first film in four years from controversial director Park Chul-Soo, best known for ""301,302"". Seo Jeong (THE ISLE, Spider Forest) plays Kim Mun-hee, a nice 32-year-old woman who's making whoopee with a 19 year old boy, Hyeon ( Shim Ji-ho). Unfortunately for them, 20 is the age of consent in Korea, and she's arrested, locked up and sentenced to community service.

Upon her release, Mun-hee tries to ditch the handsome young 19 year old, but he just won't go away(looking at Korean bombshell Seo Jeong, I wouldn't want to leave either). Instead they shack up in a motel and have a few more days of exhausting sex(who wouldn't). Eventually, doubts start to creep into Mun-hee's mind, and even though she is in love with him, she decides to end the affair. However, Mun-hee couldn't resist Hyun's persistence and their relationship enters a new phase.

At first impression, Park Chul-Soo's Green Chair may seem like a straightforward tale of erotic sex and the occasional sense of guilt, but it ends up being a lot more than that. The First act of the film is highly explicit (quite tame when compared to the Korean erotica Summertime), there is quite a bit of nudity, Seo Jeong is in her birthday suit in the first few minutes. The film doesn't merely focus on eroticism, so I don't think it will turn off a lot of viewers. When things start to settle down and we get to observe all the details of Hyun and Mun-hee's unusual relationship, from Hyun's fondness for cooking to Mun-hee's preferences when it comes to mattreses and other stuff, the film presents such dimensions with warmth and humor, that results in a nuanced, touching and subversive love story. Characters are well developed and I did kind of sympathize with the lovers' plight.

Green Chair draws its strength from Park's inimitable style of directing and its great cast. Seo-Jeong or Jung Suh(same actress, you can't help but be enamored with her), renowned for her role in Kim Ki-Duk's ""THE ISLE"", brings a slightly unhinged vitality and raw appeal to the character of Mun-hee; while newcomer Shim Ji-ho(as Hyun) gives passion and confidence to his character. Oh Yun-Hong(Power of Kangwon province) plays Mun-hee's friend who takes the lovebirds in. The warm chemistry/camaderie shared between the 3 characters is one of the film's key strengths.

People who are only looking for pervy kicks will be disappointed and will be better off watching late night Cinemax instead. While there's plenty of sex on display and quite frankly they are nicely shot, the movie is more focused in the essential drama of problems and complications which are unavoidably inherent in every sex-based relationship, compounded when one partner is risking it all to stay in it.

I own the 1-disc region-3 release. From my experience, Asian releases of Asian movies have the best transfers.
PICTURE/AUDIO: Anamorphic widescreen 1.78. Clean, sharp and colors are accurate. PQ is very good. 5.1 Dolby/2.0 Surround in Korean language. English Subtitles are well-translated and very visible.
In Closing:
GREEN CHAIR is not a perfect film, but it is funny and beautiful with its poetic digressions. It is a pro-sex movie with a touch of human drama. It is a bit on the ""artsy"" side but I hope it gives you some ideas. It has been selected in the New York Asian film festival.

RECOMMENDED! 3  stars",1182729600,29,3487,4.86026936026936

2861332,4,B000R7HY5A,"Green Chair is a good movie that has a good combination of drama and eroticism. The story is about a male High School and his relationship with a female divorce. It centers on the progress of that relationship from a sexual-oriented love affair to a love relationship. It has entertaining sex scenes.

The film was a psychological movie that is not for everyone as it is not meant to entertain but rather for the audience to see the character development between the main characters. The acting is commendable as Su Jung excels as the female divorce. While the rest of the cast are decent. I would recommend this to anyone who wants another view at a May-December affair especially when maturity comes into place.",1421280000,,713,4.75

She later tells him that they're better off parted and makes her way to her girlfriend's home only to find that he's arrived there ahead of her, so the fun continues, only now with their cute hostess added to the mix.
