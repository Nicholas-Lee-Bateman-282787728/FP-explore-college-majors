7588265,3,B01A5NZ362,"Driftless Area is based on a book of the same name by Tom Drury. I haven't read that and watched this DVD knowing nothing about it before hand. Now that I have seen the film if I really want to understand everything I've just seen, I'll probably need to read the book. However the movie wasn't that great, that I'll ever bother too. The story is shown to us in sort of drifting pieces of information in a flowing river of a plot, like debris in a river, some pieces flow faster, some slower. Most parts of the story are told to us in reverse, we see a hitcher with a pot plant get into a car after paying $20 for the privillege (why he doesn't just tell the driver to get lost and wait for the next car when he demands $20 I'll never know). The driver acts like a real jerk, tells him ""his brother came into a lot of cash"" then dumps him at the side of the road and steals his plant. The hitcher lobs a rock at the car which somehow knocks the driver out and he crashes. Hitcher then steals the bag of money, flees on foot but falls down a well. Zooey's character then rescues him even though I can't see how she physically would have (and when we find out even more it's completely impossible). We then find out how he got the rock, where he got the plant, why the jerk driver had all the cash, and everything else in reverse. Giving away anything else would be spoiling the movie for you.

Once over it's a bit confusing what some characters were, what they weren't. It is confusing but isn't boring in telling the story. Worth watching, but forgettable once you have, and not something you'll ever likely want to watch again. Perhaps if you've read the book you'll get more out of it.",1463097600,,1687,4.222910216718266

7588273,2,B01A5NZ362,"Lots of problems here. John Hawkes was his usual ""I look just like a Confederate soldier who just came back from the war"" self, and his acting was great. He was the most random and casual criminal I have seen yet, basically stealing anything he could get, including a rose bush. Jumping from one stolen car to another, he left a path of petty crime in his wake. How he managed to stay out of prison at all was a mystery. Perhaps his crimes were so small no one bothered to call the Police. This guy made a lot of getaways, but he was no artist. Even his one very serious crime was done unknowingly. The movie was stolen by a secondary character, a very deadpan fellow criminal to Hawkes, who had the hots for him in an incongruously flat affect way. (Aubrey Plaza, who I've never heard of before. She's an actress to watch for her past and future work.) There was lots of shallow, ultimately meaningless dreck about time, life, possibilities, and such, with as much meaning as a drifter hanging out at a bus station reading 'Us' magazine.  Zoey Deshanel is beautiful, but that isn't enough to carry this muddled story.",1472256000,,1118,4.480392156862745

7588275,4,B01A5NZ362,I think they did a decent job paring down the plot of the novel to something that would fit the length of a film.  I did not expect so much screen time for the Shane character.  Anton Yelchin used kind of an odd voice for his character.,1469491200,,236,4.0

7588278,1,B01A5NZ362,I kept waiting for it to get good. The acting was emotionless. I had high expectations with Zooey being in it as she's one of my favorite actors but was disappointed.,1469404800,,166,4.387096774193548
7588279,5,B01A5NZ362,"Great movie!

Amazing characters and I loved the storyline. The story unfolds in different sequence--but not hard to follow at all. Very character driven and a sublime feeling throughout as the plot unwinds and twists. Stella is magic.",1469232000,,235,5.184210526315789

7588282,5,B01A5NZ362,"Great film that made me think what is real, what is imagination and what it might be like to die. So sad and ironic that the main character just died in real life last week in a car accident! :*(",1466640000,3,195,3.9

7588287,4,B01A5NZ362,"I can sum this film up into one word ... 'intriguing'. Next let me say this is not for everyone, especially the masses that need ever more visual stimulation. Instead, it's a coffee house discussion late into the night regarding exactly what is going on plus interpretations of purpose and meaning.

The characters are reasonably well developed with a bit of mystery surrounding each. The theme(s), as mentioned before, are fuzzy but seem to center around destiny, time, the afterlife and deliverance. That is, it's real hard to describe. So chalk this one up as an artsy movie.

The acting is reasonably good with some notable veteran character actors such as the great Hawkes and Langella. I initially had a hard time recognizing Deschanel with her new nose job which has changed her whole persona into an every-girl look even though she's still attractive. But I just don't understand these wheelbarrow-head movie stars when they do this sort of thing. Anyway, her voice has also changed a bit from that Southern California drawl with a little grit to a more deliberate generic enunciation. Yet she does a reasonably good job as a mysterious supporter of the main protagonist played well by Anton Yelchin whom I haven't seen since the old 'Taken' sci-fi series many years ago when he was a kid.

I really kind of like these unusual 'thinking' type flicks so gave it a four star for entertainment. If I watch it again a few times, which is what this film demands if you like this genre, I may go another star.",1464307200,5,1511,4.737642585551331

The cast was perfect and Anton was wonderful as always.  SPOILER ALERT:  What hurts is that Anton's character dies young at the end, not to far from when Anton himself died young this year. Ouch. I will always miss this multi-layered, real, thought-provoking, beautiful-inside-and-out actor. May he be with the angels in a better place, in peace and happiness forever....",1480636800,,571,4.643564356435643
