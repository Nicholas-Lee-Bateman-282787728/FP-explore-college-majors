6759699,1,B00OQRU968,The video said head shoulder knee and toe but that was not the DVD that was in the package. The top paper came off and it is actually the best of Elmo.,1500508800,,151,3.75
6759700,1,B00OQRU968,I'm just reviewing this long after purchasing because we hardly use this DVD.  The primary reason being that it skips the whole way thru to where my 2 year old GD tells me to take it off!!!  really mad that I didn't report it sooner.  I bought an elmo's world all about animals which is damaged the same.  I'll review that one next.,1496188800,,332,4.222222222222222
