2608289,4,B000GFRICC,"I found out about this movie from fangora magazine. So I took a chance on renting it. Only one video rental company stocked it and I couldn't understand why ! But when I watched it I then knew. For one the movie was only 70 mins long the rest are extras ! So beware of this when watching it or purchasing it ! But other than that the movie's cinematography was excellent for a straight to video movie. And the director has a very unique vision it would almost put you in the mind of a dream sequence like David Lynch ! The acting was good and very convincing and the tone of the movie was dark.

As far as a plot development :

It was about a young woman tormented with jealiousy of her next door neighbor. She was jealous of the relationship that they had and the fact that they were about to have a baby. She couldn't get pregnant and her husband was a dead beat in bed ! So the movie takes alot of violent and gruesome twist and turns. There are a hell of alot of ""In her head sequences along with alot of screwed up Dialogue. So if you are looking for something like this ? Don't hesitate to check this movie out ! There is plenty of nudity throughout this film and strange symbolic overtones. Like for instance the pregnant neigbor was attracted to her and openly admitted it ! So there was alot of flurting amongst the two which makes you wonder if they are ever going to get together outside of there relationships. I can't tell you the plot of the movie because I can't spoil it for you ! But there is a shocking ending that would leave you to believe that this girl was pretty selfish and self centered! And more than that completley off her rocker! The movie is very graphic in a large sense definitley worth checking it out, if you can stand the 70 min movie time ! One spoiler for you they bring a undeveloped fetis to dinner !",1160870400,8,1839,4.192090395480226

8131551,2,B000GFRICC,"The flaw of this movie is that the main character, played by Misty, is working from a poor script from the beginning. The entire thing is a make believe horror story in which there are multiple errors in the script. Mr Marsiglia seems to have a problem getting scripts together where basic details are not botched. A low budget is no excuse for the silly moments that ruin the performance of a great actress and beauty, Erin Brown(ie Misty Mundae)and the very good ensemble. Misty's husband, who does a fine job as a realistic character, has trouble ""getting it up"" no doubt because he is married to the totally psychotic Misty, who goes into inexplicable and sudden rages when she wants sex, and achieves the opposite effect when in bed with her mate. Love is not part of the equation as Misty has no conception of love, but simply selfish behavior.

We are not given any real explanation for her behavior other than her mother also appears to be a ""head case"". The scene where the parents switch to have sex with the children must be acccepted as a dream sequence as the possibility of this happening in real life is very unlikely. Misty's use of the axe to ""clean out"" the fetus from the womb of her best friend and lover borders on the preposterous. This may be applied to the entire movie. If you like nightmares you will love this movie.",1302566400,,1343,4.526748971193416
8131552,3,B000GFRICC,"Let me just warn you the cover picture is not at all included in the film. Lots of nudiy/profanity, and 2 moderate sex scenes, and one rather long one. Sinful is a film that is described as a psychological thriller, but really isn't. Most of the film Misty Mundae walks around nude, but she isn't her best in this (as she was in MASTERS OF HORROR: SICK GIRL.) Sinful definatly could've been better. The cover is the reason why I gave it 3 stars otherwise I would've given it 2. The best pergformer was Erika Smith, because she is a rather good performer. Sinful is basicly copying the film (The Hand that Rocks the Cradle). I say this, because Lilith (Mundae) desperatly wants a baby, but cannot concieve a child, while Lilith and her husband are two new neighbors, next to Aisha (Smith) and her husband who has a child in Aisha's stomach. Lilith later becomes obsessed and decides thaat she must steal Aisha's baby girl.",1202947200,4,921,4.554216867469879
8131553,4,B000GFRICC,"The obsessive desire to bear a child is a theme that director Tony Marsiglia  touched on in his 2004 offering, `Lust for Dracula'. In that film, Misty Mundae portrayed an abused and childlike woman desperate for her own child to love. In this latest movie, the same actress takes the lead role as Lilith, a woman whose desire to become pregnant overrides all else in her life.

 As is often the case in Marsiglia's films, the line between reality and fantasy is a fine one. At times in `Sinful' that line disappears altogether along with Lilith's sanity. She is very much the abusive partner in a marriage that has seen her obsession undermine her relationship with her husband (Ronnie Kerr) who is unable to keep up with Lilith's sexual aggression. Add to the mix  the seemingly perfect couple next door, Sam and Aisha (Nikos Psarras and Erika Smith) whose gentle lovemaking (imagined or overheard by Lilith) results in Aisha's pregnancy.

The confusing nature of the film's narrative may not have been helped by the loss of the primary location as filming was about to commence. Low-budget films such as this are also sometimes hindered by a punishing shooting schedule. `Sinful' was shot in four days. Nevertheless, this is an extraordinary film that will unfortunately be pigeonholed in the `erotic thriller' category and thus ignored by a wider audience. No doubt if it were Japanese, the critics would be hyperventilating on seeing it.

Misty Mundae puts in a superb performance as the frustrated Lilith. She is by turns, thoroughly nasty in her selfish and insular desire, and an object of pity as she fantasizes about the perfect family life that she craves. Erika Smith also excels as the little-miss-perfect neighbor of whom Lilith is so jealous.

Inevitably, given its surreal style, the film will probably remind some viewers of David Lynch's work, `Eraserhead' in particular. There's also more than a hint of Dennis Potter here too.  John Castine's performance, as Lilith's sexually abusive stepfather, has him directing her to satisfy his lust using (intentionally) an appallingly bad American accent in a scene that would not be out of place in a Potter screenplay.

Among the bonus material is a director's commentary that sounds as though it was recorded in Tony Marsiglia's front room. He is interrupted on a couple of occasions by his dog's barking. Marsiglia is a very talented director and writer and his commentary about the film's troubled production is fascinating. Strangely, the commentary ends before the final scene.

Those looking for a nice dose of soft porn will be disappointed with this. The eroticism inherent in Marsiglia's previous films is missing here. There's plenty of nudity certainly, but no lingering shower scenes (`Sin Sisters') or vampire sex (`Lust for Dracula'). All Marsiglia's other films are worth a look if you want more than just a straightforward sex film. Along with the two previously mentioned, `The Witches of Sappho Salon' and `Doctor Jekyll and Mistress Hyde' are fine examples of erotic b-movies. There is also the as yet unreleased `Chantal' to look forward to, and Marsiglia mentioned in his commentary that a `Frankenstein' movie is in the offing. Can't wait!",1176076800,4,3223,5.052730696798493
8131554,5,B000GFRICC,"This film walks a fine line between being a exploitation film, or an art house film. There are disturbing themes from incest, abortion, and murder.

Tony Marsiglia is not a conventional writer/director. His movies most of the time are usually loved or hated. This is a vast improvement from his last film released by EI cinema(Now POP cinema) Lust for Dracula. Sinful is not a total T&A fest like his previous offerings. Yes there is nudity but not used for the purpose of arousing the viewers. This film is one of the darkest and macabre films i've seen. The plot revolves lilith and her desire to become pregnant and have a baby. She meets Aisha who becomes pregnant and befriends lilith. Lilith becomes obsessed with Aisha and then becomes envious of her. The film creates a mood that is melancholy, hopeless, and bizzare.",1169251200,2,825,4.769230769230769
