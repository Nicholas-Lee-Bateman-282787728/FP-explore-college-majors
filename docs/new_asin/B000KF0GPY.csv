8156109,4,B000KF0GPY,"Eddie Kasalivich (Keanu Reeves) is first among his colleagues searching for free clean energy to better the world. On the eve of what looks like success a horrible accident (yeah right) dispatches Dr. Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall.)

Eddie complains that it was not an accident so of course everyone knows that Eddie is the culprit assisted by colleagues Dr. Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz), and Lu Chen (Tzi Ma). While his employer Paul Shannon (Morgan Freeman) is unshakably not sure (why?).

As with most mysteries the only way to prove his innocence is to find the guilty.

All the parts are well played and the story is just in plausibility. The twists and turns will keep you intrigued until the last. Not too long of a chase scene.",1497657600,,739,4.803149606299213
