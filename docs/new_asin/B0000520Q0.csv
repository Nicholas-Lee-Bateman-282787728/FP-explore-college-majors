1389582,3,B0000520Q0,"if you are into 70's movies watch it, the ending was abrupt/sudden and unsatisfying tho
if you have prime and 1.5 hours to kill it is entertaining. if i had paid to see it i would have felt ripped off",1478563200,,200,4.025

1389595,5,B0000520Q0,"Excellent B movie ,no plot but lots of action and cool cars. Reminded me of the junks I used to drive all jacked op with shackles and air shocks. Ahh the good ol' days of bias ply 60 series tires, massive smokey burn outs and street racing at every light. If you grew up in the 70's it's a must watch brought back some good memories.",1479945600,,333,4.0606060606060606

1389600,2,B0000520Q0,More like a biker flick than a hot rod movie. Poor transfer had an aspect ratio that was off (cars looked too tall and narrow ). Mel Ferrer has a minor role as sheriff. Speed Racer plot: Son of rich rancher dies racing. Rancher says racers bad! Racers must die!,1479427200,,261,4.24

1389608,3,B0000520Q0,I was a old street racer  and this takes me back to my youth. The acting is not good however it's a good story.,1479081600,,111,3.625
1389609,1,B0000520Q0,Don't watch this even if you want to see muscle cars.,1478995200,,53,3.909090909090909

7929866,5,B0000520Q0,"This was the first movie I ever acted in, so how can I not like it?!  Old school ""B"" movie, shot by a great cinematographer, Dean Cundey. He photographed  ""Jurassic Park"" for Stephen Spielberg.",1502582400,,193,4.647058823529412
7929867,2,B0000520Q0,"The acting was worse than awful, clearly low budget, the car ""stunts"" were anti-climatic. I guess it was a typical 70's car movie. I love car movies, but this one was hard to sit through.",1483056000,,187,4.371428571428571

7929872,4,B0000520Q0,"A perfect film to watch and critique the filmmakers technique. Lessons to be learned about shot transition, takes, camera placement, shot angles, and footage sequencing. Even more points to be learned on scriptwriting, acting, delivery, and how to climax and end a film. Overall it was an entertaining way to passively experience a film and enjoy related discussion during the screening.",1481328000,,387,5.360655737704918
7929873,2,B0000520Q0,Really a corny movie,1481241600,,20,4.25
7929874,4,B0000520Q0,totally trashy! In a great way! It is the kind of movies the drive in would use for double header movie nights in the 70's,1481155200,,122,3.92
7929875,5,B0000520Q0,Great movie! Anyone who loves drag racing should watch this! :),1480636800,,63,4.818181818181818
