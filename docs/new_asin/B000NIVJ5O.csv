8177993,5,B000NIVJ5O,"CHAPTERS -is a new movie written, directed, produced and filmed in Memphis - the new Hollywood.

From the creative genius Mr. K-Cutta, Chapters is a story narrated by the main character Alphonzo better known as Zo,  who was raised by his God fearing grandmother.  Big Mama's struggles, faith and words of wisdom are not enough to keep Zo from the lure of the mean streets of Memphis.  Zo tries his hand in the game of street hustling when he decides at a young age that the Almighty Dollar is more powerful than the Almighty God.

The performances by an ensemble cast in this independent film are outstanding.  Audiences everywhere will enjoy and relate to this wonderful film.

Kudos to Mr. K-Cutta and the entire cast and crest for showcasing the talented actors, writers, producers, rappers and muscians in this movie.",1139097600,,821,4.821428571428571
8177994,5,B000NIVJ5O,"I was fortunate enough to be at the premier of CHAPTERS, in Memphis. I didn't know what to expect from this new filmmaker, K-Cutta, but I found myself laughing out loud, sympathizing with the situations and finally cheering at the end. Alphonzo is the main character who is raised by his God-fearing grandmother but easily influenced by his friends and what is going on in his community. It took some time, but Zo realizes that Big Momma (his grandmother) is not trying to tell him how to live his life, she's only his guide in life. This is a poignant tale and a true to life story of what goes on inside of many families raising boys to be men. It also shows a real side of Memphis from the rap music to famous landmarks and restaurants. CHAPTERS is a must see for everyone especially teenagers. Kudos to K-Cutta Productions! I look forward to seeing upcoming films from this powerhouse.",1139011200,,889,4.5625
