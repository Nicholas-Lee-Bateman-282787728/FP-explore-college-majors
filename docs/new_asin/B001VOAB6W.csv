3823078,5,B001VOAB6W,"This movie was a hit from start to finish. You want to take DJ(James Woods)hug him  and make everything alright. Anyone who has taken care of a family member can relate to the dilemma's Bob(James Garner)faces. Although at times I think someone should have smacked Bob(James Garner)upside his head. In my opinion , this is the best performance of James Woods career to date.",1270080000,3,373,4.828125
3823079,5,B001VOAB6W,"I bought the DVD, watched it with my own eyes, but am still struggling to really believe that it's true! For years, every time I saw that a Hallmark movie was on, or in any other way was reminded that Hallmark makes movies, I'd get on the internet and search for this movie. ""Promise"", in my humble opinion, is simply the best movie that Hallmark has ever produced.
James Garner gives an outstanding performance as a man who's life is turned upside down due to a promise he made to his mother, that he would care for his schizophrenic brother in the event of her death. Piper Laurie gives a terrific performance as well, but James Woods is unquestionably the star, giving a bravura performance as Garner's brother ""DJ"".
I'm not going to give any more of the story away. Suffice to say, there is a reason that this is, as listed on the DVD case, the most highly acclaimed and award winning Hallmark movie ever. I couldn't possibly recommend it more highly.",1262995200,49,955,4.526011560693641
3823080,5,B001VOAB6W,"This was a very good movie. I had heard about it, and I've been looking for it for a long time. I would recommend this movie highly.  ""Promise"", starring James Garner and James Woods, is a very good movie. I think James Woods won a well deserved award for it.",1243987200,7,259,4.18
3823081,5,B001VOAB6W,A wonderful and touching movie. Both stars shine in this story of love and loyalty to family commitment.,1447977600,,104,4.833333333333333
3823082,5,B001VOAB6W,"IMO, James Garner was an underrated actor, and paired with James Woods, this story of two brothers, one mentally ill, is a sympathetic one. Piper Laurie also good.",1435449600,,163,4.857142857142857

3823089,5,B001VOAB6W,"As a major James Garner I admit I think everything he made was fgold but this really was an incredibly touching movie. Heartfelt and sincere performances from James Garner, James Woods and Piper Laurie. It's a movie I will hold dear and one I recommend highly.",1411430400,,260,4.673913043478261
3823090,1,B001VOAB6W,"DVD was delivered promptly. Unfortunately, As I was almost to the end of the movie, the DVD froze and and skipped. I was unable to finish the movie.

I will most likely never buy another DVD from Amazon again. I believed quality control was better at Amazon than this. I am disappointed.

3823095,3,B001VOAB6W,This movie was made in the area where I live so I had more interest in it.  Not the best Garner movie but O.K.,1406937600,,110,3.5833333333333335

3823098,5,B001VOAB6W,"I love James Garner and love James Woods and they absolutely shine in this movie.  What a beautiful story of commitment and family.  Hallmark Hall of Fame always does a terrific job, but this will always be my favorite.",1377734400,3,219,4.589743589743589
3823099,5,B001VOAB6W,"It is a very touching movie.  A choice of bits of humor in differences of life with someone who is more innocent in his thoughts than his brother. He brings a different, but pure input into things like a blue sky.",1373760000,,213,4.195121951219512
3823100,5,B001VOAB6W,"Great movie, delivered as expected. Hard for me to find good entertainment with all the cable channels I have I still find myself watching the movies I just purchased from you and your great sellers. The days of seeing great movies like this one and the others I purchased are long gone, thank you for taking me back to the days when good subject matter was the basis for a movie!",1364515200,,380,4.366197183098592
3823101,5,B001VOAB6W,"What a wonderful movie with great compassion shows the complex issues in taking care of a
special needs relative.  It deserves all the awards it has received.",1363824000,,158,4.851851851851852
3823102,5,B001VOAB6W,"I bought this movie because I have a loved one with symptoms of schizophrenia.  I could clearly identify with James Garner's character who ""didn't have a clue"" how to care for his incapacitated brother, and I ""went through all the motions"" with him as he tried to cope.  And the special feature dealing with how this movie was made was totally fascinating; the script was written around actual interviews with patients in a psychiatric hospital and was riveting, to say the least.  I now have a much deeper understanding of this mental condition and it has helped me as I cope with the family-care situation I am in.  This movie has become part of my permanent collection and I look forward to watching it many times in the future.  The acting is superb and the only downside for me is that the production runs only 98 minutes.  I would love to have seen it continue for another hour!",1363478400,4,884,4.563291139240507
3823103,5,B001VOAB6W,"Comedy duos usually work because of chemistry; the same is true for any movie that includes both James Garner and James Woods. They give performances so natural and compelling that it feels like watching a reality TV show. Mental illness is tackled head on; the character development unfolded by Garner is a testament of how having to deal with it in a loved one is a crushing, life changing experience.",1359676800,5,403,4.771428571428571
3823104,5,B001VOAB6W,"I showed a copy of this program in my psychology class to help students understand characteristics of the disorder that is schizophrenia.  James Garner and James Woods make the situation so realistic and touching one cannot fail to remember this as a life lesson.  In finding this DVD, after years of hoping to find it, I viewed it again with a health professional and again was touched by Bobby and DJ and empathetic for all those affected by this and other disorders.  It is obvious why Promise was an Emmy Award winning program.  Wish Mr. Garner and Mr. Woods could be around for another 40 years making movies!",1354579200,,614,4.657407407407407
3823105,4,B001VOAB6W,"At times I thought this movie was a bit unbelievable, but it started to grow on me the more I continued watching.  It shows the debilitating disease of schizophrenia at it's finest and James Garner thinking he could easily deal with living with his brother who has this mental illness.  Living with schizophrenia is an all consuming task.  The video demonstrated this well.  I'd like to see more movies dealing with this illness.  A Beautiful Mind is one example that I would suggest before I would suggest this movie.  But there are a few valuable scenes to show the frustration of the family member.",1353369600,,601,4.730769230769231
3823106,5,B001VOAB6W,Just wanted to let folks know that this great movie can be purchased directly from Hallmark for $19.95. I would never pay $34.99 for a DVD! what a rip off!,1327622400,,155,4.2
3823107,5,B001VOAB6W,"I watched it very carefully & understand that our lives are not always as tidy as we would like them to be.
This movie is so good that I would recommend it to people because someone knows or lives with a person who is like James Woods.",1324512000,,235,4.0212765957446805
3823108,1,B001VOAB6W,"Even though I purchased this item  in the fall of 2010, I only opened it last week, July 2011, we got half way though the movie and it was all choppy, we had to rewind go forward constantly, so I removed it from my machine, there is an imperfection embedded in the cd, which I feel is the reason for the bad picture. I will have to discard it as it in impossible to really enjoy the movie.  I do not believe this is in any way a reflection on the part of the seller. It  was just my bad luck to buy a damaged cd.",1312243200,,512,3.811320754716981
3823109,4,B001VOAB6W,"The other four reviews had built up my expectations - maybe a little too much.  I'd give Promise 5 stars for the acting, particularly James Woods'.  3 stars for the picture quality, story line, and entertainment value.  Am I glad I bought it?  Yes.  Will I be in a hurry to see it again?  No.",1285286400,,292,4.218181818181818
