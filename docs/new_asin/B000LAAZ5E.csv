8160427,5,B000LAAZ5E,"The Lavender Hill Gang A great old British comedy with a touch of dark. It is the story of a group of bumbling thieves. Close to screwball comedy with a gentle surprise ending.

Hilarious, The Ladykillers occupies a quirky cinematic space halfway between Mary Poppins and Psycho THE LADYKILLERS captures the gloom and grit of London after World War II. Mrs. Wilberforce (aka Mrs. lopsided, who nobody takes seriously) prevails on behalf of all the modern democracies.

This drole 1955 black comedy is from the Ealing Studio. Five diverse oddball criminal types planning a bank robbery rent rooms on a cul-de-sac from an octogenarian widow under the pretext that they are classical musicians. The Ladykillers mocks both the criminals and the authorities with its unlikely octogenarian heroine Mrs ""lop-sided"" Wilberforce.  The heist is carried out despite the pleasantly confused old lady's constant, well-intentioned, and funny interruptions, she gradually realizes her part in it, and justice prevails with lots of giggles. Guiness, sporting a large overbite and flyaway hair, is charmingly devious as the gang leader, but it is the inimitable Katie Johnson who steals the show. She's so likable and convincing, completely inhabiting the role of the befuddled, sweet landlady who is blithely unaware she is surrounded by criminals.  The coup-de-grace is when Mrs. Lopsided tries to return the stolen money to the police.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy classic British comedy.

If you would like to know if these movies are for you, YouTube has both of them in the complete movie.",1470355200,,1589,5.2362204724409445
