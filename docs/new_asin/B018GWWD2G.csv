7548399,1,B018GWWD2G,"Coming from the standpoint of more than 20 years in motion picture/TV technology industry (now retired) this, along with a number of other low budget Atlanta based black movies is terrible.  Even under restricted budget confines, simple professional technology could be better arranged. - The sound (echo) was awful, editing, non-creative, directing, amateurish at best - but the main thing was the poor script.......I couldn't watch this disaster no more than ten minutes without turning it off.",1466035200,3,496,5.441558441558442
7548400,3,B018GWWD2G,"It was okay,  sure didn't think it would have ended the way it did.",1465776000,,67,3.7857142857142856

7548402,4,B018GWWD2G,Bobby & Renee People's never disappoint.  There's passion in everything they create.  So glad I  made this purchase.  Great storyline and choice of actors.,1455235200,,155,5.333333333333333

7548407,3,B018GWWD2G,Amateur actors made it weak but it's still entertaining.,1473292800,,56,5.333333333333333
7548408,2,B018GWWD2G,It was hardly believable. An assassin that lets his guard down this badly?  Really? The writer apparently didn't know much about the psyche of this type. This appears to be a writer/ directoral debut. Some components were amateurish.,1473033600,,233,5.131578947368421
7548409,1,B018GWWD2G,It wasn't interesting or realistic,1472428800,,34,6.0
7548410,3,B018GWWD2G,The Ideal was okay the acting was so so and the editing was poor meaning the scenes jumped around but it wasn't over the top picture could been clearer and for some reason the caption was ahead of the person talking. Bravo though for getting the movie on Amazon.,1471996800,,262,4.36734693877551

7548421,3,B018GWWD2G,"Actually pretty good but it had too little assassin/spy and too much romance. The production values needed work. Particularly audio editing and cinematography, the sound was bad. They even left in some editing text like ""insert building interior shot here"". Acting was pretty good for most of the cast and the fight scenes were believable. I would venture to say Amazon's selection and quality has improved for sure. Give it a shot.",1468972800,,432,5.013888888888889
