3052769,5,B0010X5UH4,"My comments here are for this DVD as well as Silly Songs and Toddler Action Songs.

I'll be honest - I don't see the appeal of this series. (Keep reading - I really do mean to give it 5 stars!)  From a grown-up's perspective it's outdated; it's cheesy; the singing and video aren't always synced; the clothes and costumes are kind of odd; etc., etc.  Had I watched it myself, I wouldn't have thought my son would enjoy it at all.

I would have been SO wrong.

I first saw Toddler Tunes when my friend came over with her almost-two-year-old.  She brought this with her and said it was pretty much the only TV/DVD that would hold her little guy's attention.  She popped it in for him so we could talk and he was mesmerized from the start.  I still didn't think much of it, but my mom got a copy for my son (not quite a year old at the time) for Christmas.  I figured, might as well try it.  The songs are fun and have good messages; if nothing else, it's something I wouldn't feel guilty about him watching. on the rare occasion that I do turn on the TV for him.

Popped it in...same thing.  Mesmerized.  Couldn't take his eyes off the screen.  Still can't almost a year later, although at least now he'll sit and play while he watches.  Sometimes.  ;-)  Same with his little cousins. We have three from the series and they all have the same effect.

Most of the time I don't want him to be glued to the TV, but when I need to cut his nails, or NOTHING is making him happy (welcome to having a toddler), or I have to get dinner and he's trying to climb the stove, these are on standby.

I have NO idea why kids love these, but they do.  I'd get them for any mom with little ones and tell her to grit her teeth and ignore the mime and the person in a giant scary rooster costume that comes down the slide in a song about ducks. (Can't remember which DVD those are from, but you get the point.)  Definitely worth the money!",1354147200,3,1919,4.146341463414634
3052770,5,B0010X5UH4,"My son loves this.  We sing along.  Great enjoyment, songs that one can sing all the day long.  No one does it like Cedarmont.",1352764800,,126,4.166666666666667
3052771,5,B0010X5UH4,"My 2-1/2 yr old can't get enough of this DVD! Song list is excellent. Well worth the nice price! Other kids who have visited our house love it, too.",1338768000,4,148,4.137931034482759
3052772,5,B0010X5UH4,"We received another DVD (Silly Songs) in this collection as a gift last fall and were surprised at just how much our daughter loved watching it.  She was only 18 months old, she lacked the attention-span and had no interest in watching anything when exposed (on a VERY limited basis).  However, this DVD is more like a little musical or watching your child's favorite CD's music videos, she LOVED it!  Because she loved the first one, we purchased this DVD--Toddler Tunes--for her (to add a little variety).

The DVDs offer good, clean/wholesome, upbeat entertainment. Once the DVD begins it plays song after song without any dialogue in between.  Each song features a group of children singing, dancing, or acting out the songs.  While the child actors appear to be a little hokey and over animated at times, it remains completely age-appropriate for such young viewers.  Also, the music has a Christian-base which is one more reason why we like it so much.

These two DVDs are still the only two that will hold our daughter's attention for a long car ride, quiet time at grandma's house, or even just a shower for Mommy on a desperate day!

We'd highly recommend them!!  (We just purchased a third one in the series for her 2nd birthday!)",1332720000,3,1240,4.752336448598131
3052773,5,B0010X5UH4,"Toddler Tunes is a wonderful dvd for my two and a half year old daughter. My wife and I are extremely cautious about what kinds of shows we allow her to see. Nothing violent. No demonstrating disrespect to parents or other figures of authority. No blatant disobedience. No being mean to siblings, friends, animals, other people's belongings. No sensuality. Nothing that would influence her to want to ""grow up too fast"" like most of the more common movies and tv programs for children seem to be leaning to these days.

Toddler Tunes combines Christian based songs with fun, every day childish songs. Examples are ""God made me"", ""Father we thank Thee for the night"", ""Deep and wide"" and ""Row, row, row your boat"", ""The wheels on the bus"", ""London bridge is falling down"". Plus many, many more.

The songs are sung by happy, well behaved, well groomed children. They are wearing costumes for some songs and have on normal children's clothing for others. They are doing silly actions for some songs or just standing, sitting, running and playing for others.

Some reviewers have mentioned the fact that these children are dressed in clothes from the 80s. I don't disagree with them. I do appreciate the childishness of the clothing, however. And I use the word childishness as a positive word. You won't see little girls dressed like teenagers. You won't see revealing clothing. You won't see little boys who are sloppy or dirty. You will see children who look just like they should. Happy children. Innocent and full of wonder for the world around them, and having tons of fun, just like kids should.

I always enjoy watching Toddler Tunes with my daughter, and I love it when she asks me to sing songs from this dvd when I am rocking her before bed time. She often asks my wife and I to fold our hands a certain way when we pray together before meals, just the way the three little girls do in one of the songs on this dvd. I feel comfortable knowing that this dvd is influencing and shaping my daughter, because everything she sees and hears will influence her. It's my job as her parent to help her learn good moral behavior and to develop strong character, and to provide a safe place for her to explore, learn, and have lots of fun. This dvd is definitely conducive to doing this.",1323388800,14,2284,4.632098765432099

I have bought other DVD's for her of sing a longs and they were really annoying and I couldn't bear them. This one is wonderful. She LOVES it. When I put it in she was mesmerized and tries to sing along. The children in the DVD act out the songs so it's fun for the children to watch. The only complaint I have is that the children are wearing clothes from the 1980's and even sporting a walkman but that doesn't bother me. I didn't buy the DVD for fashion but it's funny to see how some of the children are dressed. Do not hesitate. Cedarmont music is exceptional.
