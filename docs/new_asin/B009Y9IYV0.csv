8545197,5,B009Y9IYV0,"An essential view for the serious student of self protection. Mr. Simonet makes a compelling argument, and backs it up with superb evidence. This amazingly simple, yet powerful and adaptable technique deserves your serious consideration.",1437436800,,237,5.8
8545198,4,B009Y9IYV0,"...is one of the best, maybe even the single best, stand alone technique in martial arts or self protection combatives.  Simonet has demonstrated the fine points of training it, and executing it here, and in his other instructional videos.
It allows a simultaneous cover & centerline capture and crash forward.
Affords an opportunity to transition from an initially defensive move to an aggressive offensive counter.",1375315200,,416,5.4
8545199,5,B009Y9IYV0,"I just watched this and as someone who has a large library of Martial Arts/Self Defense both armed and unarmed DVD collection, I have to say this one is good for people who have had significant training and for the relative newcomer.  Its basically going over how to handle the most common type of scenario by using simple, easy to understand and functional techniques.  Actually one really basic concept that the practicioner can build on and work off of and apply to their own style.  Those with training will find this useful for training and teaching.  Someone who has no formal instruction would be advised to find a place that teaches correct applications for striking and moving.
There are no wild claims of ""invincible fighting prowess"" or any such nonsense.  The language used by Sifu Simonet is colorful and apt to be what you will hear in the street.  Its geared for adults.  He also to my great pleasure explains that the application he builds off of is geared to defend against a right handed blow/attack...which is what you can expect to be attacked with in the street over any other attack.  I agree with Sifu Simonet's logic and while I didn't check to confirm that approx 86% of the population is right handed, it does seem right.  And he does say that while less likely, an attack from the other side CAN occur so knowing that you can decide how much training time you should put into it.  Awareness is the key to survival.  If  you train in Self Defense and you would like a good concept to put into your toolbox then I recommend this DVD.  I'm glad I bought it.",1362787200,,1581,4.544169611307421
