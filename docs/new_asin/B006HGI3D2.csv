8498318,2,B006HGI3D2,there was no mention that Ebay is no longer Ebay instead it is Amazon - hard to figure out how to follow the instructions since the CD is obsolete,1407196800,,146,4.068965517241379
8498319,4,B006HGI3D2,I have bought a number of disks from this company. They usually do what they say. The chapters are listed and that is what is on disk. Be warned this is not like a typical DVD. I think It would be better described as a DVD ROM. A menu of chapters run down left side and you can ONLY RUN ON COMPUTER. Product will teach you the basics. If you know very little about ebay then this may be for you. If you have used ebay successsfully before you may already know enough not to justify buying this. It will teach you how to buy and sell on ebay in a very non complicated way.,1339977600,,571,3.973913043478261
