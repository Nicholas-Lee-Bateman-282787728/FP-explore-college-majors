5057323,3,B00768M7XC,"This is a great video and is EXTREMELY educational on the ""business"" of fund raising.  It's great that you delve into the the environmental issues.  But.... there is TONS of research out there linking artificial contraception AND abortion to breast cancer.  You start to go there with discussions on the chemicals being ""estrogenic"" - yet ignore the largest doses of estrogen women take on a regular basis - the pill.  You give figures that show the recent increase of breast cancer from 1 in 22 to 1 in 8 (I believe I have those figures correct) yet ignore that a major change in that time frame was the introduction of the pill in the 60's and Roe v Wade in 1973.  Abortion raises breast cancer risk because of the cell devlopment in the breasts to ready them for nursing is abrubtly and aritificially terminated.  These cells then have a high risk of becoming unnaturally developed cancer cells.  It makes sense if you just think about it.  Now, when a woman naturally miscarries, it's different because her body has CHOSEN to terminate that pregnancy so it also has mechinisms to terminate the lactation development.  Please, I urge you to do some research on this and perhaps film a sequel.  These issues, far from ""freeing"" women are enslaving them to disease and death.  You would do women the world over a tremendous service by exposing these links as well as the others you have already discussed.",1367625600,2,1406,4.721311475409836
5057324,5,B00768M7XC,"I like to thank the author and director for making this splendid documentary because far most I enough of this BS of these greedy corporations misusing one of the most deadliest diseases known to man and woman for centuries compare to AIDS/HIV, all sort of cancers, and many diseases that need to be a cure for all of them. Over the years it made me think if I did the right thing of giving money to a good cause because in my family history we have all sort of cancers including breast cancer and I have seen this pink washing spawn out of control. I have seen millions of dollars been spent on pink ribbons in Houston, Tx on buildings, public transportation, clothing, food, nightclubs, and my goodness there better not be pink ribbon breast cancer condom out there just like the pink ribbon breast cancer birth control pill! I mean, how much money these greedy pigs need. I mean it sick that they have no fear of a disease that will kill not just women in their 30's through beyond, but breast cancer can effect even young women and men in their age from teenage years to beyond their 20's.

I feel sad for the women who march for these corporations who in fact have poison chemicals in their products that we consume everyday that sponsor these events and smile and grin in everyone faces saying, ""We are fighting a good cause to find cure"" BULLS&*T! Yeah, and what good cause is THAT! $20 million dollars not being donate to the actually charities who need to fight and eliminated the disease just like AIDS/HIV and other disease that they grossly say they're trying to find a cure but let alone they have these fancy shig-dig gallas and parties worth more than the donation is pretty flaw. Hell, I know they making the whole HPV disease into a money making machine and stupid Rick Perry was going all the way unconstitutionally in Texas to force parents to make their kids take the shot without seeing if their kids had any symptoms from the doctor. Yeah, straight up corruption!

Once again, thank you for making this film happen!",1362700800,4,2037,4.547683923705722

5057326,5,B00768M7XC,"This is an amazing and detailed documentary and expose on how ""Pink Ribbon"" fundraising money is allocated in the fight against breast cancer.  I would highly recommend it !",1358121600,4,173,4.9655172413793105
5057327,5,B00768M7XC,"The original breast cancer ribbon was not pink. Charlotte Haley designed a salmon-colored ribbon, her plan to attach five to a card in a direct mail campaign calling attention to the fact that only five percent of the National Cancer Institute budget was spent on prevention of the dreaded illness that had taken women in her family.  As the 2011 documentary PINK RIBBONS, INC. reports, corporations that noticed her campaign could not get Haley to let them use her salmon ribbon, as she understood the conflict of interest of business and public concern.  To legally steal it, they made the ribbon pink (their marketing-recommended color) so they could use the disease to sell cosmetics, cars, fried chicken, and so on.  But the conglomerates did not make their ribbons about prevention, as that would mean they might have to remove carcinogens from their make-up, manufacture non-polluting automobiles, and provide nutritious restaurant food.  They want you to race for the cure, as if cancer is inevitable, like death itself.

At times even the ribbon itself falls by the wayside. The notion of the color pink seems enough to link the fight against cancer to whatever it is a company's selling.

Maybe you see the obvious faster than I do.  Before viewing PINK RIBBONS, INC., all the pink this and pink that got as far as the back of my mind, where I failed to completely articulate the question, ""With all they're spending to promote their support of cancer research, why don't they just send a check instead of telling me I have to buy their yogurt before they'll contribute?""  From now on, I will make a point to avoid supporting profit-driven philanthropy.

5057328,5,B00768M7XC,"I have noticed that more companies and products are associating themselves with the pink ribbon movement.  The video talks about the National Football League which now has the pink ribbon on their website and players are wearing pink.  I watch NFL football and I wondered why would the NFL want to associate themselves with this?  As I predicted, the video mentions that the NFL wants to retain and attract female viewers.  The American Cancer Society is also on the NFL website and has a message for women to get annual screenings and schedule their yearly mammogram in order to reduce their risk.  The video mentions that mammograms emit radiation which could increase the risk of getting breast cancer.  In other words, mammograms could actually be causing breast cancer because even with radiation in low doses, getting mammograms every year increases the exposure to radiation.

Millions of dollars have been spent on trying to find a cure for cancer, including breast cancer.  Did you know that only 15% of all the money that is raised for breast cancer goes to research and prevention?  This fact was in the video.  Where does the other 85% go?  I know that money has to be spent on salaries and advertising, but people assume that most of the money would go to the cause.  In the video, you will see women running races for the cure and cheering at the end of the race when they hear the announcement of the money that was raised in that race, but they do not know what percentage is really spent on research and prevention.

The video mentions about KFC which ran its ""Bucket for the Cure"" campaign in which 50 cents is donated to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure breast cancer fund for every bucket sold.  Komen claimed that KFC was introducing its grilled chicken which is more healthy than fried.  However, the commercial said that you can buy original (fried) or grilled chicken and the donation would still be given.  I am boycotting any product that uses the pink ribbon, but other people will buy these products because they think it is going to a good cause.

In the video, you will see the woman who invented the ribbon as a way to bring awareness to breast cancer, but her ribbon was more salmon colored than pink.  People liked her ribbon and wanted to use it, but she would not let them because she knew that it would be used for profit.  Lawyers were consulted and the lawyers said to just change the color of the ribbon and that is what they did.  They chose pink because women like pink.  Some women don't like it anymore though, like a woman in the video who feels that this ugly disease of breast cancer which she has should not be portrayed as pretty and cute with a pink ribbon.  It is actually offensive to some women that have breast cancer.

There was a woman in the video that I sympathized with very much.  She was diagnosed as having Stage 4 breast cancer.  She was in a support group with others that had the same diagnosis.  She went to two different doctors and they told her the same thing: that there is no cure for her right now.  Stage 4 is the final stage and it is the most severe.  My grandmother had cancer when I was a child and she was given chemotherapy to treat her cancer.  My family wanted to cure her naturally, but my grandfather believed in doctors, so she continued to get the chemotherapy and she died after getting several treatments.  I was just a child, but I knew that there had to be a better way to treat these diseases.

I recently discovered a video titled Dying to Have Known which is sold on Amazon as well.  This video provides testimonies of people who were cured of cancer by using Gerson therapy.  The medical establishment does not approve of it.  However, they do approve of radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, and drugs and these can come with harmful side effects.  Please watch the Dying to Have Known and Pink Ribbons, Inc. documentaries and then you will know the truth.",1350864000,4,3944,4.546099290780142

Although it could use a bit of editing in some parts, overall it is an outstanding dvd.  There are some very very intelligent professional women in the breast cancer field who speak in this dvd, and what they have to say is deeply disturbing, even shocking. We are being seriously dumbed down and the  breast cancer cure/cause has been hugely commercialized, even hijacked. Not to mention companies involved in the pink ribbon campaign at the same time producing products that cause breast cancer.  Less than 5% of the massive funds collected are spent on prevention, there is no accountability or even organization as to where all these funds go or how they are used ( duplication of studies, repetition etc etc) . In 1940 1 in 22 women could expect to get breast cancer , now it is 1 in 8 women, given all the money that has been thrown at run for the cure etc, there is something very wrong with this picture. this DVD will stay with me a long time.

8510773,5,B00768M7XC,"Very well made documentary about the profiteering that happens on the suffering of breast cancer patients. I was very excited about this film's release as I was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer in 2011 at age 34 and have endured my fair share of pink fatigue and the rah-rah glamorization of the disease. No other deadly illness comes with inundations of the ""just stay positive"" nonsense and offensive sexualization such ""ta-tas"" and ""second base"". This documentary dares to expose the other side of the coin to show that those diagnosed with metastatic disease are offended at the survivor mantra and party-like atmosphere. It also shows that companies who claim to raise money for ""awareness"" (seriously, we are all aware..though not correctly because there is so much misinformation about such a common disease) are some of the same companies that use carcinogens in their products. This film does a very good job of showing what many breast cancer patients feel is a glamorization of their suffering and the creation of a cause marketing darling...without any real benefit to those who are diagnosed (the death rate in the US has remained around the 40,000 per year mark despite billions thrown at the disease). Those featured in the film are the late Barbara Brenner of Breast Cancer Action, breast surgeon Dr. Susan Love, and many others. Highly recommend.",1396224000,2,1375,5.088495575221239
8510774,5,B00768M7XC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The average person would never imagine that the ongoing feel-good Breast Cancer Awareness movement is profoundly wrong-headed, but this is essentially what the controversial and extremely informative documentary, Pink Ribbons, Inc., attempts to impart. Primarily taking on the Susan G. Komen Foundation and its chief executive officer, Nancy Brinker (sister of Susan G. Komen and a breast cancer survivor herself), who are in the forefront of raising money for breast cancer treatment, Director Lea Pool first questions the sincerity of the feel-good pink ribbon campaign.

Brinker defiantly states, ""absolutely not"", in response to the accusation that the Susan G. Komen Foundation and their supporters are putting a ""pretty face"" on breast cancer awareness. But it's interesting that she admits that without a positive spin, they could never attract the vast numbers of supporters that they do. It's understandable that those who promote the positive spin on breast cancer awareness do so as the thought of the reality of the disease, is hard to look at head on. But 'Pink Ribbons, Inc.' suggests that the sugar-coating of the disease, prevents the general public from realizing and ultimately admitting that certain cases may be indeed incurable and others, may be iatrogenic in nature--exacerbated by the traditional treatments breast cancer victims most often undergo. Indeed, the documentary features some enlightening comments from a former surgeon, Dr. Susan Love, critic of traditional ""slash, burn and poison"" treatments.

While the thousands upon thousands who participate in race/walk for the cure events may be well-intentioned, the documentary points out that they're both gullible and take an unquestioning stance as to deleterious corporate involvement in their fund-raising events as well as to where all the research money goes. Indeed, the most compelling argument of the documentary is that corporations exploit cancer for their own gain. By linking themselves to the breast cancer awareness movement, it's the perfect opportunity for corporations to market their products, under the ruse of helping 'fight' this insidious disease.

In certain cases, completely deceptive fund-raising campaigns were designed by these corporations. One example involved American Express-- they agreed to donate one cent when you used your Amex credit card; the fine print made it clear, however, that they donated one cent for the ENTIRE purchase (so if you charged $1,000 to your card, they would still only be donating one cent). Fortunately, activists shut down the campaign through an email campaign of their own. Yoplait Yogurt was also forced to rescind their offer to donate 30 cents for each used Yoplait Yogurt lid mailed back in to the company--after it was discovered that Recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), a synthetic (man-made) hormone that is marketed to dairy farmers to increase milk production and linked to cancer, was used to create the Yoplait product. General Mills, owner of Yoplait, eventually discontinued use of the growth hormone in Yoplait, as a result of another activist campaign against them.

The myopic view of the supporters of the breast cancer awareness movement is reflected in their complete lack of interest in where all the contributions go. The assumption is that the cancer researchers and drug manufacturers 'know what they're doing,' and they should be 'trusted.' The reality is that if the some of the drugs 'work', it's only a matter of extending the life of the breast cancer victim, a few months at best. But of course what is not mentioned, is the quality of life of the 'survivor'. 'Pink Ribbons, Inc.' argues for investment in prevention strategies and research into environment causes, which of course is antithetical to the corporate culture, which is basically out to make a buck.

Major corporate contributors to the breast cancer awareness have products full of carcinogenic ingredients. The Estee Lauder company is singled out particularly for their hypocrisy--promoting their cosmetic products loaded with dangerous chemicals linked to cancer, while at the same time, collecting monies for a 'cure'. Just as garish is Kentucky Fried Chicken whose partnership with Komen appears to be absurd, given that the type of food they sell, is not considered to be at all healthy (Komen defended this particular campaign by arguing that KFC was promoting grilled, not fried chicken).

'Pink Ribbons, Inc.', also delves into the history of breast cancer fund-raising. In fact, Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which began in 1982, was actually introduced by a pharmaceutical company. The original ribbon wasn't pink but salmon-colored and the woman who designed it refused to be bought out after a pharmaceutical company attempted to buy the original design (they circumvented her by simply changing the color to pink).

Ultimately, the co-opting of Breast Cancer awareness and fund-raising by Big Pharma and other corporate entities, is American as apple pie. The value of this documentary is that individuals who watch it, may begin to question whether both the orthodox medical and corporate establishments really have a true interest in helping to prevent the spread of breast cancer. Researching prevention strategies, not finding some kind of illusory 'cure' that lines the pockets of corporate CEOs and their physician minions, really is where a good deal of the money Komen raises, should go. It is unlikely that the majority of people watching this documentary will be swayed, as it is much more comforting to put on a pink ribbon, than take an interest in whether your corporate sponsor is involved for their own profit and to inquire for what purpose your monetary contribution is being utilized.",1383436800,4,5804,5.349397590361446
8510775,5,B00768M7XC,"Excellent, thought provoking movie.  An excellent addition to my business, as well as personal library.  Viewing quality is also good.  I would recommend this movie to anyone whose life has been touched by cancer, either personally, or with friends or family suffering from this disease.",1383350400,,287,5.333333333333333
8510776,4,B00768M7XC,"I think, with a product of this nature, it's important to stay focused on the nucleus of what this is: it's a documentary, plain and simple. No single film/release can cover EVERYTHING about cancer (breast or otherwise), marketing, corporate culture/corruption, non-profits who get into bed with Big Money etc. etc. etc.; it just can't be done. I felt the film lost a tiny bit of its focus later in its flow, but there were alot of unspoken messages that I liked. The excessive amounts of footage of various walk/run events, where one is left wondering, ""What the heck are all these people doing to ""fight"" cancer? They're wearing pink hats. They're running....but so what?"" Showing how many of the Susan G. Komen leaders and accolytes are seemingly just a bunch of Polly Prissy-pants who seem to care more about Estee Lauder swag than fighting (REALLY FIGHTING) to prevent cancer, struck a heavy chord with me.

Two things left me wanting, though: they never asked any women (maybe suffering from Stage 3 cancer, ideally.....just my idea) who were participating in a Susan G. Komen event to discuss for their production what those events meant to them, if anything. That would've added some balance. People tend to adopt the group-think of a certain event's focus, admittedly. A group of people griping about pink teddy bears will ellicit lots of griping about pink teddy bears.......know what I mean? But maybe there are 6 50-something women in Utah who personally love Susan G. Komen and have been touched by that organization's efforts. I also like the idea that ""we used to 'March'! Now, we 'walk'."" I'd have liked to've seen that explored a bit more.......what did cancer/health related activism look like 30 years ago......where is it now, as a movement?  That could be a movie unto itself.

As documentaries go, I liked this. It's worth adding to your doc. library, I can assure you.",1378166400,2,1891,4.903125
8510777,3,B00768M7XC,"(Spoiler Warning!)

Don't get me wrong. This film is definitely worth watching - no doubt. It brings up a lot of great points. There are times when the anecdotal information is truly valuable, such as the sections that provided the members of a Stage IV cancer support group the opportunity to speak about their experiences. I'm very glad that they included the comments of the Stage IV cancer support group, as it provided a much needed perspective.

There are also times in this film where they embark on a ""logic chain"" and they actually see it through to its logical conclusion. One good example is when they're talking about rBST and it's possible link to breast cancer. Then they talk about a certain dairy / yogurt company (which shall remain nameless in this review) donating money to breast cancer research, while continuing to use milk from rBST sources in their products. Fortunately, when this ""dichotomy"" was exposed - and ""dichotomy"" is a polite way to put it - that dairy/yogurt company stopped using rBST dairy products. In that example, they started out with a premise, and saw it through to its logical conclusion.

However, there are a few too many times in this documentary where that doesn't happen, and the anecdote suffers for lack of solid statistical evidence/analysis to support the original premise of the anecdotal point. One example is where they're talking about the lack of coordination among cancer research projects that are being funded by these fundraising organizations. The implication was that there are many studies that are possibly being  needlessly duplicated, while there are other areas of research that could possibly be helpful are underfunded, or not being conducted at all, due to a lack of coordination among the many research labs/pharmaceutical companies/universities/etc. At that point, I expected the documentary to provide a case study, or multiple case studies, listing in more detail, the types of research projects being funded, showing specific examples of the needless duplications among the various research entities. However, that information was not provided. While I'm fairly certain the original premise is probably accurate, without more detailed case studies/statistical analysis to prove the point, it comes off as sounding more like opinion, than actual fact.

In that sense, it inadvertently caused this documentary to suffer from a lack of objectivity in some places. Anecdotes without statistical evidence to support them come off as sounding more like opinions, than actual verifiable facts.

This film spends a lot of time showing footage from various Susan Komen, Avon, and other corporate sponsored fundraising events. While I realize that they were trying to show the organizational power behind these events, it got to the point where those sections looked more like ""emotional film padding"" at the expense of providing more concrete information about some of the premises that they were trying to make. The film would have been better served by reducing the amount of time spent showing these fundraising event footage sections, and using those sections to instead provide the statistical analysis and case studies to support their original anecdotal points.

Please watch this film - it was a brave documentary to make. I think it makes some great points. I just think it could have made some of those points much better by providing more detailed statistical analysis and case studies to support them.",1372550400,4,3481,5.216457960644007
