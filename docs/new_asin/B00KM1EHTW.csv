8659849,5,B00KM1EHTW,"Excellent performances of a series that people in the U. S. know mostly through the efforts of Kenneth Branagh.  There is some overlap in the titles done by Branagh and those done here and it's interesting to see how differently the same stories are handled.  Has English subtitles.

It's material like this that makes owning an all-region player worthwhile.  Plus more than once I found that the English-issued versions much cheaper than the ones released for the U. S. market.",1505347200,,478,4.9375
