4979596,5,B00695E1BY,"The Artist had quite the reputation going for it before it debuted at the Cinema Arts Festival in Houston, Texas. Early reviews were already very positive and many Houston critics were talking about how much they were anticipating getting the chance to see it. I purposely went in blind and only found out just moments before I entered the theater that it was a silent film and was not only shot in but would be presented in the now practically ancient 1.33:1 aspect ratio. A black and white silent feature film made in modern times; what's not to like about that? Truth be told, nothing can really prepare you for how extraordinary The Artist really is.

George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is the king of silent movies in Hollywood in 1927. Audiences just adore everything George is a part of. Along comes Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo) who you just know is going to be a huge star some day. George and Peppy work together on one film as George not only takes her under his wing, but an undeniable spark develops between the two. Over the course of the next few years, silent movies fade into obscurity as talking pictures or ""talkies"" explode onto the scene. George finds himself struggling for not only work, but a purpose to live as Peppy becomes the next big thing overnight.

The Artist is funny and charming right out the gate. Jean Dujardin really plays to the crowd and appears to love nothing more than catering to the people who come to see his films. George's dog Jack might be the biggest form of comic relief in the film. The way he plays dead and covers his head with his paws are always both presented in a way that is fresh and laugh out loud funny each and every time they're utilized. Once Brnice Bejo enters the picture, the film begins to evolve into a type of romance. It's odd though because to my recollection George and Peppy never kiss. Peppy seems to steal the spotlight in the same way George does as soon as you see her dance for the first time. The laughs are there, the charms are there, The Artist has a firm grip on your heart and your attention and never really lets go.

The film eventually begins to get a bit darker though as silent movies wither away and talking pictures take their spot. George's downward spiral is really fantastic to watch. It's mostly due to not only Dujardin's superb performance, but also the way many of these scenes are filmed. There's a scene where George is sitting down at a mirror table drinking whiskey. You see nothing but George, his reflection, and the alcohol. He pours the booze on the tabletop as the look of disgust becomes more chiseled on his brow. That scene is so beyond amazing. The brilliant music used in the film also just captures the time period perfectly. There's also this dream that George has right before he's let go from his contract where he can't speak, but everything around him has sound. That sequence is really spectacular, as well.

The Artist can get a little dark at times, but for the most part is extremely lighthearted and feel-good at its core. Never have I wanted a movie to end on a happy note so badly in my life. Through the highs and the lows of George Valentin and the depressing outcome of his career along with the heartwarming sensation you get from nearly everything in between, the entire experience just feels so real; so genuine. The Artist is just pure perfection, a masterpiece, and an instant classic.",1321228800,145,3414,4.564437194127243
4979597,5,B00695E1BY,"The moment I saw this at the Cannes Film Festival back in May, I knew that this film, ""The Artist,"" would be either an incredible motion picture or a failed attempt at a genre extremely rare in today's movie society. After that thought, I sat down and watched the movie. The first words I blurted out when the film was over was ""Wow!"" I was speechless by this film. For the next few hours, when I was at my hotel room, I just sat down and thought about what I just saw. Overall, what I'm saying is this was a phenomenal motion pciture! I loved it so much, I went to other film festivals just to see it again. And you can bet I'm going to see this when it's in theaters. The acting, the cinematography, the sound, it was all perfect. Now if you don't know by now, ""The Artist"" is a colorless AND silent movie. Yes, silent movie. A word most modern moviegoers do not even comprehend. Even though that might be a turnoff for some, it wasn't for me, as I have seen plenty of silent films. My one problem wih the film is that when it is released in theaters (which will be during the last week of November 2011,) it will have a limited release. And I thought to myself ""Why!?"" Why won't they release this film to everyone, not just certain cities. Oh well. It might have a wide release for one reason- awards. This film has already gathered plenty of film festival awards- and it's just waiting for Golden Globes, Oscars, and other major film awards. I GARUNTEE you that this will be nomianted for the Best Picture Oscar. It's already on my list as one of the best films of the year. Now then, say if you're a future reader (after the 2012 Oscar awards and the DVD is out), I hope it has won (or at least have been nominated) for Best Picture. If you just want to see this movie because it's been nominated for the Oscar and won it (hopefully) then sure. Even if this film isn't nominated for Best Picture (which in my eyes seems impossible) I still highly recommend. I give it a 9.5/10.",1320537600,8,1982,4.259946949602122

If you live in Colorado instead of SC like me, then this would be a trip to watch while smoking weed.  Sort of like listening to Dark Side of the Moon in sync with The Wizard of OZ or watching Heavy Metal cartoons.  It is amazing to me that this would win an Academy Award for the best picture of the year.  What I have been doing lately is watching movies that have either won Best Picture or were damn close and some of them make sense big time:  The Departed and No Country For Old Men and it turned out I really liked Argo and loved The Life of Pi.  Oh well, it didn't cost much and I am on a fact finding mission.  So, unless you are up in Colorado, maybe you want to pass on this one.",1488499200,,823,3.8862275449101795

4979656,1,B00695E1BY,"Overrated fluff that never really goes anywhere. First off, had this film been made in 1927, it would be a mediocre release at best. I applaud it for trying to be different, and being largely a silent film is very daring in today's times. However, being different, and being a silent film does not make it great. Everything about ""The Artist"" is mediocre, from the writing to the acting. It really is nothing special beyond a Novelty. If you're in the mood for a silent film I suggest ""The Kid"", ""The Gold Rush"" or any other silent film for that matter. ""The Artist"" is a lot of fluff, and nothing much more.

4979679,5,B00695E1BY,"The fact that this movie was silent made me watch and enjoy it even more...for change! There were none of that usual and excessive,  unnatural profanity, vulgarity, immorality and glorifying crimes etc. (which has stopped me from going to, or watching most, if not all the movies made since 1950's till now).
Also the fact that the actors in this film had to express themselves with no words, made it even better and more interesting.
You could say it was based on a true story, of course I know of 2 female Stars who had a hard time adjusting to the sound (Talkies) both because of their accents.
The dog was the real star though. But I never got his name? I think he was the Best part. I gave it 5 Stars just for that.
This movie was a breath of fresh air since the Lord of the Ring trilogy (that movie also had not a single dirty word in it). So ""The Artist"" can be watched and enjoyed by the whole family (except for couple of scenes, 1 the girl pulling up her skirt and 2 men dancing a tango which was unnecessary and dumb).

One note... I watched this with CC on and I think the people who did the Closed Caption did an extraordinary job for the deaf (as well as for the hearing) since I had no idea that there were so many different kinds of music etc. Some words I had to look up! (English is my 2nd language). Very nice CC indeed.
Anyway I think if Charlie Chaplin was alive today he would also praise this film. The street scenes the people the clothes the cars etc. They took great pains...and the fact that some of these places shot in this film, were the same as Chaplin used for his great movie, ""The Kid"".

They make a big deal about the dog in this movie, the dog is amazing all things said... the dog was funny and added to the story, but the dog isn't super critical to the story.

4979718,5,B00695E1BY,"I saw this film for the first time earlier tonight on TCM. Bless them for that!!  I first became aware of it a few years ago  via a friend who'd just seen it and told me it was excellent. When I learned it was a silent I tuned out and promptly completely forgot about it . MY LOSS!  The only silents that ever really interested me were the Chaplin gems and his full-length feature ""City lights"" which i've long considered to be one of the three greatest films of all-time and which I see as the very likely inspiration for this film as the plots bear a close relationship. Had ""City Lights"" been a ""talkie"" or shot in color it would mot have the impact it has in its original state.  In that vein, 'The Artist"" may very well be a near equal or actually equal to  ""City Lights"" in quality, artistry and impact on the viewer. Only one thing about this film mystifies me, part of he music score. At approximately 88 minutes running time the music becomes quite dramatic and romantic and VERY familiar. It is very similar to, if not actually note  for note identical in parts to what I would call the Love Theme"" in Vertigo by composer Bernard Herrmann.  I'm sure that's not the title of that music cue  but it's an apt description of the Vertigo music  which i haven't the time or inclination to look up at the moment. But trust me, as a musician, if that music cue were played for me sans picture I would bet it all that it was Vertigo.  (See my addenda concerning this mystery below) This detracts nothing from the film but the similarity really struck and amazed me. The film is absolutely magnificent and the casting of the five leads (including the Jack-Russel terrier which I suspect is related to Fraiser's pooch, Eddie) is beyond perfect). I am about to order the DVD having been totally enthralled by this superb film and especially the two stars.
ADDENDA: It's a couple of days since I composed this review and I;'ve just learned from Wikipedia's page on the film that the music in question is indeed Bernard Herrmann's ""Scene D'amour""  from Vertigo. Unless I overlooked it  there was no mention of this in the film's credits. Now I feel better.",1459382400,2,2152,4.461734693877551

4979785,5,B00695E1BY,"The Artist

 I think the large wad of skepticism that I had in my heart when I entered the theater to see the Artist was entirely justified.  We have been watching films with audible dialog for some 80 years now, why would we regress to a silent film?  The Artist has been nominated for ten academy awards.  Something is going on that we don't understand until we see what is on the screen.  This is a wonderful film, a film so extraordinary that it reaches the exalted status of other five saw blade, top of the heap films.
 What might at first seem like a stunt or an extravagance, that is producing a silent film in black and white in this day of digital magic, turns out to be not just substantive and justified but correct in every way.  Who'd a thunk it.  The story spun out in the film is of a dashing actor of the silent era who cannot cope with the changing film industry and the woman who used to love him and the one who loves him still.  A love story between a falcon with a broken wing and the great hearted woman who is his salvation.  A tried and true tale, familiar and comforting-and often enough true, as we know from the people we know or the people we are.
 Now imagine that we are denied half of the audio visual experience that it is our custom to absorb.  The immediate result is that we must focus our attention precisely on the screen, or we miss something important.  This alone changes the movie experience in a decided and dramatic way.  We are, willingly or not, intensely involved the the movie in a surprisingly unique way.  Bravo,, the idea of a black and white silent film has merit after-all.
 The acting must be of the best quality to pull this off, and it is.  Both Jean Dujardin as the silent screen move idol and Berenice Bejo as his love interest have been nominated for best actor and best actress, respectively.  I will be mush surprised if Bejo does not end up with an Oscar and it is possible that both of them will receive the award.  It takes amazing control and talent to convincingly portray a role without being able to use your own voice.  And Miss Bejo is one of those rare actors that simply light up the screen.
 The film is also nominated for best picture and seven other awards.  It is rated PG 13 and runs one hour and 40 minutes.  This is a must see film, so go see it.  And it is making money with a budget of only $15 million and a world wide take of $47 million, which is sure to get much larger.  I left smiling and so will you.",1437264000,,2488,4.218220338983051

4979789,3,B00695E1BY,"Some reviewers have called this movie pretentious. I, however, never got the impression that it tried to convey any deep meaning, or make the protagonist some tragic hero. It was ""artsy"" in its use of black and white photography, old movie clichs, dialog panels, etc. to convey the era. But I got the idea that this was meant to show that the protagonist was only able to work in that medium and was unable to do things the new way (as indicated by the dream sequence where suddenly the world makes noise but he still cannot vocalize.) The protagonist is somewhat sympathetic, but is it any fault other than his own he cannot make the transition to sound movies? Does his wife get the blame for his failed marriage? He ends up relying on others (including his dog) to save him from his problems.

The story could have been told as a conventional movie with color and sound. But the idea was to deliberately produce it as it was, more as a novelty than a great story, and the movie's novelty value was undoubtedly the reason it has garnered acclaim. It was certainly better than Mel Brooks' ""Silent Movie"".",1435708800,,1105,4.552763819095477

4979807,5,B00695E1BY,"The Artist is a romantic comedy drama in the style of a black-and-white silent film. It was written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius. It stars Jean Dujardin and Brnice Bejo together with John Goodman,James Cromwell,Missi Pyle,Penelope Ann Miller and Malcolm McDowell. The story takes place in Hollywood, between 1927 and 1932, and focuses on the relationship of an older silent film star and a rising young actress as silent cinema falls out of fashion and is replaced by the ""talkies"".

In 1927, silent film star George Valentin is posing for pictures outside the premiere of his latest hit film, A Russian Affair, when a young woman, Peppy Miller, accidentally bumps into him. Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of Variety with the headline ""Who's That Girl?"" Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin ,Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles. Two years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment, but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film as well as the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Now Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.

One could spend hours talking about how fantastic The Artist is; how sublime Dujardin and Brnice Bejo are; how natural their movements and expressions are; how perfect the score is so expressive and lively and jovial and magical. This is the definitive example of great that, it's essentially a tribute to black and white silent films.",1433721600,2,2378,4.972361809045226

FILM FACT Part Two: On 9th January 2012, actress Kim Novak stated that ""rape"" had been committed in regard to the musical score by Ludovic Bource, which incorporates a portion of Bernard Herrmann's score from Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo (in which Novak had starred). In the article published, by Variety, she stated that ""I feel as if my body or at least my body of work has been violated by the movie."" ""This film should've been able to stand on its own without depending on Bernard Herrmann's score from Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' to provide more drama"" and that ""It is morally wrong for the artistry of our industry to use and abuse famous pieces of work to gain attention and applause for other than what they were intended,"" ending her comments with ""Shame on them!"" In response, director Hazanavicius released a statement: THE ARTIST was made as a love letter to cinema, and grew out of my and all of my cast and crews, admiration and respect for movies throughout history. It was inspired by the work of Hitchcock, Lang, Ford, Lubitsch, Murnau and Wilder. I love Bernard Herrmann and his music has been used in many different films and Im very pleased to have it in mine. I respect Kim Novak greatly and Im sorry to hear she disagrees.""

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: `THE ARTIST' was both directed and written by Michel Hazanavicius. It's set in Hollywood during 1927 during the silent film era and the main character is a silent film movie star by the name of George Valentine [Jean Dejardin]. As the film starts out us the audience are treated to some footage from one of his films and the reaction by an audience in a theatre during the premier. Backstage the star, George, is watching and listening along with the head of the studio Al Zimmer [John Goodman] to the reaction from the audience. It's a hit and the audience loves it. After the film ends George Valentine comes out, along with his canine co-star Uggie [Jack the dog], to take a bow and thank the audience. His other co-star Constance [Missi Pyle] is absolutely furious that he chose to bring the dog out with him instead of her. Eventually the head of the studio sends her out onstage to join George Valentine. She gives some very unkind words to the star and takes her bow and thanks the audience; only to be sent offstage. George Valentine remains onstage with his canine co-star and eventually takes an exit stage left only to come back out as the audience is giving him a standing ovation of sorts. It's obvious from what we see here that this guy is perhaps the most popular silent film star at this point in Hollywood. He's at the peak of his career and loving it. He has such wonderful charisma and a great smile that it seems the world is his and sure to stay his for a good while to come.

After the premier of the film George Valentine exits the theatre and poses for photos from the members of the press while beautiful young ladies with their autograph books are giddy at the sight of the star and are being held back by police officers. One young lady in that crowd ends up dropping what appears to be her autograph booklet and bends down to pick it up yet manages to end up making it through the police officer holding her and the other ladies back. She bumps right into the silent film sensation that is George Valentine. At first it's very awkward not only between George Valentine and her but also to the members of the press whose jaws almost drop. Eventually George Valentine plays it off and his blank stare turns to a very encouraging smile. The young lady is relieved and she smiles and tries to play along with the moment. The members of the press ask for the two to pose for some photographs, which they do. She decides to plant a kiss on the side of George Valentine's cheek and that photo ends up on the front page of the trade magazine Variety the very next day with the headline ""Who's That Girl"" the thought on everyone's mind; especially the audience at this point. We see the very next day George Valentine wake up and come to breakfast with his wife Doris [Penelope Ann Miller] who happens to be reading that trade magazine and doesn't seem too pleased by the photo. It's obvious these two have some marital issues but George Valentine just tries to play it off with his charisma and wonderful sense of physical humour by dipping his nose into his breakfast and sitting there with an innocent look on his face.

The young lady who ended up breaking out of the crowd the night before and posed for the pictures is named Peppy Miller [Brnice Bejo]. She's absolutely excited that she's on the front page of Variety with that headline aimed at her. She decides this is the best time if any to try her hand at becoming an actress so she shows up the very next day to Kinograph Studios, the studio where George Valentine does his films. Peppy Miller sits down to wait for the chance to be an extra. She sits down next to a man who is The Butler [Malcolm McDowell] and show's him the trade paper with her picture on the front page. The Butler flips the trade paper over and runs his hand across the headline questioning who she is, if to emphasize she's going to have to do a lot more than that to make it in Hollywood. Peppy Miller takes his gesture in stride and eventually gets the chance to go up in front of a casting guy who's looking for three girls who can dance. The first two girls standing beside her immediately begin to dance and he tells them they have the parts as extras. Peppy is next up and he asks her if she can dance to which she replies physically with one very energetic dance and irresistible facial gestures. The guy casting the parts of extras is simply blown away and all smiles. Even though there's no dialogue shown in text we can tell she gets the part as she begins to physically celebrate. She turns back to the man she had shown the trade paper to earlier and tells him her name; as if to tell him he should remember it as he's going to be hearing a lot of it in the future. The girl has spunk; you can tell that much and she is destined for great things. Her first film she's featured in as an extra involves her dancing alongside her hero George Valentine. The two have chemistry both onscreen and off-screen but the fact he's married causes some real complications as you'd imagine. Yet the two become friends and he even gives her some tips on how to become a famous actress.

As I mentioned earlier silent film star George Valentine seems to be at the peak of his career but something happens one day in 1929, which is two years after the beginning of the film that changes things majorly in his life. After he's finished shooting a scene for his latest film the head of the studio asks George to come see something. He takes him into a dark screening room with other studio members where he shows him footage of what will later become known as the ""talkies"" film that feature actual audio dialogue recordings. George Valentine watches but after the screening is over he gets up and laughs and attempts to leave the room. Before he can leave the screening room the head of the studio tells him not to laugh because it's the future, to which George replies along the lines of saying that if that's the future he can have it. This seems to be the beginning of the end for George's career as he refuses to do ""talkies"" and when the studio decides to halt production on all silent films. He's absolutely heartbroken but he doesn't give up. He has encouragement and support from his chauffeur and friend Clifton [James Cromwell] who refuses to leave his side. Meanwhile, Peppy Miller has been working her way up from being just an extra in various films all the way to co-starring and starring roles in silent films. She's eventually picked to be one of the new faces of Kinograph Studios in their transition to ""talkies"" and soon becomes a star of the silver screen. It seems that a complete reversal here has happened with George Valentine being let go from the studio and her rising to fame. What happens here after this point you'll have to watch the film to see. As I won't spoil that as it's a very amazing film with lots of emotion, rough history regarding silent films demise, Hollywood's transition to ""talkies"" and a very nice bit of both comedy and romance thrown in as well.

As was often the case in those days, the cast of THE ARTIST includes actors with many different native tongues, because what difference did it make? John Goodman makes a bombastic studio head, and such familiar faces as James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle and Ed Lauter turn up.

Jean Dujardin is well-known in France, especially as I have seen him in a successful series of spoof comedy films entitled OSS 117, which you will see I have done a Blu-ray Review on both films released on Blu-ray and are fantastic, where you will see a Jean Dujardin as a Gallic secret agent who mixes elements of 007 and Inspector Clouseau. He would indeed have made a great silent star. His face is almost too open and expressive for sound, except comedy. As Norma Desmond, the proud silent star in Sunset Boulevard, hisses: ""We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!"" Jean Dujardin's face serves perfectly for the purposes here. More than some silent actors, he can play subtle as well as broad, and that allows him to negotiate the hazards of some unbridled melodrama at the end. I felt a great affection for him.

I've seen THE ARTIST' about three times so far, and each time it was applauded, perhaps because the audience was surprised at itself for liking it so much. It's good for holiday time, speaking to all ages in a universal language. Silent films can weave a unique enchantment. During a good one, I fall into a reverie, an encompassing absorption that drops me out of time. While it's an impressive achievement, and clearly a labour of love on behalf of the writer and director Michel Hazavanicius, as well as being love letter to Hollywood.

I love black and white films, which some people assume they will not like at all, but should give them a chance. For me, it's more stylised and less realistic than colour, more dreamlike, more concerned with essences than details. That said, creating a silent movie for a modern audience is a bold move, and the film has been executed with aplomb. `The Artist' represents moviemaking as it once was without most of today's tools, and while it looks and sounds and feels different, its proof positive that a film is still a film by and through any fad or trend or technology. It's the story of two people moving artistically apart but in other ways together as all they've known changes for the better or for the worse. It's a tale of acceptance, moving forward, and honouring the past rather than unrealistically and stubbornly championing and clinging to it.

Blu-ray Video Quality  On this release is in full stunning 1080p encoded Black-and-White image in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio. According to the technical specifications on IMDb, this was shot on Super 35mm film using the PanArri 435 ES and Panavision Super Speed MKII cameras. In fact, here is a very interesting article with the Director of Photography Guillaume Schiffman discussing his cinematography work and those cameras he used. An interesting fact here is the film was actually shot at 22 frames per second and then turned to the traditional 24 frames per second to give the effect of movement from the old silent film era. Another few interesting facts here for you regarding how the film was shot, because it was actually shot on traditional Kodak colour film and then was turned to Black & White in post-production. Also, the DP mentions that he went to Panavision and asked for some older lenses to use to give the film the older visual style. This turns out really beautiful and is a total ""throwback"" to the days of silent films. The only difference here in comparison to original silent films from the era the film takes place in is that you get one hell of a lot more clarity here because they used Super 35mm film. This has an absolute amazing abundance of detail throughout the film, especially in those close-ups of the two main characters. It looks totally stunning and also beautiful image in Hi-Definition and earns a perfect ""5 Star Rating"" for overall video quality. It's no wonder it was nominated for an Academy Awards for Best Achievement in Cinematography. But what I can tell you that this French Prestige Special dition Blu-ray, the Black-and-White image is far superior to the normal English Blu-ray edition, which I have, and something I can confirm the difference and the French Prestige Special dition Blu-ray will have you speechless when you view the awesome 1080p Black-and-White stunning image. But of course with this French Blu-ray, sadly all the word panels informing what is being spoken are in French, but despite this, it is still worth getting the French Prestige Special dition Blu-ray disc, as you will again experience totally awesome stunning images that will take your breath away. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  On this release is presented in an awesome 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. You might first ask yourself why a silent film would need a 5.1 mix and the answer to that has a whole lot to do with the film's original music score done by Ludovic Bource. Also, sure it's a throwback to the way old silent films were presented but this is a lot more unique than any of those classic silent films. The reason for that is that this film was mixed with a 5.1 Surround mix in mind, unlike the films back then that were a Mono mix with a single speaker in mind. You get a musical presentation here that almost entirely carries the film throughout with a few exceptions. There's an excellent amount of rear channel presence and bass as well at times. The music here ranges from upbeat to subtle mellow, to downright intense. The musical instruments here are what really make the most emphasis on bass via the subwoofer; namely the percussion instruments. The intense musical parts are the main moments when the amount of sound is at its peak and is sure to get your attention and set the mood perfectly for what's happening in the film. The fact there's no pauses for dialogue here means that there's almost constantly music playing to accompany the visuals and text that displays key dialogue. There are some exceptions where for instance there will be short pauses in between musical numbers where you'll get a few seconds of silence. There's also a point around 30 minutes in the film where it turns first to total silence for a short bit and is then followed by nothing but sound effects. Here you'll hear strong emphasis on every single noise happening around the main character. This is a very intense sequence and like the intense musical moments grabs your attention and sets the mood of the film perfectly. Shortly after this sound effects sequence there's roughly a good 30 seconds or so of silence before the music starts back. The sequence itself lasts roughly around 3 minute's total. That's one of the few exceptions that I mentioned earlier where the original music doesn't entirely carry the film. All and all the sound mix is downright impressive, even though roughly 98% of the original score is heard. It sounds absolutely beautiful and is mixed wonderfully in a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio configuration as well as makes definite use of the audio format to great effect. This may upset some of you, but I totally stand behind this decision. I give this a very impressive ""5 Star Rating"" for overall audio quality. Gripe all you like about it only being a silent film, but the sound, namely the music, plays a very, very important role here and is almost a character itself in the film. Ludovic Bource`s original score is done complete and utter justice and is a downright pleasure to hear it in the 5.1 audio sound mix.

Special Feature: Recording the soundtrack session in Brussels  interview with Ludovic Bource [2012] [1080p] [15:41] In the silent film THE ARTIST' by Michel Hazavanicius, he talks about how the music plays a vital role. It was in the recording studio composer Ludovic Bource speaks generously from this experience, working with the Brussels Philharmonic of Flanders. He also talks about love he has with the relationship with the cinematic image and my musical identity is a contemporary romance. Yet today when I listen to the music of THE ARTIST,' and I compare my work on two OSS 117, who are also orchestral although very different, I sense an evolution. But this experience is still very much alive and I need to step back and analyse my work. He also talks about how to convey emotion; music globally in replacing dialogue and provides a form of balance between the images and they. I was able to express through music the images that we could not show. [French only]

Finally, 'THE ARTIST' is a truly moving and beautiful film that celebrates and recreates the magic of silent cinema era and the performances, cinematography, and dramatic is very enjoyable and entertaining. Still, though it may be familiar, like an old favourite song, it is well worth and view and listen. The picture yields exceptional stunning performances and a totally faultless throwback appearance, plus the video and audio are both equally in a stunning presentation and giving a respectful and authentic experience. Supplements offer an informative and entertaining peek into the film's production, but as I say the whole package is in French, but it is still worth purchasing. Its Best Picture win was justified, but there is no denying that 'THE ARTIST' is a very good film, and thankfully this disc does it justice. It's in every way a film about the films in transition should be, and `THE ARTIST' is one of the year's finest pictures. Warner Bros. Pictures France Blu-ray release of THE ARTIST' features again stunning video and audio presentation, plus several supplements are included. But the main reason I purchased this French Special dition Prestige Blu-ray, is because to see the awesome embossed packaging is out of this world, as it is gate folded that is printed in stunning Black-and-White, with a hint of colour. But another bonus is that it holds all of the three discs, which include the Blu-ray disc, the DVD disc and on top of all that you get the extra added Bonus of the Original Soundtrack Compact Disc. Sadly seeing the actual photo on the Amazon web page does not really does it justice. Very Highly Recommended!

The movie and Blu-Ray disc is magnificent and five stars.  --  The ""UltraViolet Digital Copy"" is actually an iTunes-only digital download.  To top it off, when I tried to download it from the iTunes Store I got the following message: ""This code is only valid for customers of the Canada store.""  Not being in Canada, there is no digital download for residents of the United States.

Update: I contacted Amazon Customer Service.  I didn't realize I was buying it from ""Sunday River"".  I thought this Blu-Ray was from Amazon.  Anyways, Amazon.com is contacting Sunday River to get this taken care of.  I will update this review after I find out whether or not Sunday River will get me an Ultraviolet code that works in the United States.  I suspect that Sunday River sent me the Canadian Blu-Ray of The Artist.  Canadian Blu-Rays and DVDs work fine in US Blu-Ray players.  But I guess that does not apply to Canadian iTunes purchases.  I find iTunes to be problematic.  Not an Apple fan.  I prefer my digital movies on Vudu or Flixter.

Update on 26 Oct 2014: 15 days since the last update and I have not heard from the vendor, Sunday River, or from Amazon.  I'm changing my rating from 2 stars to 1 star.  Still no Ultraviolet Digital Copy for United States residents.  If you live in the United States and you want the Ultraviolet Digital Copy, do not purchase The Artist Blu-Ray from Sunday River.",1412985600,,1454,4.627450980392157

4979868,4,B00695E1BY,"In this age of computer generated imagery, of elaborate sets and high celebrity payrolls, it
is good to see films that stick to the basics of sound storytelling, superb acting, and
beautiful cinematography. A new film called The Artist not only sticks to those basics,
but to the fundamentals of filmmaking in its most rudimentary format. The Artist is a
silent film. Yes, you heard me correctly, it is not a talkieand it is as captivating and
endearing a film as you will see in theaters today.

The Artist tells the story of silent film star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin)
and a young protg he helps to discover named Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo).
The time was 1927 Hollywood (then the town was called Hollywoodland), and the
talkies were the latest rage. Valentin refuses to have any part of the new format, while
Peppy uses same to become a rising star. The two cross paths many times as she is on the
rise and he falling in a miserable descent.

This is a story that could only be properly told on film. Its subtly, charm, and nuance
needs to be captured in well-planned close-ups and high concept sequences. The two stars
are wonderfully expressive and deliver performances in silence that beat many of todays
talkies (even the ones up for awards).

The supporting cast in this film deserves recognition as well. We all know John
Goodman, who plays the producer at Kinograph Studio. Even in silence, he plays his
gruff, barking studio executive perfectly. And while you may not know his name, James
Cromwell is one of the most beloved character actors of our time. He plays Valentins
limo driver Clifton.

As far as tributes go, this movie does more to capture the essence of early filmmaking
than Hugo, a very good work this year from Martin Scorsese (visit capemayfilm.org for a
review). So many predictions are surfacing about how The Artist will sweep the Oscars
this year that you almost feel like they're a jinx. And while Im not the biggest fan of the
Golden Globes, this film has topped the nominations including one for Best Movie in the
Comedy/Musical category (and unlike My Week with Marilyn, it actually belongs in this
section). Suffice it to say you will likely see this films title all over Oscar nightall well
deserved.",1408406400,,2263,4.7360406091370555

4979879,2,B00695E1BY,"Forget making a mere black and white today - it takes real bravado to make a silent film for the mainstream market. The last time anyone tried this was Maya Deren with ""Meshes of the Afternoon,"" and that was hardly mainstream - it was necessity. There was simply no budget for sound.

But ""The Artist"" isn't an attempt to return to an older art form, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raging-Bull/dp/B00HQ1DSKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raging Bull</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Elephant-Man/dp/B008Q08GHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Elephant Man</a>&nbsp;were in 1980: serious films that stripped away the inessential to arrive at an artistic purity. ""The Artist"" is the opposite - no purity at all, just a celebration of the most trivial and unimportant aspects of the silent era. Black and white never really went away, but the ""talkies"" replaced silent film completely. Reviving the form without attempting to say something new and fresh renders it nothing more than a gimmick.

The subject of this film - the historical moment when silent film gave way to sound - gives ""The Artist"" some big shoes to fill; that is,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singin-in-the-Rain/dp/B0090XLDKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singin' in the Rain</a>, which covered much of the same ground. ""The Artist"" is a meta-film, a film about film, which is made clear to us in the opening scene, which starts off as a regular movie, but is quickly revealed to be a movie within the main movie, starring the main character. The comparison ends there. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a classic, and for good reason - its jaw-dropping dance sequences are unique and unforgettable. It's also tightly constructed, as movies of that period were, without a second of wasted time or pointless dialog. ""The Artist,"" on the other hand, aside from the short scene where Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are dancing on opposite sides of a scrim, lacks the cleverness and element of surprise of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and would have benefitted from having 15-20 minutes edited out. Despite the actors' meticulous preparation, the final dance scene, while technically perfect and superficially appealing, falls flat emotionally. Dujardin is almost too perfect for the role, never losing his pencil-stripe moustache even on skid row, while Bejo looks a little too ""modern"" for a film taking place in the late 20s to early 30s. At one point, she mouths ""oh my God,"" which I doubt was ever spoken by anyone prior to 1970. Even casting Christina Ricci would have been better. Dujardin's moustache uncomfortably reminded me of the creepy man with the little boy on the park bench in the Diane Arbus photo.

Observant viewers may notice a few amusing details in the credit montages documenting Peppy Miller's rise to stardom. In the first, where she plays a maid, the actor playing ""Mr. Rogers"" is ""Jack Offman,"" and in the baseball movie, ""Jackie Cooler"" plays ""The Fridge."" In the one where a dog is played by ""Uggie"" (one of the three dogs that played Valentin's dog in the film), someone is credited as ""The Petter."" This sort of thing is great fun, along with the observation that Miller's house in the film is the real Pickfair mansion, and the bed Valentin recuperates on was Mary Pickford's actual bed. Other gimmicks, like the 1.33:1 aspect ratio and the lack of zoom (a recreation of the ""historical"" details) seem arbitrary in that we are still required to make believe that a film everyone knows was made in 2012 is a silent film not just about, but made in the silent era.

I'm evidently in the minority, as the academy went gaga over this silliness, which if nothing else demonstrates the hunger people have for something different but unthreatening. For example, nobody liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Serious-Man/dp/B00336C3EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Serious Man</a>, not even most Coen Brothers fans - and that film was about the meaning of life itself. Someone was bound to make ""The Artist"" eventually, and now that we've gotten it out of the way, we can move on and forget about it.

Yet another film recommended for those who have committed to seeing every film ever made, or, like myself, missed this in the theater and had to see it because it's ""significant."" Save yourself some time - it's not.",1402790400,2,4479,5.448126801152738

Its a silent movie but they added the sprawling music that the audience hears and for me, that added a huge factor to the film. The music was beautifully paired to the action and they chose a great selection from the golden days. The storyline itself is quite simple: George Valentin is a big time silent star and meets Peppy one day and she was an extra on a film of his and they have an attraction to each other. Then talking movies come and Valentin is out of the job while Peppy becomes a big star. The Depression worsens Valentins plight and he ends up penniless and loses his wife. All he has left is his dog, a companion that was also featured in his films. Peppy goes to see him in the hospital when he attempts to take his own life and they fall in love. Eventually she gets him back in the business. The End.

Silent movies are traditionally pretty simple in story since everything is dictated by the acting. Peppy is luminous in her role and her vivacious smile, and coquettish glances warms the cockles of my heart. I really enjoyed this one.",1392595200,,1192,4.321428571428571

The trailers were for R-rated movies and showed bits I don't approve.  I want my children to watch the movie and do not appreciate having those commercials spoiling the environment.  The Artist is PG-13 and since it IS, why can't the trailers be for PG-13 movies, or best of all, leave them off completely.

Second problem was authenticity.  It isn't hard to look up the model of a firearm and see when it first came into production.  Why not have period appropriate firearms?  Both the rifle and the revolver were mistakes.

Third problem was the fire.  The apartment after the fire (and presumably water damage) was very good looking, unbelievable.  Ok - the whole film is a kind of fantasy, and maybe it was an homage to something I failed to recognize.

Love the fun, playful spirit that runs throughout.  Music was wonderful and each instrumentalist got credited.  Fantastic!!!  Impressed with the staircase scenes.  Learned to like the way we got to fill in what we thought was being said.  Even loved the font and look of the title cards.  All of the characters were a great group to watch, including those in the background.  Everyone was extra lively and made the film special.  Especially admired the $15 million budget.

It would be easy to dismiss it as an amusing stunt, but director Michel Hazanaviciuss hand is so sure and his actors are so engaging that the movie deservedly won an Oscar for best picture. We are in 1927 and George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), the artist of the title, is a leading man of the silent cinema who is about to hit it tough when talking movies arrive. Brnice Bejo (an Argentine born actress who is married to Hazanavicius in real life) is the perky, spunky Peppy, an irresistible starlet who rises at the same time that Valentin falls. Also costarring are John Goodman as a Hollywood mogul and James Cromwell as George Valentins butler (they are all very fine). The authentic Los Angeles locations, the reconstruction of the 1920s and the extraordinary photography help a lot.  My only complaint, is that the happy ending seems quite weak, a bit of a concession to the public, given what went on before, though, of course, a sad ending would probably be even more disappointing.",1388880000,,1109,4.658163265306122

Given that the film takes place in Hollywood during the transition from silent films to talkies, making the movie as a silent film was an effective choice.",1387843200,,507,4.872093023255814

4979914,5,B00695E1BY,"Wow!  A black & white silent film being made in the 21st century, and it's really, really good!  If you've seen the Oscars, you know it's won several prizes.  Jean Dujardin mostly plays comedy roles in French movies now, one of which was OSS 177: Cairo Nest of Spies directed by the same director as The Artist and with the same main actress whose first name I forget but whose last name is Bujo.  She and the director are married.  As the movie is silent, it doesn't matter that Dujardin's English is atrocious.",1385683200,,512,4.462365591397849
4979915,5,B00695E1BY,"An excellent, caring, deeply nostalgic look at the changing of the guard in 1930s Hollywood. Though the primary narrative focuses on the shift from silent film to full-blown ""talkies,"" The Artist serves as metaphor for so much more. Truly, every generation endures this brand of major tidal shift, with the forward-thinkers rewarded for their daring while those set in their ways are swiftly discarded and forgotten. Presented as a silent film itself, the production delights in toying with its audience, no sooner establishing its own rules before testing and bending them. While the cue cards and light accompanying score are, initially, something of a distraction, as the film moves along it becomes remarkable just how restrained and appropriate they both become. Perhaps my greatest surprise wasn't that nothing was said, but that nothing needed to be. Costars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, both duly recognized by the academy for their roles, spill chapters with their bodies, expertly overcoming the potential handicap of the format and running full-bore with the premise. They sparkle, both together and apart, in two very different roles, and are essential players in nudging the finished product from ""good idea"" to ""borderline classic.""",1385510400,,1250,5.38265306122449

The Artist is just a lovely movie.  The dog deserves an Oscar.  This is a rare film because it's entertaining, it's fun, and it's safe for the whole family.  I have started buying French films because they are so good at telling a story, and being funny or romantic without being sophmoric and slutty.

The fact that there's no sound initially threw me, as I'm 28 and I had never seen a silent film before, but when I watched it, I was genuinely surprised at how easy it was to follow the story.  Jean Dujardin is amazing in it.  What's funny is as I understand it, he's kind of a nobody from European TV.  Clearly he needs to make some more films, since this one was so good.

The scene where the butler, who is an elderly gentleman, is dutifully preparing him dinner in his apartment frankly makes my skin crawl. He still calls him ""sir"".

4979970,3,B00695E1BY,"Pros: Obviously, a 1920's-style silent film is going to depend even more upon its acting than your average modern movie, as it doesn't have the benefits of advanced visual effects, sound effects, Technicolor, or, you know, dialogue to flesh out a story. That being said, this movie did a great job of casting the leads with actors who could fairly effortlessly convey emotions and thoughts merely through their facial expressions, body language, and general pantomiming. Jean Dujardin especially had a very expressive face, and the director hit a home run in casting his dog, which was, of course, adorable.

My favorite part of the movie was probably the dream sequence, which pretty deftly sums up George's mental and emotional state. That being said, I also enjoyed viewing the film with an eye for any anachronisms within it. They were clearly trying to mimic a 1920's production, but there were some things that they did in the movie that would not have been possible in a silent film from that era. There is a fun list on IMDB of actual anachronisms in the movie, which people-with-way-too-much-time-on-their-hands have noticed and detailed. God bless IMDB.

Cons: I know I said the acting was strong enough to carry the film in spite of the other missing elements that we have all taken for granted with modern movie making, but if I'm going to be honest... I like those other elements. A lot. Specifically the spoken dialogue part. It allows for so much more depth in a movie, and a significantly higher entertainment factor. Also, in order to properly convey emotions and thoughts in a voiceless movie, actors are forced to be pretty campy and mug at the camera a lot. I've just never been real big on that kind of overacting, which was prominent in earlier movies, also due in part to the legacy of stage acting in film.

Overall: I appreciate the attempt to rekindle an older style of storytelling, but I'm pretty confident that there was a good reason for the advancements in moviemaking technologies, and I'm generally appreciative of the effects of science here. Now, I'm aware that the mere presence of these technologies does not mean that every movie these days (or even the majority) contains those extra layers, but luckily they're still available. While I don't regret having seen this movie, I wasn't particularly enthralled during the viewing, and I have no overwhelming interest in seeing it again. In the end, I couldn't kick the feeling that it was just one giant exercise in glad-handing the glorious history of Hollywood, so I glad-handed it a 6 out of 10.",1362873600,,2583,4.865909090909091

 The movie is in black & white at 20 fpm. Begins in 1927, just as they were beginning to learn how to make ""talkies"". This film does have a musical track.

It is 1927. Movie patrons are watching a movie in a grande Los Angeles theatre. Actor George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is in the movie as the hero. He rescues the damsel in distress. George and the cast is waiting behind the screen for the movie to end. After ""The End"", the audience applauds and George comes out on stage. The audience loves him. He introduces his co-star who is a trained dog. The dog does a trick. Then he introduces his female co-star. After George does a dance for the audience, the actress becomes jealous of the attention he is getting and she leaves in a huff.  Outside the theatre, he gets more applause by the fans and meets with photographers. A female fan (Berenice Bejo) accidentally drops her purse and in the circle pooches her butt out to pick up her purse. Her butt bumps into George and he takes notice of her. A photographer quickly snaps a photo of them together.
 The next morning, when George's wife, Doris (Penelope Ann Miller), sees the photo in the morning newspaper, she doesn't like it one bit. She is jealous.
  The mystery woman goes to an audition at the Kinograph Studio. She dances for them. George also arrives at the same studio. George and the mystery woman meet again on the sound stage. Her name is ""Peppy Miller"". She is cast in his new picture, ""A German Affair"".  This is their story.

4979993,5,B00695E1BY,"For years, (since it came out), my all-time favorite movie was Braveheart. Now it's The Artist. I know, I'm probably over-reacting. But this is one clever movie that really gets to you. If someone is a film buff, the fact that it is silent makes it even more intriguing because the filmmakers use that to help tell their story. That may be an obstacle, initially, for the non-film buff. But after 30 minutes, they'll be hooked. It took me all of five minutes to be caught up in the lives of these very likable characters during a very interesting period in movie history - the transition of Hollywood from silent pictures to sound.

Rarely do I see a movie that I would call ""perfect""... but this one is. It has everything: a wonderfully touching story, great performances, beautiful cinematography and score. The one thing it lacks is sound. That's right - it's a silent film. Because it is about a silent movie star, the producers decided to make the film itself silent. When I first heard about it, I doubted that a silent film would work today, let alone get to me - but it did. It is the most delightful film I've seen in a long, long time. The details of late 1920s Hollywood, when sound movies were making their debut, are perfect: no film has ever been successful at capturing that period, in my opinion - until now.

With great charisma and charm, French actor Jean Dujardin portrays silent film star George Valentin (loosely based on Douglas Fairbanks), the hottest idol in Hollywood, and someone who really enjoys the spotlight. Then he meets Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), a young woman who wants to break into film herself. George is taken with her and decides to give her a break; in the process, they fall in love. Then sound enters the picture, and movies go from silent to talkies almost overnight. As George, who is unequipped for this change, watches his star fall, Peppy's rises meteorically. It's a classic love story set against the most turbulent years of Hollywood.

The filmmakers masterfully use the medium of silent film to tell their story in a very poignant and very clever way that took the Oscars by storm, winning it Best Picture. Dujardin also won Best Actor at Cannes and the Golden Globes for his performance, and the film itself won Best Comedy and Best Score at the Golden Globes. There are many nods to Hollywood icons, including Singing In The Rain (which deals with the same time period), A Star Is Born (which, like The Artist, deals with the rise of a young actress and the fall of an older actor), Asta (the scene-stealing dog from The Thin Man series), etc. John Goodman is wonderfully cast against type as producer Al Zimmer.

4979998,3,B00695E1BY,"""The Artist"" is a mildly entertaining lightweight film, noteworthy mostly because of its ""gimmick"".  The gimmick is its format, which is patterned after movies in the ""silent era"" - black-and-white, screen aspect ratio of 1:33, and (almost) no sound.

Plot-wise this movie is pretty darn bland.  George Valentin, a silent-movie star at the height of fame, crosses paths with a worshipful budding starlet just as the movie industry is about to embark on talkies.  Valentin rejects the new technology and a few short years later is a forgotten penniless alcoholic, while the starlet embraces the change and soon becomes famous. In other words, the plot is a mishmash of ""A Star Is Born"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Singing in the Rain"", and a whole bunch of other movies. Tellingly, ""The Artist"" would have been a disaster if it had been filmed in modern movie format, but that would have been ridiculous since the story is not the point of this movie, which is primarily an homage to the early years of Hollywood and to a different style of moviemaking.

As such, this movie was well done and a really interesting lesson in how a lack of sound changes the whole structure of a movie.  The actors' expressions and gestures, dramatic background music (and occasional dramatic LACK of background music), extensive scenes with only one actor and considerably less dialogue feigned in the others, and even sporadic lip-reading were only SOME of the tools that had to be assembled into a coherent tale, and in its own way this heightens the viewer's engagement with the movie.  Probably one of the reasons the dog from this movie became so popular is because dogs don't talk in the REAL world either, so he was easy to relate to.

However, the other thing this movie provides is a variation on the theme ""The Emperor Has No Clothes"" - not the movie itself but in the acclaim it received from the Elite Intellectuals.  Because frankly this is NOT a great movie, or really all that particularly good.  But, you know, everyone is anxious to demonstrate that THEY are movie intellectuals, and no one wants to appear to be a rube, so...  I've seen reviews and comments that hail this movie as a tribute to a time when moviemaking was in its purist art form, when actors ""REALLY knew how to act"".  What rubbish.  Anyone who dismisses the many EXTRAORDINARY performances of the past 80 years as ""inferior acting"" only because you could actually HEAR the actors is at best a blithering idiot and at worst a pretentious snob.

Academy Award Best Picture / Best Actor?  Sorry but this emperor has no clothes.  I'll pick ""The Descendants"" and George Clooney over this movie any day.",1358380800,3,2658,4.783369803063457
4979999,4,B00695E1BY,"Let's pretend for the sake of argument that THE ARTIST is not a ""silent"" movie and just ask ""Is THE ARTIST"" an entertaining movie?  I was entertained very much.  It's mainly a love story but it also focuses on a man's difficulty in accepting inevitable change, in this case the transition from silent films to talkies.  His insecurity in doubting his fans willingness to accept him in talkies.  The film is also a loving homage to a Hollywood of long ago.
It's really not a ""silent"" movie since the film's musical score is such a marvelous asset to THE ARTIST.
The cast is very good utilizing their physicalities to involve the audience.  Jean Dujardin won an Oscar for his role as George Valentin but Berenice Bejo is equally impressive as the spirited Peppy.  James Cromwell, John Goodman. Penelope Ann Miller and Missi Pyles lend admirable support.
While THE ARTIST is a bold venture in today's technically dominated cinema, I don't envision a massive output of silent movies.  Think of all the great voices and lines that have been indelibly etched into our minds that we never would have experienced without sound.

Man is good husband (unlike the lead character in 'The Artist').  He watches 'The Artist because wife wants him to.

Man wants to grab about 4' of rope and tie a noose and attach to vaulted ceilings about twenty minutes into film.

Man's desire to hang himself doesn't change after one hour and forty minutes.

Now, with sound....

I'm really happy that 'The Academy' deemed a film about an idiot who fell from grace, hated his wife, longed for an affair, drank too much, set his apartment on fire (unfortunately he and his annoying-as-hell Jack Russell Terrier were not tied to a wall while this was going on), and lived in self pity worthy of a Best Picture Award.

4980016,4,B00695E1BY,"Introduction:
Few films can cause you to hesitate about buying a ticket.  The Artist is one of those movies.  The type of movie is enough to stop you.  A silent movie in the 21st century?  Not really something you think about seeing.  However, this is a movie definitely worth a trip to Redbox, Netflix or Amazon.

Why did you choose this rating?
This version comes with UltraViolet, which is something I'm slowly moving towards.  As more people store their movies online, this is helpful because it allows you to essentially buy two copies at once.  The movie is well packaged and comes with a few, but not many, extras for viewers if that is something they are interested in.  The quality of the movie is also very good.  I would like to point out that it is meant to be shot in that frame size.  Several have commented on that and because the movie is a throwback to classic movies, it is supposed to look like that.

What did you like or dislike?
I enjoyed the score.  I am a big fan of film scores and have an extensive collection of soundtracks from many powerful films.  This one is no exception.  Yes, it LEGALLY borrows themes from other movies, but it is still strong and can easily stand on its own.  The acting in the movie is also very good.  Many actors in the movie are American actors we've seen in ""talkies"" before, but seeing them act silently with music is impressive.

The story is not an original one.  As my title suggests, it is a silent movie version of Singin' in the Rain.  It's a movie about the transition from silent movies to talkies and how pride and egos can get in the way of a person's career and happiness.  They are lots of movies about this so don't expect anything original about that.  How they approach the story is what should impress you.

Who would you recommend this product to?
I would recommend everyone see it at least once.  For those of you who love tributes to classical movies that we have grown to admire and respect, you should definitely buy it.  The movie has many moments that will inspire you and will bring a smile to your face or a tear to your eye.  And with the UltraViolet copy, this should definitely receive some consideration.

4980048,5,B00695E1BY,"In the day of the silent film, people had little exposure to film and, let's face it, many had little exposure to other people. Back then, you couldn't be sure how much the audience could read the body language of others, understand their facial expressions, figure out what a character was feeling based on events so far. So during the silent film era, actors had to over emote and so much more of the dialogue had to be read.

Nowadays we have exposure to so much what with movies, TV, life experiences (we're exposed to more people and more situations, and we have a better understanding of other people).  Watching this movie, I appreciated how a modern audience had so little need for dialogue. We could tell from facial expressions and body language what was being said/thought. There was no need for the characters to over act to get their points across.

This is what I appreciated most about the move: its minimalism. I'll bet there was 75% less reading and less character lip movement in this movie than there would have been 90 years ago. Modern writers can take for granted that we sometimes read lips and only require a simple expression from the character to understand what is happening.

From this standpoint, I really enjoyed this film.

1) It is almost entirely silent; and

2) It is in black and white, but was actually shot in color; yet

3) It is A LOT OF FUN to watch; yet

4) It is actually a somewhat dark movie: and

5) It is set in the five-year time period starting in 1927, just about at the end of the silent era; and

6) It also features dance numbers and music features prominently here; and

7) Though the film stars Dujardin, who deservedly won many Best Actor awards, I felt it was Berenice Bejo who really won my heart; and

8) It was introduced at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it was awarded Best Actor; and

9) It became the most awarded French film in history, nominated for ten Cesar awards and winning six (among them Fest Film, Director, and Actress); and

10) It is foreign (French), but has many American actors (among them James Cromwell, John Goodman, Missi Pyle, Penelope Ann Miller, and Malcolm McDowell); and

11) Jack (the Dog) was actually played by three identical Jack Russells; and

12) It was nominated for 10 Oscars and won five (among them Best Picture, Director, and Actor); and

13) It was nominated for six Golden Globes and won three (Best Picture, Actor and Original Score); and

14) It was nominated for 12 BAFTAs (the British ""Academy Awards"") and won seven (among them Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Original Screenplay); and

15) It was on countless Top Ten Lists across America; and

16) The film gives visual and auditory ""nods"" at many of Hollywood's great films (""Citizen Kane,"" ""Grand  Hotel,"" ""The Mark of Zorro,"" to name a few), but perhaps the most interesting is that it is only the second silent film to win an Academy Award--the other being ""Wings,"" the Academy Awards' FIRST Best Picture ever.

17) An odd closing fact: composer Ludovic Bource, who created ""The Artist""s musical score, was accused of ""rape"" by 1950s actress Kim Novak due to the use of a Bernard Herrmann musical composition created for the 1958 Hitchcock classic ""Vertigo,"" in which Novak had starred.  Novak actually declared that ""my body--at least my body of work--has been violated"" even though Herrmann's piece was legally borrowed, paid for, and credited (as is commonly practiced); and,

4980062,5,B00695E1BY,"In France, Michel Hazanavicius is best known for his ""OSS 117 spy comedy films featuring actor Jean Dujardin and his wife, Brnice Bejo.  But for Hazanavicius, as a fan of silent films, especially the filmmakers of that era, it was always a fantasy to make a silent film.

Of course, when he brought up to producers or potential investors that he wanted to create a black and white silent film, he was not taken seriously.  But fortunately, producer Thomas Langmann and other producers for the film, they listened and despite hesitation, followed his gut to finance the film, which would be known as ""The Artist"".

With a budget of $15 million and 35 days to shoot in Los Angeles, the film which required a lot of research not just by Hazanavicius but also his cast and trusting casting directors to hire the right people to pull this film off.  Along with Dujardin and Bejo, cast in the film are John Goodman (""Roseanne"", ""The Big Lebowski""), James Cromwell (""L.A. Confidential"", ""The Green Mile"", ""i Robot""), Penelope Ann Miller (""Carlito's Way"", ""Awakenings""), Missi Pyle (""Big Fish"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") and Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Halloween"", ""Easy A"").

And the black and white silent film that was almost never made, would become a major success and receive universal acclaim.  Dujardi won ""Best Actor"" at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, winner of three Golden Globes, winner of seven BAFTA awards, winner of five Academy Awards and winning six Cesar Awards (making it the most awarded French film in history).

Made for $15 million, ""The Artist"" would earn over $133 million in the box office and now ""The Artist"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in June 2012.

VIDEO:

In order to capture the feel of a silent film, ""The Artist"" is presented in black and white (1:33:1 aspect ratio) and looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray!  Full of detail, the HD presentation on Blu-ray features wonderful clarity.  From its closeups of the faces of the characters to the details of makeup, clothing and scenery.

Black levels are nice and deep and white and grays well-contrast, there is a little softness, but I believe that was intentional.  I didn't detect any anomalies or any problems with the video whatsoever.  ""The Artist"" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Artist"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film is a silent film but there are moments of sound effects but is driven by its musical score, composed by Ludovic Bource, who worked with the Michel Hazanvicius on both ""OSS 117 films.

According to Ludovic Bource, the relationship that he and Hazanvicius had during the making of the film was not saying so much.  If anything, Bource watched the rushes to understand the feeling of the film and builds his music from there.  Prior to making the film, both he and Hazanvicius listened to Chaplin, Max Steiner and Franz Waxman to Bernard Hermann.  They analyzed and listened to the music from the past, including romantic composers from the 19th century.

Bource said in an interview, ""We worked - a bit like Chaplin - along the lines of a light sophistication... What was great was being able to work in sequence blocks of 7, 8 or 9 minutes; to be able to reflect on the mood that could be connected to the plot or to a resonance which would be like the characters interior echo, even if there were different sequences within these blocks.""

Part of the challenge that Bource had in creating the music for a silent film was having to edit the music during editing.  Bource said, ""we had to reduce certain pieces according to the editing, throw lots of them away, and write new ones, adapt them following each step of the film that was being made.  Michel and I didn't stop fine-tuning, refining.""

For the soundtrack, Ludovic Bource worked with the Flanders Philharmonic Orchestra in Brussels for a week.  Featuring 80 musicians, 50 string players, four French horns, four trombones, five percussionists, a harpist, ten technicians, five orchestrators and three mixers.

My personal favorites from the film's soundtrack was its touch of elegance through the use of piano and strings.  The music goes through a musically wonderful but sad and emotional transition once we see the decline of silent film and hearing the music starting to go for upbeat, to something much more melodramatic and with a hint of sadness.  Bource had said that he was inspired by Brahms' ""Sapphic Ode"" and a song that fits the film's image of decline and loneliness of character George Valentin.

While Ludovic Bource created the majority of the music on this soundtrack, also featured are Brussels Philharmonic with ""Estancia OP.8, a surprise for me was hearing Red Nichols & His Five Pennies ""Imagination"".  Red Nichols was a popular jazz band in the 1920s and a wonderful inclusion to this soundtrack.  Also, included are Duke Ellington's ""Jubilee Stomp"" (from 1928) and Rose Murphy's ""Pennies from Heaven"" (a song that earned her the nickname ""The Chee Chee Girl"").

The music was a major emotional component to the film and I found it to be delightful and fantastic.  And on Blu-ray, the use of music and sound effects were more than appropriate for this film and sounds amazing in lossless!

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a fan of silent film, you eventually begin to read about what happened to the careers or the individuals, the stars of the silent era.

From Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Harry Langdon Jr., Clara Bow, Mary Pickford, the Talmadge sisters and many other silent film stars of the time, not many fared well from the transition from the silent films to the Talkies.

Many were known for their look and their acting style but not for their voices.  During that time, not many people had to remember their lines and people never judged about what came out of an actor's lips, there were intertitles that would explain what was going on in a scene and many talents had a great career and life because they were the stars of the time.

And while some tried to make the transition and others refused it, aside from a few talents such as Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Carole Lombard, Myrna Loy or Gloria Swanson, the coming of the talkies was not welcomed by many of the stars, stars who balked that the talkies would never surpass the popularity of silent films.

They were wrong.  The talkies would eventually be the nail on the coffin more the careers of most of the silent film stars and for those such as Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Mary Pickford who tried their best to make their careers continue, unfortunately, silent films and their stars were considered passe.  And the studios tried to distance themselves away from them.

Charles Chaplin tried his best to incorporate sound and even went as far to narrate a re-release of ""The Gold Rush"" (which shocked people because they never knew their beloved ""tramp"" would have an accent), Buster Keaton would also be featured in many talkies but by the '30s and '40s, physical vaudeville comedies were not popular compared to slapstick comedy, romantic comedies with handsome leading actors nor heroic military or Western stars.

Harold Lloyd, Mary Pickford and Clara Bow tried as well and although Mary Pickford would win an Academy Award for ""Best Actress in a Leading Role"" for ""Coquette"" in 1930, she had amazing fear towards the microphone, because she felt that she would never make it into talkies.  And her next talkie would become a flop, it killed career if the ""American's Sweetheart"".  As for Clara Bow, people were more surprised that she had a Bronx accent.

Harold Lloyd on the other hand would make a talkie but knew that with age and what the industry was looking for in Hollywood, he began to focus his career on photography and was one of the few people who had creative control of his films and did what he can to restore it.

But with silent films and the stars being considered as old-fashioned, movies and stars that your parents or grandparents would watch, not many stars made the transition.

And with the release of ""The Artist"", filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius was aware of that.  Sure, he is known as a comedy filmmaker for his ""OSS 117 films but he is a silent film fan, has watched many films and knew that he wanted to make one, he just needed the financial support.

The timing of ""The Artist"" is incredible.  As more and more people are now discovering silent films through the wonderful releases on Blu-ray and DVD, many are clamoring for the films featuring these top stars of that era.  Many wanting to know more about the silent era and being entertained by the films of directors such as D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, F.W. Murnau, Frank Borzage, Ernst Lubitsch, Fritz Lang, to name a few.  There is resurgence of interest in silent films today.

I have no doubt in my mind that ""The Artist"" will convert some people to silent films.  It may not make one an ardent fan but at least giving people exposure to a silent film.

And one thing that Michel Hazanavicius wanted to do is capture normalcy.  No vaudeville comedy type of direction but to capture the normalcy as seen in Murnau and Borzage films.  The feeling of natural acting.

And this is where ""The Artist"" achieves efficacy because both Jean Dujardin and Brnice Bejo are wonderful in this film. They make you believe in their characters, they make you feel the emotional high and lows of the character of George Constantin.  But not only is the acting wonderful by its main talent and also its supporting talent (including the extras), ""The Artist"" captivates you with its wonderful acting, its costume design, the authentic look of capturing an era but also a film that has emotion, humor, sadness and Ludoic Bource's music...everything comes together in this film.

I absolutely love this film and I probably watched this film about seven times now and I still have not grown tired of it.  The music, the camera, the editing, the overall rhythm of the film carries us along.  George Constantin is the silent actor that captivates a generation that grew up with the advances of cinema and embraced the silent film.  Peppy Miller is the upcoming starlet that epitomizes the ""out with the old"" sentiment, and Bejo plays her character with so much enthusiasm.  She knows how to flirt with the camera, captivate the viewer.

As for the Blu-ray release, the video and audio quality is magnificent.  While a silent film, the musical soundtrack by Ludovic Bource is fantastic!  As for the special features, it was great to see how the film was shot in various, historical locations in Los Angles and the addition of the post-screening live audience Q&A was also fun to watch!

""The Artist"" is a great film and while I doubt Hollywood is going to invest in any more modern day silent films, ""The Artist"" was a film that many never seen before or for those who are familiar with silent films, caused excitement and came out in a time that was just right.  It's delightful, heartwarming and magnificent!

In some way, ""The Artist"" is quite relevant because we are also in a modern, technological flux in entertainment.  Television and film are changing thanks to the Internet and ways to catch entertainment.  May it be music or cinema, with technology, social media and an audience who has access to many forms of entertainment, what is in today could be gone or drastically changed a decade from now. Change is inevitable and ""The Artist"" is a good reminder of how change affected a genre and all the talent involved.

""The Artist"" began as a fantasy for filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius.  Now, ""The Artist"" will now be considered his finest masterpiece.  ""The Artist"" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!",1352419200,5,12785,4.866389274156265

4980064,2,B00695E1BY,"""The Artist"" Won The 2011 Best Picture Academy Award: ....Was this good news?

I have my doubts......

I'm a SAG Actor and follow the Academy Awards yearly, and comment here about ""The Artist"" (2011) winning the Best Picture award recently (Feb. 2012).

This is not an American movie, as neither Hamlet (1948) nor SlumDog Millionaire (c. 2008) were, either. That is worthy of comment, and perhaps protest.

I doubt that either of the two main actors, or the director speak fluent English, or English without a thick foreign accent. Yet the main actors portrayed Americans in a movie where their voices are (almost) never heard....it's a ""silent movie"" with a music and sound effects sound track, but almost no dialog.

Several older USA actors (John Goodman and James Cromwell) are included as supporting actors, neither in major or key parts.

This movie is a clever movie, very well done with set decoration, costuming, and camera work, but not at all ideal regarding it's story and screenplay. It's important to like the main actors (even the villains) from the start of the movie, and, at least for me, this didn't happen. The main male character....he got a Best Actor Award from the Academy....didn't ""fetch me,"" and I always think that is mandatory if one is to rate the movie top drawer.

THE ARTIST (2012) is this year's big deal movie......not my choice, but I don't control things. Based on A STAR IS BORN movies and story, done 3 times....1937 starring Janet Gaynor and Frederick March (I screened it last night......sappy...Fred commits suicide at the end of the movie....Janet carries on bravely by not leaving Hollywood, stays on as a movie star!), 1954 starring Judy Garland and James Mason (Judy got a Best Actress Academy Award for that movie, which I've never seen), and finally Barbra Streisand in the 1970's with Kris Kristofferson, I think. Never saw that, either.

Same story in all three movies.....old time older actor getting dissed and not hired any more marries an unknown young, up and coming girl who becomes a bigger star than he was and isn't any more....she stays loyal to her older husband to the end!

THE ARTIST (2012) has a happy ending, different from at least the 1937 movie....don't know how the other two 1954 and 1970's STAR IS BORN movies ended...maybe happy, too.

Well........

The Academy Awards voters gave us SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE as ""Best Picture"" recently and it shows how capricious the whole thing is.

I own a great retrospective book analyzing the history of the awards, and the politics part of it all.....book is titled THE REAL Oscar (1981 or so)....which is good to page through....the history of the whole thing up to 1981 (it started in 1929).

It's all about glitz and jazzy outfits and celebrities quipping, etc. etc. Show biz putting on a night of show biz.

I also own a pretty good documentary about it all titled OSCAR'S GREATEST MOMENTS (1991) which shows the history of the show from 1970 through 1990.

It's a big institution over the years.....83 years by now! Liz Taylor, now passed away at age 79, wasn't even born when the first Oscars were awarded.

I find that usually the choices are OK....I haven't paid attention to movies in recent times produced recently, except movies I act in (FYI, I've acted in more than 40 SAG Signatory feature movie and national TV drama projects since 2004.....almost never Oscar contenders except for George Clooney winning an actor award in 2005 for SYRIANA, and the WEDDING CRASHERS which was a big money earner in 2005 and I think won a technical award that year).

It was so well done, if I hadn't known better, I would have thought it was a movie from the 1920s.  Jean du Jardin was fantastic--he needed no words to convey the story and his emotions.  AND he is GORGEOUS!!!  Uggie the Dog was a joy and an incredible talent too!  A delightful story that old movie buffs and the whole family will enjoy.",1349395200,2,501,4.166666666666667

After seeing it again last night I was absolutely blown away!  First of all the soundtrack was beautiful.  Whoever composed the music captured the tone and background of the 1920s era including even popular music from that time period.  Jean Dujardin's portrayal of movie star, George Valentin was brilliant--I never realized how difficult it must be to perform without speaking and trying to communicate with facial expressions and movements.  Berenice Bojo as Peppy Miller, the newly discovered star was just delightful in her role.  Of course, the addition of Uggie, the rescued canine made this film all the more special!",1349136000,2,781,5.110236220472441
4980077,4,B00695E1BY,"A cynical viewer might consider ""The Artist"" to be a gimmick movie, and the only reason it won the Oscar for best picture was because it evoked the Golden Age to a bunch of the old fogies in the Academy.  This hypothetical cynic is missing the point entirely, and even if he wasn't, a gimmick movie can still be a worthwhile viewing experience.  As for the film itself, it is so cheerful, so open, so honest that only the most jaded cynic could fail to be won over by it.

As I'm sure most readers of this review will know, the film is black-and-white, and (mostly!) silent.  Naturally there is music, which always accompanied silent films in the theatre.  There are a few, well-placed uses of sound (it turns out that Uggi the Dog has more spoken lines than both the human stars put together), but for 99% of the time the jazzy soundtrack is the only sound we hear while we are watching the images.  The plot is so simple that it can be fully summarized as such: star gets washed up; new star comes up; reconciliation at the end by the old star to the new situation, helped by the new star (the new situation meaning the advent of sound in motion pictures).  That is not a criticism - the quality of a picture is measured in how well the parts (acting, special effects, dialogue if any!) serve to tell the story.  I was, perhaps oddly, reminded of the Lion King, my favourite Disney film, which also has a very simple story that has been told innumerable times in innumerable variation but which is somehow entirely fresh and fun.

It goes without saying that the emotions and facial expressions of the actors are exaggerated, but the most fascinating performance in the picture goes to Jean Dujardin, who plays an actor who we also see ""acting"" in his own silent films.  The differentiation between the actor and the actor acting, if you will, is distinct, and presumably the overacting we see in the older silent movies was deliberate in order to compensate for the resolution of the old cameras and/or film stock quality.  Or perhaps simply because they were trained stage actors and vaudeville performers who needed to be seen at the back of the theatre.  Whatever the case, the fun of the performances lies in the way the story is advanced through the acting choices used for each situation.  The choice of the other actors is interesting, and again, in the era of studio contracts, bit players would be recognizable because the same people would be used over multiple films.  Thus, Malcolm McDowell appears as an extra for all of 1 minute of screen time.  John Goodman plays the head of the studio who somehow evokes bucolic and paternal simultaneously.  And Berenice Bejo, the female lead, is so delightfully open and naive-looking that we buy into her seeming cluelessness in dealing with the proud older man.

Therefore, I enjoyed the film.  It is perhaps the best ""first-date"" film I can think of.  This DVD has some extras on it, perhaps of some interest to cinephiles and/or upcoming filmakers.  So overall a 4/5 rating, which I give to films that I enjoyed, but don't feel the need to see over and over again.",1348444800,,3123,4.602888086642599

The gimmick of the silent and black and white film wore thin real quick, and was done much more humorously in Mel Brooks ""Silent Movie."" That movie was funny! ""Singing in the Rain"" dealt with the transition period from the silent-to-talkies with far greater skill (music, dancing, humour etc.....)

4980080,4,B00695E1BY,"After all the hype, the Academy Awards & trailers, I found this movie fascinating.  There were so many times in the ""Artist"" when one openly laughed, but others that required some small amount of thought.  It was genius to see all the things we have seen in other silent movies done so cute, funny & thought provoking.  The use of body language is lost because of ""multi-plex"" theaters.  Many of today's actors haven't a clue as to how to use facial expression, and hand and body movement as a way to communicate effectively.  The ""Artist"" is a movie we can all learn from.  As we work & interact with others we don't use our hands, posture or facial expressions to empathize what we want to do and say more clearly.  If you haven't viewed this movie, you should.  Great price, all the sizzle promised is delivered and more.  A movie such as the ""Artist"" should be in the mix of romance, thrillers, & comedies made available each year.  I'd watch this again, just to see ""Gee, how did they do that?""

I was happy for the Oscar wins that it achieved also. Being a ""film fanatic"" I loved the homage to the silent film era and found only a few minutes into the film that I wasn't distracted by it being both silent and filmed in black-and-white.  I have a few films in my personal film library that are both silent and B&W and THE ARTIST takes a place of honor.

I recommended it highly and continue to do so!  I also hope to see Du Jardin in other films.  His look transcends eras and I don't doubt that he would be equally interesting to watch in every other film genre.",1347148800,,719,4.181159420289855

The whole story, every emotion, is communicated to the audience through the actions and gestures of the actors. It is like watching an actual moving painting. How movies were intended to be. It all comes together beautifully. Best love story of the year, probably the past couple of years.
However, if you have no patience, you need things to happen fast as many people do today. You may not find this movie pleasant. You'll probably find it boring and dragging. Just a warning. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some will wait and consume the whole work before judging and reacting to it. Others will lose interest within 10 minutes if nothing big happens and condemn the whole thing. Patience is a virtue and this movie is definitely worth the wait!",1347062400,2,911,4.62962962962963

The charisma of the actors, the humor and the truly touching moments.  I was whisked back in time.  I would put this up there with all the greats of the genre.  A true love story to the silent films.  And, hopefully one that will inspire others to appreciate classics from our past.  And, there are some truly brilliant films that ever fan of movies should watch.  The soundtrack to the film is perfect.  My only criticism, despite her fine performance, is that Berenice just doesn't look like she is from that time period.  She has a very modern appearance, which sometimes took me out of the movie.

4980099,5,B00695E1BY,"Weary of over the top violence and nudity ""The Artist"", for me, was a pleasant surprise.  There is drama, romance and humor. It seamlessly depicts movies within the movie and utilizes clever Dutch tilt camera angles reminiscent of ""The Third Man"" and ""Citizen Kane"" that heighten the dramatic effect. There are few surprises in the story line: an aging movie star becomes a has been and his protege becomes the new star.  Then again there are stories that bear being repeated (""A Star is Born and ""All About Eve"" have similar throughlines.)  But the story is not the main attraction.  The story is more of an accompaniment to the art. The art is in the authentic scenery, costumes and brilliant acting.

I highly recommend this movie.  The trailers and commercials don't do justice to the craftmanship and attention to detail that made this movie a gem, so I suggest that if you, like me, thought it might not be your kind of movie, you should give it a try if for no other reason than the rare opportunity to see a ""feel good"" movie you can watch with your children without being embarrassed.",1346889600,2,1093,4.637305699481865

She became a major star but never forgot the kindness he showed her when she was just beginning.

We'd been watching a lot of old silent movies on the cable channels, so when we heard all the hype about The Artist, we put it on our must watch list. The production quality was excellent, but I was a little disappointed in the total story. Since you can't really multi-task when watching a silent movie - they had our full attention. It was a simple, one dimensional story. The only real novelty was that it was a silent movie. Fun, but not a movie I will ever watch again.",1346889600,2,575,4.333333333333333

4980109,5,B00695E1BY,"Hollywood, and the film industry internationally, have not been shy about making pictures about making pictures, or some other aspect of the movie industry. Some have been well-done like Day For Night others rather more self- indulgent like The Last Tycoon rather less so. The idea though of doing a film about the silent movie era by making a silent movie (almost totally) using a tried and true rags to riches theme and having audiences (or at least this reviewer and he was not alone) stay with the plot is a notch above all the other efforts.

Okay, the plot of this thing has been done to death, the old star is born routine, this time with an aging male silent film star ""stepping aside,""  kicking and screaming (silently of course) for a younger  female star who not only can mug for the camera but talk without embarrassing herself, her bosses or the audience. But it is not the plot line that intrigues but the pure artistry that it took to convey a story line back in the day by ""mugging for the camera.""  I have seen some silent movies and I am sure more than one director or producer from that period would have died just to have the technology to produce such mugging in such crisp and seamless form back in the 1920s. This one is well worth seeing for just that reason.",1346630400,2,1283,4.446808510638298
4980110,3,B00695E1BY,"First, the DVD: Can't complain, no flaws, looked good in my rather modest home theater.
Second, the movie: very good photography, action easy to follow. A few title cards every now and then, complementing the action with some important bit of dialog or with some back story that cannot be shown: silent-movie style, but unobtrusively done. The factor form is that of movies before wide-screen formats, same as that of the screen of an old TV.
There is some exaggeration of facial gestures, but less than in old dramatic silent movies where faces had to convey both emotion and some idea of what was being said but not heard by the audience. I felt that a more modern acting technique, allowing for more subtlety, was being used to that same end. The movie, by the way, is not silent: there is background music throughout, plus some ambient sounds now and then, and full sound in the closing scene. It is really very much a modern movie shown in black and white with the stage mikes turned off. In looks, it resembles more a 30's or 40's comedy than a 20's film: a sharper image (or maybe old silent movies being shown now are the dulled copies of copies of copies), and more outdoor scenes.
Unlike the old silent movies that were filmed at a lower frame rate than modern ones, and later were modified by repeating frames in order to be projected with modern equipment, which made them look jerky, the motion here is about as smooth as in any contemporary movie -- and as it really was when silent movies were shown with the intended equipment, back in their day. Actually, ""The Artist"" was filmed at a slightly lower rate than the usual 24 frames per second, to give it an antique feel, but I did not noticed it.
It has been rated PG 13 because of one lonely finger gesture and some heavy drinking by the leading male character to drown his sorrows for being: (a) made redundant by the start of the talkies, (b) ruined after financing an expensive film project that failed, (c) thrown out of his rich girlfriend's house, and (d) hit by the Great Depression while just out of work, all more or less at once. His drinking is heavy but not disgusting - i.e.: not quite realistic, done with a very light touch, as in old-fashioned movies.
Third, the two main actors: both excellent and very good looking; in fact, the actress is a rare, pure-blood beauty. They both have great smiles, although these diminish as the action grows darker towards the middle, and come back in full radiance at the end. And both do some pretty decent tap dancing, that they practiced for five months to get it right.
And last, but not least, there is the little dog Uggie, which should have got an Oscar --or at least his trainer should.
Fourth, the story: if you saw ""Singin' in the Rain"", it is more or less the same idea told silent-movie style and in black and white. Not classic-movie stuff like that one, in my view, but enjoyable nevertheless.
Certainly enjoyable enough that I do not regret seeing it and felt well served after doing so: good enough entertainment for those who go to see it with an open mind.",1346544000,2,3092,4.533094812164579

In most scenes, you can read their lips and on occasion, there are words posted on the screne as was done in the era of silent film.

4980114,5,B00695E1BY,"George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is quite possibly the most famous silent movie star of the late 1920's. Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo) is a talented young dancer hoping to break in on the Hollywood scene. One day, in an incredible twist of fate, Valentin and Miller meet on set. Inevitably, sparks fly between the two as they create magic on screen. Their paths cross over the next several years, until the arrival of the ""talkies"" revolutionizes the film industry, sending their careers in completely opposite directions.

There was a lot of talk about The Artist prior to its release. Critics raved about it. It swept the Oscars winning a total of five Academy Awards, including Best Actor, Best Director and the crme de la crme--Best Picture. In an interesting side note, it's the only silent film to take home the award for Best Picture in Oscar history, like ever. So with all the hype, was the movie even worth it? There's only one answer to that question... YES.

Now, I don't know if you've ever seen a silent film. I have and I have to say, they are a lost art. There's something so beautiful about their way of storytelling--it's poignant and meaningful, much more so than many of the movies produced today. And don't let the ""silent"" part fool you. ""Silent"" is sort of a misnomer because it's not like these movies are without sound. There are sound effects that echo strategically behind a masterfully crafted score. It's these sound effects and music that set the mood for the audience, helping to tell a huge part of the story. Being filmed in classic silent film fashion, 1.33:1 aspect ratio, Hazanavicius has kept the true feel of that bygone era, allowing the viewer to really experience the film as it should be experienced. What we're given is a collection of whimsical moments that rely on showing instead of telling. It becomes very clear that showing is one of Hazanavicius' strongest suits.

When you have a silent film, I think the most important thing of all is creating chemistry. Without chemistry between the actors, you have nothing but jumble of random events. The chemistry that Jean Dujardin and Brnice Bejo share on screen is undeniably strong, perhaps because of their work together on prior films. Dujardin exudes total charm and charisma, and Bejo, nothing but grace and enthusiasm. They move together with so much skill and flair, I could hardly pry my eyes away from the screen. They are completely mesmerizing. And with cameos by John Goodman, James Cromwell and Penelope Ann Miller, you're hard pressed to find a more talented cast of characters. But the irrefutable scene stealer of this movie is Valentin's precious pooch, Jack (aka Uggie). Seriously. Who can resist that face?

Yes. I do mean to say, the dog stole the show. But what I find most impressive about this film was the way it made me feel. I don't think I've ever felt so much when I've watched a movie before. The Artist was compelling, endearing, funny, sad and wistful. It made me hope, laugh, smile and cry. Like it or not, this film latches on to your heartstrings and won't let go. There is nothing you can do but surrender yourself to its magic and be genuinely happy that you're along for the ride. Michel Hazanavicius has created something truly extraordinary, and like the silent movies of the past, something that is sure to become a classic for all time.

Food for Thought: Michel Hazanavicius has not only nailed it, he's done silent films a great service with this masterpiece. I find it incredibly amazing that one film can say so much without really saying anything at all. Let me be candid with you, if I may. This. Film. Did. Not. Need. Words. In all my enthusiasm for entertainment, I rarely classify any movie as perfect, but The Artist was in every sense of the word, sheer perfection. It is, to date, the most joyful film I've ever had the pleasure to see.

The unspoken and unheard became loud and clear.  The actors facial expressions and body motions moved with their lips and created a script that anybody could understand and enjoy.
This movie should be catalogued with the best classics.
What I liked most about the movie:
It was cerebral.
Every actor and every scene combined with great music to bring this movie to life (living color and sound).
It didn't need sophomorish bathroom humor to be funny.
It didn't need sex to be passionate and romantic.
It had many very memorable moments like the old time greats - Here's lookin' at you kid.
It didn't need words or sounds to hear and experience the action, love, tragedy and inspiration.
And, the dog was just as much of a character as any of the human actors in the movie.  The dog should be named Oscar.
I watched this alone, and like a good book I couldn't stop watching - even though I was tired and needed to go to bed.
I plan on watching it again, and I am going to insist that my girlfriend watch it with me - I know she'll love it.
If they made silent movies like this back in the beginning, it could have delayed the need for talkies.
From one armchair critic to another - watch it (you'll be glad you did).",1345248000,9,1379,4.396078431372549

4980123,5,B00695E1BY,"`The Artist' is one of those rare films that comes out of nowhere and completely takes over.  It embodies what we love so much about film from start to finish and consumes us into believing that, for a brief moment at least, everything is as it should be.  Gimmick or no gimmick, this film made me smile like no film in recent memory ever has.  Of course, any film that burst onto the scene with this much buzz was bound to receive its fair share of backlash, but despite any petty reservations heaped up the most recent Oscar winner, this film deserves to be cherished.

Do I think it was the best film of 2011?  No.  But when does THAT film ever win at the Oscars?

`The Artist' is a silent film.  I think it's important to make that clear.  For some strange reason, the buzz and hype appeared to blind the eyes of the general public and people went to the movies forgetting that there was no dialog.  Before you rent, buy or watch this movie, remember that it is silent and thus you will be watching people's mouths move and be reading plaque cards and be listening to a glorious musical score.  If you can accept that reality, then you are in store for a marvelously fun ride.

The story itself is rather light and predictable.  It is actually like a silent version of `Singing in the Rain'.  It centers on a famous silent film actor who bucks the system when the cinematic world embraces sound.  He doesn't fit that mold, and quite frankly he doesn't want to.  So, instead of maintaining his present appeal, his stardom diminishes and he finds himself going from the top of the world to the gutters.  At the same time a bright young starlet who got her first role thanks to the dashing silent actor begins to rise in the ranks and becomes a major `Talkie' star.  Their lives continue to intersect until, as can be expected, things `find their place' for the two of them.

Shot in crisp black and white that recalls the endearing quality of silent films of the 20's, `The Artist' dazzles in all the right places.  It is directed, acted and constructed with so much fun that the audience can't help but lap it up.  Even my wife, who is highly opposed to silent films (and even black and white pictures) was in love with this movie.  It is simple and it is predictable and it doesn't do anything particularly special plot-wise, but it manages to remind us why we're at the movies.  It encompasses all the special, dazzling, wonderful things about the cinema and secures a place in our hearts from the moment it begins.  It may lack substance, if one can fault it that, but it never allows us to accept that fact because our attention is so wrapped up in the spell this film casts on us.

Don't begrudge DuJardin and Hazanavicius their Oscar wins; they worked HARD for those.",1344816000,,2776,4.438735177865612
4980124,4,B00695E1BY,"Maybe my expectations were too high. I was eager to see this film as I've had several people recommend it to me as they know I'm knowledgeable about silent film history. While I applaud the tremendous risk the filmmakers took to make a silent film in the 21st century, there were two things that bothered me.

First, the style was a strange mishmash. It's as though The Artist was made in the 1940s with the purpose of depicting the silent era. Much of the set design, fonts, etc. are more reminiscent of the 40s era in Hollywood history than the silent film era. That's not to say I didn't like it. The 1940s in American film are an a fascinating era, and I love its style. Still, I had to wonder if the filmmakers knew much about film history.

Second, the story is hackneyed and not compelling. The characters lacked complexity, and though the performances were quite good I never felt involved or concerned with what might happen to them (except for the adorable dog).

The best thing about this film is that its success has hopefully made it easier for filmmakers to take chances and produce cinema that challenges.",1344556800,4,1120,4.59

4980131,4,B00695E1BY,"Based on how much I personally enjoyed it, I'd give ""The Artist"" three stars, but since the filmmakers went out on a limb to do something different and did it well, I have to give four stars.

Before anyone starts flipping out that I am not raving about this story of silent movie matinee idol George Valentin's troubled transition to the sound era and calling it an instant classic: I watch and enjoy lots of black and white movies, lots of older movies, a fair number of silent movies and even my share of French movies. My disappointment does not stem from the film's lack of color, dialogue, spectacular special effects, explosions, car chases, syrupy romance, bathroom jokes, or breakneck pacing. I was not distressed by the aspect ratio. I get the homage the filmmakers were striving for.

These are the things that hampered my enjoyment of ""The Artist."" The plot's combination of ""A Star Is Born"" and ""Singing In the Rain"" seemed tired to me, except for the way it was reconciled at the end. Maybe I've seen those other movies too many times. If you're going to make a silent movie in 2011, that's fine with me, but come up with something that's not quite so patently lifted from other movies. You can do homage without quite such heavy-handed copying (see ""Rango"" for example). I found the pace slow by silent movie standards, especially during George's downward spiral. I often found myself thinking, ""I got the point of that scene a while ago. Can we please move on?"" It bugged me that Berenice Bejo, while delightful, did not for one moment convince me that she was an ambitious American starlet named Peppy Miller. French people say they can always spot Americans because we smile all the time. Bejo struck me as a very French woman doing her best impression of a brash, constantly smiling American.

Even so, I think ""The Artist"" is well worth seeing for the whole family. The period detail, costumes and black and white photography are drop-dead gorgeous. I loved the soundtrack. The acting is quite good and the dog Uggy is darling. Amid what has become a cliche storyline (""A Star Is Born"" has after all been done four times in the sound era, once under the title ""What Price Hollywood?""), there is real and still-timely compassion for the title character whose fame, fortune, and sense of worth as an artist and entertainer have been pulled out from under him by changing technology and changing taste. I kept thinking of silent matinee idol John Gilbert, who descended into despair, alcoholism and early death when his style of acting went out with the advent of sound, especially when George says, ""Nobody wants to hear me speak."" For kids (and probably some adults as well), ""The Artist"" has some valuable things to say about pride, friendship, and when it's time to give rugged individualism a rest.

If ""The Artist"" starts a trend for making black-and-white silent movies again, I'm excited. This is a flawed but worthy start in reviving a beautiful, imagination-stimulating art form.",1344297600,3,3006,4.797297297297297

The story was more predictable than a kids' movie.
The main character is foolish, rude, ignorant, vain, selfish, and a drunk.
The female love-interest puts up with all his abuse for the whole story, as she (and we) ""know"" he will change five  minutes before the end of the film.  Wow.  Yeah. That.
Now for the bad news- it uses a ""what-if"" suspention of belief plot device about 10 minutes in-for no reason!
Then, about 45 minutes farther along, they add another impossible pretext -also unnecessariliy- which contradicts the first one.  Was this the first big hit written by an 8 year old compusive liar??
 Hollywood likes to pat itself on the back for taking risks, trying something new, and remembering the pioneering efforts of the great directers from 90 years ago.

The only other movie I know of that depicts the troubling and, for some, ruinous time of the birth of talkies in Singing in the Rain. However, the Artist takes it one step further and tells the story in the way it would have been told at the time. The aspect ratio, the cuts, the music, the directing, the scenes, and the silent aspect of the acting all come straight of the period and all are wondrously compiled into a compelling movie even for today's audiences.

4980144,5,B00695E1BY,"'The Artist' was not on my list of must-see films. When released to theaters (just barely available where I live), I thought that this B&W film without dialogue was nothing more than a novelty. I was wrong. It deservedly won the Academy Award for best picture. Although the similar themed Martin Scorcese film 'Hugo' was my personal favorite for 2011, I concluded after watching the DVD of 'The Artist'  that Michel Hazanavicius's 'The Artist' was the better film.

 On the surface, 'The Artist' can easily be seem as a rewrite of 'A Star is Born'. It is a simple story of the rise and fall of a Hollywood male silent screen star molded in the image of Douglas Fairbanks and the rise of a beautiful adoring female singer and dancer who secretly loves him. The director eliminates all dialogue (or more accurately, almost all dialogue) and replaces it with a few dialogue cards and music scores. The director also films the movie in B&W to capture the era of silent film.

 Knowledgeable film fans will notice some anachronisms early in the film. The film clips used at the beginning of one of George Valintin's silent films is more in the style of the middle 1930's and the opening credit sequence  could have been lifted out of an early 1940's B movie. Astute viewers will also notice that the director uses music scores from films that cover the entire era of filmmaking from the 1920's to the 1950's including the infamous (at least according to Kim Novak) use of Bernard Hermann's music from Hitchcock's 'Vertigo'. There is a reason for all of this.

 'The Artist' is about the art of making films. Hazanavicius eliminates dialogue to force the focus of the viewer on the actors and their craft. The actors use body movements and facial expressions to convey their feelings to the audience. The viewer MUST watch this film to understand it. You can not sit back, ignore the screen, and just listen to dialogue. The viewer needs to be actively involved to watch this film as if you were viewing a foreign language film with subtitles but without the annoyance of having to shift your attention from the vusial content to the subtitles. Hazanvicius carefully shoots his actors to accentuate the action on screen by choosing appropriate angles and point of view. Each scene is also perfectly framed and staged to convey the meaning of each scene. The director also uses B&W to force the viewer to watch the film as a purely visual experience without the distraction of color.

 In summary, 'The Artist' is an exercise in filmmaking that film school graduates would immeditely appreciate. It is all here. A display of the art of film and a sublte history of Hollywood in the 1920's and 1930's as well. It is no wonder that this film caught the attention of the film making community. 'The Artist' is one of the best films ever made about film making. It should also be noted that this film about Hollywood was not made by an American but by a film making production team from France. Foreign directors seem to often be keen observers of American culture. Highly recommended.",1343865600,6,3074,4.718283582089552

As a lover of William Powell(The Thin Man), an american actor who went successfully from silent movies to talkies, the short glimpse I got of the character reminded me of him.  And it looked like a compelling story.  I got all that in a 20 second ad? Now that's editing!
By now, you are all familiar with the plot - if not, check out MANY MANY reviews that will tell you what it is.  But more than that, writer-director Michel Hazanivicious has created an experience that transcends just a melodrama and/or novelty movie. For those who have not watched many silent movies (or EVER seen one) if you will just relax, turn off the cell phone, stop playing with the dog or WHATEVER for the first couple of minutes, you'll be drawn in to 1927 Hollywood, and a sweet story of famed actor who is atop the world, meets girl, loves girl, loses job, fights change, loses self worth, and is redeemed. But it's so much more.
It is the many moments that make you smile, laugh out loud, and hold your breath in anticipation.  A few of my favorite scenes are of transition - when superstar George Valentin (a most deserving Oscar winner Jean Dujardin)realizes the pretty extra he's dancing with take after take is more than just cute. When ingenue Peppy Miller (French Cesar Winner and Oscar Nominee Berenice Bejo) realizes the man she's smitten with is not only handsome, playful and kind, but married. When George has just had a terrible meeting with studio mogul Al Zimmer(John Goodman is perfect),comes down a staircase and runs into Peppy, who, having just signed with his studio is thrilled because she thinks she and George can now do movies together. He's angry and upset and yet can look her in the eye and be happy for her. She makes him forget his misery. Their affection is genuine, so much so that when new star Peppy, on the eve of the opening of their competing films, makes comments about ""old actors mugging for the camera"" to reporters in a restaurant, not knowing until too late that George has heard her and is deeply wounded. I felt badly for both of them. George struggles and falls and goes into depression, yet Peppy(nor his swell little dog Uggie)never gives up on him. When he finally does go to see a talkie, it stars her, and he is charmed. On screen, she pulls him into smiles the way she does with audiences.

I love every frame of this film and was really thrilled when Oscars were awarded to Ludovic Bource for his PERFECT score that I enjoy listening to in my car still; to Mark Bridges for what must have been more than 100 fully completed 1920's era costumes that were gorgeous to look at, and of course to the man who believed - Thomas Langman as producer.  I wish it would have won the other nominated Oscars for art direction, editing, cinematography and Berenice Bejo's performance. Other movies can throw millions of dollars into a set piece, but if it overpowers the actors within it, all the stuff is just clutter. The actors in this story never get lost because all the elements of this movie are perfectly executed and balanced. They enhance one another.

Under Michel Hazanivicious's Oscar winning direction, the performances are gorgeous and always pitch perfect, right down to every extra, every bit part. Berenice Bejo is magic in this role. And I defy you to find a more captivating sequence in any movie than Uggie's run for help in a pivotal scene! The look of this movie is perfect and lovingly crafted.

I could go on another 300 words about Jean Dujardin's tour de force as George Valintin. It is a beautifully layered, sexy, powerful, sometimes heartwrenching and ultimately stellar performance. Played against Berenice Bejo's loving Peppy Miller, he comes through as the nice guy and the superstar we know he is, even though his pride has interfered with his willingness to try something new. The issue was not that George Valentin wouldn't make it in talkies - he has way too much charm and talent to fail. But after seeing another star's awful sound test he didn't think talkies could ever be good!!

I do wish all the bonus features in the DVD release were longer.  I would have been thrilled with a second DVD just to hear about more about the making of this charming homage to Hollywood and love stories; more from the director and actors. It would be interesting to have see some of his storyboards and Mark Bridges' costume studies, and of course would have loved a longer blooper reel. It did seem as though there was some excessive yakking it up commentary by James Cromwell in the Q&A section (MORE JEAN DUJARDIN PLEASE!!) but it's obvious he's very proud of this film and the entire cast and production company must be as well. Thanks to the Weinstein Company for bringing it to the world!  Best Picture - OUI!!!  Merci beaucoups, beaucoups!!  As Jean Dujardin called him, Michel Hazanavigenius!!""
*** Word of warning when viewing the movie.  I had to turn the sound WAY UP once it began in order to get the benefit of the wonderful music.  Also, though tempted to make the picture as large as possible, please leave it in it's 1:33 ratio to get the picture as it was intended. It looks better and is closer to what a real silent movie looks like. (yes, they were square!!) Finally, I changed my TV's picture mode from ""cinema"" to ""standard"" and lo and behold, it looks just like it did in the theater!!  Enjoy!",1343433600,5,5443,4.594845360824742

4980151,4,B00695E1BY,"I suppose it isn't surprising that ""The Artist"" won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, as it is a tribute to Hollywood filmmaking -by a Frenchman, no less. But this is a fun film and a reminder that it doesn't take much to make an old art form and approach new again. Silent film was eclipsed by sound at its height in the late 1920s. It went from apogee to non-existence in just a few years. French director Michel Hazanavicius saw the drama in that. He loves silent film. So he chose to dramatize the great change in Hollywood with an homage, a silent film about the misfortunes of a silent film actor and the rising star of an actress who finds success in the ""talkies"".

In 1927, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a big star of the silent screen. He typically appears as a dashing adventurer with his beloved Jack Russell Terrier (Uggie) as a comic sidekick. Audiences line the streets to see his films, and George clearly enjoys the stardom. He bumps into a fan one evening at a premiere. George makes light of the incident, and they both mug for the cameras. Encouraged by the publicity, Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo) goes to Kinograph Studios the next day to audition as a dancing extra, where she runs into George again. They get along famously but see little of one another as George faces financial ruin when talkies come into fashion, and Peppy turns out to be just the vivacious young woman that audiences want to see -and hear- onscreen.

Since this is silent film, it doesn't matter that half the cast is French and half American. This is ironic, as George's voice disqualified him from making the transition to talkies. Clever interplay between the modern silent film we are watching and the historical world of silent films within that film are a big part of its appeal. This gives the audience something to think about beyond the simple melodrama onscreen. ""The Artist"" isn't only nostalgia, though there is plenty of that. It's a comment as well as a tribute to the silent era. It's about a dying art form and the art that emerges to take its place, made as Hollywood wrings its hands and wonders if 3-D will save it from rising production costs and lost DVD sales.

There are intertitles, but ""The Artist"" tells the story with images, as films did before sound. The shot was the component part rather than the scene. This is difficult for a modern cinematographer to achieve. The shots are not as striking as the greatest silent films, but an effort to compose the scenes so as to tell as story visually is apparent. Cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman does admirable work. I only wish that more modern films made such an effort to be visually smart. The energy of the lead actors engages the audience, while the terrier runs around and amuses us, and ""The Artist"" looks great. If the demise of silent film and transition to talkies interests you, Scott Eyman's ""The Speed of Sound"" is a good book on the subject.",1343260800,5,2940,4.63915547024952

4980153,2,B00695E1BY,"I guess it didn't stink on ice. But no one apparently ever sat down and worked out what the film was supposed to be. If it was supposed to be an exercise in making a new silent film in the old style, it just didn't happen. And who would care, anyway, outside of a film class assignment.

If it was supposed to be a new form of silent film, at least it wasn't the classic style. But again, who cares? It wasn't any kind of new story. Tiresome.

If it was supposed to be a film about the silent film era, it was seriously marred by the inept attempt to emulate the old silent genre.

Yes, it won Oscars. But note that you can win Oscars any day with a halfway competent film about the film industry. SAG people are such narcissists.

4980154,5,B00695E1BY,"I sat down this evening to watch THE ARTIST on blu-ray. First there were five previews of other films, such as IRON LADY, with blaring soundtrack, which hurt my ears, but I left the volume on my usual setting. Finally the menu arrived, with a snappy bit of music. I selected PLAY, which is what I wanted to do in the first place, and then the film began. The opening credits were fuzzy, on purpose, to simulate how silent films look on VHS. Great! Blu-ray for this? Then I noticed that the soundtrack was set on a very low volume. Checking, yes, it's supposed to be a HD-Master 5.1 soundtrack, but what little sound there is seems to be coming out of the center speaker. There have been Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtracks for silent-film DVDs with much better quality sound. Then, just as I was hunkering down really to dislike this film, here comes the magnificent opening scene with the screening of the fictional RUSSIAN AFFAIR film in a movie theater with live orchestra, followed by the vaudeville routine with the dog. The hostility between the wife and the dog is something palpable. They don't want to share the same man! I did laugh. There then unfolds a series of scenes with really impressive cinematography--and silent films above all are nothing without the cinematographer. About half an hour into the movie is an incredible side-shot of a complex stairwell, with people coming and going, all as a backdrop for a meeting between the two principals. For that scene alone, the film deserves all the honors it can get, and takes a place in film history, IMHO. Yes, I'm still a bit cranky. Sound was introduced into movies in 1927, not in 1929 as the film portrays. The target audience for a film like this will surely know this, so why bend their universe? The HOLLYWOODLAND sign above the studios tell us that this is an alternative universe. Yet the script's conflation of four tragedies on October 25, 1929--financial, marital, professional and personal--seems like piling on. As you see, I try to talk myself into disliking this film. The trouble is, I don't convince myself. Otherwise, why would I be upset that the film was not widescreen, unless I really wanted to see more of it? I think it is a great film that was over-tampered with in post-production. But then, much more drastic things of the same kind happened to GREED, FOOLISH WIVES and MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, and yet each of them remains a masterpiece. This is a film I will have to see two or three times to know if it grows on me. At this point I think I might not want to do without it.
AFTER SECOND VIEWING:
Well, I found out after posting my review that the film had won five Oscars--""That's a horse on me!"" (Tim Holt in MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS). Give me time--I may catch up with events! (Is this film about me?)  Last night I put the blu-ray in to watch a second time. This time I skipped the previews, and that helped get into the film itself, but the menu music should have been turned down to match the volume on the film itself. For the menu music to spoil the opening mood is a frequent fault of DVD and blu-ray mastering. The soundtrack didn't seem so muted this time as before, but still--if the soundtrack won an Oscar, then it is nothing to be shy about. Bring it on! The opening titles were still too fuzzy, but the intertitles within the film itself were crisp and clear. The title character is a little bit of Rudolph Valentino (the name), Douglas Fairbanks (the swashbuckling sequence), Ramon Novarro (the silent star with a foreign accent), Maurice Chevalier (a French accent) and Fred Astaire (the dance routine--very well done). The female lead is closest, I think, to Clara Bow's in WINGS. During the late Twenties, films were featuring fallen women or liberated women, and even Clara Bow had a scene in WINGS where she impersonated a fallen women. But the female lead in THE ARTIST is a ""good person"" as the butler says. She avoids all their character flaws while combining the awestruck fan, the ambitious understudy, etc. She avoids every clich and is always a real person at every stage of the film. Her one lapse is talking silly in an interview, but that is certainly an easy temptation to fall into. Even career politicians put their feet into their mouths often enough. I do not consider her having ""toy boys"" around her a character lapse, since she labels it herself. They are caricatures, but she is not.
About the widescreen issue. There were experiments with widescreen in the late Twenties and early Thirties. One concluding reel of Abel Gance's NAPOLEON (1927) is split-screen, a triptych of images. BAT WHISPERS (1932) was released in both standard and Magnoscope versions. I tried streching THE ARTIST out to the width of my TV, and it worked well nearly all of the time. I felt that it enhanced the effect of the film, except when it chopped off people's foreheads or feet. I hate that sort of thing, so I won't try it again.
So I am sorry that the award-winning soundtrack and award-winning cinematography are kept muted, but the film won the top awards anyway, so who am I to complain? Only two silent films have ever won the Best Film award--THE ARTIST and WINGS, both of them now on fine blu-rays (WINGS skipped DVD altogether and leapfrogged directly from laserdisc to blu-ray). Both films had recorded soundtracks so they weren't entirely soundless. For those of us who love silent film and have collected whatever fragments survive of the film heritage of that era, it is a great thing to see a year like 2012 in which a new silent film takes the top honors. I'm glad I found out before the year was over. I will try to pay better attention next year.
Anyway, after the second viewing, I am sure there will be a third and a fourth and so on. THE ARTIST is an instant classic, and I most assuredly will not want to do without it.",1342828800,7,5846,4.6049856184084375
4980155,4,B00695E1BY,"This is a good movie, but it typically one that is overrated because it shows some kind of class, intellect and refinement to proclaim itself as genius. The production starts with 3 strikes against it. First, at times, it is a movie within a movie. Second, it is in black and white, and third, it is mostly all silent. With all the rave, I was willing to attempt an open mind viewing (zombie films are sometimes in black and white too).

These techniques were done to to give us the flavor of the films of the era. Even though those restored masters are available, who among the 5 star rave reviewers watch them? You could list them on one hand, or maybe one finger. In the silent era, the jokes were visual. The sound track created the mood, more so than it does today, and actors had to make dramatic movements to create emotions. They used their face...a term called ""mugging"" in the film. This was brilliantly brought out in the film, although we already knew that.

The film uses symbolism, such as when our star George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin)career is sinking, it shows him in a film sinking in quicksand. Good yes. Genius? Hardly. The script reminded me of ""A Star is Born"" (pick one) where a star launches the career of a new star only to see his fade. George is ""The Artist"" who believes talkies are not art. Besides the studio no longer wants George. They want fresh faces such as rising star Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo).

I liked the idea of doing the silent movie film to show us the transition from silent to talkies, I just didn't like the predictable script. Plot is important.

4980158,4,B00695E1BY,"There's always a risk with a movie like ""The Artist"" that it will become all about the gimmick and nothing more.  But Michel Hazanavicius's modern-day re-creation of a black-and-white silent film is so adroitly executed and artistically wrought that it transcends the gimmick and becomes an impressive work in its own right.

Set in the late `20s and early `30s, the period when moviemaking was transitioning from silents to talkies, the movie focuses on George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a dapper matinee-idol who `s more devoted to his dog - the scene-stealing Uggie - than to his acting partner/wife (Penelope Ann Miller).  The problem is that Valentin seems more suited to the silent screen than the sound one - we learn why at the end - so we watch as his career and his personal life take a turn for the worse throughout the course of the story.  If that sounds a bit like the premise of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" you're right, but the movie also has a touch of ""A Star is Born"" about it, for as Valentin's career goes into an ever-increasing death-spiral, the beautiful young ingenue (Berenice Bejo) he helped to discover has taken to the talkies like gang-busters and is becoming a major star of the silver screen.  (One can also find a couple of homages to ""Citizen Kane,"" but they're a little less obvious).

""The Artist"" is obviously of most interest to those with a love of cinema and movie history, as it re-creates in breathtakingly beautiful terms the look and sound of silent movies (the tinkling-piano score is by Ludovic Bource).  The movie is pure joy to look at, thanks to the eye-popping cinematography of Guillaume Schiffman, which captures the otherworldly elegance of a world framed in black-and-white images. The story may strike some as facile and simplistic to say the least, but that's clearly in keeping with the temper of the times and the era of motion picture history in which it is set.  I could have done with a little more of the behind-the-camera glimpses into old-time moviemaking and a little less of the foreground romance, but that is a minor quibble in a movie that works on so many other levels.  One of those is the acting, with Dujardin and Bejo managing to create effective characters with only a minimum of mugging, and John Goodman and James Cromwell doing the same in supporting roles.  And little Uggie, who also appeared in ""Mr. Fix-it"" and ""Water for Elephants,"" puts Toto and Rin Tin Tin to shame in the canine-acting division.

With movies like ""Moneyball,"" ""The Descendents"" and ""The Tree of Life"" hanging around, I wouldn't have voted for ""The Artist"" as the Best Picture of 2011, but I wouldn't have missed the one-of-a-kind visual experience it affords for anything in the world.",1342569600,2,2732,4.791489361702127
4980159,5,B00695E1BY,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Every couple of years there comes a movie that shakes up the industry, and The Artist is one of those films. When I originally saw the trailer I automatically wanted to see it. Me being 19 years old I missed out on the Black and White/Silent film era. So for me watching this movie was experiencing a part of history. Yes, the film did receive a lot of hype based around two things: the fact that it was black and white and the fact that it was, for the most part, silent. But once you watch the film you realize just how amazing the story is.

You follow George Valentine (Jean Dujardin) who is a silent film actor. But he's not just any silent film actor, he's one of the biggest. The story starts in 1927 at the premiere of his new film, where he bumps into Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo) who will eventually become a big name in the film industry. A few years later Al Zimmer (John Goodman) informs George that they are terminating the creation of silent films and are moving on to talkies. George does not take the news well and decides to fund the production of his new film, which bombs. Leaving George broke. I won't go into further detail so as not to ruin it for those who haven't yet seen the film.

On the surface it's a simple, yet enjoyable, film. But if you dig deeper it's a big reflection on society's struggle to adapt and accept change. We as humans have a hard time with change, and so we desperately try to cling to what we're comfortable with. It's a concept that I felt was extremely well done. The acting was top notch, as was the music, and the cast was excellent. I enjoyed finding some other, lesser known, actors within the film. (Joel Murray and Bill Fagerbakke both have small appearances.)

Overall Score: 10/10 - This film is truly a joy to watch and deserves every award that it won. It was a risky move to create not only a black and white film, but a silent film as well. However, I feel they pulled it off. It's amazing to see that without dialogue just how important the acting becomes.

4980161,5,B00695E1BY,"There are many who would have been stunned when they heard that a silent movie won for best picture in 2012 at the Oscars. Okay I admit I was one of those people. But after having had the chance to see the film it made me think that perhaps Hollywood granted the award for two reasons: one, because it is a great film and two, because it is a love note to the Golden Age of Hollywood.

The film is about the career of silent screen idol George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a swashbuckling/dancing/sly grinned matinee idol if there ever was one. When the film starts George is at the top of his game and the biggest box office draw around. Along with his pet pouch he's the talk of the town and a hit with everyone.

One day while signing autographs he literally bumps into a young woman named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo). At first surprised he passes it off with a laugh and the two go on their way. Except that now the press is all abuzz wondering who this mystery woman is, something that Mrs. Valentin (Penelope Ann Miller) isn't pleased with.

As the film progresses the paths of George and Peppy cross once more when they meet on the set of his next film where she's an extra. They playfully dance back and forth much to the displeasure of the head of the studio (John Goodman). When he attempts to toss her off the lot, George steps in and defends her. This is much to her good fortune as the roles she receives increase and her popularity grows as well.

The same can't be said of George. When Goodman shows him the latest thing to hit Hollywood, sound, George laughs it off and gloats that he's never needed sound to reach and audience. When the studio switches to sound only, George is tossed aside as old. He promises to show them how great silent films are by starring in, directing, writing and producing his next film. Opening the same day as the new Peppy Miller film, it draws a few people against the lines waiting to see her film.

Down and out and nearly penniless after the stock market crash, George's wife leaves him. Only his trusted chauffer Clifton (James Cromwell) stays by his side until George finally fires him due to no money with which to pay him. George sells off everything he has and finds little to keep him going.

At the same time the fortunes of Peppy Miller are skyrocketing. Little known to George so are her emotions for him. It will only be a matter of time before these star crossed lovers finally meet once more.

It seems like such a simple story, perhaps a bit of A STAR IS BORN, tossed in as well. But this is no remake and yes, the story is quite simple. But that doesn't make it the least bit boring. Instead it's a tremendous piece of storytelling that makes the viewer use their eyes to get the story. The music enhances the action on the screen just as it was in the silent era. The composition of what we are viewing is something we could take for granted or perhaps we have the chance to see how visually stimulating it can be, even in black and white.

The film ends with a dance number straight out of the old Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers playbook. Unfortunately there will be far too many viewers who won't even know who Astaire and Rogers were which is kind of sad because there are so many great movies that just aren't the thing these days. Younger viewers ignore films that are black and white. They have no desire to watch a film that is ""silent"" (even though the score to this movie is fantastic). It's much easier to watch a movie with tons of explosions or sparkling vampires than it is to invest oneself in a love story like this one.

That's a big loss for this generation. They don't know about the high flying adventures of Captain Blood or the deeply romantic loss felt by Rick in a town named Casablanca. They'll never know the charm of Nick and Nora Charles as they solve crimes or the horror displayed by an actor named Karloff. This movie might change that though. Perhaps after watching and enjoying this film the younger generation might be interested enough to seek out those classics. One can only hope. And if not, at least they'll be entertained by this film. It deserved the attention it received.",1342569600,11,4173,4.423177083333333
4980162,5,B00695E1BY,"ALRIGHT! Before some people go around attacking me for rating this 5, let me make a few things clear: whose not a film critic, just a movie fanatic, and is in his 20's?

BOOM! THIS GUY!

The Artist is not the movie i wouldve picked to win best picture 2011(harry potter 7 part 2, my best winner in case ur wondering), but the movie, even as a black and white silent film, is anything but stupid. The movie taking place in the 1920's, the long finished era of silent movies, follows George Valentin who is a silent film superstar who enjoys his life in the kind of movie world he revels in, but has time moves forward, a new era of movies is born: movies with people that talk(ya, ya! stating the obvious lol). George feels the talking movie generation is a bad joke that people aren't going for, and then a new actress Peppy Miller, who is actually introduced in the early going of the movie, is the new face of the talking movie industry.

The intro of the talking era pretty much sends George into self-destruction, and the movie makes u sympathize with his issue, becuz the world around him he once knew is slowly falling away, his wife files for divorce(loveless marriage anyways, so who gives a rip), he soon fires his agent. It just sucks what happens. I won't give anything on the outcome of this, but i will say what happens toward the end of the artist did hit me hard.

My suggestion if ur on fence of watching this is to just rent or buy like I did. Again, Im just a movie fanatic who gave this a 5 becuz i really did enjoy the movie, and i still enjoy those other cool movies we get like the avengers, the batman movies, all that good stuff. Any naysaying comment i get on this is just telling me the naysayer is superficial, and cant even bother giving this at least 1 chance. So what if its B&W? Its a damn movie!! I would say not to attack my review if u don't agree with my opinion of the movie, but if u don't agree with my thoughts, well what the hell are u doing reading this anyways?!",1342396800,2,2004,4.238219895287958

The idea seemed strange and stupid to me because so many people like me hate to read while watching movies. BUT after the first 15 minutes watching you forget the film is silent. It takes place round the late 1920's to early 30""s and because the film is done in silence and black and white you feel like your really watching a movie from that time period. Using unfamiliar actors for the star roles made this much easier, although John Goodman is in it. I gave this film 5 stars because it was a great film !!! It was different in every way from how movies are made today with poor dialogue relying more on visual effects to make the film entertaining. Instead this film has no dialogue and no visual effects, and your still entertained. The actors did a great job making you feel what they were feeling through expression and body language.

4980165,5,B00695E1BY,"The 2011 Academy Awards gave this film Best Picture. You can decide if it was well deserved or not.

It's told almost entirely as a black and white silent film with what would be considered over the top facial gestures (something that was really done in those days because there was no dialogue) with brief chatter on card shots and music to emphasize the various moods. It's a throwback to the glory days of silent film but also cleverly allows the viewer to experience an ""updated"" silent film. It's magical, dreamlike and sometimes even glorious in certain incidents (pay attention to the main character's pet dog, Ubbie) even if the story is overly predictable. I found the choice of music scores quite impressive.

George Valentin (Rudolph Valentino anyone?), our main character, played by actor Jean Dujardin is the ever popular charming yet arguably narcissistic lead man who refuses to accept that silent films are coming to an end. His love interest, Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo), rises to fame as a star for the ""talkies"" while George's own stardom falls, leading to his depression, financial ruin and then possible renewal.

The director has called this film a ""love letter"" to the silent film cinema. Jean Dujardin picked up a well deserved Best Actor (you have to ""get"" the silent film era to understand what a splendid job he did)  and is the first French actor to receive an Academy Award in that department. Incidentally, this is the first French film to win Best Picture as well (compare this picture to the previously nominated ""Life is Beautiful"" picture). Berenice Bejo is the oh so pretty love interest who intends to make it big and feels herself strongly drawn to the older male lead. Also starring John Goodman (the no nonsense studio boss), Malcolm McDowell (the butler), Penelope Ann Miller (George's irritating wife) and James Cromwell (the dutiful chauffeur).

This picture took roughly 35 days to film and was presented in the typical silent film 1:33:1 ratio. There are strong themes in this film about change and how those who don't change suffer yet those who adapt bounce back and sometimes do even better. It is also obviously a nostalgic look at an era long gone. People who enjoyed this film's focus on the loss of the silent film to ""talkies"" might also enjoy the 1950 ""Sunset Boulevard"" as well as the 1937 ""A Star is Born"" (which has a very similar story line to ""The Artist"" though more bittersweet).

The budget for this film was only $15M yet it made over $133M at the Box Office. It garnered Best Director from the Academy Awards and was pretty much loved by almost all of the other critics and award givers.

4980166,4,B00695E1BY,"The Artist premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and slowly descended into the public consciousness. Within a few months it was one of the most acclaimed movies of the year and would ultimately steal the thunder of all other major films, leading up to it winning five Academy Awards including Best Picture. Of course, as I'm sure you're aware by now, The Artist is a silent film in black & white. This could've been a gimmick, a quick experiment that would've faded from memory soon after its release. I believe the secret to the film's success is how close it sticks to the mechanics of silent cinema and the wholly apparent love that writer/director Michel Hazanavicius has for silent cinema. It transcends mere gimmickry. Is The Artist the best film of 2011? Not in my opinion. But it is a terrific film that I'm pleased to see acknowledged in this industry.

The plot is nothing particularly innovative, but you can't pay homage to silent cinema with a layered, intricate plot. The film spans 1927 (when The Jazz Singer debuted as the first film with sound) through 1932. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a star promoting his latest hit film when he crosses paths with Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo). Soon, George champions her for a role in his latest film despite protests from Kinograph Studios' head Al Zimmer (John Goodman). As Peppy rises through the industry, Zimmer announces that Kinograph will begin producing films with sound exclusively. George remonstrates, but soon finds his star fading while Peppy becomes Hollywood's latest star.

Aside from Best Picture, The Artist won four additional Academy Awards for Best Actor (Jean Dujardin), Best Director, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score. These awards are well-deserved. Dujardin, with his winning smile, fully assumes the role of a silent film star and gives a memorable, lively performance while only speaking 3 words in the entire film. Bejo, a nominee for Best Actress, deserves equal praise. With no dialogue to guide them, these modern actors must rely completely on their physical ability to create their characters and they all prove to be remarkably gifted. The new faces and the veteran actors like Goodman and James Cromwell all deserve accolades for their work. I include the dog, Jack, in this statement. He's one of the more lovable animals of recent cinema.

The Artist is a love letter to silent film, but it looks and feels like the real thing. Because of this, a lot of people will hate it on principle. I can't imagine a lover of cinema disliking the film however. Besides, it's remarkably accessible in part because of how charming it is. Those weary of silent films may want to put aside their bias for a moment. The Oscar-winning score is a huge part of the film, essentially the driving force, and it's totally memorable and catchy. On a technical level, The Artist has few missteps; it's beautifully photographed, choreographed, and the art direction is stunning.

I'm glad The Artist won Best Picture, despite the fact that I don't think it was the best film of 2011. It is a jubilant tribute to the magic of classic cinema and is ultimately a magical, if somewhat underwhelming film.",1342137600,2,3189,4.9

A French film about silent movies in Hollywood done in black and white ...

I saw this on the airplane coming back from Europe.  The mostly French passengers were going wild during the film, laughing at nearly every nuance, a glance, a crumpled bit of paper, ... I felt like I had inadvertently walked into a Jerry Lewis movie marathon.

If you enjoy artistic films, if you watched ""Shadow of the Vampire"" 37 times with the director's commentary on then this film is for you.

If you've ever enjoyed a Bruce Willis film, if you liked Battlestar Galactica then it will be a chore to watch this film.

The film academy doesn't always select film for an award based on popular appeal; in fact occasionally the choice is inscrutable, ""Midnight Cowboy"" anyone?

Like opera, you're likely to love or hate this film with little middle ground.

I'm not a fan of most opera.

4980168,2,B00695E1BY,"The Artist is a seriously disappointing movie and I do not understand how it won even one Oscar. A silent movie star is eclipsed by the advent of talking films and sinks into a drunken slovenly depression and is finally rescued by another star, a woman whose career he helped to launch. That's it. There are no subplots, nothing else, no surprises, no messing with our minds, no dark corners where we might not want to be taken. The story line is flat and linear and just boring. Who cares if the cinematography is excellent? This is a lazy film.",1341964800,4,546,4.47
4980169,5,B00695E1BY,"""The Artist"" almost dares moviegoers to see it.  It's a black-and-white silent picture shot in the old standard boxy aspect ratio, much as movies were made and exhibited until sound, color, and widescreen transformed cinema dramatically.  Mel Brooks played with the idea for comic effect in 1976's ""Silent Movie,"" incorporating a slew of big-name actors to boost box office.  In contrast, ""The Artist,"" a foreign film about old Hollywood, offers no superstars and does not strain after jokes.  Instead, a touching script, the humanity of its characters, and the talent of its principals turn this unusual project into a commercially viable movie.

The time period spans 1927 to 1932, a time of enormous upheaval in Hollywood.  ""The Jazz Singer,"" the first talkie, hit screens in October, 1927, and sounded the death knell for silent pictures.  Some silent film makers and stars succeeded brilliantly, many did not, and opportunity boomed for new talent.  ""The Artist"" focuses on two characters whose Hollywood careers move in opposite directions.  George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a Chaplin-like star of the silent era.  He gives a fan of his, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), her first break in show biz. In 1929, the head of the studio, Al Zimmer (John Goodman), announces that the studio is ceasing all silent film production and getting on the talkie bandwagon. As Valentin resists the change to sound, his star dims while Peppy's career blossoms.

There are clearly plot similarities to ""A Star Is Born,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and any backstage picture in which the ambitious, talented kid makes good.  But ""The Artist"" has a tremendous charm all its own.  The old-fashioned filming techniques become secondary to the story, which is a simple tale told extremely well and with great humor.

Dujardin is a master of physical comedy and will remind the viewer of those little moments in Chaplin films when he enacts a comic bit, such as the dance of the rolls in ""The Gold Rush"" or his roller skating acrobatics in ""The Rink.""  Dujardin's Valentin is an agile performer and a snappy dancer who can enchant an audience by improvising a series of hilarious curtain calls.  He loves his star status and regards the coming of sound as a threat.

Peppy, on the other hand, is as game for the challenge of sound as she is talented and charming. Pretty, spunky, with an ebullient personality and a mischievous twinkle in her eye, she lights up the screen.  Ms. Bejo is a wonder. She has a face made for movies;  when she's on screen you can't take your eyes off her.  Reminiscent of the young Mary Tyler Moore and Debbie Reynolds, she is perky, frisky, and adorable.

There is also on hand one of the funniest canine stars in years -- Valentin's dog, who not only appears with him in movies, but also is his constant companion, whether at home, attending a premiere, or sitting in a movie theatre.  The dog is always at his side and goes into Lassie-mode when Valentin's life is in danger, insisting that a cop follow him to the rescue.

Director Michel Hazanavicius has taken great care in presenting the period of the Roaring Twenties and beginning of the Depression. Costuming and set design, down to the vintage film equipment depicted, are flawlessly incorporated. The actors perform in the style of the silent era, but the director strikes exactly the right balance to keep the movie from becoming a spoof.  That would be very easy.  It's far richer as it shifts from broad comedy leading to elements of tragedy before culminating in one of the best movie finales of the year.

It's rare for a movie to be this exhilarating.  As you watch ""The Artist,"" you are simultaneously entertained, impressed, moved, and overjoyed.  When a film does all that, it must be attributed to creative genius -- the perfect blending of script, performance, and direction. This is one such case when everything comes together to produce a perfect movie.

What makes ""The Artist"" more than just a gimmick film is its sincerity and obvious love of cinema.  It transports us to a distant era and treats its characters as real people, not cliches.  Director Hazanavicius has created a loving tribute to the medium of film that both celebrates the past and acknowledges the inevitability of progress.

Blu-ray extras include a 22-minute overview of the film's production; the featurette ""Hollywood as a Character;"" short vignettes dedicated to production design, cinematography, costuming, and the musical score;  blooper reel; and a 45-minute on-stage Q & A with the stars, director and producer.",1341964800,5,4575,4.938562091503268
4980170,3,B00695E1BY,"I'm a silent movie lover, so I was excited to see ""The Artist"". While it's generally a very cute, heart-felt movie, it does have its flaws. The film begins as a romantic comedy between a popular silent film star named George and a new actress named Peppy trying to make her way to the top. The chemistry between them is wonderful. However when sound comes to film, their roles are reversed. George refuses to do sound films, and he pays dearly for it. Peppy, on the other hand, becomes a big name actress. What was once a fun, romantic comedy turns into a depressing melodrama that drags on too long. This part of the film could have been significantly shortened without harming the story or character development at all. Instead, it ends up dragging down the film.

As far as the overall look and historical accuracy of the film, it's pretty top-notch, although it has the look of a film from the 30's rather than the 20's. The styles and costumes are spot-on for the most part, although I would have liked to see the clothing styles change as the film progressed into the early 30's (Peppy's gowns should have been ankle length instead of knee length towards the end). Not only would it have been more accurate, it would have demonstrated the progression of time more clearly. Also, while Berenice Bejo turned in an excellent, emotional performance as Peppy, her look is too Latin (she's from Argentina) to match the more Anglo look of popular actresses from that time period. No doubt being married to the director had a little to do with her casting. Jean Dujardin, however, looks like he was plucked directly out of the time period.

I'm only being nit-picky because I was expecting great things from this movie, but it ended up falling a bit short of expectations. However, I'm very glad someone decided to do a modern-day silent film. Kudos to the filmmakers!",1341878400,4,1866,4.668693009118541
4980171,1,B00695E1BY,"The first point I would like to make is that I have no objections to this film.  My only beef is with its soundtrack.  Do I mind the black and white?  No I don't.  Do I mind the 4x3 screen?  No I don't.  Do I mind that it's a silent?  No I don't.  These things are inconsequential to me.  I am quite used to all three, having grown up on a fare of old time Hollywood films.  Is this a great film?  No, I don't think it's a great film, but it's certainly a good film, and it's a cute film.  Manipulative?  Yes, but then aren't all films manipulative?  As far as a history lesson, there is nothing new to learn here.  Anyone familiar with the chaos that ensued when silents began to talk already knows what happened.  There are no revelations here.  This story might be revelatory to today's audiences, who are not familiar with the silent era, but it isn't to any real movie fan.  So yes, I liked the film.  And I loved Dujardin.  His amalgam of Chaplin and Fairbanks is wonderful to see.  And the bastard is damn sexy!  I haven't been so turned on by an actor in years.  Even if he is overweight.  It's a great performance.  His smile alone is worth the price of admission.  But I began to have a problem with the music early on when what appears to be a love theme in the film sounded to me very much like a variation of Kurt Weill's, Speak Low, from One Touch of Venus.  And then when it came to the sequence where the music from Vertigo is used, the film ceased to matter to me, and I just couldn't concentrate on anything but Bernard Herrmann's wonderful score.  Who is the idiot who decided to use such a well known piece of music as ""soundtrack underscoring""?  I have no objection to any piece of music being included in a film, as long as it is done properly.  Look at what Unchained Melody did for Ghost!  In The Artist we get a fabulous version of Pennies From Heaven which is delightful, and it actually adds to the film and works for the film.  But to use Herrmann's music as it is used here?  As if it were an original composition?  No can do.  I am afraid Kim Novak was right.  It is rape!  I understand it's legal rape, and by the credits I can see that the Vertigo soundtrack was properly licensed.  But it's rape nevertheless.  I hope this doesn't set a trend, because I'd hate to see the same thing happen to Steiner, Korngold, Raksin, Waxman, and all the other great composers from the golden age of film.  And please spare me any indignation about my use of the word rape.  It's a word like any other.  Get used to it!  It can depict a heinous act, or it can be used metaphorically.  Kim and I have used it metaphorically.  We don't need any feedback.  Free country.  And BRAVA! to Kim for her fabulous cojones.  Well done, Miss Novak!

++++After I wrote this review I did a little research on the lady who sings Pennies from Heaven.  I loved her version so much, that when I first watched the film, I actually stopped the DVD and went back to hear it a second time.  Her name was Rose Murphy, she was black, played the piano, and sang.  She was known as the Chi-Chi girl.  She recorded for RCA and Verve.  I had never heard of her, but I plan to get my hands on her recordings.  The woman was absolutely FABULOUS!

Well, playing it is sheer agony.  I own three Blu-Ray players, all high end.  On one player, it played the movie without sound (yes, I know it's a mostly-silent film, but it wouldn't play any of the background music at all).  The extras, however, played perfectly well.  Player #2 simply wouldn't read the disc and ejected it after repeated tries.  Player #3 played the disc.  However, getting to the movie is an ordeal.  First of all, the upload time is maddening and then moving through two separate sets of previews is frustrating.  Finally, when the movie was ready to play, it took what seemed like forever to begin.  And then when you stop, it doesn't remember where you left off (as it does with DVD's) -- you have to go through the entire nightmare again.  So, the movie is wonderful, but the Blu-Ray is terrible.

In any event the tonal palette is more gray and white than black and white, but this appears to have been the director's artistic choice.  If anyone is interested in seeing what a real black and white film can be like go watch the Ghost and Mrs. Muir -- even on a standard DVD it sparkles and shines.  In any event my biggest complaint is the blu ray DVD authoring.  Like so many blu ray disks it has too many previews at the beginning and the content owner makes it difficult to skip them.  How many times do I need to be subjected to the same stupid previews?  And as with so many blu ray disks it was authored without the ability to resume playback.  This means that everytime one stops the film to answer the phone, feed the kid or take a whiz the film starts over -- over with the same stupid previews that are hard to bypass.

The only reason I can see for someone in 2012 doing a movie in black and white with no spoken word is that the movie's merits can't stand on their own without a gimmick. Watching the first 30mins of the Artist was painful and really showed to me that most film critic's have the inability to differentiate between an artsy, made for critics, sundance j*rkfest movie vs one that people will actually sit through.

The best advice I can give is read the reviews, but not for just what they say, but for how they review it. If you find the positive reviewers seem to like the sound of their own voice and you don't really care what aspect ratio was used, then maybe you're like me and should give this one a miss..

4980181,5,B00695E1BY,"""The Artist"" impressed me in many ways: the writing, casting, acting; sets; costumes and more were all spot-on and the plot kept me glued to the screen. True, some may say that the acting was a bit overdone; and maybe these people are right. Nevertheless, I still think it's all well done because it's primarily a silent movie and during the era of silent film it was common for actors to emote quite a bit to compensate for the lack of dialogue. In addition, the musical score enhances this film.

When the story begins, we meet mega movie star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) who makes films--and money for Kinograph Studios. George is adored by the audiences and it truly seems he can do no wrong. Studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) loves George, too; George makes Kinograph look great and, as I mentioned, pulls in a lot of money for the studio so they can make more films. George has a close friend in his chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell) who is remarkably loyal. Unfortunately, however, George's life is not perfect--while he and his dog Uggie are very close, George's marriage to Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) becomes essentially loveless.

One day after a big premiere of George's latest movie in 1927, fans crowd around him with police holding them back. By accident, a fan named Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo) drops her purse and as she tries to retrieve it she literally bumps into George. George finds humor in this and Peppy gets noticed when a press photographer takes a photo with Peppy giving George a kiss on the cheek. Of course, George's wife Doris becomes furious and George uses his typical defense against Doris by fussing over Uggie at the breakfast table.

When her photo kissing George gets into the papers Peppy find work at the studio; slowly but surely she lands bigger and bigger roles. However, for George it's the exact opposite. George initially laughs off the idea of ""talkies"" but after Al Zimmer gives him the news that he is washed up at the studio for ""fresh meat"" who can talk in films George gradually becomes profoundly depressed and self-destructive.

I had a pretty good idea about how the story would end; but this film is so artfully done it held my full attention nonetheless. Jean Dujardin gives a tour-de-force performance as George and I won't forget that anytime soon. The chemistry between George and Peppy is excellent as well.

Look also for the film to pay a tribute to silent films with Uggie, the dog who would do anything for his master George; vivid facial expressions to compensate for the lack of dialogue and how it was filmed in the full screen ration of 1.33:1 which was standard for the silent film era.

The extras are also very good. I particularly enjoyed the ""making of"" featurette and the ""Q&A"" session with filmmakers and cast.

""The Artist"" is an excellent film that clearly deserved its ""Best Film"" award at the Oscars. I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes silent film; the history of how movies changed from silent to ""talkies"" and fans of the actors in this film will be thrilled. In addition, people who appreciate foreign dramas with some dark overtones will not be disappointed.",1341273600,3,3165,4.754098360655738
4980182,2,B00695E1BY,"I wasn't even aware of this film as I don't pay attention to the Oscars, but someone rented it and I watched wondering, 'where's the good part? when do they speak?' It seemed pretty obvious they would speak but I have to wonder why they waited until the end. And then it hit me, though the answer isn't as obvious as it first seems.

We're to believe the end is the icing on the cake. The main character has managed to somehow find a life in the new world. It's so exciting to hear him speak, right? But step back and look at the bigger picture. How might the film be different if he started speaking half-way through? Would the film be more interesting or less? Would sound, early on, have ruined the 'effect' this movie leans on throughout the entire length? I say it would but, that being the case, an homage to silent film using silence as a plot is a cheap effect. There are countless ways to express the same ideas in this movie using sound but I don't think the writer could pull it off. What's sadder is the idea that the silent era NEEDS homage. I could almost hear the director telling me, 'Gee, aren't silent movies quaint?' As though one can't pic a silent film up and enjoy it regardless of the lack of sound. Ever watch an old silent film? I've seen plenty and they can be moving. Perhaps what troubled me most is 'The Artist' hit the cheesy, cheeky and off-beat character of silent film but completely missed the real depth they were capable of. Good, moving stories were told in the silent era but not so here. The plot is so predictable it doesn't act as a true story so much as a conduit to play silent era 'dress up' and the 'acting' is so exaggerated it never allows an actor a chance to show any kind of range or sincere human emotion. We are given crude caricatures of silent film 'types' but never any of the substance that makes silent films and their stars still interesting today.

Others have mentioned the lighting was a poor afterthought or mistake and I agree. Everything looks so crisp, clear, clean and processed that the film feels as related to old black and white movies as much as a rocket ship is related to a mule. We are continually reminded 'this was made using the most high tech equipment possible. People making those silly old films couldn't even dream of the techniques we applied.', which makes it impossible to slip into the past. In some cases, props are completely wrong for the era they portray. At one point their clothing made me think the film had transitioned to the 1940's but they were still in the early 30's. It's as though historical relevance, accuracy and research weren't considered at all. Not that they must slavishly adhere to history but why not? Is the director convinced the actors could have worn Nike's and still conveyed the same message? Even the lead actress is too 'fit'. Silent movie actresses were never THAT slim. I often wonder why no attempt to make the film look, feel or seem 'old' was taken. If we're going for 'homage' why not try to add a little authenticity? Couldn't they make the music 'scratchy'? Ever watch the opening to 'Moulin Rouge'? It was in black and white and does what this project couldn't. An homage should pay tribute and good homages do, but this is more of a mockery.

On the plus, the story is cute, the actors look good, and John Goodman and the dog were exceptional with what they had to work with. That this won an Oscar just confirms my belief that Oscars are completely irrelevant.",1341187200,4,3490,4.467084639498433
4980183,3,B00695E1BY,"Silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardain) is on top of the Hollywoodland world until a random encounter with Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo) foreshadows the ascendancy of talkies, the gradual death of silent films, and Valentin's plummeting career.  The film's Valentin-centric portrayal is interesting because it's represents the desperate, somewhat stubborn manner in which Valentin fights inevitability.  Although, the end of the film alludes to why he may not have had a choice.

While ""The Artist"" was interesting, neither the homage nor the plot was original (which isn't to say they weren't appreciated).  The former was accomplished by Mel Brooks and the latter in roughly every other movie made.  It is compelling enough, however, that I didn't look away.  Perhaps that is part of the charm?  A viewer must fully invest in a silent film.  This holds particularly true in this case, because any skeptical viewer (like me) wants to unearth the reasons why so many awards were won.  I was compelled to comprehend why the movie was so rewarded.  I thought the film was decent, but certainly not deserving.  Michael Bay is proof that technology doesn't create a better movie.  I'd rather watch a ""The General"" with Buster Keaton than Transformers 2.  Having said that, however, there is a reason why silent films were overrun by talkies and why I scream at my family members when we play charades.  Pantomiming doesn't convey the full expression, intent, or emotion.

What the film lacks in sound and color the two leads mostly compensate.  Dujardain is mesmerizing as he hams it up, over-accentuating every facial movement, every smile, laugh, grimace.  Bejo is almost equally adept, but she more than makes up for it in pure beauty.  Both stars look the part, and if there were one award this film deserved it would be Best Supporting Actor for Uggie, the Jack Russell Terrier co-star.  One scene with Uggie and Dujardain at a dinner table is absolutely priceless, in any generation, with or without sound.  Impeccable timing.

Ultimately, Directory Michel Hazanavicius leaves viewers with nostalgia and respect for a bygone era.  Like his title character, Hazanavicius wishes to save, or at least respect, silent films of the past.  Eulogies are intended to aid listeners' - in this case, viewers' - memories.  To reacquaint the senses with what was once enjoyable.  To appreciate the innocence and the story-telling missing from many contemporary films with all the ""advantages.""",1341187200,9,2506,5.174129353233831
4980184,2,B00695E1BY,"Basically, it's a retelling of A Star is Born with some plot changes. This movie started well, ended well, and had a long stretch in the middle that was one after another episode of drinking and self-destruction, basically a long narrative of the main character's self-pity. I felt like yelling ""do an intervention with this guy, will you?"" That being said, there are some very clever bits of storytelling and acting. The dog was amazing but I was more worried for him than the human characters, especially with all that secondhand smoke he was inhaling.
There are a lot of films that play on human frailty as art, but in this film there were no insights or revelations about it, no play on the metaphor of sound vs silent, just one alcoholic downhill slide scene after another. At the end there was a deus ex machina twist that set it all aright, reminding me of MGM resolving a plot with a musical number.
If you can keep your aesthetic distance from this film you may enjoy the filmmaker's craft and a few nice story points, like the beauty mark. After all the hype, I was disappointed, except for the dog, who was great.",1341187200,5,1124,4.541871921182266

You certainly don't have to be a silent film lover or a fan of period films to enjoy this picture, although I'm sure that helps.  While most movies nowadays would delve into heavy computer generated imagery to re-create the era, this film seems to completely aviod that pitfall, or at least from what I could tell.  Funny thing... the cinema world converted to panoramic films all in the name of art, and now to see film makers switching back to the full screen ratio and all in the name of art again I find very ironic.

4980186,4,B00695E1BY,"I'll be honest, I went into The Artist a bit skeptical. From reviews I had previously read, and all of the film's press and marketing, I was expecting a pretty straightforward homage to classic silent film without really bringing anything new or inventive to the genre.

Sadly, upon finishing the film, I found my initial suspicions to be quite wholly confirmed. But I won't go into that yet. Let's first be positive.

Make no mistake, The Artist IS a good movie. A very solid 3/4, 4/5, 7/10, however you'd like to rate it, and I would never advise anyone NOT to see it, it's worth at least one viewing, and can be entertaining enough to own.

The best part of the film is, quite obviously, its concept; it is very much a perfect representation of silent filmmaking, from its 1.33:1 aspect ratio, to its spectacular cinematography, to its actors' signature physical overacting that has always been a hallmark of silent films...it's the complete package in that respect.

However, as much I love visuals, they aren't everything, of course; story matters, and it's the story that I found severely lacking with The Artist. The general premise of the film is a very familiar one; an aging silent film star struggles against the incoming onslaught of the new medium of ""talking pictures"".

The first thing I immediately noticed was just how similar this concept was to Singin' in the Rain in many respects, even Jean Dujardin brings in shades of Gene Kelly in his performance, and the overall subtext over the death of silent pictures is near identical to the ground Singin' in the Rain had already covered some 50 years ago.

The second flaw is, well, this overall concept really isn't enough to make a thoroughly compelling and engaging story. Singin' in the Rain had music and dancing and several other brilliant examples of '50s filmmaking to augment and improve the story. Without those integrals, The Artist ends up seeming overly simplistic and without a great amount of emotion engagement or value - and, outside of its main character - all of the supporting cast end up being portrayed more as charactures than living, breathing individuals.

But perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the production is how badly it squandered the incredible potential that the concept inherently possesses. The writer/director seemed to almost entirely overlook most intriguing and valuable aspect of the story; the comparative differences between silent movies and ""talkies"".

For those with a great knowledge of classic and silent film, the advent of audio brought with it several distinct disadvantages that - now 80 years later - we've nearly entirely forgotten about. When you remove sound, and dialogue from a movie, as a director, you're forced to rely on and convey your story and moral points largely through visual metaphors and the physical, facial acting of your cast. As the ability to convey our stories through dialogue has become the norm, directors and actors alike have largely abandoned the purely visual storytelling of the silent film era.

What I personally would've liked to see The Artist deal with, is that contrast between those two styles of filmmaking; highlight the various advantages and disadvantages to both, showcase what makes silent films so unique, and weave in some subtext about what we've really lost creatively due to the invention of sound in films.

But, unfortunately, the director very rarely touches on any of these themes, and ultimately seems more interested in telling the entirely basic tale of the main actor's descent into depression than anything more meaningful or expansive about the genre itself. Which is surprising, considering French directors are usually known for their complexity and large philosophical scope.

Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I was more concerned own wishes for the film than what it actually was. Whatever the reason, I completed my viewing of The Artist entertained, but never quite satisfied.",1341100800,,3971,5.056574923547401
4980187,5,B00695E1BY,"I saw THE ARTIST in a theater in Fairfax, VA, in January, and the audience loved it so much that they stood up and cheered at the end, which I haven't seen in a movie theater in many a year.  I'm so glad that the film is finally out on DVD and Blu-ray.

The film, which deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture, is set in late 1920s-early 1930s Hollywood.  It follows the career of silent-film vaudevillian George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), once a big star at Kinograph Studios, as he struggles with the transition to talking pictures. He also seems to be more devoted to his dog (Uggie), than to his wife, Doris (Penelope Ann Miller).  Along the way, he meets a young film extra, Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo), at a premiere.  When Variety, the show-biz paper (then and now), prints a picture of Peppy kissing George, Doris is fit to be tied, and that incident, along with his excessive devotion to his dog, eventually leads to the breakup of his marriage.

When Kinograph Studios phases out silent films in favor of talkies, George blows them off, saying that talkies are a gimmick that will never catch on, and leaves the studio to produce his own independent silent film (which flops).  Meanwhile, Peppy signs with Kinograph and becomes a huge star in the early talkies.  George has a nightmare about sound films in which the extras laugh at him (the only sound sequence until the end of the film), his marriage is over, he is forced to fire his longtime butler (James Cromwell), and he becomes despondent and attempts suicide by burning his silent-film collection (which sets his house on fire).  Fortunately, the dog escapes from the house and manages to get his master rescued.

Meanwhile, Peppy, who has fallen in love with George, offers him a place to stay at her house to enable him to recover from his injuries.  After blackmailing the executives at Kinograph Studios, she convinces them to give Valentin the script for the studio's new musical.  Valentin still does not want to do it, and attempts suicide again (this time with a gun) while Peppy is at the studio.  Fortunately, the attempt is unsuccessful, and Peppy arrives at the house, insisting that she help him.  Although George finally realizes that Peppy loves him (and vice versa), he still believes that no one wants to hear him talk, but she insists that he try something and asks him to trust her.  Back at Kinograph Studios, the two perform a stunning tap-dance number, and the studio executives love it, which brings the film to a satisfying conclusion that brought the theater's audience to its feet.  Dujardin and Bejo, who are not professionally trained dancers, took five months of intensive tap instruction to learn the two-minute routine, yet they look like they have danced their whole lives.  The routine reminds me of Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell's famous tap duet, which appeared originally in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broadway-Melody-of-1940/dp/B00008AOWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broadway Melody of 1940</a>, and was also featured in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-s-Entertainment/dp/B0002OXVD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That's Entertainment</a>, although the Dujardin-Bejo number is not as long as the Astaire-Powell number, and does not have an ""a cappella"" sequence.

Dujardin and Bejo are superb, as are the rest of the film's cast, including Cromwell, Miller, Uggie the dog, John Goodman, Missi Pyle, and others.

Extras on the DVD include three featurettes, a blooper reel, and a very interesting Q&A session with some of the cast members.

A change story of the challenges in adaptive change and the consequences when you fail. In this case the silent actors who had relied on expression to communicate found the microphone and/or their voice to be a difficult hurdle in the new world of talkies.

A history story in that we don't really know a subject until we know it's history. The stars of the silents either succeeded or failed to adapt in the early '30s to the world of sound. Clara Bow (about talkies, ""they're stiff and limiting""), Mary Pickford, Garbo, Fairbanks, Chaplin, Valentino.

When we lose the crutch of language to simplify the task of understanding then how much more our brains have to search out other clues; to be alert to nuances of gesture and expression. ""The Artist"" is an exercise in utilizing those dormant areas of our brains.

If there were no such thing as the Academy Awards, if I had just picked up this movie and watched it with no expectations, I would have liked it, thinking it a well-produced, well-acted movie, and, more importantly, a refreshing departure from word-heavy, action-heavy modern fluff.

I can see, too, why it won Best Picture. Oscars' voters eat up qualities like ""well-produced"" and ""well-acted"" and ""innovative while respecting tradition,"" and The Artist probably especially appealed to voters because of its many winks to film history.

This is a nice, pretty-looking, nostalgic, popcorn movie. I was expecting it to be more. I was expecting it to do what great films do, which is to say something about what it means to be human, to show an intensified version of reality.

4980195,4,B00695E1BY,"The Artist is about as charming and innocent a movie as you will come across in these 2010s.  It is effective yet simple in this story of a silent film star and the young newcomer he helps, and when his career is wiped off the face of the earth, her star is ascending.  It's sort of a new/old version of A Star Is Born, but without the depressing drama of that 1937/1954/1976 story.  The cast is wonderfully charming, and the quality with which they captured Hollywood of the silent/early sound era is astounding.  (With one small problem, The Jazz Singer was 1927, not 1929.  It seems obvious they said 1929 so they could combine it with the stock market crash that year.)

And for classic film fans, no, you are not imagining you are hearing Bernard Herrmann's Love Theme from Vertigo in a lengthy piece near the end of The Artist.  That is it.

While I really enjoyed the film, I don't feel it was worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.  I still think that should have gone to another film about the early days of cinema, Hugo.

On the video front, I really want to applaud the producers/director for presenting it in the 4:3 format.  It is perfect for the subject matter.  The black and white video is superb, and I am also glad one of the behind-the-scenes shorts talked briefly about how odd choices of color for the clothes were important because they had to look right in black and white.  So many people forget about that when they think colorizing an old blank and white movie is okay.  The colors they add aren't likely what the true colors were used for black and white film.  (Did you know that in the 1950s, George Reeves' Superman costume for the black and white TV episodes was actually gray and brown, not red and blue?)

Audio is superb.  You might nt think it important for a silent film, but, in actual fact, it takes on an extra importance.

The extras were all enjoyable, though some portions overlap into the others:

The Artist: The Making of An American Romance - excellent behind the scenes documentary

Q&A with the Filmmakers and Cast - this was 45 minutes at a special screening.  Though it did drag a bit, Missi Pyle (Galaxy Quest) is a delight and I'd like there to have been more of her in the film.

Hollywood As A Character: The Locations of The Artist - this runs obly a few minutes and I would have loved for it to be longer.  I find it fascinating looking at how they took L.A. landmarks and manipulated them into the film's silent era.

The Artisans Behind The Artist - Again, too brief a look at the crew who created the look of the film.

Bloopers - more, not less, should have been the word here.

The only downside I can see to the extras is the lack of a commentary, but considering the language problems the director and leading actor and actress (all being French) would have likely encountered was probably the decision for this.

This is a highly recommended purchase.",1340755200,3,2910,4.462121212121212
4980196,5,B00695E1BY,"Michael Hazanavicius's THE ARTIST dares to be something that adult films these days just don't: it's charming, utterly charming, and it feels no guilt about it.  The plot centers around silent film star George Valentin, who finds his fame and fortune crumbling away with the rise of talkies.  To make matters worse, he's smitten with the new era's fastest rising starlet, Peppy Miller.

It's a romance.  It's a drama.  It's an homage to the glory days of Hollywood.  But it's also a solid film in its own right; dare I say, a classic in the making?  As the lead, Jean Dujardin brings a sort of charisma we don't see much of these days; his physicality is reminiscent of Peter Sellers (I'm stealing the comparison from the ""making of"" featurette, because it's so dead-on), and in a silent film, most of the acting is physical in nature.  But a fantastic lead performance would be wasted without stellar support, and we get that in Berenice Bejo; her and Dujardin's scenes together are as close to perfect as I've scene lately, and their charisma is undeniable.  The rest of the cast is equally delightful: Malcom McDowell, Missi Pyle, Penelope Ann Miller, and especially James Crowmell and John Goodman are fantastic.

The two stars here aren't people, however.  The cinematography is astounding; there is no other word for it.  And the film's script (also by Hazanavicius) is smart.  Yes, it's charming, and yes, it's highly emotional (I was brought close to tears at times; kudos for the amazing score as well), but it's also smart.  That's rare in romantic films; we all know the character arc by this point, so how can you put a new twist on it?  Everything leads up to one of the best film endings of all time, and when the credits role, your journey is completed, and you are thoroughly satisfied.  THE ARTIST is never short of beautiful and captivating; at times, it's even a flat-out cinematic delight.  What more could you want from a film?",1340755200,6,1948,4.732937685459941
4980197,1,B00695E1BY,"I can't remember being more disappointed with a movie. I understand the premise, the history of film (having taught film) and know that modern-day audiences require sound where sound is appropriate. Having produced two independent feature films, I also appreciate the enormous value of soundtrack.

In the beginning of the film, it is about the silent era. Dialogue cards are appropriate. I get it! But, when they begin screening sound tests of the blonde, the hollow, tin-can quality of the sound track should have been heard. Hollow scratchy voices with echo and weak, minimal sound effects (footsteps, door closes).

Sequentially, a natural progression of advancements in technology (phonograph recorded sound to multi-track mono to stereo to 5.1 surround, with Black & white to full Technicolor) lead to the tap-dance numbers at the end. It seems clear to me that THAT was the intention of the filmmaker to begin with.

This effort, while noble, fails miserably from a failure to execute the premise technically. I sense that the Director was playing it safe, unable to make decisive editorial progressions of picture & sound at opportune times.

Had it been a fresh effort at doing a B&W William Powell/Myrna Loy type of comedy...it had all the elements. The leads were great. The camera loved them. BUT, I needed to hear them. The only excuse for the treatment of the soundtrack (or lack thereof) is that the hum head (soundman) failed to record it, or he degaused the scenes during transfers....and they were lost.

Hopefully, the movie was actually shot on Eastman Color negative, with all dialogue scenes recorded with sound and a host of sound effects, waiting on racks in the cutting room to be added at some future release.

I will revisit this movie when they remaster the appropriate picture and sound elements. IT CRIES OUT FOR A SPECIAL EDITION--THE BASICS! OH! And please don't forget the dog barks.",1340755200,9,1916,5.009433962264151

Filmed in luxurious black-and-white and featuring classy title cards on-screen as a throwback to the original silent film genre, this newest production perfectly captures the pristine and amazing look of a by-gone time in cinematic history. Upon its initial release, it recieved universal acclaim from film critics and movie-goers alike. Produced on a modest budget of $15 million, it went on to earn a staggering amount of nearly $134 million during its first-run theatrical showings. The film was also awarded international accolades from the film community, dominating Best Picture prizes at the Cannes Film Festival, Golden Globes and Oscars, among others. The overall end result is a remarkable masterpiece and an instant classic. It was the first French film to ever win Best Picture (Thomas Langmann, Producer); the first mainly silent film to win since 1927's ""Wings"" (the first recipient of the Best Picture Award, in 1929); the first film presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio to win since 1955's ""Marty""; the first black-and-white film to win since 1993's ""Schindler's List""; and the first non-R-rated film to win since 2004's ""Million Dollar Baby"". It also earned Oscars for Michel Hazanavicius for Best Director, Jean Dujardin as Best Actor, as well as Best Costume Design and Best Original Score.

The idea of introducing a silent movie to a new generation of movie audiences here in the 21st century is a major accomplishment that succeeds even beyond the aspirations of the filmmakers. The end result is astonishing and breathtaking, while remaining true to the art of film-making that exemplifies everything that there is to enjoy about going to a local movie theater and experiencing filmed images projected onto the silver screen.

I'm not sure what many folks expected and, honestly, when you compare this lovely, sweet, simple film with the 3-D blockbusters, it's in a different ballpark. As for me - a guy who loves old silent films and period music - this film tied with ""Hugo"" as the best films of 2011.  That said, I'll move on to ""new territory"" and concentrate on the DVD (particularly the Blu-ray) DVD release.

Of all the top Oscar-nominated films from 2011, ""The Artist"" is the last to see a home video release. But the Weinstein Company (who produced the film) wisely chose take the time, chose Sony Pictures as packager and distributors, at is finally available for those who loved it in the theater to watch again and again and let those who missed it, discover it.

Beginning with the packaging - slipcase that opens like a book to review some classic images - and continuing on to the multitude of ""bonus feature"" - this is a classy production. These ""bonuses"" include:

A ""blooper reel"" (2 minutes) that is really the only weak one since it's hard to appreciate ""bloopers"" in a SILENT film.

A ""making of"" short  (21 minutes) that mixes a bit of early sound film history (from film historian Wade Major) with comments from the cast and production team.

A ""Q& A with the filmmakers and cast"" (except for John Goodman and Malcolm McDowell) at UCLA (a whopping 44 minutes!). There are some interesting tidbits of info here including the fact that the shoot was only 35 days and that the scenes were transferred at 22 frames per second giving it the feel of an older film.

Four short features on the ""Artisans Behind the film"" (total 11 minutes) covering the costumes, score, cinematography and production design. The extra joy here is seeing the gorgeous costumes in COLOR.

""Hollywood as a Character: The Locations"" (5 minutes) on the actual locates in Hollywood that were used.

If anything, the one feature I'd have liked is one on Uggie, the dog who plays a major role. Uggie, is not even mentioned (well one in the Q&A) in any of the special features.

One of my fellow reviewers mentioned the image of the Blu-ray (which is presented in standard 1:33 format. I actually have a  30 year-old 27-inch standard screen Sony television and the image looks great! Since this film is in black and white and is trying to recreate a film from the late 1920s the sharpness is not as important and it might look better on an older TV than a new HD, wide-screen, one. But, for me, it's the story and the acting (and the wonderful score - check out the soundtrack CD) that make this a joy to watch.

My only gripe - and this DVD is not the only one with this problem - is that you cannot easily skip past the ""previews"" (and there are plenty of them on this DVD) when you reload the DVD. I enjoy having the previews to watch ONCE (some great Weinstein/Sony releases here), but it's annoying to have to have them continuously pop up first.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Even if they had left out sound effects out and only done a musical score to go with the film then they should have composed music that fit the scenes intended. There is even a use of a song with a singer. I was tempted to leave the theater at that point but decided to sit through it all to see how bad it truly got. It just kept getting worse for the sound. The music lacked a period feel and really didn't fit the following scenes. It felt more like the mod music that was often used to set the tone for the actors in a scene instead of the musical score meant to move the audience.

The lighting techniques for one were all wrong. They director of photography should be ashamed of themselves for not knowing how to work in black and white. Mostly the scenes are all just gray. If you get a chance to watch true black and white movies you'll see the major difference. Proper lighting adds to the depth of a black and white scene. Having all lights up all the time like you do when shooting color really makes for a dull appearance in monochrome.

As for plot, it's cute, but it has been done before. It's actually been done a lot. I think it is a good plot idea. Unfortunately the writers weren't that great and the acting matched it well. I don't understand why the Academy would award this piece of junk with so much attention and so many awards. The only screen presence that seemed to understand how to act without speech was the cute dog. I think they should have made the movie about him at this point. The so called actors in this film lacked the ability to show emotion with body language. You need that when you have to act everything out in pantomime. Then you have the large lack of speech cards. I know that often conversations were had in original silent films that didn't use a lot of speech cards, but they acted it out in pantomime to make up for it so that you didn't need any cards.

All in all, I recommend that you avoid this movie. There are a lot of original silent films out there that are so much better. This one should just be burned and forgotten.",1340236800,23,2539,4.252587991718427
4980204,4,B00695E1BY,"This year's reigning Best Picture Oscar winner, ""The Artist"" is an emotional, lovingly crafted paean to Hollywood's silent and early talkie era, beautifully performed and entertaining despite a somewhat hollow story line.

Jean Dujardin is marvelous in his Oscar winning turn as George Valentin, a Hollywood silent movie star about to see his box-office fortunes fade as the industry veers into the era of talking pictures. George's fall is contrasted with the improbable rise to stardom of Peppy Miller (the lovely Berenice Bejo), who accidentally bumps into George and lands on the front pages of the trades - launching a career that sees her quickly spring into the limelight. But while Peppy's movies generate tickets, George's life free falls, with the former star losing nearly everything except the companionship of his faithful Jack Russell terrier.

Michel Hazanavicius' film pays tribute to the heyday of Hollywood in the `20s and `30s, all of it framed in 1.33 B&W and lusciously scored by Ludovic Bource (sans a controversial quote from Bernard Herrmann's ""Vertigo"" that still remains in this Blu-Ray edition, despite reports it was going to be replaced for the home video version). Dujardin's mannerisms and physical performance are just remarkable, helping to carry a film that relies heavily on the expressions of its cast to relay its rags-to-riches/riches-to-rags story (there are few title cards present in the film). The luminous Bejo is terrific too, while supporting turns from veteran character actors (John Goodman, James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller and Malcolm McDowell among them) lend some American domestic appeal to the the French-made picture.

If there's a quibble I have with ""The Artist,"" it's that the film takes a bit too much time getting to where we all know it's heading - and tends to languish in George's despair and darkness during the final third (something not uncommon with French films) before doing an about-face in a bouncy finale.

Sony's Blu-Ray of ""The Artist"" is framed in 1.33 and boasts a nicely detailed, though at times inconsistent looking, AVC encoded 1080p transfer; some sections of the film appear completely smooth and digital in nature, while others appear to have some intentionally-added grain. The DTS MA audio is fine, and extras include a blooper reel, Q&A with the cast, an Ultraviolet copy, and a number of other behind-the-scenes featurettes, in which the American actors seem a bit surprised by how well the film turned out (co-star Missi Pyle even refers to Dujardin and Bejo as ""the French leads,"" not by name!).",1340236800,4,2586,5.179425837320574

They said it all with body language, sometimes even sexy body language, facial expressions, stunning dance moves and costumes, tears, smiles, and sheer charisma. Within a very few minutes into the film I was lost in the story.  I hated when it ended because I wanted to see more.

Everybody is offering their review, and thankfully, most are positive.  However, there was one particular scene that just had me.  It's when George, realizing his fame and fortune are near an end, and he is sitting in his living room looking out the window, and it's raining.  The camera angle has his face, and the raindrops that are falling down from the windows reflect on his face, and it looks as though he is crying.  Incredible!  This is what great filmmaking is all about.  I thought the acting was superb, and even the extras in the film were terrific.  When the dog has to run to the cop for help, notice the lady standing on the corner.  She reminds me of everybody's aunt, and she has that ""look"" about her that was just terrific.

4980207,4,B00695E1BY,"This clever take on the silent era is a valentine (note the titular character's name) to Old Hollywood and especially to lovers of classic movies. Unknown French director Michel Hazanavicius, who also wrote the screenplay, wanted to take on the challange of making a silent film, complete with black & white photography & title cards, in the 21st century. To say that he succeeded (whether you like the film or not) cannot be denied.

The movie opens in 1927 Hollywood. Silent superstar George Valentin (a combination of Douglas Fairbanks Sr & John Gilbert & played by French actor Jean Dujardin) is about to be caught up in the transition to sound. While he is dealing with this crisis, young extra Peppy Miller (a cross between the young Joan Crawford, Clara Bow, & Gloria Swanson & winningly played by Berenice Bejo who just happens to be the director's wife) makes the transition to sound and is on her way up. The parallel to A STAR IS BORN is obvious along with several other references to classic films such as CITIZEN KANE (the breakfast scene), SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (the sound test), & THE THIN MAN (the dog). For the end sequence, pick the Astaire-Rogers musical of your choice.

Along with the French performers, two American character actors are given prominent roles in the proceedings. John Goodman plays the classic Hollywood studio head complete with fat cigar while James Cromwell is George's loyal chauffeur (a reference to SUNSET BOULEVARD). Both adapt themselves well to the silent medium. While there are several references to other classic Hollywood films, THE ARTIST is more than just a simple homage. It's also the heartwarming story of two people headed in different directions with some lightweight comedy thrown in & one classic scene between Berenice Bejo & an empty coat.

Despite all the critical praise, THE ARTIST does have some issues from my perspective as an instructor on silent movies. Most of them are visual and won't be noticed by the casual filmgoer. The number one problem is with the lighting. Most silent films have a much more varied contrast between light & shadow (even the comedies of Chaplin, Keaton & Lloyd) but then silent films weren't shot in color on modern equipment and then turned into black & white. This also gives the film a rather flat look on occasion which becomes somewhat boring after awhile. I would have liked to see the lighting and photography change as the time frame moved from the silent to the sound era.

But this is scholarly nitpicking. I was delighted at how well THE ARTIST captures the spirit of the era although that era is much more the early 1930s than the late 1920s. I am even more delighted that it's reaching a mainstream audience who are now discovering the world of the silent cinema for the first time. In interviews director Hazanavicius said that that is what he hoped his ""little film"" would do, which it has. Silent films are not for everyone and never will be but they are a valid art form as different from sound films as ballet is from opera. For opening the door to a wider appreciation of the films of the distant past, THE ARTIST deserves its accolades.",1339804800,4,3151,4.7655677655677655
4980208,5,B00695E1BY,"The people who financed THE ARTIST must have been crazy.

After all, what audience in 2011 would embrace a black-and-white, essentially silent, movie with a predictable plot that borrowed elements from many classic American films (e.g. A STAR IS BORN, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and even CITIZEN KANE)?

In this instance, insanity paid off.  THE ARTIST is truly a joyful motion picture, filled with humor and emotions that evoke memories of timeless masterpieces like Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS.

Written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, the ingenious film walked away with virtually every major award in the 2011 season, climaxing its astounding success with five Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor (Jean Dujardin) and Best Picture.

Set in Hollywood during the late 1920s when the movies were on the verge of talking, the story tells of a romantic leading man (Dujardin) in the Douglas Fairbanks tradition, who is tossed aside with the introduction of sound by his studio, the public and his wife.  Conversely, on the way up the ladder to stardom is a young actress (Berenice Bejo), sort of a Ruby Keeler type, who the actor had helped when she was still struggling.  There is a definite connection between these two, and when Ms. Bejo becomes the biggest star in the movies, she secretly tries to help the now penniless, proud and alcoholic former superstar of the silents.

One doesn't have to be a genius to anticipate virtually every plot turn in THE ARTIST, but that's okay because the charm of this story is the engaging way that the director has chosen to tell it.  He has even filmed his picture in Los Angeles on locations where, eighty or so years ago, scenes like these might actually have taken place.

My only complaint, definitely a minor one, is that the picture could have lost perhaps ten minutes in its second half.  Dujardin's fall from grace and his scenes of self-pity do go on a bit too long.

THE ARTIST boasts a marvelous supporting cast that includes James Cromwell, John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, Malcolm McDowell,  Ed Lauter and, of course, ""Uggie,"" the Jack Russell terrier that steals every scene that he's in.

The Blu-ray disc from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is filled with extras, including a blooper reel, a Q&A with filmmakers and cast, and several ""making of"" featurettes,  one of which looks at the various filming locations today and as they were back in the time when this movie is set.

4980209,4,B00695E1BY,"To state that French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the artistry and emotional appeal of classic silent cinema would be a severe understatement. He devours it like only a true cineaste would and brings a unique deftness to such a long-forgotten medium that he singlehandedly brings it back to life if only for this one instance. Mostly silent with title cards and shot entirely black-and-white, this stylish 2011 dramedy starts in 1927 Hollywood as pre-Depression audiences were still enraptured by the heart-palpitating derring-do of matinee idols like Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and John Gilbert on the silver screen. As Norma Desmond said in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunset-Boulevard/dp/B00003CXCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunset Boulevard</a>, ""We didn't need dialogue. We had faces then."" And indeed Hazanavicius has found the appropriate doppelganger in his constant star Jean Dujardin portraying an amalgam of Fairbanks, Gilbert and Rudolph Valentino with a touch of Charlie Chaplin (notable in his comic scenes with the dog) and a little Gene Kelly-style hoofing thrown in for good measure.

Dujardin plays George Valentin, one of the silent screen's leading lights whose charming braggadocio is more than offset by his popularity. At the premiere of his latest romantic espionage caper, he has a ""meet-cute"" run-in with the fittingly named Peppy Miller, a pretty extra fumbling for her autograph book on the red carpet. He is immediately impressed with her beauty as well as her moxie, and in another ""meet-cute"" run-in, by her terpsichorean talent as well. Once their mutual attraction is established, the plot follows a standard&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Star-Is-Born/dp/B003B3V0X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Star Is Born</a>&nbsp;storyline by showing his career in decline while hers is on a fast rise with the advent of talkies. There is a buoyant spirit that infuses the story and sideswipes the more tragic elements one would expect from previous versions of this tale. That's how Hazanavicius manages to engage the viewer even though the film slows considerably during the middle section despite his meticulous efforts. There are also recognizable tributes to silent classics like F.W. Murnau's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunrise/dp/B0002DCHQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunrise</a>&nbsp;and King Vidor's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crowd/dp/7885726967/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crowd</a>&nbsp;and even a wink to the classic breakfast montage in Orson Welles'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Kane/dp/B0050G3NWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Kane</a>&nbsp;to illustrate how Valentin and his icy wife drift apart.

Some of Valentin's most vulnerable moments are beautifully rendered like the puddle of liquor on the glass table, his window reflection against the tuxedoed torso of a mannequin, and a sure-to-be-classic nightmare scene where he hears every sound except his own voice. The movie jumps back to life with a surprisingly exhilarating ending that subtly explains the key dramatic point of the story. Dujardin immerses himself completely into the essence of his embattled, vainglorious character without a trace of irony. It's a genuinely exquisite performance that could have easily disintegrated into self-parody in less assured hands. What's more, the man can really dance. Brnice Bejo (who also happens to be the director's wife) is lovely and vivacious as Peppy, although there are moments when she comes across as a mite too contemporary to be truly convincing as a period character. Take, for example, the fist pump she shows when she wins her first audition. At the same time, when she puts an arm through the sleeve of a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to be his, she handles this piece of pantomime with true aplomb.

The two French stars are surrounded by familiar American faces like John Goodman as a Jack Warner-like, cigar-chomping producer; James Cromwell as Valentin's dutiful chauffeur; Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's shingle-haired, ignored wife Doris; and Missi Pyle as a Lina Lamont-style starlet, appropriate since this film covers the same fertile ground as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singin-in-the-Rain/dp/B00006DEF9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singin' in the Rain</a>.

Kudos also need to be given to Guillaume Schiffman's accurately evocative cinematography (unlike other pastiches, the film looks like it was made in 1927), Laurence Bennett's production design (including an inventive use of the vintage Bradbury Building in downtown LA), and Ludovic Bource's swooning music score, which includes a snatch of Bernard Hermann's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/B000ICXQG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>&nbsp;score over a climactic scene. Even with all the praise heaped on this film from the critics, it's not for everyone's tastes. Silent cinema, by its very nature, beckons a certain patience from the audience that some will find tedious, and even at a running time of just 100 minutes, the movie still feels a bit long. At the same time, for those who can appreciate it as an art form, Hazanavicius has really delivered quite a treat.",1338595200,4,5769,6.499349804941483
4980210,5,B00695E1BY,"this movie seemingly has everything going against it commercially. it is in black and white. it is a silent movie. it has two French actors as leads playing the leads in an american set movie and all the other actors are americans, so why in the heck does it work both artistically and commercially? when i started watching it, knowing it was silent, i figured i was good for about fifteen minutes of it and would then go watch something else with dialogue. instead, i was mesmerized.

it is a marvelous film about two movie stars at the end of the silent era and the start of the talkie era. valentine is a huge silent star. one day he meets a young woman while giving an interview and is charmed by her. she ends up in his movie. however, he is married so nothing happens between them. soon, however, the movies change and her star starts to ascend since she can talk and his descends as he stayed with silents, she wants to save him but he is very resistant to being saved. it resembles A Star Is Born but is not a tragedy.

this film also has one other huge element for success. there is a jack russell terrier who is the third lead in the show and he almost streals the movie. he does great stuff throughout the movie and i would have watched it for the dog alone.

my only quibble is that i think george clooney should have gotten the oscar instead of this actor.  clooney's was a much more difficult role, far more universal, plus brilliantly realized and executed.

4980211,5,B00695E1BY,"My first ideas about The Artist were that it was a re-hash of A Star is Born but I was pleasantly surprised by the story and the marvelous performances. The performances by Jean Dujardin, as silent movie star George Valentin, is a tour-de-force and magnificently conveys all the emotions of his fall from stardom.

The film begins in 1927 when Valentin (modeled after Douglas Fairbanks) is at the top of his profession. He has a chance meeting with (and is attracted to) a young dancer and would-be actress, beautifully played by Brnice Bejo. As it was for many stars of silent films, Valentin has problems adapting to sound movies. At the time, sound was considered a fad by many but audiences proved such ideas a fallacy, forcing studios to switch to sound as fast as possible. Valentin bucks the trend by making an expensive silent film that bombs at the box office while the actress he had previously befriended is starring in a blockbuster under the name Peppy Miller. The film chronicles the rise of Peppy Miller's star as Valentin fades into oblivion, helped by the Great Depression.

I have had a long affection for silent films so it came as a nice surprise that The Artist was filmed using the same size film that produces a square box on the screen. The cinematography (by Guillaume Schiffman) was also reminiscent of silent film and was tones of the film were superbly rendered. Interesting that a small clip from Fairbanks' Mark Of Zorro was included in the scene where Valentin is watching one of his movies. John Goodman was fabulous as movie mogul Al Zimmer and James Cromwell was terrific as Clifton, Valentin's supportive chauffer. It was also fun to see Malcolm McDowell in a bit part. And lest we forget, Uggie the dog certainly made the movie special and charming.

Much credit for the success of the film goes to Michel Hazanavicius, who took quite a chance of making a silent film. The period of the 1920's and 30's was beautifully broght to life. I hope that The Artist places more focus on silent films, as they are beautiful works of art even if sometimes the acting is old-fashioned.",1337731200,4,2110,4.712737127371274
4980212,4,B00695E1BY,"This movie really goes against the grain for a contemporary movie. It is nearly devoid of special effects, the story has a simple narrative, it is shot in glorious black and white, and there is no dialogue save for title cards that splash across the screen periodically. Despite all of this I really liked this movie. However, I like old silent movies and watch them on TCM quite often. I don't know if everyone would like this movie, but if you have watched silent movies in the past and like them this movie might be for you.
The plot is fairly simple. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a romantic lead and the toast of Hollywood and Peppy Miller (Berniece Bejo) is a movie fan/wannabe film ingenue. Their paths keep crossing as the two experience the high and lows of fame. There is a connection there, but they keep colliding with one another as George's career falls apart and Peppy's  is on the rise. George represents the old Hollywood and Peppy the new which includes the advent of sound. The plot incorporates elements of Singing In The Rain and A Star Is Born.
I think this movie works because Dujardin and Bejo are two really appealing actors who act with their faces and have mastered the art of pantomime. The supporting cast is first rate. Penelope Ann Miller appears as George's shrewish wife. While no words are heard, she milks her part for what it is worth. John Goodman is great as the boisterous movie mogul who ultimately controls George's fortunes. James Cromwell plays George's chauffeur who really is more friend than chauffeur and looks after George when things get really bleak. The part of ""The Dog"" is played by a non-descript terrier named Uggie  who is a cross between Rin Tin Tin and Toto who is part savior and 100% man's best friend. The script is straight forward and amusing and endearing enough to get the viewer invested in the film. I knew the film was good when I stopped being conscious of reading the subtitles. I'm certain that early moviegoers did exactly this before sound movies were introduced.
On the face of it, the people who made this movie did something gutsy when they made this movie. Reverting to silent film doesn't seem like the smartest move.
I don't think we'll be seeing more silent films made for today's audience, but I enjoyed this one.",1337644800,,2299,4.6600985221674875

While out getting his picture taken and talking to reporters he bumps into a young woman named Peppy Miller (Bejo). After seeing her picture in the paper she decided to audition for a role in a movie. She is an instant hit and her and George hit it off. When George's producer Al Zimmer (Goodman)tells him that the future is in ""talkies"" he laughs it off. He is stunned when it takes off, with Peppy as the star. I have seen all of the best picture nominees of the year and saved this one for last. I was very skeptical going in, how good can a black & white/silent movie really be in 2012? I will have to admit that the movie was better then I expected it to be, but I still think that this is one of the most overrated movies I have seen recently. If you have seen ""Sunset Boulavard"" then you have seen a much better version of this movie. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie and my problem with it wasn't that it was silent or black & white (I have no problem with those types of movies) but it was very boring in some parts and had trouble staying focused.  This movie could have been worse but I really don't think that this was deserving of best picture at all. Best actor I can see, but not picture. This is a movie to watch out of curiosity but don't expect the best movie of the year. Overall, the most overrated movie to win best picture since ""Slumdog Millionare"". I give it a B.

4980214,1,B00695E1BY,"After all of the hype for this film, before the academy awards, I was very disappointed. When movie makers produced black and white films early on they painstakingly considered the light and gradients of white, gray going into black, working with the lighting techniques. This made scenes more intense and created the mood of the movie. I did not find this to be true in this ""The Artist"". The movie was in black, gray and white. The characters in the story were very shallow so why was this even considered best actor material? It was no stretch for veteran actors. Movies like ""War Horse"", ""The Descendants"", ""Hugo"" and ""Midnight In Paris"" were far superior in cinema photography, story and acting. Every once in a while Hollywood goes crazy and latches on to something different and unexpected and they did it again at the expense of the four dynamic previously mentioned films.",1336262400,26,881,4.841059602649007
4980215,4,B00695E1BY,"I have been looking forward to the disc release of this film ever since I saw it in a packed NYC theater with a wonderful audience which so added to the experience.  You could feel them breathing and reacting to the images on the screen much like it must have been in the days of silent films -- but so much different from they way they react to regular dialogue films.  With that in mind, since at the time I am writing this I am seemingly the only Amazon reviewer to have actually seen the movie on DVD, I must warn you that watching a silent film at home is quite unlike watching a dialog film, especially if you are alone.  You must devote yourself entirely to the film.  You cannot look away from the screen.  In most dialog films there are clues as to what is happening if you glance away because you will continue to hear what is being said.  If you are not accustomed to watching silent films you might not fully understand this until you start wondering what just happened while I looked away?  In the theater I felt what was happening in the central action if I was studying something in the background of the film's set, but that does not happen at home.

THIS is why I have been so pointed in my comments to some of the reviewers who obviously have only seen this movie in the theater because it will not be released on disc until weeks after they have submitted their review.  If you have not seen THIS PRODUCT you cannot accurately convey what the film will be like when watching it on disc in your home.  It's more than picture quality, it is more than plotline, it is more than whether this film is unique or derivative, it is an experience and in this case it WILL be different at home alone than it was in a crowded theater.

I have given the disc four stars because the experience is a step below what the movie was like in the theater.  The acting, reacting, editing, musical support, plotlines, and inventiveness of this film are just as stupendous at home as in the theater.  It is far superior to Mel Brooks' ""Silent Movie"" which was a parody of the form in the same way as his work on Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows.  This is a tribute to the silent medium and is skillful in re-creating it without pretending the form was full of overacting.  It is more dramatically important than ""Singing In The Rain"" which bases the plot on the historically inaccurate concept of a John Gilbert-like actor with a high voice.  This gets a bit into the psychology of a silent actor who is master of his craft and unable to abandon it until some life-changing experiences.

By the way, this is not a silent movie.  It is a dialog-less movie.  It has a skillful soundtrack of music, sound effects, and a few spoken words -- which actually I place in the category of sound effects rather than dialog!  The sound track supports the image on the screen and is an integral part of the movie.  As much effort and care has gone into that sound track as with any modern film.

If you are willing to give yourself to this movie you will be rewarded.  While it really should be seen in the company of others who are likewise receptive to it, you will not be disappointed with it on disc.",1335571200,14,3187,4.328282828282828
4980216,4,B00695E1BY,"It has been argued that art benefits from limits. Sonnets must have 14 lines and adhere to structures of rhyme and meter. Great artists don't say, ""I can't work with those rules"" but take up the challenge. Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets, not including those in his plays.

Some limitations of art can be attributed to choice and some are imposed by circumstances. The producer Val Lewton made low budget horror films in the 1940s. He didn't have the money for elaborate special effects for films like ""Cat People"" or ""The Seventh Victim"" so he had to use shadow and impressions to scare the audience. And arguably his films where the frights took place in the minds of the audience better than some films of the period that now seem dated by laughable creature effects.

The Production Code of the Hayes Office limited what could be openly shown and talked about in mainstream Hollywood films. And though I'm not an advocate for censorship, such films as ""Casablanca"" and ""Notorious"" are much more subtle and even adult in dealing with issues of sexuality than most modern films that are free to show more body parts.

Michel Hazanavicius, the French writer and director, of last year's acclaimed film, ""The Artist"", imposed upon himself several rather daunting limits. Set in Hollywood from 1927 - 32, the film, like those of the silent era has no spoken dialogue (mostly), is black and white and uses screen proportions of those years in film. Interestingly, it also complies with the content restrictions of the era (mostly; with the exception of a rude hand gesture and an implied act of violence that might not have made it to the screen at that time.)

Jean Duardin plays a swashbuckling star of the silver screen (think Fairbank/Valentino) named George Valentin at the peak of his career who meets a young starlet on the rise (Peppy Miller played by Berenice Bejo). The advent of sound proves devastating to his career as it was for many silent stars.

Ultimately, ""The Artist"" is a story about pride; a man too proud to accept help when it is needed, even to accept love.

When his studio switches to making ""talkies"" exclusively, Valentin uses his own money to make an elaborate silent film that, along with the market crash, leads to his financial downfall.

He turns out his faithful servant who desires to still serve and resists help from Peppy who desires to return the favors he granted her.
As Proverbs 29:23 teaches, ""Pride brings a person low."" The question in the film is whether Valentin will fulfill the second part of that verse, ""but the lowly in spirit will gain honor.""

Hazanavicius playfully uses the conceits of the silent film, the facial mugging and exaggerated gestures to kid, but not mock the films of that period. He also strategically uses sound effects to hint at the great changes to come in the film world. He wisely uses the limits to push himself to make his art.

Just as art is often improved by limits, God provides limits for his people to improve our lives. His commands are not impediments to our happiness, but like a rhyme scheme for a poem, a challenge to live richer, more creative lives for him.

(And on a side note, if you have never taken the time to watch the great silent classics, you are missing some great fun. Comedy in particular found a unique ""voice"" in this era that is only hinted at in ""The Artist"". Start with Charlie Chaplin [""City Lights"", ""Modern Times""] and Buster Keaton [""Sherlock Jr."", ""The General""] and discover a treasure trove of laughs, and yes, art.)",1335225600,7,3529,4.742251223491028
4980217,5,B00695E1BY,"Is this just a coincidence? Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" is a Hollywood film about a French film pioneer Georges Mlis. A French film ""The Artist"" is about a fictional silent movie star George Valentin and the early days of Hollywood. Both films share one theme: great artists forgotten by the world.

""The Artist"" is a love story. You don't need historical knowledge (though it will help you understand some part of the film). It is a romance between a silent film star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) and Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo), a big fan of George, whose talent is accidentally ""discovered"" by George himself. The year is 1927 when ""The Jazz Singer"" was released. The era of silent films is about to end. While adorable Peppy is a star on the rise, George's career declines.

The story is very melodramatic, just like old Hollywood movies. Director Michel Hazanavicius believes in the power of visuals and actors' performances (including that of scene-stealing ""Uggie the dog""). Jean Dujardin and Brnice Bejo shine as the stars of the old-fashioned romantic story. It is a simple story well told.

The film's unique supports include James Cromwell, Ken Davitian, John Goodman, Malcolm McDowell, Penelope Ann Miller and Missi Pyle.

""The Artist"" is a black-and-white ""silent"" film, but here ""silent"" only means that actors do not speak (mostly). The film has music, but the film's story unfolds with actors' gestures and occasional intertitles (title cards). This is a different cinematic format for storytelling. And it works. Take time and enjoy it.",1335052800,5,1562,5.08984375

Amazon is designed to review PRODUCTS and this product is false marketing. If you want to see a movie review, look on a movie reviewing website such as rottentomatoes, or most of the other reviews on here that are using amazon incorrectly.

I am a 27-yr old male and I have rarely gone to the movies since 2009, because Hollywood persists in producing/releasing such unwatchable trash, I'd rather stay at home and clip my toenails. How many sex comedies must Hollywood make per month before they finally realize ""enough is enough""?
""The Artist"" is a salute to where Hollywood originated and what people originally considered entertainment. Honestly, I wish American entertainment would revert back to the 20s/30s/40s. [Sigh...]
Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are absolutely marvelous in this film. And I can't begin to express to you the joy I felt when Monsieur Dujardin beat George Clooney (who is an overrated, self-centered d-bag, BTW) for the Best Actor Oscar. I am thrilled to the core to see ""The Artist"" win Best Picture.
The ONLY reason this film is PG-13 is because the starlet (Missi Pyle) briefly flips off Dujardin and he nearly shoots himself. Otherwise, there is absolutely NO violence, sex, nudity, or language. They don't even kiss! This is the perfect date movie.

4980222,5,B00695E1BY,"Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, John Gilbert, Rudolph Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks are smiling. This audacious film is a silent movie in black and white, with intertitles for dialogue! This PG-13 homage to early Hollywood absolutely proves that Talkies did NOT invent drama, pathos, comedy or romance; we experience all of these and more, yet only hear a handful of words spoken in the entire film. (I just love movies about movies!)

Did you see the ""OSS 117"" pastiches inspired by the ""James Bond"" films? If so, you can easily picture the hilarious Jean Dujardin as a 1920s silent screen superstar who goes into a tailspin with the advent of the Talkies. Dujardin is a master of the sendup, the spoof, the satirical take-off on vanity, ego and self-satisfaction, so his parody of Douglas Fairbanks is spot on! As are his versions of Gene Kelly in ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and Fred Astaire in anything with Ginger Rogers.

In a second viewing, I was even more impressed, look for long single-take scenes: note the one in the star's dressing room when the starlet finds herself alone; watch the lengthy dance sequence a la Astaire, two cuts, MAX! Note the ""Hollywoodland"" sign on the hillside. That was the original Hollywood sign, it was a real estate advertisement and that was when I knew they would try for verisimilitude. I've ordered the DVD from Amazon.com because this can hold up under repeated viewings. In the 84th Annual Academy Awards (in which it won numerous awards) it was revealed that of all the nominated films, this is the only one SHOT ENTIRELY IN THE HOLLYWOOD AREA!

These actors make it work:
  * Jean Dujardin won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this role. He starts out as such a ""STAR"" that you are surprised when you see a more human side.
  * Brnice Bejo is transcendent as a spunky Debbie Reynolds-type character in this little show-biz romp. Of course they meet cute and then, shades of ""A Star is Born,"" their lives reverse as her fortunes soar and his plummet.
  * A clever Jack Russell Terrier promptly keels over when a finger is suddenly pointed at him, but runs for help when the house is on fire.
  * Penelope Ann Miller is our hero's disenchanted wife.
  * John Goodman with cigar at full chomp, runs a studio and caters to temperamental stars.
  * James Cromwell is our hero's faithful chauffeur and stalwart friend.
  * Missi Pyle does a blonde bimbo reminiscent of Lina Lamont in ""Singin'...,"" only we never hear this one's voice... Whew!

Writer/Director Michel Hazanavicius has done only French films in the past, but with printed dialogue on those intertitles, this film could be in any language. (Please remember, both ""homage"" and ""clich"" are French!) Our Seattle International Film Festival screening audience could see that most of the words the actors mouthed were English...except that terrific dog...I'm pretty sure he was barking in French.",1334275200,11,2911,4.846464646464646
4980223,4,B00695E1BY,"You have to hand it to writer and director Michel Hazanavicius for coming up with this idea and especially that it works so well. The technical aspects are well done. Everyone knows the film has no sound, well almost. There is a dream sequence where George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) hears sounds but he has no voice. And of course the film is accompanied by an orchestrated soundtrack. It even has the 4:3 (or 1.33:1 if you prefer) aspect ratio, the same as the original theater screens. Then there are the title cards which tell us what the actors are saying. Like the original silent films, these aren't used often as the actor's job is to let us know what's going on with their performance. Unlike many of the original silent films, you can actually see what the actor's are saying because the picture is clear enough to read their lips. So the title cards pretty much enforce what we've already heard...ahem, seen.

The story really isn't new. It is a mash up of ""Singing in the Rain,"" the 1952 Gene Kelly masterpiece and the numerous iterations of ""A Star is Born."" Valentin is the most successful actor of his time. Handsome, rugged, witty and very charming. He meets Peppy Miller, a perfectly named wannabe actress/dancer played by long-stemmed Argentine beauty Berenice Bejo. As the silent film era transitions to ""talkies"", Valentin doesn't. At the same time, the adorable Peppy rises to the top. Valentin loses his fortune after his self financed final film tanks and the stock market crashes. It's 1929 and George is penniless, yet still proud and defiant. After a struggle with the bottle he attempts suicide but is eventually saved by his very cute dog and then by Peppy.

While their relationship remains chaste throughout, there is a smoldering fire within each of them. Initially, George's marriage gets in the way, but his wife (Penelope Ann Miller) leaves him before all his money is lost. I watch lot of old black and white movies and even silent ones, so I was not in shock seeing this film. What may be surprising is that once you get past that, there is a wonderful romantic drama delivered by two talented actors.

Update:  Winning the Oscar for best picture as well as lead actor and director, ""The Artist"" seemed needing a second look.  Knowing the story pretty well I tried to focus on the technical aspects of the film.  One of the things I noticed early on was the staging.  And for the most part they got it spot on.  There is one scene where George (Jean Dujardin) is leaving the executive studio after pitching his new movie and he runs into Peppy (Berenice Bejo) on a stairwell heading the opposite direction. The facade of the office is just like they did it during the silent era.  I also noticed the title cards carry longer pieces of dialog than they did in the 1920's, and were better synched.  They also were in view for a much briefer period.  I guess we are expected to be faster readers.

Dujardin did deserve his acting award, managing to run the full range of emotion without using words, but I was a little surprised he did win.  I say this for the same reason Ms. Bejo didn't.  Neither is well known on this side of the pond and was up against some beloved actors.  Bejo certainly deserved her nomination and in fact has just about as much screen time as Dujardin, so her nomination as supporting actress is another one of the Academy head-scratchers.  Also worth mentioning are true supporting roles played by James Cromwell as a chauffeur for both stars, John Goodman as a film producer/director and of course Uggy, the Jack Russell terrier who steals every scene he's in.

The performances are flawless; the two leads are brilliant--great, compassionate, subtle performances.  I went to see this twice in the theatre, and the audiences at both showings applauded.

various car crashes--these are what many people want to see when they go to the movies.  Just look at the box office totals for most of the very financially successful movies--they are not art.

Nowadays, anyone can catch a flick at 10am 7 days a week wearing their jammies, and often being the sole soul in the theater.

Spoiler: this is a silent movie. Sorry if I've lost your attention already. But hear me out. True, this is one of your ""been there, done that - married boy meets single girl, married boy falls in love with single girl, married boy can't have single girl, single girl moves on, and there is still a happy ending"" story. But it's not the story that makes this movie - it's the way the story is told that makes this movie revolutionary and epic. Jean's and Brnice's pure, raw emotion, in addition to a stellar soundtrack, tell the entire story without the need for schnazzy graphics or complex plot. Dialogue is only displayed on screen maybe less that twenty times. The rest of the story is told entirely through kinesics, which is relayed via stellar acting.

I don't usually go see a movie in the theaters twice. I will see it once, and if it's good enough to see again will wait until it comes out on Blu Ray. But this movie...I even convinced by buddy, who had zero interest in seeing the movie and hadn't even heard of it, to go see it, and he loved it.

The score is also worth picking up. Yes, it's 100% instrumental. But 50% of the meaning of the movie is through this score! Even if you've not seen the movie, it's written so well that you can feel the emotion just by sitting back and closing your eyes while listening to it.

And, in contrast, there are those who quickly find themselves better off than they were before. We, of course, know what happens to the latter, but what of the former?

  On his way into the theater for the premiere of his latest film, silent movie star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) encounters young aspiring starlet Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) and the two are photographed by the many reporters by the entrance. By the next day, Miller (Bejo) is on the cover of Variety with the headline ""Who's That Girl?"" Valentin's spouse, Doris (played by Penelope Ann Miller) is annoyed while Peppy (Bejo) is ecstatic. When she auditions for a role in Valentin's next movie, the studio is hesitant while Valentin is insistent. Over time, Miller's popularity increases to the point where she no longer needs Valentin's patronage. In the same amount of time, Al Zimmer (played by John Goodman), the head of the studio holding Valentin's contract, announces they will be halting production on silent films in favor of sound. Valentin believes sound is a fad and decides to produce his next silent film without the studio. Only to have the opening go unnoticed thanks to Peppy Miller's latest offering being released on the same day.

  I haven't seen any of Dujardin's or Bejo's previous films. And, while I recognized members of the supporting cast, their roles were much less significant. Also, given that the majority of the film is silent, it was an unusual experience. I was tempted to switch on my iPod at times, but somehow I didn't think AC/DC was compatible with the tone the film was trying to set. Leaving all that aside, this is a brilliant film and I enjoyed it immensely.

4980228,5,B00695E1BY,"French director Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist is a delight to experience, a highly enjoyable and superbly crafted homage to an era and a style: the silent movies. While one can definitely appreciate it more if one has some familiarity with the silent movie era, it is not a necessity. The Artist will give anyone who's never seen a silent movie the experience of what seeing one was like and how different silent movies were stylistically to the 'talking' films which have been the norm for the last eighty years. And why people loved them as much as they did.

The Artist is set in Hollywood - the heart of the film industry - in the critical period between 1927, when silent movies were at their peak, and 1932, by which time they had become a thing of the past, completely displaced by 'talkies'. The film begins with a swashbuckling action sequence, but then the camera moves back and reveals that we're actually watching an audience watching a film, the premiere of a Hollywood studio's latest production featuring its star actor, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin). After the premiere is over, when Valentin is posing for the press outside the theater, an accidental encounter brings him face-to-face with an admiring young fan, Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo), who ends up being photographed with him. In a turn of classic Hollywood mythology, Miller is 'discovered' and given a shot at being an extra in a film, which turns out to be the next film Valentin is featured in. A second chance encounter results in Valentin taking Miller under his wing, insisting to studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) that she be given an actual part in the film. And thus Miller's career in film is begun.

The next part of the film draws thematically from film classics Singing in the Rain and A Star is Born. Fast-forwarding ahead to 1929, it is the beginning of the talking era, and studios are rushing to adapt to the new technology. Valentin is dismissive of the innovation, but Zimmer informs him that the studio is switching over to talkies immediately and anyone who can't adapt will be left behind. Refusing to budge, Valentin instead decides to produce his own silent epic, pouring all of his money into the production which he not only stars in but also directs. The film, Tears of Love, bombs horribly, ruining Valentin financially and eventually costing him not only his career and his house but also his marriage as well. But as Valentin's career fades, Miller's star is on the rise and soon she is a leading actress in her own right. But even as the plot descends into melodrama, it retains its comic touches and things are ultimately resolved in the most classically upbeat Hollywood way: a musical dance number.

Besides drawing on many of the themes in Singing in the Rain, The Artist is in many ways the perfect counterpoint film to it. Singing in the Rain deals with the transition from silent films to talking films, presented in a talking film with talking actors. The Artist deals with the same transition, but as a silent film centered around the point of view of a silent actor. Hazanavicius makes clever use of his format choices, bringing out Valentin's fears in a delightful sequence where everything in Valentin's room suddenly starts making noises. Already startled, Valentin then descends into panic when he realizes that his own voice is still silent, and that everything - and everyone - is being heard except him.

Hazanavicius did a lot of research in preparing for this film and put a lot of thought into the shooting. Besides being down in black and white, the Artist was also filmed in the full-screen ratio (1.33:1) that was the standard during the silent film era, which enhances the actors' faces, making them bigger on the screen, an important factor when much of the characters' intentions and feelings had to be conveyed silently rather than through dialogue. He also studied the lighting and camera techniques the original silent film directors used to enhance expression and convey mood.

The cast are, in a word, marvelous. Jean Dujardin's Valentin is the embodiment of the silent film movie idol, using heightened expression and body language - not to mention perfect comic timing - to bring his character to life. This is done quite subtly as we're often watching film within film, so that when the characters - who are silent film actors - portray characters in the films they're making, they're done just slightly more exaggerated than the characters are when they're being themselves. Brnice Bejo does the same with her Peppy Miller, playing the rising young ingenue and the comedic characters that her character in turn portrays. Hazanavicius knows his actors, having worked with both Dujardin and Bejo in previous films (not to mention being married to Bejo in real life), and knows exactly how to bring out pitch perfect performances from the both of them. The supporting cast, from John Goodman's comically put-upon studio boss to James Cromwell's devotedly loyal chauffeur, Clifton, are also excellent. And then there's Uggie, the perky and soulful little terrier who steals every scene he's in as Valentin's on-screen and off-screen dog.

As one would expect in a film like this, Hazanavicius has worked in a number of nods to the silent film age and to films and the film industry in general, some of them fairly obvious and others rather subtle. For example, the sequence that shows Valentin and his wife becoming estranged is a comic take on the classic sequence from Citizen Kane showing Kane and his wife becoming estranged over breakfast. Later, a scene shows Valentin in his reduced-circumstances apartment, watching a reel from one of his silent swashbucklers on a projector. The scene in the film is actually from a real silent film, The Mark of Zorro, which starred Douglas Fairbanks, one of the biggest stars of the silent film era. In the places where the shots are close enough to recognize the actor, Hazanavicius inserted Dujardin in place of Fairbanks. And in another scene later in the film after Miller has become a major star, a rescued Valentin ends up being taken to her mansion after his apartment has a fire. The mansion used in the scene originally belonged to Mary Pickford, one of the biggest stars of the silent film era, and the bed Valentin wakes up in is Mary Pickford's actual bed.

Highly recommended, both as a truly creditable homage to the silent silver screen and as a thoroughly enjoyable film in its own right.",1333152000,27,6490,4.857271906052394
4980229,5,B00695E1BY,"I respond to hype involving movies in a variety of different ways. If I get all excited about a film months before its release, I often find myself being disappointed with the film's final product. I saw a trailer for ""The Artist"" months back, and didn't think much of it, because I didn't know much about it. I had seen reviews and award acclaim for Michel Hazanavicius's ""The Artist"", and wanted to give it a shot. On account of the limited theatrical release that the film got, I found myself venturing toward the bad part of town the night before it happened to win the Golden Globe for best picture, and oh, was it worth it.

""The Artist"" is everything you could possibly want it to be. The story isn't anything revolutionary or surprising, but it really doesn't have to be. In case you have somehow not heard of this film yet, it is a silent film that is set in 1927, at the height of the silent movie era. It follows George Valentin, an actor who has had a great deal of success in silent film. The film follows the years where the film industry is moving into ""talkies"", where he finds his success is dwindling. He falls hard for Peppy Miller, an actress who is just breaking into the business. This story lasts over the span of maybe ten years.

While up until now, Hollywood has widely forgotten about the silent film era, the style of the film feels kind of experimental to a moviegoer of my generation. The film is a beautiful love letter to this period of film which we all have forgotten about. It makes me think that actors, writers, directors...everybody had to work a lot harder in that generation. It's hard to write a universally appealing story with no dialogue.

Style is a big deal, camera angles, and lighting are critical. I'm glad this one was released after I took my first Film Studies course at college, because there's a good chance a film like this would have slipped through my fingers otherwise. I learned about the silent film era, and found that there were twice as many flops as there were hits, in those days. This film could not have worked in those days, since it is clearly about the silent film era. However, I appreciate the little hidden history lesson that this film offered.

In a film with no dialogue, actors have to have very expressive faces, they have to be able to emote, which is also something that a wide amount of today's actors and actresses have forgotten how to do. Jean Dujardin's George Valentin is wonderful. His infectious smile is a big reason why the film works. It's the same deal with Berenice Bejo. The two actors have phenomenal chemistry, and that's enough to carry this, even if it were a bad film.

Like I said, this film's storyline is nothing new. It's the classic story of the Hollywood big cheese who helps the beautiful young starlet in her rise to fame. The film works because it's a story that can be shown in any country, in any language, and it would still be relevant. It's universal in a way that I didn't expect. The film doesn't use the titles that silent films are known for too much. There are titles, but they are used sparingly, only when they need it. That was a very good thing. For a film that's so strictly about filmmaking technique, being shot in glorious black and white, with a 4x3 aspect ratio, it's quite affecting. I give most of the credit to the actors, the extraordinary musical score by Ludovic Bource, and the direction. This was clearly a labor of love, and it pays off in a big way.

4980230,5,B00695E1BY,"It is a masterful movie-maker who can take a simple story (much less a silent one) and captivate an audience. That ""The Artist"" is so straight-forward is itself a tribute to the old adage that any story can capture the imagination, it just must be true to the soul. The genius here is that you are totally drawn into this world in near totality by the expressions on the actors' faces. It belies the fact that the silent film is indeed a lost art and we are fortunate to have it re-introduced to the main-stream in such a glorious fashion.

But first things first, this is *not* a stodgy, stick-in-the mud film. ""The Artist"" is at times laugh-out-loud, and then is equally engrossing as an emotional hay-maker. If you are expecting a dull yawn-fest, go see the latest CGI-laden summer film. But if in the the best sense you want to be captivated by a film, see ""The Artist"".

Without any giveaways, the story here involves an aging film star who is being left behind by the rise of the sound-age of film. Right behind him is a rising starlet who is excelling in the sound age. It is their story to tell: his from the perspective of the slide down and hers from the climb up. There is great supporting work as well, including a delightful little doggy who is essentially the side-kick to our hero. But it is lead actor Jean Dujardin who rightly ""steals"" the picture with his breath-taking emotional range.

Also a delight are the little scenes we as an audience identify with as true-isms: the bits of film magic that stick with you long after you leave the theater. The rising starlet using our hero's jacket in a pantomime, reflecting her awe and love of him, is the perfect example. But what tops it all in my mind are those moments where ""The Artist"" blends old-fashioned movie staples into itself and makes you want to cheer, though you know it's been done a thousand times before. An example being the aforementioned doggy as hero at one point. It is this homage to old films that makes you smile - the director is so skillful at it, he creates his own legitimate, unique and praise-worthy old-Hollywood world without it feeling stale in the least.

I think it is precisely because the character of George Valentin is so charming and irresistible at the outset that his fall from being the complacent object of unquestioning adoration to the strikingly unraveled and self-defeated has-been is so effective. The character of Peppy Miller and her saucily adroit rise to stardom is the perfect foil to George as their fortunes reverse.",1332979200,10,693,4.88135593220339

4980235,4,B00695E1BY,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

The mystery suggested in the title above permeates this absorbing, black-and-white, largely silent movie from the onset, when we witness late 1920s' silent movie star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), in his latest action epic, attached to some kind of electrical torture device operated by Russian spy operatives.  They urge him to ""Speak"", but he refuses.  And why should he speak?  The public zealously adores this handsome, suave, slightly egotistical ham and his faithful, ubiquitous, fox terrier Jack (Uggie) - except maybe his resentful, neglected wife Doris (Penelope Ann Miller).  The fans mob him, especially persistent, winsome ingenue Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo).  George is king of the Hollywood silents, until Hollywood becomes enamored of sound.  A matinee idol like George should have no trouble transitioning to talkies, right?  But he stubbornly resists.  Is it his uncompromising artistic sense, or something more latent?

This ""vow of silence"" mystery enhances ""The Artist"".  As the movie examines the incremental emotional, financial, and marital toll exacted by George's obstinacy, we are entertained and engrossed, even though anyone with even a passing familiarity with the antediluvian plottings of ""A Star is Born"" and ""Citizen Kane"" can more or less predict the stages of George's fall.  Doris leaves him; his self-financed silent film bombs; he can no longer retain his chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell); his studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) dismisses him as washed up unless he hops on the talkie train.  Most galling of all, Peppy rises through the talkie ranks to become a famous actress (due in part to the fake mole George playfully draws on her right cheek).  The audience forsakes George for Peppy.  He loses his home and possessions. He drinks.  He burns his library of movie reels (except one).  Even the outside world (e.g. the ""Lonely Star"" marquee and the quicksand scene of his silent flop) seems to mock him.  George thinks of ending it all.  Many of you have seen this before, even as ""The Artist"" makes its simultaneously adoring and satirical overview of late 20's Hollywood, the transience and superficiality of fame, and the importance of true, loyal friends entertaining.

However, we stick with George because we mentally exhort him to swallow his pride and artistic ethics, and give the talkies a whirl.  Jack saves George's life from the fire he started.  Clifton reluctantly leaves George's employ, but returns as Peppy's chauffeur.  A grateful Peppy never forgets George's initial support on the way to the top, and even drives frantically (and badly) through the Hollywood streets to prevent George's suicide.  She may even have a solution to George's dilemma...

""The Artist"" gives a clue to George's mystery toward the end, when we finally hear George speak.  Then, I think, the answer becomes clear, especially if the phrase ""ethnic discrimination"" comes to mind.",1332201600,,2966,5.284188034188034

Not only is the acting and direction absolutely impeccable, but it is the unique way of telling this story that is what makes it great.  It is a silent film.  Well, almost.  There is a handful of words used very sparinglingly. It is all told with gestures and subtitles and it is amazing in its complexity and in the emotions it evokes. The team who created it are indeed geniuses.

Starring Jean Dujardin as a silent film star who is disposed when talkies become popular and Berenice Bejo as the young woman who loves him, this is an amazing film with the sweep and drama of a classic.  I also must mention the little dog who could also be considered a star in its own right.

4980240,2,B00695E1BY,"I watched this Oscar-winning BEST PICTURE and couldn't believe what I was watching.  Having seen all three versions of A STAR IS BORN I was completely floored at how blatantly borrowed the storyline for this film was.  I kept waiting for a twist, a new road, an imaginative leap.  And all there was to the plot was A STAR IS BORN...but with a happy - or sappy - ending.  Speaking of ""sappy ending"" this film also borrowed much from Scorsese's NEW YORK, NEW YORK.  And in the dressing room scene where sound begins to intrude upon the Artist's life I expected the camera to pan over and there'd be Rod Serling!  So a pinch of the recipe for this movie was also lifted from THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  SINGING IN THE RAIN is also in the mix - and lest less knowledgeable viewers think that Ludovic Bource composed the entire score, he didn't.  Borrowed was the best piece of music in the film - a long, passionate crescendo from Bernard Herrmann's score for Hitchcock's VERTIGO.  Why couldn't the composer have come up with something of his own for this pivotal sequence in THE ARTIST?  Why couldn't the story have the least bit of originality to it?  Why was Malcolm McDowell even bothered for a pointless part lasting all of twenty seconds?  Why didn't the truly best actor in the movie win the Oscar instead - and that was Uggie the dog?  Why was this movie even made?

Some people will claim that this movie is an homage to all movies in general.  That sounds good and noble.  But when ALL a movie is is one homageful scene after another...then, to me, the effort smacks more of unoriginality than anything else.  And I still can't figure out why music from a 1958 Alfred Hitchcock movie was used to help score a movie dealing with the transitional phase from silent to sound in the history of the cinema.  What was the true aesthetic rationale for this choice?  Laziness, perhaps?

I will say this:  for viewers NOT familiar with the body parts that went to fashion this Frankenstein's monster of a movie, the story may seem wonderful.
And it is a very good thing that this movie is getting attention. But not for this movie's sake.  No.  But if watching this silent, black and white film can excite younger viewers to want to see more black and white and even actual films from the silent era, then that is a very good thing.  And I must admit that it was refeshing to see a movie without a single CGI shot in it!

I firmly believe that this movie will go down as the best directed, acted, and edited in the history of film.  In addition, it has a beautiful score that John Williams or any of the other greats would be proud of.

I saw the movie again yesterday (3/6/2012) and interviewed many members of the audience as we left the theater.  They all agreed with me that ""The Artist"" is engrossing and wonderful.

4980244,5,B00695E1BY,"My first ideas about The Artist were that it was a re-hash of A Star is Born but I was pleasantly surprised by the story and the marvelous performances.  The performances by Jean Dujardin, as silent movie star George Valentin, is a tour-de-force and magnificently conveys all the emotions of his fall from stardom.

The film begins in 1927 when Valentin (modeled after Douglas Fairbanks) is at the top of his profession. He has a chance meeting with (and is attracted to) a young dancer and would-be actress, beautifully played by B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo.  As it was for many stars of silent films, Valentin has problems adapting to sound movies. At the time, sound was considered a fad by many but audiences proved such ideas a fallacy, forcing studios to switch to sound as fast as possible.  Valentin bucks the trend by making an expensive silent film that bombs at the box office while the actress he had previously befriended is starring in a blockbuster under the name Peppy Miller.  The film chronicles the rise of Peppy Miller's star as Valentin fades into oblivion, helped by the Great Depression.

I have had a long affection for silent films so it came as a nice surprise that The Artist was filmed using the same size film that produces a square box on the screen. The cinematography (by Guillaume Schiffman) was also reminiscent of silent film and was tones of the film were superbly rendered.  Interesting that a small clip from Fairbanks' Mark Of Zorro was included in the scene where Valentin is watching one of his movies. John Goodman was fabulous as movie mogul Al Zimmer and James Cromwell was terrific as Clifton, Valentin's supportive chauffer. It was also fun to see Malcolm McDowell in a bit part. And lest we forget, Uggie the dog certainly made the movie special and charming.

Much credit for the success of the film goes to Michel Hazanavicius, who took quite a chance of making a silent film.  The period of the 1920's and 30's was beautifully broght to life.  I hope that The Artist places more focus on silent films, as they are beautiful works of art even if sometimes the acting is old-fashioned.",1330905600,6,2133,4.7560975609756095
4980245,5,B00695E1BY,"I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...

A black-and-white silent movie made in 2011?  How refreshing!  Now that's thinking outside the box.  When I heard about this movie, I had to see it since I like some of the silent movies from the 1920s era.  This movie is an example of the concept of ""less is more"" - the less technology that's used, the better off the movie is.  This movie is silent.  No words are spoken.  Just the musical score by Ludovic Bource is playing throughout.  The actors' facial expressions let you know what is transpiring onscreen.  This movie is also in black-and-white.  The movie being black-and-white and silent might turn off a lot of people, especially young people, but I say give it a chance.  This movie won five Academy Awards on February 26, 2012.

Set in the period from 1927-1932, this movie is about an actor from the silent era whose career is going downhill when talkies start taking over as the new and preferred type of movie.  He soon has a relationship with a young up-and-coming actress.  That's all I want to say without spoiling anything.  This movie pays homage to the silent era in movie history.  It also pays homage to a lot of the greatest movies ever made.  One thing you'll notice is that a piece of Bernard Herrmann's music to Vertigo (1958) is used in this movie.  Vertigo star Kim Novak said that Herrmann's music to Vertigo shouldn't be in this movie.  I agree with her.  This movie is definitely a refreshing idea, but to include music from Vertigo was a mistake.  It made me immediately have a flashback to that movie.  It actually distracted me from concentrating on The Artist.  Instead, I was picturing Kim Novak and Jimmy Stewart.  Original music should have been used instead.  That's the only problem I have with The Artist.

I give this movie 4 1/2 stars, rounded up to 5, and it isn't because of the use of Herrmann's music.  I just feel it's a 4 1/2 star movie.",1330819200,,1942,4.518731988472623
4980246,4,B00695E1BY,"""The Artist"" is a French romantic comedy drama genre film set during the transition period of silent to speaking films from 1927 - 1932, in Hollywood.

George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a star of the silent film industry, and during a fan and media appearance at a movie premier screening, chemistry is established almost instantly between he and Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), which is a meeting by chance.

Valentin's career seems to only be limited by the sky, yet his unwillingness to shift into speaking films paves the way for Miller to cement herself as an actress, having again dazzled Valentin as a dancer in one of his last silent works.

Like so many actors who assume that their name brand can flourish without the studios Valentin makes his own film, which is far overshadowed by Miller's new stardom and movie premiering on the same day as his.

The story of Valentin's decline is the essence of the film narrative, and it is a valuable reminder of how quickly fame can evaporate.

The cinematography captures the era with authenticity by utilising great costume and set design.

As a silent film the emotions of the characters and their progression is conveyed richly with quality acting and a well constructed story.

4980247,3,B00695E1BY,"I might have liked this film but for its story. Anything would have been more interesting than another film about films and a slient movie about the end of slient movies. The same essential story has been done over and over again. Jean Dujardin does a fine job acting out the paint by numbers script and the novelty of reproducing the old form all the way down to the aspect ratio is interesting for a while. And the dog was good.

But its all style and no substance. There are all sorts of ways that they could have gone with the story other than dump the whole bag of cliches out. The transition from slient to talking films is about more than just the actors whose careers ended. Sllient films were an international art form while talkies were inherently tied to the language of the performers. Talking films ended up being (initally) much more static and much more controlled (the need for a set where sound was controlled). And the accompying ""industralization"" of film production. All sorts of directions that are much more interesting that the old cliche about the out of work actor on the downward spiral.

4980248,3,B00695E1BY,"Basically, it's a retelling of A Star is Born with some plot changes. This movie started well, ended well, and had a long stretch in the middle that was repetitive, one after another episode of drinking and self-destruction, basically a long narrative of the main character's depression. I felt like yelling ""do an intervention with this guy, will you?"" That being said, there are some very clever bits of storytelling and acting. The dog was amazing but I was more worried for him than the human characters, especially with all that secondhand smoke he was inhaling.
There are a lot of films that play on human frailty as art but after a lifetime of watching what actually happens to people who live like this, I have no patience with it in fiction. There were no insights or revelations about it, no play on the metaphor of sound vs silent, just one downhill slide scene after another. At the end there was a deus ex machina twist that set it all aright, reminding me of Judy and Mickey resolving a plot with a musical number.

4980249,3,B00695E1BY,"The Artist is an almost totally silent film made by Michel Hazanavicious starring Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, John Goodman, James Cromwell & Penelope Ann Miller. Set in 1927 Hollywood as the Talkies are set to replace silent films. It chronicles the troubles of a great silent film star who doesn't want to be in talkies.

The first half of the film is all a movie-goer could want. It has outrageous expressions on the faces of the silent actors in place of dialogue. Quirky & fun camera angles plus cute little comedy scenes & the regulation lovable dog that is as well trained as any other actor on the set. The beginnings of a failed marriage (done in a hilarious manner) & a budding new romance follow suit.

It's the development of these that mystified both me & my wife. You'd figure that there was a concrete reason that our star (the artist) doesn't want to be in talkies as well as a reason that no one offers him a chance later. It takes the whole movie to find out this cannot be true. The motivations & goals of this budding romance are disjointed & unfocused even at the end. Was it romance, was it friendly concern, or was it just a coincidence that stuck like glue. There is a scene early-on that leaves no doubt about what is in the woman's mind but it plays no part later on.

The second half of the movie is the man's life on the skids surrounded by people concerned for his welfare. His alcoholism & self destructive behavior, which is agonizingly drawn out to the point of boredom & greatly overacted even for a silent, gives far too much time to see the ending coming, as well as wish you were somewhere else. The second half is as bad as the first half is good. The music, costuming, sets & cinematography are worth seeing though. It's easy to see tie-ins to Singing in the Rain & A Star is Born. Truth be told they probably should have used a better tie-in to A Star is Born but that would have led to a different & hopefully better ending. You never really get inside the guys head beyond mulish pride & you see that 5 min's into the show. It starts with a grin & ends with a grin, they even had a miniature Rin Tin Tin.

They just don't make them like they used to ... no really.

The Artist is a film set in classic 1920's Hollywood, the silent era.  A movie that stands out from others as a unique and different tale of cinema.  It takes a chance, and as almost all of critics everywhere agree, it gambles and wins!  The Weinsteins chose wisely when they chose Michel Hazanavicius' masterpiece!

The Artist takes place during the slient era and our hero, Geroge Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is the top movie star of the period.  He runs into a girl Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) who's trying to break into the industry and become an acttress herself.

As time passes, The Great Depression hits, and talking pictures are born.  The world gradually moves away from the silent era and its stars and want to see a new face, Peppy Miller.  So the tides turn and the new face of Hollywood is now Peppy Miller.  We see over the course of time how the relationship between the two matriculates as they both fight for their careers and fall in love in the process!

We see the talents of James Cromwell, as Clifton, the hired help of George Valentine.  Malcolm McDowell, the extra/bit player.  As well as the amazing job of veteran John Goodman, Al Zimmer, the classic, stereotypical movie studio executive of the era as he and George Valentin quest for greatness and success in the world of movies!  A brilliantly put together cast!

This is a silent picture, as if it were spit out directly from 1927 itself, and it fits right in in it's own new 2011 way!  So with this being a silent film, the music of the picture has to carry your film as it's one of the MAIN characters of the story and The Artist never fails to deliver in this category!  So composer, Ludovic Bource, who passed up a lot of big budget, important work to score this film made a wise career move, as movies like this just don't come around that often.  A movie that can stand the test of time and can easily be called one of the best of the decade!  Utilizing the talents of the greatest composer of all time in my opinion, Bernard Herrmann, GENIUS!!  I was in tears when I heard his famous music from the greatest score ever composed used in The Artist! That scene alone speaks volumes more than most movies that come around!

The art of cinema just took a giant leap forward in the battle of quantity vs. quality.  Money just doesn't matter when you see such quality of filmmaking at its finest!

The Artist ... the BEST movie ... of the year!",1330387200,6,2502,4.424507658643326
4980253,5,B00695E1BY,"On the brink of a night of tinsel town and red carpet, a film comes along that brings back the shining light to celluloid.  The Artist is that film that will automatically draw one's attention to nostalgia and an era in Hollywood's ultimate heyday before the ""Talkies"".  Indeed, an exceptional recreation of a time when the actor was literally an artist at his craft, consider the greats Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford that have proven that fact.  But all is not lost of that era because if one were ever to venture off to the movies, there still exists films that capture the emotion, drama, and humor within a film similar to The Artist.  That type of movie will most likely be found in a foreign film across the oceans or independent film that tends to appear at the Sundance Film Festival.

However, setting aside parallels, The Artist is a historical film testament of how holding onto the past may have much relevance to the present.  This was the case with the main characters of the film silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) up and coming Hollywood starlet Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo) and supporting actors the Jack Rusell Terrier (Uggie), silent film director (John Goodman) and chauffer Clifton (James Cromwell).  With the film running a little over 90 minutes, the acting speaks for itself along with the cinematography and the soundtrack.  For viewers who are not accustomed to silent films, this indeed was a treat to have such a film made during this era of endless technology.  And within the film, George and Peppy also had to contend with technology during their lifetime that was either of decline or acceptance as Hollywood moved into a new decade away from silent movies to the so-called ""Talkies"" where viewers actually saw and heard all of the actions and words spoken by the actors; today that fact may be irrelevant but that major innovation changed the face of Hollywood and how films were made and drew an audience.  This is clearly shown when George is reluctant while Peppy wholeheartedly welcomes the advancement with open arms and eventually upstages George; this is a good example of how remaining stagnant does much harm while progressing paves the way for success.

The Artist is an exceptional film filled with though provoking moments and bravado, especially the concluding dance number at the end of the film.  No doubt, the era has been depicted in the movie quite similar to the original films produced during the late 1920s and 1930s.  Full acclamations are due to the entire production team and director Michel Hazanavicius.",1330128000,6,2626,4.914027149321267
4980254,4,B00695E1BY,"The Artist is a little gem of a silent film that was shot in black and white.  This clever throwback to old Hollywood was the work of a French production team with American support and headed by director Michel Hazanavicius.  Not since Mel Brooks had the clout and audacity to make his Silent Movie in 1976 had a silent film been shot on a grand scale.  Brooks had the advantage of blockbuster name recognition from his previous films and enlisting A list stars to do his film in color no less.  The Artist has no superstars, and instead the film relies on telling a compassionate story that is surprisingly accessible to modern audiences.

In 1927 Hollywood, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a matinee idol whose films are popular with the masses.  At one Hollywood premier, he shows off his loyal dog (Uggie), and at the red carpet, he bumps into a fan, Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo), who has dreams of making it in movies.  George's home life is not so happy as his eccentric wife (Penelope Ann Miller) disapproves of his carefree antics. Meanwhile, Peppy auditions for and wins a bit part in a chorus line and by chance meets Valentin again who hires her for his film despite the grumblings of the studio boss (a wonderful John Goodman).  During a dance club scene, the two have instant chemistry and a romance is blossoming even as Valentin has doubts and feeling guilty as a married man. When the studio begins to embrace the sound era, he refuses to change with the times and finds sinking box office grosses and waning popularity while Peppy is a fast rising star.  When the stock market crashes, Valentin is ruined financially and, his career in a heap, all hope is seemingly lost until a shining beacon comes to his aid with a novel plan.

This is a silent film that caught everyone by surprise with its deceptively simple plot of romance, drama, comedy, and pathos.  If that sounds like a Charlie Chaplin film, the kind of film they don't make anymore, it's because they haven't for over eighty years!  People who respond to this film owe it to themselves to rediscover the classic silent films like Chaplin's City Lights and The General by Buster Keaton.  The Artist is an ideal introduction to these and other masterworks.

The film borrows liberally from past cinema, and its main plot is right out of A Star Is Born.  When Valentin is seated at the dinner table with his judgmental wife, it begs comparisons to the famous transitions at the dinner table in Citizen Kane.  The scenes where the studio is switching to sound pictures is reminiscent of the same dilemma in Singin in the Rain.  The dog, who steals the film, is terrific as comic relief and figures in a scene where he attempts to rescue his master from a burning building-Rin Tin Tin anyone?

Although the musical score by Ludovic Bource is quite good particularly in the playful main theme, it uses several minutes of a love theme from Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo for a climactic sequence.  It works just fine, but purists who recognize Bernard Herrmann's haunting score may find it a tad annoying.  There are also a couple brief instances when actual sound is employed to great effect.

There are memorable moments including a loyal chauffeur (James Cromwell) who refuses to leave Valentin during his decline.  There is a sentimental scene where Valentin has sold all his belongings and stands wistfully at a pawn shop, his refection superimposed with a tuxedo on display.  And this may be one of the only times you see someone flip the bird in a silent film!

Sure, some of the scenes are filled with old fashioned movie clichs, but what is noticeable throughout the film is an energy and enthusiasm that becomes infectious even after the novelty of watching a soundless film wears off.  And consider this-an engaging silent film with no nudity or violence that is riding a wave of sentiment and love all the way to the Oscars.",1330041600,2,3905,4.698972099853157

This indicates a clear signal as well as a visible conceptual exhaustation inside Hollywood screenplayers. Let`s be honest. The artist is an emblematic and even nostalgic vision respect a forgotten era. The film scrutinizes around the decisive breakthrough of a succesful silent actor.

We are aware that Greta Garbo's voice never collated with her classical beauty. In this sense what I most liked of the film (and perhaps its major originality)is the smart homage to great films of the past. The cites about Citizen KLane (notice the sequence in which Jean Dujardin is at the front of a typewriter; the clever episode in which we can enjoy the great soundtrack of Vertigo; obviously there's a blink respect Billy Wilder's  Sunset Boulevard and the final curtain in which the image of Fred Astaire is more than evident.

The two other films in the past which adressed this issue were Cinema Paradiso  and Good morning Babylon (curiously from two Italian filmakers such as Tornatore and Taviani brothers). The flexible visual narrative, the rhthym of an agile script, the presence of this extraordinary actor (a blend of Rodolfo Valentino and Jorge Negrete) make of this original proposal the great surprise of the year.

Here - between you and me - the Golden Globe awards have always been one step ahead respect the Academy Awards in which concern audacious proposals; but at the end, I guess this film will monopolize Best Motion Picture and probably Best Director and Best Actor (that would mean for France the second feat after the lovable Marion Cotillard in 2007).

But, far beyond the prizes that can win this work; it represents -by itself- the fresh air intake so crowded of galactic special effects.

Woody Allens Midnight in Paris cleverly explores the idea that we always yearn to live that golden period when all our heroes were alive, and introduces real characters from that period. Hugo, explores the world of a genius of the silent screen, with parallels between life and art in the movie.

My week with Marilym, unfortunately not nominated for Best Picture, receiving two acting nominations, explores a movie within a movie with two actors delivering amazing performances. The Descendants starring George Clooney, set in Hawaii explores the past in a most charming way in terms of now to show how to be responsible for the legacy of the past while dealing with a major family drama.

The Artist explores the idea of love, stardom, and hubris set in the silent screen era of the 1920s, and received 10 nominations including all the biggies, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Music.

Jean Dujardin looking like a young Sean Connery, plays an aging silent screen star. As the movie begins he plays a character within a movie that refuses to talk. Soon life will mirror art. Sometimes it's difrficult to tell then apart.

He accidentally bumps into an adorable young woman, Peppy Miller, who hopes to hit the big time. Soon they will accidentally meet again. I loved the impromptu dance sequence. They work together in a movie. I loved the mutiple take dance sequence. The attraction is undeniable. He gives her a beauty spot, and advice, advice which she follows to his detriment.

As the times change from silent to talk, George suffers. Soon his star falls as Peppy rises to fame and, the old guard gives way to a new generation, and pride can become an obstruction to love. It makes you wonder if these two star crossed lovers will ever work it out, and find an opportunity to love each other regardless of personal circumstance.

The Artist is a silent conversation about love, and who needs extensive conversation when you have two such photogenic and charismatic actors who can move us with with the crinkle of an eyebrow, or a few dance steps, whether that eyebrow expresses consternation, woe, and even occasionally joy.

Undoubtedly The Artist is the most adorable movie of the year, and it did take a huge risk in daring to be a silent movie in a talking world. Happily, it is of such a high quality that is has been nominated for everything. It's main competition appears to be The Descendants. Both Clooney and Dujardin are charming and charismatic.

The essence of the film is the life of George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) who is at the top of his acting craft in 1927.  This was as ominous year. It's when talkies were first introduced with Al Jolson as the jazz singer.  But Gorge can see no value in the talkies. He perseveres with his silent films and progressively goes backwards. The Great Depression arrives and he hits rock bottom.  His life can be contrasted with that of Peppy Miller, his love interest come nemesis, who positively sparkles with the new talking medium. She goes from strength to strength.  However, without spoiling the end for those who have not seen the film, their lives coincide again after having drifted apart.  There is a happy ending.

Does the film work?  Well, it's very clever and, against the imprecations of the late W.C. Fields, there is also a starring role for George's dog.  But, to me, there was something missing.  You can only go so far with a single trick.  For all its charming players and the wonderful feel good aspect of the drama, I felt that it had been somewhat over-hyped.

The Artist was a film project I'm sure wasn't welcomed by producers and finance men. After all, little speaking, black and white, and subtitles aren't considered terrific box office today. I'm glad someone did recognize how brilliant and beautiful this film could be.

Jean Dujardin gives the performance of the year. No question. Funny, sad, using his body the way silent stars did so well. Berenice Bejo matches him in every scene.

What a fresh and fun film! French director Michel Hazanavicius (OSS 117) has brought `magic' back to the silver screen! It's a silent film. Complete with title cards for dialogue and an enriched musical score that advances the story and moves the heart!

An independent foreign film on its own it tells the story of a Silent Movie star who doesn't quite make the transition to sound-sync films. The two leads played by two French actors Jean Dujardin and Brnice Bejo who are both filled with French TV and film  credits from their individual careers  that on screen in this film they are sharp, electric and filled with on-screen chemistry. The on screen chemistry of the two of them sparkle with life and energy.

Another star of the film is the puppy owned by the lead actor played by an extremely well trained and scene stealing Jack Russell dog named Uggie (his name in real life). This dog does some amazing moves and stunts and warms your heart and literally `saves' the story in an amazing way.

The film has a fresh and crisp look in its cinematography and very spot-on on costuming and production design that you actually forget the movie is silent (almost 100%) and are enveloped in the story and characters.

This movie will make you laugh, cry and laugh again.....and has some `silent' performances from John Goodman (""Monsters, Inc."", ""Rosanne"") playing a movie producer with a big bite, Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Entourage"") playing a fellow extra waiting for his break into movies and James Cromwell (""Star Trek First Contact"", ""Babe"") the steady and loyal valet of the movie star himself.

For me - it's a hard pick between ""The Artist"" and ""The Descendants"" for best picture this year. One thing is for sure - it definitely deserved all ten nominations it received  this year: Actor In a Leading Role - Jean Dujardin, Actress In a Supporting Role - Brnice Bejo, Art Direction - Laurence Bennett (Production Design); Robert Gould (Set Decoration),  Best Picture, Cinematography- Guillaume Schiffman,  Costume Design - Mark Bridges, Directing - Michel Hazanavicius, Film Editing - Anne-Sophie Bion and Michel Hazanavicius,  Music (Original Score) - Ludovic Bource. and Writing (Original Screenplay) - Michel Hazanavicius.

Definitely a must see film for the whole family. A beautiful motion picture with characters and a story you'll remember for a long time!",1328572800,5,2422,5.0099750623441395

Onstage, suave matinee-idol George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) hams it up at the premiere of his latest flick before a packed house of smartly dressed Jazz Agers. In this cinematic love letter written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, Valentin's character is sealed with a kiss blown back to such icons as Douglas Fairbanks as well as sound star Gene Kelly....

Despite Dujardin's charming, nimble presence (he won Cannes' Best Actor award), the real star of the show is the film itself, a jaunty black-and-white trip down the memory lane of the silver screen. Shot in the boxy 1.33 celluloid format of old, ""The Artist"" is anything but square; it looks so positively right that its negative might have been uncanned from the vaults of MGM, Paramount or Fox (pre-Murdoch) during the bygone studio years....

Audiences may be amazed and delighted by Hazanavicius's adoring attention to period detail, from Murphy beds and ""Pickfair""-era Hollywood mansions to such quaint screen punctuations as wipes, irises and slow fades. While ""The Artist"" borrows too much to be an artistic masterpiece in its own right, it deserves a joyful exclamation--aloud--for its heart.

4980266,2,B00695E1BY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The Weinstein Brothers strike again by bringing French director Michael Hazanavicius' silent film tribute, 'The Artist', to the United States, now in the running for possible Oscar Gold. To my recollection, silent films wore out their welcome way back in 1927, and only something strikingly original, should be considered for the Academy's highest honor. While Hazanavicius does his best at technically putting together the kind of film they made in the silent era (and he certainly doesn't get 'everything' right), story wise, his narrative is completely derivative. There's nary a single original idea in the entire picture.

Hazanavicius' protagonist is George Valentin, obviously named after silent screen legend himself, Rudolph Valentino. Valentin's character, a heartthrob before the advent of the talkies, is modeled historically more on silent screen star, John Gilbert, than Valentino. After the introduction of the talkies, Gilbert's career fell apart, not because the sound of his voice didn't sit well with audiences now accustomed to 'talking pictures', but because he was saddled with inferior scripts and the one or two good pictures he was in, did not find wide favor with the public. Like Valentin in 'The Artist', Gilbert also proceeded to self-destruct by embracing the bottle.

The Artist's narrative is based both on films from the silent era as well some classic sound pictures. 'The Count of Monte Cristo', one of Gilbert's well-known silent era films as well as Douglas Fairbanks' 'The Three Musketeers"" are alluded to when Valentin is seen in one of the 'pictures within a picture', playing an action hero swordsman. Silent era melodrama is also referenced when Valentin's dog, Jack, alerts a policeman on the beat, who runs into the fading screen star's home, and saves him from a raging fire. I can't help being reminded of the early sound serial, 'The Little Rascals', where dogs are used to a more comic effect. Early in 'The Artist', Jack is featured in an amusing bit, running to and fro, on stage.

While there are many allusions to actual silent films and very early talkies in 'The Artist', the basic plot is derived from two later classic 'sound' films. In 'The Artist', Valentin, a once successful actor, now in sad decline after a successful career, finds himself supplanted by a love interest, who has gone on to a successful career of her own as a celebrity actor, but offers to rescue him out of both feelings of love and guilt. This in essence is the story of 'A Star Is Born', made in the 30s and later revived in the 50s, as a Judy Garland vehicle. One also cannot ignore the parallels to 'Sunset Boulevard', which features a story that in part revolves around the movie studio system. 'The Artist' even has its own chauffeur, Clifton, played by James Cromwell, that echos the chauffeur role in 'Sunset Boulevard', famously played by Erich Von Stroheim. Should I also mention how Mr. Hazanavicius can't help himself throw in a bit from 'Citizen Kane'? When Valentin uncovers all his auctioned effects which Peppy had purchased for him, it's a scene completely reminiscent from 'Citizen Kane', where all of Kane's property sits in storage, covered by similar white cloths. And what of Hazanavicius' lazy use of music composed by Bernard Hermann, associated with both Orson Welles and Hitchcock? It seems that Ludovic Bource simply ran out of ideas and perhaps was unable to complete the score. A more likely scenario is that Hazanavicius simply wanted to save money by licensing Hermann's Hitchcock soundtrack.

There is little point in rehashing the details of Hazanvicius' derivative and pointless plot. Suffice it to say, it's Valentin who ironically discovers kindly Peppy Martin, after she accidentally crashes through a roped off area of Valentin groupies, and is photographed by paparazzi. After sad sack Valentin feels sorry for himself after falling from grace as a silent screen star and Peppy becomes famous in the talkies, he takes to the bottle and is about to kill himself. Leave it to Jack to save him along with Peppy, who recalls that Valentin is actually a talented dancer, and suggests to the Kinograph studio honcho, that they could make a great pair, as the next Rogers and Astaire-like dance team.

If 'The Artist' has any value, is in its fairly faithful recreation of a bygone era. It's fun watching how director Hazanavicius utilizes the costumes, makeup and set design, as well as the many techniques of silent film era cinematography to create the final product, which best can be described as a 'loving tribute'. Nonetheless, Hazanavicius has chosen merely to emulate the traditional conventions of the silent film era than create an original, final product. One is reminded more of a 'B' melodrama from that era than one of the classics, such as the kind proffered up by a Chaplin or Keaton.

It's a sad state of affairs when a less than mediocre story, created in a now defunct style of filmmaking (which was put to rest over seventy years ago), garners some of the top awards from the chief pundits in today's film industry. It only goes to show how hard up the film industry is, in its ability to discover and promote quality scripts, instead resorting to the dubious tactic of reaching back to yesteryear, for ill-advised inspiration.",1328400000,11,5352,5.0

Starring  Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo and John Goodman

I make an effort to see all of the major Oscar bait, even if it's something that I am not sure I'll like. The Artist falls into that category. I have no problem with black and white or the use of the 1.37:1 aspect ratio, but a silent movie? The idea itself is superb of course. Most moviegoers are too young to remember the silent era, so why not provide a similar experience using modern technology?

Most of the reviews I have read have praised the movie and it's scooping awards at every major show. Is the hype justified?

Well, it was certainly an interesting experience. The audience was very respectful and quieter than for most movies. The movie is silent for the most part, but finds a couple of inventive ways to use both sounds and spoken dialogue. It's easy to follow the rather simple story and title cards are used when something absolutely has to be communicated to the audience. The acting is very good. Dujardin and Bejo have expressive faces that are up to the task. Dujardin has a lot of charm and seems to portray happiness with ease.

The audience didn't become involved very often. What few laughs there were usually came in response to the antics of Uggie the dog. In fact, that's the problem right there; involvement. The Artist was clever. I applaud the idea and the execution, but I just wasn't emotionally invested with the characters and the outcome. I found myself smiling at the technical feat of showing us 1927 and creating the atmosphere of the silent movie experience, but I didn't care enough about the characters.

Most of my favorite movies are driven by dialogue. I relish watching a Tarantino movie and could listen to the characters talk for hours. When that's removed, for me, so is some of the enjoyment.

I'll remember The Artist as a good idea that captured the imagination of a modern audience, but when you strip it down to what's actually on the screen and examine the strength of the story, something is lacking. I'm glad I saw it, but I won't buy it as I don't need to see it again. When the credits started rolling at the end of The Descendants and Midnight in Paris, I would have been happy to watch them again immediately. The Artist will probably win Best Picture at the Oscars, but I think eventually we'll look back at 2011 and think that it wasn't the best film that year.

For the idea and execution: 5/5
For the strength of story and replay value: 3/5",1328313600,,2553,4.595604395604395
4980268,5,B00695E1BY,"I will not repeat the accolades others have mentioned. THE ARTIST delivers pathos, humor and romance in so many surprising ways, I find it difficult to compare to other films this year. Bejo and Dujardin are both superb, and Cromwell's supporting performance is deeply satisfying. The entire undertaking was daring, given the fickle tastes of the viewing public, but here's where it succeeds for me:

1. Although the story takes place in another era, the situations its characters endure, and the many universal themes of its screenplay are so timely to those who feel obsolete, to those who struggle, it's simply remarkable.

2. The film overflows with great romance without seedy overtones or skin. The protagonists are also quite decent.

3. Direction.  Take all the elements that coalesce to make a great film.  I'm hard-pressed to find any missing here.  Brilliant performances, eye-candy cinematography, warmth and humor, expert pacing, and a fine musical score which reflects so accurately the cultural domain of the film.

4. What you take away:  Hope, pure and simple. Who among us wouldn't benefit from that.

The last independent film which affected me this way was CINEMA PARADISO. Now, in the throes of the award season, there are fine international competitors, but this film crosses the line by a head because of the director's love of his subject, period and theme.  Deeply moving, gripping, and wonderfully funny. (Great dog, too!)

4980269,5,B00695E1BY,"I don't know if ""The Artist"" is the best movie of 2011 but it is certainly the most charming, original and unexpected. To make in 2011, in the age of the breathtaking and jaw-dropping video possibilities, sound techniques and rapidly becoming the common place 3D, the authentically looking and feeling black and white SILENT movie just like they made them back in 1927, it takes guts, talent, and deep and tender love and admiration for above mentioned movies. It takes the director/writer who not only had a dream of bringing the long gone era of cinema's adolescence on big screen but made his dream come true. It takes two basically unknown to the American audiences French actors who were splendid as the stars of the silent pictures in the silent picture (Jean Dujardin and Brnice Bejo). They were helped by John Goodman, James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle, and Malcolm McDowell). Let's not forget one special four-legged artist (or there were three of them?) - the cutest, smartest, and most loyal dog that ever graced the screen.

I wanted to see the film since I first read about and I expected to like it but I did not expect it to be not only technically perfect and very funny but also melodramatic in the best, sadly almost lost now, meaning of the word. I expected more lighthearted comedy but it is more tragic comedy. It is easy to overdo the melodrama but it never happened with The Artist. It is beautiful, romantic, funny, and spectacular. Jean Dujardin and Brnice Bejo are the best silent era couple on screen since well.. the end of the silent era.

As I am writing, ""The Artist"" is one of the major contenders for the Best Picture of the year Oscar having received already the awards from many prestigious organizations and made the countless critics list. Ironically, in the case of ""The Artist"" to be noticed and heard meant to go completely silent. Is it not miraculous? Another observation - language of cinema is truly international: one of the sweetest love letters to the Hollywood early years is created by a European director, French Michel Hazanavicius. His film speaks the native film language that involves the images, gestures, eyes, faces, and most importantly - the soul to perfection. It speaks clearly and loudly to movie lovers everywhere. ""The Artist"" is artistique, fantastique, magnifique, et trs charmant.",1328054400,,2361,4.870646766169155

4980271,5,B00695E1BY,"The Artist (2011, directed by Michel Hazanavicius)

I never expected the day would come when I'd see a new silent film in the digital age, but that's exactly what's happened, and it's wonderful. The Artist is a feel good hour-and-a-half voyage eighty-five years back in time when silent pictures, and their actors, were discarded by the wayside not only for talkies, but up-and-coming beauties to narrate them.

There's a deeper message here. Sadly, the majority of men, no matter their discipline, will likely outlive their industry; disposable parts to newer, shinier engines. It's a grim truth, but not entirely despairing. What Artist does particularly well is celebrate the grandparent form that gave us life. Whereas films nowadays use lengthy dialogues to bring viewers to speed, silent films could not, employing animal emotions, bodily narratives, and instinctual improvisation to carry the chronicle.

I imagine Hazanavicius kept his fingers crossed every step of the way, even recording in full screen format to make everything about his film feel historically genuine. My only complaint is that Artist ended on a happier note than for most actual silent actors, perhaps because this conclusion isn't projected from 1932. Perhaps Hazanavicius wants us, in 2012, to gaze, smile, and declare: They live on!

4980273,5,B00695E1BY,"Having heard all the awards season buzz about The Artist, I was inclined to see the film, despite many criticisms I had heard voiced about it being a mostly silent film. And can I say, the film is no less entertaining for it's lack of vocal dialogue. Though many may fault the film for this, I found it to create a refreshingly different film for theatre-going audiences who have likely never seen a such a film. With delightful performances from Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo in particular, the two create characters that are an absolute pleasure to watch throughout the movie. (Not to mention the adorably charming dog!) The film as a whole creates a beautiful presentation of the classic era of Hollywood, not only in plot, but in how the film is presented and filmed, and is an absolute must-see for anyone who treasures Hollywood and the history of the filmmaking industry.",1327708800,4,880,4.758169934640523

4980276,5,B00695E1BY,"Who would have thought that in 2011 one of the best movies of the year would be silent!?

Old silent movies required the actors to overact, ""mug"", to express emotions, let the viewers know what was going on. The ""Jazz Singer"" changed all that and revolutionized the movie industry. Acting became much more natural. Many popular actors and actresses were suddenly out of demand as tastes changed with the sound revolution. (Clara Bow, the inspiration for Betty Boop and great sex star of the twenties springs to mind). This movie captures that revolution.

The Artist is not quite like the old silents, viewers now are more sophisticated, so the actors don't overact quite as much, there is a sound track here, mostly classical music. The plot seems much more touching. The plot touches upon elements from ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""All About Eve"" and various Fred Astair movies. Both leads are quite effective in making the audience feel their emotions.

Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging silent heroic movie star looks a bit like Clark Gable or Errol Flynn. Brnice Bejo, as Peppy Miller, the talking newcomer, is charming and funny like Fannie Brice. French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the good qualities of black and white silent movies without asking for overacting from his stars.

With all the noisy car chases and ultra violence of today's movies The Artist is a refreshing welcome change. A movie with feelings! A movie that will leave you happy. Highest recomendation.",1327536000,3,1494,5.060975609756097

Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo and John Goodman star in a film that could easily be mistaken for a genuine masterpiece of the era when sound and color would change the movies forever.

I predict this a shoo-in for Best Film.  It is not to be missed. As a pure technical achievement, it is close to perfection in the beauty of its silvery, shimmering light and velvety shadows.  In screen format and cinematography, with real Los Angeles locations and excellent vintage sets, props, costumes all convey a lost place and time.

But at its heart, what most envelops the viewer is a feeling of love, longing and desire.  This is what the magic of movies is all about.  It's not a spoof or parody and thankfully it is devoid of irony.  Here is that rarest of the rare - pure cinema.

I saw this movie at the Arc Light theater in Hollywood, and almost all people are adults.  So like in the old times when most of the theaters customers where adults, it just gave this atmosphere that you where part of a B&W movie scene.  But the movie was great, some funny parts with some serious parts also.  I also loved how they stuck with the 4:3 aspect ratio for the movie to give it a the authentic feel to it.

4980281,5,B00695E1BY,"Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, John Gilbert, Rudolph Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks are smiling. This audacious film is a silent movie in black and white, with intertitles for dialogue! This PG-13 homage to early Hollywood absolutely proves that Talkies did NOT invent drama, pathos, comedy or romance; we experience all of these and more, yet only hear one or two words spoken in the entire film. (I just love movies about movies!)

Did you see the ""OSS 117"" pastiches inspired by the ""James Bond"" films? If so, you can easily picture the hilarious Jean Dujardin as a 1920s silent screen superstar who goes into a tailspin with the advent of the Talkies. Dujardin is a master of the sendup, the spoof, the satirical take-off on vanity, ego and self-satisfaction, so his parody of Douglas Fairbanks is spot on! As are his versions of Gene Kelly in ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and Fred Astaire in anything with Ginger Rogers. Amazon.com will notify me as soon as it becomes available.

These actors make it work:

  * Jean Dujardin won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this role. He starts out as such a ""STAR"" that you are surprised when you see a more human side.
  * Brnice Bejo is transcendent as a spunky Debbie Reynolds-type character in this little show-biz romp. Of course they meet cute and then, shades of ""A Star is Born,"" their lives reverse as her fortunes soar and his plummet.
  * A clever Jack Russell Terrier promptly keels over when a finger is suddenly pointed at him.
  * John Goodman with cigar at full chomp, runs a studio and caters to temperamental stars.
  * James Cromwell is our hero's faithful chauffeur and stalwart friend.
  * Penelope Ann Miller does a blonde bimbo reminiscent of Lina Lamont in ""Singin'...,"" only we never hear this one's voice... Whew!

Writer/Director Michel Hazanavicius has done only French films in the past, but with printed dialogue on those intertitles, this film could be in any language. (Please remember, both ""homage"" and ""clich"" are French!) Our screening audience could see that most of the words the actors mouthed were English...except that terrific dog...I'm pretty sure he was barking in French.",1326240000,13,2174,4.866847826086956

4980284,5,B00695E1BY,"French director Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist is a delight to experience, a highly enjoyable and superbly crafted homage to an era and a style: the silent movies. While one can definitely appreciate it more if one has some familiarity with the silent movie era, it is not a necessity. The Artist will give anyone who's never seen a silent movie the experience of what seeing one was like and how different silent movies were stylistically to the 'talking' films which have been the norm for the last eighty years. And why people loved them as much as they did.

The Artist is set in Hollywood - the heart of the film industry - in the critical period between 1927, when silent movies were at their peak, and 1932, by which time they had become a thing of the past, completely displaced by 'talkies'. The film begins with a swashbuckling action sequence, but then the camera moves back and reveals that we're actually watching an audience watching a film, the premiere of a Hollywood studio's latest production featuring its star actor, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin). After the premiere is over, when Valentin is posing for the press outside the theater, an accidental encounter brings him face-to-face with an admiring young fan, Peppy Miller (Brnice Bejo), who ends up being photographed with him. In a turn of classic Hollywood mythology, Miller is 'discovered' and given a shot at being an extra in a film, which turns out to be the next film Valentin is featured in. A second chance encounter results in Valentin taking Miller under his wing, insisting to studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) that she be given an actual part in the film. And thus Miller's career in film is begun.

The next part of the film draws thematically from  film classics Singing in the Rain and A Star is Born. Fast-forwarding ahead to 1929, it is the beginning of the talking era, and studios are rushing to adapt to the new technology. Valentin is dismissive of the innovation, but Zimmer informs him that the studio is switching over to talkies immediately and anyone who can't adapt will be left behind. Refusing to budge, Valentin instead decides to produce his own silent epic, pouring all of his money into the production which he not only stars in but also directs. The film, Tears of Love, bombs horribly, ruining Valentin financially and eventually costing him not only his career and his house but also his marriage as well. But as Valentin's career fades, Miller's star is on the rise and soon she is a leading actress in her own right.  But even as the plot descends into melodrama, it retains its comic touches and things are ultimately resolved in the most classically upbeat Hollywood way:  a musical dance number.

Besides drawing on many of the themes in Singing in the Rain, The Artist is in many ways the perfect counterpoint film to it. Singing in the Rain deals with the transition from silent films to talking films, presented in a talking film with talking actors. The Artist deals with the same transition, but as a silent film centered around the point of view of a silent actor. Hazanavicius makes clever use of his format choices, bringing out Valentin's fears in a delightful sequence where everything in Valentin's room suddenly starts making noises. Already startled, Valentin then descends into panic when he realizes that his own voice is still silent, and that everything - and everyone - is being heard except him.

Hazanavicius did a lot of research in preparing for this film and put a lot of thought into the shooting. Besides being down in black and white, the Artist was also filmed in the full-screen ratio (1.33:1) that was the standard during the silent film era, which enhances the actors' faces, making them bigger on the screen, an important factor when much of the characters' intentions and feelings had to be conveyed silently rather than through dialogue. He also studied the lighting and camera techniques the original silent film directors used to enhance expression and convey mood.

The cast are, in a word, marvelous. Jean Dujardin's Valentin is the embodiment of the silent film movie idol, using heightened expression and body language - not to mention perfect comic timing - to bring his character to life. This is done quite subtly as we're often watching film within film, so that when the characters - who are silent film actors - portray characters in the films they're making, they're done just slightly more exaggerated than the characters are when they're being themselves.  Brnice Bejo does the same with her Peppy Miller, playing the rising young ingenue and the comedic characters that her character in turn portrays. Hazanavicius knows his actors, having worked with both Dujardin and Bejo in previous films (not to mention being married to Bejo in real life), and knows exactly how to bring out pitch perfect performances from the both of them. The supporting cast, from John Goodman's comically put-upon studio boss to James Cromwell's devotedly loyal chauffeur, Clifton, are also excellent. And then there's Uggie, the perky and soulful little terrier who steals every scene he's in as Valentin's on-screen and off-screen dog.

As one would expect in a film like this, Hazanavicius has worked in a number of nods to the silent film age and to films and the film industry in general, some of them fairly obvious and others rather subtle.  For example, the sequence that shows Valentin and his wife becoming estranged is a comic take on the classic sequence from Citizen Kane showing Kane and his wife becoming estranged over breakfast.  Later, a scene shows Valentin in his reduced-circumstances apartment, watching a reel from one of his silent swashbucklers on a projector. The scene in the film is actually from a real silent film, The Mark of Zorro, which starred Douglas Fairbanks, one of the biggest stars of the silent film era.  In the places where the shots are close enough to recognize the actor, Hazanavicius inserted Dujardin in place of Fairbanks. And in another scene later in the film after Miller has become a major star, a rescued Valentin ends up being taken to her mansion after his apartment has a fire. The mansion used in the scene originally belonged to Mary Pickford, one of the biggest stars of the silent film era, and the bed Valentin wakes up in is Mary Pickford's actual bed.

Highly recommended, both as a truly creditable homage to the silent silver screen and as a thoroughly enjoyable film in its own right.",1325548800,41,6497,4.857271906052394
4980285,3,B00695E1BY,Wonderfully directed and acted movie - enjoyed watching it until I saw the end which is very dissapointing and a rather silly conclusion to the story. I am sure it would have been one of the best films I have seen had it not been for that.,1325548800,,239,4.1063829787234045

No spoilers here but I'll say there are some unexpected surprises. Give this a shot and you'll be rewarded by seeing something very rare and special.",1325462400,15,528,4.627659574468085
4980287,4,B00695E1BY,"You have to hand it to writer and director Michel Hazanavicius for coming up with this idea and especially that it works so well.  The technical aspects are well done.  Everyone knows the film has no sound, well almost.  There is a dream sequence where George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) hears sounds but he has no voice.  And of course the film is accompanied by an orchestrated soundtrack.  It even has the 4:3 (or 1.33:1 if you prefer) aspect ratio, the same as the original televisions.  Then there are the title cards which tell us what the actors are saying.  Like the original silent films, these aren't used often as the actor's job is to let us know what's going on with their performance.  Unlike many of the original silent films, you can actually see what the actor's are saying because the picture is clear enough to read their lips.  So the title cards pretty much enforce what we've already heard...ahem, seen.

The story really isn't new.  It is a mash up of ""Singing in the Rain,"" the 1952 Gene Kelly masterpiece and the numerous iterations of ""A Star is Born.""  Valentin is the most successful actor of his time.  Handsome, rugged, witty and very charming.  He meets Peppy Miller, a perfectly named wannabe actress/dancer played by long-stemmed Argentine beauty Berenice Bejo.  As the silent film era transitions to ""talkies"", Valentin doesn't.  At the same time, the adorable Peppy rises to the top.  Valentin loses his fortune after his self financed final film tanks and the stock market crashes.  It's 1929 and George is penniless, yet still proud and defiant.  After a struggle with the bottle he attempts suicide but is eventually saved by his very cute dog and then by Peppy.

While their relationship remains chaste throughout, there is a smoldering fire within each of them.  Initially, George's marriage gets in the way, but his wife (Penelope Ann Miller) leaves him before all his money is lost.  I watch lot of old black and white movies and even silent ones, so I was not in shock seeing this film.  What may be surprising is that once you get past that, there is a wonderful romantic drama delivered by two talented actors.",1325376000,8,2152,4.741239892183288
4980288,4,B00695E1BY,"""The Artist"" (98 min.) made quite a splash at the 2011 Cannes film festival earlier this year, and is finally being released in the US. I had heard and read a number of things about it, including that it turly is a silent movie and shot strictly in black-and-white, but still wasn't sure what to expect of it. WIth time on my hands while on vacation, I saw this earlier this week, and what a treat it was.

Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius has come up with a unique premise, namely retelling the fall of a big star of the silent movie era (played beautifully by Jean Dujardin, recalling Clark Gable in his heydays), while at the same time a young actress (equally great performance by Berenice Bejo) becomes ""a star is born"" in the new talkies. No, the story is not unique, not by a long shot, but to bring it in the way the movie does, in this daty and age, is truly unique. The musical score (I can't remember who scored it) is outstanding from start to finish.

I enjoyed this movie tremendously, but this is a one-time opportunity as it simply cannot be recreated. The movie is brilliantly executed at all levels. I'm not sure whether this can find a massive audience, although it is also clear that the Weinstein Company (the US distributor of this movie) is going to push this movie heavily in the coming Oscar season. Regardless, this is highly recommended!",1325203200,4,1367,4.5528455284552845
4980289,4,B00695E1BY,"THE ARTIST is a silent movie with an up-front music score. The composer has a huge credit line in the opening credits, and the music serves as an almost nonstop accompaniment to the movie. Watching this picture is rather like watching an extended music video. The great visual appeal of the movie is in its two French stars, who beautifully evoke the glamor of early Hollywood, and who even learned how to tap dance for a few dancing scenes. I'd have been happier with more dancing in the movie, but what there is of it is divine. And then there's a dog whose barking remains silent, but whose character shines.

For movie music fans, THE ARTIST may seem to derail itself when the original score gives way to Bernard Herrmann's music underscoring the climactic love scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 masterpiece, VERTIGO. That music has some thematic relevance to the climax of THE ARTIST, but sounds so different from the movie's original score--and so anachronistic in a movie set in the late 1920s-early 1930s--that I couldn't enjoy the resolution of the story as much as I wanted to. At least I'd been forewarned about this oddity in THE ARTIST, so I wasn't surprised by it and was interested to see how it worked in this picture. But it didn't work very well for me.

That said, I'll probably see this movie more than once again because it's such a musical and visual treat. I recommend watching it with Alfred Hitchcock's 1929 silent-talkie hybrid, BLACKMAIL. The Hitchcock picture is mostly a talkie, and THE ARTIST is mostly silent, but it, too, is a hybrid.",1325116800,2,1565,4.728937728937729
4980290,5,B00695E1BY,"I almost didn't see this movie, and THAT would have been a blunder !! The reviews are correct. It is marvelous.  Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are perfection. The idea of shooting the film in black and white without spoken dialog ( except for the surprises) is a master stroke.  The soundtrack is splendid. I can see at least 5 Oscar nominations coming out of this and would not be surprised to see either Dujardin and/or Bejo win. If you have not seen this yet, do so before it leaves the theatres. The moment this movie goes to DVD, I'm buying it.

NOTE:  Since I wrote this review, the movie has gone on to win numerour awards ( including a near clean-sweep of BAFTA) and 10 Oscar nominations. Not the five I predicted earlier.  Since this my first review, Dujardin has become more known to U.S. audiences and has absolutely captured them through his charm, politeness, and humor.  While I generally agree that Clooney should win Best Actor at the Oscars,  The Artist should win Best Picture, soundtrack, and several other technical type awards.  And all this for a movie that cost only $15 million to make !! Less than the price of a Viagra commercial for the Super Bowl.",1324944000,16,1177,4.571428571428571
4980291,4,B00695E1BY,"THE ARTIST is a delightful, engaging an inventive film.  Its own artifice and cleverness cause the ending of the film to be a slight emotional letdown...but that being said, the journey is so pleasurable.

If you haven't heard, THE ARTIST is a silent (at least, 99% silent) film, shot in gorgeous black and white.  It's film about the time in film history when silent film was giving way to ""talkies.""  Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius has crafted a loving tribute to that era, chiefly by fully embracing the over-acting (required for silent film), the camera angles and the pacing of those films.  Even his ""special effects"" hearken to that era.  It is, simply, a marvelous exercise in what I can old call ""old-fashionness.""

Best of all are the two sparkling lead performances, both garnering deserved awards consideration.  Ridiculously handsome Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin.  He's a big silent movie star, churning out light-hearted action-adventure films (yes, he seems like a combination of Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino).  His signature hero is adept at narrow escapes, hand-to-hand combat and charming the ladies.  His smile is mischievous and adorable.  You can instantly see why he's a star.  In real life, he's equally charming...in what seems to be a genuine way.  He's a likeable guy.  He's enamored; first and foremost, with himself...there are several funny shots of him adoring his own image in the mirror.

One day, while being interviewed after a premiere, he literally bumps into Peppy Miller (a radiant Berenice Bejo), a fan of the star and also a wannabe actress.  The two share a bit of light banter, and the press captures it all.  This helps her secure a walk-on in George's next film.  It is during their incredibly brief scene together, which we see being filmed through several takes, that the two fall in love.  These few moments of filmmaking are among the most purely romantic, mostly startlingly detailed and yet endlessly light-hearted bits of cinema I've seen in years.  Each time they must reshoot the brief dance sequence we see their fondness for each other grow.  It sounds utterly implausible...but it's dazzling to behold.  And you know it's a good scene, because later in the film, when we see part of it again for about 5 seconds, it's hard to fight back a tear.

Shortly after the two dance together, the studio decides to stop making silent movies.  George refuses to believe talking films are the future, whereas Peppy quickly emerges as a rising star.  I won't go into details, but not surprisingly, the paths of the two almost-lovers head in opposite directions.  George's marriage falls apart (and it is in his lousy relationship with wife that we see George isn't just a nice guy, but is capable of selfishness and even cruelty).  And he begins to fall apart too.

I don't want to say more...because while the plot of the film is actually relatively predictable, it is also told so sweetly as to seem new and fresh.  Dujardin and Bejo have chemistry to spare, and give heartfelt performances.  Bejo has a fragility that we scarcely see in film anymore, and Dujardin is a revelation.  The two stars are ably assisted by a variety of familiar American faces, such as John Goodman and James Cromwell...but this is their film and they utterly own it.

I feel that the final scenes of the film are pretty predictable (in fact, afterwards, my family and I agreed that we sort of saw it all coming about midway through the film), and thus the emotional build that we've been going through does not get a strong pay-off.  I smiled at the end, but with perhaps a little more care and creativity, I could also have been wrenched pretty well emotionally.  The final scene is CLEVER...but it is calculated.  All of THE ARTIST is clever and calculated...but it's imbued with an enthusiasm and love of film that makes it work so very well.

There are a few moments when we perhaps linger on a close-up of George a bit too long, or when the scenes of his films are shown just a bit too much...but otherwise the film moves along at a brisk pace.  And the musical soundtrack is virtually perfect.  The film MUST win an Oscar for best score...the film literally would not work without the brilliant music of Ludovic Bource.

THE ARTIST is a film of nearly unbridled passion for movies and movie-making, with a deeply romantic heart.  If a black and white, silent film doesn't sound like your cup of tea...you are wrong.  In about 5 minutes, you'll forget both.  Treat yourself to one of the year's true movie pleasures.",1324944000,6,4569,4.818766066838046
4980292,5,B00695E1BY,"It is 1927 and a silent film star, George Valentin has a photo shoot interrupted by a young fan, Peppy Miller. What appears to be an awkward moment turns out to be a funny one. The fan becomes a film star in her own right over the next couple of years. As silent films become popular, George Valentin's career fades, and Peppy Miller is now the toast of Hollywood. This is an actual silent film, which certainly makes it unique in today's culture, and the results are delightful. The film becomes better as it moves along, resulting in a crescendo of emotion as the former star finds his career and marriage diminish, and his former fan, now a movie star, tries to help him. The film is highlighted by a brilliant lead performance from Jean Dujardin, a fantastic musical score, and George's very funny canine companion. This is much heralded film that does not disappoint.",1324684800,5,872,4.632258064516129

4980294,4,B00695E1BY,"To state that French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the artistry and emotional appeal of classic silent cinema would be a severe understatement. He devours it like only a true cineaste would and brings a unique deftness to such a long-forgotten medium that he singlehandedly brings it back to life if only for this one instance. Mostly silent with title cards and shot entirely black-and-white, this stylish 2011 dramedy starts in 1927 Hollywood as pre-Depression audiences were still enraptured by the heart-palpitating derring-do of matinee idols like Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and John Gilbert on the silver screen. As Norma Desmond said in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunset-Boulevard/dp/B00003CXCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunset Boulevard</a>, ""We didn't need dialogue. We had faces then."" And indeed Hazanavicius has found the appropriate doppelganger in his constant star Jean Dujardin portraying an amalgam of Fairbanks, Gilbert and Rudolph Valentino with a touch of Charlie Chaplin (notable in his comic scenes with the dog) and a little Gene Kelly-style hoofing thrown in for good measure.

Dujardin plays George Valentin, one of the silent screen's leading lights whose charming braggadocio is more than offset by his popularity. At the premiere of his latest romantic espionage caper, he has a ""meet-cute"" run-in with the fittingly named Peppy Miller, a pretty extra fumbling for her autograph book on the red carpet. He is immediately impressed with her beauty as well as her moxie, and in another ""meet-cute"" run-in, by her terpsichorean talent as well. Once their mutual attraction is established, the plot follows a standard&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Star-Is-Born/dp/B003B3V0X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Star Is Born</a>&nbsp;storyline by showing his career in decline while hers is on a fast rise with the advent of talkies. There is a buoyant spirit that infuses the story and sideswipes the more tragic elements one would expect from previous versions of this tale. That's how Hazanavicius manages to engage the viewer even though the film slows considerably during the middle section despite his meticulous efforts. There are also recognizable tributes to silent classics like F.W. Murnau's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunrise/dp/B0002DCHQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunrise</a>&nbsp;and King Vidor's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crowd/dp/7885726967/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crowd</a>&nbsp;and even a wink to the classic breakfast montage in Orson Welles'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Kane/dp/B0050G3NWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Kane</a>&nbsp;to illustrate how Valentin and his icy wife drift apart.

Some of Valentin's most vulnerable moments are beautifully rendered like the puddle of liquor on the glass table, his window reflection against the tuxedoed torso of a mannequin, and a sure-to-be-classic nightmare scene where he hears every sound except his own voice. The movie jumps back to life with a surprisingly exhilarating ending that subtly explains the key dramatic point of the story. Dujardin immerses himself completely into the essence of his embattled, vainglorious character without a trace of irony. It's a genuinely exquisite performance that could have easily disintegrated into self-parody in less assured hands. What's more, the man can really dance. Brnice Bejo (who also happens to be the director's wife) is lovely and vivacious as Peppy, although there are moments when she comes across as a mite too contemporary to be truly convincing as a period character. Take, for example, the fist pump she shows when she wins her first audition. At the same time, when she puts an arm through the sleeve of a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to be his, she handles this piece of pantomime with true aplomb.

The two French stars are surrounded by familiar American faces like John Goodman as a Jack Warner-like, cigar-chomping producer; James Cromwell as Valentin's dutiful chauffeur; Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's shingle-haired, ignored wife Doris; and Missi Pyle as a Lina Lamont-style starlet, appropriate since this film covers the same fertile ground as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singin-in-the-Rain/dp/B00006DEF9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singin' in the Rain</a>. By the way, that's Uggie who plays the playful, clever Jack Russell terrier, an obvious paean to Asta from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thin-Man/dp/B0009GX1C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thin Man</a>&nbsp;series. Kudos also need to be given to Guillaume Schiffman's accurately evocative cinematography (unlike other pastiches, the film looks like it was made in 1927), Laurence Bennett's production design (including an inventive use of the vintage Bradbury Building in downtown LA), and Ludovic Bource's swooning music score, which includes a snatch of Bernard Hermann's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/B000ICXQG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>&nbsp;score over a climactic scene. Even with all the praise heaped on this film from the critics, it's not for everyone's tastes. Silent cinema, by its very nature, beckons a certain patience from the audience that some will find tedious, and even at a running time of just 100 minutes, the movie still feels a bit long. At the same time, for those who can appreciate it as an art form, Hazanavicius has really delivered quite a treat.",1323043200,26,5769,6.499349804941483
