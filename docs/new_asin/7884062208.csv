8589782,5,7884062208,"exactly as advertised! Very nice copy! The only complaint is that there are some prelude video advertisements that you are forced to watch every time you put the DVD in, unlike many American DVDs which allow you to chapter through those ads. Since this is a movie I watch frequently, I find the forcex commercial videos of the beginning quite annoying.  I received it relatively quickly, and the mailing and the shipping and packing? excellent!.",1426032000,6,445,4.933333333333334
