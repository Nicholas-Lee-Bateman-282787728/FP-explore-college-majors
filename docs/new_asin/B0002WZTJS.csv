2129314,4,B0002WZTJS,"Mike Hodges respects his audience: rarely does he forget that viewers have the intelligence to piece together the puzzles he creates. Though his films have memorable characters, those characters are enhanced more by what is not said about them than superfluous dialogue and proscenium staging.  And while this approach to film making does require participation, the end result is well worth the journey.

Early on in the film we encounter Will Graham (Clive Owen), a disheveled loner who lives out in the country in the back of a van.  There is something sinister about this man but there is also something intangibly innocent.  We gradually learn that he has been away from a life in the underbelly of London, making little to no contact with his lover (Charlotte Rampling) or his younger brother Davey (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).

Flash into the midst of Davey's comings and goings as a minor drug dealer and gigolo and we see the grimy world Will has left behind.  Out late one night on a drug deal and female servicing gig, Davey tries to find his way back to his lowlife flat (his landlady is the amazing Sylvia Sims!), but in the process he is chased and captured and raped by a wealthy car dealer (Malcolm McDowell).  Decimated, he finds his way home, sits in his bathtub fully clothed, and commits suicide.

When Will is informed of Davey's suicide, he returns to London and with the help of his old gang and lover, he sets on a track of trying to understand why Davey committed suicide, only to pursue the perpetrator to a grisly end.

There are no secrets to the plot - it is all in the first few minutes.  The pleasure of this darkly written, photographed, edited and scored film is in the acting and the collaboration Hodges requires of the viewer.  Less is more, here, and for those who enjoy film noir, this is a very strong movie.  Grady Harp, November 2004",1100736000,,1868,4.661585365853658
2129315,3,B0002WZTJS,"""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead "" is a moody, atmospheric revenge film that takes place among the trainspotters and swank bosses of the criminal underworld. Will Graham (Clive Owen) is a reclusive ex-con who feels impelled to resume his old ways to avenge his brother David's (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) violent death. ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" has more style than substance. Clive Owen is always charismatic, but here he is less so than usual. The audience simply doesn't know enough about Will to wrap it's mind around. Charlotte Rampling and Malcolm McDowell round out a talented cast, but their roles are too small to provide anything but glimpses of their characters. The film takes an awfully long time to arrive at the main story, and once it does, produces very little of substance in its characters or themes. It seems cursory, as if a better film might be found below the surface of this one. -Perhaps if the dialogue were improved and more time were spent on character development instead of the lead-in. ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" isn't altogether bad. It has some intriguing moments. But even for Clive Owen fans, this film's a bit flat. There are no bonus features on the DVD. Subtitles are available in English.",1100649600,19,1216,4.822966507177034
2129316,4,B0002WZTJS,"this movie is going to split film fans and critics everywhere.  for those wanting an updated ""get carter"", and for those wanting more of the ""croupier"" magic, both will be disappointed to an extent, and exposed to a different type of psychological, gangster film.  fans of film (like myself) are essentially voyeurs, we like to watch things good and bad.  this film by legendary british director mike hodges (flash gordon, get carter, a prayer for the dying, croupier) treats us as such. as the filmwatcher, you are rendered a witness to the film and its characters.  you are there to watch and draw you own conclusions as to why the events of the film happened the way they do, because only the characters actions, and expressions tell the story.  the story is simple, and my version is open to debate.  clive owen plays will graham, a once formidable london mob boss, enforcer type.  one day three years ago, graham severs all ties to his london life, and retreats to the north of the uk to live reclusively in a van.  graham leaves behind his little brother davey(jonathan rhys-meyers), his family sidekick mickser(jamie foreman), his girlfriend helen(the always alluring and classy charlotte rampling), and his former partners in crime.  while graham lives in seclusion, life in london goes on.  davey becomes a bit of a hustler, making his living off small narcotics transactions, hustler charm, and good looks.  mickser maintains his postion as a bottom feeder with limited ties to the underworld, and with a heart of gold.  mickser becomes daveys big brother for the vacant will. helen retreats to her buisness as proprietor of an upscale restaurant.  all go on with life, but are constantly pondering why will left.

enter boad(played with apathetic menace by malcolm mcdowell).  boad and his henchmen prowl the london night searching for victims.  one night they strategically hunt, and capture davey.  daveys shock to his assault, leads him to a tragic result.

will returns to london with one thing on his mind, what happened?  will has to face his old friends, his crew, and his guilt over not being there to protect his brother.  his friends colleauges, will all interpret his return differently.  some act as if no time was lost, some want answers from will, and others see his return as a threat.  add all of these elements together, and you have one of the most subtle, understated thrillers in film history.  outstanding cinematography, and stylish appearance highlight an overall outstanding film experience.",1100390400,2,2526,4.976133651551312

2129329,3,B0002WZTJS,"This is definitely a European movie with much more of a psychological thrill to it than an action thrill.  This movie is about Will and his re-emergence into life as most of us know it, but the first 30 minutes or so are all about someone else.  Ultimately those minutes lead up to why Will re-emerges into life, but for an American audience, it's a really slow lead-up to some of the main action.
You'll probably need the subtitles on to understand the characters because they're northern UK/Welsh maybe, rather than the easier to understand London accent.  Also, there is a highly disturbing scene that sort of comes out of nowhere.  It can be really hard to get past that as a viewer.

2129371,1,B0002WZTJS,"A dark, pretentious, modern-day film noir from Britain, that has absolutely none of the revered attributes of an authentic film noir.

""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" meanders aimlessly, like a desultory somnambulist, through an indifferent plot, featuring depthless characters, who inspire little, if any, interest or sentiment on the part of the viewer.

Clive Owen's immutable, deadpan expression -- suggesting the proverbial silent loner with a dark hidden past -- helped (but not all that much) to keep the ship just barely afloat.

The cringing ""high point"" of the film appears near the end, when Boad (Malcolm McDowell) is forced to reveal, at gunpoint, his utterly ludicrous motivation -- ya gotta hear this to believe it! -- for having viciously raped ""innocent"" drug dealer and ladies' man, Davey (played with a certain degree of aplomb by Jonathan Rhys Meyers). This is precisely the point where you finally want to kick yourself firmly in the backside for not having trashed this film right from the beginning, having known instinctively it was going to turn out to be a first-class stinker.",1453420800,5,1098,5.122905027932961

2129450,2,B0002WZTJS,"The only good part about this film was the lack of dialogue. The writers didn't want to waste their time with it (or with character development, plot line, or any of those other pesky things that get in the way of a movie), so most of the film was composed of edgy angles and moody music. There was Clive Owen. I will say that much for it.

As for the rest, the story was a typical vengeance tale. The good-looking petty drug dealing brother (Davy) of a former London bad guy turned granola-muncher (Will, played by Clive Owen) kills himself under suspicious circumstances. Will now must face his personal demons ... does he leave the matter to the cops and rejoin his lady love in law-abiding domestic bliss, or does he revert to his former bad-ass self and off the m*%^&*$*^$er who was responsible for his brother's death? Actually, now that I've spelled it out, that wouldn't have been a bad plot. Nor would adding a sub-plot involving yet another bad-ass who is determined to kill Will now that the former bad-ass is back in town.

That was the story that the writers were supposed to tell, but destroyed with dreadful dialogue (what little there was), miniscule character development, gigantic logic holes (the explanation for Davy's rape was ludicrous given the enormous lengths the perp went to in order to carry it out), and a pace so slow you could easily take a nap between the beginning and the end and not miss anything. In fact, you could skip this movie altogether and take a nap right now. It's a better use of your time.",1348876800,,1536,4.581818181818182
2129451,5,B0002WZTJS,"Mike Hodges' debut film, ""Get Carter"", redefined the gangster genre by showing it in it's most primal and brutal state.  I think a mistake people make about this film is that it is a conventional gangster film as opposed to one being set in the murky gangster milieu.  There are gangsters on display here both inactive (Clive Owen) and active (Malcolm McDowell).  What Hodges is really commenting on is power.  Not the kind of power that comes with social status or money but the kind that is reinforced through violence some of it sexual.  Hodges posits a lot of uneay truths here that may make some uneasy which to my mind may account for the negative reaction of some to this film.  Clive Owen's performance as a reformed hood investigating the mysterious suicide of his brother(Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a paragon of understatement.  This cool in the face of grief is one of unmistakable power.  With this film, the aforementioned ""Get Carter"", and ""Croupier"" Hodges hits the trifecta in commentary on society's underbelly.",1339545600,2,1026,4.924418604651163

I got it for $2 in a used disk place, thinking that the cast was as solid as you could get, from McDowell and Rampling to Owens.  Alas, it is a mood film with no caper to it about horrible, uninteresting losers who are headed towards the worst kind of self destruction.  Aside from Owens, the acting is rather flat, to say the least, completely without sparkle or creativity.  The plot is rather humdrum:  a ""reformed"" hoodlum comes back to investigate a strange death and is horrified by what he discovers and had to decide what to do.

Everybody in a bad mood almost all the time (blame the weather?). All the ingredients from a typical Brit gangster film but none of the fun, zing, and intrigue. Just a technically well-shot but increasingly dull story about revenge and a few rather unpleasant scenes of various sorts.

All of which leads exactly nowhere.

And why does Malcolm McDowell look now look Sting after a 20-year binge on booze and pills? It's painful to see. Alex, me droogy, wot 'appened? At least he looked better here than in the latest season of Entourage, where he's like Medusa: don't look lest ye die of fright!

Clive and Rampling are ok, but I can only guess the director insisted on zero emotion from almost everyone here...perhaps to signify glowering rage and/or existential despair, instead suggesting only how nice a nap would feel right about now.

How in the world do you make a Clive Owen, Malcom McDowell, Charlotte Rampling flick SO flat and pointless that it induces drowsiness? The acting is so deadpan and emotionless that it HAS to be good, right? Wow, and count those crime noir cliches in the script--is that a deep, meaningful commentary on the whole genre I smell? And what about all of those plot points (about half of the screen time in the film) that not only DON'T add to the main story but actually distract and detract the viewer's attention to confuse him or her as to what is actually going on--surely this is the sign of a truly meaningful movie experience, right? And let's not forget the lack of resolution for every single one of these meaningless sub-plots, including the old flame with a gun to her head.

2129462,3,B0002WZTJS,"I like this movie for a lot of reasons. It is visually very stylish and interesting. There are some very good performances, and the contrast between Clive Owen's character, Will Graham, and everyone else from the old neighborhood is fascinating. Will Graham is a character who has left his old life, not to start a new one, but to cut himself off completely from any life. He returns to find out why his younger brother killed himself. The ending, before he seeks his revenge, has a strange ritualistic quality that heightens the tension. In the final analysis, however, I didn't think that the story of Will's search for the reason for his brother's death was nearly as interesting as the story that takes place before the film begins - what happened to Will that led him to abandon everything and begin aimless travels in a beatup camper, spending most of his time by himself. His ex-lover, played by Charlotte Rampling, says he ""had a breakdown,"" but that doesn't provide any insight into what caused this stark, dramatic, and ultimately solitary disappearance from life. Without any understanding of this change, ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" is interesting , but emotionally unsatisfying.",1172275200,3,1190,4.955
2129463,2,B0002WZTJS,"Clive Owen has come into his own as an actor. His roles in GOSFORD PARK, INSIDE MAN, and CHILDREN OF MEN have proven him to be an excellent casting choice. And here in I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD, director Mike Hodges made the very wise decision to feature Mr. Owen in the prime role as Will Graham, a ""retired"" gangster returned to the madness after the apparent suicide of his only brother.

Building on the fairly weak relationship of Will Graham with his brother Davey (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, MATCH POINT), the story begins just as it ends, with the arrival and ultimate departure of Will. Interesting in a sort of nonlinear scripting way, the story's ambling nature and unaffecting characters are impossible to empathize with. When Davey (Meyers) is brutally sodomized by a ruthless man, we care very little because we simply don't know anything about them. Nor do we know (or are ever told) why Davey was raped in the first place. There is a simple speech given by the rapist (played by Malcolm McDowell) in an attempt at an explanation, but this is neither believable nor seemingly coherent with the script itself.

Which leads us to bigger and better problems. Since this is the crux of the story -- and what brings Will (Owen) out of retirement -- this leaves the entire film feeling very hollow. The connections between thugs, coroners/cops, and family are thinly developed (if at all) and given so little screen-time as to leave most watchers scratching their heads.

The ending, as stated earlier, mirrors the film's beginnings in that Will appears standing on the same beach monologuing the same lines. The assumption that the viewer is supposed to make is that this has happened before (i.e., Will has come out of ""retirement"" in the past for important things), but it comes off feeling stilted and out of place.

Clive Owen does an admirable acting job, but the script given him here is too weak to make this a positive movie-going experience.",1170806400,,1954,4.789317507418398
2129464,2,B0002WZTJS,"Any films with Clive Owen should not be missed especially when the film is directed by Mike Hodges of `The Croupier' fame. That's why I watched `I'll Sleep When I'm Dead.' I know many critics praised it for its atmospheric photography and its ambiguous content that might or might not teach you something about existential meaning of our life even though you don't want to know existential meaning of life. All I can say safely here is that I almost slept during the long film that goes on and on as if played at half speed.

`I'll Sleep When I'm Dead' is Mike Hodges's modern-day urban noir film featuring quiet guy Will (Owen) working in a forest, living in an old van. While Will has left the town (whose name is unspecified), his brother Davey (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is found dead in a bathtub.

According to the well-known formula of crime novels and films, Will must search the truths behind his brother's strange death, and avenge it. Will, who has left the life of crime three years ago, is expected to be back in the business of killing before or after questioning the life he had been leading. The fact is, we are not sure of it here.

Mike Hodges' film not only refuses to follow the course - that is not a problem for me - but also meanders too much with scene after scene, many of which only show and tell the very superfluous things like Charlotte Rampling suggesting that Will should leave the matter to the police, or leave the town immediately. Though the film takes time to get us to know the characters of Will, it never convinces us of the cause of the death, and the truths about it. Charlotte Rampling and Malcolm McDowell are both terribly wasted, particularly McDowell whose character's motive for doing what he did is simply laughable. Even Clive Owen, undeniably gifted actor, looks confines in formula-one acting up until ten minutes before the ending.

There are many good things that would have made a better British noir in `I'll Sleep When I'm Dead' but the film never finds a way to use them effectively, relying too much on the moody cinematography and character study. The film got both of them, and I admit both are pretty good, but not good enough to make us forget its dull pace and pretentiousness.",1152316800,2,2236,4.5825
2129465,3,B0002WZTJS,"How much cooler can yo get than Clive Owen as Will, the lonely ganster who leaves retirement to avenge his brother death. Charlotte Rampling, his estranged girlfriend, is  the perfect vixen of a serie noir: beautiful, misterious, with far away eyes that hide and ambiguous soul. Even the tempo is right: slow, dark, heavy. And the villain, Malcom Mc Dowell, a twisted  family man, how can he go wrong.  So I was having the time of my life wondering why  movies don't get so dark anymore when suddenly, the film sank, lost his tempo,  and Will coolness vanished  even thought he became handsomer with his new suit and haircut. It was like if at the end the producers, the director and the screen writer decided that the movie had to be hurried away making one of the lamest motives for a crime, sacrificing the first three quartes of what could had been a great movie",1146873600,3,866,4.554838709677419
2129486,4,B0002WZTJS,"I will say right off that if you are looking for a mob/action/revenge/shoot 'em up thriller, this surely isn't the picture you're looking for.  Despite it's slick trailer, which makes it seem like it may be a violent revenge flick, it really has no action, gunfights, or fisticuffs.  What made this film work for me was the tense pace of the film.  It really drove me to it's final few minutes in just as quick a time as if there were action scenes galore.

For the first 90 minutes, we get a very different Clive Owen than the one on the DVD cover.  We get the unkempt, unshaven, drifter he has been for 3 years, until he tries to contact his younger brother, and finds he has committed suicide due to a heinous crime inflicted against him.  You only get the clean cut Clive for the final 10 minutes, but it's an effective transformation, and I didn't mind it coming so late.

Each player involved in this setting is shown contemplating the events about to unfold.  Will (Clive Owen) strolls back into London, meets back up with his old girl (Charlotte Rampling), ensues fear in the rival crime boss, and gets a visit from his old gang mates.  While a lot of the aspects never fully conclude, it's quite alright as the film succeeds in merely showing their developments, which are just as intriguing as if all loose ends were tied.

The ambiguous ending fit the film quite well. Interestingly, the reaction of my fellow reviewers matched  mine towards another Clive Owen movie Closer(I think that was him) which is on my all-time worst movie list--a growing one.  The atmospherics of I'll Sleep When I'm Dead match The Limey: the timeless story of revenge--a meal best had on a full stomach(or was that an empty stomach).",1140134400,9,665,4.666666666666667
2129488,4,B0002WZTJS,"The starting point for ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" happened years before this 2004 film begins when Will Graham (Clive Owen) decided to disappear.  We gather that in former times he was pretty high up in a crime organization and that the time came when he was sickened by either what he was doing or who he had become, so he walked away and disappeared.  He works as a laborer, but since he does not have papers gigs never last long.  From time to time he checks in with the brother the left behind, Davey (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).  Being let go by his current employer, Will become concerned when he cannot reach Davey by phone, so he risks a trip home.  After all, he has a scraggly beard and does not look like the dapper gangster he used to be.  So he comes home and finds out that Davey killed himself.

At first Will does not believe his brother would have committed suicide, and he gets the results of a second autopsy.  The forensic evidence suggests a surprising reason for why Davey would have slit his own throat.  We are surprised as well, even though we saw most of what happened to Davey.  It takes Will a while to digest this startling information, but once he does his quiet life as a forgotten man takes a back seat to finding out who is responsible for Davey's death and killing them.  His ex-girlfriend, Helen (Charlotte Rampling), begs him to just leave and disappear again and it seems to me that he is sort of willing to make a concession to her demands: he is only going to kill one man and one dog.  Not surprisingly, Helen is not pleased by the specificity of his kill list.

That might not be possible, because once it is known in underworld circles that Will is back in town, that seems to start some ripples that could cause problems.  But Will is so methodical and so focused that there is an air of inevitability to his mission.  It is just that Will is so glacial in his anger and his actions that you can almost feel your pulse slow to match his heartbeat, and some of you are not going to like that.  No wonder this is a neo-noir in which the pivotal scenes are a pair of conversations rather than a gunfight or anything more exciting.  The first is when Will talks to the pathologist (John Surman) who explains what the evidence suggests happen to Davey before he killed himself.  Coroners and the like are almost always presented as being, to say the least, decidedly weird, but this guy is so straight forward and considerate in his detailing of the unsettling information that he constitutes a breath of fresh air.  Things were still moving too slowly at that point, but from that moment on I was interested in what was going to happen next.

The second conversation is when Will finally comes face to face with the man he is going to kill.  Again, screenwriter Trevor Preston (""Billy the Kid and the Green Baize Vampire"") and director Mike Hodges (""Black Rainbow"") come up with something a bit different, namely some honesty.  You have seen enough confrontations between the hero and the bad guy, and I am often reminded at such times of the ""Saturday Night Live"" skit where the James Bond villains do a seminar and they all agree at such moments just shut up and kill the guy (without using lasers or anything else that is to fancy).  So a direct conversation that cuts to the heart of the matter at hand is refreshing as well.  Finally, just because you make a specific threat does not mean that it is a binding contract.  After all, taking your time does not mean you have to take all of the time that you have allotted for a mission of vengeance.",1137024000,3,3585,4.444954128440367

Indeed, it is one of those movies best left running when you go to the kitchen, bathroom, mall, etc. Unless you are out of Sominex and desperately need a two-hour nap, leave this snooze-fest on the shelf.

Here is the entire plot: a cocky drug-dealing punk gets sodomized and, understandably distressed but overreacting a bit, commits suicide. His older brother avenges this by murdering the sodomizer (and, unfortunately, his dog...which was the only scene that affected me in any way). The whole plot in two brief sentences, but this god-awful exercise in cinematic slow-motion (no-motion ?) drags on for what seems like hours.

It could well have been told in 5 minutes, but that would have required an editor who was more conscious and energetic than I (and most of the cast).

Clive Owen (uninspiring at his best) is definitely at his worst here...with a level of energy and animation barely rising above that of the background scenery. From this point on, he will always be a dog-murdering sonambulist in my book.

The dialog reminds me of the droning of cicadas in the summertime, except that cicadas generally have more spirited and meaningful exchanges.

As this glacial bore-a-rama neared completion, I found myself rooting for the sodomizer, Malcom McDowell, who does confer some energy, albeit of the ""ham"" variety, to his character....God knows, he was the only actor who earned his pay, and there are waaaay too many cocky drug dealing punks in the world.",1120262400,8,1604,4.925925925925926

Sadly, this manages to be even worse than MORONS, a numbingly tedious movie where the semi-comatose leads are at least three hours behind the audience in guessing the plot. The shock revelation was obvious from the start and Hodges never makes you interested in getting there. He's not helped by his cast. They're either overacting like McDowell or Meyers or totally incapable of showing signs of life, like Rampling and Owen. Even before it was invented Rampling has always looked like she's had too much botox, but inexperienced filmgoers might think she'd OD'd here she's so stiff. Her expression doesn't change from its deathmask once. Owen is more hopeless than usual, shuffling through like a zombie from a cheap George Romero ripoff. He still can't act and his vocal performance is still like a bored photocopier salesman demonstrating some clapped out machine with one eye on the clock for the pub's opening.

Contrary to other posters, it's not thoughtful or atmospheric. The plot is obvious, the characters infantile. There's no depth, no ideas, just a dragging running time to fill out. And it is achingly slow in the doing it. From a first-timer this picture would have been laughed out of the office at script stage it's so empty and predictable.

British audiences shunned the film (as they did CROUPIER) but Americans might just mistake his accent for a performance. But for the rest of us, it's another pitiful performance in the dullest British gangster film of the past twenty years. That's quite an achievement, but it's the film's only one.

The pretentious script takes forever coming to a conclusion.

The real mystery here is why such dependable actors, Clive Owen and the utterly wasted Charlotte Rampling among them, signed on to such a cold-blooded exercise.

It starts out well enough, drawing you in as you're trying to figure out why a series of events leads to a suicide. But then it quickly goes awry. Director Hodges apparently doesn't know quite how to edit or he simply cannot tell a clear story. He keeps us guessing about a number of details, which at first heightens the mystery and suspense.  But when the film has concluded and we still don't know some crucial facts, it leaves us wondering what really happened. What, after all, was he attempting to do?  For example, we're not really told enough about Owen's character to understand his relationship with the other main characters. Just as baffling, there are scenes along the way that seem to have no purpose- such as the one in which Owen is lumber-jacking.

2129521,3,B0002WZTJS,"Clive Owen ( was a popular favorite to become ""James Bond"" in 2005 , but he bowed out) plays ""Will"", a good samaritan who saw someone get beat up by three thugs.  When the thugs left, Will takes the injured man back home to his wife to heal.  Meanwhile, his younger brother, Davey (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is taking a taxi cab ride with an unlicenced driver (Tim Plester), but the cab is groovy inside.  When the cab stalls, Davey must foot it the rest of the way.  Boad (Malcolm McDowall) and his thugs come upon him and Boad sadomizes Davey.  Davey withers home the next morning in pain.  Fully clothed and bleeding, he sits in his bathtub.  When a friend comes to visit Davey, he finds him dead in the bathtub with a slash on his neck.  So he must find Will.  Will was a gangleader in the past, but has retreated himself into a private world of his own.  He hasn't been seen in three years.  Will decides to get in contact with his brother, but when he discovers he had committed suicide, he comes out of exile to find out the truth about Davey and what happened to him.

2129522,2,B0002WZTJS,"You could be forgiven after watching this movie, to think it is a pilot movie for an English style ""Soprano's"", and be keenly awaiting the next installment after the end credits roll.  The thrust of the story revolves around the seedier side of the London underworld, and is atmospheric, and at times a gritty urban drama. Clive Owen plays a former gangland boss who has (for some reason that is only ever hinted at) disappeared into obscurity, small time menial jobs, and living in a converted panel van, in the rural countryside. His friend (left behind, along with girlfriend, and former associates) seek him out, after his younger playboy brother is found dead, apparently having commited suicide, after being raped (yes you heard me , raped). Mr Owen, must revisit his old ways we assume, to find the reason behind the death, and bring the villians to justice, London mobster style. Sounds like a great drama, but what we get is a long and plodding build up with many questions unanswered. The film begins to deliver on the promise of it's opening hour or so in the last 5 minutes of running time, but then leaves everything unanswered, and the viewer hanging. Owen is believable as the brooding ""Kray Twins"" style gangster in contemporary London, and there is a good supporting cast. But most will agree that the talent on display is wasted. This is a compelling film, and fairly good story, spoilt by some wayward directing, and a long slow build up to a nothing ending. That may sound harsh, and other professional ""Critics"" as usual have raved about this - I must have missed the point - very disappointing.",1106524800,4,1616,4.750889679715303
2129523,1,B0002WZTJS,"Besides how good Clive Owens looks after he cleans up, there is nothing to redeem this film. To have talented actors like Charlotte Rampling and Malcolm McDowell, and of course Clive himself, in a film and reduce them to utterly flat dialogue, undeveloped characters, and a very murky plot line is criminal! This is one of the worst films I have ever seen and I strongly advise everyone to avoid it!",1106179200,6,399,4.633802816901408
2129524,2,B0002WZTJS,"Watching Clive Owen in Croupier and Arthur, I looked forward to viewing this movie even though I knew it was a bad sign that I had not heard of it.  Ebert's and Roeper's ""two thumbs way up"" also sold me on renting it, but I wonder if we saw the same film.  Boy, what an incomplete storyline!

  At the conclusion, I immediately went to see if there was a director's commentary to discuss what happened.  My main complaint is the lack of explanation why Boad (Malcolm McDowell) committed such a heinous act.  The reveal never came, nor did the desired backstory delving into what drove Will into isolation.

  On the plus side, I enjoyed the British dialogue and the setting.  We are indeed two nations separated by a common language.  This however is not enough to recommend this film.

  Here's hoping that Clive Owen will finally get a role that lets him use more of his facial muscles and a script that doesn't need an accompanying Cliff Notes to understand the plot.",1105920000,3,970,4.558139534883721
2129525,1,B0002WZTJS,"the flattest film i have ever seen. there is no storyline, no suspense. no climax, no character development. there are a multitude of characters, most that appear for a short time, say a few lines, and are never seen again, and yet appear in the credits. 3 minutes before the movie ends, it gets very interesting, which left me saying to the rolling credits, ""NO, no no! that can't be the end!!! it just started!""

but judging by the fact that there are currently over 80 people selling this DVD on this site for less than a third of retail, i'm not the only one disappointed.",1105920000,4,576,4.433962264150943
2129537,2,B0002WZTJS,"I know it is not always fair to judge a director's latest work by stacking it against earlier efforts, but in the case of Mike Hodges, who has only made 2 previous films in 33 years (1971's ""Get Carter"" and the more recent ""Croupier"") expectations tend to run high. ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" reunites ""Croupier"" star Clive Owen with Hodges in another moody ""Brit Noir"". Curiously, Hodges appears bent on doing a semi-remake of ""Get Carter"". There is a glaringly similar set up borrowed from the former movie-a low-grade criminal's suspicious ""accidental"" death is tirelessly investigated and ultimately avenged by an estranged brother. Owens even plays his character with the same glum, poker-faced resolve that Michael Caine used in ""Carter"". Unfortunately, where the former film evolved into an engaging character study after the set-up, ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" quickly loses steam and turns into a by-the-numbers revenge thriller (and I apply the word ""thriller"" loosely here). The film is so somnambulent that I found myself marvelling at how much Malcolm McDowell and Sting resemble each other these days, rather than caring about whether McDowell's character would get his due (if I had a yo-yo with me, I probably would have practiced ""walking the dog"" while awaiting the inevitable denouement). Perhaps I missed some subtle subtext or point (always a possibility during a first viewing) but it will be a long time before I can steel myself to sit through this one again. If you are a fan of Hodges' previous films, you will probably want to satisfy your curiosity; but consider yourself duly warned!",1105401600,6,1611,5.06015037593985
2129538,1,B0002WZTJS,"I guess I was expecting a remake of ""Get Carter"" (the 1971 version) Done the way it should have been. I remembered watching Michael Caine rip though everything as a child and thinking he was awesome. So when the 2000 version with Sylvester Stallone came out I was willing to give it a try even *if* Rambo was playing the part. Alas my hopes were dashed and I rushed to see the original again only to realize that it wasn't so good either. Some things from the 70's just don't translate well, and I think that's what happened with ""Get Carter"". So in my mind I started seeing how a modern version of Carter should be done. When I first saw the trailer for ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" I felt as if  my prayers had been answered. When I found out Clive Owen (King Arther), Charlotte Rampling (Spy Game) and Malcolm McDowell (Clockwork Orange) were going to be in it, I began racking up the body count in my head.

 So it was a pretty severe let down. First off I expected *much* better directing from Mike Hodges, the pacing of this movie felt like some first time Film Festival entry, instead of from one of the writers of the original ""Get Carter"". Thinking perhaps I was letting my memory of the original cloud my judgment too much I watched it again. Trying to judge it on its own merits. I tried but the plot is obviously a rip off of Get Carter so its pretty impossible not to compare. And as bad as both version are so far (and they are pretty bad) In the first version you get a *lot* of violence (by 70's standards) In the 2nd you at least get to look at Rachael Leigh Cook make pouty faces. ""I'll sleep when I'm Dead"" doesn't even have that little hope.

 I wish I could say that the acting was stellar but again just didn't live up to its potential . Clive Owens keeps the same sad expression on his face throughout the entire movie without ever explaining *why* he was so sour. Charlotte Rampling looked as if someone used her hard then hung her up wet, which probable could have been explained by her charter only her acting didn't seem to match. Malcolm McDowell's role was so out of place that the best I can figure Hodges realized that he was going to get a few hours of McDowell's time and didn't have time to write a part for him so instead just stole a scene from Caligola. Don't waste your time or money.",1105315200,3,2320,4.275626423690205
2129539,2,B0002WZTJS,"We figured that with Clive Owen and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers headlining this film, it was a sure-fire good rental.  Given the U.K. gangster subtext, even catching a bit of the oomph contained in the comet that was 'Sexy Beast'...well, who could pass that up?

Too bad, then, this film was such a letdown.  It's certainly not due to either Owen or Rhys-Meyers, who have little to work with, frankly, in terms of a compelling narrative.  And one can't blame Charlotte Rampling or Malcolm McDowell either - Rampling's role is smallish, hazily drawn.  McDowell plays a pivotal part, but I never figured out what drove him to do the shocking act around which the film revolves.  I figured it was due to some deep-seated resentment or long-sheathed act of revenge.  In fact, it's explained as nothing of the sort.  In fact, it seems petty more than anything else.  And that makes the whole concept of the film downright perplexing.

I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out how this one went awry.  The US box office certainly wasn't interested in figuring it out either: it brought in only $360,759 during its run here according to Box Office Mojo.",1104969600,4,1148,4.776649746192893
2129540,1,B0002WZTJS,"One of the most luckluster and spineless entries into the British gangster genre made, ironically enough, by a filmmaker who defined it all several decades ago. See Get Carter, the original version, if you want to see stylish grace executed with poisonous aplomb and bitter vigor. Not a great film, but if you like this kind of stuff, you can't beat Michael Caine.

Clive Owen may be the first actor in cinema history to embark through an entire film project utilizing a single facial expression. Then again, he doesn't have much to go on; here's the basic plot: (if you think I might spoil something, then don't read ahead, although we find out all this stuff in the first 20 minutes or so).

Bad evil former gangster now retired hides in woods doing manual labor. He is evil, but now out of the lifestyle, and you can tell this because he's bearded, doesn't talk much, and has a glassy-eyed expression.

Bad gangster's younger brother is a man-about-town drugrunner, midlevel scumbag, who gets pulled into a warehouse and raped by Malcolm McDowell. Younger brother, dazed, startled, wanders home, and fittingly, commits suicide. Wouldn't you? He's one of the lucky ones.

Then we watch slowly, relentlessly, as Clive returns from hiding, finds out all this stuff that we already know, is given bare patchy explanatory mumbo-jumbo from other characters, and then kills who he needs to kill.

Visually dull, completely un-stylish, and utterly pointless. Everyone involved clearly wasn't sleeping enough, or was sleeping way too much. What else can I say? Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who I usually like, is wasted here, as is McDowell, who looks a bit put out to be involved in this at all. Even Charlotte Rampling turns up, in another absurdly superfluous character.

Sorry guys, really wanted to like this one. Didn't.",1104364800,18,1813,4.947368421052632
2129541,4,B0002WZTJS,"I can see why some viewers might be disappointed with this film: the box art (with Owen looking like a ""Mad Max""-era Mel Gibson starring in ""Payback,"" not to mention that unfortunately misleading pistol standing in for the ""L"" in the title, Sopranos' style) promises something quite different from what the movie actually is.

What it is is cold, calculating and deliberately paced.  Rather than sudden bursts of violence, this movie looks at how one particularly dire act of cruelty affects a group.

I know I'm in the minority but I wasn't exactly blown away by ""Croupier,"" the previous collaboration between Hodges and Owen. It started off with a shrewd intelligence and introduced me to a world I didn't know but was eager to learn about.  And then it kind of seemed to get lost along the way.

""Sleep,"" however, never lets down on its initial promise.  It is almost Leone-esque in its gradually escalating tension and, though Owen is a blank he's a blank for a very particular reason.  He's clearly capable of dishing out nastiness... but when is he going to act.  That's a question that haunts the entire story.

I found it even more satisfying than the similar ""Sexy Beast"" and, in creating and sustaining a sense of contemporary dread, it's more discomforting than most current ""horror"" films.",1104192000,3,1301,4.850678733031674

Unfortunately, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is simply a bad movie. Where to start- how about the homophobic undercurrent prevalent throughout the movie? According to this movie, the worse fate in the world is to be raped and the only logical answer is suicide. This movie is so rote and by-the-book, with absolutely no suspense or build up, that it felt like I was watching a graduate student film. Clive Owen, usually a fantastic actor, possibly does TOO GOOD a job during this movie, underacting to the point of practically sleepwalking through the part; Charlotte Rampling is wasted in her role while Malcolm McDowell ACTS as if he were wasted (on booze, that is).

2129544,4,B0002WZTJS,"I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD (Paramount) is a Mike Hodges atmospheric, minimalist, English revenge drama.  Taciturn, mysterious, Clive Owen (""Arthur"") returns to London after a self-imposed exile as a peaceful woodsman.  By chance, his younger brother has just committed suicide after being raped by Malcolm McDowell, an evil, arrogant, rich car dealer. Charlotte Rampling is Owen's former lover who warns him to leave and not seek revenge.  But there'd be no movie if he did that and what follows is much more about what is not explicitly revealed or stated. The stylish images are carefully composed and the structure of this existential drama at times leans precariously toward the pretentious, but fine acting, cinematography and a very cool score rescue this moody English noir and make it worth checking out.

What a waste of acting talent considering Clive barely has a pulse this entire film. Its all so much brooding Faustian grayness that the whole reformed or repentant bad guy thing is meaningless. The entire film is spent building up Clive as this uber toughguy and all he does is plug one guy and that's it! The entire premise (stop reading if you want to see the film) does not make sense. Three guys in tuxedoes rape a small time drug dealer-where is the motivation. Later we learn that the rapist Malcolm McDowell just didn't like him. And this guy is a fancy car dealer. Even the thugs in this movie are inadequate, the performances are uneven and Charlotte Rampling is wasted. This movie lacks action, the anger you would expect from a story where gangsters vie for power and a sibling who wants to take revenge for his brother's suicide loses control. Instead we are left with a waste of time. Shame on you Mike Hodges.",1101168000,4,1075,4.546391752577319
2129546,5,B0002WZTJS,"At first glance, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead seems like a very conventional film noir story but it is in fact told in a very unconventional way as director Mike Hodges refuses to spell things out. Will Graham (Owen) is a retired gangster brought out of self-imposed exile when he learns that Davey (Rhys Meyers), his young brother has apparently committed suicide. Will lives out in a very Twins Peaksian forest as a lumberjack. It's as if David Lynch directed a British gangster film in Twin Peaks-Fire Walk With Me mode-in other words, a series of downbeats. Will is drawn back into the city intent on finding out why David killed himself. He learns that his brother was mixed up in drugs and this leads to a nasty crime boss (McDowell). This forces Will to come to grips with his brother's death as he finds out what happened. The audience has to work out who everyone is and what their relation is to Davey.

Clive Owen delivers the right amount of intensity and has a very charismatic screen presence. He plays a very credible tough guy-quiet yet very driven. There is an air of silence around his character, a tangible aura that makes him something of an enigma. He has very little dialogue but he doesn't need it. His expressive eyes convey so much more and when he does speak, every word means something.

I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is the antithesis of contemporary gangster films. There is no flashy editing or a hip soundtrack a la Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino. Instead, Hodges employs invisible, methodical editing and a no-nonsense approach to the material reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts. Hodges draws out a long build-up to the eventual climax whereas most contemporary gangster films go for periodic bursts of violence to punctuate the story. The actual moment of revenge is oddly anticlimactic, not exactly the cathartic release you'd expect. The film ends just as the violence begins.",1101081600,6,1921,4.835866261398176
