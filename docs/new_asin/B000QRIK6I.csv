It begins at a newspaper publishing plant. There is bad publicity for a businessman, a candidate for the hot seat. Owen is upset over the news. Detective Kildare is given orders for tonight. Butch Owens arrives with three of his men. Louis gets his special order. Kildare learns why the phone booth is occupied! Men act suspiciously. Five men enter the restaurant, they are not in formal dress. The lights go out, there are shots! When the lights go on people run away. Men are wounded, Kildare survived. Kildare returns to Cheyenne Wyoming for his vacation.

But the road is closed and he crashes his car. His fathers ranch hands take him along to town. Breezy meets Carter the bartender in the Pool Hall. His daughter Ruth is the waitress there. Breezy attends the Cattlemens Association meeting. Butch Owens is the head of his protection association. Breezy objects to this group. The Owens gang have a way to show the need for protection! Carter will provide their alibi. The cowboys enter the Pool Hall. Breezy and Butch fight, Butch is given 24 hours to get out of town.

Breezy and Ruth converse. Butch tells his gang he will take Breezy for a ride. The gang takes their typewriter. Can Breezy be warned by telephone? No. Ruth borrows a horse to warn Kildare. The Owens gang rides by and uses their typewriter! Mr. Kildare is hit, the cowboys will take a short cut and head them off. The Owens gang takes shelter in the rocks. Breezy ropes their tommy gun and uses it against them! One man runs for the car but Breezy catches him; there is a fight. Butch escapes justice. Breezy and Ruth discuss their future.

This story seems incredible. There are more armed cowboys than the handful of gang members. Wyoming was the site of the Johnson County War of 1892 where the big corporate ranchers imported gunmen to drive out the small ranchers and homesteaders in order to steal their lands. But the ranchers grouped together and defeated the hire gunmen. This history inspired many Western movies in the 1930s-1940s.",1511049600,,2052,4.723463687150838
