991444,4,6305226601,"I saw this film when it first screened in 1951.  As a young impressionable hero wanna-be, I'll never forget Gene Evans in the opening scene as the camera closes in on him.  First you see the top of his helmet as it slowly rises over the lip of the ditch.  Then you see his eyes and then the camera shows the bullet hole in his steel helmet.  No one in the theater had any idea as to what was going on.  The camera then pulls back to reveal a ditch full of dead GI's with their hands tied behind their backs.  It was obvious what had happened.

As the film progresses, Evans' character Sgt. Zack, adopts a young Korean boy (who he names Short Round after his executioner's bullet which went though his steel pot but not his head, spun around, and fell out the bottom). Whenever Evans detects that danger is near, he shouts out ""Eat rice, Short Round"" and the Korean boy hits the dirt.

Zack and Short Round then hook up with members of a lost patrol and they hole up in an apparently deserted Korean pagoda.  Little did the troopers know that they were being stalked by a North Korean assassin who's goal was to murder them one by one.  The scenes inside the temple have a film noir quality or even surreality and are something not found in your standard war film.  It is a memorable and unique film.",989020800,9,1299,4.282786885245901
991445,5,6305226601,"Ever since I first saw this film in the theater, its images and power have stayed with me over the years. It was a typical low budget Lippert Pictures film. But the black and white picture quality was excellent and Sam Fuller's brilliant direction using scenes of fog and hilly terrain made all the difference.
Just like his other excellent Korean War film, ""Fixed Bayonets"", Fuller focuses on the individual G.I. at ground level. At a time when it was not fashionable, Fuller addresses racism without pulling any punches. Sergeant ""Iron Mike"" Zack is a cigar-chomping biggoted tough guy who is none too subtle in showing disdain for certain men in his adopted squad; ""chicken-fed"" lieutenant, ""Consci"" (conscientious objector) machine gunner and so forth.
But tough Fuller is also quick to show the real humanity of these different men. When ""Short-round"" (the young South Korean boy) is killed, Zack comes apart at the seams. When the Red Chinese attack their Buddhist temple in mass near the end of the film, all the men must pull together to survive. Devoid of glory and pomp, Fuller makes this a revellation with a brilliant ending.  Too few good films have been made concerning ""The Forgotten War"", but as far as I'm concerned, none have equalled Samuel Fuller's efforts, not even the excellent ""Pork Chop Hill.""",982886400,4,1318,4.936936936936937

And the Korean child. It's haunting, and perhaps disappointed some reviewers because it's not a visual battle after battle typical war film with direct confrontation. But throughout you are fully aware there's a WAR going on.

 I highly recommend this film. I've never seen one like it since.

For what it's worth, the whole film was written in days, shot in 10 days, and cost a whole $100,000!

It's almost akin in emotion to Paths of Glory, another fine war film, and not a typical million dollar extravaganza with tons of bombs and planes as the usual war movie is. But you KNOW they're there.

991724,5,6305226601,"Technically, there's no need for this review. This is fairly rare Sam Fuller, nobody would dig this deep into the catalog without a notion of what things are like. A brief summary: tough-as-nails infantryman ""Iron"" Mike Zack drags an inexperienced unit to create and defend an observation post, led by a young victim of the war nicknamed ""Short Round"".

The best thing about this movie is how wonderfully Gene Evans lives Sam Fuller's character, not an invincible Sgt Rock, but a tough, pragmatic soldier. Sam's writing in this movie is top quality pulp, with it's larger than life characters living through a war that piles difficulty on absurdity on tragedy.

As a trivia note, Fuller made this and two other movies (Baron Of Arizona and I Shot Jesse James) for infamous cheapie executive Robert Lippert. Lippert promised no interference if he money came in, and lived up to his promise. In my opinion, The Steel Helmet is the best of the three.

The bad: Oh my goodness does Griffith Park look nothing like Korea. The set for the Buddhist Temple that forms the centerpiece of the movie was obviously constructed by looking up ""Buddhism"" in an encyclopedia, as it looks nothing like Korean Buddhist temples. Further, ""Short Round""'s attempt at an Asian accent in English is almost as bad as his English accent in Korean. The writing is excellent and sympathetic to Koreans, but budget meant authenticity had to be sacrificed.

All in all, this is one of the best war movies of its time and worth seeing by anyone who watches movies frequently.",1442448000,2,1545,4.840909090909091
991725,4,6305226601,"Criterion compiles a collection of the most intriguing and artistically and creatively inclined films in cinema history from the most well renowned to the most obscure.  The DVD set of Samuel Fullers earlier films, DVD Eclipse Series 5:  The First Films of Samuel Fuller, which include critically acclaimed The Baron of Arizona (Vincent Price and Ellen Drew) I Shot Jesse James (Preston Foster and John Ireland), and The Steel Helmet (Steven Brodie and Robert Hutton).  Each film has a place of interest for viewers, especially The Steel Helmet.

The Steel Helmet (1951) centered upon the social climate of the Korean War.  The most fascinating aspect about the making of the film is that it was produced during the early months of the war but reflected on how the last war World War II and how soldiers transitioned into another one.  As viewers watch each soldier in the film, there are distinctions that show ambiguously, but one must also consider the period besides the war experience and how the world changed from 1945 to 1951; the Cold War was already in progress, reconstruction of Japan and Allied occupation of the country, and in the United States the Civil Rights movement was emerging and the military became a part of that movement, take for example the US Army.  Observing the characters in the film, it was evident the change progressed but not without repercussions within inter-racial and inter-related lines between Black, White, and Asian soldiers.

Director Samuel Fuller was known for tipping the scales in terms of issues that tugged at emotions and by utilizing the individual characters to convey concerns that occurred in society.  The other two films also provide social commentary within the lines of geography and region that also affected economic issues and the common man, the use of masculinity.  The entire set of films are thought provoking, be it through the historical backdrop of the conflict of the Korean War or the Wild West, there are comparisons that reflect upon the period in which they were made that may have been longing for a simpler time or a complex one or both.",1441584000,4,2114,4.946327683615819

991773,5,6305226601,"The First Films of Samuel Fuller is 3 film Criterion Collection set featuring I Shot Jesse James (1949), The Baron of Arizona (1950), and The Steel Helmet (1951). After over a decade of writing idiosyncratic B pictures these were Fuller's first 3 directorial efforts.

I Shot Jesse James (1949)

I stumbled upon I Shot Jesse James in the Criterion section of Hulu Plus, at the time I hadn't really heard of Fuller and I had never seen any of his films. Jesse James just chose me as I was in the mood for a western and I've always been fascinated by the Jesse James/Robert Ford story since seeing The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007). I Shot Jesse James is really Robert Ford's story, Fuller stages the Jesse James murder at the end of act one and then the rest of the film is an exploration of the public shame and regret that Ford felt. It's definitely lighter on action than other B westerns of the era and establishes Fuller's use of anti-hero protagonists. Robert Ford is a villain but the film empathizes with his shame.

The Baron of Arizona (1950)

Less emotionally affecting but still interesting is The Baron of Arizona (1950), Fuller's follow-up starring Vincent Price as James Reavis. A 19th century forger and con-man, Reavis concocts a scheme to claim ownership of the Arizona territory, a true story that in real life led to Reavis dishonestly collecting millions in land rents from those who actually owned their own land. Price's character has some of his natural creepy vibe but is never really menacing or threatening. It's an interesting film, but it doesn't emotionally hold as much weight like the other two films in the set.

The Steel Helmet (1951)

This is the film where Fuller really comes into his own. Filmed just 6 months into the Korean War, The Steel Helmet was the first film set in the Korean War. It's also known as the first Hollywood film to mention the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. That and another strong scene of a North Korean prisoner criticizing Jim Crow laws landed Samuel Fuller on FBI's watch list as a possible communist. This film feels light years more sophisticated than The Baron, it's more confidently photographed and has a script that doesn't strongly follow any plot structure. Often in war films the little unit of ragtag soldiers is given some mission to hang the plot on, they have to seize a hill, or rescue a prisoner, or something like that. In this movie Gene Evans' Sgt. Zack leads a unit that just wanders around trying to stay alive, fighting whatever North Koreans they run across. Eventually they're given an assignment to transport a prisoner but they don't succeed at that.

Sgt. Zack, another non-traditional Fuller protagonist, is cynical and scruffy and is a deliberate contrast to the clean-shaven, square-jawed, patriotic war heroes of the era played by John Wayne and the like. Zack shows little concern or compassion when they lose members of the unit, he doesn't really show and grief until towards the end of the movie, and quickly his grief turns to a rage where he shoots a prisoner.

This is a great set, The Steel Helmet is definitely the class of the set, but I Shot Jesse James has some fantastic scenes and The Baron of Arizona is an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes as well.",1418688000,,3317,4.726643598615917

991879,5,6305226601,"""The Steel Helmet"" has not been available for years on DVD, and finding this was a joy!

For those of you who do not know who Sam Fuller is, he is the director who brought us ""The Big Red One"", one of the finest and most accurate World War 2 films ever made.  Mr. Fuller was a dogface rifleman in the 1st Infantry Division, and wanted people to know how gritty and terrible war was. During the filming of the ""Big Red One"", he came up behind his young actors and fired a .45 pistol over their heads and when they hit the dirt, he snorted, ""That's what combat's like!""

Gene Evans' portrayal of the hard-bitten sergeant in Korea in this film is superb, and was followed up in 1951's ""Fix Bayonets!"", which I also highly recommend.  Both served as models for the the comic ""Sgt Rock"" which I loved as a kid.

Both these films rank with ""Battleground!"", but because they were considered B-movies, never got the recognition.  If you want to see what life was like for the WW2 and Korean-era ground pounders this is the film for you.",1251763200,2,1028,4.356020942408377
991880,5,6305226601,"There are few contemporary Korean War movies. Samuel Fuller's THE STEEL HELMET is by far the finest of a miniscule lot.

""Helmet"" is a gritty little indie effort that deftly mixes beauty and horror with a persistent air of foreboding. The tragedy of war is well-depicted, from the destruction of a lovely pagoda-like Buddhist temple, to a soldier blown to bits when he touches a boobytrapped body, to the murder of a child-- an act we antiseptically call ""collateral damage."" Heavy stuff for any era; quite remarkable for 1951.

It's the story of infantry Sgt. Zach (Evans), an escapee from execution by North Koreans who is helped by a South Korean boy he calls ""Short Round."" The two encounter a remnant of an American patrol that includes a black medic, a Japanese-American sergeant, a private who never talks, a priest-trainee, a young fellow obsessed with regrowing his lost hair, a ""conscie"" (conscientious objector) lieutenant, and so on. This collection of oddities find their way to a majestic temple in the middle of nowhere that is later attacked by hundreds of enemy troops.

As a WWII infantryman, Sam Fuller saw much action in the ETO, where he ultimately earned the Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He later drew on these experiences for the realism that permeates his war films.

In one of his only two screen appearances, Lynn Stalmaster here portrays a second looey. He is best known as casting director on almost 400 movies (many quite famous) from 1950 to the present.

991882,3,6305226601,"The Steel Helmet is probably one of the greatest war films ever put on screen. Fuller transposed many of his own experiences into this Korean War tale, giving the viewer a very raw, gritty look at combat- filmed during a time when you couldn't really show graphic violence on the screen. At the time he shot this movie, WWII had only been over for 5-6 years, so Fuller's feelings are still intense and fresh. I actually like this film better than ""Fixed Bayonets"" (which isn't bad) and ""The Big Red One"", which he'd been trying to make ever since he was demobilized from the Army.

So, I'm guessing because the other two films in this DVD package are less interesting, the Eclipse Film series is betting that the fans of ""The Steel Helmet"" will break down and buy the whole thing, just for Fuller's war movie classic.

Personally, I'm holding out as long as I can. Bottom line, ""The Steel Helmet"" is brilliant and powerful. I can't vouch for the other two. Sell ""The Steel Helmet"" individually, and I'd pay handsomely for it.",1222473600,4,1025,4.595628415300546

Superb psychological western with a first-class performance of John Ireland as Robert Ford. Note the scene of the theatre when Robert Ford is trying, as an actor playing his own character, to recreate Jesse James's murder before the audience: simply a little jewel. Highly recommended.

THE BARON OF ARIZONA ***1/2 1950. Written and directed by Samuel Fuller. An office clerk imagines an unbelievable swindle, patiently forging proofs that his wife is the legal owner of Arizona. Vincent Price is imperial as a womanizer, a monk, a gypsy and finally as the Baron of Arizona.

I remember it as being a friendship story between a U.S. soldier and young boy (dubbed ""Short Round"", just like the ""Temple Of Doom"" character) during the Korean War. It's directed by Sam Fuller, who's made other vivid films like ""Shock Corridor"" and ""The Big Red One"". His films can be brash and lurid, but I like the grit of his war pictures - I think his own experiences as a war correspondent gives them a verisimilitude that most contemporary takes lack.

Unfortunately, it's not available on DVD yet - it's out there on VHS, so hopefully you can see it on cable, or rent it at a really good video store (you know the kind - the ones that have sections of titles sorted by director). It's worth the effort!",1171065600,2,883,4.411042944785276
991979,5,6305226601,"During Korea's War, an American patrol is exterminated except Zack, a veteran Lieutenant. But again he will be sent into a suicide mission; to take by storm a Temple placed at the top of a hill. Despite Driscoll and Zack don't agree one each other. There will be an intense enemy besiege and when he becomes again the only survivor, he will put his helmet on Driscoll's grave.

The multiple personal experiences lived by Sam Fuller are shown with all its crude nakedness, without moral codes or conventional hindrances. He was an unpleasant filmmaker for the cinema, due he did not seem to understand the people wanted to forget the horrors and nasty fears of a bloody War, while he insisted over and over around this theme. It's not a mere casualty he filmed such penetrating Noir films in between: Pick up on South Street would seem to confirm it. When he realized about it, he turned his camera toward the inner boundaries of the soul of the society (Shock corridor and The naked kiss), and representing to may sectors what eventually the new German generations to come in the seventies for their country; a little stone in the shoe; an incessant timber in the collective conscious.

Through the years this film has become in significance what The Burmese harp for Japan; an active and untiring voice without self indulgent expressions, allowing the images talk by themselves.

Stunning, absorbing and mesmerizing movie.",1152576000,2,1423,4.871900826446281
991980,4,6305226601,"My 1st time that I saw this film was as a young wanna be GI. After the Army and as a Teacher I met ""Short Round"" who happened to become my Principal named Bill Chun. (A really good man and an excellent Principal.) He has regaled me with tales of his short Movie career and they were amusing. He had nothing but good things to say about the cast and the film. I commned it to you for a worms eye view of the ""Old Army"". By the by Mr. Chun did a hitch in the Regular Army in the late 50's later on before going into teaching.",1070841600,11,523,3.8518518518518516
991981,5,6305226601,"One of the earliest films to deal with the Korean War, Steel Helmet has good action (on a limited budget, which shows in the
largest battle scene), well-drawn characters, and visits more than
one contemporaneous issue, including racism and manipulation
of that issue by the Soviets and their satellites during the Cold War. I saw the film originally in its year of release.
For me, the best element of the film is Gene Evans' portrayal of Sgt. Zack, a hard boiled, but not cast-iron career soldier.
Viewed as a document both for, and yet a little ahead of its time, Steel Helmet is a great lower budget contribution to
the film literature of the Korean War.",1024531200,13,657,4.672413793103448
991982,4,6305226601,"Samuel Fuller's name may sound unfamiliar to many movie fans in America.  This is a pity because Fuller, admired in Europe, made a lot of films that can still shock you.  ""Steel Helmet"" is one of them.
It describes hard times experienced by the soldiers during the Korean War, and though the story sometimes is melodramatic, and the film is a low-budget one (obviously stock footage is used in the climax), ""Steel Helmet"" always has a ring of truth.  The grim reality of war is presented with Fuller's original style, and he never gives us an easy solution to the conflicting relationships between the convincing characters.
To movie fans, however, the most surprising element is the character ""Short Round.""  The idea of putting a young, innocent Korean kid and a veteran sergeant together in a dangerous battlefield, and making their relationship a touching one, is a thing that no one but Sam Fuller can achieve. And there is even an unexpected sense of humor in there (check out the scene in which something unusual is mistaken for shell dropping, and disturbs the soldiers' sleep). So, if you are moved by the films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Platoon,"" this is a must for you.
Trivia: the boy's name ""Short Round"" is used by Steven Spielberg in his ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom,"" and director Samuel Fuller makes a cameo appearance in Spielberg's ""1941.""  At least, Fuller is respected by him, this fact tells you.",1006646400,13,1432,4.804878048780488

7885458,5,6305226601,"Due to how expensive this film is, I rented just ""Baron"" on netflix.

Granted, I am a huge fan of Vincent Price's films and acting style and his one-of-a-kind presence on-screen, but this was a great performance by Price. I was not only surprised, but thoroughly pleased and entertained by his oily, polished charlatan James Addison Reavis. The plot of this extremely unique and beautifully-filmed movie revolves around the slick, educated forger Reavis and his attempt to convince the US government that Arizona actually belongs to a long-lost bloodline of Spanish nobles represented in a young woman. All of this is thanks to a land deed freshly and expertly forged by Reavis himself during a complicated journey he takes to Spain.

""Baron of Arizona"" was made in 1950, and for this reason, I found the film's honest style to be that much more impressive. In others, it was thankfully absent of the Jimmy Cagney ""whaddaya say, whaddaya know"" style. In a smoothly-paced film, the advancement of the plot just never lets up -- it is fascinating from beginning to end. With such a rich plot to carry out, the casting of the legendary Vincent Price is that much more brilliant as he is at the top of his game as the Baron.",1478649600,,1220,4.75
7885459,4,6305226601,"Read a capsule review of this 1951 film somewhere and it sounded interesting.  A very low budget affair, it purports to tell the story of a grizzled veteran, a sergeant, who has narrowly missed execution by the North Koreans.  He picks up a Korean boy who dogs his steps.  Together they run into other GIs who have lost there way.  The grizzled veteran is asked to provide the leadership, despite the presence of inexperienced officers.  In the process, prejudices against black soldiers and revealed as well as the place of conscientious objectors.

7885464,4,6305226601,"Criterion created a series of ""lost, forgotten, or overshadowed classics"" that have been gathered in one package.  This one features director Samuel Fuller's first 3 films.  Overall the films are entertaining and certainly different in tone and focus than those that were otherwise released by Hollywood.  Here is a review of each of the films:

I SHOT JESSIE JAMES (1949) - 3.5 Stars
In his directorial debut, Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, turns the traditional western on its head. This isn't a shoot-'em-up that audiences had become accustomed to but a blueprint of even better and more thoughtful westerns like High Noon, Shane, 3:10 to Yuma and others that followed. Preston Foster got top billing as John Kelley an older suitor of Bob Fords girlfriend played by Barbara Britton. The story isn't really about Kelley or even Jesse (Reed Hadley), but about the conflicted Ford nicely played by newcomer John Ireland.

Ford shoots Jesse in the back in order to gain a pardon from the governor. He wants to settle down with Cynthy (Britton), a saloon singer but his criminal background prohibits an honest future. Still Jesse James using the pseudo name of Mr. Howard was well thought of in the community which turns against Ford. Fuller attempts to provide a more sympathetic picture of Ford and to some degree succeeds. This isn't a great film like those mentioned above but is a thoughtful change of pace with some fine performances.

THE BARON OF ARIZONA (1950) - 3.5 Stars
This was acclaimed director Samuel Fullers second film (after I Shot Jesse James).  Like the previous film, this one is a bit unusual to be sure.  The key plot point is so ridiculous that it is almost unfathomable.  But surprisingly, the story is based on fact.  After the Civil War, the Arizona territory became fertile land for the western migration.  James Addison Reavis (Vincent Price, House of Wax) was a war veteran and a Missouri realtor who landed in Arizona.

Reavis comes up with the idea of falsifying a claim to the territory proposing that the land was gifted to nobleman by the King of Spain, who at the time owned the land.  He had to go to great lengths to convince the U. S. Government that the claim is legitimate.  This is the story Fuller delivers here using his own script.  The years-long preparation for the ruse begins with Reavis identifying a young girl (Karen Kester) who has been adopted by a man called Pepito (Vladimir Sokoloff) after her parents died.  Reavis convinces Pepito that Sofia is indeed the child of the noble Peralta family and takes them into his own home.  Reavis even hires a full time governess called Loma (Beulah Bondi) to educate and teach the young girl how to act as well as learn her ABCs.

Reavis then heads to Spain where the original deeds of transfer are kept.  He will need to erase and replace the handwritten information.  The books of this era (1750s) are kept at a monastery in a rural part of the country.  Reavis signs on as a monk in training and lives for years until he is trusted and given access to the secured books.  Hes become adept in the art of calligraphy and learned enough chemical science to create a fluid that would erase ink and another compound for the ink to replace the entry.  A few complications ensue including a couple brief love affairs which the cad uses to further his own plans.

Once he returns to Arizona, Sofia is all grown up (Ellen Drew) and is prime picking for Reavis to marry.  They become husband and wife and soon after, The Baron and The Baroness.  In Phoenix they make their claim to the entirety of the territory as their property.  Reavis has enough detailed information that the Government must take notice.  An agent for the Department of the Interior named Griff (Reed Hadley) who specializes in forgery and fraud is assigned to investigate.  After travels to Spain he concludes before a federal judge that he doesnt have proof that Reaviss claim is false.

While this is going on, the residents of the territory are up in arms about the prospect of losing their property or having to pay rent to Reavis.  But something is off.  Reavis turns down $25 million of 1870s cash to relinquish his claim.  So what is it that he wants?  He says he wants his claim to be legitimized.  Is his ego that big?  He just wants his elaborate scam to be declared authentic?  Before we get too far, it must be pointed out that Sofia and Pepito begin to smell something fishy.  In fact, Pepito tells Reavis something that disproves the whole of Reaviss argument.  And Sofia doesnt want to displace the townsfolk, especially now that theyve become potentially violent and may have her hubby in their gunsights.

Fuller takes us on this unlikely journey with excellent storytelling and some fine photography by James Wong Howe.  The acting is fine, although seeing Price as a handsome ladies man is a bit of a stretch.  I also had to chuckle when the villagers with their pitchforks, errifles come after Reavis and his family.  They barricade themselves inside his office piling up chairs in front of the door as mob-stopping barriers.  Uh, sure.  In the end.well youll just have to see the film or look it up.  What you know for certain is that Arizona did become our 48th state in 1912.

THE STEEL HELMET (1951) - 4 Stars
This was Samuel Fullers third film and catapulted him to the big leagues shortly after its release.  Surprisingly, the film about the Korean War, was released only 6 months after the conflict began, making it the first of that subject.  Shot in 10 days with a miniscule budget, Fuller not only took on the violence and heroism of war, but abject racism and bigotry.  Gene Evans stars as Sgt. Zack, a grizzled infantry man whose platoon was captured by the Chinese (or gooks as Zack calls them).  After being hog-tied, the POWs (called PWs here) are executed (off screen).

Zach is the lone survivor, feinting death as the bullet entering his helmet merely rattled around causing a contusion on his cheek.  The bullet-holed helmet remains a character throughout the film including the final scene.  Zach is rescued by a 12-year old South Korean boy (William Chun) called Short Round (also the name of a boy in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).  Zach agrees to take him along with the boy playing the role of a pack mule.  They run into another straggler, Corp. Thompson (James Edwards), a black medic whose unit met a similar fate as Zachs.  He was kept alive to care for the enemys wounded and later escaped.

The trio then meet up with a squad, led by a recently commissioned Lieutenant Driscoll (Steve Brodie) and his sergeant Buddha-Head Tanaka (Richard Loo), a Japanese American.  The rest of the squad is a mixed bag.  The conscientious objector, the quiet one, the inexperienced radioman and a Korean.  In one of the better action sequences, Zach and Tanaka work together to locate and take out Red Chinese snipers.  The group has been ordered to a Buddhist temple to await further orders.  Once there, they are unaware that a North Korean major (Harold Fong) is hiding.

After he is eventually captured, the well-spoken enemy questions Tanaka and Thompson as to why they remain loyal to the U. S. given their treatment back home.  The issues of Japanese-American internment during WW II and African-American discrimination and other social ills are in the forefront.  Both minorities respond patriotically.  Thompson talks about riding in the back of the bus.  But he says maybe in 20 years we can ride in the middle of the bus and in 20 more years we can ride at the front.  Fuller, who also wrote the script, was pretty accurate.  If I have an issue with the film, it has to do with the cavalier reaction to a fellow soldiers death.  Ill chalk it up to the fog of war.  Fuller created a fine film of war and its effects and at the same time raises the conscientiousness of the viewer.  Recommended.",1469923200,4,7920,4.6869565217391305
