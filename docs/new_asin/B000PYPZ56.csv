8570638,2,B000PYPZ56,"I am a Goju practitioner x 2o years. I believe this video does offer historic footage of Gogen Yamaguchi and you can see him personally perform many of the katas on the Goju Kai curriculum. It is inspiring to see him enter the waterfall too. At the end is footage from the funeral where Sanchin is performed by the group. Also 3 karateka perform Seipai, Suparinpei and Kururunfa simultaneously. The cameraman focuses mostly on the Seipai kata performer. Lastly, Goshi Yamaguchi performs Hakatsuru Kata (I believe this may also be known as the Master's Kata Genkaku). Do not confuse with Shotokan's Gankaku. The footage is very similar to the other video ""The Cat"". After the introduction, there is no narration (in the CAT film, George Alexander gives a narration of the events portrayed). . The footage from the training camp is extremely poor with skipping, occasional shakiness and color artifact. The end funeral scene is much clearer than anything I have seen. It is in black and white and Goshi Yamaguchi's kata is more easily seen. One major detractor is there is no voice for the majority of the video. A monotonous, annoying techno track plays in the background. It is probably beneficial to play this without voice after the brief narrated introduction. Recommended only for the most hard core Japanese Goju Kai practitioner or off shoot system. There is a paradoxical lack of any published footage from Gogen Yamaguchi after this 1960's reel from one of his training camps. Osu!",1199145600,,1489,4.936254980079681
