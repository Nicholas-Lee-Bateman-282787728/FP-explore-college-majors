2303074,5,B0009NSEA6,"I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a film festival in El Paso, Texas where it sold out three times.  This film pulled at my heart strings.  It will open up many opportunities for discussion about the serious problems facing us with this complicated problem that affects so many lives.  I would love to have been able to see it again in a movie theatre as would all my friends who have seen it as well.  Well done!",1363132800,3,422,4.2375
2303075,5,B0009NSEA6,I enjoyed this film very much. It touched on many levels from suspense to laughter to drama. All revolving around different characters who seem to be all connected somehow. Great movie. Wish it would have made it into the cinemas world wide instead of just DVD.,1361491200,,261,4.695652173913044
2303076,5,B0009NSEA6,"Illegal is truly a wonderful movie, inspiring, courageous, and thought provoking. Looking foward to seeing more from these actors in the future!",1360627200,,144,5.590909090909091
2303077,5,B0009NSEA6,"Quite a neat little film from the WB/First National British studio.  After her husband squanders all her money away on booze and gambling, a woman opens an after hours nightclub which becomes successful.  By sending her 2 daughters away to school, she manages to keep them unaware of the illegal club.  The Roan DVD is quite good quality-wise.  The only problem is a couple of instances where the top part of the picture rolls.  Perhaps due to a VHS transfer or some other transfer issue.",1259712000,2,488,4.694117647058824

8063665,2,B0009NSEA6,"This was a sad attempt to present a complicated subject.  The better movies are ""Crossing Over' with Harrison Ford and 'El Norte"" ( The last one is a tear jerker). The first explores immigrants from other countries while the latter concentrates on a brother and sister who leave Guatemala to travel to the USA.  There Is also 'Alambrista' which is a drama about a Mexican coming to the USA illegally and his reaction and interplay  with a young lady who helps him.",1429315200,,464,4.634146341463414
