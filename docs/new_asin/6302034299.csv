417474,5,6302034299,"Really, This little tidbit of erotica is entertaining. No not in the usual scintillating way, well yes that too, but I mean the story is not just an excuse to show naked bodies. It really is entertaining, honest injun!

Loosely based on the children's fairie tale Cinderella, this film is like no other Cinderella flick. I would describe this as a satirical, soft porn, Musical Comedy. By soft porn, I mean of course. That while there is nudity aplenty and sensuous scenes, some even simulating coitus, there is no graphic sex.

The story is similar to the fairie tale with a couple exceptions. Cinderella is played by an extremely lovely lass, Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith. I had never heard of her before but I was enthralled by her beauty, so I looked into her bio. Unfortunately Cheryl passed away in 2001 at the relatively young age of 45. She apparently had a tumultuous life, which included a bout with drug addiction. Anyway Cheryl was a wisp of a woman resembling another Cheryl named Ladd.

In the movie, she lived with her haggard stepmother, and two homely and devious step sisters and she was invited by the King's Chamberlain to the Royal Ball but her Fairie Godmother turned out to be a burglar on the run. He didn't have a wand but in his sack of recent booty, he discovered a contraption which performed the same trick turning the waiflike Cinderella into an exquisitely beautiful creature, after which she is off to the castle to bewitch the Prince.

Now the Prince, being a practical prince as princes go, had his own spin on how he would choose his future bride. He gathered the six most attractive ladies into his bedroom and each of the six was to take her turn showing the blindfolded prince why she should be chosen. The last I believe, was Cinderella and while she was about to close the deal with a most excited Prince, the clock started chiming and the Fairie Godburglar rushed in, grabbed her and rushed back to the carriage before it turned back into a watermelon and the horses returned to snails.

Now it wouldn't be Cinderella if she didn't leave a shoe behind and of course it was the only clue to the identity of our lass but if the shoe fit it was only to allow you to engage in the real test. I think I'll stop here. Use your imagination for the rest.

Conclusion

As I mentioned, Cinderella is a musical and yes there were several songs sung by the main characters. The singing wasn't great but it was better than Lee Marvin or Clint Eastwood in ""Paint Your Wagon"" and the songs weren't bad. The actors and actresses, with the exception of Kirk Scott and Sy Richardson, none of which I have names, were hamming it up, which fit right in with the comedy aspect of the story. The Director is Michael Pataki and he did an excellent job of keeping the movie moving along and maintaining interest.

Cinderella, which lasts 88 min., was probably a low budget effort but the sets weren't too bad. I've seen worse in bigger budget mainstream movies, which leads me to my rating. When it comes to movies in this genre (Erotica, Soft Porn) I only compare it to movies in this genre and rate it accordingly. That is why, If I was comparing Cinderella to a mainstream movie it would probably be three stars but I have rated this gem five stars, for it is the best erotic movie I have yet seen.",1120521600,94,3314,4.511666666666667
417475,5,6302034299,"I believe that it is a great version of a fairytale grown up. Not for kids at all. Cinderalla was also a lucky girl getting blessed with that gift she recieved from her god""mother"".",1075852800,6,181,4.352941176470588
417476,5,6302034299,"Truly a camp masterpiece, this wonderful grown-up retelling of the classic fairytale has it all!  Cinderella leads a dismal life of cooking, cleaning, scrubbing and sitting at the spinning wheel (which, does more than make thread!)  Her stepsisters (one of whom looks like Bette Midler did in the 70's while the other one resembles Columbia from Rocky Horror) are evil, cruel and over sexed as can be.  When a great ""ball"" (orgy) is held at the palace in honor of the impotent prince (my kingdom won't come)  her evil stepmother throws her invitation into the fire.  The day is saved by her scene-stealing ""fairy"" godmother, a grossly stereotypical gay black thief who has actually broken into her house with the intention of robbing it.  A magic wand in his bag of stolen goods soon turns a watermelon and snails into her horse and carriage.  He also uses it's power to give her a special gift that I can only refer to as a ""snapper"" in this review.  This special gift cures the prince's impotence just as the clock strikes midnight and she flees the palace.  Sadly, the lucite platform wedgie heel she leaves behind fits every girl in the kingdom so the prince must ""frolic"" with all of them in search of the girl with the ""gift"".  Finally he finds his princess and after saving fairy godmother from the chopping block, they ride off happily ever after.  Songs in this film such as ... My Kingdom Won't Come.... Art To Zebras... Do It To Me... and  Ooh, That Snapper... are my favorite part of the film! (There should have had a soundtrack album!)  Hopefully some distributor will get this one out on DVD someday soon!",1024012800,16,1620,4.6421052631578945

Oh, not because of the sex (there isn't any, really, just some pretend stuff) or the genital/tittie shot, the singing, the acting, or video & audio quality - but because all of these have been combined in one movie which destroyed any possible entertainment value.

The video quality and scratchy soundtrack are ample evidence that this copy (streamed) is a copy of a copy of a copy.  Absolutely horrendous.

All attempts at ""sex"" and eroticism are gratuitous and do nothing to move the story along.

The acting is, perhaps, one step above the acting of the famous pornography actors of the 70's abd 80's, which basically means the acting is poor.

The music - both vocal and instrumental - is the best thing about this flick, but it is a far cry from the quality of a true musical.

I really don't know how to describe this movie other than to say that it is a sexless, musical sex comedy.  Breasts are bared at every opportunity.  Cinderella (Cheryl Smith) sings while shes spinning, her breasts unfettered by any garment.  The phrase let it all hang out comes readily to mind.  Everyone runs around with their costumes half on but no one really seems to notice.  The plot more or less follows the fairy tale.  There are plenty of pratfalls.  The sex that is featured throughout deals mostly with women on women.  In lieu of acting, people contort their faces into bizarre grimaces.  The dialog is corny.  The songs are insipid.  Some of the situations border on the grotesque.  Its not quite as racy as youd expect considering that was their objective.  Thirty-nine years after the fact, its more of a puerile oddity than the naughty bawdy ribald spoof that it claims to be.

417964,4,6302034299,"And now for something completely different 

Once upon a time, Your Humble Reviewer lived in a strange kingdom called Texas. One lonely night he imbibed too much mead and found himself staring at a late-night movie on Cinemax. The movie had lots of nudity and sex, and the story was very silly. Alas, the nasty mead eventually caused Your Humble Reviewer to drift off into dreamland, until 

 the following morning, when bits and pieces of the Cinemax movie began to crop up in his foggy memory bank. The film had been called ""Cinderella,"" and indeed it featured wicked stepsisters and a fairy godmother and a carriage ride to the big ball. But it also had sex scenes. And music and dancing. Disco-flavored music. Most perplexing of all, it seemed to Your Humble Reviewer that the movie  had not sucked.

Many moons later, in the year 2015 and while he dwelled in a new kingdom called Minnesota, Your Humble Reviewer once again watched ""Cinderella,"" which had recently been issued on DVD. And lo and behold, it still didn't suck. Quite the contrary; parts of this soft-core-porn-musical-comedy were actually a hoot, and the songs and choreography were, well, quite good.

The plot: What, you don't know the story of Cinderella? The plot in this version is the same, albeit with adults-only alterations. The fairy godmother, for example, is played by black actor Sy Richardson who, as a fun-loving thief, steals every household good in sight and every scene he appears in. The handsome prince, in his quest to find the enchanting Cinderella, slips more than a shoe onto comely maidens. Oh, and then there is the snapping p---y .

Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith plays the beloved lead, which in this telling of the fairy tale requires her to be gullible (check), cute as a button (check), personable (check), and often naked (check and check again). Sadly, Smiths real life was apparently no fairy tale. According to her Wikipedia biography, a few years after ""Cinderella,"" Smith became addicted to heroin, which eventually led to a pair of prison stints and her death from liver disease and hepatitis at age 47.

Its not likely that NBC will be inspired to produce this version of Cinderella as one of its live musical holiday specials. Along with the voluminous sex and skin, this is a low-budget affair, with bad dubbing, cheesy sets, and dime-store special effects. On the other hand, this 1977 oddity boasts music and songs by Andrew Belling with witty lyrics, an energetic cast, amusing 1970s pop-culture references, and some numbers that are better than what youll find in many legitimate musicals. Its all very good-natured and fun.

In the end, of course, they all bonk happily ever after. Merry Christmas. -- grouchyeditor.com",1449446400,33,2726,4.930131004366812

Well, maybe I would now as they approach middle age, but I would be comfortable watching it with any adult with a mature sense of humor. Too bad this movie is so hard to find. It's likely that any version you find at all (IF you can find it on DVD) is going to be a copy of a copy and very expensive.",1442448000,4,599,4.084745762711864

418057,3,6302034299,"You know the story. A young woman is mistreated by her step mother and sisters, gets her chance at true love when she goes to the Prince's ball with the magical aid of her fairy god ""mother"".
The god-mother, played by Sy Richardson, in this instance is a male African-American thief who has, conveniently enough, just stolen a magic wand. Normally I wouldn't feel obliged to mention a characters race but in this case, his ethnicity is an undeniable facet of the role.  Not being a member of the PC police, I'll leave it to others as to whether the jokes and actions are racist or not. That being said, the character is one of the highlights of the movie.
Cinderella is played by Cheryl Smith, sometimes also known as Rainbeaux Smith, had a number of roles in '70's exploitation movies but also appeared with Cheech and Chong's in their best cinema efforts. Ms. Smith plays it straight and fairly low key, leaving the mugging and nonsense (of which there is plenty) to the other characters.
If you are at all familiar with this genre of 70's era nudie fairy tales, you probably know what to expect. Cinderella is in my opinion one of the better attempts. Overall, an enjoyable R-rated fairy tale with surprisingly good music and tons of nudity. There is one brief scene cut from this version, the step mother's song during the ball. Fortunately, it doesn't detract from the movie.
I was looking forward to a better look at this film but unfortunately, the image quality of this DVD is poor, and except for the widescreen aspect, not significantly better than my old VHS copy.",1434240000,20,1575,4.645161290322581
418058,2,6302034299,"This release came out of nowhere from Full Moon and I had high hopes for a definitive release of this 70's Classic. The last 2 DVD releases were the abysmal ""3-D"" version from Blue Laser followed by the regular version,also by Blue Laser. Those were manufactured on PAL DVD-r's and would not play on USA machines,only computers. Yes you read that right...PAL DVDR. Both those releases came with no booklets,no bonus features and bad covers.
And now comes the Full Moon release. Will it have a booklet! NO. Will it have bonus features! NO. Will it be the full 94 minutes listed on the back cover!! A BIGTIME NO. Will the print be the best so far!!! NO. its a big no to all of those and a big disappointment.
The print is better on the regular Blue Laser release (IF you can get it to play) which also has a longer running time of 1:32:57 compared to the inferior Full Moon print which runs a full 2 minutes shorter at 1:30:53. Im not sure what 2 minutes are cut out but i can only ask why?
Wow,another botched release. At least Full Moon is a pressed disc that will work in your machine.
The movie itself is awesome. The songs are good,the acting is good,the sets & costumes are great,there are genuinely funny parts,there is lots of nudity and its got the beautiful Cheryl Smith.

A:wouldn't play in multiple players
B:Had NO extras,title menu or chapters
C:The ""3D"" is horrible,basically unwatchable and it didn't include regular 2D Version.

Well,they finally released this regular 2D version but unfortunately again on lousy quality DVD-r disc that STILL WONT PLAY IN 2 DIFFERENT BLU RAY PLAYERS + another DVD player.
It will however play in an old LG DVD player and on my computer. My LG is region free so i am starting to think these genius are maybe copying these in PAL format. Its either that or they are using poor quality blank discs. Whatever it is,these discs SUCK.

This release still has no extras and no menu,the movie just starts right up when/if you can get it to play.

So the cover is pretty nice (boobs on the back too) and IF YOU CAN GET IT TO PLAY the picture and sound are the nicest so far of this release. Better than the old VHS releases and the ridiculous 3D version.

As for the movie? I love it. The story & songs are very good and funny,the costumes (when they actually wear clothes) are nicely done,the performances are good,the girls are very pretty,especially Cheryl Smith (R.I.P) and there is plenty of non-stop nudity. Its just a fun adult spin on the classic fairy tale that could only have been made in the glorious 1970's.

To sum up: the movie is awesome and if you can get the disc to play its nice quality but this Cinderella deserves much better....Please guys,do a pressed disc release with menu and any kind of extras you can find. Or at very least use some DVD'r that work. Geez.

Now to this release.
The DVD-R disc would not play in either of my different model Sony blu ray players and i can only play it in my LG DVD machine. Strike one.
I have a Panasonic Plasma 55Gt30 which automatically recognizes the side by side 3D setting but the 3D effect is so minimal and poor that it's a complete waste to have to view it this way. Strike two
Unfortunately even though this has never been available on DVD and the VHS has been out of print for about 25 years they chose not to include the regular 2D version of the movie,it only has the 3D version with no extras so the movie has STILL never been released on DVD and I have to hold on to my VHS tape.
BIG STRIKE 3

The pluses are: Its got a nicely done cover (although i wish they used the original poster art) and the print is pretty nice (certainly an upgrade from VHS)

If you are getting this for the 3D,forget it.
If you've never seen the movie,I suggest you look around the internet for a VHS transfer copy in 2D rather than watch it this way.
As for me,I'll keep my copy since its better than nothing.

But it's not. Well, not if you're drinking, anyways.

The black kleptomaniacal 'fairy' godmother (played to the hilt by Sy Richardson), the naive and *very* blonde Cinderella (played by the late Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith), and the comically stoic Lord Chamberlain (Kirk Scott) all make this film a hoot.

And the two songs...the driving disco duet between Cinderella and her Fairy Godmother ""Stick it to the Man"", and the hilarious angst-filled song sung by the bored, oversexed Prince ""My Kingdom Won't Come"" also help to not only make this movie worth seeing (at least for folks who like campy movies and can stand the terrible and completely unappealing sex scenes), but worth buying on DVD as well.",1327190400,17,877,5.118881118881119
