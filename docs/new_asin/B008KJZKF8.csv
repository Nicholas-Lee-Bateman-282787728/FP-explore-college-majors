8528668,5,B008KJZKF8,"Some will complain that it is only 52 minutes long, or that the notes on the cover say that Marina Mahler-Fistullari is Mahlers daughter, when she is really his granddaughter, her mother being Anna Mahler, Mahlers daughter.

But the 52 minutes are packed with information and the homes and scenery that were so much a part of Mahlers life.  Also, Mahlers granddaughter, Marina, shows us the album or scrapbook of her grandmother Alma, who spent nine years married to Gustav.  Both the pictures and Marina's comments are delightful to anyone who loves the beauty and spiritualism of Mahlers music.

But the best feature of this look at Mahlers world and his music is that much of the tour is led by Henry-Louis de la Grange, the scholar who has dedicated his life to the study of Mahler.  (Like many who have come to love Mahler, Henry-Louis remembers that for him, it was on December 22, 1945, at a Carnegie Hall performance of Mahler's 9th symphony, conducted by Bruno Walter.)

Who could imagine an almost personal tour of Mahlers world, led by Henry-Louis!  We see Jihlava (Iglau in Mahlers time), where the young Mahler heard military band music from army barracks on one side of town, and a soldiers training camp on the othersomething that influenced the many marches that appear in his symphonies.  Henry-Louis leads us through the splendor of the Vienna Court Opera, where we see Rodins famous bust of Mahler and the concert hall where Mahler let audiences hear music as it had never been heard before.

For me, and perhaps for all who love Mahlers music, an unexpected treat was when Henry-Louis takes us for a walk in Dobbiaco (Toblach in Mahlers time), for a hike along the trails that Mahler used to enjoy for his long spirit-renewing walks with Nature.

Finally, Henry-Louis takes us to Mahlers unpretentious grave, where he repeats something he has said often, which strikes a chord with all who have been moved by Mahlers music:  that Mahler has taught us there exists something above and beyond the human.  How often Mahlerians feel this at the end of Symphony 3 or other Mahler works which leave us asking, how could a human have created this?",1425340800,4,2160,4.776881720430108
8528669,5,B008KJZKF8,"We see the hut near Vienna where he composed the songs that appear in his early symphonies, always accompanied with singing birds, followed by later symphonies from the fifth to the tenth (unfinished) and Das Lied Von Der Erde.  Mahler was a visionary composer whose work foreshadowed 20th Century Modernism.
We see his manuscripts and the houses where he lived. The In the Footsteps series also includes Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, Beethoven, Vivaldi, Bizet, Puccini, Berlioz, Offenbach and Liszt.",1388448000,4,498,5.384615384615385
8528670,5,B008KJZKF8,"There have been lots of Mahler docs.  This is not the slickest nor does it have as polished production values as some of the others.  However, despite the plethora of other fine Mahler films, they still found some new ground to cover and I found this film thoroughly enjoying.  Some of the highlights for me were of the great Mahler scholar Henry-Louis de La Grange, taking us to many of pivotal locations that played a huge part in Mahler's life as well as sharing with us some of his Mahler artifacts such as Mahler last baton, which was given to him by Mahler's widow Mahler.  Also interesting was the interview with Mahler's granddaughter who leafs through an old and dilapidated family album of priceless photos of Mahler during his summer composing months with his family.  Great film.
Note:  As has been noted by other reviewers the box incorrectly describes Marina as Mahler's daughter.  I don't see why that's such a big deal and I hope that won't keep any Mahler fans from enjoying this fine film.",1356393600,10,1007,4.6875
8528671,5,B008KJZKF8,"The annotation refers to Marina as Mahler's daughter. Marina is, in fact, the grand daughter of Mahler. She is the
child of Anna Mahler and the conductor Anatole Fistuolari.",1345248000,5,173,5.0
8528672,3,B008KJZKF8,Why does the description describe the producer as Mahler's daughter? Mahler had no daughter named Marina. His eldest daughter died at age five in 1907. His second daughter Anna died in the late 1980s.,1343520000,5,200,4.911764705882353
