3527021,5,B001D7T6EK,The Nuttiest Nutcracker lives up to its namesake as my boys absolutely loved watching it from day one.  It made them laugh hysterically and they still do each time they watch it.  The Snowman was not as big a hit for them as it was for mom.  It's a classic.  Great DVD for families young and old.,1263772800,16,296,4.140350877192983

8292211,5,B001D7T6EK,"The story of the Snowman is so endearing - no words, just beautifully illustrated animation.  Young & Old will enjoy this classic immensely.  I first saw it when my son was quite young, as he was born in 1985, ever since, I have given it as a gift to new parents.",1388707200,,263,4.137254901960785

8292214,5,B001D7T6EK,"This two disc set is as the description claims. I absolutely love The Snowman! I grew up watching this on t.v every winter and was happy to find this classic on dvd. If your not familiar with The Snowman you should see it. It's a cult classic. The movie has no dialogue, just a beautiful score to bring this stylized hand drawn animation to life. The Nuttiest Nutcracker I couldn't watch all the way through. This movie was made when computer animation was in its infancy. The animation is strange to watch in comparison to modern computer animation. The graphic dimensions are off and it just looks odd. Reminds me of the graphics on the first Playstation video games. Now this could be a matter of personal taste, but for the price at least you get two movies that kids will enjoy!",1355270400,3,783,4.52112676056338
