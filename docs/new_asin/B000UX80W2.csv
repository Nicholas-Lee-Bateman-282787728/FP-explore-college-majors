8215467,5,B000UX80W2,"This is one of the greatest DVDs ever. Celtic punk, spikey hair, and kilts. How can you go wrong with this? Recorded live from Lanigan's. The music is fabulous, their stage presence is awesome. Its a keeper. I had a copy before, but some hooligan stole it, and I had a very hard time finding another copy. Finally Amazon offered it and yea...I snapped it up because it really is that good.",1412208000,,389,4.416666666666667
