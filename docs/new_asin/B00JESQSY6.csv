6356224,4,B00JESQSY6,"A nice simple story line set against the dance world in  San Francisco in 1985, at the onset of the AIDS epidemic.
A young aspiring dancer, not yet out to his parents, experiences anguish about how to act and what to do since there were so many unanswered questions regarding the HIV virus. Very naturalistic acting, good photography and lovely dance sequences lighten the dour mood considerably. I would recommend this film to serious movie goers, both young and old.",1403481600,2,468,4.85
6356225,4,B00JESQSY6,"""Test"" is one of those films that are different things to different people. I have seen reviews that lament that there is too little dancing; but from my perspective there could have been less dancing since I was not viewing the film to observe or learn anything more or new about ballet.

""Test"" is (for those of us who lived through this era) a nostalgic look at that early time when so little was known about AIDS & HIV ... the mystery of it all ... what was true & what was not true about the things you heard from friends, family & strangers ... the personal questions you asked yourself .... the fear of discrimination & persecution (whether any of it applied to you or not) ... the dilemmas & decisions of daily life.

""Test"" takes place during 1985 ... the year the HIV test became available. For people who are too young to remember, ""Test"" is a history lesson; and for those who once held beliefs or opinions that were not founded in truth, ""Test"" is a cautionary tale about jumping to conclusions.""Test"" is not your typical film about the early times of AIDS / HIV. It does not depict the sick & dying. What it is does depict is the uncertainty of who may be sick or dying.

None of the actors in this film are well known; and yet they all do a very credible job. This movie is very believable because it does its job so well. ""Test"" does not feel cheap, even though the credits include a ""thank you"" to all contributors to the Kickstarter campaign that made the film possible. ""Test"" is above all a great tribute to those who had a message to send and, perhaps, memories to explore.

The only mild criticism of the film is for the last few minutes of it which can almost be viewed as an infomercial for safe sex. However, even that is well done because it does depict so well the heavy decisions that had to be made back then ... the pros and cons of using condoms ... the trade-offs required to remain among the healthy ... the prospect of monogamy among a generation of gay men who equated freedom with promiscuity.

""Test"" is definitely worth 90 minutes of your time. I recommend it. It may not be a film you need to own ... or even a film you need to wait to see on a big screen near you. ""Test"" was made available for rent or purchase to Amazon and other online rental sites the same day it was released in big city theaters. Check it out.",1403481600,28,2356,4.285393258426966

6356228,3,B00JESQSY6,"That the early days of the discovery and spread of HIV/AIDS, was a very scary, bleak time indeed. Straights and especially gays were beside themselves with anxiety and fear and surrounded by misinformation, new information, new tests, new drugs, et al...it is very hard to believe that ANYONE survived all that. Moreover, history shows and continues to show that thousands did not and are not surviving--it isn't really over. The disease(s) and the virus that causes it, is still a palpable threat to the global community. This film brings all of that early climate of uncertainty to life again and is a reminder that HIV/AIDS lives. Although, I'm not sure the film adds much more than that. The actors are cute, talented and the direction is good. I like the pace of the film a lot and the attention to detail is rich indeed. I am a fan of modern and classical dance and so the context and backdrop for the film managed to enhance my appreciation for the sheer effort dancers exert and the physical pain they endure to make it all look so effortless, artful and beautiful. Was the fright of AIDS more of a threat and more anxious for those in the dance world in San Francisco than say the Hamburger Mary's in San Diego, maybe, but in the end the disease was and is no respecter of persons or place and as it turns out, of sexual orientation either. So that's why I have a mixed feeling about the added value of this story and why it needed to be told. The film 'Longtime Companion' is perhaps the benchmark of this genre of film and time period of the disease as well as the book and film chronicle 'And the Band Played On.'",1403222400,2,1625,4.474747474747475
6356229,4,B00JESQSY6,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: Touted as ""Queer Cinema"", yes, Test is ""very gay,"" as expected, but an important semi-documentary style, talk with its community.

Story goes...Frankie (Scott Marlowe) is a young dancer in San Francisco mid the 1980s. The openness he has been able to enjoy in this accepting city is about to change. Test takes us to the months during the start of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. The illness is everywhere, and no one yet, knows how or why it's happening. Anger, distrust, fear and ostracizing is raring its mob-mentality head.

Frankie is scared. He checks his body frequently for tell-tale sores, he stops short before street posters of ""helpful"" AIDS alert/look for posters, and spray painted hate messages springing up on discarded mattresses directed towards gays.

Frankie quietly, privately, reacts. With a new lover he tries to introduce a condom in the bedroom, ""They say we should use these antiquated things."" At work he falls in with a promiscuous mentor; but he stands confused.

Test tells its story of one young man living in the middle of a sexual revolution that was banging on the door like a frothing drunk in a wife beater at 2 a.m. Who was sick, who wasn't. What causes this...there's a new test did you hear? They say it confidential. But, they'll surely expose you, and list your name somewhere. ""Hi mom and dad, I am gay and I am dying"". That one line may have you pausing the film to catch your breath.

However, the acting wavers back and forth. Some words are delivered with a realism that hits the heart with its intended piercing effect Other whole scenes and sentences play out tinfoil-ish, and land with a emotionless thud.

Thankfully, between the pendulum of acting chops and scraps, are remarkable dance sequences that seem to paradoxically tell these men's stories; the beauty they create in their dances each night, as an illness threatens those same graceful beings each day - off stage in reality. And, you can thank choreographer, Sidra Bell, and composer Ceiri Torjussen for these stunning modern dance (of the 80s style) interludes.

Test is a reminder of why safe-sex is not just a phrase, but a way of life today for every sexual being. But, while this is a great film to watch with a new lover (gay readers) to help cement your safe-sex stand, Test is in no way a teaching moment for children or young adults. There is too much mental and physical adult content and its subject matter has no sugar coating applied: Test is talking frankly to an adult audience at all times.

The men before you are all stunningly beautiful; cast-wise. This reviewer just wishes there was a tad more acting skill, and stronger edit choices, behind the brawn. Yet, to be perfectly blunt, if you enjoy dance, drama, and queer cinema, yes, this should be seen. It is not an easy watch emotionally. Test can be heartbreaking while visually stunning. You watch, all these years later, knowing what AIDS is and how it is spread, and what all these men (and women) are about to confront. You may have even lost many beloved friends to it. That thought is ever present as you view and hold your breath as the plot slowly reveals itself.",1402876800,4,3210,4.729874776386405
6356230,5,B00JESQSY6,"Low budget did not show on this well acted production about dancers and the AIDS epidemic during the early 80s.  The main characters were as professional as any and the photography and directing all made this well worth watching.  It brought back memories of what was going on during that scary time, when so many kids did not know and were afraid to even get the test.  Had I been a little younger and actually good at sex, I may have had a harder time with it.  So many kids, especially in San Francisco were living in fear as so little was being done, and people were shunning them because we knew so little.  Loosing someone to AIDS just brings this message home and I felt for them then as I do now, although  it is no longer a death sentence as it was back in 1985.  I think the movie tried not to be too cliche, although it is sometimes hard to accomplish.  The Dancing was wonderful, and the music very appropriate to the scenes.  I really loved this movie, it moves a little slow but it delivers the message, even the sex was necessary.  Highly recommended 5.0 stars 06122014",1402531200,21,1084,4.348258706467662
6356231,5,B00JESQSY6,"This film was a long time a-coming, especially due to the need to raise funds for its production; that cannot have been an easy matter, for this is both dance and cinema, each of which has its respective expenses to cover. Anyway, the result is a triumph. This is one of Wolfe's videos or films that really works as cinema, not ""feeling"" like slightly glorified television. ""The Test"" (Wolfe WOL-5203-D) is an intimate film, to be sure, but it is not cramped and airless in the manner of so much TV.

The choreography (by the illustrious Sidra Bell, if I read the credits aright), which the dancers of the film's small San Francisco modern dance company are seen rehearsing and performing at various times during its preparation and theatrical run, is superb, resulting in a showcase that displays really fine modern dance choreography and dancing at their best. Some of the dancers are better than others, but all function at a satisfyingly professional level or at more than that. The work danced is brief but very absorbing, feeling neither too short nor too extended, eminently well suited to its place in the movie. Most of the dancers are male, and it is they who hold the stage and the viewer's attention for most of the work, but there are some women among them, too.

There are no real costumes, as such, for the cast. (If the location were 21st century Montr&eacute;al, instead of 1980s San Francisco, the dancers probably would appear nude in such an abstract work.) The lighting suffices for background and foreground, illuminating men with good-looking bodies, some of whom, like the main character, Frankie (Scott Marlowe's role), are exceptionally handsome, Marlowe himself being so in a leanly muscled, lithe, boyish way, having a dancer's ideal physique, if there can be said to be such. They dance shirtless and in full length, snugly-fitting pants (rather than in skin-tight leotards). Moments of the choreography, as depicted in rehearsal and in various performances, interweave throughout the movie, while a bonus feature presents, very welcomely, the entire choreography uninterrupted.

Frankie, Scott Marlowe's role, is an understudy who triumphs when it comes time for him to appear in the dance production. That is one sense in which he passes a professional ""test"". What gives ""The Test"" its title, however, are the HIV tests which he and two other of the film's characters take. The two dancers among them, after tense waiting, learn that they are ""HIV negative"". Alas, one of the men (the one of the three who is not a professional dancer), with whom Frankie already has fornicated homosexually, finds out that he has tested negative, only adding, of course, to the main character's edginess. While there is tension surrounding the condition, at a time (1985) where there still was so much uncertainty regarding so much of what HIV-AIDS is and what causes it (not even mention to mention the lack of a cure, or, for that matter, even of palliative prescription treatment at that time), this film, for a refreshing change, does not go into high weeping gear or quasi-tragic antics in the face of all of that, as so many other gay films do so! Thus, Marlowe's character passes the test regarding health as successfully as he fares in his feat of professional attainment.

This film is a triumph over all the adversities and obstacles that there had been to finance and to film it. I had waited impatiently for its appearance, now in 2014, and the project is a complete success!",1402358400,21,3503,4.902192242833053

6356250,5,B00JESQSY6,"An excellent portrayal of the early impact of HIV/AIDS on the American dance community.  In the mid 1980s in San Francisco, CA -- the setting of this film, the gay lifestyle was condemned and dismissed as a perversion in almost every quarter of American society.  A growing and expanding angst among gay men mostly -- a feeling of deep anxiety, dread, foreboding, even terror -- concerning HIV/AIDS is palpable throughout the film, as I believe the screen writers wanted portrayed and the film director accomplished in a masterful piece of direction:  not too much but just enough to give the viewer a taste of that angst of the time without sinking into despair.  Frankie, the film's central character portrayed by Scott Marlowe (currently associate director of LEVYdance in San Francisco), is a young gay man and an extraordinarily talented and dedicated dancer who only seeks to embrace and express the ""joie de vivre"" through dance.  Had he and so many, many other gay men and women in the arts at that time accepted the reality of the deadly danger stalking them daily in their lifestyle choices, I believe that most would have made safer, healthier, better informed choices in their interpersonal relationships and actions outside the dance.

The dance sequences in this film are absolutely superb, the choreography brilliant!  Having spent nine years in classical ballet and modern dance and 38 years total in the performing arts, I can attest to the extraordinarily high level of artistic skill and integrity of Scott Marlowe and the other dancers that abundantly flows from them in this film.  Their artistry as dancers-performers is second to none!  Bravo!  My arts background, training, and professional experience in the performing arts do not cover the theatrical arts.  However, I can say with confidence that the acting skills of Marlowe and his fellow dancers are more than adequate in carrying the storyline.

It is tragic that HIV/AIDS has wreaked havoc, extreme heartache, and much death in the arts in general and in the dance particularly.  While I cannot agree with the promiscuity dimension of the homosexual lifestyle among certain male dancers in the film -- which is portrayed tastefully and with restraint, kudos to the director and the actors for that -- as well as their use of drugs -- also tastefully done with restraint...kudos again, such was the environment of that period that enabled HIV/AIDS spread in the arts community.  Already in my 30s during the time period of this movie, I myself had already lost to death more than a few friends, acquaintances, teachers, and mentors in the dance and the other performing arts to this horrific scourge.  Some said that ""they"" brought it on themselves, that ""they"" deserved what ""they"" got.  I disagree very, very strongly with that indictment, with that judgment.  Compassion, not condemnation, was and is what was and is needed, what was and is right, proper, and just where sickness, debilitation, and death from HIV/AIDS is concerned.

TEST is an fine film tastefully and expertly written, directed, and performed by a group of excellent artists-dancers-performers and filmmakers.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the dance, the theater, filmmaking, and storytelling.  The motto of America's National Endowment for the Arts says: ""A great nation deserves great art.""  In this film, we have precisely that: great art delivered by great artists.  In this film, America has the great art is deserves.",1411689600,6,3497,5.087565674255692
6356251,5,B00JESQSY6,"The level of expertise needed for these performances meant the director--a former dancer, himself--only hired real dancers for the roles; there are no doubles. And you'd be hard-pressed to find a film with better choreography in this genre; this is not classical ballet. The dedication that went into everything is palpable, and after renting I bought it immediately. I'd also put it in the category of ""smart"" film--there are points you'll miss if you're not paying attention, character and plot developments are driven as much by metaphor as conversation, probably even moreso. The cinematography is mesmerizing, I found the dialect appropriate but not overpowering, and the dancing, the dancing...

6356261,4,B00JESQSY6,"Set in 1985 `The Test' is a film about a modern dance troop set in San Francisco's gay community. The main player is Frankie played in his first big screen role by Scott Marlowe - he is the understudy and is very keen to get a big break. We also have Todd (Mathew Risch -`Sex and the City 2') who admits to being a bit of a `sleep around' and has also `done it' for cash. This is set against the backdrop of the ever burgeoning Aids crisis and the ignorance that helped it to spread.

The new blood test has just been developed to test for the virus and much of the story is devoted to what that will actually mean. There is some character development and all of the acting is solid. The best parts though are the dance sequences. These were choreographed by Sidra Bell - and there is more to see in the extras. There are some bedroom scenes but all this side of tame.

The real problem here is that this type of film has been done so many times before when it comes to HIV etc- the best being `Don't ever wipe tears without gloves' (in my opinion). Also there is not a lot of plot on display - as I said the dance sequences are what pulls this one back and for that alone it gets the four stars.",1407628800,,1196,4.063559322033898

It's all about sex; and 2. These gay men have no emotions - they are one dimensional twinks.

8650338,5,B00JESQSY6,"Test is a beautiful, thoughtful, honest film, well-written and acted. It provides a much-needed glimpse into the not-so-distant past--an eye-opening ""history lesson"" via narrative, as one reviewer wrote above me--and it a treats that history with the appropriate nuance and complexity. Some, like me, will be horrified at how gay men were (and still are) treated by society. There are a lot of little things to pick up on in this movie if you pay close attention. Above all, the dancing is absolutely mesmerizing, breathtaking visually and a joy to watch, and the choreography seemingly mirrors/explores the same issues that the plot lays out. 5 stars.",1473724800,,652,5.160377358490566

8650342,5,B00JESQSY6,"Mesmerizing and eerie, Test shows AIDS paranoia of the mid 80 ties looming over and disturbing the lives of young dancers, but without too much melodrama already seen everywhere else. Yes, plot wise not much happens in this movie, but outstanding choreography, brilliantly performed dance sequences, ethereal, charismatic and so real Scott Marlowe as main character Frankie all entwine to create an absolute delight worth watching not only once.",1444867200,,445,5.463768115942029
