8529799,5,B001333082,"This film begins with a history of the F-101 development from the XF-88 of the late forties, continues with the testing of the F-101A and F-101C, and leads into the development of the F-101B and RF-101C.  There is a good walkaround and preflight of the RF-101, which could be especially useful to modellers wishing to capture images for modelling projects. And finally there is a segment on ""how to fly it the right way"", which seems to have been geared for pilots transitioning into the airplane.
  The film quality is quite good compared to some of the other film shot around the same time frame; I think it's more common than not for a lot of the master film from the late 50's and 60's to be in need of restoration before being transfered to a digital format. This one is good.
  I would have liked to have seen some additional film added showing the Voodoo in operation with the U.S., Canada, and most especially with the Taiwanese, but the most recent of the film seems to have been shot by the manufacturer in the early 60's. In spite of this shortcoming, it fills an important gap.  With 807 aircraft of all variants produced, there is an amazing shortage of information out there about this historically important airplane. The curse of the jack-of-all-trades, master of none, the F-4, strikes again.",1240185600,3,1309,4.6695652173913045
