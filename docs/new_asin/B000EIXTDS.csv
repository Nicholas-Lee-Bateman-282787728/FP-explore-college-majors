8110662,4,B000EIXTDS,"This is a good thriller from Australia, but some clarifications are called for.

1) This is a 1982 movie starring Diana McLean; it is NOT the 1985 movie starring Aidan Quinn.
2) The front of the DVD package mentions ""Darren"" McLean -- a misprint.
3) The quality of the print can most charitably be described as ""fair.""
4) As Amazon makes clear, this is a Region 4 DVD, and requires an all-region player.

Despite all of the above, I'm glad I bought it (as of this writing, I seem to have acquired the last available copy). Diana McLean is beautiful and talented, and she skillfully portrays an unsympathetic character. The suspense builds to a surprising conclusion.

This is such an interesting and little-known movie that I'm glad I finally tracked it down.",1517616000,,759,4.734848484848484
