2012671,5,B0001LJCUW,"We really enjoyed the 'Frost' series from many years ago, so it was a treat to watch them again with this DVD! This series is filled with a wonderful, complex, and earthy protagonist, and supported by a cast of great actors. The drama, humor, and relevant themes are woven into each episode in such a manner that the viewer is drawn in from the first scene.",1438646400,,357,4.424242424242424

2012687,5,B0001LJCUW,Frost is by far my favorite detective ever - with Morse a close second - darn shame they won't be making anymore episodes but at least we can enjoy these forever.,1426204800,,162,4.258064516129032
2012688,5,B0001LJCUW,"I love this series.  David Jason is fantastic as Chief Inspector Jack Frost.  He is superb as he winds his way through the solving of various crimes ranging from petty theft to murder.  Frost has a real talent for expressing a wide variety of emotions, such as sadness, happiness, and anger!  He is at time a true romantic, and at other times he is quiet, brooding, or  colorfully funny.  The story lines are always very interesting and never fail to grab (and hold) your interest!  Don't miss out on this brilliant series.  It is one of the finest British series out now.",1425340800,,572,4.53921568627451

2012691,5,B0001LJCUW,"The British made a great show here. Jack Frost is a crusty  curmudgeon, like myself, which is maybe why I like him so much. I like his attitude towards the rest of humanity. He does not suffer fools and since there are plenty to go around,  he has ample opportunity to poke them with his sarcasm. And since there were many seasons, there must have been a great number of fellow curmudgeons to have made this show profitable.",1419552000,,424,4.423076923076923

2012704,5,B0001LJCUW,"This is one of the very best series I have ever enjoyed.  David Jason is impeccable as Jack Frost, a seasoned detective.  The amazing part of the film is the tremendous depth of character displayed by Jack Frost.  Frost deals in the very real world of ignorance, greed, and political power mongering with a depth of wisdom which is seldom shown in TV or Movie drama.  If you are tired of the shallow and stupid characters often displayed in the entertainment industry this is a refreshing change.",1416355200,,496,4.666666666666667
2012705,5,B0001LJCUW,"Oh what can we say about Inspector Frost !  We love this show so much.  In other reviews we have expressed how much we dislike current TV shows (mostly realty shows) and how much we appreciate the British Mysteries.  We pretty much like most of the British Mystery Shows but Frost is just so fantastic it is pretty much number one on our list.  David Jason is so perfect in this show (and we remember him from Open All Hours and so many other great shows) and he is perfect in this drama with a touch of the humor he is known for.  We can't say enough about these shows.  Cast is perfect, stories are interesting.  If you have not watched Frost don't hesitate to.",1415145600,,663,4.256

2012709,5,B0001LJCUW,"If you are a fan of British TV and movies this series is for you.  Frost is the prototypical edgy, aging cop with a sloppy desk, rumpled suits and a spot-on mind for catching the bad guys.  A great mix of drama, laughs and pathos all mixed up in a guy you might see every morning getting his paper off the driveway, assuming he remembers to get it at all.

I'm hooked.",1406505600,,368,4.083333333333333

2012724,5,B0001LJCUW,"When David Jason is the lead in a TV series you can only expect the best and you always get it.
Even though this series is author backed, well scripted and well directed its a David Jason show all the way.
He creates a real, decent, likeable hero who is imperfect, annoying, caring and determined. Whether he's mooching off other people's cups of tea, spilling mayonnaise on antique carpets, rubbing royalty the wrong way and standing up his girlfriend at the train station his foibles are forgiven for his real interest in getting the helpless justice.
The plots are well thought out and do not depend on graphic images or vicarious writing- a standard in many Tv shows today.
Cant think up an imaginative story cram the viewers brain with mangled corpses and gory details.",1402358400,,774,4.7407407407407405

2012730,5,B0001LJCUW,"This series is one of the best from UK.  I love all of them. Only thing that bothers me, I get hungry when I see him eating the English bacon sandwiches and fish and chips !!!! I don't mind.  Story lines are always excellent, some humor too, and David Jason has proved to everyone he's not only a top class comedian but a first rate drama actor too.",1370736000,,349,4.117647058823529
2012731,5,B0001LJCUW,"I enjoyed the first and third season and i knew i would be just as happy with season 2 , it has one of my all time favorite episodes "" stranger in the house "", to be quite frank  was very disturbing , and also the episode where  the weirdo goes around attacking elderly women. I enjoyed it immensely, and thanks for the fast delivery, an added bonus!",1366502400,,350,4.132352941176471
2012732,5,B0001LJCUW,I love all the Frost series - the stories are all unique and interesting.  The subtitles are a great help because the English words and accent are hard to understand.,1363737600,,166,4.533333333333333
2012733,5,B0001LJCUW,The ratings I assign to a movie are based on environment.  Another person might have a different opinion.  Thats why there is freedom of choice.,1361836800,,144,4.72
2012734,4,B0001LJCUW,"Being an appreciator (new word, I just invented it) of Brit comedy and drama and especially their costume dramas, Inspector Frost is the clapper that strikes my bell.  Just as good as Morse and Lewis I think, but more gritty, as he usually deals with the more common folk than they do.  Jason's Darling Buds of May hits it out of the park.  As I think he also does as Frost.  He hates the bureaucratic paper shuffling aspects of his job and avoids it whenever he can and in the process is more successful than his comrades.  Good show and strongly recommended.",1359849600,,560,4.450980392156863
2012735,5,B0001LJCUW,"If you like British detective fare, you will delight in Frost.  Once he gets his teeth into something, he sticks with it to the conclusion.",1359590400,,139,4.56

2012737,5,B0001LJCUW,I LOVE THE WHOLE FROST SERIES AND I OWN THEM. I JUST PURCHASED ALL THE BOOKS TOO. THE BOOKS ARE GOOD AS WELL BUT NOT AS GOOD AS SEEING DAVID JASON AS FROST. THE BOOKS MAKE HIM SEEM A LITTLE OFF BUT IT'S OK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES IF YOU ARE INTO THESE KINDS OF SHOWS!,1356566400,,275,3.8421052631578947
2012738,5,B0001LJCUW,Good detective - with personality and quirkiness. Also good supporting cast with a boss to keep on edge. Good plots.,1348185600,,116,4.85
2012739,5,B0001LJCUW,"Over the last few years my wife and I have gotten more and more into the procession of excellent British mystery series.  ""A Touch of Frost"" is right up among the best, in a race where all entries are very good to great.  For us, the one that can't be beat is ""Foyle's War"", followed closely by ""Cadfael"" and maybe P.D. James' ""An Unsuitable Job for a Woman"".  Then ""...Frost"", ""Inspector Lewis"", ""Pie in the Sky"", and the various P.D. James ""Adam Dalgliesh"" productions duke it out in a tight tie.  All the latter are excellent, combining engaging mysteries with humanity and a leavening of humor (well not much humor in ""Adam"").  Next down but still very good would be the ""Inspector Alleyn"" series followed by the various ""Lord Peter Whimsey"" productions and then ""Inspector Morse"".  We've only watched one ""Midsommer Murders"" but those look promising.  We tried ""Prime Suspect"" but my wife stopped after half of the first episode, finding it too dark and cynical.  All in all, ""A Touch of Frost"" holds its own quite well among the most entertaining of mystery series.",1348099200,,1071,4.751351351351351
2012740,5,B0001LJCUW,"I watched most of the episodes when they were aired by my local PBS station and found them much to my liking.  I wish I could afford the entire series on DVD but there are simply too many.  Season 2 was an improvement over the first season and there are many more excellent ones that I have seen; however, there are surely some that I missed when aired on TV that are equally enjoyable.  I'll continue collecting them as time goes by (I keep them on my Christmas Wish List for those who may be kind enough to get me something that I'm certain to like).  Maybe I'll get them all eventually.",1345334400,,589,4.232142857142857
2012741,5,B0001LJCUW,"Season 2 is entertaining as always as Frost goes about solving crimes at his usual, deliberate pace.  Outwardly curt but inwardly compassionate, he avoids and pokes fun at bureaucracy, while empathizing with the victims of crime.  His sense of justice outweighs his desire for political correctness, sometimes getting him into trouble with his superiors.  Story lines are sometimes predictable, but entertaining all the while.  Love the interaction between the characters and - I'll admit it - I just like hearing them talk.",1344643200,,524,5.353658536585366
2012742,5,B0001LJCUW,"If you like Midsomer Murders, Inspector Morse, George Gently, then you should like Frost. Starting on serie 9 and haven't seen a bad episode yet.",1341360000,,145,4.84
2012743,5,B0001LJCUW,YOU CAN NEVER BEAT AN ENGLISH MYSTERY.  NO EXTRA BLOOD OR GORE JUST INTELLIGENT STORY TELLING.  INSPECTOR FROST IS A GEM. IF YOU CAN GET THE ENTIRE SERIES WELL WORTH THE MONEY.,1311033600,4,176,4.46875
2012744,5,B0001LJCUW,"What can you say, there is nothing better than sitting down with your wife to watch A Touch of Frost.  Except maybe owning the entire series - almost there!  A definite required purchase if you like any of the Brits drama/suspense/cop shows.",1266192000,3,241,4.714285714285714
2012745,5,B0001LJCUW,"I really found these reviews very helpful in buying the complete set of Touch of Frost
It is a very good British crime drama
one needs to research different times for what is available for sale. I did this and have gotten the full 14 complete sets
always a few laugh's with Jack Frost (David Jason) and his boss!
But Jack gets the crime solved by the end of the movie

No cursing and he does't smoke but eats, this tends to make the movies better for us.

2012747,5,B0001LJCUW,"I have Netflix to thank for learning that the ""Touch of Frost"" series is one of the best, if not the best, British crime series out there.  In fact, I would rate it as one of the best crime series period.

A great deal of that is due to the brilliant acting of David Jason.  His portrayal of Detective Inspector Jack Frost is extraordinarily well done.  Unlike a lot of other detectives in other series, Frost comes across as ""real,"" that if I ever was the victim of a crime in England, I would not be surprised if someone like him would investigate the crime (or at least I'd hope that someone like him was handling my case).  Frost is such a great character...gruff, sarcastic, shrewd but very compassionate and human.  I have the complete series in my DVD collection, and it's entertainment that I will be watching again and again in the years to come.

Of this particular season, the stand-out is ""A Stranger in the House.""  A serial rapist has been attacking women in their homes.  Frost has been unable to catch him.  Superintendent Mullet is breathing down his neck to catch this shadowy figure.  It's an enormously compelling story, and I think it brings home to anyone how devastating being raped is to a woman.  Some of the best scenes in the episode are the ones where Frost interacts with the victims, treating them with kindness and empathy.

So I would highly, highly recommend this DVD set and the series as a whole.  You won't be disappointed; it's just great drama.",1219536000,3,1482,4.5643939393939394
2012748,5,B0001LJCUW,"My wife bought me Frost Series 1 for Christmas. We enjoyed it immensely.
So we recently bought Series 2 & 3.

2012749,5,B0001LJCUW,"DCI Frost is the most lovable character you can possibly have. Careless about his personal life, disorganized in his methods, disobedient to authority. But there's another side to this man. That side shows up when his friend George is injured in this episode. His meticulous attention to detail where a case is involved has many around him wondering how he does it so effortlessly. When I had first started watching this series, I found myself occasionally nodding off due to the slow pace of everything... the title music, the scenes, the dialogue... everything is unhurried and relaxed. It is only after I had watched 2-3 episodes that I began appreciating this series- it grows on you.",1195084800,11,688,4.939655172413793

Frost:  Used to watch Frost on the Tele.  Being able to get all of the seasons through Amazon is dynamite.  DCI Frost manages to keep about 5 balls in the air every episode, so you better pay attention at the start.  Good acting, good plots, good camera work.  Perhaps some of the ""cops and robbers"" producers in the U.S. should take a lesson.... cut the fluff and the computer generated geewhiz stuff and get back to real life - like Frost.  However, I just cannot stand Hornrim Harry... never have, never will.",1170720000,8,602,4.613207547169812
