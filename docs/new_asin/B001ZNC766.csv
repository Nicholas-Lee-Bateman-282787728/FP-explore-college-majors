8348340,4,B001ZNC766,"The footage of the Titanic wreck- both inside and out- is fascinating and superb.  If, like me, you are intrigued by all things Titanic, this video will keep you glued until the end.  That being said, there were a few things about it that I didn't care for, and that's the reason why I couldn't quite give a 5-star rating for this one.

First, it seems that this film is only available in DVD-R format.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but it looks like the only way it was released.  The video was rather expensive for a DVD, and until I opened the package I was unaware it wasn't a regular commercially-produced DVD.  While mine had no issues during playback, I've had nothing but trouble with many DVD-R recordings.  They might play fine for a while, but a few months down the road and either the disc can no longer be read, or it skips or freezes constantly.

Also, while this could be called a documentary, it was produced a bit differently than most documentaries.  It lacked the professional quality of, say, 'Ghosts of the Abyss', which was an amazing video.  This one had more of a 'home movie' feel to it.  That's not to say that this one isn't worth it, and certainly for footage not available or seen elsewhere this can hardly be beat.

I did find it a bit annoying that so much time was spent showing the people involved in this production.  While listening to them was admittedly  interesting, I didn't purchase this to watch people talk, I purchased it to see the Titanic. Although it did take some time to get to it, the wait was, in the end, worth it.  Overall, a good video for Titanic or shipwreck enthusiasts, even if some parts are a little dull.",1466899200,,1654,4.4485049833887045

8348344,5,B001ZNC766,Pretty good video. Shows you the Turkish Bath underwater for the first time. Shows you what Cameron says about the mysteries of the Titanic. The only thing that is a disappointment is that we don't see Scotland Road. This would be Cameron's last voyage exploring inside the wreck.,1328486400,2,280,4.854166666666667
8348345,5,B001ZNC766,"This DVD of James Cameron's suprisingly less publicized third expedition to the great sunken liner is a must for any serious enthusist. Using a more advanced version of the ""Jake"" and ""Elwood"" remote vehicles from the second expedition, Cameron and his team take up in this documentary where ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" left off, penetrating further into the Titanic's bow section than ever before and giving us a look at rooms inside the ship, such as Isiador and Ida Strauss' cabin, with remarkable preservation of the sitting room's fireplace mantle, including a clock still mounted on top of it, the hands of which can be seen eerily stopped close to the 2:20 AM postion... the time the ship is reported to have sunk.

Another mind-blowing find is the discovery of the Turkish Bath's condition: with colorful blue tiles, gilded metal work ceiling lamps, teak lounge chairs, changing stalls, delicate ornamental woodwork in an absolutely amazing state of preservation after nearly a century at the bottom of the sea! You must see this to believe it!

They also revisit the wireless room, gaining more insights into what Harold Bride and Jack Phillips did that night in their desperate attempts to tweak the wireless gear to keep it working until the very end and summon help, that sadly would not arrive in time.

That is just a taste of what this DVD offers, which has footage not shown previously in it's original Discovery channel airing. So whether you are an Titanic enthusist, or are buying a gift for one, this DVD is highly recommended.",1294790400,9,1541,4.874045801526718
8348346,5,B001ZNC766,This DVD on the Titanic is great. This DVD gives you more information than you might have had before. This DVD shows close-up views via an underwater camera with a motor that gets into areas others couldn't.,1294790400,2,207,4.621621621621622
