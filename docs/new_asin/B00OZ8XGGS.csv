8685715,5,B00OZ8XGGS,"Excellent, very interesting, an eye opener... what is there left to say? Timothy Hutton's and Sean Penn's acting was superb (what else is to be expected?) I highly recommend it. That is, if you are able to withstand seeing moral conscience override unconditional devotion to one's country. If you love your country so much that you are unable to withstand any criticism, then don't see it: most probably you'll be so enraged that you'll pop a vein or something.",1456876800,,461,4.848101265822785
8685716,4,B00OZ8XGGS,I don't care about missing music.  The movie hasn't changed.  It's still good.  I recommend it.,1453593600,,95,4.8125
8685717,1,B00OZ8XGGS,"""The Falcon and The Snowman"" is one of my all time favorite movies. It is a great film, featuring the greatest original soundtrack ever, IMHO, by Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays. So I was very excited to obtain a Blu-Ray copy at a reasonable price when it was just recently made available on Amazon. But this KINO LORBER release is not John Schlesinger's film! Many of the original recordings used in the actual movie (Average White Band's ""Pick Up The Pieces"" for example) do not appear in this altered release. I can only guess that KINO LORBER couldn't/didn't obtain the rights for those records. For whatever reason, this release IS NOT THE SAME FILM! This treatment is completely unacceptable, particularly to a film as great as ""The Falcon and The Snowman"".",1423008000,8,757,4.786259541984733
