8105395,5,B000E3LPU2,"""April 1865"" is a powerful and moving piece about the closing month of the American Civil War.  It persuasively makes the case that good decisions by good men on both sides enabled America to begin to heal after the bloodiest war in American history.  We often forget that after Civil Wars most countries have endured guerrilla war and a bloodbath of retribution.  This film reminds us how this could have happened to America as had happened most times elsewhere in history.  It did not, thanks be to President Lincoln's desire for ""malice towards none..."" and his policy of immediate reconciliation.  US Grant took Lincoln's policy and with no other guidance other than his knowledge that Lincoln wanted to ""Let the South off easy"" Grant crafted surrender terms for Lee that allowed for the process of healing and reconciliation to begin.  This process took root sufficiently that even the assassination of Lincoln by Booth largely did not result in wholesale retribution against the South, as conceivably could have happened. The film also shows us that there were people on both sides who wanted a different outcome: Southerners who advocated guerrilla war and refusal to accept the war's outcome, and Northerners who wanted a harsh and vengeful policy towards the South.  But mostly, wiser heads prevailed making the end of the Civil War a shining example of American exceptionalism.

This is a film that history buffs will watch repeatedly.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1348358400,3,1472,5.095833333333333
