8331178,1,B001OPUWPS,"If you already own the entertaining if a little depressing ""Hey Is Dee Dee Home"" you do not need this.  Why this was repackeged I have no idea as it is the original ""Is Dee Dee Home"" with a lot of garbage footage added that is completely unecessary. Most of the additional footage consists of video that was rolling while the film crew was setting up and checking sound and lights as Dee Dee messes around on the guitar without focus or any structure.  Just wanking.  The audio cd is what peaked my interest but once again for the most part it is Dee Dee just wanking around and is a mess with people talking in the background and a television on with what sounds like a news broadcast.  It really is a mess. but there is one reedeming part where Dee Dee stops playing and goes into the kitchen to cook some eggs and you here him banging around the kitchen while he begins a conversation with his cat!  That is pretty amusing, but the rest is pretty noisy, unfocused and uncessesary.  Go with the original release of DD Home,  get yourself the cool stick on Dee Dee tattoo's and save yourself a few bucks.",1246492800,16,1105,4.334951456310679
