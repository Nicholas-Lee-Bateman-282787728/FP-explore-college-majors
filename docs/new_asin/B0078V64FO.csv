5063393,4,B0078V64FO,This group makes a sincere effort to not B.S. people and genuinely look for evidence.  This isn't finding bigfoot or a sensationalized docudrama.  This gives you a look at honest researchers doing their job with a real passion for the subject not looking to be famous or make money.  And they do get good evidence without the hype.,1369785600,3,331,4.672413793103448
5063394,1,B0078V64FO,"this is the worst I have ever seen!!! Do not rent or buy this!!! Just 1 person walking in the woods filming what he calls foot prints. No team, no crew no Bigfoot nothing! I could have just as well put my money down the toilet...oh, I just did. keep away from this one. waste of time and money.",1357689600,4,294,4.0
5063395,3,B0078V64FO,The only thing deep about this one is the snow you'll see in the footage.  Beautiful scenes but that's about it.  Don't get me wrong...I wasn't expecting to see Bigfoot in a snow condo somehow this one just missed it.,1353369600,,217,4.4
5063396,2,B0078V64FO,"It reminded me of ""The Blair Witch Project"" except it was way more boring, but on the plus side I didn't get motion sickness. I think they might have pulled it off, but the video of the Bigfoot's head behind the grassy knoll was kinda cheesy.  I guess it also reminded me of going on a walk in the woods after a warm snow with some dude that keeps whispering and won't shut up.

I can't in good conscience recommend this video....  well... except the scenery was nice. 2 Stars",1342569600,6,476,4.266666666666667
5063397,1,B0078V64FO,"This is crap.  There's horrible footage of something's Head, no features just a shape that could've been a bear or a person.  It's a waste of 2 bucks.",1329696000,,150,4.321428571428571

5063402,1,B0078V64FO,wow--sorry guys but this is horrible--try moving the camera slower!!!  and by the way get over yourselves if sasquatch did think you were following him/her/it--it wouldn't take evasive action as you so often presume--you are no threat and if it's there it only notices you when it needs a good laugh at how dumb another bi-pedal primate can be---save the legend and go back to the rock you crawled out from under,1403827200,,412,4.722222222222222
5063403,1,B0078V64FO,"This work is shot in good quality video format but it has ZERO production value. There is no story, message or information. It is basically a video of someone walking around in the snow. There is Nothiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig of value in this video. Don't waste your money.",1379808000,3,268,4.8478260869565215

5063406,1,B0078V64FO,"The person that writes the 5 star reviews for the DVDs in the series (Western Tracker) is also the person that is in the DVDs (Andrew Peterson) and produces them. Nice that you rate your projects as 5 Stars and write them as if you are a viewer.

If you want to see aimless wandering in the forest and a showcase for the equipment used, these DVDs are for you. You will not see evidence or anything other than ""Did you hear that? It's a sasquatch"" type of scenes, then this redundant series is for you.",1375401600,3,502,4.229166666666667
5063407,4,B0078V64FO,"If you are interested in the Bigfoot phenomenon, then you will like this video. It not an action based video, it basically documents one groups efforts to capture evidence of Bigfoot.",1373068800,4,183,4.935483870967742

8512388,1,B0078V64FO,The BRC didn't make any appearance in this video . That's how they got me to buy it and by the time I realized that we were duped...I couldn't return...buyer beware...but hey it was 2$..,1517788800,,186,4.3428571428571425
8512389,5,B0078V64FO,I enjoyed it. Thanks for your honest effort to do this film. I've seen many where they aimlessly wonder into the woods and don't find any tracks that look very authentic. You also see the two sas to boot. Could have done better on the audio mix. Couldn't hear you well. Had to turn up the volume when you spoke. All and all you did good.,1517184000,2,337,4.121212121212121

8512392,1,B0078V64FO,"This is Youtube quality. I honestly can't believe this is for sale or rent anywhere. The video quality is poor, it's repetitive, The editing is choppy with words used out of context, the music they inserted is horrid and annoying,  and the only thing that is ""in depth"" is the guys feet in the snow. Not worth my time or $1.99.",1469750400,3,327,4.360655737704918
