7968451,4,B00006GF33,"Look, this video is NOT intended for teenagers or adults.  It is for younger kids who are being introduced to Columbus.  I feel it is perfect for 5 - 11 year olds because they are too young to be told the truth about Columbus and his men.  I've been a history teacher for 17 years (high school 14 years, middle school 3) and I know what is age appropriate! This ACH cartoon is fine for the younger kids.  I show it to my 5th graders and they love it.  Now, when I get them again in 8th grade I will ""burst the bubble"" and enlighten them of the truths, in fact we put Columbus on trial.  But 5th grade and below, NO! They do not need to be told of the rapes, cutting off of limbs, and how Columbus's men (not Columbus) tortured the Tiano's for their pleasure. And I'm not a conservative, I'm a leftie-liberal! You Howard Zinn people would be upset with me but I saved Zinn for 8th and 11th grade.",1350864000,3,895,4.114942528735632
7968452,1,B00006GF33,"If we do not teach children true history they will repeat the same mistakes.  This accounting of the history of Columbus is inaccurate and insulting to scholars and any teacher who has the courage to tell children the truth about many of the lies we have heard all our lives told in the US schools. Columbus was a opportunist and murderer.  He was no hero.  I bought all this series of videos at a garage sale and they for the most part are propaganda, full of misinformation and outrageous lies.  Children deserve better and deserve to be told the truth.  I understand that children need a kinder version of reality, but I refuse to lie to my children to make murdering men righteous and heros.  Don't waste your money on this video.",1346198400,,734,4.5227272727272725
7968453,3,B00006GF33,The animation was okay.  The history account was useful for a history lesson for an older child; I say 8 years and up.,1340668800,3,118,4.130434782608695
