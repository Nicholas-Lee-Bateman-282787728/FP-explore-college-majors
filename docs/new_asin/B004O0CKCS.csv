4436691,3,B004O0CKCS,"This DVD is suitable for senior school children - The acting takes place in a reasonably limited area, and the acting looks as if it was set for a stage.

The story gives a 'palace' view of a usurper taking over a tribe, showing the differences in the 'gifts' offered to the Gods (i.e Flowers vs Human Sacrifices) with of course the schemes usede to entice the locals.

It is more a story on the application of politics and dirty tricks than the history of the aztecs.

It has suffered the ravages of time and research",1276992000,,518,4.375

8436925,5,B004O0CKCS,"Patrick Troughton is a scheming, fanatical Aztec priest in this British TV cult classic. As high priest Nasca, a servant of the bloodthirsty god Teshcata. It has a great surprise ending fitting for the evil priest.",1482192000,,214,4.972222222222222
8436926,5,B004O0CKCS,BRITISH AZTECS.  HARD TO IMAGINE.  I ORDERED THIS MINE-SERIES OUT OF CURIOSITY.  BRITISH ATTEMPT AT A NORTH AMERICAN TRIBE OF ANCIENT INDIANS.  SURPRISINGLY IT IT NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.  IT IS DONE IN THE STYLE OF A PLAY.  INEXPENSIVE SETS.  COSTUMES ARE OK.  STORY NOT TO BAD.  ACTING SO SO.  WOULD I RECOMMEND IT?  YES BECAUSE IT IS AN UNUSUAL ATTEMPT WHITCH WORKS.,1480550400,,381,4.455882352941177
8436927,4,B004O0CKCS,"This British TV series deals with the mythical reign of Kulkakan and his daughter Jimalma, Aztec rulers, the evil Aztec priest Nasca, and Huemac, a Toltec prince vowed to marry Jimalma. The well-acted series has enough intrigue, coups, pagan worship, murder, and the occult to make this worth the watch. Now, I will warn you, the envelop is pushed to the edge in relation to historical facts. The writers also like to let evil run rampant and then wrap it up in a neat and ironic fashion. Still, this forgotten gem is worth the viewing.",1471996800,,536,4.652631578947369
8436928,5,B004O0CKCS,"Wild! Hard to believe this was intended for children, but the more extreme of the adult aspects and subtext - murder, torture, homoeroticism, occult - surely went unnoticed by them. Acting a bit hammy sometimes, but writing, costumes and sets are all very impressive. An intriguing time-capsule curiosity!",1458345600,,305,5.375

8436930,1,B004O0CKCS,I honestly can't say anything good  about it-the filming looked like something out of 50's-the acting was stilted-all around it was a mess and a waste of money,1431216000,,159,4.678571428571429
8436931,4,B004O0CKCS,"This 13 episode tv series from the early 1970's is actually pretty good. It's good in that it's so well preserved too. The brits destroyed many tapes of show from this period so whole series are 'lost' to posterity.
This one was preserved and the tape looks great. the colors look great the picture looks great. This was a show aimed like doctor who at the youth audience and it's a really cool idea. I mean is there even ONE other show about aztecs , in which the main characters are aztecs? and the storyline is about the aztecs during their heyday? Of course this isn't the highest budget affair but brit tv of the era did the best they could. Patrick Troughton is great in this though, he's really a great villian. The actors are british too and caucasion but it doesn't matter because they are playing characters and the whole thing is a story about a really alien culture in comparison to modern ones completely.  In fact you could have people in mexico playing british people from long ago and it wouldn't matter as long as they acted out the characters well. the story is a good one about a evil priest who wants to keep the aztecs worshipping the bloodier gods ,while the emporer wants to go back to the more peaceful gods. The sets are well done for the budget and time this was shot. just enjoy the show and fine acting and don't even think about skin color and you can see the writers of this show really treated the aztecs with some respect here, just like any historical drama. Thank goodness this unusual show was preserved! Personally I would like to see another show featuring the aztecs and their struggles and such. They were an incredible civilization. And like the incas the only reason they fell was because most of the fighting was done by subject peoples who the spanish
promissed freedom too! they lied of course though. The dvd is a two setter and well worth owning for fans of historial fiction. It's of it's era though production wise. If this were made today they'd shoot it on film and use cgi effects and this would be more realistic. ANd probably they'd use mexican actors, but that's not a distraction to a good story. it's not aimed at masterpiece theater though, instead it's a cool show aimed at the young at heart.",1314403200,,2251,4.503667481662592
8436932,3,B004O0CKCS,"Appellate Judge Jim Stewart, DVD Verdict -- ""While I'd hardly call The Feathered Serpent a lost treasure, fans of Patrick Troughton's Doctor Who tenure may enjoy seeing him wandering through the passageways of evil and madness. It's entertaining to watch him as a villain, and it appears that he's enjoying the chance to distance himself from a certain Gallifreyan do-gooder. If you've seen The Pillars of the Earth, you might be reminded of Ian McShane's devious cleric, although McShane had a more substantial serial surrounding his strong performance. Anyone looking for anything remotely like real Aztec history should steer clear of The Feathered Serpent, which bears more resemblance to the outer-space cultures The Doctor visited than to the actual Aztecs and Toltecs.""",1303257600,4,776,5.368852459016393
8436933,4,B004O0CKCS,"A re-release (70s vintage) British TV series originally targeted to youth. The plot revolves around the forced political marriage between prince & empress of 2 tribes, but the bulk of the story is suspense, intrigue, and deception through politics, religious followings, and personal greed. Good rivals evil. Priests of the good god Ouala and the bad god Teshcata each have their political followers and enemies. Who will survive? The struggle lasts through 12 episodes, each about 25 minutes.

This 2-DVD complete series set seems reminiscent of Disney TV archival re-releases from the same and earlier time periods. They must be reviewed as that, not a comparison with today's high-tech film events like Avatar. 1970s alter-human character shows like Battlestar Galatica, Wonder Woman, & The Incredible Hulk for instance followed the sixties Mission Impossible, Star Trek, and Lost in Space. The Feathered Serpent TV show went backward, historically, not forward into time. Now it is revived after 3  decades. Elaborate costumes seem to have been heavily influenced by Anasazi Kachinas. That also happened in Star Wars. Other influences from Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Aztec, and Native American cultures.

All episodes have SUBTITLES available. Series 1 originally aired in 1976, series 2 in 1978.

1-6 A rescue from the chamber of Screams. Will the Pyramid of the Sun see a human sacrifice? Nasca seems to produce a sign from his god Teshcata.

2-5 Tozo needs rescued from Xipec. It is Heumac that makes the attempt, while Chimalma is further deceived by Nasca.
2-6 The final confrontation between good and evil. To one god goes the spoils.

This is fictional drama but based loosely on the Nazca people of Peru. The Mayan god, Kukulcan, was real, and The Feathered Serpent a religious cult. Some connection can also be found in characters with the Mesoamerican cultures of the Toltecs (Central Mexico) and Aztecs. The later defeated the former yet considered them predecessors and claimed the Toltec gods and spiritual rites. One god was Quetzalcoatl (Quala?) or The Feathered Serpent. Tezcatlipoca used black magic to drive Quetzalcoatl to the ocean & human sacrifice began. Cortes arrived in 1519, mistook as a god, and was helped by Aztec Emperor Montezuma II to conquer Central American lands.
More historical background for this series is on disc 2. Look at that prior to viewing the 12 episode complete series. It adds credibility to the story fictional portrayal.",1301616000,10,3848,5.103174603174603
