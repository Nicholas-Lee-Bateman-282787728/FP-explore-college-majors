Too bad that the quality of the film, since it is so old, even though this was in a DVD format, the quality is just superb considering when the film was released.  All in all I got what I bargained for from Amazon.com.  It was what I was expecting to get and I got it fast from them using the FREE prime shipping.",1378339200,,362,3.9315068493150687
