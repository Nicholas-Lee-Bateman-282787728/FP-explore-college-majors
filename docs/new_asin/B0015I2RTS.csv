8313177,5,B0015I2RTS,"This movie is categorized as a drama, but I found myself laughing at many scenes which were supposed to be tragic. The movie starts out with a couple of teen kids in Argentina who get caught making love. The woman, Valentina, is a nymphomaniac. She describes her first lover, Hugo, her bath time ducky with the paint worn off the bill. We later find out she has a passion for the Tango. I mean a real passion as it brings her to orgasm.

Flash forward about 20 years and Valentina and her husband Eduardo own a Tango club in LA and they have two adult male sons, Eddie and Victor. Eddie wants to be a priest and Victor wants to be a crime boss. Eduardo and Valentina dance on stage as Valentina has quiet orgasms in front of the audience. Victor's crime boss wants to buy the Tango club, but Eduardo does not want to sell. Victor acts as the go-between. Victor has two girlfriends. One is a potty mouth named Vicky. She is a passionate Latino version of Mila Kunis. At one point she curses Valentina thinking she was Victor's girlfriend and not his mom. Tina goes out with Victor because she is in love with Eddie. (Go figure.) Once the shooting happens (I won't say who) then the movie turns really weird. At one point Eddie is in Tina's yard and wants to have sex with her. He first prays to God for strength and then on second thought, says, ""Forget that, show me a way out."" At that moment Tina comes to the window and motions Eddie toward the house.

At another point in the movie Eddie dances the Tango with his mom, who has an orgasm. She is so ashamed she runs to the church to pray. Now in all honesty, the movie is set up as a drama, but I couldn't help but laugh as this film takes on a cult classic ""Mommie Dearest"" feel.

Language, brief nudity, and a ton of sexual situations. In fact near the end the film uses sexual situations in a juxtaposition for another ""comedy"" moment.

I loved this film, and perhaps not for the reason why it was made. It might go real good with a buzz. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.",1289001600,,2020,4.280104712041885
8313178,1,B0015I2RTS,"As far as tango is concerned, this is NOT a movie to buy based on the word Tango in the title.  As for the movie itself, we'll let's just say that it is not worth purchasing let alone the time wasted by watching this film.  I am a fan of Argentine Tango, and this movie does not have any worthy tango scenes.",1243382400,,308,3.9516129032258065
8313179,4,B0015I2RTS,"Fascinating tale of love, madness and betrayal set in the world of Los Angeles nightclubs where the tango is the dance. Guillermina Quiriga is a wonderful dancer and the final scenes of the film are not to be missed.",1212883200,3,216,4.564102564102564
