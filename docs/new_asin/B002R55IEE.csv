3971432,2,B002R55IEE,"This is the directors cut with ""Re-mastered video and audio"", but I thought the quality of the video was very grainy, and the sound even in 5.1 does not pack as much of a punch as River Plate.",1333670400,2,192,4.078947368421052
3971433,5,B002R55IEE,"I liked The Director's Cut, the original No Bull dvd was the first concert of the band i ever watched on screen so I didn't appreciated The Director's Cut that much but it is a subjective opinion and both editions are totally awesome.

Packaging is a nice digipack that includes a booklet with photos and tour dates.

Menus are cute and wellmade.

Extras are nice although I'd have liked to see the Beavis and Butthead animation included.

The audio sounds incredible in 2 channels and it also comes in 5.1.

My personal opinion is that The Director's Cut is thought for watching on a big LCD or LED 16:9 TV (has a lot of shots from afar that wouldn't be fully appreciated on a 4:3 TV), on the other hand, the regular No Bull has most of the shots from a close-up point of view so it works good either on a new 16:9 TV or on your old 4:3 TV.",1305676800,7,841,4.198757763975156

3971444,3,B002R55IEE,"The music and concert are great. The video editing of cutting to a different scene every 3-5 seconds through the entire concert gave me a headache. Putting it in ""Angus vision"" helped a little, but it still cut back and forth 10-20 times a minute. The director must have ADD. I don't understand why they did that and destroyed the video. Anyway, the music is the redeeming factor here.",1339113600,6,385,4.594202898550725
