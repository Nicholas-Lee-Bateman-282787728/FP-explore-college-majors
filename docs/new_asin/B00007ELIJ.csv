Anyway I am waiting for the official release to get my copy!",1130457600,3,313,3.984126984126984

There are several of these Rock Masters DVDs in Amazon and elsewhere on the web that have a not yet released status (Police, AC/DC, Cure, others).",1118016000,,337,4.365079365079365

8067401,1,B00007ELIJ,"I'm very disappointed with these guys of amazon.ca. On October 21st  I ordered this product (Rock Masters: The Cure DVD) and two other items. According to amazon.ca the Rock Masters DVD would be delivered in about 3 or 5 weeks, but when a month went by they changed this period of time to 4 or 7 weeks and then to 1 or 3 months. On December 8th they sent me the two other items of my order and they notified me via email that there was a delay with the remaining item (Rock Masters DVD) of my order, and that it will be send by the time it arrives. But suddenly a few days later amazon.ca cancelled this item, telling me via email, that they were very sorry but they couldn't get this product from any of their sources.
I feel very upset about that and I don't understand why amazon.ca are offering this product if they aren't sure of its availablylity. They made me wait for 7 weeks to tell me: ""Sorry pal we didn't get it""",1071619200,6,924,4.191011235955056
