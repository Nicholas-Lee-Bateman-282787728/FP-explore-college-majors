8041383,5,B0006FO8FM,"I have been working with this book for about two months now, and I find it to be a great book for the introduction of Afro-Cuban drumming.  In three words, I love it!  It makes you think of the pattern in so many different ways.  I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to understand this style of drumming.  I would also suggest that the purchaser get her Video on this book, it is a great visual of the concept.",1289952000,,419,4.135802469135802
