6247705,5,B00I2YEH0A,A very emotional movie. Very well made.,1524441600,,39,4.714285714285714
6247706,5,B00I2YEH0A,Just because you are different does not mean you are bad. It is peoples perceptions that mold society how to perceive certain differences. Soma turn to the extreme of radical opinions of others and never get to see the differences that are really good in people. I thought this movie was on point in today's society. The struggles that both families had to endure is so heart wrenching but so oh true. I hope others watch this movie and see that you can learn a lot about the world we live in and walk away with all the good that was brilliantly shown in this moving drama.,1523664000,3,573,4.364485981308412

6247710,5,B00I2YEH0A,This movie is thought provoking in the world we live in today. Great acting and beautiful ending to a tragic story.,1395187200,,115,4.523809523809524
6247711,5,B00I2YEH0A,"The cinematography is beautiful in this well directed, moving story of a friendship between two very different mothers that develops thorough the shared grief of losing their sons in a tragic and unexpected way. The tensions that arise and the complexity of the situation unfold in startling and surprising ways. A quiet, but deep film about the impact of violence in our lives and world.",1393632000,,388,4.984615384615385
6247712,4,B00I2YEH0A,"One star down because the story dragged a little.. just a little. That moment where the viewer gets the point and film maker must put three exclamation points after that by showing the same idea again. But.. very sensitive, effective and hang in there till the ending because unlike some endings that might leave it open, there is a closure and it is the one that is just perfect for this movie.",1529712000,,395,4.5
6247713,3,B00I2YEH0A,I liked the ending of this film...we are not left in the dark.,1529625600,,62,3.8461538461538463

6247715,4,B00I2YEH0A,"Such an insightful, compassionate movie. A sad reminder that we all belong to each other.

Well acted, the two mothers are excellent.

It's just heartbreaking.",1529107200,,159,5.32
6247716,5,B00I2YEH0A,"Five stars for a simple presentation of complex matters after an explosion kills many at a shopping mall.  Not a lot of nuance here, so it was easy to feel and understand how families react as something terrible becomes even more terrible. Prejudice and religion are not a good mix. I'm not sure I liked the ending, which feels like a bow on a hideous package.",1529020800,,360,4.454545454545454
6247717,5,B00I2YEH0A,"It was an excellent find, a movie touching on delicate subjects of differences in cultures and the thing that brings us all together; humanity.",1529020800,,143,5.0
6247718,4,B00I2YEH0A,Very insightful and packed full of raw emotion. Not my usual type of movie but I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone.,1529020800,,121,4.083333333333333
6247719,5,B00I2YEH0A,This was a very good film.,1528848000,,26,3.5
6247720,5,B00I2YEH0A,"Great movie! You may think you've figured it out, but you haven't. Watch till then end. You won't believe it.",1528761600,,109,4.5
6247721,4,B00I2YEH0A,Heartbreaking for all involved.  A must see.,1528675200,,44,5.285714285714286
6247722,5,B00I2YEH0A,"I loved this movie in a heartbreaking kind of way. I think this story was told as real as they could tell it. No one really knows what is going on with any one specific person, ever. Sadly, it isn't until something horrific happens that people try to put the pieces together, and understand the story. And, as this movies shows, even then, we may never truly know. I get that when loss this profound happens in the world, we NEED someone to blame, we NEED answers, and more than that, we need answers WE can live with. I think sometimes it isn't so much the crime, event, or person/persons responsible in the end, it is what we need to tell ourselves and believe, so we can move on. I think the mother's were great, and depicted true heartbreak, the worst kind, losing your child to violence. Thanks for making this movie in such a way, that makes us all think.",1528588800,,861,4.354037267080745
6247723,5,B00I2YEH0A,"This is a slow moving, thought provoking movie.  I suspect most viewers will come to conclusions long before all the facts are known.  Be sure you watch to the end.",1528588800,,164,4.433333333333334

6247726,5,B00I2YEH0A,"Very good! Never expected the ending, but that's what really makes you question your self.",1528329600,,90,5.066666666666666
6247727,5,B00I2YEH0A,"Truly thought provoking. We don't always know and see what we think we know ands see. I am shocked some reviewers said it was ""boring"" or a waste of time. Guess there were not 'nuff  explosions for ya, huh? Well, it is a thinking-person's movie, replete with prejudices, broken hearts, and shattered lives. It's a slow burn. The actors were superb in their roles, living lives of quiet desperation. Not everyone is a beauty, a breakout, or a big star. These talents are subtle. The movie ended perfectly, not with a tidy package. Just like real life.",1528329600,,550,4.670103092783505
6247728,4,B00I2YEH0A,"This movie was one of those types that makes you honestly think. What these two moms endured from the aftermath of the accusations was brutal. The ending, for me, really brought it justice.",1527897600,4,189,4.757575757575758
6247729,1,B00I2YEH0A,"Waste of your time!  Made no point of view, good or bad.  The writers should get their GED and finish High School.",1527638400,,114,4.136363636363637

6247731,5,B00I2YEH0A,I was hoping it ended like it did. Very touching!! Great perspective on an uneasy truth.,1527292800,,88,4.5625

6247733,5,B00I2YEH0A,This was a great movie!  It kept me thinking back and forth through-out,1527120000,,71,4.461538461538462
6247734,5,B00I2YEH0A,"Thought provoking and heartfelt. Puts yourself in someone else's shoes and a testament that sometimes in tragedy, we'll never really know the truth.",1526947200,,148,5.478260869565218
6247735,5,B00I2YEH0A,"I thought it was a good movie, I was not sure how the ending would play out, but it surprised me!",1526688000,,97,3.6666666666666665
6247736,5,B00I2YEH0A,"I've seen better acting, I've seen better quality of movies altogether.
But the impact this film had on me is all that matters.
My wheels are spinning. This has opened my eyes, (and my mind).
Judgement is going to get the better of us.",1525305600,,235,4.363636363636363

6247738,5,B00I2YEH0A,"Great movie,,,,really makes you think!!!",1525305600,,40,7.2
6247739,4,B00I2YEH0A,Be forewarned before watching this movie that it touches on areas that most people don't like admitting too.  A Pakistani American woman and an American woman find a common bond after both their sons are killed in terrorist bombing of a mall.  Their bond soon turns to hatred after each of their sons are suspects in the tragedy.  You witness the private anguish each woman has as they face the possibility that maybe their son is guilty.  You are left not knowing until the final minutes of the movie which I won't reveal here.  Although the movie deals mostly with the two mothers it also gives glimpses of prejudices they had to deal with from the media and police.,1525132800,3,668,4.579831932773109
6247740,5,B00I2YEH0A,Excellent film. I rated it as a five.,1524960000,,37,3.75

8638425,4,B00I2YEH0A,"beautiful movie - this movie shows how miss- information can change a person's life , and how easy hate spreads.",1532044800,,112,4.65
8638426,5,B00I2YEH0A,The entire movie you are trying to piece together the situation and figure out which one did it. Its an amazing movie and honestly you either love it or hate it. Real time issues with realistic means of investigation. Its a great movie.,1531267200,,236,4.511627906976744
8638427,1,B00I2YEH0A,"This looked like it'd be good. But it was really slow, little dialogue to keep you interested. Bad acting/writing. And a terrible end.",1531180800,,134,4.869565217391305
8638428,5,B00I2YEH0A,"The whole movie was worth it for the ending. I'm in TEARS. Acting was great, very emotional ride.",1531094400,,97,4.444444444444445
8638429,2,B00I2YEH0A,"The premise is interesting but the way it plays out feels unrealistic

Good insight on how so many people jump to premature  conclusions in these type of situation

Also a good reflection how divisive society is as a whole",1530662400,,222,4.641025641025641
8638430,5,B00I2YEH0A,Worth watching. This movie touches on a lot of things we still deal with in this country and how quick we are to judge before knowing the facts.,1530057600,,144,4.178571428571429
8638431,1,B00I2YEH0A,"Bad acting,really bad.........trite script, lousy editing, poor directing. I can't say anything good about this film, It went nowhere and said nothing.",1529884800,,151,5.909090909090909
8638432,5,B00I2YEH0A,"Torn is an emotional rollercoaster. Two teens are killed in an explosion and then become suspects. The script is spot on and the acting (especially Dendrie Taylor and Mahnoor Baloch) is so good. The ending was something I didn't expect. Kudos to director Jeremiah Birnbaum, writer Michael Richter et. al. for this topical film. (John Heard is the only name in the film.)",1529798400,,370,4.888888888888889
8638433,4,B00I2YEH0A,"This movie is thought provoking and provided me a glimpse of the frustration of not knowing what actually caused a terrible tragedy, or who is at fault. The movie unfolds slowly which allows the two mothers' character to be developed. The acting is strong. It's not that I liked this movie, and I didn't enjoy watching it because it was sad, and most of the characters didn't show their redeeming qualities. I rate it 4 stars because it is worthwhile  and gave me food for thought.",1529712000,,481,4.593023255813954
