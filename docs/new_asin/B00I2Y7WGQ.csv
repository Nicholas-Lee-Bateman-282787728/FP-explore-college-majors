6247742,5,B00I2Y7WGQ,"A mostly unheralded genius, a maestro of both malevolent and mirthful music, with a dash of sass. The film showcases the great Graham Parker who, along with the Rumour, made vital songs that snarled and snapped with incredible energy and unexpected humor. The film is a fine homage to this transcendent talent.",1393977600,8,310,4.980769230769231

8638445,5,B00I2Y7WGQ,"The DVD captures a close up portrait of Graham Parker as an artist. It is fascinating to see how GP refused to compromise his integrity in order to achieve huge stardom for him and the Rumour, who were arguably the best live band in music in the late 1970s.  This is a great story of one of the most criminally underrated artist and bands and well worth it for all GP fans.",1411171200,,373,4.180555555555555
8638446,5,B00I2Y7WGQ,"An intelligent engaging documentary befitting the artist himself.  It does a good job telling the story of Graham & the Rumour's 5 year run as arguably the best band in rock.  A lot of cool archival clips mixed with modern day interviews with most of the pivotal figures.  Neat insights from peers Bruce Springsteen, Joe Jackson, etc... but where's Elvis C.?  The Narrative is loosely structured around the recent tour/album reunion of GP & the Rumour.  The film uses a fairly standard structure, but what's refreshing is the lack of ""Behind The Music"" tales of betrayal, debauchery & drug addiction that render so many of these re-tellings into cliche.  Present day Graham is fun to listen to as well .  He gives his views on past successes and failures, the choices he's made, & how he's at peace with his lot yet laughing at the absurdity of it all. Basically, GP's a very likeable curmudgeon whose heart's in the right place.  The making of the movie was a labor of love financed through Kickstarter.  There are no extras and no menu.  The DVD starts automatically and plays on a loop until you stop it.",1403568000,4,1107,4.65979381443299
8638447,5,B00I2Y7WGQ,"The question long posed...`Why oh why , has Graham Parker , so brilliant a performer and consistently excellent song writer, never hit the absolute top?' is not answered by this entertaining CD,but its a worthwhile glimpse behind the erroneous public image , to the real man beyond.",1403049600,,282,5.0212765957446805
8638448,5,B00I2Y7WGQ,"For newbies, this is a great follow up to the ""This is 40"" movie and it's bonus features. It's also a great overview of the carrier of the great singer/songwriter in it's own right. I've followed him from Heat Treatment until now and I can honestly say he has never put out an album I didn't love. I've seen him with a full band opening for Eric Clapton and 5 times solo (but never with the Rumour). I still learned a lot of things from this film and it was obviously a labor of love by those who made it.",1400976000,,505,4.06
8638449,3,B00I2Y7WGQ,"Good but rather unexciting Doco. Focuses too much on his current domestic life than what I thought it should do, bring to life a compelling artist in his prime. It tends to skip over many of his albums (Heat Treatment & The Up Escalator don't even get a mention). I was expecting something more thorough to be frank.",1399248000,5,316,4.4655172413793105
8638450,5,B00I2Y7WGQ,"I will keep this brief...

This is an excellent documentary on the criminally underrated Graham Parker and his band The Rumour. From his early personal history to present, this will not disappoint the hardcore nor even the casual GP&tR fan.

However, It would have been nice to see more artists interviewed (especially Elvis Costello whom I always thought was contrived, insincere, pretentious and without self editing) as GP was a massive influence on many of the New Wave artists of the 70's and 80's. One time at a Tommy Tutone concert I asked Tommy about Graham Parker and what he thought of his influence back in the day, he said ""We all got our sound from him.""

A very well done film by people that care....Highly recommended!",1398384000,5,733,4.755905511811024
8638451,5,B00I2Y7WGQ,"This documentary focus' on the reunion of GP and the Rumour in 2011/2012.  But there is an over all picture of Graham's career, what it is like to come so close to stardom and what it means if you don't quite reach the top of the pile.  The documentary is very frank about being a working musician, Martin Belmont telling how he works in 4 different bands and teaches guitar just to make ends meet.  Graham himself touring solo because he needs the income.  A fasinating look at working musicians today.",1397433600,8,503,4.4945054945054945
