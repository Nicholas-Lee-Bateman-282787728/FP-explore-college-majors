8573547,5,B00BT9PKHY,"A magnificent book brought to the screen with a fine cast.  I had a problem because there were no subtitles, not even in Italian and the speech is very rapid.  There are scenes where the women all speak at once almost like a chorus.  I read the book years ago; it's part of a trilogy by Ignazio Silone.  It's a very long movie with four sections.  Perhaps with repeated viewing I'll be able to understand it better.",1501200000,,415,4.337662337662338
