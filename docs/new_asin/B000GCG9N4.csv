8130604,4,B000GCG9N4,Bought this because my father was commander of the medical battalion that took over the camp. I wanted a document that showed me just what he saw at that time over and above the photos he himself took. One of the survivors came and visited us about twenty years ago. So for me this is very valuable. I recommend it for anyone who has some family ties to the camp,1414627200,,362,4.185714285714286
8130605,1,B000GCG9N4,"This is a very amatuerish DVD, in which many still photos are displayed repetitiously.
The narration is clearly totally impromptu - not planned or arranged in any orderly manner.
It's not very helpful in understanding the subject at all.",1350345600,,237,5.102564102564102
8130606,4,B000GCG9N4,"This film has a running time of 38 minutes. If you buy the DVD, this information will not be on the cover.  If DVD-R is to succeed, the purveyors must deliver quality product with the same features and information as DVDs found in retail stores.  Robert Shay",1325376000,,258,4.468085106382978
