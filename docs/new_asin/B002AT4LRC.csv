3891556,5,B002AT4LRC,"As I went to see the movie ""Karl Rove, I Love You,"" I realized I had no idea what to expect from this film.  I took my seat, the lights went down, and for the next 97 minutes I embarked on the  twisted and magical journey of loving Karl Rove.  It never failed to surprise or delight.  The acting is pitch perfect and the directing/storytelling is so imaginative and always leaves one guessing.  Truly a love story of unspeakable acts.  I am so glad that no one told me what the movie was about because one must experience ""Karl Rove"" for themselves.  It is a magical ride.",1247184000,,572,4.289719626168225
3891557,5,B002AT4LRC,"In the last few years I have been lucky enough to attend a number of film festivals across the world.  This has given me an opportunity to see ""Indie Films"" that aren't always accessible in your local movie theatre.  ""Karl Rove, I Love You"" is an example of one such film.

Funny, sad, biting and original are just some of the words used to describe one man's journey into the heart of Karl Rove.  Dan Butler, best known for his sports fanatic persona on Frasier, is a spectacular actor who is given an opportunity to not only shine but glow in this film.

Shot in the form of a documentary, the line between reality and fiction are continually blurred.  Rather than playing for cheap laughs, the film always takes the road less traveled and allows the audience to take the journey with Dan.  Is Karl Rove a misunderstood man with a huge heart or is he the icy devil pulling the strings of the Bush Administration?  When Dan sets out to expose Rove for the evil spirit that he is (by doing a one-man show about it) his mission changes and things get...well, complicated and weird. (In a delightful way.)

Films like this are made outside of the ""studio circle"" for a reason.  They take chances and give us an opportunity to see something other than a cookie cutter project with the same four familiar faces.  While the goal of ""Hollywood Blockbusters"" is to make as much money as possible, in order to recoup their budgets.  Films like this one are often labors of love that are created because someone wants to share a story with the audience.  The biting satire, ""Karl Rove, I Love You"" is incredibly entertaining but it is also so much more.

And thanks so places like Amazon, everyone will have an opportunity to see this wonderful film.  Check it out!",1247011200,7,1756,4.53015873015873
3891558,4,B002AT4LRC,"I had the opportunity to see this film at a screening and must say it was quite fun, entertaining and dark all at the same time.  Shot as a mockumentary much like Tanner '88 and Tanner on Tanner, the film mixes politics with the acting world.
Beginning in the months before the 2004 Presidential election, actor Dan Butler (FRAISER) is approached by filmmaker Phil Leirness (PARTY CRASHERS) to make a film on supporting actors, the unsung heroes of Hollywood. Using this pretense, the viewer is given a first person point of view to Butler's life and is present when Butler decides to put together a one man about Karl Rove, the Republican strategist responsible for the campaign of George W. Bush and later dubbed by Bush himself as ""The Architect.""  Starting off with the goal of exposing all the Machiavellian plans and schemes of a man seen as a conservative hero and the liberals' devil, the more Butler gets into the role, the more Butler starts to change, much to the alarm of his family and friends  and leading to the question, "" Who is playing whom?""
The acting by Butler is top notch as a Captain Ahab after his elusive whale and is supported in the effort by his own family and friends playing themselves, giving the film a feel of realism and vitality.  The first person camera work adds another character by breaking through the fourth wall and allowing the viewer to be an active participant.  In addition the subject matter is presented in such a way that it will appeal to all viewers, regardless of political slant.  Liberals will see it as a horror story while conservatives will see it is a comedy.  Overall, a good showing of Butler's skills and talent and definitely a fun film to watch.",1246924800,2,1709,4.639072847682119

8360285,5,B002AT4LRC,"OMG, I knew this film existed but was not expecting it to be as ""biting"" and as clever as it is! In fact, I found this so funny that I invited some friends over to watch it. All of us were just bursting out laughing, but many of us still wonder if life is indeed stranger than fiction.",1444176000,,285,3.9310344827586206

8360287,1,B002AT4LRC,This is your goofy cousin taking a camera to writers meetings and turning it on and then calling it a movie. I was hoping for an intelligent satire about Karl Rove that entertained and provided some additional knowledge on Rove. I got nothing form this movie in terms of humor or info about Rove. A complete waste of time . . . and I am easily entertained.,1383091200,,356,4.3283582089552235
8360288,1,B002AT4LRC,"I started to watch this but it was so boring I watched,instead, my cousin change the oil in his car. I would say this was done on a very low budget, with no real directing and without any real actors. I'm sorry but why even have this in your lineup, Amazon?",1367193600,,257,4.0588235294117645
8360289,1,B002AT4LRC,"The description misleads and represents this ""film"" as a documentary. it's not. at BEST it's a mockumentary...and a BORING one, at that. i love dan butler for living his life openly as a gay actor in hollywood....but i'm sorry to say that this ""film"" shows why he's never a leading man. and his ""life partner"" (as his BF is described in the film...c'mon. it's the 21st century, ""life partner""?) is no better at pretending it's all real, either. big disappointment. :( :( :( i give this ""film"" 3 frowny faces.",1328745600,2,508,4.655555555555556
8360290,5,B002AT4LRC,"You can barley describe this film without a spoiler alert every other sentence. Great story telling that just doesn't go where you expect to or where YOU personally might want it to go! It's one of those fine, and fun, examples of film making where  every viewer will take something different away from it depending on what point of view they went in to see it. Many times political satire will take a point of view and keep hitting that nail on the head. Karl Rove I Love You is more like a game of Wack'a Mole! Just when you think they're gonna put another nail in Rove's coffin TWO MORE pop up somewhere else. In these times of Obama mania no film could be more relevant to our time.",1247356800,3,686,4.276923076923077
8360291,5,B002AT4LRC,"It would be easy to take this film at its premise and enjoy it solely for its unique hook: actor Dan Butler (""Bulldog"" from TV's Frasier), upon discovering his physical resemblance to Republican political bulldog Karl Rove, embarks on a journey to mount a one-man show starring himself as Rove.  Along the way, this openly gay actor discovers Rove the man, who ostensibly stands against everything Butler and his circle of biased Hollywood cronies believe in, is someone entirely different than he originally set out to skewer.  To view the film this way is to have an enjoyable evening rental at home, but you would be missing so much more that is going on in this unique and subtle satire.

From the opening moments when mostly unseen documentarian Phil Leirness professes his fanaticism for onscreen actor Butler's work, we are in a world of hyper realistic commentary on the culture of celebrity intimacy as the de rigueur in today's society.  At a time when we all feel we were close and knew Michael Jackson when he passed without ever having spent one second of time with him in reality, so too does this film magnify the absurdity of human connection with public figures known only to us by the media.  Yet it seems so natural, which is why the film works - it seems perfectly normal for Butler to proclaim is love for a man who may actually be, in reality, someone who just might be out to kill him.

The celebrity of politics, the politics of filmmaking, the paranoia of an America where the government may be just as bad as the ""bad guys"" all are fair play for satire in this pic that can be paired with the best of the Christopher Guest mockumentaries, and what makes it so astonishing is just how believable this completely fictional tale is.  Set aside the rental and purchase this film.  It demands multiple viewings to get all the jokes, and it also asks the viewer to take a very real and serious look at what it really means to know someone, to love someone, to be the person that you are so that you are loved, and what the consequences can be if we continue to defer that love away from those who are really with us to those who are in the public eye.",1247356800,5,2171,4.49238578680203
8360292,5,B002AT4LRC,"this is a smart, funny film that will keep you entertained and laughing.  I think it is the best indie/festival film I have seen with good acting, great dialog (one line zingers you can miss if not paying attention) and a masterful, creative set-up.",1247184000,,249,4.659090909090909
