8157568,5,B000KJTGA6,"Not gonna lie, just between you and me I bought this for myself because it has been 45 long years since the last time I saw anything to do with Felix The Cat and back then I was quite fond of the cartoon.

And so for a very low fee I was able to determine what all the fuss was about back then as it was my favorite show after kindergarten.  Of course by first grade it had gone off the air here in the Dallas/Fort Worth market but no matter because Speed Racer began playing in our market and quickly became my new favorite cartoon to watch after school.

Anyway, the DVD had great picture and sound and most nuances of the shows I still remembered to a T ..... but one thing that seemed new to me was all the campy lines ... of course a lot of 5 year olds like me back then didn't even know what 'campy' was, lol.

Long story short, I'm glad I bought the DVD and would recommend it to anyone with young children who enjoy cartoons.",1475884800,2,933,4.027027027027027
