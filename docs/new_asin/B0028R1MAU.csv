Very solid script by Darren Dalton and Directed by C. Thomas Howell.
Not too many creatures,But what is here is very ,very menacing.
The ""Land"" intrigues us because is it Catalina Island or any California beach shot VERY carefully.
Acting is well rehearsed and unknowns carry alot of the weight to fill out story,Oh...They are marooned Nazis from a submarine that think VERY logically about survival.
One of those picky things is,Obviously this is headed to SyFy channel by lack of bad language and female glimpses.

3873011,3,B0028R1MAU,"I have grave doubts that screenwriter Darren Dalton ever read the Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel(s) they claim this movie is based on.  If they thought by slapping the author's name on this project it somehow sanctified it, they were sadly mistaken.
In their version, two couples charter a boat, encounter a strange storm, and are immediately transported to an uncharted island via the (often accused) Bermuda Triangle.  On this mysterious island, they encounter just two species of dinosaurs, a host of Germans, and a duplicitous duo with plans of their own.  As far as adventures go, there's not much in the way of excitement.  They do run a lot, and oddly enough, over utilizing the same forest sequence (7 times), whether they were in or near this forest.  Someone liked the effect and just kept using it.  Some mayhem is involved, the language gets a little salty at times, and the ending definitely left room for a sequel (but it's doubtful that one is forthcoming after all this time).

It's not the worst movie I've ever seen purporting to be taken from a book by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  If it featured a few more dinosaurs, more carnage, and some rudimentary suspense, I might have given it a higher rating.  As is, it does the basic job of entertaining.  I thought it was okay, I'd watch it again.",1410998400,5,1303,4.700440528634362

3873021,4,B0028R1MAU,"After their boat capsizes in a violent storm, a group of survivors land on a lush, deserted island. Unfortunately, they aren't alone. Course, this ain't no ordinary island, either. Prehistoric animals roam the jungles, castaways from different time periods in the past who live there aren't so welcoming to them. Their odds of escaping are slim. That, dear friends, is the premise of this movie.

The film is an adaptation of the 1918 Edgar Rice Burroughs novel of the same name, and a remake of the 1975 film. As with many Asylum films, it's considered to be a low budget mockbuster. In this case, of 2009's Land of the Lost. Other than the deserted island and the Prehistoric animals similarities, there are none else to speak of.

In my opinion, despite what others might think about the film, I think The Land That Time forgot is about one of the best Asylum films I've ever seen. Heck, hate to admit it but I love this version better than the 1975 film, actually. Even better than the Land of the Lost film, too.",1365724800,,1017,4.582417582417582
3873022,4,B0028R1MAU,"The 1975 version of Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Land-that-Time-Forgot-The-People-that-Time-Forgot-Midnite-Movies-Double-Feature/dp/B0007R4T1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Land that Time Forgot / The People that Time Forgot (Midnite Movies Double Feature)</a>"" with Doug McClure featured lame puppet-type dinosaurs, but made up for it with well-developed characters and a huge subtext, which was surprising for such a seemingly simple story.

This made-for-TV 2009 version changes everthing and I'm sort of glad because we already have the original that followed Burroughs' book pretty faithfully. The only similarity between this version and Burroughs' story is that there's an uncharted island, castaways, Germans, a U-boat and dinosaurs. That's it. This version features some sort of dimensional gateway where modern people and others from the last century meet on Caprona, the island. They try to figure out how to escape, how to get along and how to contend with dinosaurs, mostly a T-rex. Speaking of which, the T-rex doesn't look too bad for this type of micro-budget sci-fi, just don't expect ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jurassic-Park/dp/B0087ZG7HK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jurassic Park</a>"" quality (although the story's arguably better).

C. Thomas Howell directed the film and is also a member of the likable cast. I appreciate the camaraderie that develops between the Americans and the Germans. Speaking of which, the WWI Germans are pretty convincing.

As far as women go, Lindsey McKeon is the highlight as a shapely brunette, but there's also a good-looking blond (Anya Benton).

FINAL WORD: Although it doesn't follow Burroughs' book at all, this 2009 TV version of ""The Land that Time Forgot"" is a worthwhile lost-on-a-deserted-island flick in the tradition of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mysterious-Island-Widescreen/dp/B00006JDRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mysterious Island (Widescreen)</a>"" and others, like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-of-the-Dinosaurs/dp/B00005OSKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet of the Dinosaurs</a>"". If you enjoy movies of this ilk, you'll probably appreciate this one.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Malibu, CA.

3873024,4,B0028R1MAU,"First off, I found this film more enjoyable that the outdated puppet special effects of the oh so old 1975 film (C plus to B minus grade for that movie). The thing to keep in mind is that this is low budget film of only $600,000 so I am going to grade it on a ""B"" move scale, not a high budget one. Special effects were impressive for such a low budget piece. Certain scenes were interesting like when they got scientific at times and while acting was nothing spectacular the plotting of the tale was done well and the inclusion of various elements were better than average. Interesting enough way to off the T Rex. The Lindsey character, while pretty to look at, could have been more developed character wise and yeah I get she was mainly intended as eye candy in her short shorts. C. Thomas Howell directed and starred in this ""mockbuster"" film. Mockbuster films was a name dubbed by the press for lower budget films that attempted to capitalize on major studio releases. This was probably tied into the remake of LAND OF THE LOST. Of course, if you watch the Special Features section on the making of this film you can see that everybody is having a good time and nobody is trying to do Shakespeare yet they are trying to produce a direct to video film that will be entertaining to some people. Note that both this film and the old one are based on a 1918 novel of the same name by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Ironically, some claim Burroughs was trying to capitalize on similar stories that were hits with the masses. Two such notable hit novels by authors Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (LOST WORLD) and Jules Verne (THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND). STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; SPECIAL EFFECTS: B to B plus (for this budget); STAYING TRUE TO THE GENRE ELEMENTS: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early March 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.",1331251200,,1847,4.5

It has WW2 German soldiers who don't know the war is over. In the middle of the madness, there's an old phonograph that plays records of German waltzes, and a petroleum moonshine still. Nice touches. I don't like weak women in movies. This film gives us two who do absolutely nothing except act helpless and frightened all the time. I'll probably never watch it again, but I'm glad I saw it once. It was time well spent and I wasn't disappointed.

3873028,5,B0028R1MAU,"I'm a big Edgar Rice Burroughs fan and don't usually like movies that change things from the book.  My thought is, if the book was good enough for you to want to make a movie of it, why are you changing things?  However, though this definitely changed things from the E.R.B. book, I loved it!

  It had elements from the book.  The Germans and their U-boat were there, but it was more just an island in the Bermuda Triangle with dinosaurs on it.  Even so, the story was good.  The acting was good and for a low-budget movie the special effects were really good.  I have to give kudos to C. Thomas Howell for great directing.

  It begins on a small boat in a storm.  There are two couples, plus the captain and his mate.  The next morning, when the storm is gone, they have no idea where they are.  They spot an island and decide to head for it.  They drop anchor and all but one head for shore.  They soon discover pterodactyls and a t-rex, and upon finding the beach once more, discover the boat is gone.  Not long afterwards, they discover they aren't the only people on the island, some of which include Nazi's and a U-boat, stranded during WWII, which for them has only been a year or so..

  The only options available on the DVD are ""Play"" and ""Chapters"" which is slightly disappointing as I would have loved to see a ""Making of"".  Ah, well.  I'm not going to complain about what is there.  For the price, it's well worth it.

  I rate this four-and-a-half stars out of five, but as that option isn't available, I had to click on five stars.  No biggie.  This could use a boost to it's rating.",1307577600,8,1600,4.292929292929293

3873030,2,B0028R1MAU,"It's rare when I rate a movie 2 stars or less... normally if I watch the whole thing I figure it's worth at least 3 stars. Although I did watch this entire movie, I just can't give it more than 2 stars.

The acting isn't that great, the story isn't much better. There's tons of action, but the action lacks suspense so it just falls flat. The animation on the dinosaurs really isn't that great, although I could have overlooked that if there weren't so many other grievances. A few times there was a line said that was meant to be funny, but it just wasn't...even if it had been just the slightest bit humorous, the delivery wasn't good enough to get a laugh from the viewer.

Content Advisory:
For some reason I thought this was PG, but it's actually ""Not Rated"". There were no bedroom scenes, but there is a fair amount of language. Most is on the milder side of the scale (but there's quite a bit of it), and there were also at least 5 ""s"" words and one (possibly?) ""f"" word. I'm posting this as I would have found this information helpful before deciding to watch this, and hopefully someone else will find it helpful.

Nothing like the two movies made in the 70s, and gee why wouldn't their effects be laughable now they were made about forty years ago. Back when they were released they were at least as good as this one. This one centers on a group taking a trip by boat and ending up stranded on an island with a T Rex running around trying to eat them. The cast has some knowns like Thomas and several not as well known, but still they do a decent job. The group finds other unusual inhabitants and items like a pilot and submarine from WWII that has been there for years. They all work together to try and kill the T Rex and get off the island. Enjoyable enough that if it was selling for about half the current price I would pick it up but not for over twenty-two dollars.

3873034,3,B0028R1MAU,"""The Land that Time Forgot"" is a suprisingly good Asylum film.  It is a fun romp on a tropical island.  It has the Bermuda Triangle, dinosaurs, WWII Germans, unresolved plot threads, and a relatively happy ending.  The special effects are acceptable, and the actors are having fun.  Three stars for being a fun film.

Caveats: Naturally, this movie doesn't have anything to do with Edgar Rice Burroughs; it has more in common with Gilligan's Island.  The DVD has two extremely short ""Making of"" and ""Bloopers"" reels.  The movie has no Commentary feature.

This is the fourth Asylum film that I have watched in the past 72 hours.  ""The Land that Time Forgot"" is the best of the bunch so far.",1278288000,4,690,4.683333333333334
3873035,2,B0028R1MAU,"The Land That Time Forgot (2009), is a modern interpretation, of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic fantasy tale, where travelers on a small boat, encounter strange circumstances during a storm, land on a small island, and encounter dinosaurs, and other travelers also trapped there, from various periods in time.

There are several plots twists that keep things interesting, one involves the presence of a German WWII era submarine, and members of her crew, who considering the situation, turn out to be some very mellow sailors.  The discovery that there is oil on the island, provides a reason for the survivors to work together, to try and find a way to escape, as they set up their own refinery.

A film of the same name was released in 1975, and this version has kind of a retro 70's vibe.  The feature could easily have been more harsh or violent, but things are rather subdued.  The one gunbattle that takes place, is sanitized, and no one gets hurt.  The German sailors are cooperative, instead of being hardened killers.  The special effects are not bad, and the raptors that are the main threat, are fairly well done.  Dinosaurs do chomp a couple of people, but that is the most violent thing you will see, in this lightweight adventure.

C. Thomas Howell (The Hitcher), both stars and directs this feature, that has decent production values, and a fairly competent cast, that also includes Timothy Bottoms, Scott Subiono, and Darren Dalton, who also wrote the screenplay.  If you happen to see this on your cable schedule, you might what to check it out.  Although recently released on DVD, another less expensive version is also available.",1273708800,,1647,4.867383512544803
3873036,1,B0028R1MAU,"I watched this bad boy when it aired on the Syfy network. They use the title THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT for a very simple reason: Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote soooooooooo long ago that the vast bulk of his writings are in the public domain.  Besides, the old boy has been dead for 60 years and can't complain.  Hell, alot of hias children are dead and his grandchildren are old.  But I digress .... ERB's tale was of (then) modern humans finding a land that was prehistoric and a strange power over evolution.  You have the survivors of a U-Boat attack talking over the sub and ending up in Caprona.  This thing is somekind of Bermuda Triangle story and there's nothing wrong with that.  Just don't tag Edgar Rice Burroughs to this thing and pretend it has ANYTHING to do with his story.",1267660800,2,784,4.4475524475524475
3873037,3,B0028R1MAU,This is your typical B movie done more recently. The story line is rather basic without many surprises. One benefit is that with modern special effects wizardry there weren't any actors in puppet suits trying to look like a dinosaur. If you would like to see a few CGI dinosaurs you might like this DVD.,1265414400,,303,4.527272727272727
3873038,4,B0028R1MAU,"Yup, this is a low budget movie with cheesy special effects, but you know what?  For a low budget movie with cheesy special effects, it really isn't too bad.  Sure some of the stuff that happens is unrealistic, but this movie does not take itself too seriously and is kind of fun.  The monsters look fake compared to other movies like Jurassic Park and that mess that Will Farrell put out, but who cares?  Just enjoy it.  And wow, Timothy Bottoms looks so much like George W. Bush in this movie.",1262390400,8,495,4.395604395604396

The plot is lame in it's predictability and the acting is forgettable.  Some of the best parts of the original novel were left out.  The redeeming feature is that it did not have a comedic ending.",1249603200,2,338,4.419354838709677
8356662,2,B0028R1MAU,"The good news may be that one of those 1980's kid actors now grown up, C. Thomas Howell got an acting gig. He must have been desperate to work for Asylum Pictures. Was Howell aware that disaster film production company's reputation for making horrible flicks? Most of the typical Asylum trademarks are there including lousy direction, screenwriting, poor acting, cheesy CSI effects with whipped cream and a cherry on top. The better film version of Eagar Rice Burroughs' The Land That Time Forgot is the one starring Doug McClure (1975) featuring plastic dinosaurs. For concerned guardians, the movie contains needless profanity and some adventure violence.
