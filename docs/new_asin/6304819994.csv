7878179,1,6304819994,"If you are looking, as I was, for an informative dvd that really talks about fall prevention, do not order this dvd. It runs for 9 minutes and costs nearly $90.00! I thought I would be getting a workbook or something with it for that type of money, but no. It is just a dvd that lasts 9 minutes and is poorly done, at that!",1308787200,,323,3.9846153846153847
7878180,5,6304819994,"For all those Karaoke-addicts, the Classic R&B Collection makes a great addition to your library! Who hasn't hummed or sang along to the radio to favourite songs?  Well now you can do it and put yourself in the  spotlight! With both recent artists and songs, the Collection has songs to  appeal to people of all ages...  The great thing about DVDs is that you can  listen to song being sung, and sing along, or if you're more courageous ..  turn off the singer, and go for it.. Whether you're shy and sing alone, or  a singing superstar and have your friends around, Karaoke is a load of fun!  The only downside to the singers not being the original artists is that the  song may be sung slightly differently and the words might be slightly  different ... but apart from that ... Get out there with your microphone  and be a star!",961632000,2,830,4.430463576158941
