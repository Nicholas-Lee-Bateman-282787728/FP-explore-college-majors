Creature has a lot of hilarious low-budget moments of ""terror"".  i bought it for the old tv movie Snowbeast, which i remembered fondly as a kid.  Hasnt held up as well decades later, but still worth the price.  Would definitely buy again from this seller.",1265328000,,399,4.794117647058823

7950935,4,B00005QW4Z,"-----> ABOUT THE 3 FEATURE FILMS IN THIS DVD SET:

Inside a single disk DVD case you will get 3 films on 1 side. That does not sound promising, yet it plays well, certainly as good or better than their VHS counterparts. I know this, because I have these films on VHS and they are pretty fuzzy, dark transfers on VHS. On DVD all three films play and sound pretty good, although the pictures are a bit dark and fuzzy, probably from the manner in which they were filmed more than anything else. For instance, 'Creature' is literally always playing with very dimly lit sets. No DVD regardless of the transfer quality is going to improve on poor lighting or camera work in the first place. Having said that, each one of these films is watchable and without any major complaint.

-----> BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE 3 CREATURE-FEATURE PRESENTATIONS <-----

#1-- ***** 'TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST' -- Weakest entry in the set *****

CAMPY 1976 CREATURE FEATURE AVOIDS GRATUITOUS SEX & VIOLENCE

IN A NUTSHELL: RICK BAKER HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR 10 OSCARS FOR 'MAKE-UP' & SPECIAL EFFECTS'

There is one good thing about the 1976 B-CREATURE FEATURE 'TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST' -- RICK BAKER'S, BIG LIZARD MONSTER SUIT!

WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT: TYPICAL LOW-BUDGET CREATURE FEATURE FROM THE 70s

Essentially, a man gets hit in the head by a meteor and becomes a kind of cosmic werewolf that resembles a cross between a primate and a monitor lizard. Though it is a slow moving flick it does eventually reveal itself as campy creature feature. 'Track of the Moon Beast' has the feel of a Kolchak the Night Stalker episode minus Kolchak.

BOTTOM LINE: 'TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST': 2-STARS - WEAK THEME BUT WATCHABLE

This is NOT a GOOD film, but it admirably avoids the usual cheesy excessive violence and gratuitous sex making it watchable -- at least. Rick Baker's monster suit is probably the high point of this film. If you enjoy cheesy, campy, creature-features this is a film you may want to see -- once!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2-- ***** 'CREATURE' -- BORROWED TOO MUCH FROM ALIEN - TOO MUCH GORE TOO LITTLE STORY *****

THIS IS A TRUE 'B' CREATURE FEATURE -- SHAMELESS EXPLOITATION - GORE - NUDITY & SCARY AT TIMES TOO

IN A NUTSHELL: A 'B' CREATURE FEATURE THAT TRIES VERY HARD TO OVERCOME ITS OWN LACK OF ORIGINALITY

Yes, everyone who has seen this film or is considering viewing it now is familiar with the 'Alien' trilogy. Too bad, because this film would be a decent cheesy 'B' Creature-Feature if the 'Alien' franchise did NOT exist. Since 'Creature' is so reminiscent of 'Alien' a comparison is inevitable. In such a comparison the praise and box-office success that 'Alien' has enjoyed as well as its staying power over the years seems to be justified. Again, that in a way is too bad, because if 'Creature' was not so suggestive of 'Alien' it might be a success as a 'B' Creature-Feature. Recall, 'The Blob', with Steve McQueen, or 'Tremors' with Kevin Bacon. Neither of those films was original, in fact 'Tremors' was so similar to 'Jaws' that its original name was, 'Land Shark', but those films did manage to create an identity of their own and with it some film pathos. An identity and film pathos seems to be what is lacking in 'Creature'. After all, it does have scary moments and the long dramatic climax is rather suspenseful, but somehow a thrilling cinematic experience is never sustained long enough for this film to be memorable. Too bad, since I am a real sucker for this type of film, or rather the type of film that 'Creature' almost was.

William Malone, the Director, also Directed the 1999 remake of, 'The House On Haunted Hill', which gave him the chance to remake something without having to apologize for doing so. Malone also Directed 'The Incredible Hulk Returns', 1988, and 'Scared To Death', 1980.

A CAUTION TO PARENTS: 'CREATURE' contains NUDITY - GORE - VIOLENCE

There is some gratuitous gore and violence, plus some really gratuitous nudity, all of which precludes viewing by younger audiences. The nudity comes chiefly in just one scene, but it is rather extreme, and frivolous. I was grateful for the poor lighting during that scene.

BOTTOM LINE: 'CREATURE' ISN'T A TERRIBLE FILM THOUGH IT SEEMS TO BE A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR MOST VIEWERS - 2.5 STARS

This film relies too heavily on cheap tricks such as, gratuitous gore, nudity, and dark sets. Add to this, is a similarity with Ridley Scott's 'Alien' that is close to being a rip-off, with much lower production and artistic values. Nevertheless, there are parts of this film, particularly after they have used up most of the characters by means of the aforementioned tricks, where there is suspense, tension and some chills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3-- 'SNOWBEAST' OWES MOST OF THE PLOT TO JAWS & WORKS ON OUR IMAGINATIONS

A GREAT DEAL IS LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION -- PERHAPS TOO MUCH FOR MANY VIEWERS

FIRST THOUGHTS: WITH GORE DOMINATING THE HORROR GENRE IT'S NICE TO SEE THE IMAGINATION CALLED UPON AGAIN

For me it is sad to see that most people found 'Snowbeast' to be boring and trivial. I say this because I have enjoyed watching this admittedly tame TV creature-feature with my daughter for the past 15 years. I introduced it to her on Video, having recalled seeing it as a TV movie when it was first released in 1977.

Yes, 'Snowbeast' promises more than it delivers, but I was able to feel OK when allowing my youngsters to watch this rather tame creature-feature which kept their interest without giving them nightmares.

IN A NUTSHELL: SNOWBEAST MAY BE A JAW'S RIP-OFF BUT JOE STEFANO IS AN EXCELLENT SCREENWRITER

One of the reasons that I wanted to see 'Snowbeast' when it was first on TV, nearly 30 years ago, was that the screenwriter, Joe Stefano, was the screenwriter for the original 'Psycho', directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and many of my favorite 'Outer Limit's' episodes. He always gives a good account of himself by forcing the viewer to use his/her imagination to enrich the experience. This works for me, but clearly the expectation of many creature-feature fans is for more explicit action and a more original plot. I do agree about the originality of the plot, but as for a more explicit tone, I think that sometimes less is better. This can of course be seen by some as promising more than is delivered. It is interesting to note that the film 'Tremors' which has been very well recieved, is even more of a rip-off of 'Jaws' than 'Snowbeast', yet it is a well-crafted film which includes quite a bit of gory horror.

BOTTOM LINE: 'SNOWBEAST' IS LIKE AN ORIGINAL OUTER LIMITS EPISODE BY THE SAME WRITER - 3.5 STARS

It is probably safe to say that if you liked original 'The Outer Limits', which had about 1/3 of its episodes written by 'Snowbeast's' screenwriter, Joe Stefano, you will like 'Snowbeast' which has always seemed to me like an 'Outer Limit's' double episode.

***** SPECIAL FEATURES *****

Special Features are limited to a couple of selected filmographies, biographies and a limited version of scene selection.

'CLASSIC CREATURE MOVIES' SUMMED UP: 4 STARS FOR OUTSTANDING THEMATIC VALUE

Ok, so there are NO classics in 'Classic Creature Movies', but there are creatures; campy, over-the-top maybe, but creatures all the same. I purchased this DVD set because I wanted to replace the worn out video copy of 'Snowbeast' that I couldn't find anyway. My only expectation here was a cleaner copy of 'Snowbeast' than I had on video and I have NOT been disappointed. If you know what to expect in this set you will be very pleased when it arrives and you play them one after another, as I did. Some of these films may be new to you, which may make viewing them for $6. all the more enjoyable. Only a few years ago it would have costed $6. just to rent these films for a day or two.",1161648000,,9638,4.870313460356484
7950936,3,B00005QW4Z,Good to get bonus of 2 extra movies. Snowbeast was a movie been wanting to see since a kid and it did not disappoint. Not for everyone - a bit cheesy but enjoyable. Creature like an early type alien movie. OK.,1156636800,,209,4.121951219512195
7950937,4,B00005QW4Z,"Well the ""flicks"" were definitely not award worthy but,they bring a nostalgia when seen.",1140480000,,88,5.357142857142857
7950938,3,B00005QW4Z,"This disk contains three supposed classic movies involving creatures.  The movies include such talents as Klaus Kinski, Bo Svenson and Yvette Mimieux.
The first (Creature) stars Klaus Kinski and involves the competition between two corporations.  One has made an archeological discovery on Titan but the crew was killed when they collided with a space station.  The rival corporation send a salvage crew out to stake a claim.  Unfortunately, the first team found, and releases, a centuries old creature bent on killing everyone a la Alien.
The second movie (The Track of the Moonbeast) is the silliest.  An asteroid collides with the moon and debris is sent up.  A piece falls to Earth and hits a man.  Now he changes into a big lizard by the light of the moon.  A lame reworking of werewolf tales.
The final movie is Snowbeast and stars Bo Svenson who, based on this performance, you would never believe he won a best actor award.  A ski resort is terrorized by a yeti during their 50th annual Winter carnival.  A somewhat lame attempt to cash in on the Jaws phenomenon.  The book (which I read many years ago) was far superior.  Oddly enough, you never really see the creature in this one.
All in all there are three silly or fun movies on one side of one disk.  Creature, even when it was first released, was never a clear print (dark and steamy sets), but the other two are true to their original releases.  These are fun movies to poke fun at, especially in Snowbeast when some logs roll into the side of a camper.  The result is that they are somehow suddenly sticking out the back door and the guns that everyone was carrying are now inside the camper in a closet.",1074038400,6,1671,4.579124579124579
7950939,3,B00005QW4Z,"This is a good value DVD with three films instead of the usual one! All are in full screen and only 'Creature' has a Dolby Digital mix. The picture quality on all three films is pretty rough but watchable and better than any video version you are likley to have. The extras are talent bios which which are better than nothing.
Creature: This one has the highest production values and is basically a rip off of Alien and Night of the Living Dead. The acting and script are pretty good but I found it all a bit boring to be honest!
Track of the Moon Beast: Oh dear, this film is pretty lame in all departments from the totally shocking special effects on the meteor to the terrible acting of the female lead. Man she is really kak. But the whole thing has a sweet little charm which makes it just entertaining for fans of kitsch.
Snowbeast: This is the one I bought this DVD for. I remember seeing this as a kid and it still kicks! Basically imagine the plot of Jaws translated to a ski resort and a shark replaced by a man in a yeti suit and your there. With great music, decent acting and a pretty good script it's the pick of the bunch. (although the colour on the DVD is pretty messed up in places)2 of the three stars in my rating for this DVD come for Snowbeast alone!
This DVD is definately worth a look for fans of low budget rip-off cinema like me, but if you are a multiplex popcorn muncher who likes your production values high then you better give it a miss.",1028073600,13,1468,4.227758007117438
