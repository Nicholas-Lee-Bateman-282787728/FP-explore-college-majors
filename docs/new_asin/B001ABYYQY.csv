Olmi remained in my memory with his greatest masterwork -The tree of the wooden legs 1977- as one of the most and probably the last filmmaker of a vanished tradition (with the only two memorable exceptions Angelopoulos and Sokurov) that understands the cinema in terms of total art.

This extraordinary film mirrors the agony, tragedy and desperation of Giovanni Medici as the great goalkeeper of the Christendom mortally wounded in combat due the first piece of modern artillery.

The movie elapses like an endless nightmare where the fire of guns are blended with the double crosses, intrigues and half truths of the political establishement by then, nurtured by witty reflections of Machiavelli and the well known interiorities of Counsellors. Olmi barely makes an account without sinding by neither one of these opposite forces.

The movie in question won nine David de Donatello Prizes in 2002. Best picture, script, direction, edition, production, photography, music, set and costume. Additionally, it got a wide public acceptance in Cannes Festival 2001.

So I would like to invite you my dear reader to go for this genuine memorable and ignored masterwork. It's absolutely understandable that this film has passed underneath the scrutinizing eye of so many people who before myself, watched it.

Don't let pass this magisterial film.",1307664000,4,1492,5.144628099173554
