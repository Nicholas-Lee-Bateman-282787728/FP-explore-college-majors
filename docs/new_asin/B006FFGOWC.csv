HOWEVER!

I refuse to pay five-hundred dollars for such a thing! Why is the price jump from DVD to Blu-Ray so astronomically high here?! I could understand paying one-hundred, hell, I'd even pay one-fifty, but this entirely unreasonable! My toilet-paper's not made from Benjamin's you know!

-Pssst! I gave it five stars because it's a great anime..",1353974400,2,444,4.906666666666666
8670778,5,B006FFGOWC,"I freaking love kobato, it is easily my favorite anime ever!  The problem is... this thing is 500 freaking dollars??!??! WHY?!?!  I really want it but that's just too much ...  In any case i recommend buying the DvD's and the manga and ect ect but 500 for this is just too much.",1344211200,,278,4.2075471698113205
