8021887,4,B000246E3Q,"Very simple early 60's Russian love story.  A young girl raised by her former sailor father, after an old man gives her this prophecy, dreams that someday a handsome young man will come to marry her.  This prince charming is supposed to sail to her little port village on a ship with red sails.  The young captain, who has rejected his aristocratic background, after seeing the young girl sleeping in the woods and hearing about her fantasy, arranges everything so he can win her heart.  The scenery has, I think, the typically bleak beauty of the Russian countryside.  The scene of a rowboat tied to the dock while the ocean gets rough is impressive.  The DVD has many dubbing and sub-title options, including English.  The DVD is excellent quality, the picture is clear and the color is very nice.  Recommended for fans of Russian love and fairy stories that have a minimum of political rhetoric.",1438646400,,898,4.748387096774193
8021888,4,B000246E3Q,"""Scarlet Sails"" is a wholesome Russian family film for children ages 6-13. This Disney-like production is available with multilingual  sub-titles and dubbing, including English. The basic theme of the tale is to ""never allow your station in life, rich or poor, to stand in the way of pursuing your dreams."" It contains sub-themes, such as ""the need for parents not to discourage their children from such pursuits"", ""family loyalty, especially toward children,"" ""ignore naysayers"" and ""wealth is no guarantee for happiness.""

The storyline is about a sea captain who returns home only to find that his wife had tragically died from pneumonia while he was out to sea. Although,their baby daughter was being cared for by a loving neighbor, the captain is determined to take on the struggle of a single-parent to raise his daughter. She grows to become a beautiful maiden, who is in pursuit of finding a seaworthy soul mate, likened to her father, with whom to live happily ever after. She comes upon a sage who tells her that she will find her dream when a ship with unusual scarlet sails comes into port.

In contrast, there is a young boy born into wealth under a lot of pressure to maintain the family traditions of his rich family. He happens to have a natural love for adventure on the seas and runs away from his life of wealth to pursue his seafaring dream.  He becomes the captain of a ship with scarlet sails and upon his arrival to the port of the young maiden they fall in love and marry into the blissful life of their dreams.

Although a bit dated, the lovely film is worthy of viewing by a young audience as encouragement to seek their dreams.",1374969600,,1654,4.670103092783505
8021889,5,B000246E3Q,"This film is probably the most beautiful and romantic film ever made. If there was ever a ""feel good"" film, this is it. It should be shown on TCM as often as Philadelphia Story and should be in the film library of every major college. Unfortunately this will never happen.

The story is simplicity in itself. An old man tells a very lonesome and unhappy 5 year old girl that if she remains true to herself and her dreams that one day, when she is grown, a white ship with scarlet sails will miraculously appear and on board will be a handsome prince who will take her away to everlasting peace and happiness. The townspeople find out about this and make her life even more miserable but she remains true and, one day, when she is is a young girl, upon the horizon can be seen a white ship with flowing sails of scarlet. And upon the ship...

Everything is right here. The music is gorgeous and fits the fairy tale like a glove. In this restored print the photography is stunning and the first shot of the red sailed ship - an actually ship borrowed from the Russian navy - will never be forgotten. And the acting by the four leads is unsurpassed.

The movie is based upon a famous novella by a wonderful Russian author of the early 20th century, Alexander Green (Alexandr Grin). Director Alexander Ptushko has done himself and Green proud. The theme of the book seems to be that miracles can happen and one definitely does occur. How and why are explained in this film.",1166745600,4,1469,4.433333333333334
