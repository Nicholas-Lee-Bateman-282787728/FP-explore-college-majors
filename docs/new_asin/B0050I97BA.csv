8451239,5,B0050I97BA,"As a female anime fan, I love shows that have a great plot instead of just mindless action.  Night Raid is one of those shows.  It's like James Bond meets the Dead Zone. (great book by the way. Stephen King is a GENIUS!!!)  This anime is about Japanese spies in the 1930's who also have psychic abilities and use those abilities to defeat the bad guys and save the day.  It sounded far-fetched to me at first, but a friend of mine recommended it, and after watching it with her, I loved it so much I had to get my own copy!  My favorite character is Yukina Sonogi, who's a young woman with the ability to get ESP readings from anything she touches.  She's searching for her lost brother along the way and with a war going on, it gets ""complicated"" and quirky at times.  But its a cool journey to take and an interesting story.  I'd definitely put it in my top 25 list of favorite animes.",1504224000,,887,4.238095238095238
8451240,4,B0050I97BA,"Unlike so much Japanese animation, including even that by greats like Studio Ghibli (Isao Takahata's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies/dp/B008XEZXRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies</a>, Hayao Miyazaki's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howl-s-Moving-Castle/dp/B00BEYYEIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howl's Moving Castle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wind-Rises/dp/B00MHT49KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wind Rises</a>), the creators behind Night Raid 1931 had the courage to stare into the honest jaws of history and confront Japanese overconfidence and oppression just as it is beginning to roll off track in 1931 and calmly but relentlessly pronounce judgement.  Unfortunately in the process the creators occasionally forgot that they were supposed to be telling a story.

The year is 1931 and though few at the time could see it, the world in general and Asia in particular are rolling inevitably towards WWII, but was this the only option?  This is the story of four supernaturally gifted Japanese amateurs who, working as agents for the Japanese government, did their damnedest to serve their country as well as their own particular interests,... both succeeding and failing.  The little, individual stories that fill a single episode tend to vary, but the overarching story that eventually takes over as the main premise involves the intriguing mystery of the heroine's missing brother who seems to have gone rogue and combines noble sounding ideals with a dark premise, forcing everyone to choose.

As I mentioned above, the best part of this show is the clear-eyed lens the producers focus on the Japanese government, particularly the military forces who step by step, with rational minds and love of country, slowly committed the acts that placed Japan on a course of increasing lies, dirty tricks, horrible cruelties, and senseless acts that eventually faced it with an enraged and united United States that knowing it faced a battle by bayonet point for every square foot of Japan, coldbloodedly hit Japan with every weapon it could devise.  (That this DIDN'T result in tripling US losses while effectively exterminating the Japanese people is one of the wonders of this war.)

The worst part?  Well, it is tough to cheer on heroes who are ultimately doomed to lose even when they are teaching us something; by the time the series wraps in 1936 you can only hope that the survivors survive the nine years of horror that you know are coming.  Yukina annoys a bit with her solemn demeanor and single minded focus, but her job is to unite the boys, and this she usually does.  Aoi and Kazura fight like cats and dogs for most of the show, but then they represent the two halves of Japan: modern and European versus ancient and honorable.  When together they are invincible; when apart (as they often are) they fail, and one of them has usually lost his way.  As for the ultimate ""villains"", the show is a little late in completely revealing them, and that means a lot short in completely untangling the plot.  (And don't get me started on the subject of memory modification and erasure!  Certain individuals in certain circumstances, that I can buy; hundreds of people who have been shocked out of their wits, no way!)

Note: Given all the confusion, both deliberate and TV viewer induced, and added to by helpful US web sites, the complete series is more necessary than ever (and the excellent English version more critical than ever); watch it in the following order as displayed on the two disks: Disk 1: Episodes 0-7, OVA Episode 1, Disk 2: Special Episode: The Prophecy under Special Features (compilation episode only available in Japanese with English subtitles), Episodes 8-13, OVA Episode 2.",1472601600,,3896,5.6020408163265305

8451243,3,B0050I97BA,"Night Raid is unique in the realm of anime.  It takes place in 1931 China.  The main characters are part of a super powered spy team.  One can teleport, another can read minds, etc.  They don't focus heavily on the super powers or the history, which is an elegant touch, but ultimately a nail in the coffin for a show that desperately needs more to it.

***CHARACTERS***
The characters are designed well.  They are not deep, but well above childish anime clones.  Their boss resembles the head of Public Security 9 from Ghost in the Shell.  He's professional, to the point, and his true motives are kept murky.  There's a good contrast between the two male leads.  One of them uses his power at every turn and the other practices extreme restraint.  It's a tasteful comparison the holds the most cohesive narrative throughout the series.  The female lead is not annoying and that's hard to do in anime.  The fourth member of the team is the lumbering, strong and silent type.  His character barely develops beyond that, but it's only a minor negative.

***STORY***
This is pre World War II in Shanghai.  The creators should be applauded for choosing to tell a story in a time that is not obsessed on by historians (who clearly hunger to write about the two juicy wars that sandwich it).  The genesis of the show is slow, but smart.  The following episodes form a great premise.  The middle is painfully aimless, and boring.  The ending is adequate in execution, and champions an interesting theory about China and the first atom bomb.  It's a historically intriguing story, that's carried with the speed of a tortoise.  Slow and steady did not win the race, and imprisoned the show in mediocrity.  It's a shame.

***ANIMATION***
The animation is great.  The fights are beautifully choreographed, but rare.  The backgrounds are especially good and I could tell that the animation team was excited to draw anything other than Tokyo.

All in all, I'm not sure if this story could ever get 5 stars.  It's worth viewing and considering, but not groundbreaking.  4 stars could have been achieved if they embraced more action and a tighter storyline.  Uninspired wandering activated the A.D.D. switch and I had to will myself to pay attention.  Nothing offered, nothing gained I guess.  Still, I hope this draws a bigger audience, but it will be hard to find them.",1383696000,4,2357,4.757425742574258
8451244,4,B0050I97BA,"I thoroughly enjoyed this anime because it is very different on many levels from other series.  First of all, it is a spy genre, something that should be exploited more in anime productions.  Second, it weaves together a historical touch with a bit of fiction to flesh out some really interesting themes of espionage, intrigue, and conspiracies.  Finally, it brings a touch of the fantastic as the main characters have super-human powers of the mind.  This is an anime that does a good job of putting these aspects together to create a wholesome story without giving leverage to the other.

What I really enjoyed most about this anime is that it is centered on Asia.  Of course, there are many series where the setting is in Japan itself, but this anime makes it more interesting in exploring Asia in the 1930's and the web of politics and history surrounding that era.  Modernization is taking a hold on Asia after years of isolation, and now powers are jockeying for influence in various places, including the melting pot in the city of Shanghai.  This where our spy team comes in:  the Sakurai Kikan, a Japanese psych-ops intelligence unit who use their unique powers to accomplish missions individually in each episode while discovering a bigger conspiracy behind it all.  The writers and producers took great liberties in exploring Japanese history while planting a special plot of the creative in putting characters with these powers, especially the Mukden Incident which set off a pretext to invade Manchuria.  Even the puppet emperor of Manchuria, gets a mention in the series.

The intelligence squad is headed by Mr. Sakurai, an older Japanese gentleman who behind the scenes orchestrates their missions.  There's Aoi, a young man with great telekinetic powers, who is more carefree and wild in approaching the operations, who is contrasted with his partner Kazura, a conservative man of patriotic fervor.  He has the ability to teleport.  The other two psychics are Yukina, a serious, calm woman who can talk with her own thoughts to the other team members, and Natsume, her protector, who has clairvoyance and can perceive things from afar.  The characters are unique in the own right and have special backgrounds, though at times they are a little dull.  I think this is due to the English voice acting. The dubbing seemed to have a tone of ""adjusting to the lips"" rather than making a unique soundtrack that makes up for doing a dub.  For example, Mr. Sakurai sounds the exact same in every episode, very redundant and much like an NPR show host.  I would assume that the Japanese soundtrack would be better done to flesh out the characters' souls.

The series explores a plethora of themes with Japan's controversial start to the invasion of China.  I think it is a brave approach for such an anime, but I think this is what it makes it stand apart from others is that it does have a historical backbone.  The re-production of environments in Shanghai and some scenes in Japan are remarkable.  Very well drawn.  The rendering of the characters is well done as well, with the characters having more true Asian characteristics.  The plot centers on individual missions until it reveals a bigger conspiracy of a rogue officer trying to unite Asia with a political theory that was relevant at that time: Pan-Asianism.

I enjoyed this series because of its unique approach in story that is not done in most animes.  Its historicity with its fantasy is a neat touch and combining the psychic elements of the characters makes for a good plot and great action. A good watch.",1344384000,6,3581,4.847039473684211

(PLOT)Set in Shanghai in 1931, the Imperial Japanese Army has been dispatched to mainland China due to the relatively recent First Sino-Japanese War, Russo-Japanese War, and World War I. In this cosmopolitan city of intrigue, there is a special military spy organization called ""Sakurai Kikan"" that has since been buried in history.

(Impressions it left of people who have view this anime)
Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network found the story reminiscent of Ian Fleming's works, being in the pulp espionage genre, which he regarded as being a refreshing change from other anime series. Theron Martin felt the story seemed like a ""particularly strong addition"" to the ""super powered secret spy"" genre, and commended the attention to details in using Chinese dialogue, but felt the musical score did not always work with the show. Hope Chapman enjoyed that the stunts in the anime did not seem ""implausible"", and enjoyed the setting. Tim Maughan compared the show to Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, and felt the exposition to be difficult to follow at times. Maughan enjoyed the ""convincing noir atmosphere"" and ""exhilarating"" action scenes. Rebecca Bundy felt that the first episode wasted time on exposition and did not build a picture of the relationships between the characters. Christopher Macdonald felt it had ""a lot of potential"".
