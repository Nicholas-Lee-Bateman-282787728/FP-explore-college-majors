679177,4,6303495591,"Essentially a comedy of manners with menace, ""Bob the Gambler"" or ""BOB LE FLAMBEUR"" is a great caper film that also heralded the coming French New Wave. The electric, slang-filled French dialogue written by Auguste le Briton (""Rififi"") has a rhythm and snap that is nicely mirrored in the cool, slick, sometimes sinister unfolding of the story itself. Unfortunately, the dialogue suffers a little in the not quite spot on English subtitles.

Director Jean-Pierre Melville pretty much invented the French crime film. After World War II Melville (real last name Grumbach), made films on a shoestring, on location and without stars. He was alone among all French filmmakers who made pictures entirely on his terms. This 1955 film, with a budget about ten times bigger than a typical French film of its time, is also a loving portrait of Paris and an homage to the noirish American films of the 40s and early 50s. Especially John Huston's ""Asphalt Jungle.""

Roger Duchesne is Bob, a courtly gangster with a natty style not unlike the late mobster kingpin Gotti, who plans on robbing the Deauville casino. But the film is not so much about the details of Bob's one last heist as it is about playing with the genre itself. Bob is a dark knight with a code of loyalty that conflicts with the amorality of his profession just as the filmmaker Melville toys with the makings of a new film tradition. A terrific film that beats the old and new versions of ""Ocean's Eleven.""

This new digital transfer, like all Criterion discs, is superb. Extras include an interview with Daniel Cauchy (""Paulo"") and a radio interview with director Melville, who was so enamored of American culture that he took the last name of Moby Dick's author.",1026864000,24,1721,4.827118644067797
679178,4,6303495591,"He's vain and he's broke but he looks out for his friends.
Yep. It's French film noir yet the protagonist is involved rather than existentially detatched. He's (gasp!) likeable.
 Which is why the young hood imitates him---they tease him by calling him 'Bob' too---and the cops respect him. Besides he's too busy scraping together gambling money to affect a tough guy persona. He's cool without trying.
This one's a gem of stylized realism. Gritty without being grimy. The denizens of Montmatre that inhabit  Melville's film may be sewer rats but they behave with panache. They are losers but never bitter. The most hardened yet romantic bunch of bad guys you're ever likely to encounter.
The one sour note is what time has done to this film. It has copied it endlessly. Do not be surprised if you feel deja vu when watching it for the first time. It's hard to name all the other flicks have ripped off bits and pieces of the plot throughout the years.
 What is that saying about the sincerest form of flattery?",1026345600,5,1010,4.694915254237288

Regardless, this film(and Melville's other films) are just so damn cool I can't blame P.T. This is a very interesting take on a gangster film. Apparently, Melville changed it from more of a heist-focused movie once he saw ASPHLT JUNGLE(Melville had been working on it when John Huston's film came out). Bob is a great character and this is a great dvd! Thanks Criterion(now bring out LE DOULOS andI'll be really happy!)!",1018828800,7,581,4.762376237623762

Bob is cool like Serge Gainsbourg is cool.
Like Mitchum.
Like Bogart.
In fact it's a tragedy that Melville never got to make a picture with Mitchum.
Bob is who Johnny Depp might get to be when he grows up.
Jean-Pierre Melville is the director that the video store clerk aka Q Tarantino has ripped off more times than you have fingers and toes. Camus and Chandler with a camera.
Beautifully shot by Henri Decae (not sure on the spelling)whom Wenders hunted down to shoot Wings of Desire.
Melville will make you forget everytime Hollywood has broken your movie-loving heart(and taken your...bucks).

679181,5,6303495591,"After watching Bob le Flambeur, everything else is a disappointment. The actors are so gripping, the cinematograpy and editing are handled so brilliantly, it makes one wish all films were as good as this. Gritty, realistic, romantic, poetic...all these things don't even begin to sum up the genius of Melville's masterpiece. Roger Duchesne as Bob le Flambeur is one of the coolest creations in movie history. You'll love this guy...he's a true 'knight errant' as the offical review says.
The only complaint I do have is not about the film itself but the subtitles. Whoever did them needs to study their French...I speak both languages and I can tell you the translation is terrible! It doesn't begin to capture the irony or the cool nonchalance of the language- the summing up in simplistic English makes the film seem almost boring. I probably wouldn't have liked it half as much if the subtitles were all I had to go by. Somebody fix this monstrosity!",1005955200,3,953,4.852760736196319
679182,5,6303495591,"If 'Bob le Flambeur' is known at all today it is as inspiration for the New Wave, with its cheap location shooting, its cinephilia (especially american) and its dismantling of genre.  In this, it is perhaps even more successful than 'A Bout de Souffle' - despite Godard's best efforts, he is defeated by the charisma of his stars.
Melville called 'Bob' a 'comedy of manners', and it is much lighter in tone than his later, more famous gangster films.  As the title suggests, it is Bob's gambling, rather than criminality, that is important - look at how the circle of the roulette wheel and horses shape the film's imagery and structure.
There is a tragic gangster plot, a heist, an Oedipal conflict, but they co-exist with the comedy, a dream modernism and a documentary evocation of 1950s Montmartre (its nightclubs, neon lights and cacophony of sounds (three years before 'Touch of Evil')) and Deauville (its casinos and beaches).

Thats when he decides to sidestep some good advice and rob a casino.  Chatter amongst associates, friends and acquaintances leads to a tight spot and some ill-advised moves lead to some dire consequences.  Bob le Flambeur is not a very fast paced film.  Melville certainly takes his time coaxing out the films atmosphere, and he does a commendable job of maintaining that atmosphere throughout as well, and the strong ensemble creates a very lived in and authentic environment.

This movie moved very slowly and did not develop any real tension until almost the end.  And that tension was essentially created by two women--each separately taking an action that jeopardized the success of the heist.  I do not want to spoil the movie, so I will not be too specific.  But neither woman was directly involved in the planned heist; each simply had a relationship with a man who was.  I did not like the fact that the movie created the tension solely in this way.  Actually, at the very, very end something else does not go according to plan, which makes for an interesting twist (really THE twist of the movie).

It's true this is not a caper flick.  It's a great movie.  It's a love letter to Montmartre, an examination of what honor is for a gambler, and it has a fantastic final twist that's been copied in many other movies.

Melville used the idea of America (that the gambler is named Bob is important here) as a means to reflect on the possibilities of honor among men (he's not particularly interested in women, although he doesn't dislike them per se) after World War Two.

679377,4,6303495591,"""Bob Le Flambeur"" (Bob the Gambler), (1955), is a black and white classic of the French cinema, a hard-boiled crime thriller, one of the atmospheric gangster pictures that French directors seem to make so well.  In an intelligent, witty, and understated drama by the noted Jean-Pierre Melville, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Samourai-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000AQKUG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Samourai - Criterion Collection</a>), Bob (Roger Duchesne) is a gangster who's done jail time, and an addicted gambler.  He's also an addicted smoker, but then, everyone smokes like chimneys in this flick: let's face it, the French are known for their love of smoking. At any rate, Bob is an empathetic and compassionate man who plays father figure to young street kids Paolo (Daniel Cauchy) and femme fatale Anne (Isabelle Corey). When Bob runs out of money, these three hatch a plan to rob a Deauville casino, despite the warnings of a friendly cop.

The film's a bit slow in getting its wheels going, but is never less than fascinating to look at, as Bob and his friends turn out nattily dressed every  time, in suits, white shirts and ties, the de rigueur trench coats and fedoras that define the gangster flick internationally.  We watch Bob drive his big, flashy, 1950's tail finned American Chevy convertible through lively Montmartre, long a redoubt of the sailor, the prostitute and the pimp, the working class and the criminals that prey on it.  This area of Paris is shown as being shabby, but busy 24 hours a day, with nightclubs, dance halls, bars, stray GIs, petty hoods, casual sex, news stands, late-night gambling.  The bare and wintry seaside Deauville, beautifully caught by the director, stands in sharp contrast to his loving Paris cityscape.  Its beaches are raw, unimproved, and deserted.  In fact, Deauville seems caught in an earlier era: horse-drawn carts still ply its main streets.

In 2003, acclaimed Irish director Neil Jordan remade the picture as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Thief/dp/B00009WVT3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Thief</a>, starring Nick Nolte as Bob Montagnet, a middle-aged gambler caught up in the well-known gritty underworld of Nice, France, the town which produced Alain Delon, the very handsome French film star of LE SAMOURAI, who was always rumored to have underworld connections. (As, according to a post at IMDb, the star of ""Bob,"" Roger Duchesne, had.)  Be that as it may, when Nolte's efforts to free himself from his addictions to drugs and gambling fail, he hatches a plan to rob a Monte Carlo casino.  This film is, of course, in color, and it should be noted that the mild climate of the Mediterranean makes this picture a lot prettier to watch than the dreary winter Deauville of the French original.  It's certainly worth a look to anyone who enjoys casino/heist pictures.

But the Melville original was essential in setting the protocols of all the many heist/gangster pictures that have followed it.",1296432000,,3069,5.47457627118644
679378,4,6303495591,"I would say that BOB LE FLAMBEUR is a very good film, but somehow not as satisfying as Neil Jordan's remake THE GOOD THIEF, with Nick Nolte.",1295913600,,140,4.222222222222222
679379,3,6303495591,"The Bottom Line:

Melville made his living crafting films like this but Bob le Flambeur can't hold a candle to other offerings like the masterful Army of Shadows: it shows a good deal of creativity in setting up the central heist (I particularly enjoyed the scene in which the men plan out the bank on a soccer field, using lime to sketch out teller's desks and so on) but never really develops enough urgency to make it a compelling or fast-moving film.

679381,4,6303495591,"I saw Le Samourai recently and liked it a lot.  I read up on Jean Pierre Melville and learned that Bob Le Flambeur was considered by many cineastes to be one of his masterpieces.  So perhaps I expected too much...and was a little disappointed.  Le Samourai had Alain Delon who was a much more watchable actor than Roger DuChesne.  Apparently Melville had very little money at the time he made this film and couldn't afford high priced actors.

It is certainly stylish and fun to watch for its '50's Montmartre underworld atmosphere.  The scenes at the casino at Deauville were great, too, especially the final one where Bob wins big.  The faces of the other players are terrific!

The interview with Daniel Couchy, who plays Paulo is interesting.  He states that he really doesn't see why so many people love this film.  I have to agree with him.  It's obviously historically important for the innovations made in technique--the hand-held camera, etc.  Lovers of film will find much to like here.  For me, it was not as enjoyable as Le Samouri.",1189641600,2,1044,4.733333333333333
679382,4,6303495591,"This displaced American film noir movie was made by French auteur Jean-Pierre Melville. It has a white-haired leading man (Roger Duchesne) who, Bogart-like, wears a wide-brim hat and a trenchcoat. He's a gambler with ethics (such as his hatred of pimps). But, when things get desperate for him, he falls back on his failed career of 20 years before - robbery - this time of a casino.

Usually I find the heist in Melville films the most interesting part, but this time I preferred the early, mood-setting scenes of this movie in which the gambler strolls thru Montmarte streets between the backroom gambling dens and his home and haunts. And I liked his efforts to aid a wayward young woman -- primarily because that woman was played by Isabel Corey. The detailed heist was interesting, and there's a cool and cruel twist at the end.

As usual, Melville's direction is top notch. The pacing, as usual, is very deliberate. Financial desperation on Melville's part forced him to cast minor actors, so the faces were unknown to me - but I wish Isabel Corey's wasn't. Forget Bardot or Loren. Corey put most European sex kittens of the time in the shade (altho, it seems she could barely act).

The Criterion DVD has a couple extras. The best is a recent interview with aging Daniel Cauchy who played the young man in this film. He has a lot of interesting information (such as how this film qualifies as his third and seventh film). Also available is a radio interview with Melville but the American host formulated obtuse questions that would challenge an American much less Frenchman Melville. I gave up on that one part way in.

I've since learned that Roger Duchesne (""Bob"") had been accused of working with the Gestapo during the war. That may explain why this and his only other post-war film were made some 10 years later. How ironic that he's the star of one of the most admired and influential movies to come out of France.",1184889600,4,1928,4.678466076696165
679383,4,6303495591,"Jean-Pierre Melville's ""Bob le Flambeur"" (1955) has been often called the first film of the French New Wave. First or not, French New Wave or not, ""Bob le Flambeur"" is one of the coolest and memorable films I've seen. The most fascinating element of this exquisite crime/dram/noir film is its title character, Bob Montagne- Bob the Gambler (Roger Duchesne). All women wanted to be with him and all young men wanted to be him. He was the man well respected and liked by the cops, the criminals, and the gamblers alike - the king of cool, the elegant loser with his own respectable code of honor. He drove an American car and wore an American hat but he belonged to the streets of Montmartre, Paris, where he was born just as the film itself that could've been only made by a French director who admired American films and had created a perfect blend of American gangster film and French sophisticated comedy of manners. Made back in 1955, the movie is fresh, crisp, sensual, modern and simply delightful. Having watched already all ""Ocean's"" movies, including Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack's classic, I see where the inspiration for them came from. ""Bob Le Falmbeur"" was released in the USA in 1982, nine years after Melville's death and became an instant cult hit. Often, cult movies are not the best made but it is not true in the case of ""Bob le Flambeur"". Its direction is perfect: seemingly simple and truly elegant, its cinematography is beautiful, its music score is amazing and its characters are not the caricatures - they are the real human beings of flesh and blood and they have something (or a lot) to lose. Acting is great by everyone with Roger Duchesne unforgettable and Isabelle Corey as a young streetwalker Anne whom Bob took under his wing, absolutely marvelous in her first role - child-like innocent yet already perfectly aware of her powers over the men, by the words of Bob's friend, ""she will go far -she knows what she wants but does not show it"".",1182211200,4,1973,4.672413793103448

Bob le flambeur is a joy to watch because the movie is not afraid to take it's time in telling it's story. Not to say that the movie is slow, the pacing let's you soak up the atmosphere and the feel of things. When a movie of this kind is well done (as it is the case here)you get caught by it and you will always find yourself with a renew desire to watch it again.

679470,4,6303495591,"""Bob le Flambeur"" is a much-lauded precursor to the French New Wave directed and co-written by Jean-Pierre Melville. The street shots, hand-held cameras, and rhythm were New Wave before the Wave arrived. Bob Montagne (Roger Duchesne) is an ex-hood and inveterate gambler down on his luck. He enjoys the friendship of Paris Police Lieutenant Ledru (Guy Decomble) who once sent him to prison. Paulo (Daniel Cauchy), a young protege, looks up to him. And Bob's protective instinct has moved him to take in teenaged prostitute Anne (Isabelle Corey), who proves irresistible to Paulo. But Bob is broke. When he learns that the Deauville Casino will have an enormous sum of money in its safe on Grand Prix Day, Bob plots with old friend and safecracker Roger (Andre Garet) to heist the casino.

Jean-Pierre Melville's admiration for American crime films of the 1940s and gangster films of the 1930s is evident in ""Bob le Flambeur"". This film looks back to a pre-War underworld culture at the same time it looks forward to the New Wave. ""Bob le Flambeur"" had a modest reception when it was released in 1955 but became the object of much admiration in the 1960s. The film is vaguely plotted, the characters barely written, and the acting ranges from adequate to bad. I don't see anything brilliant here, but the film's style is the main attraction. Its amateurishness is very much a part of that style, along with location shooting and a rhythm derived from the streets. I was immediately intrigued by the backgrounds that are almost constantly enveloped in fog, causing the figures in the foreground to stand out sharply against the murky features behind them.

The female characters are conspicuously hollow -not surprising, as Melville gravitated toward men's stories. Young Anne and the wife (Colette Fleury) of croupier Jean are plot devices. They are two-faced, stupid, and pathologically selfish. And that's it. They exist to throw a monkey wrench into the men's plans. And Anne brings some sex to the film. Their motives are incomprehensible and, I think, actually nonexistent. The vacuousness of these two non-characters is conspicuous in Bob's mostly male world. I think fans of the New Wave will be fascinated by ""Bob le Flambeur"", while others will not be. It has more to offer as a style that reflects and anticipates the intellectual and social movements of a certain time and place than it has story or characters. ""Bob le Flambeur"" was remade as ""The Good Thief"" in 2003. Although its approach to the heist is more conventional and ""Hollywood"", the depth of characters and acting are better in ""The Good Thief"".

The DVD (Criterion Collection 2002): Bonus features are 2 interviews and a theatrical trailer (3 1/2 min). ""Daniel Cauchy Interview"" (22 min), conducted in 2002 by Lenny Borger, is interesting and worthwhile. Cauchy, who played Paulo, talks about working with Jean-Pierre Melville, the trials of shooting intermittently over a 2-year period, the underworld culture that Melville wrote about, the film's themes, and filming his death scene. In French with English subtitles. ""Jean-Pierre Melville Radio Interview"" (20 min) was conducted in 1961 by Gideon Bachmann for his ""Film Art"" radio show. Melville discusses what attracted him to American filmmaking, his style as a predecessor to the Nouvelle Vague, his approach to filmmaking, and themes. In English and French. Film is in French with optional English subtitles.",1167782400,,3440,5.095744680851064
679471,4,6303495591,"Bob Le Flambeur tells the tale of a life-long gambler who has his ups & downs (more ""downs"" as of late) with the cards, but keeps as steady a pace as his modest means can afford him. He lives in a semi-posh neighborhood in Paris, but spends a majority of his time ducking in and out of small card clubs and dive bars to catch his next gamble. Bob is also a mentor to a younger, hipper guy named Paulo who aims to be Bob personified.

Bob's (and everyone else's) troubles begin when he befriend's Anne, a fresh-faced street-walker, who takes Bob for just another well-off guy who wants to lavish the young lolita with gifts for sex, but is genuinely curious about her motivations in life. The whole relationship (if you could call it one) is very light and platonic, with Bob giving her a place to stay (she had just been hopping from bed to bed) while he stays out all day gambling. He introduces Anne to Paulo and he falls for her, of course. She could care less about who she's with as long as they spoil her, but Paulo is young and foolish and confides in her one night in bed about a fantastic heist Bob has planned on a regional casino, despite Bob's friendly warning.

The next night, Anne has too much to drink and relays Paulo's bombastic promise to spoil her after the heist to a local pimp named Marc she's about to sleep with. Marc's plan to utilize his strong pimp hand on Anne is put on the back burner, as he needs to give this new-found information to the police in order to keep himself out of jail for beating up his own wife (who he's also pimping out). Everything falls on one long night, laying in wait to pull the heist.

Although Bob Le Flambeur isn't as gripping as the aforementioned heist films, it does paint a brilliant picture. Bob's quid pro quo with Inspector Ledru could very well be the inspiration for the modern heist classic Heat's DeNiro-Pacino t?te-?-t?te.

Simply stated, this is an important film in the history  of World Cinema, but most important, it remains a very enjoyable film in its own right some 50 years later. Don't miss this one!",1138492800,2,376,4.611940298507463
679473,5,6303495591,"'Bob le Flambeur', along with Melville's other classic 'Le Samourai', ranks among my favorite films of all time. Melville put beauty in the life of a criminal in the same way Jean Genet brought immortality to his imprisoned heroic figures. But Bob le Flambeur is someone who lives by a certain ethical code - like Marlon Brando's character in 'the Godfather' he only wants to look out for those who are close to him - and he does not seem like the kind of guy who would start a fight unless someone came looking for trouble. This is classic noir - something the French New Wave would soon embrace (not nearly as effectively as Melville does here). But despite all the noir elements of the movie, Melville seems to be equally concerned with making his characters human beings. He shows them doing their daily activities - like brushing there teeth - these people are easy to identify with. I would recommend this movie to anyone - but especially those who find it hard to watch big box office studio productions that repeat the same tired plots and techniques only to lose sight of what really makes a film resonate.",1133913600,,1115,4.608040201005025
679474,5,6303495591,"Since some  years ago , Bob , a delinquent in the fifties great amateur to game has been a timeless looser . He meets a teenager just before to fall in prostitution and decides rescue her , he gives some money and receives her in his home . But at once Paulo a orphan and homeless young man will fall in love with her . Very soon he will be inspired for a ambitious plan , and organizes with supreme shyness and coordination every little detail concerned with the master robe but ironically the fate once more makes a raid . the rest runs for your own .

This film constitutes the first policiac title of Jean Pierre Melville and stamps the irruption amazingly mature of a style simply unconfoundable. The firmness of its building and the perfection of its calligraphy are factors which convert it in an self determined entity valuable and bty itself, despite of the relayionship that you can establish with other next work.

Bob le flambeur attends more the instant than the globality , it is much more a cronicle than a spectacularly dramatized account. The movie seems to be made under the fascination of the american cinema . The film gives out a freeing and liberty , such trust in the expressive power of the image , made in equal parts of rules knowing and instint for ignore them . The raccords and the axis are not at all barriers which imprison the narrative freedom .

You will watch a Montmartre flood of heterogeneous night fauna . What Bob experiences in his lucky game was described for Kafka as the most dangerous of the tasks: to remeet and remake oneself in front of a mirror image pierced in a fragment of crystal .

The tragedy is variegated with a comedy patine , which turns in a more real perspective with that life tricks , these unknown crossroads set in the road as an army of naked demons. Undoubtly we are in the presence of a immortal work , timeless and deeply revealer of those times . And notice that Rififi was released the same year too .

The candor of the characters depicted and the soft breeze of a nocturnal Paris with its little madness and and caprices make of this film a supreme jewel and one of the pioneers films of the fifties in all the story of the cinema",1094688000,7,2203,4.413793103448276
679475,4,6303495591,"Warning:  this is NOT an action movie.  You will be disappointed if you're expecting to see a lot of details surrounding the planning and execution of a major heist.  Get Rififi if that's what you want.
'Bob' is stylish, leisurely paced, and NOT a caper flick (or barely qualifies as one).  The film is not about a heist, it is about Mr. Bob and his all-consuming passion for gambling.  Gambling is his sustenance, his downfall, and his savior.  Women only seem to bring trouble (except for Yvonne, the cafe owner).  How he acts and thinks, his values and judgments, are part of the old world of gangster-gentlemen which doesn't exist any more.  It is, like many French films, a study in character, and what an interesting character it is!",1058140800,4,739,4.674418604651163
679476,3,6303495591,"Wonderful to look at with nice shots of Montmatre at night and a good opening during a Paris dawn.  Also, the ""bad"" girl Anne is worth looking at twice.
But the story is full of holes and bad editing especially in the last 15 minutes. And this is to the detriment of the film in such a way as to render the film no more than a stylish exercise as opposed to a true heist film or noir classic.
If your intent is to look at pioneering film of the French New Wave or to see how the French appreciate Hollywood film noir, then by all means RENT it.
But if you want to see a wonderfully realized French heist movie of the same period with a true understanding of noir, then find yourself a copy of Jules Dassin's RIFIFI, which is a far superior movie.",1042416000,6,746,4.109589041095891

It's great to now own this film on DVD. Lots of good extra features, including an audio interview with the director (from 1960) and a brand new filmed interview with one of the stars.

7850027,3,6303495591,"The movie starts slowly but picks up later. The title character is an ex-con gambler living in a swank apartment and driving a fancy convertible. Having served time for a bank robbery, he has gone straight, and even shows disdain for a pimp who begs him for help. His life consists of going to various gambling establishments where he sometimes wins fortunes and other times loses them. He picks up a supposedly innocent woman off the streets and sets her up with a friend of his, and after losing too much money in a gambling round, he plots to rob a casino, and even gathers up a team of criminals to help him and gets information from unwilling people.

Except things go wrong. The pimp is told by the police to come up with information for them or face prosecution, and a croupier at the casino is blackmailed into helping...and then his wife learns of this. Will all the planning come to naught? A dark film noir, but not overdone in terms of violence or twists and turns. And the ending is a surprise, but not a hokey one.",1479945600,,1028,4.439153439153439

Melville became the master of the criminal underworld gangster pictures, with Bob Le Flambeur. This is not only one of the best gangster films ever made, but one of the best films period.
