2334572,5,B0009XRZRE,"Beautiful love story but no as goos as Apuesta por un amor. But still a very beautiful story.  If you like telenovelas this is a great one. Should also try Apuesta Por Un Amor, Fuego en la sangre, Pasion de Gavilanes, And Amor Real.  Great stories and English subtitled. For those of us who speak little spanish.

Las grandes historias e ingls subtitularon. Para los de nosotros que hablan poco espaol.",1252627200,,402,4.633802816901408
2334573,5,B0009XRZRE,"Esta novela fue un regalo que hice, as que voy a escribir lo que mi amigo me dijo:

En esta edicin de Mi Destino Eres T han capturado los mejores momentos de la telenovela sin pecar en omitir partes escenciales que ayudan al desenlace de la trama de la novela.
Lo nico que no comparto es que la cancin original no est en la versin para el dvd, la versin que est en el dvd no tiene la suficiente fuerza para que haga coherencia con la trama.

La recomiendo, ya que no dej de perder ningn momento fuerte que le pone ese picante a la historia. Excelente actuacin de Lucero y la de Jorge Salinas.",1244937600,,592,4.139130434782609
2334574,5,B0009XRZRE,"Lucero's great in this movie.  She's also a great singer.

Jorge Salinas is also really good in this movie.  I first saw him in ""Maria de la noche"".

I don't speak spanish but I do know french so this movie's pretty good for learning spanish.

I'm soooo glad this DVD has english subtitles because I love latin soaps.  Too bad not all spanish soaps have english subtitles.",1243036800,,372,4.477611940298507
2334575,4,B0009XRZRE,"I loved Jamie Camil in La Fea Mas Bella, and he is playing a less enchanting but well-played role in this telenovela that kept me, and my mom, coming back for more.

Lucero is beautiful and moral but constantly challenged with ghosts from the past. How evil can one old man be? What deceit can lurk in the hearts of those who are supposed to love us?  The dangers of rape, abortion, worker's rights, and organized crime all play a role in this wonderful show.

You do miss a lot from the original series that gets shown to you in flashbacks. I did not see the original, and I do not speak Spanish well at all, but I could tell the subtitles weren't perfect.  Despite the faults, I really enjoyed this program and recommend it.",1240876800,,726,4.355555555555555
2334576,4,B0009XRZRE,Just that some parts were cut out.  Need to keep it with the orginal version.,1225411200,,77,4.133333333333334
2334577,4,B0009XRZRE,"Mi Destino eres tu had a good story but like most soaps the execution feel short. The story is about a young sucessful attorney Andrea whose husband dies during their honeymoon. Accused of foulplay Andrea is shocked to learn that her husband died of a brain hemmorage and almost breaks down with grief until Eduardo who feels a connection to her represents her as  an attorney. Aiding her through the toughest week of her life Eduarado helps Andrea with the legal proceedings but unfortunately destiny pulls him away from her but when he learns that his wife has suffered a car crash and may die. 2 years have passed and Andrea is hired as a sucessful attorney for a prestigious construction company Still heartbroken Andrea vows never to love another man again after suffering the loss of her husband. But she catches the eye of the handsome womanizer Mauricio who is the son and owner of the Construction Company. Vowing to seduce the innocent Andrea he makes a bet with his best friend that Andrea will fall right into his hands and into his bed. But Destiny intervenes and instead of Mauricio being the hunter he becomes the prey as Andrea teaches him the power of love something Mauricio has never encountered before. Yet Destiny intervenes again when Eduardo reenters Andreas life. Although still married to his comatose wife Eduardo is heartbroken as he learns that his wife was having an affair prior to the accident. He too shuns love until he sees Andrea again and learns that she is working for the same Construction law firm as himself. Unwilling to lose the opportunity of developing a relationship with Andrea, Eduardo begins to fight for Andrea. Seeing as both men are unwilling to let her go Andrea is forced by Destiny to choose the one man who will share her destiny. Thus begins Mi Destino eres tu. A wonderful enjoyable novela that you should buy if you are a hardtime novela fan or rent if your not. If you did not see the story in Univision during 1999-2000 soap season when it premiered then you may have some questions regarding some of the story arcs as poor editing took major plot lines that were important. What really angered me was that they did not show the original theme song for the soap. Lucero who stars in the novela sings the original version. If you want to see the original opening you can watch it on youtube. The only reason why I got the DVD was because of that FINE Latin Man Jaime Camil. This is Camil's first telenovela and he plays as the villainous Mauricio from the beginning Camil brings human quality to the role where in instances you almost wish for Andrea to choose his character. Accompanied with Mexicos finest actors such as Jacqueline Andere, Joaquin Codero, Marta Sorte, Jan, Sherilyn, Mauricio Islas, Susana Zabaleta and of course Lucero and Jorge Salinas the novela is great to watch during the weekends or on rainy days.",1166227200,9,2882,4.695652173913044
2334578,3,B0009XRZRE,"I did not enjoy this telenovela so much because the story was too unrealistic and the actors, especially the male protagonist did not convince me",1163116800,,145,4.84
2334579,4,B0009XRZRE,"I've never been fond of novellas.  Quite frankly, I thought they were dumb, cheesy, and overly melodramatic. Then i spotted this DVD in a store and I decided I thought I'd give a novella a chance.  I'm glad I did.  Mi Destino Eres Tu is simply amazing! I was hooked on every minute of it. Especially after the early death in the novella.  While the entire series was heavily edited, it doesn't seem so until the 2nd disc.  Instead tHe first disc is an edge of your seat experience and the characters are great.  Lucero was great as Andrea and quite frankl;y I wish I could've seen the novella in its entirety.  I wouldn't mind shelling the bucks for it too.  (come on telivisa, release them complete!).  THe theme song is superb and made me fall in love with the novella even before I began watching it.  There are suprisingly a decent amount of special features.  Overall it was a great buy and I'm truly glad to add this DVD set to my collection as one of my favorites!",1136505600,16,971,4.368715083798882

8069638,5,B0009XRZRE,Muy buena pero al editarlas siempre pierden algo de la trama.,1423267200,,61,4.636363636363637
8069639,2,B0009XRZRE,"I'll give 2 stars for the actors and Novellas.....but amazon needs to tell the people selling these product to let their EDITORS know how disappointing buyer are; not because the show wasn't good but the editing was very bad! They should at least give buyers the option to choose from an edited version and unedited version. People will pay to have the unedited version. Please, please, please.....",1407801600,,398,4.955223880597015
8069640,5,B0009XRZRE,I speak Spanish but it get's rusty if I don't review it occasionaly. This was a good one for that purpose.,1396051200,,106,4.095238095238095
8069641,5,B0009XRZRE,Me encanto esta novela. Es una de mis favoritas. Lucero se ve tan joven y los otros actores tambien. A mi me gusta calidad y esta novela lo tenia.,1390608000,,146,4.068965517241379
8069642,1,B0009XRZRE,One DVD was missing.  There is  nothing worse than to miss out a part of a movie or novela. I could not return it because my time to return had expired! This is not the product you can just check right away unless you watch the whole thing...Novelas take hours to watch,1360627200,,269,4.153846153846154
8069643,1,B0009XRZRE,"We are very disappointed, two times I have purchased this product for my mom and twice I have ordered what she wanted; 'Mi destino eres tu' PART#1, and twice we have gotten the part#2, we sent an email to this company, called and nothing they have done, Why? we are still waiting for an answer.",1297728000,,294,4.363636363636363
8069644,3,B0009XRZRE,"Esta es la Primer Telenovela que Compro en Dvd sin haberla visto anteriormente en Television en forma completa, asi que emitire mi opinion en base a lo que se.
El Dvd no contiene el Tema Original de la Novela, que era interpretado por Lucero, Mi Destino Eres Tu, tiene otro que lo canta un Hombre, pero no tiene la fuerza ni la interpretacion como la de Lucero, no hay comparacion alguna, cosa que me molesto un poco. Esto paso como en otras ediciones que le cambiaron la Entrada, ademas esta cancion de Lucero fue un Exito, no solo por la Novela si no por su Disco Mi Destino. El Problema es Televisa que no paga los Derechos de las canciones, por lo cual le ponen una musica barata, que no es lo mismo y muchas veces en otros Dvds ponen una musica encima de la otra en las Ediciones, lo cual hace imposible entender los dialogos de las escenas, un tema que aun sigue siendo un problema y que no lo han mejorado.
Algo a destacar sobre la Edicion es que es bastante buena, al menos yo note coherencia en las escenas, si bien no la vi completa por television, hay 2 escenas que si se notan que faltan, mas bien por otros dialogos que las mencionan, pero no es nada importante como para que afecte en algo a la Edicion.
El Final esta editado y no esta una de las escenas de Ema y Andrea, cuando Ema la tortura tirandole un vaso de Whisky a Andrea en la cara y a su vez le confiesa como mato a Sofia mientras piensa en como deshacerse de ella y tampoco esta el tema de Andrea Bocelli por ti volare en la escena del casamiento, sobre la parte final, que en la version televisiva si lo tenia.
Otra cosa a destacar es que no tiene la misma musica incidental original en las escenas del Dvd. Pero pese a eso, de 40 Minutos que dura el Ultimo Capitulo, Originalmente en Television, que lo tengo en Video, dejan mas de 20 minutos, que esta bastante bien, y se entiende sin perder detalles importantes, y tiene un desenlace normal. Lo que si no esta y podrian dejarlo, son los Creditos Finales, despues del Fin, que en Television lo pasan y en el Dvd no lo dejan. Tiene Creditos pero en el Menu del Dvd, que no son los Originales, esto pasa en varias telenovelas, sobre todo en las que se titulan: Telenovelas Clasicas. En cuando al Producto/Dvd me llego bastante feo, los discos rayados, sobre todo el disco 1, que esta muy maltratado de ambos lados, me da muchos problemas para poder verlo, pero eso me pasa con el Lado A, sobre todo en el comienzo que se tranca horriblemente, y se congela la imagen en varias partes, pero despues, sin ser eso el otro lado funciona. El Dvd 2 de ambas caras esta rayado pero se ve bien.",1288224000,3,2612,4.2894736842105265
8069645,5,B0009XRZRE,"I am in the midst of practicing my Spanish, and I came across this telenovela...since it had English subtitles..I figured I would give it a try and I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID!!!

The storyline is great (although if you try to explain it to anyone who hasn't seen it..they will look at you like you are crazy!) and the video really allows the characters to come through.  I'll be honest, I didn't watch it when it was on tv, so I'm not sure how the editing is, which is a common complaint about these sorts of videos.  But I thought that all the necessary parts were represented.  I never felt lost or questioning anything.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end, it's great acting...the characters are interesting and you can relate to them(even the bad guys).

I would suggest that anyone and everyone watch this telenovela, it was amazingly enjoyable and if you want an opportunity to listen to Spanish to practice..it's great.",1283904000,2,923,4.5636363636363635
