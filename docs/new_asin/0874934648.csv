171927,3,0874934648,"The 2009 edition of this book was required for the BLS class I took before going into externship for a medical assisting program. We found out in class (which was for just one day) that the American Heart Association had come out with new procedures (this was back in June, 2011), mainly that you can now use just chest compressions without necessarily doing breaths. Our instructor gave us handouts and showed a new film. I guess if you can do the class with a few handouts, you probably don't absolutely need a book. Wish we had been informed before class so that we could get refunds. So this book is no longer useful if you're going to get BLS certification under the current guidelines.",1315526400,2,691,4.580645161290323
171928,4,0874934648,"It's definitely a great book for the updated AHA 2010 CPR guidelines; however, I believe that you could learn the same information in class without prepping first. Amazon has it reasonably priced.",1313193600,,196,5.15625
171929,5,0874934648,Completed a class at Highline using this book and it was an excellent in case of an emergency.  I purchased this book to keep in my first aid pack for my vehicle.  I want to be prepared and this is a great first step.  I'm thankful Amazon has everything I am looking for at great prices.,1312761600,,287,4.089285714285714
171930,5,0874934648,"It's a well written book. In the edition I got, it's a little outdated. Make sure you get the latest copy because AHA have changed recommendation of doing CPR.",1311638400,,159,4.517241379310345
171931,4,0874934648,This book came right away and in perfect condition.  The pocket card is very useful to refer to when you are out in the real world and not in the class.,1307577600,,152,3.903225806451613
171932,1,0874934648,"Sure, it's got color coded sections. Sure, the Table of Contents is decent.  Fine.  But the sections are in totally illogical order, the format is confusing and not standardized, there's NO INDEX, the color coding is not used correctly, and much of the technical information is vague.

Why not put a section at the front of the book detailing all of the medical equipment such as AED's?  No, they decided to stick the whole AED section way at the back of the book, next to the section on choking.  LAME organization.

Why was it written so poorly?  Because it was written by medical professionals.  I'm an English teacher, and we all know that people in the sciences can't write worth a damn.  Just because you're a smarty-pants doctor does NOT mean you know how to do technical writing. This book is more confusing than helpful.  It could have been so much better!",1299196800,,865,4.631578947368421

171937,4,0874934648,I should not have thrown away my BLS and ACLS course books from my residency PGY3 year! I had to buy these books again to recertify. Anyway the book is good as usual although people say the AHA is coming out with a new version this year.,1282694400,,237,4.0638297872340425

171945,5,0874934648,"The book came in perfect condition and included a student cd for video learning.  The content itself is a bit redundant and tends to jump around.  This makes learning, the exact process of CPR, like trying to follow a maze.  ""Dumbing down"" the presentation of the processes in the book may be a smart consideration for the American Heart Association.",1255392000,,350,4.8
171946,5,0874934648,This book is exactly what I needed. It's the current book used for American Heart BLS for Healthcare provider classes.,1252108800,,118,4.95
171947,5,0874934648,"Needed this manual to renew my BLS certification. The American Heart Association suggests 3 sources to purchase this item; all charged ridiculous shipping. Paying $7.95 shipping for an $11.00 book? FREE ship at Amazon with super saver shipping. SWEET!! Anyway, the manual is awesome, everything you need to know to get certified in Basic Life Support, and also excellent if you just want to learn how to provide CPR, use an automated external defibrillator, relieve a choking victim. The CD ROM is great for those who like the visual reinforcement of the text. BE AWARE-there are those out there selling the older manuals that do not reflect updates in practice. This is the most current version from 2006. I am guessing the committee will meet in the next couple of years to update if necessary.",1244592000,44,796,4.9037037037037035
