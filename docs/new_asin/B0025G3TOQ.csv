8351049,4,B0025G3TOQ,"I loved this British movie. It has wonderful camerawork, great locations, and fantastic actors. The director succeeded in making the mansion appear eerie and mysterious. You definitely felt like something is ""off"" throughout the whole movie.

The story is subtle and slow. Warning: this drama is not for those who like a faster pace--it does seem like that there is a whole lot of nothing going on. Elliot Graham, the eighth richest guy in Britain, hires Joe, a young nonjudgmental observer but slightly dim, to serve as a doorman of his deceased father's elaborate vacant mansion. Elliot is anxious and wants to figure out how his father got his start in building his wealth. Joe makes a few surprising friendships. I suspect that only a select few will enjoy the journey.",1300752000,7,773,4.900763358778626
