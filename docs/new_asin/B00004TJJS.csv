1350397,4,B00004TJJS,"I rented this movie at first because I like Patrick Stewart. I was a bit surpised that he would be in such a typical genre piece, but I figured it would be a harmless way to pass a slow Friday night at home. Well needless to say this movie soon turned out to be much more. Is he really rational? Is he a victim of mental decline? Is he paranoid? Is it a tale of political conspiracy or just a rather sad tale of a man who is going quickly into the darkness? I'm not telling, but believe me you won't be able to make up your mind until the very end. This story was risky. It goes around between tounge-in-cheek humor, pathos, suspense and mystery, and often such an ambitious undertaking turns into a mishmash, but not this one. This is a fun movie and a very good way to pass a slow evening. When it's over you'll find yourself amazed at how quickly time went by and you just might wonder if your suspicions and fears are all that irrational after all. Enjoy.",975715200,6,959,4.1891891891891895

Also, the acting from everyone in this film was great! The story was awesome, and what a cool concept! I have never seen a movie with a concept quite like this one.

1350417,5,B00004TJJS,This is such an underrated movie.  One of my all time favorites...first of all...well Patrick Stewart.  But there are so many other reasons.  It's suspenseful and humerous and sad and thought provoking all at the same time.  This is not the same story as Denzel's movie.  Lots of subtle signs in the movie that you won't notice until you watched it a time or two.,1468281600,,363,4.523076923076923

1350420,4,B00004TJJS,"Need I say more?

The expressions he brings to the main character in this movie are great, and the supporting cast played there parts well.

The twist at the end, to me, was easy to pick out, but you wouldn't really see it until it starts to build up to the climax.

Excellent movie if you want to watch something a little different from the norm.",1467072000,,347,4.2272727272727275

1350425,3,B00004TJJS,"This was different,  to say the least....  It's hard to put this movie into an exact genre.  Is it mystery, spy, growing old... I couldn't say....

I felt sorry for the main character of the movie for most of the story, as he felt like he was being forced out of his home and pushed into a HOME - until I understand at the end.

Still not sure if the movie makes me sad to believe it can happen (I know it happens every day).

Being that Patrick Stuart was the lead character - I was not expecting this type of movie from him.

BTW - there are two SAFE HOUSE movies and I bought them both.  The other one is more the spy drama type of SAFE HOUSE as I would have expected.",1463011200,,671,3.955223880597015

1350429,5,B00004TJJS,"Great movie! Really gives Patrick Stewart a chance to show the range of his skills as an actor much better than TNG or Dune did.

1350432,5,B00004TJJS,"Honestly one of the best movies I have ever seen. Patrick Stewart beautifully portrays the raw emotion of the character and keeps you in the momentum of every moment.

I'm in the process of retiring my tapes and switching to disc/streaming video. This tape was one that I expected would be one of my last holdouts.

The basic storyline is about a retired man facing the onset of Alzheimer's and his adult daughter's growing concern about his increasingly odd and paranoid behavior. Her father tells her that he is a retired spy and ""they are after him."" To protect himself, he has become a shut-in, afraid to go outside his house/yard. He also conducts ""drills"" with his friend, a handyman who plays along to humor him with his game. The movie treats the issue of Alzheimers and dementia respectfully.  It's well acted, with a talented cast, a refreshingly original story skillfully combining drama with balanced portions of suspense, action and humor. The bonus features are limited to essentially a few brief cast/director interviews and filmographies/previews.

That last may be true, but he's holding it together as best he can for a very good reason: a man he knows is responsible for several murders is now running for president.

As a last ditch effort before locking him up in a mental hospital, his family hires Andy Travers (Kimberly Williams), a grad student in psychology, to be his caretaker so he can stay in his home.

At times you may have this figured for a comedy, because so many of the incidents have a funny side. But believe me, it's a thriller. Patrick Stewart is, as always, brilliant in the role, and got my blood pressure rising in his nude shower scene.

Will Mace be able to save the world from the evil candidate who looks to be a shoe-in for the next president? How can you possibly doubt him?",1336694400,,909,4.496969696969697

SYNOPSIS--
In SAFE HOUSE (1998) a man slowly sinking into Alzheimer's and dementia believes that a presidential candidate is trying to have him killed. He hides at home, often in a secure room, with a sophsticated computer system and security monitors.

His daughter hires a young woman to be her now-erratic dad's keeper/companion while she debates having him committed to a psych hospital. The paranoia plot has a somewhat predictable twist ending, but it's fun getting there. Worth seeing.

1350496,3,B00004TJJS,The order was processed and shipped in a timely manner which was appreciated.  We had seen this movie several times on Hallmark or other channels.  The full DVD contains some scenes not included in the versions we saw but horrible language is also included in the DVD.  That is why I gave the movie only 3 stars.  Without the foul language the movie was terrific.,1268870400,2,363,4.538461538461538
1350497,5,B00004TJJS,"This is one of my favorite movies. I wish there was a way they could make sequels from it.

Patrick Stewart should have won an academy award for his performance in this movie. Excellent acting by all. Excellent story. Excellent directing... I can't think of a single negative in this entire movie. It captures your attention from the beginning to the end.

The story is about a former DIA Agent (Defense Intelligence Agency) who, after living a covert life with a ""Cover story"" career... has retired young with an early case of Alzheimer's. He knows a deadly secret about a Presidential candidate which places his life in jeopardy as well as the lives of other fellow agents who also know the truth about this candidate. But his daughter does not believe him. Everyone thinks his paranoia about his life as an Agent and being in mortal jeopardy is part of his Alzheimer's disease. His daughter does not believe her father was ever in any intelligence position. She only knows his cover story career... thus Stewart's paranoid behavior has her considering having him committed.

It is a pleasure watching Stewart going through his daily security rituals and his ""deadman's switch"" which is his only life insurance policy keeping him alive while all of his former fellow agents are being bumped off, one at a time.

Stewart's character desperately fights the ravages of his disease. His character is much too young, charming, charismatic, talented and handsome to be suffering from such an early onset of this disease as we watch him deteriorating little by little.

A well-written story. We don't know where the danger lurks and at times they have us wondering if he really is ""losing it."" The writing was an excellent work of art. There is not a boring moment in the movie. Patrick Stewart is a pleasure to watch... and his costar who portrayed ""Andy"" is also quite surprising in her acting as well. They react well with each other in this movie.

The movie is exciting, intriguing and a complete surprise in the twists and turns of the plot. The interaction between the characters is phenomenal.

I highly recommend this movie. It is one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure to see.",1266969600,3,2194,4.788359788359788
1350498,5,B00004TJJS,A great movie about what its like to grow old from a secret agents perspective. Patrick Stewart is the man in this movie. if you like spy movie this is a must,1261440000,2,158,3.96875
1350499,4,B00004TJJS,"Perhaps I've said it all in my title.  If you like Mr. Stewart, you'll like this.  It really is about that simple.

Stewart plays Mace Sowell, who, as the Amazon description tells us, plays someone who claims to be a retired intelligence agent.  His family doesn't believe a word of it, and thinks that Mace is suffering from alheimer's disease.  Mace's doctor, played quite effectively here by Hector Elizondo, agrees.

And so we have Mace convinced that the conservative presidential candidate wants him dead, and we're left to observe for ourselves whether that candidate has a good reason for feeling the way he does ... or if Mace really is mentally ill.

The ending of this film is truly well-played.  I truly hope I don't give away anything here, but I must say this:  We end up having a great deal of confidence in Mace, even when common sense tells us we shouldn't.

A well-written screenplay, effective direction, and very strong performances by both Patrick Steward and Kimberly Williams make this a very enjoyable film.",1259539200,2,1031,4.84

1350501,2,B00004TJJS,"While I have always enjoyed watching Patrick Stewart's performances, I have never seen him in something where his use of profanity was extreme or where he did a nude scene.  This was a top-notch thriller superbly acted and directed that needed none of the above to make it well worth watching.  Sadly, it's fate was my garbage can.",1227571200,5,331,4.689655172413793
1350502,4,B00004TJJS,"I'm a fan of Patrick Stewart so it may bias my review a little. That aside I think this is a fine spy thriller. You have a retired man, played by Stewart, that says he was an agent for the DIA. The problem is no one believes him not even his daughter or psychiatrist. When he starts to lose his memory from Alzheimer's setting on, things look rather bleak. Who can he trust? The only one that seems to believe is his pool man and maybe his live-in caretaker. He truly believes he is at risk and with his high tech toys he tracks a presidential candidate's activities and the suspicious deaths of former team members. He knows the dirty secrets of this candidate and believes he will kill him as well. One of the better made for TV movies with the right amount of drama, comedy, and thrills. Good quality DVD and excellent replayability. I ordered a copy myself. Fans of Stewart shouldn't miss this one.",1203292800,2,902,4.407185628742515

I always enjoy Patrick Stewart and Kimberly Williams and they were wonderful together in this drama. Given that all things are relative, the movie probably did not deserve the four stars but it was better than three. There is some violence and a few f-bombs. It would not be particular good for children but most of all, they would not enjoy the movie.",1203206400,3,504,4.489130434782608
1350504,4,B00004TJJS,"That's the premise of this little made-for-cable gem, according to the writer / director, and it's a pretty cool exploration of the idea.  Patrick Stewart is never less than convincing, either as a retired military intelligence legend obsessed with his own security, or as an old man whose mind is failing long before his body.

Suppose Sean Connery's Bond had aged gracefully, settled down somewhere and tried to live a normal life.  Would he still be spending his evenings with lovely ladies and vodka martinis?  Or would he be a prisoner of his own past, constantly fearful that all his old enemies would come back to haunt him?  And what if his friends and family didn't really believe he'd ever had those grand old adventures?

The beauty of 'Safe House' is that there's no evidence to support the lead character's paranoid claims of government conspiracy, and it's entirely possible that he's imagining the whole thing.  Yet the film keeps flirting with the possibility that his fears are real, teasing us with suggestions of menace that never entirely come to fruition.  Is there a true danger, or is it all in his mind?

Watching 'Safe House', we don't find out...until the very last scene.  I wouldn't dream of letting you know which it is in this review.",1168732800,6,1264,4.810185185185185
1350505,5,B00004TJJS,"I enjoyed seeing Patrick Stewart portray a wide gamut of human eperience and emotion, embedded in a gripping story with a sharp twist at the end. He demonstrates the terror and grief that can be brought only by the knowledge that one is slowly but surely losing one's mind and one's self, while at the same time fighting to do the right thing with the secret information he holds in fear of his life.

This DVD is a must have for every Stewart fan.",1146960000,3,448,4.333333333333333

He plays wargames & simulations to keep his mind sharp, and believes he's the victim of a conspiracy. His well-intentioned daughter hires a new housekeeper to watch after him, and after a rough start, they seem to make friends. But it's increasingly less clear whether all of his suspicions are unfounded, and gradually becomes more intriguing, both a psychological drama and suspense thriller.",1142121600,2,511,5.481012658227848
1350512,5,B00004TJJS,"With the long-running James Bond franchise now disintegrating into simple body-counts-and-explosions action fare, it really is good to see a proper espionage thriller that was filmed in the same vein as the classic Sean Connery (or even early Roger Moore) Bond protrayals.
This one has a twist; our protagonist is British and equipped with charm by the truckload...but he's also quite possibly crazier than a ...rat.
The beauty of this movie is that from the very beginning you're aware that there is definitely SOMETHING going on...you're just not sure what.  The plot moves on through the eyes of someone who might not necessarily be seeing reality as clearly as he should; is this man, merely eccentric?  Is he completely insane?  Or is he...well, who and what he says he is?
Patrick Stewart is just fantastic.  He's definitely not one to spend his time traveling from one Star Trek convention to another now that his time serving the small screen franchise of Gene Roddenberry's ""generational"" vision is done.  His propensity for bombast and overacting that he brought to ""A Christmas Carol"" isn't found here; he does a fantastic job relaying the problems experienced by a man for whom the borders or reality seem to be in various stages of dissipation.  You don't know whether to laugh or cry at times.
And the supporting cast plays off of him brilliantly.  It's obviously Stewart's show, but the interaction with characters whose attitudes range from enabling to pessimistic to completely disbelieving (and questionably sinister) makes for an intense viewing experience.  How far will things go?  How far will Stewart's character go?  What is real and what is fabrication?  It's a terrific ride, a truly engaging thriller that Cubby Broccoli (or Alfred Hitchcock) himself would have been proud to direct.",1074211200,22,1810,5.101694915254237
1350513,5,B00004TJJS,"I admit that I got this movie because of Patrick Stewart. I've watched him for years as Captain Picard and his range of character portrayals has always been diverse.

1350514,4,B00004TJJS,"This film is a demonstration of what's going to happen once James Bond finally retires. This made-for-TV flick which appeared on the Showtime network,is a surprisingly good movie. It's wonderful blend of action,comedy,and ultamitely suspense makes it real exciting to watch. Stewart,in one of his early non-Star Trek features,plays Mace Sowell. According to his daughter,he's a senile old man suffering from the onset of Alshiemer's Disese. He keeps telling anyone within earshot that he's a retired spy even though his history indicates that he was a low level goverment officer. He also keeps telling everyone that an ambitious presidential canidate whom he used to work with is killing all of his former associates in order to cover up an illegal operation. His constant rantings,along with his scary use of firearms in the house,have run off every caretaker he's ever had. Now his daughter has given him an ultimatium:Either he straightens up and stop his rantings,or he's heading to a retirement home. So he agrees to let his daughter hire a new caretaker,played by Kimberly Williams(fresh off of the Father Of The Bride movies).Now the situation gets worse for Mace. As the presidential canidate gets closer and closer to eliminating Mace,he's faced with not only keeping his nurse in the dark,but he's starting to subcome to the Alshiemer's and now he's afriad that he may lose the vital information that could save his life and stop the bloodshed. That's the action and the suspense. Now for the comedy. The clastrophobic tensions that take place within the confines of this large house are off-set by some absolutely hilarious moments. During his daughter's interview with the prospective caretakers,Stewart is seen outside the house taking some target practice(Trust me,it's funny).There are also little bits of touching drama in the film. Among which are the scenes in which Stewart begins to weep as his once sharp mind deteriorates. As I said before,this film is exciting to watch. And it's also nice to see someone making a real effort to shed his/her Star Trek persona and show everyone what they can really do.",1058918400,3,2126,5.129682997118156
1350515,4,B00004TJJS,"The direct-to-video film ""Safe House"" is a surprisingly engaging action/romantic-comedy with a smart script, cool action, and a wonderful performance by the always-dependable Patrick Stewart. Stewart plays Mace, a paranoid old man with Alzheimers who believes he is being hunted because of facts he knows about the future president of the USA. Hired to take care of him is Kimberly Williams, a young lady who soon falls for Mace's cunning charm. But Williams' character isn't played off as an unintelligent woman. Instead she's always two steps ahead of Mace and sees through his games and shenanigans. Williams does a nice job in the part. What gets past me is how this film never found its way to the big screen. It has the star power and look of a blockbuster film, but instead went straight to video. I can only wonder why.",1043280000,2,827,4.830985915492958
1350516,5,B00004TJJS,"Actually, I don't have the DVD...I just saw this movie last night on one of the Showtime channels.
I don't think much of most alleged ""movies"" which have been produced in the last 20 years or so.  The definitive lack of acting ability in either the male or female ""stars"" is probably the greatest reason for this.
Special effects and ""action"" scenarios can only do so much to qualify as entertainment, even for young, juvenile viewers.  For viewers who have seen much better products (those of us who are beyond the age of 30), there really should be more to something that calls itself a ""theatrical product.""  (For the record, I am currently 55, nearly 56.)
I believe that Patrick Stewart provides these qualities in SAFE HOUSE.  In fact, it was a movie that I was determined NOT to even watch (after the first few moments)...but I decided to stick around and was pleasantly surprised.
Different persons ""see"" different things in anything that is worthy of being called a ""work of art"", whether this is a book, a movie, a sculptor, a painting, etc.  I believe that a true work of art does more than merely sate the senses with its artistry...it also prompts certain intellectual faculties in the viewer who is looking at the world with something more than the escapist boredom which afflicts so many.
What I see in SAFE HOUSE...is a movie that starts off looking like one thing...and transitions into several different entertainment and educational devices.  At the conclusion of the movie, I decided that I would buy it because I think it merits what is ""special"" treatment by me.
This movie starts off as an apparent farce...the antics of PS cannot be taken seriously by anyone who watches the first 15 minutes or so.
Then, with (what I thought was) clever technique, the viewer is given the opportunity to educate himself/herself JUST A LITTLE BIT about a serious condition for many persons (Alheimer's Disease) and what each of us might possibly have to face as the final price for being successful at living:  growing older to the point of resenting the loss of faculties which we have taken for granted for soooo long.
(It kind of reminded me of what I felt as I watched ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, without being like that movie at all.)
BTW:  This is what a good dramatic effort is SUPPOSED to do...arouse the emotions AND the intellect of the viewer.
Arousing emotion itself does not take any particular talent...your wife, your husband, your children, etc...have done this all your life as they manipulate you to achieve their goals (smile).  All of the ""Lassie"" movies do so.  And so on....
But to arouse emotions AND to educate or stimulate the impulse to learn...this is no easy feat.
And then...just when I thought that I had this movie categoried...it changed again to an entertaining mystery, complete with the violence which attends such oftentimes.
The movie owes it's credibility to the efforts of the male star and the female star.  The plot is good, but it takes true actors/actresses to pull it off.
I heartily recommend viewing this movie (in any version) to anyone who is looking for something more than the mundane escapism which treats us all as if we grew up with computer toys and know nothing at all about ""real acting.""

1350517,4,B00004TJJS,"I recommend this movie for the craft that went into it.  I also recommend it for the story and its unexpected sensitivity.
For the first half I thought it was very funny but took itsef too seriously.  When Patrick Stewart, disguised (so as to be incognito while away from his home) as a construction worker, asked his shrink if he thought the shrink felt Stewart liked leaving his house dressed as one of the Village People, I thought I'd fall over laughing.  Then it got quite serious and I started enjoying it on a totally different level.
Patrick Stewart claims, without any supporting evidence, to be a retired government spy who has fatal information regarding a current presidential hopeful.  Fatal to Stewart and fatal to the candidate's future.
A housekeeper is hired by Stewart's daughter to avoid having him committed.  After various humorous interviews, a sprightly young woman is hired and the war of nerves begins.  The plot is complicated as Stewart realizes he is sucumbing to Alzheimer's.  I particularly enjoyed where he tries to memorize the standard quizzes asked by shrinks so the level of disease advancement wouldn't be so apparent during his regular shrink visits.
The acting by all is superb.  Stewart continues to show why he isn't a one-trick pony.
Yes there are a few unexplained occurrences but the movie is quirky enough to not be bothered by these little things.  The ending is well done and one doesn't need those silly little text messages to explain what the director forgot to or how to put in the movie.
This is a fun movie, enjoy it!",1009670400,22,1569,4.802973977695167

1350519,4,B00004TJJS,"I pulled SAFE HOUSE, a made-for-cable thriller, off the video rack solely because it stars Patrick Stewart. I mean, how bad could it be? In reality, it was much, much better than expected.
Stewart plays Mace Sowell, a reclusive widower living in the Hollywood Hills inside a house packed with more security systems and personal weaponry - pistols hidden in every room - than were ever aboard the Starship Enterprise. Mace claims to be a retired deep-cover agent for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a fact that has put him in mortal danger for a reason he leaves unspecified. He's also obsessively disturbed by the political progress of a certain presidential candidate, who's apparently on his way to winning the Oval Office by a landslide. His fears are given little credence by his daughter, her husband, or the psychiatrist retained by the former to treat her Old Man's apparent delusions. The daughter has also just hired Andi, a perky young college graduate, to be Mace's live-in cook and housekeeper. Kimberly Wiliams plays Andi, short for Andrea, whose character displays a delicate beauty and charming appeal somewhat reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn.
It's been made perfectly clear to Andi that she's not Mace's employee to fire, so the cardinal delight of the film's first third is watching the curmudgeonly Sowell (with a capital ""C"") engage in a battle of wits with Andi for turf rights as she gamely carries out her assignment. Luckily, Andi is made of tough stuff. She cleanly fields the verbal and psychological abuse that Mace throws at her, and sometimes manages to give back as good as she gets. Eventually, they reach a working compromise and a certain friendship, at about which time Mace begins to display the symptoms of advancing Alzheimer's Disease, thus further hindering his ability to ""stay sharp"" and repel any assault made on his home or person.
From the beginning, any watcher of SAFE HOUSE will assume the truth of the adage that even paranoids have enemies. So, when will Mace's doomsday materialize? Even Andi begins to wonder as Sowell's convictions begin to draw her in. Stewart gives a performance that is alternately dramatic, witty, and poignant. Williams is positively beguiling. During the scene when she is first alone with Mace and struggling to establish a verbal rapport, her facial expressions as she deals with his silent recalcitrance are priceless. Although some things go unexplained, as to how the neighbors or the LAPD would tolerate Mace's live-fire pistol practice in his back yard, I enjoyed this film very much.",983318400,40,2570,5.049411764705883

Decent. I was surprised. His performance is remarkable. He makes the veiwes beleive exactly what he wants the viewes to believe. Mase Sowell the insane ""former intellgence agent"" is an over the hill man suffering from ulcimers (forgive my spelling). The question you ask in this movie is..

7922569,5,B00004TJJS,"This is one of my favorite Patrick Stewart movies.  It was one of his finer attempts at diversifying his resume after Star Trek.  The premise of the movie is one of Paranoia and I really want all of his toys!  However, the casual gunplay he seems to commit in his neighborhood would make me not want him as a neighbor.  Essentially his character is a retired covert ops agent whose boss, an Admiral who headed his team, is a rising star in the political arena.  As the Admiral rises, he starts to kill off his former team since there are scores of operations, assassinations and the like which would serve to derail his career.  Enter our hero Mace (short for Mason) who has amassed a host of data on our enemy and is hording it for safe keeping.  However, the onset of alzheimer's, plus the constant tactical drills he has with his sole remaining friend Stu the pool guy convince his daughter that he is insane as she had no idea of Mace's former intelligence work.  After a drill in which his maid gets caught in the middle of and quits her daughter hires a new caregiver.

Andi is kind and puts up with Mace's drills after a rocky start.  But as the story progresses, Mace starts to descend into paranoia in spite of the ministrations of his doctor played by an underutilized Hector Elizondo.  Mace has a huge house with every security imaginable and seems to own every gun imaginable short of artillery and shoulder-fired missiles.

Soon Andi and Mace develop an almost romantic relationship but Mace trusts no one.  Its a plot worthy of some of the best spy novels and you are always wondering up until the end.",1516320000,,1616,4.512027491408935

7922573,5,B00004TJJS,"Safe House, in my opinion, was a critical film in Patrick Stewart's career - it gave an American audience a chance to see Stewart's well developed range and kept him from falling into a type-cast obscurity in the post-Next Generation phase of his career.  There were certainly other roles that helped during this period, but Safe House had Stewart carry lead in a unique and memorable story.  His performance portraying a man with onset dementia while still holding onto secrets of his past high-profile career is a paradox for the observer - ostensibly, he is so terrified and acts in such an eccentric manner, one can easily conclude he is delusional.  However, there is a counter-balance in his knowledge, skill, and the hardware he has in his house to thwart an attempt on his life.

There is a constant trade-off where you conclude he is indeed sane and under threat, but then some event occurs that shows he has lost his connection to reality.  The key is that no one ever really explores the validity of what he is saying - he is viewed, even by friends, as someone mentally gone.  And at points, his emotional breakdown when he himself realizes he is descending into dementia only supports the assumption he is living in a self-created fantasy.  The ending is truly interesting in that, whether it turns out he was delusional the entire time or not, the end result is tragic.

This type-cast breaking role helped open up Patrick Stewart's range for an American audience.  I recently watched his powerful performance in the brutal film The Green Room - a movie Stewart would never have been considered for back in 2000.  If it were not for this film, along with a few other critical roles, some of these more recent films of high quality would simply not exist.

I definitely recommend Safe House - you will not be disappointed.",1508112000,2,1835,4.721003134796239
