8698289,5,B00SG9NUHM,"I can't quite tell you why this film captured my attention, but from the outset its stylized production style, make up and acting kept me involved in it. A film by Florin Marksteiner, a talented young Canadian director, it revisits the 1890 Birchall-Benwell Affair. Surely one of the most sensational murder cases in Canadian history, I believe it was one of the the earliest as well. The true tale is dramatically re-created and its short running time lends itself to the style. You, like I, may find yourself totally immersed for 40 mins.",1430870400,,540,4.817204301075269
