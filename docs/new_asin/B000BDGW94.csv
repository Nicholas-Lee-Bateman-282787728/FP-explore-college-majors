2414669,3,B000BDGW94,"Not quite my least favorite season (6 wins that award because of the abusive twerp that ruined it), but this one didn't satisfy as CBS decided to boost ratings by including the over-exposed Rob and Amber of Survivor.  May I mention just how sick I am of those two?  Anyway.  Add to that the fact that CBS decided, in their infinite wisdom, that they'd sell more DVD's if they skipped right to the 7th season (for obvious reasons) and so we don't get seasons 2, 3, 4, etc. which are far more worthy races.  I won't be buying this one but will wait as patiently as possible for season 2.  This one gets three stars from me because of the general awesomeness of The Amazing Race - still the best reality show on tv, the Family Edition notwithstanding.",1127433600,6,748,4.391304347826087
2414670,5,B000BDGW94,"My, my, my - how opinions can differ!

To the other reviewer, all I can say is, ""You've got to be kidding!""

I consider myself a discerning television viewer, and I simply can't get enough of this great TV show!  And this is a show that we will watch over and over again, regardless of our already now knowing who wins in the final episode of each season.

The winning only matters the FIRST time you watch each season; subsequent viewings reveal all the subtle nuances of the competitions, when someone should have zigged when they'd zagged, and what we ourselves would need to know and use should we ever find ourselves in similar situations - and remember, this show is really a study of group dynamics, whether it be a competition between travelers to foreign lands, or in the boardroom, in your community, or at home between family members.

Finally, it is a refreshing approach to a travelogue - even if you are not into reality TV or competitiveness, the shear beauty of the photography and the fascinating interactions with the locals alone could have you hooked on ""The Amazing Race"" series!

And with regard to this particular race series - The Seventh Season - this turned out to be one of our favorites of all seven seasons!

Amber and Rob are certainly the new Ozzie and Harriet - I hope to see even more of them on Reality TV in the future!  Amber's integrity, patience, and optimism are refreshing in today's cynical world.  And Rob's mugging and whispered asides to the camera on his game strategy are both revealing and hilarious!

And yes, Gretchen's constant grousing became like nails on a chalkboard, but she also showed that she was a real trooper, had phenomenal endurance and drive, and a genuine heart of gold.  Watching Gretchen with the locals put a big smile on my face.

And shame on the other reviewer for giving away the ending - there are readers here who may be purchsing this to watch for the first time!

I will say that I think that the winners most certainly deserved it - they went through great personal sacrifice and they also noticeably ""grew"" throughout the season, both as individuals and as a couple.  And they were in the right place at the right time to win - this particular series ending shows that, in a competition of this nature, indeed, anything can happen!

And one of the things that I like best about this particular Reality TV show is that it is a wonderful example of Chaos - not even what seems like the ""perfect plan"" is exempt from the chaos factor, and even the seemingly best game players can come in second or third because of a last minute fluke.

This show is an awful lot like life in general, with beautiful scenery and fascinating locales thrown in as a wonderful bonus.

I am purchasing this DVD, ""The Amazing Race - The Seventh Season"" right now, just as soon as I finish typing this; I have already purchased The First Season DVD of this series, and I am greatly looking forward to purchasing ALL seasons, hopefully, in the near future.

In fact, we are purchasing EXTRA copies of these two currently available seasons, to give as Christmas presents this year to friends and family who share our enthusiasm for this great TV show.

Hats off to all involved, and please keep the seasons coming on television - and thanks, too, for making these two series available for purchase on DVD - I only hope that you will decide to make ALL seasons available for those of us who plan to watch these episodes over and over again for years to come!

I can't say enough great things about this particular DVD, and I highly recommend it for purchase here on Amazon.

2414673,1,B000BDGW94,"I'm a big fan of the Amazing Race and just watched the seventh season on prime.  What no one is talking about is that the eventual winners of the race (Joyce and Uchenna) should have been disqualified.  The rules were stated clearly at the beginning of each episode that no team member could perform more than 6 road blocks.  I watched this season carefully.  Uchenna did 7 roadblocks and Joyce did 5 roadblocks.  Seems like this should have been addressed but it appears that it was swept under the rug because the producers must have wanted the outcome that they got.  Never mind the rules.  Go back and watch the season and see that I am right.  Rob and Amber should have been the winners.  Sorry, but its the truth.",1439683200,,719,4.469230769230769

2414685,4,B000BDGW94,"I enjoyed watching season 7 even though I knew which team would win due to a reference made in a later season about a Fast Forward in this season.  It was still an amazing and exciting finish.

I am taking away one star because I had to order this box set 5 times before I finally got a set with 4 acceptable disks, that did not have smudges or fingerprints resulting in poor picture quality or freezing.  It was odd that all 4 sets returned had a deep notch cut over the bar code on the back of the box.  They were sold as ""new"" by 4 different third party vendors and 3 were fulfilled by Amazon.  Since the fifth set did not have a notch and is ok, I have to wonder if the notch has any significance.",1376179200,,701,4.014388489208633

2414692,3,B000BDGW94,Although Amazing Race contestants are pretty diverse and that's what makes a good show. Seeing Rob and Amber had their frame from Survivor other people from other countries were more willing to help them coz of their exposure on Survivor.

2414693,5,B000BDGW94,"I've seen every episode of this series and think this is one of the rare reality shows with true value.

The thing I love most about the show are the locations. It is the next best thing to traveling the world myself. Not only do I get to see multiple and varied locales, including many that I will likely never get to travel to myself, but the show producers also do a great job of finding the most unique adventures to complete in each area. I've learned more about world geography and different cultures than I ever learned in any classroom.

It's also interesting to watch the interpersonal dynamics between teammates and between teams. I'd be lying if I didn't admit to finding the conflicts entertaining . . . and the stress of travel and competition does bring it out. But I always root for the teams that are nicest to each other.

And it's rewarding to see how the intensity of the race truly brings teammates closer together by forcing them to work together and rely on one another.",1340755200,,992,4.5

2414695,5,B000BDGW94,I was surprised to see that some people didn't think this was the best season of The Amazing Race.  I loved it.  Meredith and Gretchen were my favorite team ever until Bopper and Mark in Season 20.  I didn't like all the snipping at the old couple from the younger racers - most of whom were eliminated (deservedly so) long before the senior team.  This season was definitely worth watching.  The ending was very exciting as well with a race to the finish.  Even though I knew who would win (I'd watched Season 20 first which has a flashback to this season) it was still exciting.,1339718400,,580,4.4245283018867925
2414696,5,B000BDGW94,What a great season.  Car accidents and injuries.  Drama and scheming.  Marriages in trouble.  It was all there and any fan will love the special feature that allows you to click throughout the episodes for additional footage and interviews.  One of the cooler special features I've seen.  More than worth a buy.  Even if you're just a Survivor fan it's worth buying this just to see Rob and Amber back in action.,1300060800,,413,4.652777777777778
2414697,5,B000BDGW94,"""The Amazing Race"" show is a great favorite in our household.  At least, as reality TV goes, it isn't based on the inane premise that a contestant is in mortal danger of a crocodile eating them, while the camera-man getting close-up shots of the croc, and getting paid union wage and benefits, somehow isn't.  It is interesting to see other parts of the world and in this particular season, we especially enjoyed rooting for or booing some of the longer-term contestants.

2414698,5,B000BDGW94,"Recently, I decided to watch this season of the Amazing Race on DVD. I started viewing them in the evening. I thrilled with delight and marveled as I watched show after show. Hours into watching I noticed light coming though my window. I thought to myself what is that light? I went to investigate only to discover that it was the morning sun, and that I had stayed up all night watching the Amazing Race and didn't even know it! I have never done this before, and will try and control myself as I watch season one on DVD. I looked on the box and the total viewing was 10 hours, but it seemed three or four! I will now check to see if there is a Betty Ford clinic for Amazing Race viewers! (smile) People, I just discovered the mystery of time travel...it is watching the Amazing Race!  It has the ability to make time stand still!...",1290729600,2,834,4.2784810126582276
2414699,5,B000BDGW94,"Great season to use as entry way into following the game.  Having familiar faces such as Rob & Amber made it more interesting.

2414700,5,B000BDGW94,"I didn't get into The Amazing Race until past the twelfth season. I love Project Runway and was upset that Heidi kept losing the Emmy to The Amazing Race. Ever since the Best Reality Show category was created, The Amazing Race has LITERALLY won EVERY SINGLE YEAR for the past seven years. When I complained to my friend that I couldn't understand why the show kept winning, she simply asked me, ""Have you ever watched the show?"" to which I had to admit that I hadn't. I was hooked after my second episode.

After getting my feet wet with the newer seasons, I did some research into previous seasons and kept hearing LOTS of people talking about ""Rob and Amber."" It seemed that people either hated them or loved them. My friend clearly loved them and said that they changed the rules of the game. After watching season seven on DVD, I have to concur. I had no pre-conceived opinions of Rob and Amber prior to watching TAR because I hadn't seen them on Survivor. I fell in love with their team after the second episode! What I loved about Rob was the fact that he seemed to be the only person who understood that TAR was a COMPETITION and not just a feel-good race around the world. Rob used his head in order to get ahead while staying within the context of the rules. I blame all of the other teams for allowing themselves to get caught up in his schemes. One of my favorite moves by Rob came in the second episode when all of the teams were riding on a bus to their next destination. Four of the teams, including Rob and Amber sat towards the front of the bus while the remaining teams sat in the back, close to the rear doors. Rob spoke with the other three teams about chipping in some money to bribe the bus driver into only opening the front doors of the bus and keep the rear doors closed. I couldn't even take it when Rob turned to the camera and admitted that he used money from all of the other teams to bribe the bus driver but put his own money back in his pocket. All of the other teams essentially paid for him to benefit by getting out of the bus first!

I'm disappointed that CBS hasn't released any of the other seasons besides the first. I keep hearing a lot about the family season and would truly like to see it, despite the fact that people complained about it. It's so interesting to see how the show has changed, even from the first season. I like the fact that they get a local person to welcome the teams arriving at the pit stop and I actually like the fact that teams are now allowed to change challenges during the detour. It appears that in the past, teams chose one and had to stick with it until it was completed. One thing that I am definitely glad that they changed was the penalty on non-elimination legs. In season seven, all of the teams on the non-elimination leg were required to turn over their bags and ALL of their money. That meant they had to finish the race with literally nothing but the clothes on their backs and not a penny to their name until the next leg. One team had to literally beg people for money and it hurt my heart to see them reduced to begging. One thing that I loved about season seven was that many people stated that the winners truly deserved it. I absolutely agree - the season couldn't have ended any perfectly!",1282348800,,3277,4.300970873786408

The scenery is spectacular, whether it's the beach, mountains, tropical, winter or just peaceful.  It also conveys how traveling is tough on the human body.  Catty arguments begin soon between loved ones.  Some teams handle it very well.  Each show is an adventure that I enjoy alot.

We have watched all the shows in all their reruns on either the game show network or Reality TV. This set comes closest to the extras that Reality TV puts together at the end of each segment by brodcasting interviews of the competitors. The extra bits & pieces are fun to watch and makes me want to buy more episodes, BUT I CAN""T.
Get with it & release all the episodes!!!",1232323200,,649,4.241935483870968
2414706,4,B000BDGW94,"For many years now, I have been a great fan of The Amazing Race (TAR) TV reality series. That's why I can say that Season 7 is not one of its best season.

This is mainly due to the casting of members from the Survivor reality show. I thought that TAR is all about having regular common 2-team people racing around the world.  By putting contestants from another reality show, like Survivor, really sucks because these teams have the experience of being on a reality show.

Anyway, the 11 teams in Season 7 were Rob and Amber, Lynn and Alex, Patrick and Susan, Ron and Kelly, Meredith and Gretchen, Brian and Greg, Ryan and Chuck, Ucheanna and Joyce, Debbie and Bianca, Megan and Heidi, and lastly, Ryan and Deana.

I liked teams Meredith and Gretchen, Ucheanna and Joyce, and Brian and Greg; really nice people and were the life of the show; they made the show fun to watch.  Nasty teams like Rob and Amber, Ray and Deana, Patrick and Susan, and Lynn and Alex were the people you want to hate and lose the race.

A few incidents badly marked the show; For one, Rob and Amber were irritating, cocky and mean. I was very happy that they didn't win in the end. I didn't like them when they said Meredith may have pushed Gretchen (the elderly couple team) on purpose - Gretchen fell in the dark while doing their cave detour, and her face was bleeding. Rob and Amber didn't symphatize or leave money to help the elderly couple when they were stripped of their money after check-in last at the pitstop.  Anyway, Rob and Amber's selfishness and self-centredness finally defeated them in the end.  They didn't win the $1 million; they came 2nd.  So close yet so far! That's karma!

I have a big question. Why must TAR select contestants from other reality show to be in their show? There must have been hundreds of applications from other people, and the TAR just had to pick Rob and Amber! I can't put into words my deep disappointment when Rob and Amber were selected to be in Season 11 AllStars Edition! What the hell?? What is wrong with everyone over in TAR? There are many other ex-contestants from previous TAR seasons to chose from. Why didn't they pick the Derek and Drew (Twins/Models) or Gina and Sylvia (the moms) from Season 3? or Linda and Karen (Bowling moms) of Season 5? What about Blake and Paige (brother and sister) or Cyndi and Russel (Pastors) from Season 2? If TAR wanted some interesting/memorable teams, then they could have chosen boston buddies Chris and Alex (season 2), Ken and Gerard (season 3), Jonathan and Victoria (the screaming couple) or Lori and Bolo (professional wrestlers) from Season 6, or gay couple Lynn and Alex (season 7), and hippies BJ and Tyler (season 9).

Anyway, as for me, I will not buy DVDs of Season 7 and Season 11  of The Amazing Race. :(",1209600000,,2789,4.53386454183267
2414707,5,B000BDGW94,"OK- so I'm a bit slow on the uptake: I just started watching The Amazing Race this season. (12) I wanted to see more so I ordered seaon 7.

I LOVE Season 7!!! Granted, I disliked Amber and Rob on Survivor( though looking back, Rob really should've won Survivor) but I love them on TAM! Their game strategies were hilarious (ex: Stealing the cab from the Blondes) and really took the game to a new level. I think they should've won the whole thing.

I couldn't stand Gretchen! I was hoping she'd go the first week. Her whiney, complainey voice was like nails on a chalkboard. She talked so LOUD all the time, it drove me nuts. I am impressed how far she and her hubby got, however.

I think all of the other couples had alot of personality and they made the season alot of fun. Great job by the casting director.

This season was great!! Rob and Amber dominated just like they did in Survivor All Stars. They came in 1st a lot. The winners of this season were Uchenna and Joyce. People thought that Rob and Amber would win. Ron and Kelly argued a lot and if they did not argue as much as they did, they probaly would of come in 2nd (after Rob and Amber). Rob and Amber wer less than 1 minute away from winning but they had no cash to pay the taxi driver. Uchenna and Joyce passed them when they were begging for money. The 4th place racers: Meridith and Gretchen. Gretchen had an ugly fall in one of the episodes. Gretchen was gong in a cave, but then she lost her grip and fell, she had blood all over her face, but she got medical attention. People were shocked they came in 4th place because Meridith and Gretchen were seniors Meridith: 69 years old Gretchen: 66 years old! 5th place racers Lynn and Alex: AHHHHH! These people annoy me. They are boyfriends and.... boy they annoy me. 6th place racers: Brian and Gregg. They had a car flip in Africa, they were in 2nd place in the race, then, Brian was going way too fast on a small road and then the car flipped over. Brian and Gregg were fine, but their camere man was hurt badly. 7th place racers: Ray and Deana. These 2 were dating on and off, you can tell why they weren't dating all the time, they argued more thea Ron and Kelly! 8th place racers: Susan and Patrick. This was a mother son team. I think they should of made it farther but, they were too slow. 9th place racers: Debbie and Bianca. On the 1st leg they came in 1st. Then on the 2nd leg they were in the middle of the pack. On the 3rd leg Susan and Patrick beat Debbie and Bianca narrowly. Debbie and Bianca were elimanated. 10th place racers: Megan and Heidi: These 2 roomates were hotties!! They were flirthing with Brian and Gregg. I really, really, really wish they made it farther! Last place racers: Ryan and Chuck. These 2 hillbillys stood no chance in a final foot race at the end of the 1st leg with Ron and Kelly. This season was great! Buy it!!",1160870400,,2080,4.265822784810126

This season has some great teams like Meredith and Gretchen who surprised everyone by doing so well to Ron and Kelly who's constant arguing made the game quite enjoyable. And who could forget Lyn and Alex the gay couple who made tv viewers split their sides laughing with their hilarious comments.

This season also had some great locations and the detours and roadblocks were the hardest yet. I was in shock when Phil the host revealed the new twist about the Non-elimination legs!

You either love or hate Rob and Amber (I won't say which I feel) but they do add a distinct competitiveness to the race. Everyone feels they need to beat them since they already have a million dollars.

2414716,4,B000BDGW94,"Fantastic series - As an avid Amazing Race watcher who no longer gets to see the Amazing Race on TV (I have moved to the UK and for some reason they don't show it here) I was thrilled to see that season 7 had been released on DVD. I had heard that the series was a good one and I wasn't disappointed.

I was disappointed, however, with the menus for the DVD itself. The menu for each of the 4 DVD's has images of the teams which get eliminated on the episodes on that DVD. This ruins the surprise for anyone who did not get to see the series whilst it was on TV. My advice (and this is what we did once we worked it out after the first DVD) is to block the top third of your tv screen until after each episode has started so that the surprise is not spoilt. Other than this issue the DVD is great. The extra footage makes some episodes longer than others (the first episode is especially long) but this adds to the experience.

Buy it - I would have given it a 5 had they not struck out with the menus - hopefully they will address this for upcoming releases of the other series (which I am looking forward to given I have been overseas since series 3!)",1141344000,3,1153,4.052631578947368

2414719,5,B000BDGW94,"After thoroughly enjoying Season 1 of the Amazing Race, I was excited to hear about Season 7 being released on DVD.  I didn't get to see Seasons 1 or 7 when they were actually broadcast so that made it even more exciting to watch and experience.  That's the thing about TAR; it isn't just a show it is truly an EXPERIENCE for the viewer.  The 11 teams: Rob and Amber, Lynn and Alex, Patrick and Susan, Ron and Kelly, Meredith and Gretchen, Brian and Greg, Ryan and Chuck, Ucheanna and Joyce, Debbie and Bianca, Megan and Heidi and Ryan and Deana race around the world for a cool $1 million prize for the team that finishes first.  Ucheanna and Joyce, the winners of the race, weren't very visible in the show until about 3/4 of the way through in the infamous hair cutting episode, but were really the obvious safe bet from the start.  It is shows like this where you really find the best people in the world and also the worst people in the world.  Teams like Rob and Amber, Patrick and Susan and Lynn and Alex are the only real bad mark on this fantastic ""reality"" show.  Teams like Meredith and Gretchen and Ucheanna and Joyce and Brian and Greg are the inspiration and life of the show and really make it fun.  I think that winners Ucheanna and Joyce proved once and for all that in a competition, you don't have to play dirty to win.  Rob and Amber Mariano would have done well for themselves and may have won if they would have taken that to heart from the very beginning of the season, instead of blaming their losing on Ucheanna and Joyce getting on the same flight as them.  I think even more so than Season 1, Season 7 kept your heart pumping and provided edge-of-your-seat entertainment the whole time.  From the creators of this show down to most of the contestants, TAR continues to be one of the best shows on television period.  Looking forward to Season 8 and beyond!!!!",1137974400,6,1886,4.403458213256484
2414720,5,B000BDGW94,I am a bit of a reality TV addict - and I have not had the pleasure of following the series on television - so I REALLY enjoyed this DVD set of the 7th season of AR. As a matter of fact - I watched it in one day! That's right - ONE DAY - I just couldn't give it a rest. The following day I watched the few episodes on the disc with additional commentary tracks - and found that very interesting and insightful. HIGHLY recommended.,1137283200,,430,3.954022988505747
2414721,5,B000BDGW94,"Ok, the only thing close to heaven was that starting line was just off the Queen Mary but hey it did get your attention.  Anyway, being a fan of only 1 ""reality"" show (this one), and having originally caught race 7 in the middle during GSN's rerun while I was buying race 1 on disc, I didn't understand all the hype about Rob and Amber except that they previously appeared on CBS' other popular show of this type; Survivor.  But after watching all of episode 1 uncut on disc 1 and adding the opening segment after the credits of episode 2, I can definitely sympathize with all the other fans and the other contestants as well. So yes, a good race, but Rob and Amber should gotten the shaft sooner.  What really gets me about them, besides their revamped John McGraw attitude (winning at all cost) is that CBS actually allowed them to sign up and get on the show after winning their other ""popular"" series only what a year or 2 ago?  Hey, I admit, I've seen game show contestants appear on 2 shows in their lifetime, and even 1 guy appeared on 2 shows hosted by the same emcee (he didn't remember the contestant or at least he didn't say so on camera), but 1 show aired on CBS and the other in first run Syndication 5 years later.  I thought networks were stricter than that.  And while we're at it, Race 1 hits dvd just as Race 8 starts on CBS and Race 7 hits dvd as Race 8 ends and only a few months after its only rerun to date on GSN.  Why is CBS Video in their inifinite wisdom let alone their deal with Paramount (a usual reputable company for home video) stalling on the releases of 2 through 6?  Now that I've seen most of them on GSN, I'm looking forward to getting them on disc, let alone seeing Race 9 on CBS, so let's put them out in order huh?  By the way CBS is taking applications (at least as I type this) for race 10, anyone want a partner?",1135555200,5,1856,4.176470588235294
2414722,5,B000BDGW94,"I love Amazing Race always.  I have seen all the seasons and would have still watched this whether Amber and Rob were in it or not.  I love travelling vicariously through this series.  I've seen so many more places on this show than I will ever see in real life.  I feel sorry for the contestants that don't get to stop and see all the sights where they're at, but you have to watch this show.  It is frustrating to watch them miss flights, or get lost and therefore lag behind, or encounter people not speaking english, but I guess that's part of what makes this engrossing and entertaining.  Sure, Amber and Rob were annoying and obnoxious throughout, but they played well and deserved their second place.  This is a must see programme for any travel enthusiast and anyone who loves true reality shows.  One of the best.",1135209600,4,822,4.506756756756757
2414723,5,B000BDGW94,"By the seventh season, the show is becoming familiar.  Eleven teams of two with some kind of relationship follow clues in a race around the world.  Along the way, there are also tasks they must perform to get their next clue.  These tasks provide looks at the culture of the area they are visiting.  Those of us watching at home get a nice geography and culture lesson without ever leaving out living room.  As each leg of the race ends, the last team is usually eliminated, narrowing the field each weak until the final three teams race for the finish.

The teams this season fall into the normal parameters.  There's a gay couple, several couples who are dating or married, a pair of brothers, an older couple, and a mother/son team.  Frankly, it feels a bit like they have a template these days and are looking to fill certain pre set rolls. Still, this season had the standouts.  Brothers Brian and Greg were nice guys everyone was rooting for.  Ray and Deena were this season's fight from day one couple.  Meredith and Gretchen, despite their age, proved to be tough competitors.  While they often irritated me, I couldn't help but root for them.  Kelly and Ron were the all American beauty queen/Iraq war vet couple.  I started out liking them, but by the end they made me cringe.  Uchenna and Joyce where such a nice couple, you couldn't help but root for them.  And then there was Rob and Amber.

Whether it was supposed to be or not, this season of The Amazing Race became all about Rob and Amber, still riding high off Amber's win in Survivor All-Star.  Unlike the last time TAR tried a reality show crossover, Rob and Amber proved to have real staying power, using their fame to find help along the way.  And, of course, Rob was able to use his power of persuasion to get several teams to support his plan when it came to skipping the nasty food challenge.  I hated Rob in both seasons of Survivor he was on, but I will admit I found myself rooting for them this go around.  I think I found Rob's antics to be a breath of fresh air on the show.

Of course, the locations where excellent as well.  The fact that they haven't repeated anything yet amazes me.  Personally, I loved their trip through Botswana since my parents have been there twice.  It gave me a chance to see the country in something other then still shots.  Other highlights included Peru, Argentina, Istanbul, and London.

This season also featured some amazingly close finishes.  Several times the team eliminated was only eliminated by a few minutes.  The ending was a real nail bitter as well.  Of course, this is partially editing, but even without that, we seemed to have lots of close calls this season.

The show is not as fresh as it used to be, with the casting falling into predictable patterns.  But the show is still entertaining and slightly educational.  This is the best reality program out there.",1135123200,18,2890,4.549514563106796
2414724,5,B000BDGW94,"I loved this season!  Partly because it was (IMHO) one of the best seasons of the Race, and partly because it was the second full season ever broadcast in the United Kingdom.

For those who are complaining about the inclusion of Rob and Amber from that other reality show, this was not the first time that it was done.  In season five (just showing on UK TV) one of the racers was a former Big Brother contestant - and although I can't remember who it was, a contestant from Survivor has also  been on before this.  The people who run the Amazing Race have a long, drawn-out selection process that takes many things into account, probably just like Survivor has, and with how gruelling the Race can be its not suprising that they've thrown up the same contestants.  Lets just have a little reality check here - suppose they HAD put Rob and Amber in to boost ratings, and they got eliminated on the first round.  What then?  The fact that they lasted until the end proves that (love 'em or hate 'em) they BELONGED in the Race!",1135123200,2,1025,4.414893617021277
2414725,4,B000BDGW94,"The Amazing Race is not just the only reality show worth watching, it is the only TV show I watch -- period. The reason?  It's irresistible premise. It has everything -- nail-biting competition, dazzling worldwide travel destinations, fascinating team dynamics, villains to hiss and heroes to cheer for.

All that said, the 7th season does not present TAR at its best. All the great elements are there, but they are marred somewhat by the stunt casting of Rob and Amber who, although good competitors, are clearly there only because of their dubious celebrity.  How much better it would be to have season 3 with the insufferable Flo or season 6 with the heavenly Kris and Jon.

Still, I'll take all the TAR I can get! Long may it race!",1134518400,3,735,4.674418604651163
2414726,5,B000BDGW94,"I loved TAR 7th season, in spite of Rob and Amber!  I have never screamed so loud at my TV as I did when Uchenna and Joyce were so close and couldn't get the money for the cab driver...but we all know that they did eventually get the money and went on to win, in the best example that karma does exist.  After Joyce shaved her head for good luck, they sure deserved to win, and had karma on their side to accomplish it.  While there is some controversy of the plane turning around for them and claims from Rob of cheating--man, isn't that the pot calling the kettle black--Rob in some way or another cheated his entire way through the race, whether it was getting locals to follow him around like he was Elvis or tricking others into not finishing the meat-eating roadblock, I still love this season.

And I can't wait for TAR 5 & 6 to come out also.  Kris and Jon were my faves.  They should really do a TAR All-stars.  That would be awesome--I would be glued to the TV on Tuesday nights--oh, hey who am I kidding--I already am.  Keep TAR coming for many more seasons.",1134432000,5,1069,4.257425742574258
2414727,2,B000BDGW94,"I, much like all AMAZING RACE fans, are probably a little disappointed that the seventh installment of this show was released before 2-6, although it is likely to capitalize on Robnamber's popularity (wherever it may be at this point).

The disappointing element of this season was the reliance on the former SURVIVOR couple.  They had most of the camera time, and they were the focus of everyone else.  It seemed that most of the teams were fixated on what Robnamber were up to instead of their own race.

Although Robnamber are entertaining to watch and are dominant, their sudden placing to Joyce and Uchenna makes me a little suspicious....It's no secret these two are savvy and money-driven.  I would gamble that CBS offered them a very generous second-place compensation.

Outside of Robnamber, this season lacks teams that you feel strongly about.  Kelly is annoying; Ron is spineless.  Lynn and Alex are cute, but they are obsessed with Rob; Meredith is weak; Gretchen won't shut up.  The list continues.

Overall, much better couples have raced in much stronger seasons.  Kris and Jon from AR6 are supportive and sweet; AR5's Colin and Christie are the most competitve, dominant team in the show's eight seasons.  On the flip side, AR6's Jonathan and Victoria are despicable, and AR6 winners Freddie and Kendra are rather vile.  AR5's Brandon and Nicole are loathesome, Bible-thumping creeps/fashion models.

My inclination is to wait for other seasons to be released.  The best three seasons were four, five and six.",1134345600,3,1526,5.048
2414728,4,B000BDGW94,"I am also disappointed that CBS is releasing TAR out of order, but am sure it's the Romber factor...tick-tock on those 15 minutes!  I'm glad their wedding isn't one of the ""features""!!

I am longing for seasons 4 and 5 (despite Colin & Christie, although the Broken Ox incident is one of my favorite TV moments).  Still TAR7 ranks up there as a very good TAR season; any Race is significantly better than most of the other stuff on TV.  (Well, maybe not the Family Edition...)

Keep 'em coming, CBS!!",1134086400,4,500,4.511111111111111
2414729,5,B000BDGW94,"I have been watching the Amazing Race since the first season. I think the Amazing Race is the best reality show ever. I like the variety of the contestants and the places where they go.

I agree with some of the previous reviews. I hope CBS will release the other seasons too because the Seventh season is not one of the best seasons. In fact, I don't really like the Seventh season because of Rob and Amber. Rob did use some ""dirty"" tricks to complete and finish the tasks. I couldn't believe that he actually asked the ticket counter staff for not selling the tickets for others in one episode. He even convinced the other teams for not eating the meat when he and Amber couldn't finish the meat. He always said bad things about other people. He is just very bad. I hate Rob ! Luckily, they don't win the race. Uchenna and Joyce are deserved to be the winner; they are great and honest people. Lynn and Alex are really funny especially the episode when they got eliminated. They were wearing a lot of clothes; just in case if they didn't get eliminated but all their things would be taken. They are my favourite team in the Seventh Season.

I love the Sixth Season the most because of Kris and Jon. They are the sweetest couple that I ever saw in the Amazing Race. I wish they could win; unfortunately, they don't. They are really great as human beings and very competitive but in the same time they never used any ""dirty"" tricks. I love them ! Kris and Jon is my favourite team all the times. Another best episode of the Sixth Season is when Aaron proposed Hayden. It's really surprising and very touching. I didn't like them at first but the wedding proposal is really sweet.",1133222400,2,1679,4.412903225806452
2414730,5,B000BDGW94,"The Amazing Race's 7th Season was one of the better entries in the series, and was a lot of fun to watch.  Much of this was because there were not any boring teams, and some of the most interesting lasted a long time in the race.

Rob and Amber made a successful jump to another reality TV series, and showed they knew how to race.  They were the only team of the final three not to be bailed out on a non-elimination leg (thus were the only ones that had any possessions at the end of the race), and finished in first place several times.  Part of the reason is that took opportunities.  One of the best moments of the show was when Rob organized a deal between the four teams at the front of a bus all teams were on.  Uchenna and Joyce, Ray and Deana, and Ron and Kelly, all chipped in 5 solentes for to bribe the bus driver to only open the front doors.  Rob had promised to chip in as well.  He did bribe the bus driver, but never chipped in - he laughed as he told the camera that he was only using the other teams money.

Winners Uchenna and Joyce were a married couple that were highly supportive of each other, and enjoyed the journey.  They were nice enough to even try to help their direct competition (Gretchen and Meredith) near the end of the race with a boat haulling task, until they remembered they couldn't do that.  Joyce even sacrificed her  hair to claim a fast forward.  In the end, they won first place.

Ron and Kelly, a beauty queen and a former POW were something of a strange couple, and their relationship disintigated towards the end of the race.  In fact, their fighting got enough out of control at the end to miss the airport turn off, and any chance of winning the race.

Meredith and Gretchen were the oldest couple in the race, and are the oldest couple to make it to fourth place.  They were very supportive of each other, though they ran on luck for a good portion of the race.  A highlight was when Gretchen mistakenly climbed on top of a elephant statue they were supposed to be pushing, and kept saying that they had a bad elephant.

Other features of the race was teams frantically trying to get tickets for the last departure time, three teams quitting a roadblock at one point, a major car wreck in which a cameraman was hurt, one team wrecking two cars in a single episode, and an episode ending with teams meeting Phil on the mat - but instead of checking them into a pit stop, he just handed them another clue.",1130803200,7,2455,4.274891774891775
2414731,4,B000BDGW94,"The Amazing Race 7 isn't the best of the Amazing Race series. Personally, I rank it down the bottom, but if you're a fan, it's probably worth it. The most interesting part of this season was the Rob and Amber stunt casting. I still don't understand why it seemed like everyone loved them, I hated them, but they did make good entertainment.

In terms of other teams, there weren't any real stand outs, Ron and Kelly seemed to be a mix up of Adam and Rebecca and Hayden and Aaron from TAR6. Uchenna and Joyce resembled Chip and Kim from TAR5, and so on. But, Meredith and Gretchen definitely stood out, and a lot of the earlier eliminated teams were good entertainment.

Either way, it probably sounds like I'm saying it was really bad, but it really wasn't. This race had some of the most exciting legs and closest pit stops, and again, great destinations. More time was spent in South America than before, but it stayed interesting. So, yeah. Not the best season by far, but still worth a look.",1130025600,3,995,4.49171270718232
2414732,3,B000BDGW94,"Amazing Race is really a great show, but I'm kind of disappointed in CBS for releasing this season out of order when there were some much better seasons before it. I'm assuming this is to cash in on Rob and Amber's celebrity while they still have one or two of their fifteen minutes left. Rob and Amber are a couple that you have to either love or hate, and unfortunately for me, I hate them so this season ranks pretty low on my list. I find Rob to be simply disgusting as a human being and, with him getting so much camera time during this season, I found myself wishing there was a toilet in my living room.

Other than this major drawback (for my fellow haters and me), there were some teams that were fun to watch. If you've never seen this season, the last leg is an absolute nailbiter no matter who you're rooting for. I remember very clearly pacing back and forth in my living room that night and literally yelling at the racers like they could hear me through my TV.",1128729600,11,975,4.27027027027027

This season was possibly the tighest season yet. I won't say who did win so I don't ruin it for unseen viewers, but they sure as heck deserved it.",1128384000,4,420,4.134146341463414
2414734,4,B000BDGW94,"Having Rob and Amber from ""Survivor"" compete on this show's Season 7 was obviously a bit of stunt casting (and, to a degree, was regrettable, because TAR shouldn't really need to resort to such attention-grabbing ploys) but as far as that goes, they were a definite upgrade from Alison from ""Big Brother"", who appeared in Season 5 along with her boyfriend Donny. It really shouldn't come as a shock that they proved to be excellent competitors, and there's one leg of the race in particular where the Robfather pulls a Jedi mind trick to convince some of the weaker-willed to dance to his tune.

Personally, I think Seasons 3 and 6 have been the strongest, but this edition has one really great team (Brian and Greg), the requisite team you love to hate (Ray and Deana), the token old couple (Meredith and Gretchen) that refuses to go quietly into that good night (NEVER bet on the old couple to be eliminated first on any TAR season), a stereotypically snarky gay couple (Lynn and Alex), and the ever-popular team where you can't believe the words that are coming out of their mouths (from Kelly--not so much from Ron). At least one of the teams had no real business being on the show--the word is that they were actually recruited by the casting agents, rather going through the audition tape process like everyone else, and it is pretty much evident. A member of another team spends so much time groaning and complaining about inevitable defeat that you'll want to hit the mute button whenever he shows up on the screen.

This season spends rather more time in South America than in previous outings and, unusually, scarcely hits Europe at all, and then takes a literally surprising direction for the home stretch.

There's plenty of drama, and at least three photo finishes with desperate flat-out sprints to the mat, and one of these is among TAR's all-time great moments to watch. And thankfully, no one proves to be as wretched and vile as TAR5's Colin and Christie or TAR6's truly loathsome Jonathan and Victoria.

Plus there is llama herding, so you know that you're in for quality entertainment. Until TAR3 and TAR6 come out, this edition is not too shabby.",1127692800,40,2167,4.740053050397878
