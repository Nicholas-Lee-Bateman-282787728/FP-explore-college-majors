6608128,4,B00N2TYOXA,"Alice gets a 10+, but who ever edited this video should be sent back to school.  They obviously didn't really care to take the time and make it as good as it could have been.  I think I read another review about how they don't focus on the main event of the moment...like a guitarist during a solo.  In fact, it seems like on some of the songs, they just set it on auto switch and let some program just choose random shots.  Could have been a lot better from that aspect.  That being said.... this is still a Blu-ray worth buying.  Alice and his band are Fabulous as always.  Seems they just keep getting better.  If you've never been to an Alice concert and you have the chance, do not pass it up.  He is by far one of the best touring acts out there, and I've never seen him give anything but all out, full on, no holds barred, Rock and Roll at it's best, performance.",1416355200,4,870,4.130952380952381

6608130,5,B00N2TYOXA,"Alice Cooper has finally been on the ball with the last few live releases.... he seemed to be put the ultimate live recording together with the ""Trashes The World"" release, but scattered those recordings as bonus tracks amongst many singles and other releases, or mostly the people buy ""Classicks""... since then he brought out ""A fist full of Alice"", which had some decent recordings, but some poor versions of the songs live too that just felt incomplete and no where near as good a sounding as on the recordings. Then there was a 100 releases of an old show from the late 60's under a million different titles, and fans have just begged for a decent Alice Cooper concert that rocks and in full swing. Alice then hit the money with ""Live at Montreux in 2005"" which is certainly one of the best live albums of all time"" then ""Theater of Death"" and ""No More Mr Nice Guy"" rocked the ears too... so, what's left?We've heard it all before, right? How can doing another live release be any different to any other of the past? Simple, change the regular set list and do some totally Kick A versions of songs not released live before.

Hello Hooray is the perfect number to kick off the show with,  then onto House of Fire which has never had a live release of to my knowledge, only low quality bootlegs. A few classics inserted, and onto the newer song ""I'll bite your face off"" which sounds much better live than it does on the studio recording. As does Caffeine. ""Hey Stoopid"" finally gets a good live version, and ""Dirty Diamonds"" may have been seen live before, but this is definitely the most pumped up and best it's ever sounded. Favorites like Welcome To My Nightmare get a short version, but it's OK, we have heard it many times before, then into ""Go To Hell"" just before FINALLY after all these years, ""He's Back"" which sounds awesome, even better than when it was written for ""Jason Lives"" in 1980something. It sounds beefed up, no a song lost in the 80s, and really rocks now. This line up of the band really do awesome versions and solos in both ""Feed My Frankenstein"" and ""Poison"", two songs i've been pretty critical in the past of live versions because they sound like cheap watered down versions of the album recordings... it's hard I guess to nail what Joe Satriani and Steve Vai did for that song, but Orianthi, Ryan Roxi and Tommy Hendrixson really whale on this show. They are a tight playing group and are definitely one of the best line ups on guitar Alice has ever had. Alice pays tribute to his deceased drinking buddies and covers ""My Generation - The Who"" and ""Break On Through - The Doors"" on the DVD, but also does ""Revolution - The beatles"" and ""Foxy Lady - Jimmy Hendrix"" on the CD. All these covers rock and make me look forward to hearing the recordings on Alice's next studio album release in 2015. Finally Schools Out sounds better than ever with a mash in of ""Another Brick in the Wall - Pink Floyd""

the show itself is great, typical Alice... and just gets better through the night. It's an open concert started as the sun sets, and by the end the nightmare is in full swing.

The reason I was saying before about songs heard already, is the fact you might notice certain songs not played here. ""Only Women Bleed"", ""Elected"", ""Be My Lover"" etc... that's because they're already on the other releases I mentioned, and I understand setting them aside for a release to make room for others that fans really wanted to hear and have full quality and great sounding versions of on CD. So I will give this 5 stars and not complain. I could complain the only bonus feature is a 20 minute interview with Alice... but then again, what exactly would I want as a bonus feature? Boring footage of stages being set up or photos? Nah, i'll give this 5 stars for being a great live DVD and an even better live album CD release!",1415059200,10,3841,4.4750356633380886

6608133,5,B00N2TYOXA,"This is a great 2CD+1DVD set. Alice proves once again to be the best rock show on earth. The master of theatrics brings another classic rock concert with a band playing tight to bring this phenomenal rock and roll sound to delight all rock and roll followers. Few artists have the quality and musicianship of Alice. Only musicians of this calibre do. Long live Alice Cooper!

6608134,4,B00N2TYOXA,"I'd like to give this 5 stars.... but it's not as great as I'd hoped.  Alice is fine, the band is cookin' and it's a pretty great set list... I saw this show ..well a show on this tour. It's called ""Raise The Dead"" as a tribute to his old drinking buddies ""the Hollywood Vampires"" John Lennon,Keith Moon, JImi Hendrix, and other famous stars and he plays their music in the third act ... you can hear all of it on the 2 CD set that is included but the songs Revolution and Foxy Lady are not in the film. The reason is that Hendrix family  make it very very expensive to get synch rights for his songs (I know this from experience) and I'm going to assume the same was true with Revolution because it isn't in the film portion.  Speaking of the film , while it is HD .... the show started off in daylight and moves to dark and sadly the set looks crappy in daylight and throughout the show the camera angles chosen by the director are usually on the musicians / guitarists NOT playing the killer licks we are hearing.... and they are in LOVE with the shot from behind the musicians into the audience and go to it over and over and over.....

Am I glad I have this on BR and the two GREAT sounding CDs that come with it... YES... OH and a 20 minute interview with Alice as a bonus is terrific.... do I wish it was complete , Yes. Do I wish the cameras were on the players who are playing the notes we are hearing and Alice more than his audience.... yes. Do I wish I could give this 5 stars.... sadly yes.",1413504000,43,1503,4.1020408163265305

6608140,5,B00N2TYOXA,"A Good Show and Alice voice is still there. He sounds very; good on this show and the band is very tight. I have had a few past shows of his which were good and sometimes the voice was a bit strained but this show he is on the money. If you like Alice you will love this show. On This Show Alice plays tribute to his old drinking club The Vampires he was in with the likes of Jim Morrison, John Lennon, Keith Moons to name a few,  he does a few tribute songs of theirs which he normally does not do in concerts but they are pretty impressive. Two that do not show up on the DVD which I was sad not to see were Revolution and Foxy Lady. But with the CDs that come with the package you get them on it.",1437609600,2,699,3.820689655172414

6608161,5,B00N2TYOXA,"I love Alice Cooper so buying this Blu-ray wasn't a choice! There are two problems with this show - one is that the Cooper concert began during daylight hours so the sets, effects and atmosphere during the first half had less impact than normal. As soon as darkness falls the show is visually much better.  The band and Cooper are great day or night though. The second problem is the camera work and editing. Usually the camera longers on ""The Star"" of a show so the viewer gets to enjoy his performance. For some reason the camera kept cutting away from Cooper to the band and crowd shots. Very poor judgment. This does reduce the enjoyment of this concert presentation. We buy a concert to see Alice Cooper onscreen most of the time, not the crowd or other band members.
Alice Cooper's interview, as a Blu-ray extra, is wonderful.",1419379200,4,832,4.583892617449664

6608165,3,B00N2TYOXA,"Having seen Alice Cooper 8 times Live myself you never get bored watching him. The most unfortuante thing about this dvd is the filming. Alice cooper concerts have ALOT going on. Camera angles and shots of the concert could have been better and do not do justice to the creativity of Alice. (Luv to see the great Wayne Isham film Alice one day). This is a great set list though with more ""Stadium Rock"" songs like House Of Fire. It is great to see the return of Ryan Roxie on guitar who really belongs in the AC line up. However Orianthi steals the show. She of course now playing with ritchie Sambora but her playing and looks really do suit the Alice Cooper line up and adds a great deal to the spectacle of his show. A good addition for any Alice Cooper fan but I personally still prefer Brutal Planet dvd.",1417910400,,809,4.328947368421052
