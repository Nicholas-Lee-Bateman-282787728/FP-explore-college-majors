2818052,3,B000PFT3OO,"Oscar makes sure you get that he is playing down to you and he and his partners are having fun making some money babysitting.  The best track on the DVD is the Menu screen soundtrack played in a Funky Dm with lots of possibilities but he doesn't include that in the jam tracks.  He and his partners are animated and having fun but the joke is always on you as they fail to lead you to any serious ground.  Lots of fun in one way, disappointing in another.  A serious set of jams with a few musical twists could convince you they were trying to lead you to the higher ground.  Oscar doesn't even explain what he is playing so you can learn his rhythm licks.  So, you sit over there while he and the band have some fun making it simple.  See you next week and close the door on the way out.",1373155200,,788,4.077922077922078
2818053,4,B000PFT3OO,"What you'll ""learn"" from this DVD is debatable, but you are guaranteed to always have some fun on tap for a spare moment or an entire rainy day.  The band is tight and you have the option to loop tracks.  Practice to your hearts content, with a bass player that never shows up high, a drummer that never winds up drunk and a band that never gets tired.  So it's not too realistic but that's a good thing, and still lots of fun!",1244505600,2,427,4.120481927710843
2818054,5,B000PFT3OO,"I'll just chime in with all the above.
For me, as a novice, watching the band and picking up on their cues
has been most helpfull",1230422400,2,129,4.0
2818055,3,B000PFT3OO,"This is an excellent set of blues backing tracks.  It includes slow blues, a couple of shuffles, blues in minor key and even a Latin type flavor blues.  The tracks are about five minutes long give or take, and you set up your guitar (or harmonica or any other instrument theoretically) and jam.  It's that simple.  I intend to be jamming to this for a while.

The back up band that plays this is Oscar Jordan and the Mighty Sons of Hercules.  This is an actual band that makes recordings and plays in clubs.  It's a talented band and a professionally made dvd.  In addition to the backgroud tracks there are three live performances of the band.",1204675200,10,644,4.444444444444445
2818056,5,B000PFT3OO,"Great buy.  Easy to use, lets you just set up at the TV and switch over to a practice session when the mood hits.  The advantage in softwares such as Band In The Box for practice at least for me, has been that you can transpose whatever track you have to any or every key if you feel like it - however the setup overhead to getting everything around the computer that I need to practice is more time comsuming.  Just using the DVD on the TV and having these sessions right there makes it not only easy but also fun. The variations are very nice, the latin flavor blues, slow shuffles, or rocking tempos, give you a nice workout.  The visual queues from the ""band"" on the TV screen are great - more realistic then playing off a software lead sheet on a PC screen.  It is worth the money and a must have for anyone buying or working on the ""learn these licks"" or scales instruction books on the blues topic.  Takes all the tedium out of learning new licks or even running your scales.",1193443200,13,982,4.224598930481283

These guys make it real easy to get your chops good and improve the standard of your lead playing. It is so easy to use, the tune up section gets you ready and away you go. Everyone who owns a guitar and plays the blues should own this DVD, $20 so cheap for such an important tool.",1187136000,12,761,7.193548387096774
2818058,5,B000PFT3OO,"I have to admit, I purchased this DVD as more of a novelty, and was happily proven wrong.  It was a blast, and with much more content and effective instruction than I initially thought. The musicianship of Oscar Jordan and his band is a great inspiration to improve my own skills.  The DVD was easy to follow, and production quality is excellent.  Highly recommended!",1181865600,9,367,4.703125
2818059,5,B000PFT3OO,"this DVD is a step above the rest.  i am not the best guitar player, but i have so much fun jamming out with this blues band!  they say, ""time flys by when your having fun!""  well, the 1st time i played this DVD, i didn't put my guitar down for 5 hours!!  haha  great buy!",1181174400,5,272,3.7857142857142856
8191020,5,B000PFT3OO,Great backup band to play along with.,1468540800,,37,4.428571428571429
8191021,2,B000PFT3OO,"This DVD seemed a great idea - having a ""backup band"" to play with while practicing alone, however, this is more these three guys playing and sure, join in if you can. I was expecting something along the lines of ""karaoke guitar"" - where the rhythm section would consist of a subdued rhythm guitar with drums and bass being predominant. This DVD is like the band filmed themselves in a garage and marketed it as ""play along""... it's not really.

Wish I hadn't got it.",1459468800,,467,4.4941176470588236

8191023,5,B000PFT3OO,These are nice jams. They are long enough to get a real feel for the songs. First time I used this I played for an hour non-stop. One of the better jam discs.,1457568000,,158,3.8181818181818183
8191024,1,B000PFT3OO,This is just a bunch of guys playing with no instruction at all. Don't waste your money.,1456790400,,88,4.235294117647059

8191026,4,B000PFT3OO,"Limited number of tracks but those that are there are perfect to Jam to. For $10.00 you can't go wrong if you want a band of your own to play with.
Recommended!!",1454716800,,161,4.0625
8191027,3,B000PFT3OO,"It's alright but as they say , it could have been staged a little bit better. Tiny bit amateurish though.",1454198400,,105,4.3
8191028,3,B000PFT3OO,"This is only okay.  The musicians on here are talented, but this isn't a very good teaching tool.  I'm not wild about the selections chosen to jam to.  Personal preference.",1453420800,,172,4.666666666666667
8191029,5,B000PFT3OO,"Loved this, great sound and easy to follow instructions on playing blues",1449878400,2,72,5.083333333333333
