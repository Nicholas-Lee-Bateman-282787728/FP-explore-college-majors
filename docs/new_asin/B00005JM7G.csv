1566890,2,B00005JM7G,"This is the third film by Lukas Moodysson (""Show me love"", ""Together""), and it's definitely not of the same caliber as the first two. Some of the plot details are not quite convincing, even in the light of harsh post-Soviet realities. But this is a minor flaw when compared to terrible acting by the main supporting actor (Artyom Bogucharsky). Every single line this ""cardboard"" cherub recites sounds artificial, as if memorized by rote, and badly at that. This renders all of the scenes in which he is involved unconvincing. The film is carried by the main heroine (Oksana Akinshina), who is, no doubt, a very talented actress. Overall, the film disappoints - I expected nothing short of great from Lukas Moodysson.",1175299200,,716,4.925619834710743
1566891,5,B00005JM7G,i cannot believe how good this film was in using music and image to evoke such emapthy from me for a fictional character-show this film to all the spoiled brats of the world.,1173225600,4,174,4.303030303030303
1566892,5,B00005JM7G,"Certain films evoke moods within us. We all have a favorite film, a film we enjoy for various reasons. We might find it entertaining, funny, or just cool. Then there's that film we can't categorize. A film that gives us a strange feeling in the pit of our stomach, a movie that leaves us stricken. This could be attributed to the subject matter of the film or, more specifically, how that subject matter is handled. Maybe it contains something you longed for or long for, something you can relate to (no matter how metaphorically), or maybe it has to do with the way you connect with the characters on a deep emotional level...Or maybe it's just something that happens to me. Few films have done to me, after a first viewing, what ""Lilya 4-Ever"" has done. The only the movies that have left me with that same feeling (off the top of my head) are ""Thirteen"" and ""All the Real Girls."" The former because it reminded me of those crazy events in adolescence and the latter because I could relate to those feelings one goes through during that period of ""young love."" None of those films, however, left me with a feeling this intense. Nothing that happens in ""Lilya 4-Ever"" has happened to me. But even writing this review, I still have that strange feeling in my stomach and I still find myself dwelling on parts of the film. The beautiful Oksana Akinshina plays Lilya, a 16-year-old girl, who opens the film on the verge of jumping off a highway overpass. It's clear that it's not going to be a happy movie. Backtracking, we meet Lilya as she tells everyone that she's moving to America. Her mother has met and fallen in love with a Russian man, who is taking them all with him to America. Lilya sees it as a chance to escape from the gloomy suburb of the former Soviet Union in which she lives. Then, her mother drops a bombshell. Lilya will stay there, while she and her boyfriend go to America...Later, they will send for her. As soon as her mother is gone, things go downhill for Lilya. She is evicted from the flat she shared with her mother and moved to a much dirtier, rundown one she hates immediately. Lilya seems to have only one friend, but once her friend convinces people that Lilya is a prostitute, Lilya severs ties with her. The only friend Lilya is left with is the 14 year old Volodya. Volodya is in love with Lilya and serves her as a guardian angel of sorts, protecting (or, at least, trying to protect) her from all the evils of the world. He's only 14, but much more perceptive than Lilya and clearly harbors feelings for her that she doesn't understand. Pretty soon, finding herself without money, Lilya turns to prostitution to make some. When she meets a nice man named Andrei, who offers her the chance to get a job and a flat in Sweden, she gives up prostitution and decides to go with him. Volodya sees there's something not right with the situation and warns her not to go. I haven't read any of the other reviews on Amazon, but I have no doubt that other reviewers have revealed what happens to Lilya once she reaches Sweden. Roger Ebert did in his review. Having said that, I won't say what happens. It makes the blow much more devastating. The feeling I mentioned that was evoked during my viewing, I had experienced with the movies I mentioned above. Those movies I wanted to see again, right away. This movie, I'm debating whether I want to see it again or not. This is, without a doubt, one of the most depressing films I've ever seen. I have never cried during a film (I came close once with ""Million Dollar Baby""), but this film almost made me do it. Oddly enough, most viewers won't like it. Some might even find it stupid. This film just has some effect on me, one which I can't truly explain. The reason for this feeling might lie inside the character of Volodya. For Volodya, Lilya is the girl of his dreams. Everyone has felt this at some point. Few people have actually lived alone with this girl and slept next to her, however...Certainly not at his age. For him, she's everything and yet, he can't keep her or have her to himself. She's untouchable. To Lilya, Volodya is a friend whom she loves...In the end, Volodya is her everything. This is a great film that remains largely unmentioned in film circles. It's depressing, has a gloomy atmosphere to it, and is making me want to cry. So, needless to say, it's not the kind of movie one whips out on a Friday night to watch with the family. We all have favorite movies. Movies that entertain us, make us laugh, make us quote the dialogue...This one will keep your eyes glued to the screen, but can hardly be called entertainment. If you're laughing at this film, you might need to see a doctor and make sure you have a heart and a soul. There's no dialogue that's worth quoting. But whether you love, hate, can't explain how you feel about this film (much like me), or all of the above...You'll remember Lilya forever.

1566893,5,B00005JM7G,"Even though this film is subtitled which is in itself drudgery by American standards, it radiates primordial truths about human nature that held my eyes hostage. I have personally seen young girls born to broken homes in this country suffer similiar fates. Survival trumps all other interests in the human animal and this film takes that premise to its utterly devastating consequences. If this doesn't touch your soul then it should be on display in a museum.",1144368000,3,460,4.987012987012987
1566894,5,B00005JM7G,"A movie you can't ""Love"", that's not why I gave it 5 stars, but it is a very important movie for all to see. Lukas Moodysson has cemented himself as one of the great young directors in Europe with this dark, extremely depressing, yet very important film. After watching Lilya's life unfold into what can only be described as ""literally"" hell on earth (Even worse then hell on earth), You will never forget her pain, her face (and in so, the millions of faceless children & adults who are enslaved in the underground sex industry that Lilya's character represents). At least that's the little bit of hope that I got from the story, which is filled with everything except hope. You will be mentally drained and mad as hell at the human race when this movie is over, but to me that's great movie making. A very, very, important movie!",1128902400,15,831,4.546666666666667
1566895,5,B00005JM7G,"Please do not watch this DVD if you are of weak nerve or are not interested in looking at how cruel life can treat people at the edge of our ""civilised world"".

Lilja is a 16 year old girl who lives on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, Russia, with her mother, who meets a man who takes her to the USA with her - the only problem is that (all of a sudden)he is not willing to take Lilja with him, and thus she finds herself left behind in their poorly furnished family apartment with hardly any money and a sadistic aunt who ""looks after her"". But this is not an Oliver Twist like story, instead it gets even worse when Lilja meets a young man from Sweden who promises her not only love but also work in his home country. Lilja leaves Russia without thinking - only to find herself forced to prostitution. There is no hope, and nothing can prevent the end's catastrophe from happening.

This is life, this is whta happens every day all around the world. And THIS is painfully realistic cinema at its best. Again, as in ""Show me love"", it is astounding how well acted the movie is - the young girl playing the lead really makes you shiver and at many points during the film you have to remidn yourself that this is in fact not a documentary... If art is to change the way how we look at our society and if movies can at all stir up issues we usually like to push away from ourselves, then this is the ideal example of how important a movie can be these days and how well crafted it can be made.",1120348800,17,1492,4.177083333333333
7941762,5,B00005JM7G,"This review is from: Lilya 4-Ever [DVD] [2002] (DVD) - Sweden.

ufffffff - with the mighty force of a tyson-esque punch, Lilya hits me right in the stomach. Is it a documentary feature - is it fiction?

There are tears welling up in my eyes, what's just happened?

104 minutes from brilliant and powerful - from sad and truthful towards outrageous and enraging. What else?
Furious, hopeless, redemptive ........ all of that.

This film is a tour de force for the viewer, makes him feel the sorrow and pain of this little unbending/indomitable heroine of everyday life, the 16-year-old Lilya, who deserves all the luck in the world - and yet, almost all of whom she ever trusts, they let her down.

She is insulted, spit at, kicked and worse. Stay strong, lil Lilya, I knock on wooooooooooood for you. Life is not always so damn bitchy. Lilya, do not let your head hang low, after all you have to save the world! If not you, who else?

But all hope is in vain in a world that is as cold as the dark side of the moon ..... and my heart is burning fiercely (to balance the temperature).
The young actress Oksana Akinshina ""plays"" Lilya in such a relentlessly ""naked"" way, which literally makes me kneel down in awe. She plays, as if her life is at stake. A genuine revelation. This result also, of course, partly stems from the fantastic honest direction by Lukas Moodysson from Sweden - he wrote and directed the story of a born/made loser in post-communist Latvia. And he is no less relentless, glosses over nothing and shows a merciless world, which has its human face averted in the vacuum of post-communist values....
This is what counts now: strong and bony elbows to shove others away and selfishness. What a pity!

Conclusion:
One of the most impressive and most memorable films (incl. an unforgettable heroine) that I've ever seen.
Lilya 4-ever shows the extraordinary power that a small indie film can develop. So fantastic! Poetic masterpiece! Yes!
Made in sweden - and just right, if you are tasteful and unshallow. You will be overwhelmed, if only you are pure at heart.
Watch - feel - burn!

CHRS, >>>>> th ntwstr - Rating = 95% - masterpiece

7941763,5,B00005JM7G,"This movie has been reviewed. I want to add a few notes. Story is ture--but was about a girlfrom Sweden. How the story could be true--if you saw the ending...I do not know who wrote it? In any case---this shows what is going on in Russia these days. It is sad, even more sad no one aids these people from USA. No start up programs, no welfare system, no resources in Russia. While the War Machine marches on for Oil and Resources and bragging rights in The Middle East and South America..millions are living a horrible fate. This movie WILL leave an impression on you. Even those of us who no longer HAVE emotions weined on Hollywood movies with no real depth. the first half is much better than the second. Why? because the TONE of the film changes..it moves along quickly and the horrors go on...but when the film heads overseas you do not FEEL the same despair, isolation, abuse, rape and hopelessness. It all adds up to the inevitable but it actually should have been MORE graphic in the second half to bring the point home and maybe make this a bit more URGENT. (When I refer to ""graphic"" I do not mean 'nudity"") I meant inner demons within Lilya, emotional breakdowns 9she seemed rather subdued considering what she is going through...you could say she is emotionally numb but still something more shocking when you weight the first half which is virtual NIGHTMARE, the second half is TAME. Still, a very poweful film that speaks truth about parts of the world never mentioned on USA networks. I wonder what the KARDASHIANS would have done if they were left in the apartment her Aunt confined her to. I guess ""urban rewneal"" hasn;t hit Soviet nations.",1338768000,,1657,4.601351351351352

7941765,5,B00005JM7G,"An unbridled force of nature, writer/director Lukas Moodysson`s LILJA 4-EVER crashes on seldom explored beaches like a tsunami, forever leaving it's mark on the landscape of film as not just one of the greatest tragedies ever and the best film of 2002, but as one of the most memorable and emotionally charged experiences you will ever have in front of a screen.",1324080000,,362,4.854838709677419
7941766,5,B00005JM7G,"This is an important movie about a subject that is not discussed often enough in the western press.  In my opinion there is not enough help for Eastern Europe and Russia.  Therer are a lot of promising and bright people that are not getting a chance in life because the systems they live under are not adequate and because of lingering post soviet / socialist culture.

Lilja 4-ever shows us how bad life can become for some of the young women in these situations.  Young women in these countries are often very beautiful, innocent, naive, and have very few options.

This is a realistic depiction of what can happen.  This is a dark, disturbing movie, but I urge you to sit through it to its conclusion and reflect on how our brothers and sisters are living on the other side of the world.",1242345600,5,790,4.489510489510489
7941767,5,B00005JM7G,"The Bottom Line:

An incredibly depressing and moving story of a girl in the ex-USSR who gets pulled into prostitution, Lilya-4-Ever is elevated to greatness by the sweetly vulnerable and sympathetic performance by Oksana Akinshina in the lead, who ensures that the audience is involved in the tragedy rather than detached from it--don't let the subtitles deter you from this gem.",1241395200,,380,5.229508196721311

7941769,5,B00005JM7G,"I highly recommend this movie. It really does a great job of telling the story of what life is like for many people in Russia and the former Soviet Union, and will open your eyes to the unfortunate reality of human trafficking and sexual slavery. I personally think that the last part of the film should have been done differently, and that really brought the film down a few notches in my book. But because of the overall power of the film I still feel it's worthy of 5 stars. Because of what it's about... it's not a film that you will really ""enjoy"", but it's still a great movie that's definitely worth watching.",1219968000,2,616,4.412280701754386
7941770,5,B00005JM7G,"This film is one of the best of the last ten years.  Its difficult subject matter, but the story and character are executed with such emotional precision, it challenges that line between fiction and life.  You forget this is a film, and assume the identity of a young Russian girl bought and sold for sex.  I think all men and young women should see this film, for the rest of their lives there will be that emotional watermark.  Everyone I know has been forced to take a few days to recover after viewing the film, its so powerful; meeting a sex slave might be one step further, but only by one step.",1208736000,2,601,4.339285714285714
7941771,5,B00005JM7G,"Forget ""Hostel."" Tales like Lilya's are the true horror stories of Eastern Europe after the fall of the former Soviet Union. As children unloved and betrayed, and surviving in conditions that would drive adults to desperation, Lilya and Volodya will break your heart and stay in your memory for a long time. The two young actors who play Lilya and Volodya are outstanding. Those of you who have seen The Bourne Supremacy may remember the actress who plays Lilya here; she had a small role in that film as a young Russian woman.

I have no idea why this film is unavailable in Region 1 format. It's a classic. It deserves to be a part of the standard American cineast's collection.

As another poster said, get it on Netflix. You shouldn't miss this one.",1194912000,3,753,4.611940298507463
