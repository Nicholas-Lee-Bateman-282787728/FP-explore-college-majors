8394012,2,B003BVWSKU,"This dvd is not worth the money presentation wise it is nice and that is as far as it goes. There are several interior scenes which are pretty giving you maybe 10 minutes in all the rest of the dvd is taken up with  a story line about the history of the castle and the  local scenery.
an other distraction was the sound track  there was a bad flaw with the dialogue you got  voice under in  german with the main  dialogue in english trying to drown the german very distracting
I had visited the castle in 1961 and enjoyed the tour  this dvd comes a 2 for showing off this delightful  building and  frankly the whole disc is a mess",1392768000,,630,4.140495867768595
