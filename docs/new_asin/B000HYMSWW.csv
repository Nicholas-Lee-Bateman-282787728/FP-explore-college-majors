The story revolves around a couple Suzy and Mike who are in Ibiza for vacation. There are a number of people the couple meet during their stay including some hot girls on motorbikes, a couple of gay men, a rich nerdy mama's boy and a couple of crooks. The scenery is nice and while the acting is so so, the main characters are above average. There's an abundance of nudity but no hardcore stuff. By the way I have the English dubbed version of this film. This is the German one and is in the PAL format. With the exception of Queen's ""Play The Game"", the music is pretty cheesy. They didn't even use Lipps, Inc.'s original version of ""Funkytown"" but some horrible cover version. All in all it's a typical low budget b-movie, but I enjoyed it.",1510185600,,873,4.329268292682927
8142567,3,B000HYMSWW,"I first saw this movie on cable, dubbed in English. Gorgeous women fill the screen, but the plot is not well written and the repeat of ""Funky Town"" throughout is a little over the top. Tanja Spiess is beautiful and sexy, and was cast because of it. Though the is not plot not well written, has its funny moments and adds a dash of homosexuality and a flash transgender.",1486080000,,369,4.36231884057971
8142568,5,B000HYMSWW,"I've wanted this movie ever since I first saw it (and taped it on VHS tape) about 20 years ago on late night cable station Cinemax (off their Cinemax After Dark late night schedule) The scantily dressed girls are absolutely gorgeous, and though the movie is only in german with no english subtitles, it is still enjoyable-in other words, you don't really need english dubbing to understand whats going on. An added plus is that the picture quality is very good, and is (to my unexpected surprise) 16X9 enhanced, filling up my entire widescreen 55 inch tv screen!!! All in all, an exceptional, very entertaining purchase/addition to my collection!",1475452800,,646,4.935779816513762
8142569,1,B000HYMSWW,"Lots of beautiful women in a poor production. The director did not take good use of footage, in beautiful scenaries. Poor nudity. Not a good purchase. Do not buy it.",1194393600,,165,4.533333333333333
