4003117,5,B002VYX8AW,"I loved it from the beginning to the end of the series. Highly addictive and I highly recommend it. My boyfriend doesn't like romance much but even he found it entertaining. Humorous, quirky, very sweet, very thoughtful and heart tugging moments. A full 5 star from me and my boyfriend.",1316995200,,286,4.74
4003118,5,B002VYX8AW,"Really enjoyed both seasons of this.  Have seen all 3 versions of this, and think the Korean version is the best.  Subtitles are good, and DVD qualities are also excellent.",1312588800,6,172,4.7
4003119,5,B002VYX8AW,"Beautiful story.  Recommended for family as no adult materials.  I don't let my 12-years old son watch TV shows anymore as there are too many inappropriate commercials for children.  Though my family is not Korean, we just love to watch Korean drama as story has good morality in characters.  In this drama, the story is about four young wealthy teen guys living with luxury materials and attending rich private school.  They were so famous in the school that everyone called them F4.  These guys drive nice car, dress nicely, and vacationing in nice private area.  When they are alone, they felt saddened and lonely inside because missing the love from family.  Two of F4 guys felt in love with one girl.  She was not pretty, rich, or smart.  Rather, she was just one humble, funny, and kind-hearted person.  Beside going to school and working one part-time job, she also volunteer to clean up one clinic to overcome her depress.  It makes her feel that many people in the clinis were more saddened than what she has to go through.  One F4 guy decided to spend a day with the girl's family to see what is life in a real family. He was very happy to see everyone care for each other. Must see...",1309737600,3,1195,4.553990610328638
4003120,5,B002VYX8AW,"Great show.  Appropriate for all ages.  Three generations of my family do not speak Korean and at first the grandchildren were reluctant to watch the first episode, but quickly became addicted to this series and now they talk about it, sing the songs (phonetically, of course) and because homework and chores come first, anticipate with much excitement for the next episodes.",1303776000,7,375,5.131147540983607
4003121,5,B002VYX8AW,"This is the 2nd Korean dvd I got. I am very satisfied for amazon's customer service. Compared to my other dvd which I got from different sellers, the quality is so much better. My frustrations was with the translations. Since I have been watching it online (fansub)at least I understand a little Korean.
The story line is very common. I love how the story revolves with their friendship, how they found love and the comparison between rich and poor. It's just unbelievable that all the rich,& hot guys falls in love with the not so pretty and poor girl named Jandi. This dvd is mostly recommended for younger audiences coz they can relate it very well. With this dvd I also end up buying the F4 limited edition cd. Wow, Jun Pyo and Yi Jung songs are in there.",1291766400,7,759,4.467625899280575
4003122,5,B002VYX8AW,"Sequel to first DVD box, Boys over flowers is a mega hit in Korea then became a worldwide household name in the whole Asia in 2009. The storyline was based on a japanese manga comics about a poor girl going into an elite school and meeting the elite snobbish group of four guys called the F4. Because of her integrity she managed to befriend the F4 and started to hang out with them. The leader of the F4 started to like her and soon enough they became a couple. Like any couple in k drama, there's always a snag into having a happy ending. This 2nd box set continues Jandi story without the leader of the F4 while Junpyo had to face his role as the heir to the Shinhwa Corp. He pushes Jandi aside to prevent from hurting her more. A lot of heartbreaks and crying in this box set and viewers will fill helpless and empty while Junpyo is away. Meanwhile Jandi and jihoo, another F4 member became really close and Jihoo falls for her even more. But who will end up with Jandi? Will Junpyo come back for her or will Jihoo become her new knight?",1285459200,18,1041,4.236180904522613
4003123,5,B002VYX8AW,"Boys Over Flowers is a great drama! Definitely one of my favourite. I've seen all three versions of Hana Yori Dango and this one is by far the best! The Jap version is good too, but this one has better looking actors and actresses, and each of the F4 gets a little background story about themselves, which was very interesting and well set out. Scenery is beautiful, storyline is awesome and the characters are all very likeable. Overall this is a MUST HAVE drama! I highly recommend it.",1266624000,4,487,4.545454545454546
4003124,5,B002VYX8AW,"This is the 1st ever korean drama I have ever watched full length (volumes 1 & 2 by YA Entertainment). And is has changed my viewing habits. I watched it over and over and over for the Nth time. Just be careful buying your copy. If you do not understand korean, MAKE sure you get the ORIGINAL copy to get the perfect English subtitle.",1266364800,29,334,4.234375
4003125,5,B002VYX8AW,I love the story and is also a great manga read. The director did the best they could to fit in real life situations and almost followed the story from the manga. It's well done.,1259884800,15,178,4.114285714285714
4003146,5,B002VYX8AW,"This drama is amazing. I loved it sooo much. I had heard that this drama was great but i was hesitant to get it because i didn't want to be disappointed. Thankfully i wasnt,this drama is great and youll love it. The packaging and quality is also amazing i highly recommend it.",1357257600,,276,4.326923076923077
4003147,5,B002VYX8AW,One of the best shows. Has the potential of making you a K drama junky.  You will love the whole crew. It's great family viewing.,1355788800,,129,4.16
4003148,1,B002VYX8AW,I love the series but I hate what this company did to it.  Some of the music has been changed and even some of the sound effects which completely changes the tone of some of the best scenes. It is most noticeable in the last episode in 3 of my favorite scenes which have been changed from the original music to crappy piano pieces.  I am extremely disappointed with this decision and it ruined the whole thing for me.  I have had to find an original Korean release and has turned me off buying the US releases.,1347753600,4,510,4.237113402061856
4003149,5,B002VYX8AW,"This is one of the best k-dramas ever made, words can't express Boys Over Flowers, and I can't say enough about the infamous F-4. They are good-looking, rich, and powerful. This is k-drama that's very good from the beginning to the end. There was never a dull moment. Though I wasn't crazy about the ending. (The Japanese version ending was much better). Never the less, it is well written and the actors are good (except for the leading lady). Not to mention the sound track is kick a@@. I highly recommend this k-drama.",1342915200,,521,4.612903225806452
4003150,5,B002VYX8AW,"Based on the popular Japanese Manga, season two will definitely not disappoint.  I LOVE THIS DRAMA SERIES!  Kept thinking about the series after I finished and have even started watching it again.  Just when you think everything is finally going Jandi and Junpyo's way, his mother comes barreling in even more determined to keep the two apart.  Her family becomes homeless, Junpyo is cold and distant towards her, and an arranged marriage comes into play.  Oh, and did I mention, Junpyo's sister hires Jandi as their house maid?  Poor Jandi!  Thank goodness she has the love and support from the other F4 boys, especially Jihoo who is always there to protect her.  This season definitely takes you on an emotional roller coaster.  Plus, it involves more back story on the other F4 members.  Oh, and be prepared.  Just when you think issues get solved, another twist happens in the story.  Through it all, the F4 and Jandi realize just how important family, friendship, and loyalty are and that you must fight to appreciate and cherish true love.",1341878400,4,1045,4.84180790960452
4003151,5,B002VYX8AW,This the continuation of the vol 1. I didn't like the ending becuase they rushed it to finished it. But I love the actors. All four guys are sooooo handsome! I think I would choose Kim Hyun Joong over all of them but Kim Bum would be my second choice. Lee Min Ho is just too tall but he is cute. I wish I had friends like them!,1341792000,,327,3.823529411764706
4003152,5,B002VYX8AW,"This was one of the first Korean shows I have ever watched.  I loved it!  I don't get caught up in tv shows but I did this one! I was actually yelling at the screen! (Yep, I know. I'm sad :) But it was so good! there were so many twists and turns I had no idea how it would eventually all turn out!  Great series!",1334016000,,313,3.712121212121212
4003153,5,B002VYX8AW,"If you liked Boys Over Flowers, how could you not want to see and own the second volume which is the finale. I just love the evolution of the characters and strength of the young woman in the series. I thought it dreadful how her family exploited her, but she holds no resentment toward them and loves them. Is this realistic to how Korean families are toward there daughters? I notice a trend and I can only feel that the spirit of young women to be very loving and strong. When the mother dumps salt on the wealthy woman's head, I am sure all watching cheered, but knew horrific consequences were coming in the near future. I also see a trend in encouraging young women to not feel they have to sacrifice their hopes, dreams and ambitions on marriage. They are portrayed as strong enough to make a decision to follow a career even if it means seperation from the man they love. If the love is true it will survive. I think this is so wise. I wish it had been taught to me. Confidence in oneself as a woman is something many societies do not teach much less families. You must have both 1 & 2  to complete the story. I highly recommend this series to all who love Korean drama.",1330300800,6,1178,4.2825112107623315

8382642,1,B002VYX8AW,"I have bought the first 25 episodes, which ended before JanDi gave answer to proposal. However, after reading comments they are commenting on same box set. The first one. What I want to hear is some excerpts  from the episodes after proposal. Did she say yes? How did his mother react? Did her friend get with So Yijong?  I will not buy volume 2 if is just the first box set, with new cover. So please someone tell me if this is truly a continuation of the first 25 episodes. Otherwise, customers will not be buying this product. And I agree with customers who say 2 is way too much money.  From $299 to $399 for both sets. Ridiculous!!!!. 5 star if new.  1 star if duplicate of volunteers 1.",1433030400,,692,4.3

The movie itself tho is worth 60 bucks but I wouldn't pay more.",1393891200,,255,4.0
