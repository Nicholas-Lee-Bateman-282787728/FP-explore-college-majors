5696055,1,B00C7F9V4C,"The description of the DVD says ""Includes the Full Commercial-free Championship Game"". A segment of the game IS missing. The segment from the 4:34 mark to the under four minute timeout at 3:52 is missing. There should be a recall of this disc and the disc should be re-authored to include the missing footage. Terrible! No excuse!!",1374537600,,331,4.824561403508772
5696056,3,B00C7F9V4C,I gave this as a gift and I received complaints about the quality of the film and that at a certain point it went from 75 points to 78 points but he didn't get to see the shot that took them to 78 points.  Since it was a gift I was a little disapointed.,1374192000,,253,3.685185185185185
5696057,2,B00C7F9V4C,"Very, very poor sound volume, can not hear the ""play by play"" announcers!  Disappointed. This is not the quality I had hoped for.
Will not recommend.",1372636800,,149,4.730769230769231
5696058,4,B00C7F9V4C,Part of ball game was missing for some reason.  Enjoyed  watching Louisville win.  Hope that they win again next year!,1371772800,,118,4.8
5696059,4,B00C7F9V4C,Waited a long time to be able to watch Louisville win another title. The last time they won it was on VHS and didn't know what a DVD was. I think Rick has got his MOJO back.,1371168000,,173,3.7027027027027026
5696060,2,B00C7F9V4C,"About 40 seconds of the game are missing.  Where Georgi has a pretty hook shot late in the game.
I don't know if this is the official NCAA version or not.  If there is another version I recommend not buying this one.",1371081600,,216,4.119047619047619
5696061,2,B00C7F9V4C,"I totally agree with the other reviews. Missing approx 40 seconds of the game. Not the best video shot that's for sure? No HD. No other final 4 games, nothing mentioned about the Big East Tourney? I'm a die hard Cards fan. Very dissappointed with this video. Isn't this 2013. I've seen better games on VHS? If you don't have this I do recommended just because it was such a outstanding basketball game. This video could have been a whole lot better. Thanks for listening!!",1370304000,2,472,4.564705882352941
5696062,2,B00C7F9V4C,"Ditto, what the other reviewers said.  Very shoddy editing.  Plus it's not in HD, and should be.

I'll probably watch it over and over, because it's my Cards, but whoever was in charge of this DVD project should not have been.",1370131200,,226,4.463414634146342
5696063,2,B00C7F9V4C,"Echo the previous comment about this production.  No real Bonus features at all.  I am a huge Louisville fan and waited nearly 2 months for this?  No recap or highlights of the regular season, Big East Tourney or any earlier round matchups against Wichita State, Duke, Oregon etc....Nothing?

Add to this all, the game against Michigan, while a great quality picture, it is actually NOT the complete game.  There is a 40 plus second gap in the game late in the second half where they go to a tv timeout with the score U of L 71 MICH 65  at the 4:34 Mark and they ""come back"" from that break with the score NOW: Louisville 73 MICH 65 at the 3:52 mark.  They completly miss a Gorgui Dieng made hook shot that pushed the Ville lead to 73 and then a foul by Hancock on Hardaway.

So the game comes back with Hardaway at the line, an increased score and you hear Hancock now has 4 fouls..... but you never see any of this.

THIS is supposed to be a top flight production that took THIS length of time to put together?  Really?

THIS is what the Louisville Cardinals Basketball team deserved?  This is what they get?

Some Respect.  Makes me think a Kentucky fan was in charge of this production.

Extremely disappointed.

As a Cardinals fan, of course you will want to pick this up. Because it is history and the Ville won their 3rd National Championship. Cards fans WANT this DVD and will buy it.

But be prepared to feel very slighted in what you ultimately get.

First no Hardbound version of the Sports Illustrated Commemorative Issue and now this.  Nice treatment of a champion.

5696064,2,B00C7F9V4C,"The DVD includes most of the televised broadcast including pregame show, game, halftime show, and post game ceremonies.  But that is all it includes. Amazon's description of the DVD states that it includes ""Bonus Features."" With about a two-month wait from the date of the game until this DVD was available, I naively assumed the DVD's ""Bonus Features"" might include cool extras beyond what was aired game night--things like interviews with and/or biographies of key players, coaches; maybe a 'Road to the Championship' mini-documentary...  The video does NOT even include the ""One Shining Moment"" video that was aired directly after the game.  Of what is included is of fine video quality. However, if you DVRed the game, you already have more than this DVD even includes.  However, the game on the DVD is commercial free.  Overall, disappointing.",1369958400,2,848,5.160583941605839
8578172,1,B00C7F9V4C,This is the second video that I purchased....Recording of it has glitches ,1519862400,,74,5.166666666666667
8578173,5,B00C7F9V4C,"Wonderful.  Just Wonderful.

After watching the End of an Era: Freedom Hall program, I assumed this would be glitchy and low production value, but was okay with that, if it had the whole game.  I was astounded to see that its production value was great - tremendous - just as good as when it was aired.  I didn't get to see the Cards win the Championship in 2013, for various reasons, so Thank You for making this available.

The game itself is beautifully filmed.  And the game itself was an awesome game.  Both teams going all out, like they should, and battling 3 point shots back and forth.  The refs were very odd, calling touch fouls at one end and the other end, someone pretty much throws a player down and nothing's called.  So that wasn't fun.  But the Cards pulled it out in grand style and it's one of those games I'll watch again and again, and again.  And when I have grandkids, I can introduce them to Rick Pitino and the Louisville Cardinals with this program.

I was happily surprised that they added the Prelude to a Championship - though they seemed to focus more on Michigan than Louisville, but that's okay - I'm sure a Michigan fan would say just the opposite.  They also showed the halftime show with Charles Barkley, Greg Gumble and the other guys.  It was nice to see them, because I enjoyed their take on the game.  Even if I didn't agree with some of it.

They also included the Post Game ceremonies, interviews, presentation of the Naismith award to Trey Burke of Michigan and the Most Valuable Player award.  There were the typical interviews with Rick and Peyton Siva too.  Great game - one of the best in my opinion, ever played. Run 'N' Gun, baby, Run 'N' Gun.",1457568000,,1692,4.456026058631922

8578175,1,B00C7F9V4C,My copy was scratched. Could not watch second half. Trying to figure out how to send it back?,1405814400,,93,4.222222222222222
8578176,2,B00C7F9V4C,So very disappointed in the quality of this video.  We are from Louisville and wanted to have this for our personal video library.  Not professional quality at all.  I would not recommend buying this to watch.,1397952000,,209,4.75
8578177,5,B00C7F9V4C,"It needs to be said that I purchased a copy of this DVD last week from a different online retailer.  Just before watching it, I read the reviews posted here and was disappointed to see reports that part of the game footage was missing.  However, I just watched the entire game and there was *no* missing footage!  This apparently means that the mistake was corrected at some point.  For those who have purchased the DVD and found the segment of game missing from your copy, I would suggest contacting the folks at teammarketingdvd.com and inquiring about a possible corrected version.

I can fully recommend this DVD for college basketball fans, particularly those who cheer on the University of Louisville.  In addition to the complete game broadcast, the extras included are the pregame lead-in of the broadcast, the halftime analysis and the postgame interviews with Pitino and his players.

Any criticism I offer for this DVD is minor.  There could have been more extras--even the footage shown is not all of what was aired during the telecast.  Also, the back of the DVD case indicates ""semifinal game highlights"" -- something that is not included.",1386028800,,1153,4.932642487046632

8578181,4,B00C7F9V4C,This is a bare bones video of the game but the quality is good. A little of the game is somehow left out.,1375228800,,105,3.608695652173913
