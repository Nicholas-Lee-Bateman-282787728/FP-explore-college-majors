8434907,4,B004LVOII4,"Not all of the episode scenes in the menu screen shots are contained within the programs in the sets. It's not always easy to follow the disjointed stories as they're presented, or to keep track of all the revolving characters. I wish I could say more for it, still it's better than never having become acquainted with these charming characters in the series' early years.",1448236800,,372,4.7384615384615385
8434908,1,B004LVOII4,"Although the Television series Cornonation Street in itself is very enjoyable to watch
this DVDbox isn't fullfilling my expectations.
I was expecting the full integral issue of Coronation Street from the sixties
not just a random selection of episodes.

As a result there are no complete storylines.
It's like seeing a film where the majority of the chapters is left out.

Very frustrating and disappointing to watch.
It's like constant falling in a black hole.

Conclusion: It's a waste of time and money.

I do hope that sooner or later the full integral part of the sixties
of the complete series  of Coronation Street will be published on DVD.
That would be an excellent and great job alike..

In that case for sure it would be very enjoyable and amusing to watch.

I am already looking forward to it.",1403827200,,805,4.748201438848921
8434909,3,B004LVOII4,"I wrongly thought this was a complete collection.  This is episodes from different series, and they do go in order.  Each episode is very good, and well acted, but it doesn't start with the first episode, and it jumps, say from episode 5 to episode 15, etc.  I haven't watched the whole set, but each episode I have watched has different people in it, and it's in the middle of a different story, so, for me, it is like watching a bunch of scenes, rather than a continuing story.  I had wanted to get this for a long time, but now I wish I had spent the money for it.",1400889600,6,567,4.127272727272727
8434910,5,B004LVOII4,"This  brings me back to when i used to be able to watch this on BBC America instead of waht they have on now which are American shows,  duh,  what is BBC meaning by no British programs except 2 and just running American shows.

Coronation Street is Great",1393804800,,254,4.229166666666667
8434911,5,B004LVOII4,"This was a trip down memory lane, as I saw the original series in the UK on a tiny black and white telly.  It is a great historical piece, the characters and story are excellent and the actors do a wonderful job.",1391472000,2,212,4.0476190476190474
8434912,5,B004LVOII4,"I haven't seen this video, but it was bought for a friend who s a complete ""Streeter"" and she thinks it's absolutely amazing.  If you watch this show, get these early videos and you'll see how it all started.",1360368000,2,208,4.333333333333333
8434913,5,B004LVOII4,"Love this series. Warms the heart to know that there really were ""real people"" in the 60's.
Hope the 50th anniversary collection comes out in Region 1 for our viewing pleasure. Will purchase
it in a heartbeat. One can really get hooked on this stuff, after viewing the 60's, I WANT IT ALL.....",1354665600,5,293,4.547169811320755
