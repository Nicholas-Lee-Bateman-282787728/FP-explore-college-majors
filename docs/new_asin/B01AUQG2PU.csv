7613586,4,B01AUQG2PU,"This film may not be Capra's best, but the stars shine and the storytelling is excellent. The best part of the film is the focus on being creative in any field one's heart desires.",1490486400,,180,4.323529411764706

7613591,1,B01AUQG2PU,"WARNING-The Bluray I received from Amazon on 29/10/2016 was SEVERELY defective and not thru any fault of Amazon's. There is clearly a manufacturing/mastering error on this disc- there are numerous spots throughout the disc where the screen goes black but the audio is playing perfectly and this didn't occur on the DVD I rented just this week. Sony clearly screwed up. Will probably have to track down a Sony number to rectify,(assuming they have). Annoying- will update with any info I find out on replacing this bum disc. The movie itself is of course a delightful screwball comedy with Capra's usual championing of the ""little guy"" but don't purchase until this defect is straightened out by Sony.",1477699200,,700,4.9914529914529915

7613594,5,B01AUQG2PU,Lionel Barrymore is superb in this movie. Dub Taylor is so young in it & he had made movies galore. He was in some of the greatest & this is one of them. What a great cast in it  & this movie is still darn funny & hallarious. It's so crazy & zany. This is a must have for any video library. Jimmy Steward is great in it & young as he was. Capra knew what he was doing when he made this one.,1454371200,3,390,3.642857142857143

8748520,3,B01AUQG2PU,"Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) is closing the real estate deal of the century. All he needs to complete this is a small plot of land. Unfortunately the eccentric Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore) that lives there won't sell. This is back in the days that there was no right of domain for private construction.

Anthony's son Tony (James Stewart) the vice president falls in love with his cutie stenographer Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur.) Sort of a ""Drama and Greg"" thing. And just like Drama and Greg all the members of her family seems a tad touched and preoccupied with doing their own thing.

By now you have guest it the stenographer is the grand daughter of the eccentric hold-out. The fun begins when the two families meet and exchanges different philosophies. There are lots of fire works. Than a trap is sprung, netting the lot of them. During the sorting out process we get many long speeches.

How will it all end?
Do we learn anything in the process?
So we may come to the conclusion that ""You Can't Take It With You"" then again?

Based on plays by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart you can see an overwhelming over ride by Director Frank Capra.

Some of the same actors turn up in another Capra film ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946).",1525305600,,1244,4.585585585585585

8748523,5,B01AUQG2PU,"first let me say the price of this movie was just about right for a Blu-ray the picture quality could have been better some remastering was done and it says it's been remastered in 4k I find it hard to believe that the film had degraded so thoroughly that what they transferred was what I saw maybe I'm being a little hard on it I gave it 5 stars because this is a movie worth seeing the stars in this movie or absolutely excellent and the Lessons Learned are completely applicable today's political and human situation this movie is timeless even though it's very dated there's a scene in New York Central Park of Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur having what amounts to an intimate chat Jimmy Stewart talks about something he's dreamed of doing all his life and what it boils down to is zero point Green energy Lionel Barrymore's Park is written in such a way that he is a Centrist and his political views it's very clear that he is you are going to love the part where he talks about isms americanism communism please don't worry all of you hard right types nothing in this is going to make you mad not even the harshest a weird Grandpa's nobody wants to talk to at Thanksgiving will take offense at this movie it is genuinely funny and heartwarming and there are lessons to be learned in this for for everyone and my considered opinion opinions can and do very and that's the way it should be this movie has my highest recommendation even though the picture quality isn't perfect it is clean enough to be enjoyed readily you will like this movie no doubt about it and the price is very good for a Blu-ray as long as it's in the $9 range grab it quick this is one of Capra's best words you'll notice a recurring theme in all of the Capra movies the Blackbird The Crow it's been said that the crows been in just about all of cappers movies I can tell you that in It's a Wonderful Life it's the same Crow you'll also along with several recurring cast members Capra had his crew that he liked and he stuck with them and it's to his credit because they did a very very good job on this movie If you like this order movie this one is definitely one you will never be sorry that you bought add it to your collection while it's still inexpensive and still can be had at some point people are going to lose sight of these things and you're not going to be out there anymore and the way blu-ray releases movies there's just no telling what will pop up and out of production there's nothing about this movie that will offend you the picture quality is well good enough to justify the price and Blu-ray offers a lot of advantages the sound quality is nearly perfect the transfer in general is close to perfect mechanically no splices,, no pops, no hiss the audio quality is excellent the picture quality of the film itself it's not perfect but very very usable from scene to scene is inconsistent but that's not the fault of the format just sloppy production something I've never noticed in seeing it on television in the Past Blu-ray has a tendency to magnify these problems I have noticed but that's because it's a very high-quality mode of presentation I want to thank you for taking the time to read my review I hope it helps you  the movie deserves every Star that I've given it",1520726400,,3271,4.353518821603928

8748526,5,B01AUQG2PU,"When it came down to ""homegrown"" basics, Frank Capra was the ""man.""  The picture quality and storyline are superb!!  This is a great movie to watch during the Holiday Season, because I believe it was a forerunner to, ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" which Capra made some years later!  When viewing a Classic like this....I guess..the only thing that comes to mind, is the ol' clich, ""They just don't make 'em like they use to anymore!""  I'm very selective on Blu-Ray releases, when it comes to the ""Black & Whites,"" and this one fits the ""bill.""",1516838400,2,538,4.631578947368421
