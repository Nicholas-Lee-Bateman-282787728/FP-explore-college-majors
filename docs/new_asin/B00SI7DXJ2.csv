6987588,5,B00SI7DXJ2,Great sitcom - great charactors - Kate Walsh and her sidekick Tone Bell are true chemistry. Thanks for allowing the DVD to be added to my library of favorites.,1427328000,3,159,4.517241379310345
6987589,5,B00SI7DXJ2,"The downfall of NBC's Bad Judge is Simple
NBC dropped the ball on this very smart and actually funny ""Simple"" Sitcom
Due to lack of ""Proper"" Promotion and The running title was the nail in the coffin from the jump
I'm not even sure why NBC bought the rights and financed this
I think it was only picked up due to Will Ferrell & Anne Heche being attached to the project
The Cast is strong and everyone sells the show without being to over the top or hack
Kate Walsh is a super talented actress who can actually be very funny and just plain likeable in this roll
After watching this Complete Series I'm now a life long fan of Miss Walsh (She's Legit funny and took a major Gamble with this Concept) and in the end NBC Burned everyone involved with this show! Which is such a Shame
Why NBC kept the working title Bad Judge is Beyond me
After the major Cluster F$$k known as The Bad Teacher sitcom by CBS
(Which is a Great example CBS is also just a Spin Machine since they are a Company that is quick to brag and push everything they air on there Station as being Amazing tv!
This series is a great example how tv fans are trolls that can't think for themselves and have to jump on the band wagon of Negativity
These same people will Gush and put-over The Big Bang Theory and Mike & Molly think about that
There is a major difference between Bad Teacher & Bad Judge
Bad Teacher has a horrid lead character that wasn't likeable at all! Sad thing is the other stars in Bad Teacher were NOT allowed to shine as Actors (you have Sara Gilbert, Kristin Davis, & David Alan Grier all under-used I hope these 3 got payed good!)
Bad Judge works 'Cause Kate Walsh is just Great and likable  (her performance is very strong you can tell she's having a Good time in the role and that's something you don't see enough in Sitcoms anymore!
The other Cast members are very likable  John Ducey, Ryan Hansen, Miguel Sandoval,Tone Bell,  & Amy Rhodes  all add something to the show
One strange thing Ryan Hansen  who plays  Gary Boyd was also in Bad Teacher.... I'm starting to think he's cursed
The show is Simple it's about a Judge (who's basically a hippie that isn't a typical Suit and tie stuffy Judge)  she's NOT really bad she's Not doing lines of Coke in her chambers or banging defendants or fixing cases to suit her ""evil"" Needs
It's like Night Court minus the night

It gets a 5.8 on IMDB Seriously (Another great example IMDB ratting system is fake and Stacked
it Deserves a solid 8/10 It simple But, very well written and lol funny
Take the time and discover this it's only 13episodes and it doesn't deserve all the ""Phony"" Hate it gets it's a fun simple Comedy everyone should stop bashing it and at least give it a chance",1426636800,5,2714,4.328740157480315
6987590,5,B00SI7DXJ2,This was a show you either loved or hated it. I loved Kate Walsh.  Too bad NBC thought putting it up against scandal was a smart ideal...I mean really NBC whose bright Ideal was that?!!,1426636800,4,185,4.285714285714286
8698414,5,B00SI7DXJ2,"I found this show to be hysterically funny and was extremely disappointed that it was cancelled so early.  The judge runs the kind of courtroom that people wish for, and her crazy life was also fun to follow.  Her best friend and court bailiff is another great character.",1510790400,,271,4.625
8698415,5,B00SI7DXJ2,"A sassy comedy, that will make you want to be bad, with the ""Bad Judge""",1495065600,,71,3.8
8698416,4,B00SI7DXJ2,it's so cool to watch,1483142400,,21,3.4
8698417,5,B00SI7DXJ2,"This was a very underrated comedy, that may have got a bad rep from the start given the title being similar to the Bad Teacher movie and TV shows, each of which were pretty underwhelming.  This is more like the 1980s sitcom Night Court (with a little bit of The Office, Parks and Rec and Arrested Development like humor thrown in there) , which was basically spoofing People's court.  This is basically updating the spoof, given how many variations of People's Court like shows are our there now.  Kate Walsh is great as the judge with a trainwreck of a personal life, but very good at her job.  As was the case with Night Court the supporting characters have a range of strangeness and quirks to them, as do the various trial participants that come through the show.  As is the case with a lot of legal shows, if you have any kind of knowledge of the legal system you basically have to ignore everything the show gets wrong, but the legal process is really not the cornerstone of the show anyway, so it is pretty easy to do.  It is a show that combines over the top absurdity with touching albeit comedic moments.  It was short lived and did not really get a chance to do much, but what was put out made for a clever, well acted comedy and very much worth a look.

For those who do get the DVDs it is a basic MOD type release.  Just the episodes on 2 discs, with no extras to speak of.  If you were a fan of the show when it was on TV, or are just looking for a good comedy to add to a DVD collection, it is definitely worth picking up.",1479600000,2,1537,4.179661016949153
8698418,5,B00SI7DXJ2,"Loved this show. Can't believe it was cancelled after the first season. One of the best most entertaining hilarious shows I've seen. Adorable lead role, Kate Walsh is amazing.",1454284800,,175,5.068965517241379
8698419,4,B00SI7DXJ2,"This series is seriously underrated. I'm not denying that there were somewhat cringeworthy moments (hence docking off one star here) but it definitely did not deserve the flack it got either. There was quite a bit of wit in the humor there and I especially liked the message of episode 11. The lead is fantastic. She doesn't seem to be held back by some preconception that there is some image to be upheld - unlike some other actresses, not naming names - and that means she's really committed to the comedy. And let's be real, she's easy on the eyes too. The supporting cast is great as well, I do like the comedic timing of the bailiff and oh, that Judy, she's such a gem.",1449014400,,674,4.4
8698420,5,B00SI7DXJ2,If you like to party and like to have fun you will love this show.. Kate Walsh slays!! If you are not a generally fun person and don't enjoy some quality party/ drinking humor you probably won't like this show!!,1436227200,2,211,4.3
8698421,3,B00SI7DXJ2,"This show quit after the first season and I see why after watching it on dvd.  I wouldn't buy this again, even though I love Kate Walsh, because it was not well written.  Parts of the show were good but this wasn't something that had me waiting to watch the next one, I could have stopped any where.  It was worth watching, one time, but this isn't a season I will ever watch when I'm bored even.",1434931200,2,396,4.116883116883117
8698422,1,B00SI7DXJ2,Total waste of time and money. Not worth the money. Poor acting and bad script,1433980800,,78,4.266666666666667
