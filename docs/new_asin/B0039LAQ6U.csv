8392106,3,B0039LAQ6U,"Strange, offbeat little WWII film, most of it's action being in the third act, but blessed with a terrific supporting performance by Mickey Rooney who won a supporting actor nomination for this role.",1413676800,,199,5.0606060606060606
8392107,3,B0039LAQ6U,"A better than average B movie following 3 GI's in Italy during WWII.  Three very different personalities come to light before the war scenes at the end.  Wendall Corey, a nice guy married to a rich wife, who questions himself and his courage to kill a man.  His friend Mickey Rooney, a boisterous fun-loving guy, who like to gamble and chase the women, but later admits that he loves his wife and his dream is to be able to buy a nice restaurant.  And their sergeant Don Taylor who has his value system askew by the upbringing of a strict uncle with a twisted belief system.  The characters are fleshed out before the finale although Taylor's is a little hard to grasp.",1401580800,,669,4.450819672131147

8392109,4,B0039LAQ6U,"Good movie, had not seen it since the 60's. Outstanding war movie. the only change I recommend it putting it in the Region 1 play mode. Region 2 limits you to your PC or you must rewire you DVD player if it is capable using a six wire audio and cable wire set. Most DVD players and Flat screen TV do not possess the six connection points.",1360972800,2,338,4.059701492537314
