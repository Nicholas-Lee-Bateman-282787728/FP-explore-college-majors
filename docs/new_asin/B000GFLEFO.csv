2607273,3,B000GFLEFO,"Noah's Arc is a fun, gay comedy from the Logo Network.  It was recommended to me by friends because of my love for Queer as Folk and Sex and the City, and it has the most hilarious elements of both but with an entirely different spin.  Logo promotes the show as Sex and the City meets Soul Food, and they're on the mark.

The players:
Noah - a struggling screenwriter and incurable romantic
Alex - a sassy HIV educator
Ricky - hot body, promiscuous, avoids monogamy like the plague
Chance - uptight college professor

Noah, the lead character, is played as an ultra-femme gay man with a voice that's slightly reminiscent of Michael Jackson.  He is basically the ""Carrie"" of the group with the fashion sense and money problems to prove it. His best friends form a tight-knit group with Ricky as the sex fiend ""Samantha,"" Chance as the prim and proper ""Charlotte,"" and though Alex isn't really as cynical as ""Miranda"" at least he's a professional.

This show is just a bit over the top with the characters playing their roles as black gay men a little stereotypically at times, but it works.  In just the first five episodes they deal with issues like a boyfriend who needs a bit of ""thug love,"" cybersex coming between a relationship, whether or not a certain guy might be gay--and how to find out for sure.  This DVD set includes 9 episodes and special features like deleted scenes, 2 short films, auditions, extended scenes, and commentary.  I highly recommend watching the episodes with the extended scenes enabled if you haven't seen this show yet.

With equal parts drama and comedy, I can't wait to see what Noah and the boys have in store for next season.",1155081600,24,1661,4.619047619047619
2607274,5,B000GFLEFO,"I just got the DVD last night and I love it. All the behind the scenes and commentary and stuff makes up for the lowly 9 episodes per season. I love this show and hopefully during season two Logo gives the show more of a budget so we can get more extras and hopefully more episodes per season, hopefully we can get at least 15 episodes per season at least or perhaps 22 like a normal season. Again I love this show and I loved the season two premiere that came on tonight(8/9/06) and can't wait til next week. THE SHOW NEEDS TO BECOME AN HOUR LONG!!!!!",1155081600,3,552,4.168224299065421
2607275,5,B000GFLEFO,"I have not watched more than a clip or two from Queer as Folk so I came to Noah through LOGO.  I was stunned.  Being gay in the Black/Hispanic community is a tough row to hoe and these men have always been left out of most gay films and stories.  Now comes four beautiful men (and the incredibly sexy Wade) who have lives, personalities, problems and dreams.  This is a refreshing addition to gay ""literature"" and I cannot imagine the series being less than wonderful in its new season.  Besides being incredibly entertaining it is a profoundly moving series that breaks new ground--not with heavy machinery but with gentle turns of the spade until one realizes that we are all the same, we all have sexual desires and we all have--or should have--networks of friends who become the families that replace the ones we have left behind for anonymity--usually in the big city.  When I watch this series I think of the close friends that I have lost.  Noah's Arc reaffirms the importance of people in our lives, no matter the ethnicity or race, because in the world of homosexuality we are all the same.  Thank God.",1154822400,9,1111,4.604060913705584
2607276,2,B000GFLEFO,"i try to support black film and tv ventures (because i'm black)but sometimes i want to slit my wrists...noah's arc is a brave attempt to bring black men in love and gay black men into the realm of a white world. i'm not sure if it's the writing or the acting or both that make this show a guilty pleasure. queer as folk had its moments of schlock and cheesy perfomances but noah's is very melodramatic and much like an after-school special or worse, some tv-movie on lifetime. i look forward to seeing growth in season two and hopefully, they get rid of the term ""boo-gina""...ick!!!",1154563200,5,582,4.5
2607277,3,B000GFLEFO,Even if you've seen every episode of the season or have the entire season TiVO'd you still want to own the DVD as the bonus features are worth the price alone!  I'm not kidding.  There's a lot of extra footage that will make your mouth water.,1154476800,10,242,4.239130434782608
2607278,5,B000GFLEFO,"Noahs Arc- the complete first season is great New series from Logo network.  This series is a refreshing and new comedy about four African-American Gay men and there relationships with there lovers.  Its a great new comedy!  I fell instantly in love with the series and the characters.

I definitely will buy as many series from this collection as offered!

This series begins with four good friends.  First guy, a HIV prevention expert.  Second a promiscuous club boy who just wants to have fun.  The third, a stiff professor; and the fourth, Noah, who seems to keep all these friends together.

To find out more, watch Queer as folk final season SNEAK-PEEKS!  I did and bought Noahs Arc- The First season as soon as it came out.  This new series is WORTH IT!",1152403200,45,760,4.639097744360902
2607279,5,B000GFLEFO,"After seeing the 2 episode preview for Noah's Arc on the last disk of the Final Season of Queer as Folk, I knew I had to have more! I then went online and ordered it from LOGO. It came yesterday and I am watching episode after episode! I love it sooo much. It is soo refreshing to see poeple like 'us' on tv. There are flamboyent to straigh-acting characters which we all can relate to! I call this Sex and the City meets Queer as Folk. I do wish it was a longer season, maybe season 2 will have more episodes! The episodes all have commentaries on them, all have extended scenes showing you things they couldn't on TV, the PILOT episode and more! Order this DVD! You won't be disappointed! One drawback.... the origianl music/songs that are featured on the show are not the same on DVD. So, if you heard Rihanna's song playing at a club when you watched this on TV, it won't be on the DVD. I guess because of licensing fee's. BUT nonetheless it is a great DVD, funny, and I am glad this show came about!",1151798400,12,1004,4.234375
2607280,4,B000GFLEFO,"After watching and loving every minute of Queer as folk, I was not sure that a ""funny"" show who is suppose to depict gay life would live up to the standards that i have been use too. But from the first time I sat down and watched Noah's arc I was hooked it was a great mix of comedy with real sense of who the characters are. There are times when the acting could be better but that's with everything. I would tell you to run out and buy this season.",1151452800,9,450,3.956043956043956
2607281,5,B000GFLEFO,"just when i thought that i wouldn't recover from the loss of sex in the city ... Here comes Noah and his three crazy friends Chance,Alex , Ricky and his sexy as Hell boyfriend Wade. The show was talked about for so long in the blk. Gay scene I couldn't wait to finally see it. Well needless to say the show is a hit great topics,plenty of laughs,hot guys and us tv nista's have friends again .You need to buy it and get a Copy for all of your gurl friends.time to introduce or friend Carrie to to our new friend Noah.",1151280000,9,517,4.078431372549019
2607282,4,B000GFLEFO,"A friend of mine stopped over one Saturday as he usually does on his ""Haircut Day"" sans the haircut and introduced to some friends of his--Noah, Alex, Ricky, and Chance. With a bit of skepticism I invited the guys into my home. I quickly took heed to the words of Noah and his boatmates...I was converted y'all. Noah's Arc by far is one of the best shows to hit the airwaves this season, depicting and wonderful balance of gay and bisexual men in the African American community. There were no stones unturned in the subject matter. I am in love with the show and can't wait to start TiVo-ing Season 2. In the meantime, I am strongly encouraging you to add this DVD boxset to your collection as I am doing today. It's edgy, funny, and as real as you can get on TV, accurately showing the variations of black gay/bisexual men. One note though; there are points that the acting could've been better but the scripting makes up for that; that's the only reason it didn't get the full five stars.",1151193600,7,990,4.445054945054945

Even coming as a surprise to the creator of the show. It was the highest rated show on the network at the time. It just goes to show that color is still an issue. It was the only time I have ever been able to see a genuine reflection of myself on TV. The acting was a bit campy but the show was amazing and addicting. I am also really disgusted by the pathetic people who are on here trying to sell the first season for $100 and even $200 when it should be around $25.

They are a family, they believe in God, they are good parents and they do have morals. They mirror my close friends, but just a different gender and age group. It is a shame that I had to resort to the internet to find a storyline about gay people who are not all addicted to sleeping around with hundreds of men,spreading AIDS or on the downlow. I saw my friends and myself in each one of those characters, now that's really funny! So I said to myself how different could we really be? God made us and we all want happiness.

I remember the first time I watched it, it was instant love. It makes me laugh so much and the feeling when watching it is just so good and content. It resonates deeply with home due to the genuine African American references and well the characters ARE black. And I am a true ALLY to,the LGBT community. I'm not sure how to describe this show but I know it's very unique in how it makes me feel. I had the pleasure of meeting Patrick after begging my local indie film festival to show his film. I wanted to tell him how much I appreciated his work and how much of a die hard fan I am, (very selective fan too, never felt so much to something so trivial, a tv show!) but I chickened out and settled with simply speaking to him. He's your average guy. Yet brilliant. He's doing what he likes, I think it comes easy to him to produce content, as is with most artist - they produce this stuff while in the loo-- it's just the money and making it ""mainstream"" is the difficult part. I hope he always produces something and never disappears on us. Thank you Patrik, you have devoted crazy fans out there.

2607443,5,B000GFLEFO,"I am a newcomer to the Noah's Arc series. Although I am a completely straight female I honestly admit I absolutely LOVE the show. I was first introduced to the show by my best friend, who is now openingly gay, but couldn't get into it, considering I knew nothing about the show. The ""partial"" eposide I watched was during season 2, because I remember Noah's hair being cut short. The only thing I saw was eye candy, not realizing the ""intent of the show."" I, then, saw the entire viewing of season 1 and 2 on LOGO a few months back and seemingly fell in love with it. Why? I ask myself that same question and although again I say it's the eye candy I know it's more about the realization of the lives and love (good and bad) of 4 black gay men. It also gives me a better understanding of my best friend's lifestyle and why he is the way he is. (I see ALOT of Alex and Noah in him....lawd help me...lol)

I've watched the complete 1st season repeatedly since purchasing it. I find myself watching it more w/ the commentaries because it is OH SO FUNNY. **SPOILER ALERT** Speaking on the commentary... Darryl and Patrick- Ian Polk were so hilarious during the first eposide part I, when Alex comes back into the bedroom ready to resume play, after leaving Trey ""hanging"" to talk to Noah in the bathroom and he has fallen asleep on Alex... P.I.P made a statement about falling asleep when wanting to ""get busy"" and Darryl replies, ""never had that problem"" P.I.P. laughs and subtly calls him a ""female dog"" (I know it was harmless, but it was funny) and part II, when Noah admits his feeling for Wade, P.I.P. mimicks the lines and starts laughing, jokingly stating, ""I write the sappest s**t"" and Darryl's subtle reply ""Don't you though"" and lastly toward the end of the episode after Noah and Wade made love and Noah's sincere reply of ""Don't worry I'll protect you"" when Wade admits to being scared... Darryl: I wanted to burst out laughing during this part. P.I.P: (laughing) Awh... Why? Darryl: How the hell Noah gon protect anybody? He can't even get through a three-some without calling his friends. (LMBO @ Darryl) Jensen was rather quiet during both episode's commentary, as Darryl so blantly revealed him on his Sidekick, but he had his sarcastically cute replies in the begining when P.I.P. asked if he was on a roller blading team. Jensen's reply ""No, but thx, but I do love rollerblading"". The comment about the ""rented"" Hummer, and Jensen's subtle reply ""Very different from my Honda Civic"" ...lol. And his blushing reply to P.I.P. and Darryl adoring comment about his perfect abs when Noah went to pick up Wade for their night out. P.I.P: What was that they put on you to make you look wet? Jensen: Oh yeah.. I think...that was...um... water.  Oh and... the comment about Noah and Wade's love scene. Jensen comments one of the camera crew had his back to them, and in Darryl's optimitic defense ""I think he just wanted to give us our privacy because they did have the entire set cleared."" P.I.P. sarcastic ""OK"" Darryl's explantation ""I mean because we were completely naked in this scene"" Everyone started laughing, but you can hear Jensen's quick ""almost"" comment. Darryl then admits ""We were wearing pants, but you couldn't see them"" ... um... if you did that would kinda defeat the purpose of it being a ""love scene"" Darryl...lol. I can't get through the episodes w/out laughing, thinking about these and other comments...lol.

The still shots of the guys are gorgeous. My favorite(s) (just before the ending credits) is one of Noah in the restroom coversing w/ the ARC, confessing his own admittance of also being scared, as tears filled his eyes. And two(not neccesarily a still shot) but, of course, Wade on the treadmill conversing w/ Noah inquiring about the ""been there, done what?"" statement. I get a kick out of Wade stumbling on the treadmill after Ricky's jokingly request for a threesome, and his facial expression after he composed himself. (nice work Jensen, very believable...lol) TOO CUTE!!

I now notice many of the facial expression of each character in all episodes, but I do have my favorite. The end of the club scene (episode I part II) after the ARC advised Noah to resist temptation and Wade asks Noah to dinner, Noah's quickily replies ""ok"" The ARC's reaction is hilarious, Alex's especially. When Noah walks up to the steps of his apartment after the drag show (episode III) and Wade subtle but surprising reaction to seeing him in complete drag. (Ricky was absolutely adorable in drag, by the way) And lastly, when Ricky faints (eposide VI) after his admittance to have fallen for Junito, Chance's facial expression was priceless...lol.

I don't exactly have a favorite character, ok, I'm lying, but I can relate alot to Alex's personality, Noah's fashion sense (not saying mine is as creative as his) and Chance's professionalism (seeing as though I am a teacher as well) The oh so fyne ""adorbly dimpled"" Jensen Atwood (Wade) is on my ""men to look out for"" list...something about him and his humble smile just... edited for content... gets to me. I have now youtubed (is that even a word) all the video's he's appeared in...(my favorite(s) are Ife's ""aim to please"" (I wish he'd worn his hair this way in JTB) and Destiny's Child ""cater to you"" ...plz check them out) and I've disconvered video's Christian has danced in and I must say HE AND HIS DANCING IS HOT!!

Don't get me wrong, just because I point out some doesn't mean I don't like all the characters.. those to me just stand out.

I am, however, somewhat disappointed in some of Noah's judgements, because throughout Season One, when approached with problems within the ARC's relationship(s), Noah was a firm believer in ""communication is key"" ...just talk to him... however when approached with the proposal of moving in with Wade, instead of taking his own adivce, he, assumingly, portrayed the ultimate betrayal. SN: Crazy how the ARC felt Wade would hurt Noah because he was once apparently straight, yet instead Wade was the one hurt w/ Noah's careless judgement at the club. Interesting!!

Purchased season two (plz see review) as well as the movie ""Jumping The Broom"" (plz see review) and I must say it was a treat to watch.

In discovering the cancellation of the show through Google, I came across a blog site of written episodes of season three, episodes 1-8 and (to be posted by the end of April.. to my understanding) season four, episode 1 (view comment below for website) Definitely a site to check out.

While all of the above is true the point is we love and can relate to these charcters on many levels and isn't that the point in the first place. Each week for two far to short seasons we fell in love with Noah, Wade, Chance, Ricky, et al. Watch these two seasons of DVD's and laugh, cry, root for, and fall in love with these characters all over again. If you watch the episodes with the audio commenatry you should be warned that the actors, most of whom aren't in the episode they are commenting on really is just banter and sometimes provides really good insight into the scenes but not usually.

After a rather non-convincing first episode, (I don't feel that the actors had really settled into their roles during that episode; however, that all changed--the actors became most convincing in the roles that they were playing) I fell completely in love with the characters, the actors and with the show

Noah's Arc is so very appealing and sexy being about four very attractive gay African-Americans living in Los Angeles.  It has a story line that is most of all about the very intense friendship of the main characters.  Of course, intermingled with their friendship is love, the pursuit of love and lust, relationships, careers and religion.  All told in a very amusing way!

All of the actors in this series are great.  I especially adored Darryl Stephens as (the catalyst of the friends) Noah.  He is so very delightful.  He truly comes across as someone one would be most privileged to call friend.

2607467,4,B000GFLEFO,"A television series about a previously ignored group of people certainly deserves attention, and I applaud the creators of Noah's Arc for daring to present the first series about the lives of African-American Gay men.  Even better, after watching both seasons on DVD, I found that Noah's Arc mostly lived up to its well-deserved accolades.  The characters are quirky, the plot lines fast and furious, the laughs frequent and genuine and the drama quite effective.

I admit I was initially disappointed by the quality of the acting, until I realized that it took a few episodes for the cast to fully hit their stride, and I believe that the series perfectly fit its tag line, ""A comedy about drama"".  After I relaxed into it, I came to care about the characters and their situations quite a bit.  By the time I finished the DVD of Season One, I was so addicted to Noah and his friends that I had to purchase Season Two, even though it seemed the creators sometimes tried to squeeze just a little too much plot into a 22-minute format.  But considering the constraints they had to work with, in the end I marveled at how skillfully the writers weaved in a myriad of subjects and plotlines, subtly handling many important issues without ever being heavy handed.

The lead character Noah is a case in point.  I quickly caught on that his character is deliberately rather feminine, and I realized that the writers wanted viewers to get comfortable with the idea that this slight, delicate and very femme gay man managed in eight short episodes to attract the romantic attention of a half-dozen masculine, sexy co-stars and guest stars.  The story of Noah's romance with his on-again off-again boyfriend Wade (played by the adorably dimpled hunk, Jensen Atwood) is the primary focus of the plot, although each episode also found time to explore the daily lives, loves and dramas of his three best friends, Alex, Ricky and Chance (for those who don't get it, Alex Ricky Chance = Noah's ARC, according to a comment by the series creator).

But at first I wasn't sure if Noah's wardrobe and femme manner were meant to be the biggest ""in-joke"" of the series.  In an early episode, while his character is crying poverty and falls behind on his rent, he is dressed (as always) in an ever-changing ensemble of ultra-chic couture, much of which makes him look even more effeminate.  Eventually, the effeminacy issue was tackled head-on quite satisfactorily, and one character's speech about ""effemina-phobia"" and his subtle but powerful comments on the anti-eroticism / ostracism of femme men in the gay male subculture was extremely thought provoking.  This is the show's biggest strength; it manages to delve very subtly into issues that many members of the gay male community (and indeed, many gay films and novels) completely ignore, without spoiling the humor or getting too preachy.  Before long, I realized that the creators were definitely making a statement with the fact that some of Noah's outfits bordered on cross-dressing, even while I could never be sure if his clothes were meant to be taken seriously or not.  Noah's boyfriends were all extreme hunks (one thing this show does not lack for is eye candy) but all the while the disparity between Noah's feminine nature and the masculinity of his various suitors made me feel uncomfortable and definitely conscious of the looks-ism and anti-femme bigotry that permeate the gay male world today.  Bravo!

In fact, the most satisfying aspect of the series was that it tackled a surprising number of real-life issues with humor and charm, and I was amazed that through the relatively short run of this show, Noah's Arc discussed a variety of important topics, like HIV testing and awareness, the ""down-low"" subculture, sero-discordant couples, gay dating, gay marriage, sexual compulsion, monogamy, gay bashing, and the previously mentioned delicate issue of ""effemina-phobia"" (and whichever writer on this show coined that word deserves a medal), all with a refreshing mix of light-hearted laugh-out-loud humor and (at times) dead serious drama.  As often as I found myself laughing hysterically, I also found myself extremely touched by the dramatic situations and challenged by the serious, provocative subject matter.

There was one major disappointment - although I was aware even before I acquired the Season Two DVD set that the show had not been renewed for a third season, I was not prepared for the abrupt, unresolved cliffhanger ending of the final episode, which left the fate of one of the main characters completely up in the air.  This was quite annoying, since there was no opportunity to resolve this plot point.  For this reason alone, I must subtract one star from what would otherwise be a five star review.

Despite this shortcoming, Noah's Arc gets five stars for effort, ten stars for its genuinely funny moments, and a big thank you for discussing so many important topics without being preachy or trite.  May it be a harbinger of things to come.",1181865600,9,5017,4.946428571428571

Not just towards ""Noah's Arc"" director, Patrik-Ian Polk but also to the actors and technical crew who obviously worked very hard to put this series together and, more importantly, towards black gay programming and filmmaking in general. I can only speak for myself and as a black gay man but I know I remain hungry for representation on the big and small screen, hungry to the point where it doesn't always matter whether said representation is realistic and positive, or not. This series may only be available on a subscription only cable channel in the US and may not be available to watch on any channel in this country for a long time to come (if ever) but it's a start. No matter what I might feel about certain aspects of this series, as a whole it's definitely groundbreaking stuff. Polk is a pioneer.

I winced quite a lot through the first episode or so but after that, I began to feel that the actors were really getting into a rhythm, gelling as a unit and that the storylines, though a bit short on depth, really began to show heart and humour, while at the same time managing to tackle some very important issues that as black gay men, we can often find very difficult to talk about. I particularly liked the way the HIV issue was dealt with and I have to say I don't think I've ever seen it done in a more accurate or helpful way. Not even on shows like ""ER"" or ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"", which, for obvious reasons, have raised the issue more than a few times in the past.

All in all, I liked it and, mainly thanks to the way some of the storylines have been cleverly left unresolved, I genuinely look forward to the next season being released on DVD. And while I feel that characters like Perry in ""Brother To Brother"" or even Omar and his cohorts in ""The Wire"" (if you discount the criminality) are a lot closer to my reality and experience as a black gay man than any of the characters in this show, I do know we're not all the same. I do recognise that many black gay men will identify with the character in ""Noah's Arc"". Thus, I think every black gay man should have a copy, even if just for laughs.

But even if you're not black or gay but would like to get a handle on one man's perspective, (albeit, I suspect, largely drawn from fantasy), on what it means to be young, black and gay in that soup-plate of superficiality otherwise known as Los Angeles in the 21st century, you should definitely check this one out.

Noah is a screenwriter who has fallen in love with Wade, who is also a screenwriter, but happens to be straight (so he claims). Alex works at an HIV clinic and is in a seven year relationship with his partner, Trey (who works in a hospital). Ricky is the owner of a Melrose Avenue clothing store, who is also the promiscuous one of the group. Chance is a college professor who has moved in with his partner, Eddie and his daughter Kenya. All four characters have an equal part to this wonderful story about love, comedy and drama. Patrik Ian Polk is the brain child behind this show, which is a spin off from his cult classic ""Punks.""

I think the plots are very dynamic and the cast is as well. Being that the series compares to much of reality, there can be predictions based on a viewers personal experiences, and in the same breath, there can be suspense. I am very proud to see all of the support not only from the cast, but more so from the viewers. Considering the ratings and popularity of the series, I would have to say that America may be changing just a little. Less than 30 years ago an interracial couple on television was considered taboo... Now we have Noah's Ark.",1162512000,,971,4.7514792899408285
2607521,4,B000GFLEFO,"I am a fan of Noah's Arc. It is an African American Queer as Folk.  Its ground breaking and a delight. I like the synergy of the actors. However, my only problem with it, is the limited amount of time devoted to an episode. If Patrik Ian Polk wants this to really progress he needs to take it to 1 hour and add more depth to the characters. Its good but it can be better. You will definitely have a good laugh :)",1162512000,,412,3.963855421686747
2607522,5,B000GFLEFO,"Excellent on DVD as it was on Logo.. actually better because you get to see more. The commentaries are nice because you get to know how the scene was set up, and what the actor was thinking. If you haven't brought this DVD then what are you waiting on? I got a good deal here on Amazon, the price was right and well worth it. Can't wait for the 2nd season to be out on DVD.",1162512000,,373,3.9210526315789473
2607523,4,B000GFLEFO,"It would be nice if black gay characters were neatly mixed in with the likes of a Queer As Folk and shows of the like. Since they aren't, Noah's Arc serves as a nice alternative. I was prepared to hate it, but it's nice to see actors who despite varying levels of acting ability, make a truly valiant and earnest effort to bring a voice and three dimension to the lives of gay black men. I rented it and watched the whole thing and fell in love with it's premise of friendship and personality dynamic. I subsequently bought the series and am looking forward to the next season to be released since LOGO is unavailable where I live. My hope is that Noah's Arc will continue to be a hit and reach audiences outside of the ""expected"" demographic.",1162339200,,743,4.391304347826087
2607524,3,B000GFLEFO,"I purchased this set the other day and I pretty much got through it in a day (since the season is so short) and I have mixed feelings about whether I like it or not (hence the 3 stars).

On one hand, it's fun, campy and has lots of sexy men flaunting themselves.  There are times that it's funny and it does help bring out the fact that there are gay black men out there who are just as fabulous as everyone else.

On the other hand, there can be a lot of criticism about the show.  The acting is kinda average and tedious at times.  It's a bit wooden and the script has needs a bit of work to make it feel more 'real'.  The characters were predictable and it's hard to compare it to Queer as Folk or Sex and the City because it really tries to be those two moulded together but doesn't quite get there.

Nonetheless, I did enjoy many moments and hope they improve on what's lacking in the next season.",1161216000,,902,4.090909090909091
2607525,5,B000GFLEFO,"I watched season 1 over the summer.  My brother brought over the DVD set and I couldn't tear my eyes away.  The charachters on this show have great chemistry and the plot always keeps you guessing on what is going to happen next.  I love how the story unravels between Noah and Wade.  The charachter development amongst Noah, Alex, Chance and Ricky is well written and brillantly acted out in each episode.  Noah's Arc has a fan for life.",1158019200,3,438,4.493670886075949
2607526,5,B000GFLEFO,"I wasn't able to watch the show on the LOGO channel and eagerly anticipated the arrival of my DVD when I ordered it last week.

I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I've watched the entire season twice in one week - yes - I guess you can say I was pressed.  Love the characters and the fact that they were all handsome really made me proud to watch it.  It was like watching a movie because I was going to view an episode here and there as time permitted but I found myself watching the entire season in one sitting.

I'm looking forward to the 2nd season and purchasing that as well.  It will go right next to seasons 1 & 2 of the L Word.  Loved Queer as folk but Noah has stolen my heart.",1156809600,6,679,4.022388059701493
2607527,2,B000GFLEFO,"I understand the need for there to be more visible queer black characters in the forefront of queer media.  Even Queer as Folk which broke so much ground in terms of the gay soap opera was still mighty white.  So, while I applaud LOGO for their presentation of Noah's Arc, I have to ask, even though there is a need, does this show answer the need?

I found the show to be interesting, but the plot holes and lack of structure (ironic considering the titual character is a writer) to be annoying, too annoying to appreciate the more charming moments (but only moments) the show had.

Among the annoynaces were:

*Who IS Trey?  Hot guy, but completely under utilized in his role.  For all it matters, Alex could be single.  And why does he have to be a nurse?  He could be a pilot or a waiter or the CEO of Sony or a parrot for all that he does each episode.  Same thing with Brandy - what a GREAT character to add to the mix.  Someone sassy and all LA Business, but she's just a vehicle for Noah to have a ""secret"" from Wade.

* Why are plot points brought up and then never used again?  For example, the guy robbing Ricky's store while he's getting busy in back would make a great plot for Ricky to deal with - calling the police, having to explain where he was, having him come to some realization and grow as a character.  Nope - it was dropped.  Or Fernando, the HIV+ hustler whose only role was to serve as a vehicle for Alex quitting his job to open a new clinic.  What happened to Fernando - he's a character, a character that Alex could have used to grow as a chracter himself, not a plot device.

*The pacing seems all off in the show.  For example, when Chance moves in with Eddie we get no information about how they met, what they mean to each other, how they came to the decision to move in together - yet within 5 minutes, Chance is trying to back out of the living together situation.  Why?  If we assume it's ""for the regular reasons"" well then this main character is just a shmuck - and a two-dimentional one at that; if there's a more compelling reasn, I'd like to see it acted out.  Also, what was up with Chance and his landlord?  They act like they are very close but we don't know why or if we should even care.

*Why does it take less than an episode to solve problems?  No problem seems ..  well, problematic.  Nor do they really seem all that important.  Dive an SUV into a house?  No problem - it's built like a tank (not a scratch on it) and the resident doesn't want to press charges.  Closested boyfriend brings you to meet his straight friends for the first time?  No problem - order an apple martini and cut to the next scene.  Let the audience figure out what might have happened.  Closeted boyfriend jealous of your  best friend's playfulness?  No problem - ignore what he's feeling and make sure that in the next scene he puts his arms around you first.

I blame two things - weak writing and the show's 30 minute running time.  If the show were an hour long, there would be much more time to develop not only the characters but conflicts and the resolutions as well.  If the writers were stronger they'd be able to navigate the characters' way through real, interesting daily life conflicts and resolutions without such abruptness.

The idea behind Noah's Arc answers the need for diversity in queer entertainment and may be ""better than nothing"", but I think the community deserves ""something more"".  The rub between the need for this show and its sloppy execution of this show makes me hope that others will cry out for better quality in future seasons.",1156550400,24,3590,4.357466063348416
2607528,5,B000GFLEFO,"This is the best thing I've seen since the original British Queer As Folk in 1999.  Smart, funny, superbly acted, charming.  The only downside is that the DVD version does not have the same songs as when broadcast on LOGO.  Diana Ross' terrific song in episode 9, for example, has been replaced with the Noah's Arc theme song.  What a shame.  I assume it cost too much to get the rights to the original songs for DVD, and that's why this excellent series took so long to come out on DVD - to replace all the music.  I was wondering what was taking so long.  Still, don't let this quibble stop you from enjoying the series.  It's really terrific.",1155859200,4,645,4.361344537815126
2607529,5,B000GFLEFO,I own this and watch it all the time it has the class and softer feel and not so in your face as was Queer as folk I do infact appreciate it way more the charactors really shine its a gay version of sex and the city meets real in depth charactors however i wish logo the producers of the show would come out with a soundtrack to the hit show and put the song by me'shell ndegeocello codependency on it because i cant get the song anywhere and i love that song. Noah's arc is a must have it truely is so buy it and be prepared for it to consume you.,1155686400,4,548,3.8584070796460175

I wanted to see how Wade, Noah and the crew were doing since the series had ended. I stumbled upon this show on LOGO and loved it straight away. However, the quality of this video is horrible deleted scenes, sometimes characters heads of were chopped.. The video seems to be in a theatrical version and not a good one either. Again the show was a good look into the lives of gay black men living in LA the great friendships, how they move day to day professionally and privately.
