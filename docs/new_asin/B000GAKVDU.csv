8129973,5,B000GAKVDU,"This interview was for me another opportunity to understand something about a public figure I have heard much about. Ted Turner is open, arrogant, egotistical, interesting, funny at times, opinionated, idealistic, and a bit off - handish. He is also a person of tremendous ambition and accomplishment, the founder of CNN, a major figure in the modern media world, also a major philanthropist. Turner talks about a lot of things. He is an environmentalist, who rails against global- warming, over- population, fossil fuel energy use, the war in Iraq, nuclear weapons. He speaks about having eaten humble- pie since the merger of his company and Time-Warner but he does not sound at all humble. He talks a lot about being honest and moral and decent, and says that he has tried to be throughout his business career. He speaks about his marriages and refers to the anxiety which came with the breakdown of his recent marriage to the actress Jane Fonda. He also speaks about his accomplishments in sailing , and sports ownership. Charlie Rose talks to him like they are both good ole Southern boys and they get along fine. Rose asks the hard questions but in a polite and considerate way.",1198454400,,1184,4.83743842364532

VERY ANNOYING DVD format (DVR).  Wouldn't play on any of my DVD players.  Had to watch it on my computer.  If not for this, would have given 5 stars.",1181433600,2,271,4.659574468085107
