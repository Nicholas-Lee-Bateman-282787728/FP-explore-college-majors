5153083,5,B008D1RCV8,"I love watching DBZ, but I hate that it takes 5 epeisodes for them to fight each other! Not so with this DVD..No BS here! My only complaint is Gohan's voice is done by someone else and it's not as good...blah",1362528000,,208,4.097560975609756
5153084,5,B008D1RCV8,"From the get-go, this is the best version of DBZ, minus a few cast changes for main cast members (Gohan, Bulma, etc) From just hearing the theme song, you can tell it's great. This show is brilliantly filler-free, minus Gregory in the 1st season, but he doesn't affect the story much. I can't wait for season 4 & the Buu Saga, since their gonna come out some time in the next several months, or so. The newest animation threw me off at 1st, but it's easy to see the difference of over 20 years ago & today's Japanese animation.
It's also brilliantly re-written w/ new scripts that are VERY close to the Japanese scripts. I've been watching the episodes in English w/ the English subtitles for the Japanese dub & besides some more words & switching the words around, the English dub is the best for these anime shows. I only wish there was a different subtitle track for the English dub, but it's better than nothing. Basically, it's like a thesauraus, some of the lines are different in wording, but essentially the same for translating purposes. Like, Trunks says ""Cell's beaten,"" or something like that, when Vegeta starts fighting Cell, but the translated Japanese-English subtitles say ""Dad'll beat him."" The only thing I wish is that Gohan's original Funimation voice actor came back & Bulma's too, but not to the same extent, but that's a review of the dub, not for the packaging.
For the packaging, there's a slip cover w/ a DVD case that has 4 disks w/ 2 2-disc holders in it. The only features that are on it, are textless openings & endings from the beginning & endings of the episodes. I wish there was cast interviews, or those types of featurettes on the season sets. That would be a good thing to have. Also, a few differences from the orange brick sets, is the english dub, the subtitles, the episode titles in order on the inside of the front cover,4 discs per season, around 25 episodes per season, the theme song singer changing every 2 discs, but I wish they restricted the singers to Sean Schemmel, Vic Mignogna's, or maybe Greg Ayres' versions, the others aren't really the best of them all. There's also no booklets in the season sets, w/ character bios, episode descriptions, & such as was in the brick sets. Also, It plays in regions 1 & 4, not 2, like the brick sets and is in 4:3, which isn't a big disappointment, considering the show was made over 20 years ago, before HD TV's.
Overall, the show is back, revamped, & better than ever. I give it a 5/5 stars. A must-have for all DBZ fans wanting a more diffinitive, jam packed, filler free dub & show of DBZ w/ all the works.",1360886400,2,2602,4.514830508474576
5153085,5,B008D1RCV8,"Kai has been a wonderful series. By cutting out the filler that was not part of the manga, Studio Toei has done a wonderful job bringing the series to Akira Toriyama's original vision. Gone is the ridiculous filler that created plot-holes and dragged the series on and on without a sign of resolution in sight. Granted, I am a fan of long stories and unabridged novels, but all the extra story to the original series was was just filler to pad out episodes. Now we have Kai, a series closer to the manga as it should have been from the start. Now the stories flow better and feel less bulky.

Season three is incredible. While the first sagas were pretty good, such as the Saiyan and Freeza Saga, this is where it picks up it's stride with the Trunks, Androids, and Cell Saga. The storytelling, though not deep, is compelling, dealing with time traveling, androids, Cell, and a vengeance from the past in the form of a mad scientist angry at Goku for something that happened in the original Dragon Ball series. The chemistry between Goku and Gohan is touching, just as the chemistry between Trunks and Vegeta is intriguing. The fight scenes are top notch. Though, Dragon Ball Z isn't the deepest series, this set of episodes does have some mild philosophy thrown in about ethics during fighting. It also deals with the dangers of pride and pushing oneself too far. This is top-notch Dragon Ball Z.

A word of warning to those with children. There are many people who say Kai is bloodless and less violent than the original series. While it's true that there are stricter broadcasting laws in Japan now making DBZ Kai slightly less violent than the original TV series, it's still a violent show. Don't think otherwise. Kai is less violent and bloody than original DBZ, but only slightly. There are still plenty of instances of hits to the face, kicks to the gut, people coughing up blood and getting impaled and loosing limbs. The first couple of episodes on the disc prove my point. Along with that we have some mild swearing. I would rate this a PG-13.",1350172800,8,2053,4.6219178082191785

Overall, this was an awesome remastering of a classic. They took what was bad and tried to make it better. I, personally, think they cut too much out. I actually really liked the journey along snake way. However, its nice to have things happen on a faster pace. They don't spend entire episodes just screaming and powering up
anymore.",1523318400,,434,4.786666666666667

8526932,4,B008D1RCV8,"It's a great cut of the original show, redubbed and remastered (not in a bad way). My only complaints are that the redrawn cuts usually look quite bad but it's understandable, considering how old the show is. My second complaint is that this season (at least for the first few episodes as far as I can tell) stops using the original Kikuchi score, and instead swap back to Yamamoto, who is notorious for the long list plagiarized tracks on this DBZ Kai score. It really is strange that the digital version has this, as Kikuchi's score is much more fitting to the show. I'd recommend purchasing a new physical copy of this season, because this is most likely an older release of the show, before Yamamoto was discovered to be plagiarizing.",1515542400,,738,4.641221374045801
