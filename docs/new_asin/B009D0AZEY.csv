For up and coming players, I would suggest that you use this DVD as a guide in addition to finding a mentor like Mr. Martin
to help you on your way towards stupid-free pool. Well, at least an honest approach to getting less stupid. Thank You Mr. martin.",1493337600,,377,4.178082191780822
8539823,5,B009D0AZEY,"As one of Ray's former students I purchased this as a refresher coarse. The extended time spent with my ""Mentor"" completely changed everything I ""thought"" I knew. His ability to bring out the best in a player is second to none. Forget the other Glitz & Glamour, if your looking for a no nonsense proven system that is backed up by his induction into the Hall of Fames this will fit the bill! It should be accompanied with his book ""The 99 Critical Shots"" an amazing book!!",1414195200,,472,4.436781609195402
