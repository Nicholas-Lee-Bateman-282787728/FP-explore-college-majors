8336298,2,B001QTVPBW,Never have I seen so many gay short stories performed w/o any hint of sex and hardly any kissing.  Pure fantasy.,1359590400,,112,4.333333333333333

8336300,1,B001QTVPBW,"Everything is said in my heading.  This was one of the WORST downloads I have had from Amazon.  The quality was grainey, the sound was out of sync and garbuled.  Wasn't worth 5 cents,  yet I was stupid enough to have spent 3 bucks on it..",1355961600,2,238,4.108695652173913

8336303,1,B001QTVPBW,"I enjoy shorts, I've enjoyed most of the Boys Life and Boys Breifs series.  These, however, weren't very good.

Fruitcake, Tempting Fate, and Woof were especially bad, but not even laughably so.  Investigation was an interesting concept.  But over all, theses 4 were horribly written and acted.

The others were ok, some even good.

Overall, I'd skip it.",1287273600,4,354,5.017241379310345
