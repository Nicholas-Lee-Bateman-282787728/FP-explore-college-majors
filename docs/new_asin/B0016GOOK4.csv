8262444,5,B0016GOOK4,The trouble with a lot of movies made since the 90's is that they tell story of the parvenus and the NRI's. I have hard time relating to most such movies. Shool is a great movie of an honest police officer in the crime-ridden state of Bihar. Salute to such people who are fighting against great odds. To be sure the movie has its bollywood flaws - too histrionic at times etc. Manoj Bajpai is one the finest actors in India. The song 'Mere Papa ka Gussa' is very cute - reminds of my sweet little niece.,1272758400,,503,4.195876288659794
