8192538,3,B000PMGS7W,"Haunted Boat starts off really lame.  Teens party.  That's all they do.  They all go on a boat ride.  A man and woman contemplate what would've happened if they had developed a relationship.  After this the group plays spin the bottle as a means to remove clothing and go at it afterwards.

They think about the worst ways to die and their biggest fears.  One teen says his biggest fear is someone you know coming up and murdering you by surprise.  Another thinks drowning is really awful and it's ironic because he joined the swim team.  One girl gets deep.  She mentions constantly modifying the past and present, and that you don't exist except in your own reality.  Dying alone and having insects suck your blood are more of these teens fears.

They all go for a swim.  One of the party guys is pushed into the water which makes the one girl freak out that he drowned, only for him to come to the surface a moment later.  Then he slips under the water again and a shark gets him.  One of the guys says ""Maybe he's hiding somewhere"", LOL!  You can't hide under the water for a long time unless you're a fish!  The group accuses the one girl of picking on the guy too hard perhaps implying he drowned on purpose, but she says he was a pothead anyway.  She continues to show no remorse for her actions later when the battery drains and the boat leaves them stranded.  She insists they're all screwed.

Story time!  The best part of the movie in fact.  One girl mentions a story about visiting a friend, and meeting a tall spooky man wearing a big hat in the elevator of the building.  She was scared and excited at the same time.  She contemplates he might've been Amish, haha.  Yeah, not in the city!  The lights begin to flicker and she hits the elevator buttons in a panic.  Just then the lights turn back on and the elevator starts.  She runs out of the elevator, turns around to look at the man but he's gone.

Another girl accuses her of being afraid of the dead easily, and that she should be afraid of molesters and psychos.  Another girl mentions a story about a guy flirting with her at a mall.  She leaves, turns around and the same guy is now walking behind her while she heads down the sidewalk.  She gets scared and speeds up her walking.  Suddenly she hears a thump behind her- the guy gets run over by a car.  Later that day she goes for a run and thinks about how life can end in a split second and how fragile we all are.  Suddenly she hears the man who was following her down the sidewalk.  He whisper in her ear and introduce himself, which frightens her pretty bad.  They think maybe he didn't die and was just hurt.

Just then the story ends, and the girl thinks a man is looking at her through the boat window.  The captain hears a sound behind him thinking it's one of his friends playing a joke, but it can't be since they're all inside.  When he turns around the ghost disappears.  The group looks around the boat but can't find anyone.  Another girl shares a story about two twin little girls picking berries and soon getting lost in the woods.  They walk until they see a light in a cave.  The two twin girls hear digging and jump down.  They walk further into the cave and see a gnome playing with treasure.  He blocks the entrance with a falling pile of dirt and asks the girls how they can be trusted not to tell about his existence.  He blinds them with magic spells.  Now the girls walk through the woods with a bloody blindfold wrapped around their eyes.  They see their father but he thinks it's a wild animal grabbing at his legs, so he stabs both his daughters by mistake.

One girl is convinced they aren't making it off the boat considering two people prior to today have died on it.  One of the girls then has a seizure.  The mean girl refuses to be on the same boat as an epileptic.  Come morning we see a scary face up close in the fog behind the one guy.  Two of the guys jump into a small boat and sail away to safety, leaving the girls alone on the bigger boat.  They never say why they're leaving so we have to guess they're going to get help.  The girls eat oranges and sleep on the boat until they hear something on the water.  It's a young creepy-eyed man who's lost and needs help.  The man says all his life he's been surrounded by doctors, so he can help the one girl who's sick.  He acts weird but they let him on board anyway.  The one girl hides a flare gun for protection.

The weird young guy checks on the sick girl in bed and says she needs sugar for her blood.  Just then she throws up a human parasite.  The man checks her ear and says there's something in there.  He uses tweezers to pull out a bug.  The girl with the flare gun hears the girl scream after having the bug pulled from her ear, thinks she's being tortured and demands that he leave.  Her and another girl get into a fight.  The doorknob suddenly wiggles.  It's the two guys from the boat.  They're back.

The one girl explains what happened while they were away, but the two guys aren't speaking.  They just sit down and don't say a word.  While the girl's are asleep we see the two men disappear .  The one girl, the mean one, gets zapped when she grabs an electrical charge.  The other girl hears something is wrong with the mean girl but the doorknob falls off when she turns it.

Meanwhile the other girl wakes up and starts meowing really loud while the other girl pets the cat.  Handprints suddenly walk along the window which makes her cover her ears and go crazy.  She reads from the Bible in the hope the chaos and noise go away.  The two guys that disappeared are back on the boat, and one of them is going crazy.

The two guys think they see a boat in the distance so they scream for help, but as they get closer they actually find out it's just their main boat with the girls on board.  When they hop aboard none of the girls are here.  They look for them but nobody's around.  The one man takes a nap and wakes up to watch a video on TV.  On the video he sees his friends jump on the boat from the beginning of the movie, then sees a man enter a doorway.  He turns around and a man walks up from behind imitating the scene from the movie.  He screams.

Now the one girl sees her friends lying on the couch dead.  The girl who was petting the cat earlier and who is apparently the main character of the movie.  She runs to the boat deck screaming ""I don't want to be alone!""  She hangs herself off the side of the boat, but luckily a man comes by and saves her since she's close to shore.  She cries hysterically about the ordeal of losing her friends, even though absolutely none of these friends even remotely got along with each other so she really shouldn't care this much.

Later she returns to the boat and remembers the good times but again, there were no good times because all these teens did was fight and annoy each other due to their bad attitudes and humiliating ways.  But wait.  suddenly her friends drive by on a boat up ahead!  She jumps in the water and swims up to the boat hugging her friends after she jumps aboard.  Then the boat disappears as it heads off into the water and the positive music turns creepy as the movie ends.

I have no idea what happened at the end.  Maybe these teens were ghosts all along, or maybe all the teens except the hysterical girl were ghosts all along.  Maybe it was all a dream.  I think the low budget way this movie was made is a benefit since the atmosphere is unintentionally strong which helps to cover the extremely poor acting and storyline.  Then again the story can't be that bad since I'm someone who likes being confused when it comes to horror films.  At least, as long as a story's not *too* confusing and I wouldn't say Haunted Boat is very confusing.  No I didn't understand the ending or the 30 minutes leading up to it, but it's creepy and atmospheric enough to be entertaining.  I think the three stories the girls share are the highlight of the first half, and the creepy confusing storyline is the highlight of the second half.  A shame these teens are all unlikable and bratty though.  I think I recommend this!  The credits theme is really pretty too!",1499472000,,8167,4.265839320705421

8192541,1,B000PMGS7W,"Wow, was this a lousy movie. I LOVE B-Movies, and will happily pad my film collection with things like ""Plasterhead"" and ""Jack O'Lantern"". While those films may not be great, they at least delivery what they promise, some low budget thrills and chills. ""Haunted Boat"" offers little more than some head-scratchingly stupid 20 year olds floating around a small fishing boat for a couple of days and trying to act frightened. The basic storyline of ""Haunted Boat"" is that one of the kids was given his deceased uncle's boat as a gift, and takes a few of his friends out for a weekend of sun and swimming. Things begin going bad when one of the kids drown and then....well, I'm not really sure. Is there any haunting going on? I doubt it, new characters are introduced, some random stories are told, and one of the guys advises his friends not to poop in the bathroom (not sure where he expected them to go..maybe over the railing?), the director discovers the sepia/black & white button on his camcorder and tries some artsy shots, and this all leads to a seriously confusing ending.
Save you money, and your time and re-watch ""Ghost Ship"" for your nautical horror. ""Ghost Ship"" ain't great, but at least lives up to it's title.",1233532800,4,1225,4.649769585253456
8192542,1,B000PMGS7W,"This movie is obviously low-budget, but does have some creepy parts.  Unforunately, the plot takes the viewer off on so many tangents, the end leaves you scratching your head for the sense of it all?",1213315200,,199,4.685714285714286
8192543,1,B000PMGS7W,"I love cheesy horror movies. I've seen hundreds of them. Many are good, many are passable. Most at least have one redeeming feature.  Not this one. This is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever had the misfortune to suffer through. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the ending made no sense. Unfortunately, most of the movie made no sense as well. Characters would appear and disappear for no reason; people told pointless ghost stories to pad the run time of the movie; somebody puked up weird insect things... I have been slowly trying to plow through my collection of 3,000 movies, and most of the time when they are this bad I've been turning them off. I just kept expecting more from this. The Lionsgate name usually means that at least some quality. Not this time. Stay away at all costs!!

8192544,1,B000PMGS7W,"""Haunted Boat"" started out as your average low budget teen horror movie, about a group of teens get stuck in a boat. But pretty soon it departs from the formula. Unfortunately, it's not in a good way. For a long part of the movie, they sit around telling stories that don't add anything to the plot. Some new characters are thrown in and strange things happen with no apparent logic and the end makes no sense. Perhaps if I'd watch it again things would fall into place, but ""Haunted Boat"" isn't good enough to watch more than once. And it's hardly worth watching even once. There are many much better movies out there. Not recommended.",1191974400,8,636,4.539130434782609
8192545,2,B000PMGS7W,"""Haunted boat"" is a joke. When you read the plot it seems like it has potenial, but you see nothing in the movie. They add so much random crap, the ending makes no sense. The bad part is, you keep watching the movie expecting it to get better, or to even see anything that was remotely described in the ""reviews"". If you're seeing this movie for the horror, you'll be dissapointed. If you're seeing this movie for the plot, you'll be dissapointed. If you're seeing this movie for any other reason than to waste an hour and a half it's not worth it.",1188172800,11,548,4.330097087378641

8192547,5,B000PMGS7W,"I really got inspired by this video. Just thinking about buying a used boat scared me. But I learned so much from the video that I made the plunge and bought my own used boat and am nearly finished with repairs. She will  be ready for the open of boating season this spring.
Pete and Deb do a  really wonderful job of explaining how to determine what kind of boat is  best for me and how to determine what repairs need to be done  professionally and what repairs to take on myself.
This is a terrific  video...
My new-to-me boat is named Vidcom...look for us in the San  Juans.",947289600,,577,4.247706422018348
