688741,4,6303617719,"Many so called Romantic Comedies, seriously lack the comedy side of the genre title.  Meg Ryan who was a staple in romantic couple movies over a couple of years where she teamed up with Billy Crystal, Hugh Jackman, Tom Hanks to name but a few, French Kiss time round, was opposite Kevin Kline.  She plays an American woman looking forward to getting married to a Canadian who has saved all her working life to have $40 000 to use as a deposit (this was made in the days when you needed one and banks didn't just lend money to anyone which sent both the lenders and ultimately banks into bankruptcy), as well as put in an application for Canadian citizenship.  Her fiance wants her to join him on a work trip to Paris, but she doesn't want to go, she's terrified of flying, never having ever had the courage to do it, doesn't really think highly of the French and wants to obey the sentence in her citizen application that says don't leave the country during the process.  So she stays at home, only to receive a phone call where she is dumped because her fiance has met a more exciting younger French girl.  She of course now must fly to Paris (in her mind), and finds herself seated next to Kevin Kline's character who is a thief and smuggler, that ridicules her but gets her through the flight.  He puts something in her bag, but she is robbed at the hotel before he can run into her and get in back.  He's got to put up with her whining, pretending to help her get her fiance back while waiting for his opportunity to get back his stolen item.

This sort of movie is always pretty predictable and this one does follow that, however the ending is stupid in how it gets there and isn't believable, or really explained why Ryan's character does what she does.  That lets the film down.  However there's a lot of laughs along the journey, including never seeing the Eiffel Tower by it being blocked from her view, when it was the only thing she conceded to her fiance was maybe worth seeing in France.",1483574400,2,2000,4.381081081081081

688816,4,6303617719,"I don't like the scene where Kline and Ryan are about to have sex (she with her former fiance and he with her former fiance's new fiance), but I fast forward through it.  The rest of the movie made me laugh and the scenery was great. I had forgotten how funny Meg Ryan can be and even though Kevin Kline plays a rogue without much of a moral compass, I found myself rooting for him.",1482278400,,382,4.093333333333334

I returned it and got a new replacement copy...with the very same issue!  another reviewer mentioned same issue. Must be a manufacturing issue with this new release.  Also no true widescreen.  Really disappointed.",1481673600,,316,5.0
688818,5,6303617719,"Not only is this one of my favorite movies, but it has become a favorite of my students, seniors in French II. What should be a disconnect is that this is a film about white people--and my students are African-American, yet over and over they told me how much they enjoyed this film. Now why is that?

Is it the universal story of love lost then regained? But it isn't. Is it a story of generosity of spirit and finances? Yes, but that isn't it. Is it the story of finding oneself and one's place in the universe. Yeah, that's it. As with these seniors seeking their place.

Kate (the inimitable Meg Ryan) and Charlie have a predictable relationship until Charlie goes to Paris on a business trip. In two days he meets--and falls in love--with the beautiful Juliette. Engagements both end and begin. And Kate overcomes her terror of flying.

The first clue that Kate is beginning to find herself is her blossoming friendship with her seatmate on the flight over. The charming Luc (played to perfection by Kevin Kline) challenges Kate's previously held beliefs. The two become entangled in a secret: Luc brings back to France both a grapevine and a costly necklace which he secretly puts in Kate's purse. Shakespearian comic elements rule the rest of the movie.

Steadily, Luc builds Kate's confidence, and in doing so, strengthens his own. By the time the scene at Cartier's comes to be, Kate has ended her relationship with Charlie but tells Luc that they are back together. In a gesture of generosity, Kate gives her nest egg to Luc to buy his wine fields. It was on this occasion when I made out a study guide that I came for the very first time to see that Kate knew the outcome of her story with Luc.
You can see it in her face in the cab and on the airplane. She knows. Then the final words of the movie: I want you.",1481673600,,1822,4.4624624624624625

688879,5,6303617719,"The first time I watched this is probably when it was released on DVD and after watching it for my first time, not only did I thoroughly enjoy it as I still adore Meg Ryan's You've Got Mail with Tom Hanks, these are two most adored of Ryan's films in my world, coming from a guy whose gotten so sick and tired of all these lame, cheesy, grossly overdone action films, gotten sick and tired of these no longer scary horror movies of whatever nowadays, clearly, of any genre of film there is, I've gotten to where I'm turning into my mother.
Gimme comedies, romances or romantic comedies. Anything funny or something on a feel good scale, bring it because whatever else there is can just bite the butt and the dust because all others just don't do it anymore for me.
You can give me comedies or anything involving somebody going on a trip to somewhere fun and adventurous, just like the newer version of the movie Rat Race with Whoopi Goldberg and Breckin Meyer along with Jon Lovitz.
That wasn't just funny as heck but also adventurous beyond anything on that scale of not just funny but fun.
What I love about French Kiss is your not just watching it but living and walking around Paris and all of France with them and that's what I like about it the most.
Its not just funny, its not just fun or lively or romantic but.....atmospheric and comfortable.
That's why everybody loves it and while I can't remember when I bought it but now, since this month when I got to thinking about it and while writing my Montgomery family series of stories and books, (fourteen of them already finished in less than a year), I had an idea for one involving being in Paris, France and I was going to replay that movie so I can write down some addresses from the film but guess what?
I either misplaced it or I can't find it anymore.
It is nowhere in this house and no longer in view or in my movie library and since I had to get myself to the nearest Dollar General store to put thirty dollars on a Amazon gift card so I can repurchase the movie and to keep it in sight at all times, I will be not just watching this again however many times but I just miss being in France and I bet that's where my first copy I bought however long ago ended up.
Its lost in Paris, France and it didn't even take me with it.
""Damn you"" he mutters as he types it at the same time.
But now that I bought myself another copy of it and not letting it get away from me this time, along with another Meg Ryan movie and also Mother's Day coming to me in less than a week, this I'm glad I did tonight because after have kept the television off for a count of three and a half years and not watching anything anymore as I'm doing nothing but writing my own literature and books of just about anything, I've got to get myself back in the movie watching habit and watching television more and that means its time for me to go back to Paris with Meg Ryan and to the states again with her in The Women and spending time with Mrs. Aniston and seeing how she's enjoying Mother's Day because.....heh, heh!
Considering what all I saw in the trailer on iTunes, that's a somewhat new take on the one holiday that's all about mom.
What do you think our mothers are doing right now?
I just can't wait to get myself back to Paris because I sure miss it.",1476576000,,3299,4.229793977812995

689665,5,6303617719,"This is a fantastic movie, the very definition of a romantic comedy. Classic, timeless, wonderful. Meg Ryan was such a cutie before she decided to try and perpetuate her youthful looks and let a plastic surgeon disfigure her (I think cosmetic surgery should be outlawed, based on her experience alone), she is funny, her timing is perfect, she was (and I'm sure still is) a great actress. Kevin Kline, wow, great performance. Good fake French accent, too.

Basically, and you probably already know this, this is the story of a jilted woman who goes to France to win back her fianc and ends up having an entirely different adventure. As a fellow sufferer, the scene where she has a lactose-intolerance reaction is perfect. She must really have the affliction to pull it off that well.

I love every single thing about this movie, there is no instant of it that I don't just worship (as much as you can worship a film). I had (stupidly, probably) always hoped she and Kline might make a follow-up film where they were....oops, almost gave away the ending. Great movie.

The scene that will make you belly laugh is about the ass twitching.

It is really funny in some parts, has a lot of great character play and is a well done romance as well without being way too gushy.  No one contracts a fatal disease, tears are noticeably absent other than as part of the humor (and therefore the Oscar nominations are also missing).  The story, however, is great, the acting seamless and it is first class entertainment.  I bought this one for my daughter who somehow had missed seeing it earlier.

Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan may seem to be a mismatched couple, but the film's ability to build chemistry between their two characters has one hoping that they do get together in the end. Also what I enjoy about the film is it's message that living a life with someone who has the same goals as you is much more rewarding than living a life with someone that half-heartedly share your goals.",1389484800,,496,4.231578947368421

Kline isn't ugly but in this film he is so unkempt you can almost smell the odor oozing out of the screen. Take a ride on a subway or a walk through a shelter then tell me this couple would really get together.

Meg Ryan is typical early 90's Meg Ryan (think ""You've Got Mail""), so that's predictable and fine, I suppose, but Kline steals the show (sometimes literally - he plays a thief!). the story is cute and, again, predictable, but fun to watch for the French scenery, the variety of character actors who enter and exit on a regular basis, and Kline's memorable and incredibly fun performance.

The warddrobe hasn't aged well, but, given that this was released in the 90's, that's to be expected.",1384732800,,600,4.714285714285714

I wanted to watch another movie with Kevin Kline but I did not like the part he played in this other film after viewing him as an unkept Frenchman.

Kevin Kline, who embraces his character's devilish personality, truly balances out the type A personality of Meg Ryan's character. It's a movie about how you expect to love someone, how you envision one scenario for your life... and how all of that can change when you step out of your boundaries and allow life to happen. (This is not very specific summary of this movie. However, I showed this to a boyfriend, and then to his parents, and then to the rest of his family. They absolutely adored the film, each and every one of them.)",1378166400,,716,4.473282442748092

Meg Ryan is fine, but nothing special (plus, she looks like Ellen DeGeneres for most of the movie), but Kline is a ton of fun as a Frenchman, obviously relishing the accent.  Their chemistry's not bad, and it moves at a good pace.  The transfer is nice, though it's not going to make you feel like you're seeing the movie for the first time (see The Quiet Man for that).

I would really have enjoyed a commentary with Kline and or Ryan. Some 'making of' footage showing the beautiful locations, etc. Oh well, as I said, didn't expect anything, so I'm not let down, just wishing for another release, maybe.

Kate is afraid of flying so she stays home in her newly adopted country, Canada; that is until Charlie finds a French goddess (Susan Anbeh) and calls the whole thing off. Kate won't stand for this and gets up the courage to fly. On her way, she meets an obnoxious Frenchman Luc Teyssier (Kevin Kline). Little does she realize that their paths will cross again and again.

As in the movie ""Boys' Night Out (1962) with Kim Novak"", Kate, Charlie, and Luc, only know what they are supposed to want in life. They pursue their wants until they find that they really want something different than they were supposed to want. That is a lot of wants.

Lots of action, one-liners and great music (French Kiss: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.) I notice that all the time Kate is in Paris that she just misses seeing the Eiffel Tower by a few seconds. She does find an Eiffel Tower souvenir that reminds her of Luc.

Everyone is perfect for the part. I would almost thing that Kevin Kline was French. Laurent Spielvogel plays the Concierge and has the attitude that Johnny Carson always says the French have. Even Jean Reno (birth (location) Casablanca, Morocco) seems exceedingly French.

Just arrived, and it's the same as the earlier version with only the DVD cover changed. Still low-resolution letterbox format. I need subtitles these days to help with the dialogue, so I can choose to blow up the image and lose the subtitles or watch a movie that fills only half my high-resolution television screen.

I saw and loved this film when it came out and recently picked it up at the library.  I rarely watch a film more than once and have, on many occasions been disappinted at seeing a once-favorite that didn't stand the test of time.

But last night when I needed a respite from the worries of the day, I put this in the player and was again, immediately transported to the land of delight where a really good film can bring you.

I won't relate the story---just to add my applause to the others who have enjoyed this film so much.  Meg Ryan shows her remarkable range from sensitive woman to outrageous clown.  She's not afraid to show her vulnerability which endears her so much to the audience. (In my opinion she is a much underrated actress by the ""professionals"" who often equate physical beauty with lack of talent.)  Kevin Kline is every bit her match, even more so, as the French bum who fulfills all of her worst stereotypes. In short, he is hilarious! This ia a match made in Heaven and although we know how it will end, these two keep us in the palms of their hands as we watch the drama unfold.

Some here say the script is limited but I found it just complex enough.  There are times when you want to sit back and enjoy the scenery and this is one of them.  And the music---again, just right.  Play through the credits and you'll have the treat of hearing Kline sing ""La Mer"" in French.  Someone wrote that Gerard Depardieu refused the part to which I say ""merci beaucoup.""  Meg Ryan was lucky and so were we!

I liked Ryan's two ""chick-flicks"" with Tom Hanks but this one far surpasses them.  Kline can act figure-eights around Hanks and does so here.  In fact I think it's a diservice to call this a chick-flick; it far transcends the genre.",1327536000,2,1864,4.39067055393586

Its really the chemistry and friendship between Luc (Kline) and Kate (Ryan) that make this movie great. You can tell from the fist time they meet that they are meant for each other, they just need to stop fighting for two minutes to figure it out for themselves! The clashing of luc's crazy and grab life by the horns phylsophy with Kate's paranoia and ultra controlling nature make for hilarious moments and a very witty film.

French Kiss is a great film, but it does have its slow moments. However, the very few flaws are well worth get through to enjoy rest of the story. Highly suggest you find a way to buy or see this movie.",1310083200,,864,4.327160493827161

Bottom line, the new DVD (this product) of French Kiss is done in a 2.35 aspect ratio ... but the bars are so thick/wide and the picture is so small, that you need a magnifying glass to enjoy it ...

691912,5,6303617719,"Meg Ryan helped produce this truly charming and thoughtful romantic comedy which sort of slipped in and out of theatres much too fast upon its initial release in the 90's. Perhaps because it unfolds slowly and relies on gentle charm and intelligence rather than flashes of nudity and raw situations to reel the viewer in, many used to being bombarded by the latter simply didn't have the patience to stick around for what is one of the best romantic comedies to come along in ages.

Lawrence Kasdan let this dish simmer until the aroma finally overcomes the viewer, our hunger rewarded once it is finished by its delectable flavor. Beautifully shot by Owen Roizman, the lush backgrounds take a back seat to the story in a film that is sweet and irresistible. Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline are both wonderful in the kind of film which doesn't get made anymore.

Kate (Meg Ryan) is devastated when her boyfriend (Timothy Hutton) decides to stay in Paris and marry a breathtaking French beauty who makes him think of sonnets rather than return and marry her. She overcomes her phobia of flying in order to confront him, but meets a charming French thief named Luc (Kevin Kline) on the plane with plans to use her to smuggle something past customs.

There is a tender charm to everything which follows as Kate and Luc get entangled in each others problems and finally realize who they really need. Jean Reno is excellent as Luc's cop pal who really doesn't want to arrest him but has to get back what was taken. When Kate discovers what Luc needs the money for, it will change her entire outlook on the situation. A pact to help each other may go awry, however, as each finally discerns that it may not be too late to go for what they really want in their hearts.

This is a rich and rewarding film, with the appeal of a warm and unexpected smile from an unpretentious girl. It sticks with you afterward, while other films in the genre with less depth and more flash are forgotten five minutes after you see them. A simple kiss from a half-asleep Kate on a train which stirs feelings in Luc he had not counted on is more memorable because of the way in which it is handled. Ryan is hilarious crawling down a hallway covered in food at one point, trying not to let Charlie (Hutton) and his hot French girlfriend Juliette (Susan Anbeh) see her.

Watching this delightful film is like reading a book rather than leafing through a magazine. It takes longer to get to the end, but the rewards are far greater. This romantic comedy has been repackaged for Valentine's Day, in red and white, a heart capturing the cover picture. While it is a tad more than the normal release, it is still quite inexpensive, and a nice gift for the smart girl in your life who doesn't need to be hit over the head cinematically to enjoy something. A subtle gem.",1231113600,2,2828,4.526418786692759

691914,3,6303617719,"I started watching Bollywood films a few years ago and one of the first movies that I saw from India was called ""Pyaar To Hota Hi Tha"", which is a Bollywood remake of ""French Kiss"".  It was a great story with beautiful people and nice music.  The movie runs almost 3 hours and the two people in this film were Ajay Devgan and Kajol (actual husband and wife) who played the role of Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan.

If you liked ""French Kiss"", then rent ""Pyaar To Hota Hi Tha"" from Netflix or wherever.  Since you know the story, check it out with a Bollywood spin.  You'll love it.

692025,2,6303617719,"""French Kiss"" just didn't do it for me.  I was expecting sparks, amusement--what I got didn't do it.

When the film opens, we see Kate (Ryan) in a plane trying to make herself comfortable.  In the middle of takeoff, she loses it and tears what turns out to be a plane simulator apart.  She returns home to tell her fiancee Charlie (Timothy Hutton) he's going to have to go to the medical conference in Paris without her. They part with plans to buy a home together from the nest egg Kate has built up.  She gets the word a few days later, via phone that Charlie's fallen in love with a French goddess and he's going to get married before he returns.

So, Kate gathers her courage and actually takes that plane to Paris to get back her man.  Her seatmate on the flight is Luc (Kline) a handsome Frenchman who unbeknowst to her swindles a grape plant and a diamond necklace in her luggage.  He offers her a ride to Paris from the airport believing that he can recover the goods from her. When they separate and Kate's baggage gets stolen, Luc helps her retrieve it, but he realizes he doesn't have the diamond necklace so he has to chase her across France to get it...

Writing it, the story sounds a lot better than what I sat through.  The humor just wasn't there for me--both Kate and Luc had 'problems' they had to overcome during their trip.  Both of those problems felt more like too much information than anything interesting.  None of the characters actually 'clicked' to me.  While the plot was enough to keep me watching, it wasn't enough to make me actually 'like' the film. I guessed the mystery and was just waiting to be proven right. The soundtrack, sadly, was so many of the same old songs I hear on almost every American made French movie.

If you love French films, any of the principal actors, romance--you may like this film. I just considered it 'lite' on all of the elements that should have been present.

692206,5,6303617719,"This film is one of my top 5 favorite films of all time.

Let me make a few things clear just so you know what value that statement has.

I may be a hopeless romantic, but I rarely watch romance films, because they always seem too frustrating.

I am a hopelessly cynical film critic.

That being said, this is probably the best romance film to come out of Hollywood in the last 50 years.

The storyline follows an American woman, Kate, who has moved to Canada but is not yet a citizen there, with her fiance. Kate hates to fly, in fact she never flies to the extent that the first thing you see is her attempting to get comfortable with flying. Her fiance, Charlie, has to go  to a business conference in Paris, France. Though without much conflict, he goes alone, Kate being unable to conquer her fear of flying.

Several days later, Charlie calls her and confesses through his drunken stupor that he isn't coming back and he has found someone else.

Kate makes a decision, bites her lip, and buys a ticket on the next flight to Paris. With the help of an odd Frenchmen named Luc (Pronounced Y-uc) Teyssier, she manages to cross into Paris, and thus begins her valiant journey to reclaim the man she loves. What she doesn't know is that Luc is a thief, and a good one at that, and while he hides a valuable diamond necklace in her bag, the wild romp through France begins.

This movie is one of those movies that will dazzle you EVERY time you see it. And its also the kind of movie where you pick up new things almost every time you see it. The acting is so superb, the music is wonderful, and the scenery cannot be more picturesque.

692209,5,6303617719,"Ever since ""Harry Met Sally"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", and ""You've Got Mail"", Meg Ryan is synonymous with romantic comedy. Her facial expressions, amusing antics and humorous predicaments make her one of Hollywood's most adorable and adored comedic actresses. ""French Kiss"" meets all the above criteria, plus more. It has a great story line, twisted and twisting plot with well developed characters and romantic escapades set in Paris, Cote D'Azur and Provence (or other French wine country setting).

Kate an American school teacher met Charley a businessman, as she plans their future life together, even to the point of scoping out a nice suburban two story future home ... She has applied for Canadian citizenship, when Charley unexpectedly is called to Paris on a business trip. Kate has a fear of flying and does not accompany him.

692211,4,6303617719,Being a Kevin Kline fan but NOT a Meg Ryan fan I did not want to see this initially.  My husband talked me into it.  I think it is a pretty run of the mill romantic comedy.  If you like either or both of the actors you will probably like this movie.

692212,5,6303617719,"Imagine if Henry James were a Hollywood screenwriter: Meg Ryan as American (soon to be Canadian) naif - basically a modern Daisy Miller, chasing her fiance Timothy Hutton across Europe, only to be seduced by the French rogue, Kevin Kline.  But because it is Hollywood, the studio makes him screen test the thing, and the focus groups demand he collaborate with a ghost-writer, re- write the script as a comedy, turn the doom of the story on the fiance, while giving the rogue a heart of gold and the movie a happy ending.

Or something like that.

Which is only to say that this is a great movie.  Perpetually entertaining.

The cast is terrific. Meg is as always (can you guess? That's right) adorable.  Kevin is a pretty convincing Frenchman- though my French is not perfect, I think his acting in that language does all Americans proud.  Tres bien fait, Kev.  Timothy Hutton - just why is it that we don't see more of him, anyway?  And Jean Reno is simply le grand maitre ninja fran'cais.

Now, this is a Hollywood fabrication, or rather production.  So unsurprisingly the story is somewhat predictable and crammed with caricatures.  But no matter.  It is light, often funny, and just plain enjoyable.  And I highly recommend it.",1147737600,3,1232,4.723004694835681

692304,4,6303617719,"I'm writing this review for people who want to know how they could possibly get this fantastic movie for such a cheap price.  First, let me say that I love this movie.  I have owned it on VHS for years and have finally replaced it on DVD.

There aren't any special features on this disc other than a theatrical trailer.  That's fine with me - I wasn't expecting much for $5.99.  However, the picture quality is a little grainy in comparison to today's DVD releases - I suppose because the movie is 11 years old and they just slapped it on a DVD without any kind of remastering of the picture quality.  Again, not really a problem for me because I like the movie so much.

My main concern was with the subtitles.  There are several conversations in the film that take place in French.  The English subtitles on this DVD are piece-meal at best.  By that I mean it will display the first half of a sentence but not the second half.  If I had not seen this movie many times already and knew what was being said, I would have missed half the conversations, sometimes containing important-to-the-plot information.

Maybe there is a way you can set your TV to have English subtitles up all the time and it will overlap the poor quality ones on here.  Or maybe it is a technical problem with my DVD - who knows!  I just thought people should know what they're getting when they buy this version of the film.

For the record - I still love this movie!  Ryan & Kline are fantastic!",1141344000,12,1471,4.352941176470588
692305,5,6303617719,"What is a romantic comedy without Meg Ryan?  Not quite the same and that is why ""French Kiss"" works.  Meg's character of Kate is very similar to her Sally Albright of ""When Harry Met Sally"" - - very stiff, predictable, a bit standoffish and definitely proper.  With another actress playing either part, the character might not garner much sympathy.  And if the audience does not like Kate (or Sally, for that matter), the movie simply would not work.

Fortunately, Meg is made for Kate.  Her inate cuteness makes her a very likable character, and despite seeing her flaws early in the film, you just KNOW that she has something special under her skin, just waiting for the right person to bring it out.

Which is definitely and obviously not Charlie (Timothy Hutton), her staid fiance, who leaves on a business trip to Paris without her (she suffers a tremendous fear of flying) and before you can say ""viva la France"", he promptly falls in love with the French and lovely Juliette, who apparently has nothing to do but walk around as Charlie's arm candy.  Charlie calls Kate to break off their engagement and despondent, she forces herself to fly to Paris, desperate to save their relationship.  En route, she encounters Luc (brilliantly played by the extraordinary Kevin Kline), a French thief, returning to Paris with the intention to use an unwitting Kate as his mule.  Having her luggage stolen requires Kate to join forces with Luc (she, to find Charlie and woo him back; he, to find her stolen luggage and keep an eye on his smuggled goods).  As they travel through France, with Luc instructing Kate on how to win Charlie back and lighten up, and trying to outrun and outsmart the French police, lead by Jean Reno, Kate begins to rethink where her affections lie.

All in all, I absolutely LOVE this movie!  Kevin Kline is wonderful, as always, and he and Meg Ryan have a genuine chemistry and affection.  This is a feel good film, a light romantic comedy with stunning and beautiful scenery.  If you love France, this is a gorgeous love letter to the country.

It maybe isn't the most realistic, but for romantic escapism, it's tops.  Kevin Klein is great here, as usual, and believable as a Frenchman thief who finds his heart stolen by a whimsical, befuddled woman (Meg Ryan).

I'm not a big Meg Ryan fan, but she's wonderful in this piece, and makes a remarkable transformation on screen from horrified, squeaky girl to remarkable and capable woman.  Klein undergoes a similar softening transformation.  It's a subtle and gradual change for both, and the effectiveness and tightness of the screenplay and dialog contribute to a wonderfully-entertaining overall product that I can watch over and over again.

The pacing is great and the supporting characters (particularly the concierge at the hotel) are wonderful and help contribute to the fun.

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, Jean Reno and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

Meg Ryan once again plays the quirky control freak aside a flighty frenchman (Kline) with alterior motives. This movie truely taps into certain stereotypes but also reveals some sincere attributes that both American and French cultures don't make apparent. It does have the typical ""opposites attract"" theme that is ever so popular with comedic romance films, but it works in this case.

Sometimes I just want to sit back and watch American romance comedies - they're usually so much fun. So I watched this, knowing I don't usually like her, hoping that maybe she could change my opinion of her. She didn't.

Poor Kevin Kline. This movie could have been really exciting - a reunion with Jamie Lee Curtis would have been perfect - Curtis could have pulled this off with ease. Or how about Jennifer Aniston - a great comedic actress who has the skill for serious drama. But Ryan is just Ryan in this movie: I saw her Kate in ""Kate and Leopold"" and other Ryan major roles all surface in this flick... and was turned off as usual.

There is a strange physical jaunt that she expels in many of the romantic comedies that she is in - in exasperation, she thrusts her arm into the air and bends slightly at the waist rocking back and forth, in an ""Aw - sheesh - damn"" kind of rhythm which is so trite and so unnecessary - that she throws at us again in this film. More than once. It is tiring, and too recognizable: why should I be reminded of ""Kate and Leopold"" or ""When Harry Met Sally"" every time I see Ryan?

The story is fun and smart, the supporting cast is great. Everyone shines - especially Kevin Kline, whom I don't consider supporting cast, don't get me wrong. He is perfectly cast as the Franco-American with dreams as of yet beyond his grasp. He is sly and wise as a criminal, and gives us the benefit of the doubt throughout this movie.

Paris becomes her own character in this beautiful comedy filled with the romance of a great city all under the watch of the sparkling Eiffel. This movie is directed by Lawrence Kasdan and he works the film around beautiful scenic French views leaving viewer's that love Paris breathless and begging for more. The storyline is humorous and the actors perfectly cast in roles that they seem natural at playing. The film is effortless to watch and that must be why it draws me in year after year.

Meg Ryan plays a woman engaged to Timothy Hutton in a boring and predictable little relationship. Things change drastically when Hutton goes to Paris on business and leaves Ryan at home because she is afraid to fly. But there is nothing like an old jealous heart to overcome such a silly phobia and Ryan finds herself on a plane to Paris to save her man from the arms of a beautiful young Parisian. Aboard the plane she meets Kevin Kline, who represents all things stereotypically French! Ryan is always perfect as the girl next door who stumbles about trying to stay in love. She is cute and perky as usual. Hutton is staid and serious until he is seduced by a vibrant and passionate French woman and begins his mid-life crisis falling for the belief that this seductress wants him and not his salary. Kline is convincingly French, with his wild haired and open minded talk, his always present dismissing pout and his passion for life. The fun begins as the plane lands in Paris and it never ends.

If you love France this film will romance you many times over. The cast is great together and the romantic comedy great for the heart. From the most romantic city in the world Kasdan gives us a new reason to dance and a desire to kiss as the French do!",1094601600,75,1965,4.49859943977591

Meg Ryan is Kate, and her fiancee has just dumped her for a French Goddess. So, as anyone willing to drag themselves through the dirt for another, Kate follows them to France, bent on getting her beloved Charlie back.

She meets Luc, played masterfully by Kevin Kline on the way, and from there begin a series of adventures that would be unfair to give away in this review.

This movie got four stars mostly because Kevin Kline cannot go wrong. He is startlingly sexy in this movie, and he delivers some of the most hilarious lines I've seen in a movie of this genre. He made the movie. Anyone else in his role would have made this just another chick flick.

There is just enough toilet humor in it to rob it of too much sentimentality, and even though the mushiness is something you go into this sort of movie expecting, it isn't so saccharine you feel you need to brush your teeth after watching it.

Meg Ryan is in her element, being cute and neurotic. It is a solid performance in a role typical for her and holds no surprises, nor does it stretch much.

Predictability robs it of a five star rating. Before the opening credits were done, I knew exactly what would happen, and needed only to discover how.",1092441600,4,1423,4.412213740458015

She is just so darn cute.  And ageless.  And perky.  And actually a wee bit sexy when she gets in the right mood.  And anyway since the movie takes place mostly in France (the stomping ground of my partially misspent youth) the scenery is nostalgic, the title is cute, and believe me, the food is delicious.
But what carries this movie is a beguiling performance by Kevin Kline and his very oo, la, la French accent.  I also liked the concierge who takes Meg's 100-Franc note (worth about twenty bucks) as his God-given concierge right with nothing more than a belated, merci you vile American touriste.
Okay, I have to confess.  I have a love/hate relationship with Meg.  I just want to take her home and tuck her into bed, but all she cares about is being cute on screen and teasing me.
Director Lawrence Kasdan (Body Heat 1981, Anne Tyler's The Accidental Tourist 1989, writing credits with George Lucas sagas, etc.) has a few jokes with the nearly all female theater audience and their drag-along beaux.  (Actually this video is currently being viewed on the couch across the nation by Roseanne Barr and John Goodman look-alikes with Roseanne making sarcastic remarks about Meg's eyeshadow and scrawny physique while Goodman chortles with squinty eyes as he anticipates the action to come aprs le flick.)  I especially liked the vast vineyard (Meg is drooling) that Kevin DOES NOT HAVE due to his wild and crazy ways (he says, but shows it to her anyway).  I mean, RESOURCES are what a real woman wants in a man, dodo brain.  What are you doing, playing hard to get?
Anyway, as all romance movie fans know, boy meets girl (cute), boy and girl cannot get it on just yet for 1001 wacky reasons, and finally boy gets girl or actually girl gets boy, and boy turns out to be worth getting as he naturally comes up with beaucoup des ressources of a very special kind.  Etc.

692432,1,6303617719,"A limp half-hearted attempt at a romantic screwball comedy that just doesn't work on any level. God knows Meg Ryan is cute enough, and she had a slew of other successful romantic comedies under her belt at this point, so she should have been able to waltz her way through ""French Kiss"". I guess director Laurence Kasdan just really dropped the ball here. Some very bad decisions on Ms. Ryans hair (which looks like someone hacked it up with garden clippers) and oversized, mannish clothes which are headed towards Annie Hall but end up making her look like Ellen DeGeneres, i.e., sexless instead of gamine. You also wonder until the last couple scenes if she was hiding a weight gain, or even pregnant...why cover up an attractive actress to this extreme a degree? But no, it's just bad costumes.
The usually attractive and funny Kevin Kline is very awkward here. He's working a half-way decent French accent, but it feels like he is straining. The character is poorly developed and not really likeable...""Luc"" never reforms (""Kate"" has to return his stolen diamond necklace to save him from jail), so we don't see a sea change in his criminal character. When Kate gives Luc her $45,000 life savings, accumulated for her marriage to Tim Hutton, you have to shake your head and wonder if she will ever see any of it again. It just isn't too believable that you would give this amount of money to a near stranger and leave yourself totally broke.
I couldn't help but wonder when Gerard Depardeiu turned this part down, why they didn't get a genuine French actor like the wonderful Jean Reno (here in a minor part as a police detective) for the part of ""Luc""...he would have been far better, genuinely French, and not stereotyped. But he's not Hollywood handsome like Mr. Kline, and this movie goes for the lowest common denominator.
The comedy is very low-brow with a dopey theme around lactose intolerance and a really terrible scene where Meg Ryan (trying to spy on her ex-fiance) trips clumsily into a cartfull of gooey pastries. Awful, Three Stooges stuff.
Worst of all is the ending. The least you expect in this type of film is a big romantic pay off at the end, where the characters discover that they love each other after all. Not here. The movie just runs out of gas (or maybe film)...it feels like Kasdan just had no clear idea of how to end things.  Luc appears magically on Kate's return flight to the US...next thing you know, French music is playing and they are hugging in his new (paid for by her) vineyard. (Oh for the days of pre-9/11 when you could even fantasize about barging onto a plane without a ticket.)
Adding to the general lackluster lameness...several scenes are totally in French with NO subtitles. These scenes appear to have some importance to the plot and while we can roughly guess the subject, it is just plain annoying not to know the actual dialogue.
I don't know real estate prices in the South of France, but my instinct tells me that $45,000 would not buy a vineyard with a charming old house. Probably not even a decent downpayment. (If it IS enough money, I am packing my bags immediately.)
To me, movies like ""French Kiss"" are not romantic at all. You don't feel any connection to the characters, there are no ""surprises"", you never feel those heart tugs that maybe they will NOT get together and you get no catharctic release when they finally DO get together. This is further proof (as if it were needed) that it's THE SCRIPT, STUPID. You need a great, clever script...even more than the actors. Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline are basically decent performers, but they have zero chemistry here.

692437,5,6303617719,"I have always really enjoyed a good romantic comedy.  I'm choosey about it.  The couple must have a good chemistry.  They must, for the most part, get along.  Some arguing is okay, but it must be lighthearted.  Neither of them should come across as wounded or broken people.  They should be whole and strong individually, and even better when they are together.
""French Kiss"" delivers all of that.  It is one of my very favorite romantic comedies, coming in just behind ""Roxanne"" and, at the top of the heap, ""When Harry Met Sally.""  Kate (Meg Ryan) is a whole person who knows what she wants, as is Luc (Kevin Kline).  They share a common problem in that they both misunderstand how to best go about achieving their goals.  They come together into a force to be reckoned with.  Timothy Hutton and Jean Reno round out the cast with spot-on performances.  Laurent Spielvogel as the concierge steals every scene he is in.
This movie has many splendid romantic moments.  The first kiss that Kate and Luc share is one of the finest screen kisses I've ever seen filmed.  It just makes you ache to be kissed like that.  ""French Kiss"" also provides some wonderful comedic moments.  When Kate describes for Luc a future in which he allows old resentments to fester and spends his days sitting and twitching, it makes me laugh every time.  As with most films, there are some low points.  I don't care much for broad comedy, so the collision with the dessert tray and the ""lactose intolerance"" scenes don't do much for me.  But for the most part, this is a fun film well worth watching.
I regret that I can give no insights as to the quality of the DVD or the special features included therein (although the description makes it sound like the special features are a little thin).

Meg is her usually plucky, witty, absolutely adorable self in this tale of a woman wronged by her fiance because she is too predictable and stuck in her ways.  The solution?  Be unpredictable and unconventional of course!  And there lies the humor and fun of the movie.  This journey of self-realization through reckless abandon takes her to Paris where she runs into a French criminal played by Kevin Kline.  Take note I said Kevin Kline because you WON'T recognize him in the movie.  If you've seen Kline in other roles like In & Out or Dave or any number of others, you will be shocked to see him play a very sexy Frenchman here.  He does a fantastic job of it too.  You get attached to Meg's character quickly and you can't help but to love Kline even though he plays a criminal ... which the writers want you to do.  This is quite a charming tale of good girl/bad boy romance amidst some great situational humor.  Add some beautiful scenery and what more could you ask for?",1035417600,16,1112,4.4504950495049505
692493,5,6303617719,"We've seen it before (When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless In Seattle) and since (You Have Mail), but Meg Ryan is indisputably The Right One for this cutesy-yet-not-too-slushy romantic comedy lark.
Aviophobic bride-to-be Kate (Ryan) is enthusiastically preparing for the lavish wedding when her fianc flies off to Paris on a medical conference ... only to 'phone-in a few days later with the startling announcement that Kate should cease wedding arrangements forthwith as ... he has fallen in love with a Frenchwoman. Disbelievingly, Kate faces her mortal fear of flying to get to Paris and shake him out of his infatuation. On the aeroplane she sits next to petty thief Luc Teyssier (Kevin Kline - Grard Dpardieu declined the rle). Exchanging stereotypical national dislikes, it is hate at first sight.
Or is it ...? Ryan is ever-cuddly and ever-so-slightly-ditzy, whilst Kline is perfectly-accented and stubbled, oozing a pretty darn convincing Gallic charm. Kate's rebuttals by the Georges Cinq's stoic Concirge - she puts down 100 Francs as a bribe; he simply takes it - are a treat. And so is her animated air-fighting following the theft of her luggage - ""Oh man ... ma stuff, man ..."" Almost as a fil rouge, Kate's wanderings through the City of Light include constantly not seeing the Eiffel Tower ... until she is on a train leaving Paris. Kate's earlier opinion of loser Luc turns via promiscuous rascal to grudging respect upon discovering that he is, in fact, a Man With A Plan, from a background in fine wine; that moment is quite poignant ... Hovering in the background is avuncular detective-sergeant Jean (Lon) Rno who is aware of Luc's family history as well as his current jewellery-smuggling, but who owes Luc a never-fully-explained life debt. It is he who actually rescues the mis-matched couple ...
Anybody who says ""They don't make 'em like they used to ..."" should swallow those ill-chosen words as the 1990s have produced endearing romantic comedies to counter the numerous over-the-top petroleum-jelly & mayhem Action Blockbusters. French Kiss may be a trifle formulaic, but its superbly-nostalgic soundtrack - Charles Trenet's rendition of Verlaine's 'Blesse Mon Coeur' is wonderfully evocative of an autumn stroll in Paris - and the fine interaction between Ryan and Kline help make this one of the more memorable and heartwarming feel-good films of the decade.",1034380800,12,2384,5.115384615384615

The performance by Meg Ryan is very good...as always...and Kevin Kline is also fun, although I did find his accent a little annoying at times.  I really enjoy watching this movie.  I guess its kind of addictive.
For DVD fanatics...the disc is not packed full of special features, the sound isn't amazing, the picture quality is average (for DVDs), but the story is fun.

692495,5,6303617719,"Romantic comedies need that perfect couple.  Once you've got Meg Ryan, you're more than halfway there.  Kevin Kline steps up to the plate here, with enchanting results.
Kline's stereotypical Frenchman (Luc) is as convincing (that accent!) as he is funny.  His uber-casual, morally lax attitude is well complemented by Ryan's uptight, loquacious American/wannabe-Canadian (Kate).  The movie rolls along at a merry pace - from Canada to Paris to Nice and Provence, all with distinctive, eclectic music.  The locations are beautiful and serve nicely as foils for the wacky partnership of Luc and Kate, as do the songs (in French and English).  Check out the end credits when Kevin Kline sings ""La Mer.""
The chemistry between Luc and Kate works like it does in screwball comedies - a lot of bickering sexual tension - but somehow the best and most revealing scenes are the ones where there is no dialogue (Luc and his vine, lost in Paris, train to Nice, Luc's family, dancing).  The script is a little lacking, but Ryan and Kline are charming during these quiet moments.
As you can imagine, with all this dualism of French and English, there is a lot of national humor - but I think the best summary of the movie is when Kate, who has lost everything (money, love, passport), wisely realizes, ""I am without country.""  Of course, she means this literally, but that wistfulness conveys more.  The differences between nationalities become irrelevant when it's really about fulfillment and dreams, which aren't bound by country lines.",1031184000,20,1526,5.0

In fact you can hardly tell it is him except on a few occasions when his grin comes through the character.  His character, Luc, a french thief adds a great deal to the movie.  He is definetly not the kind of person you would expect to see in this kind of romantic film giving this comedy a breath of fresh air from the now overdone Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks style of romantic comedy.

692652,4,6303617719,"Leonard Maltin is flat-out wrong to call this a ""charmless contrivance"".  Kline and Ryan have appeal to spare, easily managing to conjure up  chemistry against the backdrop of sumptuous France.  Though the setup may  seem implausible to the untraveled, it's actually not all that farfetched.  Coincidence is more obvious when you're traveling, if only because you  don't have the blandness of ordinary living to block your sight.  FRENCH  KISS merely highlights the possibilities of such coincidence.  It certainly  doesn't wallow in ""contrivance"" any more than, say, CASABLANCA, whose  entire storyline depends upon the unlikeliness of a drifter becoming a bar  owner in a backwater part of the world so that his former lover (in town  for a refugee convention) could happen to get thirsty.  I'm not saying  FRENCH KISS is as good as CASABLANCA, of course--merely that coincidence is  indeed possible, and that at least the coincidences here are of a smaller  order.
If anything's wrong with the movie it's that it follows Ryan's  standard 90's comedy formula.  Ryan starts with a fiancee who's as likely  to marry her as a security guard is to survive an episode of STAR TREK.  She eventually dumps him, ostensibly so she can be on her own and figure  herself out, but really so that she can make it with the guy who gets top  billing.  Some confusion ensues about the guy's identity and/or innate  value, and, after that's all sorted out, the credits roll.  It's not a bad  formula.  It really IS engaging and likeable.  But it's still a formula.  FRENCH KISS is no different, really, from SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE or YOU'VE  GOT MAIL.  Except...there's Kevin Kline.  For my money, Kline, or at  least his character, is a much better foil for Ryan than Tom Hanks.  He  comes much closer to being the kind of complicated, combative, difficult  man that Billy Crystal gave us in WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.  There might be  cause to take exception to his accent, as has been pointed out elsewhere,  but he's a more interesting character than Ryan has seen lately in a light  comedy.

This is an excellent example of how theatrical reviewers expect too much from a movie.  This was a funny and satisfying love story, not Ghandi. That's why I'm  adding it to my home video collection.",950227200,3,332,4.593220338983051
692680,5,6303617719,"It is rare that I rent a movie and actually watch it twice before returning it to the store.  But, with ""French Kiss"", I watched it three times and enjoyed it more and more with every viewing.  This is a  very cute and enjoyable film which any fan of Meg Ryan, Kevin Klein, or  romantic comidies will enjoy.  Both the acting and scenery are also  fantastic.  While the movie is wonderful, I found the DVD to be pretty weak  as far as extra features are concerned.  Scene selection and trailers just  doesn't cut it these days.  I would have really liked a behind the scenes  section or any other interesting tid-bits that could have been put on the  disc (I think an actors/dirctor comentary would have been great too).  The  transfer is really good though and the colors displayed during the country  side scenes are fantastic.  I highly recommend this film to just about  anybody.",949795200,,882,4.580645161290323
692681,5,6303617719,"This movie is for those who are romantic at heart.  It begins with somewhat of a domestic tragedy.  Kate played by Ryan was devasted when her fiance left her for a French goddess.  In a desperate attempt she flies to France in the hope of saving her love life.  While waiting to take off she  meet Luc and....you must watch the movie to find out.  In Paris everyone  falls in love...and you will too with this movie. French Kiss is a fun  movie to be watched with the one you love.  You will not be disappointed,  the scene of Paris and the French country side is beautiful.  Further  more...the music from this movie is great.  What are you waiting for go out  and buy yourself a copy, grab your loved one and watch this great film.",949017600,,733,4.294117647058823
692682,5,6303617719,"This is a really good movie.
Meg Ryan is hilarious as usual and she and Kevin Kline make almost as good a duo as she and Tom Hanks.
I'm not going to give the plot away, but if you've been jilted by a boyfriend, fiancee or  lover for someone else and need some humor in your life ( or ideas for  revenge.. ) , then this movie is for you.
Even if you've never been  dumped for a ""God-dess"" ( a term from the movie ), watching Kate  ( Ryan ) try to win Charlie, her fiance, back with the help of Luc ( Kline)  will crack you up.
Kate and Luc's mutual dislike for each other is the  foundation for many hilarious scenes.. especially the "" all men are  bastards "" scene.
It will keep your attention and keep you laughing  the entire time.  The plot isn't too silly, too cheesy, too mushy or too  unusual..
Simply put, this is a movie that you can watch with almost  anyone!
We own it and have 2 copies because one is already worn out!",945993600,6,929,4.021857923497268
692683,5,6303617719,"I have always been a fan of Meg Ryan but Kevin Kline stole the show in this movie.  His French accent is so convincing that I thought it was real. The movie is lighthearted and fun. You never have to worry about the  outcome because it just feels good all the way through.  The scenery is  spectacular and the plot, although somewhat far fetched, still keeps your  attention. A first class movie for sure!",945216000,3,405,4.418918918918919
692684,5,6303617719,"A gorgeous Meg Ryan, A broody but handsome French speaking(fluently at that!) rougish Kevin Kline, beautiful scenery set in the French  countryside, and some lively comedy, what more could anyone ask for!!??  It's a must see, must own movie. Too bad it's not on DVD!",941068800,2,266,4.888888888888889
692735,4,6303617719,"Critics who were lukewarm about French Kiss failed to place it as a Doris Day/Rock Hudson update.  Kevin Kline's combination of wit and vulgar good humor contrasts with the Rock Hudson emotional monotone.  Meg Ryan is  overtly sexy, compared with Doris Day's closet sex appeal, but both are the  nice-girl-nextdoor-you'd like to go out with.  It's the perfect straight up  Doris Day/Rock Hudson revision for the '90's.  (If you want an update with  Doris Day and Rock Hudson laughing at themselves and each other, then you  need John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis.)",914457600,,563,4.967741935483871
692736,4,6303617719,"Kevin Kline and Meg Rayan played their parts so well with all of the subtle cultural differences in tact for us to appreciate without tripping over.  Speaking as an American woman married to a Frenchman, I can say from  experience that the humor in this film definitely stems from true life!  If  you are in a Franco-American relationship of your own, you must see this  film.  We've been laughing over it for years!",912384000,,416,4.63013698630137
