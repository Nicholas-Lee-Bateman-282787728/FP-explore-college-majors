6473267,1,B00L6AW2MC,"I bought the original movie at a yard sale on a VHS tape three summer breaks from high school ago while visiting an older man named Alfred JD I met online. He befriended me in an AOL game room I would play in computer lab class. Most of the time we spend in his RV watching movies. Sometimes, we would go out now and then looking for yard sales, thrift shops with gently used items, swap meets or flea markets and garage sales. We would find some of the coolest movies and costumes and then go home to dress up in the theme of the movie we were watching.
In particular, we watched this one quite a bit even though we couldn't find any future (2029) Tokyo costumes. As he explained it to me, it would be far too difficult to actually find a used article of clothing from an animated future. That seemed reasonable enough. So, we would just watch it in the nude like Major Motoko Kunsanagi was for a great deal of the film.
This Blu-ray just doesn't do the movie justice. The picture seems too sharp. Almost hurts my eyes. Granted, I was usually drinking one of the delightful shakes Alfred would make for me while watching this  on tape, so my vision could of been off.",1411430400,8,1168,4.285067873303167
6473268,3,B00L6AW2MC,"If you're reading this, you've probably seen Ghost in the Shell and don't need me to recommend the content. It's a five-star anime movie, and this blu-ray is an excellent HD presentation of the original 1.0 version. The awful CG effects and green filters from the 2.0 version are gone. Hooray!

Unfortunately, the set still has serious flaws, so I subtracted two stars. For one, the subtitles are shamefully bad for such a high-profile release. There are serious timing issues, grammar and spelling errors all over the place, and a generally stiff and unnatural tone, as if the person writing the titles didn't speak English very well. At one point they even mess up the gender of a minor character. (FYI, it's a later reference to the programmer seeking asylum in the opening scene. They call him ""she."" Twice!) A few errors are understandable, but there are so many in this version that they start to distract from the story. Unpaid fansubbers have gotten it right in the past, so how can a publisher fail so badly?

Secondly, there are no extras apart from a couple of brief essays in the insert booklet. For a ""25th Anniversary Edition,"" that seems pretty cheap.

To sum it all up, if you haven't purchased this film before, this is definitely the best version available in the United States. However, it's far from a definitive release. This may be the best we'll ever get, but if you hate spending money on sub-standard releases, you may want to avoid this one anyway.",1411257600,337,1474,4.727626459143969
6473269,5,B00L6AW2MC,"Instead of being the millionth person to wax poetic about the significance of this cyberpunk masterpiece by Shirow, Oshii, and Production I.G., I will comment on the details of the release. My star rating is for the movie itself, but I was sort of hoping that this blu ray would have NEW extras. One of the other reviews notes that this is the ""unaltered"" 1995 version but the ""2.0"" release had both versions so I am not sure why anyone would pay $25 dollars for just the 1995 movie when the ""2.0"" blu ray is going for $6-$11 on Amazon at present and contains TWO versions of the film. If there are new extras the description has failed to list them.",1407801600,23,650,4.380165289256198
6473270,4,B00L6AW2MC,"I've been an anime fan since the early 90's and this DVD shares the same place carved out for the classics, and if your an old school collector you know exactly what releases I'm referring to such as Akira, Battle Angel,Vampire Hunter D and so many more which I can't even begin to  list here without running out of space or going off target from my real intent of submitting this review. But yes purist will love this, especially if it's the original 95 theatrical release and not the 2.0 reboot that I hate sooo much! and can't watch for no more then 5mins after the opening scene due to the cheesy CGI embedded into this useless reboot. But yes! I can't wait for this US  Blu Ray release because it's certainly long over due and to be honest somewhat insulting that this classic gem wasn't dressed up and repackaged years ago after Blu Ray became a standard. Anyone interested in anime or just starting their collection should own this and see anime done right!  I miss the days of mature serious anime. There use to be such a nice balance of both adult and campy anime 20 -28 yrs ago now but being able to purchase releases like this helps. I also recommend adding the new Arise series to your collection it embodies the same feel as the 95 version with a more modern twist to reflect the changing times and definitely more new generation friendly.",1407542400,10,1352,4.465587044534413
6473271,5,B00L6AW2MC,"Watching this glorious film is pretty much one of the unwritten rules for being a true anime fanatic. Much has already been said of Ghost in the Shell, so it's quite a task to provide new insight into a movie that's been analyzed and praised many times over. It's that good. Already beautiful to look at in standard definition, the future-proof animation looks even more striking in Blu-Ray. Keep in mind that this is the original, 1995 unaltered version, and not the 2.0 version that included some animation revisions. Purists have not been as receptive to the latter, but honestly both have the same top-notch film-making quality in them, so it's worth checking out the original first and then giving Ghost in the Shell 2.0 a try later.

The film's influence is not hard to see, so look no further than The Matrix or even Avatar. It's essentially cop versus villain, who is, for all intents and purposes, a ghost with dangerous abilities, all set against a futuristic and meticulously political backdrop. Fans of cyperpunk flicks and philosophy-driven Sci-Fi films will be fascinated by how daringly complex the whole presentation is. There's really no sign of any corporate or mainstream polish here. With that said, parents should be keen to keep this movie at a distance from kids. Beyond the violence and nudity depicted in this anime, its forefront thought-provoking mentality won't appeal to children anyway. For the grown-ups who are willing to give intelligent animated movies a shot, however, this is a treat on both the eyes and the mind.",1407283200,27,1550,4.938697318007663

Total nudity, but that weird kind where they show smooth round bare breasts without nipples. Whats up with that!?! Same thing with the rest of the nude female form.

If you are just a casual fan that watches movies in English, you will have no need for subtitles and therefore no problem with this 25th anniversary edition Blu-ray. The video quality is superb. The sound is fine. Everything I remember from all those years ago, only better, much higher quality. This goes for the English language version.

Now if you are using this to learn Japanese, then I will defer to the experts. I'm not learning Japanese. I don't care to watch it in its original language. I just like the movie, the artwork, and I'll take mine in English, thank you very much.",1496361600,6,660,4.5

6473332,5,B00L6AW2MC,"Deep dives into the nature of consciousness with a side platter of police action, gunplay and high-speed pursuit. At first glance this may come off as stiff and impenetrable, but like the thematically-similar Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell offers untold rewards to repeat viewers. The nature of our memories, how they define us, and the dangers of nefarious interference upon them; these are some pretty heavy topics, and it should come as no surprise that it takes some time to really let it all sink in. Reflective and immersive, the film spends a lot of time ruminating on the meaning of life - both in conversation and in the long, lingering glances of city still-life it indulges upon between bursts of action. In these scenes, Kenji Kawai's magnificent score really gets a chance to shine; haunting and alien, it's a strange beauty and a perfect pairing for the uneasy-in-your-own-skin themes explored by the film. The art direction is a similar brow-raiser, effectively bringing the residents and landscape of New Port City to life in a style that remains loyal to Masamune Shirow's original work while also carving out a bold, fresh identity of its own. It's rare for a twenty-year-old film about technology to still remain relevant in a modern light, but this one somehow seems even more appropriate today. The advent of smartphones and tablets alone has brought the essence of human interaction up for debate, and this lonesome vision of a near-future Japan now seems hauntingly prescient. A conceptual powerhouse, it does have faults - far too many stationary talking heads, breathlessly spouting plot points - but inarguably deserves its status as one of eastern animation's cornerstones. I fear its subtlety and nuance will be lost upon Hollywood's forthcoming live-action adaptation.",1489536000,,1799,5.122448979591836

6473345,3,B00L6AW2MC,"The release is cheap no doubt, and the video transfer is decent. But nothing is up to par like a film of this caliber demands. The subtitles for the Japanese track are all botched, with slang and grammar errors everywhere. Unreal. The 5.1 English track is missing sounds in many places as well. The video is decent like I said, but it's an old source, and it's letterboxed to a degree. I'm not sure who was in charge of this release but it's pretty much amateur hour throughout.

I recommend the film. If you can find it for 5 bucks it's not a bad purchase, but you have been warned about its problems.",1485820800,,602,4.327433628318584

English voice actors were great for all, save the major; I know shes an android and I could hear the detachment in her words but I didn't think the actor executed that vision properly.

In 2.0, what used to be almost teletype-esque sounds are replaced with this generic sounding digital blah, so it ruins the feel. Also, the 2.0 has opted to make everything this weirdly paint-like orange color which detracts from my visual enjoyment of the film. There's a reason why we all loved the original release.

For anyone who wants to delve into a cyber-future version of our world, after two additional World Wars have occurred beyond WW2, and where cyberization of humans with machines and the net is commonplace, GITS is your go-to title. It's actually quite impressive that even in 2016, many of the ideas from a 1995 movie are still only hypothetical or conceptual, but still so close to reality.

The movie is worth a watch by anyone who considers themselves a sci-fi, cyberpunk, alternate reality, or tech-world fan. Additionally, while the movie is completely stand alone, it does open the gateway to other GITS material, such as the Stand Alone Complex and 2nd Gig animated series, as well as ARISE. Many of those surpass this movie in quality and delivery, but for a 1995 film you have to give this film its due. For those not interested in such things, or find complicated plots boring or hard to follow, this might not be your cup of tea. Also factor in that the movie doesn't promote sexual content, but it does have some female nudity, so keep that in mind.

Lastly, GITS is not your typical anime. It is far more realistic and tame than some of the outlandish, whimsical, or ridiculous things you see in most Anime today. Treat this more as an animated film.",1472169600,4,1519,4.681647940074907

the movie is fine, but you do not need to buy bluray if the dvd is cheaper.  you'll gain absolutely nothing if you do.  let my mistake be your lesson.

it's dvd quality, and limited sound stage.  that's what you get.

so, if i were rating the dvd, i'd probably give 4 stars.  decent.  don't buy the bluray version if you think you're getting HD and/or decent surround sound.",1457654400,2,389,4.232876712328767
6473394,2,B00L6AW2MC,"The rating is for the bluray, not the movie itself, which deserves five star.

Side note: if you're fluent in Japanese and don't need the subs, rating is four stars, as the other issues are not that bad.

As mentioned in numerous comments, the subtitles are horrible. It seems that the translators had to work with just lines of text and never saw the movie. If you know a bit about Japanese language, you know that everything depends on context, and when you don't have context, it leads to bad translations, such as several ""she"" instead of ""he"", ""we"" instead of ""I"", etc. as the movie can be a bit complex, it can make it very hard for someone who never saw the movie to understand it.

The picture quality is okay, but for some reason is not true 1920x1080, there is a black frame all around the picture! I never saw that on a bluray before. As mentioned by others, it is the original version of the movie, not the new one with the cgi.

Japanese audio is decent, but at times seems to be outta sync (but it may be the movie, not the bluray).

Overall, if you saw the movie already and want to have s bluray (and don't have anything else), go for it. If you're new to GitS and don't mind a tiny drop in quality (really really tiny), and you can find it, go for the dvd instead, it'll have better subs.

6473408,3,B00L6AW2MC,"So...after my first viewing, my impression of this film is that it does not live up to the hype. When I heard that this was one of the inspirations for the Matrix, I was pretty excited to see it seeing as that's one of my favorite ""cyberpunk"" films. Perhaps my first mistake was watching the Arise series first. I was already familiar with most of the major characters, and though the context is slightly different, there were no surprises. But that aside, this is basically just an average police procedural with some intriguing technological concepts and an underwhelming hint of existential metaphysics. Maybe if I'd seen this 20 years ago, I'd feel differently. Perhaps these ideas are just too played out for me to love this film the way others do. The final thing I'll say is, and this may a bit Eurocentric since it's written and performed in a traditional Japanese musical style that I did not grow up with in the U.S., but I find the main (musical) theme for the film to be extremely annoying.

If you are already a fan of Japanese Anime, you should see this film because it's kind of like ""required reading"". If you are interested in Japanese Anime, but not sure where to start, watch Cowboy Bebop. The subject matter is completely different, but it's a fantastic show with a killer soundtrack. For a more entertaining police procedural that does a better job of conveying a dystopian future driven by an upside down relationship between subject and object (man and technology), I would recommend Psycho Pass.

Maybe my opinion will change after another viewing or two; it that happens, I'll let you know.",1442448000,2,1615,4.7437722419928825

The quality is great the english sub is just as I remembered. The 2.0 version with all the CGI was blegh, this version is old shool animated the way we watched it first time.

However.....the subtitles, must have been done by someone independent of the audio because they have NOTHING in common with what is being said. In fact some of the sentences don't even make sense. All your base are belong to us style. So if you can live without subtitles, and want an HD video version, this might be for you. I got it for $10 so I can't complain!  If you are watching it in Japanese and want English subs you might want to stay away from this one....as once again the subtitles are so bad I HAD to comment on them. They have literally nothing to do with the lines you remembered and straight out don't make sense.

For example
Spoken:
"" So why the nickname?""
""The nickname puppetmaster comes from the ghost hacking.""
""Well if he is so skilled, how come he is using an outdated HA3 virus?""
"" Think about it a minute. You have to figure he's either covering his tracks or decoying us. Even though a new technique would be harder for us to trace it might also arouse suspicion about colonel Malases role in this affair""

Subtitles:
""this is his first visit to Japan.""
""Why does such a badass use an old HA-3?""
""The new types are certainly harder to be detected or to be traced.
But, under the circumstances, people will suspect the former military leader Mares.""

Overall it'll work if you want to watch the movie in 1080p, and yes it looks fantastic, but you might want to consider just renting or buying a digital copy since it'll be just about the same.",1434844800,,749,4.208333333333333

6473439,5,B00L6AW2MC,"Just  finished watching; along with Jeff H., ""Ghost In The Shell,"" released by Anchor Bay Entertainment.
My first introduction to the hybryd cyberverse of the ""Ghost In The Shell"" universe was a little over ten years ago when the first episode of ""Ghost In The Shell - Stand Alone Complex"" first aired back on the Cartoon Network's Saturday's late night ""Adult Swim"" segement.  The two orginial Ghost anime series were compelling and absorbing, yet for some reason I never made it a point to watch the original anime movie that started it all until I received the 25th Anniversary Blue-Ray release.  Jeff H. was also intrigued this anime and wanted to see it.  I believe Zack has already seen it.
What made ""Ghost In The Shell"" unique at the time of its orginal silver screen release and still captivating and fresh today, was the way hand drawn animation was seemlisly combined with computer animation that created brilliantly stunning eye candy. [Naked female cyborgs aside.]
Set in the near future of 2029, Major Motoko Kusanagi of Section Nine, is pursuing the identity of ""The Puppet Master"" - an individual who is able to not only hack into any computer system in the world and steal data; but who can also hack into the ""ghosts"" of cyborgs and rewrite their memories and emotions.
SPOILER ALERT! - ""Ghost In The Shell"" is not a family friendly anime.  There is LOTS and LOTS of violence and swearing going on in this movie; along with female cyborg nudity.  There is also a scene which suggests a rather unique form of cyber-procreation to create a new form of cyberlife.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

Viewed through that lens this is an awesome piece of speculation and prediction.  There are odd features of the story (the ""ghost"" is reminiscent of some sort of incoherent Cartesian dualism, and the settings portrayed in the film seem to be Chinese, not Japanese), but this is a smart, visually stunning piece of work.  The translation is a bit odd at times, but not as terrible as I was led to expect by some other reviews.  Well worth getting this anniversary version.",1425081600,,752,4.58955223880597

6473456,3,B00L6AW2MC,"This is a review of the release, not the movie itself which I think is a masterpiece.

The main issue which has already been mentioned by other reviewers are the english subtitles. They're just plain bad. People watching this movie for the first time in japanese audio and english subs should be aware that any dialogue that comes off as strange or lines that don't make sense are the subtitles fault, not the movie. When you come across these (and you will), my advise is to rewind and listen to that scene in english.

Picture quality is great. It's a nice clean, crisp transfer. Everything looks absolutely beautiful.

The 2.0 japanese track sounds terrific. I can't comment on the 7.1 english track other than that the dub is mostly alright with the exception of the Major's voice who has a very slight New England accent.

There are no extras on the disc whatsoever which is an absolute shame considering this is a 25th anniversary release of a classic.

There is, however, a small 20-page booklet inside the case. It features three sections; an interview with the director about the use of CG in the film; a brief rundown of the GITS franchise; and a the impact of the film itself. These are a nice touch but really doesn't make up for the lack of extras, specially when considering even the DVD release had a few featurettes.

6473484,5,B00L6AW2MC,"First off, I'd like to say this review is totally biased as this is one of my favorite films of all time, and my favorite anime film of all time.

Second, I've noticed a number of 1 star and 2 star reviews for the flaws in this release, and I have to say, they are really not that bad. There are some audio issues that are there that don't really harm the film aside from a short little bit where the audio drops in volume which I find a tad baffling. I cannot attest to the quality of the subtitles, but the Dub is just good enough that I prefer to watch it over watching the filmed Subbed. However, judging from the reviews, if you're primarily a Sub watcher, this may be a deal breaker for you. Personally, I love the dub and the only thing that irritated me is the short moment where the audio volume dropped.

Is it the perfect transfer we've been waiting for? No. Is it finally a proper version of a classic on Blu-Ray? Yes it is. And it looks amazing. I'm still giving this five stars in spite of the flaws because, by gum, that animation deserves to go off the limit of the scale, the flaws bringing it back down to five. Even on DVD it looked amazing, and here it's simply breathtaking.

Especially with the price drop to $15, I would give this a full a recommendation. I spent the full $25 to preorder this and do not regret it at all.",1414972800,,1345,4.165384615384616

6473486,3,B00L6AW2MC,"I tried to get into GITS way back in 1999 and it just didn't wash with me. I thought it was because the material was perhaps above me and that this kind of sci-fi was outside of my comfort zone. Now, all this time later, I decided to revisit the movie hoping that my older, more refined judgement would let me see the movie in a different light. Nope. It's still as impenetrable as it always was.

In light of more recent sci-fi such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deus-Ex-Human-Revolution/dp/B00DJ42BUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deus Ex Human Revolution</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transcendence/dp/B00J5JSV1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transcendence</a>, and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RoboCop/dp/B00GST8UB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RoboCop</a>&nbsp;when you think about it (all of which have a strong thematic connection), GITS does have some relevance and an intriguing idea in a world that is evolving digitally far, far quicker than it is evolving socially or ethically. The story has so much to offer in that regard, it's ripe for satire, commentary, and allegory but nothing becomes of it. The credits roll at the 78 minute mark leaving you feeling that you've been short-changed. There is a lot of potential in the set-up but it's mostly squandered on techno-babble and overwrought, pompous dialogue that is rife with exposition.

The movie was followed (and its universe expanded) by a sequel in 2004, an OVA, and a TV series, but this original venture feels more like a truncated TV pilot instead of a completely stand-alone movie. I am glad I gave the movie another go but the adoration mystifies me and the fans don't convince me.

The Blu-Ray is in 1.78:1 1080p and is slightly windowboxed, which is ludicrous for a 2014 release. The sound is in DTS HD-MA and there are absolutely ZERO extras.",1412467200,5,1956,5.904593639575972
6473487,1,B00L6AW2MC,"The film itself I would easily rate 5 stars. The video quality and Japanese audio are also very good. The 1 star however is for the serious problems this release unfortunately has.

Like mentioned in bonjanqi's review here, the subtitles are not good with misspellings, errors, and numerous lines with awkward phrasing.

What hasn't been mentioned though is that the 5.1 English audio is also badly screwed up. It's missing numerous sound effects, it's very attenuated, and the LFE is muted. The English audio on the previous DVD releases are of much better quality than this with the sound effects in tact. There are forum posts elsewhere with the same complaints such as on The Fandom Post and Blu-ray forums.

To make matters worse, instead of acknowledging the problems and standing behind their product, Anchor Bay are trying to hide and ignore it by deleting posts that mention it off their social media pages like their Facebook. After waiting years for a proper Blu-ray of the original version of Ghost In the Shell to come out in America and for it to get a poor release by a publisher that doesn't care is extremely disappointing.",1412294400,646,1140,4.835897435897436
6473488,5,B00L6AW2MC,"When it comes to iconic films in science fiction, there are many titles that spring to mind:  2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, STAR WARS, THE MATRIX, etc.  But when compiling these lists, many people leave out one of the most important titles of all:  GHOST IN THE SHELL.  This amazing and visionary anime burst onto the scene back in 1995, and it instantly became a fan favorite.  But in addition to eye popping animation and an intense storyline, the film presented a deeper, almost philosophical introspective on technology.  These attributes are the primary reasons the film is still a favorite today.

In case you are confused by the release dates above, this 25th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray refers to the anniversary of the manga's publication date, NOT the release of the anime version.  This threw me off at first, but I quickly figured it out.  Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the anime's release, so I'm curious to see if yet another release of the film will be made.

This Blu-ray version of GHOST IN THE SHELL is excellent.  The digital HD transfer and 5.1 surround sound really add to the film watching experience.  The voiceover is pretty crisp, and I like the actors chosen to voice the characters.  This is truly the version of the film that films have been waiting for.

My sole complaint about the 25th Anniversary Edition is there are no special features at all on the disc.  There is a booklet inside the case that contains a few nifty extras, including an interview with director Mamoru Oshii and a couple of essays, however it's not satisfying.  I hope a future edition of the film is released that has special features; a film this epic certainly deserves them.

But even so, GHOST IN THE SHELL: 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION on Blu-ray is a huge win for me, and I recommend getting a copy of it as soon as possible.  Even if you've never seen the film before, this is your chance to watch it like it was intended to be seen:  in all of its HD glory.  It is available now.",1412121600,5,1993,4.576271186440678
6473489,5,B00L6AW2MC,This Blu-ray is Incredibly Awesome!  Very high video quality.  Beautiful to watch.  Classic anime cyberpunk.,1411689600,2,108,6.066666666666666
6473490,4,B00L6AW2MC,"Like many other anime/cyberpunk/action-epic/virtual-existential fans, I consider the original GHOST IN THE SHELL film to be the zenith. Of course it stands on the shoulders of other cyberpunk novel and film apogees, but as an aggregate of the genre, GITS changed everything. But this release has a few issues for me~

First off: 25th anniversary? I may be wrong, but I recall the film coming out in 1995. So that leads me to think they are celebrating the anniversary of the manga -by Shirow Masamune- release back in 1989. If we are going to celebrate the concept's initiation, then why not have more manga-related content in the blu ray's special features or in the booklet within the blu ray's case? Why not a few sample pages of the original artwork?

Another issue: subtitles. Like a few others, I noticed some slight issues regarding gender at times. I will point out, it's in regards to hacker characters, who later on we learn that the section 9 and section 6 team-members never really know the exact gender of the hackers and give them 'male' code-names (although this issue was with calling a male a female). But this is just my desperate attempt to find an excuse to keep this poorly managed release. There are some spots where the subtitles are updated from previous GITS releases (i.e. - the gun used by Togusa), but to still have a few mistakes can bother fans who've seen the film enough they could recite the entire dialogue (and probably will, don't tempt them! Your sanity has been warned...)

Some positive: the graphic transfer is brilliant. Many scenes stand out so well due to their enhancement. Which seems impossible, considering when the film was released, it already looked decades ahead of its time. I'm so glad to see the effort the producer's put in to give the visuals the credit they deserve.

Music: Kenji Kawai's score still sounds brilliant, and the Eng. dub carries the Brian Eno/U2 ending (which I always preferred, considering the Japanese ending is just the opening played again. A slight industrial change was welcomed, in my opinion!)

...but what am I do to with this release? Should I Keep it? Stop others from buying it? Ignore the slight errors and celebrate this masterpiece's birth? I already have the film on multiple formats, but the visual quality here is breath-taking. Could I play the previous DVDs audio remotely while viewing the current blu ray production? Would I have become a byproduct of the GITS universe at that point to be so wired and virtual just to view one picture, albeit, the most stellar picture in my geeky heart??? The most we can do is write reviews. Inform the producers of what they truly excelled at (picture quality! Seeing the puppet master on the cover was a nice change, too!) and what they could of improved on (subtitle issues of course, and maybe just a bit more special features, considering it's the anniversary).",1411603200,90,2897,4.809236947791165

It looked good on my 23 inch 1080p IPS glossy monitor playing from my PS3 with some better quality settings ticked regarding color. It has the original english dub in 5.1 and the Japanese in 2.0. I watched the dub since I personally like it and wanted to see how the 5.1 was. Apparently the subtitles have some minor typos like calling a character a ""She"" at one point instead of ""He"". It has no extras of any kind other than a booklet. Looking at the book. It looks like it has an interview with Oshi, a section on the world of Ghost in the shell, and talking about the impact the film had. Haven't read it yet but was looking at the chapter names. It's just the film with a scene select, options menu for subs and language and a play option.

It is the original cut and not 2.0 and it does not have 2.0 has an option to watch. It looked good like I said though. It was never too dark or anything. It did not go to the edges of my screen and I'm not sure why that is. It was barely off the edges on all sides. I'm guessing they couldn't make it true 1080p but it certainly looks good. I'm really not an expert on this though. Maybe it was my PS3 or monitor size. It wasn't noticeable at all.

Also, America does not get the steelbook case. I wish they would have at least put a trailer as an extra or something. I suppose if it was transferring extras or focusing on the quality of the movie's transfer I would say to focus on the transfer quality.",1411430400,21,1496,4.102389078498294
