7902570,5,B000003K7T,"Episode title: Improbable Cause
Teleplay by: Ren&eacute; Echevarria
Story by: Robert Lederman & David R. Long
Just when the third season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine appeared to be full of potential unused, it shocked by tying the continuing aspects of the season into one neat baggage by the way of a two episode long story.
""Improbable Cause"" is the first one of these episodes, and noticably different from ""The Die Is Cast"", the latter and equally succeeded episode.
It all begins as Garak's shop is mysteriously burned to the ground by a bomb. This leads to a dark and fascinating investigation by Odo, who eventually manages to connect the explosion of Garak's shop to a much more complex scheme within the Cardassian political structure.
The episode progresses with subtle, even modest scenes, but conveys a much more dramatic substance on a deeper level. Garak has finally a meaning, and Odo's developement is been given a new direction.
It's amazing how such a short episode, with minimal dramatical twist can have so much substance and developement in it. It's dark exploration of the characters and their lives is extraordinarily incorporated to the episode, so that it's almost impossible to notice it.
The whole episode, in fact, is so subtle in it's ways of telling what it needs to say, that it takes countless of times to see it before it truly opens up.
A true masterpiece of writing.",1013731200,3,1402,4.870292887029288

Odo and  Garak take a Runabout and go deep inside Cardassian space where they find  evidence of Romulan involvement. It becomes apparent that Garak's  death-threat is just a small piece of a bigger puzzle as a fleet of  Cardassian ships decloak. It seems the Romulan's and Cardassian's are  preparing an attack force but who is the target?",966643200,3,554,4.840425531914893
7902572,5,B000003K7T,"DS9's 3rd season was probably its worst and yet it still managed to produce one of the best double episodes ever made.  This first installment was marginally the stonger of the two with a totally faultless hour - don't  expect extravagent SFX - DS9 sticks to its now famous character driven  shows with unparalelled flair.  It also stands the  test of time,  showcasing the qualities of the character of Elim Garak and revealing some  of the master plan the writers had install for him.",950659200,5,486,4.714285714285714
