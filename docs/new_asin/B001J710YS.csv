3652509,1,B001J710YS,"How do these movies keep being made you ask...oh thats right because of a younger generation who have never even heard of 'airplane' or 'The Naked Gun', and presume this is spoof comedy. I have seen this vile garbage but I never gave the studio the money COUGH! COUGH!, if you know what I mean. This does not even deserve the title ""movie"" , as it is a 90 min cash cow of pure torture. These horrific spoofs must be stopped NOW!!!! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.
You will like this movie if:
A) Your very young [...] and have a no real knowledge of what a great comedy film is and laugh at every lame pop culture reference in this  , I can understand that.
B) You have a very special mental condition...",1229472000,13,709,4.175182481751825
3652510,1,B001J710YS,"INGREDIENTS:
2nd rate actors and comedians
Endless sex jokes
Unsubtle humor
Dumbed down Slapstick
Movies that aren't disaster flicks
Cliche'd jokes everyone's tired of hearing
Two talentless directors
A script full of all of the above

DIRECTIONS:

1. Take the two talentless directors and give them the aforementioned script.

2. Then, put in endless sex jokes and pop culture refrences.

3. Have lame jokes, such as Iron Man getting hit by a cow.

4. Hire a bunch of second rate comedians and actors to play the characters.

5. Don't reshoot any scenes. Rush it as fast as you can so that you can get that paycheck.

6. Release it into theaters and watch MTV kids flock.

3652511,1,B001J710YS,"Once again that talentless duo that is Selzer and Friedberg show that they can sink lower than Meet The Spartans with this steaming waste of celluloid. I thought that Meet The Spartans scraped the barrel when it came to laughs but this cinematic abortion breaks through the bottom of the barrel to scrape the ground the barrel is on to get laughs and it still fails!

These two chuckleheads still have the same bad habit of explaining the jokes to you as if you were retarded(if you liked this movie chances are you probably are). Examples: ""Its an inconvenient truth, its global warming"", ""Come here you Kung fu Panda"", "" I know because I saw Indiana Jones and The Kingdom Of the Crystal Skull"", ""Let Me get my Get Smart phone"", "" I thought I'd cheer you up with a high school musical"", What is this enchanted place"". Sheer genius.

You know for a movie titled Disaster movie, you would think that they'd be spoofing movies like Twister, Dante's Peak, Volcano, The Day After Tomorrow right? WRONG. The camera shakes a couple of times, You see some cheesy plastic asteroids, a couple of cows floating around and a very crummy CGI tornado. The movie targets films like Juno, Alvin and The Chipmunks, Superbad, High School Musical, Step Up, Enchanted, The Incredible Hulk, Kung Fu Panda, The Dark Knight and a slew of other summer blockbuster flicks including Hancock. Now tell me, what do these movies have to do with disaster movies? Nothing.

Nobody in this movie does anything that resembles acting and its safe to say that this ""movie"" is 100% laugh free. None of the ""jokes"" work and they just drag on for minutes at a time. Seltzer and Freidberg are unfunny hacks that killed a once funny genre with their grave dead brand of humor. If you want a good parody stick with Scary Movie(the first one), Top Secret, Johnny Dangerously, Airplane, Not Another Teen Movie, Mafia!, Baseketball, Hot Shots(part one and Part Deux), The Naked Gun Series, Dont Be A Menace, Hollywood Shuffle, Spaced Invaders, CB4, Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles, Dead Men Dont Wear Plaid, Last Action Hero(yeah, I said it), Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Duck Soup  and every other spoof that came before the advent of Scary Movie 2. Disaster Movie is complete and utter garbage that even those brainless yokels that come on Jerry Springer wouldn't find funny(yes, its THAT bad). Do not waste another dollar on these idiotic circus clowns (Seltzer and Freidberg)and their lame parodies.
Parody is dead and Aaron Seltzer and Jason Freidberg are the undertakers.

3652512,4,B001J710YS,"Ok, so I know this movie will be getting a lot of slack because it's a spoof film, and people are way too critical. If you like the Scary Movies series, don't expect it to be as good... expect to laugh, but not in a wetting your pants way. I saw this is theaters, and I loved it. Sure, there are dull moments, but anyone that likes the Mad TV crew will like this. They take on Hanna Montana, Juno, Alvin and the Chipmunks...... it's great.

This film is the black plague of movie's. Fortunately, people seem to have gotten the idea that F&S are horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE filmakers, as this movie was a financial failure of epic proportions, was universally critically panned, and is currently #1 on the internet movie database all time worst films list(and it doesnt look like its moving any time soon).

3652515,5,B001J710YS,"As I've said before, you need to have a great sense of humor in order to appreciate and like these types of movies! If you hate these movies, then stop reading my awesome review right now! I really liked Disaster Movie and thought it was just as good as Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans! They make fun of a lot of stuff like 10,000 B.C., Cloverfield, Super Sweet 16, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Sex and the City, Juno, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Enchanted, Kung Fu Panda, Superbad, The Dark Knight, and much more! Will has a dream that the world will end on August 29, 2008! As he's throwing his 'Super Duper Sweet 16' party, the disasters start happening. Will, Calvin, Lisa, and Juney escape to save Amy. Later, they find Princess Giselle. They find out that the disasters will stop if the Crystal Skull is returned to an alter, with the help of Indiana Jones. I thought it was funny when they started break-dancing and Juno was break-dancing on her pregnant belly! (Crista Flanagan was awesome as Juney, she was my favorite character!) Also, I Thought it was cool when Alvin and the Chipmunks started singing Heavy Metal music! Another part I liked was when they were making fun of Superbad and the guy kept saying ""I am McLover"" over and over again! Nicole Parker, Crista Flanagan, and Ike Barinholtz were all awesome! I highly recommend DISASTER MOVIE!!!",1225756800,8,1369,4.661157024793388
3652516,1,B001J710YS,"In one sense, ""Disaster Movie"" is accurately titled. This movie is a disaster of extraordinary magnitude, a parody that doesn't have a single funny or even amusing moment to fall back on. It would not be enough to say that it's bad; it's incompetent at a level I've rarely seen, failing to hold itself together even as a plotless series of comedic vignettes. In another sense, it's not accurately titled at all. Actual disaster movies like ""Earthquake"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""Independence Day"" were pushed aside in favor of films that are anything but disaster movies, like ""Juno"" and ""Enchanted"" and ""10,000 B.C."" and the latest ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Sex and the City"" (okay, maybe that last one qualifies). This is the third parody film of 2008, the first two being ""Meet the Spartans"" and ""Superhero Movie."" The first one made me laugh. I didn't recommend the second one, but I still found it somewhat amusing. With ""Disaster Movie,"" I don't think anyone was even trying.

How fast do they make these movies, anyway? Many of the films parodied in ""Disaster Movie""--such as ""Hancock,"" ""Wanted,"" ""Hellboy II,"" ""Iron Man,"" ""The Love Guru,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan""--were released only months ago. Did Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer strike deals to get first cracks at new screenplays? Or did they wrap principle photography a week before release and spend the weekend editing? I wouldn't be surprised if it was the latter, considering the skill employed by the filmmakers. At times, it actually seemed as if there wasn't a screenplay at all, that the actors were allowed to just act silly until they tuckered themselves out. Every gag is a needlessly prolonged ordeal. Example: after a meteor falls on a Hannah Montana look-a-like, her five-minute death scene becomes a litany of obvious jokes, most of which are about buying her albums and how kids are too dumb to realize that she and Miley Cirus are the same person. This is funny?

Another example: early in the film, we see an elaborate dance sequence that makes fun of ""High School Musical."" It goes on so long yet doesn't have a single laughable moment in it, not even when look-a-likes of Zac Efron and Jessica Simpson make appearances. It doesn't help that, throughout that entire party scene, we get a litany of references that just don't go together, such as a Calvin Klein underwear model and Anton Chigurh from ""No Country for Old Men"" and Dr. Phil. The mindlessness of these moments paves the way for a scene midway through the film, in which demonic puppet versions of Alvin and the Chipmunks attack the four main characters in an abandoned building. Why do they attack? Why does anyone do anything this film? In successful parodies, the humor and the story exist harmoniously; here, it seemed the filmmakers just strung together a series of long-winded gags, hoping a story could be formed from them. It didn't happen. Of course, it doesn't help that even the ideas behind each gag weren't all that funny to begin with.

The plot, if you can even call it that, is so inconsequential that it's barely worth mentioning. A young man named Will (Matt Lanter) awakens from a dream in which a saber-toothed version of Amy Winehouse describes the end of the world. Immediately afterwards, Will breaks up with his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), who works at the museum. This is bad because on that particular day, Will is celebrating his Sweet Sixteen (odd, considering he's both twenty-five and a guy). In the middle of the festivities, the news reports that meteors are pummeling the city. Hoping to save Amy, Will, his friend Calvin (Gary ""G Thang"" Johnson), and a needlessly witty version of Juno named Juney (Crista Flanagan) make their way to the museum. On the way, they meet the Enchanted Princess (Nicole Parker), who arrives out of the sewer wearing a beautiful blue and white gown. Unlike Giselle from Disney's ""Enchanted,"" this princess is not a princess at all; by her own admission, she's just a crazy homeless girl. I could describe it further, but really, what's the point? ""Disaster Movie"" is one of the year's worst films, a parody that isn't funny in any sense of the word. It's not that it's offensive or vulgar or excessive--it just doesn't work on any cinematic level, not acting, not structure, not development, and certainly not humor.

The day I saw it, I listened to a small group teenage boys that sat a few rows behind me. They audibly reacted to the trailers, but they made not a noise during the actual film. They didn't even stay the entire time. I probably should have followed their lead. I knew ""Disaster Movie"" was a lost cause the instant I saw the first gag, in which an American Gladiator appeared in a dream sequence, one that parodied Roland Emmerich's ""10,000 B.C."" (I know everyone hated that movie, but hey, at least it didn't feature a pregnant teen spewing goo from her birth canal). What infuriates me is that movies like this take attention away from much better movies, ones we should actively be trying to see. We all want to laugh from time to time, and I'm sure Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer had the best of intentions. Unfortunately, they seem to have forgotten how comedy works. I'm not sure they even remember what comedy is.",1220918400,5,5356,4.818478260869565
3652517,1,B001J710YS,"As of right now, Disaster Movie has been voted by IMDb users as the worst movie ever.

I recall seeing some trailers for this parody-movie and thinking if that was the best they could show, it probably wasn't worth watching.  I finally got around to watching it and I found it reasonably amusing, if you keep your expectations low.

This does not just parody big disaster movies [that would cramp its style]; it also parodies action movies, family-fare films, cultural icons, and basically anything lurking in our collective subconscious that seemed like grist for comedy.  The cast is large though there are few big-names.  The plot generally involves a 20-something guy trying to rescue his girlfriend as New York City (?) is being struck by catastrophes.  There are more references in this movie than most people can possibly recognize, and part of the fun can be counting how many you can find.  Jessica Simpson, Ashton Kutcher, Justin Timberlake, Miley Cirus, Green Giant, Ironman, the chipmunks, Batman, Head-On!, Night At The Museum, Dr. Who, Indiana Jones are just a few examples to show the range.

The language is frequently explicit and skin is amply displayed but there is no actual nudity.  This is not sophisticated humor.  A full minute of farting early on lets the audience know this is what they can expect.  Although some people are depicted as dying, there is no significant blood and the explicit violence is no worse than in childrens cartoons.

There are several dance and song numbers and even though they are parodying things, they actually are pretty good to listen to.

My favorite scene: someone parodying Vince Vaughn dressed as Batman.  Hilarious!  Had to re-play it.
Sadly there was no gag reel.  Unless the entire movie was a gag reel.",1459641600,2,1721,4.982456140350878

3652534,1,B001J710YS,"I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, including many of the movie themed, pop culture reference-loaded parodies such as this one, and as bad as many of those films have been, I've never until now had any one of them literally cause me to experience actual physical discomfort. It was like a test of wills to see just how long I could endure the torture... and when I refer to it as ""torture,"" I'm only SLIGHTLY exaggerating, because if it should ever come about that things develop in this country where citizens start getting rounded up as political prisoners or become captives of terrorist hostage takers, I think I'd opt to be waterboarded rather than be forced to sit through inescapable viewings of this trash (and trashy) ""myoo-vee."" Not only are all the skits lame as U-No-Wear, but the idiot writers & directors seem to have had absolutely no clue that each {koff-koff} ""joke"" automatically wore out its welcome as soon as they had presented it, yet somehow they had convinced themselves that the way to make an already bad & lame joke funny or (in their minds) funnier was to keep dragging it out... and then dragging it out further... and then finally, dragging it out some more.

I've never seen ""Birdemic"" or ""The Room,"" but from what I have seen and heard about these movies, they seem to have all of the earmarks of being huge gawd-awful experiences, but I'm willing to bet that I'd actually get far more enjoyment and satisfaction from those terrible and universally panned movies than from what I had to endure sitting through this tur[d]key!

3652539,1,B001J710YS,"Normally I like bad movies.  I don't know why but it's a guilty pleasure.  But this movie was so bad that it may have turned me off from bad parody movies all together.

Most of these jokes are just rushed into the movie and they aren't very funny to begin with and it seems like they didn't bother to reshoot any of the scenes or take time to make any of them even look good.  Well unless you count the scenes with Kim Kardashian and Carmen Electra fighting.  Those scenes look very well shot and like a lot of effort went into them.  Which tells me they were counting on these scenes to make horny teenagers go see this movie in order to try and make a quick buck.

Other jokes are just quickly rushed like the lame Iron Man joke, Hulk joke and Hellboy joke.  Those costumes look like something you would get from Party City.  They look so bad that there was like no effort at all put into them to even try to make them look like the characters they are supposed to be parodying.

And let's look at the title, ""Disaster Movie.""  You'd think with a name like that they'd want to parody some disaster movies.  So if you want to do that, why would you parody Iron Man, The Hulk, Hellboy, Kung Fu Panda, Batman, Speed Racer, Hannah Montana, Hancock, Night at the Museum, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and High School Musical?  None of them have anything to do with disasters!

3652582,4,B001J710YS,"As a film overall, Disaster Movie was actually much better than I expected it to be. Of course this isn't the best film ever made by a long shot, but it is getting way too much harsh treatment and it is a lot more humorous than previous films by Friedberg and Seltzer; I enjoyed it and have watched it more than once, willingly.

First of all, this is so not as bad as some of it's predecessors. I enjoyed this a lot more than I did Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet The Spartans. Sure, a lot of the jokes are the same, but the thing with Disaster Movie is it knows the jokes are horrible and the movie is a total waste, and it makes fun of itself which in the end is funny to me! It wasn't meant to be comically gifted and witty, but just entertain with people who knew how to enjoy such films.

You knew what you were in for when you went to see the movie. I don't see why you would be expecting any different from the movies that came before this. You shouldn't have seen Disaster Movie if you hated all the others and don't like films similar to them, even though I do think this was better than any of their others I have seen. As a film itself, I found it very amusing and entertaining. There are far worse films, because even though while you're watching the movie and you know the acting is terrible and the jokes are cheesy and lame, the film doesn't try to be anything more than it is. All the others tried way too hard to please the audience, and by the time the makers got around to this movie, they knew they should stop trying to make a bad film good and just go with the flow, and in the end, I was very satisfied with how Disaster Movie turned out.

I understand why this movie could have it's blood-hungry mobs, I don't see how anyone couldn't understand that, but to be hated so badly when it is not that horrible of a film, I am actually disappointed. If you hated this film, think about all the things I said and rewatch it again. Even though at times the movie becomes unbearable, it has a lot of upsides and deserves better than the rating it has and the treatment it gets. I even believe that a lot of the people who viewed this and hated it went in watching it with no doubt in their mind that they will end up hating it and they did everything they could to make sure that they did in the outcome, which just makes me so angry. Believe it or not, I have a lot more to say, but for the people reading this who liked it, they will have already agreed with me by now, and the people who hated it, disagreed. I can't change anybody's mind about this film, they have to do that on their own, but at least I've said my piece. I liked it, and it is highly under appreciated.",1343088000,3,2691,4.09280303030303

It's never good when the name of your movie is a perfect description for your movie - with the word ""disaster"" preceding ""movie.""

Plot: A cynical pregnant teen, two friends, an enchanted princess, and a couple of others attempt to deal with the coming apocalypse and return a magic skull to its rightful place.

Pros:

1. I liked the ""17 Again,"" or maybe ""High School Musical"" dance number at the beginning.  Unfortunately, the rest of the musical numbers were awful.

2. If you look hard, there's an anti-drug and safe sex message.

3. The black sidekick has more dialogue than just, ""Damn,"" ""Expletive,"" and ""That's Whack!""

4. Not as many poop jokes as I was afraid of.

5. Eventually, it ended.

That's pretty much all I can say about this film.  Except if singing chipmunks make you feel homicidal, avoid ""Disaster Movie"" at all costs.",1321488000,,1049,4.772222222222222

This movie features characters and celebrities(not played by themselves) like Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Hannah Montana, Speed Racer, Dr. Phil, Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake, etc. This movie doesn't make any sense. It had some immature sex jokes.

I refuse to talk about the plot of this movie, because this movie sucked. If you want to know about the plot, look it up online.

It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, not just the worst movie in general, I mean one of the worst comedies ever. The parodies are ridiculous, the story was written bad and the jokes were bad and the acting was terrible even the actresses. I didn't laugh a bit throughout this movie.

It was so bad I mailed it to Lions Gate and told them I didn't think I could watch any of their movies again.

This movie left such a bad taste for Lions Gate I immediately lose interest in an otherwise interesting movie when I see it's by Lions Gate.  Don't get me wrong, I do like silly stupid humor.  I liked the ""Scary Movie"" series of movies.  They were all really stupid and yet very creative and entertaining.  This ""Disaster Movie"" however had no creativity at all.

2. THE BLATANT STUNT DOUBLES. This is something I noticed in ""Epic Movie"" (the martial arts sequence) and ""Date Movie"" (the motorcycle ride), as well as ""Disaster Movie"".  They're obvious and right in your face, yet there's no irony and clever quip behind them.  This film went all out just to show the stunt double right next to the original actor after the end of the typical dance sequence, yet the movie did nothing to make it funny outside acknowledging the stunt players.

3. JUNO'S BABY BEATING UP SARAH JESSICA PARKER. How did the baby's legs attack S.J Parker while it's still inside the womb? I get the ""Zohan"" reference just from Juno beating her up, but then the baby's legs come in and I just didn't get it.  Oh, and Juno's water broke in an exaggerated way, yet she didn't give birth after that, which ended up being a pointless scene.

4. Kim Kardashian: ""WE SAW YOUR DREAM, WILL"". How? How did she saw his dream? Was she just humoring him because she didn't believe him about the premonitions in the first place?  WTF?

5. THE PUPPET CHIPMUNKS. The most godawful-looking recreations of Alvin and the Chipmunks were singing showtunes, and then they suddenly broke into a satanic metal song. Up until the part where the chipmunks start attacking people's groins, I didn't hate this.

No ""Cloverfield"", no ""Armageddon"", no ""Volcano"", not even ""The Day After Tomorrow"".  Okay, there was one ""Day"" part where the city froze, but it was so brief I wouldn't even call it a reference; same for the tornado, and I wouldn't even call it a ""Twister"" reference.  I don't think think Friedberg/Seltzer even had the budget to do actual disaster parodies.

But hey!  Any time you can make fun of famous Hollywood movie stars, overplayed television commercials, or anything else that catches on in our American culture and becomes annoyingly popular, you can't HELP but make fun of it.

Here's some of my favorite parts of Disaster Movie.

- The scene that shows a man shooting a handgun and actually curving the bullet around a hot blondes head while the bullet travels to its target, lol

- Alvin and the Chipmunks have rabies, haha.  Actually it's just some kind of puppet version of the chipmunks- not actually the animated version from the cartoon or recently created films.

- The chipmunks go on a rampage and tear apart the main characters in the film, haha.  They even cuss!

- A fairy princess appears from the sewers!  She soon becomes a main character as she tags along for the adventure of a lifetime.

- Meteorites that fall from the sky and land on top of BOTH Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus!  Something funny happens here and you'll know what I mean when you see it.

- One of the main characters was a spoof on Ellen Page from the Juno movie.  She was dancing with her pregnant belly bouncing around, and being hilariously sarcastic in her own clever witty little way, and even some milk squirts appear in one scene, ewwww!!

- The fairy princess eats glass and laughs about it as blood drips down her chin!

- A tornado AND a severe icestorm tear through the streets as the main characters run to safety.

- Remember that film Night at the Museum?  Those characters are imitated pretty convincingly here.

What a funny movie, haha.  I loved it and I recommend all Scary Movie fans watch it as soon as possible.",1268784000,2,1858,4.536144578313253

-----------------
*Most of the movies that have come out since 2000, reguardless of genre, suck.
*It's not nearly as good as Scary Movie 1 or anything done by Kevin Smith: King of vulgar comedy.
*It's still deliciously vulgar, not like the baby-friendly tooth-rotting moral ending crapfest passing off for comedy in theaters today. Think of this movie as a necessary evil.
*If you hate today's singers & sctors, you'll enjoy watching them become victims of gay jokes or simply getting killed off in humerous fashion.
*Like ""Not Another Teen Movie"" the purpose of this spoof is to make fun of terrible movies, & some mediocre ones too.
*It's got a very memorable & quite hilarious musical ending, & there was that Chipmunk spoof...
*I was going to give this a 4 because it really needed at least 5 minutes of zombies in it. Then I remembered that in the past decade, I've only seen about 30 movies I can even tollerate & bumped this to a 5.
*It also makes fun of creepy CGI, like Alvin & the Chipmunks & Kung-Fu Panda.

The parodies were bad
A weak and poor storyline.

I am quite a fan of some satire films, particularly the Scary Movies. I'm all for slapstick humor, like Naked Gun or Hot Shots.  But this film is horrible. At least it is only about 80 minutes long - but it was the worst 80 minutes of film to ever be released.",1240444800,5,593,4.267857142857143

What the heck are Chipmunks, Hulk, Iron Man, Hell Boy, Kung fu Panda, Beowolf, Indiana Jones, American Gladiator, Jessica Simpson and so many non-disaster movie stuff doing in this pile of crap.

This movie is a disaster from the start, stupid character selection, stupid jokes and so on.  Now I think maybe the makers of this movie was thinking that the society we live in is a disaster, why do we need an natural disaster anyway?  But I doubt it.

Well, this one's no exception but it doesn't reek as much as many before it. Basically taking the structure of Cloverfield (minus the monster[?]) and throwing in a mix of cameos by Iron Man, Hulk, Batman, Jessica Simpson, Juno, Hannah Montana, and every other irritating pop-sensation of the past two years, this flix is basically what you'd expect from twenty-somethings who've never seen Airplane!. But what saves this film from viewing hell are it's two very talented female impressionists MadTV's Crista Flanagan and Nicole Parker (Parker being the ONLY saving grace of last year's mind-numbingly bad Meet The Spartans). These two ladies will cause you to at least smirk at their many (at least three each) impersonations of today's over-hyped stars, even making their versions more appealing than the real thing. Also on the disc is a ton of behind-the-scene featurettes, ranging from decent to filler, and two sing-a-longs that show just how weak the High School Musical parody lyrics actually are (thanks guys, it was funnier when I couldn't make them out). But overall the movie still relies on quick parody after parody without no coherent plot or reason for all of them to be on the same DVD. Still, I have seen worse, much worse, so for a decent rent it's worth a couple of chuckles.

DISASTER MOVIE is not as bad as the recent tepid 'disasters' MEET THE SPARTANS and EPIC MOVIE, but that's not saying much. It spoofs almost every movie released between 2007-2008 including 10,000 B.C., CLOVERDALE, JUNO, SEX AND THE CITY (a male actor plays the Sarah Jessica Parker character which is grossly hilarious), SUPERBAD, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, WANTED, HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, BRING IT ON, HANCOCK, HELLBOY, KUNG FU PANDA, THE DARK KNIGHT, IRON MAN, THE HULK, INDIANA JONES & the KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULLS, SPEED RACER, ALVIN & THE CHIPMUNKS, ENCHANTED, DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN, BEOWULF, JUMPER, NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, (even the tv commercial for HEAD ON), and the LOVE GURU. Then, pop superstars Flava Flav, Justin Timberlake, Jessica Simpson, Amy Winehouse, Michael Jackson, and Miley Cyrus are also spoofed, and the list goes on and on. The novelty in this film is that three actor/comics from the recently cancelled MAD-TV (think of the irony) tv series take up multiple roles (a'la Monty Python's Flying Circus); Crista Flanagan, Nicole Parker, and the prolific (at least in this film) Ike Barinholtz who all do a great job despite the lack of script. Also, Carmen Electra again makes her obligatory cameo which is getting tiresome. One must take this film for what it is and not expect Shakespeare, Scorsese, Brooks or even Judd Apatow. Because the film is trying to spoof every movie in sight, it becomes episodic and the humor is intermittent. Some of the gross-out jokes are just plain gross (especially with the 'JUNO' character) and the opening sequence spoofing 10,000 B.C. seems to go on forever without any point. The plot is as thin as paper (a thinly-veiled CLOVERDALE plot), and with any spoof film of this nature a lot of the jokes are going to be hit-and-miss and come at you one by one like machine gun fire. Put the film on as background noise while your surfing the net... you'll look up once in a while to get a couple of laughs and get a glance of some ""eye-candy"" in the form of actresses and tv personalities Vanessa Minnillo and Kim Kardashian. However, the finale when all the different spoofed characters sing (in succession) of who-is-[sleeping]-with-who,(spoofing Sarah Silverman's ""I'm ****ing Matt Damon"" comedy song) is actually pretty hilarious.

The main group of losers at first try and get out of the city and run into all kinds of the worst of the most recent pop culture sort of things, i.e. Hannah Montannah, Sex and the City girls...etc. Then they get the call that the lead character's girlfriend is stuck at a museum and so they head back to rescue her. The movie starts out fairly bad. But if you can hang on until the Enchanted Princess shows up things get noticeably funnier. I can't imagine anybody actually purchasing this on DVD, even when it's only $4 in a bargain bin. But it's worth at least a cheap red box $1 rental to see it. It's almost worth a $1 just to see the final scene (The I'm dating somebody else song). I thought that was, for better or worse, by far the funniest part of the movie.

This movie doesn't even spoof it is referencing stuff like Pop Culture and got ideas from trailers that Friedberg and Seltzer watched then get the ideas on a cocktail napkin. The jokes are truly unfunny yet very groan inducing with forehead slapping gags that will make you gag literally with tasteless vulger jokes. And i thought ""Hobgoblins"" and ""Meet The Spartans"" were bad but this one blows them away in terms of awfulness with terrible acting, cheap special effects and it looks like it was filmed in a cardboard box, avoid this movie like the plague.

Then I must say that the people who hate these movies so much are ridicoulous. I'm sorry, but Airplane is barely funny at all. When the best joke in a film is about a deflating blow up pilot, it's not a funny spoof.
Secondly, the one thing americans can do right is make movies, not spend a dollar on something with really bad acting and no plot, but instead make movies that allows a spoof to exist, because they take the best movies of the year and annihilate them.
And also sorry to break it, but art dramas also suck...boring, stupid, and full of bad people who were supposed to care about.

My only complaint about Disaster Movie is that there wasn't enough Batman: The Dark Knight. There should be a spoof movie dedicated to taking on Batman in general, like Superhero Movie did to Spiderman.

Overall you've got some pretty funny things happening in this movie, from the whole thing with the cow from twister crushing mostly the superhero characters and the fact Hannah Montana and High School Musical (One of the worst movies of all time) are spoofed, something long coming.
And making fun of Amy Winehouse was great.
These movies would not be nearly as good without cultural references. Your telling me anyone would care about Michael Moore's movies if they weren't about American situations in America? Please, hypocricy as it's best.

Five stars for this hilarious spoof, thought I think Meet The Spartans (What did the oracle say? The ending of sopranos was most dissapointing, that film) was the best from this duos efforts with Epic Movie second.",1231632000,4,1615,4.719858156028369
3652641,1,B001J710YS,"Yup, this movie sucks!  That's all the time I'm going to waste on it!  That is all the people need to know!",1231632000,,107,3.8181818181818183
3652642,1,B001J710YS,"I thought Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, responsible for ""Date Movie,"" ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans,"" might finally show something different in ""Disaster Movie."" Well, surely they did show something different, but not in the way I had expected.

For the film is not just unfunny; it is painful. ""Disaster Movie"" looks terribly cheap and amateurish. Clearly the ""filmmakers"" didn't spend enough money on production. The film opens with the ""10,000 B.C."" spoof (no, it was ""10,001 B.C."") and ""American Gladiators"" parody, which I imagine was shot around their neighbor's backyard. The ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" are hand puppets with someone hiding behind them. I don't care the lack of the story (which is largely based on ""Cloverfield""), but watching these unknown actors fighting against these stuffed animals made me terribly sad.

But cheap production is not the only reason for the film's disastrous result. Pop culture is always the easiest target for parody, I know, but ""Disaster Movie"" does not make even the laziest effort to make them funny when it sends up the blockbuster films from Hollywood's major studio. (They are mainly those released in 2008. See the poster and you know what you will see.) The famous ""curve the bullet"" scene from ""Wanted"" is turned into a predictable joke, which is unfunny and even off-putting.

I enjoyed the ""Scary Movie"" franchise. They were silly, and would never be called classic comedies in the future, but still fun. And I really like Anna Faris. She has a comedic talent that single-handedly raises any production one notch higher, but none of the actors in ""Disaster Movie"" shows one. But I should not blame the cast for that (including Carmen Electra and Kim Kardashian in a wresting ring). They had no chance from the beginning with the script that still recycles tired gags and lame pop culture references.",1231545600,6,1868,5.038834951456311
3652643,1,B001J710YS,"I watched this movie hoping that it would contain even a small percentage of laughs, even though Epic Movie cured me of that hope. Somewhere along the line parody & satire films went from cleverly thought out jokes & slapstick to fart jokes that aren't even funny to a first grader. Calling this film a parody or even a comedy would be doing the better films in the genre a disservice.

The plot, you say? What of the plot? There is one, but one that is stretched so thin you could use it as glass in a window. The focus of the movie mainly surrounds the ""writers"" (who obviously aren't chosen for their merit) throwing in one pop culture reference after another. I can even imagine how the brainstorming session went:

Writer 1: ""Hey, the Chipmunks did really well in the box office. Let's include them. Oh, and let's throw in Juno, Enchanted, & Batman.""

Writer 2: ""Those aren't disaster movies. So what type of jokes are we going to write for these... 'disaster' movies?""

Writer 1: ""We're going to make Giselle a man! And we'll turn the Chipmunks rabid! Everyone else will just walk around being themselves!""

Writer 2:  ""Gay jokes? Fart jokes? Trying to pass off cameos as jokes? Come on guys, this blows and we know it.""

Producer: ""Throw out Writer 2! He's making far too much sense!""

The only reason I could possibly imagine anyone watching & enjoying this movie is because they're either a pre-adolsescent boy who likes watching boobs (which there are a lot of) and hasn't yet discovered that there are better films out there. Or someone who has an IQ under 100 or has had recent head trauma. In any case this is a film to avoid at all costs.  I love parody movies & I'm willing to put up with some blue humor in films, but this goes beyond what is bad & lame in movies. The ""_____ Movie"" efforts of Friedberg & Seltzer have officially killed the parody/satire movie genre & are now what any hopefull young filmmaker should look to as a ""what not to do"" guide to comedy.",1231545600,9,1980,4.477777777777778

3652645,1,B001J710YS,"Utter Rubbish - what more can you say... Why even waste the resources of putting this on DVD? Seems to me anyone who gives this more than 1 star has to either be about 10 years old, or have an IQ that's less than the rating they gave, or just raving nuts! There is nothing at all intelligent or humorous or even well done, just clichd and formulaic one-liners and as another review said constant endless cheap sex jokes... It really says a lot about the state of the audience in the USA that movies like this are actually financially successful enough to keep producers interested in spawning still more repetitive variants year after year... As mentioned Airplane, Naked Gun, Sledge Hammer, etc, did this reasonably well in their times, but in the last decade the UK has stolen the crown and it seems the USA just can't produce anything that even resembles a quality spoof, at least not since the mid-90's anyway.",1231372800,6,914,4.613496932515337
3652646,5,B001J710YS,"Disaster Movie -- thoughts when trailer released -- ""Wow! This looks really stupid, I got to see it!"" So I went to go see Disaster Movie in the theater about three days after the release in the theaters. There's a pretty good crowd, I expected for me to be the only person in the theater. It was a couple of little kids w/ parents in the front row and some old ladies.  So about 12 people in the theater (for Disaster Movie that's a good crowd). I sat in the back row. As I watched the movie, I wasn't really fond of the ""Wolf"" parody as the movie's intro beginning. I did like the beginning, where it shows the earth and then shows 'Disaster Movie', and the score was pretty good for this movie. In the end, I did enjoy it, maybe because the older ladies where crazy and would applaud and scream/laughing, they were probably 60 or 70 btw. I purchased this movie the week it came out for $19.99 and I still enjoy watching the movie. Kim Kardashian is in it and I love the Kardashians.

8312093,5,B001J710YS,"I watched this with my DD client. I told him you can watch something loud, or you can watch something dumb, but you can't watch something loud AND dumb. He decided to put this movie on. At first I told him that this was BOTH loud and dumb, but, after a few minutes I was watching it.

Seriously, when the Disney like character broke out in song I didn't know whether to yell or laugh. And when Hulk showed up and lost his shorts (it was bound to happen) I actually laughed. Minutes later when the Chipmunks (who my client KNOWS I hate) came on and started singing Death Metal (yes, the Chipmunks appear and sing Death Freaking Metal!) I was sold. It was hilarious to watch the Chipmunks attack the people, foaming at the mouth, biting crotches, swearing at people. We both laughed and laughed.

When there was a breakdancing scene and a pregnant woman started dancing I told my client it would be hilarious if she did a headspin on her very pregnant belly. SURE ENOUGH she started doing it right after it.

This is not A Beautiful Mind, and it doesn't have to be. It was goofy and funny and surprised me a bunch of times. My DD client loved it too.",1517356800,,1148,4.330232558139535
8312094,1,B001J710YS,"This is one of the most unbearable movies I have ever sat throughand I love bad movies. It fully deserves the one star rating solely because there is no lower option. I quickly wondered why Apple allowed its products to be placed in the film, and as my title says, I was almost immediately wondering if this was the worst thing I had ever seen (and I've seen ""American Flatulators""). I don't mean that in a ""so bad it's good"" way like ""Manos The Hands of Fate"" or ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". I mean in an irritating, pointless, time-wasting way. I have no doubt that this movie would be very popular with a very narrow demographic of teenage boys, but anyone else must exercise extreme caution when contemplating a viewing of this.

The film has a tiny seed of a plot about killer asteroids and earthquakes attempting to justify the title as a spoof of disaster movies, but it's mostly an unending series of tangentially related scenes of hormonal teen (or twenty-something) angst and imitation celebrity cameos. Will (Matt Lanter) is the 25-year old protagonist who is having a Sweet 16 party because he never had one. Just...what? Never mind, accept the premise and move on. After the imitation Flava Flav gets naked (not that you asked, but that clock is very concealing), we get to see Kim Kardashian (why is she famous again?) and Carmen Electra wrestling. That's the problem: the entire film is bits and pieces, most of which are themselves unfunny, jammed into an incoherent narrative where everything is stilted and forced, and nothing is genuinely funny. The filmmakers also make an all too common error in this genre, confusing random stupid violence and pointless cursing with humor.

After unfunny impersonations of Dr. Phil and Amy Winehouse, I wondered how much lower it could go. Plenty, as it turns out: Speed Racer shows up to be pointlessly killed with zero payoff, and The Chipmunks show up and sing. I'm not even going to explain the ludicrous endpoint of that subplot. (If you must know, The Chipmunks are killer zombies.) Among the few good things going for the film, an asteroid falls on Hannah Montana, which is a noble cause for the film to get behind, though it rapidly devolves into the worst scene I may have ever seen involving a fight with a very pregnant girl in a ""Got Milk?"" t-shirt. After we learn that global warming is responsible for all of this somehow (ponder), there's a teleportation subplot that materializes out of nowhere and in a nod to ""Twister"" a cow falls from the sky. There's even an ear poop joke. (Don't ask.)

Although you'd probably think having your nose in a mousetrap would wake you up, we finally progress to a nude man fighting outside the ""Hall of African Mammals"". To my knowledge no pangolins were harmed in the making of this movie. You might be wondering what any of this has to do with anything, and that'd be a valid question. Unfortunately though you're in for disappointment, as the grand finale musical number resolves and clarifies nothing and it is fingernails-on-a-blackboard irritating. The entire film is simply pointless and painful to endure.

The DVD comes with extras, including a commentary track, but there was zero chance I would ever sit through this again to watch it. ""G-Thang's Tour"" is probably the best of the (too) many extras, but like everything else on the DVD, you can feel free to skip it.",1511481600,2,3381,4.744897959183674
