7743950,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"The Nice Guys from writer/director Shane Black plays out like the spiritual successor to 2005s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, only this time with Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as the mismatched duo of the buddy cop story. While it doesnt hit the same consistent high notes of that previous effort, the sharp writing and charismatic lead still make the movie another solid entry in the genre.

Both characters are introduced in the midst of their respective jobs. Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a muscleman for hire, essentially just going around punching guys lights out for a few bucks. His current client is a young woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who seems to have some very shady characters after her. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a low level P.I. who, when not too busy drinking, does a few odd jobs that come his way. His current gig puts him on the trail of Amelia, which in turn leads to him having his left arm broken by Healy.

What becomes very clear very early on is the commanding chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. While Russell Crowe is very much the straight man to Ryan Goslings mostly drunken antics, they share a very quick rapport, both in terms of the dialogue and physically. Ryan Gosling gives an especially natural comedic performance as an almost worthless detective who literally stumbles into clues more than he actually seems able to discover. The two of them play off each other very well and that does a lot of the heavy lifting as far as the narrative goes, since like any good noir the story is convoluted. Their interactions carry much of the films plot as they stumble around and often fail to do what they set out to do.

By setting the story in 1977 LA, the movie gets to play around with the time and the setting without drawing too much attention to itself. The bulk of the mystery revolves around a group of people involved in a porn film (with a political message, mind you) getting killed left and right. Its got a complex conspiracy that seems to go all the way to the top, and the leads are barely competent enough to keep up.

Much like any Shane Black movie, the heroes are wonderfully flawed and always not quite the right people for the job. Healy is a professional thug with a hidden desire to be better than he is. Holland is an alcoholic widower and single father who continues to get his daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) involved in his cases and as a result some seriously dangerous situations. A kid involved in this kind of story might seem like a red flag, especially if the actors no good, but thats not too big an issue here. Shane Black, being a man of the 80s action flicks, like a bit of cheese in his movies. It works for the most part and its believable that Holly would constantly have to look out for and clean up after her dad. All together they three of them are an odd grouping, but the chemistry between the leads make their partnership work in a convincing way, given the circumstances.

Theres some very funny, very sharp dialogue as you might come to expect from a Shane Black film, but it never gets quite as funny as you expect. There are a handful of great comedic scenes, but for the most part it hovers between a comedy and a straight neo-noir. For all the humor of the two protagonists, they still seem to live in a world with real criminals and real violence. In this sense, The Nice Guys feels right at home amongst other old school buddy cop movies of the 1980s, which were all unapologetically R rated and reveled in violence, nudity, and strong language.

As a throwback to the hard R buddy cop films, the likes of which they rarely make anymore, The Nice Guys hits in all the ways it needs to. Its not too groundbreaking or anything particularly new from Shane Black, but it still manages to mold a fun story around likeable characters.",1464134400,14,3835,4.526695526695526
7743951,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"Let's get one thing out of the way right away: ""The Nice Guys"" is funny. Like stupidly funny, possibly the funniest movie of the year. That latter point might be a bit of a surprise to some, but it probably shouldn't be. As the purveyor of such bad boy buddy flicks as ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", ""The Last Boy Scout"", ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"", and even ""Iron Man 3"" (yep, that counts), Shane Black is the best at mixing laughs with testosterone-fueled action. He's had some legendary duos to work with, as well, and while we'll always remember Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, it's time to start singing the praises of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, who are just as good.

Admit it, the first time you saw Gosling with that '70s mustache sitting alongside a bruising Crowe it made you chuckle. Well, that's pretty much how the entire movie is. The pairing is so unlikely that just seeing them together is funny, but they also play off one another so well that it takes ""The Nice Guys"" soaring to unexpected comic heights. The film is set in 1977 Los Angeles, Black's preferred version of the city since it's like something ripped out of a classic film noir. Dangerous dames, smog, polyester suits, and a bustling porn industry have consumed Black's idea of Hollywood, resembling aesthetically Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Inherent Vice"". But the tones are completely different; ""The Nice Guys"" is unabashedly silly, even as the body count starts to stack up.

Gosling plays down 'n out private instigator Holland March, who is struggling with the recent death of his wife, and the burden of caring for his whip-smart daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice). She's basically holding things together while her dad often finds himself waking up fully-clothed in the bathtub. Basically, he's a walking calamity; a well-meaning calamity but one nonetheless. Crowe is street-level enforcer Jackson Healy, a tough guy who is like the low-rent version of The Equalizer. He beats up people for cash, although he has a certain code of honor to him. If there's a creepy old guy hitting on high school girls, Jackson will set him straight one way or another. He's nice enough to knock on the door before pounding your face in. In the case of his first encounter with Holland, he's also nice enough to have some pleasant conversation, as well.

The two are brought into one another's orbit after a porn star's car goes crashing through a family's home, killing the actress inside. Typical of Black's films, it's a scene both shocking in its brutality and laughably insane in the details. The young boy who witnesses it is holding a stroke magazine with the actress in it, only to find her splayed out after the crash with her bulging fake breasts staring up at him. This leads to Holland being hired by a confused elderly woman to find her missing niece, while Jackson has been hired to ward off any pursuers.

Ultimately, the pretzel-like connections that make up the central mystery don't matter much. It's all just an excuse to get Jackson and Holland together, which is what we really want to see. Eventually they decide to work together once things get murky, and for these two dim bulbs things stay that way for most of the film. But that's also when it's best, because Gosling and Crowe have a goofball chemistry that clicks instantly. Gosling stumbles around, falling off of things, shrieking at the sight of his own blood, and making inane observations. Crowe's humor is also of a physical nature, but it involves beating hapless foes into a bloody pulp. Together, along with scene-stealer Rice, they form an unlikely family unit that is both ridiculous and charming. The film may be called ""The Nice Guys"" but Jackson and Holland are hardly the types who should be judging anybody given their violent professions, and yet some of the best gags find them doing just that. A student protest over air pollution finds the duo not-so-quietly questioning their motives, and they are always trying to impart some half-baked pearl of wisdom on Holly, who turns out to be much brighter than either man.

At just over two hours it's tough for Black and co-writer Anthony Bagarozzi to keep up the pace, and eventually the film becomes more of a standard procedural, broken up by the occasional shootout. That said; the finale is a cacophony of deadly comic mishaps that shows Black's growth as a filmmaker. Bullets fly, bodies fall from staggering heights, fires burn, all while Holland scrambles after a getaway film reel. The sheer chaos of it all is exactly what makes ""The Nice Guys"" such a fun ride, one with obvious sequel potential if Black, Gosling, and Crowe are willing. Let's hope they are.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nice-Guys-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-HD-Ultraviolet-Combo-Pack/dp/B01F5ZY596/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nice Guys (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD Ultraviolet Combo Pack)</a>",1463788800,10,4931,5.008536585365854
7743952,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"""The Nice Guys"" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a couple of private eyes looking for a missing girl. As the movie opens (to the tune of ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone""), we are reminded that it is ""Los Angeles, California, 1977"". Before we know what hit us, a car comes flying around the corner, crashing into a house and killing its driver, whom we later learn is Misty Mountains, an adult film star. We then get introduced to Holland March, a private eye who is down on his luck, and separately also to Jackson Healy, the guy you call on ""to bring a message"". It's not long bedore Healy is hired to ""bring a message"" to March. At that point we're a good 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Shane Black, who previously brought us Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3, among many others. Here Black takes us back to the golden era of police and private eyes dramas and film noir, but with a never missing smile (or is that smirk) on his face.  Second, don't worry about the insanely complicated story line, in which I got lost in no time. Instead, enjoy this movie for the many outstanding performances: Ryan Gosling (as March) brings comedy to the screen like I've never seen him do before (the 'bathroom' scene is destined to become a classic). Russell Crowe (as Healy) plays it rough and gruff, the perfect counterpart to Gosling's role (the ying and the yang), so in that respect, this is a great ""buddy"" movie. But with all due respect to Gosling and Crowe, the movie is stolen by newcomer Angourie Rice, who plays Merch's 13 yr. old daughter Holly. She seems like is was born to play in movies, that's how natural she comes across. Surely this is only the beginning of a long career for this young lady. Kudos also to the set designers, who did an outstanding job recreating what 1977 looked like (the ""Jaws 2"" poster, Tower Records, etc. ), And last but not least, there is an overabundance of outstanding music from that era featured throughout the movie, from the opening sounds of The Temptations' ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" to when Al Green's outstanding ""Love and Happiness"" plays over the movie's end credits.

The movie opened nationwide this weekend. Having seen the trailer a number of times, I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but nowhere close to sold out). If you are in the mood for a 70s-era crime and buddy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Nice Guys"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1463788800,2,2727,4.538617886178862
7743953,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"I walked into this movie thinking that it was going to be really good or really bad. Luckily, it was the former.

 In ""The Nice Guys,"" a send-up of detective/buddy movies, Russell Crowe gets to do a lot of punching, as a L.A. private investigator in the late seventies. He and co-star, Ryan Gosling, also get to fall out of things a lot, such as balconies, into things (swimming pools) and onto things (speeding cars), as they navigate their way through this movie. It's supposed (I think) to be tongue-in-cheek, like say, ""Spy,"" or ""Kingsman: The Secret Service.""

The year is 1977, meaning lines at the gas station rival those at Disneyland, hits like ""Horse With No Name,"" and ""The Pina Colada,"" song are on the jukebox, and everyone is wearing funky clothes, hairdos and facial hair. Smog alerts caution the inhabitants of L.A. to avoid going outside until 6 p.m., but Russell and Ryan are busy earning a living, even if somewhat ineptly (during one undercover investigation, Ryan almost bleeds to death). Russell is divorced, while Ryan is tragically widowed with a precocious teen daughter (Anjourie Rice). Both seek refuge in drinking, smoking and cynicism, although of course, things are about to change. When Russell is hired by a young woman (Margaret Qualley) to discourage a stalker, he winds up crossing paths with Ryan and eventually, they team up because they realize their cases have things in common. When Amelia disappears, the two and the precocious Anjourie, head out in search of her. Meanwhile, the mother of a character we meet briefly at the movie's start, also contacts the two detectives, which leads to a subplot about the auto industry - which eventually coincides with one about a supposedly dead porn star and the movie she was recently making. When everyone's agenda starts intersecting, Russell and Ryan must try to secure justice - even though no one is quite sure what that would entail.

Although quoting the dialogue does not do it justice, most people in my theater were laughing heartily throughout. Crowe and Gosling have great chemistry, though I never would have imagined pairing them (I guess that's why I don't cast movies). The young actress who played the daughter also held her own and delivered an impressive performance. Highly recommended.",1463788800,3,2288,4.966057441253263
7743954,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"The Movie Review by Andy McKinney
The Nice Guys
 Hooray, we get a comedy that actually has some great laugh lines and in a sort of action movie at that.  A private detective teams up with a thug, a professional bone breaker, to save the life of an endangered young woman.  Ryan Gosling plays the lazy, shiftless, alcoholic P.I. and has most of the best lines.  He can also handle physical comedy very well.  The theater literally rang with laughter to watch him work-and  on more than one occasion.  Russlell Crowe plays the bone breaker, a low life bad man who hurts people for a living.  He says that it is just business for him but we know that he likes his work.  The money shot in the film for me lasts about 10 seconds while Crowe contemplates his personal moral void.  He expresses a complicated set of emotions with his facial muscles in a bit of acting that rises to brilliance.  Bravo Mr. Crowe.
 We have the gift of a string of fine actors in the back up positions to grace the film as well.  Kim Basinger plays a duplicitous, even evil, federal prosecutor.  Her cosmetic work makes her a look that conforms to the cold and harsh role she plays.  Matt Borner, star of the long running TV show ""White Collar"" plays a very bad badie and convinced me.  Young Australian actress with the intriguing name of Angourie Rice plays the P.I.'s too grown up for 13 daughter.  She shows great promise as an actress and already has a dozen TV and other small roles to her credit.  She is a genuine actress and not just a child delivering lines.  Gil Gerard, an old vet who we remember best from his starring role as ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"" ages ago has a small role.  The spectacularly beautiful Murille Telio has only a single line but you will remember her.
 Writer/director Shane has the credit or blame for this movie.  In this case he has the credit.  He has written a complex, convoluted tale of dirty deeds done with violence.  He also put in a lot of very clever, funny stuff to keep us laughing along the way.  He has a writing partner in Anthony Bogarozzi who scores big in this, his first time up as a script writer.  Shane Black has a strong sheet as a director.  He directed ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"", a somewhat similar action/comedy and also the clever and exciting ""Iron Man 3"" among others.  His career as a writer goes all the way back to the 1987 ""Lethal Weapon"" and includes ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" as well as ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"".  You can sense his style in writing from his past work.
 So we have good writing, good direction and exceptional jobs by the two leading men.  Rotten tomatoes gave it a very strong endorsement, as do I with a big four saw blades.  It did however come in at number four on the opening Friday.  The producers might have trouble clawing back their $50 million budget in good time in this season crowded with gigantic summer movies.  Be warned, this one hour and 56 minute long movie does carry a very strong ""R"" designation.  Besides language and murder the makers see fit to show lots of different women in states of partial undress.  Lots and lots of women.
 Fun fact-The movie was set in LA but filmed largely in Georgia.  Georgia has a very positive tax situation for film making in the Peach State.  We often see that films are made at least partially there, which is done not for artistic reasons but for the tax advantages.",1463788800,8,3388,4.429497568881685

7743986,3,B01F5ZY4YC,"the movie is a narrow pass. it will entertain if you have absolutely nothing else to do, and you don't really mind watching anything. the production is very good. however, that's the only good thing i can say about this movie. the movie has no integrity, neither the plot, nor the characters, nor the dialogues, nothing makes much sense. there is no arc. if you don't mind, you may like it. i have two other major problems with this movie. (1) to me it seems like a shamelessly obvious (but not admitted) remake of the big lebowski. entire scenes, characters, lines have been lifted from the big lebowski. they are so many a coincidence is ruled out. either the authors deliberately plagiarized, or they were so much under the influence of the big lebowski that they recreated parts without even being aware. either way, the movie just does not appear original. (2) the entire movie is one huge instance of some sort of shameless self-promotion of the creators, like, 'hey, look how smart and witty we all are'. i got tired of this ego-trip fairly early on. if they are so smart, make a smart movie, not one that keeps saying how smart the creators are

i expected a better movie, and watching this movie got me tired. i guess if you have no expectations, or your only expectation is that you stare at a very mediocre attempt instead of staring at the wall, it's ok. there are much worse movies out there, therefore i think a (weak) 3 is reasonable. definitely does not live up to the hype. keep your expectations low. if you want to watch a good movie in this genre, just watch the big lebowski, and give this one a miss. it's entirely missable, if that's a word in english ...",1526083200,,1678,4.501639344262295

Set in 1977 L.A., and blessed with a killer soundtrack, this movie really took me back to those days (I lived on N.

I would never have thought of pairing Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, but they work very well together, with Crowe as the straight guy and Gosling as his never-entirely-serious partner.

7744031,3,B01F5ZY4YC,"It's a very poor mystery film, and everyone knows that mysteries are only good for one view, generally, but the antics of Ryan Gosling and the period were so entertaining that I actually enjoyed the film.
What a TERRIBLE plot, but somehow, the shenanigans allowed it to be somewhat entertaining.

I actually thought that Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling made an entertaining pair.
They totally abandoned Russel Crowe's character, and he went from sort of a bad-guy to a more neutral guy, but at least it wasn't over-the-top.

When people try too hard, and act pretentious, and inorganic, that's when it becomes painful.
This movie was bad, but at least they were sincere about it. (haha)

Believe it, or not, they could actually do a sequel, and I think that would be okay.
It can only get better from here, so why not? (LoL)

7744035,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"The Nice Guys was my favorite movie of 2016, for all that it came out in spring: a crime thriller with an oddball bromance and a truly touching family story. Considering that this is crude (the case revolves around a porn star), violent (R-rated) and has more than its fair share of Tarantino-esque scenes, this is no small feat. The story begins with a porn star, Misty Mountains, crashing her car through someones house in California in the late 70s. Her murder coincides with a current environmental case against the auto makers in Detroit (which Mountains died to expose), and allows both a disgraced detective and a muscle man to find their footing and seek justice, not just for Misty but for a city protesting the effects of pollution caused by industrial giants.

Ive been a fan of Ryan Gosling since Young Hercules in the mid-nineties (so yes, it has been an extremely long time). Here, hes a private detective named Howland March. Hes paired with Russel Crowe as Jackson Healey, an actor I have mixed feelings for. They work so well together that my opinion of both has risen. Goslings idiot-savant detective and Crowes tough-as-nails/heart of gold strongman complement one another well, especially with the inclusion of Marchs daughter, the precocious Holly (Angourie Rice). She gets all the best lines, and nearly runs away with the show; The Nice Guys has the most realisticand lovingfather/daughter relationships in all of cinema. My mom and I say and stuff all the time because of Holly. This movie changed our vernacular, for the better.

Goslings detective also spoke to me on a personal level: a veteran and an alcoholic who lost his wife, hes incredibly depressed and only occasionally lifted by the brilliant inspiration of his mind. He writes You will never be happy on his left hand, and the first thing he tells us is that he wish[es] [he] wished for things, man. He is constantly falling from heights (the question, Did you fall? is a recurring humorous highlight), but every time he falls, he gets back up. Healey is not as emotionally compelling initially, but he has a more intense character arc: he goes from the type of man who kills in cold blood to the type of man who cant.

The smaller characters are taken wellexception made for the rather wooden Basingerand overall there are few weak links. The last act has a bit of squishy alcoholic oddity that I didn't particularly care for, but the rest of the movie is note-perfect. Goslings star is rising (took long enough) so I am hopeful for a sequel. Pretty please? Bromances and buddy comedies are my jam, and there will never be enough of them in the world to suit my taste.",1512691200,,2656,4.75704989154013

7744040,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"An unlikely duo must team up to find a missing girl before a secret cabal has her murdered in The Nice Guys (2016), a comedic crime drama written by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi and directed by Shane Black. Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys is a film noir for the disco era, but wasn't originally written as a period piece. Thankfully, the writers decided to rework the concept and what resulted was one of the best films of 2016.

Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a muscle-for-hire who Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley) pays to dissuade private detective Holland March (Ryan Gosling) from looking for her. March, an alcoholic who lives with his preteen daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice), believes Amelia is somehow connected to the death of porn star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio). Misty's aunt, Mrs. Glenn (Lois Smith), hired March to investigate Misty's death because she believed Misty might still be alive.

When two anonymous men (Beau Knapp and Keith David) show up at Jackson Healy's apartment to press him for details on Amelia's whereabouts, he decides to pay March to help him locate Amelia before they do. Together, they discover Amelia and Misty were connected to an underground adult film allegedly exposing a conspiracy on the part of auto manufacturers to suppress the catalytic converter. Several people involved in the movie turned up dead.

Things get really complicated when Amelia's mother, Judith (Kim Basinger), a prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice, pays March and Healy to find her daughter. When Amelia literally falls into their laps, she accuses her mother of being part of the conspiracy. March and Healy slowly put the pieces together, but will they rescue her and the last remaining film reel in time to expose the truth?

Nice Guys was loosely inspired by true events, although it wasn't advertised as such. Because of its particular geography, Los Angeles has long suffered from lingering smog, which was a pervasive problem in the mid-twentieth century. The film pokes fun at activists protesting ""bird killing"" pollution, but people really did wear gas masks to protest LA smog and it did have negative and long-term consequences for public health.

Auto emissions were a contributing factor to airborne toxins until 1975 when the Environmental Protection Agency mandated all new cars come equipped with a catalytic converter. GM, Ford, and Chrysler (the ""Big Three"") agreed to research pollution-reducing technologies in 1953 but dragged their heels. The Justice Department filed an anti-trust case against the Big Three in 1968, alleging a conspiracy to suppress pollution-reducing technologies. So the events that formed a backdrop for the film occurred years before the film takes place.

Nice Guys is more concerned with evoking the Zeitgeist of the decade rather than a strict adherence to facts. It was a brief time in American history when adult films were socially relevant. The 1970s are sometimes referred to as the ""Golden Age of Porn,"" when porn achieved some mainstream success with films like Deep Throat (1972) and The Devil in Miss Jones (1973). There were also widespread but unsubstantiated fears of Mafia influence in the adult film industry, which Judith uses as a red herring in this film.

Nice Guys features several strong performances. Ryan Gosling is a Canadian actor with a long career in film and television, most notably in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notebook/dp/B000YMFCS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notebook</a>&nbsp;(2004) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Place-Beyond-The-Pines/dp/B00ECU2X9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Place Beyond The Pines</a>&nbsp;(2012). In 2016, he also starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-La-Land/dp/B01MRR7AUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La La Land</a>, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Holland March is a less serious role, demonstrating Gosling's versatility as an actor. Audiences and critics loved it. For this performance, he was nominated for ""Favorite Comedic Movie Actor"" at the People's Choice Awards and was awarded ""Best Comedic Performance"" by the San Diego Film Critics Society.

Angourie Rice, a young Australian actress, had her breakout role in The Nice Guys. Since then, she's appeared in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-Homecoming/dp/B073HJTTQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a>&nbsp;(2017), which was praised by audiences and critics, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beguiled-2017/dp/B073PMYXWB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beguiled (2017)</a>, which was not. Her character in The Nice Guys, Holly, is an adorably precocious child, insisting she can help her father solve the case (since her father is an incompetent drunk, who can blame her?). Like Natalie Portman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Professional/dp/B000LPI68W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Professional</a>&nbsp;(1994), Angourie is perfect for the role, and hopefully will have a bright future in film.

Nice Guys is funny, clever, and expertly manages a purposely convoluted and over-the-top plot ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Lebowski/dp/B000I9WW0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Lebowski</a>&nbsp;(1998) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fargo/dp/B0030MBX56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fargo</a>&nbsp;(1996). Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling perfectly play off each other's strengths, and bring a sense of ironic humor and style to an otherwise bleak and cynical world.",1511654400,4,5827,6.46025641025641

Ryan Gosling is (un)surprisingly very good in one of his only comedy roles to date.  To be biased, he's definitely my favorite part of the movie.  Russell Crowe also does not disappoint, and Angourie Rice, who plays the young third lead, definitely holds promise.  The three of them have wonderful chemistry.

I am a huge fan of director Shane Black, and if you are too you, this will be a treat.  It is definitely not your average buddy cop comedy because it has Black's very recognizable dark humor and twists and turns.  It is very reminiscent of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.

7744161,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"I am really surprised by the amount of viewers who were unable to appreciate this film, and most especially, the acting.  I guess this really is one of those 'you get it or you don't' sort of things.  I think that it helped that I didn't have any expectations going into this, hadn't even seen the trailer, I just gave it a chance. The plot is not strong but it doesn't need to be, that's not what this is. Its not an epic journey of the profound nature of humanity, its more... a compilation of sh! t that happens. Its one of the most entertaining things I've seen in a while.  I feel so compelled to defend it after reading the negative reviews but I am really struggling to describe why its so enjoyable.  Its kind of like when you share a moment with someone where something just hits you the right way and you both laugh so hysterically it hurts... then someone else walks in and asks, 'what's so funny?' and you can't really explain it, you just had to be there.  It truly is funny, even strikes you in an intellectual way, but there's not exactly a formula to it, its an experience and you either get it or you don't. A lot of the complaints centered on the lack of compelling and original plot, these people are not wrong but they missed the point entirely.  That being said, I hate most of the popular comedies that come out because they are such unintelligent, pandering turds. For all that the writing lacks, this is still not that.  What really boggled my mind, were the ones that were put off by the sexual content and violence... did they stumble into the wrong theater/country/decade?  And most especially, the ones who knock the acting.  Everyone  knows these two have substantial chops for drama but I was seriously impressed by their comedic delivery.  Their nuanced dedication to their craft is abundantly obvious here.  There's some fun scripted banter and the like but its really the performances that make it so entertaining.  Every scene is full of so many brilliant details, slight movements, expressions, inflections; I watched several scenes repeatedly just to get to fully appreciate them all.  You could teach a course on the fine points of comedic delivery with this film.  I have no idea how so many people didn't see that or their chemistry. Apparently this movie just isn't everyone's cup of tea but if you like the trailer, give it a chance, I'm so glad that I did.  It takes a bit to hit its stride.  Some people said they quit 20 minutes in, which is a shame, because 2 minutes later, Crowe and Gosling team up and that's when it really gets good.  But I'd say if it doesn't have you by minute 30, it's not gonna happen.",1492992000,4,2655,4.495833333333334

7744164,2,B01F5ZY4YC,"This flick is a flop!  I love both Russell Crowe & Ryan Gosling, 2 of the very finest current day actors, so I was really looking forward to this flick.  So sad. But it's definitely not Crowe's & Gosling's fault.  These 2 mega-actors should be insulted by this mega-flop!  And everyone connected w/ writing, producing, directing, bankrolling, and acting in this film should be embarassed for giving legendary actors like Crowe and Gosling such crap to work with.  The storyline & script are not just poorly written and dumb (as in ""duh""), but they have no ""crime-solver"" credibility or believable complexity, which loses the attention of the viewer early on, so that, by the end, there is nothing but cheap, immature car chases, fist fights, gun battles, ""girl-power super-feats (ugh, spare me).  This film very quickly degenerates into all the stupid, cheap stuff that, sadly, so many recent films fall into:  the deep, dark hole of boring, mindless 21st century filmmaking.  A subplot of the script that really ruined the flick is the character of Ryan Gosling's daughter, Holly March (played by Angourie Rice, who, in real life, is actress Andie McDowell's daughter).  The inclusion of Holly's pre-teen character keeps spinning the storyline off into too many meaningless directions (Holly's stupid ""girl-power super-feats and super-sleuthing""), to the point where you get the feeling that Andie McDowell ""bankrolled"" this film on the condition that her daughter have the script rewritten around her character.  Most disturbing as it relates to scripting around Holly's pre-teen character is that this is NOT a kid's flick since there is much sexually explicit language and content.  On the positive side, there are a few stellars, but not enough to hold the film together:  1) the highly trained acting chops & interactive chemistry between Crowe and Gosling are solid & exciting to watch (especially Crowe); 2) the ""old-school 70s"" soundtrack is awesome (so many memories of living the life in 70s SoCal); 3) the ""70s period set design"" is so much fun, including the quintessential classic American auto designs of the big ole hunk-a-metal ""hoopdy"" rides; the vintage Earth, Wind & Fire performance at the Hollywood party; clips from The Comedy Store on Sunset Blvd.; the vintage film from the LA Auto Show; the clothes & hairstyles, etc.  It's so sad - this flick could have been SO much more, but, for some reason, all the essential working parts just fizzled out.  It would be enlightening to know why everything tanked because the film's mistakes and weaknesses are so in-your-face.",1492819200,,2591,5.094562647754137

7744235,1,B01F5ZY4YC,"Unconscionably sleazy private detective movie follows brusier-for-hire bum Jackson Healy (a passable turn by Russell Crowe) as he mistakenly crosses paths with harried father and burnt out private eye Holland March (played amiably by Ryan Gosling) as they get involved in solving a high-class series of crimes involving pornography, larceny, and murder.
Either I'm losing my mind or the rest of the movie watching public have simply closed their eyes to what is going on in this movie, but to say that this film is an endorsement of pedophilia is, in a word, putting it mildly. Child actress Angourie Rice (who is only fifteen here) is presented as mature, attractive, and wise-beyond-her-years, and clearly she is supposed to be ""mother to the man"" in the case of Gosling's goofy father character. The problem is that she's made up to be the attractive one here, only placed in the ""mature"" part so that she can appeal to the leering perverts in the audience (and this covers most of the people in Hollywood California). The movie makes futile attempts at being funny, but this type of child exploitation is borderline psychotic on behalf of the filmmakers. Now don't get me wrong, I do enjoy private eye fiction, even the old Mickey Spillane pot boilers mind you, but there is a difference in style and attitude that makes the objectionable content of other detective fiction easier to digest because of an acceptable moral framework. Such a framework is lacking in this movie, however, and I suspect that this advertisement for the creepy world of pornography was sold in order to further corrupt the taste of viewers who might have mistakenly come to this picture in the hopes of finding a new genre movie classic.
Hollywood has been on thin ice with me for quite a long time, but usually I can roll with the punches of adult content in these productions...however, THE NICE GUYS has a distinctly sleazy and unapologetic feel that makes its filthiness a little bit harder to shake off after the picture is over. The plot in itself is also a bit convoluted, and to me the movie felt overlong and predictable. There is an effort at capturing the grotesque nostalgia of late 70's L. A. but it's too morally diseased for my taste. L.A. CONFIDENTIAL this ain't! All of this is especially disheartening considering that it was Shane Black's hand that guided this movie; unfortunate, since I am going to continue holding out hopes that his newest (planned for 2018) release of THE PREDATOR will be a movie done the right way and with honest intentions--but now this enthusiasm has been hampered by my knowledge of his current work in the Hollywood ""wet dream factory."" Cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot does a grand job of catching most of the period detail, but the story and characters are so corrupt that it's difficult to find any enjoyment here, unless you have an unhealthy thing for prepubescent girls. Under any circumstances, pornography is not something to be taken so lightly, even in a fictional, ""throwback"" movie like this. It is a criminal activity that needs to be persecuted and prosecuted under the law, not celebrated and cleverly insinuated into the consciousness of the masses as it is here. As for the movie itself, THE NICE GUYS is a not-so-clever hodge-podge of stale ideas, Tarantino-esque funk on the soundtrack, and glaringly obvious plot twists. My opinion? This movie just isn't worth it. F+ (because of Crowe's presence)",1487635200,2,3448,4.915951972555746

The '70s period sets and ""costumes"" as well as a pretty accurate feel for the smoggy oil shock meets cheesy porn and porn 'staches of the time is right on. (And how cool did they make Holly with those Sex Pistols and Clash posters on her bedroom walls.) Also, the humor is just right. It's never intrusive as far as interfering with the storyline.

7744250,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"I thought the trailer showed that this was a good comedy. Then I watched the movie.

It lived up to the promises of the trailer - and then some. Even watching the trailer now, I think the trailer itself is a masterful depiction of the themes, colors, sounds, and tone of the movie. Which, if you like it, means you will love this movie and it will make you laugh.

Then I watched the movie again. How much I missed the first time around became apparent to me. I kind of get nostalgic looking at the fashions and hairstyles of the time depicted, and the banter between the main characters took me back a bit, too. There weren't too many false steps in the choice of words used for dialogue. There is not much makes this movie feel like 'today.'

It is very very funny. I know I'll be watching this again, just as I watched 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' recently (for probably the sixth or seventh time). Same director, same quality, same skills. Very good stuff.",1486598400,2,953,4.372881355932203

7744265,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"The title ""Nice Guys"" is obviously meant to be ironic because neither the obese enforcer nor the alcoholic private eye are nice. The first beats people up and even kills people. The second is an alcoholic who steals and lies. Both are not too bright. Both bumble through life. Both are losers. The only smart and mature person in the film is the PI's 13-year-old daughter. However, it is true that a person, who really does not understand what happened in the film, calls them nice guys.
The film is funny, but many will see some ""funny"" parts as being simply silly, such as falling from a roof.
The plot is complicated. A porno star is killed and her relative, who wears very thick eyeglasses, says she saw her several days after she was killed. She hires the PI to find her. The PI hires the enforcer, who had broken his arm previously as an enforcer, to help him. He gives him all the money he has, $400.
There are lots of naked women in the film, including a picture from a Playboy magazine that shows everything a woman has.",1486598400,,1029,4.421052631578948

7744269,3,B01F5ZY4YC,"There's always something semi-entertaining going on, but the movie fails to be more than average on a few levels. The plot is overly complicated and intentionally absurd, but the absurdity is undermined by the body count of innocent victims and bystanders, including women and children. The buddy relationship between Crowe and Gosling is never fully convincing; the Gosling character is at times written as irredeemably stupid. And the character of precocious 13 year old daughter who's the parent in the relationship is tired and gets in the way. Russell Crowe is really good, but I kept thinking the Gosling role was being played by a young, partially engaged Nicolas Cage.",1486425600,,676,5.154545454545454

7744274,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"Was looking for a fun movie my husband and I would enjoy. He's more into action flicks; I like action, but appreciate a good story. This fit both of our tastes. The chemistry between Growe and Gosling is great, the story moves quickly enough to keep your attention. Unlike some other ""buddy cop"" movies, there ins't an unneeded amount of time spent on building the relationship between the two leads. It happens more organically (doesn't feel forced). Overall, highly recommend for anyone in search of a fun cop movie with a sprinkle of comedy and action. But be prepared: the background story involves a missing porn star. So if you're not a fan of nudity, this movie might not be for you (thought it didn't bother me). Might not want to watch with my parents :)",1486252800,,763,4.617647058823529

If you are very literal, and all hung up on plot-maybe not so much. The plot here really isn't that important.  It becomes increasingly absurd as to be a joke on noir films. No worries, there is a nice little story and a lot of laughs, you just have to realize that the big Chinatown plot is not to be seriously considered. Watch this. It is good fun.",1486166400,2,487,4.282608695652174

Nothing wrong with a long movie, but this one had a lot of pointless little asides that served no real purpose.  Once you got used to the characters, the jokes got pretty stale.  It was also one of those movies that had all of the funny lines  in the trailer and in the actual movie, they weren't that funny because the novelty of the characters wore off pretty quick.

If you haven't seen the film and are interested in seeing it, I'd say it's a wise investment. If you're a fan of films like The Big Lebowski, Pulp Fiction or Lethal Weapon you'll probably be in to this. Much like The Big Lebowski, the characters are interesting and hilarious, making this a quintessential ""hang out movie."" It captures the style of an era and  gives it a new twist in the same way Pulp Ficiton does, and you can appreciate how loyal it is to the kind of films it's paying homage to, while at the same time enjoying it for its originality. I'd say it's marginally better than Lethal Weapon since the dichotomy between these two characters feels much more organic and less cookie cutter.

But still, it was not enough to take away from my overall enjoyment of this film. The chemistry between the 3 leads is fantastic; Angourie Rice as Gosling's daughter does not get top billing, but she plays a pivotal role in the story and is very much the glue that holds that team together. The movie does perhaps follow Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a bit too closely, but that one was a movie I loved, so I'm not complaining... I would have taken off half a star (for too many Big Fire-Fights and that KKBB thing), but - if the choice is between 4 and 5 stars - 5 it is!

It's true though that this movie wasn't dark, or depressing, or a visual CG showcase, instead it was fun. I realize that fun can be an insult now and I'm not against more thinky movies, I'm just down with balance. Maybe I decide to watch Arrival and then to unwind I want to watch a fun movie that isn't stupid and does not treat me like the lowest common denominator, well this fits that peg nicely. I don't know what the arguments are against the movie, I didn't get the vibe that the 1 star reviewers had credentials that qualified them to talk about the quality of the writing or directing, but neither do I. It's just a different species of movie, with tons of replay value for those of us that enjoy it.

It has noir elements for sure, but there are heist elements, some physical shenanigans, and they even weave in a bit of real world corruption. I wish Shane Black could get away with making sequels to this or other movies in this vein.",1482969600,,1068,4.25615763546798

7744642,3,B01F5ZY4YC,"Yet another ""quirky"" Shane Black talkfest with nubile yet useless female characters. I remember when he was the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood, I saw The Last Boy Scout in the theaters, I heard good things about both Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and this film and was excited to see both, and I'm done. He needs someone to sit down with him and cut out the self-indulgence by at least a third.

Too much dialogue with no real depth. A lot of running, shooting, and beatings (which is OK, but not when they start looking like set piece after set piece.). I paid $1.99 to rent this and about halfway in was wishing I'd paid 99 cents. (Yeah, I'd say he deserves that extra dollar.) I wouldn't say don't waste your time, but just get ready for the same thing to happen over and over again.

I feel like his actors (Robert Downey, Jr.; Russell Crowe; Ryan Gosling; Lois Smith) are the ones who really save his work from being less than it is. The 1977 set design and feeling are great though, it felt like really going back in time in a way that other films don't (in my opinion) do as well. Maybe he should stick to making Seventies-era films and industrial films.

I'm not a huge fan of Ryan Gosling, but I did come out respecting him more for all the cartwheels (literally) he went through on this film. I saw Drive and really enjoyed it, so maybe Nicolas Winding Refn should direct while Shane Black writes, or the other way around, etc. Now there's a collaboration...!",1482710400,,1467,4.446096654275093

7744665,2,B01F5ZY4YC,The movie started out interesting but didn't have a direction or an idea of what type of movie it wanted to be. It was initially seemed to be a mildly serious movie about two detectives who had different styles and whose talents might compliment each other to solve the mysterious death of an adult actress. Then it drifts from one idea to the next to a hard to believe plot line that  the attorney general may be plotting the demise of her own daughter. Even the actors couldn't figure out who they wanted to be.  Ryan Gosling's attempt mimic an Abbot and Costello bit where in a stressful situation he can't speak takes the movie into disarray.

7744839,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"The film makers are getting good at making detective or cop movies set in the late '70s.  It must mean something. And here is one of them.

This film is set in the late 1970s in Los Angeles.  The plot revolves around smog.  It was already proven in the early 1950s that the automobile exhaust caused the smog in Los Angeles  in the 1950s.  The plot and narrative is one grand joke.  The movie is a joke that most of the movies and tv shows that America was making in the 1970s did not reflect what most of America and most of California was experiencing in the late 1970s were living with in the late 1970s.

Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling played incredibly well off of each other, and the humor was outstandingly well-written.

My only complaint is that it was a bit long. The movie had a couple sections it could have done without,  but it still offered some funny bits.

Black, however, began on the summit and has been rolling down the mountain ever since.  With the exception of his before mentioned efforts, everything else he has written or directed has ranged from schlock to trash.  The Last Boy Scout was schlock, albeit entertaining schlock.  The Nice Guys is trash.  The narrative is dull and predictable.  The comedy is sleep inducing.  Crowe and Gosling play characters I neither liked nor hated.

His supporting characters while good did not really add to the movie. All did a fine job but the story was just weak. I wouldn't see it again and I just can't recommend it.

Our heros set out to save a girl, they fail, and still the movie goes on another half hour.  These extra innings are to see justice done but that doesn't happen either.

They threw so much money at this, with gigantic party scenes and auto shows but It's like Adam Sandler humor directed with the light touch of Quentin Tarrintino.  Two stars for the little girl and for Gosling's impression of Lou Costello.",1478476800,,564,4.544554455445544

Good use of period music, done so in an unobtrusive way.

Fun at times, mixed with plenty of violence.  I, personally, would've enjoyed it more if they'd kept it more light hearted.

In short, it adds nothing to either genre.  The worldly, precocious preteen, ostensibly created to emphasize the incompetence of the main characters, came across more as annoying than clever.  As with many American action/mystery movies, an overly complicated yet thin plot detracted even further from the film overall.  The movie gave me a very few chuckles but no real laughs.  In the end, it was a few bucks and time I wished I'd spent elsewhere.

How was PI Gosling's apartment so nice? How did PI Crowe get connected with Amelia? Did they have a history? When were we supposed to care? Why was Amelia killed in the end? Where can I get her yellow dress? How villainous were we expected to believe Kim Basigner as head of the DOJ really was after a single scene? And that she would kill her daughter? One scene for the villain? What was in that movie that made the Detroit car industry willing to knock off a 17 year old girl? Is Rotten Toms only used by me and millenials?

This movie is not funny in any form.  Not funny as an action/comedy (like Bad Boys or 2 Guns).  Not funny as a ""buddy/action/comedy.

The acting is worse than a high school play.  It felt like the actors were standing reading the script, with no emotion what so ever (the exception to that being Ryan's daughter, though I can't remember her name, who was surprisingly animated).  No chemistry what so ever between Russell & Ryan, they seemed bored.

The ""action"" parts, if you can actually call it that, were worse than any ""B"" grade movie you'll find.

And the worst part for me, was watching a scene where a 10 or 11 year old girl relaxes on a couch with a porn star at a party, watching a porn flick, and talking about anal sex.  I don't care what your movie preferences are, THIS IS NOT FUNNY.  I'm not even a parent, and this upset me.

7745382,2,B01F5ZY4YC,"I wanted to like this movie.  Sadly, I didn't.  Neither homage nor retro camp, the movie came across as more of a caricature of 70's movies. All the roles also seemed written more as caricatures than relatable characters.

There were plenty of ""action"" scenes, but it was hard to care about the people in them. Much of it felt more like simple slapstick than real ""action.""
I found the repeated involvement of children in inappropriate circumstances more than a little distasteful. Mostly, it was just crass.

Crowe and Gosling are not to blame for the lackluster outcome of this project.  Gosling, in fact, does a nice homage to Lou Costello in his reaction
to the dead body he unwittingly discovers. That scene should have been classic comedy gold. True comedy, though, has heart and soul behind it.  This movie has neither. The actors did a nice job with what they had to work with; but, overall, it just fell flat.",1476835200,,918,4.70625

7745412,2,B01F5ZY4YC,"The movie starts out reasonably well but quickly deteriorates after the first half hour.  The 70's details and style are terrific as is the banter - that's what Shane Black is good at - buddy banter.  So it's a shame that we end up with a largely incoherent, unsatisfying mess of a movie.  I honestly don't know how a studio head could have read through the entire script and then green lighted it with no changes.  It looks and plays like a first draft desperately in need of a second and third act.  The only bright spot is the chemistry and acting chops of Gosling and Crowe.  They're a lot of fun to watch - but even they wind up lost in the tedium as, for some inexplicable reason, the 13 year-old daughter of Gosling's character winds up center stage for most of the second half.  Considering the environs and characters around her - this comes off not as cute (although clearly Shane Black thinks so) but rather more like pedophile creepy.",1476748800,,946,4.465116279069767

I love the actors and seeing it as a rental was good because I am glad I did not pay full price at the cinema for this. Brief Nudity also.

Crowe was great as the heavy in the group while Gossling was a slick talker who made me laugh even though I hate his face.

By the way I hate to say it, but Kim Bassinger is terrible in this movie. It was pretty painful to watch any of her scenes because she was really that awful.

I love that it was set in the 70's and that Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling were superb and the story and the direction were all on point too. This wasn't hysterical by any means but it did create smiles more often than not. Matt Bomer was sensational too. This is one of those dream casts that clicked.

I initially thought this was primarily an action comedy but to me the laughs were really cheesy and fell pretty flat.  None of the funny moments were particularly funny.  There is plenty of action throughout but the thin story just isn't well written and lacked a cohesive plot that seemed to be every 70s movie genre it could be all at one time.  This movie had some promise and with a better written focused script could have been much better than it was.  Instead it is rather mediocre and forgettable.

7745871,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"They just don't make movies like this anymore. This one will be best appreciated by the older farts, but its an instant classic in all regards. Equal parts action, mystery and comedy, this film packs a peppy punch from its charismatic leads and fun caper. With a solid studio budget and even rarer R-rating, no films would also be a 70s period piece that features awesome locales like a swinging Hollywood-hills house party and LA-auto show shootout. On paper the film might not look so special, but when everyones talent is at the top of their game, the films residual cult status will undoubtedly validate its unfortunately lackluster box office.

Of special note here is Goslings inspired performance. While Crowe is great too, Gosling really cuts loose with the goofy, physical comedy. Theres one moment where he stumbles onto a corpse in which he fully channels Curly Howards bulging cockeyes and barking gasps just like when the Stooge would discover the gorilla at the museum is actually alive.

This movie completes the unofficial trilogy of writer/director Shane Blacks bumbling sleuth buddy films, harkening back to The Last Boy Scout and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling + young atress Angourie Rice the pretty cute monster who just casted to new Spiderman movie will make you jump off ship in the middle of the ocean just to see this movie.
It is even better then LETHAL WEAPPON series.
It will make you feel so good after the show!
The director is Shane Black who actually wrote LETHAL WEAPPON,LAST BOYSCOUT and directed IRNO MAN 3 , KISS KISS BANG BANG.
He is a great guy I mean it.

This movie is not all funny but intelligently funny.
It makes you funny in a classy way.
It is not dirty but very smart.

All the actresses are so beautiful and Although Russell is so chubby and is far from his good shape back then when he was in the movie GLADIATOR he is still very charming to look at.
RYAN GOSLING is funny, quirky guy with problems sometimes pussy as hell which makes him humane who has a lovely daughter you will die to want to have one, I would die for her who is a new actress Angourie Rice you should remember her name cause she is good, I mean real good.
She is not a glamorous or anything but super cute, knows how to be loved kind of a girl.
Very American style.

Two of them are private investigator. One is a brave one who doesn't care what happens just go for it kind of a guy. That is Russell.
The other is more of a think twice and do it that is Ryan.
Two meet to solve the problem for this govermnet woman Kim Basinger who's daughter is a protest against air pollution. To do so the daughter is in this porn movie with her boyfriend and that is against Kim who is now running for the government trying to get rid of Porn.

Two of them collides buddy up make lots and lots of incidents, some times smart as hell sometimes problem after problem you will never imagine that make your balley run away from your stomach that you need a fish hook to find it.

The old fashioned oldies music will make you feel great.
The great cool camera walk will open your mind at all times.

7745887,2,B01F5ZY4YC,"The Nice Guys suffers from a nearly terminal case of indecision. First and foremost, it cannot make up its mind if it is a broad comedy, buddy movie, heist movie, murder mystery or a period piece (the opening scene informs us that it takes place in 1977).  In each of these efforts the film is mildly successful, but not entirely so, and in the end it is essentially silly with sub-par performances by Crowe and Gosling. To say that Kim Basinger performance was wooden is an insult to real wood. She has limited screen time and her role is not pivotal but she is dreadful and left me wondering what she was doing in this film. That question could also be applied to Crowe and Gosling, both bringing a kind of cartoon sensibility to their respective roles. Angourie Rice, a 13 year old who plays Goslings daughter, steals the movie and is by far the most interesting character in the muddled plot. The intrigue in the film is so convoluted, clumsy and stupid that you have a sense that you missed something important, early in the film, or that it never made sense in the first place. Either way, you lose interest very quickly. Several plot threads, initiated early in the film, simply vanish without resolution. There are a couple of good laughs and some genuinely funny bits but don't rent this film thinking that because Crowe and Gosling are in it that it comes anywhere near what you have come to expect from actor with their resume.

It felt like he and the director were experimenting with the character throughout the whole flic and decided to throw them all in on what felt like a rushed final product. Maybe there was pressure from the studio to put this movie in theaters sooner than anticipated.  I like Gosling as an actor, but not in this one.

At the beginning I found it off-putting because it evaded my expectations, but once those expectations were abandoned, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie for what it was. It's sardonic. It skewers conventional assumptions about power (e.g. Detroit's dominance) and about movies (e.g. that protagonists must be acting altruistically in order to be good.)

7746110,1,B01F5ZY4YC,"Disgusting.  This film actually glorifies pornography.  Not only does it have gratuitous nudity throughout the film.  The porn stars are the good guys.  The vulgarity and the corruption of children masquerade as major themes of the movie.  A nude actress lies in front a child actor in the first scene of the movie.  The random, no consequence and absurd violence serve punch lines.  One may finds the manslaughter of an innocent victim of gun violence, the murder of a woman, as funny.  Other may see the joke as uncouth.

Also the film trivializes women.  The film depicts one of the women in the film, a mother who lost her daughter first to pornography and then to murder as an enfeebled buffoon who moves the plot forward and then is quickly discarded like used tissue.  Think about losing your daughter and being so desperate as to employ a con man private detective (Gosling) and then that's it.  You're done exit stage left.  Wow.  Really Hollywood?

No one is a perfect father, but Gosling's character neglects and endangers his daughter and that neglect and endangerment passes for character development in this film.  And Gosling's character is the more sympathetic of the two characters. This movie disturbs.  I am glad I did not pay any money to see this movie.  Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling have a lot to explaining to do their fans because this movie should have never been made.  This perverted filth testifies of some dark occult influence over Tinseltown.  SHAME.

One more thing, a big shame on you Chris Stuckman and Jeremy Jahns for recommending this movie.  Unsubs on youtube coming at you two gentlemen.",1474243200,,1628,4.822463768115942

Still, the movie is entertaining if you can stand exposing a tween girl to porn and violence throughout the film which is what happens to Gosling's daughter.

7746209,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"This was a great movie, it's set in the 70's but reminds me a lot of movies and TV shows I watched as a kid in the 80's. Written by the same guy who wrote Lethal Weapon, this is another great two guys from different social and ethical worlds forced to be buddies to stop a crime from happening. Crowe is a thug who for money will make someone who is bothering you, or dating your daughter, stop doing so. Gosling is a private investigator struggling to pay the bills. Crowe's character is hired by a teen to persuade a man (Gosling) who keeps asking about her to stop doing so. Gosling's character has a young daughter who Penny from Inspector Gadget style, is smarter than her bumbling private investigator father and keeps his investigation on track. I can't remember an adult audience film other than Kick Ass where a young girl character has added so much to the fun of the film and driven the plot of the movie forward. The daughter is brilliantly played by Angourice Rice (These Final Hours).

This is a fun film, it does have some dark humour, some swearing and nudity, but there's nothing wrong with any of those things. It's just a fun film, I'd definitely check out a sequel if they ever made one.

Ryan Gosling portrays a more bright P.I.  who drinks too much and falls down a lot in the same L.A. His daughter, who looks 13,  is never in school, hangs around with them and gets to see a porn movie at a Porn Kings pool party. ( more below )

They meet when Russell is paid to break Ryan`s arm. This causes them to bond and become friends.

There is an extended 1970`s L.A. pool party scene with lots of porn actress acting, or maybe actors playing  porn actress ?, but it`s done in  extremely good taste. The high point for me in the pool party scene was a drunk Gosling falling down a cliff and losing his gun.

Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, however, were both a little awkward at the 'buddy comedy"" genre. Oodles of talent, not much experience. Their timing could have been a lot better but they both turned in performances worthy of them. They obviously worked at it. And therein lies the problem, it's obvious they are working at it.

Brought together by a series of incidents that lead to a climactic finale. Gosling and Crowe have great chemistry though it's like oil and water.

7746336,2,B01F5ZY4YC,"I had expectations of a decent film after seeing the trailer. Overall, I was a little disappointed. Crowe and Gosling were entertaining, but it kind of stops there. The plot offers no real twists (when you can deduce who the person ordering killings is WAY in advance of the reveal, it's usually poor writing/directing). The story relies on the tropes of the idiot child in the wrong place at the wrong time (much like White House Down, with the dumbest child character known to man), which is infuriatingly overused. If this movie didn't have the star power behind it, I would never had thought to watch it.

This is a good showcase for great serious actors to do a bit of comedy.  Sort of a buddy, crime, mystery set in the 70's.  I loved the cars, clothes, music and authenticity of the era.  The story is odd with Goslings daughter as a third ""crime solver"" and Crowe as the ""straight man"" to Gosling. But it was entertaining and funny.

It was somewhere between 1 and 3 stars.  Needed a new writer and a new director.",1473033600,,445,4.7272727272727275
7746631,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"I found this movie very enjoyable!  Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling work well together and I found Mr. Gosling especially funny.  I did, indeed, laugh out loud several times during the movie.  Angourie Rice, the young Australian actress who plays Ryan Gosling's daughter in the movie was especially endearing.  I think she will be an actress to watch.  [...] The plot is at times a bit of a stretch, but the movie keeps you engaged the whole time and the period feel was spot on.  Overall, this is a great rental!  Enjoy!

Note - I would give it a solid 3 out of 4 if they allowed me.  In this rating system from amazon, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5, but it does not allow me to rate in increments.

They should stick to their individual super careers.  I only watched this after looking at the great critics reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.  Booo, you lousy bought off on the take critics you.

7746668,2,B01F5ZY4YC,"At first it feels like it's going to be a good movie but eventually the thin storyline becomes less relevant as the directors opts for quirky, ad lib dialogue scenes that try a little bit too hard to be funny. It's kind of nonsensical to the point that Ryan Gosling character becomes annoying which is kind of shocking. Speaking as a woman, he is usually very easy on the eyes. Russell Crowe however is very entertaining considering the circumstances. He still pulls off the badass, no nonsense type with ease but you can feel the lack of chemistry between he and Gosling. In the end the movie feels more like it's trying to nail a look then tell a good story. It's all the 70's wardrobe, hair, and cars which look great but leaves you wanting something more substantial.",1473033600,3,771,4.553956834532374

7746778,3,B01F5ZY4YC,"3 Stars.  Shane Black goes back to his buddy cop roots seen in his scripts for Lethal Weapon (1987), Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), but phones it in with a poor script and so-so acting.  Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is an enforcer, who makes money by beating people up.  Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is private eye with a good reputation but is often found nursing the bottle.  He blames himself for the fire that burnt his house down and killed his wife.  He now cares for his daughter, Holly March (Angourie Rice), who is as much of detective as he is.  Healy and March team up to find a young woman, Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley), who disappearance is surrounded by murder and mystery in the porn industry.  This leads to the undaunting truth about why Amelia disappeared.
The premise for this throwback 70s movie is there, but it was hindered by the subpar script that tried to hard to be a slapstick-ish and buddy comedy.  The dialogue seemed forced and the plot was full of obvious clichs that didn't pan into the humor that it may have attempted.  Not sure if Russell Crowe gained weight for the part or if he just let himself go a little, but his appearance did fit perfectly for an aging enforcer.  Ryan Gosling was quirky and slapstick-ish, but it ultimately failed.  He could pull it off comedy if need, the same way he could pull of romance in The Notebook (2004), drama in Half Nelson (2006), or a sociopath in Refns Drive (2011) and Only God Forgives (2013), but the script wasn't there for him.  Both Crowe and Gosling phoned in their performances and were hampered by this script.  Where the movie did shine was in the production and costume design that brought us into 70s Los Angeles.
Ultimately, this is the type of movie that you would see in the theater on a hot summer day, so you can munch down movie popcorn in the cool air-conditioning.  A few laughs would put a smile on your face, as your mind drifts into where you want to go after the movie is over.  Its not horrible or great but forgettable entertainment.  If you're looking for some true 70s substance I would check out Robert Altmans The Long Goodbye (1973).  If you're looking for that modern throwback feel, I would check out Paul Thomas Andersons Inherent Vice (2014).  If you're looking for a fun Shane Black detective story, I would check out his underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005).  If you're looking for a mindless two hours of entertainment, then The Nice Guys would fit the bill.",1472860800,,2504,4.56152125279642

7746781,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"I have a theory about much contemporary cinema, and it goes something like this:  A writer comes up with a concept; it might be a novel (such as Pynchon's ""Inherent Vice""), or it could be a Western, like ""Tombstone.""  S/he trucks it all over Los Angeles to studios' ""green light men"" to see if there is any interest in producing a film based upon said work.  The studios' balk at the film idea, novel, prospectus, or screenplay and send the writer on his or her way.  These studio execs, then, recognizing a worthwhile idea, set their writing teams to work to see if they can come up with a similar idea that could be churned into a film--but without having to pay for the rights and subsequent royalties of the aforementioned prospective film idea.

They even come up with a doppelgnger for the lead actor(s) like, say, Ryan Gosling for Joaquin Phoenix.  (You're beginning to get the idea; aren't you?)  That said, ""The Nice Guys"" isn't a bad movie.  In fact, there are even a few minor touches that add a simple beauty to the film, such as the inclusion of tender asides from the delightful Australian actress Angourie Rice who, like Gosling, resembles a previous cinematic character: the wistful ingenue Paola from Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita,"" who gently pleads with the films' central characters not to give up on the magic of life--or the magic of cinema itself.",1472860800,,1365,4.682008368200837

7746905,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"This movie was delightful, actually.  Not a word I use regularly, but appropriate.  Some of the subject matter is ribald, but if you're not hung up stuff like that, you're going to love this movie.  Just enough action, humor and plot to be ""just right"".  Some campy elements, period-perfect costumes and set design help set the tone right away.  Never been a big Ryan Gosling fan, but he was outstanding and held his own against Russell Crowe.  Not sure what's going on with Kim Bassinger, something wasn't right but I couldn't figure out what it was.  She was probably on the set for a half day to film two scenes, so it's more of a curiosity than a distraction.  Angourie Rice (the girl) steals the whole movie, actually proving useful instead of ""dumb kid"" mode.

7746968,3,B01F5ZY4YC,"I think what you think of this movie depends on your tastes.  Truthfully, I would give it five stars  for the acting, the plot, the amazing job of the 70's detail, and for the actual few good gems of comedic lines and scenes.

I am disappointed though.  I will blame myself.  I should have read up more on the Kids in Mind site to know more about the amount of graphic violence,nudity (some came across as underage actresses, but I hope they just looked VERY young for their age), and that it was a VERY dark comedy.  The trailer sure didn't make it look that way.  I am not trying to be a prude at all.  Hey, I'm not into banning any of that.  I think they have a right to make stuff like that and grown up actors do it with their own understanding.  I just want to know about it in advance to know if I want to watch that stuff or not.  I was under the impression (with the trailer) that it was a way more lighthearted kind of comedy.

If you have seen ""The Professional""  or even the first ""Interview with a Vampire"", that's about the same kind of feel.  I mean only with very young girls (under 12 or 13) in the story line and witnessing much graphic violence, nudity/sexual situations, and foul language. The kind that can make you feel a  squeamish.  Not saying these three movies are alike in quality though.  Obviously, these first two are better that way.  The Nice Guys does actually have dark comedy to go along with it. (Some very good lines and scenes at that)

Basically, if you're looking for a feel good and lighthearted comedy, this isn't it.  Pass it up because, like me, it will stay with you in a bad way for a little while.  If you're cool with very dark humor,  many nude scenes and sex situations, the ""idea""of underage girls doing these scenes, graphic violence, and very young girls witnessing all of this, you'll like the movie.",1472774400,3,1854,4.328488372093023
7746969,2,B01F5ZY4YC,"Shane Black is the script writer of ""Lethal Weapon"" fame.  He had since directed ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" and ""Ironman 3"" with Robert Downey.  This film is about 2 bumbling private eyes in LA circa 1970s.  Frankly this film is a mess.  It is broad, violent, unfunny and juvenile.  Russell Crowe has little to do or didn't know what to do.  The only survivor is Ryan Gosling who somehow managed to look 'respectable' sailing through all this 'mayhem'.

Have never been a big fan of Shane Black - he has his fans (apparently the film reviewers that make up IMDB's crowdsourced, way overstated 7.5 rating!) but I have not been one of them. And I'm not now. This thing is a mess, from a portly Russell Crowe (what happened the Bantam Weight Aussie from Noah?) to a strange plot element involving Single Dad Ryan Gosling's plucky little daughter, to the absurd-but-no- really-absurd plot. Sheesh. If you want a great, great 70s era hallucinogenic detective yarn, try P.T. Anderson's insanely good Inherent Vice. Many filmmakers have done a great job lately of taking what is attractive about Los Angeles, and filming it very well. The great Phillipe Rousselot just phones it in here - or perhaps was hamstrung by his director, but the beautiful 70s retro shots just fall flat. Again, try Inherent Vice, or try Spike Jonez's Her, which was set in a near future LA, and partly filmed in the present day - or even (500) Days of Summer. My biggest problem with The Nice Guys?

7747136,2,B01F5ZY4YC,"I really thought this would be a fun movie, with some action and comedy, but it fell into the trap so many of these movies do, it started taking itself WAY to seriously.

While the first half or so of the movie had some funny scenes and I felt the two main actors had some chemistry, but the writing was really stupid. Then towards the end it became REALLY stupid.

The whole ""conspiracy"" made me feel I needed to wear a tin foil hat, or take a lot aspirin to get rid of the headache it gave me.

Spoilers --- The whole concept of the movie is a bunch of hippy protestor types and a porn kingpin got together to make a movie to show how ""evil"" the top three automakers are. But for some reason which I never found clear they decide to make the movie in the form of a porno. So the big three automakers along with the DOJ, begin killing everyone associated with this movie (this was the tin hat moment for me). The attorney general's daughter is the driving force behind the film and her mommy decides to have her killed (the idea of female AG in the 70's is bit silly). Mind you I have to say I found the daughter of the AG really annoying and she was literally too stupid to live.  The thugs the AG sent were on the most part cartoon characters and were horrible shots (common problem with Hollywood bad guys).

I kind of wish movie and TV writers would show some actual originality in picking there bad guys, the whole capitalism is evil thing has been played to death. Plus its a bit hypocritical having a bunch of rich actors, directors, producers etc. complain about chasing the evil dollar.

Overall, I think having a buddy detective movie could have been fun, but next time get better writers.",1472428800,,1700,4.313479623824452

The two of them had a great chemistry together.

The start of the movie was really strange, I thought.  It seemed like it was going to be a much different type of movie.

7747204,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"Shane Black (the Lethal Weapon series, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Last Action Hero) wrote (with Anthony Bagarozzi) and directed this combination thunder and hilarious spoof of a tow guy crime film and wisely chose Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling to be the pair du jour to pull of this zany and entertaining film.

A mismatched pair of private eyes investigate the apparent suicide of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles. Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) is a fixer who fixes things with his fists. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a cop who following his wife's death became a drunk, a sometimes-present father to his very bright daughter Holly (Angourie Rice). He would become a P.I. who takes on weird cases. He is currently working for a woman (Lois Smith) who wants him to prove that her niece a porn actress (Murielle Telio) is alive when everyone knows she died recently. His investigation takes him to a girl named Amelia Margaret Quailey) who avoids him. She then hires Healey to tell him to leave her alone which he does. But later some guys go to Healey and want to know where Amelia is. When he handles them, he asks March to help him find Amelia. They learn that Amelia's boyfriend, a filmmaker, was killed and his house was burned down along with the film. They later learn the Porn star's producer is also dead. So what is going on.a complex plot to show the world a film about corruption and greed.

It is always surprising when directors and costumers go to such extremes to recreate a period (the 1970s Los Angeles) and yet allow such oversights as the au courante five oclock facial hair that would never have been around so ubiquitously during that time. Now that the porn industry is everyday news that portion holds no secrets, but in the 1970s? But those are small issues in a film that keeps us entertained from the first scene through an hilarious mens restroom scene (Ryan Gosling is extraordinarily funny) to the last expected explosion/bang-bang close. Kick back and just prepare for some belly laughs. Adult themes throughout. Grady Harp, August 16",1472342400,3,2063,4.727777777777778

7747218,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"I give this movie a strong 4.5 stars for that fact that it entertains with a mix of everything: a smart 'mystery' to sleuth, physical comedy that Gosling executes to perfection, action, humor, and both of sense of reality and encounters of the absurd...but how to set expectations so you use your time wisely?  Hm. I won't recap the movie, since most other reviews do that.  So, let's start with what this isn't:
Not your standard cop-buddy movie with 2 clearly good guys saving the day from the beginning.  I'd say it's more 'noir 70s' where the good guys have their faults, issues, and could be anyone just trying to make it by who end up doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do not because of some major epiphany that shines like the bat-beacon to make all things pure.
Not a Point A to Point B then you're done kinda movie that you can watch while you text and still know exactly what is going on.  This movie has threads that weave together throughout; if you miss a couple, then you lose grasp of the movie (not sure if that makes sense until you see it)
Not one that will engross you in the first 10 minutes.  I admit that I thought, ""Ugh, this might bite"" at about that point. But Crowe and Gosling,  the supporting cast, the writing, and my own desire to figure out 'who dunnit' won out, and I'm so glad that happened.
As another reviewer pointed out, reviews are polarized between loved it or hated it for the most part.  Many are 95% one genre--all action, all tear-jerker, all comedy, all drama--with only wee bits of other elements tossed in.  I think the ""hated it"" camp prefer that single element.  Normally, I prefer all action with a peppering of comedy simply because I enjoy the escape.  But something about The Nice Guys...
The movie is smart while being light, outlandish, infused with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and still trying to solve the mystery; it truly was entertaining and accomplished exactly what I needed: a reprieve from what had been a crappy day.  So much so that I think I will watch it again tomorrow  (despite the nudity, cursing, smoking, and drinking...yeah, kinda like Columbo after being body-snatched by Dick VanDyke and taken to a strip joint ,):-)",1472256000,5,2216,4.582278481012659

7747225,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"I saw reviews that this movie was pretty awesome but I didn't see much marketing for it. I had a few amazon digital bucks so I rented it. I was not disappointed. I had no idea what this move was really about, I thought it was kind of a buddy cop movie, which it kind of was. But in the 70's and revolving around a porn movie. There were definitely some bewbs, and even some within the first 5 minutes, so FYI there if you are against that kind of thing.

Pretty much, Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling are their own separate not quite private-eyes that cross paths and end up working together. Ryan's character ends up getting leads hilariously and by accident while Russel Crowe is more gritty and actually does detecting. Their case revolves around a porn actress that dies in the beginning and then other people in the film start to die. These guys try to figure out what's going on before everyone dies.

There are also some not so subtle references to big business and the government allowing pollution to occur at the sake of profits which might get lost on some. It didn't take a front seat at all so if you don't like movies with ""agendas"" or ""messages""don't worry about it, you can still watch this.

I laughed out loud a lot during this movie, especially the dream sequence. I highly recommend this movie if you are in the mood for some laughs.",1472256000,7,1350,4.413654618473895

7747231,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"The era that this film is set in plays as much a character than any of the actors do.  Director-writer Shane Black doesn't use the Seventies for nostalgia purposes but incorporates it to highlight the malaise and decadence of the Carter years.  It's intriguing that he uses the ecology movement and the burgeoning porn industry, key components of the film's central mystery, to underscore his message.  You can also call the film a homage of sorts evoking period noir like ""Night Moves"" and ""The Big Fix"" by way of James Ellroy.  The pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling delivers the expected result with good rapport and neither overplaying their hand.  If I could fault the film it would be that it drags a bit towards the end after its obvious denouement and there's a redundancy to some of the action scenes.

7747254,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"I planned to wait until I had watched the specials before reviewing but I'm struck by how polarized the ratings are.  It seems people loved it or hated it.  The worst reviews didn't explain much, except brief complaints about plot and acting [oh-those were important?]  Now I'm polarizing too, by giving it a 5-star.  I should say: go in with low expectations & maybe you'll love it too.  If you think it's the comedy of the decade, you'll be disappointed.

This is not JUST crude entertainment.  Yes it's crude and yes, [IMO] pretty entertaining.  There's more going on, however.

Neither Crowe nor Gosling are apt to be top of your list for male actors in a comedic role.  Sure both have done it but they seem better known for serious roles.  That alone makes this pairing interesting.

The plot is not initially straightforward, which seems to annoy some viewers.  You are introduced to the ""main players"" one at a time to give you a feel for who they are before they are mashed together.  And it bounces back & forth a couple times before settling down to a [mostly] linear plot with only occasional short flashbacks.

Both these guys are detectives [of a sort, though Crowe's character disavows it] so it seems sort of natural that the audience should have to entertain several possibilities for what's going on, as they themselves struggle to put the pieces together.

This earns its R rating.  Just a small example: Gosling's character is a chain smoker.  You hardly ever see his face without a cigarette stuck in it.  Most Hollywood films banned scenes of smoking a long time ago, so as not to encourage young people to pick up the habit.  Here it becomes a running visual joke.  Crowe's character smokes a cigar in at least one scene.  Gosling is an alcoholic.  There are references to drug use at times [marijuana, certainly] though our main characters aren't involved.  There are references to pornography [part of the plot involves a porn film director and actress].  There is upper body nudity in various scenes.  There's swearing.  There's plenty of punches thrown and bullets fired.  People get killed.  Maimed bodies are seen.  Both our main characters are seen with bruises and injuries.  And killing occurs casually enough that it's part of the visual comedy.  Yes, it's probably not a comedy you'd want your 15 year old to watch.

There is actually a sensitive side to this film.  Gosling's character, usually played as the dimmest bulb in the room to hilarious effect, and an alcoholic to boot, tries his hardest to be a good dad to his teenage daughter.  In the middle of a plot that stretches credulity, their relationship has a ring of truth to it.  They scream at each other, call each other names, and clearly they love each other.  Crowe's character, on the surface a rather ruthless tough-guy, hates who he has become and wishes he could feel proud of something.  And somehow these two ruffians manage to bring out the better part in each other.  Oh no, there's not some unrealistic total transformation of personality here.  You just see that each one grounds the other one, to a degree.

There've been plenty of comedy-buddy films: cop buddies, robber buddies, detective buddies etc.  Nice Guys takes full advantage of the unlikely way these 2 become partners [in a comedic way].  Also-you even sense both these actors are better comedians playing off the other.  It turns out to have been great casting.

The comedy here is bifurcated.  Visually the extreme action is a comedic gag.  But there is little of the purely slapstick humor that so many American films rely on [OK-there is SOME].  Most of the comedy however is in the dialog between Gosling and Crowe.  You have to appreciate just slightly more subtle humor than American audiences seem to have come to expect to laugh here but I sure did.  The other actors and actresses pulled their comedic weight too.  I have to give a special nod to Beau Knapp [aka ""Blueface""] for his bizarrely funny bad guy.

This is really a way better movie than it seems with inattentive viewing.  I definitely have to see the specials on the Blu-Ray.  And given the rockiness of Crowe's career at times, I felt this film makes him much more likeable.  Great to see him in a ""good"" comedy.",1472169600,,4256,4.732605729877217

7747259,3,B01F5ZY4YC,"The movie is awesome and there are plenty of more eloquent reviews out there. But I bought this on disc because I assumed it would have an amazing commentary, as I've come to expect from Shane Black films (seriously; go listen to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang; it's a joy). At the time I pre-ordered this there were no features listed; hell, it didn't even have a release date yet! but I just knew that there would be good things, like alternate/deleted scenes, outtakes or bloopers, and so forth.

Is there a word for an even shorter than usual featurette? For things that are shorter than some music videos? Like a miniature featurette without the implied redundancy? They should invent one. I will: How about ""featureenie""? There is one featureenie on Black himself (that you could learn by reading his Wikipedia page) and a slightly less short featureenie about the film which is mostly soundbites from cast and crew. Nothing about the struggle to make the amazing costumes, or whether the stock of 70s Detroit rolling iron was hard to find, or even the iconic soundtrack.

So whether it's the studio's fault for not documenting this better or maybe making the film was a struggle they didn't want to tell us about there is nothing special about this disc.

7747261,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling made an unlikely duo that I was not sure about at first, but I'm really glad I saw this in theaters in the end. This reminds me of a darker version of Starsky and Hutch, with the same level of cheese, nostalgia and detective vibe but a little bit more risque. There is definitely violence and sexual lewdness in this movie, so probably not a great movie around younger kids (fantastic for grown ups though). In this day and age, honestly it is so refreshing to see an original movie that isn't a book/ comic book/cartoon adaptation, a remake/ reboot, or a sequel. This is an original movie with a good budget and really, really good actors.

Russell Crowe is the muscle (and a little bit of brains), and Ryan Gosling plays the somewhat incompetent and unreliable detective. Russell Crowe also has some of the detective role, so I like to think of Ryan Gosling as the looks and comedy and a little bit of the brains. They have great chemistry together which is not surprising, I can definitely see these two hanging out and having a beer together in real life. The young actress who plays Gosling's daughter is very charismatic and really ties the detective duo dynamic together.

The story itself is good. Please don't expect a Sherlock Holmes quality mystery, almost nothing is. It is extremely entertaining, jam-packed with action and cheesy jokes, and you get your plot twists. I don't want to give away to much, but the overaching plot of a movie is that everyone wants to find this girl and circumstances have led to our two antagonists being hired for the job. It's definitely not a romantic comedy but I still think it's a great movie for date night (which was how I watched this movie)!",1472083200,,1725,4.615635179153094

The reason I mention that I was slightly underwhelmed on my first viewing is to suggest to anyone who might not have liked it their first viewing to give it another shot. It's a wonderful cop buddy period neo noir film except even better, they're private eyes! The cinematography is incredible and deserved atleast a nomination and the action scenes are outstanding and thrilling. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe have great fresh, unique chemistry and are hilarious in their roles especially Gosling who steals the show.

Something about a missing girl we know nothing about from the start so it's hard to care all that much. Watch Starsky & Hutch if you want a full on comedy with an older LA vibe to it.

7747304,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"The Nice Guys takes place in a seedy section of Los Angeles in 1977. Widowed, drunken private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is not above taking financial advantage of his clients. Marchs life takes an unpleasant turn when he encounters thug-for-hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe). But soon they reluctantly team up to locate a missing woman, Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley), assisted by Marchs 13-year-old daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice). During their search, they learn Amelia is linked to a recently murdered porn star named Misty Mountains. Their search narrows to the only remaining celluloid copy of a porn movie that has embedded in it a corporate expose involving the auto industry and air pollution.

Though the plot tends to be convoluted, the chemistry between Gosling and Crowe keeps things percolating. Its refreshing to see a movie thats not a franchise installment, super-hero flick, or remake. The Nice Guys has a freshness, even though it harks back to gumshoe flicks from decades ago with more than a nod to film noir. Writer/director Shane Black has blended two distinct genres  comedy and action drama  using March and Healy as a hardboiled Laurel and Hardy duo eluding bad guys whod like to eliminate them, chief among them an assassin named John Boy (Matt Bomer).

Director Black has taken pains to make The Nice Guys stylish. The period detail  clothing, hairstyles, Star Wars T-shirts, pet rocks, blaring Disco music  set the action in a definite time and place.

The film has a breezy quality despite considerable violence and bloodshed. The sub-plot of March trying to be a good father to Holly seems a tacked-on device geared to humanize him. Gosling has a nice rhythm and laid-back quality to his performance as he tosses off one-liners and smoothly works the physical comedy. Crowe is surprisingly effective, both when he goes for laughs and when he switches to his tough-guy mode. A bit heavier than in recent films, he has the look of a guy whos broken his share of other peoples bones.

Bonus features on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a making-of behind-the-scenes featurette and the cast and crew telling anecdotes about the movies auteur, Shane Black.

It bounces back and forth between these elements rather than combine them into a cohesive film and that left me scratching my head wondering if the writers simply did not have a clear narrative concept.

7747413,2,B01F5ZY4YC,"I love Ryan Gosling. I've been a fan since ""True Believer"".  He usually picks good scripts, and is an actor I consider ""bankable"" when paying fifteen bucks for a rental.

Unfortunately, this was kind of a mess.

The opening scene with the car crash was pretty spectacular, and the chemistry with the actors, Crowe and Gosling, and Gosling and the girl who played his daughter were good.

However, the script was terrible, and the repartee between Crowe and Gosling, and dialogue started to seem kind of dumb because the writing was so bad.

The spiral fracture Crowe inflicted on Gosling, for instance, is no small thing, and often can require surgery, and it seemed an unnecessary element, really.

I never did get if Misty was murdered, or why.  I didn't get why the actual footage of the movie was so important, except it turned out to be some expose.  I didn't get why Bassinger killing her own daughter was so important, or necessary.  And I especially didn't get the interminable gunfight about the last quarter or third of the film.

The super bad guy assassin somehow can't hit a thing when he's up against the buddies, even with a machine gun.  Little girls foil gunmen with household objects, people get thrown through plate glass with hardly a scratch, the cops don't seem to care much about dozens of gun fights going on around them.  What's his name takes the usual dive off a roof into a pool (which would react like you hit concrete from that height) and so forth, all the usual escape in the nick of time hack bits.  It's got absolutely nothing going for it but the buddy routine, but the action is so ridiculous that any attraction from that plot device is pretty much shredded.

7747427,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"Writer/Director Shane Black has given us a wealth of terrific action movies laden with comedy ... or are they comedies laden with action? Samples of his work include ""Lethal Weapon"", ""The Last Boy Scout"", ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"", and more recently, ""Iron Man 3"". He's back in retro form in ""The Nice Guys"", a buddy movie with a body count.

I won't even begin to try to explain the plot to you. An allegedly dead porn star, a missing daughter, an old lady with bad eyesight, inept detectives, corrupt auto executives, the State Department, organized crime ... you name it. There is a cohesive plot, and it makes sense (sort of), but the really joy is watching Crowe and Gosling work their comedic magic in brilliantly-conceived set pieces that continually astonish with delight. Picture a cross between John Woo and the Three Stooges, and you're in the ballpark.

The beginning's a bit of a mess, and I was started to worry that Black had a less-than-stellar film on his hands. I shouldn't have worried. As soon as Black gets his characters working together, the film kicks into high gear.  The time just flew by for me.

If I had to sum up what makes this film so entertaining in two words, those words would be: comedic timing. Everything is impeccably timed to deliver the most laugh-out-loud surprises.

Be warned, however, that this film is not for the faint of heart. For a movie called ""The Nice Guys"", the film racks up quite the body count, and there is enough nudity and swearing to make you regret agreeing to watch it with your children (or your parents).",1470700800,45,1566,4.659420289855072

No. Funny as hell with some real gem moments and characters you'll find yourself somehow rooting for by the end, maybe even actually caring about?  Maybe. Seriously. It surprised me too.

This movie was really close to greatness.  With a touch of polish, maybe a faster start, or a little better framing or editing or directing or something - I don't know -  it would have been *great* - as it is? It's damn enjoyable and a lot of fun and I highly recommend it.

7747432,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"This R-rated romp (language, violence and subject matter - porn) was far better than I expected. It starts out with a bang and goes on from there. Both of the leads are much-acclaimed, but the supporting actors are pretty good, too. When a cast is led by a couple of birds (Gosling and Crowe) I guess they had better be ready to soar. I just read that they received a warm welcome at the Cannes Film Festival this year (2016).

Writer/director Shane Black (""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") with writing assistance from Anthony Bagarozzi, creates a pair of private detectives, only marginally successful, caught up in non-stop action, witty banter and great physical comedy (check out Gosling in that mens'-room stall!). The plot is cleverly crafted; I only saw one or two of the twists coming, so was surprised from beginning to end.

Part of the cast:
  * Russell Crowe (""Noah"") Jackson is a tough, never-say-die fighter. He doesn't suffer fools gladly: watch him when Holland confuses ""Munich"" and ""eunuch."" Crowe may have lost some of his sex appeal, but his acting skills are undiminished.
  * Ryan Gosling (""The Big Short"") Holland is a screw up; even his patient daughter says so. He's mostly a con man who dabbles in detective work. Gosling's comedy gets better and better: I saw him steal a bit from Abbott and Costello with nary a backward glance.
  * Angourie Rice (""Walking with Dinosaurs 3D"") Holly keeps finding her dad in one catastrophe after another. Of course she isn't above blundering into a few scrapes of her own. Maybe it was her character here, but I am REALLY impressed by this young Australian.
  * Kim Basinger (""Charlie St. Cloud"") Judith Kuttner says Amelia is her daughter and she wants her in protective custody. Kuttner prosecutes violations ranging from catalytic converters to porn.
  * Margaret Qualley (""The Leftovers"") Amelia is a actually hiding from her mother but she has something to say to the world!
  * Matt Bomer (""Magic Mike"") John Boy is also looking for Amelia and he doesn't give up. I loved his fluffy bangs in this one.
  * Lois Smith (""True Blook"") Mrs. Glenn is positive she saw her porn-star niece two days after she was reported murdered. I'm surprised Ms. Smith finds time to be in film; she's also a successful stage actress.

Each detective is hired separately to ""Find Amelia!"" Naturally they run into each other and the two of them ""detect"" their way into a whole bunch of trouble. Seems like EVERYONE wants to find Amelia... And people keep getting killed...

7747433,3,B01F5ZY4YC,"Directed by Shane Black (Iron Man 3, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) from a screenplay by Shane Black (the Lethal Weapon movies, The Last Action Hero) and Anthony Bagarozzi, The Nice Guys is something of a puzzle.  Sometimes it seems like an homage to the kind of low-budget action/crime dramas that were standard drive-in movie fare back in the 70's and of the buddy detective films that Black cut his teeth on back in the '80s. Sometimes it seems like a spoof of those films given how absurd the underlying mystery/conspiracy is and how hammy some of the acting is.  And sometimes it just seems like an incoherent mess where nobody seems sure about what kind of film they're supposed to be making.  This is one of those films where the best parts of the film were in the trailer and the actual film doesn't deliver what the trailer seemed to promise.

Set in Los Angeles in 1977, The Nice Guys opens with a boy witnessing a car crash where a porn star named Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) ends up being killed. Shortly after the accident, a rather seedy private eye, Holland March (Ryan Gosling), is approached by the aunt of Misty Mountains, Mrs. Glenn (Lois Smith) who claims to have seen her niece alive. March is skeptical but takes the case as he needs the money.  Later though he realizes that another case he's looking into, a missing girl named Amelia Kutner (Margaret Qualley), is somehow connected. Amelia, however, when she finds out March is asking questions about her, hires some professional muscle, Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe), to get March to back off. Which he does by going to March's apartment and breaking his arm. Later that night though, Healy himself is attacked at his home by two thugs (Beau Knapp and Keith David) who are looking for Amelia. After managing to chase them off with a shotgun, Healy decides he now needs to find Amelia before the thugs do, for which he needs help from a highly reluctant March. They in turn end up getting unwanted assistance from Holly (Angourie Rice), March's fourteen-year-old daughter, who openly disapproves of her father's frequent ineptness (as a father and an investigator) and more than a little sleazy work ethics but refuses to be left behind.

The film is okay up to this point but then quickly starts getting dragged down by the utter absurdity of the underlying mystery, meandering direction and scenes where it feels like the actors are having to make up things as they go.  To his credit, Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind, Gladiator) seems to know what he's doing and brings some much needed depth and consistency to his strong-arm character, giving Healey a side that shows his ability to think and keep his cool when things suddenly go south. And Angourie Rice (These Final Hours) pretty much steals every scene she's in as Holly, March's tougher-then-she-looks-but-still-a-kid daughter. But Ryan Gosling (Drive, Blue Valentine) Holland March is all over the place and seems to change from scene to scene, reaching an unrecoverable low point when, upon March's finding a dead body, he goes into a prolonged and full-blown Lou Costello (of classic Abbott & Costello fame) impression, gasping and wheezing as he tries to call for Healey, to the point that I was half-expecting him to yell out ""Hey, Abbott!""  It might've been funny if this had been a all-out comedy but in this film it was completely out of place and made it impossible to even try to take March seriously from that point on.

Only recommended for people who need to kill a couple of hours and don't much care about what they watch to do it.",1466380800,9,3575,4.753225806451613
7747434,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) has a reputation for beating people up. He does it for a living and enjoys punching out vermin. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a private detective and has had a drinking problem since his wife died. He is raising his 13 year old daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) on his own. When porn star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) dies in an wild automobile accident, it sets off an investigation for Amelia (?) who may or may not be Misty and may or may not be dead. A mystery develops for our quirky characters to decipher while we get to enjoy likeable characters with humorous dialogue.

The film takes place in 1977 and contains anachronisms, perhaps the most recognizable was the KISS song off their iconic 1979 album, a rookie error anyone under 40 could make. Enjoyable for those who love their indie films. 4 1/2 stars

Ryan Gosling (The Big Short) shows a whole new side as Holland March, a stumbling private detective and single parent to his precocious daughter Holly, played by Austrialian teen, Angourie Rice. I remember her from an excellent film from her native country called These Final Hours (2013). She is terrific in that film and here with her perfect American accent. At times she seems to be the only adult in the room. Holland, through a comedy of errors hooks up with Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe), an independent goon enforcer. Someone you hire to beat someone up. Who knew?

The trio is hired to track down a 20-something daughter (Margaret Qualley, TVs The Leftovers) who made a porno but for altruistic purposes. Shes also the daughter of Judith Kuttner, the assistant district attorney (Kim Basinger, who co-starred with Crowe in L. A. Confidential (1997)). What makes the movie special is the surprising chemistry between Gosling and Crowe. They are hilarious at times. Gosling also brings out a great impression of Lou Costello from the iconic comedy team, Abbott and Costello.

Matt Bomer comes in late in the film as a prolific hired killer from Detroit known as John Boy who has a large mole on his cheek as did his namesake from TVs The Waltons played by Richard Thomas. There are plenty of these little references that will keep you chuckling when not laughing out loud. The films final act does resort to the usual Hollywood gunfights. The type where the good guys cannot be shot, even while running in plain sight and the bad guys have automatic weapons. Thats a minor quibble in this terrific film.

I should also mention the great soundtrack of music of the era. The film opens with the long intro of Papa Was a Rollin Stone by The Temptations which is a perfect mood setter. Youll also get clips from such diversified artists as Earth Wind & Fire, Al Green, The Bee Gees, Kiss, The Band, America and others. Recommended.",1464739200,2,2301,4.745

7747440,3,B01F5ZY4YC,"I was excited to see this film. So it pains me to say I had a difficult time sitting through the entire running. Ryan Gosling is always compelling to watch, and Russel Crowe is fast losing his charm. However if you enjoy a big shout out to the seventies, including shots of a very smoggy L.A., and shots of the gas lines we all endured then there may be something for you here. The script is pretty silly, and I get that it is supposed to be, but Gosling especially is asked to stretch his best ""Abbot and Costello"" muscles in a few scenes. I won't add any spoilers, but there is not a lot of tension in the film to spoil. It's goofy, sometimes funny, and while Crowe doesn't do much as the straight guy - Gosling as always is adorable - even as a goofy detective in a bad suit. There was not as much chemistry between Crowe, and Gosling as I expected, and the plot (while an important statement) gets pretty silly (Kim Bassinger as head of the Justice Department?). There is a great ""bang em up"" action scene toward the end, and that is worth waiting for. I wish I had liked it more. This is the first film in years for which I made a theater visit - I don't suppose I regret it, 9.50 ticket, and five dollar bottle of water not withstanding.",1464480000,3,1243,4.205020920502092
7747441,1,B01F5ZY4YC,"Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe both are superb actors. They are not the problem with this movie. The script for this comedy is sorely lacking.......save yourself some money and watch the trailers for this movie. All of the funny gags, lines, and situations are found here. I swear there's nothing else funny in the movie. Movie could be compressed into 30 minutes.",1464307200,8,364,4.887096774193548
7747442,5,B01F5ZY4YC,"What a story!!! Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a down-on-his-luck private eye in 1977 Los Angeles. Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a hired enforcer who hurts people for a living. Fate turns them into unlikely partners after a young woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley) mysteriously disappears. Healy and March soon learn the hard way that some dangerous people are also looking for Amelia. Their investigation takes them to dark places as anyone else who gets involved in the case seems to wind up dead.

This film is what P.T. Andersons Inherent Vice should have been! It has everything  complex mystery, humor, A+ acting, action, drama and most importantoriginality and STYLE! I applaud the attention to detail. Everything within just shouted 1977, but in such a subtle way. You won't see anyone with Star Wars shirts, hauling pet rocks or listening to Disco. You will see the essence of the decade within lower middle class clothing, hair, automobiles and furnishings. You will see the rich, dark underbelly of Los Angeles within the excesses of the era. Its as if director Shane Black found something that P.T. Anderson lost a long time ago in regards to capturing this time period.

Gosling and Crowe are a match made in heaven and I really hope there is a sequel here, as the ending is set up for the possibility. Holland March is probably the first irresponsibly attentive father weve seen on screen, inasmuch as the way Gosling plays him out to make him so relatable. Crowes character of Healy is the exact opposite in that hes super responsible yet uncaring. Its a unique relationship that lends itself to some of the best laugh out loud moments as well as the more serious, sentimental side of things.

Matt Bomers villainous John Boy is two dimensional, but intentional! Haha! In a film where friends are enemies and enemies are friends, his straightforward ruthlessness gives this picture its very own Bond or Indiana Jones over-the-top bad guy. He plays it up extremely well and makes his scenes fun to watch. I have to give a special shout out to Angourie Rice, who plays Goslings daughter. She is magnificent and yet another uber talented child actor this year has produced. Her character epitomizes the best qualities of both March and Healy, exuding empathy to create a bond between them.

Sadly, I now turn to Kim Basinger who wasted her own time here. She phoned in her performance, which shocked the Hell out of me because shes usually so committed to everything she does. As a huge fan of hers, I was disappointed. Luckily, her screen time is minimal and doesnt take away from the enjoyment of the rest of the picture. Veteran actors Lois Smith (East Of Eden) and Gil Gerard (Buck Rogers, himself) turn in finely tuned, hilarious performances to boot!

Again, Im really hoping for a sequel or SEQUELS to this fine film. Theres so much more to explore with the relationship between these two men. Theyre like the Starsky and Hutch for 2016but if Starsky and Hutch were actually funny and cool! Go see this one!",1464307200,43,3033,4.811900191938579
7747443,4,B01F5ZY4YC,"I was reading some reviews on IMDB, and Whoa!, some people really did not like this movie. I went in without any expectations, and just sat back, and enjoyed a detective noir comedy.

So many people were nitpicking about the music being played in the movie not being out yet in 1977 or that Jaws 2 wasn't out yet. It makes me wonder how many of these people actually knew the release date of these things, or Googled them after (hopefully not during) the movie. To me this is a bit extreme, just enjoy and take in the groovy sounds of the 70s/early 80s.

I loved the combo of an enforcer (Crowe) and an alcoholic P.I. (Gosling) that seems out of it, but is actually very observant. I thought they worked well together. They bickered like an old, married couple. It was just the perfect amount to make it amusing, and not annoying.

The story itself was well done, with lots of twists and turns. And if any part of this was true, it just goes to show how corrupt the government was, even back 40 plus years ago. At times the plot may have gone to extremes (a young girl at a wild party watching porn), but I thought it fit the theme of the story. Life is hard, you see things you cant unsee, and people aren't always around to protect you, so you have to do the best with what you have.

I think Angourie Rice, who played Goslings daughter, stole the movie for me. She was like a non-naive Nancy Drew. While her dad and partner were bickering or floundering around, she jumped right in and did what was needed. It will be interesting to watch her in more movies, and to see if she does as well in them.

All in all, a fun summer movie. A crime noir, packed with physical comedy and lots of nudity and graphic violence. Four of my favorite things!",1464307200,61,1745,4.275757575757575

The plot is interesting, and comprehensible, which often isn't the case with noir films, when they try to be too clever, or too coy.
