Except for a brief stint in THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1936 and a couple of voiced-over cartoon shorts, CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK marks the only screen appearance for the most popular team in early American radio. The movie itself is now considered un-PC by some for its stereotyped portrayal of African-Americans by corked-up white men.

SYNOPSIS--
The struggling taxi business of Amos Jones (Gosden) and Andrew Brown (Correll) gets a boost when they're hired to transport Duke Ellington's band to a Westchester high society party. The orchestra performs several numbers. At their lodge meeting, A&A are chosen to retrieve a paper marked ""Check and Double Check"" from a supposedly haunted house. Instead they locate in the creepy mansion a missing deed that can potentially help the son of their former employer.

8397780,2,B003J21SAW,"This WIN PRODUCTIONS DVD is curious and highly suspect.

There was no AMOS 'N' ANDY TV show in 1944, nor did Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (pictured here all corked up) appear in the early 50s television sitcom. (Amos Jones was played by Alvin Childress and Andy 'Hogg' Brown was Spencer Williams.)

The three episodes divided into parts on this item's Editorial Review (""Invisible Glass,"" ""The Gun"" and ""Kingfish Gets Drafted"") are single-episode programs that run 25 minutes each. As for ""the best episodes of Amos & Andy,"" that's a matter of opinion. They're typical A&A shows, to be sure.

I doesn't know 'bout dis one, Andy!",1289865600,,634,4.906542056074766
