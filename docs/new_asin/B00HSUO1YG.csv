6208151,5,B00HSUO1YG,"Charming! That's the one word that comes to my mind for Lady Morigham's delightful teaching of bellydance in the much-loved vintage style. I was captivated from the start - and that's when I've been fonder of modern bellydance and newer styles like tribal fusion. But just about every dancer I know has longed to dance like the stars from the golden era of bellydance from the 60's and 70's.
I can't say how true to the old style Lady M's choreography is, but I can say that I really thought it charming, feminine, playful, relaxed, spontaneous, and ever so graceful.
If that's enough adjectives, let's see what's on this DVD.
As is the right thing to do, we start with a nice refreshing warm up. It's languid and stretchy enough to put you in the mood to dance gracefully. I could tell from the very warm up that this is a program that's better suited to intermediate dancers; someone who's already dancing frequently and is no stranger to isolations, basic moves and styles. A beginner could follow along, but I'd recommend just taking care not to execute any moves to the fullest and not pushing, just to be on the safer side.
The warm up is short but good enough as we move into the main instruction. This is totally straightforward. There are three dances and they're indicated in three sessions on the menu. There's a step-by-step instruction and a practice - and we move to the next chunk. Each of the dances obviously has quite a number of combinations and Lady M deals with each in turn, explaining and running though once. The instruction moves fast, even though the basics are briefly explained. A beginner can learn much just by watching while the more advanced dancer can confirm and refresh each of the moves as she describes it. A beginner video would have included slower instruction and more repetitions with careful counting out etc. So, you need to be at the level where you can keep up. The dances are all connected and set to Eddie the Sheikh Kochak's easily recognized music - it's all very mystique-filled and pretty and is a perfect choice because it's readily available.
The three step-by-step and practice sessions, filled as they are with combinations, end up in a Dance Along section which is simply the whole dance with no cues or anything. Another clue that this is for those able to keep up rather than require several sessions of cued hand-holding.
Lady M comes across as nice and unselfconscious. I like that she isn't trying to be anything but who she is. It can get so annoying when a dancer-instructor is so bothered about how she's coming across that she fills every moment with mannerisms. Instead of having to figure out how not to get annoyed with that, you have the chance to pick up lots of styling along with the steps as she goes about teaching you the choreo. Once again, I'd say, charming.

6208152,5,B00HSUO1YG,"Vintage belly dance is all about glamorous stylization, graceful, flowing combinations and lovely gestures that decorate even the simplest movement. I thoroughly enjoyed learning the choreographies and one in particular, ""The Sensual Chifit.""
I was very pleased to work with this phenomenal program. It embraces  the sensuality, playfulness, and feminine movement that first  lured me into belly dance many decades ago.  I personally love the vintage styling with its flirtiness and playfulness, and sensuality.
This program is beautifully presented by the lovely Lady M. It begins with a very thorough warm-up that will stretch and awaken upper and lower body to prepare for belly dance.
Three choreographies follow with complete breakdown in combination movement and Lady M defines  the verses for dance with and without music.  The follow along program is simple to understand as Lady M uses her own terminology to illustrate movement. A very relaxing cool down completes the program.
 If you are a beginner to belly dance, getting the basics from an instructional video may be helpful before this as there is much layering involved. Some of the personal terminology for movement is in contrast to many variations out there however the dance movement is vividly illustrated.
I realize after working with this program how much I miss the beautiful stylization that I learned during my first years as a belly dancer.  Many thanks to this program, I have learned to appreciate it even more. I sincerely hope there is more of this in the future!",1398124800,3,1544,5.176706827309237
6208153,4,B00HSUO1YG,"I love the aesthetic of this video.  Some of the moves are advanced for me as a beginner/maybe intermediate beginner.  I wish Lady Morrighan would make another one of these Vintage Belly Dance DVD's for beginners/intermed. beginners like me that would also be a good workout to work up a sweat.  This video did make me work up a sweat, and I appreciated the warm up and cool down, but there was something missing for me; thus, only 4 stars.  I would recommend it though, because I think it's lovely, and better dancers would find the moves easier than me.",1398124800,3,555,4.52
6208154,5,B00HSUO1YG,"Finally somebody did it!  The fantastic music of Eddie Kochak, and the flowing style of the golden age of bellydance before the self centered mega-isolations took over.

3 short choreographed dances with a practice session, about 4 combinations per dance, then puts them all together in one flowing performance where you can dance along.

Does a great job of capturin the happy, flowing style of that era.  The combinations shown in this video can easily be used with improvisation to other music, which is NOT something I can say for the majority of choreographies taught in bellydance videos today, the others are too specific to that particular piece of music in the video.  This one is enormously adaptable.  Would love to see more along these lines from Lady Morrighan.",1396742400,17,774,4.961240310077519
6208155,5,B00HSUO1YG,"This is an excellent instruction DVD that I would place at an intermediate level, because of the multiple isolations that occur at a nice tempo, which take a little experience and body control to achieve. Lady M of course, looks like an undulating goddess doing these moves, and I love the sepia colored performance sections where she looks like a movie star from the `50s.

After the Welcome, there's a really stretchy Warm-up, and then we get into the 3 choreographic pieces. The 2nd one is the slowest, if you want to start out easy, and the 3rd is my favorite, with its little hop step. At the end Lady M dances all 3 pieces as a single dance in sequence, and it is lovely. This DVD is a refreshing look into the past of the belly dance art form, when it was all about joy, beauty and glamour.

The disc ends with a smooth cool down, that is relaxing and releases any tension that might have built up in your muscles during the learning process of the 3 dances. All the music is by the famed Eddie ""The Sheik"" Kochak, a pioneer in belly dance music.
There is also an added bonus of a sneak peek into some other dance instruction DVDs released by World Dance New York.",1396483200,17,1171,4.342465753424658
8635627,4,B00HSUO1YG,"I really like the older music, dance styling & costuming.  This is a good DVD; however, as is common with instructional DVDs, the choreographies are short.  I put them all together, once each through in the ""practice"" sessions, followed by once all together, and that only amounted to 15 minutes of dancing.  Luckily I had another DVD ready to pop in to finish my workout.  I wish more dance teachers would give a full 30 minutes of dancing on their DVDs.  The ones I have that are like that - I used them a lot more often!",1517011200,,523,4.350515463917525

8635631,5,B00HSUO1YG,"Her dancing is beautiful! I can't quite master the techniques just yet, as I'm very much a beginner, but I'm picking them up little by little, and just watching her choreography is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I'd definitely recommend this to friends who want to learn a new belly dance choreography.",1457222400,,306,5.019607843137255
8635632,4,B00HSUO1YG,Good instruction well done. Excellent demonstrations. I remember this style fairly well and enjoy it.,1431820800,,101,5.8
8635633,3,B00HSUO1YG,"I must say, I was kind of disappointed. It says technique and styling, but it's just choreography. I like it when the instructors talk about what they're doing. Discuss styling and such. I expected a little more history I guess. I expected more something. It's just 3 choreographies. I remember reading something about each dance having a different mood, but she doesn't introduce the dances at all or talk about what mood they are. It's just combos and then a demo. After buying stuff with Sarah Skinner, Ranya Renee, and Blanca, I expected more substance. I wanted more about the style itself, something I could used to build my own routines, rather than just 3 choreographed dances.

It's definitely not for beginners. There is no technique section. You need to be familiar with belly dance and have an idea of what you're doing before trying this program, because it is choreography and not really an instruction DVD.",1416096000,11,921,4.86624203821656
8635634,4,B00HSUO1YG,"This video is a unique product that deserves a review.  First, let me clarify that the word ""vintage"" here applies equally to the music (Eddie Kochak) but even moreso to the movements, which you will recognize from the Egyptian greats of the golden era.  Although the music here is commonly associated with ""vintage orientale"" dancing (previously known as American Cabaret), Lady Morrigan's dance style draws heavily from the Egyptian stars of the 40s, 50s, and 60s such as Samia Gamal, Naima Akef, Tahia Carioca and Sohair Zaki (who she resembles at times).  As an aside, Morrigan most closely resembles actress Jessica Pare, who plays Meghan Draper on Mad Men, further adding to the retro feel.

The movements go well with the music, something I really value on dance instruction.  There is also ""soul"" in the movements - depending on how you execute them of course, but unlike some dance instruction which ends up feeling mechanical, there is a lot of room for interpretation and feeling in these gorgeous vintage moves.  I was excited to be learning movements I had seen on the Golden age dancers but hadn't known myself.  I took notes on a few that I plan to work into a choreography so that they can become part of my repertoire.  I especially liked ""Two Lovers"" and, as hard as it was, the ""nifty chifte"".  Her cute names for each combination added to the charm of the DVD.

In terms of level, I would say that it is more advanced. The material moves quickly and you are expected to be able to execute moves quickly, while layering other movements and travelling.

Unfortunately I do have some quibbles with this DVD's instruction.  First, she spends more time explaining the most basic moves of bellydance (a shimmy, a ""tush push"") than she does the more complicated turns and travelling steps.  For a DVD of this level, that was surprising - also, because I was expecting that if she was bothering to call out these moves, she was going to be teaching something non-standard, it surprised me that most of the time, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary (for a dancer with Egyptian-style training).  Sometimes however there were explanations of movements that are _particular_ to the golden era dancers and I appreciated that, as I did when she said who the move was inspired of.  (I wish she had done more of that, actually).  I also liked that she taught variations to add more feeling or intention to a movement.

Secondly, travelling steps are best taught with feet first, then adding additional movements. It is hard to tell what she is doing while she is already layering on hips and arms.  If the feet were taught first, then the hips, then the arms, I believe it would be easier to learn. I was intrigued by the mysterious look and feel of these travelling steps. Unfortunately, they remain as mysterious to me as they do to the audience.  I will have to watch and re-watch several times, and having attended many workshops and classes, i can say that the technique to teach feet and weight changes first is recognized as being very effective - but it wasn't used here.  That makes the material present more of a challenge than it would otherwise.

In a DVD, I enjoy more chances to practice what I am learning, and I was glad that each combination was set to music, and then each music was done repeatedly to music when following along to a full song, which also offered an opportunity to see how these movements would fit into a larger dance.

The performances have an ""old film"" effect applied, in an effort to appear more vintage. Unfortunately this can obscure careful observation of the dance (just as it does on old films today), and I wish it hadn't been done.

But only a few quibbles.  Lady Morrigan really has grasped the essence of the golden era dancers, and her style is lovely to watch. I had never heard of her before, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I can say now that I would enjoy a performance of hers.",1409443200,23,3944,4.633620689655173
8635635,5,B00HSUO1YG,"Superb breakdown and demonstration of Egyptian belly dance from the 1940s-50s. Excellent analysis of steps, floor patterns, & arm stylization. I've spent many hours watching videos of the famous dancers from this era. Also, I've taken several workshops on this topic by some well known current dancers. All were good, but this video is the best depiction I've seen by a modern dancer. Highly recommended!",1403913600,4,404,5.230769230769231
8635636,4,B00HSUO1YG,"If you have EVER had an interest in vintage bellydance this DVD is for you. It is not for beginners, so know the basics first. But this is the only DVD of this kind I have been able to find that really teaches you a choreography with the look, sound, and feel of vintage bellydance. I love it!!!!",1403481600,4,296,4.120689655172414
