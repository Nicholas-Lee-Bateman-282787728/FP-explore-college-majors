487077,5,6302593107,"I first saw this movie on the Lifetime for Women network channel. I thought it was a touching and heartwarming story of a family trying to stay connected despite tragedy and obstacles. It is so refreshing to see African-Americans depicted as what they are: flesh and blood human beings. I rarely see this movie run during the holiday season. I am so glad I was able to purchase this video through an Amazon seller in order that my children see Christmas and the holiday spirit reflected in their beautiful Black images. The movie can be a little over the top with drama, but aren't most holiday movies? This movie needs to be on DVD. I loved the acting and the message of unconditional love and family.",1198108800,18,702,4.579365079365079

Christmas is a time for hope and that is the main message. Good movie anytime of year but especially poignant at Christmas.",1390348800,,218,4.7368421052631575
487090,5,6302593107,"I found this movie several years ago at a thrift store.  I finally watched it one day and thought it was a good movie. Then last year, I watched it again and really thought it was an excellent movie. This year I caught it on TVOne, a channel designed for African American viewing. Thankfully they showed it and now I have it on DVR. Simply put, this is an outstanding movie. The young child is played by actor Trent Cameron. This kid has got Charisma and you can't help but like him. The rest of the cast is superb including Della Reese, Cicely Tyson, Ben Vereen, Sammy Davis, Esther Rolle and many others. Each plays their character extremely well, especially Esther Rolle, who has to play the ""bad guy"". This movie is a definite sleeper and seems to grow in popularity every year. It teaches us about what the word ""family"" really means and how difficult it is for some people to overcome their past. The DVD release of it in the US is a must! It is just a good old feel good Christmas movie. Do yourself a favor and watch it. You'd have to be a Scrooge not to love it.",1388016000,4,1071,4.275862068965517
