8445378,5,B004WO9OPW,"Thank you Amazon for providing a way to acquire products that I wanted to have and enjoy so very much, so, they mean a lot to me and the Amazon company means a lot to me for being the source of my knowing I can purchase products that may be very difficult to buy by going from here to there by foot or bus or car to sometimes aimlessly search for things I would like to use.  I do like to support local and farther stores and I do when possible, but I know I have the joy of watching and rewatching Pahappahooey Island stories which convey Bibical outstanding lessons.  The battery I bought works so well.  I think I should have bought two, but I do not know how long they last.  I can ask at U.S. Cellular.  This battery made it easy on me.  It saved me from getting a new cell phone and took relieved me of the thought of that, too.
  So, thank you at Amazon for all you do to help so many, many people and especially any who may have a difficult time to get places to shop and/or cannot get anywhere to shop.  God bless you and your families and all you do.
  Sincerely, Jeannine Valentino",1365811200,,1092,4.07981220657277
