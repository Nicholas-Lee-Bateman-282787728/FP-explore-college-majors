8743304,2,B018XB1X08,"this dvd is unlike other Mike Donavanik workout videos.  He rushes too much and doesn't go over the moves before hand so that you can see what you are doing before you do it.  Although it is still pretty tough, I enjoy the 45 minute videos much better.",1476316800,,252,4.229166666666667
8743305,5,B018XB1X08,Like the previous reviewer I can't believe there are not more reviews for this DVD.  I have all of Mike Donavanik's DVDs and they are all great but this one is the best yet! More 30 minute workouts like this please! Then there is a second DVD included with 4 more time efficient workouts! Whenever I do this DVD my heart is pumping and my muscles are sore all in 30 minutes! I can't wait until he comes out with the next one!,1467936000,,425,4.120481927710843

8743307,5,B018XB1X08,"I have read and relied on countless reviews for Amazon products, but this is the first review I've written because I can't believe there have not been any reviews yet!  This workout DVD is absolutely amazing!  I have all of Mike's other DVD's and believe they are all incredible workouts and offer great variety.  The 2 workouts on this DVD blow the others away, because they are time efficient at 30 minutes each, and keep your heart rate up the entire time while working your whole body and moving in all ranges of motion.  As always, he ends with a challenging ab sequence.  I use mostly 10 pound weights, but go down to 8 pounds for one exercise in each workout.  I have tried almost every workout DVD out there, and this one is at the top for me!",1461283200,7,751,4.366906474820144
