And just a couple weeks later, Pete Rose smashed into Ray Fosse to score the winning run in the All-Star Game, which was played at the just-opened Riverfront.

1970 was truly the beginning of the ""Big Red Machine"" era of the Cincinnati Reds' ball club.  With an impressive record of 102-60 during the regular season (including an amazing 70-30 after their first hundred games), the Reds easily coasted to the N.L. West crown, beating out their nearest contenders (the Dodgers) by an immense 14.5 games!

Sparky Anderson's steam-rolling Reds then swept the Pittsburgh Pirates, 3-0, in the N.L. Championship Series. And it was on to the World Series, for the first time in nine years for Cincy.

Earl Weaver's Baltimore Orioles, led by the Robinson boys (Brooks and ex-Red Frank), and a very strong pitching staff, proved to be too much for the Reds to handle in the '70 Series.  The Birds tamed my Reds (*sniff, sniff*) in just five games.

Brooks Robinson looked much more like George Reeves (aka: ""Superman"") during this World Series, continually robbing Reds' hitters (Johnny Bench in particular) of base hits with incredible diving stops. Plus: Brooks did it with the stick as well, batting .429 to win Series' MVP honors (with 9 hits, 2 homers, and 6 RBIs).

The Reds would go on to literally ""own"" the decade of the 1970s, winning a total of 6 divisional titles, 4 Pennants, and 2 World Championships in those ten years. Six of the ten National League MVPs during the 1970s wore a Cincinnati uniform.

Games 1 and 2 of this Series were held at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, referred to in this video by narrator Curt Gowdy as a ""breathtaking baseball plant"". And I agree -- Riverfront was a great place to watch a baseball game, IMO. You could watch the ""Big Red Machine"" win game after game from the very first row of the Blue Seats (Field Level) for just $4.00 a ticket! Holy smokes, four bucks nowadays won't even buy you a frankfurter -- let alone get you a seat in the front row!  LOL!  Oh, well. Times change.

For the trivia experts, games one and two at Cincy represented the first World Series games ever played on artificial turf.

This VHS Tape runs for approx. 40 minutes, with veteran announcer Curt Gowdy guiding us through the five Series games. Good-quality video clips are used throughout the official ""MLB"" program. Watching it puts me right back there again.  A very good video (even though my team was punished severely by those doggone Birds of Baltimore).  :)

As good as the Reds were for the whole of the 1970s, they would have to wait another five years to finally bask in the light of a World Series victory, when Cincy beat the Boston Red Sox in the 1975 Series, in what many [this writer included] believe to be the greatest World Series ever played.

The Redlegs followed up the '75 triumph with another Series win, shutting down the New York Yankees completely in '76.

If you can find a copy of this Official 1970 World Series video (from ""Major League Baseball Home Video""), I'd recommend grabbing it.",1084752000,,3210,4.7428057553956835
7833726,4,630298677X,"The Miracle Mets winning the 1969 World Series was such an upset of epic proportions that a lot of people forget the Baltimore Orioles got right back to the Fall Classic the following year and defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games. Earl Weaver's team did it with a pitching staff that consisted of three 20-game winners: Mike Cuellar and Dave McNally both won 24 games and Jim Palmer won 20 even. The rest of the line-up consisted of power from M.V.P. Boog Powell and Frank Robinson, and great defense from Paul Blair and Mark Belanger, with Brooks Robinson providing both. With a pair of home runs the Orioles third baseman cemented his reputation as the human vacuum cleaner with his amazing play in the field. The 1970 Cincinnati team was still one trade away from the beginnings of the big Red Machine, but Pete Rose, Tony Perez, and Johnny Bench were already in place, but combined their batting averages flirted with the fabled Mendoza line.
After the Reds dropped a pair of one-run games at home, Baltimore blew them away at home. But the Reds showed a lot of character by avoiding the sweep with a hard fought 6-5 win in Game 4 before Baltimore finished them off. After Frank Robinson joined the Orioles in 1966 and shocked everyone by sweeping the Dodgers in the World Series the Orioles were an American League powerhouse for almost ten years.  But the 1970 Championship was the only other title they won. This video provides highlights of the series, giving all due attention to the magician with the glove at third for the Orioles. Certainly a great trip down memory lane for fans of the birds, but for baseball fans there is the rather novel sight of defensive plays being the biggest highlights on a recap of a World Series.  Still, it is hard to believe that this was the only World Series ring that Earl Weaver won in his managing career.  Note: Palmer won the third and final game of the A.L. Division series and then started Game 1 of the World Series. Neat trick, huh?  Ah, the joys of scheduling post season games.",1049500800,,2039,4.6088154269972454
