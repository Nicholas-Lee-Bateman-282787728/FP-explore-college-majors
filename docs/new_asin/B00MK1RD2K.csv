8672802,5,B00MK1RD2K,This is an EXCELLENT series and I have ordered many of the episodes. It gives you a wonderful insight into the many artists around this country who are unsung but deserving of recognition. I can say this because our daughter is in one of the upcoming episodes and introduced us to this eye-opening series. She has met the producer and has great admiration and respect for her and her mission to introduce us to the world of art.,1421193600,,428,4.5
