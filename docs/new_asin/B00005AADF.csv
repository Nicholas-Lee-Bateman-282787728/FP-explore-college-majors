Given the guest in this video, one would expect more of a professional interview in a more attractive and suitable location (flies buzzing David's face during the interview? come on!!). However, if you can overlook the terrible quality, which is due to the incompetence of the video crew and editor, and focus on the speaker, David Adair's story is incredible. He has enough proof to back up his story, and there's no reason, NO REASON, whatsoever, for a man of his intellect to make up a story like this, which would do nothing but harm his reputation. I believe him.",1188432000,6,618,4.678899082568807

I believe that Adair's story makes for great science fiction, but that is all.",1161648000,2,276,5.441860465116279
7935192,5,B00005AADF,"Being a UFO investigator I highly recommend this video for any collector . Adair tells it all. I wish more people like him would tell their stories and get them out into the public, so that everyone can know what is really going on under the noises of US citizens and govt officials alike.",1131667200,8,289,4.37037037037037
