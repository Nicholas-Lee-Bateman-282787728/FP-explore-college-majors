It is seperate stories that all have to do with aspects of these cats lives.
If you like documentories about life in Africa, you will like this.",1308268800,4,219,4.238095238095238
4384801,5,B004I9SJGQ,"I've seen these on cable tv multiple times, but still love owning them and watching them whenever I can.  Am a lover of the big cats and all cats, and never tire of watching them.",1374710400,,179,4.114285714285714
4384802,5,B004I9SJGQ,"The product arrived on time. I am happy with the product. I was very happy with the treatment of the lions, but I wish they had more on the tigers. I guess Tigers are much harder to photograph.",1374624000,,193,4.105263157894737
4384803,5,B004I9SJGQ,I enjoyed these movies sitting there watching them.  But I also like to have them playing as I move and work around inside the house.  It is great to renew memories and have something worth listening to in the background.,1364256000,2,221,4.5
4384804,3,B004I9SJGQ,I expected Big Cat Collection to be the equivalent of Animal Planet's Big Cat Diaries. It in no way lived up to my expectations.,1357948800,,128,4.375
4384805,1,B004I9SJGQ,"As an avid nature film fan who grew up in the era of Jacques Cousteau and National Geographic TV, I have been excited to bring my own children to these wonderful panoramas of the world. My 7 year old son and I ordered the Big Cats Collection together, as they have always been his favorite animal.

A conscientious parent, I thought I had read all the background on this multi-disc program. They arrived in the mail, and I and my son, who, not being a child  built for violent action films (unlike many of his buddies), was just as excited as I was to be sitting down to a film about big cats. He watched in silence and I watched in shock as National Geographic Big Cats Collection showed two young men chased down, attacked, and killed by lions. He looked at me after the authorities shot the animals and the camera gave a view of the dead young men lying face down on the ground.

I appreciate that these things happen in our world, and I suppose that today in our society we value ""reality"" over propriety, and I suppose that's fine for others to choose. Without a warning, a note, or a tip off anywhere related to this film, I was not able to make a choice. Strange to avoid gratuitous violence in the media and fill our need for entertainment with a tried and true, not to mention family-oriented (read: safe for children) genre, only to discover that National Geographic is no safer from a display of sudden, inexplicable human death than my kid would have seen in the Batman films.

I know, grow up, old fuddy-duddy, right?

A simple sentence on the box, on Amazon, somewhere that a parent can see it and make a decision that makes sense for his family. I'm still wondering several hours after shutting off the film midstream how eating people on screen helps the viewing audience understand cat anatomy and physiology, which is the segment that this unexpected clip was played in. I don't believe that Marlin Perkins would approve, that David Attenborough would deem it necessary, and I'm stunned that National Geographic wouldn't, if any thing else, allow us to make an informed decision before our little kids sit down on the couch, the same ones who are happily NOT seeing so-and-so get his head ripped off by a what-ever-it-is. I keep thinking that I must have missed the warning somewhere.

My wife tucked our son in tonight, and he asked her, ""Do we have any lions around here, Mommy?""

I know, grow up, old fuddy-duddy, right?",1345420800,5,2441,4.559360730593608
4384806,4,B004I9SJGQ,My wife loves to watch the cats but refuses to own a kitten. We watch this one at least once a month especially when sports rule the airwaves.,1332633600,,142,4.107142857142857
4384807,4,B004I9SJGQ,"I have only seen one of the programs,but it is interesting.  It is sad though to see how threatened these cats are.  If you like big cats it seems worth seeing.",1326326400,4,160,4.129032258064516
4384808,5,B004I9SJGQ,"This DVD set is simply Amazing and the picture quality is looks like HD so clear , and it's 5.1 surround sound feature , it's really worth for the price. I recommend this to everyone !",1325548800,,184,4.138888888888889
4384809,3,B004I9SJGQ,"In the days of LD and VHS NG produced a wide range of interesting reports that concentrated on the animals. Recently there has been a trend towards talking more and more about the background and the people involved, so much so that the animals are almost coming second. This release is entitled Big Cats but in reality is as much about the Jouberts, the Masai and government politics. That is all very well but in no way does this compare with the vividly close to nature presentations from the BBC. A large part of the video is from SD recordings many years ago and the overall video quality is far below say Planet Earth and overall not much better than a DVD. The editing was a bit hit and miss and the subtitles and program advertising from the Lion Warriors segment was particularly muddled and poorly finished.
Overall I was unimpressed and for the price I found it poor value and NOT something I would pop in the player to get closer to say the Lions who were by far the main actors in this series. Tigers who feature on the box hardly appear in the videos. Having said all that the second presentation on the Leopard Queen was by far the best and the only one I am likely to repeat. Rent perhaps but I regard this as not worth a purchase and following on from a sloppy Great Migrations and a rather ordinary Relentless Enemies from the same source I feel the NG nature videos are now no longer competitive. The BBC is just so far ahead and increasing their lead with every release. Pity really as my old NG LDs still give me pleasure but of course the picture quality is now very dated.",1320278400,27,1594,4.37037037037037
4384810,5,B004I9SJGQ,"This collection is very well done. There are 5 programs that are included and I will rate each one.

-Big Cat Odyssey ****
Very nice documentary. Four out of five stars because it gives you the depressing facts about lion's shrinking numbers. Other than that, very nice shots and a cool story.

-Leopard Queen ********************
My favorite. Such an amazing story about a leopard that the cameraman became uniquelly attached to. This special is the best out of the collection. Made you walk away feeling good.

-Lion Warriors **
Not the best. This one is about African tribes and their struggle against lions that kill their livestock, so they kill the lions. Made me kinda angry at the tribes for attacking endangered animals, but whatever. This is why its 2 out of five stars.

-Lions on the Edge *****
Great story about lions surviving a severe drought. Does get depressing at one point, but if you just keep repeating ""its just the natural cycle"" you will get through it. Very well done and very good story. Five out of five.

-Ultimate Cat *****
This is a pretty cool show about the toughest, and best cat on earth. Includes all cats and is very informative about hunting and behavior. Five out of five.

All in all, great collection for the price. I really enjoy it, and if you are already prepared for National Geographic's sometimes harsh reality in the documentaries, you will love it too.",1317686400,19,1400,4.717213114754099

8430397,5,B004I9SJGQ,Bought this for my husband - we just watched the second DVD tonight - I did not want to review this until I watched all the discs.  The first DVD has 3 episodes. The first 2 are great - the third not so much.  The third is a lot about humans and less about Big Cats than I prefer - I shut it off in the middle. The second DVD was very good - pretty much followed one pride through 6 months. Jr.'s story was sad.,1399248000,,411,3.7674418604651163
8430398,4,B004I9SJGQ,"I bought this to replace a DVD which I lost.  I use this to show how lions bond and hunt..  Not as concise for my needs and in some places too graphic for classroom use, especially with youger student.  Overall, it is well done, in the National Geographic tradition.",1393459200,,266,4.387755102040816
8430399,2,B004I9SJGQ,"The film pounded over and over the death of these animals in detailed, gruesome ways.  A little bit goes a long ways.  Also, I thought more of the big cats would be shown.  The attacks and killings shown are not appropriate for young children to be observing.",1392076800,,259,4.468085106382978
