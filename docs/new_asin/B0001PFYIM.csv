8015995,5,B0001PFYIM,"Great workout for upper body and arms.  In this tape, he uses the Richard Simmon's Tonin' Rings.  The tape is around thirty eight minutes long and features the songs ""Wooly Bully"", ""The Stripper"", ""Baby Love"", ""Can't Help Myself"", ""Hang on Sloopy"", ""Unchained Melody"" and ""Where Did Our Love Go"".  Wish they would release it on dvd.  As always, Richard is fun and motivational.",1201737600,5,377,4.936507936507937
8015996,5,B0001PFYIM,"Another tape from Richard Simmons that gives you a good workout, despite looking simple.  For this tape, you will need the Richard Simmon Tonin' Rings.  It is around thirty eight minutes long.  It includes songs ""Wooly Bully"", ""The Stripper"", ""Baby Love"", ""Can't Help Myself"", ""Hang On Sloopy"", ""Unchained Melody"" and ""Where Did Our Love Go"" from a group that looks and sounds similar to the Supremes.  Entertaining and Fun!  Just wish they were released on dvd.",1201737600,2,462,5.026315789473684
