I was expecting an into the woods parody with sexy women and stupid jokes. But this was way more of a softcore porn than the back of the box seems to think.
The cameo of who plays merlin is brilliant though.",1438041600,3,246,4.145833333333333
7028292,1,B00U2YNMKO,This movie is not sexy it's SEXUAL. It's pornographic. The sound is not good. The music is hidden between the other sounds. I wish I could get my money back.,1436054400,3,157,4.266666666666667

8704245,1,B00U2YNMKO,"If we could give this ""film"" zero stars we would! HORRIBLE. Wasn't funny, campy, cute, interesting, entertaining...nothing.

Was shot in someone's house and yard using crap equipment and dollar store costumes. The ""actors"" are obviously strippers or porn stars...no acting skills to be seen, anywhere. (which is fine if you're choosing porn and expect that.)

The premise sounded interesting but we were all staring at the screen, shaking our heads and asking,,  ""WT* are we watching?!?""

The girls all get naked, so if you're desperate to see porn-free nudity...enjoy.

BLEH.

Wish I could get a refund.

Wouldn't even watch this for free. Waste of time. Shame on Amazon for offering this junk ",1473552000,,695,5.142857142857143

8704249,5,B00U2YNMKO,"You can't tell from the title of this movie, but this is part of the Emmanuelle Through Time series of Cinemax After Dark features.  This particular feature was never shown on Cinemax (probably because of the songs and rather unconvincing lip-synching - not your typical Skinemax fare) but make no mistake, it's the same cast and cheesy special effects.  DailyGrindhouse.com has a great interview with Director Rolfe Kanefsky that gives you all the background you could want on this DVD and the entire Emmanuelle Through Time series of seven features.  In the interview, Kanefsky explains that since producer Alain Siritzky's death in 2014, his estate being settled has delayed any release of the hundreds of films that Siritzky was involved with.  Kanefsky does not however, explain how this movie got released.

I'm guessing the Adventures Into The Woods title is a play on the 2014 Meryl Streep/Johnny Depp adaptation of the Sondheim fairy tale musical Into The Woods.

Anyway, this movie itself hearkens back to Charles Band's Cinderella or Bill Osco's Alice In Wonderland in that it has a dozen clever, peppy, filthy songs to go along with lots of naked flesh and characters and stories from your childhood.  It's all great fun and the cast looks like they were having a blast with the costumes and dance numbers.

Here's to hoping that somehow, all of the Emmanuelle Through Time features get released on DVD eventually.  That would be an instant purchase for me for sure.",1448409600,7,1478,4.975609756097561
8704250,1,B00U2YNMKO,Flat chested woman is star. If you like seeing just nipples this is for you. She has no tits at all. Save your money,1447891200,2,116,3.875
8704251,1,B00U2YNMKO,Horrible movie with little or no plot.,1441843200,,38,4.571428571428571
8704252,5,B00U2YNMKO,This was raunchy and funny with songs that barley pass as songs.  They are lip synced anyway...LOL,1440288000,3,98,4.764705882352941
8704253,5,B00U2YNMKO,"Cute light fluff.  It makes no sense, but that's not the point.  The point is to turn the male mind in to pudding.  Not a difficult proposition.

The main character is the type of girl you would have no problem introducing to your parents when she is clothed.

 The ""story"", such as it is, is reminiscent of the 1976 Christine de-Bell Alice in Wonderland..",1439856000,5,356,4.484375
