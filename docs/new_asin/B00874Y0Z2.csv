8525948,3,B00874Y0Z2,"This Bergman movie is from the mid-1950's. Three wives while awaiting the return of their husbands who are brothers, share intimate stories about their marriages. In the meantime, a sister of one of the women is planning to elope with another of the brothers. In the first recollection, a woman shares a bathhouse, and more, with a former lover. When her husband discovers the incident, he vows to kill himself, but he is dissuaded from doing so by his older brother, who reassures him that an unfaithful wife is better than no wife. In the second recollection, a women tells about her love affair and marriage to a Parisian artist whose family disapproved of the relationship, and depicts a harrowing childbirth scene. The third recollection is a very funny recounting of a time when emotionally estranged spouses rekindle their marriage while trapped in an elevator. There is nothing wrong with this movie. The acting is good, the stories are interesting and varied, and one realizes that Bergman can be very funny. However, it didn't leave me thinking, pondering like the other Bergman movies I so love, and I don't think I will watch it again. Non-Bergman fans may really enjoy this movie and, I would recommend to those, like me, who feel that they want to experience the whole range of what Bergman produced.",1360972800,,1314,4.870535714285714
