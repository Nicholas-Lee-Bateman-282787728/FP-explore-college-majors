8426235,4,B004DXZKNW,"The character of the Falcon was created by British author Michael Arlen (1895-1956) in 1940. Arlene wrote novels and short stories with humor and underlying cynicism. Neither Arlen nor any film or other version of the Falcon never explained why the debonair Gay Lawrence was called the Falcon. George Sanders played the Falcon in three films, this one being his last, and it is in this one that Gays brother is introduced. He is played by Tom Conway from 1942 through 1946, a total of ten films, including the one he shared with Sanders. Conway took over the role as the Falcon when sanders tired of staring in B films. Conway continued the characteristics of Sanders being intrigued by crimes and wanting to solve them and being attracted to beautiful women.
The film The Falcons Brother was released during the same year as the prior Falcon film The Falcon Takes Over, in 1942. The basic format continued, but a few characters were substituted, including the lieutenant and the Falcons assistant.
The Falcon (Sanders) went to pick up his brother who was arriving on a ship and happens to discover that a man was poisoned and the dead man was thought to be his brother by everyone but the Falcon. The Falcon becomes intrigued and decides to investigate and find out who committed the murder and why it was done, and what his brother was up to.
As usual, there is bumbling by the police, as much humor as there is mystery, and a lot of interest by the brothers in various women.",1510012800,,1478,4.645038167938932
