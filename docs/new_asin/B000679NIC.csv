8039759,1,B000679NIC,This series of three so far is a rip off.  The first was fine and promising but who would back this and the third as entertainment?  Forget buying this or the next.,1322265600,,164,4.09375
8039760,1,B000679NIC,"When I was a teenager, there was a Grape Nuts cereal commercial that advertisers rated as the worst ad of the year.  Did Grape Nuts cancel the commercials?  No!  They made even more variants.  They must have decided that being the worst was more advantageous than being just one in the crowd.  The same thing happens here.  This sequel takes a bad first movie and makes it worse.  The main character was not endearing from the jump, so the movie makers made him even more annoying this time around.  It was understandable when he made bad decisions as a closeted man, but as an insecure boyfriend, he really scratches the chalkboard with his nails.  Other people have noted that the men in this flick are not as hot as in the first one.  I'd add that this sequel had fewer men, not just less attractive ones.  I can only assume that the movie makers and the cast wanted to make something so terrible that one has to work hard to erase it from his memory.",1165104000,3,954,4.394285714285714
