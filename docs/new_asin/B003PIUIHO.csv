4164525,4,B003PIUIHO,"Four movies from Jim Carrey, who is one of those actors people either enjoy very much or have little time for.

The Mask is certainly family fun, for everyone, Yes Man is in the same general class with Majestic being the pick of the bunch for me. Dumb and Dumber was just too focused on the tween age group for me to take much from it.

The sets and special effects are all reasonably high quality, the entertainment value at the price level is superb.

Most of these were box office successes in their releasy year and are just as watchable today as they were then.

The packaging was good, and although the discs were double sided they had a few extras included.

I enjoyed the time spent, and if you have kids around you'll find them very usefull during holidays or rainy weekends, as the kids seem to be able to watch them a dozen times without being bored, except possibly ""Majestic"".

At a little over $2 a movie, you can't really rent them at that price, and downloads are almost as expensive, so why not buy if you enjoy the principles?",1323907200,,1044,4.383419689119171
4164526,5,B003PIUIHO,"Having previously seen only one of the four movies in this package, the purchase was made with an expectation of hopefully seeing something that could be called a must see movie.

First, the one movie I had previously seen:

The Mask is a soft romantic fantasy type movie draw on the legend of Loki the Norse god.  Although special effects rule in this movie, music and dance give the movie its energy, entertainment and fun factor.  Always good to watch.

The three Jim Carrey movies I had not seen in no particular order.

Dumb and Dumber provides some intellectual and many emotional moments of slapstick when two guys try to return a lost briefcase to its owner.  Lots of fun.

Yes Man is an interesting twist of The Dice Man that Carrey plays well.  Imagine if you will never saying the word 'No' and what could happen to you.  The romantic interest in this movie is provided by Zooey Deschanel, a very talented actress in her own right.  Very enjoyable and in some places a little thought provoking.

The Majestic is a movie starring Jim Carrey that quite frankly I had never heard of.  This is not the 'usual' type of movie I would have expected to see Carrey in at all.  Having said that, I am astounded at not only how good this movie is but at how good Jim Carrey is.  I took a chance on buying this package, having only see one of the movies before but I did find my must see movie. The Majestic is it.

Enjoy!",1322524800,6,1421,4.366412213740458
4164527,4,B003PIUIHO,"This wonderful Warner Brothers release of four of Jim Carrey's films all in WIDESCREEN(contrary to the official Amazon blurb),is a package well worth getting. The upside is that the price is right,the down side is that they are on two dreaded double sided discs which are super prone to getting scuffed and/or scratched. If you are brave of heart dear DVD warrior then you may pass GO and collect two hundred dollars.
Disc One,Side A finds Dumb and Dumber,released Dec/94 and starring Jim as Lloyd Christmas(!)and as his pal Harry Dunne played by Jeff Daniels. Directed by the Farrelly Brothers this is a well paced comedy that features gag after silly gag throughout. The boys live together;Lloyd is a limousine driver who becomes instantly infatuated with a fare and tries unsuccessfully to return a briefcase she left in the airport before leaving for Aspen,Colorado. It was really a deliberate drop of alot of cash for two thugs. Harry is a dog clipper who has converted his car into a giant hairy looking dog. Both guys lose their jobs on the same day and decide to return the briefcase to Aspen. Their trip as would be expected is chock full of faux pauxs and misadventures. When they finally arrive they get to return to briefcase and foil a kidnap plot in the process. The film ends as the two walk back home and miss the chance to get aboard a bus full of sun tan lotion promoting females. A really hilarious romp full of alot of guy humour and obvious gags but Carrey and(surprisingly)Daniels do a great job and have really good on screen chemistry together. The film has been transferred well and is in its' original a/r of 1:85:1. The only extras are cast bios,photo gallery and the original and international trailers. 3 1/2-4 stars.
Disc One,Side B reveals The Mask,released July/94 which stars Carrey as Stanley Ipkiss. He is a hopeless romantic but shy and lacks any kind of social life. His favourite TV viewing is old Tex Avery cartoons. One day he stumbles upon a strange wooden mask floating in the harbour of Edge City. He puts it on and it melds right into his skin transforming him into a cartoon like character who can whirl around like a Tazmanian Devil and has a strong and outgoing personality;the total opposite of him. He at first manages to get even with a few people that have done him wrong but over time he runs afoul of a local gang and the police who are hell bent on capturing and/or killing him,depending on the moment. In the end Stanley manages to corral the local gang and hand them over to the police and he gets the girl. The films fades out as Stanley throws the mask into the river. Well directed and edited this film could have gone way over the top and missed the mark but Carrey's performance is right on the money and the outrageousness of his character is something only he could have pulled off successfully. The film has been transferred well and is in its' original a/r of 1:85:1. Extras include:deleted scenes,commentary,trailer,featurettes-Return to Edge City,Introducing Cameron Diaz,Cartoon Logic and What makes Fido Run. Four stars.
Disc Two,Side A finds Yes Man,released Dec/08. This one,kind of an off brother to Liar,Liar,has Carrey as everyman Carl Allan,a bank employee who has become somewhat of a social recluse. He would rather stay home than hang with his friends. One day an ex bank employee turns him onto a life altering lecture being given by an inspirational guru played by Terrence Stamp. It empowers Carl to make a pact with himself not to say no but from now on say yes to life. This he takes to extremes saying yes to everything. Slowly but surely his life does change and for the better. He helps alot of people in the process,gets a job promotion and finds in the end he has become a better human being for it. In short he gets a life and in the process gets the girl. The movie is a look at what positive thinking and making the right choices in one's life can ultimately achieve,and Carrey again plays the part wonderfully. The film is in its' original widescreen a/r of 2:4:1 and it has been transferred well. There are no extras. It's a feel good film that I give 3 1/2 - 4 stars.
Finally Disc Two,Side B sees one of Jim Carrey's most underrated films and I think one of his best,The Majestic,released Dec/01. The film stars Carrey as Peter Appleton a budding Hollywood film writer. This is the early 50s and the McCarthy witch hunts are in full swing and Peter gets caught up in the sordid mess. He is let go of his position by the studio. After getting drunk he decides to go for a long drive up the Pacific Highway. Along the way his car plunges into a raging river and he survives only to hit his head on the bridge abutment. He is found the next day on a local beach and is taken into a town called Lawson. He has amnesia,however the townsfolk mistake him for a local war hero Luke Trimble who was MIA in WW2. When Luke's own father identifies him as his son Peter goes along with things, but all the time unsure and unable to recall all the things the townspeople say about him and his past. Just as Peter/Luke is melding into the towns life he gets his memory back and at the same time the Committee on UnAmerican Activity catches up with him,taking him back to Hollywood to appear before them. Under tremendous stress and questioning,Peter refuses to give in and basically tells the committee what they can do with their hearing and charges. Peter goes back to Lawson to see a girl he left behind only to be greeted at the train station by the entire town. The Majestic is a real feel good movie and it shows the acting chops Carrey has in the dramatic department. Not well received originally I think this is Carrey's best work dramatically and the film is one that needs a good reassessment. The film has been transferred well into its original widescreen a/r of 1:85:1. Extras include:cast and crew specs,additonal scenes,trailer,a featurette on The Hollywood Blacklist and the complete movie in a movie starring ex-Xena actors Bruce Campbell and Cliff Curtis. I give it 4-4 1/2 stars.
All in all these two discs contain four of Jim Carrey's better films. They're on double side discs though so beware,but it's a great price for them and a must have for all Jim Carrey fans. Highly recommended.",1299628800,17,6286,4.603386809269162
4164528,5,B003PIUIHO,"I am surprised there is not even one review on this product yet. These may not be the best of Jim Carrey but these movies are solid and show a wide variety of Carrey's acting ability. The Mask is a ""classic"" movie that will always guarantee a fun night. Yes Man was absolutely hilarious. Dumb and Dumber was another funny movie and the Majestic shows another side of Jim Carrey but in a good way.
