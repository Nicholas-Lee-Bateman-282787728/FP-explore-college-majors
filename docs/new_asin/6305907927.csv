8000775,4,6305907927,"If you are considering buying a Bruce Brown film other than The Endless Summer or Endless Summer II, this is a great place to start.  Think of it as a ""Greatest Hits"" of his Golden Age of Surf Collection.  You  get a taste of each of the previous films and a chance to feel what surfing  was really like in the 50's & 60's.  No Frankie & Annette here -  Just a group of guys having fun and inadvertently pioneering a new sport.  Be sure to catch the cameos of then unknown names that are now surf  legends.  Enjoy! - and then get the rest...(but get ""Surf Crazy""  next!)",963446400,15,570,4.146788990825688
