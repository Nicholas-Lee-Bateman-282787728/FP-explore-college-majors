5011221,1,B006OT0TCK,"Would have given this a zero if possible. Supposedly 70 minutes of music, actually closer to 40. Sweet Home Alabama looked and sounded like it was a 1970s home movie. Half the instruments were not in the mix. Freebird stopped abruptly before the end of the song. Very disappointing.",1403395200,2,282,4.775510204081633
5011222,2,B006OT0TCK,read all the reviews but hard to find old concert footage with Ronnie so i took what i could get and the fact that they cut the end of free bird was disapointing but like i said wanted footage of original line up before the crash still glad i got it it's grainy if you read the reviews it's saying the same thing i'm saying and i do have the best Skynyrd dd but it's with his brother and it's the best just wanted footage of original that all,1401148800,2,442,3.9775280898876404

5011224,3,B006OT0TCK,Decent quality filming and sound.  Freebird/Tribute Tour are far better quality.  I liked the song choices on Same Old Blues.,1371513600,,125,5.2
5011225,4,B006OT0TCK,"Anything Lynyrd Skynyrd is terrific, it was great to see the band. Therefore, the content of the disc is the absolute greatest! However, the quality of the disc was not very good. At times the sound and the picture were out of sync. The biggest disappointment was that the last song Freebird was cut off at the end. The song was not over and the disc cut off.",1350345600,3,359,4.294117647058823
5011226,5,B006OT0TCK,"I received this DVD today and it contains excellent live footage from what I consider to be the best Skynyrd era. The video quality is very good (remember this was shot in 1975). All in all, this is a rare concert and nice to finally have on DVD.",1333411200,2,246,4.145833333333333
5011227,1,B006OT0TCK,"Agree with JH's review above - this was already available as the bonus disc in the expanded version of Gimme Back My Bullets. Unfortunately I did not read his review as I pre-ordered it. I figured what the heck, I'll keep it since it will be filed with my DVD collection and I won't have to dig out the CD to watch the DVD now. What a surprise when I put it in - while the audio is fine, the video looks like a several generation bootleg - washed out and faded. Will be returning this one.",1333238400,14,489,4.051546391752577
5011228,1,B006OT0TCK,"Even though this DVD is not yet released, I've seen a Track Listing, and it's EXACTLY the same as the ""Old Grey Whistle Test"" footage that is already on the bonus DVD with the DELUXE EDITION of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gimme-Back-My-Bullets-W-Dvd-Dlx/dp/B000B8I8I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gimme Back My Bullets (W/Dvd) (Dlx)</a>.  If you have it, save your money, if not, buy it instead and get the CD with Bonus Tracks, a nice booklet and nice packaging!  It is at this date also less than $15......

8502336,1,B006OT0TCK,This is not a live concert as in a arena. This is the same concert as  The Old Grey Whistle Test. Shot in front of a TV studio audience of a few hundred people. I do not like to bee fool into thinking I am getting a new concert I have never seen. Then find out I have it  already. Yes it is a very good concert live and Freebird  is worth the money. Just do not buy it and end up with the same concert you already own,1421452800,,417,3.662921348314607
