7923198,1,B00004TX5Q,This is not the greatest collection of music in my opinion.,1417305600,,59,4.454545454545454

7923200,4,B00004TX5Q,"This is 3 Cleopatra VHS tapes transfered onto one DVD. The first edition had a very uncomfortable menu plus you could not skip from one track to the next. On this new edition this has been corrected but the menu is still not always accurate. Curiously enough, after a long while of watching, the menu started working flawlessly. I have 1000 concert DVDs and a fair share of ill-working menues, sometimes it's your player being somewhat incompatible but mostly it's the DVD being badly authored, and this one is not the worst one I've seen. Every clip displays a graph when it starts so no big deal, you might just select play all and it will play the 3 VHS in chronological order in 3 different titles and skip whichever song doesn't suit your fancy, which is what I did.

As with most comps, don't expect to like every clip; I for one enjoyed more the guitar-oriented, less industrial songs (exactly 22 out of 40) but at well over 3 hours there are clips for anyone that's even casually into Goth.

Quality is acceptable; my player bitrate meter showed an average pic ratio of about 6 Mbps peaking at 9. There is no enhancement of any kind either for pic or audio, just a low bitrate direct transfer with lossy AC3 audio but hey what can be expected from a low-budget company like Cleopatra who used to deal with one of the most underground scenes ever to grace rock and roll ?

But, this one ranks highly among the Goth video comps out there, along Cleopatra's The Goth Box companion DVD and Cherry Red's excellent In Goth Daze vols 1 and 2. I have them all and prolly you should too. This particular one completed my collection only because I picked it up from a bargain bin.

Buy at your own risk; it's really a mixed bag of videoclips.",1350000000,2,1740,4.445141065830721
7923201,4,B00004TX5Q,"If you're interested in the classic Cleopatra music, then you'll enjoy the videos. The DVD seems to have been mastered by someone experimenting with DVDs for the very first time. Menus and chapter headers are poorly done, some songs can't be reached by segment skipping and must be fast forwarded to, etc. Probably you'll just extract the videos to your computer.",1260489600,,363,4.967213114754099
7923202,3,B00004TX5Q,"This is a collection of 40 music videos from a great selection of industrial groups -- Clock DVA, Chrome, Frontline Assembly, Einsterzende Neubauten, Psychic TV, Pigface, Die Krupps, Test Department, Christian Death, Rosetta Stone, Executive Slacks, etc.  Not every video is brilliant but the music is consistently good.
My problem with this dvd is the very lame formatting problems.  There are some songs that don't allow you to advance so you have to fast-foward through them (and they seem to be the longest songs on the disk!) or go back to the main menu.  It seems like they had to work at making this so lame!  It would also be nice if you could check off the videos you want to hear and then have the disk play just those songs, but that is not a possibility.
This is a great selection of industrial music -- you even see three examples of that rarity, blonde goths -- but you WILL be frustrated by the disk!",1080172800,6,915,4.527272727272727
7923203,4,B00004TX5Q,"OK - I got my replacement DVD (the first one was defective) so here goes.  This DVD compilation of 40 industrial band music-videos from CLEOPATRA is  a cool compilation featuring such groups as Die Krupps, Einsturzende  Neubauten, Spahn Ranch, Chemlab, Throbbing Gristle, Test Dept., Leaether  Strip, Razed in Black, Clock DVA, Pigface and more.  This DVD basically  compiles ALL the videos that were on Cleopatra's earlier three VHS  releases: Industrial Revolution Vol. 1, Industrial Revolution Vol. 2 and  Gothic Industrial Alternative Visuals.  The digital mastering of the DVD  is average and I compared it side by side with the old VHS releases.  In  some cases the DVD looks sharper (although with some slight artifacts), but  in other cases the VHS has much better contrast.  Just compare the shot  of the demon in Chemlab's ""Codeine Glue & You"" video....on  the VHS it's crystal clear, but on the DVD you can barely make out it's  face no matter how much you fiddle with the controls.  Other videos suffer  in the same way, but all in all, the DVD is definitely satisfactory.  There  is a simple menu where you can access each song (and if you do it manually  by skipping you will find that the 40 videos are broken down into 3  separate sections --- from the old VHS releases --- and you will have to  fast forward to get to the next set! --- very strange).  There is also  extra information on some of the bands listing other video releases that  feature them.  There is also no booklet.  A bare-bones DVD, but if you  like the old Cleopatra stuff, it's a good purchase and way cheaper than  buying the 3 separate videos.",966211200,11,1632,4.701067615658363
