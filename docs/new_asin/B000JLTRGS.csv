2677669,5,B000JLTRGS,"This DVD set showcases the beginning of the reign of the Chicago Bulls as NBA Champions.  With Michael and Scottie(2 NBA All-Stars and Hall of Famers)leading the way to their 1st of 6 championships, it is nice to look back and see how great they were as they play the Lakers.  With all of the games shown as they were originally broadcast, this is a must own for all Bulls and Jordan fans.",1271030400,,389,4.315068493150685
2677670,3,B000JLTRGS,"As another reviewer stated, this set does not include the 4 game sweep of The Detroit Pistons and it should've been included.",1269388800,8,125,4.7272727272727275
2677671,4,B000JLTRGS,"If you're a Bulls fan or just a fan of the NBA, these 5 games featuring Michael and Scottie and Magic and Worthy will entertain you for hours.  My only question is Why didn't this set include the 4 game sweep of the pistons? The pistons box set includes the ECF against Chicago. If,and hopefully when, the second Bulls Championship set comes out, it will have the seven games against New York along with the six games against Portland. All in all, its a hell of a collection. Just need to work a bit harder next time fellas. Get on it, and don't disappoint",1180569600,6,556,4.346153846153846
2677672,5,B000JLTRGS,"There was a user who said part of a game was missing, but it appeared that was how it was originally broadcast.  The DVD package says it's in the original broadcast format, and it meets those expectations.",1175817600,,205,4.54054054054054
2677673,5,B000JLTRGS,"Just a few words: excellent quality and very good presentation, it's a pleasure to see again (after years) these five games with Jordan vs Magic.

I hope Amazon will be releasing stuff like this in the future (different finals like 1985 against Boston Celtics).",1175644800,,261,4.931818181818182
2677674,3,B000JLTRGS,"Having purchased the Bulls' Dynasty Series title, I quickly tired of the network announcer's play-by-play, espcially the grating, innane, nonsensical Bill Walton and the try-too-hard Marv Albert. I wish they would have an audience-only audio track available. It would be like being at the game. I could listen to guys like Doug Collins and Hubie Brown, who give good insight into the plays, but they weren't working for NBC.",1174348800,5,424,5.159420289855072
2677675,5,B000JLTRGS,"I loved watching these games, all five games of the 1991 NBA Finals between the Lakers and Bulls. Games 2, 4, and 5 have the classic ""NBA on NBC intro"", something I was not expecting after reading some previous reviews for it. There is pre-game talk before each game, which gives it some flavor of what to expect for each game. The quality is much better than I expected from games recorded 16 years ago.

If anyone purchased the Chicago Bulls: 1990s DVD, one will notice there is 20 + minutes of extra footage on game 5, the clincher. More pre-game and locker room footage. It is not made to fit a 2 hour time frame for NBATV or ESPN Classic. That is a plus to me because the celebrations are entertaining.

I noticed in game 3 that it is not 100% the full broadcast. They chipped 30 seconds, and it's easy to tell. This probably happened a few more times, but if so, it's hard to tell. They did what they could I suppose and it didn't take away too much from the game.

The bonus sixth disc is the Learning To Fly video. This is also on the Chicago Bulls: 1990s DVD, just in case anyone is expecting more. I figured it to be the case when I purchased it.

The box itself is cool. The front is the boring Bulls logo, but the back has the 1991 team on it. Very nice. In the three cases for the 6 discs, each side has game statistics for the particular game. Very similar to the

2005 White Sox World Series DVDs. I'm a stat freak, and it was helpful in following the game.

Like I said, I'll buy any Bulls Finals releases that come out. I'm already waiting for the 1992 NBA Finals to come out, and eventually I hope all of them are released.",1170806400,30,1641,4.177215189873418
2677676,4,B000JLTRGS,"I brought this dvd hoping it had the classic NBA On NBC intros but they edited that out. Instead they cut in the intro with the shorter one. I basically grew up watching this program,and for them to not have the classic intro pisses me off.",1169856000,,240,4.239130434782608

CHAMPIONSHIP RECAP Relive the Chicago Bulls' historic first NBA Championship with this overview of their 1991 title run. Experience the emotional, action-packed story of how the Bulls' Championship dreams took flight. Finishing with an amazing 61-21 season record, the Bulls charged into the postseason sweeping the New York Knicks, eliminating the Philadelphia 76ers in five and reaching the NBA Finals by winning four straight against the powerful Detroit Pistons. The Finals matchup with the Los Angeles Lakers seemed formidable after losing Game 1, but the Bulls came back to unleash four straight wins to take the title. Via breathtaking highlights and exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, join the Bulls in the huddle, hear coach Phil Jackson in the locker room and take a courtside seat for all the action of the Bulls' spectacular 1990-1991 season. - 6",1166400000,15,1627,4.817204301075269
2677678,4,B000JLTRGS,"This is when I became a fan of Michael Jordan: The Chicago Bulls first NBA Championship run. Michael is the greatest player to ever play the game, and his first NBA final with the young and hungry Bulls was nothing short of ""spectacular"". The only reason I give this set 4 stars instead of the full 5: clearly missing is the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals between the Bulls and Detroit Pistons (who knocked the Bulls out of the playoffs for three straight years: in the 1988 Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, and both the 1989 and 1990 Eastern Conference Finals...a true rivalry in every sense). The Detroit Pistons 1988-89 Championship DVD set has all six games of the Eastern Conference Finals with the Chicago Bulls, and the Pistons' four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. Regardless, this is a must-have for any Bulls/Jordan fan.",1165017600,14,853,4.8493150684931505

2677693,2,B000JLTRGS,"I'll admit that I should have checked the quality of the disks as soon as I received the box set. I haven't had them out of the wrapping since I bought this set several years ago. I decided to sit down with my son and show him Michael Jordan and discover disk 4 doesn't work and is unreadable. No scratches, no visible defects. It just won't play.
