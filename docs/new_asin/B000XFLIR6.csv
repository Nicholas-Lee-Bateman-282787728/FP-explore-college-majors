8228200,5,B000XFLIR6,"I stick my neck out for nobody. Nobody but the most gorgeous Taiwan native, Shu Qi, new to American audiences after 40 plus films in Hong Kong and Korea. My review of this video excludes the Mandarin language packaging that includes the phrase 'sex star,' but is strictly overhype. This contains no sex scenes, no shameful acts at all. In America this dvd is really a Playboy-like audition or casting agent teaser. Although it is intended for over 18 audiences it looks to have been spliced together from 3 different years of Shu Qi's modeling work and it must be stated: there is nothing shameful or explicit in the footage. Quite simply, at an hour and 20 minutes of running time it is an early preview of a rising star with uncommon natural charm. The producers capture the pre-film modeling of this Venus undraped, posing for the camera unashamedly and lovingly at such lengths in the wind or next to lapping waves, or beneath waterfalls with incredible calm and self-confidence making me believe the most important quality in modeling to be patience, allowing for long seemingly private glimpses of her natural physical gifts. To avoid monotony, they have done some elaborate post-production work with montages, in some cases with footage juxtaposed or layered atop one another supported by a jazzy music score. You see her posing outside against a resort in a dress, moving to a balcony, beneath a waterfall with a marvelous solo piano score by a Carl May-like pianist that keeps your thoughts on a high plain as you enjoy the scenery. By 50 minutes in, you have seen her fashionably dressed (or semi-clothed)and you are ready for the selling point for casting agents: quick head shots from her fashion runway work (possibly 17 here)that display her expressive facial glances, making her look like Gene Tierney at moments or suggesting greater things to come for the intelligence beneath the beauty. My favorite shoot occurs at the one hour mark where she is shot at a rocky coastline bathed in a hazy overcast which brightens her face enough to capture her mercurial, expressive face and becoming side-glances that her film admirers know so well. If you aren't convinced in the first hour that you are seeing someone very special at 1:13 min. it segues into a private garden with Shu Qi in a grey dress on a narrow bridge caught in a reverie of her own and the camera zooms in for a total head shot and she displays again those mercurial glances, smiles of charm that could melt a milky way bar fresh from the freezer. This is the one private Shu Qi video that should have sent her to filmdom on the A++ Train.",1396569600,2,2617,4.728665207877461
8228201,4,B000XFLIR6,"I ordered this movie from Singapore through Amazon.com, and it arrived much quicker than the estimated time. Shu Qi (or Xu Chi) was born in Taiwan as Lin Li-Hui, so she and I could be related. I hope I am related to such a goddess. This is a pinup film with some topless scenes and brief frontal nudity. I have seen a few of these scenes before in another Shu Qi pinup film, but others are entirely new. Some parts have one scene over another that is annoying, but I like the movie overall. Her size is given as 1.68 meters or 5'-6.14"" in height, 50 kg. or 110 pounds in weight and 34""/24""/35"" figure, so she is bigger than I am. I own many of her movies, and I plan to buy more of them. I recommend this movie to fans of Shu Qi or fans of any sexy girls in general.",1362614400,2,766,4.0130718954248366
