4454154,5,B004QQDUOW,"I saw the original presentation and was hoping from then that the Metropolitan Opera would release it on DVD.  I was thrilled to find out that they were going to.  It is one of the best of Anna Netrebko's performances.  She sounds spectacular, and has never looked more gorgeous.  The prize for most remarkable performance within the show goes to John Del Carlo in the title role.  He does an incredible double-speed song in Italian with perfect diction.  He even gets an encore.  You have to see it to believe it.",1332374400,11,514,4.582417582417582
4454155,4,B004QQDUOW,"Don Pasquale is a nice and typical comic opera. It has the fool, the lovers, the owner of the mischief, false identities, etc. But it also has some more real and human scenes, with the appropriate music, of compassion. It is entertaining and the music is Bell canto at its best.
The main actors are very good, but not exceptional (thus the 4 stars) you end up with a good taste of the opera but not with an extremely or incredible WOW. The staging is nice and appropriate, no need for difficult interpretations. All the singers act very convincingly making the overall experience enjoyable.
It is filmed life at the Met so there are some audio issues from time to time. The channel the voice is coming out (in the 5.1 mode) is some time puzzling and the sudden change in volume bothered me some. I don't know if it could be fixed with software wizardry.
Overall a nice experience to enjoy on a winter evening.",1328400000,3,909,4.481927710843373
4454156,5,B004QQDUOW,"Bravo, everyone! New York's Metropolitan Opera, under the leadership of Maestro James Levine, has produced a winner with 2010's ""Don Pasquale""!

Otto Schenk's production contains his typically detailed and visually stunning sets (we got used to those in his ""Ring"" of the 1980's), but what surprised me was the high comedy that he wove throughout the show. He has the whole cast jumping, running, laughing and screaming...all while singing Donizetti's luscious score.

And speaking of singing, it is no wonder that Anna Netrebko has retained her star billing for so many years. What a voice! I simply could not wait for her next high note, each one more thrilling than the one before. Her Pasquale of John Del Carlo is perfectly cast. Like the rest of the cast, he knows how to play his comedy (and rattle out his patter songs at a million words a minute), but he and Netrebko were able to squeeze in a brief touching moment at the start of Act 3: She sees the hurt her little ""joke"" on Pasquale has caused him, and for a moment seems to regret getting involved.

I last saw Mariusz Kwiecien as the villainous Ashton (opposite Netrebko in ""Lucia di Lammermoor""), and his rich baritone in the rather funny role of Dr. Malatesta does not disappoint. And then there is Matthew Polenzani with his gorgeous, ringing tenor role of Ernesto. Like Netrebko, his upper register resonates so easily, and he deserved every shout of ""bravo"" that came his way (pardon my overuse of the word, ""bravo,"" but is is well deserved).

In the pit was the ever smiling James Levine. His leadership goes beyond every adjective in the book, truly loving what he has done better than anyone else in the world for forty years. How fortunate he is to have a career that he loves so much...and how lucky the rest of us are that he is so good at it.

The video production is marvelous, a crystal clear picture, enabling us to catch every detail of this production. The sound quality is exceptional as well, capturing a fine balance between the pit and the stage. Only for a few brief moments, when the singers turn upstage for some of their antics, do we lose their sound. Of course, this means that all of my old DVD collection (with the old, compressed sound) from the Met will be harder to listen to!

Only the placement of the extras was a disappointment. Showing the set changes between scenes of each act could have been omitted completely, and I would have preferred the interviews with the cast (enlightening and enjoyable as they are) to be a separate menu option as opposed to an integrated part of the showing.

So...Metropolitan Opera...when do we get more? How about blu-rays of ""Thas,"" ""Peter Grimes,"" ""Lucia di Lammermoor,"" etc...? ...and once you are done with the ""Ring""...please...?",1311984000,8,2770,4.722567287784679
4454157,4,B004QQDUOW,"Excelente produccin de Schenk, quizs un poco farsesca en algunos detalles como la exagerada actividad fsica de Norina, pero hermosa y realista. Mi mayor elogio es para el gran tenor norteamericano Matthew Polenzani, quien se ha convertido en una de las ms grandes estrellas del Met solamente en base a su extraordinaria voz y tcnica, lejos de la popularidad meditica que sostiene a otras ""estrellas"". La calidad tcnica del video es EXCEPCIONAL y ver a James Levine aproximarse a un nuevo ttulo, considerando su delicada salud y fragilidad, es algo conmovedor para quienes lo consideramos el ms grande director de pera de las ltimas dcadas. Recomiendo ampliamente este video!",1311897600,2,674,5.192660550458716
4454158,3,B004QQDUOW,"This is sold as a Blu-ray disc for repeated watching but what you actually get is a one-off evening at the Met. James Levine must fancy himself as Pasquale as he appears far too frequently acting the fool and grinning like a Cheshire cat. An unsubtitled introduction and a behind-the scenes collection of extras are inserted into the opera at different points. In between scenes we slip behind the stage for a few more moments of ""insights"". All this is fine ONCE, and most of it can be fast forwarded, but to have to put up with it and fiddle with the controls every time one watches the disc is intolerable. It would have been so easy to offer two versions: this mish-mash and just the opera by linked branching as is often done with different versions of films, but no, you get one choice and it is unacceptable.

Sadly this is not all:The color is fine but the video is very soft and no better than a rather ordinary DVD. Netrebko is grossly overweight and not at all suited to the part and has the most dreadful costume selection. (Pasquale's costumes are also not that appropriate in my view). I found del Carlo very ordinary and not a patch on Corbelli, available on SD DVD. The other parts are very good but they are no compensation for the rest which is a disaster. The booklet is patronising and little more than propaganda for the production rather than something to educate you about the opera.

This is the third blu-ray of this wonderful opera and all have significant shortcomings but this one is by far the worst. Do not touch it with a barge-pole! On balance the Decca is probably the best but there is still room for a really good Pasquale. This is absolutely not it!",1311552000,11,1685,4.485342019543974
4454159,3,B004QQDUOW,"This is not a new MET production. The MET first had this in 2006, with roughly the same cast, but with some significant changes, too.
First of all, in the title role, the former bass baritone Simone Alaimo's starry performance that outshone both Norina and Ernesto is not there in this live recording. John del Carlo simply does not own the same degree of vocal clarity and verbal incisivness of Alaimo that is required of the title role.
Of course, too bad that here, in an important reprisal of this opera by the MET, they could no longer hire Juan Diego Florez to sing Ernesto. Last time round, at least in one performance, Florez did not finish the entire show owing to a slight ailment in the form of 'allergy', and the serenade ""Com'e gentil"" was tackled by his understudy Barry Banks, a very capable coloratura tenor in his own right.
Matthew Palenzani isn't bad as Ernesto; just that he lacked the quality to make the role really 'shine'.
As for Netrebko, I must say that she is a bit over the top in this production as Norina. She has to obtain an outfit that is at least two sizes bigger than the former 2006 suit.
The crux of the matter, however, is that her Norina isn't just sharp and witty - she is outright a shrew: spiteful, even a bit sluttish (considering the all too 'over' duet with Dr. Malatesta). Norina's love for the 'poor' Ernesto does not seem to exist as the opera progresses. Netrebko sang well enough, though her gained weight is to be on the downside as compared to her 2006 performance, which was better dramatically and vocally.
Mariusz Kwiecien, like Netrebko, was in the 2006 MET production. Here is a stylish singer with a coloratura technique so secure and nature that is really hard to beat.
In short, the star of the show is Dr. Malatesta.
What do you think of that?",1307059200,4,1804,4.519877675840979
8438461,5,B004QQDUOW,"This Metropolitan Opera production from November, 2010, directed and traditionally staged by Otto Schenk is an absolute delight. Anna Netrebko, not really known for comedic abilities, is fresh and engaging, bringing a special vitality to the role of Norina. The late John Del Carlo (1951-2016) is just pure fun as Don Pasquale. Mariusz Kwiecien enlivens Dr. Malatesta. His Act Three patter song duet ""Cheti, cheti, immantinente"" with Del Carlo ""brings down the house"" and even receives one of those very rare MET Opera encores. United States born and trained Matthew Polenzani, the Pasquale Nephew and love of Norina, provides the beautiful tenor voice for the principles quartet group. James Levine, in the midst of his physical back pain problems, approaches the podium with a cane and uses a swivel chair for his conducting. But, this does not seem to hamper his energy. It is said in the Intro that this is his first time to conduct this piece, but, one would never suspect as he seems totally engrossed and familiar with the Donizetti score. Overall, this is watching and listening pleasure.",1491696000,,1096,5.060773480662983

8438464,4,B004QQDUOW,"A fun and fast rendition of Don Pasquale, honestly my favorite of Donizetti's works.  This is a great opera to introduce new fans to the genre with, the opera is hummable and the characters are easy to follow.

Mariusz Kwiecien, famous for playing Don Giovanni, is amazing as the manipulative Dr. Malatesta.  John Del Carlo though is the best cast as Don Pasquale, making the character both a well meaning bumbler and a sympathetic figure.

Well worth your money.",1447113600,2,463,4.822784810126582
8438465,5,B004QQDUOW,"A splendid Blu-ray.  Technically this is a winner.  The video is brilliant. ( I have no idea what one of the three star reviewers is talking about,  when he says the video is ""very soft and no better than a rather ordinary DVD"".  That is certainly not the case as far as the copy I received.)  For a Met production the sound is fine (PCM Stereo- I don't have surround).  It is clearly superior to the Met Lucia of the previous year (see my review of that for details ).  The behind the curtain views between acts or scenes are interesting.  The interviews after Act 2 show the performers to be having a wonderful time. Yes, it might have been better to put them as extras at the end, but really, how hard is it to hit forward a couple of times, or just get up off the couch to get a glass of wine during the intermission.  This is not the big deal the same three star reviewer made of it.

The performance is excellent.  One can always recall a prior performance as better, or a different performer with a better interpretation, but overall this is a joy to watch.  Netrebko starts out a bit slowly in Qeul guardo il cavaliere, but by the end of So anch'io la virtu magica she is in full voice , and she dazzles from then on.  The reviewer with soft video uncharitably  describes her as ""grossly overweight"".  She may have gained a few lbs,  but she is no Stephanie Blythe. To the contrary, she is cast and costumed perfectly as a beautiful, voluptuous man-killer. Her comedic acting is terrific.  Mariusz Kwiecien is wonderful as Dr. Malatesta.  John Del Carlo is fine and in some cases brilliant as Don Pasquale.  No, he does not have the voice of say, Bruson, but he is hilarious and his rapid fire singing very effective and impressive. Matthew Polenzani adds a beautiful, if somewhat light, tenor to the mix.

I am not shy about criticizing opera directors or TV editors. But, I see no reason to complain here. I disagree completely with the same three star reviewer's claim of ""directorial ineptitude""  He seems to base much of that remark on his criticism of James Levine appearing ""too frequently, acting the fool and grinning like a Cheshire cat"". Mystifying comments.  Levine is shown only during the overture or orchestral preludes and gets no more or less air time than is common for conductors on opera Blu-rays.  He is clearly enjoying himself during the rousing overture to Act 1.  This is a comedy after all. Why the conductor enjoying himself during the overture is a problem escapes me.

All in all this is a very enjoyable way to spend a  couple of hours: a great cast, good sound and outstanding picture quality. Highly recommended.
