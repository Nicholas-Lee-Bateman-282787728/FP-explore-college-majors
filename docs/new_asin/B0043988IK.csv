4254220,5,B0043988IK,"Part 3 of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood continues the development of this amazing story.  Part three introduces new important characters (hint, hint, art box) that will affect the course of the series.  There is not as much action in this part as in the previous two.  Instead, the creators focus on character development, and some of the secrets begin to come out.  All this background sets beautifully the turning and concluding stages of the series.  The series is truly becoming an epic tale and one of the best Anime ever.  I cannot wait for the last two parts to come out.  Until then, enjoy this and the firs two parts of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.

Note: if you are worried about space, this package comes in a very compact presentation.",1293926400,,755,4.84375
4254221,5,B0043988IK,"OMG this is the best anime ever i have all of the Original full metal and now 1-2-3 of the brother hood Banch. They are very simmilar in the begining ( not the same) And then they get WAY different latter on. Some how the way they do it makes both ways feel equily right. This is a great anime for Adults. I would not recomend it for anyone less then 15. Very violent and lotd of blood and death. But still very funny. Everyone that has come over while i was aching it has goten sucked in and just has to barrow them from me! Dont miss out you will love this. I also recomend if you like this one the anime Bleach, and Naruto Shippuden( you have to watch Naruto 1-200 to make it make sence thow) Then watch shippuden.

4254223,5,B0043988IK,"If you have been reading the manga for Fullmetal Alchemist, then this series is for you! I was so excited that there would be a re-make of FMA to follow the manga plot line all the way way through to the end. This 3rd Box set contains episodes 27-39, which roughly covers manga volumes 14-18. The animation is superb and vibrantly colored. The wide-screen format adds to the overall feel of the show. Alot of new material is covered in Box-set #3. It is very different than the original FMA anime that was released in 2004. That one didn't follow the original storyline created by manga author Hiromu Arakawa. I personally prefer the manga storyline that is followed in FMA: Brotherhood. It's much deeper and darker, not to mention a far better antagonist called ""Father"" by the Homunculi. I recommend this series to anyone who like great anime or who is a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist in anyway at all! If you have been keeping up with the manga up until now (23 volumes have been released so far by VIZ, with a 24th volume due to be released in January) it's wonderful to see those panels and characters moving and talking and in vibrant, wide-screen color! It's a dream come true to see my all time favorite manga series remade and animated into such a great piece of art. This series will go down in anime history!",1293494400,9,1316,4.533613445378151
4254224,5,B0043988IK,"This is a very simple review. at this point you know how great FMA:B is and this part 3 is no difference since it continues the story. I currently own part 1 and 2 on blu-ray and part 3 i ended up watching it at my friends since somehow he got a early copy. Simply put this part is a letdown from where you were left off at 2, they waste 2 EPs doing nothing before the story starts back up only to have the last EP wanting you to continue the story. But you see the next part is out in April (for DUB at lest) so it's really  a shame they couldn't make this 13 EP a keeper other than just 13 EPs of filler.

I suggest you buy it on sale when it drops to $20 in a few months.",1293408000,,674,3.7062937062937062
4254225,5,B0043988IK,"I got it 10 days early and had a ""nerdgasm"". Watched it all immediately. MASTERPIECE. Don't wait for Adult Swim, buy it NOW. There's not really much to add, except maybe buy from rightstuf for part 4 to get it way earlier.",1292716800,4,222,4.309523809523809
4254226,5,B0043988IK,"Before I get on to my review, I will tell you that I just got this today, because I ordered from Right Stuf. Every time I have ordered from them, I received the pre-order two weeks before it was supposed to be released.

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, like is predecessor  is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who have made a grave mistake and paid for it in a harsh way. Edward lost an arm and a leg, while Alphonse lost his entire body. To correct their mistake, they have gained the resolve to seek out the philosopher's stone, even if they have to join the military as State Alchemists.

In this set, Edward and Alphonse are reunited, after having been separated by Gluttony. He appears in front of Father, the leader of the homunculi. However, things are not so pleasant. After Father restore the brothers' bodies, Father turns Ling into the new Greed.

Afterwards, the brothers make a trip to Briggs in the north, where they encounter Major General Armstrong, sister of Major Alex Louis Armstrong.

FUNimation has been doing a really good job on this series. Sure, a few characters do not sound so good, but by now I am comfortable with the voices. Alphonse, although he sounded really girly in the first episode, seem to be sounding a bit more like he did with he old VA, but not perfectly. The new characters and personas sound really great, especially Pride, Major General Armstrong, and the new Greed. I was thinking that due to how weird Ling sounded at first that Armstrong's voice would not be very good, but I was surprised. Armstrong's voice actor seemed to capture her cruelty really well. Pride's voice was kind of similar to the JP version, but I would not say it is 100% similar. Like Major General Armstrong's voice, Selim's Pride persona was done extremely well. I could sense the coldness in his speech. As for the voice of the new Greed, I would say that it fit really well.

For those disappoint in the airing on Adult Swim, like myself, FUNimation has been good about keep the openings the way they were presented in Japan, going off of how the stream on FUNimation's official video streaming site broadcasted them. The second opening finished up its run on the second set, but we are treat to openings 3 and 4. The only thing I do not like is the sub inconsistency used for the openings and endings that have so far plagued the dub releases of the series. One episode, the subtitles are in English. On the other hand, the next episode has subtitles in Japanese, of course it is in Roman characters.

For those that do not like the dub, the Japanese audio track is available.

Unlike how FUNimation was inconsistent in the last two season sets of Case Closed, I really enjoyed that they have been keeping the dubbing and the handling of the series consistent.

I hope they keep this up for the two or so remaining DVDs to be released (I am basing this off the pattern of 13 episodes each release and the fact that there are 64 episodes).

I would recommend this set to any current FMA fan. As for everyone else, I would definitely recommend watching this series as this show has one of the best and unique stories that are in existence.",1292284800,4,3176,4.565905096660808

Olivier and her brother Alex engage in a thrilling battle with the homunculus Sloth. This makes Olivier and Sloths first appearance of the series. At first I didn't care for Olivier's brass attitude but I grew to love her hardened resolve and willingness to make the tough decisions and sacrifices needed for the care of her country.

4254238,5,B0043988IK,"I know best ever is a bold claim, but it is my favorite. The brotherhood series follows the manga (unlike the first take on the show, but still wonderful) and is just a gritty and desparate. By the third season, the brothers are knee deep into the military's cover ups and experiments gone wrong, and there are very few they can trust. Now the small band has to spread the truth where they can, picking up allies that will help them along the way. There is still so much more to come in ensuing volumes, but parts 3 really starts picking up and offers a lot of insights into what is to come. The great thing about this series is the amazing plot and character development; a lot of time was really put into it; there is no static chareacter or two-dimensional anything. There is a genuine struggle for life, betterment, and the truth, and it's amazing how far some will go (or what they will go through) to get it. It's a beautiful series that in a way, offers insights into the human mind, human behavior, and life/politics/religion, in general.

4254253,5,B0043988IK,"This set begins with a meditative episode as Hohenheim (Ed and Al's father) reflects back on his life. This episode covers a great deal of backstory and explains much of who he is. It also introduces the last of the homunculi and goes into more detail about their plan. Much of this set takes place at the northern fortress of Briggs, an icy wilderness run by General Armstrong, Major Armstrong's sister. She is a highly entertaining character and is as extreme as he is except while his extremes are of emotion hers are of icy competence. Ed and Al are placed in the unusual position of having to dissemble and closely guard what they say lest they endanger people's lives. Mustang is rather restricted in his role but he gets a flashback episode to the Ishvalan massacre which explains much of his character and relationship to others. Scar's story is surprisingly developed and he remains a big deal despite the list of more deadly enemies. By the end of this set the basic outline of the homunculi plan is clear, what remains is only how to stop it.

What's really great about Brotherhood as opposed to the other&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/series/dp/B003SPDSA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">series</a>&nbsp;is how it develops the secondary characters. Characters like Mustang whose character was really only hinted at in the original series is particularly fleshed out. I never understood all the love for Mustang after watching the first anime, he seemed to serve no point, but after this he is just about the most badass of all the characters. The homunculi (apart from Lust, Gluttony, and Envy, the ones established at the beginning of the series) all fit their chosen sin better. I much prefer Bradley as Wrath than as Pride and the new Pride is... memorable. He's the most horrible and powerful one of all. Sloth doesn't leave much of an impression but he seems to fit his sin better than the woman from the first series who had water powers. Naming the homunculi after sins never had a reason in that show. They also have a real plan this time and Father makes a much better villain than Dante. The series also introduce new characters like Lin Yao, General Armstrong, Buccaneer, and Major Miles. All of these characters have strongly defined personalities and get their own moment. Even Yoki of all people gets his minute in the limelight, despite having skipped his introductory episode in the beginning. While the show starts off firmly focused on the Elric brothers by this point it has basically become an ensemble piece. Large segments take place without the Elrics being present at all. While they never lose their position as the leads of the series their quest does become less vital to the plot. Certainly their actions are no longer the driving force behind events.",1315699200,,2831,4.997881355932203
4254254,4,B0043988IK,"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Part Three is a two-disc set that contains episodes twenty-seven through thirty-nine of the series.  The only extra on the first disc is commentary for episode twenty-eight (""Father"").  There are four extras included on the second disc.  The first extra is commentary for episode thirty-six (""Family Portrait"").  The next feature is labeled as ""Textless Opening Song.""  This feature has the first opening credits that were included on this set.  The next feature is labeled as ""Textless Closing Song,"" and it features the first ending credits that were included on this set.  The final extra on the disc is trailers.  On this disc are trailers for: Spice and Wolf, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Sands of Destruction, Tower of Druaga, Birdy the Mighty: Decode, and S.A.V.E.

We have now gotten to a point in the series where many of the characters from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime series are present (as well as some characters introduced in this series), but the story being told has become radically different.  By the end of the second disc in the set, a major revelation is revealed; for me, this revelation came out of left field.  However, this revelation adds a new layer to this series that simply wasn't in the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime.  I have personally enjoyed the new plot twists and turns introduced in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and I'm really looking forward to seeing where the series continues on the next DVD set.

If you're a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, this release is worth picking up and adding to your DVD library.  If you're a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist that must own everything related to the series, this is also worth adding to your collection.  If you're a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist who also enjoys Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, then this set is also worth purchasing.

4254255,5,B0043988IK,"Brotherhood is simply a better story, better animation, more charactor contect and over all a better Fullmetal then the original Fulmetal that came out.

4254256,5,B0043988IK,"Theres nothing that I can say that the previous reviews haven't mentioned already. This is really one of the few modern classic animes of this generation. So many memorable characters, stunning animation, flawless voice acting, and and incredible story Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is easily one of best animes of all time. I know I may be hyping up this series a little toooo much but honestly my comments are more of an understatement. A lot of people tend to compare and contrast between Brotherhood and the original series, but THIS DVD is really where Brotherhood  seperates itself as the superior series.

Once again the DVD extras are a bummer, only 2 commentaries on two of the episodes on the DVD textless opening and closing credits. I swear to God if FUNimation does not put decent extras on Part 5, I will reconsider buying their merchandises. But anyways this DVD contains episodes 27-39 and these are fantastic episodes. Compared to the previous episodes, these episodes are much more moody and less light hearted then the previous episodes. The story just keeps getting better and better and the voice acting actually feels more surreal as the series goes on. The only voice actor I would change is Scar, Dameon Clarke was the voice of Scar in the original series and he did a suberb job, but this new voice actor doesn't really capture the pain and anger the original Scar had. But other then that this is A MUST BUY, the only flaw it has it the fact that once episode 39 ends your just gonna want more and MORE. So I suggest you buy Part 4 while your at it before you go insane of craving for more Brotherhood haha :P",1307836800,,1637,4.641379310344828

4254258,5,B0043988IK,"What can I say about Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood that hasn't been said by one guy to the next guy, Fullmetal Alchemist is a GREAT SERIES and its a MUST SEE. Unlike the ""First"" Fullmetal Alchemist series by Bones, this Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood follows the original working of Hiromu Arakawa, its in a sense the TRUE VERSION of her story, and its a HELL OF A GOOD ONE. In fact GOOD dose not even come close to describe the story, its (in my opinion) Speechless. It will make you laugh, smile and cry, its that FOO-KING GOOD.

Voice Acting is PERFECT in both languages (English and Japanese)

Animation/ Art Style is PERFECT, if anyone here loves Disney Movies, Square Enix has got beat, and if they decide to produce cartoon moves (not Anime Movies) Disney watch your back because they have better animators and artist.

Story/ Plot - Speechless, the story is good, I personally have READ the Manga (Japanese Comic) from being to end, watch the Fansub (Japanese to English translation that are uploaded for sharing and watching wonderful and skillful people who are just fans of Anime), watch the English Version on Cartoon Network (same as Japanese just with English Voice Actors) and many more times and it still dosent get old. I showed this to friends who dislike many Anime and they loved it, showed it to family members, they loved it.

Hiromu Arakawa has created a CLASSIC, its a must see, owe it to yourself to watch it, use Netflix, ask a friend, if you have it watch it on Cartoon Network, or even use P2P. I Guarantee that you will be speechless, and you will want to own this EPIC STORY of Edward and Alphonse Elric. PURCHASING THIS RIGHT NOW, YOU WONT REGRET IT!",1306281600,,1684,4.640939597315437

4254260,5,B0043988IK,"Ok, I'm one of the rare few folks who started into watching FMA:Brotherhood without having seen the original series at all. To be honest, while I like some shounen series like DBZ, I do find the classic shounen anime cliches and tropes to get a little repetitive and when the original FMA series aired on US TV, I caught a few random eps and it seemed pretty good, but something about the show failed to hook me in. Fast foward to the present and I learned about the new remake series that came out in 2009 and thought 'whats the point?' and was intrigued at the premise that this series follows the manga series faithfully, which was reportedly a much better story than the original anime, which thru no fault of its own, had a very incomplete (barely the first quarter) manga story to work with. They stretched out what they had to work with into half a tv series then completed the rest with their own original storyline that concluded with an ending that runs hot or cold with fans.

Luckily, hearing about FMA:Bro late, the entire series was already aired and fansubbed but since the first 4 volumes were out commercially, I rented all the available discs released by Funimation and finished the rest of the series with what I could find elsewhere. And all I can say is:

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood probably ranks among my top 10 favorite anime series...of all time.

And that is saying something for someone who has been watching anime since the late 80s. Eventually I watched the original series afterwards which I found relatively dissapointing compared to this incredible successor.

Part 3 covers eps 27-39 and continues the story which rolls along with the momentum of a freight train, never slowing down and growing with increasing intensity.  Now the characters find themselves heading to the northern parts of Amnestris and encountering yet more new characters in the form of the warriors of Briggs northern fortress and one of the most badass characters of the series, Major Armstrong's sister, Olivier, who despite her looks, is one of the fiercest warriors and strongest personalities of the new show.  Further plot twists and intrigues continue to develop what turns out to be a complex and nationwide conspiracy affecting all levels of the government and military and while the grand plan is still not yet made clear by this volume, it is clear that all the characters will be affect and their roles will be revealed soon.  We see the continued evolution of Scar, the return of Crimson alchemist Kimblee, and introduction of new Homunculi, with one of the scariest characters ever seen in a non-horror anime ever, the new Pride.  And for fans of the original series, you will be absolutely shocked to find out the identity of this character.  We also continue to follow the development and growth of protagonists Ed and Al Elric as well and while I didn't mention this in my review of the first two parts, the newly written brothers come off as much more complex, mature, and believable than their previous incarnations and having the fortune of good screenwriters, their dialogue also comes off much more natural as they don't sound like broken records, giving really blunt 'explain everything' expository dialogue or spouting 'equivalent exchange' rhetoric ad nauseum like they did in the original series.

Another thing I'd like to add is the animation, while I said in previous reviews how it is far superior to the original show, it's not just more updated anime techniques, but better, more sophisticated cinematography, making this new show feel more theatrical compared to the more flat, tv-like look of the original series.  Plus the fluid crisp animation really shines with the mind blowing fight choreography that is seen all over the show.  To me the original show featured very boring 'Hollywood movie' like fight scenes that are crude and unsophisticated, while the new series shows fast pace, dynamic fight scenes that resembles the best of Jackie Chan & Jet Li in terms of the eye-popping visuals.

Can I say more about this amazing chapter to an already amazing series?  If you're watching part 3, that means you've already watched parts 1 & 2 and I can assure you, while they were good, this only continues to get better!",1303516800,,4264,4.855371900826446

4254264,5,B0043988IK,"I have seen both seasons from start to finish (Inc Brotherhood)
The 2nd version is by far a better scripted version it has alot more story too and the pace is much faster (2 Episodes per Novel seems right)
Their have been some good (Evangelion) & BAD (Negima!?) remakes in the past but this is by the best and should be the bench mark for all others to come.

In regards to IMPORT tho, I'm a REGION B buyer and unlike Part 1 & 2 Which were AB, it is now but just A, its kind of a double whammy since Manga here in the UK stopped making them after part 2 (30 each certainly didn't help matters)
If you don't live in the US and want to import you will need a Region A Compatable Player
The best I can advise are (Japanese) 60GB PS3's with the UK AC & PC's with Blu Ray Drives (The 7 times rule will count here tho)

4254269,5,B0043988IK,"In Japan, ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" (Hagane no Renkinjutushi) has been a popular long running anime and manga series created by mangaka Hiromu Arakawa. The original manga series was serialized in Square Enix's ""Shonen Gangan"" since 2001, while the 51-episode TV series created by BONES was shown on television in 2004 and was followed by a film to conclude the series.

The popularity of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" has led to many novels, OVA's, drama CD's, soundtracks and video games and a lot of these releases have been distributed in various countries and its popularity is a testament of how people have come to love the series which has won many awards in Japan including being voted for the #1 most popular anime series of all time.

Despite it's popularity, the series could have gone on longer but because the anime series was created when the manga was only several years old, the anime series only lasted 51-episodes and there were differences between what the director featured on the anime series and what Arakawa had in the manga.

So, in 2009, a new series titled ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" (Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Furumetaru Arukemisuto) was created by BONES and this time around, the series would follow the manga much more closely. Currently there are over 60 episodes that have aired in Japan and the series is still ongoing. Also, unlike the previous anime series, this series would be created in HD (540p). The first 13 episodes of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" would feature its first 13-episodes covering the first 26-episodes from the original anime series but from that point on, the series becomes a whole new storyline which features more characters and for the most part, something new and different for the viewers, especially fans of the original series.

To make sure that there is a difference between this series aside from the storyline differences compared to the original, the staff is different this time around as well as the character designs. The director for ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" would be Yasuhiro Irie (who worked on RahXephon"", ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Macross Plus"", ""Gunparade March""), series composition by Hiroshi Ohnogi (""Eureka Seven"", ""Area 88, ""Aquarion"", ""RahXephon"", ""RIN"", ""Skullman""), music by Akira Senju (""Red Garden"", ""Mobile Suit Victory Gundam"", ""Silent Service""), character designs by Hiroki Kanno (""Angelic Layer"", ""Eureka Seven"", ""Ninja Scroll"", ""RahXephon"") and art design by Takeshi Satou (""Mobile Suit Gundam 00', ""Ghost Slayers Ayashi"", ""Please Twins!"").

""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is a series about two young alchemist brothers named Edward and his younger brother Alphonse Eric (aka ""Al""). Their father left them and several months after their father left, an epidemic hit their village and killed their mother. Grieving and alone without their mother, the two quickly tried to hone their alchemist skills and hope to bring their mother back alive by using a human transmutation (this is illegal and considered taboo by alchemist).

While performing the transmutation, a dark shadow comes and literally breaks apart the body of Alphonse and as for Edward, he is shown ""the truth"" but in return for doing the transmutation, there is a toll and in this case, he loses his legs and feet and his right arm. And the transmutation to bring their mother fails as Edward was only able to revive a disembodied figure. In a short time allowed before the dark shadow leaves, Edward was able to bond Al's soul to a suit of armor but there are some consequences. And these consequences and guilt have plunged Edward to the lowest he had ever been.

Meanwhile, a military figure named Roy Mustang has come and is shocked to see that Edward was able to survive a human transmutation and also anchoring his brother's soul and thus gives Edward a chance to join the military to fight with them but at the same time, gaining access that may give Edward a chance to bring his brother back to life and also his own body as well.

With this opportunity, this gives Edward a chance to repair what he did wrong and help his brother. But as they investigate on how they can get their bodies back and investigating what is known as a ""Philosopher's Stone"", an unknown group is out there, observing his every move and willing to kill in order to get to Edward.

In part two of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"", we learn that Bradley is a homunculus and that the homunculus may have infiltrated the State Military.

In part three, Ed and Al continue their search of how to get their bodies back but meanwhile, Scar tries to find out the truth of why the Ishvalans were massacred.  Meanwhile, Ed and Al find themselves in the North needing Olivier's help but can they divulge the information about Bradley, the Fuhrer is a homunculus?  Meanwhile, Ed and Al find themselves teaming up with the people they have been against.

VIDEO:

""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Part Three"" is presented in 1080p HD 169 via a HD native source. It's important to note that although the conversion was made to 1080p, I've read that the actual Japanese original masters were created in 540p. With that being said, this is a TV series and one can't expect OVA or film quality but I manage to compare the DVD and Blu-ray version and the Blu-ray looks much more colorful, much more detailed and looked much better and more colorful than its DVD counterpart.

I did notice edge enhancement and I'm sure the conversion of a 540p source to 1080p possibly led to the jaggies that can be seen at times. Granted, I'm a bit picky when it comes to video quality but the fact that this is created by BONES (a busy anime production company) and the fact that this is not an OVA or film, for a TV series, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" looks very good. Granted, it's not uber-vibrant but there is a good amount of shading, detail, blacks are deep and overall, I felt the Blu-ray looked much better than its DVD counterpart.

AUDIO:

""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Part Three"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and in Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0. Overall, the 5.1 lossless soundtrack sounds very good and there is a good amount of surround usage and its much more immersive than its Japanese lossless counterpart. There is quite a bit of action in this second volume, plenty of battles are featured and many episodes that utilize the surround channels.

The Japanese lossless soundtrack is still good, especially if you have a receiver in which you can change the setting to stereo on all channels. I do prefer the Japanese lossless soundtrack in terms of acting especially during the more emotional moments in this second volume (which there are many). But I've watched the series in both Japanese and English and for the most part, both are well done and similar to ""Dragon Ball Z"" and ""One Piece"", the English dub has caught my attention and this time around, I was watching many of the episodes in English. But both voice acting are well done.

Subtitles are in English.

NOTE: You can not use your audio button to switch from Japanese to English and vice versa while watching the series. You will need to press your guide button to switch to another audio. Also, you can not optionally remove English subtitles unless you choose the English lossless soundtrack. So, for those who want to watch the series in Japanese with no English subtitles may be disappointed by this.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Part Three"" comes with the following special features:

  * EPISODE 28 Commentary - Audio commentary by Mike McFarland (ADR Director/Line Producer and voice of Havoc) and voice talents Wendy Powell (Envy) and Kent Williams (Narrator/Father).
  * EPISODE 36 Commentary - Audio commentary by Mike McFarland (ADR Director/Line Producer and voice of Havoc) and voice talents J. Michael Tatum (Scar), Stephanie Young (Olivier) and Phil Parsons (Buccaneer).
  * Textless Opening and Closing Songs - The textless opening and ending theme songs.
  * Trailers - FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The third volume features episodes 27-39 and showcases more battles between the Elric brothers and the homunculus but most of all, seeing them team up with Scar.

And as the suspense continues with Roy Mustang trying to uncover more details of the homunculus infiltration into the military, one character that we are introduced to, that was an interesting addition to the series is Olivier Mira Armstrong, older sister of Alex Louis Armstrong and if you thought Alex was tough,  his sister Olivier is not just tough, she's a no-nonsense, impatient, cold, kick-ass character!

The Briggs storyline was actually fun to watch, despite Ed and Al being limited as Olivier and the others don't quite trust them (as the two have to hold back information from Olivier). Another storyline which I found very cool in this latest volume of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is more character development for Riza Hawkeye, her past and if anything, giving viewers a more intimate side of the alchemist.

Overall, I really enjoyed part three of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" and how well-paced, how action-packed and how much deeper the episodes were. This latest volume was quite addicting and I definitely enjoy how the series has continued to grow and improve with each episode.

As for the Blu-ray release, as explained with my review for the first volume, some people may have issues that this series is not true 1080p but created in 540p and then upscaled to 1080p. As many Japanese companies are going through cost-cutting situations due to their economy, we are going to see some anime released in 4:3 instead of widescreen and we are going to see Japanese companies not taking advantage of true 1080p and focusing on creating anime series in 540p. It's the nature of the industry right now and if we want to support anime, we'll need to support them even during these tough times.

But with that being said, I was able to compare the DVD and the Blu-ray release of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" and the artistic backgrounds and its details are much better looking on Blu, the colors are more cleaner, sharper and more colorful on Blu and for the most part, for a TV series, I'm quite content with the PQ. I felt the black levels were good and again, for a TV Series released in 2009, the picture quality is good not great (it's not 1080p) and there is a hint of edge enhancement but it's still pretty good.

Overall, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" may not please the diehards who have loved the original anime TV series but the fact is, we are getting a series that is now closer to the manga series and also more episodes than the original release. Not to say one should forget the original series but in a way, the ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" brand has moved on to bigger and better and the FMA: Brotherhood series is much more consistent to what the creator, Hiromu Arakawa intended.

""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" has the making of a great anime series and part three continues the excitement of the previous two volumes.  Definitely put this series high on top of your anime on Blu-ray list!",1296259200,2,12761,4.846082949308756
4254270,5,B0043988IK,"I just got boxset 3 of FMA Brotherhood.  Although I still think it's ridiculous that FUNimation broke the serious into 5 parts, my love for this show cannot keep me from buying them.  Besides...it's only one guilty pleasure.  Anyways!  I am excited to say that the cover of the boxes and the four postcards I receive with each boxset definitely makes up some of the annoyance of buying them like this.  The product is definitely worth it if you are a collector like me and have the money to spare.  I'm just sadden that my 4 new postcards for boxset 3 don't match that of the ones advertised on the website.  :(  I was so looking forward to having two postcards with Hughes on them.  :(  Ah well...I'll live.

Good, solid story telling in a pretty package.",1295568000,,454,5.04
4254272,5,B0043988IK,"I was an original fan of the first anime series, but found the ending disappointing as nothing good really happened for any of the characters. Since I've found brotherhood, I have come to love this series even more to where it is now my favorite show. The first anime dealt more with physics and science while brotherhood deals with more metaphysical subjects with a grander scope and vision. This is the third season to brotherhood and it is amazing. We meet Major Armstrong's cold, fearless sister Olivier and she definitely lives up to her ice queen reputation. This season isn't action-oriented like the previous season, but it is quite interesting. This season we meet the first and most powerful of the seven homonculi Pride and the dimwitted Sloth. I liked the Sloth of the first anime moreso than this one, but I have to say that Wrath totally outclasses his former anime's equal. Wrath is one bad dude in this anime with a sleeker look and uncanny fighting abilities. The new Greed is also introduced and we meet Father, the mysterious puppeteer of the homonculi with unbelievable power. Envy, though not as ruthless as in the first anime, shows a terrible side we have never seen before. This show has restored my faith in television and has given me something to look forward to on adult swim. Buy it asap!",1295308800,,1317,4.730434782608696
4254273,5,B0043988IK,"I usually receive the Blu-Ray versions of anime but somehow ended up with ordering the DVD version. The DVD version still comes with the postcards which are nice and two discs (which the Blu-Ray comes with two discs too).  Really the only difference I noticed between the DVD version as compared to my previous FMA Brotherhood Blu-Ray versions is a slight difference in the sharpness of the font on the credits screen at the end of the set, and maybe in sound quality, but otherwise, the anime itself still looked great.

That being said, this set of episodes was excellent.  The first episode (27) was what most anime fans call a clip show, that is to say, it recounts the events of the previous 26 episodes, as if it is the first episode of a new season or so.  This was great as we finally get more information the family of the Elric brothers but it also flows right into the cliffhanger that the previous episode that ended the part 3, and the plot continues from there.  The revelations were as excellent as the previous volume and the action flow was excellent.  I must admit, this volume has definitely hooked me onto the show and the final episode left me begging for more. There was never a dull moment in this set.  A few more interesting characters are also introduced in this set of episodes and are excellent.  They have great convincing English voice actors and are a blast to listen too, especially the character that is on the cover of this set.

The opening and ending are excellent and grew on me. By the time the opening 3 changed, I was really digging it and missed.  The set closes with the introduction of a fourth opening and ending song, which I think have great clips and are decent.

As usual the show is offered subtitled and with a choice of Japanese or English dubbing.  There is also extra content such as commentary for two of the episodes.",1295222400,,1872,4.505917159763314

Video - Amazing. The blu-ray quality just makes the unique brush stroke effects of the show pop out beautifully. Who new an animated show could look this good?

Sound - Crisp and clear. If you have surround sound, this sound is nearly unbeatable. If you don't, you are still getting brilliant sound quality regardless.

Extras - Not much there. An episode or two with commentary and the opening and closing credits without subs. But the sparkling cover art and collectible postcards make up for it in my opinion.

If you are a fan of good story, intuitive animation, or great shows in general, you owe it to yourself to buy this and every other part of this amazing series.",1295136000,,826,4.636986301369863

i.dont.read.the.manga.
there, i said it.
BUT i watch too much anime.  really. i should probably stop.
so therefore my opinion matters (dangit)

just kidding, i am not going to spew my opinions at you, but i will say this:
this is kind of good.  i mean, i looooooved the first series and everyone and their mom blabs on and on about how this one is sooo much better and its truer to the manga and yippy yah doo dow etc.
the first series (watch that instead or at least first) is a little slower paced and has a little less action, but it has an immeasurable amount of story and emotional drama, twists and reveals.
this one kind of throws everything at you and doesnt give you a reason to give a crap about any of the characters.  it is pretty though.  and the action is awesome.
