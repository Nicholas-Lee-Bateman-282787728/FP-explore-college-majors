7982346,5,B00008F232,"Chicago, 1930, gangsters are running amok in the city trying to take it over. Tommy guns and hand grenades are as common a sight on the streets as cell phones are today. At the top of the chain (and the most wanted list) is Al Capone. The police dept is as corrupt as the gangsters. Enter the United States Treasury Dept and it's top agent Elliot Ness. Ness will use every LEGAL means necessary to get Capone , and make the streets of Chicago safe. He forms a small task force, which include a 20 year beat cop, a rookie sharpshooter, and another treasury agent who is an accountant. Bloody battles ensue, as they go after Capone and his men, and in the end as history tells us they get him on tax evasion.

Everything about this film is terrific. The acting is right on. Kevin Costner plays a very convincing Elliot Ness, Robert DeNiro plays Capone as cool as the other side of the pillow, Sean Connery  took home a best supporting actor Oscar as the savvy beat cop, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith all turn in excellent performances. Also look for Billy Drago as ""Netti"". Written by David Mamet, the story pulls you into it. The emotional score by Ennio Morricone stays with you long after the view, and under the direction of Brian De Palma, this is an incredible film. There are some heart stopping scenes done in slo-mo that really keep you on the edge of your seat. I was very impressed by the 1930's costume designs.

A film that stands up to many repeated viewings....enjoy...Laurie",1128124800,,1495,4.509225092250922
