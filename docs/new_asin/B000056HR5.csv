7931974,5,B000056HR5,"Zoboomafoo is one of our family's favorite PBS kids shows.  It teaches about animal behavior as well as responsible human behavior toward animals.  It is absorbing entertainment for our daughter without being annoying to the parents.  While Barney, Dragon Tales, Sesame Street, and others send me fleeing to my bedroom to escape the obnoxious noises and pseudo-music, I actually enjoy watching Zoboomafoo with my daughter.  Watching together and talking about what we have seen enhances the educational experience for her as well.  We were so disappointed when our PBS station stopped carrying this show, but we are pleased to own three videos of it.  We would like to see more of them made available -- we would buy them in heartbeat.",1125878400,,735,5.033057851239669
