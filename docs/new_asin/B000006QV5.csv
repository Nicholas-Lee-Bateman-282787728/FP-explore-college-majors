7904926,5,B000006QV5,Great book of WWII history. Not quite as graphic as Sledge's work The Old Breed. Told from a slightly different perspective than Sledge's albeit the two men were in the same unit.,1298764800,,179,4.625
7904927,5,B000006QV5,"The amphibious assaults of the Central Pacific islands were fiercely  fought, costly in casualties, and extremely complex operations involving  the necessity for close coordination of Marines, Army, Navy, and the  various units within those services against the uncertainty and chaos of  battle. In each successive island assault the U.S. and Japanese forces  learned lessons and improved their tactics and capabilities. By the time of  the battle for Peleliu, the Japanese had long given up on trying to turn  back the amphibious assault waves at the beaches. They did, though, meet  the invaders with enough firepower to cause disruption and exact  casualties. They pinned their slim hopes on the battle once it moved  inland, sniping at infantrymen from caves and pillboxes and turning  Peleliu's coral ridges into killing zones. Their strategy was to kill as  many Americans as possible, hoping that they would lose heart in a  protracted battle. They seriously misjudged the resolve of the Marines. It  cost the Americans almost 10,000 casualties, with nearly 1,200 dead. The  Japanese fought to practically the last man, losing an estimated 16,000.  This victory over the Japanese defenders remains a controversial one.  Admiral Halsey warned Nimitz only a few days before the assault on the  dangers of invading Peleliu, deeming it an unnecessary waste of American  lives for the limited value of the island, and in fact argued for a major  revision of the whole Pacific strategy. This documentary gives a clear,  moving account of the complexities of this type of assault, and of the  bloodiness of war. Particularly interesting is the on-camera commentary of  Eugene B. Sledge, the Marine mortarman who wrote the acclaimed account of  his experiences, With The Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa, because he  remembers so clearly and articulates so well his inner thoughts at various  stages of the battle. He is honest and straightforward about the hardships  and fears of the infantryman. This documentary also contains rare color  footage of combat. A warning to the faint of heart: It also has some  graphic footage showing the horrors of flamethrowers. The Bloody Hills of  Peleliu does not aim to cover any one aspec of the battle in great detail.  It is, though, a very informative and critical look at this neglected  battle. You might also want to read Storm Landings: Epic Amphibious Battles  in the Central Pacific, by Col. Joseph H. Alexander, who was a consultant  and on-camera commentator for this docmentary, and The Devil's Anvil: The  Assault On Peleliu, by James H. Hallas, as well Sledge's book mentioned  earlier.",959904000,13,2642,5.177725118483412
