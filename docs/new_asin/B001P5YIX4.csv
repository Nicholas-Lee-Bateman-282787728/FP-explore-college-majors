3738755,3,B001P5YIX4,I got this DVD for my almost 3 year old who is obsessed with garbage trucks. He loves watching garbage trucks on Youtube over and over again so I thought I'd free up my computer by getting this one. It shows the construction of garbage trucks and does some education about landfills. He really enjoys watching it but he and I wish there was more plain ol' garbage men loading garbage and crushing it. That is what he really wants and loves.,1318896000,,440,4.378048780487805
3738756,5,B001P5YIX4,"Nothing is more exciting to my 4 and 5-year-old grandsons than garbage trucks.  I got this as a birthday gift for each of them, and their mothers report that they love it, and watch it over and over.  Great gift idea!",1313712000,,217,4.2682926829268295
3738757,5,B001P5YIX4,"This DVD is definitely worth purchasing if you have a toddler who loves garbage trucks.  My son loves this video, it keeps him entertained and it's educational. It's not too long, or annoying to watch as a parent.  I'm definitely going to order him some of the other titles in this collection.  We highly recommend it!",1308182400,,318,4.642857142857143
3738758,5,B001P5YIX4,"We have the ""How'd They Build That"" for cement trucks and garbage trucks.  My son is two and he will ask to watch these over and over and over again.  And I admit it, I was glued to the TV at first too (I mean really, how DO they build those big mixers?).",1303948800,2,255,3.792452830188679
3738759,5,B001P5YIX4,"This video, along with the others in the series (School Bus, Big Truck, Garbage Truck and Concrete Truck) have kept my boys busy for hours and hours. I have three boys, 3 and 5 and 6, and they all sit glued to the tv watching the different scenes over and over (don't worry, I do give them breaks!). The scenes are all fun and the boys can't get enough of the sounds, the dirt and the BIG TRUCKS. These videos were totally worth the money and I recommend them. The kids love to see how things are made and how things work. :-)",1272844800,,526,4.116504854368932
3738760,5,B001P5YIX4,My grand kids loved the video!  It was an interesting and very educational video even for us older folks.  We see these garbage trucks every day but never give a thought as to how much there is to them.  Great value for the price.  Thanks!,1252281600,7,239,4.2444444444444445
3738761,5,B001P5YIX4,"My son is obsessed with garbage trucks!!!!  He loves playing with his garbage truck toys and he loves watching the real ones work in the neighborhood.  When I saw this dvd on Amazon I knew he would love it!  With all the garbage truck ""stuff"" he has and everything he knows about garbage trucks- the one thing he hasn't learned yet is how the trucks are made.  This video shows children the process of creating these high tech trucks from beginning to end while using language that is easily understood by younger viewers.  My son loves watching this dvd and wants me to get him the rest of the videos in the ""How'd They Build That"" series.  I would definitely recommend this to any parent with a child who loves not only garbage trucks, but loves to see how things are made and how things work.",1250812800,10,795,4.410958904109589
3738782,1,B001P5YIX4,My son would not watch this dvd for more than a few minutes. It is not footage of garbage trucks in action it is literally a tutorial on how they build garbage trucks. I hope that if my son is still fascinated by garbage trucks in a few year he will be able to enjoy it then.,1411430400,,275,3.8421052631578947
3738783,5,B001P5YIX4,"Really great for any garbage truck lover. It is fascinating to see how garbage trucks are built & they show all three types of trucks. We have 6 other garbage videos & most show more of what happens at the land fills and only a few minutes of the actual truck. Not this one! Only the last 10 minutes show trash post pick-up, the rest is all garbage trucks. The best video we have found & by far our favorite to watch.",1407628800,,417,4.097560975609756
3738784,5,B001P5YIX4,"My son is going through a 'garbage truck' phase and this keeps him fairly happy, he seems to enjoy the trucks (of which there are a lot of)! He does skip around a lot but being as he is autistic he does that anyway and as long as he is happy off of wifi I'm happy and this keeps him occupied while we shop which is no small feat believe you me, when there is no youtube to what his garbage trucks he throws a FIT! In the few minutes I've seen of it, it seems like an interesting vid for what it is. Hope this was helpful if it was pls rate as helpful thx.",1403481600,2,555,3.793103448275862
3738785,4,B001P5YIX4,"This is a good educational DVD for fans of those much appreciated sanitation workers and their fan gathering monster trucks!  My 3 year old grandson loves watching the trash trucks at work and he loves this video.  Its content is a little advanced for a three year old, it's kind of a promotional video for McNeilis trucks, but it's still very interesting and my grandson watches it several times a day.  Think it would be more fun if it showed more of the trash trucks at  work but still a nice video.  I learned something watching it too.",1397865600,,540,4.469387755102041
3738786,3,B001P5YIX4,I have a 22 month old who is obsessed with garbage trucks. He prefers youtube videos of garbage trucks over this right now. It is informative though and I think it has future potential if he continues to love garbage trucks as much as he does right now. I think this video will be perfect when he is about 3 or 4.,1393804800,,313,4.064516129032258
3738787,4,B001P5YIX4,"I rented this instead of buying it, and I should have bought it.  My two year old and three year old loved it.  They watched it about a dozen times before the rental expired.  If your kids love to race out to watch the dump truck, just buy this one.  I wish I had.",1390867200,,264,3.8333333333333335

3738789,5,B001P5YIX4,Bought this for my 3 year old nephew as one of his birthday gifts.  Since he lives in another state I can simply report that I was told he really enjoyed this as well as the other garbage truck DVD's.  He's a little guy that loves garbage trucks!,1385078400,,246,4.104166666666667
3738790,5,B001P5YIX4,My four year old loves this DVD! There are a lot of scenes with trash trucks on the job along with how they are built. I was also very happy with the delivery time of this product. I ordered it on a Sunday and received it the next day. Highly recommended!,1379376000,,255,4.019607843137255
3738791,5,B001P5YIX4,Another one of those my grandson loves. He will watch this to the end with no interruptions. Well worth the couple bucks.,1377734400,,121,4.545454545454546

3738814,5,B001P5YIX4,Same factory as the Concrete Truck series.  They actually show the process of manufacturing the trucks.  It is interesting and informative for kids and adults alike.,1362182400,,165,5.3076923076923075
3738815,5,B001P5YIX4,"My 3 year old loves all of the ""How'd they build that"" DVD's that we have seen so far.  We first found them at our local library and he loved this one so much that I decided to buy it.  It is very informative, yet fast-moving enough to keep a pre-schooler's attention.  I find myself looking at each garbage truck I pass on the road now to see if it was made at the McNeilus company.  Lol!",1360108800,,389,4.012987012987013
3738816,5,B001P5YIX4,"My Grandson is 4 years old and loves this entire set of How'd They Build that Videos.  He can resight nearly the whole videos.  They are so educational and its so refreshing to see my Grandsons mind focussed on these amazing videos and not some of the other rubbish on the market today.  Check out the other videos too, they are ALL amazing.  On a side note, I was so impressed that the Customer Service at Marvellous Media actually PHONED me a few days before Christmas in response to my order.  I had ordered for my Grandsons birthday which was AFTER Christmas.  The company were panicking that I would not receive it in time for Christmas.  Can you imagine that kind of customer service ???",1359676800,,693,4.496

3738818,4,B001P5YIX4,"My son is obsessed with garbage trucks and since this is the only movie on Amazon related to garbage trucks, we rent it frequently. He loves the scenes of the trucks in action, but since he is 2, he isn't really interested in how the trucks are made. I don't think he understands what they are building. However, I now can tell you how trucks are made and the various types of garbage trucks. :) Not bad for 1.99 for a week.",1358121600,,424,4.182926829268292

3738820,3,B001P5YIX4,My boys are 2 1/2  and the narration was lost on them. They really enjoy seeing videos of trash trucks in action.,1356393600,,113,4.136363636363637
3738821,3,B001P5YIX4,"This was a decent video on the building of garbage trucks.  I've got a couple of young boys (3 and 5) who are going through a garbage truck phase and they really enjoy almost any book/movie about the trucks.  Though this one is good, it is geared toward children a little older than 3 and 5.  The commentary is done in a straight-forward, teaching voice rather than a voice overly animated for children.  Also, there is no animation of any kind.  Overall, it was good and my boys sat down to watch it on 3 occasions but their attention was only held for 5 to 10 minutes.",1343692800,,570,4.289719626168225
8332163,5,B001P5YIX4,"Very interesting and entertaining DVD on how garbage trucks are made! This DVD was perfect to answer my sons daily question, how did they build the garbage truck?! Product arrived brand new in a sealed DVD case. Great quality and price. My son and I have watched this DVD at least 10 times since Easter, no joke! I like how this DVD takes place in a more recent setting, maybe around mid-90s compared to the Mighty Machines, taking place in the 80s. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys garbage trucks or interested in how they are made.",1523318400,,555,4.5049504950495045
8332164,5,B001P5YIX4,My 3 year old loves this video. It is high quality and does a great job of explaining every step in manufacturing. Makes us want to visit the plant!,1522454400,,148,4.137931034482759
