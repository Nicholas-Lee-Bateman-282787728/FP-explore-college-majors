5892767,5,B00E69VJZ6,"This was a great collection to get, and at a great price.  It comes with every episode of the original Neon genesis Evangelion TV series as well as both of the movies that were made after it (""Death and Rebirth"", and ""End of Evangelion"").  Most other Neon Genesis collections I have seen are out of print and pretty expensive, so this particular collection is defiantly the cheepest way of owning the entire series(You can think of the movies as a nice bonus).  But don't let the low price bother you; this collection has excellent quality and looks very professionally made.  It comes with four DVDs (3 of which contain all 26 episodes of the TV series, while the fourth one contains the 2 movies).  The DVDs are all packaged nicely enough,  the picture quality is good(not Blu-Ray quality of course, but still good) and the DVD menus are simple and easy to use.  It comes with both the original  English Dub audio as well as with the original Japanese audio with English subtitles.  So all in all, if you are even the slightest bit interested in this series, I would defiantly recommend this collection over some of the more expensive ones out there.  As for the series itself, I highly recommend it.  I haven't seen the whole series yet at the time I am writing this review( I am currently on episode 20 of 26), but so far, I can defiantly say that it's one of the best anime series I have seen.  The characters are interesting and relatable(especially the main character Shinji, who in my opinion is one of the most relatable characters in any tv series I have seen) the action is great, and the story keeps your interest through the entire series( although the story does start to get pretty strange towards the later episodes).  Also, unlike many other tv shows I have seen, this series never had a boring episode.  Every episode is entertaining and adds something to the overall plot.  Whether it's more character depth or more revelations of the plot, every episode manages to keep your attention and feels relevant.  The animation isn't the best at times, but the story is so interesting that you probobly won't even notice, plus the artwork and designs of everything are great.
My only real problem with this series is its use of religious imagery(there's a lot of it in here).  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind using religious imagery in movies and tv shows,(I'm a Christian myself) but the way they use it in this series can seem rather unessasary.  They basically take different elements from various other religions and sort of combine them into their own strange and bizar mythology.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but it can kind of be uncomfortable to watch at times if you are a religious person.  I've read that supposedly the creators of the show only used religious imagery as an aesthetic to give the show a more ""rare and exotic look"" and that what it feels like. If you do want to own the entire series for a good price, then this product is definitely for you.",1467676800,20,2988,4.5913370998116765
5892768,3,B00E69VJZ6,"I'd give this a 5, but I bought two sets of the series and films and they have a strange issue in the episode where Rei confronts Asuka in the elevator about Asuka using Eva as a means of getting praise, it's all glitchy, as though the disc were scratched (which neither were, and malfunctioned in the same episode). If others don't have this issue, please contact me: strobify@yahoo.com. I would love to have the full series without glitching.",1463529600,3,444,4.632911392405063

5892770,5,B00E69VJZ6,"Awesome new product at a fraction of the cost for used Evangelion. I looked everywhere. Dvd video quality is good. Widescreen not fullscreen, which is good. Sound quality is excellent, comes across very clear. Menus are easy to understand and navigate. Pretty happy to have the entire tv series now. The 2 movies are an added bonus. Seller was quick on shipping and responded to my email question lightning fast. I will definitely be going back for more anime series. Keep up the good work Jae Video.",1461196800,8,500,4.758620689655173

5892786,4,B00E69VJZ6,"Yes, while this is not the most official of copies...it is still an effective compilation of episodes and movies each with good quality in terms of resolution, good subs and a great amount of content for the price. Sadly, i had to return this product because within some third party, mass copied dvds of animated films, there exists a ""frame shake"" or animation shake between the different scenes/frames of animation. This seems to occur when making copies of copies, but will not be entirely noticeable for those watching for the first time. But, for those returning to this series and looking for a definitive copy; i personally could not deal with it. On the other hand, the return customer service was very fast and efficient. My shipping was even paid for. As a side note, I even got a little extra DvD gift with my original purchase. I do recommend this if u have a beginner to moderate interest in this anime, while hardcore fans and viewers may want to pass this up.",1468454400,4,974,4.635838150289017

8601957,5,B00E69VJZ6,"Just got this in today, so apologies if you were hoping for a review of this series.  This is a review of the product itself.
This is exactly what I was hoping for in terms of content, quality, and price.  There's only so much one can expect from a DVD presentation of a 21 year old animated series, and the picture and sound are as clear and crisp as one could hope.  I read some complaints about ""frame shake"" in other reviews, and noticed a very slight amount in certain shots, but the animation is dynamic enough and the ""camera"" is in motion in many shots so I don't consider it distracting in the least.  The menus are clear and easy to navigate.
The set I received is contained in a single regular-size DVD case.  Upon opening the case, I was pleased to discover that each DVD occupies its own space rather than being stacked on a single central spindle.
The item shipped almost immediately after I purchased it, and arrived two days before the earliest predicted date.
All in all, I have no complaints, and would gladly purchase from this seller again.",1484697600,,1060,4.471502590673575

I also have the three Rebuild of Evangelion movies and it's interesting to see the differences.  This show is a cult classic, and I'm a cultist.",1482883200,,270,4.153846153846154
