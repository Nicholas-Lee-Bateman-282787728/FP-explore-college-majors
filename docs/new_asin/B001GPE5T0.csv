In addition the video includes several trailers for Apostolof's films, many written or co-written by Eddie; these include Drop-Out Wife (1972), The Class Reunion (1972), The Snow Bunnies (1972), The Beach Bunnies (1976), as well as two different trailers for Fugitive Girls (1974)--in which Wood had dual roles (Pops and the sheriff)--one X-rated (soft) and one R.  Also included is outtake footage from Hot Ice (1977), on which Wood as Assistant Director (but his small role was cut due to his drunkenness), and the pre-credit sequence from The Cocktail Hostesses (1973) featuring Rene Bond and co-written by Wood.
