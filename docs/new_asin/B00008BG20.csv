8134668,5,B00008BG20,"I am fairly new to the children entertainment arena; however, I am quickly becoming established as a `Kid Video Guru'.  See, my sister has two kids, making me the proud uncle of two.  What I have learned from being an uncle is that that there is no better way to make two kids happier than by putting a video in the VCR.  Fortunately for me, and the whole world, Gina D's Kids Club exists.  My sister's kids love Gina D and can watch any one of the multiple videos for hours at end.  Thus, to help maintain my sister's sanity, I have bought every single Gina D video/DVD I could possibly find.  The company even sells the Cuddle Bug as a toy, which my sister's kids love as well.  So, five stars for the video, Gina D, and the company spreading some quiet time throughout households across America.",1098403200,,798,4.351351351351352
8134669,5,B00008BG20,My kids absolutly love the Gina D kids club. We had to watch it everyday for two weeks. But the wierd thing was I wasn't bother by it at all. The songs are catchy and deliver a great message. I would recomend this DVD to anyone who has 3-6 yr olds.,1079913600,,248,3.8823529411764706
