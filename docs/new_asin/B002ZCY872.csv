4014385,5,B002ZCY872,"CAPRICA is a SyFy Channel series including Season 1.0 with a two-part pilot and eight other episodes, and Season 1.5 with nine episodes. Contrary to some reviews and comments, CAPRICA has an ending. Yes, a gap exists between CAPRICA and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: BLOOD & CHROME and the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA series proper, and there is room for another series in that gap. But the cinematic sequences at the end of CAPRICA's final episode make it clear that the end of the final episode was meant to be the end of the series.

I say it is the best cinematic science fiction drama produced to date, including theatrical releases such as AVATAR. But who am I to say such a thing? Admittedly no one special. Just a humble fan of science fiction since I was a boy in the 1950s.

Why is CAPRICA the best? I hope I do not need to convince you that the sensual aspects of action sequences and special effects are less fulfilling than the intellectual intricacies of drama and science, because the latter two are what make CAPRICA the best. It has powerful characterizations, superb scripting, and diverse storylines that absorb your interest as they move toward conjunction. What's more, the series has a tasteful thematic background that blends computer-science virtual reality with the psychology of being (ontology). More than once in your viewing--assuming a modicum of discernment on your part--you will be faced with the question, ""What must be present for the self to exist?""

Rest assured that CAPRICA is not entirely cerebral; it does offer carnal excitement. The cinematography is not the best, though I expect it would be better in Blu-ray. Still, the standard DVD is agreeable. What is critical is that the environment is clean and bright, futuristic, and at times surprisingly convincing. Also, violent scenes are not done with timidity. (You might want to view the series before letting your rugrats view it.) Sexual scenes are more tame, however. No bare breasts or genitals, unless you watch the unrated, extended version of the Pilot.

Be advised! After guzzling a six-pack of beer, you may not be able to keep track of what's going on. You need to respect this production and pay attention (enabling subtitles may help). But if you are looking for science fiction that offers more than laser-beam pyrotechnics and exploding starships, tune into this heady drama.",1243036800,5,2368,4.9571788413098234
4014386,5,B002ZCY872,"Ronald D. Moore and Remi Aubuchon team up to create this prequel series set 58 years prior to the reimagined ""Battlestar Galactica."" The show focuses on two families- the Adamas and the Graystones, both of whom lose family members in a terrorist attack by a monotheistic group. Efforts to bring back deceased family members lead to examinations of religion, culture, the creation of the Cylons, and more. Though this show examines many of the same themes as ""Battlestar,"" the tonal differences work in focusing on a society immediately prior to its fall. There are some very minor continuity issues between this and ""Battlestar"" that likely would've been fixed if the series hadn't been cancelled, but there's a lot here for fans who want more of Moore's vision. The later prequel work, ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome,"" includes some slight references to this show. My only complaint is SyFy's habit of releasing half seasons. This 1.0 season only contains the first half of the show and fans must purchase 1.5 to get the rest.",1515456000,,1034,4.982658959537572
4014387,5,B002ZCY872,"Caprica is a complex prequel that attempts to set the stage for Battlestar Galactica. It is set 50+ years before BSG and we finally get to see the origin of the toaster style cylons and even learn how the name cylon came about.

During BSG I felt like Adama had some connection to the Cylons and here it is. I don't think this gives much of anything away. What is clear this is a deeper mix of stories than BSG. More story lines, virtual reality that appears like it should be ahead of BSG rather than decades behind.

For the BSG fan Caprica provides some essential background and origin stories. Alas, perhaps it was too complex and challenging and only really lasted one season and at the end of that I felt it was just getting its stride. I found the premise of Cylons becoming intelligent from a dream of resurrection of lost daughters compelling and kind of in harmony with BSG

Eric Stoltz plays the father (Daniel Greystone - inventor of Cylons!) of the central character - Zoe.  Esai Morales does a believable job as Joseph Adama (yes - Bill Adama's father).

I am a Glactica fan and I found Caprica fed my hunger for more of that universe. It's not action/explosions so much as real drama exploring religion, morality, virtual reality, technological dark sides, corporate intrigue terrorism and the list goes on. It's a lot to follow and I love it. I'm so sad it had to end too soon and giving season 1 5 stars.",1514419200,3,1421,4.492248062015504

Just how did the Cylons begin?

How good or bad is VR addiction to a society addicted to technology? Should an AI be considered a subservient slave, a savior of mankind, a kind benevolent friend and/or a destroyer of all beneath its level of intelligence?

What if the AI was one of us and the intelligence within was a transferred copy of our own mind with all its memories and personality traits?
Would we still be ourselves but somehow enhanced or just a corrupt pale shadow of something once living?

Would the AI Copy be a way to make us immortal?

What if the AI was not bound by one simple embodiment, but rather could exist and interact in our own so-called real world and also exist and interact in a vast matrix like VR (Virtual Reality)?

What if the VR world was actually a sort of heaven for all the people that had previously passed away?

This series is the actual thing. It is NOT ""SyFy""  (...whatever that frakking is)...  This nearly brilliant Battlestar prequel is a truly sad casualty of that decades-long genre-cide which has become the Star Wars/Marvel Movies mind-set. No big, booming space battles or skin-tight-costumed, flying super heroines here. Just a tight, gleaming little gem. A disturbing, dark history. What used to be called ""speculative fiction"". Scary, real, too close to home. Probably a bit depressing and slow for the over-clocked fanboys who super-grokked Battlestar Galactica. Just as good though. Maybe better.

4014441,5,B002ZCY872,"THIS IS A ONE SEASON WONDER.

I am old - and watched the old Battle Star Galatica back when the first Star Wars was first released.

When Sci-Fi rebooted it for the modern era - I was lost, confused, and couldn't make sense of what the Cylon and Human connection.

The rebooted Galactica had Human People that might be the Robotic Metal Moster Robots of the old 70's series.  I was lost, not interested and gave up as soon as it started.

CAPRICA - came out sometime later on sci-fi.  I missed it, but saw it on on Amazon Prime.

IT IS THE PREQUEL TO THE RE-BOOTED Battlestar Galactica.

It begins with humans living on am planet some where.  Slowly it begings to explain the way Virtual Avatars of the Furure and Human Beings all addicted to a virtual world (pokeyman may be earth's tiny first step in the sci-fi story of Caprica).

It combines the familiar names, terms (""by your command"") slowly as it becomes a fun facinating tale with ironic ""OH GODS!"" all the time - being it is a universe of many gods. (the 12 tribes/colonies the 1970's series just talked aboiut.

Keeps getting better, it was a sci-fi series cancelled after one season, so don't expect Oscar worthy drama.

Polly Walker has become one of my favorite Actresses.  From the Ingenue of her early career, she specialized in the EVIL B word like nobody else can.

I don't want to spoil it - but the final episode puts all the pieces together making both the old 1970's viewers and the modern viewers satisfied and back on the same page about the whole Galactica storyline.",1471132800,,1542,4.5

If you think humanity deserves to burn.... or if you've been thinking of slashing your wrists and want something to watch at the end, this is the show for you. Clearly the same people who wrote the pyric ending to BattleStar Galactica- the nihilistic retelling.

This prequel to Battlestar Galactica had a great story line and excellent script and character development along with fine acting.
Perhaps it didn't develop a bigger following because it was more cerebral and political and had less non-stop action than Battlestar.
Too bad really. I liked it better than Battlestar which, by the way, I thought was great.
Definitely worth adding to your video library.",1452643200,,491,5.0

4014493,5,B002ZCY872,"I love this TV show, as much for giving me a new way to look at today's world as for giving me first-rate entertainment while I watched it.

Like many other reviewers, we turned to Caprica after we finished Battlestar Galactica (another deeply beloved show).

You will be disappointed if you expect the scale of Galactica.  Caprica is fascinating but in a different way.  The acting, execution, and overall quality are not quite as grand or polished as Galactica.  The budget feels considerably lower.  But it is still great fun, and is a ""must watch"" for lovers of sci fi.

I keep thinking about Caprica on a regular basis, even years after finishing it.  For example, when I got cardboard my virtual reality glasses in my newspaper slot from the New York Times last Sunday, and my mind was absolutely blown by the sheer amazingness of the NYT VR app, I couldn't help but think of the way VR was problematic in the world created in this show.  And robots, well, of course I cast a wary eye towards them now (although Galactica was enough to do that.)

Bottom line:  This is an incredible concept that was executed reasonably well, and is definitely worth watching for any lover of sci fi.

I will add that if you find you love Caprica, you should also watch Continuum.  And visa versa.  Very different concept in many ways, but I feel like they are somewhat similar (in a good way) in terms of their engaging and thought-provoking execution.",1447372800,,1442,4.603921568627451

4014562,5,B002ZCY872,"Absolutely amazing show. It's a spin off from the (new, remade) Battlestar Galactica (BSG). The story and everything about it is excellent, just like BSG is. However it is also a very different kind of story. It occurs 58 years before BSG. It defintitly has a bit of a dark tone to it, but none of the desperation and despair characteristic to BSG. Compared to BSG, the world is a very positive place (it hasn't gone awry yet). That being said, bad things do happen, and characters are put through the wringer so to speak. It also doesn't have that gritty, down to earth camera style and cinematic style as does BSG. But it's still amazing. The CG work is great. I also love the way they portray Caprica. It's very much like our world, but an alternate version of it. Instead of football, they play Pyramid. Instead of a monothestic religion being the dominant religion, polythesim is the dominant religion and the ""absolute moralistic"" monothesitic god is a cult group that is big on terrorism. It's interesting to see this difference  from our own culture. Religion plays a pretty big role in the story and is a prime motivating factor for many of the characters. But don't let that scare you either. It really takes a good hard look at some serious, good questions (just like BSG did) although they are quite different. Like what does it mean to be alive? Is a virtual copy of you that can think, feel and has all the memories you do the same or not? What rights would such a being have?

Anyway it's amazing. If you like Sci fi, of if you liked BSG and want to know how the birth of the cylon race came to be, you don't want to miss this. The cylons did not start how you may have thought, and they were not originally evil at all. It's good. Watch, now.",1427328000,2,1758,4.406153846153846

4014583,4,B002ZCY872,"The remake of the `classic' Battlestar Galactica was a creditable effort and despite having lost its way towards the end of the series, it was mostly enjoyable but left a lot of unanswered questions. In `Caprica', the early history of the Cylons is explored and it is done in the best BSG tradition with enough recognisable names and technology to make it feel part of the BSG universe. The story is well crafted and thankfully there are no conversations with invisible skinny blondes or any flashbacks - a good thing. The narrative rocks along at an engrossing pace and, as every pilot should do, it leaves you wanting more.

Needless to say, we shall think seriously about getting season one when it is released, but one has to hope that the evident writing quality of the pilot is maintained and that BSG-style sloppy inconsistencies and religious mumbo-jumbo are avoided (please, no Dylan/Hendrix this time - that was just plain silly!). However, the news that season two has been axed is more than a little disconcerting as, after buying the two season one DVD's, we're very likely to be left with even more unanswered questions than we started with and a nasty feeling of having been cheated.",1420934400,,1198,4.815533980582524

4014603,5,B002ZCY872,"This is NOT Battlestar Galactica! Think of it as a drama which takes place on another world. It's social and political parallels to our own world make it smart and incisive entertainment.

If you are looking for space battles and action, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a television series that has something to say about terrorism, addiction to technology, organized crime, the emergence of artificial intelligence (the natural kind seems to have escaped the programmers who cancelled this series) and a hundred other things we humans here on earth have to deal with (and contains great dialogue and phenomenal performances by a troupe of very talented actors portraying unforgettable characters) you will like this series very much.

This show was too smart for the typical SyFy channel viewers who think ""Sharknado"" is the cat's meow and made dumb comments like ""If I wanted to watch a DRAMA I wouldn't be watching the SyFy channel! Where are the space battles!"".
I loved this series and was willing to accept that it wasn't an action series like Galactica. I'm perfectly fine with simply watching a truly great television drama.

Now for the review of the disc set itself:
The special features are nicely done, but WHAT WAS UNIVERSAL THINKING WHEN THEY PUT THIS SERIES OUT IN 4x3 WITH A MATTED IMAGE?!!!!
Although the packaging says that the series is in ANAMORPHIC widescreen, it isn't. It is in 1.33:1 with black bars matting the top and bottom of the 4x3 frame. That means that if you have a widescreen TV you will see the 1.77:1 image as a box surrounded on all sides by a black frame! You will either have to accept a small widescreen picture which doesn't fill your screen (even though it IS the correct SHAPE), or you will have to blow up the picture using a zoom mode to fill your screen and accept the lower resolution ""blown-up"" image quality.
The studios have been doing anamorphic DVDs for so long now, you just have to wonder what brainless idiot is responsible for this fiasco.
This is not the first Universal Studios screw up like this that I've encountered.

So, kudos for the series, boos and hisses for Universal screwing up another DVD release.",1412208000,6,2184,4.76984126984127

I loved the Battlestar Galactica OST's and liked the sound of what I head in the show, so tried buying the OST on double CD was not super impressed.

But once I got into the proper rhythm I developed an intense appreciation and in fact love for what the creators of Caprica were actually trying to pull off: the first Sci Fi family saga. Fancy words, but contrary to BSG with its military feeling this show follows two families on the brink of the advent of artificial intelligence in their society and the fact that the Cylons were created with the best intentions in mind. I can honestly say that the show, the fantastic actors, the innovative artistic concept and the emotionally gripping soundtrack managed to impress me immensely and I am truly sad that after one season this fantastic prequel got cancelled due to very low ratings.

From the art direction - this is a story of an advanced society that existed BEFORE the Mayans, Aztecs, Egyptians, Romans and Greeks had civilization on earth - is a mix of technologies from decades of human history so if you have any concept about this the way it's woven together is beautifully done.

The best SciFi in my view is the type that takes you out of your comfort zone to make observations about life in other worldly venues.  In this story those believing in ONE GOD are terrorists and those believing in many god are the status quo.  Families are of every conceivable type in the story...  The toughest mob enforcer is married to a man... the nun and teacher of children is in a multi-polygamous group marriage.  At the center is the same argument about values and good and evil that are a part of religious thought today --- and how gaming and computer technology can be so addictive  for so many.  Just not the way you imagine it to be here and now.  It gets you thinking about things in different ways for certain.  Important to watch from the beginning because the story builds upon what is in each episode.  You'll be lost if you try to jump in somewhere in the middle.

After the first few episodes, it really starts to drag. I seriously thought about quiting the series but I made myself finish, hoping it would improve. It didn't. The VR subplot dominates much of the series and while interesting at first, it really loses it's appeal after a while. For some reason, I expected a crisper story line about the rise of the Cylons and a lead in to the Cylon wars. Instead, this series plods along at an anemic pace. The story does eventually advance albeit with a whole lot of absurd and unbelievable plot twists. Eric Stoltz, Polly Walker, and Easi Morales are all victims of a mediocre sceenplay.

This series like the new battle star galactica is built around basically a religious war that is leading to the destruction of everything. It does really good with building the character and giving you things to hate and like about each character.

The negative is kind of a discontinuity between technologies displayed. For instance you have a  VR device that not much larger than a pair or normal sunglasses and the also a CRT monitor for a computer.  Another good example is smart paper that can receive  e-mails and then a old fashion brick type cell phone that doesn't even have a video quality screen.

I like that it explains with better detail why and how the Cylons came to be religious zealots about the One God, greater detail into Tauron, Gemenon, and Caprican cultures, etc. This show itself was short lived and do not expect it to be nearly as good as BSG; nevertheless, like I said in the title, good watch for BSG fans, might be weird or uninteresting for someone who isn't familiar with BSG.",1400544000,,631,4.258333333333334

A few episodes seem to have characters changing their alliances a bit readily.  For example near the end two characters have been best/only friends for most of a couple episodes,  one of them finds something better and there's not a touch of remorse, nor mention of the missing replaced friend.

4014808,4,B002ZCY872,"""Caprica"" the prequel to ""Battlestar Galatica"" has a signficantly different tone and is even more character driven than its parent series. Nevertheless, ""Caprcia"" is as good as ""Battlestar Galatica"" at its best although the first (and only) season did struggle in finding its identity with a dip in the middle of the season that quickly picked up by the end.

SPOILERS:
When Zoe (Alessandra Torresani) the daughter of computer wizard Daniel Graystone (Eric Stoltz) is killed in a terrorist attack by a monothetist religious cult, he and his wife (Paula Malcolmson) have difficulty in coping that is until Daniel discovers that Zoe created a computer avatar that IS Zoe. Daniel, determined to bring back his daughter, downloads the information to one ofhis prototype robotic soldiers (Cylons) and in hope of bringing her back.

Joseph Adams (Esai Morales) lost his wife and daughter in the same bombing and bonds with Daniel at one of the survivors meetings. He convinces Daniel to do the same thing for his daughter Tamara.

Neither one realizes that Zoe was a prototype being developed for the monothetist terrorist organization directed by Sister Clarice (Polly Walker) for some unknown purpose and, in the course of time, both Daniel and his wife come under suspicion from the GDD (a version of Homeland security). The GDD believes that Zoe was the bomber.

END OF SPOILERS:

An expensive show to produce, it seemed like the Syfy channel had no idea how to sell the show and gave up on it too soon (particularly when their producing partners chose not to reup for a second season) which is a pity as the second season promised quite a bit. Luckily, the first season closes off with a preview of the second season that gives us a sense of closure for the series and loose ends are tied up nicely for the issues during season one.

It's a pity that (as of this date) that Universal has chosen NOT to put the show on Blu-ray or license it to another company (Shout! Factory would do a nice job and the HD transfers already exist. All they would need to do is manufacture them and port over the extas since this has already been released in France) as the show was shot with HD in mind.

The Blu-ray transfer looks quite nice but only hints at what the show could like in a proper HD transfer.

The audio is marvelous with a nice 5.1 mix.

The special features include deleted scenes, podcasts for various episodes and commentary tracks. The pilot is offered in both the aired version and the extended, unrated version. They differ primarily in that the unrated version features nudity and just a tad more violence.

The CGI throughout is very good for the series (to the point that the CGI in the final episode on the 1.5 release is disappointing by comparison but it's not a suprrise given the amount of CGI that was necessary in that episode).

Stoltz, Morales, Malcolmson and Walker all give exceptional performances but, the real find here is Alessandra Torresani who does an exceptional job of pulling off a very difficult character and her transformation from a program that echoes Zoe to becoming Zoe by the end.

Although the tension sags a bit mid-season, ""Caprica"" had truly found its voice by the end so it's a pity that Syfy couldn't show the vision to carry the series for another year and allow fans to discover it.",1395532800,,3329,4.720689655172414

4014869,1,B002ZCY872,"The apple fell far from the tree.  And it was rotten.

I was a kid when the first Battlestar Galactica (BSG) series came in the 70s, and I loved it.  It isn't great by today's standards, but still has its merits.  When BSG was re-imagined in the 2000s I loved it even more.  Many magazines and critics called BSG the best show on TV, and it was easy to see why.  It wasn't perfect, and the way the series wrapped up wasn't as good as hoped.  But it was an awesome ride.  Not only was it the best sci fi candy you could want, but it was emotionally compelling.  I cried, cheered... it was unmatched.  It examined humanity and made you feel moved to be human, flaws and all.  Which is what good sci fi does.

I finally got around to trying out the ""Caprica"" prequel.  I was very disappointed.  No wonder it got cancelled after 1 season.  It could have been successful, but it had major shortcomings.

Even if the purpose of ""Caprica"" was to show us the initial cyclon creation and rebellion, they didn't have to start from almost nothing and move so slowly.  The BSG '03 series started with a major event that immediately put in the compelling conflict (new war with the Cylons) for the rest of the show.  Caprica started with ""meh"" and was very slow to get any better.  It had plenty of plot turns, but they were all over the place and too many didn't seem to go anywhere.  Plot threads which seemed potentially major were dropped almost as fast as they showed up, and left the audience wondering why they bothered.  It finally got a little interesting at the end of season 1, and the trailer for what would come in season 2 (which never got made) looked intriguing.  But they didn't get the show off the ground fast enough, and they paid the price.

The other major flaw:  The characters.  They were shallow and whiney.  It was hard to care about any of them.  Even the ones you wanted to care about and root for from the beginning quickly became pathetic and void of redeeming qualities.  I'm not saying that characters have to be bright and shiney heros in order to be interesting.  Part of what I liked about the '03 BSG reboot was that many of the characters had deep personal flaws, and yet were admirable and trying live to some kind of code of values.  You still cared what happened to humanity.  In Caprica, the flaws run so deeply that it destroys your reasons to care.

Maybe it was intended that we start off ""disappointed in humanity"" in order to impress us with developments later.  That could fit with the BSG universe previously established.  But if you make the audience so disappointed that you lose them, you're gonna fail.

Despite the fact that I'm a huge BSG devotee, a major sci-fi fan, and easily invest my time into a series, I came away regretting this waste of my time.  Don't bother with it.  Now I'm re-watching BSG (03) to get the bad ""Caprica"" taste out of my mouth.  And it's still impressive the second time around.",1393804800,3,2947,4.418994413407821

4014875,3,B002ZCY872,"The writing and plot are clever; however, there were two things missing on the series, action and skin. The brutality of ""Battlestar Galactica"" was compensated with the sex appeal of their leading actors. Caprica on the other hand, is brutal without anything to compensate for the ruthlessness (one dimensional bad characters). There was not a good archetype to relate to; everyone was dark, it was like watching a box full of snakes. Yet, I recommend as a must-see before watching Battlestar Galactica, it really puts the series in proper context. There was more smoking in Caprica than an unregulated Chinese factory, it was almost like the funding for Caprica was paid by Phillip Morris. The actors lighting up a cigarette every 5 minutes was really a put off.",1393200000,4,763,4.96875

Beyond that, if you're looking at this for good SciFi, it is that, though not in the 'space' sense.  More politics & computers than other SciFi elements.

There's definitely more of a focus on the daily life of humans in Caprica, in a more ""real-world"" setting (granted space travel is common place in their time), as opposed to the space battles vs. Cylons we've come accustomed to in the classic and reimagined BSG. We see problems and issues many of us can identify with here. Divorce, wayward teens, religious zealots, left and right wing wackos, extremism, PR & corporate scandles, gang violence, the concept and interpretation of family, moral and ethical depates, etc.

Eric Stoltz is great in Caprica, as is Esai Morales.  The cast as a whole was convincing for their parts.  A couple of female leads did come off whiney to me, but not enough to turn me off from the story or finishing the series.  I won't mention who, out of not wanting to taint anyone's predisposition should they not feel the same way upon watching Caprica for the first time.  For what it was, I liked it, and the series didn't drag on too long and wasn't cut too short.  Just ling enough to tell it's story and transition into the days of Blood & Chrome and the dawn of the first Cylon War.  I also didn't notice too many inconsistencies between the reimagined BSG series and Caprica, which is always good, but then again I may be blind...lol",1389139200,,1504,4.62781954887218

4014933,4,B002ZCY872,"**Spoilers Ahead: This review applies to both the 1.0 and 1.5 sets.**

I find myself a fan of many shows that spawned short-lived, failed spin-offs. Bablyon 5 had Crusade. The Star Trek franchise had the miserable Enterprise series. Stargate sadly came to a halt with Stargate Universe. And Battlestar Galactica had Caprica.

Caprica could have been great. Instead, it's one of the best shows that never truly was. The question then becomes, is it worth watching? As a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica, my answer is: I think so.

For the first time, rewatching a show did not change my opinion in any way from my original opinion of the show when it was airing. The only difference of note was how I recognized more actors from other shows I've caught up on, especially all the ones who had been on one of the Stargates and other Syfy shows. My feeling, then and now, is that this show had a ton of potential but failed to capitalize on it. Caprica should have run for a good four seasons, and, given the closing sequence, I have little doubt that the show would have found its stride in the second season, but instead we only got the one.

It's appropriate that the single season is broken into two halves, as the second half marks a definite shift in tone. The action picks up in season 1.5 after the relentless moroseness of season 1.0.

Caprica had one of the best pilot episodes I can recall. For some, this pilot movie could be the only ""required viewing"" for fans of BSG. The acting ranges from good to outstanding, and the special effects are mostly done very well and unobtrusively, especially the cylons.

There are weakness, though.

For me, V-World never quite worked, with ""New Cap City"" a bore. Taamra Adams never quite worked. Too much time was spent with the police investigation and the various terrorists (though Polly Walker is wonderful as Clarice and Magda Apanowicz was very good as Lacy Rand), which hurt the momentum building up for the really interesting characters, particularly Daniel and Zoe Greystone.

Joseph Adams/Adama was handled inconsistently between the two halves: at first, he seems a bit spineless, but later episodes revealed him to have killed in his youth and to have had an affair while his wife was still alive. Not knowing what to do with him, Sam quickly became the more compelling of the brothers to watch.

Amanda Greystone was another character that lacked focus and who, quite frankly, I found rather irritating. The plotline involving her history of insanity was poorly done. Such a central role in the series, I think her characterization was mishandled.

On the good side, Eric Stolz and Alessandra Torresani were tremendous. They command the screen whenever they're in a scene, and the scenes they share are positively electric. If Caprica had narrowed its focus to stay with them more (and on the killer robots!) we would have had a better series, one that may have found more of an audience. They should have been put together more and sooner, rather than dragging out the chase for the whole season.

The picture and audio on the set is top quality, but one thing I don't like is how every episode begins with a recap. I'd prefer if those recaps were optional. If watching a number of episodes in a row, as I'll tend to do with DVD sets, the recap is unnecessary and just gets in the way of the viewing experience.

Overall, I'm glad I added this series to my collection. I do think it supports rather than diminishes the legacy of Battlestar Galactica. I leave with a sense of what could have been and feel some disappointment, but I find it worth seeing.",1388880000,2,3613,4.681388012618297

As he walked away down the hallway, there is Lacy in a shallow alcove - and he walked right by her.  Like he couldn't have seen her.  This is PURE Disney BS, like the numerous similar scenes in High School Musical.  And of course, some obviously histrionic scenes that were to move the plot forward.  I think it calmed down on that stuff in later episodes.  But these things could dealbreakers for a lot of people.  I almost bailed myself after a few episodes.  But having watched all 19 episodes, WORTH IT.  Love, Love, Love.  I really wish they had continued the show.  and BTW#2, the show looks TOO Vancouver, BC.  A lot of SyFy shows seems to be suffering from this.  But I digress.  I recommend this completely.  Stick through the beginning tough parts.  You won't regret it.",1388275200,,1311,4.239837398373984

It did not quite capture the audience that Battle Star Galactica did, I'm assuming that others when they saw the previews for this series, felt much the same way I did, that this was a cheap attempt to continue the BSG saga.  But was I ever wrong.

The complexity of this series not only rivals, but in some way exceeds that of BSG.  The writers crafted an intriguingly deep and woven storyline, that if it had continue to develop and end...with the beginning of the BSG remake...I think would have been an outstanding saga.

The parallels to Earth is uncanny, and towards the end of the BSG saga, this parallel becomes amazingly clear.

After watching the seasons of Battlestar (only bypassing the one where Adama is a young pilot), I had assumed that Caprica would be a pale precursor of same. I had also not watched it when broadcast on SyFy (being quite disgusted with that channel by that time). I was so wrong.

Caprica's characters (which screw up some continuity for Battlestar, BTW) are engaging, the plots are interesting, and there is a sense of wanting to know what is going to happen next. It has issues of faith, the usages of violence, spiritual growth, and, more than Galactica, exploration of the issues of life, sentient life, ""the soul,"" and is there a plan for all. Adama's family having a ""mob"" connection explained some sides of Admiral Adama's character later seen in Battlestar.
And the linkage between Monotheism (albeit an a-historical one) and the Cylons are given a half-way intelligible linkage. And the creation of cylons is compelling since it is rooted in both greed, grief, and regret.

While I love film noir, something was lacking for me with Caprica.  It didn't answer any of the questions left unanswered by BSG, as I was hoping.

Pros: Sasha Roiz shines as always.  Love the idea of V-World (virtual reality) and the New Cap City game.  It was violent and sexy. Paula Malcomson and Polly Walker have some interesting Ho-Ya chemistry.  I also enjoyed Eric Stolz.  ""Frak.""

Cons: Esai Morales's Joseph Adama was such a wimp; he did get a bit better as the season progressed, but I wanted to strangle him most of the time. Ditto for ""Billy"" Adama.  All the smoking really took me out of it (I know Ron Moore has an obsession with smoking, but it seemed cheesy to me).  It didn't hold my attention as well as BSG.

Overall, not a terrible show, but nowhere near the level of Battlestar Galactica. The last episode sort of wraps things up and you can see how we get to the events of ""the Fall"" (the beginning of the BSG miniseries).",1374364800,,1077,4.388888888888889

4015528,5,B002ZCY872,"Unlike most prequels, Caprica not only provides a backstory but also enhances your appreciation of the original source material. There were a lot of things that bothered me about the Battlestar Galactica reboot, including the fact that the Cylons seemed so human and were monotheistic. It seemed like too far a leap for robots. Caprica provides a neat explanation for these.

First, we learn that the Cylon robots were imbued with a human personality. There's a fairly realistic (or ""realistic"") account of how a human personality could be transferred to a robot, basically treating the human soul as an aggregation of the data stored in the human brain. The personality transferred was also a devout monotheist which explains how that ""trait"" got passed down to subsequent generations of Cylons. And to boot, it's the personality of an emotionally troubled teenage girl - what a neat twist!

In addition to the Cylon origin story, Caprica also explores other moral issues. One theme throughout the series is the dangers of a virtual reality world, not unlike an amped up internet, in which people are allowed to act without inhibitions. For some, this part might seem out of place. The frequent images of teens clubbing and 1930s noir gangster scenes are a bit jarring. However, they're not just extraneous - they come to an interesting resolution near the end of the first season.

The characterization is a mixed bag. I love how Zoe Graystone, a teenage girl whose ""programming"" is installed into the first Cylon, struggles with so many issues, such as faith, reality, and love. The Adama family saga is also interesting. We'd heard a bit about Joseph Adama in the Battlestar Galactica series, but seeing him morally compromised provides a fascinating insight into the future Bill Adama's family.

The Graystone parents on the other hand are a mixed bag. Eric Stoltz brings a compelling mix of gravitas and weariness to Daniel Graystone. When he's depressed, you really see the weight of the world in his eyes. However, both he and his wife, Amanda Graystone, often find themselves making stupid decisions. In a few places, Amanda just goes off the deep-end in doing something incredibly stupid. It never completely destroys the show because while the decisions are stupid, they are human. However, I found myself losing respect for the characters as the show went on.

The show actually came to a pretty fitting conclusion at the end of season 1, despite having been cancelled. One other thing that bothered me though was that it seems the producers felt the show needed more action and intrigue. By season 1.5, some of the more interesting character development was dropped and the subplot with the terrorists became more prominent. By the final episode, the Graystones are running around Caprica trying to essentially stop a ticking bomb. There are plenty of other ""ticking bomb"" shows like 24 and I think Caprica lost a bit of something in trying to mimic them.

Overall, if you liked BSG, I think this show will help you make sense of the Cylons. Even if you weren't a BSG addict, Caprica is an interesting sci-fi show that had a lot of potential and certainly didn't deserve to be canceled.",1367107200,6,3199,4.936802973977695

4015574,5,B002ZCY872,"Syfy's series Caprica, a spin-off and prequel to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, is an impressive look at the beginnings of the Cylon War, starting with the creation of the first Cylon.  Taking place some sixty years before the events of BSG, this saga follows the lives of two families, the wealthy industrialist Greystones, and the middle-class attorney Adamas.

(Incidentally, I dislike spoilers, so please forgive me for excluding plot details.  Believe me, you'll appreciate it when you watch the show.)

One thing that I don't like is attempts to retcon, or give retroactive continuity, to an established show, that is, to change history in what came before.  Caprica is separated enough in time from BSG that any minor lapses in continuity could simply come from the presence of imperfect human memory, or from assumptions which are not correct.  The progression from the origins of the Cylons and the culture that gave rise to them, to the near destruction of humanity that drives BSG, is natural and organic.

Caprica has a very different feel from BSG, and rightly so.  The story is of two families torn apart by a terrorist act, and brought together in their grief.  The additional cultural texture in the Adama clan's Tauron roots feel neither gratuitous or forced, instead adding depth to the family.  The son's name is William Adama, the same as the future captain of Battlestar Galactica, which connects the shows.

Tackling questions of virtual reality, robotics, a golden age culture just hitting the tipping point towards decadence, and the nature of what makes human beings human, Caprica is a gripping drama, and gripping science fiction, with an emphasis on the science.  People act like people, not plot devices, much like in BSG.

If you liked BSG, you should give the pilot movie a viewing first, then this series.  Be aware that this release is *only* for the first half of the season, ten episodes, and you will have to purchase the second half, Caprica 1.5, to see the rest of the story.  Without giving away any of the plot, even though the series ended after one season, it answers many, even most, of the questions it poses, and that fans of BSG have been curious about.

Bottom line: You won't be disappointed.",1366502400,,2247,4.904761904761905

As a huge BSG fan, I'd say this was a much better than expected prequel.  You don't need to watch BSG first.  The acting, storyline and subplots, special effects, sets, and music are all very well done.  I thought the ending was very good but just a wee bit cheesy.

4015675,4,B002ZCY872,"Caprica is a spinoff-series of (new) Battlestar Galactica. Because it was a success, an American TV channel chose to make a prequel telling the story leading to Battlestar. Accordingly, Caprica takes place 58 years before Battlestar and has little direct relation to the characters of the previous series (the Adama family plays a role). The series is set in a confederation consisting of 12 planets that have evolved very differently. The main setting is the planet Caprica, which is technologically very advanced and quite wealthy. The main pastime of many people, especially teenagers, is a virtual reality world where sex, murder, crime etc. are possible without consequences. Some of the main characters of the series, especially Zoe Graystone and her friends, are repelled by this. Zoe as a rebellious teenager hates everything created by her father, a successful computer- and technology company boss and inventor, anyway. She therefore joins a fanatical cult that worships the 'one true God' and wants to force their faith on the rest of this polytheistic society with terrorist attacks. As a result, Zoe and hundreds of other people die in a bomb attack at the beginning of the series. But Zoe has left a perfect copy of herself in the virtual world. Her father tries to exploit this, firstly to get back his daughter, and secondly, to continue his - so far unsuccessful - development of an intelligent combat robot with the program Zoe wrote. Help comes from the father of another victim of the terrorist attack, which draws Dr. Graystone into the world of organized crime that's connected to immigrants of the poor and oppressed planet Tauron. And the religious fanatics also have an intense interest in the computer program and the fighting robots ...
The idea behind the series is very interesting, the effects are excellent, and the actors are very well chosen. Relatively well known names are Eric Stoltz, Polly Walker and James Marsters, but many of the less well-known actors also enrich the series immensely. Nevertheless, it was cancelled after just one season with 18 episodes. There were probably two reasons: Firstly, it was broadcast extremely fragmentedly, so that between the beginning and the ending of only 18 episodes years elapsed. That was plain stupid. In addition, the series starts out very slowly and initially the (for many viewers rather annoying) character of Zoe was a little too much in the center. Only in the second half did the series get really exciting and the different plot lines finally came together. So it is not surprising, but very sad, that the series was canceled. What remains are 18 episodes, and the last fortunately gives a little insight into what would have happened in later seasons. Along with Battlestar Galactica you have a pretty good idea of what would have happened next, which makes the ending after just one series a little less frustrating. Of course it is still annoying that the show was not completed. Towards the end it was in fact very interesting. So for the series itself I'll give just under 4 stars.

the Blu Ray-set from France:
For reasons unknown, in most countries the series has been released on DVD only, usually split into two box sets. Especially with the effects and gorgeous settings offered by this science fiction series, one would like to see a better quality than DVDs can provide. At the time of my review, the only Blu-Ray version has been released in France. It is definitely worth buying (e. g. here or the French amazon site, where it's often cheaper). The picture and sound quality are very good. The Blu Ray is playable without any problems - as far as I know it is region free. On my device (a European, non-French player) it worked just fine, and I know of American buyers who have had no difficulties either. The menu is in French, but it can still be navigated easily. A French language version and the English original version are available with or without French or English subtitles. For the very generous bonus materials (documentaries, deleted scenes, lots of music - to my knowledge the complete soundtrack) the English version is available, with French subtitles that are - annoyingly - automatically switched on, but can be switched off with the remote control. All in all, you get the English original of the series and the bonus materials in excellent quality.

At the end of the last episode they show a preview for what is to come, and basically had everyone excited because the story lines looked great.  Only, with a bonafide hit on their hands, Syfy does what they do and ax Season 2.

If you're a Battlestar Galactica fan, it's worth a watch to get a little back story.  The latest movie/mini-series ""Blood and Chrome"" does make some references from this series.",1361836800,,698,4.456692913385827
4015813,5,B002ZCY872,"There is a speculation, by some cosmologists, and futurists,
  that  we  humans had  our  origins...elsewhere.  And that's what
  BattleStar  Galactica  is  all  about: a  fleet  of  spaceships
  desperately  searching  for a rumored  paradise  called,  "" Earth"".

  But,  on  their  way  to this  paradise,  they must  battle an
  advanced cybernetic  species,  they  call  CYLONS.

  CYLONS are synthetic  humans. And they have  made  a  decision to
  make  war  -  a  second  time  -  on  humans.

  Stunningly  - and  ironicallly  - CYLONS  were  made  and  developed
  by humans.  They  attained  a  kind  of  wisdom -  through a  stolen
  piece of  technology....

  Domesticated,  they  were  man's  slaves  for  years...then,  they
  turned  on  their  masters.  The  war  lasted  for  years,  then...
  dormancy.  Humankind built a station in  space  to  accommodate  a
  treaty  party....But the CYLONS  never  came.  Until, one  fine day,
  the  CYLONS  showed  up.  With  death and  destruction  planned.

  They  unleashed  thermonuclear  horror  on  their  former  masters.

  Rewind....58 years.

  58  years  bfore  the fall, humans lived  in  peace and  harmony,
  on the  central  planet of  a  13  planet  colony.  On a  planet,
  CAPRICA.

  CAPRICA  has  it's  problems.  There's  high-technology,  crime,
  sex,  bad  language, lovemaking,  organized  crime,  and  Daniel
  Greystone,  his  wife  Amanda, and  their  daughter  Zoe.

  They're  not  precisely  middle-class.

  The  Greystones are  fabulously  wealthy, and  Daniel  Greystone
  runs  a big  corporation.  This fellow  is  working on a  project
  for the  planetary  government...a biped,  cybernetic  machine  that
  will  serve  as  ruthless  terminators  in  their  armies.

  But,  something isn't right.  Not only  does  Daniel  Greystone  have
  business  problems,  but  he's  got  a  beautiful  daughter  that is
  willful, sarcastic, is  disdainful  of  her  family,  and is rebelling
  against  the wishes  of  her  family.

  But, now, Zoe, has  found a  ""cult""...of  the  worshipers  of "" The  One
  True  God"".  She  and  a  group of  her  special friends  have  decided
  to run away,  and  make  a  new  home  on  another  world,  close  by.

  One  of  Zoe's  friends, is  a  fanatic,  and  detonates an  explosive
  belt,  aboard  a  MAGLEV  train.

  Zoe, and many  others,  are  vaporized  instantly.

  But, there's  ANOTHER  Zoe,  in  a  virtual dimension  created by
  Zoe Graystone.  Daniel  finds out  about  Zoe's  computer  brilliance,
  and  it's there,  that  the the story of  CAPRICA  really  begins.

  ""CAPRICA""  is  a  feast  for  the eyes. The production is  first rate,
  all the  way. The  CG  images are  breathtaking.  The  acting is top-notch,
  and  the  human interest  is  real.

  You  may  read  reviews  on  CAPRICA  by the dozen.  But,  most of  the
  reviews  I  have  read,  are  by  people  who  stumbled  on to  the
  series,  and didn't  try  to see,  really,  what  CAPRICA  was  all
  about.

  You're  going  to  real pathos,  here.  Real  conflict, greed,  love,
  the  opportunities  for  romance;  religious  zealots  who have evil
  intention.

  Government  officials  who  want  to  lie, cheat  and  steal....and
  murder.  You'll see  racial  hatred.  Bigotry. (  sound  familiar ? )

  And...Amanda.  You've  got to be  impressed  with  this  writing  and
  directing.  The  Pate  Brothers  are  the  principal  directors/pro-
  ducers,  and  they  do  a fine job.

  This  is  a  one season series that  will  build  it's  secrets  within
  you,  as  you  long  for  the  next  episode.

  See  the human side of  Extraterrestrial  Love, excitment, greed,
  conflict,  drama,  and  a  little  comic  relief.

  I'll bet  you'll run run  this series again,  and  again.

  It'll  be  a ""guilty""  pleasure.

  FIVE  STARS  OUT OF  FIVE.

4015814,5,B002ZCY872,Great Show and it was really picking up towards the end. Was cancelled prematurely shame on you SciFi....it would be nice if they did a nice 2 hour move or a mini series to really tie up the loose ends of the series. They better make BSG Blood and Chrome in to a series now.,1361750400,,274,4.0

4015818,4,B002ZCY872,I liked it. Watching it I was wondering why not alot of emphasis was into the forming or producing the robots. They barely touched on it. I thought that was strange. I was disappointed in this movie and also with 1.5. Im glad I bought them cuz I have the whole story of BSG. How it all got started and formed and where it went from there. I really liked the story of zoey and everything that she went through. That story in itself was alot better than this movie in it's entirety. LOL!!!  In fact the spinoff of zoey would probably get really great ratings in her alternate reality.....just saying!!!!  If you aren't serious about keeping the whole series I would go with renting at netflix.,1361491200,,691,4.433070866141732

Though Caprica lacked the grittiness and darkness of Battlestar Galactica, I enjoyed seeing more of the Colonies culture.  I would say that the series as a whole is okay but the second half (1.5) is much better because the story telling becomes faster in pace and it starts getting darker.",1361404800,,367,4.809523809523809
4015840,5,B002ZCY872,I enjoyed the scifi presented as normal living environment.  Some over the top ideas but basically a good intro to understanding how we got to Battlestar Galactica.,1361404800,,164,5.074074074074074
4015841,5,B002ZCY872,Loved the story line and the acting. This is a great story about how the situation with the cylones begun.

4015842,2,B002ZCY872,The first episode looked kind of interesting but then became like a soap opera with very little Sci-Fi and action.  I have it a try for 4 more episodes and got bored.  It is sad since Battlestar Gallactica was such a good show.,1361145600,,227,4.255813953488372

4015847,5,B002ZCY872,"Cancelled way too early - this is a terrific follow and prequel to Battlestar Gallactica.  Just be sure to give it time to develop, this isn't the kind of show you can just ""get"" after an episode or two - it requires you to have some patience.  Even though it only lasts a season, they end it in such a way that you don't feel shortchanged, or like they left you hanging.  It had hundreds of places left to explore, but they tie it up in a way that feels appropriate.  I watched it on Prime - and acquired a copy of it on DVD immediately afterwards.

4015883,5,B002ZCY872,"Having seen Battlestar Galactica all the way through before watching this series I can say it was pretty good.
All in all you really had to just keep watching the episodes and follow the story.
Caprica is, simply put, a back-story on Battlestar Galactiga. It's a great series, no doubt, but you have to keep the fact that it is a back-story in mind when watching this series as I've heard people not understanding what the main points are and such.
It's really all a matter of admiring the timeline and story.
I'm not really sure when this series came out but I have to admit it would be interesting to see a season 2 to connect things.
In case anyone's wondering if the historical timeline of this series with Battlestar Galactica is in sync, it looks pretty close to it.
Spoilers added here:
Whilst I'm surprised Clarice is still alive at the end of this episode, I found it a good connection of how Cylons began to believe in what they did.
Really, what makes a great series great sometimes to me, like this series, is when you can ask questions about it and just allow yourself to know it's part of the story and you just sit back and admire the fact that you can ask all these little questions about the historical timeline. This story is great because it's interesting, it keeps you involved. It's very well done and actually like real life in events unfolding like they do here.
All in all the series came off as realistic and very well done.
Zoe's finale was interesting, I must say, and a season 2 would probably clear up a few things concerning the end, but I must say it did go well. However, her part at the end sitting in front of Clarice was weird, as it really did leave me wondering what was going on.
For anyone who thinks having a ""skin-job"" in this time is out of sync with the timeline I think you're probably wrong. Unless someone made a season 2 and it became public knowledge that Zoe was a Cylon then no one besides those who knew Zoe was a Cylon would figure it out, probably. Thus, the future ""skin-jobs"" would possibly be made off the idea of Zoe.
All in all, it does make a lot of sense when I think about it.
To sum up, this series went very well. This was a very thought out and great series.
Whilst I wonder if the series will start up again anytime soon and a season 2 happen is unknown. However, I'm happy I got to watch this series.
Anyone who hasn't got to see this back-story it's good to learn a bit. However, I recommend watching it all the way through as I know you may pause and wonder if this is really great or not. Once you get close enough to the end you'll probably want to finish it and understand better.
I'll admit this series is a little confusing, however, it's really good and worth the time to go through.
Spoiler:

Also, even though Will Adama died, that isn't the Adama who fathers Lee Adama and the other son. If you watch the end of this last episode you'll see Bill Adama who we all know well from Battlestar Galactica.

Alright, well, I enjoyed the series, I hope those who watch do to.

Edit: Found out about season 2. It was apparently cancelled, so no season 2 of Caprica. If there is another series in connection, it may not be titled Caprica season 2.",1357862400,,3214,4.317880794701987
4015884,5,B002ZCY872,"For anyone and everyone who wants to know where Cylons came from, this is it. A lot of people were undoubtedly made uncomfortable by the polytheist/monotheist conflict. As a long-time student of archaeology and ancient history, I have no sympathy for them. The writers did an absolutely outstanding job of exploring the canonically-correct division existing in the Battlestar Galactica storyline and doing so in a way that supported rather than interfered with telling a very involving, often brilliantly-acted, and very moving plot.",1357776000,,533,5.512195121951219
4015885,5,B002ZCY872,"I highly recommend the show for any BSG fans.  I was really sad to see it go.  I really think that watching the entire show, including the summary at the end of the series really adds to BSG.  It's also a great show on its own.",1356739200,,227,3.891304347826087
4015886,3,B002ZCY872,"I'm not yet finished viewing Caprica, but so far so good. I can understand why it was cancelled after one season. It is a very good strory, just not the one I was prepared to see. I thought I was going to see all the set up or the origines of the conflict between human and the Cylons - and it a small strange way, it is -, but instead, the producers of the show decided to concentrate their efforts on a dead girl living in a virtual world. Once again, very good premise, fresh, original, but not the one I thought I was going to see. I can understand the producers not wanting to rehash the same themes for another 3-4 years, but then again at the end of the line, it is what it is. Battlestar Galactica. Eternal conflict between man and machines. And there's a little bit of that in there. Just not enough. Too bad!

Then, as the story moved forward I found this show to be offensive and appalling.

4015888,5,B002ZCY872,"For some insane reason, France is the only country with Caprica on Blu-Ray. It will probably never get a US release, and that really sucks. That said, this French release will do in a pinch. The quality is great, and it includes extended scenes, commentary, some interviews, and, interestingly, the entire soundtrack(though, be warned, the tracks have been edited to be background music for the actual show and it's not what Bear McCreary inteded - the real soundtrack is set to be released soon, AFAIK). The menus are in French, but they're fairly basic and not particularly difficult to navigate(though if they are, Google Translate is your friend). The French dub does play by default, but the original English audio tracks are included, as well as subs in both French and English.

There's one huge issue, however: while the Blu-Ray is not actually region protected, it's encoded at 1080/50i. Which the vast majority of US Blu-Ray players will not play. I got around it because I play it with my PC, but it doesn't work on my PS3. So be warned.

I just finished seeing the last episodes of Battle Star two months ago (was a so so fan of the series), and the Caprica (Cylons beginning) appears very logical.  The soldiers of the one (STO) religious aspects were a bit wooden and contrived.  The actors were given a difficult task, and the combination of the poor plot development and limited acting skills was quite apparent with most of the STO sub plot (the worst part of the series).  There were good plot twists and turns and some truly well done sub plot endings (the best part of the series is in the season 1.5).  Eric Stoltz ""nailed it"" as the inventor of the Cylons. He is a serious actor and I don't think anyone else could have done a better job.  Over all the 1.0 season and the 1.5 season were a solid 4 out of 5.",1350777600,,836,4.333333333333333

Unfortunately, it was on Syfy and they squandered a true jewel. An intelligent series that deals with big philosophical questions, religion, and the implications of machines with consciousness was simply out of Syfy's comfort zone. Too bad really. I was thoroughly enjoying the story of how cyborgs came into being, and I also really enjoyed the virtual world within this series (imagine a VR game were if you die your out of the game and can NEVER play again). I highly recommend the series. It is a complete series and story -- even if they did have to rush through the last few episodes in order to wrap up everything. Truly sad that Syfy squandered this series.",1349654400,,827,4.483443708609271
4015917,3,B002ZCY872,"Like its sister show, Caprica had a load of similar factors against it: ""That"" grotesquely badly-named channel it debuted on (which proceeded to prove its bad name by fearfully dumping this show which slowly showed some actual potential- tsk); being a ""spin-off"" (uh-oh); being a prequel (we ALL remember the track record of those kind of stories, don't we?) to a ""re-make,"" albeit a rare good ""re-make.""

Well! Guess what? It's actually pretty good. Now, here in this first of two DVD sets of yet another decent show cut off in its prime, we have the slow beginnings of the ""Caprica"" storyline. Over half a century before ""BsG"" redux, this earthbound (ie, Caprica-bound) story weaves together the tale of two families, two cultures, two classes (?). The rich and affluent Greystones of Caprica. The Tauronese Adam(a)s. After meeting only a few times in the first few episodes (in the aftermath of losing daughters in a terrorist train bombing), the repercussions of the respective fathers' first plans and plots resonate onward, forever altering their lives and eventually sealing the fate of ""humanity."" (ie, not our humanity, since this is, like ""Star Wars,"" long ago and far away) Sounds nice and epic, right?

But, this is smaller, domestic, more intimate, much more drama-centered and character-oriented. In other words, like ""Battlestar Galactica"" Redux, but without the military hardware and space battles to distract. It's a soap opera, to be sure, but with lots more substance than the vast majority of modern TV dramas.

However, it's a very very slow burn. It's to be expected of any TV show-- the first season tends to be about finding and establishing its footing, its voice, its identity, and even the best shows took anywhere from several episodes to an entire first season (or even two) to establish its unique identity and qualities. Therefore, most of the episodes here have that shaky quality -- randomly and nervously ripping off a variety of earlier SF efforts on similar topics, establishing characters and their arcs (some more successfully than others), and starting before suddenly dropping various subplots and characters.

I hate to do it, but if I had to pick on the one character that makes early ""Caprica"" such a pain to watch, it's Amanda Graystone. While she seems a decent enough wife to Daniel, she gets off to a bad start, being introduced as a total bitch to her daughter -- and you get the sense that it isn't really only just another bad day between them, either. After Zoe dies, Amanda is transformed into a total basket case: insecure, painfully gullible, hopelessly stupid (""Look at me wave around a pendant of the terrorist symbol I just now received in front of millions while confessing ""I think my daughter may have been a terrorist!""; yeah, that'll work). Yes, I know, it's the whole flawed character principle, but oh my god. And it doesn't help when we learn of her past psychiatric troubles and this weird and literally dead-end subplot about her dead brother that just disappears within a few episodes of starting, as if the writers themselves were embarrassed by it or didn't know what to do with it. She DOES get somewhat better and slightly redeemed, but only in the episodes of the next set.

She's not the only one on stupid pills: For a while, Joseph Adama goes through a rather silly ""vr gaming is bad for you"" after-school special subplot that goes on too long. Everyone else is flawed, too, but in much more complex and compelling ways.

And it all comes to a quite lovely and literally smashing mid-season finale that is satisfying and promises some great improvement to the show.

And there it is: politics, religion, technology, corporate ethics, mafia morality, grieving, terrorism, family, relationships, duty, reality, ethics, the media -- all of these and more are engagingly explored, despite any hiccups and the initially slow pace.

Although Universal has one of the lousiest track records in DVD history, I got the DVDs anyway, because: A) didn't feel the need to get it on Blu-Ray [at least not yet, nor for a first viewing], B) I don't do streaming-type stuff; and C) the prices tend to be low anyway [that is, now they are].
If streaming/download/hulu works for you, great. I don't know if the available Blu-Ray is U.S. Region. As for DVD-- always get new as opposed to used; Universal discs are already prone to strange and atrocious malfunctions as it is. (For the record, my set had one freeze in one episode, but I got around it by playing affected episode from several seconds after the freeze) There are a handful of okay behind-the-scenes extras.

It's a fairly complex two-family drama that manages to interweave questions about consciousness, religion, technology and morality in a fairly unique way. It benefits from having a generally strong cast and high production standards given the budget. The Caprica universe is also well thought out and believable.

There's a saggy middle section to the season which is probably the reason the ratings fell - if you can get through these 2-3 slower episodes, the last 4-5 shows deliver some clever plot twists and surprises. The final show crams in all the things the writers wished they could do if they'd been given another chance. Caprica had much potential once it had found its feet but TV networks seem to be killing science fictions shows rapidly at the moment.

OK, it is not as good as BSG, but it still has some very interesting and unusual ideas. I'm glad I saw it, and would recommend it to those who liked the reimagined BSG. Overall, the story is about the creation of the robots, and how and why they came to be enemies of the people of Caprica. It isn't essential to understanding BSG, but it does add to the story in a positive way.

I finished all four seasons of the newly, re-imagined BSG just a couple of weeks ago and wanted more, so I decided to check out ""Caprica"" and have to say I was very disappointed. Not so much at how the story doesn't really fit the backstory provided by BSG, as I understand the idea of creating a new story, but mostly because I couldn't stand the main characters so much. Zoey Graystone was whiney and annoying, I couldn't sympathize with her at all. I would have slapped her around too. And her parents were not any better. The only storyline I really loved was the Adama one. Their rich history should have been the center of the show, not the Graystone's storyline.

I was also very annoyed with the use of religion. I liked how it was done on BSG better. It was very present, but not annoying. I understand the use of it was to perhaps set-up the reason why the Cylons worship one god and how that is important in the BSG universe, but I really don't think they went about it the right way on ""Caprica."" That added to my inability to sympathize with anyone but the Adamas who mostly stayed out of religion and stuck to family and their own national issues.

In the end, I am hoping that this sort of prequel can be given another chance. I think there could be something amazing to work with, but the main character, the Zoey sort of character, needs to be a likeable character. Even if she's an evil character you love to hate.

One says that it's beyond what she can imagine.  She's an accountant and this kind of story doesn't fly in her world.

I, on the other hand, am an aspiring writer, love films, travel, new short films, anything a bit odd or a story that make me think.  I have a fascination with the idea of time travel which may be why science fiction is so interesting to me.

Apotheosis, currently acting as the series finale, was not meant to be the end of the series but it should be applauded the care to wrap up the events on this story as neatly as possible and keep fans salivating for more in case Caprica was not renewed for a second season. This episode was just the Beginning of the line and definitely made this show's 18 episode run worthwhile. To anyone thinking about giving this show a try, do not be afraid for you will not be given a complete cliffhanger. There is clearly meant to be more, but enough closure is given to make the show feel complete enough to warrant the money to download. Caprca may have been fairly slow in the beginning, but it was meant to buld the world and the characters within it so that we could be taken on the wild ride the last 4 episodes trust us upon and this finale was beautiful in the way it used the technology Caprica's world introduced to its viewers and showed how it changed the world forever.

It grew on me. I knew from the start that I didn't want to love it. I refrained from investing in it emotionally as I felt from the start that this was a doomed project- far too thoughtful for broadcast T.V.!

But as I watched it, this fantastic show overcame my reluctance and so each week as I watched I became more and more interested despite that reluctance. It's characters were to deep and too gloriously flawed to ignore. Each week I would find myself more and more drawn in. Hoping for more glimpses into this fully realized universe whether it was a better look at Sam Adama or Clarice's group family or just the pain of the unexpected loss of a loved one and the insightful performances of so many of the cast in this regard.

 Not to mention the outstanding performances by a couple of my favorite actors in this particularly good episode of a show that fascinated me each week it was shown - Meg Tilly and James Marsters. Each of whom were captivating for every moment they were on the screen.

Altogether this was an amazing episode of what was a thoughtful, challenging, and enchantingly convoluted series. I will miss it though am still planing on enjoying every minute that is still left to be broadcast. Frankly SyFy network is so rarely what it claims be that I'm glad it changed it's name! They should be ashamed that they canceled this show while supporting ghost watching etc. Truly terrible programing!

Some of us had assumed the episode list after the Description for Season 1.0 was for that set, but it is not.  Season 1.0 goes through End of Line, Episode 9 (it's listed there as 10 because of the 2 part opening series episode gets counted as 1 and 2.)

I can't really add more to the many positive reviews of this series.  I'm sorry that today, 11/30/2010, was shown the last episode for the series on the Space channel in Canada.  What we saw in the USA on the SyFy Channel, (Caprica Season 1.0), is the first 13 episodes; 14 if you include 2 for the two-part opening episode. Only 5 more were shown on the Space channel in Canada. That means Caprica Season 1.5 is only 5 episodes.  I'm hoping they will release a Season 1 set with all 18 episodes.

4016253,4,B002ZCY872,"Well, SyFy, with its chronic case of Attention Deficit Disorder has cancelled Caprica, when it could have spent time building on this series.

I can say that the DVD set was delivered quickly and in good condition, but the question here is whether the content matters and is good.

I've yet to see the second half of the season, and I hear that it starts to establish itself quite well, but that's all hypothetical now...

Caprica was based on a premise that would have taken time to elucidate and flesh out.  Unlike Battlestar Galactica, where the many parts (if not all, if one thinks of the role of the-thing-that-hates-being-called-God) framework and background was obvious, Caprica depended more on the roles of the Graystone and Adama families and these are abstractions; complex abstractions at that.  We could see in BSG that the cylons were the enemy and Bill Adama was a hero and Laura Roslin a leader and Baltar a fool or a villain and Six a temptress and then, as events and consequences unfolded, we could see those roles and positions elaborated and deconstructed, but in the case of Caprica, we cannot see so soon what sides there are and what roles various characters might play.  Caprica needed time, and it didn't have enough time and as a result this set, and the first series is a relic of what might have been.  There is a proposed new series, Blood and Chrome, which may fill in the huge gaps that are now left, who who knows whether that will succeed, or whether it will fully explore the ideas implicit in Caprica?  As it is, then, Caprica remains as a relic, a hint of what might have been.

What worth then is Caprica?  Well, it is worth seeing, because it is promising.  The performances of the actors, the scenarios sketched, if not yet filled in and detailed are fascinating representations in drama of ideas that have been explored in literary science fiction for quite some time now, but not yet with the nimble crossing of medium and genre that we see in the television serial format.  It does surprise if one is patient, or confuse if one is not.  Is it cyberpunk or is it noir?  Well, both, and the mixture is interesting... but again, we'll never know what the implications of that mixture might be.  Is Daniel a fundamentally good, albeit flawed human, or just a cold, obsessive narcissist?  What made Joseph the good man, the civil rights lawyer remembered by Bill Adama and Romo Lampkin in Battlestar Galactica?  We'll never know.

My review, you see, is about Caprica in relation to Battlestar Galactica - it never had enough time to step outside of Galactica's shadow and establish itself.  It could well have, I think.  The characters were not immediately likeable, but they were (potentially complex) and the style of storytelling was unique and in many ways more accessible to people who don't relate to space opera.

So what do I think then?  What would I say in a few lines?  Caprica was promising - I don't think that it was able to establish itself and as a curtailed series, it can only be a relic, but it remains interesting, and what was released was well-made, well-acted, and was working towards building up a rich, complex world.

I'll say watch it, but find out what you can about Battlestar Galactica while keeping in mind that it is not Battlestar Galactica (for good or ill) and that it could have been so much more.",1290988800,2,3373,4.649241146711636

4016255,4,B002ZCY872,"OK, yes, it was a bit cerebral and philosophical.  But the depth of the cultures was being fleshed out.  The Taurans and Capricans etc.  Not to mention the origins of the Monotheism that was so strangely unexplained in BSG.  I wanted to know!  They have 5 episodes that they are not going to air any time soon.  Well, they should at least put them up for sale, I bought the season---I should get it.

Part of the problem was the constant breaks in between episodes.  I mean seriously, this was not BSG and it wasn't as technically demanding of a production.  Why did they break it up and doom any chance of an audience following?  I am so disappointed.

Like Defying Gravity, the powers that be took away yet another thinking fans show.  I am sick to death of giant shark of the month movies and blood and gore and screaming characters whose only purpose is to flash cleavage.

sigh, I'll miss you Caprica.  I have to admit it makes me reluctant to watch the new BSG spin off that is in the works that centers around the Cylon Wars, Blood and Chrome.  I tolerated the breaks in BSG because it was that good.  But I still just tolerated them.  If this new spin off is not as good as BSG I won't keep watching if there are 6-12 month breaks in the same season.  Too much risk that the show will be cancelled because fans just won't keep up.  I hate getting into a show only to see it disappear.  Firefly was astonishing tv and poof, thanks to blunders involving the episodes releases and the lack of attention by it's network it died a sudden and untimely death.

No wonder sci fi fans are so reluctant these days.  Writers and producers and the money behind it all? You guys need to take more time getting it right before airing it so we are not left with half stories and stupid reruns of Creature of the Week.

Personally, I would love to see the Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars series made into a decent series.  John Carter!

4016259,1,B002ZCY872,"I was really into Battlestar Galactica and so I watch Caprica because I want to see more of that world.  Sadly, despite having so many great things going for it, this show cannot pull itself together.  I have to blame the writers because I love the actors, love the sets, and love the music, but after 12 episodes I still couldn't tell you what this show is about.

I think the writers were trying to be post-modern or something by creating a show without a central plot line or idea. However, I think shows, even the absolute best shows, should have central concepts that you can sum up in one sentence.  You simply can't do that with Caprica and so the show stumbles from one episode to the next as you wonder what characters you should be investing in.  I have no problem rooting for an anti-hero or a bad guy, but if I don't understand a character's motivation then I have no idea what I'm rooting for.  I just don't understand what any of the characters want so instead I watch them fight, watch them grieve, watch them plot and scheme without caring or connecting.

I would like this show to find it's voice but I will be shocked if it can do that in time to get picked up for a second season.  This first half of Caprica's first Season has it's moments, but it's a confused show. I would rather watch a BSG sequel where Chief Tyrol and Lee Adama scrounge around for berries on Earth II then re-watch any episode on this DVD set.",1287014400,21,1435,4.3283582089552235

4016261,3,B002ZCY872,"How did BSG devolve from one of the greatest sci-fi shows ever, to this mostly average show? When I first learned about Caprica I was hoping it would redeem the BSG finale -- but instead, it made many of the same mistakes. Early BSG was a believable story set in a very different world. We believed at some point we'd learn the nature of the entity the Cylons called God, how it seemed able to predict future events, and have a plan for some if not all the characters; the scientific explanation for head-Six and head-Baltar; how Starbuck came back from the dead. We wanted explanations for these things consistent with the show's realistic tone.

We got none of it. Much like the ""Lost"" series finale, we were asked to ""have faith"" and be happy with a soulful lack of explanation. God apparently really was God. Starbuck, head-Baltar and head-Six were angels, or something.

And here I had thought of BSG as a gritty, realistic, hard sci-fi story. Now we're going to bust out of that tone and throw in angels?

I've always been a huge fan of Ron Moore's, and can't reconcile that ending with anything he's been responsible for before ... but apparently, he stands behind it. Fair enough. But if we see things so differently, how can I watch Caprica, or anything else he does going forward, with expectations of a satisfying payoff?

Caprica's occasionally beautiful to look at, especially if you have a big HD screen. Very good acting by adept actors: Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales, Polly Walker, Paula Malcomson. Stoltz is consistently excellent; I found myself rooting for Caprica if only to keep this vehicle for his talent around. The teen acting has potential, but needs work. It's not easy to play a convincing teen super-genius, but that's one of the challenges the show decided to undertake, and I'm not fully convinced.

Caprica's writing, while generally good, is plagued with inconsistencies, and has done little to recreate confidence in the BSG world. When I learned the writing was to be overseen by Jane Espenson -- best known for work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- I didn't have high hopes. To me her writing means deus ex machina stuff without prior buildup, characters behaving inconsistently just to create a dramatic moment, etc. She is certainly creative and wrote some of the best Buffy episodes, but also some of the worst BSG episodes. Leaps in logic may be fine for Buffy -- not for BSG or Caprica.

One example of this -- in ""Rebirth"", which to be fair was written by usually excellent Mark Verheiden, overseen by Espenson -- is Amanda blurting, ""My daughter was a terrorist!"" to a crowd of victims' families. Overly dramatic, utterly foolish from a business and personal safety perspective, and not at all what we'd expect from a woman we are to believe is Daniel's intellectual equal. Grief could have moved her to confession, sure -- but in such a ham-handed, public, and dramatic way? I almost stopped watching. How much of this awful moment was Verheiden or Espenson is unclear, but I've never seen Verheiden disappoint on this level before. I'm not going to blame her for an episode she didn't write ... but even if this was purely Verheiden's doing, as captain of the writer's room she should have made him go back and try again -- chisel away at that scene until it made sense. As aired it made none.

There have been thankfully few instances of the story slipping completely off the rails like this, but just enough inconsistency to keep one annoyed throughout most episodes.

On the subject of inconsistency: not sure how this world even makes sense in light of the BSG finale. This all takes place 150,050 years ago but folks worship ancient Greek gods, which didn't exist before Ancient Greece? Has anyone ever found cave paintings resembling Athena or Apollo from 150,000 years ago? Making some distant galactic cousins our ancestors was a neat idea for a sci-fi story, but it just doesn't fit. Possibly it could have been *made* to fit with some fleshing out -- for example, introducing us to some entities both the Ancient Greeks and BSG-era worshippers knew as ""gods"" -- but the finale did not accomplish that, and neither has Caprica. How long will these holes you could drive a truck through continue to exist? The BSG finale was an opportunity to fill them, to answer questions we've had since the first season of BSG. Caprica was another, also squandered.

Since writing this, Caprica's been canceled. It's a shame; it was an opportunity to tell a great story. Maybe the next BSG series (Blood & Chrome) will take some responsibility for the franchise, stop insulting our intelligence and bring thinking fans back into the fold.

According to BSG Lore the Cylons were BOTH human form and Machines (Centurions). the Human looking cylons came 1st. the Centurion models were created by humans, but where the hell in Caprica does the Human formed Cylons appear or influence the 1st Cylon war. Now in BSG Brother Cabal or whatever his name is thounsands of years old along with all of the ""Final Five."" when the 13th Colony(Earth) Fell in their war, Cabal sent the Final Five to the 12 Colonies with no memories of their past. So while i was watching Caprica i was expecting to see some sort of influence from Brother Cabal instigating/influencing the original Cylon war. Or maybe they haven't gotten that far yet. My point is in BSG the human Cylon (Cabal) is overall Villian in the story and the reason the Cylons Hate the humans so much. I just don't see how Zoe's Story, while interesting, makes any sense to the overall story. I hope in the next season they seriously address this story line if they really intend ""Caprica"" to be BSGs sister show...they MUST not let this show ruin BSGs great legacy due to lack of poorly written story lines.",1286496000,2,1180,4.544600938967136

We start out by seeing two men from two very different walks of life; one is a man that created an interface that takes internet living to another level and the other is a guy that does ""favors"" for people and makes the deaf hear. While their lives seem totally different, the two will find a connection in the most horrific of ways, leading them on the road to create A-I that ultimately causes a war.

The things that happen in the pilot episodes are really amazing. They take the idea of what a technological planet is and then show you its dark underbelly, basically helping you to understand the minds of three young kids. Then you see the parents of these kids and you wonder about the motives of everyone and what will spark this Cyclon revolution.
and then you get your answer.

I know a lot of people loved B-G but, in the end of its run, I questioned the why behind it all. I really felt myself slipping away and did not want a taste of that again. The way B-G started out felt good but, really, the ending left much to the desires of many of us. Hopefully, Caprica is not the same. The acting is great, plot is twining, and the lines are fresh. There are even oddities in sexuality - things not expected, not oddities in the ""bad"" sense - and I loved that.

It is not clear whether these are the uncut DVD versions in HD, or just the shorter versions of the Pilot that were broadcast.  And, their ordering procedures deviate from the rest of their website.  On the first click to order, which would normally put an item in your shopping cart, they complete the order without giving you the option to decline.  Then, they provide no discoverable means of disputing the purchase.  These digital purchases do not show up in your list of purchases; they do not show up in the list of purchases on which you can report a problem.  Basically, the site is misleading and provides no means of correcting mistakes.  Very disappointing for Amazon, which usually has good customer support.

4016337,4,B002ZCY872,"From Star Wars to Star Trek to Terminator to now Battlestar Galactica - prequels seem to be one of the favorite tools of scifi writers of late.  Of course, with the way they ended BSG, they would have had to make any sequels unlike any science fiction we've seen before with the men and women of the fleet mixing with ancient humanity - so perhaps a prequel was in order in this case.

I think they're doing a pretty good job writing this series and the only question is whether the audience will stick with a show whose battles are much more personal than a viper versus a raider.

BSG/Caprica is, of course, a critique on our society in the here and now.  If the audience sticks with it, I think the writers have a good message to share in an exciting way.  But, it easily could go the way of Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles because many fans don't want to think too much.

So, we shall see.  But as long as it is around, I will be watching.",1268265600,,947,4.256983240223463

4016372,4,B002ZCY872,"Regretfully, the 45 minutes per week series episode does not allow full satisfaction for the plot to develop as much as, at least, I want. I suppose every TV series that has a continuing theme from week to week has the same or similar problem. Certainly, contemporary ""V,"" getting ready to resume its season this March is no less frustrating to watch as limited by 45 minutes per week.

That be as it may, this episode of Caprica further ups the ante in the future stakes for the Graystone Company, the Graystone's, the Adama's, and the STO (Soldier of the One). The Graystone Company, having decided to focus on the development of the Cylon, the only operating version being the one which has the avatar or consciousness of Zoe Graystone within the MCP (Meta Cognitive Processor), finds that the theft of the MCP  involved the incidental murder of two Toran employees who were related by blood to the Toran owner (Dr. Vergis of the Vergis Corporation located on Toran) resulting in a ""blood"" debt that relatives must satisfy before the dead may move on to everlasting life. Dr. Vergis visits Caprica to let Daniel Graystone know that he will not rest until this ""blood"" debt is satisfies . . . by the utter ruin of all that Daniel Graystone holds dear. Seems like the prelude to a bloody conflict.

Zoe on the other hand, is engaged in playful flirtation with Philomon, who is making adjustments to the Cylon body she inhabits and it is becoming clear that a romantic interest is thriving between Zoe the Cylon and Philomon, which Zoe seems to see no harm pursuing even thought her body consists of mostly alloy metal.

Joseph Adama continues to be haunted by the knowledge that his daughter, Tamara, or the virtual equivalent of his daughter is trapped in a virtual world and he cannot, at least at the moment, do anything to help her.

Finally, and probably most troubling, is the revelation that the STO, with all its idealism, seems to be the pawn in vast political machinations by a shadowy figure in a confession both who represents a yet even more vague power behind the scenes.

Remarkably, Sister Clarice manages to capture the content of Daniel Graystone's computer system including all the information regarding the Cylon including Zoe's Meta Cognitive Processor avatar and all the genius that Zoe possesses. The intention seems to be that the STO use Zoe's remarkable genius to further the ends of the STO. That the STO's idealism is being perverted for the ends of power politics is extremely troubling. Zoe's avatar, and therefore, Zoe's genius can be loaded into the MCP which still exists on Toran, and then used in a copy of a Cylon robot.

So even though Daniel Graystone has been the direct agent of stealing the MCP to create the first Cylon on Caprica, he is not even aware that Zoe has been pirated and will undoubtedly be placed in untold thousands of MCP which might be used to provide the software to run untold thousands of Toran Cylons.

Thus, the genii is out of the bottle and cannot be put back again. There will be hundreds of thousands of Cylon's running around spawned from the single Zoe, pirated, hacked and modified for good and evil and multiplied almost endlessly, certainly a prescription for a bloody outcome for someone at an unknown time in the future.",1267920000,,3295,4.718260869565217
4016373,4,B002ZCY872,"In setting the stage for the explosion, no pun intended, to come, Graystone Corporation, the owner of the Holoband, make the Holoband available for free in order to marshal all their resources to develop the Cylon of which only one has been successfully made, and which contains, or traps really, the avatar of Zoe Graystone, unknown by Daniel Graystone.

The complexity of the Holoband is further explored as Tamara Adama, daughter of Joseph Adama, Tamara killed in a terrorist attack by a member of the STO, finds herself trapped in a virtual re-creation of Caprica City in which she reigns supreme as a being by virtue of being dead in reality so that she cannot de-materialize when killed. In other words, for Tamara Adama there is no ""Game Over.""

Therefore, Tamara can completely dominate all that goes on in the Holoband . . . EVERYTHING. She is supreme. She is the ruling Queen . . . absolute dictator of all things in the Holoband: and she has attitude.

As she walked down the darkened street in the dark virtual city she rules at the end of this episode, she stepped gracefully on her long slender legs, high heals tapping on the wet concrete of the dark city street, and a compact assault gun gripped confidently in her right hand . . . an assault gun she has already shown she is able and willing to use with expert skill.

This scene ending this episode subtly hinted at the dominating role she would play in developments later in this series.

How will she intersect with Zoe Graystone who is trapped in the only Cylon  produced by the Graystone Company? What will happen on Caprica when Graystone Company completes their contract with the government of Caprica for the production of 100,000 Cylon's as a military force?

As slowly as this series seems to move, violent pressure is building at a steady rate, and circumstances are forming which in a seeming intersection of synchronicity
  will come together, certainly by the end of the season in a figurative and literal explosion that Caprica, Daniel Graystone, Willie Adama, or Joseph Adama could or do not have the slightest hint.

In Zoe Graystone and Tamara Adama, two young women who grew up with the Holoband, there are two young girls really who seem somehow, perhaps unconsciously, to know that something revolutionary and catastrophically violent is soon to happen. Certainly not in the next episode, nor the one after, but certainly by the end of the season Caprica, and then the other 11 colonies will be rocked by what is the beginning of ""the Fall"" 58 years I think it is, in the future.

Zoe Graystone, characterized by Daniel Graystone as being a Cylon who scores on intelligence tests as genius, is the prototype of the Cylon race and quite possibly to become the Cylon leader among the 100,000, while Tamara Adama rules the virtual Caprica City. The possibilities make my head spin.

I would like to point out that this IS NOT a Battlestar Galactica clone and so some BSG fans may not like the way this TV series progresses. One reviewer gave it one star, and while I respect the opinion of this reviewer, I do not agree that it is ""garbage.""

I am pleased that this TV series is making an effort to develop its own character as a TV series and it is successful at doing that.

I am looking forward with much anticipation to see in what way this TV series develops . . . how Zoe escapes from her robotic body if she does, what she will program because that is inevitable as she is a ""genius"" as a programmer, and how Zoe's father uses the ""Meta Cognitive Processor"" to produce the 100,000 Cylon warriors that his company has contracted to provide.",1264809600,,1149,4.40566037735849
