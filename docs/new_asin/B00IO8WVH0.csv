6283784,4,B00IO8WVH0,"Awesome purchase. Love Will Ferrell. Only down side is that they doubled up the movies to one slot hold, meaning 2 slot holders for 4 discs. Which isn't a hug incovinence but just wish they'd add the extra holders",1421193600,3,213,4.487179487179487

6283786,4,B00IO8WVH0,"I'm one of those people that wish Will Ferrell had stayed on SNL, but these are a lot of fun.  The best movies out there?  Hardly, but is that what you're looking for here?",1414886400,,172,4.029411764705882
6283787,1,B00IO8WVH0,"Despite for years receiving a pretty steady stream of deliveries from Amazon with no delivery issues, for some reason this item has been flagged as having been returned as undeliverable. And the price has now gone up by nearly 40%. Unhappy coincidence?

I love a couple of these movies, so I'll just keep this in my wish list until the price goes down again. I've got a long history of being pretty happy with Amazon, but this experience is pretty strongly negative.",1403049600,,466,4.682926829268292
6283788,5,B00IO8WVH0,"I'm giving this 5 stars for the sheer value of the deal. The 4 films are the original, single disc release versions so you're getting 4 individual blu-ray discs (albeit, stacked 2 on each side of a single blu-ray snap case). The product description is sort of thin on details so I took a chance and ordered hoping The Campaign would be the extended cut version blu-ray and was happily rewarded when my hopes were realized upon delivery.  I think The Campaign is an underrated Ferrell gem and love it more with each viewing....it easily competes with Anchorman and Talladega Nights as my favorite Ferrell films.  Old school is also one his better efforts.  Blades of Glory and Semi-Pro round out the set and are somewhat lesser Ferrell efforts (with Semi-Pro being my least favorite of the bunch) but still funny for dedicated Ferrell fans.",1401321600,2,839,4.772413793103448

8643932,5,B00IO8WVH0,"If you have all or any of these on dvd and would prefer to have them on blu-ray. This is a great deal. Instead of purchasing each separately for more money, you get all four for a reasonable price.",1477785600,,197,4.076923076923077
