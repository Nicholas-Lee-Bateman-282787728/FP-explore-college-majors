5763865,3,B00CZO04WI,"Magic Magic is often advertised as a horror movie, however, I would say it's more of a psychological thriller with a very dark and intense undertone. Juno Temple is giving a master performance, her acting is on point and very disturbing. Michael Cera plays this psycho, who shows not only anti-social but also sadistic tendencies, and everyone was wondering if he would be able to portray a character like Brink. I think he did great, but at the same time, he annoyed the living hell out of me. The camerawork is stunning, and the landscape shots are beautiful.
The movie starts very strong and interesting, but leaves you clueless not only until the end, but even past that. There is absolutely no conclusion, the audience is completely left in the dark, and even though the tension and suspense rises it turns out to be a thick cloud of confusion. It seems like someone came up with a good idea but ran out of time to write a satisfying ending. So let's just end it somehow, because at the end of the day indie movies are supposed to keep you guessing and that's what makes them artistic. Not true.
Furthermore, character development is hardly existing, and even if Juno Temple convinced with her performance, I couldn't relate to her character because I didn't know enough about her.
Magic Magic is not a bad movie but towards the end there are just too many questions unanswered, which might be very unsatisfying.

5763866,3,B00CZO04WI,"Although it's not a bad movie in and of itself, it's NOT the type of thriller you're led to believe by the trailer. Also, you can see where it's headed about half way through, which is disappointing. That said, the atmosphere is sufficiently dark and uncomfortable, and there are a couple of creepy moments. Save your money and wait 'til you can watch it for free on cable.",1376265600,,373,4.5
5763867,2,B00CZO04WI,"Alicia (Juno Temple) visits her cousin Sarah (Emily Browning) in Chile. Sarah is suddenly called back to Santiago to take exams (weak plot point) while Alicia remains isolated with Sarah's inhospitable friends. Brink (Michael Cera) is a tag-a-long who keeps hitting on Alicia who does not like him. In fact I didn't like him. He was immature, prissy, dorky, and creepy all rolled up into one. Barbara (Catalina Sandino Moreno), the host, was cold while Agustin (Agustn Silva) an amateur hypnotist and Sarah's BF lacked personality.

The film was boring for the first hour as sleepless, jet lagged, Alicia didn't want to be on the island anymore than the other people wanted her there. We get clues early on that there are issues. After the first hour, the film turns weird, but I found it lacking in entertainment value because the characters and dialouge had been dead for too long.

This film is not a horror film, nor is it an action-thriller. It is a drama which teases you into thinking it is a thriller. Not something I will own, and regretted the rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb (2 languages) Nudity (Juno Temple) sex?",1376179200,3,1125,4.818652849740933
5763868,3,B00CZO04WI,"'Magic Magic' is definitely the type of movie you probably couldn't (or most likely wouldn't want to) watch a second time. Not because it is grotesque or gruesome.. but because it is incredibly slow-paced (in better terms - pretty boring), and honestly there really isn't much of a point.

The movie is simply about a girl who is vacationing in Chile with her cousin and cousin's friends, and is mentally unraveling. The only reason this movie SLIGHTLY works, is for the fact that it's somewhat believable; a shy anti-social young woman, in a foreign country, stuck with basically a bunch of strangers.. growing more and more paranoid by the day.

The movie successfully made me feel like I was the crazy one, trying to figure out what in the world was going on half of the time..  like trying to figure out who IS crazy, and who ISN'T. Honestly, I watched the whole film, and I understand parts of it, but the big picture is still unclear... I guess I'll have to be okay with never knowing.

I suppose 'Magic Magic' is worth maybe just one watch, but beware this is NOT a horror movie, it is barely a psychological thriller. It is more or less a film showcasing mental illness and the creepiness of Michael Cera.",1375920000,2,1213,4.576036866359447
5763869,1,B00CZO04WI,"This was the worst movie that I have ever seen. It does has the creepiness feeling to it but nothing is ever explained. Ever! We thought that at least something would be explained at the end. But nothing. It just completely cut off. And that was the end. None of us were able to deduce what even happened. If I could give this movie 0 stars, I would.",1375833600,2,350,4.161764705882353
5763870,1,B00CZO04WI,"I just can't say enough bad about this movie.  It appears to work from no script whatever--a hypothesis practically confirmed in the ""making of"" feature--and characterization is limited to ""be as annoying as humanly possible.""  Michael Cera's character was the worst of the lot, a mincing, lispy queen-to-be in the midst of gay panic.  I had no sympathy for any of the characters, thoroughly disliked the lot of them, and could not be bothered to care about what happened to them.  The movie buzzed and droned for what felt like hours (and that was with some fast-forwarding), and then fizzled through a protracted ending that explained nothing, resolved nothing, and made little sense.

All of which makes it seem like if a movie is not perfectly plotted and wrapped up at the end neat as a bow, I won't like it.  Not true.  I love, for example, the ending of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Limbo/dp/B003MUSVA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Limbo</a>.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sucker-Punch/dp/B0051OZ28K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sucker Punch</a>&nbsp;was a bit of a mess, and I loved that, too.  Hell, I even liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-Centipede/dp/B004H00CKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human Centipede</a>, just for the pure novelty of it.  But ""Magic Magic"" is pointless trash with nothing to recommend it.

I see I've garnered four out of four ""not helpfuls"" already.  Please, comment.  Defend this movie.  I really want to know what anyone would see in it.  I'm not being snarky--I'm really curious to know what you think.",1375833600,3,1674,6.190476190476191

5763872,3,B00CZO04WI,"Sorta interesting sorta dull drama about an American (Juno Temple) on vacation in Chile to visit her cousin who is a student down there.  While she and her cousin and her cousin's friends are heading out of town to a remote house the cousin gets a call and finds out she has to go back to school to take an exam, leaving the fragile American tourist in the company of people she doesn't know who are mostly speaking a language she doesn't understand.  Slowly she begins to lose her mind--or so it seems.  Juno Temple is always watchable in anything, even movies that aren't very good (I'm talking about you The Brass Teapot), and she gives a focused, extremely intense performance here even though it's frequently hard to figure out what's wrong with her and why she's acting the way she is.  Michael Cera plays a thoroughly obnoxious American along with the rest who gets under the lead character's skin in a very bad way--at one point she nearly shoots him while he's sleeping, which is almost understandable.  Based on reviews I've read it sounds like Michael Cera played almost the same exact character in Crystal Fairy, which was shot back to back with this film by the same director.  This is definitely an art-house film that requires a fair amount of viewer patience.  Anyone expecting a thriller (which is what the trailer suggested) will be extremely disappointed.",1375747200,15,1374,4.7478991596638656
5763873,4,B00CZO04WI,"Not really what I expected based on the trailer. It's less of a cheap thriller and more of an unsettling exploration of how those with power and ability casually behave toward those who are powerless, weak or vulnerable and the necessity for the latter to be able to process and deal (if possible). I just watched it but I want to watch it again. The characters are multidimensional and the acting is great.
 Michael Cera playing someone totally unlike how we're used to seeing him was a big draw for me, and he did it very well. It's unfortunate if people miss out because they can't see past his name to actually watch the movie.

 It's a bit slower paced than I expected but really worth watching with a great cast and interesting premise.",1375747200,13,742,4.522388059701493
5763874,4,B00CZO04WI,"""She's not a bad person, I know her, she just needs a doctor for her hand."" Alicia (Temple) is a young woman travels to Chile to visit her cousin and her friends. While there the friends begin to make her feel uncomfortable and she wants nothing more then to leave. What starts off as a fun vacation for her soon starts to unravel and becomes something out of a nightmare, for everyone. I will admit that I was kind of looking forward to this mainly for the fact that it looked like Michael Cera was playing a creepy bad guy. Without ruining anything he's not a bad guy but this is a very different part for him. I have to say that Juno Temple was great in this and should get some type of award. As far as the movie, from the opening shot the movie made you feel a little uncomfortable and never really let up at all. The camera work and the acting really leaves you feeling unable to relax and because of that the movie reaches a level of creepiness I wasn't ready for. Watching Temple start to unravel is mesmerizing and when the end finally comes you are left stunned and not sure what to make of what you just saw. A movie that leaves you thinking and wondering to me is the sign of a good movie. Overall, a movie that really comes out of nowhere and makes you feel uncomfortable the whole time, which in this case is a good thing. I give it a B+.",1375228800,20,1352,4.16412213740458
5763875,2,B00CZO04WI,I was bored one night and decided to look up something to watch....I came across this movie and thought it looked interesting. Nope....totally wasted my time.

5763877,4,B00CZO04WI,"This is a very slow paced film, nothing really exciting ever happens in it, there's no action, it's mostly talking or walking around with a paranoid look on a characters face, but it is still entertaining enough.  The acting by Juno Temple is also very good, who plays Alicia, an American who has come to Chile to hang out with her cousin Sara, who has plans of her own to hang out with her friends on a remote property, you can only get to by boat and tells Alicia to get into there car.  Only Sara has other plans, and makes up a story about having to sit an exam and that she'll join them tomorrow when the car makes its first toilet break stop.  Alicia clearly doesn't want to keep going with these group of people who are kind of creepy, hardly speak English, and clearly see her as an inconvenience.  But Sara makes her and promises to join them.  Upon arrival at the property Sara is freaking out because there's no phone reception, in a rare moment she is spoken to she is informed Sara is not coming the next morning as planned.  Michael Cera's creepy loser type character keeps hassling her and laughing at her misfortunes such as when a dog wants to be more than just friends.  Alicia clearly want to be there, is paranoid they are going to do something to her, isn't really sleeping and just hopes Sara will turn up so she can leave this nightmare.

Although it's not your typical slasher, or psychological thriller, and it is very slow, Magic Magic does work, because the scenario is plausible, who hasn't ended up to hang out with or even stay with people you don't like and are a bit uncomfortable around?  Imagine having to do this in a strange country, in an isolated place you don't really know where it is or how to get back to an airport or whatever, even if you did steal their boat.",1483747200,,1804,4.361194029850746

It was nice to see scares that weren't based on how much blood and guts the director could fit into the run time. That being said, I think that the characters were poorly developed (you weren't rooting for the protagonist until the very end, and the comic relief character just came across as obnoxious and annoying), and the main ""villain"" was poorly explained. One has to think about the ending for a while before it actually makes sense, so you end the movie feeling disoriented.

5763885,5,B00CZO04WI,"THIS MOVIE IS SO UNDERRATED!!!!
Magic Magic became my instant FAVORITE. I loved this movie so much that I Googled it to see other people's interpretation. All that I found were people calling it retarded and the worst movie they have ever seen. They hated it so much that they didn't even bother to get into interpretation! WHATTT?! come on.. It's a peice of art.

I will say, I remember when the movie came out and seeing commercials for it. The commercials were a miscommunication to say the least. They advertized showing this horror bloody scary thriller movie, which it is not. I really would like to meet the person who was in charge of the commercial and slap them. Not even kidding. It is because of the commercials, that this movie was hated by so many people. It's a psychological thriller. It makes you think. The video footage is amazing and artistic! I mean, don't even get me started.

I had to watch this 2 times to really understand the little things. The little things are very important in this movie. So, if you watched this movie and it pissed you off, please just try to watch it again. Keeping in mind that it is not supposed to scare you. Just try one more time.

This is a lifelong favorite. I am going to watch this movie the rest of my life. My absolute favorite movie was The Lost Boys. WAS. I still love it... But this topped it by a couple inches. I love it and I hope people can appriciate what I saw in this movie.",1462924800,3,1445,4.364312267657993

5763894,5,B00CZO04WI,"I Saw this film about a year in a half ago when I rented it (yes, people still RENT movies) at a local video store. Being an avid horror fan I had seen the trailer several times and thought it looked okay but nothing I had to run out and see immediately but after seeing it I wish I hadn't took so long.

The story focuses on a pair of friends, one played by lead Juno Temple, who visits one the friends family at their house on a lake. From the beginning it's clear that Juno Temple's character is a bit reserved not feeling at all too comfortable in her unfamiliar surroundings which only increases when her friend has to leave her alone with her family on the lake to take care of some business back at their school. Alone she is further creeped out by the men she has to stay with particularly a character played by Michael Cera, who is very good here playing someone who you cannot quite grasp whether his motives are sincere or sinister.

As the film plays along the viewer's anxiety increases along with the lead character's as we see the film through her uneasy perspective, having the feeling that something terrible could happen at any moment and not sure if that terrible thing could come from the lead character herself.

If you're looking for something a little different that will keep you on the edge of your seat this flick would be a great choice!

Also, it should be noted that if you've seen this trailer you may have an idea about the way the movie plays out. You may be surprised, as I was, because I found the entire story quite different than what the trailer led me to believe, and actually found it more entertaining than I thought I would, also, keep an eye out for a trippy scene that literally will have your head spinning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1440633600,,1774,4.449230769230769

Trippy and obscure atmosphere with a very Polanski-like feel to it.  Definitely a must watch for all Roman Polanski and David Lynch fans.
The movie borderlines on surreal and real...and it is up to the individual viewer to draw conclusion about who is driving who crazy.
Michael Cera and Juno Temple are extraordinary...I would like see more of them in similar character roles.

The movie is basically about a young American girl by the name Alicia visiting her cousin in Chile.  The name Alicia can refer to Alice in Wonderland, (which is sort of  a trippy-fantasy story for Children). Alice or Alicia ends up going on a trip to an isolated cabin with a group of young people who are friends of her cousin.  Her cousin Sara, backs out of the trip in the last minute and Alicia ends up in the cabin with Brink (a somewhat childish, appearing to be bisexual, American expatriate with a confrontational personality), Augustin (Chilean boyfriend of Sara, and the only one who appears to be normal), and Barbara (Chilean girl, and the most mature and oldest in the group, who does not really like Alicia, or so it seems)...

5763912,3,B00CZO04WI,"Lets get something out of the way right off the bat  this isn't a particularly good movie. Frankly its kind of a bad one, but Magic Magic also happens to land in that category of bizarro flicks that are sort of worth seeing anyway, if for no other reason than to expand your cinematic horizons and tell people you actually made it to the end.

On the good side, the acting in Magic Magic is phenomenal, especially from the main actress. But with that stellar acting comes an important question: do you really want to see people convincingly behave in awkward and incredibly off-putting ways for an hour and a half? Because thats essentially the entire movie. Its just people being uncomfortable around one another and saying or doing cringe-inducing things while spending the weekend in a house by a lake in South America.  Theres a side story about someone getting an abortion and covering it up, but like nearly everything else in this movie it amounts to nothing and might as well not have happened at all. Contrary to what the trailer implies or what other reviewers have stated, this is neither a horror movie nor a psychological thriller.

So why the three stars? Because of adorable Michael Cera being amazingly creepy and awkward, and the (completely unintentional) comedy gold that appears two-thirds of the way through the flick. In a truly baffling scene that had my wife and I just staring slack-jawed at the screen, the main character sneaks into Michael Ceras room at night, pulls down her pants, and shoves his face into her crotch, then promptly leaves. Why? Theres no reason, its just something weird that happens in a movie with no plot. Cut to the next scene, and Cera  acting his heart out  looks absolutely dead inside. His eyes give off a soulless and defeated quality for the rest of the movie, because apparently having his face in a vagina just utterly broke him. We were both unable to contain our laughter every time his face appeared for the remaining run time, and Im still suppressing giggles just thinking about it now.

The final segment brings to mind Kill List, in that something bizarre happens for no adequately explainable reason and then the movie doesnt so much end as it sort of just sheepishly stops happening as it realizes its been wasting the audiences time.

This is the story of a girl who has something very very wrong with her,but we don't know what it is. It's creepy and deeply unsettling. I really don't understand the negative reviews. Don't expect cheep thrills or gore. It's slow, but the tension just keeps ratcheting up. You're not really supposed to understand what's happening...I mean, the main character certainly doesn't.

5763923,5,B00CZO04WI,"I was informed of this movie by a young lady I had the extreme privilege of babysitting regularly as she growing up (I was practically a ""second mother"" to her). Once she was old enough (i.e. adult) to not need adult supervision, I had sincerely hoped to maintain contact as friends but that did not happen. Apparently I was not ""hip"" enough. So when she texted me recently to watch Magic Magic - well, let's just say I did not need to be told twice.

This is a curiously nightmarish little quasi-horror film with a stupendous performance by Michael Cera. Usually one of the most annoying little turkeys around (after 'Arrested Development' his schtick just got on my nerves), in this he is unlike any other role he has played. Confused about his orientation, he and his group of friend in Chile basically do a lot of drinking and wasting time. When Juno Temple comes to visit her friend (all the others, including Mr. Cera, are strangers to her) she immediately feels out of place.

Her friend leaves - supposedly for school-related reasons, but it is hinted to be something possibly more concerning. Juno is left with a bunch of people she doesn't know who mostly speak Spanish around her and creep her out. That is, until her own behavior takes a startling turn and she begins creeping them out. Even as a neo-femme, I couldn't endorse her signature move which she employs against Cera.",1381190400,2,1389,4.66530612244898

5763928,4,B00CZO04WI,"One of the most deeply unsettling films made in the past few years! Magic Magic follows Alicia, a native Californian who travels to Chile to spend time with her cousin, Sarah. Along for the ride is Barbara, a forbidding young Chilean, Augustin, Sarah's boyfriend, and Brink (Michael Cera), who is just plain creepy. As the days go by, Alicia, who is not sleeping and is taking several kinds of medication, begins to lose her grip and struggles to distinguish reality from hallucinations. The premise of the film comes off as rather trite, but the execution is actually more than effective. Usually, in these kind of 'descent to madness' movies, it is spelled out to the audience at the beginning that there is something 'wrong' with the main character. The charm of Magic Magic is that the viewer is completely alienated through the abrupt beginning and is given absolutely no edge on any of the characters in the film. It is, in this sense, a shockingly real and visceral experience.

Beyond the surface lies another layer to the madness. At it's roots, Magic Magic can be seen as a movie about the insecurities of Americans and their inability to cope under foreign circumstances. Alicia is forced to live in a jungle with no technology and she is driven to tears because she can't use her cell phone. She also tries to comfort herself by reading Freedom by Jonathan Franzen but finds she can't concentrate in her surroundings. Seen under this light, the movie is more unsettling and relatable to it's American viewers.

What really makes Magic Magic pop though is the terrific and incredibly realistic acting from the entire cast. Juno Temple (Alicia) and Michael Cera (Brink) are especially noteworthy in their portrayals of deeply-flawed and emotionally unstable characters. On the technical side, the intrusive camera style mixes perfectly with the ominous, unnerving musical score to create a paranoid atmosphere that doesn't let up for one second until the very last frame.

Chilean writer/director Sebastian Silva deftly manages to create a film that sticks out as both unique and artfully meritorious in the often-corny and unrealistic psychological thriller genre.",1378771200,2,2175,5.069832402234637

5763934,4,B00CZO04WI,"I'm always on the lookout for original cinema and recently encountered this little gem. Good movies are those that you think about days and weeks after watching them. How many times has some big movie washed over you eyes and a few days later you wonder, did I see that movie or not? Face it, most films are entirely forgettable. ""Magic Magic"" is certainly not one of those. Not knowing much of anything about the plot of the film, I sat down to watch and immediately it grabbed my attention. There is a shot near the beginning when the characters are seen for the first time. But we don't see their faces, we see their midsections. Knowing what I know about the conventions of film making, I was taken aback and thought, ""this film might be interesting"". And man... was it ever.

A girl goes to Chile to visit her cousin. She meets her cousin's friends and gets stuck with them for a couple of days until her cousin comes back from the city to be part of the group. Every character is portrayed in this off-kilter manner that makes them seem like raving psychopaths. At first we sympathize with the main character because she's stuck with these creeps but slowly we the audience begin to suspect that the main character herself may be completely insane.

This is a dark film, a deeply unnerving portrayal of mental illness and subjective states. It seemed a little bit David Lynch at times. In other instances, it felt like a straight up horror film but without any of the horror conventions. There are no serial killers or monsters just a journey through a person's interior madness. The most innocuous situations like petting a dog, going for a car ride, sleeping alone in your room, playing games with friends, everything feels like a Kafka nightmare. The filmmakers turn every character into a demon just with the use of atmospheric lighting and camerawork. One of the cinematographers on the film is Christopher Doyle, who worked wonders with Hong Kong master Wong Kar Wai. The style of the film is very subjective and those viewers seeking easy explanations won't find them.

The director Sebastian Silva is definitely a unique talent to watch and I will be seeing more of his work in the future. Don't listen to the naysayers with the one star ratings, they don't know what they're talking about. There is real quality film making going on here. The main character in this film suffers from insomnia and I myself was watching this film after staying up for about 30 hours. I could totally identify with what she was going through. What a bizarre film. I don't know why it's called ""Magic Magic"", which seems kind of random, but I don't care. Fascinating stuff that blows conventional horror movies and psychological thrillers out of the water.",1377993600,10,2751,4.703319502074689

5763940,2,B00CZO04WI,"This movie is hard to watch for multiple reasons.  The plot is unsubstantial and vague which forces the movie to rely on atmosphere and characters.  Unfortunately, while the atmosphere is well-calculated to be jarring and disturbing, the characters are off-putting and difficult to sympathize with, and the dialogue and soundtrack are overall grating and irritating, all of this combines to create an unpleasant movie experience that left me feeling not just unfulfilled but downright icky.  There are no real scares or gore or supernatural elements to qualify it as a horror movie, and while I did experience a sense of dread watching events unfurl and devolve into an unhappy ending, there is no real suspense.  A mentally unstable girl (it was never clear to me if she had a diagnosable mental illness, or was just ungrounded by circumstances) lands in a foreign country where her group of hosts are rude and unfeeling.  The unfriendly environment and lack of emotional support combine with a bad case of sleep deprivation and any possible existing mental illness to completely unhinge her.  Her hosts do not handle her difficulties with compassion or competence leading to a very unhappy result.  I cannot recommend this to anyone - if extreme unpleasantness was the filmmakers' intentions, they have succeeded, but this very slow movie does not have any redeeming qualities to make it worth your time and money.",1376438400,2,1416,5.103896103896104

5763942,5,B00CZO04WI,"Bursting with atmosphere, awkwardness, and tension--thanks to the fantastic performance of the cast (but mostly Temple and Cera)--Magic Magic scores as a quintessential slow crawl to madness. Whereas other reviewers described the first few acts as ""slow and boring,"" it was, in fact, crucial for characterization and atmosphere and filled with so many entertaining details and nuances. Even in the early parts you could feel the direction this story was heading, even if you couldn't quite guess the ultimate result. By the end, I was thoroughly impressed with the whole production and very upset at how poorly it was received.

Magic Magic deserves 5 stars. It did everything right--from writing and direction, to casting and acting--for what it wanted to be. However, this sub-genre simply isn't everyone's favorite flavor and it was terribly misrepresented in the States. Those expecting a straight out hurtle of a horror film will be the most disappointed because it's not. So watch it if you like dark drama, or to see one of the best descents into madness since Roman Polanski's ""The Tenant,"" or to enjoy the masterful performance of this promising cast.
