8605129,5,B00EFW28DQ,"This is a great show.  Most automobile repair/restoration TV shows are more about conflict in the shop than they are instructional.  This show is about two likable fellows who cooperate to obtain and improve cars for resale and I find that much more entertaining.  The cars are sometimes unusual and nearly always interesting.  The mechanic, Ed China, is a great teacher and I only wish the show provided him time to show more of the work done on some of the cars.",1481068800,,464,4.621951219512195
