8362249,5,B002BWP2HG,"Recently exposed to the Penn/Teller B.S. shows and must say I was instantly hooked.  Covers everything from Video Game Violence, the Vatican, Organic Food, Taxes, Stress, Lie Detection and more.  The format I assume is the same as previous seasons, the humor is good, but predictable after about the 3rd episode.  All in all, good relevant topics and a good representation of the ""other"" side of the arguments.  A pleasure to watch, entertaining and insightful.  Kudos to Showtime and Penn/Teller for making ""educational"" TV fun and presenting the opposing view to what so many are spoon fed to believe.  Now I just have to go back and watch the first 6 seasons!",1259280000,2,662,4.866071428571429
