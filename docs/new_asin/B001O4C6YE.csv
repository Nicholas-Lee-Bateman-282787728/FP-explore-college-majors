8329361,4,B001O4C6YE,"This was a good deal for two dvds. We really love the ""Trusty Friends"" shows. ""On the Site with Thomas"" has one storyline that was scary for my 3 year old, so that was annoying.",1452124800,,177,4.085714285714285

8329364,5,B001O4C6YE,Bought this DVD for my 3 year old after seeing some of these episodes on youtube and he loves it. He has been watching it every day several times a day. He is into Thomas and construction equipment in general and this DVD has all of this combined. So he knows all the characters and performes the stories from the DVD with his little trucks. Recommend this to people with little boys who like Thomas and his friends.,1294358400,,416,4.346153846153846
8329365,5,B001O4C6YE,"My son ABSOLUTELY LOVES this DVD.  He is a huge Thomas the Tank Engine fan and loves to watch Thomas. This DVD has two movies in one as well as all the special features (songs, interactive items, etc...) makes this purchase one of the best I have made as far as DVDs go.  I would recommend to all.",1240185600,,297,4.103448275862069
