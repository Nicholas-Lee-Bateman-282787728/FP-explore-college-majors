4972261,5,B0067Q2BNA,The video is simple and straightforward.  Does a great job in explaining change.  Excellent for a staff or project meeting.,1389830400,,123,5.1
4972262,5,B0067Q2BNA,This book is an easy 45 minute read that illustrates the importance of responding to changing times. The point is made though the telling of a fable about a colony of penguins whose existence is threatened.,1375574400,,206,4.75
4972263,3,B0067Q2BNA,I would have hoped for more in the presentation. It did not really get me to excited to use this as a training material.,1374624000,,120,4.041666666666667
4972264,5,B0067Q2BNA,"This is a very good, condensed flick that should appeal to all audiences. I have found that it captures  attention while walking people through the stages of cultural modifications. I could really relate the various personalities that were encountered during the penquins' efforts to improve their situation to every day organizational life. Good ice breaker, no pun intended.",1336521600,,376,5.482758620689655
8494376,5,B0067Q2BNA,Great. I got this to use for a small company meeting (for less than a handful of people). Great message and great platform to create better teamwork.,1488499200,,149,4.555555555555555
8494377,5,B0067Q2BNA,Great little movie!,1473379200,,19,5.666666666666667

8494379,1,B0067Q2BNA,Do Buy This the DVD did not play,1444867200,,32,3.125
8494380,2,B0067Q2BNA,It is a bit too simple and missed out some important learning points from the book.  The quality of cartoon is not very high too.,1436400000,,129,4.16
8494381,5,B0067Q2BNA,thanks a lot,1423872000,,12,3.3333333333333335
8494382,4,B0067Q2BNA,"Already used it in a number of workplaces, with a positive response",1408838400,,67,4.666666666666667
8494383,5,B0067Q2BNA,Nice and short movie about chnagemanagement.,1407628800,,44,6.5
8494384,3,B0067Q2BNA,The DVD is great IF you have read the book. But if there was a little more time taken to flush out the characters it would have been richer. I thought it might help show different styles of leadership - which comes out in the book - but the point seems to be more about the steps to change. Just wish it had taken even another 5 minutes to flush out that side of the story.,1402099200,,373,3.9210526315789473
8494385,2,B0067Q2BNA,"Way too expensive for a low grade brief video with no supporting literature or guidelines for a group presentation. Sent back immediately. Lost half my money for ""restocking fee"".",1391472000,,179,5.206896551724138
