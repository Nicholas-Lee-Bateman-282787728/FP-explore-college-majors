1937903,5,B0000EMYC2,The Bee Gees have released a two DVD set. Disc One is the story of The Bee Gees. Disc Two is the One Night Only concert. I don't have much of a say. Enjoy.,1082419200,,155,3.588235294117647
1937904,5,B0000EMYC2,"Great content, as I remember it from the first time I saw part of the concert while traveling in Thailand. While the original copy of the One Night Only concert I saw in a bar may have been bootlegged, it inspired me to buy a copy with the ""story."" Surprisingly, the two cd's were mis-labeled. The concert was on the ""story"" CD, and the story was on the ""One Night Only"" CD. Both seem to work fine. Odd that a major publisher would screw up a small detail like this. Fortunately, not a bigger mistake!",1076976000,4,501,4.28421052631579

1937906,5,B0000EMYC2,"This kind of combination of DVD's at this price is almost unheard of. You will pay more if you buy either just, ""One Night Only"" or ""The Offical Story"" separately. They are virtually the same discs. The Gibbs decided to release this special package as, obviously, with the terrible passing of Maurice Gibb, this is the last concert and last series of interviews about the famous siblings and their families.
As the final Bee Gees DVD (officially) this set includes the entire MGM Grand concert from Las Vegas, Nevada (1997) and the brilliant 'life story' interviews of the Gibb family history from their humble beginnings in Manchester, England to the year 2001. If you ever wanted to really know what the three brothers are like, this is the most intimate interview they have ever done. To this day, they remain unjaded and still have the urge for that next big song or album. The overall atmosphere is upbeat and cheery. It's the kind of interview interspersed with film clips, song tracks and video. This is the ultimate Bee Gees keeper. Enjoy!",1070236800,66,1047,4.790055248618785

The other DVD ""The Official Story..."" is even better in my opinion.  It has a wonderful history of the Bee Gees with countless interviews and videos.  An added bonus is the video of the song ""This Is Where I Came In.""  It is definitely my favorite Bee Gees video.  Barry, Robin, and Maurice must have had a blast making this video.

1937919,5,B0000EMYC2,Love the Beegees.  It was great to hear their story and made me love their music all the more.

1937923,5,B0000EMYC2,Bought as a gift for a real Bee Gees fan.  It was the last time The Brothers Gibb (BG's) performed together....and a fitting tribute to their musical legacy.,1426809600,,157,4.607142857142857
1937924,3,B0000EMYC2,"Only three stars due to current price on Amazon of over $62 - how many millions did the Gibb Brothers make?  Sure there are two dvds in this set but still seems overpriced - thank god for our public library having it available. Also only 3 stars because of agreement with reviewer over on imdb.com for the documentary dvd - Bee Gees: This Is Where I Came In (10 Dec. 2000).  If so family oriented why not more about Andy Gibb and his several year struggle with addictions and depression? Guilt?  And why hardly any mention of sister Lesly who apparently was talented enough to stand in for a 1969 performance for one of the twins?

I may change my rating after playing the One Night Only dvd of the 1997 Las Vegas performance.  Although the cd of the same performance does not include all the performance the blu-ray SD DVD does include all of the performance with great sound - and that concert dvd only costs $13 with almost two and half hours of over 34 songs.",1425859200,,963,4.387640449438202

1937926,5,B0000EMYC2,"If you are a Bee Gees fan you'll enjoy this!  Also the addition of the video and song ""This Is Where I Came In"", shows you the direction the group was heading.  I think it's another example of their incredible ability to transform themselves and their musical style.  I just wish they and us could have had more time to explore this direction.",1411862400,,343,4.412698412698413

1937929,5,B0000EMYC2,"but I saw this on PBS and they are amazing, both for their music and longevity. Even just staying together without killing each other is a great accomplishment, and their performances are still riveting.

1937931,5,B0000EMYC2,"This is a brilliant account of the lives and legacy of one of the most talented and ( I dare say) genius of this family. Please watch the documentary first. It is amazing that they could write songs in 10 to 25 minutes.  Afterwards, watch and listen to this performance years later.... They were still on mark and will make you want to get up and dance! I believe only one of the Bee Gee's brothers is still alive. This is an iconic show that should not be missed.",1373414400,,464,4.213483146067416

1937933,5,B0000EMYC2,I loved it. I learned so much about the Gibb family. They are so normal and down to earth. The sound and picture was of excellent quality. Definately would recommend it.,1362528000,,169,4.483870967741935
1937934,5,B0000EMYC2,"I am so glad I got this a few years ago and kept it.
It's the ""Brothers Gibb"" at their best in their prime.
We may no longer have Robin & Maurice but we have their memories.
And the three on video to relive those memories at least.
Anyone who enjoys the Bee Gees is sure to love this 2 disc compilation.
It's well worth the increased value to own and keep and watch.",1357603200,,366,3.9594594594594597
1937935,5,B0000EMYC2,"When I first viewed this video it was on VHS and it was already 10 years old. Maurice and Robyn were still alive at the time. I had followed their music before the disco era but had not delve into their humble childhood beginnings. This 2 DVD Set will give you both, a first class evening of entertainment and music performances on one DVD and the wonderful story of the Bee Gees from the start of their illustrious career on the bonus DVD. You will not be disappointed and if you start with their story DVD you'll begin to understand how much they contributed to Rock and why they generated top sales and the awards. You'll stand up and cheer as if you are live in the audience. They are by far the most misunderstood Rock Group of all times.",1353196800,4,743,4.314285714285714

1937937,5,B0000EMYC2,This is wonderful DVD.  Greatest of all time!  Did not leave out any of my favorite songs.  This is actually a 2 DVDs.  The additional one is about the BeeGees growing up.  What a remarkable story.  You could tell they all actually had the same goals - not competition with each other.  Loved it!!,1343260800,,297,4.388888888888889
1937938,5,B0000EMYC2,"One word, AWESOME! Simply, the best! Provides a very insightful background to each individual's development. This is a MUST for any true Bee Gees fan.",1316476800,,150,5.04
1937939,4,B0000EMYC2,The concert sounds fantastic on a surround system (DTS the best version) and if you're a Bee Gees fan then it's a must have - excellent.  You'll kick yourself if you let it slip by... over and over and over again.,1309824000,,213,4.195121951219512

The energy in the arena was electric and they were fantastic.",1305849600,,271,4.0

well made. They sound better now than when they were young!!!",1240790400,,124,4.681818181818182
1937942,5,B0000EMYC2,I ordered BOTH a the CD of the BEE GEES greatest hits as well as the DVD One Night Only.  I had the good fortune of seeing the BEE GEES perform in New Orleans back in the late 70's.  One Night Only brings back so many wonderful memories from that night.  One incredible performance.  I've already watched it several times.,1220745600,,322,4.316666666666666
1937943,5,B0000EMYC2,"I just received this DVD from Amazon yesterday, and I'm delighted with it.  A high-energy concert with great song selection and great mixing of the order of the tunes, and up-and-down flow of the concert.

The video is first rate, filmed from a nice indoor venue at MGM-Grand, Las Vegas.

But the audio is absolutely top-notch.  I take issue with a reviewer or two who criticized the sound engineer for this recording.  The DTS mix is fantastic!  The orchestra is well-miked and well-mixed on all channels, but the vocals are unbelievably fabulous recordings.....perfect miking and perfect DTS channel mix and encoding.  Whomever reported that the center channel is ""weak"" is dead wrong, and should tune up his system.

I've got a huge concert DVD collection, and only one of my DVD's has this level of sound quality, and that is Steely Dan's ""Two Against Nature"".

I'd rate these two as equal....",1212710400,,897,4.887417218543046
1937944,5,B0000EMYC2,"I truely enjoyed my new Bee Gees DVD. I love the songs and I have always been a fan for years even from school days.

The quality is supurb both audio and picture quality and I watch the videos every week.

If you are a Bee Gees fan you will truley appreciate and love this DVD, especially since it's the last concert before Maurice's untimely death.

You can see how much fun they are having with each other singing on stage and cracking their little jokes....buy it!!!

It's one to be treasured",1208995200,,496,4.358695652173913
1937945,5,B0000EMYC2,Absolutely outstanding concert - 32 songs in a row of choice older and newer Bee Gees hits. Some I didn't even know were written by the Bee Gees. Great audio and video recording. My only gripe with the concert was that a few of my favorite songs were cut short.,1207526400,,261,4.24
1937946,5,B0000EMYC2,"I found this to be an awesome video of these amazing musician brothers. There was a special tribute to Andy which I thought was so special. Olivia Newton John was a guest in the front row which was so great when they sang the Grease Song.  I rate this five star.

1937947,5,B0000EMYC2,"The Bee Gees were the first band I really loved growing up. Sad to say I never owned any of their albums as I was rather young and money was tight in those days. Over the years I grew away from them and listened to other artists. It is only recently that I've rediscovered them and I'm so glad I have. It's easy to forget how they dominated the music scene in the 70s, whether it was their own recordings or songs they had written for others. They were literally everywhere.

I enjoyed watching the 2-hour documentary. I never really knew their story and I surely didn't know the early years. It makes me want to check out their older recordings. I also enjoyed seeing them as real people and express their love for each other and their families. You just didn't see interviews like that back in the day.

I also enjoyed the concert. Their harmonies send chills down my spine. Some of the songs I had forgotten about and was pleased to hear again. I don't have a wide-screen tv yet, so I can't really complain about it not being recorded in wide-screen, but maybe someday it will be re-released that way.",1206403200,4,1104,4.4068627450980395
1937948,5,B0000EMYC2,"2 discs jam packed with clips, history, songs, and humor for this price is absolutely unheard of.  I was mesmorized from beginning to end, especially with the history DVD.  I knew nothing about the Bee Gee's early beginnings, I just knew I'd been listening to them since their first hit in 1967 and that every couple of years they'd re-emerge with another release that I, and countless others, would love.  The numerous songs they wrote, including the incomparable Saturday Night Fever soundtrack and their follow up album,  proved they were indeed blessed from birth and a driving force no one could stop. They would write 3 songs in 20 minutes and they'd all soar to #1.  I remember hearing someone say at a restaurant back in 1979 as their music was being piped in, ""man, the Bee Gees are on fire"" and indeed they were.  Their timeless appeal continues to amaze.  With Barry's falsetto, Robin's strong vibratto and Maurice's harmonies, their One Night Only concert was flawless.  Although the history disc ends in 2001 which would be 2 years prior to Maurice's untimely death, the disc does a wonderful job of portraying their struggles and triumphs through the years, their addictions, interviws with wives and parents and even discussing their discontent with one another at one point.  But, they were not meant to be apart, a classic example of the sum being greater than it's parts was the Bee Gees.  Sadly, we will not hear from them again for the Bee Gee's died with Maurice. This double disc is an absolute must for any Bee Gee fan.",1203120000,2,1542,4.741573033707865
1937949,5,B0000EMYC2,"I have been a Bee Gees fan my entire life, beginning as a teen in the 1960's.  Their music has always touched the core of my soul, through their words, their music, their style, their passion and emotion that fills the senses and tugs at the heart strings as we engage ourselves in a musical universe only these remarkable musicians can create.  If you share my view, won't you join me in writing to the Academy Award people to encourage them to consider awarding this incredible talent with their missing and long overdue honorary Academy Award, the only one missing from their shelf, not only for their decades of phenomenal contribution to music but also to music in film.

This 2-DVD set will move you in more ways than one can describe as you relive the music and the years that paralleled our lives.  It is a flawless, perfect concert, with ALL their greatest, and ALL the energetic talent that you will be able to relive over and over again.  This set gives us their history, their talent, along with the bittersweet sense of the loss of an era with the passing of Andy and Maurice.

I have been a fan of many bands over the years, none have left their imprint as do their music and words, and words are certainly not all they have had to take our hearts away.  They have held us and taken us away for over 40 years with their phenomenal gift of love expressed through their talent of song.

1937951,5,B0000EMYC2,"For fans of any era of the Bee Gees, this is an awesome selection to purchase.  The live concert was great, it even contained a few songs not usually found on other albums, such as them singing Grease instead of that other guy on the soundtrack.  Also includes Run To Me and Heartbreaker, both of which I don't have yet on CD, but will soon.
The biography story was especially great, maybe a bit long for some, (two hours I think), but really great for the devoted fan.  This was recorded before Maurice died, so it's also interesting to hear them speak of each other and their love even before the tragedy.  Also included on the DVD is their new video, This Is Where I Came In.
I shared the set with my mom who was a bit skeptical at first and doesn't often find time to watch such things, but she really loved it too, every minute of it she said.  She's gonna buy her own copy asap, you should too.",1182902400,2,900,4.209302325581396
1937952,5,B0000EMYC2,"The previous reviews we read before getting this production fell short to what we got...not only a flashback to our 'Saturday Night Fever' times but also the lasting impression of knowing the real insights of their career, the toll in their family and the perseverance that still lasts. The B.G's have confirmed once more they are the greatest group ever (even beyond the Beatles). They cannot only sing but turn into lyrics the best of our human nature. Absolutely EXTRAORDINARY!",1176163200,,480,5.0125
1937953,5,B0000EMYC2,"This is a great combination of two dvd's with one chronicling the group's history and background and the other is one of their final live performances.  One Night Only has many touching moments that span from their early music, their family, and their many movie soundtracks.

1937955,5,B0000EMYC2,"With this DVD/CD set you get a great concert by one of the greatest song writing and performing groups ever. Having enjoyed the music of the Bee Gees for almost 40 years, and never seeing them in concert, it was a real treat.

While I have enjoyed their music I was never aware of their story.  Learning about the many profesional and personal ups and downs and the impact these events had on their music and lives, and in many cases resulting in some of their best songs, gave me a greater  appreciation for their music.

Get this set.",1152576000,8,536,4.383838383838384

I have always enjoyed the Bee Gee's, but after watching this I have to say, they are truly unsurpassed! They are song writing legends and magnificent performers. This DVD is a must have. I enjoyed this DVD so much, I have bought 3 other copies for friends. Every song on this DVD takes you back in time, I had forgotten how many countless number one hits they had amongst the array of top 20 songs. This DVD is a must have to anyone that merely liked the Bee Gee's. You will not be disappointed",1138752000,9,623,4.243697478991597
1937957,5,B0000EMYC2,"If you're a Bee Gees fan,and own a DVD player,this item is an absolute must! You'd pay more if you purchased these DVD's,if they were packaged separately. You get the ONE NIGHT ONLY concert,whether or not you were in attandance at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Hotel and Casino on November 14,1997. You'll hear songs and a few spoken words that didn't make it to the album. Although the trio no longer had their brass ensemble,The Boneroo Horns,they had Celine Dion,who performs IMMORTALITY,with the trio supplying the background vocals. We also see Olivia Newton-John in attendance,when they perform GREASE,Barry Gibb's personally penned hit song from the 1978 Paramount musical of the same title. Also the trio performs OUR LOVE(DON'T THROW IT ALL AWAY) with previously recorded vocals of their late former teen idol baby brother Andy Gibb. ""This is our song for Andy."",quipps Barry. The Bee Gees themselves later recorded the song after Andy(from Andy's 1978 album SHADOW DANCING). The song also appears on Barbra Streisand's new album,GUILTY PLEASURES,which commemorates the 25th anniversary of the release of GUILTY(GUILTY and GP were both produced,with others,by Barry). The trio also perform GUILTY,HEARTBREAKER(a hit for Dionne Warwick),and ISLANDS IN THE STREAM(a hit for Kenny Rogers with Dolly Parton). They also have their fans getting down to YOU SHOULD BE DANCING,from 1976's CHILDREN OF THE WORLD,and from the 1977 Paramount film SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER,STAYIN' ALIVE,HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE,NIGHT FEVER and MORE THAN A WOMAN. Stephen Gibb joins his father Barry and Barry's brothers fraternal twins Robin and the late Maurice in this concert. Maurice introduces at one point in the concert,the members of the trio's back-up band. An excerpt of YSBD precedes ALONE,from the trio's 1997 album STILL WATERS(SW was released six months before the recording of ONO). ONO is a sequel to HERE AT LAST...LIVE which was recorded in 1976 at the Los Angeles Forum. The second DVD,The Official Story,is a documentary of the group. Barry got his first guitar a half-century ago. He was nine years old at the time. Before the Gibb brothers made it big,they would perform at various talent shows. Barry played his guitar and Maurice and Robin would sing(Barry sang as well). Robert Stigwood was to the Bee Gees what Brian Epstein and George Martin were to the Beatles,the group's business manager and producer. The trio's association with Stigwood ended in 1981 though. The Manchester,England natives lived in Australia for a few years,returned to England and in 1967,made their debut,musically,in the United States. The Bee Gees were a quintet then,the other two members being Australians Colin Petersen and Vince Melouney. One was the drummer and the other was the bass guitarist(I'm not sure who played what). Robin left the Bee Gees in early 1969 and returned to the group around the summer of 1970. Minus Robin,Barry and Maurice put out CUCUMBER CASTLE and Robin released his solo debut ROBIN'S REIGN. Petersen and Melouney were out of the group by then,and the Gibbs carried on as a trio. In 1975,with disco still in its infancy,the Gibbs released MAIN COURSE,spawning one of their biggest all-time hits,JIVE TALKIN'. The brothers had then entered the world of R&B.  By the way,Otis Redding was supposed to record TO LOVE SOMEBODY,but was killed in a plane crash before he had the chance to do so. So the Gibbs recorded the song themselves. The brothers spent the next four years in the R&B world,releasing COTW,their songs for the SNF soundtrack and SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN. In that time period,they jumpstarted Andy's career which would falter due to drug use(Andy's drug addiction led to his death in 1988). As the 1980's began,they took time out to write and produce songs for GUILTY,Warwick's HEARTBREAKER album and Rogers' EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK album. However,the brothers released LIVING EYES in 1981. In 1983,the same year that ETSITD was released,the brothers put out five new songs:THE WOMAN IN YOU,I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH,BREAKOUT,SOMEONE BELONGING TO SOMEONE and LIFE GOES ON for the STAYING ALIVE soundtrack(SA was a not-too-popular sequel to SNF). Also Barry and Robin were recording and releasing solo albums throughout the 80's. The Bee Gees also wrote and produced songs for Diana Ross. 1987 saw the brothers' Warner Bros. debut,E.S.P. which spawned only one Top 20 hit,YOU WIN AGAIN. Following E.S.P. two years later is ONE,with only one Top 20 hit,the title track. HIGH CIVILIZATION followed in 1991,and again,only one Top 20 hit,SECRET LOVE. The brothers were dropped from WB afterward and moved to Polydor,the label that bought out RSO(Robert Stigwood Organization) in or around 1984(both labels were divsions of PolyGram). RSO originally released MC,COTW,SNF,the GREASE soundtrack,SHF,LE and SA. RSO also released the SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND soundtrack(the 1978 film,based on Beatles songs,starred the Gibbs and Peter Frampton). Polydor distributed,originally,SIZE ISN'T EVERYTHING in 1993 and STILL WATERS in 1997(sorry,the documentary stops at 1997 since this documentary was released then). The Bee Gees legacy died with Maurice Gibb in January 2003. The cause of 53-year-old Maurice's death was an intestinal blockage. Maurice died at a Miami hospital(the Florida town where he last lived). Barry and Robin are Miami residents as well and have been since the 70's. The Gibbs' mother,the former Barbara Pass,gave interviews on the documentary also. Barry and Robin are continuing their musical careers today,but not under the Bee Gees name. They believe that without Maurice,there is no Bee Gees although the group once briefly existed without Robin. I dedicate these items to the memories of Andy,Maurice and the Gibbs' father Hugh.",1131408000,16,5761,5.275599128540305
1937958,4,B0000EMYC2,The music DVD is great.  But I was disappointed that it was not in widescreen mode.  During a section of the DVD the brothers did a series of older songs in short spurts using great harmony and simple guitar accompaniment.  I wish they'd do the entire songs.  The other DVD - a documentary about their past - is not that great.,1127692800,2,327,4.311475409836065
1937959,5,B0000EMYC2,"What a great set this is. A fantastic two hour biography from the beginning of their career to their last studio album to date. Also, a concert from a couple years before including a line-up of their greatest hits plus some new cuts from Still Waters. Great performances!

Anyone who appreciates good music from one of the best and most underrated groups in rock and roll history needs to see this DVD set. I would think that even if you aren't a fan of the Gibb brothers or if you only like one period of their music, you will still appreciate and enjoy this collection.

Another incentive is the price. For two discs and nearly four hours of fun, it is one of the best buys out there.

Put this collection in your cart now!!",1126051200,6,726,4.362962962962963
1937960,4,B0000EMYC2,"If you love the Bee Gees, you can't go wrong with picking this one up.

First the ""One Night Only"" DVD...

Filmed at the MGM Grand in Vegas and instead of doing a full-length tour at a time when they were writing a lot of songs, they decided to do one show in '97 promoting the ""Still Waters"" CD for TV and eventually for home video and CD. They used tapes of Frankie Valli and Andy Gibb's voices during a couple of the songs, and had an ""unplugged"" portion of the concert going through some of the older stuff as well as the songs they produced and wrote for Dionne Warwick, Kenny Rogers, and Barbra Streisand.

Celine Dion does a song with them, and isn't her usual over the top self.

The surround mix is decent, mostly used for crowd noise over music, the video itself is crisp, clear and brings out the stage lighting to nice effect. The concert DVD has an ""extra"" interview which seemed more in place with the other DVD. I think the ""Live By Request"" surround mix might be the better buy for the audiophile (which was 90 minutes of singing and anecdotes and more of an ""informal"" setting), but the crowd and brothers' energy in this setting and set was better.

The Bee Gees themselves sound in fine form, although Barry's falsettos seemed strained at times, even though he hit them. By the time he does ""Stayin' Alive"", it's almost 2 hours later, but that's minor nitpicking. The fact that they take pride in harmonizing live is evident. It's one you can have the TV on or off for and still enjoy either way.

The documentary covers most bases of their career from a skiffle trio to master singers, songwriters and performers, the good, the bad and the tacky, and includes a promo of ""This is Where I Came In"". The brothers, Robert Stigwood, George Martin, and others tell the tale of the Bee Gees, a lot of footage that hasn't been seen for the most part. The ""extras"" break down the interviews between the brothers, most of which isn't in the documentary itself. Maurice mentions that he would have loved to have had an Oscar for ""Saturday Night Fever"", which at that time wasn't even nominated. Face it, they cracked open the field for soundtracks that sell in the tens of millions nowaday.

They talk about sudden fame, reinventing their image, drugs, touring, family spats and bonding, breaking up and getting together, Andy Gibb, Sgt. Pepper, songwriting, the disco backlash and how they've managed to stay together and stay sane through 4 decades, not too different than the Beatles ""Anthology"" except the length of time is far shorter. Hardcore fans will think it being too glossed over, but people who have been fans for years will love it, esp. the early footage of when they were kids.

They also show that their humor was also a glue in keeping them together. They are notorious for having X-rated humor (they did grow up in some pretty rough neighborhoods and were delinquents themselves) which would have been funny to see on here, but I guess they wanted to avoid parental advisory stickers...

What I would love to see the Bee Gees put more of the archive footage out without narration over it. They have a major advantage of having done promo videos since the 60s up to 2001, TV appearances and having their concerts filmed. I think that with some editing, digging up the multitrack recordings, and digital mastering, it would be a treasure trove for fans old and young alike.

Also, if you haven't picked up ""The Record"", a 2 CD set of most of their hits, it should be next on your list. And then get ""Birth of Brilliance"" which compiles all their early stuff. And then get all their CDs, starting with ""1st"". Listening to it now, it is almost a shock that kids that age (they were pretty much the age Britney Spears was when she became popular) could write such songs, without one cover song on it, and were able to continue to making over 30 albums including solo projects and writing songs for others, almost all of which are worth picking up.

If you love harmonies, have an overall love of music, or an up and coming singer-songwriter, do yourself a favor,ignore the polyester suits forget about the disco era, start from the beginning and learn from the masters. It's a hell of a legacy they've left us.",1095033600,22,4234,4.565217391304348
1937961,5,B0000EMYC2,"""The Official Story"" DVD is a concise and well-documented Bee Gees biography, but it glosses over a few details concerning the departure of former guitarist Vince Melouney and drummer Colin Petersen.

The ""One Night Only"" DVD is of the Bee Gee's last live performances with songs from their entire career. Unfortunately, Barry was suffering from a back injury and you can see he's in a lot of pain.  I could do without the ""special performance"" of Celine Dion.",1092009600,22,460,4.884615384615385
1937962,5,B0000EMYC2,"This is a fantastic 2-disc set and a must-have for all you Bee Gees fans out there. Apart from the terrific live concert, the biography itself is worth the price of the 2 discs. I've seen another biography ""Keppel Road - The life and music of the Bee Gees"" which is available as a region 2 DVD on the UK amazon site. But the ""Official Story"" beats it hands down in terms of richness of content and presentation.
A few earlier reviewers have talked about the discs being mislabelled, but the discs I received were correctly labelled. So either those reviewers unfortunately received items from a bad batch or else the publishers have rectified the error.
