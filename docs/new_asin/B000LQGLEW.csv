8163602,5,B000LQGLEW,"Back & Biceps (which I've completed 12 times so far) is a fast-paced and effective workout.  It is 51:36 so it is shorter than some of the other workouts in the P90x series.  It offers 24 exercises.  After the usual warm-up and stretch, it starts with wide front pull-ups and then three bicep exercises, followed by another pull-up style, three bicep exercises, etc. (every third fourth exercise is a pull-up move).  As with the other resistance workouts in P90x, you need a pull-up bar like Iron Gym as well as bands or dumbbells.

Tony Horton, Bobby Stephenson and company move quickly through the workouts.  Sometimes I have to pause the DVD to switch weights because they transition so quickly.  This workout has the dreaded corn cob pull-ups as well as the towel pull-ups (I usually use the bars that stick out on the Iron Gym for the latter move).  The bicep exercises really work you big time.  Some of the moves include lawn mowers, reverse grip bent over rows, congdon locomotive, crouching cohen curls, and hammer curls.  There is one exercise that requires a chair (seated, bent-over back flys) and, for variety, one move that does not require any equipment at all (superman).  The last move is strip set curls where you line up or switch out 4 sets of weights and do 8 curls with the heaviest first, then drop 2 1/2 or 5 lbs for 8 more reps and continue two more times.  Whew!  That exercise is a killer!

I am a female P90xer and keep records of all the exercises (the weight I used and how many reps).  On some of the moves I've doubled the weight since the first time I did them.  This workout always flies by for me.  It includes Ab Ripper X which has 11 different ab/core situps from a seated position.  They are not just crunches but work the entire core.  I could not pop up and touch my toes on the ""Cross Leg/Wide Leg Sit-ups"" or the ""V-Up/Roll-Up Combos,"" I could only do a crunch.  I kept trying and, I think it was my 11th time doing the workout that I was able to pop up and complete the move. I've been doing them ever since with no problem which shows that it can strengthen the core muscles if you work them as hard as you can even if you can't finish the moves at first (that goes for pull-ups as well).  This workout works!  I've done it so many times I don't even play the DVD anymore, I put on a CD and do each move in sequence on my own.  It stills wears me out and I still collapse after 50 mason twists!",1258416000,,2438,4.3215859030837
