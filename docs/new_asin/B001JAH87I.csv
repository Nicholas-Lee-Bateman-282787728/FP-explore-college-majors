8312415,2,B001JAH87I,"Don't spend your money on this.  This DVD is a copy of a 1981 (not 2008) Coronet Instructional Media Film and is 12 minutes long.  It will show you a candle burning and tell you that the 1/2 life of carbon is 5,700 years, Potassium 40 is 1.3 billion years and Uranium 238 4.5 billion years (it is actually 4.468 billion years).  Potassium 40 and Uranium 238 are found in igneous rock and carbon 14 in remains of once living things. Newer information gives the carbon 14 half life at 5,730 (+- 40 years). The reliability factor is never mentioned about how much a date can be off.  Information on this DVD is outdated, very simplistic, and poorly presented.  I bought ""Fossils: Uncovering Clues to the Past"" at the same time I bought this DVD, and it is just as bad.  Out of the 250 science DVDs I own, these are the two worst.  I'll update this review with a decent referral when I find one.",1290470400,,891,4.331325301204819
