8284974,4,B001BWD6YS,This DVD is a 30 minute lecture on specific methods for keeping a positive mental attitude and avoiding depression when working hard or during difficult times in life. It is well-done and very useful. The length is just right; it covers the information without being boring or long-winded. I give it four stars instead of five because it is not as visually appealing as one might hope; mostly we get to see Tom speaking and waving his hands. Better visuals and more music would have made a more captivating and enjoyable presentation.,1220486400,,534,4.815217391304348
