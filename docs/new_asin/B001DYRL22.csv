3543702,2,B001DYRL22,"This season, Film Movement international independent movie makers seem to be exploring what it means to be a teenager and different.  What is different about Ben is that he is suffering from Ausberger syndrom.  This is form of autism where person cannot relate to his social surroundings.  Being that high school is painful enough for ""normal"" kids, Ben's hypersensitivity is making him more vulnerable.  His teachers and family, handful of school friends are trying to make it easy on him.  But Ben's only escape from the harsh reality is playing video games.  Ben has built his own reality around the music, video games and his own internal mind.  Interesting exploration of the mind that works differently than most, but not strong enough to convince anyone on how people like Ben make it in the real world as somewhat functioning adults.  Ben is intelligent, physically healthy, just socially inadequate - he has no feelings but can only mimic them from observing others.  What type of profession and independent adult life this leaves for him and people who truly care about him?  These questions remain unanswered, and that is why only two starts for this month's film.",1223942400,2,1175,4.97948717948718

3543705,5,B001DYRL22,"As the parent and step parent of two boys who have Asperger's Syndrome, I can say on pretty good authority that this film does a very good job of giving the audience an accurate sensory experience of what it's like to be on the autism spectrum. The loud unrelenting noises that you can't filter, the visual focus on teeny tiny details, the literal interpretation of speech. The way above average sharpness of the intellect. And how it feels to always be the outsider. Excluded. Misunderstood. Shamed. Ridiculed. This film takes you on a very special journey. It's not an easy journey, it's not always pretty, and it's not always a happy result. But it's an important journey for neural-normal people to walk for 100 minutes in neural atypical people's shoes. Films like this one will never be blockbusters or make the director rich, but they can help the rest of us find our humanity.",1332201600,,884,4.746753246753247
3543706,3,B001DYRL22,"A Belgium story of a mental man-among-teens (or all they are the same-it is hard to understand as actors look too mature for school folks?) incorporates interesting ideas of a virtual space as a new living demention of the new millennium and a degree of idiocy oncoming generations should acquire to be modern citizens.

3543707,5,B001DYRL22,"If you or someone you know is dealing with Aspergers or just autism - understanding, bullying, suicide - this should be required viewing!  A fairly edgy and dark movie, it shows just what we autistics must endure from people - the stress, failure in communication - and where it can push us.  It also shows how you can be creative in finding the way out.  This movie brings me to deep tears recalling many of my horrible past experiences but lights a fire under me that forces me to go on and win in the end.  I can't say enough!  Buy it!  Watch it!  This is an incredible movie!",1318377600,4,579,4.256880733944954
3543708,4,B001DYRL22,"A study of a tortured teen with Asperberger's syndrome, Ben is bullied and mistreated
by his peers, and since his divorced parents are pretty clueless, he retreats into an on
line role-playing fantasy game, where he has won the heart of a female player.

Greg Timmerman is is excellent in the lead, but also looks a little old for the role,
which takes something away from the reality, and heartbreak of the film.
Most of the supporting performances are very good as well.

The film captures the trauma of adolescence, honestly and brutally.

 (possible mild semi-spoiler ahead!)

But the documentary like interviews are ultimately setting us up for a twist ending that
is weirdly satisfying but also a huge cheat and let down at the same time. It feels good,
but makes all the raw emotion of the film up to that point feel a bit copped out on.

None-the-less, there is some very inventive filmmaking here, and the film is rarely less
than riveting. It just seems that, sadly, it adds up to a bit less than the sum of its parts.",1316995200,,1028,4.590163934426229
3543709,4,B001DYRL22,"Then there's the big surprise movie you never heard of. Know nothing about. Never showed up on your radar, but when you watch it it nails your head to the wall it's so good. ""Ben X"" is such a movie. It gets everything (well....almost everything) right, and it's a great watch.

Here's the scoop. Ben is a very bright high school student. He's one of the smartest in his class, but he's autistic. He took a lot of grief all through grade school and it's not letting up in high school. Many of his classmates taunt him relentlessly. He does have a couple of fellow students and teachers who empathize with him but they're ineffectual. They cannot stop the things that are happening to him. To find refuge he hides out in an on-line video game where he scores mega points and comes to the attention of another, female, player who wants to meet him in the flesh. Things are arranged and lead to a rather peculiar outcome.

This is a great movie. The way Ben's autism is captured is remarkable. The way people talk to him and the way he sees/ hears what they're saying to him are wildly different. His mother loves him and cares for him deeply, but she just doesn't get it. Mom and dad are divorced. His dad loves him. Dad's new wife seems to care about him as well, but, like mom, they are of no help to him. When he goes to rendesvous with his game playing pal, it's almost painful to see him in his inability to approach her. The director did an outstanding job of showing us Ben's world.

This has a good look to it and the performances are all top shelf. The only reason I'm not giving this the big five stars is the ending. If I were one of the characters sitting where I was sitting and saw what I saw, I might not have reacted the way they all reacted. And what were they saying about his gal pal? I won't spoil anything but you might end up scratching your head. This is still a great movie. It IS Swedish with sub-titles, so factor that into your decision to see it. It IS based on true story (whatever that means)and it IS a great watch. Dig it.",1316390400,,2051,4.253846153846154
3543710,4,B001DYRL22,"A few months ago I started watching movies released in Film Movement's continuing library of foreign and indie movies, and I happen to pick this one up recently.

""Ben X"" (93 min,; originaly released in Belgium in 2007) brings the story of a high school teenager who gets bullied relentlessly by his classmates for being 'different' (later it is revealed that Ben has autism, specifically Asperger Syndrome). Ben finds solace by playing on-line gamaes, in which his avatar is Ben X, a strong and confident hero. After a dramatic incident at school that is later posted on the internet, Ben is so humiliated that he is contemplating taking his own life. You'll have to see it for yourself how it all pays out.

I thought this was a terrific movie, even if several bullying scenes are incredibly hard to watch. But the interplay between the real world and the on-line gaming world is done very cleverly and visually rich. Outstanding performances by Greg Timmermans as Ben and Marijke Pinoy as his mom. Being from Belgium (Flanders, specifically), I admit to feeling a certain amount of pride that someone in Flanders was able to make a thoroughly original and emotionally hard-hitting movie. Highly recommended!",1296950400,2,1210,4.955665024630542
3543711,5,B001DYRL22,"The films centers around a teenager with autism (Asperger Syndrome to be more specific) that has to fight his extraordinary life in order to fit socially I an ordinary world, beyond autism, themes such as school bullying, and violence as well as suicide, and social reactions to underdogs are covered in this beautifully crafted cinematic story.  This is one of those oddly feel good films that will leave you entertained, but also with a plenty of ideas about life , existence , and the way we as human interact with each others , to reflect upon. I believe every parent show introduce their adolescent children to this film at their on discretion, in a way to help them reflect on how to be better social individuals.",1283644800,2,719,4.7063492063492065
3543712,2,B001DYRL22,"I think that the concept of retreating into a fantasy life is not
ego-alien to most people at some point, as it imbues one with special
abilities and allows a much more rigid control over what happens in our
lives. I'm guessing this may echo more true in the case of people who,
for whatever reason, have less sophisticated social skills and feel
threatened by the sometimes daunting task of adapting to this
nihilistic postpostmodern world. Now the concept of creating a
crystallization of this fantasy life in everyday situations is somewhat
plausible, albeit not so much unless we delve into the world of
psychosis. Ben seems to first imagine his virtual girlfriend as
personified after he takes the pill the bullies feed to him (I'm
assuming it was some sort of amphetamine), shifting the paradigm along
the lines of substance-induced psychotic disorder, with lingering
effects up until the end of the film (even though his mother dismisses
the potential severity of the psychic process brewing - after all,
psychosis is neurotoxic, so to speak). She is much more concerned with
the overarching social adaptation in a sadistic world than achieving
any real resolution to underlying causal issues. Technically, the film
was visually appealing, the insertion of video game images rendered
more palpable the idea of associative thinking that goes on in
everyone's minds, you don't have to be on the autistic spectrum to fit
into that mold. I didn't love the actor's performance, the build-up was
reasonably OK, I didn't expect the twist, and yet it wasn't terribly
fulfilling nor incredibly realistic that he wouldn't be vilified
horrifically (more so) after staging such a farce. Anyway, the bottom
line is that the story, in the end, is one of hopelessness, seen as how
he was able to ""win"" the battle against his persecutors, and yet his
ego defenses were so clearly feeble, and the external environment so
threatening, that his only choice was to spiral into a psychotic world,
so comforting and maladaptive that there may be no way out.",1281657600,,2042,4.991202346041056
3543713,4,B001DYRL22,"My son's therapist suggest watching this movie.  It was difficult to watch at times because of the intense bullying; however, it was necessary to watch as my son also has Asperger's.  It was a well done movie and the story was great.  It brings to light some real concerns about the treatment of Asperger's.  Ben, in my opinion, had a lack of treatment and a lack of medical support.",1267401600,,383,4.507246376811594
3543714,3,B001DYRL22,"This review is for people who've already watched the movie.

Ben X is the story of a 35 year-old who's still in high school for some reason, being tormented by Flemish versions of Beavis and Butthead.  I dug the video game world as a contrast to his unpleasant life and I also thought the director used color in an interesting way, like when Scarlite (even the name suggests the director had color on his mind) is bright red against a wall of desaturated green.  The lead actor bugged, though.  He was too old and everytime he started bugging his eyes out I thought ""welp, it's scenery-chewing time at the Apollo's amateur hour"".  The trick ending was cool but I could see it coming a mile away--what parent helps their kid commit suicide?  And though I predicted the ending it was at least different, which I appreciated.

Another thing that bugged me was the ""based on a true story"" label.  Man, what a cynical trick that label is.  The actual story this was supposed based on was a kid with autism who killed himself.  Movie studios and directors slap that label on because audiences want to think there's reality to their movies and movie studios are only too happy to oblige.

Despite its flaws, a well-made movie.",1262649600,,1219,4.597222222222222
3543715,5,B001DYRL22,"What makes a ""film"" a great film?  Many things but mostly the writing, acting directing, cinematography, not in this particular order, but altogether.  BEN X is a GREAT film, it is a roller coaster of emotions, it is a constant surprise.  It will take you places you never dreamed of going.  It explores many different subjects and will leave you wanting to tell all your friends to buy or rent BEN X.  I did.  It stands out very tall from thousands of movies made in 2008, and it is more than just about autism. It is about a different person who overcomes his fears and revenge in a very clever way.  When will humanity realize that every creature on earth is special and OK?  When will we learn to accept and tolerate each other for our differences? I can't recommend it enough. Just get it.",1253664000,,794,4.427586206896552

3543717,1,B001DYRL22,"Altho I enjoyed the twist ending and it's great to call attention to the very real problem of bullying faced by students with Asperger's, it seemed as though the people who made this film had never met anyone with Asperger's.

3543718,4,B001DYRL22,I believe this was a good movie for any who like a movie with a good story. I personally had a friend who's brother was autistic and so I actually could understand a lot of Ben's actions and attitudes. I really found it almost educating about the way some people deal with someone like that. All in all I really enjoyed this movie.,1243036800,,331,4.26984126984127
3543719,4,B001DYRL22,"Ben is a deeply disturbed teenager with severe Asbergers Syndrome: ""There was always something wrong with me,"" he says. He's a loner in the real world who loses himself as a gamer in the online virtual world. His teachers are empathetic but stymied. Doctors have their theories but offer no practical help. Ben's distraught parents are beside themselves. Much of the film is about the harassment and humiliation Ben receives at school. When one of these despicable episodes is filmed with a cell phone and uploaded to the internet, Ben plots his ""endgame."" His online virtual friend, a young girl named Scarlite, insists upon helping him as his ""healer."" And so they meet in real life and devise their revenge. ""Every night you pray to God that things will work out and be OK,"" laments his father. The improbable end of this film suggests that Ben's ""problem"" is not so much a problem for him, but a problem for and even caused by others who won't accept him for who he is. ""BenX"" was Belgium's entry for best foreign film at the 2008 Academy Awards. In Flemish with English subtitles.",1242345600,2,1085,4.71578947368421

And for those of you who have never heard of autism, don't worry, there are creative ""inserts"" of information right where it's helpful.  Not only that but the experiences of these characters really wake you up and are engaging.  This is not just a flick for people trying to understand the experiences autism.

8295507,5,B001DYRL22,"An absolute masterpiece. I am autistic/Aspergers and this movie captures the inside of the mind of someone with these mental differences. It may seem a little highschoolish at first but it works its way into a beautiful expose on living inside a mind that others view as broken. Very emotional and extremely well shot.
I truly recommend this to every high school as a required video, because it tackles both mental disorder and bullying all in one. If you are a teacher of film or English then I implore you to make this a required film. Please watch it first to ensure you agree, though I am fairly certain you will. I feel this film would help to curb bullying at school as it shows the consequences to the person being bullied instead of threatening the bullies themselves.",1413676800,,776,4.630434782608695

8295509,4,B001DYRL22,"Good movie. Good acting. The basic story is about a teenage boy with Asperger's syndrome is ruthlessly picked on by evil jerks and lame followers in his high school. The boy is able to escape from the cruel world by playing an on-line video game which is in the vein of World of Warcraft.  On-line he is heroic and he has a real life girl who is his on-line companion. In the real world the teasing becomes torture and public humiliation and his carefully constructed coping skills start to fail. But, because of the glimmer of self-esteem he has been able to get from his on-line persona,the implied support of the on-line girlfriend, and the love and support of his family he tries to find a way out of his situation. It is a really weird way to deal with his situation, but effective.
Among the topics the movie brings are; should kids as socially vulnerable as this guy be forced to stay in regular schools and deal with the potentially tragic consequences? and, is the on-line fantasy world that mmorpgs provide for socially inept people primarily good (when used within reason) because they help bolster self-esteem? or primarily bad because they are ultimately vapid time toilets, and the relationships forged are not transferable to the real world? and, well, the last questions are about suicide which you can ask yourself if you watch the movie.",1374451200,2,1355,4.741525423728813
