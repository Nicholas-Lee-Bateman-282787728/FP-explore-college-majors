4833929,1,B005M2A4E8,"This dvd was a major disappointment! The sound seems to go up and down with each scene and as a previous reviewer pointed out the music is not the same as the original airing. The quality gave this dvd the feel of a bootleg it didn't seem to be as clear as the HBO version. A major disappointment considering how great this was when it aired on tv, but unfortunately if you really enjoyed this ,as I did, then you are stuck buying it.",1324771200,7,434,4.178571428571429
4833930,2,B005M2A4E8,"First of all: DO NOT buy from HBO. I pre-ordered this and it still did not get here until the 17th. And I made the mistake of paying extra for faster shipping. Fail.

Secondly: the DVD is different from the original airing on HBO. All of the bands whose music was featured in 24/7 have been cut out and replaced with generic instrumentation. I realize that for some, it probably won't make a difference but it really bothered me. The music of bands like The xx and Band of Horses coupled with the beautifully shot montages was what really elevated this documentary to another level and separated it from everything else we've seen about hockey. Anyway, like I said, some won't be bothered by this but I felt it significantly changed the feel from cinematic to average. Really disappointed with that.

No extras, either. Clearly that would've been nice, as fans.

Bottom line: If you are a Caps or a Pens fan you will probably still want to own this. But just be warned: no blu-ray, all the good music has been removed and replaced, no extras to speak of.",1324252800,38,1054,4.536842105263158
4833931,5,B005M2A4E8,"Couldn't wait for this to come out ever since it was not available on HBO Demand anymore. Pre-ordered it and received it on the first day it was out, super excited to watch. Truly amazing job by HBO. Fully captured the emotional intensity of the sport and the rivalry between the two teams, as well as everything that goes on behind the scenes. I am a huge Caps fan so of course it made it even better that we won the Winter Classic, but either way a very quality series.",1323734400,,471,4.2444444444444445
4833932,5,B005M2A4E8,"Love hockey, love HBO, love 24/7.  That being said I am from Minnesota, and I am a Wild fan.  I can only hope, wish and cross my fingers that someday we are in the winter classic and we get a 24/7 special!!!  I bought this on DVD and the picture quality is very good for a DVD.(watched on ps3, used to blu rays) Please HBO if you read this release in BLU RAY!! I would buy another copy on Blu for sure.  Player interviews, behind the scenes footage, music, montages are all done to perfection.  The only thing i would want is more episodes!!!! I cant get enough.  Cant wait for 12.14 the new 24/7 Rangers Flyers!  Bottom line, if you like hockey, 24/7, or sports in general, you need this DVD.

DVD case is nothing special.  The package does not live up to HBO's typical boxes that are always top notch.  But this is not to take away from the product at all.  Just saying.

PS HBO please release on BLU RAY would love to watch this in HD!
PPS HBO please release all seasons of Hard Knocks on BLU RAY and all 24/7 boxing on BLU RAY!",1323561600,,1031,4.125628140703518
4833933,5,B005M2A4E8,"Simply the best sports documentary I've ever seen.  The 4 hours (4 1-hour episodes) flies right by.  Even if you're not a hockey fan, you will be engrossed.  Filmed during December 2010 during the weeks approaching the New Years Day Winter Classic matchup between the Washington Capitals and the Stinksburgh Penguins.  The Caps beat the Pens like a drum in the Winter Classic.  Watching Crosby get wiped out by Steckel is beautiful.  The Caps were struggling during December 2010 and after the Winter Classic, the Caps somehow wound up with the best record in the Eastern Conference.  Both teams lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the playoffs.  The Caps just fired Bruce Boudreau and Dale Hunter will lead them to glory!

GO CAPS GO!!!!
GO CAPS GO!!!!",1323475200,2,752,4.8125
4833934,5,B005M2A4E8,"Michael Rubino, DVD Verdict --The Winter Classic has become the marquee event of the National Hockey League. Sure the Stanley Cup isn't on the line, but the pomp, circumstance, and commercialism surrounding it has grown exponentially since the first outdoor game on New Year's Day in Buffalo back in 2008. It's hockey's Wrestlemania.

Last year's Winter Classic, between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals, was the perfect subject for HBO Sports's award-winning documentary series. 24/7 Penguins/Capitals: Road to the Winter Classic is an exhaustive, thrilling, and beautiful look into both the makings of an outdoor spectacle and the human element behind one of the league's biggest rivalries. Calmly narrated by Liev Schreiber (X-Men Origins: Wolverine), the four-part series only covers a few weeks of a lengthy season, but it captures the essence of professional hockey perfectly.

It helps that the Pens and Caps provide a narrative that doesn't need embellishment. The two teams couldn't be more different: at the start of the series, the Penguins are on the top of their conference, and in the middle of a lengthy winning streak. The team's captain and face of the NHL, Sidney Crosby (Sidney Crosby: On The Ice And Beyond), is having a career-high point streak. These flightless birds, led by the steady coaching of Dan Bylsma, are soaring in the first half of their season. The Capitals, however, are tanking. After a stretch of losses, morale is at an all-time low. Alex Ovechkin, the Russian superstar and captain, can't seem to motivate his team to victory. Not helping matters is the oft frazzled and foul-mouthed coach, Bruce Boudreau, whose coaching style isn't quite as inspirational as Kurt Russell in Miracle. The documentary compares and contrasts these two organizations on every level, from goons to general managers, while maintaining enough objectivity to be enjoyed by fans of either team.

Moreso than the athletes, 24/7 is defined by its style. Better than anything the NHL has produced on its own, HBO Sports has given hockey a level of professionalism and drama usually reserved for those NFL Films specials with John Facenda. The use of shallow focus techniques, slow motion, and obtuse camera angles gives the miniseries a film quality. Edited by Dan Marks and Tim Mullen, the documentary has a brisk pace that skates from game to game, making sure to take a breather with personal interest stories and injury reports. With so much going on, and the team's schedule just as fast as the games themselves, this series deserved the Emmy it won for editing.

Unfortunately, for such a compelling and powerful sports doc, this release is only available on standard def. Filmed largely with digital HD cameras, the picture is vibrant and sharp--especially during game footage, and those beautiful establishing shots of Pittsburgh. But for a sport that has benefited greatly from 720p television broadcasts, it's a shame that HBO couldn't do more than an SD release. It's not such an issue with the stereo mix, which is more than serviceable--the series is outfitted with an excellent soundtrack. Don't expect any cool special features either; this disc is shutout. Wishing this were on Blu-ray doesn't make this release any less a must-own for Pittsburgh and Washington fans alike.

24/7 Penguins/Capitals: Road to the Winter Classic eloquently offers a glimpse of the halfway point through a brutal hockey season. The 2010 Winter Classic wasn't the best game the Pens and Caps have played, but HBO couldn't control that. Instead, all they could do was try to freeze these two teams for just a moment. Weeks before this DVD hit the shelves, Crosby returned to the game of hockey after recovering from a concussion suffered at the Classic. Just a day before this DVD's release, the Capitals fired Boudreau. Already, these two teams have grown and progressed past what is here. The essence of who they are, and the game they play, however, can't be represented any better than this.

4833935,5,B005M2A4E8,"What an exciting, atmospheric look behind the scenes with my favorite team!  It's beautifully shot, edited, narrated and scored.  So much so, I don't think you need to be a fan of either team or even hockey to find it compelling.

We fans know the on-ice personalities pretty well, but this documentary series really gives you a deeper look as well as a taste of their lives off the ice, the fun they have and the tribulations, too.  I didn't think I could love the Pens more, but 24/7 made me do just that.  Actually, getting to see more of the quality people that make up the Penguins organization made me do that.

Don't order this from the network that made it!  They waited two weeks to tell me that my pre-ordered dvd would be shipped three weeks later than promised.  Not a huge deal at any other time of the year, but a real problem right before Christmas.  A simple notification would have been nice as would more helpful customer service.  It's okay, though, since I got a lower price and faster shipping here on Amazon!",1322697600,2,1030,4.459893048128342
4833936,5,B005M2A4E8,"This was an amazing series, the color saturation and mic'ed up game footage was superb. The best part about this is the behind the scenes footage. I learned so much about my team, the Pens. How they are coached, the GM and Coach interactions, the coach and his assistant coaches, how they interact at home, how they interact on the plane, pranks, personalities, all beautifully shot in crystal clear images. One of the most moving moments obviously is Ben Lovejoy's hat trick: the goal, the assist and the puck to the face. He's so proud of his gameplay and winning the player of the game trophy the Pens give out. His first goal is something to tell his kids about, it brought me to tears. At the end of the year Coach Bylsma won the Jack Adams award, you'll see why when you watch this series. Lets Go Pens!",1321488000,13,809,4.436241610738255

4833940,5,B005M2A4E8,"I never saw the original HBO showing, so I can't say how many changes there have been, but I still thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.

The cinematography is still excellent, as is the narration, and getting to see into the lives and minds of these coaches and players is worth it. Especially since I, for one, can't find the full series anywhere else.",1388620800,,345,4.564516129032258
4833941,5,B005M2A4E8,"I watched every episode as it was aired on tv. I had to buy this dvd because it is a great inside look at what the coaches, players, and their families go through. I was able to attend the Winter Classic Alumni Game at Heinz Field and get autographs from players, past and present. It was an amazing time! This dvd sparks those memories and reminds me of how great it is to have such great people representing The Burgh! Thank you for all that you do! Wooooo!

4833943,4,B005M2A4E8,"I saw this somewhere else before and I really enjoyed it considering i'm a Penguins fan. The Capitals aren't my favorite team but not my least favorite team. So, I enjoyed the behind the scenes for both of the teams. Episode 1 really isin't that interesting because it only talks about how the teams are doing. Episode 2 is alot better because it shows both of the teams traveling to the Winter Classic. Overall, it wasn't as good as the original HBO version but you don't really have another choice :)",1369180800,,502,4.527472527472527

4833946,5,B005M2A4E8,"As a Pittsburgh Penguins fan, I really enjoyed this film. However, if I were a Capitals fan, I'd be a little offended that they're shown in such a terrible fashion. Granted if a team is on a losing streak, there's not much you can do to make them look great, but it seems like HBO made the Caps look even worse.

I did enjoy getting to see the locker room and off-ice scenes of both teams' players. It was an interesting insight to how the players live, as most people only get to see them in the 60 minutes they play. It'd be nice to see more films like this, going behind the scenes of different teams.",1361664000,,604,4.162393162393163

4833951,5,B005M2A4E8,"Loved watching this series on TV, and I was so glad that HBO finally released it to be enjoyed on DVD!  The series is very well-done, showing all sides of the sport and the making of the Winter Classic event.  Unbiased as far as the teams, and gives you a great up-close-and-personal experience of select players' lives.  Great video and audio quality, and the in-game shots and storytelling are second to none.  Highly recommended if you are a hockey fan!",1353196800,,456,4.6625

4833956,5,B005M2A4E8,"As a hockey fan but never a player, I always wondered what happened behind the scenes; I wanted the experience that I couldn't get just by watching the games on TV. I have to say, this series delivers all of that in a big way. I watched this when it originally aired on HBO and was so entranced that I had to purchase it once it came out on DVD.

The series gives great insight to how the Penguins and Capitals prepare for the Winter Classic, from the various practices, off-days, travel days and games leading up to the big game. You get to learn more about the players on both sides and how they deal with wins and losses as well as the increased media attention that comes with playing in a high-profile national game.

My favorite parts of the series were when we got to hear what the players are saying on ice and in the locker room. It was almost like the NFL Films crew had shown up and turned their mikes on the hockey world. It's certainly not PG, but I doubt anyone would have expected it to have been. What it is, however, is oftentimes hilarious and very telling about the lives that these guys lead, the pride they have in their sport, their cities, their teams and their individual talents.

It's a truly inspiring look into the world of a sport that doesn't get the credit and attention that it deserves. The only negative I can come up with is that it isn't longer. I wish they would make the series longer than the few weeks that it is. I think that would be even more informative and entertaining.",1330905600,,1515,4.3087719298245615
4833957,5,B005M2A4E8,Absolutely loved this DVD. It's longer than the noted 40 min. It's actually 4 40 min episodes!!! Great buy for nay Pens fan. A little heavier on the Pens coverage than Capitals.,1329177600,,177,4.5625

4833960,3,B005M2A4E8,"Well if your a caps/penns fan you will want this in your collection as a piece of history. There are no added features that i could find, which was a bit of disappointment. It literally is just the episodes that were aired on HBO. It is nice to see them all in once place though. This dvd was 20 bucks at the verizon center in DC. I was pleased to find it on Amazon for around 10!",1327968000,,380,3.948051948051948
4833961,5,B005M2A4E8,"An expertly-shot documentary series, executed as only HBO can. Liev Schreiber lends strong voice talent as he narrates the series. If you are a hockey fan, regardless of your team affiliation, this is an excellent behind-the-boards look at the inner workings of two NHL operations - from game-time to family-time - this series covers it all. Hockey is unlike any other sport on Earth, and this serves as proof of that concept.

We watched this series on HBO last year - in  fact, my wife and I were unwittingly captured during a Capitals practice, and ended up on the DVD (better than any ""extra feature"" on any other DVD that I own).

As is the case in any professional sports environment, there is a healthy dose of profanity surrounding ice-time, so it's less than appropriate for the young ones.",1326931200,,799,4.733812949640288
