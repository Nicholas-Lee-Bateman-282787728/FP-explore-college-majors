8097686,1,B000CCZR8G,"Most jet enthusiasts  don't want to hear the music,they want the sounds of the jets only. He music isn't nessary.. Very distracting. PLEASE FIX FOR THE TRUE ENTHUSIASTS",1434758400,,168,5.0
8097687,5,B000CCZR8G,Brought this for my uncle because he really wanted one after seeing his friend collection. Arrive right on time and he really loved it watch it every other night.,1361059200,,162,4.620689655172414
8097688,5,B000CCZR8G,"I am not an aircraft buff nor a military buff, but I found this 5-disc set to be a very valuable addition to my collection. Each disc has a brief, minor introductory commentary, but you can use the Skip function on your remote to avoid that if you wish; I appreciate the near-total absence of commentary.  The soundtrack provides  pleasant background music plus dynamic sounds of the planes in action; the video provides me with an informative insight on aircraft/military behind-the-scenes activities that I have never before observed.  I can divide my time between watching & listening to these discs and, simultaneously, newspaper reading or painting, for instance.

I am way more enthusiastic about the Sky Wars series than the other three reviews in 2006 and 2009.  The prices are now very, very low and you owe it to yourself to enjoy the Sky Wars experience!",1345075200,,865,4.897260273972603
8097689,5,B000CCZR8G,As already said in another review there is no commentary on this so if your looking for info this isn't the DVD for you but if you already know alot about planes then this is a must buy. It has several hours of great footage for all different planes and is sure not to disappoint anyone who likes them.,1248480000,2,302,4.135593220338983
8097690,3,B000CCZR8G,The picture for the transports aircraft's cd is good for the other cd some secene is good some secene is poor .,1236988800,,111,4.090909090909091
8097691,3,B000CCZR8G,"If you know about most of these planes already, the mainstays of the US military, then this is great. There is no commentary so for those looking for an informative DVD set this is not it. It is just 7.5 hours of footage (good footage!) of these planes and helicopters flying around, landing, and taking off. For someone like myself who knows a decent amount already, i'm okay without the commentary...but it would be frustrating for those who want to know what they're looking at. With 5 discs and 7.5 hours, for 10-15 bucks its a pretty good deal.",1159574400,7,549,4.555555555555555
