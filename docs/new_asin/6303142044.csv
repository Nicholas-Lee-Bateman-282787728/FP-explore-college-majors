I HAVE IDOLIZED JACKIE FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY LIFE AND WILL CONTINUE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.  THE REASON FOR ACTUALLY WRITING THIS  REVEIW IS RESPONSE TO THE REVEIWER ""A REVEIWER TOLEDO, OHIO"" IF  THIS PERSON WAS A TRUE JACKIE FAN THEY WOULD ATLEAST SPELL HER NAME RIGHT.  SHE DID NOT LIKE BE CALLED JACLYN, IT IS JACQUELINE, AND SHE WAS ONLY  REFERRED TO AS JACKIE BECAUSE HER FATHER CALLED HER THAT AS A CHILD EVEN  THOUGH HER MOTHER DID NOT APPROVE.  THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVIEW.  KRISSIE, WAYNE,WV",952819200,6,594,4.376146788990826
7840087,4,6303142044,"This is a very well done movie about Jackie Kennedy from her childhood through her entry into the publishing world in her later years.  Roma Downey looks the part and certainly has the voice down pretty perfectly but it is very much a one dimensional portrayal.  In an earlier scene her father tells her that she should never let anyone know what she feels about anything and Ms Downey certainly took this advice to heart.  Her voice never changes, her expression rarely changes and then not much.  It is still a very enjoyable version of the Kennedy story though the much later 6 part series was far better in my opinion.",1512086400,,622,4.576576576576577

7840090,5,6303142044,"So glad I have a multi region DVD player. This is the movie that sparked my interest in Jackie 25 years ago! This is the first Jackie movie I had ever seen and though it's now, not my favorite (due in part to the historical inaccuracies that were filmed for it) it still holds a special place in my Jackie movie collection! The acting wasn't too bad though and you get to see a young Sarah Michelle Gellar portray a teenaged Jackie.",1459468800,,432,4.280487804878049
7840091,5,6303142044,"In my opinion this is the best Jackie Kennedy movie I've ever seen.
I bought this as a gift for a Jackie Kennedy fan and she was so
happy with it.",1370908800,,146,3.7419354838709675
7840092,5,6303142044,"This is a very classy and a great looking production, on the life of Jackie Kennedy Onassis. And of all the people who were around her, Including the whole of the kennedy clan. [CAMLOT] The actress who played Jackie did look very much like her, and the actor who played her brother in law Edward, did look rather like him too. But every other person in the movie looked nothing like the characters that they were portraying. You will thoughly enjoy watching this beautiful movie. It takes you through from Jackies privileged life as a little girl. Then her meeting the President, and her NOT so wonderful marriage to him. As Marilyn Monroe was also in this marriage, as well as a few other floosies, [So this miniseries shows us] Then on to her marriage with Onassis. The episodes are....THE BOUVIER YEARS.....THE KENNEDY YEARS.....THE ONASSIS YEARS. Plus, also included in this package is a special BONUS DVD Documentary DISC. The title is... JFK, IN HIS OWN WORDS. It will also arrive for you, in a very flash DVD Case.",1356739200,2,1021,4.709497206703911
7840093,5,6303142044,"This Movie is the best tv movie ever, as far as I'm concerned. Roma Downy's best performance ever. She's a great actress, this tops all of her work as an artist. All the actors/actress in this movie gave an outstanding depiction of Jack, Jackie and Onassis life. I never get tired of watching this movie.",1259193600,2,304,4.545454545454546
7840094,5,6303142044,"I've seen quite a few movies about Jackie Kennedy, and I believe this one is the most realistic. I've also read a ton of books about Jackie, so really appreciated the attention to detail and historical facts. A great purchase!",1257552000,4,226,4.675
7840095,5,6303142044,"I Don't want to discuss about this movie. all I can say is, it's one of the best movie's of it's kind I've ever seen and really worth to have even on VHS tape. but the question here is :

I have DVD edition of this movie. It's a Dual-layer DVD, Machine made, not a copy, with excellent cover art and on DVD print. It's 270 minutes, English removable subtitles, with real DVD quality and DD 1.0 channel audio track. It consists of two parts. Before the terror of Kennedy and after it. Menu is not that primitive but indicates that it modified from a double sided DVD into a dual layer cause in main menu, you have to choose between ""Disc 1"" & ""Disc 2"" botton to access to each part's menu. on the cover art has been printed ""Printed in U.S.A."", It's NTSC but region free but It's not seem to be an import or bootleg cause it's overall quality is excellent! I received it as a gift, 2 years ago and when I came to amazon to order another as a gift to one of my friends, I surprisingly found out that there is no DVD edition! now I'll be pleased if anybody inform me about my DVD and it's origins!",1119571200,,1094,4.11214953271028
7840096,4,6303142044,"Although it is both hillarious and inidicative of his acting range to see Stephen Colins (who really is a licenced minister) play JFK, I was also impressed by Roma Downey's acting in this film. There are so many other big names involved in the production and acting that I would not know where to start.
Jaqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was not as perfect as she had to appear in the media, but was human like the rest of us. I had seen numerous specials on the Kennedys before, but (like the book of the same name) felt that both the positive and negative aspects of her character were covered in a fair manner.
Both in the book and this movie, I sensed that Jaqueline's frustration came less from her husband's daliances (after all, she was rumored to have several of her own)than from the fact that society expected her to behave like the prim and proper hausfrau more epitomized in her mother-in-law Rose. Jaqueline had much greater ambitions for herself as dramatized in the storyline.
Jaqueline revisited is a liberating figure because she is able to transcend these barriers while looking the part of the quintesential wife. To JFK's credit, he appears to have accepted it more than many other men of his generation. The fact that JFK grew unparalled closeness to her right before his infamous assaination is especially tearjerking.
One thing that I did not care for was the usage of the questionable Max Jacobsen. While this also proves just how prophetic the presidential couple were with their social behavior, it is also chilling at times. To think that two highly educated people would asociate with a shady character is downright scary.",979516800,5,1650,4.813380281690141
