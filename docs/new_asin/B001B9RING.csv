Before I watched this DVD I had a lot of misconceptions about knife-fighting. I wrongly assumed that your first objective in defending would be to disarm the weapon. I now understand that this is actually the LAST objective as there are three things you MUST do before you attempt to disarm the weapon. If you do not your attempt to disarm could very easily fail and you will likely be stabbed or seriously wounded perhaps fatally.

The four Knife-Defense principles Franco teaches us in this DVD are 1. Clear target from the knife 2. Control the weapon 3. Neutralize the attacker and only then do you 4. disarm the weapon. When you watch the mock knife attack shown where Anthony attacks Tim as realistically and forcefully as he can & with a training blade it becomes immediately obvious that any technique that requires fine motor skills like that of a disarm is going to be next to impossible to perform. An enraged adrenaline-pumped assailant is not going to allow it to happen.

With this in mind Franco lays down the foundation for a successful defensive strategy for one of the most dangerous situations on the street. He takes you step-by-step through each of the four defense principles and shows you precisely what you need to do so you can get out alive. The concepts he teaches are simple enough that I would recommend the DVD to anyone martial artist or not but any serious martial artist who recognizes the danger inherent in a knife attack needs to understand the strategy Franco has developed. I believe you will agree with me that his strategy is logical powerful and will be effective if practiced and executed properly. Five Stars!",1214092800,3,1798,4.759615384615385
