8404069,3,B003S6G8MW,"A pretty nasty film, better than Roth's Hostel and Hostel 2

When I look at any kind of film, I always try to find what
or how a film is different from others, especially the same genre.

Yes, I agree with others who dislike the film ""Experiment in Torture"" (E.I.T)
for some plot/story weaknesses, however, as far as technical nuances go,
I was surprised at the variation of camera techniques, hand-held and fluid shots mix.

The film is better than Eli Roth's films, in that it leaves a fair bit to the
imagination, and doesn't (like Roth does) label or condemn an entire country,
in those cases, Slovakia. Why not say, 'somewhere in the East,' or a 'land not too
far' away?

For this reason, the ""E.I.T"" stands out as leaving the viewer draw their own conclusions
as for WHERE the events in the film take place. In contrast to Pascal Laugier's ""Martyrs,""
(2008) where a woman is skinned to death, leaving all but her face, ""E.I.T,"" invites a
second, even third viewing, in order to get behind what the film is about;

Essentially, its overdrawn characters, the scenes of agony and pain, and seemingly gratuitous
(implied) violence can be seen as a critique of the horror film itself. The viewer has seen
enough of this over the years, and it is time for more intelligent films to be made, since the
horror genre has enough room for new and fresh ideas, stories and talent. If cinema itself is dying,
films like ""Martyrs"" contribute to this sense, and E.I.T invites us to revisit
what is already there and to develop something new.

I would rate the film 3/5 overall.
