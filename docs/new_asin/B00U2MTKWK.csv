8704054,4,B00U2MTKWK,"I now own four Mahler 8 recordings on dvd, and this new one with Paavo Jarvi is the least successful of the four. Yet, this is still a perfectly serviceable account of the work. The other three are Bernstein/Vienna Phil., Riccardo Chailly/Leipzig Gewandhaus and Gustavo Dudamel's truly 'symphony of a thousand' performance from Caracas, Venezuela. The best compromise is the Chailly, but both Bernstein and Dudamel are charismatic performers who bring much to the table.

The Bernstein issue lends direct competition to Paavo Jarvi in that it also contains both the seventh and eighth symphonies. If you're wanting to choose between the two, make your decision based upon which symphony you like more. Jarvi has the better seventh, while Bernstein displays more character in the eighth. He coaxes everyone to perform beyond their abilities, and also has the slightly better cast of vocal soloists (Jarvi's cast is the usual mish-mash of good singers, and not so great singers). Jarvi, on the other hand, is straight forward and efficient in his treatment of the eighth. Yet, his is also not comfortable or 'lived in' enough for a work where one should feel as though they have truly arrived. You get the the feeling that Jarvi might be slightly embarrassed by the sheer scope of Mahler's eighth (on CD both Horenstein and Colin Davis sound fully comfortable with the size and magnitude of Mahler 8, but without sounding too slow in the process). However, there are no such reservations involving Jarvi's performance of the seventh symphony.

Jarvi's Mahler 7 is similar to his father's radical take on the work (Neemi Jarvi on Chandos), but isn't quite so extreme. Rather than treating the symphony as a continuous, through-composed narrative - a narrative which takes us from the dark hell of the sixth symphony and eventually dumps us on the doorstep of ""Veni, Creator Spiritus"" - Paavo Jarvi treats each movement of the seventh as though it were a separate character study. In this regard, his is in the more 'concerto for orchestra' camp of what the seventh is all about. But with generally quick tempos throughout - save the middle passage of the first movement and various parts of the second one - the first four movements serve, in turn, as a sort of prelude to the C major, ""ray of sunshine"" finale. It might not be pretty but it works, as Jarvi treats the finale as a potpourri, hodge-podge, 'everthing but the kitchen sink' symphony on to itself. It's a kaleidoscope of ear candy that delights, fascinates and titillates at every turn and at every juncture. Here, with Jarvi, Mahler truly makes fun of himself and the entire 'turn of the century' aesthetic. Jarvi brings the seventh to an incredible culmination by incorporating a huge volley of deep church bells, tubular chimes and cowbells at the final peroration. If only Jarvi had been nearly so unbuttoned with the ending of the eighth symphony.

Again, I wish to point out that I'm reviewing this release on a plain-old dvd, and can not speak on the visual or audio components of the BluRay issue. I'm perfectly satisfied with both the picture and the sound on the dvd issue, as well as with the camera work employed in both symphonies.

One final note: the 7th was performed at the Kurhaus in Wiebaden - a very fine acoustic - while the eighth took place at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt (the program notes incorrectly identify the venue as being Kloster Eberbach, which would simply be too small for Mahler 8).",1432425600,4,3477,4.848484848484849
