8097402,2,B000CCM6UI,"It doesn't play like the TV game at all.

First of all there is no input into the game (to write).  Therefore there are no strikes.  All of the answers are written down via a dry eraser board.  There are only 5 answers for each category and each team writes down their top five.

Unlike the show there isn't a way to steal the score.  This game is minimally fun and my family is done forever after only playing 2 complete games (which take about 10 minutes each)

This DVD game reminded me of OUTBURST, but not nearly as fun.",1135468800,,525,4.19
