7868260,4,6304293585,What a wack-attack movie.  It was a lot of fun.  Couple of dry spots where we had to remember what we were watching but overall a great movie.  But then we love those old cult classics.  If there are more movies with this nut Dr. Morgus we'd buy them too.,1204329600,,255,4.04
7868261,5,6304293585,"I am probably one of the few people who can say that they saw this film when it was originally released in the late 1950s IN A THEATER! I recommend this film highly because it is a splendid introduction to the way us folks in New Orleans tend not to take ourselves too seriously -- by pretending to take ourselves absolutely, totally seriously! Incidentally, in the new series from the 1980s, I went through the instant people machine myself! Chopsley mixed up the sand. Morgus used a centrifuge to separate the four of us involved. Now we are back to normal. Too bad for the secret agents from Microvania. Anyhow, this film is a true gem of not only New Orleans, but Americana as well! You'll love it!",1122249600,5,702,4.4921875
7868262,3,6304293585,"Doctor Morgus (aka ""Morgus the Magnificent"" and ""Momis Alexander Morgus"") was (and may still be?) one of the original and probably one of the best of that vanishing breed of early television  ""horror movie hosts"". The character is pretty familiar - the mad  scientist - but he carries a great deal of manic energy to the part. He  started in New Orleans, but did a year's worth of shows in Detroit (just  after he did this film - coincidence? ;-) His sidekick ""Chopsley""  didn't make it to Detroit, but apparently was a major contributor to the  goings on in the New Orleans show, and has a prominent part in this movie,  too.
You aren't going to see anything particularly original - the  ""plot"" involves Dr. Morgus inventing a machine that turns people  into sand, and the attempts of ""foreign agents"" to steal the  invention. Believe me, there's better stuff in your typical ""Rocky and  Bullwinkle"" episode, but you probably already knew that. The  attraction for me was seeing Morgus in action, exactly as I remembered him  from the ""Late Show"" on CBS Friday nights in that Detroit year.  New Orleans natives love this guy, too - you can always find Mardi Gras  dubloons with his image on them on on line auctions.
So - a very  special-interest type of film. If you remember Morgus, or are doing  research into early 60's horror movie hosts (before Elvira), or would like  to see New Orleans as it looked 40 years ago, then you might want to check  this one out. But the rest of you are warned - what was hilarious to a  10-year-old back in '64 may not be *your* cup of tea.",958521600,9,1577,4.524822695035461
