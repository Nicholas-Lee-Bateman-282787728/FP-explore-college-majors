8285775,3,B001C43JU6,"Desaccord Parfait aka Twice Upon a Time/Remake is a perfectly pleasant, perfectly forgettable star vehicle that's all sit, not much com. The sit is that back in the 70s director Jean Rochefort and his muse Charlotte Rampling were once French cinema's golden couple. Now she's retreated to the British stage and marriage to a Lord and he's now directing downmarket comedies and is scouting locations in London, where he's lined up to accept a Lifetime Achievement BATA (I guess BAFTA couldn't give an F for the film) and some bright spark has come up with the idea of getting her to present it. Cue the inevitable rekindled sparks of hatred and affection, but not many laughs, the film aiming at easy targets like gay aristocrats, brash nouveau riche, flatulent dogs, smartarse butlers and Francophobic Brits (though ironically a cameoing Charles Dance's Francophobic awards speech is the funniest thing in the film) with a poor hit rate. Instead, the film seems so pleased at its casting coup that it seems to think just having them onscreen together is enough to carry the film. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Rochefort does his best with thin material while Rampling, still letting her puppies out of the kennel at 60, is absolutely terrible whenever she has to act in English yet suddenly becomes a more assured actress the moment she starts talking French again. Some of the other accents slip - Swiss-born James Thierree's English is excellent as her uppercrust son but occasionally slips into a distinctly French rhythm of delivery - while Dance aside the supporting cast can't make much of their stereotyped roles, though poor old Ian Richardson, visibly ailing in one of his last roles, does his best with what he's given. Antoine de Caunes' direction only really lapses into EuroTrash vulgarity with the film's would-be major comic setpiece, a dinner party from Hell in a peanut millionaire's hideously decorated mansion with guests including a plastic surgeon that is never outrageous enough to disguise the fact that its just not funny, but there's more imagination in the stylish photo montage title sequence. Still, if you find the idea of Rampling constantly being mistaken for Mary Poppins by people too rich to contradict or ever wanted to see Rochfort imitate King Kong at a dinner party, this is your film.

While the French PAL DVD boasts a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with English subtitles, the extras - deleted scenes, interview with de Caunes, spoof documentary Le Bulldog Anglais, an unedited version of Boy George's number and trailer - are all unsubtitled.",1284076800,,2596,5.037209302325581
