8388012,5,B0033HKBOC,The director weaves an interesting tale which dares to not be predictable.  The story revolves around the employees of an ice cream parlor; the characters portrayed are far from being role models but their plights are captivating.  We laugh and cry with them.,1268179200,,259,5.0
8388013,5,B0033HKBOC,"This movie delicately intertwines the professional and then personal lives of three men of different ages, stages, ethnicities and backgrounds. It was truly a heart warming film about family, friendships and discovering who you are and listening to who you want to be. You can't help but fall in love with the characters.

Technically, the performances were exceptional, it was nicely shot and the production value was excellent.",1251331200,2,429,5.3088235294117645
