8217352,4,B000V9A3JI,"This is about the studio that photographed nuclear weapons tests. We are taken from the Nevada desert to remote Pacific islands. 6,500 films were made. The atomic filmmakers documented America's patriotic era that preceded Vietnam. Peter Kuran directed the film. He worked on five documentaries about atomic weapons and testing. He directed Trinity And Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie. I love the desert with its Joshua trees and varieties of cacti. Those mushroom clouds sure are pretty! An older guy talks about Japan and and the atomic bomb and how its use was necessary to end World War II.",1428278400,,592,4.98989898989899
8217353,5,B000V9A3JI,"I didn't think it was possible, but this is actually better than the VHS version. The ""Extras"" are fantastic. It's hard to believe that the United States actually did this.",1427155200,,172,4.766666666666667
8217354,5,B000V9A3JI,"I just finished screening "" Atomic Filmmakers:Hollywoods Secret Film Studio "" and it really took me by surprise. I am old enough to remember life in the fifties, the paranoia, the above ground testing of huge nuclear bombs.  It seemed like every couple of weeks another island in the Pacific would disappear!  I thought that I had seen all there was to see on the subject of nuclear detonations. WRONG!  There is much recently de-classified information in this documentary, including detonations captured on Rapatronic cameras { look it up ! } The disc was well done with digital enhancement and special features.  This is a MUST-SEE DVD for anyone interested in mushrooms blooming in the desert !!",1409702400,3,698,4.94017094017094
8217355,5,B000V9A3JI,"Provides a look into how classified documentation was made at the beginning of the atomic age.  Features many personal interviews and technical aspects on setting up shots.  Good overview, will leave the viewer a better understanding of efforts to document the early tests.",1389484800,3,273,5.325581395348837
8217356,5,B000V9A3JI,"This is an incredible viewing of the inner workings of the studio responsible for live documetation of the atomic test and the various other details included for complete theater quality films that would be presented to the military, congress,defense contractors, R&D labs, etc. An up front and personal interview with the many people who were there to record these bigger than life events shows the human side of those who worked the cameras at uncomfortably close distances to the hundreds of detonations during our nuclear testing era.  Details of the many types of photographic equipment developed specificly for the purpose of capturing the micro-second growth of the fireball from detonation to mushroom cloud !  Not only nuclear test but weapons deployment tests, rad safety personel, delivery vehicle tests and every facit tied to each of these events. It is a riviting account made public by Peter Kuran thru the de-classification of countless film reels and reprocessing the aging film to make it like new !  This is a must see movie in addition to the other documentaries Peter had created to show what so few of people ever knew and could never talk about !",1347580800,7,1169,4.984615384615385
