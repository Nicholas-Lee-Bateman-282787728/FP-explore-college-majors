1723422,4,B0000687F7,"""The Bride and the Beast"" (1958 - 73 minutes), photographed originally in black & white, is a supernatural drama of terror and scientific fiction produced and directed by Adrian Weiss. The script is of the fantastic  Edward D. Wood Jr, the known Ed Wood, director, writer, producer and actor, also called  ""the worst moviemaker of all time"" for carrying through cheap films of dubious quality and with amateur actors. The incredible thing is that, after his death, all his work had become ""cult"", turning him into one of the most acclaimed accomplishing of the sort.

The film tells the history of Dan Fuller, a young and famous hunter and his pretty bride, Laura, that is strangely seduced by a gorilla. Dan keeps in captivity, in the basement of his house, an enormous gorilla that he brought from Africa. In the night of his honeymoon, the dangerous beast becomes very aggressive, escapes from its cage and goes up to the room to meet the young woman. Something very strange happens between the beauty and the beast and Dan has to kill the gorilla. From there, Laura starts to have terrible nightmares, making her husband calls a psychiatrist. When the doctor hypnotize Laura, he discovers that she was a gorila in one of hers last lifes. Dan has set appointments to a new safari in Africa and takes his wife with him. Nearest the wild animals, the couple will  live moments of great tension when Laura is kidnapped by one gorilla. A classic trash movie.",1092441600,,1457,4.747035573122529
1723423,1,B0000687F7,"I waited years to see this little epic and when I found it available on DVD, I snapped it up. Then I watched it. Well. I should have just given up. But no, I have a fondness for low budget horror movies. However, ""Beast"" is a curious failure and it broke my heart that it wasn't even enjoyable on a mere camp level. Lance Fuller brings new bride Charlotte Austin home and introduces her to his pet ape he keeps in the basement. He's a big game hunter. Austin and the ape develope an attraction for each other (no, really) and soon the gorilla is sneaking up to her room. Fuller catches the beast making passes at her (really!) and shoots it dead...to Austin's dismay. She goes under hypnosis from Fuller's friend and discovers she was a gorilla in a past life. Then they go on safari and she allows a big gorilla to abduct her and never goes back to Fuller. Way, way too much jungle stock footage kill the story. There are moments of hallucinatory silliness, yes, but the movie just doesn't hold up on it's own. I was so bummed out that it was, indeed, a ""bomb"" all the way that I walked out the next day and gave it to some guy I saw sitting on the curb. Now that's sad. And I love gorilla movies! Where's ""GORILLA AT LARGE"" on DVD? It's got Anne Bancroft getting carried away, it's in lurid color AND has Charlotte Austin in it! ""Bride and the Beast"" is too cheaply made to enjoy.",1030060800,,1382,4.258555133079848
1723424,4,B0000687F7,"Bride and the Beast, co-produced by Adrian Weiss (ex B-movie editor/producer) and (father?) Lewis Weiss (ex silent and cheapie western producer), and scripted by Edward D. Wood Jr., never really replicates the manic delirium of Wood's directorial efforts (Plan 9, Glen or Glenda, Night of the Ghouls, etc.) Unlike those films, the fun here results not so much from breathless incompetence as from the ludicrousness of the overall concept. Bride and the Beast is a campy, immensely entertaining melange of jungle thrills, domestic melodrama, and past-life regression/reincarnation hokum, with a touch of implied bestiality thrown in to give it that Woodian je ne sais quoi. Lance Fuller moves up from his supporting role in the equally enjoyable jungle-horror opus Voodoo Woman to star as Dan Fuller, big-game hunter, who returns home to his jungle ""mansion"" with newlywed bride Laura, played by gorgeous, sultry Charlotte Austin (Gorilla at Large, Daddy Long Legs, Frankenstein 1970). Johnny Roth is houseboy/guide Taro, one of those Natives of Indeterminate Ethnic Makeup (apparently a member of that B-movie caste who refer to white men as ""bwana,"" Taro's skin color varies throughout, he has Caucasian features, and wears a turban). Veteran monkey-suiters Steve Calvert and Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan play the gorillas. The excitement starts as soon as the honeymoon begins: Laura reveals her fur fetish to Dan; she and his full-grown pet gorilla, Spanky, are strangely affected/attracted by each other; Laura has disturbing dreams about gorillas; Spanky breaks out of his cage during a thunderstorm to menace (?) her; Dan awakes, shoots and kills Spanky, then later takes Laura to a shrink who hypnotically regresses her and determines that she was a gorilla in a previous life! (Hypnotic regression was a hot topic at the time because of the famous Bridey Murphy case; see Corman's The Undead, I Was a Teenage Werewolf, Fright, etc.) Progressing from a man-eating tiger hunt in the jungle to Laura's abduction by a pair of horny gorillas (one is blonde like White Pongo) and final showdown at Bronson's Canyon, Bride ultimately surprises with an incredible ahead-of-its time 'downbeat' ending. Crazy as it sounds, Bride and the Beast really isn't a knee-slapping Bad Film atrocity; in spite (or perhaps because) of the offbeat subject matter I actually found it quite absorbing, yet hugely entertaining on a camp level as well. The younger Weiss's actually fairly competent, if pedestrian, direction keeps the plot moving along briskly, and the substantial stock footage is integrated into the movie rather well for a cheapie of this type. (People with animal-cruelty sensitivities may be offended by a few clips.) The musical score is by an apparently slumming Les Baxter (famous for his 'exotica' LPs and numerous AIP soundtracks) and Harry Thomas (Frankenstein's Daughter, Night of the Ghouls) did the makeup. Highly recommended for fans of cheesy jungle thrillers, gorilla freaks, and Ed Wood completists. Makes a great co-feature with Curt Siodmak's Bride of the Gorilla.
With the Allied Artists catalog in DVD limbo due to Warner Home Video's apparent indifference and foot-dragging, this will likely be the only disc release of this movie in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, the transfer appears to be from a 16mm source print, and while the tonal values range from very good to excellent (a little worse in some of the stock footage) and the black level and shadow/highlight detail are pretty acceptable, the print has a slightly soft, dupey look; no worse than a typical TV print, but probably a bit of a letdown to those spoiled by the typically tack-sharp Image/Wade Williams DVDs. Fortunately, physical damage is limited to some light speckling and spotting, leaving the picture very watchable overall. The mono audio is clear and the included 35mm trailer looks generally excellent, if also a bit soft and exhibiting some light speckling and lining. Six chapter stops and a nicely done if somewhat skimpy gallery of about a dozen stills and lobby cards (accompanied by some jarringly inappropriate music) are also provided. Another 'bonus' is a pretty awful (bad acting, unfunny 'comedy') 3.5-minute sequence from the aborted Wood-scripted Beach Blanket Bloodbath, featuring Forrest J Ackerman and Bobbie Bresee, which completists may care about but that will probably not impress anyone else. Also (dis)gracing the disc is an interview with and some shorts by one David ""The Rock"" Nelson, whose miserable home videos (that have insanely been compared by some to Ed Wood movies) are so embarassingly putrid they make Beast of Yucca Flats look like Citizen Kane. A complete waste (I fast-forwarded through most of it) and definitely INessential; consider yourself warned. In total an acceptable if less than ultimate package that will have to tide gorilla fans over till someone digs up and transfers some crisp 35mm elements (don't hold your breath).",1026000000,9,4968,5.266078184110971
7964022,3,B0000687F7,"Throughout filmdom,  characters have been possessed by or have borne dual egos with a vast variety of non-human entities:  demons, space aliens, wolves, snakes, and so on.  Having the nature of a gorilla shouldn't even be that noticeable, but in the muddled mind of Ed Wood, such a psychology becomes one of fur fetishism and further sexual perversion.  Set within a plot of schmaltzy 50's-era sexuality, the story is made sillier by the minute with over-the-top ape suits and comical incongruities.  The movie is made tolerable by decent acting and attempts at logical incorporation of lengthy stock footage (the tigers in Africa escaped from a ship, e.g.).  By the conclusion, one might wonder--vis-a-vis the leading lady and the gorillas--just who is possessed by whom!",1393632000,,772,5.185483870967742
7964023,5,B0000687F7,I found both the Bride and the Beast and the White Gorilla DVDs entertaining monster movies. The DVDs worked good.,1372291200,2,114,4.75
7964024,2,B0000687F7,"Yes, its two stars, and yes, I know all of Ed Wood's movies are bad.  Usually that's why I love them, since the entertainment level is so much higher than so many other crappy movies.  I love Plan 9, Bride of the Monster, etc so much that I started getting his lesser known 50's flicks (I'm stopping there though, I'm not gonna touch his more ""adult"" films, for obvious reasons) to see if they retain the same quality of entertainment his more famous works are known for.  I happily report that ""The Violent Years"" is hysterically funny, and I can only imagine it being even better it would be if Wood had directed instead of just writing the script.

""Bride and the Beast"" also written-but-not-directed by Wood, unfortunately does not live up/down to Ed Wood's usual standards, nor even have the same charm ""The Violent Years"" had.  Why?  Because even though there are traces if idiotic dialogue and the plot itself is completely loopy its also accompanied by decent acting (oddly enough making more than the usual amount of dialogue actually work) and a HUGE safari sequence that is literally 40+ minutes of various, locationally-inaccurate stock footage.  You can literally take a nap of decent length at the half-hour mark, wake up, and not have missed anything worth seeing.

I've seen everything Wood did from ""Glen or Glenda"" up to ""The Sinister Urge"" and this movie is by a large margin the least entertaining Ed Wood film that I've seen.  If you're a Wood completist, you probably already know about this one.  If you're just a fan of old, awesomely crappy movies, this one doesn't deliver nearly enough of the goods to be worth seeing even once.  If you need a good, obscure Ed Wood flick, ""The Violent Years"" is the way to go.  If you need a so-bad-its-good gorilla movie, try ""Konga"" on for size, its way more fulfilling to the B-movie lover than this bore-fest.",1357948800,,1874,4.697247706422019
7964025,3,B0000687F7,"Two gorilla movies from the 50's which sounds pretty cool. But be warned, the gorillas move in slo-mo and there is about 30 minutes of stock  footage from cheesy jungle films. But I did enjoy them anyway. It could be my low standards.",1352073600,,234,4.441860465116279
7964026,4,B0000687F7,"Anyone who grew up in the late fifties and early sixties remembers watching some of the greatest exploitation films during the day and evening on television way before cable and reality series novacained the air waves.  My favorites happened to be ape movies of which the Universal Paula Dupree ape woman series and Director Stuart Heisler's 'THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL'-1941 were standouts.  However, the family Weiss delved into the genre with the help of Edward D Wood Jr. to produce the guilty pleasure 'THE BRIDE AND THE BEAST'-1958 and VCI has released it in all of its low budget glory.  The real treat is the audio commentary led by Film Historian extroadinaire Tom Weaver with the lead actress Charlotte Austin who continues to mesmerize with her great memories and stories and genre afficionado Bob Burns and actor Slick Slavin.  Austin even has a great anecdote on the angora sweater (a Wood Staple) worn in the film.  Also along for the ride is the Weiss hodge podge 'THE WHITE GORILLA'-1945 blending footage from a silent serial 'PERILS OF THE JUNGLE'-1927 with a new screenplay and has to be seen to be believed for its classic ineptness.  It's a great package and recommended to all so bad it's good film fans out there.  For more great Charlotte Austin memories, check out Mr. Weaver's superb audio track on Director Howard W. Koch's 'FRANKENSTEIN 1970'- 1958 included in the 'KARLOFF/LUGOSI' package released by Warner Video last year.

7964030,3,B0000687F7,"Laura Carson (Charlotte Austin) has just married big game hunter Dan Fuller (Lance Fuller.)  On her wedding night she finds herself strangely attracted to Spanky, a gorilla gone bad that Dan keeps locked up in a basement cage.  Before you can say ""Ed Wood wrote this,"" there are gun shots, nightmares, hypnotism, and Dan's unhappy discover that bride Laura may be the reincarnation of a gorilla queen!  Can you dig it?

Now and then a bad movie becomes unintentionally hilarious, but most of the time bad movies are simply bad.  BRIDE AND THE BEAST actually teeters between the two, and this is largely due to the two leads: even in the face of producer-director Adrian Weiss' obvious lack of talent, Austin and Fuller prove unexpectedly competent, and they actually manage to hold the worst of the dialogue at bay.  What this means, however, is that BRIDE never self-destructs in the ludicrous way of such films as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE--and in consequence it isn't so much unintentionally hilarious as it is unintentionally amusing in a mild sort of way.

The film is full of absurdities.  Dan Fuller's basement, where the ill-fated gorilla Spanky is caged, has a refrigerator, but illumination is provided by torch.  Servant Taro (Johnny Roth, in what seems to be his only film role) is very obviously a white man in bad ""native"" make-up; he runs around saying ""Bwana"" a lot.  There is a lot of canned wild animal footage, shots of Africa that look suspiciously like shots of South America, and men in bad gorilla costumes.  And Ed Wood being Ed Wood, he just can't resist writing references to angora sweaters into the script.

The print is mediocre, but it is worth pointing out that it was probably never very good to begin with, and the DVD release comes with several bonuses of no interest.  Fans of cult films, and especially die hard fans of Ed Wood, will enjoy it--and for their sake I give it three stars.  But just about every one else should give it a miss.

7964031,2,B0000687F7,"The Bride and the Beast (1958) - 2 B-stars

1 star for Ed Wood's horrible script and plot

1 star for the feeble attempt to tie together clip footage with the rest of the film.

Ed Wood did not direct this movie, but he did write the screenplay, and it's really the screenplay - and the low budget - that really sinks this movie. This is one of those ""Aftrican safari"" movies that are half made of clip footage, and you can obviously recognize the difference. It's always entertaining to see how the poor beleagued director tries to pierce together the movie from Ed Wood's horrible script and the horrible clip footage, and the constant continuity errors.

Things I've learned from The Bride and the Beast :

* Gorillas can detect telepathic brain waves and know about people's past lives.

* Gorillas are the most fearsome animals in the jungle.

* If suitably angered, a gorilla can bend iron bars.

* Hypnosis unlocks a person's past life, and eventually make them literally become their past life (such as : a gorilla).

* The African savannah is also half Brazilian rainforest. In this weird hybrid, you don't need machettes because there are already clear paths from one place to another.

* South American natives live in Kenya, and are always on hand to teach weaving to rich white women.

* Leopards hunt during the day.

* A man can fight off tigers AND gorillas, hand-to-hand, and only have scratches.

* Gorillas live in giant caves, like Fred Flintstone.",1132617600,,1468,4.665369649805448
