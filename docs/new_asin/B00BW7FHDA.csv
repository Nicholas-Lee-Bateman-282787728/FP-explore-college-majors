8574665,5,B00BW7FHDA,Excellent and what a great way to remember Claudio Abado.,1437609600,3,57,4.8
8574666,5,B00BW7FHDA,"I consider it as a privilege that I have known Abbado personally. Both of us attended the Dimitri Mitropoulos competition in 1963 in New York. In that time he was already a remarkable talent, I was a baby. It was easy to admit that he deserved the first price.
He experienced the music deep inside. I have never seen him using a score!
Beside that he was a modest and casual type of person, and he knew exactly how two deal with his fellow musicians, meanwhile keeping a natural distance. His orchestra loved him, in contrast to the previous boss, von Karajn. We may say that Abbado was one of the greatest conductors of the last 50 years. I highly recommend this DVD.",1397520000,10,668,4.439024390243903
