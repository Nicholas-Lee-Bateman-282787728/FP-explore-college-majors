2510108,3,B000E8JO2S,"Loved the show and was unhappy when I heard it had been canceled so quickly. So why am I saying the box set is poor and giving it three stars? Two words: full screen. Sorry guys, but I didn't buy an HDTV and an anamorphic-capable DVD player to watch this thing with huge black bars on the left and right side of the screen. As the show was shot in 16:9 (resulting in even less black bars on normal full screen displays) it was a crime (no pun intended) to release this as anything less than 16:9 anamorphic.

And FYI: all the other Law & Order box sets are the same way (full screen, no 16:9 anamorphic support). Maybe when they do TV shows on Blu-ray I'll finally be able to purchase a set that looks good on HDTV.",1143072000,5,715,4.143884892086331
2510109,5,B000E8JO2S,"This was a great attempt at a trial version of the successful Law & Order franchise.  Fred Thompson continues his role of NYC District Attorney.  Bebe Neuwirth and Amy Carlson played the ADA's that prosecuted the cases.

Each episode started after the completion of the criminal investigation and the case was handed over to the DA's office.  This does not mean that the investigation was over.  Jerry Orbach, until his untimely death and then Kirk Acevado were the investigators assigned to the ADA's.

This was a great series that didn't make it for a number of reasons.  First and foremost was a lousy timeslot.  And this is the only L&O franschise that had only female leads.  It's too bad that NBC didn't give the show some nuturing.

The best episode is the SVU crossover Day with the great Angela Lansbury.

I have this on preorder and will give a full review when I get it.",1141862400,11,881,4.619354838709677
2510110,5,B000E8JO2S,"Law & Order; Trial By Jury wss a very different type of series from the previous 3 in the series, focusing mainly on the trial, rather than the criminal investigation, which is already completed, by the time these stories begin.

Bebe Neuwirth (Lilith from ""Cheers"") takes the reins as Assistant District Attorney Tracy Kibre, working under District Attorney Arthur Branch (Fred Dalton Thompson from ""Law & Order""). The DA's Police investigators were meant to be headed in this series by Law and Order legend Jerry Orbach, reprising his role as Lennie Briscoe. Tragically, Jerry died after producing only two episodes :-( Personally, I believe it was Jerry's death that led to TBJ's cancellation. People weren't as interested anymore after his death, and the kinda flat Detective Ravell was put in to replace him.

The stories were sharp, through TBJ's 13-episode run, though one of them never made it to air. The series crossed over with the original Law & Order, when Det. Green of that series got shot, and McCoy is unavailable to prosecute, leaving it to Kibre. This crossover also featured appearances on TBJ by Dennis Farina (Det. Fontana, L&O season 15), S. Epatha Merkerson (Lt. Van Buren, L&O), Jesse L. Martin (Det. Green, L&O), and Richard Belzer (Det. John Munch, L&O: SVU).

The series later crossed over with Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, when that squad was investigating a rapist, and their ADA was violently assaulted. For Casey Novak's protection, Branch removed her as prosecutor and put Kibre on the case.

This was another excellent series that suffered the fate of good TV falling victim to these horrible reality shows. It's getting to the point where I don't even watch regular TV anymore, except for reruns of my favorite shows.

When this series gets released on DVD, I'm grabbing the first available copy, and I'll be proud to have it in my Crime Drama collection!

New info: This set includes the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode which crosses over with Trial By Jury!!!!  Though it would've been nice if they'd included the original Law & Order crossover as well, we don't always get everything we want. Besides, they'll probably release the 15th season of L&O pretty soon.

2510111,5,B000E8JO2S,"With a nod to ABC's ""Murder One"", ""Law & Order: Trial By Jury"" charted bold new waters as the first Law & Order series to present its stories from the point-of-view of not only the prosecutors and investigators but also the defense attorneys, defendants, judges and jurors. This made for some very arresting television as viewers were taken through the inner workings of the judicial system, beginning with the arraignment, and continuing through the prosecutors' complicated process of building a case, investigating leads and preparing witnesses for trial.

After the ""real"" and painfully boring ""Law & Order: Crime & Punishment,"" it was nice to see the franchise return to traditional court TV drama format with appealing actors and exciting cases expertly written by brilliant writers. Three things drew me to this series when it was first announced for a midseason run: The show's premise; Jerry Orbach's jump from Law & Order; and beautiful Amy (Third Watch) Carlson's return to series television as A.D.A. Kelly Gaffney, having memorably guest-starred on both Law & Order and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Trial By Jury also starred Fred Dalton Thompson (Die Hard 2) reprising his D.A. Arthur Branch role from Law & Order; Kirk Acevedo as Lennie Briscoe's partner D.A. Investigator Hector Salazar; Scott Cohen as Detective Chris Ravell, who succeeded Briscoe after Jerry Orbach's untimely passing; and Bebe (Frasier) Neuwirth as A.D.A. Tracey Kibre. While a great cast, the real stars of the show were the writers [as with every other Law & Order series] who Dick Wolf himself constantly praised [as with every other Law & Order series], and rightfully so. Not to mention composer Mike Post for squeezing out yet another great and distinctive variation on his original ""Law & Order"" theme.

""Law & Order: Trial by Jury - The Complete Series"" is a 3-disc (single-sided) set featuring all 13 episodes from the series. Special Features include: Bonus ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" cross-over episode ""Night""; Deleted scenes from ""The Abominable Showman"", ""Forty-One Shots"", ""Vigilante"", and ""Truth or Consequences""; ""A Different Look at Law & Order"" featurette with the cast.

In the criminal justice system, all suspects are innocent until proven guilty, either by confession, plea bargain, or trial by jury. These are those trials.

1. The Abominable Showman
2. Forty-One Shots
3. Vigilante
4. Truth or Consequences
5. Baby Boom
6. Pattern of Conduct
7. Bang & Blame
8. Skeleton (continuation of a Law & Order crossover)
9. The Line
10. Blue Wall
11. Day (continuation of included bonus Law & Order: SVU crossover)
12. Boys Will Be Boys
13. Eros in the Upper Eighties

Highly Recommended!",1138665600,53,2705,5.138636363636364
2510112,5,B000E8JO2S,"It's a proven fact that the other three Law & Orders took time to grow into the popular shows that they are now so I was really surprised that Trial by Jury was cancelled. It also was the highest rated show to go off the air last year. Even though Jerry Orbach passed away the rest of the superb cast found ways to make the other episodes worth watching.

Law & Order: Trial by Jury was a great addition to the franchise because it was a great way to connect the shows together. There were two crossovers with Law & Order and Special Victims Unit which were excellent and I would have liked to see what the future would have brought. Bebe Neuwirth and Amy Carlson starred as ADA's Kibre and Gaffney and Oz's Acevedo starred as D.A. Investigator Hector Salazar. Scott Cohen was brought in to replace the late Jerry Orbach and Fred Dalton Thompson rounded out the cast by continuing his role as D.A. Arthur Branch.

Trial by Jury was focused around the trial but the D.A. Investigators sometimes questioned witnesses. The questioning was similar to how Special Victims Unit had a small bit devoted to the trial. It went through all aspects of the trial and it also showed the defense for a portion of the show. Though it was a lot different than the previous three, Trial by Jury showed how change can be a good thing.

Trial by Jury was most likely cancelled because NBC really wanted an instant hit. If it had had time to grow, I think Trial by Jury would've become one of the best shows on television. The DVD set looks promising though with good special features and the Law & Order crossover episode in this set as well. This DVD is a great way to relive Trial By Jury and I highly recommend it.",1137888000,78,1698,4.401273885350318

2510144,5,B000E8JO2S,"I'm a big Law & Order fan, but of all the many series, TbJ is by far my favorite version.  Obviously, though, the majority of people prefer the shock & gore (dead bodies, emotional distress, sexual assaults) of the other versions (SVU, LA, etc.) because THOSE versions got the ratings to continue for multiple years, whereas TbJ only for one.

Know where the L&O episode leaves off? That's where this series starts.  In fact, my favorite part was the 2 part episode wherein Part 1 is the ""Law & Order SVU"" episode and Part 2 is the ""Law & Order TbJ"" episode.

Trial by Jury shows how & why perfectly good evidence can get tossed from a trial, demonstrates how much of a legal defense is putting on a good show for the jury (explaining why paying more for a lawyer is better associated with getting you off), how plea bargains are made, and how lawyers/ district attorneys/ judges intersect.

To me, it was the best ever, the most fascinating.  That said, the general public holds a different opinion.",1400198400,,1000,4.558659217877095

2510152,5,B000E8JO2S,"I am a die-hard fan of the original Law and Order series, and was intrigued to learn that there was a ""Trial by Jury"" version for a brief period of time. An extra benefit was the starring role of Bebe Neuwirth (Lillith in ""Cheers""), whom I think is a really fine and somewhat underrated actor, and the inclusion of several of the standard L&O regulars, such as the great late Jerry Orbach. (Detective Lenny Briscoe)

I enjoyed this pilot series immensely, and watched all episodes in one weekend. It was a tiny bit rough at times, which is to be expected with any new series until it hits its stride. But having said that, its quality was miles and miles above 95 percent of current police crime dramas. I think its a real shame that the network decided to discontinue this show after just one season. But then...this is the same network that made the unfathomable decision to terminate one of the most consistently high quality dramas in television history, the original Law and Order series.",1388620800,3,993,4.642045454545454

On the other hand, Kirk Acevedo as the D.A. Investigator Hector Salazar and Fred Dalton Thompson's crossover performance as D.A. Arthur Branch are highlights.

it reminded me a bit of ""Damages"" and a lot of the original law and order series. There's a few times where they delve into tactics used by defense attorneys, which was very interesting and entertaining, i do remember that.

Sorry for a lackluster review, but rest assured it's a good series. Just a little slower than the original, which is probably why it got cancelled.",1354752000,,687,4.3515625

2510179,5,B000E8JO2S,"Once you can get over the casting of Bebe Neuwirth, so ingrained in viewer's minds as Lilith from ""Frasier,"" you will find an engaging legal drama.  The actress affords herself well as the lead prosecutor and it's good to see her tackle a much different role than the one for which she is most associated.

The rest of the cast is equally impressive: Amy Carlson as Neuwirth's assistant; Kirk Acevedo and Scott Cohen as police detectives; and Fred Dalton Thompson, coming over from the original L & O, as DA Arthur Branch. Other recurring cast members include Seth Gilliam and Leslie Hendrix, also an L & O fixture.

The stories are quite engrossing, with outstanding performances from the likes of guests Angela Lansbury, Alfred Molina, and, in ""crossover"" installments, S. Epatha Merkerson, Dennis Farina, Richard Belzer, Jesse L. Martin, and Sam Waterson.  Fortunately, the producers wisely chose to include both the ""SVU"" episode - the ones with both Lansbury and Molina guesting - and its ""Trial by Jury"" second-part on this compilation.  The ""SVU"" compilation from its sixth season only had its entry.

Though star Jerry Orbach only appeared in two episodes, it's still good to see the fan favorite in his last performances as the beloved Lennie Briscoe.

It's too bad that the show was not given a longer shelf-life but even in its short run of 13 episodes, it was still a worthy addition to the L & O franchise.",1338336000,,1419,4.838842975206612

It was fantastic to see Angela Lansbury appear as a guest star in one of the stories on this set. Bebe Neuwirth and Amy Carlson star as Assistant District Attorneys Kibre and Gaffney. Kirk Acevedo also appears to replace Orbach. Acevedo is as good as he was in the prison drama Oz.
Trial by Jury was focused around the trial which made it better than the others for me. Sometimes the other sereies seemed far too rushed during their courtroom scenes.

2510183,5,B000E8JO2S,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this show, since I'd seen both good and bad reviews. Some people say it's great. Some people say it's boring. Some people say that parts of it were a bit unbelievable (like clients confessing to their lawyers and/or their lawyers giving relatively shady advice, or in one case a lawyer who was their client's accomplice).

Personally, I liked it. I hadn't seen it during the original run but picked up the complete series when it was on sale for a ridiculously low price. I'm pretty sure I got the better end of that deal. :)

I agree with some that it's a little different than the original L&O or SVU, as it doesn't focus on the police work, but rather on the lawyerly side of ""Law"" & Order. That is, it's mostly about how the prosecution and the defense build their cases, conduct mock trials so they can pander to the jury, etc. There is occasionally some time given to the cops, though it's usually only in reference to re-interviewing witnesses or ""padding"" a case with some additional background, evidence, etc.

Overall, I've gotten through the first half of the episodes and have enjoyed them all. It's definitely a different approach to L&O and I can see how some might be turned off by it. But I personally found it just as entertaining as the original series.

I think it needed some more time to find its stride and the death of Jerry Orbach from cancer after only a couple of episodes were filmed didn't help matters. I think that given a few more seasons it could have become another staple of the L&O franchise. I'm kind of sad it didn't go longer.

These 13 episodes are well crafted.  The acting is superb.

The late Jerry Orbach passed away as this series was being filmed.  This was a great loss to the series and the viewers.

Bebe Neuwirth of Cheers fame was lead chair.  Amy Carlson was her young assistant.  The ethical conversations these two engaged in over cases are rare gems-well written and timely.

You have the Boss DA--Fred Dalton Thompson making his presence felt in every episode and spewing his opinions.  Great actor!

The guest stars are plenty.  The judges and defense lawyers are top notch with their own agendas and vocal opinions.

2510205,5,B000E8JO2S,"Since 1990, despite many cast changes, NBC's longest running drama series Law and Order has kept us interested in the inside and out of crime on the streets of my beloved homeland New York City.  The original series introduced the show's concept, the police investigations for half the show and the D.A.'s prosecution the accused for the second half.  As years passed, the show became more 60/40 sometimes 70/30 in favor of 1 half of the cast (sometimes the cops, sometimes the D.A.'s). In 1999, Special Victims Unit focussed on a team of sex crime investigators and the D.A. assigned to tackle those cases.  In 2001, Criminal Intent, brought us a chance to see the 1 thing I thought we would never see in a cop show. We learn from the start who done it, the cops and D.A. spend the episode trying to decipher WHY he or she did it. Now in 2005, Trial By Jury was to bring the next logical step.  The accused has been already scheduled for trial, now the cops and D.A.'s spent the early stages of the show preparing and interviewing their witness list followed by the trial itself.  Sadly the series was cancelled after it's introductory 3 month season, with the death of Jerry Orbach who was retired off the parent series, so he could be helpful for this series.  Apparantly, the powers that be had thought so well of his character from the parent series (which he joined the cast of in 1992) that he would be able to help this series get off the ground.  Unfortunately, after episode 2 he was dead, so the series continued without him but was cancelled before the last episode and worse yet, not renewed.  The final episode was eventually aired when the late Court TV ran a full day marathon of the entire series and fortunately for us was included in this set.  My only grievance with this set is this.  Like the other spinoffs, this series had crossover episodes with other Law and Order series.  One episode had its ""part 1"" on Special Victims Unit and concluded here.  We get both parts of the story in this set, although I am certain the original ""part 1"" story is included in the respective SVU season set.  However, another crossover is made with the parent series.  The original episode aired not long after Orbach left the series and was replaced by Dennis Farina.  For this crossover, we are only given the second half of the story.  Why the manufacturer gave us 1 crossover in its entirety but not the other, is unfair.  If they give us the complete story (both the ""part 1"" episode and the ""part 2"" (Trial By Jury) episode, in the respective Law and Order season set, I will get on their case later.  In any event, since this show was so short, make sure you get it whether you intend to buy the other 3 series or not.  It is still ""New York's finest"" at their best like its predecessors, and we are not likely to see its like again.  BUY IT!!!",1201996800,2,2857,4.457692307692308

I'm more of a fan of the original and SVU.When Dennis Farina was brought in to replace Jerry Orbach,I thought it was a very good decision. But I was sadden Dennis Farina left the series.

2510209,3,B000E8JO2S,"Trial By Jury failed to live up to its potential. The first few episodes held out the promise of an in-depth look at how the legal system works from all angles, including the jury, but this was quickly altered to a focus on the Bebe Neuwirth character and her investigators. In effect, it became an hour-long version of the second half of the original L&O. Still, the show was interesting and entertaining, and its crossovers with other L&O shows were fun. I enjoyed Neuwirth, both her acting and her character. I wasn't put off at all by her terse manner or cynicism, and I think she had pretty good chemistry with her female sidekick. Some of the storylines did seem to be retreads of stories from other L&O shows, but if the writers could have managed to overcome that trend, and stayed true to the show's original potential, then it might have been another strong entry in the L&O franchise.

I do have to say, however, that even though I liked the show, the fact that its creativity started waning after a few episodes caused me to be less disappointed by its cancellation than I might have been. Jerry Orbach, who was intended to be a regular on the show playing Lenny Briscoe, could have been the sympathetic character this show was missing, but his worsening illness and then death put an end to those plans and probably this show. He was only able to show up during the first two episodes, and even then he looked quite ill. These days, networks aren't generally willing to give a series time to come into its own. If you don't produce ratings in the first half dozen outings, its generally cancellation time.

I'd recommend this DVD for those of us who are dyed in the wool L&O fans, but if you're not in this category, you might not really like this show that much.",1166832000,29,1776,4.512422360248447

While not as emotionally engaging as its predecessors, the series nonetheless offered some gripping storylines, and some superb performances from its regulars and guest stars.

While Bebe Neuwirth's character isn't exactly likeable, she nonetheless brought a strong sense of justice and strength to her role.  Amy Carlson as her assistant was a little warmer and added a touch of sensitivity.  Kirk Acevedo was understated and sincere; Steve Cohen brought a little more volatility to his role.  The guest list was impressive:  Lorraine Bracco, Alfred Molina, Angela Lansbury, Annabella Sciorra and others all brought class to the series.

Too bad NBC gave up too quickly; I would've enjoyed more episodes.",1160006400,7,816,5.377952755905512
2510211,4,B000E8JO2S,"Of the three spin-offs, SVU and Criminal Intent being the other two, Trial by Jury was the most interesting because it looked at aspects of the legal system and court procedure that the other spin-offs and the original L&O just couldn't go into because of time alotment. When the episode starts, the accused is usually already apprehended and then the episode is devoted to focusing on the two detectives who build up the D.A.s case while the trial or grand jury proceedings starts. The D.A.s always have an interesting interplay with the judges, witnesses, evidence, jury, and the defense team.

Trial by Jury was probably set up for failure because they only filmed 13 episodes instead of the usual 22-24. There might have been other reasons too like the cast or the fact that it was a Friday night show. Neuwirth plays a good D.A. but is given little character developement in the series. Even less character developement is given to her right hand woman Carlson who has an incredibly minor role in the first few episodes. Jerry Orbach, basically the face of the L&O enterprise, stars in two episodes. Apparently he was so ill in the ""forty-one shots"" episode he had to whisper in a few scenes because he couldn't talk. It goes to saying that they might have kept this show on the air soley based on if Orbach hadn't died. Acevedo plays a very tough and convincing detective. Cohen on the other hand, doesn't do that great of a job. Also, Neuwirth is given much too weighty of a role in most of the episodes.

Some of the episodes are mediocre to good but some are really quite stellar, like the one about the baby sitter accused of killing the baby. The writing is very inconsistent for the series. This is apparent when the defense side of the trial is being shown. In several cases, the defense is giving questionable advice to the accused who are telling their lawyers that they killed the person and can't let whatever evidence they left behind see the light of day. Not very convincing.

All in all, I don't think this series was really given a good chance to mature. SVU might be the best spin-off in my opinion, but I think Trial by Jury had a lot of promise and given some time to hammer out some good writing and a little better casting, this show would've stayed on the air and might have become the best spin-off. I mean you can only watch so many rapes occur on SVU before it starts to get to you. Now I don't understand why Criminal Intent (a.k.a ""super cops who never loose a case or have a difficult situation arise"") was kept on the air if they canceled this.

I was disappointed to see TBJ cancelled prematurly (by the way, this show was much better than it's ""replacement"", Conviction, which currently occupies the 10:00 Friday timeslot).  This aside, I was excited to see a DVD release for this series.

HOWEVER...

From what I am reading, this release WILL have Dolby Digital 5.1, which is surprising, considering ALL other Law & Order releases have been no better than Dolby Digital 2.0.  This is great news, HOWEVER...

NO WIDESCREEN????  Let me get this straight.  The Old Seasons of Law & Order & SVU, I can understand.  I was upset at the lousy job that was done with the ""2003-2004"" releases of L&O (L&O season 14, SVU season 5 & Criminal Intent season 3) first because they were released out of order, second because it was in 2.0 and MOSTLY because there was no Widescreen, even though all 3 were broadcast in HDTV, which means they were in widescreen.

NOW, their newest show, TBJ which began & ended in 2005, is going to be in full screen???  Are we in the stone age?  Last time I checked, everything is moving toward widescreen, not the other way around!!!  Why broadcast in widescreen, then subsequently sell in full screen???

WISE UP, LAW & ORDER!  You're competitors, CSI, LOST & 24 are putting out much better box sets (Dolby 5.1, anamorphic widescreen).  Your show is as good, if not better, than those, so show some pride in the presentation of them on DVD!!!",1143417600,10,1491,4.612167300380228
