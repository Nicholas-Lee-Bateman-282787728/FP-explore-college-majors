1536886,5,B00005JLS5,"My, now 6 year old, grandaughter and I have been devoted fans of The Wild Thornberrys for as long as they have been on Nickelodian so when we found out the Movie was coming out, I just knew it would be a wonderful Holiday treat for us.  We went to an afternoon showing, shared popcorn and soda and thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing.  I find it very entertaining personally and I love the message that weaves through each TV segment and which was very evident throughout the movie about protecting the animals.  My grandaughter even calls me up to remind me when it's on and I plan to purchase the video for her (to share with me of course)! for an Easter basket gift.  Hoorah for the entire production company, and my only request, PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL SOON!!!!!",1048982400,,763,4.467625899280575
1536887,5,B00005JLS5,"It has to be said: although I'm a twentysomething, I still *love * to watch Nickelodeon cartoons, my absolute favourite being ""The Wild Thornberrys."" I've seen every episode (many more than once), and I was a little skeptical at the thought of a full-length animated movie.
Happily, the movie far surpassed my wildest expectations. The animation looks great, including the use of several CGI elements not present in the series (at some moments it reminded me of ""The Lion King""). There is enough background information included (including the opening credits of the series) that newcomers won't feel left behind. The whole Thornberry gang is here, including the addition of Nigel's parents, and several new characters as well. The voice work is fantastic, including such well-known names as Tim Curry as Nigel, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea as Donnie, Rupert Everett as the baddie, and Marisa Tomei. The music is an eclectic mix of traditional and modern, featuring such talents as Sting, Dave Matthews, P. Diddy and Brandy, Youssou D'Nour, Sting, Baha Men, Nick Carter, Peter Gabriel and Hugh Masekela.
The story finds Eliza Thornberry, a twelve-year old with the magical ability to talk to animals, on a hunt for migrating elephants with her family, who are award-winning naturalists. Eliza's older sister Debbie is a moody, pop culture-obsessed Valley Girl who hates all the wilderness trekking. Donnie is the Bornean wild boy that the Thornberrys adopted, who is always causing trouble by making messes and stuffing things up his nose or down his pants. Darwin is Eliza's best friend, a chimpanzee with very human tastes, including his obsession with Cheese Munchies. Eliza starts out playing with the cubs of a cheetah friend, but when one of them is stolen by a poacher Eliza must rescue him. However, her parents send her to a London boarding school, where Eliza is miserable and doesn't fit in. The rest of the movie you'll have to see to believe!
There are some scary chase scenes, wounded animals and tense moments that might upset younger viewers, but overall ""The Thornberrys Movie"" does an excellent job of bringing the show to the big screen while remaining faithful to the humour, excellent ethnic music, and magical elements of the original series. One of the things that I love the most about the ""Wild Thornberrys"" is that the episodes take viewers all around the world, and the show's producers try to avoid ethnic stereotypes with the various characters, as well as adding authentic music and traditions. This is one cartoon that is witty, educational and downright fun for the whole family. There's something for everyone with ""The Wild Thornberrys Movie.""",1046822400,16,2675,5.068027210884353
1536888,5,B00005JLS5,THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR FAMILIES TO OWN! IT WAS FUNNY AND IT HAD A LOT OF ADVENTURE. IT REALLY REMINDED ME OF MY YOUTH.,1044230400,2,121,3.6923076923076925
1536889,5,B00005JLS5,"The theme of this movie is revealed on the theatrical posters.  ""You don't have to have extraordinary powers to do extraordinary things.""  What an empowering message for children saturated by super-powered heros every day of the week, as well as on the big screen!
The Thornberrys are a weekly cartoon and we'd never seen it, but the previews in the theaters looked so good, we thought we'd try it.
Needless to say, at 62, I and my wife were the oldest people in the theater by far.
We weren't disappointed.  There was a lot of business thrown in for the younger set, (Mud, food fights, etc.) but also a lot of funny things which appealed to adults.  Especially the sarcastic valley girl older sister, who learns some lessons herself.  It's the kind of humor animators have been slipping into kids shows on television to keep the adults in the audience too.  The story is good if you are willing to go along with it,  after all, it is a cartoon!
As soon as I got home, I emailed my sisters suggesting they might want to take their grandchildren to see it.  (If they need an excuse to be seen at a ""kids"" movie.)  I'd say there are a few scenes which may be intense for anyone under five, but everyone above that age should really enjoy it, even ""grand-parent aged"" people.",1041552000,10,1272,4.471861471861472

In comparison to a lot of the Children's TV shows on the air these days -- many with disturbing and/or obscene scenes and characters; The Wild Thornberry's Movie was and still is a movie for both kids and adults alike where the central message is: That you do not have to be physically bigger or stronger than your opponent; you don't even have to be fearless, because it's okay to be scared; you just need to have a clear, focused mind, sheer will and determination, and a heart the size of...well, an elephant will do, and enough love to fill it.",1457481600,,654,4.198412698412699

1537267,5,B00005JLS5,"While you're waiting for the complete series of The Wild Thornberrys to be 1 DVD set by Shout Factory, I know I am, here's a review of their first movie, that debuted theatrically at Christmastime of 2002. The Wild Thornberrys have been through some wild and ""amazin'"" (amazon) adventures during the series, but it's the Wild Thornberrys Movie that takes the cake, by Eliza trying to stop poachers from wiping out the animals of the Savannah in Africa, especially a cheetah cub named Tally and a huge herd of elephants, even if it means losing her gift of Gab (being able to talk to animals, like Dr. Dolittle)! Like with Hey Arnold The Movie, don't let the online links of The Wild Thornberrys Movie fool you either; both movies can be seen in Fullscreen AND Widescreen formats on their single respective DVDs, or in the case of this movie, CinemaScope! The Wild Thornberrys was the very first Nicktoon series to have single episodes through a whole half-hour show, in the whole series! All the others up till then normally had episodes 11 minutes or less, at 2 or more episodes per half-hour show, they had whole half-hour shows on special occasions, not just for holidays; as the pilot episodes of CatDog were a triad months before the Wild Thornberrys debuted; Dog Gone/The (unnamed) Fan Mail Short/All You Can't Eat. The Wild Thornberrys had a 2nd theatrical movie in the summer of 2003; Rugrats Go Wild, their crossover with the Rugrats babies and ""growed ups"". As for the first Thornberrys movie, I forgot to mention its bonus features; Retromercials of Charlotte's Web 2, SpongeBob videotapes and DVDs, and the first ones of Jimmy Neutron (the series), an early theatrical commercial (or trailer), a music video by Paul Simon called ""Father and Daughter"" (one of the songs in the movie), and DVD-ROM stuff only good for PCs. Whether or not you have Rugrats Go Wild by itself or in the Rugrats Movie Trilogy set, make sure it doesn't get lonesome if you're also a fan of The Wild Thornberrys. So far, there's no word on when or if Shout Factory will make the whole series into 1 DVD set, besides at Walmart, as of August 2015, as they've already done with Hey Dude, but only at Walmart for now. Wild and crazy, isn't it?",1436918400,,2227,4.683673469387755

1537454,5,B00005JLS5,"I have always enjoyed the Wild Thornberrys.  The premise was cool, the characters were interesting and well-developed (especially as the show moved along), and there was an attempt to portray many different cultures as this family literally traveled around the world.  These attempts weren't always successful, but I'll let that go along with the fact that I could never get a motor home as cool as the one that the Thornberrys had.  When this movie came along, it didn't simply take a half-hour episode's content and stretch it out for the theaters' benefit.  It created a continuation of a story that was perfect for the big screen while allowing the show to subsequently pick up on some of its specific plot threads.  Eliza Thornberry and her Chimpanzee companion, Darwin, witness the abduction of a Cheetah cub by poachers.  Eliza tries to save her four-legged friend but fails and, because of the danger she put herself in in the process, is sent to a British boarding school at the insistence of her overprotective grandmother.  Sure that the Cheetah cub is still alive, Eliza resolves to return to Africa and find him and the poachers before more harm befalls anyone.  That's easier said than done and the movie gives a proper amount of time to all aspects of this plan and the setbacks that come along.  It is also laced with talented guest stars including Rupert Everett, Marisa Tomei, Kimberly Brooks, and Tim Curry, who, in addition to his starring role as Nigel Thornberry, voices his own father...just listen to the family resemblance.  Speaking of Nigel, I think that, in this movie, he proves his capabilities as a father more than in any episode of the show, despite his quirky mannerisms...just listen to his chat with Eliza right before her departure for boarding school...Paul Simon's song is definitely appropriate right after that.  This is a top-notch Nickelodeon project for the big screen and no one should miss it.  Enjoy.",1403049600,4,1947,4.920489296636085
1537455,5,B00005JLS5,"There's plenty of adventure to keep you engaged from beginning to end.

1537567,4,B00005JLS5,"I loved the Wild Thornberry show, and the movie really captures the spirit of it.  I know people either really like or really dislike Eliza, I can see why. she does think that because she can talk to animals she can do anything, and in some episodes in the show, she really messes things up because of it.  But here, even though she does mess up a little bit, I think her actions are quite justified. During this movie, a lot happens.  Not only is she on this epic quest to find a cheetah cub named Tally that was picked up by poachers, but she jumps from a train to save a rhino and then goes on to try to save an elephant herd.  All of these incidents are connected.  I think Eliza's actions, though at times a little drastic where the right choices to make.  I didn't really like some of her choices in other episodes, because I felt she was just tampering with the natural order of things.  But here, she's not really doing that, she's saving animals from poachers, which is an entirely different issue.  Not only that, but she seems to be the only one willing to go after the poachers after they stole the cheetah cub.  Even more willing than the park rangers. She even runs away from boarding school in London, breaking about a million school rules to go back to Africa to do it. I mean, she could have gotten killed, or worse...expelled. (sorry. I had to) Actually, I think after all that she probably was expelled.  She never went back anyway.

Of course it has your typical happy ending, but there is a lot of emotion and even some suspenseful parts in it.  At one point in the movie, Debby (Eliza's older sister) is almost killed by the poachers.  And Eliza herself is nearly killed by them on more than once occasion.  The animation is good too, better than the show's for the most part.  The animals in the show (especially in the early episodes)looked very awkward sometimes. Here they look a little more life like.  The songs are ok too.  I really liked the song called Iwoya.  You can't hear much of it in the movie itself, but the whole song is really good if you want to give it a listen. This Dream is another good one.  The rest were just ok, although Get Out Of London was fun too.

All in all it's a good movie that I think almost anyone can enjoy.  I don't think you would have to watch the show to enjoy the movie, I'd say it can stand alone quite well because they do explain what you need to know right in the opening (which is similar to the show's opening, but a little different) without giving away too much.  This is one of Nickelodeon's best movies in my opinion.",1374537600,2,2594,4.3051546391752575

1537758,5,B00005JLS5,This is a great movie to watch again and again if you are a Rugrats and Thornberry fan.  It will make you laugh at all the funny things the characters say through out the movie.,1351209600,,177,4.057142857142857
1537759,5,B00005JLS5,"This movie has a brave little girl, with an uncoventinal family, who can talk to animals. When a cheeta cub is taken by poachers she feels responsable and takes it upon herself to rescue the cub and reunite it with it's mother. My son loved the variety of animals in this movie. It was a very good family movie.",1350864000,,311,4.288135593220339
1537760,5,B00005JLS5,"I loved the Wild Thornberrys for action, comedy and ... the Wedgie Dance.  It's a fun-filled movie for kids ages 3-10. If you are a brave and adventurous girl you may like it even more.  Also, if you like animals this might be a good movie for you.",1339977600,,248,4.145833333333333
1537761,5,B00005JLS5,"This was one of my favorite shows, even though I was twenty-something when it first aired.  One of my favorite aspects of this show is how we get to travel around the world with Eliza and her family, experiencing different cultures, customs and sometimes languages.  I think I'd have loved this show even without the fascinating 'talking to animals' thing.

This is a great series for getting people interested in other parts of our world.  I also deeply appreciate the way it makes you care about animals/the environment, not in a preachy sort of way, but YOU care because ELIZA and her family care, to the point of being willing to risk their lives.

There is also an awesome movie you absolutely cannot miss out on-it's a whole lot less expensive than the series, and is a good starting point if you want to try a bit of the series before jumping in the water.  You won't be sorry!",1306800000,,884,4.528301886792453
1537762,5,B00005JLS5,Great movie and it's funny and fun for the child in all of us. A great buy for the children who love the Wild Thornberrys and it has a good warm moral message.,1280707200,,159,3.8484848484848486

1537765,5,B00005JLS5,"The Wild Thornberry's Movie is a perennial favorite with my grandchildren. After 2 years the video tape was pretty bad. They were almost in tears when I threw it away - they helped me go online and order the DVD, just to make sure I didn't forget! I don't think they realize all the ""life lessons"" it contains, which makes it a lot easier for me to let them watch it.",1222646400,,367,4.183098591549296
1537894,5,B00005JLS5,This is a great movie for kids.  It stretches the imagination while teaching lessons.  Good pick even for a four year old.,1173744000,,122,4.5
1537895,4,B00005JLS5,"The family (mum, dad, daughter 10, son 8) saw this at the cinema and really enjoyed it. Its works well as a DVD on the small screen as well and has quite a serious storyline, although to honest our kids have only watched it a few times, so perhaps try renting as well. Our children prefered to watch their many hours of TV Wild Thornberry episodes on video instead, as there is far more variety. However this is a very successful movie translation with quite a strong story for kids. It's not unlike Tarzan really with it's England public school sequences. Your children would probably appreciate it more if they are familiar with the TV series (but then they will have probably seen it already), and unfortunately the TV series isn't being screened much at the moment. I think the film will still make perfect sense if you aren't familiar The Wild Thornberries (it's just the exact reason why Eliza can talk to animals that is glossed over). I preferred this movie to the later 'Rugrat's go wild'. It's particularly of interest to a UK audience as Nigel Thornberry is very 1950s English, and a cross between David Attenborough and George Sanders (Sheer Khan in The Jungle Book). Plus any film with Brit Tim Curry involved is always fun (the voice of Nigel). There's also Lynn Redgrave as Cordelia Thornberry - Nigel's mum. The film particularly suites girls as both main leads are girls (although the animal action sequences keep the young men happy). Highly recommended for a 5 to 11 audience (and their parents), particularly as now it's an old title, it's quite cheap.",1166745600,,1572,4.72
1537896,3,B00005JLS5,"The Thornberrys are a delightful family, but there's nothing subtle about this film. It's not bad enough for the bad guys to be poachers; they would also stoop to murdering children to bag a single animal. The lighter side of this story is fun and engaging, and the animation is wonderful. Darwin the chimp is so cute. Is it too much of a challenge to feature the Thornberrys in a more realistic and less violent environmental movie? Teenagers may be too old to appreciate this film's charms, but it's more than tolerable for parents.",1127520000,,534,4.691489361702128

1537898,4,B00005JLS5,"Sweet film. My kids loved it, my 5 year old hasn't stopped talking about the baboon's pink bottom 2 weeks and counting after!
But for all u music fiends and especially all u Paul Simon fans. Buy this DVD for the title track, which is performed end to end by the MAN himself, as an extra on the DVD.
A stunningly simple and yet so brilliant Paul Simon tune about a father's love for his daughter, that I am now single mindedly practicing on the guitar, to be able to sing to my lil girl on Christmas Eve!
Enjoy!",1063756800,2,510,4.161616161616162

The music is rocking and one of the songs that Paul Simon wrote for the picture was nominated for an Academy Award. There really isn't anything very scary in the film and even if you've never seen an episode of the television show, the movie is easy to follow and enjoy.
