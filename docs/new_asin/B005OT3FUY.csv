8481769,4,B005OT3FUY,"Borg is addressing those folks for whom Christian language has become problematic. His point is that words have meaning in context and you must understand the context in which the Scriptures were written to understand the words. Salvation for many fundamental folks has to do with sin, forgiveness, and the afterlife. In it's Biblical context salvation has to do with liberation in this life. This book ought to be a part of every adult education program.",1362355200,2,455,5.0
