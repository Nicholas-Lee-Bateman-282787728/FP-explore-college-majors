932612,5,6304821670,I live in Missouri so the flood of 93 is very real for me.  This movie gives a very real portrayal of the happenings during that time.  It also represents the sacrifice and heroism that was around at that time.,1173398400,5,210,4.225
932613,4,6304821670,"The movie has a good story line and does a good job of showing the resistance Emergency Managers come up against in efforts to mitigate against disasters.  It demonstrates the attitudes individuals in a community have when it comes to responding to a disaster.  The move did get a little sappy in parts and just screams ""Made for TV"", but overall it was an enjoyable, uplifting movie.",1052092800,4,384,4.7164179104477615
932614,3,6304821670,"Based on a true story.  TV movie of the week status aside, this little flick is prety good. Richard Thomas looks like a man now instead of JOHN  BOY and he can still act. Vernon is good in her role and the long lost love  angle works between these two. Great watch with the one you love. The MOVIE  HOUND gives this flick 3 dog bones.",966211200,10,334,4.015151515151516
7877999,5,6304821670,"I watched this movie, as part of the five Disaster movie collection, STORMS OF THE CENTURY. I watched it thinking it was a totally different movie. And was pleasantly surprised by who the actors were and how well they portrayed their characters. I didn't expect to see Richard Thomas, but thoroughly enjoyed his depiction of a grieving widower, a dedicated father, and a town leader. It's a PG family movie for slightly older children. In 2008 there was a horrible devastating flood of the Mississippi and it was heart breaking how badly the towns along its banks stretching from from the North down to the Gulf of Mexico were effected.

In this movie it starts raining and doesn't sto. The dedication of the residents in towns the river is shown, as well as their heartbreak. I remember candidate Obama filling sandbags in Iowa. It's exhausting work. It takes like minded people working towards a common goal. This is a tension filled family drama that was very entertaining.",1510012800,,976,4.844311377245509

7878006,5,6304821670,"Love all the Richard Thomas movies. He sure has come a long way from starring as John Boy on the Waltons... Love his character in this movie.. Glad to have it on VHS, wish it had been available on DVD...",1313539200,,203,4.1
7878007,3,6304821670,"Made for TV and inspired by a true story, Flood takes us to a small town down the Mississippi awaiting disastrous high waters coming from upstream. Not too far fetched considering what happened in Iowa last summer (2008). The script is good, and the execution OK. The main drama, of two kids gone to fetch grandpa from the impending danger and getting stuck right in it, reminded me a lot of Dante's Peak. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of flood damage shown, and the evident amateurism of the levee set. They kept telling us of towns upstream being flooded, but never showed any. CNN's footage of Iowa was much scarier! But overall it's enjoyable.",1232323200,,654,4.598290598290598
7878008,3,6304821670,"Low budget and predictable disaster movie but satisfying enough for true disaster movie buffs.  The casting and acting were decent--unremarkable but realistic special effects, especially when compared to the for real mega floods in the Midwest, summer of 2008.",1213747200,4,260,5.666666666666667
