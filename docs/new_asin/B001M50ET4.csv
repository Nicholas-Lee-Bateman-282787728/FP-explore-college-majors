8320449,5,B001M50ET4,"To understand the significance of Tiger's win at Southern Hills, one must first absord the entire lead up to what amounted to perhaps Woods greatest achievement. Tiger was in position at Augusta, at the Masters, on Easter Sunday, with a chance to win the whole deal. However, for the first time in his career he failed to answer the bell as Zach Johnson instead took his first Major Championship. You'll remember the infamous SI cover with Tiger breaking his club on a tree after a poorly executed shot out of the woods. It was a frustrating defeat to say the least.

Next came the US Open at legendary Oak Mont. Again, Tiger was in position on the Sunday of a Major and was unable to close the deal. What made this a particularly painful loss was the fact that there was an oppurtunity to win for his late Father Earl Woods who had passed away in 2006.  As well, Tiger really played one of his greatest rounds of golf in the 3rd round when he hit on 15/18 greens in regulation. If you were watching that day, I'm sure you were thinking just as I was that he was going to seal the deal the next day. When it ended, it just didn't seem fair.

At the British Open at Carnoustie, Tiger lost it completely. He struggled through his first two rounds of golf and then at the start of his 3rd round he attempted to recapture the magic of Hoy Lake, where he left his driver in the bag. Well, his first shot ended up in the hazard, without trying to over power and use the driver. After the shot he looked about as lost as I have ever seen him and I became a fan of Tigers in the midst of his Majorless drought, so I have seen his struggles, saw them for a long time before I saw him win. Carnoustie was a wash.

Southern Hills. Sight of the 2001 US Open. So you know it's a difficult course. Southern Hills. Jack never won there. Woods and Nicklaus so similar and many believed that Tigers game didn't suit Southern Hills. It wasn't a bombers course. Not only did Tiger intellectually maneuver through the course, he used his super fit body to help him survive the over 100 degree heat, ALL 4 DAYS. His Legendary round on 62 1/2 (officially 63) on the par 70 would be the difference in the championship. However, the way he saved himself in rd 1 from being completely out of it cannot be ignored and his solid play in the 3rd was important as well. The Final Rd was an excellent example of controlled golf. At one time holding a 5 shot lead then watching it dwindle to 1 and having the grace and confidence to catch yourself before you fall completely and work the lead back to 2 and that ending up as the final margin, Woods -8, runner-up Woody Austin -6. Tiger was brilliant.

This Major kept him on track and re-affirmed that he is the most intelligent and fittest golfer on the planet. This may just have been his greatest performance and this dvd is a perfectly dosed out serving of another Masterpiece by Woods. 60 minutes of execellent highlights and perspective.

This is my favorite Tiger victory along with his win at Augusta in 2005, you know ""The Chip!"" year? The win for Pops. This PGA Championship was also the first Major that Sam, Tigers daugter attended. In his words ""She's 1 for 1.""",1250985600,,3193,4.348993288590604
