298623,3,630026906X,"The movie and television industry of the late '60s tried to capitalize on the ""Flower Power""/""Summer of Love""/""Drop Out-Counter Culture..."" by basing entire projects on this new demographic, often with big budgets and big names: for example, the failed Preminger film ""Skido"", also from '68; the first season of the television show ""Laugh-In"", where psychedelia met the ""Borscht Belt"". Ofcourse, the result were usually poor and embarrassing. ""I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!"" has generally good writing and very good acting which elevates its' awkward or dated material, although the key scene involving his fiancee and parents's unwitting use of marijuana, as humorous as it is, even by today's entertainment standards is distasteful; likewise some ethnic and sexual orientation material which today would be inconceivable even for sitcoms. A particularly weak scene involves Sellers visit to Young's workplace, a mod Women's boutique. He still hasn't ""come down"" from the brownie interlude and shows up on an impulse. They flirt a bit until a male customer enters the shop. He is a masculine guy who shocks the giddy Sellers by asking to try on a dress. The reaction is uncontrollable laughter on Sellers' part, while Taylor-Young attempts to make the sale. There seems to be a lack of understanding on the creative end here because instead of TY asserting his ""individuality"", the hey-man-whatever-turns-you-on attitude of the era, she suggests to PS that the outfit might be for a masquerade party.
Despite the shaky foundation, Peter Sellers is astonishing as the ""successful young Jewish lawyer"" about to tie-the-knot. He gets his first real exposure to the Drop-Out folks while (trying to) attend a funeral during a limo drivers' strike - he takes control as chaffeur (in his Mechanic's son's ""hippiemobile"" he had to borrow) and meets his brother's girlfriend, played by Leigh Taylor-Young. She's the one who...bakes the brownies...and sends him reeling in self-discovery amidst new possibilities.
Joyce Van Patten is excellent as Seller's exasperated Secretary/Significant Other, whose we're-not-getting-any-younger attitude finally causes him to capitulate. Her character's amorous reaction to the Alice B. Toklas recipe is notable.
For every high there seems to be a low, however, and the ending is a case in point - the lawyer who seems to ""come to his senses"" following a party which goes haywire at his pad, unexpectedly retreats a second time from the marriage. On the one hand, going ""straight"" would have made for a bland wrap-up, but consider the idea that Van Patten could have turned the tables on *Sellers* by running off with his brother! [I guess we'll save that one for the imagined remake!].
Director Paul Mazursky, well-known for mild but memorable social satire in films like ""Moon Over Parador"", ""Down And Out In Beverly Hills"", and ""The Pickle"" always seems to get the most of out his actors even if the script needs work.
This 1968 release utimately survives by some terrific performances.",1010188800,5,3017,5.248447204968944
298624,4,630026906X,"Peter Sellers is actually fairly toned down in his role as an ""uptight"" Jewish lawyer who decides to join the Counterculture (quite literally, overnight) after ingesting pot brownies and enjoying a roll in the hay with a free-spirited ""hippie chick"" (radiant Michelle Phillips look-alike Leigh Taylor-Young). Despite the dated Hollywoodized trappings of late-60's psychedelia (including the inevitable Party Scene, although interestingly nobody falls into a swimming pool for a change), Paul Mazursky's script is at its heart a serio-comic tale of one man's mid-life crisis. Sellers fans take heart,there are still some supreme comic moments (a very stoned and giggly Sellers trying to ""maintain"" as he watches a straight-faced man getting fitted for a minidress is a definite highlight). The film may have inspired a sub-genre of ""Middle Aged Guy/Free-Spirited Young Woman"" films like ""I'll Never Forget What's 'Is Name"" and the more dramatic ""Petulia"".

This is one of Peter Sellers' least known works---unfortunately.

For those of you who did not experience the counterculture let me say that not one single item in this movie regarding the hippies is an exaggeration. They really did have that constant idiotic smile, had that superficial Eastern philosophy BS, they really did say ""groovy"" and ""I love you"" constantly, constantly used drugs, drove those painted vehicles, dressed in an appealingly outlandish manner. The climax of the movie, when about 40 people crashes in on Sellers' home for days and make themselves at home without a ""by your leave,"" was also typical (you were not expected to be confrontational or ""rude"" and ask them to not come in, or to leave (the hippies were actually a parasitical bunch).",1459641600,,1065,4.916666666666667

298921,3,630026906X,"I LOVE YOU, ALICE B. TOKLAS! (1968) (94 minutes).  A half-forgotten nearly 50 year old comedy from the Peter Sellers catalog that deserves another look.  As written by Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker, and helmed by Hy Averback, this Los Angeles-based biting satire stars  Sellers as a prim, middle-aged Jewish lawyer, a self-admitted 30-something square who decides to "" turn on, tune in, drop out,"" as they used to say.  He jilts his fiance and embraces the 1960s counterculture after falling for a nubile flower child.

Sellers (THE PINK PANTHER, DR. STRANGELOVE), plays Harold Fine, whose dull existence gives way to the hippie lifestyle. Almost immediately after free-spirited Nancy, (Leigh Taylor-Young, PEYTON PLACE), enters his world and unleashes his inhibitions with spiked brownies. Joyce Van Patten, (GROWNUPS, MARLEY AND ME), as Joyce, Harold's secretary/fiance; and Jo Van Fleet, (COOL LAND LUKE, GUNFIGHT AT OK CORRAL, and one tough mother in EAST OF EDEN), as Harold's mother provide fine support.  You should see them bust out into belly laughs after eating the spiked brownies.  David Arkin plays Harold's brother Herbie; Herb Edelman plays Harold's law partner Murray.  Grady Sutton puts in a delicious turn as the funeral director more than inconvenienced by a lightning strike of hearse drivers.

First thing to say about this movie, it's still funny, though perhaps it shows a different, more muted side of its star's comic powers.  Second outstanding fact, along with EASY RIDER, THE GRADUATE, GEORGY GIRL, BLOWUP and Elaine May's HEARTBREAK KID,  made in 1971, a couple of years later, it is an accurate portrayal of the time it was made.  That would be the turbulent, now near mythical 1960s, the decade of sex, drugs and rock and roll.  I've never heard the word ""groovy"" used so many times in my long life.  And you should see the hilarious getup of Joyce's bridesmaids in the scenes of her aborted marriage to Harold.

I actually saw this movie back then in real time when it came out, and don't think I've seen it again since then, until now.  But I do remember musing, even back then, on how short the cinema life of a flavor of the month young actress can be.  There's Taylor-Young with her--get this, ONE tattoo, on her OUTER  THIGH, how daring.  A butterfly, which Sellers identifies as a Monarch.  To dip into the Jewish vernacular, it wouldn't help.  Didn't help Taylor-Young, who soon disappeared from film.  And, I was struck on a re-viewing of the film by just how biting the satire is.  Some may think the Jewish satire is over-the-top, though of course Sellers, and much of the other talent before and behind the camera was Jewish, and I suppose that influenced the picture's content.  Furthermore, today's Hispanic viewers might be offended by some of the content.  Fine is representing the 11-member Rodriguez family in an auto accident case: one morning they all troop into his office, grand-dad down to the kiddies, wearing neck braces.  And the lawyerly Harold points out that all 11 of them were in the car, a clear violation of local law.  And, in addition, there were chickens in the car, an even clearer violation of local law.  Well, the movie's still funny.  You might want to take another look at it if you too saw it way back then.  Or a first look if you enjoy Peter Sellers' work.",1403654400,3,3333,4.858156028368795

Of course we are still paying for those indulgences to this day, but I digress. The movie is actually pretty funny. It is light. And it is a product of its time, so to a great extent it does somewhat capture the mood of the era well - as well as any comedy can, that is to say. And of all the lesser know Sellers films from that decade, it certainly fairs better than The Mouse That Roared or that other flic with those little brats living on Park Avenue - sorry, the name escapes me at present - that is how much I enjoyed that one.

many other choices. Easy Rider was one, with dark vibes and the underworld counterculture. About sizes
it up. Looking for Mr. Goodbar, is also a dark theme. Catch-22, morbid humor, and more theme than one

entertainment needs. The movie is about changes people make, and is funny because of things that happen. It isn't sarcastic or black humor or based on taking pot shots at characters. I Love You

His face was well-worn with sadness most of the time, but could jump from facial stone to high-intense emotion in a matter of seconds.  Few actors can do that now.  In fact, many can't do it.  You have to go beyond your preconceived notion that movies before you were born are 'dated' and go back into a time when Hollywood took chances with movie making.  Now days, it's the same formula over and over until they become so ridiculous, I stopped going to the movies.  I would rather be entertained by quality than by a mass-produced actor machine that produces the same type of actor over and over again.

Included on that list is ""I Love You, Alice B. Toklas"" - a dated yet perceptive counterculture comedy written by Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker. Sellers delivers one of his finest performances as Harold Fine, an uptight Jewish attorney who undergoes a ""groovy"" change of life thanks to an attractive flower child (Leigh Taylor-Young) and some potent brownies.

Not to many extra features except a theatrical trailer, the movie is juicilly remastered... and the dialogue, images and music are really a trip back to the 60's. - - True, the film is best remembered for the hash brownie scene the film starts rolling way before then and keeps on getting better and better starting with the most ""beautiful"" and sub-union scale funeral you've ever been to... of course its hard to top and elderly Jewish couple high on hash and dancing the horah and playing minerature golf.... but that's just the begining of the madness.

Based on a great book with a great premise... an additional surprize about the movie was Peter Seller's ability to act so straight and square... then make the transformation from neurotic square to... to a hippie on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  (Compare to Coburn's role in The President's Analyst.)

Don't rent this one... buy it... I get the munchies for it once every couple of years or so - - its worth the purchase...

(1968) doesn't refer to an actual character in the movie, but to writer Gertrude Stein's literary secretary and lifelong partner, who published a memoir in 1954 titled `The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook' that featured, among other things, a recipe for hash brownies, which figures into the film.  Co-written and co-produced by Paul Mazursky (Down and Out in Beverly Hills), and directed by Hy Averback (The Great Bank Robbery), the film features Peter Sellers (The Pink Panther, The Party, Murder by Death) and Leigh Taylor-Young (Soylent Green, The Big Bounce), in her silver screen debut.  Also appearing is Joyce Van Patten (Pussycat, Pussycat, I Love You), Jo Van Fleet (Cool Hand Luke), David Arkin (The Long Goodbye), Salem Ludwig (Endless Love), and Herb Edelman (The Odd Couple).

Sellers plays Harold Fine, a 35 year old, well-to-do, straight-laced, uptight, squarish type lawyer with commitment issues who soon finds himself engaged to his long time girlfriend/secretary named Joyce (Van Patten) after she basically corners him into finally setting a date for the event.  Harold's obviously unsure of his impending nuptials, even more so after he meets a friend of his younger brother Herbie (Arkin) named Nancy (Taylor-Young), both of whom are free spirited, go with the flow, free loving, flower power hippie types, commonplace on the west coast in the late sixties.  Following a series of comical events the day of Harold and Joyce's wedding arrives (it's a traditional Jewish ceremony, complete with dueling cantors) and Harold's uncertainty results in him bailing on Joyce (in mid ceremony no less), hooking up with Nancy, and trying to embrace the hippy lifestyle completely, growing his hair long, changing his clothes, and giving up most of his possession, except for his Lincoln Continental, which he and Nancy occupy, after sprucing it up with an interesting, psychedelic paintjob.  The bohemian lifestyle seems to agree with Harold at first, as does the regular coupling with Nancy, but eventually the novelty wears off shortly after Harold and Nancy get a real pad, and it becomes a haven for every bongo beating weirdo, poetry reading ne'er-do-well, and flower picking malcontent that happens to stop by...oh, it's a groovy scene, man...

While this film is extremely dated, a sort of time capsule, I thought it was a lot of fun.  As far as Sellers' non Pink Panther features, I wouldn't say this was the funniest, as of the ones I've seen I have yet to find one that made me laugh as much as The Party (1968), which, if you're a fan of Sellers, is worth checking out, if only to hear Sellers, in character, say the phrase ""birdie num nums"".  As far as this film I really didn't find myself laughing out load on a regular basis, but there were some really humorous moments.  The comedy here is low key, and features none of the slapstick found in the Pink Panther films, so if that's what you're expecting you'll probably be disappointed.  One thing about Sellers, in my opinion, is he had a way of getting into a role to the point where you believed he was truly the character, and not so much an actor playing a character.  As I said the comedy here is mostly low key, but generally consistent as conventional, pre-hippy Harold struggles with the distinct generational differences and nonconformist attitudes of those he would eventually try to emulate, followed by a post-hippy Harold diving headfirst into the lifestyle as it allows him freedoms he never had before, along with unfettered access to Nancy.  The best parts of the film for me were the following...

Harold, after dinging up his car, taking it in for repairs and discovering the only vehicle available at the garage for a loaner is a ridiculously painted station wagon owned by the mechanic's son, who has since ran off with a girl to San Francisco.  Subsequently Harold, while attending the funeral of a family friend, finds himself in the awkward position of having to haul the casket to the cemetery as the regular drivers are on strike.  In doing so he gets lost and drives all over hell and high water in his psychedelic ride looking for the cemetery, with the casket sticking out of the back.

Harold, meeting up with his fiance and his parents at his home, and accidentally serving some magic brownies to them, ones made special by Nancy, with an ingredient not specified on the box.

Harold's mother, and her subsequent reaction, after showing up at his pad, which has been overrun with dirty, mooching Bohemians.

As I said, the film is seriously dated (maybe the term `vintage' is more appropriate), but it's entertaining and worth a look if only to see Peter Sellers acting the oddball hippy type.  The long hair, the funky clothes, the goofy medallions, he's got it all...as far as the other performers I thought they all did very well, complimenting Seller's performance well.  Actually, while watching this, I thought of Steve Martin and his role in the film L.A. Story (1991), you know, back when he made comedies that were actually funny.  The movies are certainly different, but a core element, that of an older man trying, unsuccessfully, to bridge the generational gap if only to get with a younger woman, are very similar.  Anyway, if you're interested in a lighthearted, low-key comedy that's slightly absurd, amusing, and even funny at times, this one might be worth a look.  If you're interested in a more straightforward, comically inclined film with Sellers, outside of his Pink Panther roles, then check out The Party (1968).

The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks very clean and crisp on this DVD, and the Dolby Digital mono audio, available in English and French, comes across well.  The only extras included are subtitles in English, French, and Spanish, along with an original theatrical trailer for the film.

299068,5,630026906X,A gem of the 60's era. This movie is so funny and clever that Peter Seller's Pink Panther fame has to be questioned. We love Sellers but found this and THE PARTY to be his best comedic work.,1162512000,4,190,4.026315789473684
299069,5,630026906X,"Some would dismiss this film as a free love era relic.  Perhaps, but this film is so consistently funny.  Credit Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker, this was around the time they were writing for ""The Monkees"", for crafting a script that gently lampoons the counterculture without feeling superior to it.  There are any number of funny setpieces here.  My favorite has to be Mr. Foley's funeral where Harold Fine(Peter Sellers) has to escort the deceased in a psychedelic loaner because the hearse drivers are on strike.  And dig the jello mold with the Star of David centerpiece at Joyce(Joyce Van Patten) and Harold's wedding.  The lunacy here is led by an inspired turn by Sellers.  In a carefully modulated performance, Sellers anchors the film brilliantly.  You are also convinced that Sellers' character would trade in the security of his button-downed lifestyle for a headband and lovebeads.  Great supporting cast includes Jo Van Fleet as Harold's overbearing mother and a stunning Leigh Taylor-Young as Nancy, the hippie chick who convinces Harold to chuck it all and join the movement.  Old time movie fans should note the presence of Grady Sutton, funny in a small bit as the funeral director.",1154044800,5,1200,5.015151515151516
299070,4,630026906X,"I was looking foward to the release of this dvd. The film captures the social feelings of the late 60s, and being that its a comedy, the eras feel is doubly felt by revealing the true, fun, seeming innocence of the generation. Outside of The Pink Panther this is Peter Sellers at his dry, but funny best. The pretty 60s girls are nice to look at in their mini skirts, and you can almost embrace why Harold wants to leave his ""stuffy"" lifestyle. Lee Taylor Young as the love interest is perfectly cast as her hippie magic comforts the viewer. What a time capsule! Some real funny moments, but also a few (by todays standards) dragging moments. A particularly fun watch if you were a teen of that time. Harolds recognition of the emptiness of the free love lifestlye is surprising, as well as his ambiguous return to it. The soundtrack reminds me of the 60s TV show ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" and helps you dive into the period. In some scenes the dvd shows that either the source material or pure age have comprimised the film quality, but overall its decent.  I enjoyed it.",1153612800,,1067,4.471794871794872
299071,4,630026906X,"The 1960s was such a unique decade - a kind of bridge connecting the bizarrely Eisenhower 50s with the polyester Nixon 70s. Watching films from the 60s is equally amusing. I watched ""I Love You Alice B. Toklas"" the other night, the 1968 drama/comedy starring the late-great Peter Sellers.

No multiple roles here for Mr. Sellers, and rarely a moment of slapstick. In fact, it's a serenely subtle performance as Sellers plays an inhibited square lawyer bored with the prospect of spending the rest of his life with his fiancee - a woman who happens to be his secretary. Sellers' character is about as exciting as Darrin Stephens with a hangover. But he's jarred from his straight-laced shell by the appearance of a free-spirited hippie chick who's fond of sitar music and hash brownies.

While hippies had been on the scene for a couple of years by 1968, not too many had been seen in films. But the message, I think, is the key.

A middle-aged, disillusioned man drops out of society to discover himself. He backs out of his wedding, quits his job and lives in the backseat of his car with his young hippie chick (played by the lovely Leigh Taylor-Young). This was a fairly brave stance during an era when society was told to marry, propagate and move to the suburbs.

The keynote moment, and one of the funniest scenes I have seen in a while, happens when Peter Sellers, his fiancee and his parents accidentally sample some hash brownies (made from an old Alice B. Toklas recipe, thus the film's title). This straight-laced crew, tasting drugs for the first time, fall on the floor in fits of laughter, playfully disrobe and eventually decide to play miniature golf. That's right, miniature golf. In some way, a dash of hash has enabled them to loosen up and touch their inner child. Sellers soon discovers the free-spirit path is not for him either, leading to the film's unforgettable final scene.

Paul Mazursky wrote the screenplay to this film, and would soon evolve into one of the greatest film directors no one has ever heard of. Mazursky's resume includes such brilliant works as ""Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice,"" ""An Unmarried Woman,"" ""Moscow on the Hudson"" and ""Enemies: A Love Story."" ""I Love You Alice B. Toklas"" is where it began for this uniquely gifted filmmaker, a man whose works consistently document love, life and America's freedoms. Mazursky embraces the hippie movement of the 60s, but more so, embraces spiritual freedom.

As Altamont and the deaths of Joplin, Hendrix and Morrison revealed by 1971, the hippie movement was not the answer. In some ways, Mazursky already knew this. But with a purity of heart, he essentially said we could all learn something from this important philosophical uprising. I can't help but remember a film review of ""Woodstock"" by Roger Ebert. He profoundly said, ""This was a time when people believed they could change the world with music. Today, it is very, very different.""

When watching ""I Love You Alice B. Toklas,"" I am transported back to that very, very different time.",1117670400,30,3035,4.802681992337165
299072,3,630026906X,"At the heart of this well-intentioned comedy is Peter Sellers, playing a successful American lawyer in his 30s, who is under pressure to finally settle down and marry. Although he seems to be quite the legal mind, Sellers' character is indecisive and has trouble making personal committments. Once he's introduced to late-1960s hippiedom, he falls for a flower girl, leaves his fiancee at the altar, ditches the hornrimmed glasses in favor of granny specs, and looks like a John Lennon doppleganger. Naturally, given the character's indecisiveness, he becomes bored with the hippies and tries to go home again.

Sellers is quite good in this film. His late 1960s acting jobs are usually his weakest, but he does a terrific and funny turn as a man who honestly can't make up his mind. The ""midlife crisis"" angle of the film could be a cliche, but you'd never know it from watching Sellers done up with love beads and Nehru shirts. While I was watching the film, I wanted to see more and more of Sellers' character and less and less of his often contrived surroundings.

As would be expected, much of this film is unfortunately and badly dated. This was a Hollywood attempt to spoof the generation gap, and its attempts to seem daring often come across as simply ""wacky."" Virtually all the supporting characters are cast from cardboard (this is no reflection on the acting), and many of the gags and much of the dialogue are contrived. I was reminded of 1970s sitcoms like ""The Odd Couple"" and ""Welcome Back Kotter"" far too often in certain scenes where we, as the audience, are encouraged to ""get hip with the jive.""

On the other hand, there are some true comedy gems buried in here, including the famous drug-laced brownies gag that would later be stolen and reused in the recent ""Starsky and Hutch"" movie.

Is this classic cinema? No. But this is a movie that will appeal to Sellers fans, late 1960s buffs, and those who'd like to see a different take on the generation gap of the 1960s. This film definitely has its moments and strong points, and I'd like to see it reissued as a budget-priced DVD.",1110326400,6,2101,4.701086956521739

The man was a genius at playing the uptight middle class doltish kinda guy.  And his Harold Fine is the quintessential umcd.  I didn't see this film until the late 80's.  My brother & I were stoned one night and just laughed our asses off.  It was amazing how the film had retained its comic force after 20 years.  After viewing it I gave it a few years and wondered if it wasn't just the added effect of the drugs but I saw it again stone cold sober and still lmao.  Some of the 60's hippie-era stuff probably hasn't aged well but Sellers can't be denied.  I think along with his brilliant triple-shot in Dr. Strangelove this is his best work.  The film also benefits from its terrific supporting cast including Jo Van Fleet, Joyce Van Patten & Leigh Taylor Young(giving arguably the best of films many spaced-out hippie portrayals).

The story is about a stereotypical Jewish lawyer whose stereotypical Jewish family wants him to marry a certain woman, but before that happens, he meets a hippie girlfriend of his hippie brother, and she bakes him Alice B. Toklas brownies, and the lawyer eats one and trips out. But it is not merely the effects of eating the brownies (the rest of the lawyer's relatives eventually do the same) that makes the lawyer decide to drop out and try the hippie life; he was already disillusioned with his old life to begin with. But will he find happiness among other hippies?
