8005988,5,B00013NDN2,"I found this to be a very entertaining movie. Yes, the music is excellent, and yes like most music movies the storyline is unrealistic.  However, like most movies about young men growing up, it is more about how we wished things had happened instead of how things really happened.  We read about stories like this or hear them from our friends and I can tell you that I don't believe more than half the story, but that's entertainment.  I grew up in the 60's and so the music and conservative spanish setting was a ""blast from the past"".",1375747200,,537,4.459183673469388
8005989,1,B00013NDN2,"This film is set in the sixties in Cadiz, Spain. Young medical students share a house and frequent a bar where they hook up with some prostitutes. The whores move in with them and rock their lives a bit. The boys end up contracting a venereal disease and all hell breaks loose. I found the film stupid because in reality, young boys from a good wealthy family would never glorify and worship worthless whores. In the end, the most conservative of the boys leaves his studies to become a doctor to be with one of the whores. Totally out of character. This made no sense. However, the music on this was pretty cool.",1116892800,2,613,4.433628318584071
