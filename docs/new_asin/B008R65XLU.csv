5179022,4,B008R65XLU,"I bought this just to get a copy of Shepherd of the Hills. It's a good cut of a good movie with good acting. I've heard that the movie doesn't do the book justice. That is often the case, I know. Nevertheless, not having read the book, the movie was fine.",1411516800,,255,4.019607843137255

5179024,4,B008R65XLU,"If you are a John Wayne fan, you'll love this DVD. It combines two movies from late in John Wayne's career, with two much earlier westerns.  I had never seen The Spoilers or Shepherd of the Hills, but definitely wanted to own the other two movies.  I really enjoyed those relatively early movies; plus two of my all time favorite Wayne westerns!",1403568000,3,345,4.548387096774194
5179025,5,B008R65XLU,"My family was having a John Wayne marathon and we needed ""Shepard of the Hills""
It also stars Harry Carey, father of Harry Carey jr. who you see in so many Wayne films.
Marjorie Main, as you rarely saw her(no frazzeled mom) It is a folksy movie.  About family, love, trust,
and bitterness.  Lots of old time stars too.  You won't be sorry to view thie movie or any of the others on the disc.",1403136000,4,391,4.1866666666666665

5179027,5,B008R65XLU,"Was somewhat skeptical of 4 feature length films on 2 discs, but the movies all played flawlessly and the color was  as good as any movie I have in my collection.  Recommend this deal, I had not seen the Sheperd of the Hills, but was very pleased with the movie. I have been to  Branson, Mo and seen the Sheperd of the hills outdoor presentation and was very happy to add this to my collection.",1397001600,3,394,4.226666666666667
