1111278,3,6305972370,"I saw this movie when it was first released to the theaters and 2 or 3 times on tv since. The acting by Oates was typical of him. It seems that he played the same type character in all his movies. Taylor and Wilson just  plain didn't act, no personality or character to relate to. There was a  very thin plot. For people that love cars like I do, enjoy this film. The  competition between the old hot rod and the sleek new factory built  hi-performance car makes this an intriging movie.",939686400,,487,4.260869565217392

1111474,5,6305972370,"This is KILLER. Fairly accurate for the time I am told. Some Hollywood stuff that is false, but that is the movie business. You can NOT have a street strip drag car race cross country!!! Not built for it at all LOL.

In my opinion, it is a Crime that this movie isn't A. Cheaper and B. More Available ALL Over the USA! Be sure to check out Vanishing Point 1971 & the American Grafiti Movies (yes there were a few, i.e. ""More American Grafiti"")!

This movie is done up in a very unique style. I would highly recommend, at least once, that you go through ALL the review on this DVD, including the second one!!!  Share this movie with others, because there is a good chance they have not seen it at all or in decades! This is one of those car movies that is not all that common to come across. Other than ""B movies"" the only other thing I can come up with that is rare like this is ""Vanishing Point 1971."" It is not as rare, but it too is hard to come across! The hardest to come across would be: ""WW and the Dixie Dance Kings starring Burt Reynolds 1975."" As of 2015, this film has not been released on DVD or any other home video format. I was told it was on VHS tape years ago, but it is Extremely hard to find!

Two Lane Blacktop is a cool movie. It is not perfect, but it is nearly one of a kind. For the most part, the movie is all about cars, traveling on the open road, racing, ego or false sense of self (GTO and the concept of Total Freedom), and people. It is also a trip back in time to a easier era where many could and did hitch-hike. It allowed me to have a partial view of what it was like back then. Lastly, be sure to watch it a few times, as like many movies, you will pick up on different things the next time around. If you were not alive then or near then like me, watch it with someone who was as they can point out things and share their own memories of that period and those activities.

For sure it's a handsome production with a nice turn by the late great Warren Oates but matters aren't helped by the rank amateurs (James Taylor, Dennis Wilson, Laurie Bird) cast in key roles.

1111494,3,6305972370,"For me, this movie worked as a piece of nostalgia, and as an opportunity to see some very cool period cars.  Where it didn't work, was the weak metaphor, and even weaker acting.
  Quite a few scenes in the movie reflect an America that has vanished for the most part.  No doubt many of the physical structures still exist, but the social context is gone.  When the film was released in 1971, America was at the height of the Vietnam war, and was still wrestling with civil rights issues, among other things.  To me, that time was reflected in the character's ""what's it all for?"", aimless wandering that we see throughout the movie.  From my perspective, ""Easy Rider"" was much more effective at portraying that kind of mentality, and more iconic of the era.  Taylor's ""Driver"" comes off as an overly serious (to the point of being silly), brooding individual, with nothing of importance to say.  Through most of the film he is staring straight ahead, or giving a potential rival his ""mad dog"" look.  Likewise, Wilson's ""Mechanic"" character adds little to the story, and delivers his lines like ""I gotta check the jets, valves, and carbs"" in a way that makes it easy to visualize him working at a restaurant, and saying ""the fries aren't ready yet"", complete with a paper hat, and greasy apron.  Obviously, both men excelled in the music world, just not in the acting world so much.  This was the only role either had in their careers, to my knowledge, and I think that's a good thing.  I found myself tuning out the dialogue between these two, and paying more attention to the cars.  Laurie Bird did appear to have some acting talent, but her character is never developed.  Seeing her in one of her other movies might give a better indication of her acting ability? Warren Oates' ""GTO"" persona was the most interesting from my perspective.  During the film, we actually find out more about him than anyone else.  Even as a pathologic liar, I still felt like he had more depth than the other characters in the film.
  The movie certainly has some merit, but I don't see how some of the other reviewers saw this as ""deep"".  For those of us that love classic cars, I think it's worth watching it for that alone.",1444780800,2,2208,4.584183673469388

1111653,5,6305972370,"If there was ever a movie filmed in what today would be called ""indie style"" yet captures the heart and soul of the people it portray's, Two Lane certainly qualifies. The realism that car builder Richard Ruth captured and shared with the audience with the '55 Chevy is spot-on. I've driven many cars like this one, and the sounds, sights and feeling comes right through to the viewer, making this a no-joke proposition.

Movie trivia: the star car from Two Lane is the car later used in American Graffiti, but what Monty Hellman did with it and his select cast of actors in this movie is a true slice of life. Right from the opening scene featuring the L.A. Street Racers to the final race on an abandoned airfield, Two Lane typifies the life of a street racer in the 1970's.

1111655,5,6305972370,"As the film opens we meet the Driver (James Taylor) and the Mechanic (Dennis Wilson). They live to race and race to live. We never learn their names nor their relationship to each other. The Girl (Laurie Bird) joins them by removing her duffel bag from another guy's car and moving it to their car. Where are you heading? she asks them. East, the Mechanic replies. Her name, we learn, may be Higgins. They encounter another driver, GTO (Warren Oates), and engage him in a cross-country race for pink slips. GTO talks about himself a great deal, but because he contradicts himself at every turn we learn nothing about him. Other characters (hitchhikers, drag racers, a grieving grandmother, a driver in a fatal accident) drop in, ghost-like, just long enough to register their presence. We learn nothing about them. And then there are the cars. Two of them are given cast credits. They are a custom 1955 Chevy and a stock 1970 Pontiac GTO. We learn far more about them than we do any of the human characters. Along the way the Girl plays musical fellas and the fellas play musical cars. There's a whole hell of a lot of racing and a whole hell of a lot of going nowhere.

This film defies conventional criticism. The cinematography is gritty, stark, and beautiful. Warren Oates is brilliant. James Taylor flubs a few of his lines; somehow this lends his character depth. Dennis Wilson's performance, while lacking polish, is fascinating and compulsively watchable. Laurie Bird's character is easy on the eyes but hard on the psyche; her departure comes as a relief, even if it is in the penultimate scene. And when the film ends, it literally ends.

Two-Lane Blacktop seems awfully meaningful, but its meaning eludes me. I watch it again and again, each time hoping that this time it will reveal its secrets. But it always leaves me mystified and frustrated, every single time. Oh, how I love this movie.",1399766400,3,1903,4.746223564954683

I bought it out of curiosity to see Dennis Wilson acting and realized while watching it how important it is as a genre film and a turning point in American movie making.

1111754,2,6305972370,"""Two-Lane Blacktop"" is about two men, Driver and Mechanic (singer-songwriter James Taylor and the Beach Boys' Dennis Wilson in their only acting roles), accompanied by a tagalong girl (Laurie Bird), who make their way across America, picking up racing bets on the side.  Along the way, they meet GTO (Warren Oates) and challenge him to a cross-country race.  The prize:  their cars' pink slips.

The race takes them through a landscape filled with gas stations, roadside diners, and blacktop highways.  As the film -- and the race -- goes on, director Monte Hellman has his characters meander a great deal, stopping here and there, as if neither driver is in much of a hurry to win.  In fact, the initial drama of the race soon dissipates into a kind of existential look at obsession, freedom, and purpose.  The central characters have apparently more time on their hands than they can handle and they seek excitement in a race but then get endlessly sidetracked. We learn little about the characters and after investing time watching, wonder why we bothered.  The road movie is a staple of American cinema, but ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" leaves the viewer confused about its point.

Blu-ray bonus extras are abundant, and include two audio commentaries; an interview with Monte Hellman, actor James Taylor, and musician Kris Kristofferson; screen test outtakes; a featurette about the restoration of the '55 Chevy used in the movie and the film's locations; and photos and publicity materials from the film.",1356912000,4,1501,5.044534412955466

Warren Oates is good and Laurie Byrd is definitely cool in it. James Taylor is ok but Dennis Wilson is pretty good.

1111783,1,6305972370,"Now some people love this movie as one of those existential exploration of the American obsession with driving and cars and the road. It has a lot of people speaking in monotones with bored tones in their voices and they are all just driving around and there's really no storyline. Some characters start out interesting but they just settle into the tedium of the whole driving experience. In fact, this movie captures the road trip in great detail - except as the driver where you can't sit in the back and read or sleep or pretend that something else is happening besides endless stretches of freeway.

And while that might be worth a look, it's also one of those movies where nothing much happens. While Stanley Kubrick and Terence Malick have made careers out of movies where nothing much happens, they usually have enough visual intensity or obsessions to bolster the fact that their movies are slow and often boring (useless alpha males and spiritual malaise respectively).

In the case of this movie, it's just a lot of driving. James Taylor has hair. Someone quotes the lyrics to GTO which makes the Beach Boys seem cool in that surfer dudes gone to pot way that they are supposed to awesome. But essentially this is one of those overrated movies like Easy Rider in which the reputation and the rock star credibility hides the fact that there really isn't much going on.

Some people like it, but I really don't understand what they are getting at.

This is a gem so many don't know about. This film is about the synergistic relationship, not only between a driver and his mechanic, but with an insecure peculiar older man (Warren Oates) and with a freewheeling cupcake (Laurie Bird) who tag along. It's the '55 Chevy that binds them all together because so much gravitates to it. The car demands the attention from all of the characters in the film and although one would assume the car to be the protagonist, this film is really about different characters coming together and affecting one another for a day or two and then back to the way things are before they meet. There is no real story. You as the viewer are drawn into a world where there is no conflict or drama which would ultimately lead to a chain of events culminating to a surprise ending or an ending you expect or don't expect.

There are no surprises, it's only you and them racing, taking a lesson on driving stick, poking fun at each other and then just breaking apart. I love this film and how its directed, there is a grittiness about the way it's shot that compliments the subject, the characters, and even the car. There is something playful about all these characters that draws you to them and the wonder of Warren Oates' character in this film is to be remembered.

To call it understated would be understated.  There is dialogue though in fact and a fair amount of it, but it's largely so devil-may-care in terms of relationship development and goals, that it's no wonder the film is branded existential - that and the way it ends.  Again, it's probably not gonna satisfy viewers who are looking for the traditional version of entertainment. But for a slice of life postcard from 1971 Two-Lane Blacktop gives you something to chew on.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a movie that uses racers and the 'two guys and a chick on the road' scenario that actually creates real tension and suspense on the road, with a firecracker of an ending, it's hard to beat ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"" from 1974.",1309046400,2,1050,4.5828877005347595

The American Graffiti '55 Chevy
THE HISTORY
55 Chevy The story of the American Graffiti '55 Chevy began in 1970 when three 1955 Chevy 150 sedans were built for the 1971 movie Two-Lane Blacktop by Richard Ruth of Competition Engineering in Sunland, California (Jay Eshbach sent in information in 2010 that the cars were built before Ruth moved the shop to Sunland, when it was located at 8217 Lankershim Blvd. in North Hollywood.) Ruth patterned the cars after his own big-block '55 Chevy street racer after Two-Lane Blacktop/American Graffiti/Star Wars producer Gary Kurtz went street racing with Ruth while preparing for Two-Lane Blacktop. After that evening, Kurtz ordered two cars just like Ruth's '55 and a third '55 to be used as a stunt car. While Ruth was building the '55s, the studio arranged for General Motors to deliver three big block crate motors to his shop. One of the '55s received a leftover 1969 L-88 427 Chevy big block while the other two were equipped with the new 454s. Ruth installed a Weiand tunnel ram with dual Holleys on the two main cars, and a single four barrel on the stunt car. The stunt car had a full rollcage and was equipped with a Ruth-designed right and left braking system so it could be intentionally thrown into a skid and rolled over for a scheduled rollover scene. Ruth delivered all three cars to the studio painted powder blue, but the studio had them finished with a gray primer appearance to fit the persona of the drag racers played by James Taylor and Dennis Wilson.

The studio equipped one of the two main cars with brackets to support the cameras for filming interior shots while the actors were driving. The other main car was used for the exterior shots of the car on the road. All three cars were used during the cross-country shoot on Two-Lane Blacktop and appear in the film to sharp-eyed observers. The original script called for the '55 to roll over as it swerves to avoid a car wreck between a station wagon and a truck. Instead, the driver just ran off the road and did not roll over. Ruth surmises the film crew did not include anyone with the skills necessary to roll the car over exactly as needed in one take using his right/left braking setup. Since it had not been rolled over as scheduled, the stunt car stayed with the film crew for the entire filming from Los Angeles to the Great Smokey Mountains.

When filming on Two-Lane Blacktop was completed, the three '55 Chevys were relegated to the Universal Studios prop car storage lot. A studio mechanic spotted the three '55 Chevy hot rods on the back lot and bought the camera car since it was in the best condition of the three. He pulled out the Chevy big block for use in a boat and his son ended up with the car. The son repainted the car white with a candy-colored stripe down the sides and over the back, dropped in another 454, and drove it to high school as a daily driver. The car saw movie duty again when, during filming of Smokey and the Bandit, it was used to record motor sounds that were dubbed in for the TransAm. The '55 was sold to a new owner and it then passed through a succession of owners until 2000 when it was located in Canada. It has since returned to the United States where it has been returned to the on-screen appearance with most of its original components intact - including some of the original camera mounting brackets that had been welded to the frame.

While preparing for American Graffiti, transportation supervisor Henry Travers picked up the two remaining Two-Lane Blacktop '55 Chevys from the studio storage lot. He had both cars painted black and removed the left/right braking system on the stunt car so it could be driven as a ""camera car"" because it had an automatic transmission and would drive more smoothly for any close-ups of the actors inside the car. The stunt car was used in the crash scene at the end of American Graffiti where it was towed for the rollover. Travers brought in a non-running, salvage yard '55 to use as the ""burn"" car. The burn car was actually a 2-door hardtop with a piece of wood fastened in place to give the appearance of a 2-door post. As soon as the scene was finished, the burn car was sent back to the salvage yard.

After filming on American Graffiti was finished, the inventory of studio-owned cars was assigned to Travers for disposal. He removed the drive train and front sheet metal from the stunt car and sold the remains to a California stock car racer who was interested in the battered car since it had a full roll cage. The racer stored the car in a friend's salvage yard where it sat for several years. Due to a zoning dispute, the salvage yard was eventually forced to clear out some of the inventory and the remains of the stunt car was sent to the crusher. The other '55 Chevy sat in Henry Travers' front yard for over a year before it was eventually sold to Sam Crawford, who owned it when it was featured in a May 1976 issue of Street Rodder magazine with other notable ""Graffiti"" cars.

Steve Fitch of Wichita, Kansas bought the Graffiti '55 from Crawford in the late 1970s. Fitch later bought the yellow '32 Ford Coupe driven by Paul LeMat's character ""John Milner"" in a sealed bid sale from the studio after More American Graffiti was completed. He owned both cars when he and the two most famous cars from American Graffiti were profiled in an October 1983 Car Craft magazine article. Fitch did a meticulous, detailed restoration of the '55 to American Graffiti trim, and is credited with preserving the Coupe in as-is condition from the filming.

When Fitch later put both cars up for sale, the '55 wound up in Maryland in the hands of the current owner, Wayne Newsom, and the '32 Coupe returned to the San Francisco area with Rick Figari. The '32 Coupe has continued to be carefully preserved by Figari and many ""movie prop"" features on the car are still visible - such as holes drilled in the frame and brackets welded on for the camera mounts. Figari is committed to preserving the Coupe because, in his view, it will only be original once.

THE CAR
Shortly after the '55 was shipped to Maryland, it received an extensive frame-off modification as a show car and its appearance and originality was radically changed from when it was used in American Graffiti. There remain, however, several visible details on the Graffiti '55 that point to the authenticity of the car, in addition to its well-documented history.

  * In both movies, and today, the car has distinctive radiused rear wheelwells

  * In Two-Lane Blacktop, the car's trunk was lift-off fiberglass and held in place with ""hood pins"" on the upper corners and in the center of the lower edge below the trunk emblem. In American Graffiti, the pins can still be seen on the car. The trunk on the car is now hinged, but the original brackets used to mount the pins are still in place on the top corners and the spots where the holes in the trunk lid were filled are still visible if you look closely.

  * In both movies, you can see the tube front axle and chrome radius rods under the front of the car. In the magazine articles, the car is shown with the tube axle, the the 4-link setup, and the coil-over suspension. The car still has the same axle, which was custom built by Richard Ruth, although the other components have been changed. 55 engine shot

  * In Two-Lane Blacktop, there are several good shots of the big block 427 engine, the Weiand tunnel ram, and the headers. The Street Rodder and Car Craft articles also show the engine and headers. There were no shots of the engine compartment in American Graffiti, most likely because the film was set in 1962 and the only big block Chevrolet engine then available was the 409. The car is thought to still have the same L-88 427 engine, and is still equipped with the headers that were fabricated by Richard Ruth and are unique to the car, although the original Weiand tunnel ram and the hydraulic throttle linkage installed by Ruth have disappeared.

  * In Two Lane Blacktop the car had front bucket seats, a white headliner, fiberglass doors with sliding plexiglass windows, a roll bar, and no rear seat. In American Graffiti , the bucket seats were replaced with a bench seat, the fiberglass doors and plexiglass windows were replaced with stock steel doors and rollup windows, the roll bar was still in place, the headliner was still white, and the rear seat area was covered with a white ""tonneau"" cover from the top of the bench seat to the package tray. The original old-style Covico three-spoke steering wheel is clearly visible, too. The car's current interior represents the biggest change from the car as seen in the two movies. 55 plate The car now has a full red/gray leather interior, the steel doors are equipped with power windows, the roll bar is gone, a stock '55 steering wheel has replaced the Covico wheel, and Bel Air trim and gauges have been added to the dash.

  * In the 1983 Car Craft magazine article, the '55 is pictured with the Kansas license plate ""GRAF 55."" The plate is still on the car since it has never been titled or licensed in Maryland.

  * In Two-Lane Blacktop there is a gas station scene in which the attendant is seen filling the gas tank after the fiberglass trunk lid was removed. The gas tank filler neck was accessed through a hole cut in the floor of the trunk on the driver's side close to the rear bumper. That hole is still there, but covered by a sheet metal plate that has been fastened to the floor of the trunk from underneath. Richard Ruth also appeared in this scene. He's the mechanic wearing the Glendale Speed Center T-shirt who strolled out to look at the car.

Although many changes have been made to the '55 since its days as a movie prop, Richard Ruth has examined detailed photos of the car and has verified that the car is one of the originals that he built for Two-Lane Blacktop and went on to fame as Falfa's American Graffiti '55 Chevy.

We likely got some great songs out of his wilder days. I love his music and I love anything with old cars in it but this IS bad. I couldn't finish it after two trys.

1111815,2,6305972370,"An LA snob friend of mine said I HAD to see this movie.  She knew I grew up in the Midwest and was a kid when the muscle car 1970s was in full swing.  I hung around in the garages with centerfolds and old cars and motorheads guzzling beer and tinkering under hoods.

So I watched this movie.  And I have no idea what I was supposed to like about it.  Cool cars, okay.  But after about ten minutes of watching non-actors doing some non-acting (except for Warren Oates, who, well, drives a lot), I could not figure out what I was supposed to like about this movie.

I also grew up watching movies like VANISHING POINT; DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY; CANNONBALL (not THE CANNONBALL RUN); AMERICAN GRAFFITI; heck, even SMOKEY & THE BANDIT...and those may have been cheap drive-in movies...but they at least DID SOMETHING.  Characters, plot, dialogue, gags, stunts.  Low-brow and obvious, but I didn't scratch my head and wondered what the heck was even going on like I did suffering through TWO LANE BLACKTOP.

So I told my LA snob friend that I didn't like the movie because mabye--just maybe--someone who's actually rode in those cars, ate in a country diner, waited on the mechanic in the rain somewhere in the Midwest--wouldn't find these scenes all that compelling.

Oh.  I get it.  There wasn't supposed to be a POINT.  That's the point!  Got it.  Well, forget that.  Where the heck is Dom DeLuise?",1282867200,9,1394,4.6016260162601625

The movie does move slow in some places but very well done for the 1970's. No green screen special effects, just plain filming on the fly.

1111817,5,6305972370,"The title says it all. A stripped down,lean existentialist movie. Two cars race each other to Washington DC.But it's the journey rather than the destination or arrival that's important. The Driver and the mechanic,James Taylor and Dennis Wilson, speak little dialogue, but you see them a lot, as they set themselves up as the Best, taking on all other road racers, usually on race tracks. They pick up a girl who hitches with them. Warren Oates provides the main competition and charismatic core of the film. He coninually talks and hustles and competes even for the girl. They develop a kind of respect and camaraderie with the older man, a spirit of the open road, while still competing with him,the younger musicians become a foil to his superb acting master class.

GTO(Oates) picks up different hitch hikers,subtly changing his story about his destination with each one,the troupers,the hippy,the molester,the old lady. He at one point gets stopped by police, for speeding but carries on. There are frequent stops for petrol,drinks etc. The randomness, and gritty flavour of the road is real. The young girl hops off with a biker, after having fired all the competitors up. This film has acquired a cult status, due to being out of circulation for 30 years, and also because of its undiminished excellence. At the end the celluloid seems to burn up, summing up the whole philosophy of the film. One for the collections.",1272153600,4,1424,4.933333333333334

FILM REVIEW:  Excellent film!  If you are from that era and were a teenager in the late 1960s, or, therefore, a young adult in the early 1970s, you will feel that this film is SO right-on.  If you are not from the era but are interested in the culture of that time period, then you should watch this film.  Either way, it is, indeed, a Cult Film.  The ending was a little mystifying, but I believe it seemed that way, only because there was probably meant to be a Part 2.  Production was excellent; characters were excellent.  One who is not from that era might find it all a bit strange, especially the non-communicative attitude of James Taylor's role.  But, that is so much how guys were then.  And, even the girl who decided to hit the road.  She was beautifully played.  That is exactly how it happened for many a young person then.  Whatever happened to that actress?  Even Warren Oates' character, as an older person, sort of washed up and lost, was right-on of the time period.  He was a little older, and had some savy that the others did not, and he had some money, or the capability of getting some more money (that's how he ended up with the girl).  It was all done very well.  Also, if one is not interested in the culture of the time period with respect to individuals and their emotions and the games they played, and how hard it was to find a place in the world, it happens to be an excellent portrayal of all the small townsfolk along the way, and just how ready they were to drag-race with anybody ""driving through their territory in a hot car.""  It was an unwritten challenge; everyone felt THEIR ride was the best!",1263772800,2,2050,4.427807486631016
1111831,3,6305972370,"It's fair to say that Two-Lane Blacktop is not your typical road movie. The film focuses on a cross-country race that pits James Taylor and Dennis Wilson against Warren Oates. Laurie Bird stars as a hitchhiker who cannot decide whose side she wants to take in the race.

What sets Two-Lane Blacktop apart is that it offers the viewer no easy answers. Arguably, the film offers the viewer not much of a story, period.

The four characters all spend their lives in action. Nothing that they do, however, makes any difference; that is why this is an existential film. Oates is the standout as the middle-aged character known only as  GTO (after his car). GTO picks up a string of hitchhikers with whom he tries to establish a bond by telling outlandish, self-aggrandizing lies. The hitchhikers never ride with the overbearing Oates for long. The only hitchhikers to reach their intended destination are going to a cemetery; consider the symbolism in that.

The rest of the cast is unimpressive. Taylor and Wilson are not uniformly terrible, but they are both wooden in many of the scenes. Bird is OK, but her character is poorly developed.

Car freaks will love seeing all of the vintage ""muscle cars"" in this film. Two-Lane Blacktop also contains some incredible landscapes. The shots that I enjoyed the most, however, were those of a vanished America; we see the gas stations, diners, and main streets of yesterday throughout the film.

If viewers can stand a movie that goes nowhere, Two-Lane Blacktop is worth a look. This film certainly is different. Viewers may find, however, that the film's lack of a narrative is frustrating.",1263772800,2,1631,4.870036101083032
1111832,5,6305972370,"I was lucky enough to see this movie when it first came out....at a drive in theater in Corpus Christi, TX in 1971.  So I feel a certain ownership for this fantastic flick.  As time goes by, I enjoy it more and more.  Director Monte Hellman is a master of film noire, the actors are perfect for their roles, and the technical details of the cars, hot rodding and racing are spot on.  I'm totally absorbed every time I watch Two Lane Blacktop.  Get the collector edition in the tin, one of the extras is the commentary by Hellman and the producer which is fascinating.  Although American Graffiti, Thunder Road and The California kid are good, this movie is in a higher class of its own.",1260662400,2,686,4.404761904761905
1111833,4,6305972370,"Even more plotless than ""Vanishing Point,"" ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" was made for less than $1 million.  Two drag-racing slackers played alternately weirdly, awkwardly, high and/or stiff by musicians James Taylor and Dennis Wilson, race cross-country on legendary Route 66 road against drifter Warren Oates in his finely tuned GTO.

Bizarrely, what was a pure asphalt and machine dream, shifts gears and turns into a competition for the favors of unappealing hippie Laurie Bird.

Even so, Monte Hellman's off-beat existential film has become a highly-regarded piece of cinema art here and in France by a sub-culture of fiercely dedicated cin&eacute;astes primarily because of its minimalist style and references to ""pure cinema.""

In other words, this is a movie about movies.  The asphalt, or two-lane blacktop, is a metaphor for the 35MM film-strip unspooling in the projector.  It takes you places while you sit still -- just like the on-screen drivers experience the ever-changing landscape through their ""widescreen"" windshields.  But at the end of the dream (for that's what film experience is), the movie reminds the viewer that this is merely a figment, only shadows on the screen, and it's time to wake up.  Then abruptly, the last frame of the film freezes and, literally, melts off the screen, leaving the audience to navigate its way along the landscape we all must traverse.

Although this movie is more bleak and joyless than I remember those days, it does have a certain realism about it that grabs you. What a lot of younger people probably don't realize is how common street-rods and street racing was back in the 70s. It was nearly everywhere, and in my area (Southeast N.E.) quite organized. There wasn't as much money around back then, or easy credit. But the muscle cars were fast, serious, and many of them hairy and radical as hell. I'm not trying to promote anything,.... just reminiscing. This film both grabbed me and disappointed me at the same time, which parallels the story itself. I think it could have been a lot better. But it seemed to be so deadly serious about being taken seriously, that I think it adversely affected it's balance. The film-maker dove deep, metaphors flying.

TWO-LANE BLACKTOP is a brilliant character study, an amazing detour from the souped-up engines and over-inflated egos that commonly drive your basic hot rod flick.  I love how it refuses to brake for the casual viewer expecting a basic, testosterone-injected thrill ride.  This movie scorches a trail of burnt rubber and broken dreams, haphazardly en route toward the rapidly beating heart of the American consciousness.

This story consists of four main characters.  I love how their names are never mentioned.  This almost mystical ambiguity somehow exhudes a certain broad appeal.  They could be anybody.  And nobody.

the driver--James Taylor
the mechanic--Dennis Wilson
the g.t.o.--Warren Oates
the girl--Laurie Bird

All of these people are drifters, roaming from town-to-town, possibly searching for something. Or maybe they're running from their past.  The driver & the mechanic get somehow mixed up with a young, beautiful hitchhiker.  She's a bit of a monkeywrench to their plans, but really the guys don't let her distract them from their true love--their '55 Chevy.
That car is also a major character in the film.  It's different shades of primer gray, which is of course very symbollic.  Neither of the two guys feel very comfortable unless they are behind the wheel or underneath the hood, respectively.  The group rides together across the country, searching for their next race and payday.
They constanty cross paths with the driver of a flashy yellow G.T.O.  He is an older man, who is constantly picking up eccentric hitchhikers himself.  After a bit of a confrontation at a gas station, their competitive rivalry steers both cars toward Washington D.C. and the ultimate prize--the loser's pink slip.  The journey is fascinating and totally revealing.

This Criterion DVD includes a 110-page screenplay.  Really this script is what makes this film truly special.  I was totally engaged watching the driver & mechanic bait some unsuspecting driver into a race for cash.  Here's one such moment(paraprased):

""Clean machine"".
(It's clean enough.)
""Not bad for home grown"".
(It's a little bit more than home grown.)
""Gee mister, it must be pretty quick.""
(You wanna find out?)
""Usually I'd jump at the opportunity, but I'm not in the habit of seeing the Chevy work against a two-bit piece of junk.""
(Fifty bucks says I leave you in the dust.)
""Make it 3 yards ($300) m%$#@r and we'll have ourselves an automobile race.""

Gotta love it!

Really, TWO-LANE BLACKTOP is just first-rate filmmaking.  From the music, the sounds, the script, the acting, the direction....all just incredible.  This low-budget affair immediately gets jump started into my top 20 favorite films of all-time.  It's absolutely perfect with its imperfections.

1111850,4,6305972370,"Very unusual and engaging, despite the fact that the plot is flimsy, the dialog is minimal, and almost nothing is explained. Except for Warren Oates' character, the roles are hardly developed. The hippie chick hitchhiker who uses men and spits them out is a misogynist stereotype of the era. And yet, there's humor and social commentary here, as well as an interesting inside look at the pre-NASCAR world of hot-rods and drag racing. I don't own a car and I can't tell a Chevy from a Ford, so for me it's not about the cars, it's about the atmosphere. The cinematography is beautiful, as the drivers cruise through the seedy Southwest and South of the early 1970's. Warren Oates gives a brilliant performance as a transparently pathetic, alcoholic, compulsive liar/loser. Dennis Wilson, the Beach Boys drummer, who had never acted before, had matinee-idol good looks, is a natural on camera and could have had a film career. Singer James Taylor, as much as I love his music, is stiff and awkward here. No matter -- the movie beautifully evokes a time period and a subculture, and depicts personal alienation in a way that is unexpectedly profound. If you were raised on action flicks and special effects, you will probably cry with boredom and find this film incomprehensible.

Although I wouldn't normally say this when describing how I feel about a film but I love the way the movie distances the characters from the audience. Dennis Wilson and James Taylor's lack of acting experience actually adds to the films atmosphere. As true existential characters, they are too focused on 'the road' to worry about anything else. They only show true emotion when the Girl comes between them, making those scenes even more potent.

Everyone here is essentially an archetype with the exception of the Warren Oates character, who is a contradictory, chameleon-like personality, the one character searching not for a destination but an identity. In the midst of the aptly named Driver, Mechanic and Girl, GTO (Warren Oates) best defines the circular themes of the narrative, forever reinventing himself as if he has no true identity. Each character is an existential beast but the Oates character is the most interesting character to me. As an audience member, he was my entry point into accessing the meanings of the story.

Their sum of their lives is this: one drives, one fixes the car, they race for money so they can continue driving and fixing their car. They may cruise into and out of the lives of others, but, really, nobody has any effect on them. This changes only when The Girl (willowy, spacey Laurie Bird) joins them, unannounced and uninvited, on their long trip to nowhere.

It changes a little more when they meet up with a GTO-driving blowhard played by Warren Oates. He doesn't care much for these young punks, and he lets `em know it. They challenge him to a cross-country race, their respective pink slips hanging in the balance. GTO accepts. They all drive some more.

And so it goes for the four main characters. The Girl may switch allegiances among the three men. The Mechanic may offer to drive. The Driver may turn him down. GTO may tell an all-new whopper to one of the many hitchhikers he picks up. But unlike the similarly themed ""Easy Rider"" which made riding motorcycles cross-country look like the ultimate freedom, ""Two-Lane Black Top"" offers up its version of alienation with no sanctuary. There's no counterculture to belong to. No hip lingo or clothing to sport. No sex, no drugs or anything else to give the characters entrance into some sort of elitist, antiestablishment clique. Sure, the guys in ""Easy Rider"" had run away from the Establishment...but they had all the commune-dwellers, hippie chicks and weird lawyers they needed to be part of a different, even more exclusive club. No such luck for the Driver, the Mechanic and GTO.

For the folks in this movie, there's no scene to be a part of, nowhere to call home, nobody to call a friend, really. The men may muster up the smallest bit of jealousy over the Girl. But mostly, they all just drive, disconnected from pretty much anything or anyone. Oddly, the one character who seems to crave some measure of human contact - GTO - is the most abrasive. But are his lies an attempt to impress, to make himself more attractive? Or are they just a shield he uses to keep anyone from getting too close? Hard to say.

To the casual viewer, this could all be pretty boring stuff. And it's hard to imagine that the early 70s drive-in crowd on whom this movie was dropped could have been anything other than confused by it. For a movie named ""Two Lane Blacktop,"" there ain't a whole lot of racing. And there sure as hell ain't much plot. But it's also a movie that grows on you. A movie that makes you wonder about the characters and want to fill in the blanks. It may not live up to your expectations on a first viewing, but give it a chance. Like a top-shelf Scotch or a premium cigar, the good parts become more and more apparent the more you get to know it.

The real benefit of a release like this, of course, is that it represents the rescue of an obscure little gem. And it's practically worth the price of admission just to see Dennis Wilson and James Taylor onscreen with not a drum kit or guitar in sight. But, as they have with so many other films, the Criterion folks have done this movie up right! There are lots of great extras and info that are sure to please committed fans and converts alike. So hats off to director Monte Hellman for making one of the most perfect examples of arthouse/drive-in cinema. And big thanks to the people at Criterion who got this baby off the ground for our home viewing pleasure.",1209600000,5,3762,4.526470588235294

Ok, I'm stepping off my titanium soapbox now.... d'oh!!!!",1205539200,16,521,4.909090909090909
1111870,4,6305972370,"The only real acting done in this film is done by Warren Oates and its a powerful perfomance. He plays a man with a troubled past narrating his way through one fantasy after another. For Oates, known only as ""G.T.O."", the road means whatever he wants it to mean. Whenever he gets tired of himself, and lonely for an audience, he simply picks up a stranger and begins a new narrative. Whats brilliant about this character is that he seems like someone you could very well run into were you taking a cross-country trip of your own. This character and others like him are eternal fixtures on the American highways. The road appeals to these types because they are in love with the impermanence of a life lived there. Every stretch of road promises a new encounter, a new adventure, and no success or disappointment lasts more than a day.

James Taylor & Dennis Wilson have only their rock mystique, and the mystique of the '55 Chevy. They are not actors, and this really works just fine most of the time because they are really not required to speak. They are barely there, and thats the way they like it. Monte Hellman seems to be saying that ""G.T.O's"" middle age blues and Taylor's and Wilson's brand of disaffection are perhaps both symptoms of the same general American malaise. Whats particularly American about this malaise is that America is a country in love with mobility and Americans are always seeking for a new frontier and that urge for something beyond, something greater than the present has to offer, is never satisfied. All that the characters in this movie, and in many other early 70's films, can find is a temporary release from their surroundings, from themselves.  In this film that temporary release is speed and wandering the stretches of America's highways like the sailors of old used to roam the seas or winding rivers.

There is no soundtrack music. When we do hear music it is just what happens to be playing on the jukebox at the roadhouses and diners that these characters tumble through each morning and each night. In one of those diners we hear Kris Kristoferson's version of his own song ""Me and Bobby McGee"" playing in the background and the line,""freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,"" is particularly poignant in the context of these character's lives but the characters are oblivious to the fact that the song has anything to say to them. They hear only the call of the road.

""G.T.O"" has cassette tapes of every genre of music in his car, but for him it doesn't matter whether its rock or country so long as the song is about cars. In several scenes the camera seems to sit like a passenger in the backseat just eavesdropping on ""G.T.O"" singing along to another song about another car. ""G.T.O"" is by far the most developed character and everything he does is memorable. Oates is a wonder here! Taylor and Wilson are appealing as countercultural apparitions haunting the screen with their folksy California appeal but Oates' earthy heart and soul humor is what really grounds the film in something tangible (without him the film would be an abstract--because voiceless & emotionless-- character study). This humor provides the perfect balance for Taylor and Wilson. But Oates' character does two other vital things as well: he provides us with insight into what leads someone to abandon their home and hit the road in the first place, and he is living proof of just what happens to a man who lives his life on the road. Taylor and Wilson are ruggedly reticent but there is ultimately also something mechanical about them and were it not for G.T.O we would tire of them quickly.  Granted, there is also something mechanical about the way G.T.O. repeats the same narratives over and over again, so neither side is perhaps any better off than the other in this intergenerational conflict, but the friction between the silent Taylor and Wilson and the chatty Oates is what keeps both parties (and us) from falling asleep at the wheel.

 Taylor & Wilson's chevy is silent. Ironically, when riding with them, we never hear any music. They do not want any luxuries like music or air-conditioning to complicate their lives: they are not looking to settle in anywhere, comfort is not a factor, and the sparseness of the cars interior and exterior emphasize their no-nonsense approach. They prefer a trance-like communion with the road and each other. Taylor speaks only a handful of words and Wilson speaks only about what needs to be done to the car. When a hitchhiker picks them up (she climbs into the chevy while they are dining)they passively accept her presence. Shes a hippie girl used to livin' out of a duffle bag. Taylor and Wilson each have a private moment with her but she doesn't seem to stir much desire in either of them. What seems to irk Taylor is not the fact that she leaves the car to ride with someone else but that somehow this means that he has lost at something and hes all about winning every race, every bet, every kind of wager.

The no-name roadhouses and diners and gas stations have a similar no-nonsense beauty to them. They are not so much oases of food and drink as necessary pit-stops. Hellman avoids the major highways and cities; most of this film takes place on the backroads and in sparsely inhabited southern towns and some viewers might be inclined to see this film as a nostalgic journey into a more rural, less spoiled, American landscape. Taylor and Wilson's preference for the older automobiles would certainly support the view that they believe America is becoming more and more generic, and that this ever-expanding sameness is what is accelerating America's demise. Avoiding the major highways and cities thus seems like an effective way of remaining aloof from the mainstreaming tendencies of contemporary America.

There is no real end to a movie like this which is more about an evocation of a certain brand of American romanticism/escapism than it is about specific characters. These characters are familiar archetypes that still litter the backroads and roadhouses of an America that never grows old or tired or disillusioned with itself.",1205539200,8,6136,4.781132075471698

1111874,5,6305972370,"The antiestablishment view that was put into practice in the Cannonball races was predated by Monte Hellman's cult classic film Two-Lane Blacktop.  In the movie, the central characters The Driver and The Mechanic do not want to fit into a societal frame of living.  Instead, they are immersed into a subculture that defines them as free-living individuals without restraint who are able to move about in a fashion that suits their needs.  A common bond holds the Driver and The Mechanic together, which in their case is a modified 1955 Chevy.  They are not at all perverted by the outside world; instead they live within the cocoon known as The Car.  Both characters can only relate to one another through the 1955 Chevy.  Once outside forces such as the characters known as The Girl and The GTO enter their lives, the lifestyles of The Driver and Mechanic is completely disrupted.  Director Monte Hellman used the character of The Girl as a metaphor for the human condition of loneliness.  Both The Driver and The Mechanic need human interaction but are hesitant and unknowledgeable of how to accept it.  The GTO represents an ever-conforming society through the commercialization of a subculture.  Instead of building one's own muscle car Detroit has taken all the steps themselves to provide the luxury of pre-built speed machines.  Whether they accept it or now, the conforming commercial society is slowly closing in on The Driver and The Mechanic.
 Free from the restraints of society, The Mechanic and The Driver are in fact existential.  The routine of The Driver and The Mechanic are that of drifters moving about with no end goal in mind.  Both men are risk takers who realize they are just what their names imply.  Disconnected and void of reality from a world that is full of anguish and frustration dominates the lives of these two men who lack meaning and purpose in their lives.  Maybe it is best to describe the Driver and the Mechanic as people who are obsessed with a machine that has no soul or purpose other than that of transportation.  This existential attitude is befitting of the characters in who they are and not what society wants them to be.",1202601600,,2169,4.818918918918919
1111875,5,6305972370,"When I heard that a re-release of Two Lane Blacktop, was on the cards, I wondered how you could improve on the Anchor Bay version of the same Film.
The last outing from Anchor Bay was a limited run of 15,000 which had a wide screen version of the movie, a Documentary about the Director, a key ring of the 55 Chevy, a mini poster, and a collectable booklet.

This time round we have a new restored print of the movie, two audio commentaries, a tour of some of the original movie loctations, interviews with some of the surviving cast, and a photo still restoration of the original car, also included is the full screen play, and a reprint of the 1970 Rolling Stone article about the Movie.

Both Versions have something special to offer

The movie for me is the ultimate film noir for the road movie fan, this is the long gone small town Americana, movie I love so much, the other pull of the time is the Main Stars, James Taylor, Dennis Wilson, Warren Oats, and Laurie Bird, the Director is clever to not give these screen characters names, the are just referred to as the Driver, Mechanic, Girl, and GTO, this ensures that the viewer is immersed in the story and the road trip across small town America.
Much has been wrote as to the meaning of the film, and I will reserve my views on that for on line discussion forums

All in all Criterion have made a good product, great with this release, and have added to the background on this movie

Buy it, you won't regret it, even if you own the Anchor Bay version

I've been a gearhead forever. When i first saw this thing, the Muncie M22 made music to my ears. The guys over at smokey and the bandit thought so too, they dubbed the sound of the primer grey '55 with the Muncie M22 RockCrusher (strongest gear built by human hands) over the aneimic sounding bone stock FireChicken. The car was also painted (i kinda like it in primer best) black and was driven by Harrison Ford in American Graffiti. I was looking for the car in the movie (after being hip to this fact), it is most definately heard before seen. The ""John Milner"" character actualy cringes when he hears it, grabbin a gear at high RPM.

This film is not for everybody, the dialogue is choppy, the acting jerks along with stops and starts... But Oates (Sgt Hulka from Stripes) makes this thing work.. plays the ultra swarmey, middle aged, man in the ""455 ram air"" Pontiac. James Taylor (yeah THAT James Taylor) did a great job playing the role of ""driver"", frustrated, fumbling at any releationship other than with his Mechanic (Played by Dennis Wilson, of Beachboy's Fame) or with his '55 Chevy.

Gearheads who can appriciate a period street racing car, stripped to the very bare bones, will love this movie.. and it's soundtrack...

Despite high praise from such a prestigious periodical, the studio refused to promote the film and it was barely released theatrically. Perhaps the studio felt that the minimalist plot and characterization, coupled with the existential vibe, wouldn't appeal to a mainstream audience. However, over the years, Two-Lane Blacktop developed a small, but loyal following among car enthusiasts who fetishized the 1955 Chevy and 1970 Pontiac GTO featured so prominently that they deserve top billing alongside the lead actors. The film also found an audience with people who dug other nihilistic road movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easy-Rider-35th-Anniversary-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0002O7XWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easy Rider (35th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanishing-Point/dp/B00013RC8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanishing Point</a>.

Director Monte Hellman's camerawork is very minimalist, almost documentary-like in how matter-of-factly it depicts the race and the places and people that they encounter along the way. With all of the car-speak and loving shots of fast, muscle cars, Two-Lane Blacktop is a car lover's dream. It has also become a nostalgia piece as they just don't make cars like the ones in this film anymore. This film also immerses us in the car-racing culture of its day like no other film then or since.

Fans of the Anchor Bay edition will definitely want to hold onto that copy, especially if you're lucky enough to own the limited edition collectors' tin, as none of the extras are included on this new one.

The first disc features an audio commentary by the film's director Monte Hellman and joining him is filmmaker Allison Anders. He talks about how he got his start as a filmmaker, working for Roger Corman and American International Pictures. Anders keeps things moving by asking Hellman a lot of questions about making the film.

There is another commentary by the film's screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer and film professor David Meyer. They kick things off by defining the road movie and what it's all about. Wurlitzer talks about the romanticism of Jack Kerouac's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Road-The-Original-Scroll/dp/067006355X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Road: The Original Scroll</a>&nbsp;and the evolution to the existentialism of Two-Lane Blacktop. This is a very philosophical track as he and Meyer talk about the film's themes and analyze their meaning.

""On the Road Again"" features Hellman and some of his film students revisiting some of the locations in the film. Along the way, he talks about how he got involved in the film, how Rudy Wurlitzer came on board, and casting the lead actors. Hellman also talks about the troubles he had getting a studio interested and how Universal Pictures backed it. He talks about the style and intentions.

""Make It Three Yards"" is a conversation between Hellman and James Taylor done in 2007. Taylor recounts his impressions making the film, including a few hair-raising mechanical mishaps with the cars.

""Somewhere Near Salinas"" is a conversation with Kris Kristofferson who let ""Me and Bobby McGee"" be in the film. He talks about how he contemplated playing the role of the Mechanic but Hellman felt that he was too old.

""Sure Did Talk to You"" features production manager Walter Coblenz and producer Michael S. Laughlin talking about the making of the film from their point-of-view. They talk about how Hellman let the actors only read the pages of the script for that day in order to allow for a more spontaneous reaction.

""Those Satisfactions are Permanent"" allows one to see screen-test outtake footage of Laurie Bird and James Taylor. They don't actually read from the script but are interviewed instead.

""Color Me Gone"" is a collection of behind-the-scenes stills.

""Performance and Image"" features car enthusiast Walt Bailey reconstructing a '55 Chevy and offers his account via text and photographs. Also, then and now photos of locations used in the film are displayed.

1111892,5,6305972370,"Many American filmmakers love European films (with good reasons), and during the 1960's and 1970's, they tried to emulate them to some degree.  Antonioni was a favorite to emulate, but this often resulted in pointless self indulgence and overly artsy work.  Monte Hellman was one of the exceptions.  This film, which I consider his best work, capture the Antonioni-like feel perfectly, but he still made a quinessentially American film.  The pace of the film is slow and meditative, and Hellman's mise-en-scene is superb.  He really uses the frame superbly.  Hellman succeeds in making a real art film about drag racing, and that is quite remarkable.

The film is about 2 drag racers (James Taylor and Dennis Wilson, yes, the rock stars) who travel around the country and race, eat, sleep, race some more.  There is very little explanation in the character's motivation, which really enhances the work.  Warren Oates's character (who gives the best performance here) is just known as GTO (the car he drives).  We never learn his name.  Most people who went to see the film were probably expecting a great drag race movie with rock stars, but instead got a meditative, thought provoking film which was more like a European auteur film than an American film.  The only quip I have is Laurie Bird's performance.  She's not very good, and she can become a distraction when watching the film.  The film was shot mostly on location in small town USA, and it gives the film an excellent atmosphere.  It's not an Easy Rider type of film where everyone's a redneck.  The people are just there, portrayed as human beings.  Today, there would be a lot of snarky commentary by a smart a** teenager.  Luckily, Hellman didn't do that here.  This is Monte Hellman's best film, and one of the most neglected films of the 1970's.",1193616000,2,1812,4.824675324675325

Being a guy who grew up with the Muscle Cars of the 60's and 70's, this was a great movie that brought back the sweet sound of a Chevy 454 Big Block with open headers. I highly recommend this movie for all the Hot Rod fans of that era.",1190937600,,515,4.0
1111894,5,6305972370,"Although I don't really don't know if you can consider this acting. What procedes between Mr. Fire and Rain, The Beach Boy, and their many acquaintances on the road sound like things that everyday people would discuss, and that doesn't take alot to do. But most people can't transfer onto the screen as well as these boys can.

As for the movie itself. I loved it! What happened to America in the past 35 years since this movie first came out? We've all become so embroiled in our daily activities that we forget about what else is out there. This movie is, for me, a 100 minute snapshot of what freedom is. It's being out on the road, not being tied down to any real commitment, except for the occasional breadwinning. And these 2 friends have found their breadwinning niche in the form of their biggest passion, racing. For other people it could be music, surfing, or painting.

The only really thing I didn't like about the movie was Laurie Bird's butchering of some great tunes. Like her tonedeaf interpretation of The Stones' classic ""Satisfaction"" in the arcade or her annoying lyric echoing for that killer blues number playing on the GTO's sound system. You can see Dennis Wilson trying to keep himself from laughing at her in that scene. But luckily for me that isn't enough for me to take away a star.

It's interesting that director Monte Hellmen, known for his Westerns, decided to choose a couple of rock stars (who at the time could've been considered the Wild West Heroes [and Villians, haha Beach Boys reference] of the day) to star in this movie.

Much like the dialouge, music is kept to a minimum. Mainly the only real excuse for music in this movie is the fact that it's always coming from a car stereo, instead of the usual dramatic effect (like in ""Easy Rider"" or ""Vanishing Point""). It's same as everything else in the movie. A song just passes by as if it were an object by the highway. If you're going fast, it passes by quickly.

Hopefully this movie can translate to you, the same way it translated to me.",1178841600,4,2032,4.556164383561644
1111895,4,6305972370,"I wasn't sure what to expect from the flick as I refused to read the blurb and wanted to go in completely unspoiled. The flick stars a young James Taylor (yeah, that James Taylor, the Fire and Rain, ex-hippie soft rock king), Dennis Wilson (of the Beach Boys), Laurie Bird, and Warren Oates (who I only really knew as Sgt. Hulka from Stripes.) Basically it's sort of an existentialist gear-head flick that follows two friends, a hitchhiker, and a compulsive liar as they race across the country.

The first thing that surprised me was how much I loved both James Taylor (as The Driver) and Dennis Wilson (as The Mechanic); both perfectly nail that disassociated quietness that comes from truly cool obsessive hobbyists (you know the type, that dude that's uber knowledgeable and has pretty much seen or experienced every aspect of something and just kind of hangs out mildly interested in the scene; think Chevy Chase in Caddyshack or Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused.) When they're checking out potential cars to race against, and they're rattling off engine types and model years it's with a total stoicism that's way more realistic and convincing than a more manic method approach (like Nic Cage in the Gone in 60 Seconds remake.) Very early on you get used to the two as a unit, almost inseparable, so later in the film with the introduction of Laurie Bird's hitchhiker, even though it's played out very subdued, you can really feel the distance growing between the Driver and the Mechanic. It's kind of painful to watch (in a good way.)

Overall the film is very slow, plodding along just fast enough with almost no plot that you might actually fall asleep if it weren't for the occasional engine revving or race. Warren Oates' character, an older guy with a much nicer looking car (a yellow 1970 Pontiac G.T.O.) than the duo (in their dark gray primer colored '55 Chevy) ends up adding a lot of unnerving humor and a lightness to the overly brooding film. He's constantly picking up hitchhikers and coming up with a new spiel about how he ended up with his G.T.O., none of which you can believe by the time he hooks up with the duo. There's actually a great cameo by Harry Dean Stanton as a gay hitchhiker that manages to be both funny and very disturbing at the same time.

This movie plays out much in the same way that Jack Kerouac's On the Road feels. What probably helped this along was that the director Monte Hellman only dished out a day's worth of the script at a time which seemed frustrating to the actors, but which helped to insure very organic performances. He also tried his best to deprive the actors of sleep so that they would be in the same head-space as the characters which were on a non-stop trip.

The flick also has a very abrupt (though interesting), pre-third act resolution, ending which I think says a lot more about the film than I realized when I watched it through the first time. The basic plot is that the duo, after picking up Laurie Bird, are confronted by Warren Oates' character at a gas station (though they've sort of had a couple run-ins with him before where he tries his best to initiate a race and both times they blow him off) and you can tell he's dying to get these three on the road with him, the two guys in a race, and the girl in his car. After a bit of macho posturing, Taylor and Wilson challenge Oates to a race across the country to D.C. with the two car's pinks as the trophy. They put their pink slips together and mail them to D.C. care of general delivery and head out. During the film all three guys make passes at Laurie Bird, who is more than willing, though only Wilson makes contact, however pointless and fleeting it is. At the same time Bird is sort of wary of the guys as it seems that she's looking for a bit of stability and all she can see in them is their need to race above all else, or in Oates' case, a little bit on insanity. Eventually she splits from the group and hitches a ride with some dude on his motorcycle, exiting the film and setting the tone for the rest of the picture which is when everyone sort of realizes that nothing is going to change and they all just sort of abandon the race, getting back to where they started the film leaving the bare plot resolution as a mere loose end. The race is really just a MacGuffin.",1177027200,6,4321,4.465822784810126
1111896,5,6305972370,"I'm younger than James Taylor but in 1971 my friends (T.C. Williams HS ala ""Remember the Titans"") assumed that the Driver and the Mechanic were maybe barely 20 - in contrast to G.T.O.  G.T.O. is more than a generational foil.  Warren Oats turns in what is easily the most poignant portrayal of mid-life crisis ever filmed (as it could only occur in 1969-70).

I look at this movie as a masterpiece period film. Forget about Last Picture Show, Diner, Tin Men - maybe American Graffiti: those are great period films (never liked American Graffiti).  Two-Lane Blacktop a masterpiece.  It is sui generis among American film classics and within its road movie niche.  This movie is in the top five of my 10 best films list... (Includes: Blade Runner; The Last Detail; Kill Bill and In Harms Way.)

I think this is the quintessential portrayal of youthful disillusionment and isolation in the late 1960s, very early 1970s.  By 1972 the youth culture portrayed in Two-Lane Blacktop had been overcome by events.  The so-called ""movement"" was long over and all that remained were plastic echoes expressed in glib commercialized fashion statements.

Male youth of the era are portrayed accurately as having little to say and even less to accomplish.  I would submit that the influence of Two-Lane Blacktop still pops up occasionally in films such as River's Edge, Stand By Me, even elements of  Down in the Valley.

Just as that uniquely original youth period has passed so passed the America portrayed in the film's many segues.  Likewise passes any opportunity to make as genuine and true a period piece as Two-Lane Blacktop.  The film is too pure and simple for our ""interesting times.""",1176940800,,1679,4.904255319148936

The girl that they pick up on the way is pretty cute and the scenes are classic America 1971, before we got shafted with an energy crisis, runaway inflation, a 55 mph speed limit, and Wal-Mart. Its fun to see the drivers make their stops in ratty gas stations, greasy diners (pre-Waffle House) and go through what was small-town America. Long live the two lane blacktop!

Other movies that need to be put on DVD include the movie Stingray, made in 1978, a madcap comedy/action film about a couple of drug dealers who stash some money and cocaine in a 1964 Stingray ragtop and the chase to get it back.",1156550400,12,753,4.4963503649635035

Lundegaard's got nothing on G.T.O. (named after the car he drives), a consummate liar who spins yarns without betraying a muscle, in a role played by Warren Oates that comes off like the prototype for Chris Cooper's orchid thief character in ""Adaptation."" In fact, the whole movie, simple yet engaging and at times mesmerizing, with characters who are underdeveloped but nevertheless feel natural and true, comes across like a study guide for modern-day indie filmmaking. James Taylor -- in his only movie role as a drifter whose survival depends on the virility of his Chevy -- with his chiseled stare, primitive-grunge style and somber presence is to Vincent Gallo as Jack Nicholson is to Christian Slater. Too bad he decided to stick with songwriting. ""Blacktop"" is like a Kerouac novel on film, an oddball adventure with no beginning and no end. The film also owes a healthy nod to ""Easy Rider.""

1111909,5,6305972370,"This is a classic road film back in ""the day"" of homegrown muscle cars and the growing groundswell of resentment toward the Vietnam War, draft slavery, and other forms of state terrorism such as the National Guard killings of students at Kent State University.  For nearly two hours, government mayhem is forgotten while the viewer joins the drivers and passengers of cool muscle cars in their playful pursuits.

A '55 Chevy is King of the Road and maintains its financial needs and reputation through illegal street races with other muscle cars foolish enough to contend.  This is a cool no-frills muscle car with a honking big V-8 up front.  They say behind every boxing champ is a dedicated trainer and a good manager - likewise the '55 Chevy has a dedicated driver and a skilled mechanic.  Folk music star James Taylor and the late Dennis Wilson of the ""Beach Boys"" are the '55 Chevy's driver and mechanic. They are superb at maintaining their focus on finding the next race for the Chevy who then wins against the competition.

The '55 Chevy has been stripped of its non-essentials in order to reduce its curb weight and gain more speed.  The heater and rear seats are gone.  Fiberglass replaces steel.  Plastic aircraft windows replace the original heavy glass ones. The radio stayed but is turned-off at race time. The Chevy is not only lighter, it has a lot more horsepower too.  Four hundred and fifty-four cubic inches of AFB dual-carbed, tunnel-rammed V-8 engine is mated to a Muncie M22 Rockcrusher 4-speed transmission. To accommodate the extra horses and torque, the car has wider brake drums and shoes, a front suspension brace, a speedometer that goes up 140 mph, a 8,000-rpm tachometer, and a roll bar.  Muscle car enthusiasts will love this car.

The movie begins in Los Angeles with a Golden Gloves competition of illegal street racing between some beautiful muscle cars including a Dodge Daytona, a Plymouth Barricuda, and a Pontiac GTO, among others.  Before the cops arrive to draw a curtain on the show, we viewers get to see the '55 Chevy blow-off a Plymouth Barricuda. The story progresses to document an interesting competition between two great cars - the '55 Chevy and a factory-kitted '70 Pontiac GTO packing 500 stallions that the Chevy eventually encounters for a cross-country race to Washington, D.C. for each other's pink slips.  The GTO is driven by a fast-talking pretender played by Warren Oates, who is constantly picking up hitchhikers so he can run his mouth at the expense of the hitchhikers' ears unfortunate to accept a ride.  His mouth makes it difficult to enjoy the GTO's horsepower as the Goat attempts to out-hum its driver's mouth! Contrast the GTO's driver to the Chevy's Driver and Mechanic:  together they don't do much talking other than talk cars and racing, and they pick up only one hitchhiker (played by the late Laurie Bird). Instead they drive and ride while the Chevy's 454 Big Block does the singing while it plays the whines from its Muncie transmission.

In short, this film is like going to a music concert - eventually it ends but it was a great respite from the absurdities of the world.  Want to rest your mind from Adolf Bush's invasions of Afghanistan (for opium) and Iraq (for oil) or forget about America's slide down the slippery slope to Nazi Amerika?  Jump into the back of this '55 Chevy while ""The Driver"" and ""The Mechanic"" take you for a exhilarating ride through the high-performance world of illegal street racing.  But hold on, because there is no seat in the back!",1152316800,7,3546,4.82013201320132
1111910,5,6305972370,"I found this movie in my TiVo suggestions list a few months ago, and it has really gotten under my skin.

As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the movie appears to be about fast cars, drag racing and cross-country travel, but it is realy about loneliness, alienation, and numbness.

The four main characters (listed in the credits as ""The Driver"", ""The Mechanic"", ""The GTO"", and ""The Girl"") barely interact with each other (there is less than 20 lines of dialog in the first 45  minutes).  When they win a race, the driver and the mechanic show no emotion; they seem to derive no pleasure from it.

When the GTO shows up, the film gets more noisy, but the constant chattering that Warren Oates' character is spouting to every hitchhiker he picks up seems to be a desperate attempt to avoid silence, to avoid dealing with his own thoughts.

The pace is slow, but the images are beautifully shot and the sound is clear.",1149292800,6,925,4.575757575757576
1111911,5,6305972370,"You have to figure that by 1983 James Taylor was having serious regrets about being one of the four stars of ""Two Lane Blacktop"". Dennis Wilson's 1983 drowning had been proceeded by Warren Oates' 1982 heart attack and Laurie Bird's 1979 suicide (she was just age 25). But somehow Taylor has dodged the ""Two Lane Blacktop"" curse and is still with us.

""Two Lane Blacktop"" is a rather strange character study packaged as a car/road film. Strange because like a lot of Director Monte Hellman's stuff, there isn't much done in the character development department. Which makes studying the characters quite a strain but it seems like a lot of viewers are willing to burn serious energy on the subject. See ""Ride the Whirlwind"" and ""The Shooting"" for other examples of his technique. Hellman apparently is a master of working with actors from all backgrounds as he gets exactly the performances he needs from the experienced Oates and his three completely inexperienced co-stars. Note the use of local radio stations in this film and its similarity in this regard to ""Reservoir Dogs"", a film that Hellman co-produced.

Anyway, what you have in the film are four people who converge from three different directions (universes) and link up. They interact for most of the movie and at the end separate and go back to doing exactly what they had been doing before, utterly unchanged by their interactions with each other. This is pretty much the polar opposite of most films, which exist to illustrate examples of characters changing as a result of their experiences. While there are films like ""Fat City"" where the main character is unchanged by the events of the film, ""Two Lane Blacktop"" may be unique in extending this to all four of the main characters. That it would be unique in this regard is especially interesting when you consider that real life interpersonal relationships are closer to the way they are portrayed in ""Two Lane Blacktop"" than in your basic uplifting film. I guess we are reminded of this fact daily and don't need to be hit with it by our escapist entertainment.

An effort is made to symbolically illustrate the three universes Hellman portrays in the film. The Driver and the Mechanic are defined by their function and their 55 Chevy has been customized to maximize its most basic function, performance. It has no heater and no comforts other than a radio, which the Driver turns off when there is serious driving to be done. GTO is defined by things (his car and his baggage-both real and emotional). Like him, his car is a poser and is compromised by a host of non-performance related features. The Girl is defined by her companion of the moment and has neither function nor identity. The Driver is unable to teach her to function as a driver and she abandons what few possessions she has at the end.

What is most striking about the film is how beautifully it was shot and how contemporary it looks. The colors are great and the style is more like 2004 than 1971. The print being shown on the Sundance Channel is in perfect shape. A side benefit of the film is that it is a great time capsule of the muscle car era. There is an especially great shot early in the film, a wide shot from inside a diner with the jukebox on the right and a slit in the middle of the frame (the diner door) through which you see The Girl getting into the car. Highly recommended for brooding viewers.

1111928,5,6305972370,"Hi Correia, Everyone's entitled to their opinions, but you're in the minority in not liking ""Two-Lane Blacktop."" 'TLB' is regularly cited as one of the best examples of pop-art movies of the '70s, one of the most exciting periods in American cinema.

Director Monte Hellman was asked by longtime fan Quentin Tarantino to co-produce 'Reservoir Dogs.' (The same Tarantino who named his company A Bande Apart after a Godard film and helped bring Wong Kar-Wai to the US by helping distribute ""Chungking Express."")

You are right that TLB has little dialogue-- just like the Westerns and arthouse films it resembles. When you write that you have ""absolutely no idea what the movie is about,"" I assume you're not referring to the plot, which is simpler than a Rocky movie:  two guys race across country for their muscle cars' pink slips.

Perhaps you mean that you can't identify any Grand Themes or Social Issues in TLB. Like the best storytellers, Hellman doesn't explicitly state his themes by writing in ""trailer lines."" He instead allows ambiguity and silence into his film so that the viewer can imagine themselves into the story and find their meanings within it.

The film IS deeply philosophical and bears analysis, but watching it is primarily experiential and meditative; it only becomes an intellectual experience after the lights come up. It allows us to experience some of the best aspects of American life -- the Road, movement, self reliance, freedom-- as well as some of the worst-- rootlessness, restlessness, alienation. The film is a portrait of the modern, secularist, existential journey through life; its lack of dialogue can be felt as isolation, or as a comfortable silence expressing the deep bond between the driver and mechanic (we never hear the character's names, nor do the credits give them any).

TLB traffics in pop iconography, quintessentially American images. We travel with the perfect embodiment of the Self-Reliant American Male, through rugged, iconic American landscapes, until the landscape and the travelers (and the audience?) become one.

Have these two men achieved a level of self-reliance that has freed them from the constraints of civilization? Or has their laconic independence imprisoned them, dooming them to ride alone and cut off from one another, like John Wayne at the end of ""The Searchers,"" hurtling through a Godless universe with only the most ill-defined of goals to guide them.

The value of any creative expression is in the effort you expend, the distance you travel, to explore its meaning. Movies and books should pull us out of what we know, force us to expand to incorporate new ways of seeing and thinking. A hard but usually rewarding process.

I applaud viewers like you, Correia, for pushing yourself to watch something outside the mainstream. Movies like TLB that seem on first pass to be hard to understand  may be great works of art in disguise, waiting to change your world. Keep at it!",1085097600,4,2958,5.030674846625767

Upon more in depth analysis, Wilson's character is supposed to be aloof, and J.T.'s intense. Unfortunately, bad acting and poor character developement defused this combination.
  Warren Oates does contribute to some of the best scenes in the film, as the mixed-up ""GTO"". A chameleon-like persona, ever-changing to adapt to and impress each hitch-hiker he picks up.
The scene with Harry Dean Stanton is particularly amusing in its context.

1111937,5,6305972370,"The 1971 film ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" is arguably the best of the late 60s, early 70s existential road film genre (including ""Easy Rider,"" ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Electra Glide in Blue""). Director Monte Hellman's stark, at times unyeilding examination of American alienation is brilliant simply because of its refusal to pander to an audience undoubtedly looking for the commercial release of an exciting car chase.
There is a race in ""Two-Lane Blacktop,"" though it seems to end almost before it begins. There are extraordinary muscle cars as well, including a souped up '55 Chevy contrasted with a new Pontiac GTO. But Two-Lane Blacktop is a character study, even though the characters are not people we would particularly like to know.
The three main characters, haunted lost souls void of identity and emotion, are played by James Taylor, Dennis Wilson and Warren Oates. Taylor and Wilson silently cruise the backroads of America looking for the next race in their 55' Chevy. They eventually meet Oates, a chattering, nervous man involved in some kind of middle-age crisis while picking up hitchikers in his GTO. These men decide to race cross country, but eventually lose interest.
Throw into this uneasy mix a young hitchiker played by Laurie Bird. She jumps back and forth between these three men, holding off their awkward advances, eventually realizing their emotionless lives are headed down an endless highway without destination.
""Two-Lane Blacktop"" is a morose study of men perpetually lost on the backroads of a nameless American landscape. They are hovering ghosts, void of identity, forever searching for a meaning which cannot be found. There are no easy truths or answers in Hellman's complex odyssey. These men are trapped, their cars serving as rolling coffins, redemption seemingly around the next bend, inexorably moving further and further away.
The time period of the early 1970s and the scratchy period music moaning from the AM radio, combined with the faceless gas stations and roadside diners of numerous small towns, all contribute to the overall effect of Hellman's dark character study.

This film gained a cult following because of its Zen-like quality, I suppose, and it probably inspired a lot more films of this genre that eventually culminated in the Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider and then fizzled as it lost its roots.",1010188800,2,735,4.333333333333333

How many movies these days do you see guys taking their own tools boxes with 'em?  Want to see a real big block bow tie instead of a chromed over something?  You see street racing like it really was.  The driver and mechanic, how serious are they about racing?  They race, girl comes along, they have girl and race, they lose girl, they keep on racing.  So if you are looking for a love story with a happy ending, this in not the movie for you.  If speed shifting and low geared rear end whine is your idea of music, this movie works.

I am only writing to challenge some of the comments made about the acting- particularly Taylor and Wilson.  I think the acting is outstanding.  Can you imagine trying to ""get out of the way"" of this film?  How many actors today would even consider doing a film where they weren't ""the deal?""  An interesting lesson of the film is that no one is the deal (even those who still want to believe in such things- aka Oates' character). Two Lane Blacktop is a great film and a timeless statement about the ""other"" America where the people are not all shiny, happy and infinitely interesting.  (Remember, they actually used to make films like this.)  In Two Lane Blacktop, car stuff IS heroic. And if the truth be told, several of the cars in this film remain more interesting than many of the people we know.",989539200,7,879,4.45625
1111977,5,6305972370,"A good friend of mine is an insanely obsessed car-freak. One lazy weekend afternoon we were kicking back in his living room having some beers, and he turned on his TV and popped a DVD into the player, and we watched Two Lane Blacktop. I'm not into cars at all, but I was transfixed by this movie. When it was all over, I didn't find it pretentious or confusing or boring in the slightest. I saw it as a very simple yet compelling story; Two men live for only one thing: racing their car, which has been stripped down to its barest essentials in order to give it maximum speed. Things like air conditioning and rear seats have been removed... steel has been replaced with fiberglass. And as they have done with their car, they have stripped away all ""extraneous"" elements from their lives, and from their very selves. They have no need for conversation or music, or for love or anger or any other emotion for that matter. They're cold and dehumanized. As they make their way across the landscape, they meet an older man who has lost his life and identity, and is desperately searching for new ones. Most important, they are joined by a girl who wants only one thing: human contact. As I saw it, the central point of the story is how she affects the men, one of them more than the others. For me, this clarifies the notoriously ""ambiguous"" ending. It isn't a perfect film by any means. Laurie Bird's neophyte status is painfully obvious in some of her scenes. At times this film may be too subtle and understated for its own good. Austere to a fault. It seems that some of the most important and basic plot elements are left to the viewer to infer. Then again, this may again be part of the ""stripped down"" theme that is so prevalent throughout. Whatever the case, it's an incredibly unique and very haunting film. I can certainly understand that it isn't for everyone. Two Lane Blacktop is actually much like 2001: A Space Odyssey in that respect; some will inevitably regard it as boring and pointless. Others will, for lack of a less elitist and arrogant term, ""get it."" I heartily recommend that everyone sees it for themselves at least once, and find out which group you belong to.",989280000,16,2184,4.517676767676767
1111978,4,6305972370,"James Taylor and Dennis Wilson star in an interesting low-budget movie about outlaw drag racers traveling the United States. They scratch out a living and get their thrills suckering local street racers for money in drag races on backcountry highways. Taylor is the ""Driver"" and Wilson is the ""Mechanic;"" partner owners of a dingy-looking 1955 Chevy coupe packing formidable running gear that is capable of defeating most challengers' hot rods in quarter-mile duels.

The Driver and the Mechanic pick up the ""Hitchhiker""--Laurie Bird--and embark on a cross-country race after crossing paths with ""GTO""--Warren Oats--an eccentric adventurer driving a factory Pontiac GTO. While the story is interesting, Taylor's, Wilson's and Bird's performances are stoic to say the least. The late Warren Oates however, turns in an excellent performance as a character going through a mid-life crisis--spinning far fetched tales to hitchers he picks up along the highways. The movie parallels ""Easy Rider"" (1969) with several people traveling across country and taking life one day at a time. In the end there are no surprises, the story portrays a unique event in the lives of four people for a short period of several days.

Hot rod enthusiasts will appreciate the portrayal of outlaw drag racing in this movie with no gimmicks or special effects; just good old V8 engines with a lot of cubic inches and radical modifications. Since the late 1970's, this movie could only be caught on late-night TV broadcasts if a viewer paid close attention to program guides. Two Lane Blacktop eventually gained cult status with its outlaw drag racing story and that this is the only movie that featured singer-composer James Taylor and the late ""Beach Boys"" Dennis Wilson, bolstered by a remarkable performance by Warren Oates. An interesting tidbit is one of the 1955 Chevrolet sedans from this movie--the ""souped-up"" model used for racing scenes--that also served as Harrison Ford's ride in ""American Graffiti."" A second car used in the film was recovered and restored by a private party. The DVD edition is a treat with the imagery, screen format and several deleted scenes restored to the original 1971 specifications.",977961600,6,2196,5.218130311614731
1111979,5,6305972370,"Less dated than Easy Rider, this early 70's time capsule is an existential masterpiece.  What the hell does that mean?  It means the film is full of space.  It's about absolute nothing, or everything, or somewhere in between.  It's a poem that doesn't deliver what an audience expects but is utterly faithful to it's idea.  It doesn't have an emotional pay-off, but instead finds a stylish way to cinematically burn rubber and fade away.  It's characters are called Driver, Mechanic, GTO and Girl.  Its stars are James Taylor (yeah the pop singer),  Dennis Wilson (yeah the late Beach Boy), Warren Oates (in perhaps his finest performances) and Laura Bird (most won't know her, she's good).
Driver and Mechanic are the original slackers.  They love racing, and hustling people to keep racing and their supercharged '55 Chevy. They are not hippies, but car junkies.  The meet a loud mouth middle aged guy driving a newer sportier GTO who wants to race them for pink slips.  Eventually they agree to what amounts to a gentlemen's type race from New Mexico to the East Coast.  There's not a lot of suspense to the race, and the film is about. . . well  whatever you want it to be about. GTO pretends to be someone else everytime he picks up a new hitch-hiker. He's amusing himself with his creative imagination and re-inventing himself to escape the middle age blues.  Eventually there's a little bit of a competition over a young female hitchhiker.
The film was filmed on location as cast and crew drove across the country. The bare-bones script is by Rudolph Wurlitzer and Will Curry.
 The film becomes more and more abstract as it moves along.  The story matters less and less.  A circle eventually forms and we realize we've been riding along on a very unique, one of a kind film.  There's a wonderful example of an utterly open ended final shot.
  Some are going to find this film very dull and wonder what there is to admire and respect about it.  Others are going to 'discover' all sorts of things that are of course not actually present in the film itself, but are thoughts and reactions the film has sparked and triggered within them as they watched the film.  Other's will enjoy the muscle cars,  and late 60's cars that make sporadic appearances or rev up their engines on occassion.
 It's a film you watch many times and find different subtexts, moods, ideas and space within.  It's a film that requires the viewer to both observe, accept and participate in, like one would a living sculpture.
It's the kind of art film you would never expect from a director who made two quirky Westerns for Roger Corman in the mid 60's (The Shooting and Ride the Whirlwind --with Nicholson right before Jack became a star with Easy Rider). Hellman also went on to make the very interesting  Cockfigher with Warren Oates.  He's appreciated by a small, growing cult of afficianado's and you'll find Hellman's name more recently as executive producer of Reservoir Dogs.
For something really unique I suggest you find a way to watch the DVD of Two-Lane Blacktop.
The film was long out of circulation because of disputes over music rights.  They were resolved and the film has been beautifully transferred to DVD and actually looks better than it ever did since the contrasts in light were carefully boosted during the DVD transfer.

1111980,4,6305972370,"When I decided to purchase this DVD, I was just attracted by the name of the director of TWO-LANE BLACKTOP, Monte Hellman, who directed two excellent westerns in the sixties. I didn't know at all this movie and expected the worse. God ! How was I wrong ! TWO-LANE BLACKTOP is a divine surprise for those who, like me,  long for titles of the quality of the american movies of the 70's.
Two pop stars of that period, James Taylor and Dennis Wilson (Brian's brother), as the driver and the mechanic, race against Warren Oates in a journey through the heart of America. While Taylor and Wilson hardly speak, Warren Oates has a convulsive need to talk to the numerous hitch-hikers he accepts to take for a ride in his GTO.
TWO-LANE BLACKTOP is a road movie, in the tradition of EASY RIDER and THE VANISHING POINT, but the characters don't have to prove anything, they don't even care if they make it to their final destination, Washington D.C. They cannot either be considered as rebels because they don't have an ideal to defend or an authority to face. They are tragic figures without any ideals.
The DVD presented by Anchor BAY is sumptuous with top-notch images and sound ( vraoum, vraoum...). A trailer, a commentary and a  very informative featurette about Monte Hellman directed by George Hickenlooper.

This film gets better ever time I see it. Part road movie, part travelogue of America circa 1970, part existentialist tragedy, it's a strange, fascinating hodgepodge with no real precedent--not even ""Easy Rider""--that I'm aware of. ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" is what it is; if you're expecting just another car chase movie, you will likely be disappointed. It's a movie for anyone fascinated by the mystique of lonely gas stations in the middle of nowhere, of long, quiet rides down the highway with nary another soul in sight.... I've never seen a movie that has so effectively communicated the extraordinary vastness of America. It manages to be sad, pathetic, funny, and haunting all at once. You can criticize it for its sometimes shaky acting (Warren Oates, at least, is fabulous), but I think the sum effect of the movie precludes serious complaint.

1111984,4,6305972370,"Truely a muscle car masterpiece that takes the viewer to a time when life was simpler and gas cheaper.
The absence of dialogue between Dennis Wislon and James Taylor amplifies the true philosophy of racing. ""No  talking, concentrate on the engine."" An example of this is when James  Taylor tells Dennis Wislon to turn off the radio so he can hear the sound  of the engine.
The drivers downfall of course is when he falls in love  with the hitchhiker and his obsessions are no longer with the machine.
Having owned both a Pontiac GTO and several Mopars,the movie is very  refreshing and exciting, comparable only to perhaps ""Dirty Mary, Crazy  Larry"" and ""Vanishing Point"".

1111998,4,6305972370,"Two Lane Blacktop is one of those movies that you hear about long before you see it.  It seems that while every car guy I have ever run across has heard of Two Lane Blacktop, few have ever seen it.  Like Vanishing Point,  it examines on some level the disillusionment that came at the close of the  1960's.  It is a movie about outsiders; those that choose to be and those  that desperately do not wish to be.  The one thread that ties them together  is the road.
For a true gearhead, Two Lane Blacktop is a joy.  To see all  of the legendary sixties muscle cars in their natural environment.....it  calls to mind a tradition of (illegal) street racing that still exists  today, for better or worse. Anyone who has seen it or done it will  instantly be pulled into the movie.  Of course, the quintessential gray  primer 55 Chevy, an unbeatable home-built street warrior, is the true hero  of the film.
You don't see this movie for the dialogue and there isn't a  lot of it.  Some of the gearhead lingo is kind of lame, like where the gas  station attendant asks the Driver (James Taylor) if the 55 Chevy has a  ""Chevy block."" No duh.  Don't worry about it.  That isn't why you  are watching it.
This movie is a time machine.  As a 38 year old, I  vividly remember those days and those cars, but through the eyes of an  eight year old with Hot Wheels cars and a Dad that drove four door sedans  (still does).  I always wanted (and now have) fast cars.  Seeing this movie  for the first time 20 years ago poured even more fuel on the flame.  Getting the opportunity to see it has always been an elusive pleasure,  because it has been broadcast so rarely, and then often edited.  This past  Christmas, my girlfriend got me a copy in the collector's tin. I have  watched it several times since, sometimes very loud.  The movie has a deep  texture, maybe even more so than Easy Rider, from which comparisons can be  drawn.  You aren't watching the people alone in this movie, however.  Rather, you are taking in everything that is in it. The wide screen format  is only way to go. If only you could smell the fuel, the oil and the  burning rubber while you watch it.

A  wonderful flavor is the whine of the special cut gears of the '55 Chevy's  M22 transmission handling the power of the big 454 motor.
The austerity  and robot blankness of the characters and plot mate perfectly with the  barren mechanical environment.

Yet the the  obsessions of the main characters make it a timeless study of man's  connections to possessions, competition, and the camraderie of people with  common interests. Warren Oates' character is incredible and absolutely  unique in that he constantly talks about himself and yet we know virtually  nothing about him at the end of the movie because of his compulsive lying.  The hippy chick character (is she, maybe, 14 years old?) places the film  culturally in the early 70s, but the gear heads could be from the 1950s or  the 1990s.

7899693,3,6305972370,"If you want to see some decent staged street racing from time to time, then it's an ok movie. Otherwise it has no plot to keep it moving at all.  Singer-songwriter James Taylor and the Beach Boys' Dennis Wilson in their only acting roles play a driver and mechanic racing across the country from La to the east coast in a primered off 55 chevy. Not much of a car. Then they pick up a hitch hiking girl played by Laurie Bird which adds nothing to the movie. If you left out her role, it would not make any difference in the movie at all, there never was a plot to it to begin with. Along the way they meet Warren Oates's Pontiac GTO-driving wanderer and challenge him to a cross-country race - at stake: their cars' pink slips. Near the end of the movie, the girl leaves the 55 chevy bunch and takes off with a guy on a motorcycle. You never see GTO again. 55 leaves a diner and gets into a street race. An in car camera in the 55 shows him rowing through the gears of the 4 spd, but no engine sound and then the film melts mid race and it ends. You don't know who won the race, what happened to the girl hitch hiker, you never see GTO again, and you don't know who won the pink slip bet between 55 and GTO. Other than some real drag race scenes at a drag strip in Tn and some staged street races it's a pretty boring movie with little to no dialog. It's not on the top of any of my car movie lists. Too many other really great car movies out there that deserve top billing over this pile.",1519257600,,1488,4.027027027027027
