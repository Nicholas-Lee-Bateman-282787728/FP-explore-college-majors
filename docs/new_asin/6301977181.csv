404175,3,6301977181,"The Prince and the Pauper was Mark Twain's own personal favourite of all his tales and Hollywood would seem to agree with this authorial self-assessment as it is the most often filmed of his works

Having said that ,this lavish Warner Brothers movie from 1937 is not taken directly from Twain but from  a stage version of the story .It is the tale of two look-alike boys .One is the son of Henry V111 ,Prince Edward ,later to be the short lived Edward vi ,and the other a beggar boy from the streets of London ,one Tom Carty .These roles are played by respectively ,Bobby Mauch and his twin Billy .

They switch roles ,without declaring this and the beggar finds himself taken for the cossetted prince while Edward is thrust into the teeming London streets and narrowly escapes beating from his drunken and abusive father

While the beggar boy posing as prince is mired in court intrigue ,especially as he seeks to avoid manipulation by the devious Hereford(Claude Rains)the real Prince tries to resume his former life and is derided as mad when he insisits he is the real heir to the throne .He meets wondering freebooter Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn )whose initial sceptical amusement at the boy changes over time to a realosation that he is telling the truth and setsa out to restore the boy to his rightful place .This is no easy task in the face of attempted assassins and the need grows more urgent when King Henry dies and the coronation of the wrong boy seems inevitable

The Hal Wallis production is suitably ornate and the coronation scene is especially well mounted .Also adding substantially to the appeal of the movie is a strong Korngold score .

The problem for devotees of Errol Flynn as they watch the movie will be twofold .It takes some time for his character to appear and there is no strong female star for him to spark off against .For my money he was always at his best with a strong performer like de Havilland to inteact with and this is lacking here .The twins are earnest and likeable but not especially good actors but Rains as ever is excellent as the villain

Its a good movie but would have benefitted from getting Flynn into the action earlier by some script trimming

Enjoyable but not great",1122940800,7,2221,4.590909090909091
404176,4,6301977181,"In 1937, the WB, capitalizing on Errol Flynn's spectacular performances in CAPTAIN BLOOD and THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE, cast him in four films, with varying degrees of success. The best, by far, was William Keighley and William Dieterle's production of the Mark Twain classic, THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER, where he supported new WB 'discoveries' Billy and Bobby Mauch, portraying London urchin Tom Canty and his look-alike, Prince Edward Tudor. The twins were gifted, young (12 at the time of the filming) actors, with a Freddie Bartholomew-like quality of engaging innocence, and they gave this version of the oft-filmed tale a sense of reality that split-screen performances by a single actor could never achieve.
The story is an engaging one, as young Canty, inspired by his mother and a local priest to dream of a finer life than his father, an ill-tempered beggar (Barton MacLane) could provide, sneaks onto the grounds of Buckingham Palace. There, he meets young Prince Edward, who is thrilled to meet a boy his own age...and, after cleaning him up a bit, is astonished to discover that the pair could pass as twins. Edward decides this is a golden opportunity to see what life outside the Palace is really like, so, against Canty's misgivings, the two exchange clothing, and the Prince leaves...creating far more of an uproar than either boy could ever imagine!
Canty is soon considered 'mad', as he insists he is not Edward, and the Prince, abused and ridiculed by Tom's father, is unceremoniously thrown off the Palace grounds when he attempts to return, by a disbelieving Captain of the Guards (Alan Hale, in the first of 12 films he'd make with his friend, Errol Flynn). The ambitious Earl of Hertford (the always brilliant Claude Rains) investigates Canty's claim, and realizes, after interviewing the Captain, that the boy is telling the truth, giving him a golden opportunity to seize power. Ordering the Captain to find and kill the Prince, the Earl then threatens to kill Canty if he doesn't obey his commands.
Things grow desperate for the young Prince, as he attempts to evade his murderous 'father' on the streets, until Miles Hendon (Flynn), a roguish but good-natured 'soldier-for-hire' comes to his aid. Offering his protection to the lad, Hendon thinks him a bit balmy, as well...until events (the child's obvious despair over the death of Henry VIII, the Palace search party, and a sword duel with the Captain, where Flynn KILLS Alan Hale!!!) convince him otherwise. Then it becomes a race against time to smuggle the real King into the Coronation, before Canty is crowned, and the Earl assumes ""the Power behind the Throne"".
Blessed with a gifted cast, including wonderful character actor Montagu Love as the dying Henry VIII, the film offers a truly exceptional film score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold (who would eventually expand the theme into a symphonic work). Audiences have always been surprised that Errol Flynn's role is not larger, but as a faithful Twain adaptation, the focus had to be on the two boys, and not on the impoverished soldier. Flynn had fun playing Hendon, and the Mauch twins were nothing less than superb as the leads.
With THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD less than a year away, and Errol Flynn's star continuing to ascend, the WB had every reason to celebrate, and THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER is a pleasure to watch, to this day!",1062633600,99,3379,4.9298245614035086
404177,4,6301977181,"The Prince & The Pauper is based on the much loved Mark Twain classic.  In a nutshell, the plot centers around twins, one the spoiled heir to the English throne, a other a begger with a heart of gold.  When the two accidentally cross paths they become best friends and secretly trade places, much to the chagrin of one of the king's advisors (Claude Rains) who is plotting to kill the heir and take over himself.  Enter into this fray a fortune hunter (Errol Flynn) who vows to set everything right for king, country and a healthy financial reward.  It all ends pleasantly enough in a sword and swashbuckling sort of way.
WARNER HOME VIDEO gives us a handsome looking transfer that is sure to please.  The gray scale has been impeccibly balanced with solid blacks and very nice renderings of fine detail. Certain scenes exhibit a touch of edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization, but nothing that will distract from this visually stunning film adaptation.  The sound elements are somewhat disappointing by contrast.  The main title sequence in particular sounds as though the music track was discovered under a rock.  Nevertheless, dialogue - for the most part - is presented at an adequate listening level with only the slightest of pops, scratches and hiss.
EXTRAS: An essay and theatrical trailer - BIG DEAL!
BOTTOM LINE: The Prince & The Pauper is a visually stunning movie that, although straying somewhat from Twain's original intent, is nevertheless faithful enough to remind us why his name continues to be among America's greatest literary talents. The transfer is solid.  I recommend this DVD!",1062201600,59,1607,4.900369003690037
404178,4,6301977181,"I saw this move years ago and decided to watch it again after getting the part of Lady Jane Grey in a local production of Prince and the Pauper. I also bought the book and read it and I would say it is now a favorite! I'm not sure how but they were able to make an enjoyable movie based on a general outline but completely changing the story, but they did! I would recommend this movie but don't expect Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper.",1056412800,4,442,4.091954022988506
404179,3,6301977181,"Why were Errol Flynn and Claude Rains considered great actors?
Errol looks foolish and Claude appears to be dead.  The film itself is overlong, inaccurate, and very Hollywood.  Eric Portman, a great actor, is completely wasted.  Kind of fun if you
like old movies, otherwise don't bother.",1027209600,4,288,5.085106382978723
404180,3,6301977181,"Saw this WAY back when I was a lilGal, but when I rented it to show my sister-in-law and that toddler nephew so interested in sword fighting, it kinda missed with both of them.
One Mauch twin (Pauper) is talented, and the other (Prince) far less so. Both of them together couldn't equal one Freddie Bartholomew, who is who I kept missing as the movie progressed. He would have done an admirable job in this movie, I've no doubt, and if he had, it would be a well-known classic like his ""David Copperfield"". Sis-in-law actually wandered away more than once, which she never did during ""Lost Horizon"", an earlier rental success story.
Swordplay: Well, not many actors in Hollywood could handle a sword like Errol Flynn, but it seems AGES before he makes his appearance in the film. For a bit of a change of pace, he gets to run Alan Hale through! He had been an evil palace guard intent on killing the errant prince-now-king, you see. One reviewer was quite correct in pointing out that Flynn is not the true star of the movie. So, many may make the mistake of renting it to see Flynn and wind up saying, Hey what's with these twins all over the place? I wouldn't be surprised if that impacted its success factor when first released, because obviously Flynn's name would be the drawing card, not the Mauch twins. Toddler nephew's attention could not be held by this movie, unlike ""Adventures of Robin Hood"", which is a great favorite.
Best work: Although my old favorite Claude Rains is right on hand as the villainous noble blackmailing the hapless pauper, the big surprise was how good Montagu Love was as the ailing King Henry VIII. This same actor appeared in ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" as the Abbot of the Black Canon, the devious churchman who delivers the line, ""By what authority do you John Lackland claim the throne of England?"" at Errol Flynn's knifepoint at the coronation scene. Here he rises to the occasion, speaking of how the child king will not be able to trust any advisors and doing his best to muster all his strength for one last address to the court before pooping out and popping off. Chalk one up for this underutilized actor.
Verdict? Not one of anyone's best, except King Harry.",1019520000,3,2203,4.608142493638677
404181,4,6301977181,"In 1937, the Brothers Warner acquired a unique movie property - identical twin boys named Bobby and Billy Mauch; they looked so much alike that only their mother could tell them apart.  Inevitably, the studio decided to cast them in Mark Twain's THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER.  The fanciful tale was not only a natural for the Mauchs but had great timeliness because it includes scenes of an English coronation.  It's the story of  mistaken idenity involving Prince Edward, son of King Henry VIII, and Tom Canty, a beggar boy.  The confusion begins when the Prince takes the Pauper to the palace to play and for fun they swap clothes.  Beholding themselves in a mirror, they are amused in that they look exactly alike!............Errol Flynn does well in his role as Miles Hendon, a soldier of fortune and  Claude Rains in excellent as usual.  Although a lively, enjoyable comedy, this picture proves the Mauch Twins did not a great movie make, it is, however a colourful production nevertheless.",1004659200,9,992,4.863095238095238
404182,4,6301977181,"I've never read Mark Twain's novel to be able to say how closely this movie follows to the original story.  It certainly has the Warner Brothers' touch.  Errol Flynn is his usual dashing, dauntless self, perfectly at home  with a sword in hand.  Claude Rain again is the cunning, cultured villain,  and Alan Hale is a welcome face, although this time he is Flynn's foe  instead of friend.  As Prince Edward and his look alike beggar friend, the  Mauch twins are occasionally annoying, but for the most part quite  effective as the victims of a switch that learn to appreciate the other  side of life.  The story is fun and played with a lot of energy and humour.  Don't assume that this is an Errol Flynn video, because he really isn't  the star - the twins are the stars.  However, there is enough of Flynn to  keep his fans happy, and a good enough story and movie to keep everyone  happy (including children).",951004800,7,912,4.5030674846625764

404735,3,6301977181,"On paper it's hard to understand why the 1937 version of The Prince and the Pauper isn't better remembered today - lavishly filmed by Warner Bros. at their peak with Errol Flynn, Claude Rains and Alan Hale starring, Erich Wolfgang Korngold scoring and Sol Polito lighting for their Robin Hood co-director William Keighley (with help from an uncredited William Dieterle when he fell ill) with a literate and witty script and a real pair of identical twins (Billy and Bobby Mauch) who can act as well as the script demands, it should be an absolute winner but instead has to settle for entertaining but a little disappointing considering the talent involved. Part of the problem seems to be that 'lyrical' pacing that got Keighley replaced by Michael Curtiz on the Sherwood Forest gig - he's so in love with the scenes in the palace that the film's nearly half over before the Prince suddenly finds himself a Pauper and Errol Flynn enters the fray as his impoverished but stylish accidental protector. Indeed, despite his top-billing, Flynn's a minor supporting player here, all but disappearing from the film's finale as things threaten to draw to a standstill with what must be the longest coronation scene in screen history - nearly two reels, apparently designed to cash-in on the massive international publicity surrounding King George IV of Great Britain's coronation the week after the film opened.

At times the film feels both over-written - albeit entertainingly so, with some elegant verbal barbs - and under-plotted, lingering so long in court with the long time a-dyin' Henry VIII (Montagu Love) that it has to race through much of the Prince's rude awakening to life in the kingdom his double has inherited. Yet if it wastes its star for much of its running time, there's some choice-cut villainy from Claude Rains' would-be Lord Protector and Alan Hale's villainous Captain of the Palace Guard, here Flynn's enemy rather than his sidekick, and there are some interesting political machinations and a rare emphasis on the religious divisions of the time. It may be a couple of rewrites and some tighter editing away from a classic, but it's still one of the more entertaining versions of Twain's tale and works well enough for most of its two hours.

A word of warning - there are some public diomain releases of this but try to find Warner Home Video's Region 1 NTSC transfer instead, which boasts fine print quality and the original theatrical trailer, or their French PAL release (available from Amazon.fr as Le Prince et le Pauvre).",1332806400,2,2548,4.923255813953489

404737,5,6301977181,"""The Prince and the Pauper"" made in 1937 is grand entertainment
made in the old style when a good story, acting and entertainment
were the main considerations.

The stories by Mark Twain have made good subject material for
movies over the years and ""The Prince and the Pauper"" is no
exception.

The movie contains a wealth of character actors namely:
Errol Flynn as Miles Hendon
Claude Rains as Earl of Hertford
Henry Stephenson as Duke of Norfolk
Barton MacLane as John Canty
Billy Mauch as Tom Canty
Bobby Mauch as Prince Edward
Alan Hale as Captain of the Guards
Montagu Love as Henry VIII

The story begins when two boys are born on the same day in the
same year. One is Prince Edward the son of Henry VIII and the
other Tom Canty who was born in the slums of London.

By a strange twist of fate both meet when thay are young boys
and wanting to experience each others way of life they
exchange clothing. Both boys are identical in looks which
unfortunately is their undoing. Nobody believes them when they
try to tell the truth and return to their normal positions in
life.

The story is full of plotting and scheming by people in high
places who are anxious to remove the real prince from his
rightful position and replace him with the imposter who they
can manipulate to their own advantage.

Although the story is untrue it is told with sincerity to a
point where it is quite believeable.

The highlight of the movie is towards the end with an
elaborate, no expense spared coronation ceremony of the
young prince, nicely timed no doubt to coincide with the
coronation of George VI a week after its release.
Very impressive and no doubt replicating a real coronation.

Although he does not appear until half way through the movie,
Errol Flynn is in fine form, the identical twins Billy and
Bobby Mauch do a terrific job of acting and all are well
supported by good character actors.

Very entertaining.",1290729600,,1909,4.574780058651027

I wonder if people who wrote those positive reviews ever read the book. This is not common book for children, but the one you can read and enjoy at any age(unlike Dumas and Jules Verne). It's language is rich and convincing.
This movie looks like adaptation of another book with the same title and written by some 3-rd rate author. All that is good in the book is NOT here and apart from a few scenes (those rare ones that resemble Mark Twain)it is full of most predictable and shallow cliches.

This 1937 film adaptation of Mark Twain's classic novel THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER is the definitive version, although&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossed-Swords/dp/B000TXPXBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crossed Swords</a>&nbsp;and Disney's own remake (with Guy Williams, in 1962) are pretty damn good themselves. The plot tells the story, set in the year 1547, of two 10-year-old boys who look alike - one a grimy beggar boy, the other the bratty heir to the throne - and how, on a whim, they came to switch identities. This story also tells of how, for a time, the fate of England dangerously hung in the balance.

Plot SPOILERS begin.

While young beggar boy Tom Canty resides in the royal palace as the prince and being thought mad by the courtiers, Prince Edward VI, now wrested of his life of privelege, gets an eye-opening tour of the seedy parts of England and of the day-to-day struggles endured by his downtrodden subjects. Beset by bullies, Edward is rescued by the kind and dashing but down-on-his-luck mercenary soldier Miles Hendon, who then becomes Edward's bemused protector. Hendon is quite taken with his haughty, raggedy charge even if he doesn't really believe the lad's claims to royalty.

This also being an adventure story, there are villains afoot. Tom Canty's father himself is scum, prone to violence and intent on using his son for thievery. Then there's the deceitful and conniving Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains, who here sports a ne'er-do-well beard). He craves power and status at whatever cost and sends the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale) on an errand of murder. In the end, it all hinges on securing the Great Seal of England.

End SPOILERS.

As I've said, Errol Flynn strikes again! Fresh off the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Charge-of-the-Light-Brigade/dp/B000M2E30E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Charge of the Light Brigade</a>&nbsp;and, before that,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Blood/dp/B00005JMR7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Blood</a>, Flynn was tapped to play the role of the gallant Miles Hendon. Although the Mauch twins (Bobby and Billy) are very good and winning as Prince Edward and Tom Canty, Errol Flynn was the biggest reason the crowds flocked to this one. But be advised that he doesn't show up until half the movie's gone. Once he's there, though, he speedily makes his mark. Flynn wasn't really in that many scenes - no, the Mauch boys dominate those - but he's so dynamic a personality that he's the one image you walk away with. Also worth mentioning, by the way, are character actor Montagu Love's brief but standout performance as the dying monarch Henry VIII and Claude Rains's treacherous turn as the Earl of Hertford. Just to set the record straight, no one spat out venomous words quite so silkily as did Mr. Rains.

THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER is a perfect family film and offers enough intrigue and derring-do to gladden the swashbuckling heart. The pomp and spectacle, as well as the squalor and despondency, of 16th century London are vividly brought to life with the sweeping black and white cinematography and Mr. Korngold's stirring score. The story zips along mostly at a brisk pace, with the only exception being the lengthy coronation sequence. The movie treats us to a swordfight or two (not too many, but what we get is thanks to Errol Flynn). There are even flashes of Mark Twain's satiric social commentary, for those searching for depth in an adventure film. Lastly, there are also glimpses of humor, with some even provided by Errol Flynn, who does have a way with words and with facial expressions. And I did like the bit about the puzzled young Mr. Canty unwittingly drinking his royal bath water.",1195603200,2,3870,5.420265780730897
404850,5,6301977181,"Mark Twain's witty and delightful blending of historical fact forms the basis for this rousing ""trading places"" adventure in medieval London.

This is a film where you can turn off the picture and just listen to Erich Wolgang Korngold's wall-to-wall score, where each scene has its own theme, as do the leading characters.  Korngold envisioned his film scores as operas without words, where he pitched his music to that of the actor's voices, the melody varying in tone and tempo to reflect their feelings.  The climatic Coronation sequence, featuring St. Luke's Choristers, from Long Beach, CA, is spectacular.  This was one of the composer's favorite scores, which he later reworked into Violin Concerto in D. Op. 35. (The Itzhak Perlman Edition, EMI records Ltd 2003).

If this weren't enough, the period settings, costumes and mise-en-scene are incredibly detailed and richly textured.  The once-in-a-lifetime cast, headed by Errol Flynn, the remarkable Mauch twins, Claude Rains and a host of familiar Warners character actors, is impeccable.

Even Shawn, Prince Edward's giant Irish wolfhound, is a scene-stealer.

William Keighley's direction is first-rate, as is Sol Polito's black and white cinematography, where each set-up enhances the drama of the moment.  The term Black and White is clearly a misnomer... never more apparent than in viewing this film, with its shimmering silver halide crystals, which have never been more beautifully presented on the screen.  The transfer to DVD is stunning and the sound track comes through loud and clear on my system.

Hardly just a kids' film, this is one for the ages with its dark themes of poverty, child abuse, political skulduggery and talk of beheadings.  Rest assured that all's well that ends well, with Errol Flynn coming to the rescue in the nick of time!

In the words of the N. Y. Times in its original review: ""The novel and the screen have been bridged so gracefully that we can not resist in saying that the Twain and the movies have met.""",1179273600,15,2007,5.0638297872340425
404851,5,6301977181,"Errol Flynn was the ultimate swashbuckler, the most dashing hero that ever was, is, or will be. There are many imitations, but there has never been any who could truly match him, and I doubt will ever bee any who can even truly compare.

He made all the all the ladies dream and all the men wish they could be him (some admitted it, some did not, but they all did). However, that was not all he could do. There could be many better actors, but very few could make us dream as he did and does.

A lot has been said about Flynn, some good some bad, but his image remains  beyond the reach of comments and criticism. He was, and is, the stuff of which myths and legends are made, on and off the screen. And he still unsurpassed.

As it was so eloquently put in the film ""My Favourite Year"", it doesn't matter if it was an illusion. It worked. He could not have convinced us the way he did unless somewhere inside he had that courage. He was that silly goddamned hero! Nobody is that good of an actor.

Besides, we cannot use him 'life-size'. We all need Errol Flynns as big as we can get them!

Today, we put on airs and claim to be a lot more sophisticated an audience than we were at the time when his movies were made.

But, the truth is that when see him on the screen today, he still inspires in us the same feelings, from awe to envy, and everything in between. Of course, some of us would admit it, some of us wouldn't, but we all feel it

His movies still tell us what true heroes and adventures are all about- and if they are not, they should be.

I would more than recommend ""The Prince and the Pauper"", and any or Errol Flynn's movies, to anyone who still dares to believe in dashing heroes and is not ashamed to admit it.",1178409600,4,1730,4.125
