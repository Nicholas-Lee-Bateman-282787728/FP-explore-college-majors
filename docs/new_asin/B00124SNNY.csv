8243804,3,B00124SNNY,"This movie COULD have been great. Although it's hard to label this as a movie when it's really just a poorly-developed plot thread that strings together one poorly-directed lesbian sex scene after another.

It has some great-looking women in it--not a bad one in the bunch (with the exception of a black chick at the end) and there are six in all. But the scenes are so dull and drawn out that I literally fell asleep while watching it, then proceeded to wake up and fast-forward because the movie still was plodding along. Seriously...how long can you stretch out a scene in which two women have no more contact than fingertips on bare breasts? Seven minutes? 10? 12?

Not nearly explicit enough, not realistic enough, not enough natural on-set audio (only one scene). I'm not a big fan of lesbian sex in movies to start with, unless the scenes show a lot of contact and pretty much all of these do the opposite. Even one or two spread-leg views would have worked wonders for this movie. And at nearly an hour and a half long, there's far too much run time for far little material. The director went so far as to add in several stupid POV scenes of a neighbor just to help take up additional time. Potential unrealized.",1375142400,3,1220,4.540909090909091
