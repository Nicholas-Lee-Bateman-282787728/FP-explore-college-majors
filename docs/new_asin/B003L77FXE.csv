4142070,5,B003L77FXE,"Scarecrow and Mrs King Season 2, 3, and 4 really need to be released on dvd. This wonderfully funny, romantic, dramatic, and family-friendly housewife meets spy series has a large audience just waiting for the shows to become available again. Also, though the 80s were different (no cellphones) the romance and character interaction make this show accessible and addictive to the current generation as well as remaining addictive to my generation.",1288483200,,447,5.309859154929577

Some episodes look like there's a vintage filter over them they've discolored so badly. There's spots where they're slightly faster than they should be and spots where the framing seems wrong. The earlier seasons seemed fine, but 3 had some issues and now 4 is a disaster. If I didn't love the show this much...

They could have still ""advanced"" the relationship and the show by having them get closer and having her family find out more about the two of them, while keeping the whole premise and attraction of the show in tact. A show about them talking about buying a house and horses and being all over each other is not interesting...that kind of explicit relationship is all over tv and is not what made the show great in its 1st 3 seasons.",1460678400,2,718,4.609375

4142717,5,B003L77FXE,"Its always a joy to see the final season of an older TV show hit DVD since sometimes it takes forever.  Warner Brothers didn't make us wait super long for the final season of Scarecrow & Mrs. King.  Theyve released one a year for four years now.

Romance is definitely in the air in season four since Lee Scarecrow Stetson (Bruce Boxleitner) and divorced mother of two Amanda King (Kate Jackson) have secretly started dating.  They are keeping their relationship a secret since they both work for the Agency, a secretive spy branch that seems to track foreign agents in America but all over the world (think combining the FBI and CIA while running parallel to them).  Among the people they aren't telling are their boss Bill Melrose (Mel Stewart) and fellow agent Francine Desmond (Martha Smith).  Amandas family doesnt even know shes a spy, so they definitely cant tell her mother Dotty (Beverly Garland) or her two sons Phillip and Jamie (Paul Stout and Greg Morton).

Of course, all this romance comes with danger as the two work cases that involve national security.  Lees past comes back several times as a Soviet spy tries to get revenge in the two part opener.  He also learns something about his parents who died when he was a boy.  One of Lees contacts appears to die, only he might have faked his death.  Amanda, meanwhile, is finally on her way to becoming a full blown agent  that is until a photo from her past threatens her status as an agent at all.  The duo attempt to track down a man who has found a way to contaminate Washington DCs water before terrorists get a hold of him.  And even Amandas mother gets into the act in one episode when her new boyfriend is not who he claims to be.

About two thirds of the way through the season, Lee and Amanda marry.  I must admit I seriously don't get their relationship at this point because they are still sneaking around, but Amandas family has met Lee as her boyfriend.  Why the secrecy still?  Frankly, this show has never been that good with continuity.  Hey, its an 80s show, which means that serious story arcs just don't happen.  You get some advancement, but its never seriously tracked from one episode to another.

Speaking of the 80s, that comes through in the clothes and hair, most noticeably Martha Smiths as fashion conscious agent Francine.  You can also see it in the assortment of Soviet villains who appear, although the occasional Middle Eastern terrorist does pop up.

This show is often held up as an example of the Moonlighting curse  a show going downhill after the will they/wont they tension is resolved.  Based on the early part of the season, I don't think it would have been a serious problem.  Some of the scenes between them are great because they are finally together.  Bruce Boxleitner and Kate Jackson have great chemistry, and they play their relationship perfectly.  And yet, the show does go dramatically downhill after they get married.

Unfortunately, thats not the fault of anyone on the show.  From what I understand, Kate Jackson was diagnosed with breast cancer about that time in the run of the show.  Between surgery and treatment, she just couldn't carry on like she needed to as the star of a show.  The writers wrote around her, giving her only a couple scenes an episode and making Francine more of an active part of the show.  But the result loses the charm of the show.  After all, the heart of the show was always Lee and Amanda, and if they aren't on screen together, its just not the same.

Anything going on behind the scenes is never obvious on screen.  The acting from everyone is always great.  And I have to mention the recurring characters this season.  Theres Dr. Smyth (Myron Natwick) the new head of the agency who often causes more trouble than anything else.  Plus theres Lees regular informant T.P. (Raleigh Bond) who even becomes the focus of one episode..

Fans of the show pretty much know what to expect here.  Weve got all 22 episodes from the season  on five discs in their native mono sound and full frame picture.  Hey, this was the 80s, remember?  There are a few flaws with the picture, mostly with any stock footage used, but most fans of the show won't find any horrid flaws with the picture or sound.  Extras?  We haven't gotten any yet, why should we expect any now?  Yes, Id love to have one of the cast remembering their time working on the show, but Im just happy to have these episodes period.

Because Scarecrow and Mrs. King is a fun show in only the way that 80s TV can be.  Its light, but it entertains with characters you come to care about.  Im thrilled to have season 4 so I can enjoy the entire series for years to come.",1429574400,5,4673,4.5443645083932855

4142719,5,B003L77FXE,I remember watching this show in the eighties. I was so excited when I would find reruns of it that I would tape it on my VCR.

4142722,5,B003L77FXE,"I loved this series when it was being televised, and I don't get the channel on which it is currently syndicated. So, being able to purchase the series DVDs for my personal collection was great. These episodes were predictable and corny, but that was good TV to me. I didn't watch TV then or now for disturbing drama and stressful storylines. I wanted to relax and be entertained. I didn't have to cover my eyes or shriek in horror at what I heard when I watched two of my favorite actors on this show.  I was a fan of Bruce Boxleitner since his days on the How the West Was Won mini-series (1977). Kate Jackson has been one of my favorites since her days on Charlies Angels in the 70's as well. I always felt like her role was under-appreciated on Charlies Angels, so when she got the co-starring role in Scarecrow and Mrs. King with Boxleitner, I was overjoyed. She had the talent to carry this role, and she got better and better as the seasons rolled on. I liked the development of the personal relationship between the two main characters and how Scarecrow matured as a result of their relationship, and Mrs. King's abilities were more and more appreciated as her responsibilities at ""The Agency"" grew. As Amanda King had two sons and lived with her mother, this was also a great family show. I bought all four seasons because I know I will watch these over and over again. I consider it Feel Good TV at its best.",1426204800,,1418,4.432950191570881
4142723,5,B003L77FXE,"One of my favorite shows!  The last 4 episodes aren't great because Kate Jackson was sick in real-life so she's not in them much. But up until that point, it's a great show!

4143409,4,B003L77FXE,"This season was to be the best, but real life interrupted and changed the script. Kate Jackson had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and had been in severe pain, and was very ill from it. She soldiered on for her fans. By mid season she just didn't have it in her to continue, hence the entrance of Francine to a more prominent role in the series. No spoilers here, however it was still a good season all things considered.

I would love for them to bring this back, you just don't see shows like this anymore. Everything has to either be over the top dramatic, or over the top comedy...very few shows combine them both as well as this show did.

One recommendation...If you like this show...try Covert Affairs.",1371772800,6,712,4.511627906976744

The last few episodes of this final season were not as good due the absence of much on-screen time for Mrs. King due to Kate Jackson's battle with breast cancer.  However, three of the best episodes of the series are Stemwinder, Pt. 1, Stemwinder, Pt. 2 and Nightcrawler and they are on this DVD.  I highly recommend this show.",1369180800,,487,4.627906976744186

It was also a good picture of the Cold War and should be viewed by those who were too young to have lived through it.  My only quibble is that it fell off after (spoiler alert!!) Lee and Amanda got married.  Maybe that's when the cancellation notice came out.  In any case, watch all four seasons in order as they build upon each other.",1368144000,,448,4.493827160493828

The chemistry between these two actors made the series.
It was with sadness that I learned this was the last season.  Upon research I learned that Kate Jackson was diagnosed with cancer midway through the season and treatment affected her ability to continue the series.  I am happy to report that she recovered from her cancer and is still alive today.

4143702,5,B003L77FXE,"Scarecrow and Mrs. King Season 4 was the last season for the series. It was one of the best in my opinion as it was showing how Lee and Amanda tried to make their work and home lives balance as they were now husband and wife without anyone else finding out.

I was so excited to receive this and as soon as I finished watching season 3, I opened season 4 and proceeded to watch all day one Sunday till I was done.",1366156800,,413,3.9759036144578315

4143776,5,B003L77FXE,"As with my reviews of previous years of this TV show, our family continues to enjoy this series, as an alternative to the current TV fare, the majority of which we avoid, especially the so-called sit-coms.  The interaction of Scarecrow, Mrs. King and her mother, and the story lines are enjoyable, evidence better than average story lines and dialog suitable for the whole family.",1365724800,,380,4.9375
4143777,5,B003L77FXE,"The irony with shows that have these ""romance/tension"" components is that when the audience finally ""gets what it wants"" i.e., the couple get together, and in the years of this series, that meant getting married, it really puts the show in a bind over how to keep the story lines interesting. This show handled that very well and resolved everything before the end. There was a similar situation on JAG with the ""almost, but not"" hit and miss romance between Harm and Mac. The difference is, after 9 years of their ""near misses"", the producers decided to pull the plug and they threw together a half-baked ending show leaving Harm and Mac planning on getting married, but not resolving the problems connected to it. They could have at least had a ""final"" episode that closed all the loose ends.",1365724800,,794,4.719424460431655

4143785,5,B003L77FXE,"For fans of S&MK this is required viewing. But this set, like all the other seasons -- is spartan. There are no extras. The image quality is pretty much what you'd expect for a 1980s videotaped show. This series was definitely not digitally remastered. These are bargain produced discs for a relatively small buying audience. But hey, they're better than my old VHS tapes with commercials (except sometimes it's amusing to watch those, too), and I'm glad to have them.

It was during this season that Kate Jackson was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent treatment. The plots reflect her reduced involvement. In fact, in the final three or four episodes the show seems to be transforming in ""Scarecrow,"" with Mrs Stetson nee King in a barely supporting role. I wonder what an additional season would have been like?",1364601600,,821,4.906474820143885

The video was herky jerky and stopped a couple of times while the audio went on.  I don't know if that's streaming or what, but I've watched more than 100 videos from Amazon Prime and that hasn't happened on 98% of the shows.  I love Amanda and Lee.",1364601600,,407,4.113924050632911
4143887,5,B003L77FXE,"I love the storylines and the banter between Scarecrow and Mrs King.  It is interesting to watch Amanda as her skills as a spy increase.  Also, the romance aspect between them is a slow processes, but worth the wait.  Plus, it is clean and they don't jump into bed.  They demonstrate sexual purity, a quality rarely seen now-a-days in newer productions that have couples having premarital sex as soon as they get engaged!  It is possible to remain chaste until your wedding day and it is worth it.  Delores",1364515200,,506,4.629213483146067

Amanda has a good personality, she is a good sport, she doesn't seem to hold a grudge against Francine who is obviously jealous of her. She has a strong self esteem since all the little depreciating remarks she has to put up with from Lee and Francine in the first 2 seasons don't seem to phase her. Her mother is pretty much raising her kids while she saves the country from nefarious, evil covert  operators but they don't seem the worse for it. Bruce Boxleitner is just there to look good and I don't know what he would do or where he would be without Amanda.",1364428800,,615,4.301724137931035

We weren't disturbed by some of the improbable and silly scrapes Lee and Amanda got themselves into, or the total ignorance of Amanda's mother and sons. It was just good clean fun. I never saw the last two seasons because we had both moved on to other jobs and I didn't have a TV any more, so I never knew that Lee and Amanda finally got together--sort of. I enjoyed reliving some of the earlier memories and then seeing how it all came out.

It was also very fun to revisit an earlier, more innocent time in our history. Of course, at the time, it didn't seem as innocent, but it's hard to find a TV show now where two people would be falling in love without living together already--where there was still a general consensus that to become lovers meant to commit to each other in marriage.",1362787200,,918,4.30635838150289

No gory plotlines, no vulgarity, no dark or disturbing themes.  It's funny, sweet, light, and it doesn't hurt that the main characters are easy on the eyes ;) They treat each other with a respect you rarely see in real life these days, let alone in the degraded-fictional life presented to us by Hollywood today. (When was the last time you saw a man open a car door for a woman???)  The whole show celebrates everything that was once great about America and makes me nostalgic for my childhood.

If you are old enough to remember the 80's, get this show and relive the good ole days!  If you are too young to remember the 80's, get this show anyway.  Consider it a history lesson so you understand what older people are talking about when they complain about how crappy today's television has become.",1361059200,,921,4.479041916167665

I was at first a little concerned that Kate Jackson seemed only to pop in and out of a lot of these stories rather than being in the story start to finish then I found out during the filming of this season she had to deal with breast cancer and surgery. It was a hard battle so I guess that is why there is no Season 5.

4144392,4,B003L77FXE,"Scarecrow & Mrs King had a fantastic First Season because the characters had places to grow, plus they had great dialogue. It's hard to keep that energy going, although it helps that the electricity between Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner could power a Cuisinart. Once you ""consummate"" a screen romance with mutual I-love-yous, it's hard to stuff that genie back in the bottle...which is essentially how S3 ends. In Season 4, the cute dialogue comes back stronger and the writers find a way of extending the romantic tension between Lee and Amanda - by giving them a new secret. Sadly, as Kate Jackson had to take care of some medical challenges in real life, the show producers either for contractual reasons, or another, chose to stick to schedule and write around Ms. Jackson's absence by giving her single scenes - and eliminating the Amanda character in almost any of the plot. Her absence quickly reveals how critical Kate's energy is to making the show compelling.",1360713600,2,973,4.903030303030303

The dynamic between Lee and Amanda only got better after they admitted how they felt for each other and decided to do something about it. I know towards the end of the series it was a light on Mrs. King (or actually, Mrs. Stetson), but considering what Kate Jackson was dealing with at the time, they did manage the little moments that made the show great.

I know, later on the series falls a bit when KJ is barely on screen and there is no season/series finale in which we finally get to see them admit everything to Mother and the boys, Billy and Francine (that's what fanfiction is foe) but considering Kate' circumstances (cancer battle) at the time, it's forgivable. I only wish TV then was like today in the sense that, nowadays, they would've gone on hiatus and finished/aired once she'd had time to recover. I haven't given up hope for some sort of reunion special movie (Dr. Quinn got like 48 of those!) but in the meantime, I am super happy to have this to complete my set.

The chemistry between boxleitner and jackson was amazing and i don't know about other viewers but i saw the budding romance from the beginning, i lost count at how many times amanda and lee shared a moment of fixing a article of clothing,a touch and how many times did lee grab and hold hands with amanda during their cases without really thinking about it. it was those little things that i remember and made this non romantic heavily cynical woman(guess i got a little bit of the romantic then) enjoy this show all over again. The action kept me glued in front of the television. I truly wish they had made a tv movie to let us know what happened with amanda,lee and the gang.so happy to own all the 4 seasons.

If your into major violence this won't be your cup of tea. while it has violence there are no bullets exploding through brains and very few gruesome scenes if any. like i said it was more innocent less bloodthirsty then these times are. It can be corny too but hey, it was the 80's.",1359590400,,1235,4.3652173913043475

Cast bios/filmography, bloopers, etc. Anything from the making of the show to the behind the scenes events during the show's production would've been great. That being said, I still love the box set for each season, especially this one.

After the 3rd season ended, so many questions needed to be answered. They were, & then some, but like all great shows, more questions cropped up in their place. I wasn't old enough to watch this show when it first aired, but saw one ep & fell in love with it. It wasn't until the series was released on DVD that I got to fully appreciate everything  about it.

I am purchasing the fourth season episode by episode. The fourth season is the one in which Kate Jackson grew ill with breast cancer. I'm sure they did the best they could, but the apex of the season is the first two episodes: Stemwinder 1 and 2. Even their wedding half way through the season was a disappointment to fans. We had waited four seasons for Mrs. King and Scarecrow to get together. Other than Stemwinder episodes, we never really got to enjoy it. It might have been best if the series ended after Stemwinder because other than a few other good episodes, the series kind of sputtered and then died.",1359158400,,778,4.335616438356165

While the quality of the episodes are of the same quality as the previous releases, the DVD menus are not which is extremely disappointing. The menus look amatuerish and unfinished as though the company putting them out was about to miss their deadline and rather than delaying the release they hurriedly popped them in the box and out the door. The buttons on the main menu are not seamlessly intergrated into the background like they are in the previous releases. The menu screen for the episodes is worse- a blank blue screen with generic round buttons with little TV icons in them and the name of the episode after them. It looks terrible. I sincerely hope that this is a fluke or a flaw in the initial release of the DVDs and subsequent releases will be corrected.

I have to laugh when watching these old programs.  Sometimes they are so goofy at what they wanted us to imagine, but I thoroughly enjoyed them then and now.  It's fun with a lot of comedy... can't be compared with some of the drivel that's put out there as comedy today.  I want a good, heartfelt chuckle!

Sure, some of the gimics are just that.... but they just made the stories better.  The connection between Scarecrow and Mrs. King was so much fun... whether they were laughing, arguing, or just looking at each other.  Haven't seen much of that in newer shows either.

If you want a fun show to watch and enjoy the connections between people:  Amanda & Scarecrow; Amanda and her family; their co-workers; just a well written program.

Please release the rest of the DVD's .... and not in a box....I've already bought the ones I can get!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarecrow-and-Mrs-King-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B003L77FWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarecrow and Mrs. King: The Complete Third Season</a>&nbsp;Bring on the rest!!!!",1345420800,,1315,5.330097087378641

I enjoyed this show when it was on and would very much like to complete the series.  What I enjoy(ed) about this show had to do, not only with the repartee between Amanda and Lee, but also the whole cast.  It was (and is) fun to watch, get involved with the stories, get to travel to Europe and so on.

4144725,5,B003L77FXE,"Yes, some would wonder why I rate Scarecrow and Mrs. King at five stars. True, some of the plots are a little corny and trite; true, the eighties-style wardrobe can get a little garish; true, some of the sets aren't the best; however, the acting and the dialogue amply make up for any trivial shortcomings antagonists of Scarecrow and Mrs. King can contrive. All of the main actors do a superb job in making a very simple and humorous story come to life. The interaction between Lee and Amanda particularly flares with delightful warmth of varying degrees. One of the most alluring aspects of the series is the development of their relationship. I have seen the first two seasons and find myself pleasantly addicted. The third and fourth seasons, though, I have yet to see. Naturally, my anticipation of their release on DVD is great, and I am issuing a plea to Warner Bros to release the remaining seasons as soon as possible.",1318896000,27,927,4.693251533742331

Please, WB, please do not make us wait another 2 years before Seasons 3 and 4 get released.

Hey, you can charge a bit more, I don't care.  I'm willing to buy the remainder of the DVDs (Seasons 3 and 4) NOW!

So, please Warner Bros & the Powers-that-Be, please make those seasons available on DVD for us -- the sooner, the better.

Thanks & I also want to say thank you to Kate Jackson for Shoot The Moon Productions, for believing in such a great concept show as SMK (and for casting Bruce Boxleitner as Lee Stetson) -- what a talented cast of actors!  I love you all!

This TV show (Scarecrow and Mrs. King) is a great mix of adventure, intrigue, humor, romance & more. PLEASE release ALL seasons to DVD. I've got season 1 & can't wait to get my hands on the rest!!! This show is responsible for my teenage crush on Bruce Boxleitner (was 12 years old when it 1st aired on TV), which then led me on to being a big fan of Babylon 5 as well.

She always found unique ways to save the day during fist fights and or gun fire. She never stays put. Bruce B. Is a beautiful man to look at. His character develops thru his love for Amanda but he remains tough and driven. It's sad Kate J. got sick and they couldn't work together in the field in final episodes of season 4 but the love was still there. Watched it the first run, loved it again.
