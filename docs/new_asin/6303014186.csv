7835531,5,6303014186,"This video is one of my favorites that Shari Lewis did.  Whenever she tells stories, it is so magical almost, because she can change her voice into what she wants.  My favorites on here would have to be ""The Lion and the Mouse"" (one of my personal favorites that Shari has ever done.  It shows Shari was very flexible), ""Little Red Riding Hood"" (not the way you think.  It is very hip and it demonstrates Shari as a wonderful dancer (like I said above)); but there are several that are right up there with them:  ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" (the way she told it to the monkey was so adorable, but she never faltered with her voices either), ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (""Every time you clap your hands together, I black out!""), ""Pied Piper of Hamlin"" (This story never fails to impress me, no matter what Shari does with it.)

All in all, a wonderful video, and definitely one to watch with your family.  A+++!!",1312156800,,908,4.5

7835533,5,6303014186,"Taped live at the Elko Theater in Elkhart, Indiana, the first hour of this show is hilarious stand-up comedy, geared for women, who comprise about 90% of Chonda's audience. With her twangy voice and infectious giggle, some of her stories are sidesplitting, with a wide range of topics, from the horrors that can happen while she is on tour, and her ""honeymoon package"" vacation in Cancun, to Nascar racing and husbands who like to hunt. There is something so real and likable about her, that she is endearing as well as funny, and she serves up a healthy portion of bright and refreshing entertainment.
Chonda also has a strong voice, with the kind of sound that would do well on a Broadway stage, and she sings three songs during the course of the tape.
The last fifteen minutes of the performance takes a 180* turn, and her audience goes from laughter to tears. Chonda tells of her trip to Israel and visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and also about taking her daughter to a Passion Play in Arkansas; it is powerful testimony, spoken with sincerity, and so very moving; it would be hard to watch this without weeping, and it is my favorite part of the tape.
At the completion of the show, there is a music video where Chonda is joined by Sandi Patty for a rousing rendition of ""The Girls Are Back in Town"", with punk hair and a spunky attitude.
Called ""The Queen of Clean"", this wonderful comedienne from Tennessee is immensely talented, and her ministry goes straight to the heart. Total running time is 87 minutes.",1074038400,23,1527,4.617647058823529
