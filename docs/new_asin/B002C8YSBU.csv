3905372,5,B002C8YSBU,"I got an advance copy of the DVD set and it's great! Four DVDs (containing all 24 season two episodes) in two plastic cases slide inside a cardboard slipcase. All episodes have been vibrantly remastered and are uncut (running times are almost always 24 mins and 55 seconds). This is a big improvement over season one, that had too many edited-for-syndication episodes (including a cameo appearance of Mary Tyler Moore playing Mary Richards in the pilot episode!). Almost every season of RHODA had a slightly different theme song--season one had the ""My name is Rhoda Morganstern..."" opening; season two replaces her narration with ""La-la-la-la-la""s. Guests this season include Ruth Gordon (an EMMY nominated performance as Carlton the doorman's mother), Vivian Vance, Jack Gilford, Eileen Heckert, John Ritter, Norman Fell (as a doctor Ida thinks she's having an affair with), Tim Matheson, Joan Van Ark (as Joe's first wife) and Ron SIlver (but not as Gary Levy). This second season is filled with hilarious, well-written episodes. Besides Ruth Gordon's nomination, this 1975--76 season earned EMMY nominations for Valerie Harper (she'd won the previous year), Julie Kavner (who'd finally win in the fourth season), and Nancy Walker (who earned 7 EMMY nominations between McMILLAN & WIFE, RHODA and a guest shot on THE GOLDEN GIRLS--and never won; she was the Thelma Ritter of TV). Sadly, there's no extras (you'd think Valerie Harper would be happy to do a commentary or two or film a short rememberance of the series). But the set is beautiful looking, unedited, and still wildly funny.",1266624000,28,1589,5.162790697674419
3905373,5,B002C8YSBU,"I'm so excited that Shout is releasing Season 2 of Rhoda.  This is such a great series and this is one of the best seasons.  This season focuses on Rhoda and Joe's married life and it is a lot of fun. Shout is releasing it with complete and remastered!!  Let's all support it so that ""Phyllis"" will be released.  That would be so wonderful!",1255651200,16,340,4.265625

3905379,4,B002C8YSBU,"If you love Mary and feel like you need more of a similar quality show, with a similar underdog, with a similar likability, then Rhoda is up your alley. Let's face it, there was never enough of the MTM show. We've watched them over and over. We wanted more. So we got into Rhoda. Though it's not quite a good as Mary, Rhoda will certainly give you more of the MTM universe. I was always partial to Rhoda and so have found it easy to let go of Minneapolis and follow Rhoda on her continuing life's journey. I think if you give it a chance you'll enjoy this show as much as we do.

I'd give it a B+/A-. Easily rewatchable. Lots of laughs.",1402272000,2,636,4.129032258064516

3905384,4,B002C8YSBU,"Rhoda is definitely an underrated series. The third season contains some episodes that are lemons but the bulk are good. Plus, unlike the first season, the third season looks great. Highly recommended.",1371772800,,201,5.3125
3905385,5,B002C8YSBU,I love Rhoda and it is wonderful to watch these episodes again.  Great laughs.  They just don't make tv series like this anymore.  Takes me back to a simpler time.  Sending love and thanks to Valerie Harper for giving us a lot of joy!,1369612800,6,234,4.25

3905392,5,B002C8YSBU,I LOVE the Rhoda series so this season was where a lot happened. Joe was phased out of the picture and her life went on. It spoke to a lot of women of the 1970's. This was a funny and heart warming edition.,1364256000,,206,3.813953488372093

3905400,5,B002C8YSBU,"Rhoda's seccond season builds on the first. Rhoda is married to Joe with her sister Brenda living downstairs, and the drunken Carlton in the lobby. Nancy Walker and Harold Gould are semi-regulars as her parents. From what I have read, the writers had difficulty writing Rhoda as a married woman, so there were a decent number of episodes that featured the single, Rhoda-esque Brenda. The show is a typical MTM production, which is enjoyable character-based comedy. Even when the shows are not laugh out loud funny, the dialogue is humorous and clever.

There are some outstanding episodes and guest stars, including the one and only Ruth Gordon, as Carlton's mother, a bag lady. Vivian Vance, whom I adore, guest starred as a new neighbor with whom Rhoda strikes up a close friendship. Because Vivian is around Ida's age, Ida becomes insanely jealous. Other guest stars include Eileen Heckart, John Ritter, and Normall Fell, who plays Ida's doctor with whom she becomes emotionally involved.

One disappointment was that there were no crossover appearances with Mary Tyler Moore this season. Valerie Harper and David Groh do make an appearance on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"".",1357171200,4,1175,5.082901554404145
3905401,5,B002C8YSBU,"Great show with funny characters & nice guest stars. Rhoda was a spin off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, so her character was already well established. I'd highly recommend it.",1355184000,3,177,4.741935483870968
3905402,5,B002C8YSBU,Rhoda returns for a second season of fun and I found it to be better than the first season and I hope to own the complete series one day soon.,1350777600,,142,3.7666666666666666
3905403,4,B002C8YSBU,I remember this show from the Seventies! It's fun to watch with lots of laughs. The theme song is the most annoying I've ever heard though. I have to mute it or it's stuck in my head for a week. It makes the Green Acres theme sound like Mozart.,1283558400,,244,4.0
3905404,5,B002C8YSBU,"The second season of Rhoda is even better than the first season! It seems to pick up steam as it goes, and has some very funny episodes. Rhoda is coming into her own and the storylines continue to be interesting. The actress who plays her sister (julie Kavner) is so funny also. I highly recommend this for bringing back memories, or enjoying a funny comedy show. It really is classic and doesn't seem to matter that it was filmed decades ago. Great show!",1275696000,7,455,4.493975903614458
3905405,5,B002C8YSBU,I just love Valerie Harper in Rhoda. I own Season 1 so I want to add to my collection.,1274745600,,86,3.5789473684210527
3905406,5,B002C8YSBU,"I so enjoy the antics of Rhoda & her family again, as I did when Rhoda was on Mary Tyler Moore. I found it very funny & heartwarming.  recommend it highly.",1271635200,3,155,4.0
3905407,5,B002C8YSBU,"I was so excited to see this notice! I live in Brazil and we also had this trio (Mary, Rhoda and Phyllis) shows in the 70's. But the one I liked and laughed most was with Cloris Leachman's Phyllis (by the way I've just bought her autobiography - Cloris - with George Englund!), and I'm really looking forward seeing Phyllis released! I wasn't able to understand all the introduction song lyrics then, sung in English, but it showed a lot of enthusiastic aspects of a charming life and personality, featuring an all-smiles Phyllis in all of them, giving a gleaming aura to each one. And the song went on: ""Who makes a cross around the... Golden Gate ;...""(who does this, who does that, and the Grand Finale : ""Who? Phyllis? It sure isn't you!"". Cut to Cloris Leachman astonished and caught by surprise expression that this disappointing revelation triggered! It was the beginning of a half hour of pure fun! And when all 3 appeared together it was promise of certain amusement. I don't forget the episode when Rhoda won one Miss something Contest, and at the beginning was ashamed of telling Phyllis, and said she was a runner-up. Then, all by herself, she began to enjoy the feeling, all dressed up with the winner ribbon, Phyllis comes in all of a sudden, sees it and says something like ""they made a bustle out of this second place"" to what Rhoda answered : ""Darling, I won!""",1270944000,2,1377,4.6016260162601625
3905408,3,B002C8YSBU,"Sad to say that the show could not keep up the sharp, smart sparks from Season 1.  RHODA made one huge mistake in season one:  getting her married so soon, so fast.  Why??  Was it the network?  the producers??  Harper herself?  The ratings held up for Season 2 but CBS/producers felt that viewers wanted Rhoda single, not Rhoda married, so the season is bittersweet in that poor Joe does not last much in Season 3.  I wish the wedding took place in Season 2 and perhaps a baby in Season 4.  Can you imagine Ida as a grandma?  There was much potential in the show in re to the themes that could have been discussed--being a stepmother, being a wife and wanting a career in the 1970s in NYC, et al., but instead the scripts in Season 2 were very generic and could have been used in any other show at the time.  The pluses are the strong cast and guest spots, including one of the last bits by the great Vivian Vance.",1268524800,12,914,4.22543352601156
