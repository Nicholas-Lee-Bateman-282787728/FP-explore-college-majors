8456130,5,B00542USA6,"Painfully good.  Hard to understand the accents, but perhaps don't need to. The actors are able to communicate so much so sensitively. So much love!  Aaron Taylor, the older half-brother is my absolute favorite. He embodied a criminal who does not quite know what to do with his heart of gold. But he figures it out -- courageously. (Spoiler) The scene where he climbs up the balcony (rather than knocking at the door) to confront his father and his perfect family is perfect.  He's not violent or angry, just strong and even kind in this scene

My movie partner didn't think the death added to the movie or made sense; I did, It was true and realistic to me -- could easily happen at any time-- and underscored the tough life the characters had to negotiate their way through.  The accidental nature of the death creates a connection with all of us, whether rich or poor.  Most people watching won't want to be reminded that we are all in this thing called ""life"" together, hence may want to avoid this type of movie.

The maturity of these broken people, their growth! -- both as individuals and in relationships! For example, the 14 year old baby-napper played by Thomas Brodie-Sangster, in trying to persuade his older half-brother to somehow save, or make, some kind of family -- pleads for his Mom in the face of her mess-ups:  ""Everyone makes mistakes.  Everyone makes mistakes!""

This movie exhibits love and mature attitudes from young people facing seemingly dark futures -- which actually bodes well for them. I love the way the two girls/women negotiate their own relationship as their situation and needs change. These youths seem to be coming to terms with who they are and to an ever-changing reality.  Moving and beautifully done.  Even the baby actor is an inspiration.",1478908800,,1786,4.762987012987013
8456131,3,B00542USA6,The story moved along very slowly. It's was an okay movie but not one I'd want to watch again. I did think Thomas Sangster did a good job with what he had to work with.,1458259200,,168,3.8285714285714287
8456132,5,B00542USA6,"A great and interesting film, bittersweet, and melancholy, a good independent film. It arrived packaged perfectly and early. All in all I'm very happy.",1446768000,,151,5.333333333333333
8456133,4,B00542USA6,"A story about three brothers struggling toward an impossible dream. Excellent performance by Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Oddly, in the end, things work out for the best, while simultaneously working out for the worst. In a sense, I would classify this movie as ""Slice of Life"", we don't get the back-story, and we don't get to see what happens after, just that one slice of time in the middle. Well worth watching and especially for those who like Indie drama. Less so for the Hollywood Blockbuster crowd.",1429228800,,501,4.905882352941177
8456134,3,B00542USA6,"Not a bad movie, not great eather. Appears to be a story that points out that a National Socialistic goverment is doomed to fail. This is just as true for the U.S. as it is for the U.K.",1428969600,,185,3.8947368421052633
8456135,1,B00542USA6,"Boring, and too many F-words.  Thought this might be a good family movie...wrong.",1425945600,,81,5.230769230769231
8456136,2,B00542USA6,"Poorly produced and directed. May have greater appeal in Britain. Sangster's, acting was not up to his usual standards.  It was difficult to follow the disjointed flow of the movie. The writing was really poor.",1367971200,,210,5.0
8456137,5,B00542USA6,First I was pleased to order the video as the movie never showed in theaters in my area. As a Sanger fan since Love Actually it has been enjoyable to watch his acting capabilities emerge. In this movie he is in a serious role and the plot has a bittersweet English turn. He does an admirable job with the role as well the phonetics in his speech. I believe he is even taller than in Nowhere Boy. Item was shipped promptly and in a correctly sized carton per Amazon's usual standards. Now if someone can tell me where I can purchase a DVD of the short The Alchemists Suitcase I will be extremely happy and grateful,1338681600,2,613,4.293103448275862
8456138,5,B00542USA6,"I think that young Mr. Thomas Sangster is one of the most promising young actors today.  I've seen several of the films that's he's acted in and was never disappointed.  As a social worker, I've had the opportunity to meet young men and women dealing with the challenges of being marginalized. Poor whites in our country and Great Britain are sometimes forgotten.  Yet many have been handicapped by economic and social segregation that is as deadly as race, gender, or sexual preference.  Young white males seem to have the greatest rage about their plight and often strike back through violent crime.  The effort of this young teen in trying to keep a fragment of his family together is heart rendering.  And the quest for the ""missing father"" is played out again and again in their lives.  This film rings through to these and other themes.  And Thomas is very convincing in his portrayal of his character.
