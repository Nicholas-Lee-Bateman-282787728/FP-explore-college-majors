8084194,3,B000BB1NFO,"This is basically a DVD on the various prophets of the various religions and their descriptions of doomsday.  It's done very well, but there are several mistakes in it, which I'm not sure how much of a big deal I should make over them:

1) At one point this video says that electrical current moving through a material like a wire actually spirals around the outside -- and that is false.  While electrons moving through a wire do tend to flow more through its outermost skin, there is no spiraling at right angles to its length -- that would, instead, be magnetism, which comes into existence at right angles to any moving electrical charge.  It's something called the ""right-hand rule"" in physics; don't take my word for it -- look it up yourself.

2) At 19:40 into the documentary the narrator says that Mohammad was born in 1570 AD, and that is false -- off by exactly 1,000 years: Mohammad was actually born in 570 AD.  Hopefully someone just misread a cue card and doesn't really think Mohammad was born in 1570 AD, even though time in Arab culture does tend to always stand still and never evolve.

The beginnings of this disk are your standard religious militancy with regard to the infallibility of establishment prophets and the ability of ancient peoples to discern a ""genuise"" prophet from a ""false"" prophet, with the punishment for being a ""false"" prophet being death.  How they would discern this before giving all prophecies a chance to actually come true or not, is a fine example of eye-rolling whateverdom.",1485388800,,1524,4.724528301886792

8084196,2,B000BB1NFO,This whole video builds to convince people we are living in the end times.  It's not really my first interest so I wasn't the target audience.  The first 10-15 minutes gave some interesting historical background.  After that it's all mushroom clouds and batten down the hatches.,1397606400,,278,5.0
8084197,5,B000BB1NFO,"This was simply the best documentary I have seen on this topic.  It ties all the prophets of old together.  It talks about all the major prophets in the three Abrahamic Faiths.  One of my favorite prophets, Zoroaster or Zarathustra is mentioned.  I found it to be inspirational.  It is definitely worth the price.  I recommend it...",1227225600,,332,4.7368421052631575
