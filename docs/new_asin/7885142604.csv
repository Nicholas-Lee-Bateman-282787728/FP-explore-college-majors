1137340,4,7885142604,"A well made and entertaining romp through period China. Obviously influenced by western ""Big Bang"" film styles exemplified by the likes of Indiana Jones and Robert Downey Jnr's Sherlock Holmes, the movie demonstrates that Asian directors can produce blockbuster type epics with the same skill as those from the US. Great sets, a maze-like plot, an interesting cast of characters, and plenty of action make for an enjoyable 2 hours of escapist Saturday matinee type of viewing.",1454630400,,476,5.194805194805195

I was hoping for a movie version that would be like these stories. Well, I do like the Dee person in the movie. He looks like I would expect a younger Dee to look. And his character  traits seem as great as that of the judge in my beloved books. And I do like the beauty of the scenery, architecture and interiors. Even the grim fantastic places have eye appeal. But I hate the stupid artificial agility by which the characters spin like dervishes, brandish horrible looking weapons and leap tall buildings at a single bound. Yeccchhh! Too much noise, too much violence, too much that's ridiculous. My husband likened the action to cartoons where the character gets flattened by a steam roller and bounces right back in the next frame.

1137601,5,7885142604,"In the trailer, the movie is described as ""Crouching Tiger... meets Sherlock Holmes."" And that is a perfect description for this movie. This Chinese film combines the grace, fluidity, and magic of the romanticized martial arts common to such films, with the action and mystery of Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes. If you're looking for a CSI mystery, don't watch this, but if you like the aforementioned genres, or urban fantasy-mysteries, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Moreover, I liked this film because I didn't figure who the villain was before the reveal. I read/watch a lot of mysteries, so it's rare to find a one where the ""who done it"" is actually a surprise to me.

Beautiful costuming, sweeping panoramic scenes, excellently doen CGI and special effects.  The story was really good too.  You aren't sure ""who done it"" until near the end.

1138052,4,7885142604,"A Hong Kong version of a summer blockbuster, this one is an enjoyable ride, as long as you don't approach with strict logic in mind. As in most wuxia flicks, the combatants can fly, leap, run, spin, etc., with an unearthly grace, and in defiance of physics, but this one has the added benefit that it is a type of Sherlock Holmes film, with the detective always two or three steps ahead of everyone else. Lots and lots of CGI, most of it well done, but all of it fairly obviously unreal, but as well some surprisingly effective performances, and just enough depth of character to keep us interested. The only mis-step here is the ending, which, like many HK films, allows space for a sequel  though in fact, Andy Lau did not show up for a sequel, the producers instead opting for a ""prequel"" with a different actor  when the logic of the script itself clearly indicates a full-stop ending. I will say no more at the risk of spoiling things.",1398297600,,940,4.459302325581396

Mixed in with some of those crazy over the top martial arts scenes.

The movie itself is a mystery story set in ancient China. Very well acted and directed with top production values from front to back. Image and sound quality are outstanding. The special features are worth watching as well.

1138245,2,7885142604,"Di Renjie Zhi Tongtian Diguo (Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame) (Hark Tsui, 2010)

One of the things that many of my movie-buff friends simply don't get about me is my lack of patience for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a movie I have referred to consistently as Crouching Tiger, Over Hyped for almost fifteen years now. It's just another wire-fu movie, no worse and certainly no better than any hundred of its contemporaries. Given that, and given the impeccable reputation of director Hark Tsui, I did the same thing I do with those horrid little cakes that are ubiquitous at American restaurants of the Chinese buffet variety: I figured I would give Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame a go to see if I had warmed to the overhyped-wire-fu-movie genre at all since 1999. The somewhat predictable answer, just as it is with those sticky, sandy attempts at chocolate cake, is no.

There has only ever been a single Chinese empress, Tse-tian Wu. She became ruler in 690CE (Wikipedia, amusingly, notes that the date was 16 October; take that with as much salt as necessary given how many times the calendar has changed in the ensuing thirteen hundred years and change), and Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame takes place around her coronation. She is played here by 2046's Carina Lau as a schemer, a nasty wench who would stop at nothing to gain the throne, and in fact, as we open, Detective Dee himself (Infernal Affairs' Andy Lau) is interred in a hard-labor camp for having fomented a rebellion against her last attempt to take the throne. (Whether Tse-tian Wu was actually like this is probably anyone's guess, but it struck me as cheap plot-advancement posturingespecially towards the end, which is all I can say about that without getting spoily, but it's really obvious in the final sequence.) To commemorate the blessed event, Wu is having a massive statue of the Buddha built within sight of the Imperial Palace. The opening sequence, which takes the viewer on an aerial tour through the construction, is more majestic than all of the movie's wire-fu scenes combined. In any case, we, the viewers, journey through the statue with an inspector as the movie opensbut when he gets to the top, he seems to spontaneously combust. This happens to a few more folks before the soon-to-be-Empress gives the order to free Detective Dee, who seems to be the only person in China (and let's remember China was a lot smaller before Wu came to power...so that's actually possible) who can figure out what in the world is going on. However, breaking him out of prison may not be as easy as it looks, sine the bad guys already knew that was coming and got there first...

There is a good deal to like about this movie, I have to admit. Some of the camerawork is stunning, especially during that opening sequence, and Andy Lau may be playing a caricature of a stereotype, but he does it extremely well, the way he does everything I've ever seen him do on a screen.

Things cannot go on this way; so she releases one of her largest detractors, Detective Dee (Andy Lau) to track down and ""quench"" the problem.  Can Detective Dee detect the problem before he gets his fingers burnt?  Nobody seems to be who they claim they are.  And as usual it is probably the last person you would suspect.

1138523,5,7885142604,"This is a review of the movie, not this particular product.

I really like this flick.  Andy Lau provides a nice balance of humour and gravitas.  To appreciate the film, it does require suspension of disbelief (and a small amount of wilful ignorance of science).  Many of the aspects of the story are outrageous, but I come away from the film wishing they were true (except for the fire-beetle stuff, which would be really scary).  I also wish there were a sequel with Detective Di cured (you need to see the film to decode that).

There tends to be more humour near the beginning and more action at the end, but there are humour and action throughout, along with some amazing irony.  I hear about cultural differences between westerners and Asians, but I have come to believe there are strong similarities in terms of humour, especially slapstick.

I prefer subtitled Chinese films over dubbed ones so I can hear the vocal inflections of the actors.  Also, I figure I may eventually pick up some Mandarin or Cantonese over a period of time.  I don't know if there is an English dubbed version, nor do I care.

Much of the action is fast and furious.  If you like Chinese period films (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) with a heavy dose of wuxia, this is your film.",1364947200,,1267,4.582222222222223

Judge Dee was a magistrate who became governor; he had four assistants, three of whom were reformed criminals.  They did the legwork while he did the investigating in the higher levels of society.  He could fight, but he chose not to unless it was absolutely necessary.  He had a long beard of which he was intensely proud and three wives whom he loved very much and treated as equally as possible.

1138786,2,7885142604,"This movie has all the ingredients to be great.
A great director, great actors, a great premise.
The finished product was messy.
When I first learned of the movie and in particular,
who was directing it, Tsui Hark,
I was very excited about it and thought that
it would make a great series of movies.
After having watched it, I will likely sell
the DVD so that it doesn't take up shelf space.
There's no way I'd be interested in a series.

A whole bunch of CGI junk and ridiculous plot elements.
The fighting is alright, but not that great,
certainly not when compared to the cornucopia
of great martial arts action in cinema over the years,
There is little if any authentic martial arts,
only fantasy acrobatics and movie magic.

This is not a martial arts movie.
It is a fantasy epic with lots of interesting costumes,
action, sorcery and weird affections.
A fantastical pseudo-philosophical murder mystery
on a grand scale.
Underlying it all is a justification for tyranny
and the acquisition of civil power by any means.

It is really important that a woman be the ruler. Why?
She is a stone cold bad girl with sadistic side-kicks
and a freaky wizard as associates(no spoilers zone.
That's why.
huh???
She was the only female emperor in the history of China.
So?
If you get your jollies from feminist politics,
I guess that's kind of cool.
There's even a hint of lesbianism and transgenderism.

If your idea of a rightly ordered society is one ruled
over by completely disordered people, then this tale
might satisfy you with its ""happy"" ending.

Did I mention the CGI. There is way too much CGI
and it's not that good in my opinion
(caveat: I don't like CGI in general).
If one has been conditioned to video games,
then perhaps that is not a problem.

Tsui Hark will have to rehabilitate his reputation
after this one.
Andy Lau and the rest of the cast have reputations
fully in tact as the acting was very good.

If you must watch it, I'm sure that you
will enjoy it in part, I did,

Andy never fails to deliver. From the moment he comes on screen to the moment the movie ends, you are drawn to him like a moth to a flame. He is charismatic and can do just about any/every thing to make his character believable. What was so great about this movie was that the back up cast was just as good at convincing you that they were their characters too.

Now, I won't lie... several times I got confused during this movie. I think it's because my brain is a little slow in processing what I am seeing and what I am reading from the English Subtitles... but it was NEVER hard to get back into the story. I am sure if I watched this movie again, I'd pick up whatever it is I lost along the way.

With forensic insight and formidable combat skills, Detective Dee must unravel the mystery with the Empress's attendant Jing'er (Li Bingbing) and young, ambitious judicial officer Pei Donglai (Chao Deng).

Though based on a real-life historical figure (who also became the basis of Robert van Gulik's ""Judge Dee mysteries"" series), ""Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame"" is a historical fantasy action adventure, something Hark Tsui (""Once Upon a Time in China"") is once renowned for. With Summo Hung as choreographer, his latest film offers lots of thrilling action sequences, which, using wirework, may not be as intense as Donnie Yen-style combats, but are still entertaining.

Hark Tsui, once one of the most influential directors in the world, was virtually forgotten during the first decade of the new century. I was not really impressed with his overlong and confusing ""Seven Sword"" made back in 2005 though some hailed it as his comeback. Now this is the real comeback of, or a return to form for, Hark Tsui.",1336176000,2,1922,5.056782334384858
1138924,4,7885142604,"Asian superstar Andy Lau is Detective Dee. Dee is IMO the Sherlock Holmes of China. In reality, Dee is a fictional account of one of the most celebrated officials of the Tang Dynasty, Di Renjie. The film combines fantasy (a fight scene with deers!) and mystery. The fight scenes are loaded with wire work. Lau is of course on the top of his game. The biggest highlight for me was the BEAUTIFUL Bingbing Li who looks best with her hair down. You can find her in the upcoming ""Resident Evil: Retribution"". This one kept me guessing and piecing together clues. I do hope a second entry is in development. I can see this turning into a series and going somewhere.",1335744000,,659,4.5
1138925,4,7885142604,"You can keep your Charlie Chan and your Mr. Moto and your Mr. Wong. I'd rather have Detective Dee on the case, a lofty guy what predates all three aforementioned sleuthing gents. Detective Dee - or, as history's won't to call him - Di Renjie - was a real person, a great statesman, who lived his life in the 7th century. And yet somehow, in this modern era, he's more celebrated for solving whodunits. Back in 1949 author Robert Van Gulik introduced Detective Dee to the western world when he translated the 18th century detective novel DEE GOONG AN into English as CELEBRATED CASES OF JUDGE DEE, and Van Gulik would go on to write further novels about him. And that's a fairly roundabout way to finally arrive at DETECTIVE DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME. Now here's a film that's a half-step outside your average martial arts Hong Kong flick.

When you propose a film that features wuxia and Andy Lau and a Chinese Sherlock Holmes, I get all curious. DETECTIVE DEE trots out Di Renjie (or Detective Dee) as the main protagonist, and even though Dee is a real life character, this period narrative climbs to fanciful heights. In the year 690 A.D. a towering, sixty-six yard tall Buddha statue is in its finishing stages of completion, erected to commemorate the coronation of the Dowager Empress Wu. Except no one anticipated the upper chambers of the statue becoming the site of a horrific murder. Maybe it's because he neglected to ingest the required two liters of water a day, but a loyal subject is shockingly consumed in flames from his insides out, and is reduced to a smoldering husk. When a second similarly themed death occurs shortly after, Empress Wu has had enough. She recalls her best investigative official, Detective Dee (Andy Lau), to poke his nose in and solve the murder mystery before her scheduled coronation, never mind that Dee had been languishing in punishment for the past eight years for treason. And since you don't really turn down a summons from the Imperial throne unless you want to try breathing thru the massively bleeding open end of your neck (on account of your head having been disattached from it), well, Di Renjie - who is also an inherently honorable bloke - is now on the case.

I've got nothing but good things to say about Andy Lau and that hasn't changed after viewing this film. Guy's charismatic and he anchors the film, even though his character arc traverses the unimpressive span of A to B. Detective Dee essentially remains the same person start to finish, but Lau makes him extremely personable. Dee is assisted by two officers at odds with one another, and this makes for nice friction. One of them, Shangguan Jing'er (a memorable Lee Bingbing), is a favorite of the Empress and a martial artist who favors the whip as her choice of weapon. The other, Pei Donglai (Chao Deng), is a hostile judicial officer and an albino. With their various agendas, they seem as likely to get in Dee's way as to contribute something useful. But when assassins strike, Dee, Jing'er, and Donglai must work together, and so now cue the bonding process. For Jing'er, it becomes a hard-fought tug of war between her (reluctant) fondness for Dee and her allegiance to the Empress (who pretty much appointed her to spy on Dee).

DETECTIVE DEE is lavishly produced, with sleek cinematography and visually stunning set pieces. The combat scenes - and I wished there were more - were inventively staged, I thought. Oodles of elaborate wire-fu went into this. Dee turns out to be as capable with the fighty fights - love his mace which can isolate the weakness in his opponent's weapon - as he is with tracking down clues. Gratifyingly, the mystery angle is given enough weight that this movie does have this genre-breaking feel to it. I was very curious as to how he would go about his investigative process. I like that he isn't swayed by the local superstitious theory - that the murders were a direct magical fallout of removing some sacret amulets - and that he instead holds out for a more factful, more rational solution. Even the talking deer is eventually explained away. And yet the modus operandi he unearths still ends up straying into the realm of really out there. Of course, there's even more stretching of the term ""really out there"" when one has to also factor in a supernatural Imperial Chaplain, fire turtles, an underground Phantom Bazaar, and demented (yet amazingly cool) acupuncture which allows one to reshape one's features. All these farfetched elements may render even someone like Sherlock Holmes all wiggy and floundering. But not Dee. This rather warped version of the Tang Dynasty happens to be his bailiwick. Detective Dee is unfazed. He can't be fooled for long. Assassins. Red herrings. Weird acupuncture. It's all part of the sleuthing process.

Lastly, note that no CG deer were harmed in the making of this film. There was a concerned look on your face.",1330300800,4,4927,4.765807962529274

I would warn fans of Robert Van Gulik's Judge Dee that this movie is more Robert Downey Jr. than Basil Rathbone.  Dee is a man of integrity, whose devotion to the Empire is beyond reproach, but boy, can he kick ass!

A mysterious, supernatural murder prompts the tyrannical empress-to-be Wu Ze-tian to pull Dee from prison so the crime can be solved before her coronation.  But there are many cross-currents in the situation, and none of those involved mind adding to the body count. Bribes, threats, and swords pursue Dee as he untangles the triple schemes, and in the end, Dee puts loyalty to the Empire above everything.

The costumes and the sets in this fantasy of imperial China are gorgeous.  The Phantom Bazaar alone practically deserves its own movie.  The plot has some holes, in the interest of ratcheting up the action factor, but flows well with some twists.  The fight sequences are dramatic without being ludicrous; the wire fu is used sparingly.

There was a historical magistrate during the T'ang dynasty named Ti Jen-chieh, whose wisdom and detecting skills made him a folk hero.

1139049,5,7885142604,"This review is intended for the standard DVD version of Detective Dee and The Mystery of the Phantom Flame.
1. Firstly, I wanted to remark that the associations I've seen for this film to be likened to a mashup of the (2009)Sherlock Holmes and (2003) Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon to be surprisingly apt.  I'm not necessarily pleased about the reality of that, but I do think it's accurate.
2. I am a huge fan of the Judge Dee adaptations and original works written by Robert Hans van Gulik.  As noted elsewhere, this movie is a sizeable departure from what makes those stories great.  That having been said...
3. This film is great.  I love adaptations that do rediculous things (historically or otherwise), and this one has it all.  Andy Lau is a terrific, energetic and careful interpretation of Dee, IMHO.  I am very thankful that there is a plot, and a storyline that isn't rendered impotent with qualifiers, inadequate explanations, etc.  Most of the non-scenic CGI is distracting and unhelpful, but I would say the same about every film I've seen this year.  It was fun for me to see how the traditional folklore elements were woven in.  Several supporting players are fantastic, including Carina Lau.
4. This film is very different from the plodding and thoughtful (1974) Judge Dee and the Monastery Murders (ABC Circle Films), but that film is amazing also (with Jeremy Kagan directing and an amazing cast).  This other film is more in line with the van Gulik works... but lacks the vitality (largely because of the nature of the story) that is part of the Dee persona.
I think this is a fantastic ""go-to-the-movies"" popcorn film.",1329523200,2,1639,4.800711743772242

1139051,4,7885142604,"Ebert reviewed this film and warmly recommended it. The idea of a mystery taking place in ancient China appealed to me. The most striking part of the film is the sets. A large portion takes place within a gigantic statue of the Buddha. The scenes are breathtaking. It gives the film an epic feel. The plot is fun, but nigh incomprehensible in spots. The characters are interesting and the motivations are understandable. The deaths are gruesome, but fascinating. The movie is fun with some pathos in it. The fight scenes are good, but not great. The acting is very good. In some of the scenes, the CGI is noticeable. However, it matters little because the movie is exciting and the mystery does draw me in. I would like to watch it again. I usually like subtitles, but in this case the action takes place so quickly, reading the subtitles is a little distracting.

In summary, the movie is great fun and exotic.",1328486400,,911,4.6234567901234565
1139052,5,7885142604,"I almost didn't pick this movie up because the title had that formula Disney sound to it (family with dog, lost on Island while looking for treasure, etc. redux). Far from it. Amazing elaborate costuming (over 5000 created); props (meticulous detail and mostly period accurate); very solid and realistic sets (and mostly historically accurate); CGI - all incredibly well done. The CGI of the Buddha and the deer-beings was amazing. And, the impressive set construction along with the  CGI of an underground village with waterways must have taken months to construct. The movie passed my good indicators litmus test criteria of a well constructed movie, i.e. attention to detail, authenticity and creative storytelling (meaning: fresh and new or never been told in this way). You'll see bits of Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, historical Chinese history, Red Cliff, Sherlock Holmes, Emperor and Assassin, Crouching Tiger. Belongs in the discussion of classic Chinese film epics in part just from the sheer number of years to fine tune the story and script (10 years). Acting was spot on and that includes the 6000 or so extras. Epic in so many ways: I was impressed with the quality palace construction and it's appointments and furnishings. The first female emperor, around whom the story is told, was a continually evolving work of art just by herself. Finally, the martial arts and wire routines were almost as good as it gets; close to ""IP Man"" status in my view.",1328313600,2,1462,5.016460905349795
1139053,5,7885142604,"This martial arts film is based on historical events during the Tang Dynasty, when the Emperor's widow was poised to become Empress of China in spite of opposition from numerous officials and lords who preferred patriarchal arrangements. In the seven years of her regency, Wu has had to deal with rebellions, plagues, droughts and famines, but China has flourished under her supervision, and women are certainly getting more promotions than they used to.
Wu has commissioned a magnificent stature of Buddha - looking distinctly feminine - to be built facing the palace; it is supposed to be ready in time for her coronation ceremony. But then not one, but two inspectors burst into flames and die horribly, burning from the inside out. (Great special effects here).
A sacred oracle, a stag with markings on his forehead like the guardian stag in Studio Ghibli's film Princess Mononoke, appears at the palace and announces that only Detective Dee can solve the mystery and save the empire from chaos. So Detective Dee, who has been out of favor ever since he opposed Wu's regency, is sent for. Wu sends none other than her court favorite, Jing'r, a formidable, whip-wielding warrior in her own right, to attend and assist Dee's investigation.
But first Dee must survive an assassination attempt that strikes even before Jing'r arrives to order his release from prison.
From then on, officials and princes are either trying to suborn Dee to their rebellions or kill him outright. Dee is suspicious of almost everyone, including the albino warrior-detective who was initially sent to investigate, and who clearly resents being trumped. Gradually Dee uncovers clues and inconsistencies, and traces the source of the spontaneous combustion to fire beetles which feed on phosphorus. But who is deploying them, how, and why?
The martial arts is in the magical style, with great leaps, intricate balancing acts, hand strikes that send pillars of wood shooting through air and water, and blocks that deflect those pillars as easily as if they were mere dowels. If you liked the archers' attack in Hero, you are in for a similar treat here. The onslaughts of black arrows are not quite as sustained as in that famous scene, but some of these bows fire triple shots, and these arrows are poisoned with more of that stuff which turns you into a toasted marshmallow.
The graphics throughout the film made me wish I were seeing this in a theatre, the better to appreciate scenes of the towering Buddha and the work of its construction, several striking views of the great port filled with shipping, and later on, a sunken city that has become a phantom market. This film probably had a huge release in China. Here we have to find it on DVD, but it is still first-rate entertainment.

It's too bad so many good men waste so much energy opposing a woman who was a better ruler than many of her predecessors  - and followers.",1328227200,4,2908,4.872727272727273
1139054,5,7885142604,"If you like kung fu movies and good murder mysteries then you will love this movie, unless subtitles totaly turn you off.  The movie is fast paced and has lots of twists and turns in the story.  At some point in the movie you will suspect each of the main characters (except for Dee of course), but the conclusion is quite a surprise, unless you are really, really observant in the beginning of the movie.  Detective Dee had been imprisoned for opposing the empress' regency eight years ago after her husband the emperor died.  The empress now is about to become 'emperor' the first woman in China or most anywhere else to do so.  When people begin to spontaneously combust, she realizes that only Dee's Holmesian deductive powers can solve the mystery.  However, not fully trusting him she sends her favorite and most loyal lady in waiting to keep tabs on him.  He also has the help of another court officer, who does not like Dee very much at first.  There is plenty of Crouching Tiger style martial arts action with imposible feats.  Without giving too much away the kung fu battle with the stags (male deer) is both novel and way cool.  I hope you give this movie a watch and don't let the subtitles, which are very well done, put you off.

1139147,3,7885142604,"Mac McEntire, DVD Verdict --This movie has huge action and stunning cinematography, but there's one big problem. I can't figure out why Detective Dee the character is in Detective Dee the movie. The flick begins by introducing us to Pei, a cool detective who does awesome martial arts. Then we meet Dee, also a cool detective who does awesome martial arts. Redundancy aside, I'm not clear on what, exactly, Dee wants. What's his ""motivation"" as uppity actors in comedy sketches like to say? Is Dee hoping to gain his freedom by solving the case? Does he wish to prove his loyalty to the empress and rid himself of the ""treason"" label? If this is what he wants, that could be made clearer. Instead, Dee just kind of hangs around, as the other characters take him from place to place and basically do everything for him. The filmmakers try to establish some sexual tension between Dee and Jing'er, but because we don't know enough about Dee, this falls flat. Likewise, attempts at a rivalry between Dee and Pei, as well as a plot twist with someone from Dee's past, also fall flat because we don't know enough about Dee. He does get his big hero moment in the film's finale, but by then it's too late.

In every screenwriting class anyone will ever take, the question ""What are the stakes?"" will be batted around endlessly. In this movie, the stakes have to do with the empress's reign in danger. But, a good script must have personal stakes as well. Therefore, what are the personal stakes for Dee? We never know. If saving the empress is his sole motivation, we never get a feel for that. Casual movie fans might argue that as long as Dee is stoic and has cool kung fu moves, then that's all the movie needs. I disagree. The stoic, cool Terminator in Terminator 2: Judgment Day had personal stakes (protect John Connor). The stoic, cool man with no name in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly had personal stakes (the gold). We have no idea what the stoic, cool Detective Dee wants. I get that he's based on a real historical figure and has been in a bunch of old-timey pulp adventures, but as far as this movie is concerned, he's a non-character, and that drags the whole thing down.

This criticism is too bad, because there's a lot to like in Mystery of the Phantom Flame. Most obvious is the production design and cinematography, both of which will take your breath away. The sets are gigantic, mammoth in both size and detail. The interior of the giant Buddha is the most elaborate set, allowing a lot of space for the characters to leap around. My favorite, though, is the underground cavern where our heroes duke it out with a red-cloaked baddie. It's a dark, gloomy set, with rock crags looming over a subterranean lake and it looks incredibly cool. Cinematography junkies will love this one.

Movie fans are divided on the whole wire fu thing. Some think it provides awesome fight scenes, while others scoff that it's too unrealistic. I say it depends on the context of the movie in question. In Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon it works, because only characters who had a specific kind of training could fly around and ordinary folks couldn't. In something like Daredevil, characters who do not have gravity-defying powers defy gravity, and it's ridiculous. As for Detective Dee, there's a moment early on in which Pei soars majestically across a room rather than just walking. Is this excessive and silly? Yes, but it's important, because it shows that the movie takes place in a world in which everybody can just do that. If you can get around the wire fu, the fight choreography is solid, with a ton of cool moves. It's filmed nicely, too, without too many confusing quick cuts.

The Blu-ray looks brilliant in 2.35:1/1080p. The colors are bright and vivid, and the detail really stands out throughout. The DTS-HD audio, in both the original 5.1 Mandarin and a 2.0 English dub, is good as well, especially during the mass destruction in the film's finale. For extras, we've got featurettes on weapons, stunts, characters, and the overall ""world"" of the film. This is rounded out with poster and still galleries and the theatrical trailer.

This story takes place in classical China, just as Wu Zetian is about to seize the imperial throne. (She actually existed, and became the only woman in China's history to take supreme command, but that might be the only actual historical fact used in this sstory.) The imperial palace swirls with conflicting loyalties and intrigues, with people badly treated by the current regime, but forced to labor within it.

With an ego as big as China itself, Wu commissions a towering statue of Buddha, to be completed on the day of her coronation. But, during the weeks before its completion, a few of her key officers are assassinated in a bizarre manner - they simply burst into flames where they stand. This mystery baffles and terrifies the empress's staff, so they call on a man with nothing to lose in order to solve the mystery: Detective Dee, already languishing in the imperial prison.

The story holds a fast pace from that point on, cutting between the statue's construction, solving the supernatural murders, revealing secret dentities, and displaying ""flying swordsmen"" combat at its finest. Not massively memorable, this still offers some fine, popcorn-worthy entertainment. Don't miss the mass destruction at the end! And never, ever mess with an engineer.

1139304,4,7885142604,"You can keep your Charlie Chan and your Mr. Moto and your Mr. Wong. I'd rather have Detective Dee on the case, a lofty guy what predates all three aforementioned sleuthing gents. Detective Dee - or, as history's won't to call him - Di Renjie - was a real person, a great statesman, who lived his life in the 7th century. And yet somehow, in this modern era, he's more celebrated for solving whodunits. Back in 1949 author Robert Van Gulik introduced Detective Dee to the western world when he translated the 18th century detective novel DEE GOONG AN into English as CELEBRATED CASES OF JUDGE DEE, and Van Gulik would go on to write further novels about him. And that's a fairly roundabout way to finally arrive at DETECTIVE DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME. Now here's a film that's a half-step outside your average martial arts Hong Kong flick.

When you propose a film that features wuxia and Andy Lau and a Chinese Sherlock Holmes, I get all curious. DETECTIVE DEE trots out Di Renjie (or Detective Dee) as the main protagonist, and even though Dee is a real life character, this period narrative climbs to fanciful heights. In the year 690 A.D. a towering, sixty-six yard tall Buddha statue is in its finishing stages of completion, erected to commemorate the coronation of the Dowager Empress Wu. Except no one anticipated the upper chambers of the statue becoming the site of a horrific murder. Maybe it's because he neglected to ingest the required two liters of water a day, but a loyal subject is shockingly consumed in flames from his insides out, and is reduced to a smoldering husk. When a second similarly themed death occurs shortly after, Empress Wu has had enough. She recalls her best investigative official, Detective Dee (Andy Lau), to poke his nose in and solve the murder mystery before her scheduled coronation, never mind that Dee had been languishing in punishment for the past eight years for treason. And since you don't really turn down a summons from the Imperial throne unless you want to try breathing thru the massively bleeding open end of your neck (on account of your head having been disattached from it), well, Di Renjie - who is also an inherently honorable bloke - is now on the case.

I've got nothing but good things to say about Andy Lau and that hasn't changed after viewing this film. Guy's charismatic and he anchors the film, even though his character arc traverses the unimpressive span of A to B. Detective Dee essentially remains the same person start to finish, but Lau makes him extremely personable. Dee is assisted by two officers at odds with one another, and this makes for nice friction. One of them, Shangguan Jing'er (a memorable Lee Bingbing), is a favorite of the Empress and a martial artist who favors the whip as her choice of weapon. The other, Pei Donglai (Chao Deng), is a hostile judicial officer and an albino. With their various agendas, they seem as likely to get in Dee's way as to contribute something useful. But when assassins strike, Dee, Jing'er, and Donglai must work together, and so now cue the bonding process. For Jing'er, it becomes a hard-fought tug of war between her (reluctant) fondness for Dee and her allegiance to the Empress (who pretty much appointed her to spy on Dee).

DETECTIVE DEE is lavishly produced, with sleek cinematography and visually stunning set pieces. The combat scenes - and I wished there were more - were inventively staged, I thought. Oodles of elaborate wire-fu went into this. Dee turns out to be as capable with the fighty fights - love his mace which can isolate the weakness in his opponent's weapon - as he is with tracking down clues. Gratifyingly, the mystery angle is given enough weight that this movie does have this genre-breaking feel to it. I was very curious as to how he would go about his investigative process. I like that he isn't swayed by the local superstitious theory - that the murders were a direct magical fallout of removing some sacret amulets - and that he instead holds out for a more factful, more rational solution. Even the talking deer is eventually explained away. And yet the modus operandi he unearths still ends up straying into the realm of really out there. Of course, there's even more stretching of the term ""really out there"" when one has to also factor in a supernatural Imperial Chaplain, fire turtles, an underground Phantom Bazaar, and demented (yet amazingly cool) acupuncture which allows one to reshape one's features. All these farfetched elements may render even someone like Sherlock Holmes all wiggy and floundering. But not Dee. This rather warped version of the Tang Dynasty happens to be his bailiwick. Detective Dee is unfazed. He can't be fooled for long. Assassins. Red herrings. Weird acupuncture. It's all part of the sleuthing process.

Lastly, note that no CG deer were harmed in the making of this film. There was a concerned look on your face.",1309478400,4,4927,4.765807962529274
1139305,5,7885142604,"Tsui Hark, founder of Film Workshop and producer and director of some of Hong Kong's best cinema once again delivers outstanding Asian entertainement. This review is about the so-called Director's Cut DVD, ASIN 7885142604. This award nominated Detective Dee story is a 7th century Chinese period combination of wuxia, mystery, drama and thriller.

The Detective Dee character is based on Di Renjie, a famous 7th century official of Empress Wu Zeitan's Zhou Dynasty court. This story is based on one of a series of Judge Dee novels. The semi-fictional accounts of Judge Dee are China's equivalent to Britain's Sherlock Holmes. In this Dee story, he is tasked by the soon to be coronated Empress Wu Zeitan to discover why court officials are spontaneously bursting into flame from the inside out and the threat to her imminent coronation as Emperess. In the course of his investigation, Dee uncovers a complex of conspriacies, intrigue, and historical grudges. Even Dee doesn't escape suspicion since he was banished for over 8 years for his opposition to Empress Wu's ascension.

Excellent plot, scripting, direction and acting with outstanding production weaves an entertaining film that deserves the awards for which it was nominated. The cast includes some of the best Asian actors with Andy Lau in the title role and supporting cast including Carina Lau, Li Bingbing, Deng Chao and Tony Leung Ka-fai. You can't have a good Chinese wuxia drama thriller without some martial arts action woven in. The venerable Sammo Hung, famous martial arts expert, actor, producer and action director provides outstanding martial arts choreography.

Tsui Hark can add this film to his long pedigree as director and/or producer of some of the best of Asian cinema. Harks pedigree includes directing Time And Tide and Seven Swords; directing and producing Once Upon A Time In China I through V and A Better Tomorrow III; and producing the John Woo greats A Better Tomorrow, A Better Tomorrow II and The Killer.",1307577600,,1995,5.113496932515337
1139306,5,7885142604,"Sure it's a mystery - in its own way it owes a lot to Western mysteries. But it's ALL Tsui Hark, so that means that the fantastic elements predominate. Courtiers burst into flame inside a 66-story Buddha statue; there is a hidden city beneath the capital called ""The Phantom Bazaar""; our heroes fight killer puppets and shapeshifters; a mysterious priest manifests as a talking stag - and later Detective Dee does battle with a horde of kamikaze stags... Besides Detective Dee (Andy Lau), a loyal former official who has been imprisoned for his honesty, there is the beautiful young female captain of the Empress' Imperial Guard (Bingbing Li), the treacherous and vicious Dowager Empress whose life Dee is called upon to save (Carina Lau in an absolutely standout role), the loyal but headstrong albino captain of the capital police... Oh, and a lot of guys fight with swords. It's all classic and classy. Not a false step. It's escapist fluff of the highest caliber.

There's wirework but of an exceptional quality, there are cool characters that are very well played and it really is a mystery film that probably moves along a little too quickly and sumptuously for you to solve the mystery but all the clues are there.

7900429,4,7885142604,"England has Sherlock Holmes. America has Philip Marlowe. And China has Di Renjie (or ""Detective Dee"") -- the fictionalized crime-solving version of a 7th-century imperial chancellor.

And just as Guy Ritchie did for Sherlock Holmes, Tsui Hark does for Detective Dee. ""Detective Dee & The Mystery of the Phantom Flame"" is a smooth yet frenetic blend of wuxia fantasy/action and political thrillers. While it really helps (a lot) to have some knowledge of Chinese history during and before the reign of Wu Zetian, the story is a pretty entertaining, bittersweet ride on its own -- expect everything from graphic spontaneous combustion to court intrigue.

Only days remain before the coronation of the Empress (Carina Lau), which is being commemorated by a two-hundred-foot-tall Buddha statue overlooking the palace. But when two officials spontaneously combust -- from the inside -- the investigator Pei Donglai (Deng Chao) can't figure out who might have done it, and how. So the Empress sends her faithful servant Shangguan Jing'er (Li Bingbing) to free Di Renjie (Andy Lau), a brilliant detective who was involved in a rebellion against the Empress some years ago.

Di quickly rubs both Jing'er and Donglai the wrong way with his quirky style of investigating, but the constant assassination attempts show that he's on the right track. And as Dee unravels the cause of these fiery deaths, he also becomes entangled in a rebellion against the Empress, and a conspiracy involving the Empress' mysterious chaplain. But can Di uncover the murderer -- and the source of these deaths -- before he becomes the next victim?

""Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame"" has a lot of things that Western audiences won't expect to see in a murder mystery or political thriller -- supernatural overtones, made-up solutions to the mystery, and a lot of wuxia wirework. What's more, it's a mystery whose setting will probably be familiar to Chinese audiences, but Western ones should probably do a little research on Di Renjie and the reign of Wu Zetian (the only reigning empress in Chinese history). Not that Tsui Hark slavishly follows history -- he's pretty loose about it.

And despite its dense backstory, ""Detective Dee & The Mystery of the Phantom Flame"" flows along at a pretty brisk pace, elegantly intertwining different subplots without really losing the momentum. Hark especially seems to enjoy the lush visuals (the Empress's hair alone is fascinating to watch), from a petal-strewn prison to the haunted, supernatural sub-city of the Phantom Market, a vast epic cavern where multi-armed musicians and creepy hooded figures wander. And fight scenes, naturally, often with wildly colorful backdrops and lots of stuff to smash. Think steampunk chainsaw puppets.

Hark also weaves in some dark humor in places (Dee thwarts eavesdroppers by having a morgue attendant READ EVERYTHING VERY LOUDLY). But there's a strong bittersweetness to the story, with many hints that though Dee is now technically free, he is constantly chained by suspicion, by political manipulations, and by his own past. And as the very graphic deaths pile up, that bittersweetness starts edging into out-and-out tragedy.

The one big flaw? It's that sometimes it feels like the movie is sweeping ahead of the characters, and they aren't quite able to develop sufficiently. For instance, there's some friction between Jing'er and Pei, as well as a sneaky suggestion that they work together... but this never really goes anywhere.

But Lau gives a thoroughly solid performance as Dee here -- he does a great job as a quirky, slightly eccentric detective whose bluntness often irritates the people around him, but his keen intellect and some action chops forces those around him to respect him. He also has pretty good chemistry with Li and Deng, one of whom is a fiery young martial-artist/handmaiden/secret agent, and the other who is a fierce, incorruptible albino officer. And Carina Lau does an excellent job as the Empress, casting her as a woman who is ruthless and cruel, but who in a sense has chosen to be that way because otherwise no woman can attain power.

While it requires some research into Chinese history, ""Detective Dee & The Mystery of the Phantom Flame"" is a fast-paced, darkly intriguing whodunnit that never slows down -- although occasionally it could use it.",1492300800,,4360,5.120956399437412
