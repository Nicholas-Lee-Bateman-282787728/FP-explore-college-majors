3664115,5,B001KEGR9I,"Excellent video on food of all kinds from around the country.
I enjoyed the series very much when it was on TV, now I can
watch it anytime.",1344816000,,139,4.0
3664116,4,B001KEGR9I,"This set of two DVDs contains colorful, attractive and mouth-watering video but it has no recipes. Watching it makes me hungry and want to eat all the food being shown. The only disappointment is there is no recipes. So, I can't make some of these dishes at home. It's helpful for people who are going to travel and want to taste the specialty food available in those destinations.

- The first DVD comprises of the following episodes: Pizza paradise, Hamburger paradise, Hotdog paradize, Steak paradise, and Deep-Fried paradise.",1332720000,,529,5.011363636363637
3664117,5,B001KEGR9I,great DVD of some great shows.  I am glad to see this on DVD.  this way I don't tie up storage on my HD  it plays well and seems to be a good recording.,1285718400,,152,3.411764705882353
3664118,5,B001KEGR9I,"This 2-DVD set contains 10 seperate segments (over)focusing on a particular food item or location. The first DVD contains segments on Steak, Fried Foods, Burgers, Pizzas, and Hot Dogs. The second disc features segments on Diners, Ice Cream, BBQ, Donuts, and Buffets. Each segment is about 45 minutes.

The segments tend to be light and whimsical. Everyone here is a foodie and the ultimate gluton. Places visited vary from mundane to completely outrageous. For example, in the ice cream segment, there is an ice cream parlor in NY called Serendipity 3 that sells a $1000 sundae! You must reserve ahead 48 hours to enjoy this gold laden sundae(called the GOLDEN OPULANCE SUNDAE).

There's a diner in Baltimore called the Paper Moon that features old cartoon toys as decoration, kinda like walking thru Toontown while have a pork chop. There's a beef restaurant in Denver called the Buckhorn Exchange that sells Beef Testicles. You can get deep fried chocolate at Chip Shop in Brooklyn.

Try BBQ Spaghetti at Interstate BBQ in Lockhart, TX. How about a Brazilian meat carving buffet in Glendale, Ca. Also, some bacon donuts in Portland at the Vodoo Donut. I tend to enjoy watching these light-hearted shows about food(porn) with people over-indulging. Fun and entertaining.",1278115200,3,1271,5.100961538461538
3664119,4,B001KEGR9I,"We spent a bitter cold News Years Eve & day watching these.  It was extremely interesting and most entertaining, although it often made us hungry!  The only negative thing I noticed was that it was a bit polarized.  Most of what was reviewed was on the East or West coast or the Gulf states. They visited Chicago for pizza, which was a must, and Tennessee & the Carolina's for Barbecue.
If you are interested in the diversity of the US and it's different cuisines, you will love this video.  No gross food here.  All in all it was a great buy, especially for a foodie.",1264982400,,568,4.371428571428571
3664120,5,B001KEGR9I,"Great show, each episode dives into a different theme (burgers, Hot dogs, Ice cream,...), it goes back to where it was created, explains the names and how did it happen.

It shows you the best of, the most expensive, the weirdest in every episode. It's good value for money, over 400+ minutes of material.",1257033600,5,305,4.648148148148148
3664121,5,B001KEGR9I,"Bought this as a birthday present for my brother and he was stoked to receive it.  All episodes are included, inside the cover is a brief description of each episode and is a delight to watch.",1239580800,8,192,4.333333333333333
3664161,5,B001KEGR9I,"As a Pediatric RN, we know that nutritious,healthy food habits start as soon as your child graduates to table foods. Parents can set up their children to be healthy eaters with a variety of foods. This video is a great tool for preschool to Kindergarten aged children, and even my reluctant 7 yr. old grandson who is currently diagnosed with autism, really liked and learned the principles in this video. (He's just too ""old"" for sing-alongs, *rolls his eyes, lol). I though the ""real food"" vs. ""sometimes food"" was a brilliant approach to nutrition, as the terms ""bad food"" and ""good food"" were never used. My grandson particularly liked the part about the white blood cell Soldiers ""looking like Pac-man"" gobbling up germs. Typical boy. He also understood that a lot of sugar makes your immune system weak, ""oh, that's why I can't have a lot of sugar, so I can be well"". (Yes, and we don't want you swinging from the ceiling fans either). I replied, ""EXACTLY!"" This is a great quality video, that is well produced and paced to keep a child's (and Grandma's) interest. I would slip little questions in here and there to see what my grandson learned, and he learned a lot, although he wouldn't admit it outright. A great investment for your child's nutrition and health! 5 stars!",1469318400,2,1279,4.714285714285714
3664162,5,B001KEGR9I,"Such an important message conveyed in a fun way for kids. Grown-ups will even learn a few things in this video. The music is so cute and catchy, you'll find the yourself and the kids singing right along. Great video.......",1468886400,2,222,4.575
3664163,5,B001KEGR9I,"This is a great kid friendly video for teachers, parents, or anyone who wants to reinforce how healthy food choices play a part in how kids feel, grow, and think.
Its very informative and relatable to kids. I like the explanation and visuals of what different types of food do to your body and the various ideas of how to eat them (cucumbers with sea salt is so simple!). I also thought that the real food vs. sometimes food mini quiz was a fun way to demonstrate to kids that you can have some sugar in your diet, but there are other, healthier options.",1468800000,2,554,4.336538461538462
3664164,5,B001KEGR9I,Super cute dvd!  I loved the concept of kids teaching kids....and it held the attention of my kids (ages 6 and 10) until the end!  Excellent information every kid should be introduced to...and now my kids feel so good and positive about themselves when they choose to eat a real food!,1468713600,2,284,4.549019607843137
3664165,4,B001KEGR9I,"This is a fun video that teaches young children about making healthy food choices. The ""moderator "" is a pre-teen girl with a likeable personality. She is happy and encouraging while teaching about healthy eating. I liked the quizzes that not only identified fruits and vegetables, but also the way that ""sometimes"" foods are explained to the audience. This is kid friendly and very timely as we all work to encourage our children to make good food choices. I'm an early childhood educator and I would use this in my classroom.",1468627200,2,527,4.802197802197802
3664166,5,B001KEGR9I,Highly recommended! I love the kiddos in the video and how they make learning about healthy foods exciting and fun for other children!! Wish I could rate higher than 5,1468627200,3,167,4.6
3664167,5,B001KEGR9I,"Educational and fun, this is a MUST HAVE for all preschool and elementary health programs!!  The kids are adorable, and the information so valuable.  This is the Schoolhouse Rock for learning about healthy choices and why those healthy choices are so important to our bodies. VERY well done, and frankly, about time.",1468627200,2,316,5.0576923076923075
3664168,5,B001KEGR9I,"Absolutely wonderful!  Teaching kids to eat real food is extremely important. And kids always like to do what other kids are doing, so I loved how she used other kids as models to show that real food is really good. I am a daycare provider and sometimes it's hard to get the kids to eat their fruits and vegetables. This would be a great tool to use for encouraging good eating.",1468454400,2,378,4.323943661971831
3664169,5,B001KEGR9I,"My 5 yo and I watched this for the first time while she was eating an apple. She was so excited to know that the apple she was eating was a real food, and would help power her body. The challenges helped to keep her engaged and she loved the sing-a-long. When the video was over she said ""Mommmy I want to be a real food kid"". I'm very lucky that some of her favorite foods are healthy, but this video will help to reinforce her healthy choices and keep her on the right track.",1468454400,3,477,4.031578947368421
3664170,5,B001KEGR9I,"This is great!!  A must for all children and adults!!  Mom and Dad will enjoy this DVD Real Food Kids just as much as the children!!  Seriously, this dvd is well done and very informative.  I'm a grandmother and I plan on making sure my granddaughter sees this!  I think she'll enjoy and learn from it.  Sometimes, as children, it's just easier to grab a candy bar or cookie and go!  Better grab that apple instead!  It really brings a new meaning to the word, snack.  Good job writers and producers and everyone involved in making this great dvd!!!",1468454400,2,549,4.4646464646464645
3664181,5,B001KEGR9I,Absolutely brillant video.  My kids (8 & 11) loved it.  They played along picking vegetables or fruits.  And even planned a few meals for the family from what they learned.  We went to the grocery store and each wanted to try a few vegetable !  I have 2 older teens who ate horrible eaters I wish this was around for them.,1468454400,2,322,4.213114754098361

3664183,5,B001KEGR9I,I bought this for my brother because he will watch any thing with food.  This was actually pretty good.  Even I enjoyed it and I don't like to watch food DVD's because I end up with my head in the refrigerator.,1422403200,,210,4.097560975609756

3664185,5,B001KEGR9I,"This two-disc set is fantastic, although you want to eat everything. You will sit on your couch munching the whole way through. Buyer Beware! If you have it through 2 episodes without eating, Congrats my friend. You have the highest of the high self-control!",1390262400,,258,4.886363636363637

Usually I show them to many of my classes, and they absolutely love them!",1389312000,,157,4.096774193548387
3664187,4,B001KEGR9I,"Saw this on KQED a couple weeks ago and ordered it for a colleague who's moving to the Bay Area.  This is a DVD so it's not full HD like the actual broadcast show - but it's a fantastic look at the Bay Area.  I don't think I saw a person up close in the entire movie, just scenery and classical music.  Would be five stars but only four for not being offered on BluRay.",1383696000,,369,3.8933333333333335

8314637,5,B001KEGR9I,"This is such a wonderful video about nutrition for not only kids but adults who can learn new things about the food they should be eating.

Great video!!",1470268800,,336,4.566666666666666
8314638,5,B001KEGR9I,"Excellent DVD with such an important message for our Kids. It is no secret that eating healthy impacts every area of your life in a positive way, and instilling this philosophy in our children at an early age is invaluable. And if your kids are anything like ours, they selectively listen to their parents - haha! But they DO listen to their peers and friends - so having this message come from fun, easy-to-relate to, everyday kids is a great way to get the message across in an entertaining way!",1470009600,,497,4.533333333333333

8314640,5,B001KEGR9I,"This DVD was exactly what my son needed to see. He just turned six and he loved it! He already likes some fruits and vegetables, but I have had trouble getting him to try new ones. We watched it for the first time last night and he enjoyed every minute. He woke up this morning asking if he could have real foods and water for breakfast :) He also wanted to know if he could watch it again this morning. It has definitely made me a proud and happy mom of a little boy that is super excited about being a Real Food Kid!",1469750400,3,518,3.9903846153846154
8314641,5,B001KEGR9I,"Fabulous video!!  Love the concept of kids teaching kids about healthy eating.  This is a wonderful and fun way to teach kids about healthy eating habits.

8314643,5,B001KEGR9I,I felt the video explained why it is important to eat healthy.  The reasoning was easy to understand even for children.  The video also has a cooking segment for healthy snacks.  The music in the video instantly got my 2 year old daughter's attention.  She sat on my lap and we watched the whole video together.,1469491200,,311,4.5
8314644,4,B001KEGR9I,"This DVD is lots of fun and my 5-yr.old kid ate it up (pardon the pun). Fun to watch and there's lots of ""try this at home"" encouragement. We're already trying the plant experiment! Well put together and broken into small, energetic and entertaining segments. It's not only entertaining and educational, but it makes eating good cool (and fun)!",1469491200,,344,4.8474576271186445
