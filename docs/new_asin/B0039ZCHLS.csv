8392681,5,B0039ZCHLS,"These happen to be two quite separate performances with two different accompanists recorded 12 years apart. They are even boxed independently and then placed inside a single all-encompassing carton. Neither the Editorial Review or the single customer review so far posted gives much useful information on which a prospective customer could make an intelligent decision. Whether you like it or not, this is a deficiency I hope to remedy.
First, let us recall that FDs singing career ran from 1947 to 1992, from age 22 to 67, quite doable for a baritone who husbanded his vocal gifts so astutely. Nevertheless, his voice and interpretative style changed considerably over this period, and so did his accompanists. His first Winterreise featured Gerald Moore on the piano, appearing on vinyl in the late 1950s.  Around the same time, Hans Hotter, well into his prime, also recorded the cycle with Moore. I still have copies of both, and they represent two contrasting interpretations of the same music and text: FD the young,  boyish lover, almost in disbelief that his beloved could have treated him so cruelly, singing with a trace of optimism that this will all turn out to be an unfortunate mistake. Hotter, embittered by experience, has no such elusions and his powerful bass-baritone is filled with anger and self-contempt. FD went on to make several more recordings of the cycle: with Jorg Demus, Daniel Barenboim, Murray Perahia, and this present version in 1979 that I purchased as a CD. As he aged, FDs view of Winterreise grew closer to Hotters. His intonation took on a more bitter timbre and lost the bloom of forgiveness. This transition is reflected in Brendels approach to the piano role, for he plays just like Moore in the Hotter discs, and quite unlike the lighter more optimistic style of Moore in his partnership with the young FD. The problem here is that FD doesnt do rage and remorse as effectively as the bigger-voiced Hotter. His declamatory style sometimes sounds strained, and he does not achieve the booming resonance of his great compatriot. While this 1979 version is fine, it is not something you will fall in love with as I did with the Moore version. I have heard many Winterreise recitals in between, notably by Peter Schreier, Benjamin Luxom, Herman Prey, and Matthias Goerne, none of which outperformed the present FD version, but for me the supreme performance is that of Olav Bar in a marvelous CD album that also includes Die Schone Mullerin and Schwanengesang. Bars voice and his take on the score is midway between the early FD and Hotter performances, showing a much wider range of tonal colours, and emotions swinging between the two extremes of proud infatuation and rank despair.
The performance of Die Schone Mullerin featuring Andras Schiff as the accompanist was recorded in 1991. Here is the paradox: I noted above the lack of youthful bloom in FDs  singing of the 1979 Winterreise, although so characteristic in his early work. The fact that it was not lacking is now perfectly clear; he simply decided not to use it. The singing here is as youthful in tone as it was in the 1950s version, and what is almost as remarkable is that the more dramatic songs such as Danksagung an den Bach (No 5), Mein (No 12) and Der Jager (No 15) come over with more power and assurance than they did in the earlier versions where, at times, they sounded a little strained and ragged. I have never previously heard Schiff as an accompanist, or even as a Schubertian pianist, as my familiarity is based mainly on his Bach keyboard performances, but his playing leaves little to be desired, although he tends to slouch physically over the piano as if he were in a pub. The venue is in fact a TV Studio, devoid of an audience. Again, this is a work I have heard in the hands of many artists, including Peter Schreier, Ian Bostridge, and one of my great favourites ---- Gerard Souzay; but I place this 1991 version along with Olav Bars ravishing interpretation as joint first.
Now for the technical issues. The filming of both cycles is stupendous so far as the singer goes. The camera hardly ever leaves his handsome patrician face, and every movement of mouth, lip, eye or hand, every expression or hint of emotion, is expertly captured, extending to the use of double-takes where two images are projected simultaneously: one full frontal and the other in profile. The pianist does not fare so well, perhaps Brendel better than Schiff. But we do see examples of their fingerwork, and it  is illuminating how differently they conjure up the required notes: Schiff more relaxed and laid back; Brendel more tense and introvert. The sound is fixed stereo with no audio option, but it comes over very clearly. The language option allows you to read the poems as subtitles, an omission that drove me crazy in the case of the companion Arthaus production of the Nuremberg Schumann/Schubert Recitals in which FD is accompanied by Hartmut Holl. Each cycle has its own brochure that acts as a useful introduction and synopsis of the program. We have here a total of 47 songs totaling a  playing time of 212 minutes for $40.  A bargain that is hard to resist.",1414886400,,5176,4.803591470258137
8392682,5,B0039ZCHLS,This pack is not only a GREAT deal it is also an amazing work of art. Fischer-Diskau is THE best lied singer of our time. I feel as though it would be somewhat of a folly if you are a singer and do not own this set!,1277337600,,215,3.595744680851064
8392683,5,B0039ZCHLS,"Art song lovers will delight in these two video recordings of Schubert's famous song cycles, performed by baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau with Andreas Schiff and Alfred Brendel, respectively, as accompanists.  Now retired, Fischer-Dieskau was perhaps the greatest singer of German lieder in the 20th century, and his intimate knowledge of these songs, both words and music, is evident throughout.  It's one thing merely to hear these song cycles; it's quite another to watch Fischer-Dieskau as he performs. His ability to wring an emotional response out of a situation that sometimes verges on the comical, as in Die Schoene Muellerin, is wonderful to see. No less compelling is his unerring sense of the narrative, which moves forward not only in the voice but also in the accompaniment.

Die Schoene Muellerin was performed in Austria in 1991 as part of a Schubertiade celebration. It is the only performance that Fischer-Dieskau and Schiff gave together, and the video for Austrian television records their spontaneous give and take. The Winterreise cycle was performed some years earlier, in 1979, and Fischer-Dieskau is visibly younger. His accompanist then was the great Austrian pianist Alfred Brendel. In this recording one senses the mutual compatibility of two top musicians, whose shared understanding of this music enhances each other's performance.  Winterreise is by far the deeper and more profound of the two cycles, as repeated viewings of this recording will make abundantly clear.

As a bonus, one DVD also contains an interview with Fischer-Dieskau, in German with English subtitles, and the other shows part of a rehearsal in German with Fischer-Dieskau and Brendel.  No transcripts of the songs are included, but both concert recordings have English subtitles.

This set of two DVDs was produced especially for Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's 85th birthday in 2005.
