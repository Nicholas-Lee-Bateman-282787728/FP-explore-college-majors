8654721,4,B00F57VH3W,"The NC A&T Band is definitely worth watching if anyone get the opportunity to see them live.  2012 they made history, came here to New York and led Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.  They are indeed one of the best college marching bands anywhere if not the best!  There should be a ""Drumline"" movie made on this band because they def. have the talent in North Carolina.  Good job musicians and BGMM staff.

What would have made this film even more compelling would be to interview current members and the Greensboro natives.  Overall, exciting and very entertaining to watch ""Cold Steel"" Drumline and the sexy, beautiful ladies of Golden Delight who was voted #1 HBCU female dance squad in 2012.",1379635200,,690,4.805084745762712
