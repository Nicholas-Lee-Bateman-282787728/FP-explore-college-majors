Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing. The jokes are horrible and the timing drags...like watching grass grow. This movie makes ""Spaceballs"" look like an Oscar winner! To add insult to agony, the quality of this DVD is worse than a Betamax bootleg. Fuzzy distorted picture, muddy sound. Probably the worst film quality I've seen since I saw ""Hercules in New York"" on the Late Late movie. Cult? Yes!, Classic? Only if you are really stoned.",1104969600,12,592,4.647619047619048
1064209,5,6305713529,"A spoof of just about every bad sci-fi movie ever made, this one continues to produce laughs nearly 25 years after its release. Dorothy Stratten, as the lovesick android, shows she had a bright future in Hollywood, had it not been for her tragic murder by her ex-husband. Groan everytime the words ""Blue Star"" are uttered with the resulting heavenly chorus, laugh at the Rock Eater and the Batboy, and enjoy. This one is supposed to be silly.",1097798400,3,442,4.67948717948718
1064210,1,6305713529,"There's nothing more awful than a comedy that isn't funny. Apparently the folks who made Galaxina were going for a kind of space-movie parody with sex, but there is exactly ONE funny bit in the movie. The bikers on the distant planet who worship Harley Davidson by bowing down to a motorcycle and going ""Vroom! Vroom!""  That's it.  It lasts about 10 seconds, and pfft, end of funny. Quite honestly, has there EVER been a funny space-movie parody besides ""Galaxy Quest?""  Ever?  Nope.  And this one isn't either.  The jokes are so bad, and so labored, and take so long to arrive, and are delivered so badly, that it's agonizing.
The sex part? THERE ISN'T ANY. Not unless you count the scene in the space bordello, which is neither sexy nor funny.  So the movie fails on both counts; it's not funny, and it's not sexy.  It just sort of flops around from disconnected scene to disconnected scene.  All the guys in the movie are slimy cheeseballs with open shirts and ASCOTS.  And then there's Avery Schreiber.  Avery Schreiber.  Who told this guy he was funny? Can we sue them?  Was he funny? Ever?
And what was this movie shot on? I mean, the whole film is blurry. It's out of focus all the way through.  I've seen MP3's with better image resolution than this movie.
The only thing that might make this dreadful failure worth watching at all, for even five seconds, is Dorothy Stratton.  Poor Dorothy.  She can't act, of course, but she is beautiful, even in the sublimely stupid outfits they put her in here. And she goes through this thing like a trooper, doing exactly what she's supposed to, which is act like a robot.
Trust me, this movie's not even good no matter how many of whatever substances you imbibe. It's too awful to even make fun of. It's just plain awful.  Unless you are absolutely obsessed with Dorothy Stratton or you have some weird need to collect every bad science fiction movie ever made, avoid this like the plague.",1060560000,62,1938,4.571014492753624
1064211,1,6305713529,"I love Dorothy Stratten.  She was the first Playmate I ever saw and she was the most incredible vision I'd ever seen.  I love Science Fiction.  I grew up with it and I've read and seen just about everything ever released.  I love good bad movies.  The first time I saw Deathrace 2000, I couldn't stop laughing.  Toxie is a personal hero of mine.  I live for Friday night to watch good bad movies and munch on popcorn.
I only mention all of the above to preface my review because they're important.  I'm exactly the intended target audience for this movie.
It's bad.  Really bad.  Bad bad.  Using terms like ""witty"" and ""humorous"" are completely out of place with this movie.  I had a friend in grade school who made witty movies.  This isn't even close.
My first impression was incredibly poor.  The A G O N I Z I N G L Y slow pan along the length of the spaceship while music that sounded like it was lifted from a Bugs Bunny cartoon in a more serious moment seemed like it would never end.  And then it went downhill.
There is no sense of sequence to the story.  It's a hodge-podge of scenes that seem to have been written by someone determined to see how bad a movie could be and still be funded and released by a theater.  Well, now we know.
The acting is beyond cardboard, the supposed ""parody"" simply a matter of trying to reference other movies everyone would know without realizing you need to do something clever with it to be funny, and throughout all of this is the maddening Bugs Bunny classical soundtrack.
Don't waste your time... even if you think it would be worth trying to see how bad it is.  That's why I saw it.  I've seen thousands of movies, and this is my first movie review. That should tell you how bad this movie must be.",1050537600,9,1747,4.303680981595092

Galaxina(Dorothy R Stratten) is a female robot which leds in the Eternity Police starship.

They get a mission got to a remote planet to get the Blue Star(ahhh!)  from a alien robot which lives in a west town style full of aliens.
Of course they sent Galaxina to get the treasure.
After she is captured by a band of Harley Davidson believers they rescued her and returns to the ship.
The dialogue is a bit cheesy the humour and jokes are very obvius and the intents of Galaxina of talk are evident.

1064213,5,6305713529,"I don't care what anyone else says, but for the goofy script and tongue-in-cheek comedy I think Bill Sachs is a genious.  The film quality copy process, however, leaves much to be desired, through no fault of Mr. Sachs.  Whoever the slobs were who basically did nothing but show their unprofessional attitude with this DVD release should be defrocked and locked in a cage for future film editors and scientists to study.
I've always been a cult comedy and sci-fi movie buff, and this has some hilarious scenes, including the colony of space bikers who worship their Lord, ""Ha-Ley David San AH-OOM, AH-OOM.""  Rock Eater utters his famous insult at the Captain, and don't forget THE BLUE STAR aaaahhhhhhhhhh! Galaxina is always calm, cool, shockingly electric in more than just design, and of course there are the typical crew of space cowboys with one who wants to be more than a crewmate with Galaxina, just to mix it up with the hero/heroine approach.  I think the director did a wonderful job at corny comedy sci-fi, and I hope in the future a better release film-quality-wise is produced than what is currently on the market.

1064216,5,6305713529,"Prior to this new 25th anniversary release we were given the terribly horrible Rhino release which took not a second of care in realizing the full potential of this film.

Galaxina was the first film, yes the first film that ever used computer graphics for special effects.

It was also one of the only films that ever used infra-red film, producing some rare and interesting images of a wonderfully beautiful Dorothy Stratten roaming a strange and wild planet surface.

It must be understood that this is not a serious film. It is not trying to win an award. Instead this is a film about fun and spoof. The actors all loved fooling around on the set and having fun making this film. This was a low budget film about making fun of Sci Fi films of that time that took themselves a little too seriously. Please judge it from that perspective.

 This new 25th Anniversary release DVD of Galaxina offers the viewer a rare opportunity to see the film as it would be shown in the theater. It is finally in widescreen and the transfer is very crisp. The infra-red scenes are just so colorful and rare.

I encourage everyone to enjoy the craziness of this film.",976752000,7,1153,4.545893719806763

The print used is terrible, and you can even see the telecine  operator adjusting (squeezing) the image to get the crawling text (Star  Wars style) on screen during the opening sequence WHILE THE FILM IS  RUNNING! The ""hilarious Easter Egg"" computer animation is just  plain stupid, and the Andy Kaufman soundtrack over the ""previews""  is simply annoying after the first time. I only purchased this DVD to  finally get the Widescreen version of this movie, and I am terribly  disappointed in the product.

1064349,3,6305713529,"I saw this movie at the drive in shortly after it came out in 1980. It's been 37 years since I last saw it. I was home sick this week and was looking for something science fictiony to watch and this popped up. I thought ""why not?""

Ummm....why not? I wish I could say that this movie was so bad that it was good, but I can't. It is truly an awful movie that I somehow made it through mostly to the end. I started browsing on my phone about the time of the Har Lee David Son worship scene came on. But my Internet browsing was related to the movie as I was researching Dorothy Stratton.

The movie. If I never see another movie with Avery Scheiber in it, I will die happy. I know he died in around 2002 and I have to admit that I did a search for Mr. Scheiber to see what else he was in just so I could make a mental note NEVER to watch it. Yeah. He was that bad. His acting was amateurish at best and it appeared that he was winging it through most of his scenes trying ever so hard to be funny. With me, it completely failed.

The guy that played Cowboy was supposed to be the dumb cute blond guy. He came close to pulling off his part of this mess.

The two guys in maintenance...the first Spock ripoff with the ears and wings and the the proverb spewing oriental guy were actually mostly OK. Especially proverb guy. I kind of liked him. There was another Spock ripoff in the saloon scene. This guy had the uniform and cauliflower ears. Whatever.

The two main characters in Thor and Galaxina could have possibly made the movie had it been a serious movie instead of a ""comedy."" And I think that is where the whole issue came in with me. Thor was pretty much portrayed as an idiot who seemed to have trouble counting past 40 (during the workout rowing scenes...waaaayyyy too long of a scene). But had this been a drama and with him in the role in a serious part, I think he could have helped make this thing a better movie. Because unlike the other actors, I actually wanted to like him.

Now as far as the lovely Dorothy Stratton. She unfortunately got stuck in a serious role in a comedy with a bunch of not very funny guys. I know this was her first major role in a film and she was Playboy's PMOY in 1980 as well as a PMOM in 1979 but I was still surprised that she did not come off as sounding like a complete bimbo once she started talking. It would have been interesting to see where her career would have gone had that goon of a husband had not killed her. I always thought Stratton was one of the most gorgeous playmates to ever grace the pages of PB. Yes, I do remember when she was in it :)

All in all, this could have been a better movie without Avery Scheiber in it and had it been set up as a more serious film.",1515456000,,2728,4.0783582089552235

1064354,2,6305713529,"GALAXINA (1980) is set in the year 3008, when a police patrol has been established to control the heavy traffic in... spaaaace! Spaceship Infinity is such a ship, piloted by Captain Cornelius Butt (Avery Schreiber). It's just another routine patrol, until an unknown craft soars past their speed trap. The captain of the vagrant vessel is the mysterious Ordric. He seems to be up to something, but what? Otherwise, life is pretty dull aboard the Infinity. Only Galaxina (Dorothy Stratten), the ship's robot, livens up the place. Then, a strange egg is eaten by Captain Butt, causing him to emit a lizard-like creature from his mouth! Meanwhile, Sergeant Thor (Stephen Macht) has fallen in love w/ Galaxina, and is willing to risk electrocution, in order to touch her! Suddenly, a mission is given to Butt and company, to go in search of the Blue Star crystal. But first, a visit to the local space brothel. Complete oddness follows. Sort of a cross between the bar scene in STAR WARS, a western, and a very bad night at Studio 54. Later, as the crew are put into cryosleep, the lizard-monster creeps about like the rubber puppet it is. Galaxina is bored -I know the feeling!- flying around alone. She watches TV, which is just as insipid as it was a thousand years earlier! More dullness happens. Lots of dullness. Mega-dullness! Hey! Ordric has returned! Maybe he'll blow the Infinity to smithereens! Nope, just more dullness. My god, this is terrible! At least we get to watch Galaxina walk around an old ghost town set. Another STAR WARS saloon parody occurs. Here, she meets Mr. Spot and has a showdown w/ Ordric. Actually, this is the funniest part of the movie, which isn't saying much! Once this sequence is over, it's back to the abyss of awfulness. Not even the hilarious space bikers can save this slab of interstellar ineptitude! I'm not kidding! This is torture!

1064429,5,6305713529,"Galaxina is a very happy adolescent memory for me, I was around 12 years old when it was released and Dorothy Stratten was a Superstar Hot Babe at that point in time!
She was THE Playboy Centerfold and THE Ultimate Girl Next Door fantasy. We all loved her for it, she was a tremendous source of national pride.
Everyone expected her to rival the great Marilyn Monroe, she certainly seemed to have that potential anyway.
She was impressively mature for her age, surprisingly so.
I think her acting abilities would have improved with experience but she does give a fine performance as an android here.
This is a very fun B Movie that spoofs others like Alien, Dark Star and I'm sure some others as well, I just can't name them all at the moment.
Galaxina has some really good characters and comedy but it suffers from mediocre scripting and uninspired direction unfortunately.
There is a lot of Adult innuendo but it isn't too explicit.
I think my favorite alien is the foul-mouthed rock eating prisoner aboard the starship Galaxina serves, the Infinity.
There is a hilarious relationship between this creature and the ship's captain, portrayed by the old school talented Avery Schreiber. This film is a rare vehicle for him.
I think of this film as a live action version of the old Heavy Metal adult fantasy/sci-fi magazine but without the nudity & sex.
The success of this film, I think, was greatly diminished by the enormous cloud of Stratten's much too untimely death.
It remains one of the most egregious tragedies of the entertainment industry.
She truly was concerned about her estranged husband and tried to help keep him from going over the edge but it was too late.
She must have had sincere compassion and a lovely sense of Moral Responsibility.
I only wish her husband were the same.
Twenty years of life are not enough.

My favorite scene in Galaxina is very special, She and two of her crewmates hop on a motorcycle to escape a situation and there is a beautiful, peaceful shot of them authentically happy to be together and alive, and I am grateful the director gave us that moment to linger.
A fleeting moment of expectation and potential of better things to come.


Dorothy Stratten's death was crushing for everyone for a time and Galaxina has become something of a requiem for Her but I still feel it is worthwhile for its own reasons.
Not a masterpiece but very enjoyable.

1064432,5,6305713529,"This is probably one of the awful, badly-acted, ridiculous scifi movies ever made...and it's hilarious.  Starring Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber, it's probable most claim to fame is the presence of Dorothy Stratton, Playboyof the Year, who was murdered shortly after afterward.  Apparently it was shot on a budget which didn't include a composed soundtrack because all of the music is recognizable classics, including the famous ""Lone Ranger theme"" from the William Tell overture.

These may seem like bad points, but, perversely, all the above are what make Galaxina such a joy to watch. The film not only spoofs Star Wars, Star Trek, and Alien, but also gives a nod to Young Frankenstein (for there is a definite Mel Brooksian tinge in its nature)and John Carpenter's Dark Star and perhaps even a bit of High Noon. With all these point going against it, this is one film that should've fallen by the wayside. Instead, it's an entertaining bit of film fancy that offers laughs, groans at some of the visual as well as spoken puns, and has managed to survive as a cult classic.

I have a feeling with a higher budget and different actors, it would've have fared as well but would've simply become another sci-fi movie soon forgotten.  Its obvious flaws are the things that make it a gem...or are they really flaws? Perhaps its very faults were on purpose, to add to its farcical nature?

I discovered this old VHS tape a long time ago and recently decided to watch it again.  It was as bad as it was the first time around...and I enjoyed it immensely.  Doubtless I'll watch it again...and again.",1476748800,,1598,4.7644927536231885

1064435,3,6305713529,"If it weren't for the fact that this was ill-fated Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratten's star vehicle, Galaxina probably would have been one of the more forgettable Playmate star vehicles, and a forgettable film altogether. However, since this was Dorothy's first and only starring role, and she was who she was, and because of the tragic way her life ended just a couple of months after this film was released, this one is a must for any cult film collector.

Aside from the flat-falling humor of then-popular funny man Avery Schreiber and the role of the ""heroic love interest"" of Galaxina (played by Stephen Macht), that should have been better cast, Dorothy shows some genuine acting skills in this one. It's evident after her character becomes less ""robotic,"" after her ship lands on the planet Altair One, and she's allowed to venture out alone to interact with the locals. Had she lived, she probably would have gone on the have one of the most successful show biz careers of any former Playmate. One that would have predated those of Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy by over a decade.

An interesting footnote here is that January 1977 Playmate Susan Kiger, who had several acting credits to her name at this point but now resides in the ""Whatever Happened to..?"" file, has a small role in this one as ""Blue Girl"" in the brothel scene. I've often wondered, if Dorothy would have turned down this role or would have been killed before the film was made, if it still would have been made with Susan in the title role.",1461369600,,1527,4.6940298507462686

1064525,5,6305713529,"Don't write this film off just because it has flaws.  Galaxina contains thematic elements similar to Metropolis, Forbidden Planet, Pygmalion, Bicentennial Man, Artificial Intelligence, The Little Mermaid, and many other stories.  Many reviews emphasize the clowning male characters and the lowbrow humor, making it sound as if the story isn't about Galaxina.  But this is Galaxina's film.  She is the one who takes ""the hero's journey""; she is the only person with a character arc; she is the only character to successfully fight a villain in the film.

SPOILER ALERT:  This partial description of Gaxalina's scenes is intended 1) for persons who have already seen the movie, to encourage them to watch it a second time emphasizing Galaxina's point of view, 2) for persons who might otherwise not give this movie a chance, and 3) as a rebuttal to those who claim this movie has no plot.  This movie does in fact have a plot, but the plot is hard to find on the first viewing because the film emphasizes the joking male characters.  Read no further if you don't want to know any part of the story!

------------------------------------------------

As the movie opens, gorgeous Galaxina works 24 hours a day running the entire space ship, while the male crew members cuss, smoke, drink, and watch TV.  By day she wears a skin-tight satin bodysuit; by night she serves candlelight meals wearing a skimpy French Maid outfit.  The men ogle her curves but never acknowledge that she is the smartest and hardest working crew member.  She never complains; her makers have programmed her to be mute!

Sargeant Thor can't keep his eyes or hands off Galaxina; he claims to love her and receives shocks from touching and kissing her built-in electric defenses.  ""It was worth it,"" he gasps.  Galaxina can only regard him in sympathetic silence and return to work.

After the men receive orders for a decades-long mission requiring them to enter suspended animation, they spend a precious 24 hours of leave in an outer-space brothel while Galaxina guards the ship.  Monitoring their antics via security cameras, Galaxina sees Thor kissing call-girls.  A teardrop runs silently down Galaxina's cheek.

Galaxina pilots the ship across the galaxy for 27 years with the men sealed in their glass chambers.  Time and again, Galaxina wipes the frost from Thor's window and gazes into his unconscious face.  Longing for him, she resolves to hack her own software to disable her self-defense shock mechanism and give herself speech.  She gradually succeeds, and we see her practicing words she will someday speak to Thor.

Galaxina revives the men as the destination approaches.  They seem unsurprised that Galaxina protected them while they were helpless for 27 years.  Galaxina goes to Thor's quarters wearing a filmy low-cut negligee and declares her love.

The ship comes under attack and crash-lands on the target planet.  All the men, including Thor, claim to be too injured to proceed with the mission; this means Galaxina must go alone through hostile territory to find the supernatural ""Blue Star"" gemstone.  Without her self-defense mechanism, she is very vulnerable.  She bravely marches off with a single handgun.  At an alien saloon, she learns the gem's owner was murdered but it remains in the victim's room upstairs.

Galaxina fights a Darth-Vader-like villain twice, including a gun battle in the street.  She is then kidnapped by a demented religious cult and chained to a giant cylinder to be killed at sunrise.

In the nick of time, Thor and a shipmate arrive to free Galaxina.  They make it back to the ship but the villain reappears, locks everyone in the brig, and hijacks the vessel.  Galaxina and Thor share bittersweet kisses; Galaxina promises if she survives, she will obtain upgrades allowing her to be his lover, wife, and mother of his children...

---------------------------------------------------

From the above, it is obvious that the movie does have a plot, and Galaxina's scenes could have been developed in many interesting ways.  This film fascinates and frustrates because the narrative structure of Galaxina's story is underexploited.  Both humor and poignancy could have grown naturally from the plot situations, but the audience instead receives disconnected gags.

MAKE SURE to view the widescreen version of this film.  The widescreen color print is not pristine but does show what the film looked like on the big screen.  Important action occurs at all corners of the screen, and the earlier pan-and-scan version does not show Galaxina properly.

By the way -- in case you like Dorothy Stratten, she did make one more movie before her death.  It's a romantic comedy called They All Laughed, with John Ritter, Audrey Hepburn, and Ben Gazzara.",1398816000,,4769,5.096774193548387

1064527,2,6305713529,"The success of Star Wars (1977), led to the production of all kinds of space adventure films, and Galaxina (1980) was a part of this wave to cash in.  A comedy/adventure, the film is very silly and campy, borrowing from several science fiction icons, including Star Trek, Star Wars, and Alien.  With a kind of crude nostalgic charm, the film may have some appeal, but is probably most notable for the acting performance of Dorothy Stratten, Playboy Playmate for 1980, who was brutally murdered by her husband shortly after the film's release, at just twenty years of age.

Written and directed by William Sachs, the story is set in the 31st century aboard the Infinity, a police craft commanded by the kooky Cornelius Butts (Avery Schreiber), and piloted by Sergeant Thor (Stephen Macht).  Stratten's role is as Galaxina, a shapely android who sees to the basic needs of the crew.  Ordered to travel to a faraway planet, to find information about the ""Blue Star"", the crew of the Infinity stops off at a brothel on an asteroid, before going into cryosleep, and making the long 27 year journey.

While the crew is asleep, Galaxina successfully reprograms herself to speak and experience emotions.  The crew is awakened when the Infinity arrives at its destination, but ship crash lands on the planet after being ambushed.  With the crew incapacitated, Galaxina sets out to gather information on what is a very bizarre adventure.  The planet has an old West motif, and the light from the sun makes everything look red in the daytime.  Galaxina recovers the Blue Star and has a spacey shootout out with the evil Ordric before being captured by a gang of bikers who worship the almighty Harley David son.  Galaxina's rescue and subsequent escape is the most exciting moment in the film.

The screenplay doesn't manage to put together the smorgasbord of odd disjointed ideas into any kind of decent story.  Hardly anything exciting happens, and even with Stratton dressed in a backless skintight outfit with a cleavage window in the front, the titillation factor is rather limited.  While some of the special effects are decent for their day, there are also some really cheesy looking effects, and people in rubber suits.  The gags are weak, the dialog is often terrible, and some of the acting is quite unpolished.  Stephen Macht does a good job playing it straight, while Avery Schreiber goes way overboard the other way, hamming it up big time.  While nice to look at, unfortunately Dorothy Stratten's performance does not improve much after she begins speaking.  Stratten's tragically brief life was the subject of several movies, including Bob Fosse's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-80/dp/B000GAKBI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star 80</a>&nbsp;(1983), with Mariel Hemmingway as Stratten.

Galaxina is available in a double feature Bluray edition, paired with The Crater Lake Monster.  This version is not subtitled, and has no extras.

The movie starts out with the Infinity Space Cruiser on traffic patrol. They are parked behind an asteroid, one that has a billboard on it. A ship which looks like a Romulan bird of prey passes by. It is piloted by a man who reminds us of Darth Vader. The captain is summoned to the bridge! As 2001 theme music is being played, our captain slowly appears on screen. It is Avery Schreiber (1935-2002) fresh off his gig as the Frito Bandito!

The crew is tasked to recover the Blue Star which is what the Darth Vader alien (Ordric from Mordric) is after. Due to her lack of acting ability, Dorothy Stratten (the subject of movie ""Star 80"") plays an android. While the movie contains ""brief nudity""(Nancy McCauley) it is blurred and not that of Playmate Dorothy Stratten, as we would expect. This is not a sex comedy, although it uses sex as a comedy such as in the alien brothel.

Avery (Capt. Cornelius Butt) envisions himself as a witty sage philosopher. His jokes and sayings are terrible, but his crew (Stephen Macht, J.D. Hinton)
humors him. The ship has an alien prisoner who is a rock eater, but can't gnaw through metal bars. Movie includes Playmate Susan Kiger (blue girl at brothel) and the Lord, Har Lee David Son. Bartine Burkett Zane (1898-1994), whose movie career started in 1917, plays a bit part as Whistler's Mother.

As such, I am unable to comment on the quality of the item on this product page.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.

This remarkably unfunny parody film is probably best known for the participation of Dorothy Stratton, the young model murdered by her estranged husband shortly after the film was released.  Since 'Galaxina' is part of the lore surrounding Ms. Stratton, it seems to have been accepted as legitimate, or at least been given a boost that it does not deserve when considered as a film only.  Fans of Ms. Stratton's may appreciate 'Galaxina' as a star vehicle, but in reality there is nothing in this film to recommend it, other than the attractiveness of its star.  In fact, a short montage of Ms. Stratton's clips would probably rate higher - it would keep the positive aspects of the film and lose the tedious presence of Avery Schreiber and its infantile plot.  (Those who are old enough may remember Mr. Scheiber as the highly irritable Dorito spokesmen in commercials from years ago.  Those short spots were miniature comedic masterpieces compared to this film.)

What plot there is consists of the crew of a space patrol - its captain (Schreiber), Sgt. Thor (Stephen Macht), and the ship's robot (Ms. Stratton), among others - as they are sent on a special mission to recover a crystal which holds unlimited power.  During the years the crew spends in cryo-sleep on their journey, Galaxina reprograms herself for human emotion, and when the crew awakens, instead of an untouchable machine, they find a woman in  her place.

Parody films are a specialty niche - I think they succeed better when they use the common tropes and devices of the genre to poke fun at itself, rather than taking specific elements from specific films, which, in the end, becomes tedious rather than humorous.  But if you like them, then 'Galaxina' may also have value to you, though even when matched up against a film like 'Spaceballs', I think it still shows poorly.  Combining elements of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B000FQJAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B001DHXT3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>, the parody of 'Galaxina' is unfocused, as if simply throwing in recognizable scenes and familiar action alone make a comedy.

1064570,1,6305713529,"I finally bought this film after years of curiosity about it.  I'm a long time sci-fi fan and read some interesting things about this movie back in the day.  I was hoping for a cool sexy late 70's early 80's sci-fi movie.  I dug up an old article that interviewed the director.  He talked about using some special kind of film stock to film certain scenes giving it a unique and futuristic look.  He also talked about the sexuality and nudity that would be present by having the undeniably beautiful Dorothy Stratten.  Well, I took the plunge and bought it-take my advice-don't waste your time.  Their is no nudity, the plot is unitelligible, and the so-called special filming is nothing more that a distorted hue.

There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that I don't get into Sci-Fi. If you're into Sci-Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. On the picture alone I give this movie 1 weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this.

When will these people make dvd's in 1.85 or 1.77?  2.35:1 should only be an extra option on a disk.  NOT the ONLY ratio.  I wonder if it is even actualy un-edited.

1064576,2,6305713529,"Galaxina may well be the dumbest, most boring science fiction film ever made.  I was revving up to launch a full-scale assault of a review before the infinitely long opening credits ended - but now two things are holding me back.  First of all - and heaven only knows why - this thing started to grow on me toward the end.  This is the kind of film you can look back on and laugh about, even though virtually all of the movie's spoofs and jokes fall flat as a fritter while you're watching it.  Second of all - and more importantly - the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten looms large over Galaxina.  This beautiful young woman, who really wasn't all that bad an actress, never lived to see its release - or her twentieth birthday.  Hers is not the only tragic story among Playboy centerfolds (Stafford was Miss August 1979 and 1980s' Playmate of the Year), but it is the most tragic.  She was brutally murdered by her estranged husband, who then cowardly committed suicide.

It's obvious that 1980's Galaxina was designed as a spoof of Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien, 2001, and other contemporary science fiction films (and westerns, as well).  As such, it really doesn't work.  The jokes come hard and fast and often, but only a couple of them brought even the trace of a laugh to my lips.  The first half of the film is also exceedingly boring.  Most of the extremely eclectic crew members of the intergalactic police cruiser Infinity are just annoying - and Galaxina (Dorothy Stratten) herself is just eye candy.  As a robot - an exceedingly human-like robot - she silently controls the ship and spends most of her time just sitting in a chair fiddling with some of the gizmos inside her wrist (and, I must mention, completely clothed - albeit in a form-fitting spacesuit.  I'm actually glad that this film features no nudity; it would have been all too easy to stick the Playmate of the Year into a film and put her naked body on display, but it's always a really tawdry thing to do - and it's not something I would want hanging over the memory of her tragic death at such a young age.)  Fortunately, Captain Cornelius Butt (Avery Schreiber) livens things up a little, and the rock-eating alien prisoner down in the brig makes good use of his limited screen time to steal the show more than once.

The guys have already spent seven years on their current mission and are anxious to return home.  Unfortunately, Headquarters offers them an offer they can't refuse - it's up to them to travel to a distant planet and retrieve the Blue Star (DOO WAH - yes, they stupidly play music and make every one look around, like the Clampetts hearing the doorbell, every time those two words are said).  That's a 27-year trip there and back.  Sgt. Thor (Stephen Macht) had already developed romantic feelings for Galaxina (even though she's a robot and he can't even touch her without getting a serious electrical shock), but that whole unfeeling, silent robot thing seemed to be a pretty big impediment.  While Thor and the guys are sleeping away the next 27 years, though, Galaxina has a lot of time to think - and to reprogram herself.

Somebody spent a lot of time designing all manner of silly-looking aliens, but special kudos go to whoever came up with the idea of including a band of outlaw descendants worshipping their god ""Harley David Son.""  Sadly, though, nothing in this film is as funny as it was supposed to be.

The eye candy interest is Dorothy Stratten as Galaxina, a robot that is designed to look like a woman and ""has feelings"". A sexy woman at that. Just the sort of appliance you want serving on a Police Starship manned by low class bachelors. But don't get pulled in by the ""R"" rating and ""Playboy Playmate"" tags.

Dorothy Stratten is nice to look at and some of the lines Avery Shreiber drops are funny AND sometimes make sense in the world the story is set in but the rest of the characters are not worth talking about.

  Written and directed by William Sachs the story is about the crew of a police cruiser who, after a very long and boring patrol in deep space, are given another mission.  A dangerous mission to Altar One, to get the Blue Star.  The problem is the planet is 27 years away from their current position and they're have to spend the whole time in suspended animation because they're ship is old and can't go faster than light.  This movie would have made a great one for the guys at MST3K.

  Why?  The special effects are cheap, the settings are cheaper and the aliens look silly.  For example, the crew's spaceship, when launching away from Kitty's landing pad, uses the Heat Ray sound from War of the Worlds when turning on the engines.  A town on an alien planet is just a Western set with color lens on the camera.  Most of the aliens are people with rubber masks or half naked women with painted skin or a little of both.  They make fun of Star Trek, Alien, Star Wars and the whole thing makes Dark Star look like Shakespeare.  In other words it is a hoot if you're on drugs.  But otherwise very weird and very, very cheap.

  There are problems with the disc.  The DVD version looks too dark and sometimes the film seems to be squeezed into the screen, like the transfer from video was messed up.  The extras, like the star bios and slide show go by too quickly (and let's face facts - nobody in this movie was ever really a well known star). The Easter Egg is easy to find and boring to boot.  In other words, if you already have a good copy on VHS there is no reason to get the disc.  Go get Silent Running if you want cheap and GOOD sci-fi.",1156636800,4,2063,4.298701298701299

The only possible selling point for this film is the fact that it has in the cast a Playmate of the Year, but cool your ardour, Dorothy Stratten's performance leaves everything to the imagination.  Sorry boys.

Having tried to see the film as a spoof of the sci-fi explosion in movies that followed the success of Star Wars, I failed.  This film is not as funny as Spaceballs and that was a film that was not funny.

A good film needs a good script and this film has all the hallmarks of being made up as it was being filmed.  The problem is that none of the cast are remotely good at improvisation.  The film would have survived its cheesy special effects and poor locations etc if it had a good script.

I strongly suspect that a significant portion of the budget was probably spent on drugs.  Perhaps the film was an excuse to raise money for drugs.

So the only selling point of the film is that it is one of the four made by Dorothy Stratten before her brutal murder and that every second that she is on the screen is one second she is closer to her dreadful fate.

Perhaps the reason she did this film (or entered the acting profession) was because of the insistence of her Svengali-like husband and soon to be murderer.  He destroyed her career and then destroyed her when she tried to salvage it by getting away from him.

So there you have it.  This film is one for the ghouls and perhaps a lesson for the rest of us about the shallowness and pitfalls of the glamour business.  You don't need to see the film to learn the lesson.  Move on and avert your gaze.",1123891200,14,1752,4.308868501529052

The effect shots are just like Star Wars...produced by 10 year old Billy in his backyard with plastic model kits. I nearly fell asleep but forced myself to sit through this so I could just say I did (oh, and to satisfy my hope that Stratten shows that tush...which she doesn't.  :(  But seriously, she doesn't need too...I mean, look at that shot above!!

Also this reminded me of Ice Pirates which you can also watch instead. But if you must force yourself into this, it is sort of worth watching to enjoy Stratten and the DVD is cheap.

7893653,5,6305713529,"fully expected to turn this off after 10 min, but found myself enjoying it immensely.  Yes, its cheesy,  yes the special effects are atrocious, yes the jokes are ham fisted... but my god,  what a hoot.  I loved the spaceship scense such as changing gears and screeching to a halt in space,  loved the terribad aliens makeup and stereotypical crew.  there are some good jokes and lots of sight gags and 'borrowing' from other classic sci fi films.  Some named stars in the cast and they all did a fine job, not taking the film or themselves too serious.  it was pretty entertaining overall",1523491200,,588,4.586538461538462

7893656,1,6305713529,"I am a big fan of comedy, sci-fi, and 80s B movies.  However, this is well below a B movie and I could only describe it as terrible.  The movie is clearly meant to be comedy, but in the entire 90 minutes there are only a couple of moderately clever lines to barely chuckle at.  Hardly anything happens during the movie that makes any real sense.  The music must mostly be public domain (classical), but it alternates between being super clich and having no relation to what is happening in the scene at all.  There are a couple scenes that you could call action, but they are completely boring.  Probably a half hour of the film is cuts to the ship flying in space to terrible visual and sound effects, or other similar scenes that add nothing but unnecessary length to the movie.  If you want to watch 20 plus minutes of a bad model ship flying in space to, for some reason, wind sound effects, this may be the movie for you.  Otherwise I cant recommend it.",1519516800,,958,4.342696629213483
