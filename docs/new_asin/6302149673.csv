This is an excellent video. I can't say enough about it. It was what taught me how to tat. When I learned I had no one to show me. I had never seen or heard of Tatting and was a complete beginner. I only heard of tatting in pass when a friend asked if I knew how. And so I researched it and found this video.

It is slow paced but when you are a beginner it is the right pace. It also taught me how to read a pattern. The rest is history. It is a staple of any tatting library.",1524528000,,555,3.735042735042735
7821756,5,6302149673,"""Tatting is great fun and one of those things you can take with you wherever you go. You will become very well acquainted with this fascinating lace making technique, as you learn the basic stitch, picots, joinings and how to create chains and rings in the traditional tatting method. You will work an edging in two colors and learn how to apply the edging for a beautiful finished project. You will also learn the vocabulary and see how to successfully read and diagram a pattern.""",1213920000,,482,4.682352941176471

She does a great job of showing us how to do everything and does it several times , to make sure that we understand. It goes at a slow pace and that is why I love it. I won't give up my copy as I can use it again and again. Eileene",1213142400,,357,3.475
7821758,5,6302149673,"I just purchased this video and am very pleased with the detail that Mildred goes in to to help even the novice tatter be successful at tatting. I am an experienced tatter and was surprised and pleased to learn a few new  things for myself, even though the video was bought for my volunteers to  learn to tat trim for burial layettes for sick and needy babies for  Newborns in Need.  I am looking forward to sharing  this video with all 32 chapters nationwide and know that our volunteers  will be able to learn quickly, without frustration, from watching this  video.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in tatting.",928972800,12,631,4.571428571428571
