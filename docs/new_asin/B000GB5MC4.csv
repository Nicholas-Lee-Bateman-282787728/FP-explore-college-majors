8130252,2,B000GB5MC4,In comedy there is a thin line between funny and dumb. That line may fall in a different place for a lot of people. I found this act to be way over that line.,1513987200,,158,3.676470588235294

8130255,4,B000GB5MC4,"Harland Williams is by far one of my favorite comedians because of his skill at improve with the audience and crazy oddball humor. The show itself is quite good and if you're already a Harland fan you won't be disappointed. If you're new to Harland then you may wanna look him up on Youtube or see if Comedy Central will be airing one of his specials anytime soon just in case he isn't quite your style.

My only real complaint about this show would be that I've already heard the majority of it on his cd Har-larious, just in a different order for the jokes. So to anyone who also has the cd, don't expect much of anything new beyond his play with the crowd which I assure you is very good.",1237852800,,691,4.234848484848484
