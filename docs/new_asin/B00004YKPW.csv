1374510,5,B00004YKPW,"This latest video from The Brooklyn Tabernacle is uplifting and joyful.  The Holy Spirit uses Carol Cymbala to express Himself in music.  If you can't make it to The Brooklyn Tabernacle in person, this video is the next best thing to being there.  The songs in this video lift, praise and exhalt God to the highest.  The testimonies are powerful and will touch your heart.  No phonies here.  Every word comes from the heart.  The video contains selections sung by The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir and four testimonies of how God touched and changed four very different lives.  The underlying message is that God cares for you, whatever your situation or circumstance is.  This video tells us that God is never too busy to help us, that no one is beyond help and through those He touches, He often touches others.  If you need some joy in your life, treat yourself to this video.  The sound of 250 voices singing about God's grace stirs the soul. This video makes it very clear that miracles still happen even in this modern age.  It makes a wonderful gift.  It's my new favorite thing to watch as soon as I come home from a hectic day at work.  Let this video work its wonders for you.",969840000,21,1182,4.514150943396227
