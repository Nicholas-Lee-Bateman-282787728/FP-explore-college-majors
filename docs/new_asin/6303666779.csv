721644,2,6303666779,"To those who loves Classic Science Fiction films from the 60's, you are in
for a treat. This cheapo production still delivers as we have situations
happening in a spaceship and then on to a uncharted planet. There are creatures and martians and some descent cave scenes...but because the production possibly had a small budget....it shows. They used to show this movie late at night and now its part of my collection. If you dont
expect too much, you should enjoy this little flick that is sold at a great price. I only gave it 2 stars cause the female astronauts voice dubbing is the worse ive seen...",1181692800,14,602,4.583333333333333
721645,5,6303666779,"...how could I give this anything less than a 5 star rating? My mother, Eve Bernhardt, played ""Dorothy"" in this crazy cult film. I personally found it to be a great sleep aid for insomnia. Watching mom in her ""gory daze"" was rather fun just the same.

In the opening of this film, Mom's voice was dubbed over because of a 'spat' she and Roger Gentry got into over...well, let's just say Mom wouldn't agree to be Gentry's body pillow while they were on location.

 Growing up, I was always witness to mom having shoulder and back pain. When I asked her why they hurt so often she replied,
 ""It's because of that damn astronaut suit they made me where in 'Mars'- the costume designer said I had no choice. They wanted an authentic astronaut costume, so that's what they made us wear. The thing weighed a ton. If I wanted to work with John Carradine- I didn't have a choice really .""

My mother wore the lug-nut suit for a month straight while she shot various scenes in all sorts of weather conditions and on various natural (beach coves) and in-studio sets.

In watching the film today, I find it remarkable that it took a month to shoot since it reminds me more of a film kids in high school might throw together one weekend and then stick on YouTube.

I give my mother props though. Listening to the strange experiences she had working on this film(remarkably they go beyond the nasty attitude of a very spoiled and virile Roger Gentry) is pretty cool.

Mom shared that John Carradine was particularly kind to her and she loved working with him- sadly, their 'big scene' which was the equivalent of 7 pages of script was edited out of the final cut. Mom's exact words were,
 ""John was dashing and thoroughly lovely- a true gentleman of the day and completely supportive in shooting a film that couldn't have been more odd.""

Apparently Carradine's soliloquy as the ""Wizard"" took one hour to shoot and lasts (at least) 10 minutes in the film. The lines sounding pseudo Shakespearean are such that 'poor Yorick"" might make infinite jest over.

Should you see it? Sure! It's a classic 'roll your eyes' B (or 'D' as some will prefer to grade it) film.
Fast forward to the bizarre ""special effects"" that make you wonder what strength count of fishing line was used to fly in the spaceship to Mars.

Originally titled THE WIZARD OF MARS; HORRORS OF THE RD PLANET is a classic of sorts... well, as far as seeing a classic example of what script not to choose if you're a working actor.

Pure & simply, I dig this film. It's cool because I get to see some of mom's work back when REAL cowboys still roamed the Warner lot and the union was just beginning to get it's act together to protect actors from lascivious co-stars and heavy astronaut suits all in one.

721646,3,6303666779,"They don't make them like this anymore...no wait, they still do......  Well, When I was very little, this was on a Sunday afternoon adventure theater type show along with other ""greats"" like Robinson Caruso on Mars, the Mole People, First Men in the Moon......you see where I'm going with this?  Okay then, you'll know what I mean when I say it's a classic.  Why did MST3K have to go away?  This would have been a prime candidate.  Anyway, I searched it down in one of my ""nostalgic"" moods, and laughed so hard through the whole thing.  I was amazed at how easily entertained I must have been in my youth.

721647,1,6303666779,"Also known as The Wizard of Mars, this mind-numbing example of cinematic uselessness should be avoided at all costs, although it would perhaps find a fitting place in one of the outer circle screening rooms of Dante?s Inferno.  Cursed with a mindless plot, horrible acting, and remarkably abysmal special effects, this movie ends by insulting whatever intelligence is left of the poor mind afflicted with its 77-minute curse.  Primary responsibility for this farce goes to David Hewitt who wrote, directed, and produced it (very likely doing it all in one day, by the looks of it), although advisor Forrest J. Ackerman also deserves part of the blame.  A Mars exploration team consisting of a clueless pilot, an incredibly annoying ?little buddy? co-pilot, a sour-puss doctor of some subject we know is not geology, and an exceedingly useless female crew member encounter some very strange (and very repetitive) forces in the Martian atmosphere and end up crashing on to the surface, not before jettisoning their life-supporting lander unknown miles away from them.  Unfortunately?for the audience?the crew survive and begin searching for their supply pod.  A raft ride through a Martian mist-enshrouded sea takes them into an underground cavern, from which they explore all sorts of unimpressive subterranean passages before reemerging onto the surface.  When all hope is seemingly lost, they discover an ancient road leading to an alien city.  Yes, friends, this is the greatest insult of all?David Hewitt actually passed this movie off as a Martian version of The Wizard of Oz (originally naming the film The Wizard of Mars).  Having come across an ancient yellow brick road, our four heroes make their way to a ruined ?Emerald City? where they discover Martians with brains larger than their heads entombed in mysterious columns.  Finally, they come face to disembodied face with the ?wizard,? who is none other than John Carradine.  I placed all my shattered hopes in the eventual appearance of Carradine, telling myself he would at least give me one good thing to say about this movie?once again, I was disappointed.  He just spouts off about the Martian genius and how they removed themselves from time and want to go back because life is meaningless without death.  As I mentioned before, the ending (welcome as it is after so much cinematic suffering) is an insult to the viewer?s intelligence.
Please beware of both main titles of this wretched movie because it can be found bearing one or the other.  The Horrors of the Red Planet is the same movie as The Wizard of Mars.  In fact, there are reports that this awful thing has even been known to employ a third alias, that of Alien Massacre.  Consider this movie unarmed yet very, very dangerous.  Finally, do not believe any box cover that lists Lon Chaney as one of the stars?I defy anyone to show me a Chaney of any sorts in this movie.  To avoid any possible confusion, let me characterize this movie in one word: abysmal.",1062201600,5,2986,4.963855421686747
7854153,4,6303666779,"Not super-great but fair so-bad-it's-OK mid-60's sci-fi flick.  A quartet of astronauts head for Mars and make a hard landing. Now they have to slog through miles of Martian terrain with a limited amount of oxygen to survive.  They find an ancient city with preserved, semi-mummified Martians and only one still sort of alive.  The astro's communicate with the Martian when it takes the amorphous form of John Carradine and his splendid speaking voice.  He gabs a lot of spacey gobbled-gook and our space travelers end up back on their craft, craft unharmed but they look like they've been on a week-long bender.  Acting only fair, but some of the actors sound like they're dubbed.  Some of the Martian scenics look good, and the sight of the Martian city isn't bad.  At one point the astro's find themselves in rafts on a Martian lake with creepy prehistoric-looking water animals.  Now water on Mars; THAT would be a monumental find if it were real.  One sort of funny moment is near the beginning when the astronauts are in trouble on their ship.  The co-pilot goes all snippy and says ""We couldn't go to the Moon like everyone else.  NO.  We had to go to Mars.""  Entertaining Saturday afternoon or night flick for 70's nerds like myself.  The DVD is OK-to-good quality, but needs re-mastering.  The DVD is NOT from VCI Entertainment, but from an obscure company called McCullough Entertainment LLC / Mac Filmworks.  The film is not 85 minutes as it says on the DVD cover, but actually 78 minutes.  I understand it is hard to find now, but I believe it is the only version ever produced as a DVD.

7854154,3,6303666779,"In HORRORS OF THE RED PLANET (aka: THE WIZARD OF MARS 1965), four astronauts, in the far-flung year of 1975, are on a fact-finding mission to Mars. Hit by a mysterious cosmic event, the crew is forced to crash-land on the planet's surface. Winding up at the northern polar ice cap, they don their baggy space suits, and set out for the ""desert region"". Obviously, their best bet is to use the inflatable rafts they brought, to head down the Mars canals! Accompanied by droning narration, the adventurers drift along. Oh no! Giant, grunting tapeworms attack! Thank god, our heroes have brought their hunting rifles! Soon enough, they enter a martian cave system, where they must ditch the rafts, heading out on foot, while eerie xylophones play, and more knuckle-headed narration blathers on. Oh no! Lava! HOTRP is another woefully poor / hilariously inept sci-fi epic from the 60's. This, of course, means we're in for loads of robotic non-acting and ding-a-ling dialogue. Mostly, it means watching the characters literally walk for miles, while the narrator rarely takes a breath. Co-stars John Carradine in what amounts to a cameo role, as the WIZARD. Yep, you guessed it, this movie is a loose take on THE WIZARD OF OZ. The female astronaut is even named Dorothy! There's even a ""golden road"" to follow! Oh my! Thankfully, it's not completely un-watchable, and at just over an hour long, it ends rather quickly...",1456185600,2,1416,4.904166666666667

This movie was made in 1965.  The USA was well on the way to landing a man on the moon.  So the trip to Mars depicted in this film was placed in 1975, which was a reasonable expectation at the time.

7854162,3,6303666779,"Horrors of the Red Planet, AKA Wizard of Mars is a good ""B"" late night movie.
Typical old 60's Sci Fi movie with good plot, OK special effects ""for the era"", cheesey acting, bad actors no one ever heard of, etc, etc,
Astronauts in space flight near Mars are forced to make an emergency landing near the polar icecap of Mars after their ship is damaged by a Magnetic Storm.
They spend the next few days on a quest for the ""Main Stage"" apparently part of their ship jettisoned before the crash, to obtain supplies, oxygen etc. and stay alive till a rescue ship arrives.
They journey through a large series of caverns on their way south towards the Main Stage, actually this sequence was filmed in Carlsbad Caverns I believe.
They are threated by limited Oxygen, weird floating plant creatures, Hot Lava and lightning storms along the way.
As they finally reach what they think is their Main Stage that they have been tracking via it's radio beacon signal, they realize that it is just a wreck of an old space probe.
They discover it has some Oxygen left in the tanks, which saves the day, at least for the tme being.
You have to ask why would an unmanned probe be carring Oxygen anyway?
In the morning when the lightning storm clears they find the ruins of an ancient Martian city and set off to explore it.
They find the remains of Martians inside and end up conversing with an aparitian of the Martians collective spirit or whatever who explains the Martians history, the ruins of the city, etc, etc,
Our fearless band of astronauts end up helping the Martian spirit by starting up an ancient time machine of sorts, and are then transported back in time to before the Magnetic Storm that originally stranded them on Mars.
All in all a decent late night ""B"" movie.
My only complaint is the transfer to DVD is pretty bad.
I have this movie on VHS and the picture quality of the DVD is about the same.",1184198400,24,1898,4.472622478386167
