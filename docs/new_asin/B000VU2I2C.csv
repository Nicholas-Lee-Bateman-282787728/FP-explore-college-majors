8428824,1,B000VU2I2C,This DVD is a huge disappointment.  It is only 10 minutes long and is only about the castles in Copenhagen. I had hoped to see more of this beautiful city and to remind us of our trip.  The video was grainy and I found myself bored only after a few minutes of this very short DVD!,1198195200,5,280,3.982142857142857
