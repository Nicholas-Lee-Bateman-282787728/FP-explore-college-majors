8197189,5,B00005NG0Z,"This is an amazing work of art of mythic proportions. The concept is very deep and choreography is stunningly beautiful.

My complaint about the DVD itself is that it is in Region 2, European format, which I was not told when I purchased it. So I have paid over $30.00 for something which has limitations on its use, and that is not cool.",1361232000,,338,4.365079365079365
8197190,5,B00005NG0Z,"I was absolutely delighted to see the performance of the Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan last November in Brazil and have lost track of how many times I have watched the DVD... It is a marvellous dance show that may raise deep questions about one's purpose in life. If you're a wanderer, you just can't miss it!",1096416000,3,314,4.431034482758621
8197191,5,B00005NG0Z,"This piece was breathtaking.  The dancers were not of this world as they demonstrated divine strength and control.  The piece had so much depth as it bridged themes between the East and West.  I recommend it to those with an appreciation for dance, culture and the art of the physical.",1080000000,2,285,4.66
8197192,5,B00005NG0Z,"Great dance performance merging elements from East and West, Georgian folk music with chinese Tai-Chi and meditative themes.
NOt for trigger ready remote control freaks or people who do not know the difference between rice and corn, or between Georgia and Romania.",1070064000,6,264,5.309523809523809
8197193,5,B00005NG0Z,"This video is one of the finest examples of pure beauty.  I have never seen a video like this one before.  And it's not only the dance itself, there's also excellent lighting and camerawork.  All in a perfect harmony.  The music is quite repetitive, but also in perfect harmony with the dance.  Of course this is modern dance.  People expecting to see classical dance won't get what they were thinking to pay for.  But by modern dance standards, this is the best.  Cloud Gate Dance Theatre has won lots of prices for their performances all over the world, if you'll see this video, you'll know why.",1033862400,10,598,4.5754716981132075
8197194,1,B00005NG0Z,"This ""dance"" video is more like pantomime. The dancers seem to be acting out a story of some kind, but it was too boring for me to want to try to interpret it. The entire video consists of one piece accompanied by 10 Romanian folk songs. The ""dancers"" move veeerrrrryyyyy sssslllloooowwwwllllyyyy most of the time, crawling around in a pile of what looks like dried corn. I suppose it's understandable that they move slowly because otherwise they would hurt their feet on the corn. At one point, a single male dancer writhes around in a pile of corn like a 3 year old for about 10 minutes. The only real drama it provided me was wondering if the one ""dancer"" who stood absolutely still for the entire time with corn falling on his head would ever flinch. He didn't. I bought this video because it is one of the few dance DVDs that provides performances as opposed to being a documentary about choreographers or dancers. Well, you pays your money and you takes your chances. The accompanying music is very boring also. Perhaps this would appeal to those who like contemplative, meditative dance. Others beware.",1006732800,9,1109,4.6923076923076925
