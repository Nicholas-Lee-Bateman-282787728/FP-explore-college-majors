8352362,1,B00269BSYK,"I'm sure at least a few Stones fans were curious about this 3 disc DVD set. I took one for the team this week and ordered this cheaply made, but equally cheaply priced infomercial.

Disc 1 clocks in at about an hour and twenty minutes and covers the Jones years and most of the Taylor years. There are some on screen interviews with Mick Taylor and Anita Pallenberg among others, producers and other musicians etc. You will hear audio snippets from Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts, but I doubt they were present for this project. There is footage from every source imaginable on this thing, but none of it has any weight without the original soundtrack. It really is a shame that they didn't acquire the rights to use the Stone's music!???....I know!... please don't stop reading yet!......soooo we get a bunch of studio musician sound a like Stone's songs throughout this suspect production. The documentary has some OK moments, but it loses a lot of credibility without the Stone's music.

Another disappointment is that they breeze through the Taylor years in about 35 minutes of disc one leaving two full discs for Woody! YIKES! The Taylor years are considered the best years by almost everyone and he is available for comments on this set, so why not expand on this? Mick Taylor sheds a little light on the subject of him leaving and Keef(and the band's) drug demons.

Disc 2 takes us from Woody's beginning with The Stones to 1989 and runs around sixty five minutes. Avid Stones fans will probably not learn anything new here, but there is a fair amount of information, but once again it is weakened greatly by no Stones music. Billy Preston, Ollie Brown and Bill Wyman have on screen interviews, but these are not new.

Disc 3 runs about an hour and twenty five minutes and takes us from 1990 to the 2002(It's hard to believe that the Stones have almost rocked through another decade after this release). By the time you've watched this third disc it becomes apparent that the makers of this set only had access to so much footage because we have seen the same footage a dozen times by now. This disc is made up of tiny concert clips and news footage. The producers of this set also pad the entire set with new footage of whatever may have been going on at the time such as the Berlin Wall being knocked down etc.

I have mixed emotions about this set. I thought that for a cheap production this was better than most of them and there is footage that I haven't seen although only in 3 to 5 seconds scraps. I'm as big a fan of the Stones as the next, but I haven't searched out every single Stones feature ever released, so most or all of this stuff has probably been seen before.

I just finished watching the official 'Stones In Exile' DVD a week ago and to be honest there are segments on this set that are more insightful than that one. If both of these documentaries were put together and we got to hear classic Stones music as the soundtrack, then this could have been a pretty cool set.

I can not recommend this set because without the original music it just seems like a big cheesy infomercial with a lame soundtrack, but for under $10 for almost 4 hours of material, it's hardly a total rip off. The video is fairly low grade and looks like it was transfered from VHS and older formats. The first disc froze on me towards the end of the documentary, but I was able to get it going again to finish watching it. Most serious Stones fans won't be impressed with this collection and it certainly won't have them salivating like a pavlov dog.",1398816000,2,3550,4.486068111455109
8352363,5,B00269BSYK,"Brilliant!! Compelling comprehensive, and astounding.  I read a buyer's complaint about a ""lack of music,"" which is totally inaccurate and absurd.  But, if true, so what?  A real Stones' fan would have the music.  This package is a most delicious cherry on an already sensationally delectable cake.  Savor it.",1339027200,,309,5.224489795918367
8352364,1,B00269BSYK,"I should have paid closer attention to the reviews of this product that warned about the lack of actual Rolling Stones music in this video set.  Over 3 hours of Rolling Stones footage and information and not a song.  Bleak.

The information offered and some of the video is nice, but true fans will chafe at the lack of concert footage (46 years of touring, there is a ton of footage available) and potential fans looking to find out what makes the Stones the Greatest Rock And Roll Band In The World will leave the room wondering what the fuss is all about.

There are a lot of interviews with assorted characters-some of value and some that make you scratch you head (who is Penny Arcade and what does she have to do with the Stones?).  Bernard Fowler has some interesting stories despite appearing to be stoned to the gills and this is the most footage of Mick Taylor I have seen, but the rest of the interviews come across as footage of people who have read about the Stones and can repeat a story or two that they read somewhere.

Low price on this package but you are better off passing on it and finding a real documentary.  There are plenty to choose from, with REAL Stones music.",1281916800,2,1188,4.397260273972603
8352365,5,B00269BSYK,"This is the history of one of Rock n' Roll's finest bands,and certainly the longest lived. 3 DVD set shows the very beginning to the present,with the main events and all band members. A knockout. I would recommend to all music fans to get it now!",1281484800,,246,4.369565217391305
