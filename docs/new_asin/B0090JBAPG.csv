5201702,5,B0090JBAPG,"I tend to read reviews on various sites after I see a movie or read a book and before I write my own review. Some reviewers thought the movie was too male-driven and that the women served as accessories. I  do think the primary theme was the unabashed love between a father and son, but isn't that nice for a change, and does that necessarily mean that women were diminished in some way because of it? No! If Tim's mother announces upon the news of her husband's terminal diagnosis that she is uninterested in a life without her husband, well, bravo for her! When men have the same feelings about the pending loss of beloved spouse, they would generally not express their feelings quite so unmistakably and intensely, but thank goodness we women do it without restraint and with absolute conviction. I felt gender-wise the movie was well-balanced, showing faults in female and males characters and showing strengths in both genders as well.

At the beginning of the movie Tim describes his sister, Kat, as being ""just about the best thing ever"". This is a man who values women! Even with the somewhat stringent description of his mother at the beginning of the movie, it is evident he  loves her deeply. His partnership with his wife that includes sharing child-rearing responsibilities, and the fact that he delights in his daughters is further evidence that this is not some male-character driven movie. In fact, when presented with the choice of having a son as his first child rather than a daughter, there is no question that Tim wants the daughter he had grown to cherish.

Also, it was so nice for me to see a family that genuinely cared about each other. I loved that Mary remained just as determined as Tim to support her sister-in-law, Kat. What this movie said to me more than anything is that when children are lavished with love, it allows them to develop the capacity to be loving themselves. Let's give our children a chance to succeed in life by loving them to the core and through and through.

I was already a huge fan of Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy. I will definitely watch for other/more work by Lydia Wilson and Lindsay Duncan. I found Domhnall Gleeson's convincing facial expressions and mannerisms to have such a versatile range that now I have yet another happy excuse to watch the Harry Potter movies again.",1385769600,7,2334,4.69682151589242
5201703,5,B0090JBAPG,I can't remember a movie that has ever touched my soul like this one. I laughed and cried. Wonderful movie,1384905600,135,106,4.35
5201704,4,B0090JBAPG,"This is a charming romantic comedy with a message: value your life, family and friendships.

It's another movie from Richard Curtis, who specialises in this kind of feel good romantic comedy- ""Love Actually"", ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" were all written by him, and he directed ""Love Actually"" as well.

He is an expert in developing these types of stories in an engaging manner, as well as having a message.

What gets this story moving is a father's revelation to his son that they have the power to travel through time.

There are some comedic moments based on this plot device, but the story moves on to be a conventional romantic comedy- including the element of ""boy gets girl; boy loses girl; boy gets girl back again"".

There are several subplots to keep things moving along.

The performances are generally good- Domhnall Gleeson is convincing as the time traveller, and Rachel McAdams is charming as his girlfriend. Bill Nighy puts in another good cameo as the father.

This is an enjoyable ""feel good"" romantic comedy- ideal for a date night DVD at home. It has a happy ending, with a Richard Curtis life message for you (akin to the ending of Love Actually).

Is it a great film? I don't think so, but it is a charming light entertainment. I doubt you would regret seeing it.",1383696000,59,1329,4.7229437229437226
5201705,5,B0090JBAPG,"If you love movies such as: (500) Days of Summer & Love Actually, you will adore this movie! It's witty, charming, funny, and heat-breaking all at the same time. The cast is incredible and kudos to the director, Richard Curtis, for capturing the story in such a beautiful way. Love all the shots of London and Cornwall.",1383523200,39,319,4.614035087719298
5201706,4,B0090JBAPG,"It should be quite clear by now that Hollywood and moviegoers have this undying interest in the premise of time travel.  Generally speaking, time travel flicks are notorious for being either incredibly good or horribly bad.  Just a few of the most beloved films include Back to the Future, The Terminator, and Groundhog Day.  On the flip side, there have been quite a few films that had potential, but just brutally missed their mark.  Just a few of these easily forgettable flicks include The Butterfly Effect, Black Knight, and Land of the Lost.  You'd think a subject like establishing a coherent timeline for the benefit of telling a story would be relatively easy, but often times the writers and filmmakers overlook vital facts that completely ruin and overshadow the whole film.  In other words, attempting to make a successful time travel film can be some risky business, yet they are still attempted - quite often, in fact.  It's also a bit of a rarity to see a romantic comedy incorporated with time travel, all of which happens to be rolled together and incorporated in the new film, About Time.

Written and directed by Richard Curtis (Love Actually, Pirate Radio), About Time stars Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a young man that's told by his father (Bill Nighy) that he has the ability to time travel.  Tim quickly decides he's going to use his ability to find love - while also helping his family and friends along the way.  One night on a blind date, Tim meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and helplessly falls for her.  Using his ability, he rewrites their meeting and molds their relationship into a modern day love story.  However, over the course of his life, Tim discovers that he can't always fix every problem just because he has the power to go back in time.  Lindsay Duncan, Lydia Wilson, Tom Hollander, and Margot Robbie also star in supporting roles.

If you watch this film and end up saying something like, ""I don't know who any of those actors were, but they were pretty good,"" you won't be the only one.  Lead actor Domhnall Gleeson will be nearly unrecognizable to the majority of viewers, but Harry Potter fans will surely know his face, previously playing Bill Weasley in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 & 2.  Regardless, About Time could be the gem that jump-starts Gleeson's career as he resoundingly demonstrates his ability to carry the load as a lead actor.  He's witty when he needs to be, peculiar at times, but obviously has a firm grasp on his emotionally-fueled character.  While you'd assume his best scenes and chemistry would be with fellow co-star Rachel McAdams, it's really with Bill Nighy - portraying his father.  Gleeson and Nighy easily steal the show with their father/son bond, providing several laughs - and the eventual tears.

British and Scottish fans are more likely to recognize the faces in this film, including Bill Nighy, Lindsay Duncan, and Tom Hollander, but American fans will quickly identify Rachel McAdams - famous for her roles in romantic films, including The Notebook and The Time Traveler's Wife.  Although McAdams, who plays the main love interest, is present for the majority of the film, her character offers very little in substance.  This film is nearly and almost purely male driven, focusing on Gleeson's character, almost to the extent that her only purpose is to react to whatever Gleeson says or does in any given situation.  So, in a lot of ways, it feels like McAdams is only along for the ride.  Her chemistry with Gleeson is average, but nothing outstanding or monumental - despite the fact that they make for an odd couple.  Her character's only real contribution is to relay Richard Curtis' odd devotion and obsession with English model, Kate Moss.

This film is a much more romantically theme-driven than it is about time travel, often focusing on the choices of the male characters in regards to his love life, family, and friends.  And, like many time travel flicks, About Time provides an interesting tale that asks the question, if you had the power of time travel, what would you go back and change?  The execution of the plot is a bit blotchy at times, but for the most part, this film is funny and enjoyable for the whole family.  At times, it looks and sounds far too much like a Hallmark card, but that's obviously the nature of Richard Curtis, who has previously written several popular romantic comedies, including Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Four Weddings and a Funeral.  And, keeping with the trend of those films, Curtis writes these characters with a tremendous amount of personality.  Their charm is addictive, and often intoxicating to the extent that you won't be able to stop yourself from embracing their cheeky ambition for happiness.

The main underlying issue of this film comes from the pre-mentioned difficulty with writing a story revolving around the use of time travel.  At first, the rules Tim must abide by seem rather tame and harmless.  He obviously only has to contend with the proverbial ""butterfly effect"" where any changes that are made could have dire consequences on other people.  Of course, just when you think there's very little controversy to be had, the father steps in and adds more rules - creating time travel drama.  Obviously, it's difficult to go into detail without spoiling plot points, but the main issue is even though this film gives itself rules - it can't seem to follow them, creating several gapping plot holes that will leave many scratching their heads.  The good news is these roles aren't terrible enough to cast a shadow over the film.

Overall, About Time is a quality picture, featuring an enjoyable cast and halfway ambitious story.  Even though this film mostly features a youthful ensemble, it will largely be a draw for an older crowd.  The plot is plausible enough that viewers won't lose their mind attempting to interpret the time travel jumps, so best rest assured that this film does focus squarely on romance, landing laughs, and jerking tears.  Domhnall Gleeson proves he's capable of being the leading man and undoubtedly thrives with a lovely supporting cast.  There may be brief moments of plot confusion, but they will quickly drift away, replaced with plenty of laughter - especially from Bill Nighy.  In the long term, whether this romantic comedy has the ability to ultimately contend with the likes of popular flicks like The Notebook or Love Actually remains to be seen.  Time will tell.

5201707,5,B0090JBAPG,"From Richard Curtis, the creative soul who gave us ""Notting Hill"" and ""Love Actually,"" we have an R-rated romantic comedy that satisfies our need for the occasional outing that features unabashedly happy families, solid marriages and well-loved children. Plus, it boasts the most hilarious wedding reception I think I've ever seen.

A young man inherits a family trait that allows him to replay key moments in time and change them to his advantage. We come to laugh out loud whenever he says ""Would you please excuse me for a moment?""

It features:
  * Domhnall Gleeson (""Anna Karenina"") is Tim, the fellow who can manipulate time, but who can't foretell some of the results. You can see the warm intelligence in his eyes.
  * Rachel McAdams (""The Vow"") is Mary, the object of his affections. This Canadian actress is no stranger to relationships with time travelers (""The Time Traveler's Wife""); but we laugh when her Mary insists she won't take her panties off for Scotland! (You'll love the scene.)
  * Bill Nighy (""Blow Dry"") is Bill's father. Dad is a cautious veteran of this phenomenon. This character is droll, wise, and a great father.
  * Lindsay Duncan (LOTS of British TV) Her sweetly ferocious Mum fooled me. I actually thought I was watching the French actress Julie Delpy!
  * Lydia Wilson (British TV) is Kit Kat, Tim's rambunctious sister who causes a LOT of turmoil.
  * Mitchell Mullen (""RED 2"") is Mary's father, Fitz, who is mentally out to lunch much of the time.

The plot becomes fairly complex so it can become a challenge to follow if you have any hearing problems because much of it is either murmured or whispered. The script is witty and warm but there were times I needed captions; I know I'll LOVE my DVD! Yes, I'll order this one from Amazon as soon as it's available.

Important Note: You'll be happy to know one of your colleagues contacted me and both the DVD and the downloadable (is that a word?) version have closed captions! Yippee!",1382054400,160,1971,4.736070381231672

5201817,5,B0090JBAPG,"What a gem of a movie!  I did not get into it until about halfway, when they visited his parents and when he tried to help his sister (you will see).

Lindsay Duncan, Bill Nighy and the actor who played the chubby lovable uncle were the older generation. They hit just the right notes together, the perfect foil to the young people's awkwardness.  By seeing the young people through their witty, loving, understanding eyes, we started to love them too.  At that point, around 60 minutes in, I was finally interested and thoroughly hooked.

I liked it even more when I started to understand the point of  the main character's time travel and realized that there was more to the story than how he hooked the girl.

The movie does not get reflective until the last few minutes, but the wait will be worth your while.  Be warned, there is a deep tragedy that will stay with you, but in spite of the sadness, the story has a happy ending.

The last song, ""the luckiest,"" by Ben Folds, is heartbreakingly sweet and a fitting tribute to the whole movie.

These movies show early relationships and usually end before or at marriage. Like I said, a story line like this is only to be expected, and still, I continue to watch romance movies. But, this one was a refreshing change. Although still focusing on romance--the trials of love, the excitement of new relationships, and the hilarious awkwardness--this movie shows how love and passion lasts past the wedding date and stretches its focus on love to include family bonds. This movie reminds its viewers to live life fully, loving every one completely and noticing all the beautiful aspects of every day despite the hardships that may present themselves.

5202073,1,B0090JBAPG,"Robin Curtis films used to be great, but he's found a rut he seems to enjoy. At first, his stuffed-with-quirky-charm films seemed fresh. Now, he introduces characters who get on your nerves by saying the same sort of things over and over. Yes, eventually things start to happen, but until then you have to listen to nonstop banter by cardboard characters. Someone is introduced as bitter and proceeds to do bitter dialogue relentlessly. Someone is introduced as kooky and proceeds to do kooky dialogue relentlessly. Someone is introduced as understanding and proceeds to do understanding dialogue relentlessly. There is SO much talk in Curtis films, as if he thinks he'll lose his audience if the dialogue stops for two seconds. After twenty-one minutes I gave up on this film.

I've now read reviews saying - and these aren't spoilers - that the plot holes which eventually appear are astonishing in their number. The film patiently sets up numerous rules - then abandons them.

Curtis is turning into the British Woody Allen - and not in a good way.",1518393600,,1051,4.898876404494382

It's such a lovely story that you will be drawn in and mezmerized by the complex ways in which the film posits fascinating connections between life events, both the desired and undesired ones.  Also, one of the best parts is the ending with the beautiful sentiments about living every day as though you can time travel and you have chosen this day in which to live as well as the love you feel when people whom you love love your baby and the self-centeredness you see in people who haven't yet had kids.

Must see show for teens 16 and above that can be relied on NOT to share the funny scenes, and be irresponsible & allow younger teens/kids to watch confusing &  potentially harmful images at an age they cant understand the miriade of issues involved in these first tentative forays into romance and the lessons we have to learn in order to end up with a partner who cherishes u as much as yo do him.",1515456000,,658,4.429752066115703

I don't even want to tell you for sure that it's a tear-jerker because that always deters me from watching.... I always end up answering no to the ""do I really feel like crying today?""

It's a long piece, and since most of it was fresh-ish, the story still dragged me along.  The film sure seems to be a copy cat of Hugh Grant's rom-coms, but the story's nice enough to not gripe about it.

Great last line.

The film provokes me to philosophize in imagined debate about some of the issues that arise.  Probably will next time.  Future me, don't see this on until 2019 at the earliest.  The teary-eye parts need to be as fresh as possible.",1491696000,,562,4.336538461538462

Secondly, this film is about family and normal, simple life being the cherished best part about living and thirdly, the dialogue was so funny and quick and amusing, I laughed all the way through the film! I don't actually like cussing, but this film isn't too bad. I just needed to say I haven't liked a movie this much or felt as good about a movie in so long! I truly adore this film, I wish there were a ton of beautiful and hysterical films like this out there, but let's face it, it's not a genre that really rakes in the dough and that's the e ching.

So what is it?  Science fiction?  Not quite.  Romance?  Well, that's a huge part of the movie -- but it's not the emotional center.  This is a love story between generations.

5203046,5,B0090JBAPG,"One of the most unexpected movies I've come across in a long time. Like Groundhog Day, it asks the question ""what would you do with all the time in the world to change your life?"" When he learns at 21 that the men in his family can time travel, our protagonist is asked what he will do with this gift. As a young man who just wants a girlfriend, our protagonist chooses love as his focus. In subdued British fashion, the result is a comedy about love and life and family in the very best sense. Even superpowers like time travel don't spare him from awkward first dates, bullying flatmates, cruel beauties, foolish friends or driving bosses. Nor do they keep him from the grief of loss. When he gradually learns the secret of happiness, it is a simple one that he passes on to all of us. At the end of this joyous movie, we sighed and remarked ""that was lovely."" And it was and is in every viewing. A lovely, funny, poinient view of life and love and daily life that I want to see again and again. The sign of a great movie.

5203211,5,B0090JBAPG,"I picked up this movie expecting your typical romantic movie- Don't get me wrong I am a sucker for romantic movies (because I am quite a sap!), but let's face it most romantic plots are boy meets girl in a setting that does not allow them to fall in love right away, but they overcome it and end up happily ever after. Some have plot twists, some take place in an alternate dimension, and so on and so forth. But let's face it, many of these characters do not have depth, nor does the movie explore and emphasize other major relationships in the main character's life besides his/her romantic one. However, About Time does both of that and more.

This movie brought out all the feels. It made me laugh, cry, and a couple times angry, but still very enjoyable to watch! The characters were relatable- they felt more real with their goofy, awkward mannerisms (except for Margot Robbie of course, who I have never seen awkward in any movie before!) The plot remained interesting throughout the whole thing and left me still thinking about the movie (and life- since I am a sap!) long after it was over.

5203559,2,B0090JBAPG,"First of all, let me acknowledge the charm and likeability of the actors here -- young and old, they are just putting it out.  It's unfortunate that they're putting it out in a manipulative, shallow piece of work like this.  Obviously, I don't like the whole Richard Curtis idea of how movies should work.. ""Love, Actually"" was bad enough, but at least Emma Thomson and Laura Linney created characters who were involving, but this one is all fluff.  The humor depends on a particularly twee variety of British understatement that American audiences seem to fall for, and Hugh Grant used to get away with a lot, but he's getting a bit old for this kind of thing, and Domhnall Gleeson assumes that kind of role here and does the schtick just as well.  I think we're supposed to feel that fluff can be a fitting expressive context for painful truths about life, time, death, and addiction -- but it can't.  It just comes across as trivial.  If you want comedy that does justice to human pain and frailty, try Shakespeare and Mozart.  As for the time-travel aspect, it's better done, and with a wicked humorous edge, in the original ""Back to the Future""!  This, by contrast, is just candy.  Gleeson, Rachel McAdams, Bill Nighy, Lindsay Duncan and all the others deserve better.  I'm sorry to sound churlish, but Curtisworld just isn't for me.",1470960000,,1338,4.703862660944206
5203560,5,B0090JBAPG,"I decided to watch this one evening when my fiance was out of town (he would've fallen asleep) and was completely surprised by how much I loved this movie. I can honestly say I think it's one of my top 10, possibly top 5. There's something about it that's so perfectly heartwarming and straightforward, even though time traveling is involved. You would think it would seem so far fetched that the story would be completely unbelievable. But the beauty of this movie is it acknowledges how ridiculous it is, embraces the humor and treats it as a fact of life rather than magical revelation. Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams are amazing together. Bill Nighy never disappoints either. Rarely is there a movie where the ultimate goal is to be happy, live a happy life, and love all those around you. It sounds so simple and boring, but it's beautiful and amazing. I eventually made my fiance watch the movie, and *surprise* he didn't fall asleep! He loved it too. The musical score is stellar. We ended up dancing to How Long Will I Love you for our first dance on our wedding day. Maybe I'm a sap, but something about this movie tugs at the heartstrings and in the best way possible. It's nice to see a movie that focuses on the good, positive and happy and does it in a way that is believable and likable. Plus it's hilarious.",1470960000,31,1327,4.533333333333333

5203777,5,B0090JBAPG,"I had not heard about this movie, didn't know anything at all about it other than the premise, and thought I'd give it a shot.

And I was very pleasantly surprised at how incredibly well done it was, on all levels.

The concept is interesting.  Time travel has been done quite a bit before but I really liked the concept in this film.  The limitations really came into play as the movie progressed, and we got to see just how deeply things get intertwined, and how one little bit of a difference, or timing, can change so much.  Similar to The Butterfly Effect in that regard, but I really think this was a much better film in all regards.

The acting - I didn't recognize the main protagonist from anything else I recalled, so for me he was a fresh face, even though I had seen the Harry Potter movies.  But he did an excellent job with the role.  He brought a poignancy and a bit of heart to it.  The other actors also really did well in their characters.  So many times you watch a movie and there's one person playing a character that just doesn't ring true, and when they're on screen, it can be as bad as someone dragging nails across a chalkboard.  No such moments here.

It's one of those movies you watch and wish you could do the same thing, and realize that it is probably a good thing you can't, since you really don't think you'd do as well, and would likely have much worse results...

If you haven't seen it, it's definitely a good movie to get.",1467936000,,1460,4.2846715328467155

5203780,4,B0090JBAPG,"About Time Universal Pictures 2014 Rated R  DVD edition

The main reason I watched this film is the indelible Bill Nighy has a part in it.  He explains to his son Tim, as Tim comes of age, that the males in their family have the peculiar ability to travel backward in time when they wish and re-do some of their actions to correct what they got wrong.  All of the paradoxes of time-travel are conveniently dodged by the story, making it not at all a science fiction story but solidly a relationships story with that slight plot twist.

Domhnall Gleeson plays Tim, Nighy as mentioned plays his father [first name not stated], Lindsay Duncan is his mother, Lydia Wilson gives a good performance as his sister [nicknamed Kit Kat], Richard Cordery is an uncle who lives with the family, Joshua McGuire is a co-worker Rory, after Tim moves to London and begins working for a living; the beautiful Australian actress Margot Robbie plays Charlotte, the first girl that Tim falls hard for, and the Canadian Rachel McAdams [also in Wedding Crashers] has the lead female role as Mary, the girl Tim falls in love with and marries.  Richard Curtis directs

The story gives rise to a few musings about life: how many significant turning-points in our life arise apparently not only by chance, but with the slightest turns of fate: had we missed one dinner or one party, for example, perhaps we would not have married the person we did?  How many other turning-points are really the result of some inner guiding star we are doggedly pursuing, and we would have gotten there sooner or later regardless of some alterations in external circumstances?

The plot device allows Tim to try out various less- and more-sophisticated approaches to the same situations as the audience observes with him whether the outcome is really what he wanted or not.  The story begins in his adolescence and ends with him solidly in adult life with a wife, children, mortgage, job, and ageing parents.  Gleeson does OK as Tim, although he just looks awfully young for solidly-adult Timalways looking to me like he should still be back in high school.  Nighy Im afraid can sleepwalk through a performance as supporting male actor and look just great doing it.  McAdams has what seems to me a too-perfect role as Mary, girlfriend and then a wife without a fault.  The look she has in this part was uncannily like someone I know IRL.  Overall this is a decent if not exceptional film.  The dust jacket refers to comedy.  Its not really a funny movie; it is a growing-up story.  Personally I think both ""4 Weddings & Funeral"" and Love Actually"" are better than this, but that shouldn't detract too much since they are both excellent films.",1467763200,,2699,4.718550106609808

5204009,5,B0090JBAPG,"This is a new favorite movie. It has a really positive message which is nice in the age of zombie movies and superheroe movies destroying towns and movies about people dying in their 50's from Alzheimer's. Did I mention I watched ""Marley and Me"" recently and sobbed through the last quarter (next to my new giant puppy like Marley). Anyway -- I loved this movie.

Perhaps I might be 10% bolder in reaching out to others, 10% more patient with all the things I find irritating and notice the beauty around me a bit more.  How might that change my life?  Will see....",1463529600,,426,4.246913580246914

5204072,5,B0090JBAPG,"First saw this movie on one of the movie channels. I had just left the channel on after a movie I had been watching went off and this came on. Honestly, I do not remember the movie I was watching before this, but I definitely remember this one. I have never heard of it, but I was drawn in immediately and it kept my attention all the way through. Such an awesome movie. It's hard these days to find a movie of this caliber. One that draws you in utterly and completely. At least it did so with me. Found myself laughing, crying and so very very impressed with it. So much so I had to buy it on Amazon so I'd always have it in my video library. Not gonna lie I've watched it several more times since buying it. It has become one of my favorite movies.

Definitely recommend!!!",1462838400,3,776,4.139072847682119

5204113,4,B0090JBAPG,"It was different to say the least. It's more about a father& son relationship than a love story.  It has some romantic comedy times & the comedy is very low key.  It's a small story with some very big actors in it.  It's almost like a vanity movie made for the director's personal library (very famous director who made Love Actually).  Rachel McAdams is gorgeous in an underwhelming role;  she is a very good actress who is really wasted here.  The big star is Domnhall Gleeson who is the son of Irish actor Brendan Gleeson. He's good but not great and unknown at the time.  He has since done some big roles in some blockbusters but in this movie, he's kind of a nice, goofy-looking, love-sick guy.  Not a dreamboat by any means.  He is fine for this particular movie though I did wonder at times what she saw in him to make her fall in love with him.  But it is a love story for the 2 young stars but mostly between a wonderful Bill Nighy as the dad.  Enjoyable as a very small, pleasant movie.",1462320000,,996,4.2727272727272725

Just the movie that will make you feel nice and if you probably make you shed some tears in the end.

The cast is superb...with Bill Nighy, Rachel McAdams and Tom Hollander raising the bar it'd have to be good.  The rest of the talent definitely pulls their own weight but for me the best part of the story/performance was Domhnall Gleeson. If film has an MVP on set award, it's his hands down.

This is a love story.  It's about loving your partner and the children you raise together, loving your siblings, your barmy Uncle, your friends, and your mum.  Most of all it's about a man's love for his dad.

One other thing I love about this film.  It doesn't shy away from the fact that in every family there are one or two people who are absolutely barking.",1461369600,2,738,4.382352941176471

For me there is something special about owning your favorite movies and being able to share them with those around you. This is such a beautiful film that messes with the idea that timing is really everything, but also that some really bad things have to happen in order for some really good things to happen, and even when you can travel in time you can't always change the past.

5204271,5,B0090JBAPG,"The thing I loved about this movie was the message. When Tim reveals his father's two-step secret to a happy life, that was it. The time travel component is the component that pushes the story forward, but is not really what the movie is about. It's funny and sad, serious and light-hearted. It's about strong bonds and things that can and cannot be changed with time. I am not a romantic comedy person, but this is simply a great movie.",1459728000,,437,4.475

5204275,5,B0090JBAPG,Love this movie.  Great story!  Very creative movie.,1459468800,,52,5.375
5204276,5,B0090JBAPG,"Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams shine in this delightful romantic comedy that will bring a smile to your heart. It's sweet story of love and the joys of struggles of maturing through life.

Tim (Gleeson) is a mildly nerdy but totally lovable guy stumbling through life until his father (Bill Nighy) reveals a deep and shocking family secret. All the men in the family have the ability to time travel. They can only go back in time and only to events in their actual life. They can't go back and change history but can redirect events in their own lives. There can be a comparison to GROUNDHOG DAY but ABOUT TIME takes a different direction as Tim mostly uses time travel to enhance his romantic life and always with the best of intentions.

Life changes for Tim when he meets lovely Mary (Rachel McAdams) in a dating in the dark event in a pub. Cool idea. Two couples sitting in the dark and talking without seeing what each other looks like. Needless to say a warm love story ensues. McAdams is always lovely and Gleeson's pleasant gangly looks  endear him to the audience. Tim loses Mary's number so time travel to the rescue to meet her again.

Travelling back to the near past, Tim already knows Mary but she is a stranger to him, so he has to act carefully. Their first night together, Tim feels awkward so he can go back in time twice to improve his performance. The third time is a charm and the idea is hilarious. Tim makes an occasional trip back in time to tweak an event such as who should be his best man. A trip too far back in time to help his troubled sister changes the present in a shocking and unexpected way. Be careful with that time travel.

ABOUT TIME is a great rainy day film to enjoy with a loved one or when you just are on your own and want a ""lift"" after a run day. Sometimes we just need a happy and fun film with no major conflicts or troublesome character. ABOUT TIME is pure fun and delight. If there is one flaw, it's simply that this nice film could have even been better with more humor and time travel. As it is, ABOUT TIME is a delightful sweet film.",1459468800,,2091,4.323979591836735

It's a sweet story of a man who uses time travel to win the woman he loves and help the people he loves ... never for his own financial gain, how great is that?  I wanted to plop myself down in the middle of his wonderful quirky family.  Of course, time travel has rules and when he breaks one of them by accident he experiences the consequences.  My problem?  He breaks it again and again later with no consequences.  Huh?  And he fixed something by breaking the rule again.  Ummmm, no.

5204647,2,B0090JBAPG,"Call me old-fashioned, but even though I was able to suspend disbelief and quite enjoy this, 48 minutes in, the unthinkable happened. How am I supposed to continue rooting for the awkward guy and the sweet girl when she invites him to hop in the sack 2 hours after they meet. End of story for me...the ol' eject button. Ticks me off, too. I mean, what is the POINT? Yes, I see the reviews here and know that a bunch of ""enlightened"" people are going to deem my review unfit for human consumption, but that's tuff. I wish I HAD seen this mentioned before I bothered to watch (of course, one would need to read negative reviews in order to know and, unfortunately, I didn't).

Further, in REAL life, if I met the girl of my dreams, I would not even think of trying to get into her pants that very night. And if she said what this actress did, I would have departed, shaking my head in sorrow.
Sorry, but I have no use for sluts or the supposedly smitten guy they rode in on, or RODE, at least. Not in a romcom, that is. The entire movie is pinned on the relationship between these 2. He went from being too shy to kiss a girl earlier in the movie to hopping in the sack with another on there first REAL date (with no great time lapse between those 2 events).",1455062400,7,1256,4.190082644628099

It's a very wonderful, honest story about a young man named Tim and his life as an awkward british guy who has the strange ability to travel through time. His romance with Rachel McAdams is certainly an important and lovely part of the movie, but it isn't what the movie is about. This movie is about life, through it's good and bad, but mostly through the good. It's a story about family and personal growth. It's also one of the most touching movies I've ever seen and leaves you with such a beautiful message: appreciate life. I've seen this movie three times now and have cried each time.

I've had many a discussion with friends about when they would go back in time, to relive what moments, and what things they would change and why. We came to some of the same conclusions as the filmmakers in that there must be some limits as to certain areas you couldn't go back to - or at least reasons why you would strongly weigh the pros and cons before doing so - and it was interesting to see these theories played out on the screen. (I don't know if an example would ""spoil it"" for anyone, so I've left that intentionally vague.)

The actors were well-chosen and believable. While I wouldn't have thought Domnhall would get with a woman like Rachel, they did a fantastic job of making her... approachable when they first met.",1453852800,,816,4.476510067114094

5204998,5,B0090JBAPG,"Equal parts funny, thoughtful and heartwarming, this really is a good movie.

You won't recognize many of the actors (other than Rachel McAdams), and I feel like that is part of the charm. Domnhall Gleeson is excellent as the quirky and sometimes awkward Tim, McAdams is her normal cute self, and the other characters support the premise in their own fashion quite well. Bill Nighy is especially excellent as Tim's father.

This will fit your favorite girl's need to watch a romantic movie, but without the suffering of the contrived plot points that many movies in the genre seem to have. It will keep you guessing a little, and certainly should provoke some thought. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but the time travel element does not make this movie nearly as sci-fi as you might think. It's merely a device that helps along the story in a unique and interesting way, and provides a few laughs along the way.

I think this movie gives you what you'd really like out of any movie, you escape into the character's reality, and walk away with a smile and some food for thought.",1452038400,,1094,4.571428571428571

5205045,5,B0090JBAPG,"An absitively, posolutely wonderfully beautiful gem of a movie.  All the actors are wonderful in their roles, the cinematography is gorgeous and the music is lovely.

I'm a big Richard Curtis fan.  I love his films.  In ""About Time"" he does it again - he makes me laugh, smile, feel embarrassed, feel silly, feel amazing, makes me cry, makes me happy and he makes me see past what appears to be mundane but is actually quite extraordinary and beautiful if we just take the chance to momentarily pause and look anew.

""About Time"" is more than just about the beautiful relationship one immediately sees on the cover of the Blu Ray or DVD cover.  Take the journey, see the movie.  You won't regret it.  Not one bit.

Cheeres to Mr. Curtis and the wonderful actors and all who were part of this lovely movie.",1450051200,2,805,4.534722222222222

There were scenes throughout the movie that were so clever, I found myself laughing out loud. There were heartfelt moments that warmed my heart and there were scenes that had me wiping tears from my eyes. I bought the movie before I ever viewed it based on its rating and some recommendations. I had a pretty good feeling I was going to like it though after seeing that it was made by the same person who made Love Actually. I was not disappointed. I actually watched it two times in the same day! Not an odd thing for me to do btw, if I find myself enjoying a movie so much that I don't want it to end! This movie has the same ""feel good"" quality that Love Actually has and it made me think about my own life and how precious and fleeting time really is.  I love movies like this that make me think and reflect and leave me feeling all warm and fuzzy. I am very happy with my purchase.",1449964800,3,1008,4.1692307692307695

Maybe his movie could have worked if there was a gorgeous male lead to stare at.

This movie was boring and slow and ridiculous.

Within the first five minutes, it was obvious what would happen and how the movie would end.

There was no twist, which could have saved the movie.",1441065600,2,433,4.2439024390243905
5205737,1,B0090JBAPG,"I really love time travel movies, but I totally hated this movie.

It didn't actually feel like a time travel movie to me, but it was just a do-over-your-mistakes movie.
The guy could only travel back within his own lifetime to moments that he could remember.
So, whenever he would say something wrong, he could just go back and do it over.
Whenever he did the wrong thing or regretted not doing someting, he would just go back and do it over.

As soon as this time travel thing was explained and the guy tried it a few times, I was completely bored and annoyed with the whole movie.
I didn't like the way that he could just play with people.
As the movie progressed, I stopped caring enough to pay attention to how ridiculous the story became.

If this was me, I would immediately go to find out what yesterday's winning lottery numbers were, or what horses won at the races yesterday.
Then I would go back to yesterday morning and go win everything.",1440979200,,951,4.422857142857143

5205773,5,B0090JBAPG,I am not sure where the R rating comes in this movie.  There are some implied sex scenes and some undressing scenes; but nothing beyond what normally is considered PG-13 as far as I can tell.  This shows how a loving family can help a dysfunctional member.  Though this movie involves time travel - try it over and over till you get it right type of time travel; it also is a really good at showing wholesome family relations.  Every one has their own personalities and strengths and weaknesses they all mesh and the relationships are good.  Some important results come from getting to repeat them till they are gotten right; but others require getting it right without time travel.  The acting is superb.  The music is superb.  The dialog is excellent.  The screen play is well constructed.  The characters are complex and well developed.  The only real violence in the movie is a car accident and a not-so-nice guy getting kicked and punched (one each) by the girl he was not so nice to. The plot was good. I don't discuss the plot details so as not to ruin the movie for review readers; but try to give my opinion on the quality.  I liked the movie.  I rented it and will buy it so I can see it as often as I want.  I recommend it.,1440720000,,1234,4.355263157894737

5206196,3,B0090JBAPG,"The movie was ruined by its preachy ending.

Spoilers!!!

As an interesting story it was good but at the end he suddenly goes into preachy mode about how enjoying the present is better. Tell that to his sister who without time travel was miserable and dead. I was pretty happy with the movie until the speech. Then I just hated it. His life might be awesome but lots of us didn't meet the perfect spouse or have a great relationship with our parents or have perfect kids. I wanted to punch the guy at that point. If they'd left out the preachy part at the end the movie would have been much better",1437868800,,597,4.274336283185841

Given what films have become - noise, car chases, explosions, and monsters/ghosts/vampires with overblown emotions, or steroid-pumped egomaniacs who spend a couple of hours destroying persons, places, or planets -  this is a very rare experience, and I recommend it very highly.

It was a somewhat witty, subtly humorous, sad at parts, and very creative for its genre. It had romance, but wasn't the focol point of the film. It was in my eyes more of a father son type of movie. I gave it three stars because it's not a fundamental film I would want to watch again and again. An x girlfriend introduced this motion picture to me.

5206572,1,B0090JBAPG,"Wish I could go back in time and not waste 2 hours of my life. I guess the director thought Rachel McAdams' trademark smirk was enough to save this SLOW and illogical movie. Kept waiting for something interesting to happen...and waited and waited...finally the movie ended and I could move past this forgettable trainwreck. So let's get this straight...this is a ""romantic comedy"" because the guy marries a girl he has sex with the first night he meets her? Guy goes back in time to save his sister from a moderate traffic accident (her fault, drunk driving but let's not judge) only to come back and be *surprised* that his daughter is now a son - who he completely rejects?! So his sister has instantaneous recollection of her new life with the ""right"" guy and the main actor has ZERO recollection of his new reality? The ""tear jerker"" is that he can't go back to visit his dad because his third child is about to be born?! Who vetted the logic of this movie?!

5206599,5,B0090JBAPG,"I'll try not to give away too much of the plot during my review, so not many spoiler alerts.  I bought this DVD during the Christmas sales in 2014.  My husband and I watched it for the first time last night and it was so much better than I was expecting it to be.  Yes, as everyone is aware, there is a time travel aspect.  The time travelling, as would be expected, is more prominent when the main character finds out he has this ability.  Afterall, who wouldn't want to go back in time and fix their perceived mistakes?  As time goes on, there is less time traveling as the overall theme is life, love, and kindess, themes more of us could use in our lives.  The acting was superb by everyone in the movie.  The chemistry between the two main actors was fantastic.  And it was a real treat to see Rachel with self-esteem issues (I'm a big fan of Rachel's!).  You will walk away from this movie thinking one of the following:
- You are very thankful for the other person in your life and will want to do more to show them how much they mean to you.
- Want to go find that special someone and spend the rest of your life letting them know how much they mean to you.
- Realize you are with someone who isn't really that special someone and perhaps want to do something about it in order to live a more meaningful life.
- Or some version of any of the above.

I love movies that allow you to reflect upon your own life; where you've been, where you are now, and where you want to go.  It helps to ground you and reinforce the real goals in life, even if you are in the middle of stressful life events.  Afterall, isn't it all about living life, sharing love, and being kind?

This movie should become a classic.  It's that good!  Kudos!!!!",1431302400,2,1737,4.186746987951807
5206600,5,B0090JBAPG,"Wonderful, heartwarming movie.  Bill Nighy as the father is superb.  Domhall Gleeson is wonderful.  I think we've lost something in America as far as acting talent.  The British just blow us away.  I think it's because Hollywood has become mostly about employing children and other family members of stars or former stars instead of looking for real talent.

Sorry, I guess I am spoiling something here, but oh well. It's instead a great feel-good movie! Some great lessons are taught and learned by the end, and I love the unique characters.

There are tender moments, humorous scenes, and sometimes laugh-out loud happenings that make the people in this film so easily and comfortably likeable.  They could be any of us - only with a significant difference which is revealed early in the show.  The fact that this twist is made believable so readily speaks to the talent of the writer, the director, and the excellent acting of the people who portray the characters.  I promptly ordered six copies of this to share with my family for Easter - in celebration of them and of our times together.  I LOVED this movie.

The rest of them, though, are no more than prompts for various jumps in the narrative.

In the end, this movie doesn't really know if it is about the time travel, relationships in one's life of how one could affect the other. There is no real message to make it all connect.",1428710400,,568,4.308411214953271

5206879,4,B0090JBAPG,"A recent book (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twee-The-Gentle-Revolution-in-Music-Books-Television-Fashion-and-Film/dp/0062213040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film</a>&nbsp;by Mark Strand) has announced the arrival of The Age of Twee.  Twee, if I understand it, is a generational cultural movement like punk, but is more or less the opposite of punk, and to some extent a reaction against it.  Where punk was cynical, gritty, defiant, aggressive, and disorderly, twee is sentimental, gentle, retiring, friendly, and innocent.  If punk is a cold slice of leftover pepperoni pizza, twee is a fresh baked ginger cupcake with vanilla frosting.

About Time seems an exemplar of The New Twee consciousness.  This film set in contemporary Britain (Cornwall and London)is the story of Tim, the son of an eccentric family whose men have always had the ability to travel back through time, as his father (Bill Nighy) informs him on his 21st birthday. Understandably skeptical at first, Tim finds he actually can time travel, a talent he devotes mostly to trying, rather awkwardly, to manage his relationships with women, finally finding his true love in the form of an attractive though somewhat nerdy American girl, Mary (Rachel McAdams.)

The story is what might be called a ""soft"" time travel film: the time travel is effected simply by willing it, with no technology involved, and works only going into the past and back to the present starting point, so there are no science-fiction-like visions of the future.  The movie emphasizes relationships over physics, and though it's frankly sentimental, and I thought a little long for the material, the script is intelligent and the acting very good.

I think About Time would appeal to those who want to see a film that interestingly combines romantic comedy and time travel fantasy, and who don't mind if it's a little, or more than a little,  ""twee.""  It may really be a three star film overall, but I'll add a fourth star for the film's exploration of some of the personal ethical implications of time travel, an issue which seems rarely considered in other time travel films I've seen.  Advisory:  ridiculously rated R for occasional language and a few explicit but fairly mild sex scenes.  The Universal Blu-Ray disc is of very good quality; there is also a standard DVD available.",1426118400,,2434,5.3905013192612135

From the mind behind Love Actually - this movie made me want to be a better person.  The moral of the movie speaks to me. And it's funny - laugh out loud funny at times. About Time strikes a perfect chord between funny and touching - it does not take itself seriously, but it takes its message seriously. I love this movie, possibly even more than I love Love Actually.

From a critical standpoint, this movie isn't great.  It is filled with plot holes, inconsistencies, and escapist story contrivances. But if you can approach this movie the way this movie asks you to approach life, then I think you'll love it, too.

5207098,4,B0090JBAPG,"After helming two very underwhelming ensemble comedies, writer/director Richard  Curtis has made a far more concentrated and successful film with About Time, which starts out as a romantic comedy and gradually expands its view to look at one man trying to weigh what is most important to him as his life changes and his concept of family expands. The film also happens to have a very clever conceit involving time travel, which Curtis presents as something that is down-to-earth and ordinary, making the extraordinary ramifications  that eventually come into paly all the more resonant.

While there may be some gaps in the logic of the science-fiction conceit, it hardly matters because Curtis ensures that the gimmick is not a matter of phony science. There is no machine, portal, or any other kind of device that one would usually associate with time travel. Instead, Curtis makes it a trick of genetics and the mind. It is a form of wish fulfillment, really, with the potential to actually change the course of one's life ot, in some though instances, to enforce the knowledge that there are certain things in life that cannot be altered.

The result is a surprisingly touching film, in spite of Curtis' inconsistancy in maintaining the central concept and a solid narrative focus. There is a long stretch when Curtis seems to have forgotten entirely about the time-travel aspect, and the screenplay goes through three major tonal shifts: A comedy of errors about unrequited love, a romance about finding and keeping true love, and a tragedy about inevitable loss. In the moment, these apparent irregularities feel off-putting, but by the time the film reaches the conclusion of its thesis, it becomes clear that the inconsistencies are part and parcel of the story of one man's life.

He is Tim, a shy young man who has problems engaging with women. On the occasion of Tim's 21st birthday, his father tells him the he, like all the men in his family, has the ability to travel back in time but only to moments that he has experienced and can remember. Tim tests out the unbelievable act, and upon  its success, makes it his goal to kiss a young woman whom he was to shy to kiss at a New Year's Eve party.

The first stage of Tim's experience with time travel involves his failure to win the affection of his sister Kit Kat's friend Charlotte, who stays with the family for the summer and whom he tells about his feelings for her on the night before she leaves. If only he had told her earlier, she tells him, perhaps something could have come of his feelings. The first indication that not everything is pliable, even with time travel, comes when Charlotte essentially tells Tim, who has gone back to the first day of her vacation, the same thing on the first night of her stay, and nothing develops between them.

The second part of Tim's life involves his relationship with Mary, whom he meets by chance while living in London. The first complication arises when he tries to repair a disastrous opening night of the play written by his roommate Harry only to discover that, in the process, he ends up never meeting Mary. In the film's creepiest sequence, Tim stalks Mary and then goes back in time again to stop her from meeting a perfectly decent man she had started dating the night after she would have met Tim. The only reason it works is because Gleeson plays the inherently manipulative actions with a non-malicious romantic naivete.

Tim and Mary's relationship makes up the bulk of the film, although their bond is more generically sweet that genuinely affecting. Tim saves his curious ability for key moments in their relationship: ensuring that their first sexual experince is perfect, coming up with the right proposal, and making sure his best man at their wedding does not ruin the day. Otherwise, Curtis provides a fairly weak romance, bolstered only by a montage-itself a form of cinematic time travel-in a subway station where Tim and Mary have a succession of happy days.

The romance, though, is only a catalyst for the film's third act, in which time travel is no longer an easy cure-all for Tim's problems. There are repercussions, for example, when Tim tries to save his sister from a poisonous relationship that ultimately leads to a car crash. By taking her back in time with him to a point years, Tim accidentaly prevents the existence of his daughter, who is replaced by another child in the new version of the present.

Whatever shortcomings the film may have, the final shift in focus is not one of them. Here, Curtis centers on the relationship between Tim and his father, who is dying of cancer, and at this point, About Time more than compensates for its struggle to find an emotional foothold for the premise, as Tim clings to the past to avoid the most substantial loss in his life. For once in the film, time travel is not just a gimmick but a lifeline, anf the film's acknowledgement of the unavoidable in the final act informs not only the summation that follows but also everything that has come before it.",1423440000,2,5049,4.745724059293044

All of the people are lovely human beings, and the closest thing to a bad guy really isn't that bad at all.  The odd plot itself doesn't spend anytime setting itself up.  After a very brief introduction through which we get an overview of how idyllic family life is, we drop into a huge New Year's Eve party.  The narrator -- the romantically awkward young man, Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) -- flubs the New Year's kiss that clearly hurts the young woman he happens to be standing next to at the countdown.  The next day, Tim is called by his gentle dad (the always appealing Bill Nighy) to reveal a big secret.  The secret was that all the men in the family could travel back in time.  There was no further explanation for this ability, and no details were provided as to how many generations this went on, or who discovered it or who bestowed it on them, or why the women don't have the gift, and so on.  The filmmakers simply set the odd cornerstone in place, and got the story started.  And the thing is, what followed was so lovely, it didn't matter not one bit that the details were left out.

Tim's dad warns him away from the pursuit of money.  Dad, himself, used his extra time to read all of the best novels -- all of Dickens THREE TIMES, he says -- and recommends he use the gift to pursue what would satisfy him most.  Tim decides he'd use it to find real romantic love.  You'd think by looking at Tim that this was going to be about this awkward young adult getting into goofy situations and using this gift in slapdash ways that were sitcom comical.  But it does not go that way at all.  To Gleeson's credit, he evolves convincingly from this gangly youth to a solid young man, always aiming from a clear emotional center.  After an accidental meeting, he takes particular aim at Mary, a woman as transparent and uncluttered in her affections as he is, and perfectly embodied by Rachel McAdams.  Her smile alone launches a thousand good emotions, so it's easy to buy into the chemistry she and Gleeson have.  There are warm, humorous exchanges between them that feel breezy, which made it a sheer joy to watch their affections for one another grow.  They seem to deserve the best and they get it.

They successfully build on what they find in each other, showing the good life as a progression of love itself.  Nothing else matters without it, and every scene in some way embodies that theme.  Basically it shows that a good life is the consequence of sharing oneself with others.  While there were aspects that remind us of a romantic comedy, the comedy was understated, like what would come about from good conversation and a warm heart.

That time-travel element in this film is at times left behind as the story moves forward, and you almost forget about it.  Tim uses the odd talent rarely, and always toward some greater good, for himself or someone else he loves or respects.  And that's what's really appealing about this movie, in that everyone seems to be already full of what's necessary for living, without hangups, and therefore seem to have a lot to give to others.  In other words, the plot uses all of the best features inherent in human nature, traits we all have to some degree, and the film reaffirms belief in them.  Time travel is just a means to actualize these emotions, and toward the end, it's brought back a time or two almost to consciously remind us that this is where it all started.  By that time, you're already so caught up in the plain pleasure of it all, you almost forget the quirky center.

After renting this, I thought about this movie for days, and each time I thought of it, I felt good all over again.  There were moments that were deeply moving, other parts that had me beaming with joy.  I knew I had to have this to watch again and again.  It's uplifting; it's life affirming; it accentuates our better natures.  This is highly recommended for what ails you.

That is, if anything ails you.  If not, you'll still love it.

It is unique in the way that it is technically sci-fi, seeing as it deals heavily with time travel, but the ""science"" is totally ignored because the time travel is only being used to illustrate timeless principles. The attitude and life paradigm that Tim arrives at by the end is a truly profound and liberating one that I believe we should all try to apply to ourselves.

5207419,3,B0090JBAPG,"At age twenty-one, you're quite a bit savvier than you were in high school but are still quite callow.  If you're in college, it is a time at which graduation is approaching quickly, so that age can feel like a significant crossroads.  In ""About Time,"" 21-year-old Cornishman Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleason) has a lousy time at a New Year's Eve party and seems not to like where he is in his young life; soon after, his father (Bill Nighy) informs him that the men in his family have the ability to travel backward in time.  Tim decides to use this unique power to find a romantic relationship.

After several months, Tim heads off to London to train to become a lawyer and find love.  Predictably, the protagonist learns that time travel cannot solve all problems, that going back to change one thing in the past has trigger effects on other circumstances, and that everyone, even time travelers, has to face life's vicissitudes.  Tim also comes to understand something that only the most precocious 21-year-olds know--that most things one worries about never come to pass, but that life's most wrenching ups and downs almost always come from events completely unforeseen.

While ""About Time"" is undeniably a chick flick, the time travel/sci-fi aspect is enough to make the film intriguing to some men as well.  This film was somewhat well-received, and, if not great, ""About Time"" is a decent movie that recalls being young and is at least watchable whether you found the love of your life at 21, whether you lost a love at that age (and whether or not you were subsequently glad that you did), or even in the fairly unlikely event that your twelve months at 21 were entirely uneventful.",1419984000,,1685,4.7465753424657535

Hard to fit it into a particular category, but It seems to be a coming of age movie for an entire family that goes through some of the usual and some unusual passages through it's lifetime journey.  Well balanced handling of some funny and serious topics.  A little bit of a pull on those heart strings...have some tissues ready.

5207748,4,B0090JBAPG,"About Time is surprisingly good.  While the main actor played by Domhnall Gleeson (heh, can't say I've ever heard THAT name before) looks way too young for this role since he eventually plays a father and a lawyer, his character is charismatic enough to really make the storyline enjoyable.  Normally me and romantic comedies don't get along, but About Time does a few things better than all the other ones- it doesn't rely on cheesy fluff jokes that only women would find funny (no offense ladies- I realize a lot of times guy humor isn't for women either) and it doesn't try to be anything other than a nice young man desiring the girl of his dreams but... there's a catch.

Another bigger reason why this movie is better than most- it implements a time machine type storyline.  Now if you think it's weird that such a film would include time travel, well believe it or not it works amazingly well since it's used rather creatively.  Whenever Domhnall finds himself in a situation where he's having a conversation with a girl that he's attracted to and it doesn't go the way he wants, he simply steps inside the nearest closet and abracadabra!  He's now a few minutes in the past and has a second opportunity to correct himself and approach the girl in a more respectable way that won't scare her away, haha.  The humor utilized here is really good!  This is basically the theme for a good chunk of the movie, until he eventually finds a particular fondness for Rachel McAdams character.  From this point forward, the story actually improves as the two go through silly young romantic love.

This movie has about as much substance as a romantic comedy can have, which might not be a lot but it's enough to satisfy me at the end of the day which is honestly all I expect out of a romantic comedy.  With that said, the final segment is REALLY sad.  I wasn't expecting *that* to occur.  Let's just say it's not all charms and happiness!  Something a little shocking happens which is probably why this film is also considered a drama.  Oh and maybe it's just me, but most of the ladies are pretty attractive too which is an added benefit.  No I'm not referring to Rachel's mother silly.  You know which ones I'm referring to. :)",1414972800,,2226,4.552763819095477

5207802,5,B0090JBAPG,"The movie About Time, is a beautiful story that makes you grateful for what you have and thankful for the moments you have yet to live.  The movie is perfect for a romantic date or a night with the girls, but fellas do not be afraid to partake in the film without a lady by your side.  For those of you who have yet to see the movie it is about a 21 year old man, named Tim, who discovers that he can time travel.  He decides that he will use his new found gift to set out on a quest for love, but as anyone can guess the path along the way is not a smooth one.  The movie develops this crazy time traveling love story through the acting and characters, the use of music and sound, and the overall plot.
What makes the movie so appealing in many ways is the impeccable acting.  Our leading man, Tim Lake, is the first character we meet, who describes himself as too tale, too pale, and too giniger.  He follows the description of himself with the description of his mother, father, uncle, and dear sister, who all play a role in making the movie come to life.  His family is not the only characters displayed in the movie in fact we meet many more characters along the way such as Mary our leading lady, her friend, and also some of Tims friends Jay, Harry, and Rory.  Every character is unique and develops the film with their special little quirks.  The movie has multiply scenes that paly on more than one of the characters and one of the best scenes that shows all of the fabulous acting and development of the movie is the wedding and reception scene.  We get a clear idea of who the characters are from Tim to his little sister Kit Kat.  In this scene Mary is walking down the aisle towards Tim while a song titled Il Mondo plays that Mary chooses to use just for the sake of her husband to be.  She walks laughing down the aisle looking lovingly at Tim as he giggles back at her dancing to the ridiculous song.  The two characters show that they are fun loving and not afraid to enjoy a joke which adds to the appeal of their romance.  While Tims mother and father stand in the rows watching as the beautiful bride makes her way down.  Tims father decides to dance to the song at one point, because he was the one to show the song to Tim in the first place, but his wife and Tims mother shuts it down rather quickly.  The quick moment on screen demonstrates the attitude of both the parents the more ridged, sturdy, as Tim puts it, mother and the silly and fun father.  Those aren't the only characters displayed, it also shows Tims sister, uncle, friends, and Marys friend who each show their unique quirks in just a few minutes on screen.  With all of the great presentation of the characters by the actors it makes the movie more relatable and you feel like you could find these sorts of people in your very own life.  The development of the story would be impossible without the spectacular quirks every actor adds to their character.
Sound makes a big difference in the world of entertainment and About Time is no exception to that rule.  But in my opinion the movie uses music perfectly to develop the mood of story.  Most of the movie is quite happy and the music follows but the best scene to show the use of music is the scene when Tim and his father say goodbye for the final time.  The two travel back to a wonderful day on the beach, just father and son, with a happy and reassuring song playing in the background.  The two run around on the beach smiling and sharing laughter as they both know when the day ends they will have to go their own ways, one to Heaven and one to a third baby in Tims life.  But the piano playing the tune makes the music weave in and out of the sadness you feel for Tim and the happiness the two shared on that day at the beach.  That scene is not the only one to best demonstrate the use of sound in the movie.  In fact the last scene of the movie is the best use of sound.  The use of the music, the narration by Tim, and the little additions from the characters along the way makes the ending so meaningful and causes you to look back and think about how you will live your life.  It puts a smile on your face and warmth in your heart due to the senses of love you can feel between the characters, and random people they throw in, throughout the montage of a normal day in life.  Without the sound of the movie there would be a major missing piece in the development and the meaning behind the story would not be as well betrayed to the audience.
  Another reason for the beauty of the movie is due to the overall plot, which is just as much about the relationship Tim has with his family as it is about him finding love.  Tim has a strong relationship with his family and the movie plays on the importance of that very well.  The two most important family relationships that the film plays on is his relationship with his father, James, and his relationship with his sister, Kit Kat.  This is not to say that the relationship he shares with his mother or uncle are any less important but the movie primarily focuses on the other two relationships.  You tell that Tim and his sister have an amazing bond from the beginning of the movie in his description of her, he states in so many words that she is the most wonderful thing he knew and will ever know.  Just as clearly as his relationship with his sister is his relationship with his father which is also shown very quickly in the movie.  Such scenes as when Kit Kat gets in a car accident and ends up in the hospital shows the importance of Tim and Kit Kats relationship as Tim and Mary run to her side.  The scene between Tim and his father when his father does his best man speech makes the love between a father and a son a key to the development of the movie.  Obviously that is not the only part of the plot the other part includes, and could be considered the main plot of the movie, finding love.  In this movie Tim and Mary have a meet cute moment at a dating in the dark restaurant that sets up the beginning of a beautiful relationship, but due to the ability to time travel and a friend in trouble causes that moment not to happen.  But do not fear the two have another chance to spark their relationship and in the end the two marry and have three children.  About Time plays on the beauty of love but not just the love you find with a significant but also with the love you feel for your family giving the movie depth and making it easy to relate to.
About Time develops through beautifully done story telling by the actors, great use of sound and music, and finally the plot makes the movie effective in conveying emotion and sharing a wonderful story.  In the end the true lesson you get form the movie is to enjoy every day as if it were your last chance to live it.  That no matter how many times you go back in time nothing will ever be better than the living in the moment.  If you're looking for a movie with meaning and a good story, About Time is the way to go, it amplifies the importance of love and gives a character for everyone to relate to.  The film is amazing and will make you grateful for everything you have in your life.",1414368000,2,7159,4.215542521994135

It's a surprisingly funny and touching movie that tells the story of a guy in his 20s navigating the unique loves of his life - his new girl, his Dad, and his sister.

It's what this young man learns about his relationships with his wife, then his small children, and finally his father that elevate the concept.  Personally, it made me realize there are a lot of moments I wouldn't want to repeat or even change.  The unpredictability and distinction of each day is what gives it meaning, value, context, and pleasure.  Some mistakes would be nice to erase.  Others are obviously better left intact because they make some special opportunity of personal growth and connection to others possible.",1412985600,2,664,4.990909090909091

I kept waiting for the conflict point in the film, and at some point I relaxed, understanding that it wasn't that kind of film.  Unabashedly joyful.  It's really tender and lovely and the guy's wit provides some needed grit to an otherwise super sweet film about a family where two of the men can time travel.

5207997,4,B0090JBAPG,"About Time
 For the third time in her short career Rachel McAdams stars in a time travel movie.  But do not be led astray, is not some Sci-Fi extravaganza.  About Time resides solidly in the category of Chick Flick.  I do mean that in a respectful, non pejorative way.  I use those words only to orient the reader to the right frame of mind.  Love dominates this film, love in many of its possible aspects.  We have romantic love, love of a father for his son and the love of a son for his father.  Many heartwarming (or shamelessly manipulative) moments make the forewarned grateful for carrying a pocket full of tissue.
 Tim, played by Domhnall Gleeson, upon reaching his majority at age 21 is carefully informed by his dad (Bill Nighy in a remarkable performance) that men folk in his line can travel backward in time.  Dad shows his son how to use this gift with wisdom, and avoid becoming rich, bitter and alone like one of their relatives.
 Richard Curtis both directed and wrote About Time.  He has written or directed or produced (often in some combination) of such famous films as Notting Hill,  Love Actually and The War Horse-all successful films.  He also wrote for British TVs superb comedy Black Adder with some of the funniest bits ever written, so I think anyway.
 Curtis chose his actors with care.  The deliciously cute and cuddly Rachel McAdams plays Mary, the girl that geekish young lawyer Tim entices into falling for him, using his secret talent to re-do some awkward moments in courting.  McAdams and Bill Nighy both, in this film, exhibit a sort of naturalness that seems to go beyond acting.  They give no sense that they are delivering lines, but only a sense that they are speaking naturally as ordinary people would.  Let us further say that Curtis as writer has given their personalities virtues that go well beyond what ordinary people expect of themselves.  The characters all live on a moral plane that most of us can only aspire to.  Seeing the film will make me more aware of everyday kindness that we often overlook in our busy lives.
 Other cast members include gorgeous 23 year old Australian actress Margot Robbie.  She plays Charlotte.  Lydia Wilson is Kit Kat, Tims younger sister.  Either great talent or great direction by Curtis brings forth a lively, and again natural, performance in this smaller role.  Lindsay Duncan (who played the mother of Brutus in the HBO series Rome) gets to deliver one absolutely terrific line, smartly spoken.  I love the cast.
 About Time carries an R rating for two hours and 3 minutes.  It grossed $58 million and gets three tearful saw blades.",1411257600,,2621,4.711453744493392

5208047,5,B0090JBAPG,"About Time has a delightfully clever screenplay, beautiful acting, and one of the sweetest love stories everand it's not merely a love story between the two main characters. It's the story of a family's love for one another.

When Tim (Domhnall Gleason) turns 21, his ""Dad"" (Bill Nighy) informs him that the men in their family are able to travel in time. They can't go forward in time. They can only return to events that have already occurred, and they can't change history. When Tim leaves his rural home to work in London as a lawyer, he meets and falls in love with Mary (Rachel McAdams). Tim uses his gift to win Mary's heart, to create the perfect romantic proposal, to make sure he has the perfect best man's speech at their wedding, to spend extra time with Dad when it's of the utmost importance, and to help his sister, to whom he's wonderfully loyal.

Best of all, Tim learns from his time travels to enjoy each day, to appreciate his family, and to cheer on his friends. He knows how to fill his relationships, or simple chance encounters, with love and joy.

Tim: ""We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.""

5208496,3,B0090JBAPG,"While technically accurate (like the explanations of a politician), the official description of this film is deceptive.  It would seem to say that this is a movie where a guy goes back in time---say another era---and brings a girl forward in time, or stays there.  No, not at all.  On his 21st birthday, and after an embarrassing New Year's Eve party where he'd behaved like a cad, Tim's father (Bill Nighy---whom I'm coming to delight in finding in a film, much the same way it's always a pleasure to see Maggie Smith show up) tells him that the men of their family can time travel...BUT...

Only within the span of their own life an memories,  AND it doesn't really seem to have any consequences if you change anything (contrary to all we've been told).  Although...  He warns his son that going after wealth and the like has ruined the lives of previous male relatives.  No worry though, the son  (played by a very expressive and watchable Domhnall Gleason) announces that all he wants is love.  And at that moment it seems the movie is doomed---it's just the sort of stupid thing you'd expect todays low-expectation minded youth would say.  And for a bit, it seems the movie is going to play that line.  The first thing Tim does is to go back to that awful NYE party and fix things---by kissing the wall flower he found himself standing next to at midnight, also without a date.  Then he tries to fix other issues that come up, each getting more and more complex and the solutions begin to have unanticipated consequences, until finally, fatefully, he realizes that somethings shouldn't be fixed, and that some people can't be helped by extracting them from problems they need to solve.

And then, he gets married (the wedding itself provides some great moments where both father and son are popping back and forth in time to fix a particular moment at the wedding) and has his first child.  It is with this event that we find there are indeed more conditions on time travel.  Once you have a child, a line is drawn across your ability to travel backward---go back before the birth and you end up with a different child when you come back...  Thus, from here the movie builds to a rather unexpectedly poignant climax...and I should probably say no more.

It was very watchable, entertaining and humorous.  I'm not sure how often I'd watch it though---one of the characteristics that for me drives the star ratings.  Still, it's a very nice rom-com, and if you like those you should like this effort.  An added incentive:  It's not really a female centric rom-com;  the focus is on the men in the film---the wedding, for example is not a centerpiece of the film and there is no bridezilla component, the usual idea in rom-com marriage scenes, it's just a set piece for the idea of time travel as the film explains it.  I would hazard the suggestion that it might be a romantic film for the date who doesn't usually like to sit through rom-coms, or at least after you sit through his blasto-hacko-whacko bombadventure.  Of course, if it takes two movies to get the guy into your arms, perhaps another guy is what's needed.",1405209600,4,3124,4.626134301270417

5208545,5,B0090JBAPG,"I'm not an overly emotional guy. I don't wear my feelings on my sleeve.

But by the end of this movie I was crying my eyes out. I mean absolutely bawling!

And not just sad tears either. I was happy, I was sad, I was nostalgic. I was entertained. It was just a big crazy ball of emotion rolled into one movie.

The story just has so many different concepts within it. It's a cute romantic comedy, while showing the pain of unrequited love, the joy of finding your soul mate, the magic of being close with your parents and the suffering of losing them, the innocence of childhood, the unbreakable love for a child, and the overall meaning of life. And somehow they do all of this in a nice cohesive story in under 2 hours!

Plus, they don't make the time travel hokey. There is no ridiculous explanation of how it works. The story tellers just say it works and then it does. That is so much better than giving it an inane explanation. I'm a huge sci-fi fan so I'm generally sceptical about time travel movies. This was no exception to that rule. But this movie pulled it off and made it great.

5208559,4,B0090JBAPG,"It's all about time. 'About Time' is that wonderful, little, sleeper hit that went into the theaters and quietly snuck out but still ran away with plenty of cash to spare. It's that film that little remember having heard of when it was released, but now lies to be seen clearly on DVD, and so I rented and watched it. It's a romantic- dramedy starring type casted 'Rachel McAdams' of 'The Notebook' and 'The Vow' fame. Of course I'm not complaining she was made for these types of roles. The plot line was fairly simple and I thought knew how the film was going to play out, but then I was delightfully surprised when it actually surprised me. It fooled me in a good way. My review of 'About Time'.

'About Time' tells the tale of a young and awkward British man by the name of Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) who is informed by his father (Bill Nighy) that the male in a long line of his ancestry has the ability to time travel, particularly to past events that the subject was involved in. Tim is beyond excited, his dream of which is to get a girlfriend. He continuously travels to the past to make his future better, along the way he meets the girl of his dreams, the one (Rachel McAdams) his pans re to improve their future by changing their past.

By reading that plot line you'd assume that for the climax our lead, Tim would most likely make a horribly bad mistake in the past and change the future for the worst, and having to fix the wrong he had done in the past to make the future better, right? Nope, no drama, the film is just a light, warm, romance, whose ending is necessary and sweet. It's that fairytale ending just without the fairies. That's how delightful the film is to see. The scripting is nice, and while tense when it needs to be it never goes full out gloomy like that of 'The Notebook' and 'The Vow' everything in the end, is good. Nothing done to make the story sad, you still cry but its tears of joy. The script allows moments of pure wit, the film is funny in times that it needs to be and more serious when it needs to be. The film balances all aspects.

The cast allows characters that are more one dimensional to become more fleshed out, real. I cannot imagine anyone else portraying out lead, Tim other then 'Domhnall Gleeson'. Gleeson is well comedically timed and wonderfully convincing as Tim, and shares great chemistry with the rom-dramedy reliable 'Rachel McAdams'. McAdams is sweet and smooth with Gleeson and their both lovingly compatible off each other. 'Bill Nighy' is a much welcomed co-star and screen stealer as always.

But sometimes the film can't help but lag. There is too much, the film could have used a few cuts to better stream line itself more. At over 2 hours, the film feels overlong and sometimes you get an over dosage of sweetness, and you kind of start to get bored of it, as happy as the film is, it loses steam toward the end due to a lack of edited out scenes.

All and All 'About Time' is a wonderfully cheerful film, with a great pare of leads including Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams, and Bill Nighy, and while the film is a bit overlong and the plotline a little under the fresh line, the film pumps on delightfully, and will leave you smiling till the end. B 5/17/14

If someone spoiled it for you, punch them hard as you like. Go ahead. Them 'em I said you could.

Rachel McAdams is adorable. Mr. Gleeson is great in the first role I noticed him (I'm looking at you, Harry Potter). And Bill Nighy was stellar as always.

A young man discovers, at the age of 21, he can travel back in time. He obviously uses this to search for love.

What did I think?

Stupid movie made me cry. And by stupid I mean delightful, intelligent and whimsical.

Richard Curtis (4 Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually, Notting Hill and the Vincent episode of Dr. Who) gives us a simple yet entertaining romantic comedy about time travel. Admittedly its not a common genre combination but it works and delivers some simple messages without getting preachy.

It'll keep you both chuckling and thinking. Not a blockbuster but simply endearing.",1403913600,2,614,4.865384615384615

So many movies these days focus on the negative and even if it's supposed to be a love story they focus on the dark side of life.
This movie is authentically sweet and feels good from beginning to end. Great relationships and inspiring how good life can be if we stop focusing on how bad we think things are. Cynics beware!",1403654400,,420,4.397435897435898

5208746,4,B0090JBAPG,"If you were looking for a dumb chick flick to turn your brain off and look at eye candy, this is not it. It's kind of a complicated storyline that you can get lost fairly quickly. I actually had to re-wind it (is that possible with a streamed movie?) a few times to catch what the actors said to make sure it made sense.  It was serious, funny/hilarious, sometimes tragic, sometimes romantic. The story line is well done and had some really great scenes. IDK, Rachel McAdams (like many actresses) plays the exact same loveable but goofey role, but she of course does that really well. I didn't quite see any flames between her and her beau in the movie, so as far as a love story that makes your insides gooey, this isn't it, on top of the seriousness of the movie. But nonetheless if you branded this is a chickflick it will score well for that genre, but I'd be a little careful with calling it a chick flick because alot of people who hate chick flicks as a rule might enjoy this movie wholeheartedly because it isn't a dumb and doesn't have horrid, predictable plot lines.",1403049600,3,1076,4.407035175879397
5208747,4,B0090JBAPG,It wad really cute.  I was glad it centered more on his whole family rather than just his relationships with women.,1403049600,,115,4.476190476190476

5208749,5,B0090JBAPG,"I really enjoyed this movie. The acting, direction and casting were perfect. It is romantic comedy with an existential twist, along the lines of Groundhog Day.

5208796,5,B0090JBAPG,This is a wonderful romantic comedy that is thought provoking while entertaining.  It is not silly funny but rather the laughter that comes from those funny moments that life produces.  It shows the responsibility of having an extraordinary gift and the consequences of changing outcomes.  Rachel McAdams has the adorable factor and lights up the screen with her smile.  The cast is great and the script well written.  See it soon!,1402876800,,431,5.014084507042254

5208799,5,B0090JBAPG,"Ended up buying it we all loved it so much. It gets better with each viewing. This is a movie that really lets you view life through the lens of someone who gets 'do-overs' sometimes. Makes you think about what would you change if you had the chance?

This is first and foremost a movie about relationships, and I love that. It will make you laugh several times, and probably shed a few tears too. The relationship between the main character and his dad is the prominent one featured, aside from his true love of course.

I love it because the message is really about living your life to the fullest each and every day, reveling in the moment, even the small ones.  Even if you don't get 'do-overs'!",1402876800,,699,4.403100775193798
5208800,5,B0090JBAPG,"Yes, it is another romantic love story, but it also is not. The underlying story is much deeper and thought provoking. Sure, the story was not entirely believable and maybe the limiting of time travel to males was unfair. But why make a beautiful story so complicated? I feel like other reviewers harp too much on those points. This is not reality, it is the movies. To me, I go to the movies to escape, to be touched. The relationship between the young man and his father I believe is the real love story in this movie.  By the end of the movie, you will want to call your family and tell them how much you love them.",1402704000,,618,4.237288135593221

5208802,5,B0090JBAPG,nice movie with cute themes.  fine for the whole family (well not too young on the kids) the female lead (from Wedding Crashers) is quite good in this and the male lead is even better.  two hours well spent.,1402704000,,207,4.282051282051282

5208804,3,B0090JBAPG,"A friend told me about this movie, so I bought it & watched it.  There was more sex in it than I like.  I prefer a good family movie.  I guess it is OK if you like sexy movies.  You can have my copy. I'm not going to watch it again.",1402617600,,232,3.4901960784313726
5208805,5,B0090JBAPG,"It's hard for me once I'm committed to a movie to really think of the negatives, to be fair. What's more I don't usually like time travel movies. I will say that having had a recent illness has made me more than a bit aware of mortality issues and it's important to say that they are here to be dealt with.
Without spoiling things for most people, I'd say that here is an English movie (yes Rachel McAdams is not) without fear of emotional content and portrayal. In a time where we see many movies limited to a young set or an older one, this is definitely not the case. Life is fluid, and experiences are there to be shared among the characters and with the audience of any age, or at least most ages. It isn't a ""teacher of lessons"" in the sense that it isn't moralistic, but it does leave a viewer potentially thinking, and yes I confess learning a thing or two. As important, for me, were the feelings that stayed with me afterwards, that inspired me to reflect on my own life and relationships.
The acting is uniformly wonderful, with Bill Nighy being absolutely wonderful.
One thing I'd add but it's probably obvious, this is not the flick for people who only like cerebraland for people like me, tissues should at least be nearby.",1402617600,,1237,4.4298245614035086

5208859,5,B0090JBAPG,"I love this movie, and it's wonderfully heartwarming!  In addition to featuring a heartwarming story about life, love, and the importance of family, the storyline also features important moral lessons.  I'm particularly pleased that the modest girl beats out the popular girl, and that the overarching message of the movie is to find the beauty in the ordinary.  It's so rare to find modern movies that emphasize tradition, family, and virtue ethics, and I strongly recommend this film to individuals of all ages.

As a new father, I was blown away by the inventiveness and sincerity of this film.  It made me appreciate my wife, my kid and my life even more (which is already a lot).  You expect a fun, Brit romantic comedy, which you get, but this film offers so much more.  Time travel element adds another level of fun to the story, but it really sets up the story of enduring love and affection that the father and son have for one another, their families and life.  My wife and I watched this movie twice, which we've never done.  Cried both times with joy and sadness.

In a current culture that is often far too superficial and self involved, this smart, witty, and sensitive film offers refreshing solace.  What we need most is to give and to recieve love.

5209073,2,B0090JBAPG,"I liked the director as well as the actors in this movie so I decided to give it a rent.  It is definitely not like Curtis's previous feel-good love stories which we all so enjoy (Four Weddings and A Funeral, Notting Hill, Love Actually), and I'd read enough to know that going in, since, well, it's a movie that includes time travel!  But unfortunately to me the time travel aspect of this movie ended up feeling like less the message it seemed to want to convey (live in the moment, tenderly and enthusiastically), and more creepy to me.  I'll try to not use specifics so I don't spoil anything.

Our hero, Tim Lake, basically has godlike powers you find out early on, wherein he can go back in time.  Interesting, imagine what he could do with such powers - expectations were thus high early on, and the humor was great at first too.  And then you see quickly how every time the guy acts at all, well, like himself (naturally kind but awkward), and lets life happen, he feels like he could have done better and goes back and changes it.  At first it is funny and kind of ""cute.""  But pretty soon it starts to feel creepy.

Lake knows he can change the outcome of everything (with a couple limits) so in the absolute pursuit of companionship he basically stalks a couple women, then eliminates their free will by manipulating situations as he sees fit, though he doesn't necessarily always ""take advantage"" of them: with the first woman he does this with, the conclusion he comes to is interesting as things don't work out.  But then he sleeps with one person multiple times in a row in a single night by going back in time repeatedly, which quite frankly felt a bit misogynistic, which I'm sure Curtis did not intend, but it felt how it felt to me.

My skin crawled a bit at times throughout this movie.  I was NOT expecting that when I first started this movie.  I had an open mind going in, and expected an interesting love story, but not one where it feels like the girl is manipulated and controlled the entire time, and has no free will with the broad strokes of her life.

Frankly this could easily be a psychological-thriller movie: if Timmy doesn't like the girl's response, he just goes back in time and tinkers with a few things and comes back, and repeats until she does what he wants, says what he wants, and he is satisfied.

This movie does have its genuinely funny, light-hearted, and also deep moments.  Death and alcoholism are touched upon well with regard to the time travel aspect.  Bill Nighy plays his part as Tim's father well.  But unfortunately for me at least, once Lake has completed his conquest and has a family, then the movie slows way down and is frankly a bit disappointingly-boring to me by the end.  His family were all likeable, but it was for me too easy to see them as characters that have all been done over and over and over.

There were some very funny moments in the movie with the time travel, for instance when McAdams's character's parents arrive and he says something stupid, and other times where it was quite funny in the same way.  If the movie had ended with the guy going clear back to the beginning and letting fate happen by being himself naturally and letting others be themselves naturally (maybe having his character and McAdams's meet anyway), maybe that would've saved it for me.  But instead it seems like everyone who loves this movie is just fine with the fact a guy manipulated everyone in his life to get where and what he wanted, but because he seems like a jolly good fellow it's okay.

Bottom-line: I was really excited to watch this movie, but after seeing it I wish I hadn't.  It was funny at first, then creepy, with random bits of gentleness to keep people from being too creeped out, I guess, which I guess worked for many viewers.  Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but there is no one I know that I would recommend seeing this movie to.

I hope Curtis sticks to his proven happy stuff, with great dialogue, ensemble casts, generally nice scenery, and love prevailing freely.",1401062400,4,4052,4.501366120218579

5209119,4,B0090JBAPG,"There may be spoilers.

Romantic comedies are a dime a dozen to use an old clich, but finding a good one is pretty rare.  I finally got around to seeing this little gem from Richard Curtis who directed one of my favorite films of any genre, ""Love Actually.""  Domhnall Gleeson, (soon to appear in the new Star Wars film) stars as Tim who lives in Cornwall with his dad (Bill Nighy), mother (Lindsay Duncan) and sister, Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson).

Upon his 21st birthday, Dad tells Tim that he has inherited special powers that the men in his family have.  If he goes into a dark room, closes his eyes and clinches his fists he can travel back in time to any point and place within his lifetime.  It's a secret of course and Tim tends to use the power wisely.  There's no time machine involved, so the film is more fantasy than science fiction.  And there are other ""buts"" involved, but I'm not sure I ever caught on to what some of the forbidden tricks were.  No matter.

Tim is still searching for his true love when he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and falls hard.  After a couple tries, he makes the right impression and they get married have kids and live almost happily ever after.  The film stays away from traditional falling in love scenes, but just plays out the couple's lives like most of us.  And by that I mean death enters the picture, and sibling problems and how to not forget the friends in your life.

The movie isn't perfect.  For one thing, it's too long.  Perhaps Curtis could have cut back on one or two of Tim's do-overs.  You have to love the many one on ones scenes with Tim and the people in his life, but those with McAdams and Nighy are priceless.

The Blu ray comes in a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The video is near perfection with excellent skintones and black levels.  Colors are muted a bit but seem perfect for this film.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is equally excellent.  The dialog is clear and easily understood.  The surroundings are effectively displayed although the surrounds don't usually come into play.  Some of the party scenes will bring them into action.  A modest but realistic soundfield.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Here are the extras:

He teaches him how to do it, and he initially goes back to find a better way to talk to the woman he met.

It explored the many facets of family relationships, father-son, parents-children, husband-wife, and immediate-extended family.  The movie does this by utilizing a clever plot involving time travel which keeps the viewer anticipating through out the movie.  It's also a movie about how to live one's life.

I am also a sucker for a good love story but it's actually not as focused on it as I thought it would be. Somewhere along the way the plot shifts focus and I must admit I did cry.

5209405,4,B0090JBAPG,"I enjoyed ""About Time"" and thought the film was very clever. I know the so-called ""plot holes"" and the films breakage of the ""time traveling rules"" henceforth setup early on by Tim's father may have appeared to of been violated in the latter half of the film, but aside from these extremely minor inconsistencies the film remains true to its core. However, that said, the two confusing issues worth mentioning are Tim's sister's ability to time travel when his father clearly indicates, ""Only male members of the family can do so"" and the film also left me wondering about those stuck in the future. For example Tim is able to travel back in time and change the past which ultimately affects the future, but what about those permanently stuck in the future? How can a future that's already been written be rewritten since other people don't have the ability to travel back in time with him? As a science fiction fan with the rules ever so slightly vague it kept me wondering about what could and could not happen (though not necessarily a bad thing). I don't know what Woody Allen would think of this picture but to a certain extent it does remind me of his ""Midnight in Paris"" particularly with the characters ability to go back in time. Some of the techniques employed such as scene repeatage made this film very ""Dr. Who"" and ""Groundhog Day"" `esque and will give watchers a sense of dj vu. Obviously Rachel McAdams is a very talented actress and while the story/screenplay isn't forcefully committed to an exact direction or brilliantly written by any means her acting is what holds this film together. The picture is filled with plenty of good one liners. I enjoyed the scene where Tim announces he's getting married. His fianc (McAdams) is seated across the table and his uncle abruptly says ""To who""? Tim then announces the wedding will come quick because they are having a baby and the uncle asks the fianc, ""Who is the father""? Very funny stuff! I liked the overall simplicity of this sci-fi romance comedy and while it's no ""Midnight in Paris"" it's certainly worth a view. (3/4 Stars).",1399248000,,2094,4.708446866485014

Its movements are deliberate, you grow with the main character as he learns more about the special gift of time travel that he has been given, and what it means in his life.  Do overs are great, don't we all wish that we could fix disasters in our lives, or those in our friends?  There is little heart burn in this movie, which for a change in movie watching is nice.  Some reviewers have called it boring.  Characters have been created that you can invest yourself in, if you are willing.  Its a story that you will think about think about.

5209454,5,B0090JBAPG,"Domhnall Gleeson is Tim, a kind but unsure, stammering sort of fellow. On his 21st birthday, his father  a fellow time traveler played by the essential Bill Nighy, all ropey and Britishy-Zen  breaks the news of their peculiar ability to move backward  but never forward  in time. The family is rounded out by a sensible, unsentimental mom (Duncan) and a whirling dervish of a sister (Wilson), who shows tiny fracture lines that portend some future breakage. Rachel McAdams plays the American who turns Tims knees to jelly, and with good reason: Shes like star bright, with bangs. The movie moves episodically, leisurely, through roughly a decade, and that feels like a gift: to nestle in with these extraordinary, ordinary people and get to know them.
As a writer and sometime director, Richard Curtis has made a career of strong-arming audiences into cuddles (Notting Hill, Love Actually). About Time, so full of compassion and care with handling, is something different  a kind of benevolence. I walked out of the movie wanting to fall in love, hug a small child, call my parents, and take back the half-dozen thoughtless things Id said that day. I worried I was going soft, so I saw it again. Afterward, somewhere between a sniffle and a beam, I reached for my phone. And if Id seen a small child, I probably wouldve lunged at it, too.

I do think that Rachel McAdams is an attractive lead and Domhnal Gleeson plays the lucky, great, goofy guy.  I liked the theme"" What would you do differently if you could have experience do-overs"".  The movie is heart warming and thought provoking.  I think that I should be more relational, especially to those that are close to me.  I hope others enjoy it as much as I did.",1398729600,,471,4.4186046511627906

Starts out pretty much as you would expect, but finds its way into a very wonderfully done story about fathers and sons, and what it means to grow up and pass the torch.  Cant recommend this enough.  If you are a dude, you will like it.  If you watch it with a lady, she will like it.  I rented it, then immediately went online to ship my dad a copy.",1398729600,,443,3.9886363636363638

The wife really wanted to see this so we got it. I groaned a bit (inside only of course) and poured myself a gin n tonic. Yet within 30 minutes of this flick, i'm laughing and really enjoying myself! (no the drink wasn't that strong) I look over and clearly my wife is feeling the same. This was a movie that we could both enjoy and had enough funny moments that it kept me laughing.

We tend to watch a lot of movies and this is one of the only ones in the past few months where I can honestly say we both enjoyed movie night to its fullest. It is no die hard but it'll do, it'll do.",1398556800,,649,3.909090909090909

5209610,5,B0090JBAPG,"Obviously, when dealing with any movie based around time travel, you have to ""just go with it."" Yes at times the story, mostly the time travel bits, made me kind of roll my eyes. That being said, this is a wonderful movie with a wonderful message behind it. It's not your average sappy love story, this is really a movie about embracing what little time we are given. It had me laughing and crying sometimes at the same time. The lead is no Ryan Gosling, which is a hard act to follow when being paired up with Rachel McAdams, but I think their choice was perfect. He was awkward and endearing, which made it feel more real and relatable. I loved this movie, it became an instant favorite.",1398297600,2,689,4.390625

5209613,5,B0090JBAPG,"You think it's just going to be another romantic comedy, but it's so much more. First it wins you over with being a great film in itself, great feel, unique setting that's not in New York like every other romantic comedy (yes I know it was made by the English), hilarious, all around great atmosphere about it.

But then as it you pass the half-way point it starts to show a picture much bigger than any other romantic comedy, tackling the concept of life and living it to its fullest like FEW other films do. By the end of the movie, I was just awestruck. The film had so many redeeming qualities and accomplished so much, it just leaves the viewer with more than they bargained for, in a totally positive way.

I definitely recommending purchasing this DVD, even if you haven't seen it; and if you still have qualms, watch it on a ""third party"" site then buy it here. I don't buy many DVD's, so the fact that this one's made it into my collection means it'll be watched every couple years for decades to come.

So there you have it-ROMANCE, TIME TRAVEL, and LIVING every single moment of this unbelievable LIFE to its fullest, all wrapped into one astonishing film. Worth the $15? Hell yea.",1398211200,6,1192,4.458715596330276

He uses this superpower to fall in love (agreeably not the worst thing you could do with the power).  At one point he takes his sister back with him (showing people could travel with him).  However, that is all he does with his gift.  What a waste of an opportunity.  Hence the haunting of my dreams!  He could have fell in love with his wife and then spent a 100 lifetimes going back with her, winning the lottery, going to medical school, curing cancer and the like, traveling the world... but he just fell in love.

This film was sweet (not cloying, just sweet, and lovely and full of kindness); Bill Nighy was wonderful in it, as were all of the leads. It was exactly the film I was looking for.

5209764,3,B0090JBAPG,"I really wanted to like this movie from Richard Curtis and was looking forward to a light hearted romcom flick from a good cast. His other movies used the same format successfully (Four Weddings, Notting Hill, Love Actually) but this one had a mechanical and duplicated feel to it with nothing new to offer. First off, the lead actor replicated Hugh Grant's bumbling Brit to perfection which lacked originality (kept expecting Grant to pop in for a cameo at any moment). The plot was tediously predictable with the requisite sensible American girl, eccentric wealthy family, London nightlife, weird friends, etc but it didn't seem to go anywhere and was at loose ends. Perhaps it was the not believable gift the lead character possessed in being able to go back in time for a do-over, an ability most of us would like to have.

It's not a bad film but guess I had high expectations as I generally enjoy British movies. This film may appeal to those who never saw the above mentioned movies and will be delighted with this type of bumbling Brit meets girl story.",1397520000,2,1061,4.704301075268817

The main characters are engaging enough, although the peripheral players are skimmed over, and the plot skips along smoothly and with out too much retrospection. The fun comes from seeing how life could be improved upon if you were able to have unlimited ""do-overs"" often with unexpected (and sometimes unwanted) consequences.

5209817,5,B0090JBAPG,Great movie for those who like softer and thought provoking movies.  Beautiful message.  Great love story and family story.  We so enjoy English movies because they are so much less violent.  Highly recommend this.,1397347200,,214,5.205882352941177

5209820,5,B0090JBAPG,"This is a beautiful love story about romance and family. I'd recommend it as a ""chick flick"" great for a girl's night but think it's suitable for most audiences.",1397347200,,161,4.586206896551724
5209821,5,B0090JBAPG,Great feel good Movie!  I love this actress and also loved the movie Love Actually which is similar in style.,1397347200,,109,4.45
5209822,4,B0090JBAPG,"Watching ""About Time"" I recalled in my memory banks the recently deceased director Harold Ramis' ""Groundhog Day"" which was about a Pittsburgh weatherman forced to live the same day over and over again until he gets it right.  This film is not on par with ""Groundhog Day"" because it lacks irony and that film's acute observations about love and life.  If I were to nutshell this film it would be ""Groundhog Day"" by way of Nicholas Sparks.  Not to be misunderstood I like this film.  Its stars, Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson, are appealing and nice.  Any film with Bill Nighy in the cast can't be all bad.  If the worst I can say about a movie is it's sweet and nice then the makers of ""About Time"" are ahead of the game.",1397347200,2,725,4.413533834586466
5209823,4,B0090JBAPG,"I honestly rented this movie because I was in the mood for a predictable sappy chick flick, but About Time surprised me with it's interesting, believable characters in an unrealistic situation. I was hooked until the end to see how it would play out. Cute and creative.",1397347200,,269,4.74468085106383
5209824,4,B0090JBAPG,"I always love watching Rachel McAdams ....She is just so adorable. It was not Citizen Kane but it was a sweet, silly, romantic little movie that left me with a smile.",1397347200,,166,4.387096774193548

""Bob, the definition of chick flick is 'Torture for Male Minds.' That's impossible.""
""Nonsense. We'll add time travel.""
""Genius!""

And so it was. I greatly enjoyed this movie. You obviously want to watch it since you're here. Are you a guy and ashamed to watch it alone? Me too, and I watched it alone. So therefore, you're not alone. Isn't logic wonderful?",1397260800,2,406,4.71830985915493

5209848,5,B0090JBAPG,"Yeah its a bit fluffy but I found it completely entertaining. I can watch nearly anything with Bill Nighy and he was in great form as the father. If you are in the mood for a fun, uplifting movie this is a solid pick.",1397260800,,217,3.9545454545454546
5209849,5,B0090JBAPG,"Didn't think i would enjoy this movie, but wife wanted to see it.  We both watched and both of us thought it was well done, a little eccentric (but in an interesting way), and we were sorry when it ended, but at least it was a happy ending.  Very enjoyable",1397260800,,256,4.1
5209850,4,B0090JBAPG,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie.  All of the trailers made this out to be a story about a guy just trying to get a girl.  It was that, but there was a lot more to the story overall that wasn't about their relationship...and that made the movie great.",1397260800,,265,4.176470588235294
5209851,5,B0090JBAPG,"I almost didn't bother watching this movie because the trailers were selling it as just another garden variety chick flick, but I love the main actor and didn't think Bill Nighy would have agreed to be in something terrible, so I gave it a shot.

I'm so glad I did. It's not at all like what I thought. There are elements of romance, of course, but there's so much else going on. It's not about the boy getting the girl, it's about getting her, keeping her and making the most out of the life you have with her. It's about family and loss and consequences of good intentions. I just love it. Love Actually is one of my favorite movies of all time and I think this tops it.",1397260800,,672,4.209302325581396

A bit of sexual content and ""language"" but not overwhelming.  Unique characters, realistic dialogue, and touching moments.  Very entertaining.",1397088000,,301,5.644444444444445
5209859,5,B0090JBAPG,"This is a delightful movie.  I was familiar with most of the cast members except one, Lydia Wilson, who was precious as the kinky sister KitKat..

5209861,4,B0090JBAPG,"ABOUT TIME is a fantasy-comedy where a subject we often wonder about becomes reality for its protagonist. What if we could go back in time and redo our bad decisions, erase every faux pas, remove all our foots-in-mouth, etc?

Though quietly funny and entertaining, the first half-hour or so meanders a bit, but things pick up, and the last half-hour is powerfully moving. ABOUT TIME is seldom just laugh-out-loud funny; however, there is a quietly whimsical humor throughout. Good acting by Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, as well as by everyone else, but the best of all comes from Bill Nighy as Tim's dad, a truly memorable character. The cinematography is also excellent, with some fine views of the Cornwall, England, coast. Great script and great soundtrack too. Despite the fantastic elements, this is a film about real people that, like many British productions, moves at the speed of life. Therefore, people who want a lot of excitement and explosive action may be a little bored with it.",1397088000,2,989,4.922155688622754

I didn't get the Uncle, the sister was a mess, the story line was slow - at the very end, I enjoyed the 'I'll enjoy everyday of my normal boring life...""

Embarrassing roles played in a charmless way by the British crme de crme.

There are Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander who are themselves : devoid of any humor.

Apart from Rachel Adams who shows some good acting the rest of the troupe go through the motions as if they are reading the script before them.

My toilet seat has more charisma than the lead guy Domhnall Gleeson.

More than the plot holes the raunchy vulgarity takes out any sense of a romantic comedy.",1396656000,2,634,4.431034482758621

I just cannot say enough good things about this film, it is the best I have seen in years. It is in my top all time favorite films.
It paints such a beautiful picture of life; even with things not always going right. Life is just it's own beautiful disaster. The film kind of reminds me of that quote, ""It's not about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.""

I saw it with a friend (their idea) on video and all I can say is they should fire whoever created the trailer. Yes, the movie has plenty of laughs, but it's not just a comedy and it's definitely not predictable. It's a touching story about a young man who has a limited ability to time travel. Yes, he uses it to his personal benefit some, but also for those he loves and he learns that there are limits to what you can do for those you love.

You may want to keep a box of tissues handy.  For me to watch a movie that brings tears to my eyes more than once (or to even finish it the first time for that matter), it must be good...and this one is!  It has a touch of science fiction, likeable characters, and a (mostly) believable story line.  If the main character isn't particularly handsome or well-known, he's very human and conveys that well through his acting.  Bill Nighy, just for the record, does a fantastic job and is completely believable as the dad.  This is a great story about life and life's choices.",1396569600,2,808,4.702127659574468

The movie is hilarious and touching, both a love story, and interminably, a beautiful story about father and sons and family, dealing with loss, and time- that precious commodity of which, we never have enough.  Is it perfect?  No (I mean who cares about carrie moss... watch it and you'll know what I mean), but is such a beautifully told story that it merits 5 stars from me.  The relationship between Tim and his father (who is magnificent), is one of the most heartfelt I have ever seen put on screen.

The premise works so well, that I am so surprised that it did.  One of the best films of 2013 in my opinion, and an absolute heartfelt gem.",1396224000,,793,4.390410958904109

5210096,5,B0090JBAPG,"Rarely do you find a movie that grabs you where you are in life and brings you to where you need to be.

This movie connects with the part of all of us that wishes we could travel back in time.  Sometimes for a few minutes. Sometimes for almost an entire lifetime.

From there it gradually shows us that even with the complete capability to travel back at will, the best life is one that simply captures each and every priceless minute.  It shows us how life's moments - both good and bad, are so unbelievably precious that we need to notice them, feel them and not wish them away.

Rachel McAdams and the rest of the cast aren't acting.  They have so completely merged with the storyline that they are actually living the script.  It is a warm and endearing story that inspires us to experience life to the fullest.

I love it when a movie can change my whole perspective on life for the better.

Well done to the entire cast and crew!

5210101,5,B0090JBAPG,"If it hadn't been for but a few choices on a long and boring flight, I would not have gone out of my way to watch this movie. I am glad I did, however, and since a second viewing, I value it even more than the first. I would not consider this to be a chic flic, just a thoughtful movie. The precedent of the main character having the ability to travel in time seems absurd, yet it is simply a a piece of the setting; background no more different than accepting any other historical or fictitious element. It is not science fiction, merely a thoughtful concept meant to convey an idea. This movie is thoughtful and touching and endearing. A true gem that seems out of place in an age of sensationalistic special effects and shock humor. And yet it is not as overly dramatic as the overly hyped ""the notebook"".

5210136,5,B0090JBAPG,"Being a huge fan of Love Actually, Bridget Jones Diary and Notting Hill, I was expecting a sweet, romantic comedy.  This movie is soooo much more than that, and you will be pleasantly surprised!

First, I have to say that I think that writer and producer Richard Curtis is an absolute genius.  While his romantic comedies have the usual wide appeal and are predictably funny, they also have a depth and message not readily found in the genre.  The characters in his movies have an ""everyman"" appeal.  Well defined, intricate, relatable people that are endearing both in their strengths, and in their weaknesses....and the characters in this movie are no exception.

While the beginning theme....an average looking British man trying to find love, is not that unusual, the story quickly turns to reveal a family ""gift"" that is bestowed on the male members of the unusual family.  The main character begins using this ""gift"" to try and get the girl, but through a maze of events and endearing characters, learns the real, enduring lesson contained in the gift.

Sweet, poignant, funny and endearing...you will laugh, you will cry, and you will question.  What more could you want in a movie?",1395705600,,1189,4.905

5210138,5,B0090JBAPG,"I loved this movie!  I was not sure what to expect at first.  I love time travel premises, but this seemed more like a standard chick flick at first: awkward boy meets amazing girl and has to figure out how to make her fall in love with him.  But there's so much more to this story!  How would you like a do-over for your most awkward, foot-in-the-mouth moments?  Our hero gets just that due to a ""family secret"" he discovers at the start of the movie.  How to apply and live with the consequences of this family secret is the journey you make with our hero.  Set in Cornwall England, the countryside is just beautiful and this family and its secret draws you in and you truly care about them and their choices in life.  Ultimately, this movie is about living life genuinely and enjoying the people around you each and every moment you have with them.  My teenaged kids loved this movie as well, but I would not recommend it for those under 15, as there are a few scenes of a sexual nature and some infrequent profanity.",1395705600,,1020,4.354497354497354

Domhnall Gleeson does a good job of taking over the male lead from Hugh grant and Rachel McAdams is great as his lover. She proves to be a very good comic actress. Bill Nighy is great as Domhnall'[s father. The movie is both hysterical and sad at times and  leaves you with a moral about life and love.,1395619200,,434,4.228915662650603

5210223,5,B0090JBAPG,"So, the other night while snuggling up on the couch with my wife and my eight month old son watching About Time I found myself looking down at him and wishing upon all wishes that I could have the same conversation with him that Bill Nighy gets to have with Domhnall Gleeson in this movie.  I mean, how cool would it be to be able to your son down when he is 21 and just completely blow his mind.

By the way son, you come from a family of time travelers and its about time you start getting things right.

So, Im staring at him staring up at me and Im going over in my head how cool this scenario would be, were it actually possible, and then we reach some pinnacle moments in the film and Im again staring down at him and feeling incredibly happy and relieved that well never have this conversation and that the conversations were going to have are going to mean so much more because of that very fact.

By the way son, you only get to live your life once, so lets embrace it for what it is; hiccups and all.

A few months ago my wife and I were at the theater, I think it was to see Enough Said, when we first saw the trailer for this film.  Its hard to describe the feeling you get when you just know something is going to be special.  I have that feeling every once in a while when Im watching a film trailer.  It doesnt always pan out (I had a similar feeling while watching the trailer for The Spectacular Now), but when it does it really is, well, special.  I remember looking over at my wife and she was smiling and she leans in and whispers we need to see that and I always like when she does that because shes rarely excited about movies in general, and so its nice when we can both connect on that level.  Sadly, children block us from getting to the theater often and so we had to wait.

The wait was worth it.

Its also quite funny that it was while waiting to see Enough Said that my wife and I first heard of this movie, because for me those two films are probably the best relationship films I saw this year, both of them separated by a certain demographic and yet connected in the pure honest and delightful way in which they develop and portray the relationships we see on screen.  While many will focus on the gimmick of time travel here, Im so happy to say that the film does NOT focus on that gimmick.

We don't know how or why they time travel, and quite frankly, I don't care.

The film tells the story of Tim, a socially awkward young man who, one New Years Eve, is given the thrill of his life.  His father sits him down and confesses to him that he has a gift.  In fact, every male in their family has this gift, the gift of time travel.  They can enter a dark place, clench their fists and focus on a moment in time that they personally lived through and BAM, they are there and can relive it and change it even.  Of course, with this ability comes responsibility and consequence, but with it also comes some pretty incredible opportunities and advantages.

Love, marriage and a baby carriage.

But About Time is about so much more than finding love or fixing your mistakes or perfecting yourself.  At the heart of About Time is a beautiful story about just that, spending time.  While Tims instinct is to make money or find romance, his fathers approach to the whole thing is far more relaxed and laid back.  In time, Tim uncovers why, and with that knowledge his time travel takes on a much deeper meaning.

Im just going to say it; this movie made me cry SO MUCH.  That walk on the beach DESTROYED ME.  There is nothing in the world that I wouldnt give to live those moments every single day, but the reality of life is that it is impossible to do that.  The beauty of this film is that it highlights those moments and the ability we have to appreciate them to the full, if we try.",1395360000,5,3812,4.184931506849315

5210342,5,B0090JBAPG,"This brilliant and lovely movie, written and directed by Richard Curtis (""Pirate Radio, ""Love Actually""), was quite a surprise to me.  I thought it would be a Romantic Comedy without really reading anything about it prior to viewing it.  It does have romance in it and the same with comedy - although not altogether, this has a really original concept behind it.  Kind of, if you only had one day left to live, how would you spend it?  This is not the theme of the movie at all, it was how I was viewing it after about the first fifteen minutes to half an hour.  What, or better said, who are the important people and situations that you should be indulging with your time?

I found that the mundane things in life started to look much less mundane but maybe taken for  granted; what we say, think, spend our time doing, where we go.  This movie got to the emotions in me while touching my heart and made me appreciate the life I have and why.  And, for me, a must own for my viewing library.  The scenery (John Guleserian) of England was gorgeous and popped right off the screen added along with a sweet soundtrack (Nick Laird-Clowes) with its heart-tugging songs just brought tears to my eyes at times.  I am never disappointed with the soundtracks chosen by Richard Curtis. This also gives more atmosphere to the people-oriented and uncomplicated story.  I found the more I went over the 'hows' and 'what ifs' of the story was merely myself trying to make it complicated, and took away from the touching ride which it really is.

Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) in a quite unconventional way and immediately she is the love of his lifetime.  As simple as that really.  His father (Bill Nighy) lets him know a bit previous to this that he has a special and unusual ability which encounters the men in the family.  He can use this for good or for complicating everything, he tries both before he is comfortable with the direction which he chooses.  To say anything more is really too much.  This movie is such a delightful treat and a new spin on the romantic comedy that I haven't met yet. One can easily see that this one is from the heart.

""And in the end I think I've learned the final lesson from my travels in time; and I've even gone one step further than my father did: The truth is that I don't travel back at all, not even for the day ..."". As Tim expresses these thoughts aloud, his life is on course for the happiness that came through all he has experienced.

I bought it on dvd and watched it, and thought it was a really good movie and shows how much being able to travel in time can be a good thing but also a bad thing.",1394928000,,320,3.9384615384615387
5210403,5,B0090JBAPG,This movie was everything I was hoping it could be an more.  The story was touching.  It's a must buy for our collection.,1394928000,,121,4.217391304347826

5210407,5,B0090JBAPG,Unexpected moving. Must watch until the end to really appreciate the film! It packs a profound emotional ouch especially for a guy. Not a chick flick although the poster doesn't do it justice,1394928000,,191,4.818181818181818

5210410,4,B0090JBAPG,Time travel is tricky - but this movie handles it well.  It is really a lesson in life and will touch your heart. A great movie for young and old.,1394928000,,146,3.8666666666666667
5210411,4,B0090JBAPG,"I did not have high hopes for this to be anything more than time filler on a free night and was very pleasantly surprised.  The writing allowed the time travel itself to have a genuine, appreciated role in the movie, rather than serving as a cheap vehicle for laughs as I originally feared.  This movie is not without laughs but it is also not the comedy that it was marketed to be.  What it is in fact, is a very touching drama about the value of the limited time we are given in life and more so, the limited time we have with the ones we love.  Great movie, highlighted by the performances of Bill Nighy and Domnall Gleeson.",1394928000,,627,4.243697478991597

5210436,5,B0090JBAPG,"I have always been a fan of Mr Curtis' writing, and yet again he doesn't disappoint.  A stellar cast also helps.  But the material is good enough to attract great actors. Bill Nighy is simply marvellous (as always). The screenplay is pithy, witty, endearing and also profoundly philosophical in outlook.  I will be watching this again - soon!",1394841600,,342,4.862068965517241
5210437,5,B0090JBAPG,"Completely wonderful, lovable, adorable.  Happy movie.  Acting is good.  Love and romance, so may be more of a chick flick.  In my opinion, a 5-star.  I'll rent it again!",1394841600,,170,4.724137931034483

Like most movies, you have to suspend disbelief, but it is a very good story about life, and how we spend our time and our lives...My girlfriend took me to it...and I admit I was thinking ""chick flick"", but was happily surprised about the way the story was told. GOOD movie!",1394841600,,301,4.298245614035087

5210442,5,B0090JBAPG,Movie was great. Kept you engaged the entire time. If you have a family and like them slightly this will really hit home. I'd watch it over and over again.,1394841600,,155,4.2
5210443,5,B0090JBAPG,This is a great love story not just for couples but for families!!! Just enough magic to make you sit up on the edge of your seat. Thought provoking. Humorous! Believable! My husband and I loved it!,1394755200,,198,4.378378378378378
5210444,5,B0090JBAPG,"This movie was recommended to me by a friend and I really didn't think much about it just from the trailer about another time traveling movie. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it, the movie was soo sweet and it makes you feel good after watching it. The writing is excellent and the actors were all great with a bunch of funny scenes. I recommend it to anyone looking for a movie about family and expects a happy ending.",1394755200,,425,4.2592592592592595
5210445,5,B0090JBAPG,Great video. Agood movie and a comedy too.  The video is excellent and very hilarious. But it was not what i was expecting,1394755200,,122,4.304347826086956
5210446,5,B0090JBAPG,"I was skeptical about watching this because I kept cringing waiting for the inevitable and irreversible disaster to happen, but it never did.  Very funny, enjoyable and seemed almost believable- not crazy or over the top at all.",1394668800,,228,5.0
5210447,5,B0090JBAPG,"About Time is one of the most heart-warming and most meaningful stories I've ever seen played out on screen. While some viewers complained about pace, the movie is literally About Time. Anything other pace would have been just terribly wrong. I get bored really easily and had zero qualms here. I also love Rachel McAdams and think she did a great job. I admire how picky she is about the roles she chooses, including this one which saw a limited release nationwide. While I found the story between her and Domnhall Gleeson to be wonderful (and am really excited to see more of him in the future), I found the true magic of this film was found in the relationship between characters played by Gleeson and Bill Nighy, his father. There are some truly powerful scenes between the two that will hit you right in the feels. This is a movie I could watch over and over again, easily.",1394668800,,878,4.528301886792453
5210448,4,B0090JBAPG,"I was expecting another funny, romantic movie from the makers of Notting Hill and Love Actually but this was different.  It had funny moments but I would say it was mostly a drama, rather than a romantic comedy.  It was more about the main character's life as he learns how to handle his ""gift"" rather than a love story. This one's much more of a thought-provoking tear-jerker than what I was expecting.  Still very good, though.  Rachel McAdams is perfect, as always.  And I never heard of the actor who plays the main character but I quickly fell in love with him; he's wonderful.",1394668800,,582,4.5576923076923075
5210449,5,B0090JBAPG,I don't know if it was the trailer or what but I had no desire to see this movie.  Until I heard someone mention that it really made them think...so I gave it a try.  All I can say is WOW....and get yourself a box of Kleenex.  This is a fantastic movie that makes you think....what would you do if you had to suffer the consequences of a re-do?  This will permanently be on my playlist.  Absolutely loved it.,1394668800,2,408,4.113924050632911
5210450,1,B0090JBAPG,"very slow movie expected much more  rent it or wait till it comes out on Netflix not worth purchasing

5210451,5,B0090JBAPG,"My wife picked this movie up and I was skeptical. However, being a bit of a science fiction lover this movie held some appeal for me. I also think a lot about what makes life meaningful for us and what sorts of things might be adequate uses of our limited time in life. I don't hold this movie as a gospel for any of this but it was both entertaining and thought provoking watching from this perspective. I personally found the love story to be overly ideal but my wife probably enjoyed it more for that. It was a winner for both of us. 5 stars for provoking me to deeper thought and providing a couple of quality hours of entertainment to boot.",1394668800,,645,4.252032520325203

5210453,4,B0090JBAPG,Cute movie.  There is bad language and some nudity.  The story line is good.  I like sic-fi. The premise of going back in time to change outcomes was very appealing to me.  The character saw that changing bits and pieces of your life can have major changes in everyone else's life.,1394582400,,281,4.450980392156863
5210454,5,B0090JBAPG,It is a long movie but it keeps surprising you! Teaches you about the importance of family support and faithful love.,1394582400,,117,4.619047619047619

5210456,5,B0090JBAPG,I thought this movie might be fluffy but the message that it had was beautiful and had me in tears by the end. What an amazing representation of a solid families and how loving parents help produce more loving parents. Reminds me so much of my own dad and my husband. Not sure why it was R rated though. That really threw me off.,1394582400,,329,4.15625
5210457,3,B0090JBAPG,"I really wanted to love ""About Time."" I enjoyed ""Love Actually,"" and found the premise of ""About Time"" promising.  Bill Nighy and Rachel McAdams are wonderful actors. In fact, the excellent acting is the reason I am giving  this 3 stars instead of 2.  Don't get me wrong:  the ocean-side setting is breathtaking, the accents are charming, and for the most part the character development works well. The only problem is the arc of the story, because there barely is one.  The ability of the main character to go back in time to correct his mistakes eliminates nearly all possible tension for the main character, thereby eliminating the sense of obstacles met, struggled with, and overcome (or not), that a good story requires. Even the harsh lesson of the inevitability of death is sweetly softened. The unreal magical quality of this story is truly charming, but it works too well for too long. The result is quite amiable, but also rather flat.",1394582400,,945,4.808641975308642

5210460,5,B0090JBAPG,Rachel McAdams is in yet another time travel love story where she doesn't get to time travel. Still a good plot and in some ways a better movie than Time Traveler's Wife. The characters were more interesting.,1394582400,,208,4.648648648648648

5210462,4,B0090JBAPG,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and it stuck with me ever since. It's not your typical ""chick flick"" because there are much deeper themes that are present, and it actually for once feels like a real representation of a relationship. The dialogue is witty and memorable, and the relationships, including the one with Tim and his father, are heartfelt and sweet. I'm happy to say that I own a great movie, and it is definitely a must-see!! I even mailed my copy recently to my sister on the West coast recently, just so she could watch it. She loved it as well!!",1394582400,,584,4.36697247706422

5210485,5,B0090JBAPG,"This is an interesting tale of Love, only with a twist, He has the power to time travel. I saw this in the movies and fell in love with the story and how well it was written. For me, its one of the stand out movies of 2013. One of my top 5 movies of 2013 which happen to include Frozen and Thor: The Dark World.",1394582400,,311,3.727272727272727
5210486,3,B0090JBAPG,"Richard Curtis' movies are always clever. This is the least interesting of his movies that I have seen. ""About Time"" is little more than a series of sketches or skits. Domhnall Gleeson, who plays the lead, Tim, shows little range to his acting. The same can be said for Bill Nighy. However, Rachel McAdams brings refreshing bursts of energy to the part of the girl next door, Mary.

Time travel is not so much explored as used as an easy plot device. ""About Time"" is unlike the highly successful ""Groundhog Day,"" in which the same day is lived over and over until Bill Murray's character learns from his mistakes and grows over time. The characters in ""About Time"" merely relive episodes from their lives, as Tim seeks the best outcome from his time traveling. By the time Tim's sister time-travels with him, undercutting the main premise that only the men in the family have the ability to time-travel, the film has grown so tiresomely repetitive that it hardly seems to matter.",1394496000,,979,4.7251461988304095

I was literally so bored with this movie that if I hadn't paid for it, I would have stopped watching, and I'm one to almost always finish something I've started. This is nothing like the Time Travelers Wife, which I loved, made me laugh and cry. Time Travel in fact was hardly used in this movie, and when it was, the premise was unbelievable, and the method lacking. The plot itself had a few twists, but none of them exciting. Never was there a cliff-hanger moment, even when they happened, the movie just flat-lined, never having built up the suspense needed to make me even care. I'm honestly a movie junkie, and love most of them. It's not often a movie leaves me this disappointed.",1394496000,6,782,4.475524475524476

5210531,3,B0090JBAPG,"Rachel McAdams is one of those stars who infectiously makes a film a touch more happy.  And time travel is one great feature.  But in this one her boyfriend-husband-time traveler remains an adolescent.  And her haircut stays the same throughout the film.

There are so many strangenesses in this film. Like the men can time travel by clenching their fists in the dark.  But not the women.  But then, late in the movie, the male lead takes his sister on a time trip with him so she can see her would be boyfriend cheating away back in the past.

Yet to the very end he has to go hide from Rachel when he time travels.  OK.  So Sis is closer than his wife.  Well she's more interesting and her hair changes.

And the time travel involved is kind of lame and poorly described.  It seems this movie tried to piggyback on the success of A Time Traveler's Wife and The Notebook and failed to achieve either.

I found the movie to be a big bore.",1394150400,2,393,4.2

Prior to watching I thought this was going to be a clone of the movie Butterfly Effect, which I liked a lot, or Butterfly Effect 2 (which was a poor sequel) but I was pleasantly surprised after watching.  Yea there are some similarities to BE especially in the affect the future story but this movie has a different style about it as well.  The movie has a romantic heart about it and throws in a few funny moments as well and does a good job with blending a romantic comedy with a bit of sci-fi that also has a good message.  Even though it borrows a bit from BE it also has enough on its own to make it a unique story.

Good story with a heart, some humor that at the same time has a message and tugs at your heart.  A chick flick that even I as a guy enjoyed.  3.5 stars",1394064000,,1014,3.9655172413793105

5210651,5,B0090JBAPG,One of the best I have seen in awhile.  Very warm and positive.

The message about enjoying every day is delivered sweetly and the time travel element is used to propel the plot and reinforce the message to live each of our days to the fullest.  This could have been rated PG 13 if you removed one adult scene and some adult language and conversation.  Highly recommend for all!,1393891200,,458,4.290697674418604

It's the kind of movie that's so good you sit through all of the credits just to listen to the amazing music. I haven't seen a movie in years that was so happy, sad, well-acted, and beautifully scripted. Loved Domnhall Gleeson's character and felt incredibly jealous that the average relationship isn't this appreciative, supportive, amusing, and all-around amazing.

It was a very sweet movie.  There are so many different emotions and so many different levels of love that is demonstrated.  The use of ""time travel"" in the movie is very interesting and makes for some very funny scenes.  It was also sweet to see it used for a greater purpose.

5210784,5,B0090JBAPG,Wonderfully done! I couldn't wait to see this movie as Love Actually is my favorite movie - I watch it at least once every year. This movie is definitely a love story- but the best part was it was so much more than just the love between a boy and a girl... Soundtrack was also wonderfully done... Complimented the movie beautifully.,1393891200,,332,4.459016393442623
5210785,5,B0090JBAPG,Great couples movie... couple as great chemistry!!!

5210787,4,B0090JBAPG,"I'm pretty stingy with my stars, but this one really deserved 4.5. A fabulous feel good movie. I don't like time travel movies in general, but this is the exception. Lovely!",1393804800,,173,4.612903225806452
5210788,3,B0090JBAPG,"What you have here is an okay movie that you can kill 2 hours with, but if you have something better to do tonight save it for another time. I love the 3 star ""It's okay"" rating because so many movies easily fall under it, About Time certainly fits the bill because it is just that....""okay"".

I was skeptical in the first 10 minutes of the movie when the main plot was just thrown in, it felt very rushed. How about some character development before dude learns he can travel through time? It would have been more interesting that way to me, how he reacts to and uses his new found power would be as a result of how he was before he had it. All you got was he was too shy to kiss a girl on New year's Eve (even though he was drunk) then bam, he learns he can time travel and now sober magically finds the courage to go back in time and kiss the girl. That was your character development.

The rest of the movie did not flow very well at all and was basically a bunch of filler in between the comical moments he would use his time travel. The humor was mainly British and often times you knew it was supposed to be funny but it just wasn't. Things got way too serious at the end and at this point the movie started overstaying its welcome. It really could have been much shorter and better for it.

I didn't completely unenjoy the movie, but if I could have traveled back in time and done something else the past 2 hours I probably would have done so.",1393804800,,1451,4.120141342756184

If it nudges the sentimental now and again, so what?  It delivers joy, and who doesn't need more of that?  Domnhall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams are wholly likeable as in the leads.  It is as well a perfect vehicle for the subtle, winnng ways of the always watchable Bill Nighy.",1393718400,,401,4.527777777777778

Based on the cover and the fact that the actress had also starred in Time Traveler's wife, I originally thought this was a science fiction romance movie.

I found myself laughing out loud multiple times throughout this movie, to the point where I got a little self-conscious. For days after watching it, I was smiling from ear-to-ear, just remembering some of the sweet and funny moments. The overall message is one almost all of us need to hear - don't get weighed down by the normal grime of daily life.

This is right up there with his best, using a very high concept, but without throwing too much sci-fi or special effects into the mix making for a clever, involving story that makes you really care for the characters. As usual, there's a bunch of (hilarious) rudeness thrown in and the plot resolves itself well in the end (after some torturous twists and turns). Don't expect too much deepness, and just go along for the ride and I'm sure you'll enjoy this charming little film.",1393459200,,678,4.6115702479338845

It's kind of like Love Actually, in that I could see it becoming a repeat watch thing for when you need to believe in true love, or just need to see life going well for someone. The time travel element keeps it squarely in the realm of fantasy, but in a very realistic way. He uses his gift to correct ""mistakes"" in his courtship of the female lead, but as life becomes more complicated, discovers some ""issues"" and finds that, in the end, just living life in the moment one finds oneself is probably the best practice.

5210985,5,B0090JBAPG,"Alright, I know that it looks like a chick flick especially with the lovely Rachel McAdams gracing the movie poster, but it isn't as girly as you might think. Yes, it is a love story but it's not just the story of a man falling in love with a woman but also the love a man has for his family and friends.  It's the story of a time-traveling man who makes choices and then has the chance to make another choice at a certain point in time and how the change will affect his life from that point on.  However, time traveling isn't as simple as going back and changing and then jumping ahead and reaping the benefits.  There are consequences as there are to most choices in life, be them good or bad.  It is not a complicated story or one you must brood over for days.  Rather it is a movie that cherishes the moments in your life that you mess up and then are able to fix and how you can show your gratitude for those around you.",1393286400,,926,4.093922651933702

Yes, it is about TIME, but it is also about time we woke up to what is really important, and to what our role must be so we can get the most out of life.  All we have is TIME, so what we do with it, and how we choose to experience and explain it to ourselves is of primary importance.  This movie answers the questions we all ask at sometime during our lives, ""How can I be happy?"" ""Will I experience real love?""

5211031,4,B0090JBAPG,"For those of us that don't expect our films to adhere to strict reality ALL of the time, this is a great find. I really liked this film and I gladly add it to my DVD collection. I think 8/10 is a perfect rating for it. It's a hearwarming love story that made me laugh out loud, cry a few tears and, even at age 42, made me sometimes cringe in embarassment with a pillow over my face saying, ""Oh God, no. Please tell me he did not just do that, did he?""

We all wish we could go back and take a mulligan on various decisions in our lives and change them. Ask that person out, don't eat the brown acid, etc. Tim, the main character, and the other paternal male members of his family can travel in time. He also learns the unexpected consequences of doing so when he starts changing things.

For you time travel aficionados out there, this is where the movie ignores the ""Butterfly effect"" side of time travel and instead uses a more appropriate ""wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey"" Whoesque route to follow. It's not perfect and it was never meant to be.  It's a plot device, not the entire point of the story.

The casting and the soundtrack help make up for any plot holes in the story. There are many famlilar faces you have seen before that live up to expectations as well as a few actors that make you pull up IMDB so you can figure out where you know them from (at least 3 of them have appeared in episodes of Doctor Who.)

As the one-star reviews show, this movie isn't for everyone, but it is still a great Date Night rental movie with your significant other, a bowl of popcorn and and extra pillow to groan in once or twice (but in a good way.) If you are obsessed with plot holes and it ruins your enjoyment of a film, please BUY THIS FILM and give it to a friend.",1393200000,,1763,4.204142011834319

5211045,5,B0090JBAPG,"Many critics say this movie is silly. That it sets rules and then breaks them. That it is too dependent on its affable British-y, quaintly cutesy, tea and biscuit jolly good timey-ness. I say to them ""Who cares!?"" and also ""You're a curmudgeon!""

I think this movie is lovely. It's sweet but not saccharine, it is kind and warm-hearted but also sad and thought-provoking. The characters are round and whole and relatable. You want to be a better human after watching this movie, because it makes you think: ""What would it be like to relive my day? How might I do things differently? Might I laugh more? Complain less? Smile to strangers? Be more patient?"" I liked it. I adored it. Give it a try. And don't worry about when or whether they're breaking the rules of time travel, just enjoy being able to join them on the ride.",1393200000,,824,4.530201342281879

5211049,5,B0090JBAPG,"I absolutely adored Rachel Mcadams in this movie. The main male character of the story finds out that he has the ability to go back in time and change how he reacts to different life events.  He is a little awkward and geeky so he decides to use this as an opportunity to meet a girl. He eventually meets Rachel McAdams and they hit it off but  then  when he goes back in time to change other events it is as if he had never met her. Therefore, he has to find other ways to meet her again and get her to like him, which does not turn out as easy the next time around.  There are twists and turns and ups and downs, but the storyline was well thought out, fun, interesting, and emotional to watch.  Also, his family relationships with his father and sister play a huge role in the movie and you will fall in love with all of the characters.  Definitely a must see movie!! This movie has a great life lesson and is able to keep your interest without using violence or profanity; which too many movies rely on nowadays.",1393200000,,1016,4.184615384615385

This show makes you think about what is important in life and, if you ""get the message"", each day will become more precious to you.  We often take each day for granted when, instead, we should be glad we are alive and enjoy every minute.  It is those little things like smiles, chance encounters, friendly gestures, etc. that make life worth living.  If everyone did these, the world would be a better place.

Even though I was a huge fan of Notting Hill and Love Actually, I was initially disappointed to hear that this one was going to be about time travel. I was disappointed by The Time Travelers Wife, and was worried that this was going to be essentially a remake of that movie. On the contrary, it was not. The time travel in this movie was subtle. It was a tool that the protagonist used to embellish his life, not to overshadow or control it. The movie was simple, yet elegant. The acting was wonderful, the music was fabulous, and it was very sentimental and hopeful. I loved the lead character's relationship with his dad. Their relationship was wonderful. I must admit that the first 15 minutes of the movie was a bit dull. However, it steadily picked up and became a charming film. The last 20 minutes of the movie or so was very emotional. I loved the message behind the movie. I would definitely recommend renting this movie.",1393113600,,1097,4.517587939698492

It's like the writer comes out of the screen and verbalises it... He/she knows your pangs, thrusts, joys, and endeavors, and is grateful to you for having them. Why? Because your story, whatever it may be, is a joyous occasion and ought be celebrated!!! Life is best lived, but not so vicariously or without intent.
Frankly, I haven't seen a movie this profoundly educated in the daily nuance or expectation since NeverForgetMe.

I'm in awe.

It's a love story of both paternal and then partner romances.  It's a coming of age story for all teenage angst.  It's a salacious unfulfilled hope. It's a crazy disposition of how friends are chaos and support equally.  It's a story of really hard choices, though easy, right choices.

It's just a really good story--and please watch it with a loved one, because when you have to explain it later to one who has not watched it, you'll be floored by your own enthusiasm so much so that you'll need to watch it a second or third or fourth time.

If you are looking for a Bill Murray ""Groundhog Day"" time of fairy tale story that is funny and entertaining- you may be disappointed. It only partially entertains and becomes maudlin after a while. Rachel McAdams seems to be not acting with her co-star but playing to his lines.

The movie kind of drags after a while as you think almost aloud, ""get to the point, already!""  There are a couple of awkward sex scenes that don't seem to really be needed to further the story unless Rachel gets a kick showing off her body.

Bottom line- interesting, sometimes inventive yet disappointing in its story resolution. Almost as if there are differences in opinion between the director and producers on how to end it.",1392854400,,945,4.607142857142857

5211276,4,B0090JBAPG,"At first I thought it was odd that Rachel McAdams was in another ""time travel"" movie after The Time Traveler's Wife, but this one was different in that she wasn't aware of her boyfriend/husband's capability.  I love Bill Nighy and Domnhall Gleeson and I thought they did a great job in portraying the father/son relationship; finally a good example.  It's a basic love story with a few quirks but entertaining.",1392768000,,410,4.8428571428571425

Witty, poignant, very English , sprinkled with laugh aloud moments and thoroughly enjoyable.  Bill Nighy is fantastic, as are all the cast and the theme of the movie will ring true with anyone who deals with ordinary life and slightly odd relatives!

It is very easy to warm to the main charactors. This film is most enjoyable if you see it as a romantic comedy & not concentrate too much on the flaws. The London & especially Cornish scenery is quite stunning.,1392681600,,361,4.553846153846154

5211371,1,B0090JBAPG,"Rachel McAdams did almost exactly the same film a few years ago entitled:  ""The Time Traveler's Wife.""  It's sad; she was considered the ""it"" girl a few years ago.  Reportedly, she remains in the Great Lakes area - both Chicago and parts of Canada.  She avoids both coasts - and the script opportunities there.  Every few years, she makes an appearance in a tear-jerking romance, or gentle romantic comedy.  It seems like Amy Adams inherited what could have been her career.  I wonder how many times McAdams will reappear in watery romances before she and the industry will have had enough of one another.",1392595200,3,605,4.759615384615385

It incapsulates in it very interesting ideas about how one can live their life to the fullest (whether I agree or not) and gets you thinking about your own position in the matter.

I thought the actors did a good job making me believe in their characters and the soundtrack was pleasant.

5211420,3,B0090JBAPG,"Bill Nighy can do no wrong in my eyes, and this is no exception. He is the charm and humor that makes this movie as good as it is. Rachel McAdams is sweet and adorable and well, the same basic character in every role she plays, so she delivers on playing the cute, near perfect girl- again. The lead, Domnhall Gleason, is not really charming, and not really handsome, so it's difficult to attach yourself to his character and root for him too much. As a forever fan of Love Actually I wanted that experience again with this movie, but that magic does not really appear here. It's a cute movie that doesn't make you think too much or feel too much, but it's a pleasant enough movie to watch with your girlfriends or your parents or your kids. Just don't expect Love Actually or The Holiday (like I did.)",1392595200,,802,4.3533333333333335

5211454,2,B0090JBAPG,"We are Richard Curtis fans. We own most of his movies. ""Love Actually,"" ""Four Weddings & a Funeral,"" and ""Pirate Radio"" are in regular rotation on our DVD player. We were thrilled to learn that Curtis had a new movie out. In short, don't bother. ""About Time"" uses the trope of time travel to demonstrate that the bumbles and foibles of everyday life are part of its charm and that the ability to go back and fix them isn't as valuable as it first seems. The movie isn't quite as creepy as ""Time Traveler's Wife"" or as excruciatingly monotonous as ""Groundhog Day,"" but is so insipid that I'd rather watch either one again than sit through ""About Time"" a second time. There are apparently no consequences to time travel. Nothing really changes other than small events that the traveler wants to change. There are no big moral dilemmas or choices to make about what to change and what Domnhall Gleeson is willing to give up in order to make a change in the past. The one time he does, in fact, affect his future, he goes back and reverses his decision. In the end, the only challenge he faces is agreeing with his wife to have another child even though, through whatever messed up laws apply, that means he won't be able to go back and see his recently deceased father in the past. Boo hoo. The rest of us can't do that either. The two-star rating is a compromise. My wife wanted to rate it lower.",1392595200,,1394,4.428015564202335

5211466,1,B0090JBAPG,"First of all, it feels like a copycat of the movie Groundhog Day.

Second, the acting is somewhat pretentious.  I can feel the actor or actress intentionally trying to ACT to make it look like that way.  In many other movies, I do not see it.

There is also some type of way they speak or be humorous, kind of like in a Hugh Grant movie, that they always say things that are smart and witty and assertive.

Also, near the end the movie, it seemed to try to lecture people that yeah the world is all sweet and if we live through it not with worry or any tension, it will be sweet as it is.  To show as an example, the guy Tim showed a notebook showing a ""TOTAL DICK"" pointing at his boss in front of two other coworkers.  Try that in California, he will get fired or get very close to getting fired.  The company and boss try to make everybody as dispensable as possible so they don't have to rely on a particular person and therefore the company can fire the person any time.  In California, if you are nice and sweet, people find you as the target for bullying, to achieve their purposes in life of their own agendas.  So I think the movie saying, yeah, the world is all sweet and stuff, may apply in New Zealand where the director was born, but it is too generalized to say the world is all sweet.  And to lecture it to everybody.",1392595200,,1332,4.143968871595331

5211471,5,B0090JBAPG,"Super acting and interesting premise - what would you do if you could turn back time and re-live those mistakes in a ""Groundhog Day"" type manner. Well it's not all that easy and, although some choices are easy and humorous reworks, others are heart-wrenchingly difficult and have to be made because they are needed as part of growing up and getting on with the difficulty of living.

Not excessively deep, and perhaps a little cliched but there is a charming poignancy to the plot which several reviewers just don't get, presumably because they would rather watch a vacuous shoot 'em up no-brain apocalyptic film rather than one that leaves you thinking afterwards, even for a short while.

However, as I was watching I constantly thought about my life and what I would 'rewind', and how it would impact my life.  I was initially thinking it was some sort of English ""Groundhog Day"" ripoff, but it's so much more.  The choices get harder and more difficult, and really make one weigh what they have, with what 'might be'.  Just a great film over all.

5211695,5,B0090JBAPG,"Expect to be in for a jolly good ride if a film is both written and directed by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Love Actually). Add a fine cast of actors, a bit of a kink with time travel (of sorts) and out comes this little British confection perfect for Valentine's Day - or any day when an uplifting bit of romantic fluff is needed.

  The setting for the most part is Cornwall and the film is narrated by 21year old Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) who is awkward with finding a girlfriend and in general unlucky in love, as played out in a rather disastrous New Year's Eve party. But things change when Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, and then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend, playwright Harry (Tom Hollander) from professional disaster, and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. During his life, Tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors, but also in the lives of his relatives and friends.

Tim's family is a bit on the loony side and in addition to Bill Nighy as his wondrously gifted father, there is Lindsay Duncan is his mum, Richard Cordery is his space cadet Uncle D and Lydia Wilson is his sister nutty but sweet sister Kit Kat. Margot Robbie, Vanessa Kirby, Will Merrick and Tom Hughes offer excellent cameos. The time travel idea peters out once the film has started but the idea has been planted and helps make this frothy film float. `We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.' Grady Harp, February 14",1392249600,,2358,4.502336448598131

I also liked that rather than taking the film from the perspective of the man trying to get the girl, succeeding, and living hapily ever after being implied as the roll credits or the long married couple that realize how good they have it together just in time for the end credits, (MIGHT be considered spoiler here) this film goes through the whole process of meeting, dating, marrying, having kids, and life in that dynamic.

5211715,4,B0090JBAPG,"When it comes to time travel movies, I'm usually not a huge fan. They all typically make the same mistakes, and are never as good as you expect them to be. However, that's not true for the new romantic comedy ""About Time"". It puts a new spin on a story that's been told plenty of times, and will leave you with a huge smile on your face.

The film centers around Tim, a 21 year old who discovers he can travel in time and change what happens and has happened in his life. Using his newfound power to get a girlfriend named Mary, he quickly falls in love and wins her over. With witty comedy and great performances all around, this is much more than a date-movie.

Domhnall Gleeson (Tim) and Rachel McAdams (Mary) are fun and likeable, and Bill Nighy is hilarious as Tim's father. Rated R for language and sexual content, ""About Time"" has an irresistible charm that you can't get enough of.",1392163200,4,889,4.381818181818182
5211716,5,B0090JBAPG,"I don't rate movies on Amazon typically, but this story touches you, and makes you think. Maybe it's just because I've recently become a father and the father/son connection in this film is incredible that I can't stop thinking about the themes in this film. It's deep without being sappy. And completely unique. Really makes you think what you would do if you had (almost) all the time in the world to spend with the ones you love.

The other performances and storyline were terrific, too. But that's the bit that touched me.",1392163200,3,526,4.655913978494624
5211717,5,B0090JBAPG,I'm not that big a fan of Love Actually (blasphemy according to some) so I didn't have high expectations of this movie. I wasn't a devoted follower of any of the leads (although Bill Nighy is amazing- check out Wild Target for a few laughs) so I watched About Time on the recommendation of a friend. I was completely surprised and enthralled. This is a movie I'll be buying and watching over and over again.,1392163200,,407,4.44

5211721,5,B0090JBAPG,"The leading man is not your typical guy but he grows on you. I thought the dad was great and the relationship he has with his son is awesome. I was not expecting to enjoy this show this much but anything with Amy in it usually gets a thumbs up from me. She is a great actress and really cute girl. This is a chick flick that most guys will enjoy, if they give it a chance. Take it from an old married man, sometimes the wife is right............more than I let on.......... and this was one of those times.
good date flick.",1392163200,,523,4.087378640776699
5211742,5,B0090JBAPG,"I was skeptical about this, because it sounds A LOT like The Time Traveler's Wife, which Rachel McAdams also starred in. However a friend recommended this to me, and I'm so glad that I gave it a chance. This is the most genuinely beautiful, feel-good film that I saw in 2013, and not in an eye-rollingly saccharine way either. Just a gorgeous, charming, quirky, life affirming film with the perfect touch of bittersweet and a great cast. Obviously a great date movie, but great for watching alone as well. Love, humor (just the right blend of earnest emotion with self-awareness of the fantastic premise), heart. Highly recommended.",1392163200,,632,4.91588785046729

5211748,5,B0090JBAPG,"I really enjoyed this movie, in fact I still had time left on the rental and when my wife got home from a meeting I said you have to see this movie and I watched it with her for the second time. It's a British movie by the Director of Love Actually. It's a R-C with a little time travel thrown in.for good measure. I'm not going to spoil anything with a plot summery, but anything that can hold my attention for two hours and then another two hour is extremely unusual. Watch the movie.",1392163200,,486,4.126315789473685
5211749,5,B0090JBAPG,Such a sweet movie. I love how kind everyone is to one another and how ordinary the lives of the characters are. The message of the movie is a wonderful reminder to live life well. I will definitely be buying this movie for our home collection!,1392163200,,244,4.326086956521739

Rachael McAdams is so sweet and plays her role perfectly.  Nice story.....oh, husband fell asleep.  Him sleeping totally qualifies this movie as a CHICK FLICK.",1392163200,,332,4.655172413793103
5211763,5,B0090JBAPG,"it's just right... not too sappy, not too silly (the father and son can travel back in time--that's not a spoiler, you learn that straight away); it's just a movie that makes you smile... great acting from all involved...really loved it... nothing too serious.. sweet and tender... there's nothing not to like about it",1392076800,,318,4.907407407407407

5211766,5,B0090JBAPG,Thought this was a cute movie. Don't try to understand it and debunk how impossible the idea of time travel is in this movie. Just enjoy it. My husband would probably give this 2 stars.,1392076800,,185,4.314285714285714

5211768,5,B0090JBAPG,I thought this was such a sweet movie...makes you think of how we sometimes speak before we think. Also was a great father/son relationship. I loved it & would watch it again & again.,1392076800,,183,4.411764705882353
5211769,4,B0090JBAPG,A little sappy but overall good fun and cheers. The time travel thing is done in a very tongue & cheek manner. I think the chemistry was a bit lacking between the actors. It was not the Notebook but a cute love story nonetheless.,1392076800,,229,4.2272727272727275

The acting is good, the characters are interesting, and it never feels completely cliched or predictable even though it is at the end of it all a feel-good, warm and fuzzy movie.  Lots of nice life lessons that get incorporated in a fresh way.  Really liked Domnhall Gleeson and Bill Nighy in particular.  A pleasant surprise.",1392076800,,493,4.752941176470588

5211803,4,B0090JBAPG,"It's about time someone made a movie about time travel that doesn't involve technology. It's also about time that I got teary eyed at the end of a movie. This film has the perfect drama that gets to the point without getting into the ""When will this movie end?!!"" zone.

My big criticism with the story is that in this world, ladies do not possess the ability to go back through time. I guess father time favors the dudes, because they are more likely to use this power to make the world a better place. Haha! Wrong. They just want to go back in time and have sex with their girlfriend for the first time as many times as possible.

Rest assured there is no BUTTERFLY EFFECT in this universe. If I could go back in time I would stop that movie from being made. Let me add further that it's not because of Ashton's performance. It was just a bad movie. Ashton is great. Ashton created PUNK'D!",1391990400,,891,4.2976190476190474

5211809,4,B0090JBAPG,"Well, I mean, of course it's contrived. It's practically a sci-fi movie, what with the ability to travel within your own timeline thing and all, but that shouldn't keep you from watching it. The performances are solid, if slightly forgettable, and the dialog has that same witty-banterness of any Hugh Grant film. There are some nice little life insights sprinkled throughout, and there are a few times you'll swear someone is cutting onions right next to your face. And then the movie is over and you go to bed.

I don't think this will have the re-playability that Love Actually has, but yes: It's worth your $5 and your two hours.",1391990400,,633,4.702702702702703

It was about love, yes, but also about family. And, most importantly, it was about the importance of treating every day as if it were your last--not wasting a moment. Having lost my mom two years ago this week, it was a good reminder that I need to appreciate every day that I have, even the bad ones. Life is short. Make the most of it!

Ultimately it is about about life and the various experiences we all go through and the lack of appreciation for many of the nuances that pass us by.  If any of us had the ability to give ourselves a second chance, how would we handle those life experiences. If you could change your past, would it have the positive effects to make your life better or worse ?

So, since I had that expectation that it might be equal to or better than Love Actually, it was a let down in that regard.  Also, I didn't think that the two main characters had much chemistry though they each seemed like fine actors.  That being said, it was an enjoyable movie overall.  I just don't think it can compare to Love Actually (one of my all-time favs).",1391817600,,458,4.290697674418604

5211909,5,B0090JBAPG,"This is truly a wonderful movie.  Folks need to realize that this is not your typical romantic comedy...in fact, In not sure it could be classified as a comedy at all.  This is a film that is very heartwarming and touching at it's core.  I'll be the first to admit that some of the logistics about how the time travel aspect was used didn't really seem to be realistic....but come in, anything dealing with time travel can never truly be logistically sound.  But the fact is, this movie isn't really about time travel at all...that's just a very secondary part of the overall story.  This film is about the heart and the growth of the characters.  And in that aspect, this film was brilliantly written, brilliantly acted, and is simply a wonderful film to waste 2 hours on.

As a side note, I want to give a special shout out to Bill Nighy.  I've always felt he was a truly brilliant actor, and personally feel he should receive more recognition for his brilliance.  This film truly showcases how wonderful of an actor he truly is.  Even though he wasn't the 'lead' actor in this film, he gave so much heart to this role, especially in the latter parts of the film, that I'm not sure it's possible to watch the end of this film and not have your eyes get a little misty.  All the actors give a wonderful performance, but Bill's performance was second to none.  It's amazing how in certain roles he can make us laugh our hind parts off, and in others he can make you get misty eyed as easily as he does here.  For me, that's the sign of a truly gifted actor....and Bill, hats off to you for helping to make this film special.

If you want to watch a truly fine movie...you could do a lot worse than this fine film.",1391817600,,1713,4.345911949685535

5211924,5,B0090JBAPG,"When I saw the trailer of this film, I immediately wanted to watch it. The story looked interesting, and the cast was very promising, so when I got to watch it, it was everything I expected and more.
The story balances drama, romance and comedy amazingly; you have a little bit of everything. The writing is spectacular, and every scene makes you smile (even the sad ones), and you get to see a different side of life with this movie. It also handles time travel so well, with no extra drama, just like everyone would handle it if anyone would have the ability to do it.
I also think a movie is great when you love the characters instantly, and this happens with ""About Time""; the characters are so well written that you get to see how Tim's ""power"" affects all of them (except his dad) without even knowing, every decision we make can change our life dramatically and we don't even notice, that is the best part of this film. You take everything for granted, but every small decision took us to where we are now. Mary and Tim's chemistry was undeniable too.
The movie makes you see a different side of life, and you appreciate everything more when you finish watching the movie. If you think this is a chick flick, you're wrong, give it a try! You'll love it.",1391731200,3,1260,4.435344827586207

5211933,4,B0090JBAPG,"A lovely film ,that took forever, for me, anyway to really latch onto my interest. A film from Richard Curtis, 'Notting Hill', a lot about love, family, living life the right way, everyday.

Tim Lake, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is living at home in Cornwall with his parents Bill Nighy, as dad and Lindsay Duncan, as his mother. Quite an eccentric family, including his sister Kit Kat, played by Lydia Wilson. He is just starting his professional life, he considers himself, ""too tall, too skinny and too orange"", but to most of us, just right. Tim is leaving for London when his father tells him a family secret: Once they turn 21, the men in the family acquire the ability to travel back in time, a power that comes with its own logic and rules. This does seem like overkill, but it is the one true thing that holds this film together, other than the exquisite acting. Tim can go back to moments in his own life and become more sexy, and more sensitive.

Tim meets the love of his life, Mary, played by Rachel McAdams, and off they go into life. The rest of the film seemed to overlong to me, rather sentimental, but quite lively, all in all. A good film for the family, over 15, and a good date night film. Any film with Bill Nighy is a good one. Rachel McAdams and, new to me, Domhhall Gleeson, carry the film quite well.

Instead of developing characters that we might care about, for example, it just rolls out stock versions of them: the ""eccentric"" uncle, the ""free spirit"" sister, the ""best friend"" father, the ""nerdy"" girl friend, the nerdy girl friend's ""hot and sassy"" friend, etc.

Worst of all, it's basically a boy meets girl story (which is fine in principle, of course) . . . in which there's no especially good reason for the boy to have an interest in the girl at all.

After watching, I think it's safe to say that I was sold correctly. There is nothing spectacular in the twist and turns, the plot move smoothly down the line; most of the time that is a negative for me, however with About Time, I laughed, my wife cried(in a good way) and overall the movie put you in a positive feel-good mood when it was over. I now own the movie and can see this in our regular watching rotation.

5212017,5,B0090JBAPG,"It's rare when a movie comes around that defies normal classifications.  Here in ""About Time"" we have a romance mixed with a bit of fantasy mixed with a dose of sci-fi and the end result is magic.  The story follows Tim, played by Domhnall Gleeson, who finds out from his father (Bill Nighy) on his 21st birthday that he can travel in time, something all men in his family are able to do.  Of course, not fully understanding the ramifications of time travel he accidentally erases the recent chance meeting he had with Mary, played by Rachel McAdams, and as such he no longer has her contact information and she will no longer remember him at all.

It is fascinating to watch Tim move through events in his life with the realization that he could go back and fix them if he said or did something wrong.  From the scenes where he goes back in time to his first crush to the scenes of his and Mary's ""first time"" we get to see a character in Tim with a lot of heart.  The ability to move about in time could be used for some many nefarious reasons, but Tim ends up almost exclusively using it to try to make Mary happy and to check in with his father.

The bottom line is this is a movie that just needs to be seen.  It really is part chick flick and part sci-fi which should make most everyone happy.  One of the most original films I've seen in a long, long time.",1390089600,72,1363,4.211538461538462

He enjoyed the humor and story line, and I enjoyed everything about it! We had a great time... I suggest this for a cozy night-in movie, a girls-sleepover movie, or a personal sobbing/smiling movie marathon. Love, love, love it. Plus, Rachel McAdams is adorable and the guy actor was really charming and witty :) :)",1389225600,,656,4.385245901639344
5212020,4,B0090JBAPG,"I remember when seeing ""Love, Actually"" (like this film, written and directed by Richard Curtis) for the first time.
How at the beginning, my cynical New York City self was about to check out on the gloopy sentimentality of the opening scenes.
Then there came the magic moment where I realised that, ""yes, this is a Romantic Comedy.
But it's the work of a master of the genre"".  I let go, and enjoyed the ride.
And what a brilliant ride.
Now from the writer of ""Black Adder"", ""Mister Bean"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", ""The Vicar of Dibley""
and a resum that one would kill to just have a part of, comes his newest: ""About Time""
Yes, it's a rom com.  Get over it lads: you are in the hands of a master.
And as with many masters, they tend to transcend genre.
With lines of dialogue that are so smart and crisp that you get jealous that you hadn't said it yourself,
and an intelligence, playfulness and joy that is so rare, this is a great film.
Yes, you will laugh, you will cry and you will feel amazingly wonderful after you watch this film.
Read the other reviews for story points, the things I will mention are mostly directed towards those
who might question watching this lovely film.
Number One: Bill Nighy!  Watching him in his lanky, liquid  ease is such a pleasure.  You are not sure if
you want to be him, or to have him as your father (the part he plays in the film and core to a major theme).
He is just a pure joy to watch.
Number two: Domhnall Gleeson. To digress- one of the problems with Hugh Grant is that though absolutely charming,
you tend to watch his bumbling and insecurities and almost love him for them, but then get shocked out of it by
thinking ""He's too good looking to actually believe any of it"".  Well, though it is damning praise, Domnhnaill Gleeson
has as much wit and charming self deprecating insecurity but is ultimately more believable because he looks
more like the rest of us.  (I use Hugh Grant as a reference because he is a Curtis favorite with his fantastic turn in Curtis' ""4 Weddings"" and
the slightly less fantastic but still charming role in ""Notting Hill"" and another great part as Prime Minister in ""Love, Actually"").
As usual, Curtis brings along a fantastic cast from the leads to all of the supporting cast.
So, just adding my voice to the other good reviews.
It's just a great film to watch so do it!
(And the reason I gave it a 4 star rating is that you have to save 5 stars for the unimpeachable classics.  And yes,
I unashamedly would consider ""Love, Actually"" as a 5 star film)",1389139200,2,2553,4.3940677966101696
5212021,5,B0090JBAPG,"I love romantic comedies, but I hate how trite and shallow they can be sometimes. Although this may look like a romantic comedy, and certainly has romantic and comedic elements to it, it certainly is not the traditional rom-com formula (as noted by New York Magazine: [...] It's witty, sweet, and downright charming. I'm not a huge fan of scifi movies, so I was a little skeptical of the time-traveling part of the story, but that's not really the emphasis of the movie-- it's used more for comedic purposes and for thematic messages. In fact, it has a great message, and it definitely left quite the impression on me, as it is one of the best of the 'lighter' kind of movies to come out in a long time.",1389052800,3,703,4.457364341085271
5212022,5,B0090JBAPG,"I just saw this tonight at the cheap theater and I am SO glad i did! I think the last movie that made me cry quite so much was Life is Beautiful, so it's been a long time.

Now--the reviews I got from friends had been mixed, and I think it's because it's SO incredibly British. If you don't like movies with lots of dialogue, if you need a lot of action to keep you engaged, this is not the film for you.  Also, it's not just a a romcom. I found the story of the father and son to be more central to the story, even though the love story is nice too. I only had one friend who actively disliked the movie, but she is basically emotionally dead inside (no seriously) so it didn't surprise me. I found the movie very touching, and if I would have been at home, would have been sobbing quite obnoxiously.

I think the reason I loved it so much is because I dearly love British movies, I love quirky, well developed characters, I love interesting, endearing relationships between those characters.  This movie delivered. If you liked Love Actually, you should like this one too--though this does move a bit slower. I'm preordering it so I can watch it over and over.",1388880000,6,1162,4.292237442922374
5212023,1,B0090JBAPG,"I am surprised at the good reviews. This movie had good potential, but lacked in story and character development. If you know anything about the true story that this is based on, you'd know that only the basic idea was used. The true story is way better.

The film dragged in parts and its lead actor was not prepared for the range that the role called for. A better actor was required for the role.

I am a 35 year old man who enjoys watching good romantic films with his wife, but this is not one of them. This falls short and is nowhere near the same league as the more recent 'Silver Linings'.",1388448000,5,597,4.228070175438597
5212024,5,B0090JBAPG,"Like all of his other movies, Richard Curtis makes movies like no one else.  I loved this movie!  I loved that is wasn't the typical romantic comedy, it also focused on family and other relationships.  I lost my father 4 years ago in a plane crash, so perhaps that is why the relationship between father and son held such interest for me.  If only we did have time travel.  Anyone who has lost a precious person, knows that given the chance, you don't wish for money, fame and things.  You wish for one more day.  That is all. One more day.  So yes, I got this movie and I can't wait to see it again and cry my eyes out.",1388448000,16,620,4.108333333333333
5212025,5,B0090JBAPG,"Leave your preconceived notions at the door!  I thought this was a light comedy, this was so much more, it was ultimately about love, about family and all the emotions that flow with it!  I have always loved Love Actually and the Family Stone, this now tops my list of all time great movies.  ""It's not the journey, but who you choose to take it with"".  Amazing, beautiful movie - I promise you, you will not regret OR forget it.  My daughter and I both laughed and cried - stellar casting, script and direction - In this age of instant video, it is one I must own (and I will be giving it as a gift)!",1387756800,2,601,4.146551724137931
5212026,4,B0090JBAPG,"The posters and trailers for About Time prominently tout that it is from the creators of Love Actually, Notting Hill, and Four Weddings and a Funeral.  While About Time is curiously missing an appearance by Hugh Grant, the film is absolutely deserving of being listed as an equal among those films.  It is a warm and heartfelt film that feels incredibly Romantic in every sense of the word.

About Time stars Domhnall Gleeson, who American audiences know as Bill Weasley from the final two Harry Potter films, but not much else.  Gleeson, son of the great Irish actor, Brendan Gleeson, plays Tim, a name curiously similar to the principle word in the title, Time.  Thus, the movie is as much about Tim as it is about time.  On his 21st birthday, Tim is given the odd and unbelievable news from his father (Bill Nighy) that the men in his family have the ability to travel through time.  For a romantic comedy, it is surprising to see a plot resting so firmly on such an absurd and fantastic premise.  Yet, one must only look back 20 years to a little film called Groundhog Day, perhaps the greatest modern romantic comedy ever made, that succeeds due to a bizarre and unexplainable time rift that allows the films message to flourish and evolve!  About Time clearly tips its hat to the Harold Ramis classic in several humorous scenes where Tim bounces off to try and undo some foolishly embarrassing moments.

But About Time is not at all subjugated by its premise.  Tims father asks him what he plans to do with his new gift, and the film is quite ideal in its treatment of such a power.  Tim decides that he will use it for love.  Thus, Tim moves out of his parents house and strikes out for London where he will practice law and search for love.  He finds it in Mary (Rachel McAdams), an American publishing house editor working in London.  It is here that the movie firmly kicks into romantic gear.  While it successfully emphasizes the passion, beauty, and emotion of young love, the time travel element allows the film to search deeper into modern romanticism as Tim is able to slow down, explore the natural beauty of the world, experience the trials of the mind, free himself from the corrupting forces of society, and most importantly  discover how to make the most out of life.

Director, Richard Curtis has made a beautiful film with About Time.  Elegant, cozy country-side scenes are balanced with busy but scenic city-scapes. Curtis gives London the Paris treatment, making it look far more inviting and relatable than other films have in the past.  But like all romantic comedies, the true magic lies in the chemistry of its leads.  Gleeson and McAdams are easy to root for, and their relationship is not hokey, nor does the film commit the cardinal sin of having Tim use his powers to manipulate Mary.  Instead, his power is used to create opportunities, but it is Tim that must make the most of them.  A fine example lies in the scene where Tim and Rachel first meet by happenstance.  Ironically this first meeting is in a restaurant called Dans Le Noir, a restaurant where diners sit in total darkness, an immersive experience that emphasizes the other senses and provides a clever way for Tim and Rachel to build the foundation for their relationship.  Soon, a mistake made by Tim during time travel causes this first meeting to be forgotten leading Tim to find a way to create a new opportunity to make an impression on Mary.  Now, that is not to say that Tim does not play puppet-master with other peoples lives, which is a bit off-putting.  Nonetheless, these minor valleys are certainly not enough to degrade the films peaks.

The sentimentality of the film is authentic and while occasionally heavy-handed, it is quite effective.  The Tim and Mary story is central to the film, but Curtis as writer and director makes sure to develop the father-son relationship between Tim and his Dad.  It is in this relationship where most of the heartstrings are continually tugged upon.  Nighys inclusion in the story adds warmth but also some complexity as he too can travel through time.  The bond between the men, the shared experiences, and the lessons learned all work to make the film about more than just a love story.

About Time is a pleasing and successful film that does not exploit its premise or undermine its characters.  Fans of romantic comedies (especially those of Curtiss) will be satisfied and touched by this film.  B+

About Time opens on November 8th, and has a running time of 2 hours and 3 minutes.  It is a beautiful and well-made film that would make an excellent date-night option in a fall movie season full of thrillers, action, and suspense.  It also accomplishes the dual task of making us forget about the other far more disappointing Rachel McAdams time travel romance, The Time Travelers Wife.",1387756800,3,4839,4.703087885985748
5212027,5,B0090JBAPG,"Just saw it a second time, and once again managed to soak a handkerchief with happy/sad tears.  This is a beautiful film that I look forward to watching annually for many years to come.",1387670400,2,185,4.4411764705882355
5212028,2,B0090JBAPG,The reviews posted so far must have been by people associated with the movie.  I LOVED the first half of the movie that concentrated on the love between the couple but the wheels come off the movie in the second half spending way too much time on the father son relationship and the brother-sister relationship.  So if you can stop watching the movie at the half way point you will be happy.  But the movie gets muddy and loses focus.  I was very disappointed because I am a huge fan of Love Actually movie.,1387152000,4,507,4.361702127659575
5212029,5,B0090JBAPG,"LOVED this movie!!  In my opinion there haven't been any good chick flicks out for a long time- either they're really crass or lacking endearment- both in regard to characters and plot.  With that in mind this movie came thru where others have fallen short.  Not only were the characters memorable and easy to root for but the plot itself was creative, funny, sweet and tear-inducing.  I especially liked how the actor who played the main character is a normal run of the mill guy- felt like someone I'd know in real life (well aside from the time traveling of course...hehe).  A definite must see!!  I highly recommend :)

PS-  My husband went with me (gasp b/c he doesn't like chick flicks) and he even teared up at the end and said it was ""good""... that right there carries more weight than what I wrote above ;)",1386115200,102,815,4.496598639455782

8533321,5,B0090JBAPG,"I smile when I see critics examining a movie that is a light in an often painful world like it's some scientific or mathematical theory. They supposedly love art yet they reject it, not for art sake yet for not enjoying it for what it is.

Look at these cats:

About Time received mostly positive reviews from critics. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 68%, based on 144 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Beautifully filmed and unabashedly sincere, About Time finds director Richard Curtis at his most sentimental.""[13] Metacritic, which uses a weighted mean, assigned a score of 55 out of 100, based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[14]

Catherine Shoard of The Guardian compared the film to Groundhog Day noting it ""is about as close to home as a homage can get without calling in the copyright team"" and describes Domhnall Gleeson as a ""ginger Hugh Grant"", which ""at first, is unnerving; as About Time marches on, Gleeson's innate charm gleams through and this weird disconnection becomes quite compelling."" Shoard gave the film 2 stars out of 5.[15] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph praised the comic timing of McAdams and Gleeson, but criticised the film, comparing it to a quilt, calling it ""soft, frayed at the edges, and oh so comfortable"" and gives it a score of 3 stars out of 5.[16]

Leslie Felperin of Variety magazine called the film ""reassuringly bland"" and says there is sense of dj vu especially for anyone who has seen The Time Traveler's Wife also co-starring McAdams. Unlike that film she has no knowledge of his powers, resulting in a ""fundamental lack of honesty in their relationship"". Felperin noted British reverse snobbery would put many off this and other Curtis films, but that this would be less of a problem among American Anglophiles and those willing to suspend disbelief, taking the characters as British ""versions of Woody Allens Manhattanites (but with less angst)"". Felperin praised the chemistry of the leading couple ""that keeps the film aloft"" and the supporting cast, while also criticising the stock characters as being too familiar.[17]
