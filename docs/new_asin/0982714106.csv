7795742,5,0982714106,"I was skeptical about whether sign language would even interest my daughters because they can hear.  Well I was completely wrong. They love this DVD set and they keep asking to watch it over and over.  These videos are not only instructional but thoroughly entertaining for my 2 year old, my 5 year old, my 8 year old and yes even me...  we are all learning to sign and it is very exciting.",1281484800,,390,4.315068493150685
7795743,5,0982714106,My 14 month old daughter has been watching this DVD for a few months now.  She loves it!  This is the only DVD that she will sit still for.  She has learned many signs and uses them daily to communicate.  I recently had two 4 year olds over and they loved the DVD's as well.  One even asked if Santa could bring her sign language DVD's for Christmas : )  Highly recommend!,1281398400,,372,4.097222222222222
7795744,5,0982714106,My granddaughter just loved this dvd. She learned some signing when she was in preschool and enjoyed it.  This dvd gives her  extra tools to learn more.,1281225600,,152,4.592592592592593
7795745,5,0982714106,"Look Who's Signing Part 1 A-J is a great tool for language development!  My kids love watching both Part 1 A-J and Part 2 K-J.  What a great way to learn sign language. The signs displayed on these DVDs are familiar to my children such as ""mommy"", ""daddy"",""baby"", ""book"", ""read"" and so many more.  Along with learning so many signs in American Sign Language, they are also learning the letters of the alphabet, they see the letter, hear it and then sign it!  The music is great and the kids in the video are adorable!  Would highly recommend this product to all children!",1278979200,,571,4.504854368932039
