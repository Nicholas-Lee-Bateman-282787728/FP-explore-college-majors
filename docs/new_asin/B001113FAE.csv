I have only made sense of this one by watching fan-subbed versions on youtube, but I couldn't wait to get a copy, so I got it anyway. It really is a great story though. This Japanese version has no subtitles, and navigating the japanese menue almost made me go cross-eyed, but I still got a feel for what was going on, once I figured out how to play it. The plot does get pretty intricate, so I am really hoping that they will come out with an american release. It is driving me CRAZY! A side note Japanese people are incredibly nice. I got a small Hand Written note of thanks (in English) and a small hand made swan oregami. Heck! just that in itself was worth the whole order to me.",1370908800,3,840,4.159509202453988
8239856,4,B001113FAE,"This was a hard DVD for me to get a hold of as well as reverse-engineer to get it to play in my US region DVD player.

As the viewer, it's nice if you have had some experience with the wonderful language of Japanese, as there was no option on the DVD to play English subtitles.

This was/is a 2 part story. Of course the main cast of characters are involved (Keiichi, Belldandy, Urd, and Skuld), but also includes Lind, Peorth, Marler, and Hild.
On the DVD selection menu there were options for each episode, view the many various television advertisements, or watch and listen to the Japanese voice actresses for Belldandy, Urd, and (I think) Skuld talk about their enjoyment and experiences working on the Ah! My Goddess! series.

If you are a fan of the manga, this anime film takes place from chapters 155 to about 165. With any anime version, there are some parts that are different from the printed book version.

Although I would have liked to have purchased this DVD from Amazon US, or Amazon JPN, I wound up purchasing this from Kinokuniya bookstore (they are online, but I went to an actual location). With the exchange rate as it was at the time of purchase, I paid upwards of $90.
Wonderful quality for the packaging I'd have to say. Full color plastic sleeve DVD slip cover, hard plastic DVD interior case.
Great animation, beautiful bright colors, and familiar voice cast.
Reminder: this was not made for US Region DVD players. This does not have English subtitles as an option. The menu is entirely in Japanese (kanji).

I like the Goddess series and own Seasons 1 and 2. I was curious as to this story so I bought it. $90 is pretty expensive for a DVD so I can't say if I'd make the same choice at present. But I can tell you that it is a nice DVD (package, story, animation, colors, etc) all around so for the time being I'll keep it in my library.",1364774400,,1865,4.441520467836257
