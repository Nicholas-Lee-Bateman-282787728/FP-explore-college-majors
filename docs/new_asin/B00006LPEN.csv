7971794,5,B00006LPEN,"You will not be able to find a slightest trace of soviet ideology in this movie, no matter how hard you try. If anyone knows soviet cinematography, will understand how unusual it is - especially for WW2 movie.

You see the war through the eyes of average Kakhetian (Georgian province) peasant, who knows very little beyond growing his grapes and making wine. Georgia was not directly touched by the war, so he can not imagine what horrors it helds and is about to discover them in his late 50s, maybe even early 60s.

when the bombing starts and Germans attack, he is lost and confused, until he sees how German soldier finishes off wounded Russian... he is appalled and in anger smashes the soldier's head with butt of his own jammed gun, and decides to stay on and fight...

Movie was almost put on shelf by censors because of the scene when the main hero (old Georgian(!) soldier) smacks across the face Russian NCO (for driving tank over vineyard). But fortunately Russian generals invited for viewing had more brains and insisted on releasing the movie. It immediately became a hit and for many years remained one of those movies which TV channels would show on May 9 or June 22 (SU was invaded on June 22)...

even last year, I was in Baku and was flipping channels at Hotel and was very surprised to come across Father of a Soldier being shown on main local channel...",1121385600,13,1375,4.5772357723577235
7971795,5,B00006LPEN,"Not at all a soviet propaganda piece. Filmed in the Crustchev years,the director just stuck to the human tragic drama.

That doesn't mean the movie doesn't contain any action, the action laces well into the story. The movie takes you through a heartwarming journey of an old man becomming a soldier, just to have the best chance, seeing his son again. Seeing his son again, is more than worth his own life, and his life becomes

part of the crusade to free russia from the fascist invaders.

He does not hate the german people, he hates the ideology that made beasts out of them. There is a wonderful key scene, where he

is trying to protect wine-stocks from being destroyed by russian

tanks, witnessed by german children: ""You are germanies future, you have to have something to start over with !""

He finally meets his son again for the finall battle for Berlin.",1120608000,6,866,4.627450980392157
