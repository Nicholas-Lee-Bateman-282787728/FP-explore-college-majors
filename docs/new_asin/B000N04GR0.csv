8173732,4,B000N04GR0,"There were various types of teams during the ""golden age"" of tag teams in the 1980's ranging up to 10 different teams at one time (just watch the first two Survivor Series) but there was one team that stood out more than any other team as far how dominate they were in the division to the point where they hold the record for the longest tag team title reign in WWE history to this day in Ax & Smash also known as Demolition.  Now I saw this presentation thanks to ""WWE Classics On Demand"" but back in the day, this was your typical Coliseum Home Video back in the day where it was around 90 minutes long showcasing matches from a certain period in their career which in this case was the first year of their Tag Team Championship reign with Ax & Smash hosting the set themselves.

vs. Strike Force - The power advantage started things off for Demolition right from the start by just pounding on Rick Martel to the point where it took double teaming from him & Tito Santana to gain control with Martel showcasing some power of his own with repeated hip tosses while also working over the arm with armbars.  Demolition resorted to the tactics of the illegal man taking a shot at Tito on the apron to gain the momentum & kept it by working him over in the corner for a period of time but Martel was able to get a tag who came in very work dropkicking everyone in sight before catching Smash in the Boston Crab while Tito came back in while Tito tried to help by working over Ax in the corner & Mr. Fuji who got on the apron but that only turned out to be a distraction with the referee concentrating so hard on getting Tito out of the ring because he's the illegal man which allowed an opening for Demolition to not only take advantage but capitalize.  The match itself was your typical tag team match but was very important as far as how it began the history making reign of Demolition.
WrestleMania IV
[Allied Powers: Wrestling's Greatest Tag Teams]

vs. Hart Foundation - This match had an unusual setup as Demolition was not only accompanied by their manager in Mr. Fuji but Jimmy Hart who was still the official manager of the Hart Foundation despite the fact that they made it clear they wanted nothing to do with him.  The Harts started out in control & heavily worked over Smash's arm causing Ax to resort to taking an illegal shot on the apron for his team to get the advantage which continued to work in their favor when Bret went into the post with his shoulder.  Demolition beat on that shoulder using wrestling moves like the shoulderbreaker & wrenching armbars while also using whatever was around them like the ring ropes but Niedhart was eventually able to get a tag using his strength while also taking risk of his own like a slingshot dive over the top rope.  This was a good match between both teams as they traded momentum that would only be topped by their 2 Out Of 3 Falls encounter 2 years later at this same event but was more to the backdrop of the continuing feud between the Harts & their manager Jimmy Hart.
SummerSlam 88

Elimination Tag Match w/Conquistadors vs. British Bulldogs & Powers Of Pain - This was a 10 team (20 man) elimination tag match that was joined in progress that was telling the story of the Bulldogs & Powers Of Pain clearly having the power advantage while Demolition was able to keep taking advantage of the mistakes the other team was making with the Conquistadors being the biggest shock of the whole match considering they lasted for so long.  The main story here was happened when Demolition was dominate yet Mr. Fuji kept distracting his own team & even caused their elimination resulting in a fight on the floor resulting in Demolition dumping Mr. Fuji before Power Of Pain assisted Fuji back & went on to win the match with Fuji in their corner.  I believe this was the first ""double turn"" in WWE history as Demolition were set to continue as babyface while Powers Of Pain would not be the heels with Mr. Fuji as their manager.
Survivor Series 88

vs. Bolsheviks - Tony Shavonie described this match perfectly when he said, ""Relentless Demolition"" because they were dominate from start to finish with the Bolshevkis not getting one significant amount of offense in while Demolition dominated with their power moves & grounded wrestling.

vs. Honky Tonk Man & Greg Valentine - This was a pretty back & forth encounter as both teams had the same type of offense in mind as far as keeping a member of the other team in their corner away from their teammate but this was more about the issues between referee Ronnie Garvin & Greg Valentine.

vs. Brain Busters - Demolition came out dominate early with their power keeping the Busters down & double teaming in the corner while also taking the advantage right back when they gained a short amount of momentum in their favor only to show off while constantly catching them whenever they attempted offense causing Bobby Heenan to feel so embarrassed that he actually tried to go in the ring & fight Demolition himself.  Anderson & Blanchard resulted in using various dirty tactics to finally gain some momentum such as using the ring ropes to choke, double teaming behind the referee, and taunting Ax on the apron drawing him into the ring so the referee would get distracted but Demolition just got tired of all the dirty tactics taking matters into their own hands resulting in a brawl between all four men that started in the ring & continued all the way to the back.  This was more of a teaser for their upcoming series over the tag team titles but still a good encounter.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" May '89

vs. Mr. Fuji & Powers Of Pain - Despite this being a handicap match, Powers Of Pain would still become WWE Tag Team if either one of them or Mr. Fuji got the win.  Demolition used their usual strategy of beating down each legal member of Powers Of Pain & keeping them down but would lose their advantage whenever they switched their attention to going after Mr. Fuji who took shots on the apron whenever he could while also tagging whenever one of them was down just to add insult to injury.  Both teams would trade momentum with power moves like clotheslines & slams but Fuji got involved one too many times to the point where it backfired & Demolition finally got their hands on their former manager.  The tag match wasn't much as the story was all about them getting their hands & revenge on Fuji.
