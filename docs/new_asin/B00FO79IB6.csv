6016202,3,B00FO79IB6,I'm kinda down the middle on this.  It's great to see these again as nostalgia but video quality is horrible throughout. I also got the King family Christmas collection which is amazingly good both in video quality and content. More care seems to have been made in the original productions as well as the mastering for DVD. Since they were produced in the same era as the Bing Crosby specials there really is no excuse for the poor quality here. Nevertheless I'm glad this is available purely for reminiscing of a bygone era.,1476230400,5,525,4.645161290322581

6016204,3,B00FO79IB6,"Singing is fine. Ok, contrived sets, but that's the times of course and true of those variety shows. Most interesting was one scene (may have been in special features) in which Crosby and Sinatra show their shallow selves or lack of acting ability or whatever. That was quite a period piece to see, but then Bing was a wife beater according to some reports, and Sinatra was a gangster by some reports so that was an intriguing set. I did enjoy the Carpenters in that they were very talented in terms of arrangements for Karen's voice. So sad she looks barely skeletal, but what a voice!. don't recall how soon she died of Ipacec heart failure after this production from her eating disorder but it must not have been too long.",1452470400,2,725,4.541984732824427

6016206,5,B00FO79IB6,"If you're a baby boomer you likely grew up watching Bing Crosby on television at least once a year, in his annual and much anticipated Christmas specials. They may have even been the only thing you knew him for, if you were too young to remember the prodigious career that preceded those festive end-of-year broadcasts. Bing's holiday shows with his family, which began in the 1960s when he hosted the Hollywood Palace's (ABC's answer to the Ed Sullivan Show) Christmas programs, and continued into the 1970s when he and his family starred in their own Christmas specials, were practically an institution back in the 3-channel, pre-cable days. If you were born prior to the Second World War you likely remember Bing as one of the most beloved entertainers of the 20th century, with the TV Christmas shows serving as an endearing coda to a legendary performer's long career. In either case, this set of four vintage Crosby specials (plus a bonus show, outtakes and TV spots), not seen in more than three decades, should be a warm and welcome sight to your world weary eyes. This is ""comfort television"" of the highest order.

Bing's first two holiday TV specials--which weren't entirely devoted to a Christmas theme--comprise the first of the two discs. 1961's ""Bing Crosby Show,"" which was filmed in England and aired on December 11th, features Terry-Thomas and Shirley Bassey, with a surprise appearance by one of Bing's old buddies. ""The Bing Crosby Show for Clairol,"" from December 24th, 1962, was Bing's first color special, and his guests are broadway star (and two-time movie co-star with Bing) Mary Martin and pianist-conductor-composer Andr Previn. Filling out disc 1 are outtakes from the Clairol Special and the half-hour ""Happy Holidays with Bing and Frank"" (Dec. 20, 1957), in which Frank Sinatra shares a ""toddy for the body"" with guest Bing, in Frank's late-`50s (faux) swingin' bachelor pad.

Disc two features a pair of the best of Bing's 1970s Christmas shows with his wife Kathryn and children Harry, Mary Frances and Nathaniel. The first, ""Bing Crosby and the Sounds of Christmas"" (December 14, 1971), is a feast for the eyes and ears, and a rare example of just how appealing that oft-denigrated genre, the variety show, could be, with engaging comedy and musical performances by Robert Goulet and Mary Costa, and sublime caroling by the Mitchell Singing Boys choir. Finally, perhaps the best-remembered and most beloved Christmas special of them all, ""Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas,"" taped just weeks before Bing's death and aired posthumously on November 30, 1977, closes out this delightful set. Shot in England, it of course features Bing's now legendary--but at the time surprising and anomalous--duet with David Bowie, ""Little Drummer Boy""/""Peace on Earth,"" as well as engaging performances by pioneering supermodel Twiggy, Brit comedians Stanley Baxter and Ron Moody, and The Trinity Boys Choir.

Produced by veteran DVD maven Robert S. Bader (""The Dick Cavett Show - Hollywood Greats,"" ""Groucho Marx: You Bet Your Life - The Best Episodes""), the visual and audio quality of these 38- to 58-year-old shows has been beautifully restored. In fact, they look and sound better than they did when they first aired--whether your television set had rabbit ears or a rooftop antenna.",1448409600,15,3308,5.11090573012939

6016212,4,B00FO79IB6,"These specials, while corny and a bit opportunistic in the way they use the Christmas season to promote Bing and his friends and family, have a charm to them.  Bing Crosby was a legend and for many of us, is one of the voices that defined the holiday season with songs like ""White Christmas"" and the classic Bowie/Crosby ""Little Drummer Boy"" duet.  There aren't too many new Christmas/Holiday carols being written, let alone a vocalist of Crosby's stature to deliver it and make it his own.  Thus, these television specials are worth watching as they document a time, 30 to 45 years ago, when crooners like Crosby, Andy Williams, Frank Sinatra, and Dean Martin inhabited the airwaves and defined the holiday soundtrack we grew up with (note that these are Crosby's specials; you'll have to find and purchase your other favorite vocalists separately!).

The quality of the videos vary and the more recent programs are in color while the earlier ones are in B&W; obviously these were videotaped before the advent of HDTV. Nonetheless, all are watchable and the picture is crisp with the sound quality similar to an FM radio broadcast. The content is a bit old-fashsion and some of the story lines seem forced, the pacing slow, and the actors underrehearsed. Still, there's that Bowie/Crosby duet and an amazing Shirley Bassey performance. As a bonus, there's a complete Sinatra/Crosby special which previously was available only as a separate DVD. That program might be the strongest in the collection in terms of entertainment value, but if you love Bing and miss his television specials that heralded the arrival of the Christmas season, you won't be disappointed with this collection.",1422835200,9,1685,5.007142857142857

If you are a hard core Bing fan you will like this.  If you are trying to recapture the wonderful Christmas specials they used to show on television during the 60's and 70's look elsewhere.  The first two specials on this 2 CD set were boring and featured British stars who, with the exception of Terry Thomas, were not known over here in the U.S.",1514332800,,511,4.510869565217392

Robert Goulet was hilarious to watch - the guy was a total ham.  Only complaint: The final special with David Bowie and Twiggy was a bit contrived and the ""Heroes"" video was waaaay out of place, but it was still worth watching.",1486598400,4,398,4.378378378378378
