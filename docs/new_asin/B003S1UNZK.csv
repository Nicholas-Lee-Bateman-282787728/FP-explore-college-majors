4187507,3,B003S1UNZK,"This film is good in many ways, but as a viewer living in the west, I found it to be east-coast biased.  All of Bonds' achievements were a terrible stain and abomination, while the Red Sox winning the world series was glorious.  But both occurred during the steroid era and perhaps neither would've taken place without steroids.  I suppose Bonds' biggest sin was not donning a Red Sox or Yankees uniform; then the eastern media might have treaded more lightly upon him.  The bias of the filmmakers shows through in this production.",1285718400,5,531,4.739130434782608
4187508,5,B003S1UNZK,"An absolutely phenomenal documentary.  Burns capsulizes the game, starting and ending with the greatest microcosm of our (1986-2008) era, Barry Bonds, interspersing him throughout to ground what is an otherwise capacious documentary.  We watch as Bonds rises from his youth into stardom, and as he jealously observes his peers being celebrated for their power rather than his overall mastery of the game.  This is constantly contextualized with looks at such other seminal players of the era--Ichiro, the Braves' phenomenal pitching staff, the great (well, maybe not so much in retrospect) participants of the home run chase--and we understand, if not accept, the circumstances of his meteoric rise and later fall into ignobility.  The parameters of Bonds' career contain within the changes of the game, from steroids to mass popularity, and I thought it was an excellent choice to continually return to Bonds' career throughout to individualize the games' numerous changes.

Burns touches on the world behind, or rather, atop baseball--the Clinton Scandal, 9/11 (a quick aside: I recall when Bonds promised $10,000 for each home run he hit following 9/11 to a victim's fund, and being willing then to forgive the game for all its faults, its greed and its cheating due to its greatest villain's contextualization of his meaningless endeavor; Burns constant progression through events reminds me of my feelings at the time)--but these are not the foci of his documentary; rather, these are considered insofar as they were escaped from in the verdurous, idyllic greens of America's splendid game.

Using such excellent commentators as Keith Olbermann, Mike Barnicle, and John Thorn Burns provides an excellent series of perspectives and related anecdotes on the game to humanize and further contextualize the game's numerous modulations.  Some moments stand out--Olbermann talking to a man in the immediate aftermath of the World Trade Center' attack and Marcos Breton's remembrance of Roberto Clemente were particularly memorable--but each adds to the overall documentary, rather than being the purposeless digressions so often found in other televised documentaries.

Burns captures the game and the country in which it happened for these years, and touches on all the major (some things are certainly dismissed--the Tigers' World Series run (a personal favorite anyway), and the advent of interleague play, among others, but I felt he touched on the most significant events) issues and happenings of its expanses.  This is the first documentary I've seen in which I knew an entire game's status and evolution were captured and saved for future generations while they were happening; for that, I applaud Ken Burns, and for that I recommend it to anyone who loves, has a general interest for, or harbors fond memories of what is still America's pastime.  For any baseball fan, this is a capsule of our game's past 20 years, and it is something I suspect, though not relentlessly watchable, that will invoke these fond memories years from now, when we want to look back at America from the sticky-floored bleachers of the outfield.",1285718400,18,3130,5.292338709677419
4187509,5,B003S1UNZK,"I've had the Ken Burns 9-part (innings) documentary chronicling
the history of what many call ""America's Favorite Past-Time""
on DVD for about 8 years now and I still enjoy watching it
from time to time. When it first aired on PBS back in the
fall of 1994 (during the infamous strike!) , I really
thought it was brilliantly done and was a close second
to his other masterwork ""The Civil War"", which raised
the bar as far as documentary / historical storytelling
with it's innovative mix of period music, photographs,
film clips, newsreels and present day interviews with
either those who survived the particular era or who
are scholars & experts on the particular subject matter.
BASEBALL is no exception, though it wasn't embraced the
way ""Civil War"" was at first. It took a few years before
it began to gain noteriety and appreciation from people
who may have missed it when it first aired.
As of 2010, this whole documentary series is being
remastered, repackaged and re-marketed, for a very
affordable price I may add, to a new generation of
baseball fans, but this time with the long-anticipated
""10th Inning"", which deals with what has happened in
the game (good and bad) from 1992 to the present day.
I have heard so many good things about this addendum
series to the original that I was on the early pre-order
list for it as soon as it came out.
Of course, PBS and Ken Burns will air it all in it's entirety
during the last week of September 2010 if you want to see it
before you buy it. Again, if you like the way Ken Burns
presents his documentary series, and if you're a true
fan of Baseball, you will enjoy the brand new re-mastered,
restored, re-issued DVD version of the original BASEBALL
along with the ""10th Inning"" and 2 1/2 hrs of extras
added in for good measure.
As for me, I will just buy this individually to add to
my original 2002 DVD version since it plays & sounds
just fine to me. A great addition to your DVD collection
that will both entertain & educate. (-:

4187510,5,B003S1UNZK,"This is the very best documentary I have ever watched on any subject, period. That said, let me qualify the statement. I have hundreds of documentaries from the BBC to Errol Morris. ""Planet Earth"" (BBC) is photographically brilliant and David Attenborough is a very good narrator. Errol Morris can make the most mundane subject fascinating with his superb editing. Ken Burns' series on the Civil War was good, but his ""Jazz"" documentary was cursory at best. The recommendations, on Amazon, about this documentary (Baseball) were spot on! It is, in every way, the standard by which I will measure documentaries from this point. I recommend this to any movie lover. One does not have to have an interest in baseball to enjoy it. One may, however, have such an interest after watching this delightful set of DVDs.

(""almost"": since I guess Burns was sleeping with Doris Kearns Goodwin while he was making these, we have to put up with her again, but only for about 90 seconds)

I am docking him one star for missing the opportunity to talk about the Black Sox Curse and Veeck Rhymes With Wreck along with the Curse of the Bambino and the Billy Goat Curse, but the rest of you need to stop bitching about 2003 and 2004. 2003 was the year of the double curse and 2004 was unprecedented so they both merit a generous discussion.",1403395200,,898,4.713375796178344

Be warned.  It is Ken Burns homage to his beloved Red Sox and to east coast elitists.  It is NOT about ''baseball''. Historically flawed.  I felt like I should have gotten this free with my Sports Illustrated subscription in the fall of 2004.

  It is a closed shop in his backwoods Vermont editing room. Still subtly obsessed with race in the 1990's and 2000's.  He doesn't bring his clip board or break down the vitals. Vitals such as massive amounts of steroids and coverup (red sox). Vitals about the decline of participation of black baseball players in the league (because it goes against his false narrative that there is a conspiracy to keep them out) Vitals as not condemning Bud Selig for his altruistic vision and control and coverups in the game that makes enormous amounts of money.  Dissecting the baseball villain is historically important. Selig's corruption and ineptness has his fingerprints all over it.

AND....look no further than the omission of what the Chicago White Sox accomplished in 2005, which arguably, could be more historically significant what the Red Sox did the year before.

Ken Burns has moveable principles......Stick with the CIVIL WAR masterpiece and the NINE INNING version OF BASEBALL....",1397088000,,1357,4.960176991150442

4187524,2,B003S1UNZK,"The Tenth Inning: A-K-A:  Red Sox, Yankees, McGwire, Bonds. The End.

To paraphrase the opening from `The Godfather, ""I believe in (Baseball.)"" I am a huge fan and love the game.

I don't follow any other sports so from November thru April, I have nothing to do. But I spend every winter watching and re-watching the first 9 innings of Ken Burns `Baseball' documentary to get me through the cold winter. I purchased the 10th inning several years back but just now watched it for the first time. While it was `good,' it was not typical Ken Burns and a big departure from the stellar work he did on the first 9 innings.

I found this to be more like perhaps a 2 hour special on ESPN, not a revisit to a truly wonderful piece of work.

I found many things missing that were commonplace and made the 9 innings so popular and so loved. There were no little personal stories, no anecdotes. Nothing from a Harry Hooper or Rube Bressler or other `little known' players that were featured in the original. This only looked at the big stars and big issues--but still avoided many of them.

I realize Mr. Burns is a Red Sox fan and Lynn Novick is a Yankees fan. But I would say that of these 4 hours, roughly about one third was devoted to the Red Sox/Yankees. I truly feel that after Mr. Burns' Red Sox won in 2004, he solely decided this to be the driving force behind the entire ""inning.""

Numerous great players were either completely omitted or just glossed over. Ken Griffey Jr, one of the best and most popular players of the last 25 years got maybe 2 minutes of air time. Tony Gwynn, who compiled the highest BA of the last half century, was not even mentioned. The 1999 All-Star Game including the presentation of the All-Century Team--avoided. The White Sox ending their long drought--not mentioned. The death of Kirby Puckett, one of the games most loved stars--not mentioned. The 2000 World Series, the first subway series in 44 years--not mentioned. Players like Mike Piazza, Frank Thomas, Craig Biggio, Pujols, Robby Alomar, Jim Thome and many others were avoided.

He discussed Ichiro--but failed to mention his greatest achievement--setting the single season record for most hits.
No shout-out to Rickey Henderson becoming the all time SB leader.

The earlier innings relied on music of that era to be heard in the background. There was none of that here. Bruce Springsteen's Glory Days (1984) was played over highlights from 2008. That's like showing images of Vince Coleman with Doo-Wop music in the background.

There was no mention of the dropping of the number of African-American players, teams moving (Montreal to DC), teams changing leagues (Mil moving from the AL to the NL), expansion (Colo, FLA, TB, and AZ) skipped over. The passing of broadcasters Harry Caray and Jack Buck, etc...

Of 30 teams in baseball, I'd say maybe only 5 or 6 were mentioned at all: Yankees, Red Sox, A's and Cardinals (due to McGwire), Cubs (due to Sosa) and Az (cause they beat the Yankees). Dodgers, Padres, teams in FLA, Phillies, Reds, and so on and so on
Personal note: I am a Mets fan and true, over the last 20 years we haven't had much to brag about, especially compared to the Yankees. However, after 9/11, Shea Stadium was the site of the first major sporting event in NY. 50,000+ people gathered 7 miles away as bodies were still being dug up. The Mets won and healed a city with a HR off the bat of Mike Piazza. Shea was, as a matter of fact, the launching point for rescue workers bringing food and supplies into Manhattan. However, that was not brought up. 9/11 happened and they show the Yankees playing in the Chicago.

If this was a 4 hour special on ESPN, I'd have said, `not bad.' But for Ken Burns this was a let down. I'm giving it 2 stars simply cause I love Baseball.

If you're a Yankees fan or a Red Sox fan, you'll enjoy this. If you're a Baseball fan, you may not",1392595200,,3883,4.545845272206304

The director's selective relativism and tendency to confuse a love for baseball with baseballism are more glaring in this installment. The inclusion of some comments from even one theologically conservative, scholarly baseball fan, like Marvin Olasky, would have mitigated this problem. The organization of ""The Tenth Inning"" has changed from the original series, and I miss the accounting of the major events of the day and the coverage of significant deaths. I also miss the eloquence and insight of Red Barber, Charley McDowell and Buck O'Neil, but it's still good for extra bases.

4187536,2,B003S1UNZK,"This one just couldn't live up to what the original series provided. It basically focuses on the steroids controversy and the Red Sox and Yankees. Baseball is a national sport with a lot of stars and a lot of teams and this episode does it absolutely no justice by making it pretty much about Boston and New York. It's bad enough ESPN does it, but I would have thought Ken Burns had a bit more class than that.

To make matters worse the attention brought to the steroid scandal in this episode almost feels like an advertisement in favor of steroids and cheating. Not to mention the amount of time focused on the scandal was simply too much and a lot of that time could have been used exploring the sport more rather than giving irrelevant people like Chris Rock the chance to tell us how much they like steroid use.

There are tidbits that are worth seeing, but unfortunately it was overall worn down by an obsession with the two big market teams that really just buy their way to success, and steroid use. If you liked the original documentary you'd probably do fine without this chapter. I generally have loved Ken Burns work, but he dropped the ball on this one.",1323561600,,1167,4.474178403755869
4187537,1,B003S1UNZK,"The 10th inning is a very disappointing sequel to the much better earlier work of Ken Burns.  The earlier work exploring baseball within the context of racism, labor and the emergence of free agency, was filled with the richness of a sport that has long passed.

I feel that far too much time was spent on the steroid issue.  Far too much time spent on Barry Bonds.  Far too much time wasted watching New York and Boston.

The 10th inning fails to address a major issue - that I believe lower income people are shut out of live viewing due to the outrageous costs of attending a game.  Perhaps the film could have better addressed the lack of a salary cap and how that might have affected ticket prices.  Or interviewed fans unable to afford attending a game.

A better documentary would have included an exploration into the decline of African-American participation in baseball since the last film.

I also found it offensive that I had to see, once again, the horrible film of planes crashing into the twin towers.  That was totally inappropriate.

The ""10th Inning"" is nothing more than a highlight film coupled with the steroid drama and favoring the highlights of the big market teams.  Again the film ignores the Chicago Whitesox.

Unbelievable!!  The 2005 Whitesox had one of the most dominating post seasons of any team in history and with low salary base and team with players long gone.

Also why no mention of great players like future hall of famer Frank Thomas, whose great achievements were accomplished without the use of performance enhancing drugs?  I counted about 4 seconds devoted to the 2005 Sox and no mention of the ""Big Hurt."".",1307404800,9,1652,4.723776223776224

4187539,5,B003S1UNZK,"When Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" series first aired on PBS, I never missed a night and I was sure glad I didn't. Last year I treated myself to the DVD boxed set and this year, I picked up his follow-up piece, ""Baseball: The Tenth Inning"".

This one deals with the modern game - specifically how the use of steroids affected the game, it's prized statistics that allowed us to compare players over different generations, and how they changed how we look at baseball in general. It is easily up there with Burns' best work.

The research that went into ""The Tenth Inning"" must have been thorough because the results are a comprehensive analysis of the modern game with its performance enhancing drug use, ridiculous salaries, new 'retro' stadiums and MLB player contract disputes. It isn't all bad however. There's some marvelous detail on players who did it the right way and how good they made we baseball fans feel with the way they handled themselves as players and as men.

Some highlights on these two DVSs include a recap of the McGuire/Sosa single season HR record, a brief comparison between Ken Griffey, Jr. and Barry Bonds, a nice profile of Ichiro Suzuki and his impact on the style of play by some winning teams, a tour of Fenway Park that's tucked in the Special Features section on the 1st of the two DVDs in this set - and these are all set to great background music throughout.

The 2nd disc includes details the recent World Series title won by the Boston Red Sox and it is at turns funny as hell and also heartwarming. Based on what's revealed here, it could be the most publicly popular major sports title ever won by a professional team. Even if you're not a Red Sox fan, it's a great story very well told.

And that is Ken Burns' major contribution to us, isn't it? He has that talent of making history interesting and captivating, and I don't know how you put a price tag on that.

I think that, even if you didn't see any of his original ""Baseball"" chapters, this one is strong enough to stand on its own. It's that good.

You've already gotten the picture, clearly, that it has a very lop-sided focus on the Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees, and, of course, the steroid story. And the steroid story. And, MORE steroid story....

There was very little information about the expansion teams, but there was an interesting look at Atlanta's pitchers. Burns did add a small addition for the Florida Marlins.  The Marlins were good for about four minutes because Ray Huizenga bought high-priced talent and won two World Series, in '97, and in '03. A lttle bit was added about Arizona because of Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, and nothing else.  The Colorado Rockies, alone in the ""Time Zone Without A Team"" got no air-time at all.

I have the original ""Baseball"" and ""Civil War"" sets on DVD, and I treasure both of them.  I look back now at Burns' earlier work, back when those monumental, great works were made, and find them to be far superior in research, production, interviews and commentary, and overall quality to his later efforts, such as ""The War"", and this unsatisfying followup on baseball, ""The Tenth Inning"".

It almost came across as obsessive about New York and Boston....Geeesh. Below are just some random complaints and things that come to mind about this film

01. There was no reason why they needed to spend so much time on the 2003 ALCS. It was worth mentioning how the Sox blew it and bounced back the following year but come on. That was wasted time.

02. Almost nothing on the 2005 White Sox. The time they spent rambling on about the 2003 ALCS could have been relegated to discussing the White Sox winning their first WS since 1917. This ending ANOTHER drought that began a year before the Red Sox.

03. The Phillies. They are a classic franchise that had only one World title under their belt until 2009. They were barely mentioned.

04. During the introduction, the narrator said that the Brewers were the only team to switch major leagues. This is false. There were plenty of teams that switched major leagues. The Reds, Cardinals, Dodgers & Pirates were some of them.

05. While steroids were certainly a subject that should have been covered, this film went on-and-on about it. I kept finding myself saying ""move on, we got it. Less talk about steroids, more talk about the teams.""

06. Despite the advantage of high payroll teams, the 2000's had a colorful collection of teams winning pennants and World titles. A number of teams winning their first pennant and/or WS. While other teams won their first pennant or WS in years. This would have been good territory to cover instead of rambling on about steroids......And ho-hum.....the Yankees & Red Sox.

07. I wish that Ken Burns would have produced this film with the same style and with the same narrator as the original series. I realize that Ken Burns has altered his style since 1994, but this film doesn't really seem to mesh well with the original series. It almost stands alone and unfortunately it doesn't stand alone very well let alone being part of the original series.",1295568000,,2114,4.681940700808625
4187545,4,B003S1UNZK,"The Tenth Inning isn't anything close to the engrossing, nostalgic, and enriching series from 1994, but has its great moments nonetheless. In a nutshell, this series centers around the evolution of Barry Bonds (his childhood, his father Bobby's influence in shaping him into the person he is, and how all of this is relevant to what is wrong with the game even to this day). Yes, a lot of things have happened to our game in the past 20 years, most of which are negative. However, this series manages to show the viewer how baseball continually manages to dig itself out of the holes it puts itself into time and time again. Whether it was the crippling strike of 1994 (which had no real substance), or the steroid problem that arguably started in order to help bring the game back to prominence (via home runs) after the strike, we're reminded that the game is human, and the players are just as flawed as the common folk. It was particularly refreshing to see the fans' revolt during and after the strike, and how they felt about the business and politics of baseball. Then along came Ripken's streak, and how it saved the game, as Cal Ripken had a wholesome image. In the end, the fans are in charge of the game, because without them, the sport wouldn't exist. I also like the stern stances that people like Bob Costas and Howard Bryant (the 2 stars of the show, in my opinion) take when referring to the steroids controversy. My favorite line of the series comes from Bob Costas: ""They didn't notice a damn thing when guys showed up looking like they had been inflated with bicycle pumps."" Also, Howard Bryant wasn't shy in expressing his disdain for Barry Bonds eclipsing Henry Aaron's home run record by saying that he didn't care, or he couldn't tell you where he was when the record was broken, or not having his son stay up to watch. One thing that is perplexing to me is the absence of mentioning the 2006 Tigers and 2005 White Sox. In 2006, the Tigers made it all the way to the World Series after losing 119 games just 3 years earlier. Furthermore, they were playing the Cardinals, who had Tony LaRussa as their manager, while the Tigers had Jim Leyland. One of those guys was going to become just the second manager in history to win a World Series in both leagues (Sparky Anderson was the first, who incidentally was the Tigers' manager in 1984 when he set the record). Also, the White Sox finally won a World Series after waiting 88 years......well sort of waited 88 years (they should've won in 1919, but we all know that story).I'm surprised that the producers of this series mentioned Albert Belle's corked bat incident, but not the above-mentioned stuff. What's so relevant about a teammate breaking into an umpire's locker to steal a corked bat? Was it to depict cheating in baseball? A snowballing into cheating in other areas of the game?  One thing that we do not want to overlook is the fact that this series will never be as enriching as the first, because were talking about only 20 years of baseball history. Overall, this series is still entertaining. I just wish that they had spent a little more time on what's relevant besides the steroids era, the strike, McGwire and Sosa, Joe Torre and the Yankees, and the Red Sox. 8/10",1295136000,,3254,4.58147512864494

Just goes to show you how much he is hated.  It's sad because it's just a game.  In the previous 9 innings, Burns devotes a whole inning on Babe Ruth, and rightfully so he was the player who changed everything. He also devoted a whole inning to Jackie Robinson, he also changed baseball forever. So he did the same thing with Bonds, which is respectable and honest. I like how they chose not to start out talking about the Bonds of the 2000's like many critics do, but Burns decides to talk about Bond's childhood and what America's racism and alcohol (which used to be in MLB dugouts back in the day) did to his dad, Bobby.  I like how they mentioned the Giants and Bonds of the 90's and how he basically kept the Giants in San Fransico.  The inning also brought back the Yanks and the Sox, 911, and the money in baseball and the new stadiums.  Of course the steroid era dominates the inning, and of course it leads back to many of those great players related to the juice including Bonds. It's ironic that the Giants cover guy was mentioning how long will it be till they win a World Series, when his prayers have been answered after the release of the DVD. I took 1 star off because Burns didn't have the guts to put Bonds on the cover (he shouldn't have covered so much on the guy if he wasn't going to put him on the cover), instead he put Griffey another great player in the era. He was only tainted by Astro-turf, those guys who created it also hurt the game. So it's a marketing tool, I understand!",1292025600,,1680,4.264150943396227

That being writ, the joy and drama and insight that are brought to bear in the time that Ken is given to work with, makes for compelling viewing.

That the Red Sox and Yankees get a lot of focus here should surprise no one. The Yankees basically owned the 90's and the Red Sox were the best story in the game from 2003-2007.

What fascinates most in watching the 10th inning is the pace of the project. I had forgotten what a master Burns is at slowing things down without being boring.

This movie has a similar feel to the previous entries, but with new twists and since it is the most contemporary of the Ken Burns' films, it comes across as fresh. (it was interesting to hear more contemporary music in a burns film!)

4187559,3,B003S1UNZK,"Congratulations, Ken Griffey Jr., You made the cover of The 10th Inning... and that's about it. The man who is arguably the greatest player of his era in light of the steroids scandal is talked about as much in a documentary covering the years 1992-2009 as Roberto Clemente, who died in 1972. In contrast, Barry Bonds hit 168 home runs from 2000-2002 and I'm reasonably sure Burns shows footage of every single one after spending 10 minutes talking about his childhood, college career, and early pro career in Pittsburgh.
  John Chancellor passed away in 1996 and is replaced as narrator by Keith David, which by itself gives this chapter a different feel than previous ones and it might take another viewing to adjust to the change. One thing that didn't change was Burns' obsession with beating particular topics HE cares about to death. After spending 2 chapters respectively bludgeoning us with ridiculous stories of Babe Ruth hitting balls into orbit and Satchel Paige throwing pitches that broke the sound barrier, 3/4 of this 4 hour installment is spent on Bonds, McGwire/Sosa and the Red Sox/Yankees rivalry.
The only redeeming qualities of The Tenth Inning are the great coverage of the 2001 season in the wake of 9/11 and the interviews with Joe Torre, Pedro Martinez, Kieth Olbermann and a few others.

4187561,5,B003S1UNZK,"Is it possible to call something much anticipated that wasn't a certainty until 18 months before its release?  Well, I am.

Ken Burns has made quite a name for himself over the last 20+ years and arguably his greatest work was the nine part ""Baseball"" released in 1994.  For me, an avid fan of the game, there is no argument.  ""Baseball"" successfully told the story of the game and made a star out of its greatest ambassador, Buck O'Neil, for which I'll be forever grateful of Burns.  The massive undertaking could have easily been a flop.  As long and expansive a documentary it is, it was destined to leave things out as Burns attempted to condense a century-plus into one feature.  Maybe there were criticisms at the time, it's hard to remember, but certainly over the past 16 years the work has become almost hallowed and flawless in the eyes of baseball fans.

To say I was elated when Burns announced in early 2009 that a tenth inning was in the works would be a tragic understatement.  Of course, I was greatly disappointed to learn it would be over a year before the Tenth Inning would be completed but, as they say, good things come to those who wait.

I'm going to go ahead and get it out of the way right now, but the biggest piece of criticism I have seen thus  far is that Burns, an avid Red Sox fan, spends too much time on his favorite team's triumph in 2004.  The Tenth Inning is two discs in length and comprises 240 minutes of content.  Burns spends almost exactly 20 minutes on the 2004 Red Sox, and 10 minutes on the 2003 ALCS loss to the Yankees.  Twenty minutes for the biggest on-field story of the past two decades seems about right to me.  And there is no doubt in my mind that if Burns wasn't an open Red Sox fan there would be little discussion of how much time is spent on that fateful October in 2004.  ESPN and the media in general have force-fed the general public Sox/Yanks and in the reaction to the coverage received some fans are taking out their frustrations on Ken Burns unjustly.

In truth, none of us are truly capable of accurately saying how successful Burns is with Tenth Inning.  The material has not had enough time to sit and reveal what will be remembered about this era.  For the 90's, I think it's a bit clearer and Burns covers the big topics: The Strike, Griffey, the Braves, Yankees, the '98 home run race, and Bonds.  For the 2000 decade, there's the previously mentioned Sox triumph, as well as the 2001 post season, steroids, Pedro, Ichiro, Balco, the Mitchell Report, and more Bonds.

There's little to quibble with.  I'm sure each fan will feel something is missing or wasn't covered enough.  I personally would have liked a few notes about the All Century Team and another chance to see that great footage of the game's greats gathered around an aging Ted Williams.  The feature is very light on the current stars but I think that approach is proper.  While Joe Mauer and Chase Utley could very well go down as some the best to play their position, we just don't know yet and if they do achieve such greatness their story will be told when all is said and done.  I suppose some time could have been given to Albert Pujols, since he's already cemented a good chunk of his legacy, and I would have liked to see something on the Hall of Fame and the infamous (and heart-breaking) snub of Buck O'Neil.  I also wish Burns had found a better story-teller for the Red Sox portion than disgraced former Globe columnist Mike Barnicle (was Peter Gammons not available?).

Ultimately though, Ken Burns has accomplished what he set out to in providing a snap-shot of the past two decades and has created something every bit as good as his previous effort.  The Tenth Inning fits in seamlessly with the original nine installments and has, if nothing else, given everyone a great excuse to go back and re-watch the previous installments.  As is the case with most things, if you're already a fan of the previous works you'll find plenty to enjoy here.",1287273600,,3994,4.499306518723994

How about the Phillies in 2008? How about the White Sox breaking a DECADES long (longer than the Red Sox) drought to win the world series. How about Albert Pujols, arguably the best player of the past decade, who IS NOT EVEN MENTIONED? How about the Rockies winning 20 games in 21 days to go to the World Series in 2007? That is a damn good story, and there are plenty more from the past decade that were left out. I hate to break it to Ken Burns, but Baseball does happen outside of the Northeast...some darn good baseball actually.

I think this chapter focused too much on the negative, and not enough on the positive, for example Barry Bonds got easily 30 minutes of coverage, while Ken Griffey Jr, Cal Ripken Jr, and Ichiro Suzuki got maybe 2 minutes each.

As fans, we know good and well what's cheating and what isn't. They cheated.
And, guess what? That's part of what this film documents.
Cal Ripken was a damn fine ball player. And Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire brought a whole lot of smiles and good feeling to a checkered part of baseball history. What else? Keith Olbermann, Tom Boswell, Joe Torre and Pedro Martinez are eloquent spokesmen for the game.

4187567,3,B003S1UNZK,"After watching ""The Tenth Inning"", two things become obvious. Ken Burns loves baseball and Ken Burns loves the Boston Red Sox. It was understandable to devote time to how long Boston Red Sox fans suffered until 2004. However, no time was devoted to other teams whose histories are worthy of some attention in this film. It is unforgivable that no mention was made of the Chicago White Sox, who actually went longer (88 years) without a world series title than the Red Sox before finally winning it all in 2005. Burns made time for the Chicago Cubs, yet not the White Sox. There was also nothing about the 2000 World Series, which was the first between two teams from the same city in 44 years. Although Burns did acknowledge (and rightfully so) Cal Ripken, who is one of the few players who play for the right reasons, no mention is made of the decline of the Baltimore Orioles, which is due entirely to one man; Peter Angelos. Angelos is one of the most frugal and cheap owners in baseball who not once has ever paid for a top tier free agent. The Orioles were a perennial powerhouse from the mid 60's to the end of the 70's and since Angelos bought the team have literally become what they originally were: the St. Louis Browns. Conversely, no mention is made of the Minnesota Twins, who despite playing in a small market with a limited budget, have been a contender throughout the last ten years because of great front office and management. With four hours alotted for a 16 year period, there is no excuse for all of these omissions. Apparently Ken Burns doesn't understand or doesn't care that baseball does not revolve around the Red Sox and Yankees.

4187568,3,B003S1UNZK,"This will likely be an unpopular review, but I must be honest. ""Baseball: The Tenth Inning"" does not hold a candle to the original series. While the ""Top of the Tenth"" is pretty good - ""The Bottom of the Tenth"" is essentially a retelling of the steroids controversy and the Yankee/Red Sox rivalry.  I will admit that these are the two biggest stories between 1999-2009 but it certainly is not the only stories -

Things that were neglected

- Only 10 seconds devoted to the White Sox World Series victory in 2005 breaking their 88 year drought between championships.
- No mention of the Detroit Tigers - One of the most interesting stories of the decade was how the Tigers went from an 119 loss season in 2003 to a World Series appearance in 2006? The 2006 series between the Tigers/Cardinals was a rematch of the classic '68 Fall Classic - however, less than 5 seconds of the 2006 World Series is shown.
- Never mentions the rise of Tampa Bay as a powerhouse
- Excludes the Minnesota Twins.... and their stars Joe Mauer, Johnan Santana, or Justn Morneau. The Twins and Oakland A's of the 2000-2010 were the antithesis of the Yankees and Red Sox , and despite not winning a World Series they should be considered as two of the dominant teams.
- No mention of Miguel Cabrera, Carl Crawford, Paul Konerko, Trevor Hoffman, Jim Thome, any of the Twins, or really any player who was unfortunate enough not to play on one of the coasts.
- The only player interviewed is Pedro Martinez... which is a great choice... but why couldn't players be interviewed?
- Why not have a segment on the announcers of the period... no Harey Caray, Ernie Harwell, Vin Scully, or Jack Buck

While it is missing many key ingredients there are moments that help you remember the magic of Ken Burns. The highlight of the 4 hours is the McGwire/Sosa homerun chase of 1998. Burns is able to tell the story with passion and reminds us how exciting September 1998 really was. Burns also does a great job in the telling of the 1994 strike and the angst that it created. I certainly do not have an issue with the time spent on the Yankees (they are unquestionably the team of the period) but it seems like 50% of the time is devoted to the Yankees and their rivals ...the Red Sox. I agree with one of the over-riding themes of the documentary - this was an golden era for baseball, but why wasn't more time given to what truly made it a golden era?

Final Verdict - Maybe my expectations were too high, but I can help but be disappointed in the amount of material that Ken Burns left out of the documentary. It is interesting but it is far from being the definitive documentary of this period... at least I hope so!

Granted, it has a tough act to follow from the original 1994 documentary, not to mention the difficult and dark chapter of baseball (and steroid use) that it needed to cover.

After all, it's not Ken Burns' fault that the sport was riddled with steroids in the 90s and last decade...but the issue simply resurfaces again, again, and again throughout the 4 hour historical overview.  Yes, juicing was very significant...yes, right or wrong (right IMO) Bonds and Clemens were the poster children of it all...and yes, sacred records were tainted.  Any fan with half a heartbeat knew about it at the time.

I guess it's in the truest corners of a documentarian's heart - and Burns is one of the all-time best - to be truthful and tell us what we don't want to know...as I guess someone needs to deliver the bad news...but this unrelenting slap in the face from the steroids salami was a bit too much, and the documentary suffers as a result.

This episode (apparently there will be an 11th inning in x number of years) dwells a bit too much on the negative, when it should have focused more on players who didn't juice.

There's adequate coverage of what couldn't be avoided, such as the 90s Braves and Yankees teams, the 2004 Red Sox overcoming their curse, the Yanks/Red Sox rivalry coming to a head, an interesting overview of Latin players like Pedro Martinez, and the arrival of Ichiro.  However...many of the games great players in the span of time covered are mentioned, albeit briefly.  Griffey Jr. is given a speedy highlight reel at best and another honorable mention, but only in a McGwire/Sosa context.

Edgar Martinez, arguably the best right-handed hitter of the era, is mentioned once - ONCE! - with no highlight reels.  Where's Bagwell and Biggio?  Why couldn't we focus more on the careers of pitchers like Randy Johnson and other guys who DIDN'T juice?  What about the evolution and critical role of bullpens and workhorse veterans like Arthur Rhodes?  Frank Thomas, Jim Thome, and Albert Pujols with no mention?  You're kidding, right?  Oh yeah, then we get to hear about Roger Clemens again...oh yeah, then more doping...oh, here we go with more on Bonds and his egocentric locker room pontificating.  Really?!  Really?!

Come on, Ken, you're killing me.  You had 4 hours to play with here.

The issues lie in the sloppy editing job, and there's factual errors.  The 2001, 2002 and 2004 playoffs drag on waaaaay too long, esp. '01, and I was at those Games 2 & 7, lol (my point being that if anyone should find those events to be important, it would be me...but it's still TOO FRIGGIN LONG!  Oh, and there's an error, the D-Backs did it in 4 seasons, not 5)  ...and why are we going on and on about the Giants franchise?  Huh?  I realize you can't cover everything and everyone...but Burns could have given 90s Griffey Jr. more time and covered the other players I mentioned if there had been even a modest trimming of that other material.

See this if you're a baseball purist, but take a horse tranquilizer first, as you're about to relive the horror of steroids and tainted records.  An average delivery by Burns, but I realize I'm probably shooting the messenger a bit...but it's because the messenger wouldn't shut his mouth about the bad news and kept popping off like a Pez dispenser.",1285718400,9,3432,4.6923076923076925
