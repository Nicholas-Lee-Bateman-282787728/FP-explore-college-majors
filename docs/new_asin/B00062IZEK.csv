2161036,3,B00062IZEK,is Dusty's Trail. Situations here are slightly more believable. The non-Bob Denver actors are all about as good as the GI cast (though Ivor Francis as rich Mr. Brookhaven is a little inferior to Jim Backus as Mr. Howell). This is one of Denver's better post-GI efforts as he shines very well as Dusty. I just bought this on DVD having seen four DT series eps strung together on VHS minus the laugh track (which was put back on this DVD version). I love DT.,1112400000,7,456,4.376470588235295
2161037,2,B00062IZEK,"Ummm...for this to be labled as a ""classic TV"" show may be a bit of a stretch.  Now I'm operating on memory here as this show goes back some 30 years or so to the mid 1970's.

Basically the show is Gilligan's Island in the west.  Except rather than being marooned on an Island, it's the story of a carriage lost in the west journeying from town to town.

Bob Denver reprises his Gilligan role, this time as Dusty one of the inept carriage drivers who constantly bungles everything.  Forrest Tucker basically plays the Alan Hale Jr. role as the other driver and boss who is always yelling and blaming Gilligan...err...Dusty for everything.

The passengers of the wagon match..almost exactly those found on Gilligan with the rich person, the starlet, the country girl, etc...

I mean I guess for the price it's not a bad deal but you really...REALLY have to be a huge fan I would say...",1097452800,7,884,4.556962025316456
2161116,5,B00062IZEK,"Any show with Lori Saunders is ok with me.  I love her.  What a talanted, beautiful lady.  I love this show.  I met her once and she gave me an autographed photo of the whole cast from this show. It hangs in our living room.",1313280000,4,224,3.911111111111111
2161117,4,B00062IZEK,"This syndicated comedy-western was created by Sherwood Schwartz who gave the world ""Gilligan's Island"", and ""The Brady Bunch"".  He also wrote for comedian Red Skelton. While the storyline and characters are clearly Gilligan in spurs- ""Dusty's Trail"" is a bit better than ""Gilligan"". No high comedy here, but some funny moments. So, if you like TV's original ""Batman"", ""Car 54 Where Are You"", ""Gilligan"" or even ""The Three Stooges"", you'll like Dusty. Most sitcoms from the 1960-70s really can't be compared to contemporay, ""social issues"" sitcoms.  It is a different animal. Shows like ""Laverne and Shirley"" and ""Welcome Back Kotter"" were not as sexually suggestive or slick as what is produced today. Pre Norman Lear era shows had no sub-text, no agenda (should one think Lear was apolitical, watch a rerun of ""All In The Family"", ""Maude"" or ""Mary Hartman""). That is what is great about some of these older, broad-comedy shows- you are free from being subtly subjected to what is ""correct"" thinking and what is not. I saw this series when it was in first run when I was 14. Decades later, I still enjoy it.",1297987200,3,1107,4.882978723404255
2161118,5,B00062IZEK,Love this series and the dvd's I received through Amazon.com were just what I wanted...Definitely will shop with Amazon again and again...Thanks...,1284940800,,147,5.7272727272727275
2161119,3,B00062IZEK,"You can tell by the title of this DVD set this is one of the lamest sitcoms ever. And I agree completely, but somehow I just don't hate it. The acting (besides Bob Denver's) is pretty bad, the chemistry between Bob Denver and Alan Hale's was way better...WAY better than Bob Denver and Forrest Tucker's, and last but not least it's a pitiful knockoff of Gilligan's Island. So it's no surprise this show was canceled after its first season. Each character is like a replica of the Gilligan's Island characters, I just had to shake my head when Ginger uh...I mean ""Lulu"" would use her charms on Gilligan...darn...""Dusty"" to get what she needed. And that's not the only similarities to Gilligan's Island, there's an educated man, two millionaires, and a farmer's daughter. Sherwood Schwartz (the creator of Gilligan's Island) obviously lost his creativity; in fact it would have been better to make a new Gilligan's Island show. Who cares if the cast aged, it would still be better. Alright, alright, I know it sounds like I hate this show but I really don't, it still makes me laugh and Dusty's Trail does have its little moments.

This DVD has seventeen episodes of the twenty-six episodes from season one. There's no way to buy the other nine episodes in their original form, but you can get four of the episodes in a ""movie"" called the Wackiest Wagon Train in the West. It includes four episodes edited together and it is an hour and a half movie. Now back to this DVD release, the episodes are blurry and grainy and the sound is muffled, so it's obviously these episodes did not get any treatment. There are two double sided discs, but unfortunately no episode descriptions. I'll list the episode descriptions for the episodes on this set below just in case you want to know. (I doubt it)

If you're desperate for a show exactly like Gilligan's Island, but already own Gilligan' Island I recommend it, for everyone else in the world...no.",1279411200,11,4947,4.665517241379311
2161120,3,B00062IZEK,"This is an interesting series (one season), because it is sort of a bridge between the more prolific time of westerns in the 1960s and the development of situation comedies in the 1970s up through the 1980s. There is a Loni Anderson look-alike, who pre-figures the real Loni Anderson who came along later in ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" and some episodes remind me of ""The Wild Wild West"" and ""Bonanza"" mixed with community theater. It's a pleasant romp through the Not-So-Wild West that is clean family fare. I smiled through most of the episodes and laughed at one or two jokes each episode. It's not knee-slapping humor, but all of the actors do their best with the scripts. I have read other reviews which say it is like ""Gilligan's Island"" meets the Old West, and as far as character personalities go, that is probably true. It might do well as a foundation for someone who wants to write a western melodrama, which is what I bought it for, again noting the funniest lines occurring at about two per episode. I think this show would have lasted 2 seasons if the beginning credits had been filmed with a little more action and closer up, rather than a hazy long shot of an anonymous wagon train coming down switchbacks on a hill. The opening song is more of a trail song and not a theme song that pulls people in to watch, although I enjoyed it. If you're a Bob Denver or Forrest Tucker fan, or a person who likes to watch all kinds of westerns, this is for you.",1250812800,2,1458,4.464419475655431
2161121,2,B00062IZEK,"Sherwood Schwartz is probably best known for his TV classics Gilligan's Island and The Brady Bunch.  Together with his son Elroy, Schwartz adapts the Gilligan premise to a Western setting, and the result is Dusty's Trail.  Blatantly repeating himself, many elements from Gilligan are also incorporated into Dusty's Trail, where a group of travelers are separated from a California bound wagon train.

Bob Denver, Gilligan himself, stars as Dusty, an error-prone scout.  F Troop alum Forrest Tucker is wagonmaster Callahan, the leader of the party of seven, that also includes wealthy Carson Brookhaven (Ivor Francis) and his wife Daphne (Lynn Wood), fellow travelers Andy (William Cort), schoolteacher Betsy (Lori Saunders), and dancehall performer Lulu McQueen (Jeannie Riley).  Saunders and Riley were both Bradley girls on Petticoat Junction.

The characters almost mirror those on the Gilligan's Island, and while the cast is a capable, mostly experienced group, the formula does not work very well a second time.  The series generally suffers from weak writing, where ideas used in Gilligan's Island are often recycled.  Some of the more successful elements from Gilligan's Island, however, are absent from Dusty's Trail.  One very cool thing about Gilligan's Island, was the outstanding guest stars that spiced up the proceedings, and took things to a different level.  Dusty's Trail has no big name guest stars.  Another element was the dream and fantasy sequences, which made many episodes of Gilligan, truly memorable classics.  One would think that the producers would have gone with what worked well before, but perhaps the budget would not allow for this.  One thing best left in the past, is apparently a favorite gimmick of Mr. Schwartz . . . actors in animal suits! (ugghh!!)  In this case, we get a bear and a gorilla.

Dusty is less juvenile than Gilligan, and his screw ups do not have the same life or death implications.  The boisterous Tucker and `little pal' Denver, have a less demonstrative relationship than that between the Skipper and Gilligan, with the slapstick elements favored by Alan Hale Jr. being absent.  The focus is spread out among the cast, but unfortunately the lackluster writing and dopey dialog, really doesn't give the actors very much to work with.  The relationship between the Brookhavens is explored a bit, and Andy is featured, but Betsy and Lulu are mostly passed over.

The 17 episodes do not have chapters or subtitles.  The double-sided two disc set is relatively inexpensive, but the picture and sound quality of is poor, comparable to blurry VHS.  Mildly entertaining, this series may be of interest to fans of Bob Denver, Gilligan's Island, F Troop, or Petticoat Junction.",1239408000,,2728,5.1826484018264845
2161122,4,B00062IZEK,"as everyone has said this is a short lived series by the same people who gave us gilligan's island, and it's the same show just out west.i think they even used some of the same scripts,they used the same extras , and the laugh track is even the same i think.

  now to be fair, i'm a father of two boys and my wife and i try to keep them from most of the shows on tv at this time,so we use dvd's of our favorate old shows as things they can watch. they have loved gilligan's island and i remember this show from when it came out in the 70's.

  it's not as good and is even by gilligan standerds silly, but it has a so bad it's good charm and the late bob denver did have a natural charm and apeal on the tube.for the skipper role of wagon master f-troop star and underrated actor forrest tucker was cast and he was very good i think in this very silly role. the others, a rich man and his wife, a saloon girl ,a school teacher i think she was , and a very smart farmer make up the rest of a wagon train that is lost from the rest of the party and wanders thru the west looking for california.

  like i said the stories are very much like gilligan's and so this is not a show for everyone, and classic by no means,but it is slap stick and corn and my young sons will set with me and we all laugh at the silly stories. that makes it one i own and enjoy very much.

  like i said , not everyone is going to like it and it is very much a come down from gilligan's island,but my boys and i like it and we have family movie and popcorn night with this and other old shows on friday night. an added bonus is that i don't have to worry about bad words or other non kid friendly things poping up and can leave the room for a second and not worry, so that gets this low-brow series 4 stars and a thank you from this parent",1143417600,15,1814,3.872972972972973

2161124,3,B00062IZEK,"Dusty's Trail is a sitcom where Bob Denver plays a simple-minded, accident prone sidekick to the leader of a group of desperate people.  The leader refers to Denver as his ""little pal"" (gee, that sounds familiar).  The people they are leading consists of a cross section of American society; a rich man and his wife, a well educated professional, an entertainer and a simple country girl (I swear, I've heard this before).  They have many wacky adventures.  In one episode, one of the women is carried off by an escaped gorilla.  In another episode, they are threatened by a soon-to-erupt volcano (I know I've heard this somewhere before, I just can't place it).

Okay, let's be frank, ""Dusty's Trail"" is painfully derivative, and never aspires for a minute to be anything but low-grade slapstick silliness.  Even so, it's not that bad.  The two leads are Bob Denver and Forrest Tucker, two very well established comic actors.  Tucker plays a dedicated straight man, unlike the Skipper from -that other sitcom- who shared a ""Laurel and Hardy"" relationship with Denver.  The rest of the cast ranges from ""quite enjoyable"" to ""competently managing the role they were handed.""  The plots are ridiculous, but pleasant brain candy and simple enough for kids to appreciate.

Despite what it says on the DVD cover, ""Dusty's trail"" is not classic TV.  Frankly, it's not even above average.  Still, if you have some pocket change to blow, and you are curious what Bob Denver was doing in the early 70's, you might give this largely forgotten series a try.  This set would be especially good as a companion piece to that other Bob Denver series, you know the one.",1128816000,14,1653,4.832740213523132
2161125,2,B00062IZEK,"I remember seeing a few episodes of this when I was nine years old --- I thought it was stupid even then.  I would imagine that the core demographic for this type of show would be your younger set, so if a nine-year-old found it to be stupid, it is not surprising that the show quickly sank like a rock.

Few shows were as totally derivative as this one.  Everything was so obviously an attempt to duplicate ""Gilligan's Island"" --- with a little ""F Troop"" thrown in, perhaps --- that every viewer with any sort of memory would realize that it has all been done before.  Even Gilligan fans found this to be stupid.

I can't imagine that anybody but the most hardcore of Bob Denver fans would feel the need to acquire this.  The only good thing one can say about this is that it is cheap, but I am amazed that anybody saw fit to release this on DVD.  Good grief.",1117756800,6,860,4.2392638036809815
8037170,5,B00062IZEK,"This 1973-1974 western clone of Gilligan's Island (same producer, same story, same characters) is funny enough if one is eccentric and likes simple comedy.  While, to be honest, it's not that great overall, Bob Denver and Forrest Tucker are (as expected) good in their roles.  This 17-episode ""The Almost Complete First (and only) Season"" DVD set contains all 12 of the episodes that are on Alpha Video's 3-volume Dusty's Trail set, plus 5 more; one of the other reviewers lists the specific titles.  Both this DVD set and the 3-volume Alpha issue are missing episodes 1, 2, and 8 (among others), but evidently the 1979 movie ""The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West"" (available on DVD) is essentially a compilation of episodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.  So, get this set, plus the movie, and one will essentially have 20 of the 26 episodes!

Instead of seven luckless castaways marooned on a tropical isle, it's the same number of folks in a wagon train lost out in the wilderness. Rather than BOB DENVER as bumbling, clueless first mate GILLIGAN, it's BOB DENVER as bumbling, clueless trail scout DUSTY (not much of a stretch for the man who once shone as beatnik MAYNARD G. KREBS). Authentic western actor FORREST TUCKER is the often exasperated, but protective wagon master, a cross between the SKIPPER and his SGT. O'ROURKE character from F TROOP. Along for the ride are a stuffy rich couple (including ROOM 222 regular IVOR FRANCIS putting on his best THURSTON HOWELL III face), an intellectual, and a pair of bodacious babes, played by two of the PETTICOAT JUNCTION sisters (JEANNINE RILEY and LORI SAUNDERS).

8037176,3,B00062IZEK,I was a huge Gilligan's Island fan growing up so when I came across Dusty's Trail I just had to check it out.  It basically IS Gilligan's Island but with a different cast and mainly filmed in a studio.  The humor is poor at best and obviously a laugh track is used because I found nothing particularly funny while viewing it.  No wonder it was canceled after only 17 episodes.,1381104000,2,376,4.3428571428571425
8037177,3,B00062IZEK,"Most people who are reading about this show probably already know that it was a 1974 western comedy produced by Sherwood and Eli Schwartz. Sherwood, of course, produced and created both this program and Gilligan's Island. Yes, it is a carbon copy of Gilligan's Island only now in the west with different actors other than Bob Denver who plays Dusty. (Gilligan). Forrest Tucker is Mr. Callahan (Skipper), Ivor Francis and Lynn Wood are Carson and Daphne Brookhaven (The Howells), Jeannie Riley is Lulu McQueen (Ginger), Bill Cort is Andy Boone (professor) and Lori Saunders is Betsy McGuire (Mary Ann). The show ran for only one season consisting of 26 shows but was originally intended to have 30 episodes. It never made the top 50 in the ratings but even that isn't terrible for a first run syndicated program such as this one was.
The major problems with this show is that there was no chemistry between any of the characters. They really didn't have a personality. None of the shows really seemed to focus on any one character to bring them out other than Dusty and Mr. Callahan. And they also just were nothing more than cardboard cutouts. Gilligan was Skipper's little buddy whereas Dusty is Callahan's little 'pal'.
If you are a Gilligan's Island fan you probably will want to have this in your DVD collection just because of its Gilligan theme. Another reason personally for me watching the show is that I always had a 'crush' on Dawn Wells (Mary Ann) and Lori Saunders (Betsy).Lori played Bobbie Jo Bradley on ""Petticoat Junction"". I always felt that they are the two most beautiful women from the 60s and even was envious that Bob Denver was able to work with both of them on different shows.
Despite its failures it still is watchable and even enjoyable--just don't have high expectations. I am definitely unhappy that this is not a complete set of all 26 episodes. I don't know why the other nine are not available and I don't know where to find them either. This is one of the reasons I gave it 3 stars. I know it was in public domain but I still thought all the episodes could be found in some form or another. I always want complete sets.
So, it's still clean comedy and worth taking a look at if you enjoy silly comedies. I recommend it for those reasons alone.",1379376000,,2276,4.622222222222222
