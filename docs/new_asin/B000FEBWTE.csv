2562153,5,B000FEBWTE,"I am so sick of these people whining about ""DO THE SHOW JUSTICE WITH SEASON SETS""

These people are idiots. First off, when looking at the episodes, each set has aprox 40. There are aproxomatly 90 - 100 full episodes of B&B total. Therefore, most every episode WILL be on DVD minus a few in the first season that were exceptionally terrible, anyway. and a few others that don't make the cut. If that happens, Oh fricking well.

If you people are seriously going to give every set a score of 1 or 0 becuase you are missing awful episodes like ""Blood Drive"" and ""At The Movies"" then you people need to seriously re-evaulature your ability to properly submit a decent review, or not write one at all. It's not including some of the worst episodes, yet 89% of the entire shows run is going to be incuded eventually between three DVD sets. That means STOP... WHINING.

The ones that aren't on DVD frankly, aren't going to be missed when you've still got nearly the entire set and all of the best episodes, anyway. Nearly everything is included and the extras are great, the documentaries are insightful... what more do you people wnat from these sets? Realisitcally, that is.

For people whining about the music videos all being licenced, do you people have any idea how much money has ALREADY gone into licencing 13 songs by 11-13 bands on each of the 3 sets?! That's a lot more money than you think it is, and certainly a lot more money than a single one of you could or would be willing to pay, as fans to licence for this set. But again.. why be content with the best job they can do, when you can make minor complaints about a great set and vote 1 or 0 on it, just becuase you are selfish? Ugh... shut up.

A great deal of these people are ungratful and are nothing but just whiners, now. Only a small number of episodes won't make it, so these people are whining about nothing. I know the typical Amazon reviewer aren't rocket scientists in the first place, but a little common sense goes a hell of a long way.

Plus, do they have any idea how many episodes of Beavis and Butt-head were in each season? That's impossible. Season 1 consisted of 4 episodes!!!! Season 3 had like 50 or something. The B&B season were irregular so season sets are obviously out of the question. Now that you know that, please, for the love of god, shut up about it. Who the hell wants a DVD set with 4 terrible first season episodes? Come on. You people are being unrealsitic and whining about nothing.

These people who think they know Beavis and Butt-head so well, obviously don't know jack about the show, if they would seriously like the idea of a first season DVD containing the first 4 episodes and nothing else. If you want crap like that, fine. But I don't. I want a good set that has an equal banalnced nbumber of the best handpicked episodes.

Beavis and Butt-head was terrible quailty in it's early days, and just becuase you people have an elitist drive and a base desire for every episode, you need to understand that you people aren't producing this set for a reason. Becuase that is pretty unrealistic, given the nature of this show to NOT be even remotly consistant in it's number of episodes per season. THink, people.. think.

I sure wish these people would shut the hell up, becuase they aren't even bothering to understand what they hell they are saying before they even say it. Plus, they are going to buy it anyway, so I wish they'd stop whining and marking it down with these childish scores of 1 star just becuase of their own ignroance and unrealistic expectations.

Geez. Y'know, one of my major pet peeves is becoming people who endlessly bitch about excellent DVD sets, bash them online, and then BUY THEM ANYWAY. These people are hypocrites. Seriously.

But just to recap....

1. Season sets are an impossibility due to the irragularity of the seasons and the number of episodes in each one.

2. If you can't review based on the contents and not the few things that are missing, and you give it one star or even 0, your review is unfair and shouldn't even be allowed. It shoudl be deleted for fair reviews to give an accurate, overall score without a few mindles speople ruining it for everyone else.

3. Think before you write.

4. I've seen people call Mike Judge a ""scumbag"" (a direct quote from one little kid) on Amazon reviews despite the fact that he made this show they apparently love so much, and he's put together the best box set there is. Don't be a hypocrite. If you can't do that, than don't review, please.

5. You people need to stop being so ungrateful and review fairly, and stop being utterly ridiculous.",1150416000,26,4633,4.484560570071259

And if you think your kids watching the show will try burning a rat in a deep fryer or running around executing grasshoppers with a chainsaw only to cut their own fingers off, then you need some serious parenting skills!  Raise 'em right and they won't be even close to this.

After watching all 3 volumes I laughed at the jokes that were there and was disappointed by everything that wasn't there. I can't believe that the creater of a show this good would decide to finally come out with dvds and then just chop it to bits. Thinking to himself, well I don't like this and that so I'm not going to put it on the dvds, who cares what the fans think it's my creation. Hopefully, Mike Judge will pull his head out of his ass and realize what he's done. Beavis and Butthead is coming back to Mtv in October, maybe that will be his motivation to rerelease all the original episodes in there original form plus extra, so we the fans can spend our money on something worth watching.",1315785600,2,777,4.1866666666666665

2562276,4,B000FEBWTE,"I've been a fan of Beavis and Butthead since I was thirteen or so, and while I am in complete and total agreement about the fact that Mike Judge needs to like, uh, get up off his butt and like release the whole show on DVD, I don't believe the Mike Judge collections are the travesties that most reviewers on here seem to feel they are. I recently ordered all three from Amazon and while I haven't yet received volume 2 I have 1 and 3, and I must say I haven't laughed so much or so hard in a long time. Without exception I've liked every episode in these collections so far. Only a couple of my favorites were omitted, those being Beard BOys and Hard Sell. As for the videos, I did have a few favorites but I was more interested in the cartoons themselves, so the absence of all but a few videos from these collections isn't much a blow for me. About the only video I was disappointed not to find on this collection was Nightmares by Violent Femmes, mainly because of how Beavis freaked every time he heard the word Suck.
  Volume three is packed full of many of my favorites. I'll list just a few here.
Vaya Con Cornholio: Beavis' alter ego resurfaces after he consumes the entire supply of Burger World's new soda. Unfortunately, an idiotic agent from the INS happens to drop in during the episode and Beavis is accidentally deported to Mexico while the agent and his superiors try to make sense of the gibberish that is Cornholio.
Just for Girls: THe duo watch a sex ed film aimed at young girls and discover that the subject isn't nearly as fascinating as they'd thought.
Follow me: Beavis mimicks everything Butthead says or does with predictable results.
Huh-huh-humbug: In a parody of Charles Dickens' A CHristmas Carrol, Beavis is the tyranical manager of Burger World and Principal McVicker plays the role of the unfortunate Bob Cratchet. After leaving a disgruntled McVicker in Butthead's care, Beavis goes home and is visited first by a ghostly Butthead, then by three spirits. Tom Anderson represents Christmas Past, Mr. Van Dreson is CHristmas Present and Mr. Buzzcut is CHristmas Future.
It's a Miserable Life: In response to the prayers of the people of HIghland, God sends Charlie, the boys' guardian angel, to kill them. When the attempt fails, he attempts to persuade Butthead to off himself by showing him what Highland would be like had he never been born.
Substitute:After Mr. Van Dreson accidentally injures himself while attempting to demonstrate a Yoga position to the class, the substitute who replaces him inspires everyone save the titular duo.
Sprout: Mr. Van Dreson gives the class a project to grow their own food. The boys attempt to grow corn to make their own nachos with less than satisfactory results.
Buy Beer: After a guest lecture at their school about the dangers of alcohol addiction, the duo predictably get the wrong idea and attempt to get booz by attending an AA meeting, with disastrous results for their fellow attendees.
Bride of Butt Head: In a further attempt to score, Butthead gets a mail order Russian bride. Unfortunately she is less than pleased with the arrangement...
Graduation: Concerned by the students' lack of self-esteem, Van Dreson holds a mock graduation ceremony to prepare them for the big event. Unfortunately, Beavis and Butthead mistake it for the real thing...
Beavis and Butthead are Dead: When Highland HIgh telephones to find out why the duo haven't been in class for three weeks, Beavis tells them that they're dead. While McVicker, Buzzcut and others celebrate, Van Dreson tries to get everyone to remember the good in Beavis and Butthead by reliving various memories of the duo. This was the original series finale.
  All in all, Volume 3 of the Mike Judge collection is a good deal. As with the first two volumes, much of te material that was cut from some of the episodes can be viewed as easter eggs. And Disk three contains a selection of videos and some other bonus materials.",1303084800,3,3958,4.731884057971015

2562282,3,B000FEBWTE,"all of these mike judge collections are basically the same..

PROS:
-quick and easy way to see some quality laughs.
-price isn't too bad if you look in the right place.
-neat extras
-high replay quality
-c'mon, it STILL is beavis and butthead...at least!

CONS:
-NOT ENOUGH MUSIC VIDEOS!!!!(besides about 15 tacked on to disc 3. i know they need to get rights and all, but since when has mtv not been able to get rights music videos?)
-without these music videos, the shorts are about 5 minutes long and tend to get very repetitive.
-too many missing episodes.

bottom line:

if you don't have anything B&B, by all means get at least one of these for now.  if you know that they are kinda botched and already own some of the vhs recordings and what not, you would save cash by avoiding. why would mike judge not release them all in pure unedited form? self censoring sucks! it sucks! it sucks! it sucks!

p.s. you are missing one episode on that long list that wasn't included.  Inventors. that episode makes me crack up even more than a few on here.",1168128000,4,1050,4.465968586387435

Way Down Mexico Way

Canoe

Cow Tipping

Pumping Iron

Crisis Line

Beard Boys

I Dream of Beavis

The Mystery of Morning Wood

Were funny...but, were they really that funny?...i mean they were good, but, not all were that great and maybe thats why they were not in the set.

That said, there's so much missed potential in this entire collection. The episodes are sometimes censored, and by Volume 3, Beavis has yet to say ""fire"" without being ironic. Either Mike Judge is ashamed of the first two seasons of Beavis and Butthead, or MTV is afraid kids will find these discs and burn their trailers down again.

Three discs for under $30 isn't a bad deal, but don't buy this collection expecting anything different from the first two.",1156550400,4,691,4.702479338842975

But I stand by the title to it, it's just too appropriate.  And, hey, Mike Judge: ~ PLEASE! More Beavis and Butthead! ~",1155427200,2,460,4.376470588235295

Throughout the years of Beavis they did have some strange modifications such as this on MTV, so this could be it, but everytime I've seen it, the chair was sawed.  They should have included all of the variations of the shows on the DVD, or at least the most common / longer variation!?!

These sets downright SUCK, and the fact that my daughter's favorite episode, CLOSING TIME (where they toss food into the ceiling fan) and one of the funniest episodes, STEAMROLLER are no where to be found on them is more idiotic than the boys are, Mr. Judge you really are a DILLWEED...

I wish I could take a DVD Recorder back to 1993 and record the entire series from the get go, because not having the music videos in between the action is NOT THE SAME.  It is nice to have them without the videos for a quick laugh, but true fans appreciate them in their entirety!",1155427200,32,1088,4.334975369458128

I am happy they decided to put the final episode in this collection because I think the people who are new to the show need to find out what happened to them in the end of the series. I like it overall and it's recommended. I am saying this right now: ""Mike Judge, if you are reading this, you must release the unreleased-to-DVD episodes. The reason is because the people want those too. I know that you are embarressed to release them but remember this, at least they looked better than The Simpsons when they debuted on the Tracy Ullman Show (no offense to the creators of The Simpsons). Beavis and Butthead haven't looked that much different from the early seasons to the later ones. Well, except for Mr. Anderson, he was the only one who changed dramatically, but it still doesn't mean that you have to keep the unreleased episodes from seeing the light of day. Please, for the love of your fans, release the other episodes. Trust me, not only will the fans be happy but you won't have to go through that much stress from not releasing the other episodes.""",1155081600,,1187,4.525581395348837

Almost all of those are classic, hilarious episodes....""Beard Boys"" was histerical.... ""would ya like to stroke my beard?"" some of the onliners in these episodes is hilarious....I agree with the previous person's account of Mike Judge.....let us decide whether or not the early episodes are crap or not...some of the real early ones are pure classic...like the one when they go to the carnival and get whacked on the pavement by that big gorilla type bodyguard...

2562295,5,B000FEBWTE,"Glad to see Shopping List,and Woodshop finally on DVD.2 of my all time favorites.
To see those 2 buying stuff for Anderson and in the end running wild in the Drug Store buying everything else BUT what they went there for is worth the price alone. Sad not to see Beavis and Butthead's Island,and Career Day on this final Volume though.
Lots of repeats of episodes on other DVD releases (Time/Life,and the History of B&B)are a huge disapointment though.",1153785600,,451,4.7215189873417724
2562296,4,B000FEBWTE,"I own all 6 of the Time Life DVDs as well as ""The History of Beavis and Butt-head"" and the Mike Judge Collection, Volumes 1 and 2.

There is a great deal of overlap between these new DVDs and the previously released material and the series is still not yet complete.  Animated shows don't fit as neatly into seasons as do their live action counterparts.  As such, I don't mind Beavis and Butt-head being released as non-chronological ""Volumes"" but I do want the whole and complete series on my shelf.  The following episodes do not, to my knowledge, exist in any home video form:

1  Heroes

2  Way Down Mexico Way

3  For Better or Verse

4  Beware of the Butt

5  At the Movies

6  Comedians

7  Couch Fishing

8  Kidnapped

9  Tornado

10  Incognito

11  Scratch 'n' Win

12  True Crime

13  Ball Breakers

14  Buff 'n' Stuff

15  Canoe

17  Beavis and Butt-head Meet God

18  Young, Gifted & Crude

19  Sporting Goods

20  Wall of Youth

21  Cow Tipping

22  Trouble Urinating

23  Jump!

24  Let's Clean it Up

25  Water Safety

26  Beavis and Butt-head's Island

27  Crisis Line

28  Beard Boys

29  Career Day

30  To the Rescue

31  I Dream of Beavis

32  Screamers

33  Skin Trade

34  The Mystery of Morning Wood

35  Butt, Butt, Hike!

36  Evolution Sucks

37  Cyber-Butt

38  Nothing Happening

39  Shortcuts

40  The Future of Beavis and Butt-head

41  Our Founding Losers

I think that's a perfect list for The Mike Judge Collection, Volume 4, don't you?  Of course, none of the previously released DVDs are readily available anymore so, technically, there should be a Volume 5 and maybe 6 too.  It would be nice but I'm certainly not holding my breath.",1153785600,29,1687,4.365771812080537

2562298,3,B000FEBWTE,"I could live with these 3 dvds if my favorite episode would have actually been on one of them, the Steamroller episode. I am just dumbfounded that an episode with a 9.5 rating on tvtome would not be included on these sets. The ratings on that site are VIEWERS ratings of the episodes they like. There are some good episodes on these dvds, but there are some very crappy ones that viewers gave lower ratings on. I am just p***** because my favorite episode was a lot better than some of the episodes that were put out. I can't smile about a dvd series release that doesn't include my favorite episode.",1153180800,4,600,4.414414414414415

2562300,3,B000FEBWTE,"don't get me worng, i like these sets because i love the show and for the extras. but i would STRONGLY prefer if mike judge would release the season sets with OR without music videos. i would love it if he could have music videos on them. but that would cost millions.

i say buy it anyway for the awesome show and extras. maybe if we buy them, he will have enough money to release season sets with music videos.",1152144000,5,412,4.15
2562301,5,B000FEBWTE,"How can other people complain about this thrid volume of Beavis & Butt-Head this show is what change animation and comedy forever. They maybe be stupid, ugly, and not much of a role models, but thats what we love about them which made them famous. if they were smart this show would of been canceled a long time ago.",1151712000,4,316,4.372881355932203
2562302,3,B000FEBWTE,"well, all i can say is that the extras and everything are cool, its always nice to see those. its just that true fans of the show want season-by-season dvds like *EVERY OTHER TV SHOW OUT ON DVD* and for them to be completely unedited, original, and with the music videos. anyone who doesnt desire the sets to be like this is NOT a true fan of beavis and butt-head.

now, ""Karma Satori ""Karma"" you post is stupid and chilidish, you haven't even reviewed your facts either.

there are somewhere around 207 episodes of beavis and butt-head (NOT 90-100), and 2 pilot episodes in various versions (different videos) and versions of the season 1 episodes with alternate videos.

second, those episodes which you consider ""awful"" some people will (i already know people who do) consider them some of the best episodes and they demonstrate how far the show has progressed over the years before it was cancelled. besides, most animated shows progress as they run for longer and the show improves, thats how they are. cutting off half the ""awful"" episodes is just ridiculous and is annoying the true fans of B&B. so don't express your opinions as facts please.

and to be more precise, there was 2 pilot episodes (not including alternate music videos), season 1 had 4 episodes (not including alternate music videos), season 2 has 23 episodes, season 3 has 28 episodes, season 4 has 32 episodes, season 5 has 50 episodes, season 6 has 18 episodes, season 7 has 40 episodes (shorter in length). so really, please look these things up in future.

and you yourself are claiming that people don't know anything about the show, you are hardly the mastermind either, so cram it, bunghole.

and if they are at least not gonna make the season sets in order, they could at least put e.g 25 episodes on each disc, but in the order they were made. that would be a hell of an improvement than randomised episodes.

now, what about music videos? i totally understand about how the licensing thing may be a problem. well, if they aren't gonna include the videos, they could at least use the ""original"" titlecards on the early episodes like home improvement, rather than re-make them, or restore the beloved ""FIRE!"" chants/references/scenes in such episodes as ""comedians"" and making other ridiculous edits in episodes such as ""good credit"" editing out the ""choadsmoker"" comment.

i, for one, am already in the process of making my own dvd sets, tracking down the uncensored episodes on HQ vhs tapes from tape traders and digital tv captures, so i can have the episodes in their ""restored glory"", as i happen to be fortuante enough to have professional video editing/re-mastering/dvd authoring skills, which i have developed solely for my love of this show. so now i can make the sets the way they were meant to be, and the way they were originally aired.

Mike Judge, your sets are cool for the extras/documentries etc, but i wanna see Beavis and Butt-head the way it was meant to be.",1151625600,24,2959,4.7412451361867705
2562303,1,B000FEBWTE,"I agree with others! Season by season BOX SETS of Beavis & Butt-Head are what we fans want! With all music and B&B commentary and no damned edits of anything!

Until then, Mike Judge & company, I will NOT buy anything B&B related, relying instead on my own VHS recorded episodes(limited in number of episodes as they are at least they're the complete original episodes)that I've transfered to DVD.

I want each and every episode uncut and in their original broadcast order.

Who's the brains behind the lame ""Mike Judge Collection"" series anyway?!? Some dumbass idiot working at Burger World???

Just from a purely greedy standpoint you'd make way more greenbacks by doing it the right way for cryin' out loud! Not to mention retain the show's and your integrity.

Hell, even Beavis and Butt-Head'd think this ""Collection"" concept'd be lame and stupid!!
