8059460,5,B0009DWW54,"Have always been into personal development and living my life fully to the best of my potential and Jim Rohn has some of the BEST information set in the most accessible way.  Much easier to read than the other classics in this genre and more accessible to modern sensibilities than titles like Think and Grow Rich.  Tip my hat to Mr Rohn and have used his information in my life to my advantage.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-To-Achieve-Anything/dp/B009BICB86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How To Achieve Anything</a>",1350345600,,557,6.037974683544304

8059462,5,B0009DWW54,"If you have ever wondered where some of the greatest thinkers and motivators of the last thirty years have gotten their fire- look no further than Jim Rohn. He is a master teacher who packs a lot of his key ideas into this inspirational keynote address.

If you are a Jim Rohn fan there isn't a lot of new ideas, but if you have never experienced Jim then it's well worth your time to sit down and listen and learn from one of the best! As an aside, you can read Jim's weekly blog at [...] which has a large listing of his inspirational and motivational teaching.",1219449600,4,563,4.261682242990654
8059463,4,B0009DWW54,"I wasn't sure what I was purchasing... it is rather short for the money... I don't find it to be a stand alone that encompasses everything... but I agree with other reviewers who point out key points that maybe other programs are missing.
Jim always comes to the table with something of value and this is no exception.

The video and audio quality are great... keep in mind, it is very short.  :)",1198972800,4,396,4.410958904109589
8059464,5,B0009DWW54,"I recently had the pleasure of listening to LIVING AN EXCEPTIONAL

LIFE, a Better Life Media presentation delivered by Jim

Rohn . . . though it's only 48 minutes long, there's a lot

of useful information in the program from this business

philosopher who has authored over 25 books and

audio/video programs.

I also liked how he used real-life examples, often from his

own life, and how it inspired me to want to do more

with my life on a daily basis.

Among his many useful suggestions:

* If a good idea comes your way, write it down.

* Set goals that will elevate you.

* Each person needs all of us.

* The ultimate essence of life: Learning to live a good life.

* Take special care of your inner circle of relatives and special

friends. And make sure the mailbox is not empty. (In other

words, keep in touch with these people.)

What makes Rohn so much fun to listen to is that he frequently adds

humor, such as when he commented that good friends

know all about you--and still like you!",1154736000,15,1003,4.353260869565218
