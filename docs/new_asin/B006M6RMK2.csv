8500618,4,B006M6RMK2,"""The Andy Griffith Show"" episodes were copied from the season 3 set, released by Paramount.  The quality of those episodes is great.  Complete episodes, with the original theme song.  These episodes are in the public domain, but, they didn't use the bad quality prints, which is great.

""The Lucy Show"" episodes, on the other hand, are the same old prints that every public domain company has put out.  Blurry and scratchy, with muffled audio.

If it weren't for that detracting factor, this would've gotten 5 stars.",1357689600,,516,4.941860465116279
