7882231,5,6305057478,This is a real classic. I once met Jeff Clark at a Surf Expo in San Diego and I found out even more about discovering Mavericks. I own a Surf Shop in Waikiki and I run a copy of Mavericks Video in my window. It's mesmerizing. Maverick's the documentary is now hard to find I feel fortunate to own a copy.,1362787200,,304,4.0
7882232,5,6305057478,Maverick's Condition Black shows this California Big Wave Break at it's best. The best riders and the best waves of perhaps all time on the west coast. This is a great video for surfers and non-surfers alike.,995155200,6,208,4.648648648648648
