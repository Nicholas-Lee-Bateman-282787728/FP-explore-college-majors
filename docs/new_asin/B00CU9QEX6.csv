8586474,4,B00CU9QEX6,"Even though JKS (Jang Kuen Suk) is not the main star of this movie, it is quite good.  You have 3 older men who are wanting to relive their college Rock-n-Roll band days after one of their members dies unexpectedly.  JKS is the son of the member who passed way and becomes the lead singer of the Active Volcanoes redux.  It has brilliantly funny moments and heart wrenching moments of when a family falls apart.  The interaction between the band members becomes a Family!  Definitely a good family movie for those needed Family Get Together moments.",1382486400,3,549,4.677083333333333
