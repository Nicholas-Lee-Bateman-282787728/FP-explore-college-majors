8334889,2,B001PYVFAY,"Unfortunately, the NTSC version was available when I laid down my $31.68, so I was suckered in by the hope to see an Erica Gavin movie I hadn't. Clearly somebody sought to cash in on Erica Gavin's celebrity after Vixen! and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, but the filmmaking wouldn't have even risen to typical B-movie standards. What's worse, though she has star billing, Ms. Gavin only appears in 1/3 of the movie.

It was a crappy 16mm shootshot, save for one scene, without sync sound. There's a lot of VO posing as dubbing, yet as some of this inane and vapid ""dialog"" occurs when mouths are otherwise busy with body parts, it borders on ridiculous. The lighting is uneven, so those hoping to drink in some quality T&A will be frustrated. As softcore it barely measures up because, save for Erica's scenes, you don't see anything new after the first 20 minutes.

Those who really like Erica Gavin will be especially disappointed. You see her in the opening creditsbikini/nude on the beachand then not again for another 30+ minutes. Her total screen time isn't much more than 20 minutes out of a 65 minute film. Furthermore, she and has no dialog. It sounds like someone else did her ""dubbing"" (voiceover). If you want nude Erica, watch Vixen! or BVD, because the poor quality of
the photography makes this film 65 minutes of wasted time.",1449273600,2,1342,4.682203389830509
