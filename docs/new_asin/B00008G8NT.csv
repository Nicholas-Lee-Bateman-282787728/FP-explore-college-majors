Only onnnnnneeeee live clip of them as DC3 (2002ish) at some signing. Not sure if that's a legit camera or a homemade camera from a fan. You do see a clip of Beyonce singing at her high school chorus. That was cool.

It's interviews from Beyonce's teachers (two, and they are kinda full of it! The school didn't get them where they wanted to go, the group got where they wanted to go. Don't buy into school's preachin' that crap.) There's a crazy Christian moment (remember when the joke was DC3 were Jehovah's witnesses, I can see where that comes from) and this white guy that works at one of the studios at Columbia was saying some DUMB STUFF ON HERE LIKE HE REALLY KNOWS THEM. and then he was saying Negro Church or soemthing and I was upset. Totally stuff that fills up time of the video. Oh and you have this weird reporter (trying to be Bill Bellamy) narrorating the video. He's dressed inappropriately and just comes off like this is his first video. Clip of a vocal coach that said he didn't know who they were even though his kids said they are the most famous out of who you met. that was interesting.

Interesting video, you're not really missing anything. No footage, mostly pictures which i'm sure you can get on the internet. I thought the spice girls unauthorized was better b/c the cameras showed a lot more live footage of them.",1187654400,2,1471,4.404411764705882
7983310,5,B00008G8NT,The dvd was wonderful.  It was packaged well and it contained no damages what so ever.  If you are a DC3 fan and don't have this dvd already purchase it.  It's not to expensive and anyway it's worth the money.  Buy it on Amazon!,1124323200,4,228,4.113636363636363
