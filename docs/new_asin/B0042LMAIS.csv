8413845,2,B0042LMAIS,My bad. I was in a hurry and not paying close enough attention when I ordered to realize these DVDs will not play on my DVD player which was purchased in the US. I live in Region 1 of the world and these play only in Region 2.  Big bummer. I love these movies.,1455408000,,260,3.814814814814815
