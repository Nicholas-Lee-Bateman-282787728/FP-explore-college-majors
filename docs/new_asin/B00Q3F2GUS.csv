8690182,5,B00Q3F2GUS,"this is a awesome movie. don't get me wrong. I love this movie but the first one was way better. I wished that clive owen played Dewight instead of josh brolin. I liked clive better. don't get me wrong I like josh as an actor I just thought clive was better. I'm mean they had everyone else from the first movie expect him playing their parts. Jessica alba had a bigger role in this one than the first. love her, she is so hot. and man did bruce nail it even though he was in it for such a small period of time. that also goes for Christopher Lloyd. I was surprised to see him in it. but all in all. the acting was good, the action was good and the special effects were good. I was surprised by one thing, that everyone was waiting for this movie and they never saw it in theatres. it never hit the box office. oh well. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do.",1420588800,2,876,4.011428571428572
