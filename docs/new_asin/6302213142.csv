439549,5,6302213142,"A warning should be made about this video: this documentary is for those who understand the historical value of the footage. Sure, there are a lot of scenes of the Beatles in hotels, limousines, trains, etc. But isn't it  wonderful that a movie camera was there to capture it all? And there is  even a candid scene of George creating some weird noises in his acoustic  guitar, anticipating the Indian-influenced, experimental music he would  make in the late 60's. This video is NOT for the casual Beatles fan who  wants to show his daughter that they were better than the Backstreet Boys.  But it is certainly the most generous collection of Beatles footage ever  released on home video! And the television appearances are the icing on the  cake!",953164800,2,747,4.78125
439550,5,6302213142,"A very-well documented history of the Beatles first trip to the US! Surprisingly, the video and audio are very good for being over 35 years old. Although I'm not a fan of MPI Home Video's quality from what I've seen  so far, this is one of the better ones (although they didn't Q/A the trivia  game). Beatles fans need this -- and so do all fans of music history --  'cuz this is it: almost an hour and a half of the real-life Beatles, their  humor, their charm, and their wonderful music.",952732800,2,489,4.282608695652174
439551,5,6302213142,"Wow!  Is this really a documentary?  Were the Beatles really that witty, charming and off the cuff?  The answer to both questions is yes!  Actually, this shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that Hard Day's Night was really very  close to the real thing: A Day In the Life of the Beatles in early '64.  However, this documentary takes nothing away from a Hard Day's Night.  They  are both absolutely brilliant on their own terms.  Lester does things in  the movie that transcend what a documentary can do (the fabulous escape  ""Can't Buy Me Love"" sequence, for one of many).  However, you  don't need to be a Beatle fan to appreciate this great documentary.  Unless  you have no interest in this very interesting time in history, you will  find this extremely...well... ...interesting.  How lucky we are to have  this unique event so brilliantly preserved for posterity.  The Maysles  brothers were visionaries! If you have any interest in why the '60s were  such a remarkable decade,don't miss seeing this!  Holds up very well to  repeated viewings.",949017600,26,1046,4.818181818181818

439638,5,6302213142,"the chance to see, very close up and very personally, the reactions of the beatles to being in american for the first time (though george had already been over in the united states to visit his sister, previously, before ""beatlemania"" had hit). their ""tour' for this first visit, was very short; they did three of the sullivan t.v. shows, a show at carnegie hall in nyc, and then a show in washington d.c.

the dvd includes the not to be missed three performances by the beatles on the ed sullivan show, in nyc, and in fla. the vocals are very, very clear, far clearer than they were when we watched them on t.v. live, at the time. their abundant charm, their natural showmanship, their inherent musicianship, their physical beauty, and their obvious thrill at being in the united states, is very clearly apparent. they subsequently returned to the united states to do a second, longer tour, in august and sept. of 1964. i saw them on that second trip they made, on sept. 2, 1964, in philadelphia, at a venue holding around 13,500. the show i saw was exactly the same as depicted here, including the same hysterical reactions. not all of us were completely hysterical, we found the constant screaming to be annoying. we (my friend and i) were jumping up and down in our balcony seats- we were so excited to see them in person- but we wanted to hear the music. this dvd is highly recommended for a very inside look at the initial intro of the beatles to the united states, and us, to them.",1437868800,10,1488,4.5315985130111525

I've seen so many documentaries both of the Beatles and Rock and Roll and everybody has to look back with 20-20 hindsight and declare their opinion of ""What it all meant.""  The glorious beauty of this video is IT'S JUST THE BEATLES in the time interacting with each other, those around them, and their environment.  YOU get to watch like the fly on the wall. It's raw, it's them.  No one tells you what to think about it all.  I love that!",1432598400,2,615,4.398230088495575

439674,5,6302213142,"The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit is a re-edited version of renowned documentary film-making team Albert and David Maysles' documentary,""What's Happening! The Beatles In The U.S.A."" about the Beatles' first visit to the United States in 1964. It documents their trip as they travel to New York City, Washington, DC, and Miami Beach.

The noted documentary filmmakers had the presence of mind to realize there was a story here, and they followed The Fab Four with their cameras throughout their first American adventure, capturing the magic of their music and the glorious madness that was Beatlemania. They were given extraordinary access to the Beatles during their several concerts and their seminal first appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Also,it shows lots of spontaneous cheekiness with the press and fans; the Beatles' wide-eyed bemusement at the hysteria they caused; as much cutting up as a tiny hotel room allows; and even specific scenes such as goofing off on a commuter train and mod dancing in a nightclub.

The performance segments alone are a must for fans. The three Ed Sullivan appearances show a great cross section of their hits at the time, including ""All My Loving,"" ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" a beautifully delivered ""This Boy"" by John Lennon, and a wobbly ""I Saw Her Standing There"" so out of tune George Harrison nearly cracks up as he listens to Lennon and Paul McCartney struggle for harmony. The blurry, badly mic'd footage of the concert at the Washington Coliseum shows the Beatles acting as their own roadies, setting up their instruments; the platform Ringo Starr drums on lurches ominously with each downbeat. It was a more innocent, exuberant time, to be sure, and this sweet documentary lets the Beatles phenomenon speak for itself.",1431129600,,1770,5.058219178082192

Also I never knew that Ed Sullivan had a show in Florida he seems more relaxed while doing that show compared to his NY show.

439848,4,6302213142,"With the 50th Anniversary of the Beatles First US visit this year, I thought it was a good idea to re-watch this fun documentary, filmed by the renowned documentary filmmaking team, Albert and David Maysles in February, 1964. Apparently, they were called by Granada television to ask if they would consider making a film shortly before the Beatles landed.  Albert Maysles had never heard of The Beatles,  luckily, his brother had, so they agreed to make the film.

This really captures the excitement of Beatlemania, when it was a joy to be having success in America (a task no other British act had ever really succeeded in) and before the crowds, noise and general mayhem had not become something to be avoided.  You feel that the screaming crowds were a huge surprise to the band  John Lennon comments with amazement that he wasn't aware, anyone knew we were coming! as the kids run alongside the car.  Their tolerance, and willingness to act up in front of the cameras, leads to some enjoyable and intimate scenes.  As Albert Maysles says, when interviewed in The Making Of the First US Visit, an extra documentary  included in this disc  their access was virtually unlimited. The Maysles brothers accompanied the band in New York, to Washington DC and Miami Beach.

This documentary includes clips of the bands concert in Washington, of the Ed Sullivan Show performances, of the band at the Peppermint Lounge (poor George would clearly have preferred to have gone to bed, but is out voted by the others, keen to see something of New York now they are there), on the train travelling to Washington, messing about in hotel rooms, having photo ops in Central Park and, always, both on show and on the run from the crowds.  There is no voice over in the documentary  allowing the footage to speak for itself.  However, in The Making of...., Albert Maysles offers many comments on his favourite parts of the film, there is extra footage  including the scrum of the British Ambassadors Ball, which so upset John Lennon  and it is nice to hear his thoughts about that time, when the Americans welcomed the Beatles with open arms.",1392076800,,2127,4.773224043715847

439906,5,6302213142,"This DVD release of the polished Maysles' Brothers documentary (The First U.S. Visit/Washington, D.C. concert)represents the unadulterated, captivated Beatles appeal that salved the pain of the U.S. following the assassination of its beloved president, JFK from 1964 to the present. Before them we looked to Col. Parker and Elvis for teenage direction. The Beatles went on to rule the world until they tired of being a commodity. All the essentials to winning an audience over by presentation, charm and talent are on full display: play music well, harmonize and back the talent up with hours of constant play until you develop a unique ""sound""; assemble a competent management team, particularly one like the paternal, devoted Brian Epstein with marked levels of taste and the opportunities present themselves. You can drown yourselves completely in this DVD because of the stage and off-stage footage of the Fab Four being themselves (on an invisible leash). It is clear now that this footage was the inspiration for their first movie, ""A Hard Day's Night,"" so in essence, the experience draws upon it combined with the 3 Ed Sullivan Show appearances to make you feel how the lads were excellent entertainers and down-to-earth (tame for the moment)lads. The entire Washington D.C. concert was exciting but raw in its release in the '70s, but here it is excised a bit to combine as one look at the Beatles before the touring charm wore off. (In that concert it was clearly a warning with the lads barely making it off the stage safely as they were being pelted with jelly beans mercilessly by their admirers in such closely inadequately guarded quarters.) This is simply the most charming look at the lads in their moment of launch. It is sad to realize how they truly missed the watchful presence of Brian Epstein with just 5 more years of Beatle teamwork. They were the backdrop to our lives and you will see why right here. Your ears will not deceive.",1363564800,4,1955,4.909365558912387

439909,5,6302213142,"I rarely talk about the Beatles for long without using the word bittersweet.  Even in 1964, anyone who was there, from afar or close,  would have to have admitted the joy that was the Beatles, time capsuled in the fine documentary THE BEATLES - THE FIRST U.S. VISIT, would not last forever.  But who would have predicted we'd lose John Lennon so senselessly or that the same would nearly happen to George Harrison, with the damage nonetheless hastening his death at such a young age?  This film presents Lennon, Harrison, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney already seeming prisoners of their success.  It's a wonder they lasted even until 1970.  Lennon appears withdrawn; in a couple of hotel room scenes we do not even see him.  McCartney alternates between turning on his famous charm and turning it noticeably off.  Harrison and Starr do the heavy-lifting, fooling around as if to throw the filmmakers off scent.

What a great band the Beatles were.  Obvious, I know, but we've heard those songs so many times, we might forget just how often those musicians hit their marks, often reinventing them.  Harrison, Lennon, McCartney and Starr play so well in THE BEATLES - THE FIRST U.S. VISIT that, in the first ED SULLIVAN SHOW appearance, my wife asked if the Beatles were miming to their records.

I all but started to cry at the 28:20 moment of THE BEATLES - THE FIRST U.S. VISIT, as the Beatles play ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on their first ED SULLIVAN SHOW appearance and the camera pans over McCartney, Harrison, and Lennon to Starr.  It's like seeing an old lover you can't touch anymore, feeling the unexplainable joy of those men and that music with the hindsight of the unacceptable, unthinkable price they would pay for being so great.",1325894400,4,1743,4.731788079470198

Beatlemania was non-existent in my youth.  This doc really brings it home as to why they have endured.  the screaming fans who may have swooned to their looks or accents were also swooning to their musical talents, which were only beginning to blossom.  This is easily the bud of the flower that fully bloomed by the time Abbey Road was finished.  You get as one other reviewer called it ""The Real Hard Day's Night.""

This is the real deal, a documentary film with full access to the Beatles from the moment they touch down in New York to the moment of their return to England. Don't be confused-this is not one of those cheap /thrown together films of old newsclips. Granada TV in England hired the Maysles brothers to capture the whole 1st American visit on film to be shown in England.

The most striking feature of this film is its unmistakable influence on ""A Hard Day's Night"". You are in the Beatle's car as they drive from the airport to the Plaza Hotel. You are in the Beatle's suite at the Plaza, watching themselves on the news, and taking calls from DJ's in search of a quick Beatle endorsement. You are with them as they leave the hotel to perform on Ed Sullivan. You are on the train to Washington DC for their first live concert in the states...

439945,3,6302213142,"I love the Beatles, but feel somewhat disappointed in this DVD. Possibly my expectations were raised too high reading these reviews. I already own the Ed Sullivan shows, so that was nothing new. The larking around was the biggest disappointment. I'd heard so much about the humour of the Beatles that I expected to be rolling in laughter. Actually, I found this ad libbing somewhat boring after a while and scarcely worth a repeat viewing. I wasn't 'there' for this historical event so it doesn't have the nostalgia impact it might have for older baby boomers. I'm, I guess, a young baby boomer.

Two parts I really did enjoy, but they were very short. The Collisseum show was better than I expected, but simultaneously saddened me for the pathetic technology and stage management - even though I understand it was standard practice for the time. The site of Paul manhandling Ringo's wobbly platform 90 degrees every song is just not something I could show my kids. That's a school band, not the single greatest rock band the world has ever known.

Secondly, George singing a Bob Dylan song was unexpected and a treat - but again, all too brief. I don't regret owning this - I could never regret owning anything by the Beatles.

439988,5,6302213142,"This is the original film documentry by the Maysles brothers, of the Beatles' first American visit. When the boys came to our shores in February 1964, the Maysles were commisioned to follow them around with cameras, detailing their every move during the entire brief tour. The result is now on dvd, fully remastered and really fun fun fun to watch.

  A visual diary of Beatlemania unfolding for the first time, in America, the cameras follow them from the minute they descend the steps of the aircraft until they ascend again. In keeping with the cinema verite' style, there is no narration, only diologue, and events captured as they unfold. The camera captures the fan hysteria at the airport, in front of the Plaza Hotel, and of course in the Ed Sullivan studio, during the live taping of their historic appearances. It even eavesdrops on Murray the K as he counts down on his WINS radio show, the minutes to their arrival. But of course, 99% of this film is the Beatles themselves, just being themselves. (Or as natural as you can be if you have a camera in your face all the time.) You see them in the car going to the hotel, in the hotel , in Central Park, at the Peppermint Lounge,... everywhere, including their excursion to Miami Beach.

  It's fun to note their excitement as they witness their impact on America, and realize that they are the first British act to actually win the hearts of this big, intimidating country. Their excitement is obvious and unrehearsed, especially Paul's. When I first watched this dvd, I hadn't seen The Beatles for a long time, and I was so overjoyed to see and hear them again. I had forgotten how young they were. I was also surprised that Paul comes across as the most natural, and the one who wears his heart on his sleeve (so to speak) more than the others. He can barely contain his excitement, and happiness in this film, and he doesn't bother trying. I was really surprised by how funny he is. In almost every scene, he is doing a funny accent or impersonation of someone, and he's really good. People seem to associate John with this sort of humor, but Paul was just as funny. John on the other hand, plays the cool man, putting a check on his excitement. In the car going to the hotel, John and Ringo look on with affectionate amusement as Paul,barely able to contain himself, practically bounces out of his seat, waving a transister radio around. George and Ringo are seen doing some slapstick on the train going to Washington D.C. but it isn't as funny as the droll one liners that both of them became known for as time went on. And in this particular film, they are not as fun to watch as dear Paul...and ultra cool John.  The extras offered with this treasure of a dvd are also worth it. They contain out takes from the original film which include more clowning around,more McCartney craziness, ( in one scene with Murray the K, and later by the Plaza elevator, Paul almost seems,dare I say it,...high.) They had just left the Peppermint Lounge so who knows? Also of interest, are interviews on the street with snobby music students as they pontificate about the Beatles. If you're over a certain age (or you've seen the movie, Animal House), you know the type. Those early 60's folky type girls, with long hair,very well spoken, intellectual, and talking about how they don't normally listen to pop music, only folk and classical. Yeah yeah yeah. Anyway this is a very important addition to the Beatlephile library and I cherish it for it's historical and entertainment value. You will too.",1179705600,3,3550,4.625396825396826

439991,5,6302213142,"The Beatles' First U.S. Visit is, behind ""The Compleat Beatles"" and their self-produced ""Anthology"", the most entertaining and revealing about this musical group of four doing what they were born to do, on the way to the crest of their musical creativity. The performances on the American ""Ed Sullivan Show"" are entertaining for fans and interesting as historical documents, but the true gems are the sequences of non-performance documentary footage of all four members of the group, Brian Epstein, and (briefly, hush-hush ;)) Cynthia Lennon. This footage provides a window into The Beatles' emotional state during this life-altering point in their career. They balance organized professionalism (largely achieved by Brian Epstein, often under-appreciated in that he was managing a musical act achieving unprecedented popularity with no precedented business or professional model) with their excitement of their success in America. Then and now, largely the Holy Grail of success in entertainment. Paul, as would seem to be his role in their entire career together, acts as a conduit between George, John, Ringo and their handlers, like encouraging Ringo to pack his suitcase thouroughly in a ""mother hen"" voice. Watching them listen to themselves on the radio in America, seeing footage of car-mobbing people from the INSIDE of their car, seeing John tease instrumental DJ Murray The K (none the wiser) with pervy English slang, and The ""Ed Sullivan"" performances themselves is priceless. Though by February 1964 they were well versed in Hotel Room culture, their upbeat moods reveal their happiness (and reported surprise) at their reception from the moment they stepped off the trans-Atlantic airplane. Seeing this week of pivotal events in rock n' roll history from ""the boy's"" point-of-view is a wonderful peek behind the Beatles' curtain on par with their ""Anthology"" and not to be missed by any casual or greater fan. Probably, if purchased, one of the Beatles-related home media films you will find yourself repeat watching more than others. Well shot by the Maysles brothers, directed and edited.

440028,4,6302213142,"This is a great documentary that a fan can watch over and over again.  Although my favourite Beatles' era is their middle period (RS through MMT), followed by their late period (1968 to the end), there's a charm and sweetness to their early years as well, even though their songs were more lightweight and poppish.  They also looked so alike in this period, and it's charming to see how naturally they conducted themselves in front of the camera, just four innocent boys who had recently made it big and were having a great time on their first visit to America (although George had already been on his own in 1963 to visit his sister).  Nothing was faked or staged, and nothing is boring either.  The wit and charm was just so natural.  The documentary of outtakes is also very good, and serves to give a fuller picture of what went on during the filming.

However, as others have said, this documentary contains footage of their performances on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' and at the Washington Coliseum, footage which is already available on other DVDs (although since I'm not one to nitpick over minor technical details in lieu of the big picture, I won't go into which has better audio or visual quality).  It seems as though they could have put in the unused scene they shot when they went into the nearest apartment to watch the show with a family, instead of putting in footage already available elsewhere.  I also found the audio commentary to be rather lacking.  There were way too many long pauses and not nearly enough comments or observations.  How hard could it have been to fill up the nearly 90 minutes with practically nonstop comments and observations, particularly when we're dealing with The Beatles?",1142899200,4,1714,4.721476510067114

440033,5,6302213142,"If Gimme Shelter (also made by the Maysles brothers) marks the end of the 60s, then this film signals the start.
True, it's set in February 1964, but the heart and soul of this decade (at least musically) began on this fateful week when the Beatles landed in America.  The Maysles were both fortunate and wise enough to capture the Fab Four both onstage and behind the scenes: sparring with the press, catching trains and planes, trapped in hotel rooms, posing for cameras and playing their music to thousands of screaming fans.
Like D.A. Pennebaker (Don't Look Back), the Maysles are pioneers in documentary filmmaking.  Cinema verite (capturing life as it happens from a detached distance without using narration) was born in the early sixties, largely on the shoulders of these two New York filmmakers.
For decades, the entire film has been incredibly hard to find.  I recall 50-minute versions of this film floating around on VHS (legit or not).  However, it wasn't until the recent release of this film in its entirety that I could appreciate it as a real movie and not just a TV special about The Beatles.
The FIRST U.S. VISIT towers above the pile of exploitive dreck that has The Beatles slapped on its cover.  Why?  The close access and the way it's shot (handheld in glorious black and white).  Each of the Beatles' personalities shines forth that is true, honest and charming.  By comparison A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a thinly fictionalized version of this footage.
The special features in which Albert Maysles guides us through a treasure trove of outtakes is a sweet bonus.  My favourite moment is the family watching the Ed Sullivan Show live in their living room.  The kids can't sit still.  That scene alone tells you what Beatlemania was all about -- 41 years later and counting.",1115769600,10,1792,4.785714285714286

440037,5,6302213142,"Enough time has elapsed now for a new generation to come of age one step removed from the Beatle experience.  This film may not explain WHY the Beatles had the impact they did, but it does a fair job of depicting HOW the reaction manifested in so many awe-struck youngsters.

More than anything else, this film is a time capsule.  First, it reveals a lot about Beatlemania (at its apogee) from the perspective of the Beatles themselves, at the eye of the media carnival that engulfed them in February 1964.  There's lots of intimate, light-hearted footage of the boys at rest, on travel, and as camera-wielding tourists.  The Beatles' legendary wit and photogenic charm are evident throughout.  It's a fair guess that this film captures them just before their success became a crutch.  You wouldn't guess that John Lennon was the leader of the group just on the basis of this film alone.  He sometimes appears subdued and bewildered by the commotion around him.  In contrast, Paul McCartney was as much of a ham at age 21 as he is now as one of rock music's elder statemen.  Paul commands a LOT of screen time, and provided lead vocals for the first two songs in that initial (and explosive) three-song set on the first Ed Sullivan Show.  Their musicianship in these performances was crisp and effortless, depite the technological limitations of that era's audio/visual equipment.  It actually was not bad at all for four guys who were only 20 to 23 years old.

Second, the film depicts American baby boomers just as their age and numbers were reaching a critical mass that proved irresitible to Madison Avenue and the media.  It's been said elsewhere that reaction to the Beatles' arrival served as an emotional release for adolescents who were only 79 days beyond the JFK assassination.  The film's many kid-on-the street interviews are a fascinating glimpse of rapidly-fading 1950s innocence, soon to be replaced by the liberated and expressive 1960s counter-culture.",1091664000,9,1970,4.909365558912387

440064,4,6302213142,"Much has been written and seen about the Beatles landing in America.  After winning many fans over worldwide prior to February of 1964, the Beatles were ready to conquer the U.S. although they were not quite prepared for the overwhelming response they received once they arrived.  Originally intended for a UK audience, the Maysles brothers' documentary follows the Beatles from the very moment they landed at JFK airport until they departed for home some two weeks later. Included are highlights from the Beatles' performances on the Ed Sullivan Show as well as portions of their first American concert at the Washington Coliseum. Behind the scenes footage from the hotel rooms, the Peppermint Lounge (for a night on the town), press photo shoots, and on the train to (and from) Washington, D.C. give an idea of how amazingly close the Maysles brothers were to the center of it all. Their landmark style of creating documentaries provides an amazing ""fly on the wall"" perspective.  There is no narration and there are no formal interviews.  The film lets the event speak for itself as it captures the action quite naturally and spontaneously.  Nothing is staged and the film provides a most intimate look at the Beatles' interaction with each other as well as with the excitement of Beatlemania.  For those of us born too late to witness and experience the mania, this is our link to the past and a glimpse at the beginning of a very important revolution in pop music and culture.
The re-release of this noteworthy documentary provides a noticeable improvement over the original version.  There is now an audio commentary by Albert Maysles.  Furthermore, there is a 51-minute interview with him which includes his presentation of a handful of outtakes from the original film.  One notable highlight of the personal interview includes Maysles' discussion of how his camera was accidentally turned on at the Washington Coliseum concert.  Without a second thought, he propped it up on his shoulder (without security seeing him).  His brief footage provides a very rare view of how a Beatle fan saw and ""heard"" the Beatles play.  It's very clear from the footage that fans interested in listening to the show simply could not do so.  Other intriguing highlights include recorded comments from teenagers and adults on the street and at JFK airport.
The drawbacks to be noted about this DVD are the result of other previous DVD releases including the Ed Sullivan Presents the Beatles DVD set and The Beatles Anthology.  The Sullivan set contains ALL of the shows in their entirety while this release only includes portions of shows.  The Anthology set contains a good segment of the Coliseum concert taken from an absolutely pristine film print and not the more common well-worn copy.  This release still contains the worn footage.  It would have been nice to see a bonus feature containing the complete Coliseum concert from the master print.  However, this DVD is the original documentary and the integrity is maintained throughout.  It's important to note that the Maysles brothers did not have permission to film in either the CBS studios for the Sullivan shows or in the Washington Coliseum. (One other highlight on the extra footage is Paul McCartney trying to come to the brothers' aid when security blocked them from the CBS studio for the first show.)  A color booklet is included with a handful of photos and quotes from each of the Beatles; however, perhaps Apple could have designed a better booklet to include reprints of news articles and reviews from 1964, transcripts of Beatle interviews, and, perhaps, a reprint of the diary of events from Mark Lewishon's Beatles Chronicle.
This is definitely a treat for Beatle fans and a great example of how to produce a quality documentary.  I also recommend the Maysles brothers' production, Gimme Shelter, where they capture the exciting and controversial events surrounding the Rolling Stones 1969 tour, including the tragedy at Altamont.",1075852800,100,3992,5.036474164133739
440065,5,6302213142,"I say second best because nothing can top the Anthology.  But this DVD is a true slice of history that cannot be ignored or undermined by any Beatles fan.

The video opens with clips of their New York press conference on February 7, which is one of my favorites.  Their humor is so off-the-cuff and so incredibly original that you can't help but laugh.  There is footage of the Beatles relaxing in their hotel rooms and generally just being themselves.  This video is similar to ""A Hard Day's Night"" -- the difference on this one is that it's real and pure, not scripted.

The icing on the cake is footage of the group from all three Ed Sullivan Shows from February 1964.  The famous introduction is seen here in full and, while a few songs have been cut out, it is still very exciting.  And certainly nothing beats the excitement of the Washington DC concert which, incidentally, is in the best quality I have ever seen it in.  I find it very amusing to watch the Beatles adjusting their own equipment after every song.  It's a nostalgic reminder of how primitive concerts were back then.

If you are a serious Beatles fan, you need this.  If you are a casual fan, after watching this you will be a die hard fan.  Guaranteed.  There is no escaping the magic and energy of the Beatles' early years, and their 1964 explosion on to the American scene would change everything forever.  So treat yourself to a trip back through time and experience again a time in music that will never be repeated.",1074297600,,1494,4.5018587360594795
440066,5,6302213142,"What an amazing DVD!  Take A Hard Day's Night, and turn it into a real-time documentary of the historic Ed Sullivan appearance.  So many fascinating moments are captured here.  John is visibly thrown by the ""Sorry Girls, he's married."" subtitle, and then acts out hilariously at a terrific concert in DC.  George sits in a hotel room fingerpicking a terrific spontaneous imitation of Bob Dylan's Talkin' Blues, making you want to just shake him and tell him to go ahead and write his own.  Ringo entertains the media non-stop with all kinds of physical comedy, while a strangely petulent Paul sourly comments that he doesn't ""feel like being funny.""
Of course it's the angelic faced bass player who takes the lead for the first couple of songs on Sullivan, and for a while the cameras assume that he is the focus of the band.  Only after the second show in Miami, when John is more prominently featured, does the angle of presentation change, now going past him towards the pair at the other mike, with Ringo centered above.  TV's earliest presentation already picks up on the tension and power of the great rivalry.
Honestly, you get some of this stuff on Anthology and as it is now out of print the cost of tracking one down might be a little prohibitive.  But no mistake, this is a thorough, honest view of a rare, magical moment in the course of popular culture.",1051401600,11,1366,4.639004149377594
440067,4,6302213142,"This is an engaging documentary of The Beatles' first U.S. visit. What makes it so fascinating are their performances on the Ed Sullivan show, which are captured here. Digitally remastered, this early television footage has been expertly restored, enabling the viewers to see and hear The Beatles, as they first appeared on American television.

Cheeky and exhuberant, The Beatles, occasionally off key but having the time of their lives, have not lost the capacity for knocking the socks off the viewer, as they are brimming over with vitality and the joy of life. They are truly wonderful to watch, as well as hear. Fortunately, the video covers all their performances on Ed Sullivan, and what a treat they are! It is sad to think that already two of them, John and George, are no longer with us.

The film documents a more innocent and simple time. It captured The Beatles on the threshold of international fame. It memorialized for all time their first U.S. visit with footage shot in railroad cars, hotel rooms, and limousines. Some of it is somewhat self-conscious, and some of it is playful fun. It also memorialized the reactions of their fans. The film is a daily cinema verite testament to that first visit.

This is a very good documentary that is well worth having soley for the performances of The Beatles. There are over thirteen of them, and the tracks have been digitally remastered for your listening pleasure. Overall, however, the documentary lacks some cohesion, due to the cinema verite nature of the film. Still, it is a worthwhile documentary to have, if only for those wonderful Ed Sullivan performances. If one wants a historical overview of The Beatles, one may also wish to view the more in depth and complex documentary, ""The Compleat Beatles"".",1023235200,46,1772,4.9
440068,5,6302213142,"In my opinion, this DVD is a must for anyone who is a fan of the Beatles (assuming of course they have a DVD player).  This gives a great look at what it must have been like to be alive then (I'm only 20).  To see the excitement, to watch them play, fantastic.  But not only do you get to watch this public side of them, you also get to see them as average guys.  While some may find these behind the scenes scenes a bit on the boring side, I really enjoyed seeing them, as they really were.  What made it especially interesting to me is when they tried to amuse themselves on the train, some of their antics seemed like some of the stuff my friends would do, which really gave them a human quality.  And if you like their music, and of course you do, or you shouldn't be reading this review, then you can just jump to the concert scenes if you wish.
 The video quality and audio is pretty good for the most part, though quite horrible for the Washington DC trip.  Also, I think they should have included all of the Beatle's songs performed on The Ed Sullivan Show. As I understand it, some of them were cut.  Overall though, still a very good disc, with it's good points far outnumbering the bad. As said before, a must for hardcore fans, though newbies may want to check out their movies such as A Hard Days Night and Help!",1022112000,3,1325,4.18503937007874
440069,4,6302213142,"The DVD video quality is quite good for the period considering source material available. I have seen better versions televised on CBS when they do specials, involving some identicle segments.  As for the Audio however, someone forgot to do an A/B comparison with the original unfiltered sound as they went,(or has a tin ear..), before giving it the final press. Other reviewers claim the sound is great for the Sullivan Shows. Not really. And its remarkable what influence good video has on the opinion of those litening to its associated audio. In reality the sound is thin and squished. Worse, it has some sort of steady ""flanged"" type sound effect(less the rotation), and virtually all the low end has been removed, likely with a highpass digitalfilter. The result is bad or missing low dynamic punch that should be there, and a nice analog sound turned digitally inferior. The vocals in particular, sound more-- ""vocally"" true to life on an original, whereas they sound ""processed"", and factory fake on this DVD.(I have some raw '64 Sullivan show video I compared it to. -- Poor video,you bet; but better sound by far) The raw unprocessed sound, is more lifelife, fuller, and real. Its the way it sounded, and way it should always sound. The filtered, thinned-out and compressed version on this DVD, take a bit of the magic and realism out. Too bad. The Wow and flutter control worked out quite well, but I must wonder if it was at the expense of the aforementioned lifelessness quality it resulted in. Only those with other sullivan show video would see the dynamic range and audio differences. And I don't mean to imply it's Huge. Yet its not so subtle it will escape you either. Without it to compare to, sure they'd say it sounds great. But to whomever the sound engineer was on this: You get a D. Next time use the A/B switch, and get a second opinion. You may just go with the original unaltered analog track.
As for content, thats been covered in other reviews. I liked it!! And its such a nice collection all in one place that overall I rate this 4 of 5. If audio hadnt been fiddled with I'd give it a 5+",1014163200,4,2117,4.615384615384615
440100,5,6302213142,"""The first U.S visit"" of The Beatles is unquestionable the most extraordinary dvd movie you could possibly find today. It is so nice to go back to the sweet sixties and to the four beetles, and everybody knows how great those guys were.
If you're looking for something to keep for another twenty years or a lot more, don't think twice. Beautiful. Special show, I'm speechless. Perfect music of the best of the best- The Beatles/",1008892800,2,428,4.644736842105263
440101,5,6302213142,"This is an amazing document.  Ringo's and Paul's nervous glances out the limo window upon their first glimpses of New York, John's rapier put-down of Murray the K (shamelessly riding the Beatles' coattails) in their hotel room moments before they leave for the first Sullivan performance, and Ringo's joyous dancing at the Peppermint Lounge make the Beatles accessible in a way all the press coverage and adulation never could.  They perform knowing full well just how good they are (like John's solo on This Boy), their confidence and ability live before tens of millions of viewers.  By the time they leave for England, though, the guardedness has begun to set in.  You don't even need to be a fan to like this one because this is a fascinating view of the private world of four young men about to become global icons.",999216000,4,820,4.753521126760563
440102,4,6302213142,"I don't know if anybody's commented on this before, but this is eerie: there's an early scene in this video, set in the Beatles New York hotel room, just before they're about to leave to tape the first Ed Sullivan appearance. John is noodling around on what looks like a melodion, tooting apparently random notes while conversation swirls around him. Then the notes resolve into something very much like the opening of ""Strawberry Fields Forever."" I swear on Brian Epstein's grave - that's what it sounds like. The pitch isn't exactly the same, but if you have ears to hear it you will hear it too. If you own this tape or DVD, check it out.",992822400,7,641,4.5344827586206895
440103,5,6302213142,"I love this video.  I really do.  I am SO GLAD that I have it.  This is such a treat!
This delightful video traces the Beatles' first visit to the U.S. in February, 1964.  The video opens with New York disc jockey Murray (""the K"") Kaufman, introducing the Beatles via radio.  Fans flock to the airport in masse to greet the Beatles' plane, Pan Am flight 101 on February 7, 1964.
The Beatles themselves are trailed from the minute they step off the plane to the limo to their hotel to their endorsement of AM-radio station, WINS per Murray the K.  From the hotel, we, the viewers are treated to the Beatles' first performance on Ed Sullivan's TV show on February 9, 1964.  From that point, we are ushered along with the Beatles via train to Washington, D.C. for a live concert.  After we ""Twist and Shout"" there, we then travel to Miami with the Beatles for a special performance on Ed Sullivan.
From Florida, the video tracks the Beatles to New York for their February 16, 1964 performance on Ed Sullivan.  One wants to cheer for them -- the music is as fresh, vibrant and fun as it was in 1964.
After the famous Ed Sullivan performance, we then rejoin the Beatles for some light banter and impromptu jamming in their hotel rooms.  After a light hearted respite, we then board the plane bound for England.
I love this video.  It is pure fun, yeah, yeah, yeah!",992044800,4,1359,4.439516129032258
440104,5,6302213142,"As a Beatle fan this film is a must-have and a testament to the marvel, charm, and magic of The Beatles. The live performances from the Ed Sullivan shows are alone worth the price; the picture is clear and the sound is excellent, and I was (I'm not embarrassed to admit) a bit misty-eyed as I watched the lads perform some of their best songs from the early days. These ain't some lip-sync'd, fake American Bandstand performances. The concert scenes are something else-they are grainy, dark and barely audible, but then again, you won't really care, because it's great to see the boys perform live anytime. In this day and age of no-name flash-in-the-pan rock bands, bland singer-songwriters, idiotic dance music, and tuneless, mindless and obnoxious rap, it is refreshing to listen and watch THE masters perform real music.",966902400,13,824,4.9352517985611515

You can also feel the coming tension that would finally take  hold of the Beatles, as you see them jocky for camera positions, etc., and  you get a real feel for what it's like to have that much attention on you  24/7....It's amazing they lasted as long as they did....
A short inside  story:  When the Beatles did their first Shea Stadium show, I was there  with my band to see them....and that's all anyone who was there did: see  them.
Right before they were to come out on the stage, everyone was  looking for Ringo's drums, and the famous Beatles Bass Drum head. Right  before the Beatles are to take the stage, a stage hand walks over to the  drums Sounds Incorporated was using, and pulled away the fake bass drum  head and there it was: The Beatles......a scream went up in the 50,000+  crowd that lasted until the Beatles left, and that was all anyone  heard.......But I wouldn't trade that memory for anything",960163200,6,1133,4.595
440106,3,6302213142,"I remember waiting patiently years ago for somebody to release the February, 1964 appearances of the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. This video represents that, plus much of the hotel/limousine/Peppermint Lounge footage shot by the Maysles brothers during their historic first tour of the United States. While this represents a nice overview and entertaining video of that period, it could have been much more. Unfortunately, several of the songs from the Sullivan shows are NOT in the video; only ""extracts"" (the video's term!) are depicted. The entirety of the Beatles' 1964 Ed Sullivan performances are priceless. It's truly a shame that we may never get to see a commercially available release of all of this footage. The Maysles' film footage, however, is wonderful. In hindsight, it's amazing that these brothers had that much access to the Beatles. Much of this film was shot in the front seat of limousines and hotel rooms. I have to give the video a ""C+."" It could very easily have been an ""A+""
(Update:6/27/03) This is to add to my initial review:  A 2-disc DVD set was released late last year of all four Ed Sullivan 1964/1965 televised performances.  This set, which was advertised for about a month during the Fall 2002, features the entire Ed Sullivan broadcasts (including commercials) and all other acts.

This video puts you right in the middle of everything they experienced (well, almost) on their  February, 1964 trip. Their arrival, and press conference, at Idlewild  Airport, taxi rides, photo shoots, after hours parties and all 3 Ed  Sullivan Show appearances in their entirety. Also included are 3 songs from  the Washington Coliseum concert. After watching this video, it's easy to  understand why Americans were captivated by these guys. It's also very  apparent why the Beatles could only tolerate this ""mania"" for 2  more years. I wish I could have experienced it firsthand.",955065600,15,706,5.086956521739131
