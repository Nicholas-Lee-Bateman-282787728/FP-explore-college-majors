7893737,3,6305582882,"The plot was perfect, but it seems as though they ran out of money while doing the movie so they couldn't make it as amazing  as it could have been.  The story involves 4 fighters brought together to take down a band of Kung  fu pirates led by an evil minded martial arts master, and his 8 foot  shaolin monk, who looks more goofy then scary.  The movie is not bad and  there are some interesting fight sequences, along with some cool bad guys.  but i feel that it could have been alot better. The final fight though is  very good and ends in a very unpredictable way.",965088000,,568,4.194444444444445
