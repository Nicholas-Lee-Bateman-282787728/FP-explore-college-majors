2697813,3,B000KWZ2YW,"Bobobo has been one of my favorite anime for a while and I'm glad to see that it's finally getting an unedited DVD release.  It's not for everyone but if you like extremely weird, wacky, and random humor Bobobo is for you.

Now about the DVD itself.  First the good news, it's unedited, has good video quality, and the english dub, while heavily localized in spots, is very good.  Unfortunately, the lack of proper subtitles to accompnay the Japanese language track is a huge problem.  Instead we just get the closed captioning text for the English version.  Plus, they don't even stay on the screen long enough for anyone except a speed reader.  These problems, and a few other more minor flaws knocked two stars off my rating.

If you don't mind sticking to the English dub or can speak Japanese the problems won't bother you too much.  And, short of imports or illegal downloads this is the only way to get your hands on an excellent show.",1171843200,7,942,4.559523809523809
2697814,1,B000KWZ2YW,"Ok...I can see having a dubtitle track for the hearing impaired with the american dubbing, BUT WHERE'S OUR ORIGINAL JAPANESE SUBTITLE SCRIPT!? I feel lied to, especially being the DVD had ""original uncut episodes"" on the box, and granted, it does...but, without the original script, you might as well not even put that on the box and just say, ""Here's the original episodes, but, you can guess what they are really saying. Ha ha!""

I do not recommend this to anyone. Try and find the imported DVDs online somewhere with better english ""ORIGINAL SCRIPT"" fansubs. F for grade!",1171584000,,574,4.857142857142857
2697815,1,B000KWZ2YW,"If you watched this show on Cartoon Network and are buying this DVD just to relive the Cartoon Network experience then this is for you.  If you are a hardcore anime collector and are looking to see this show in it's orginal Japanese turn as far away from this as possible.  The subtitle track for the Japanese language is in fact just a hearing impared track for the dub of the show.  So not only does it have things like (laughing) or (yelling) in the subs but sometimes there will be subtitles when no one is even talking because they added voices in the dub that wern't there in the original Japanese audio.  The ""dubtitles"" also fly by at such a fast rate that you can't even read how incorrect they are most of the time.  On top of several other technical issues I can't recommend this release to anyone.  Flat out terrible.  It's a shame to because the show underneath it is actually really good.  It just suffers from an absolutly horrible presentation.",1170720000,4,960,4.477011494252873
2697816,5,B000KWZ2YW,"A very funny spoof of all hero stories, the one who controls the fist of the nose hair defends his blonde afro and the hair of others against evil (sometimes wearing a bridal gown).",1169424000,4,181,4.352941176470588
8159263,5,B000KWZ2YW,"""Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo: Bo-nafide Protector"" is the first installment in the series that both is anime and mocks anime with its surreal randomness. Though I hear much discussion of the inadequacy of the subtitles presented here, I'm happy to stick with generally good English dub. The first four episodes of the show are on this disc, and they are excellent.

In ""Bo-nafide Soulful Bo-tector of Hair"", Bo-Bobo first reveals his magic nose hair and the two squirrels living in his afro, and as he protects the village he reveals he's also a nose hair poet and has the ability to hear everyone's hair, while he fights his mortal enemy Baldy Bald and his henchmen at Hair Hunt Headquarters. We also get a bit about his heritage, learning that his father was ""Nappy Pappy"" and while he was just a hairball, he never used bargain-priced conditioner.

""Let's Get Wiggy With It"" lets us see ""A Very Bo-Bobo Christmas"" where he wins a year's supply of hot pepper flavored artificial gelatin, but, oh, the pathos! Bo-Bobo is allergic.

In ""Wacky Quacker Cooks His Own Goose"" Bo-Bobo attends a festival advertising ""Free pomade and hair scrunchies for all. Not recommended for big toe hairs"". The animators cleverly break the fourth wall in this episode, and we learn the duck's father is alive and living in Bo-Bobo's afro. You see the father duck fell in love with Ursula, a pair of underwear, and their union spawns a duck and underwear hybrid and gives rise to the eternal question ""Am I a weird duck, or just a pair of undies?"" Of course it turns out the hybrid is a ""dundie"", which we learn as Bo-Bobo engages in some hamburger research.

Finally, in ""Bababa-ba Ba-baba! The Honorable King Nose Hair"" the episode starts out with subplots about bears stuffed with beans, pork rind soup delivery, and Fern Day, in which you are expected to dress up as your favorite kind of fern. But enough of the preliminary sensibilities: Bo-Bobo turns into a tank and starts a war over tater tots (note the nice tater tot jingle), which, of course, leads to a marketing pitch for nose hair rings marketed to high school girls between 16 and 16 1/2. To bring this, the trippiest of the four episodes to a close, we learn that King Nose Hair awakens in Bo-Bobo's nose every 3,000 years, and wanders the Nasal Passages of Life on a red bicycle.

Clearly, this entire show is a spoof of the more over-the-top elements of anime, and like ""Perfect Hair Forever"" simultaneously advances the genre while gently mocking it. Of course much is nonsensical (and I didn't even mention Don Patch, the orange hedgehog), but if you like anime (or if you don't) this is a joyful noise on entertainment's sonic spectrum.",1473552000,4,2679,4.728051391862955
8159264,4,B000KWZ2YW,"I love this DVD. It works fine, but I give it four stars because when I got it in the mail, the DVD was not fastened in and was just jumbling about the case, which could have led to scratches (but thankfully there were none). Also, the menu is REALLY loud and scared the mess out of me, so just a heads up.",1451692800,,306,3.873015873015873
8159265,3,B000KWZ2YW,The video is good but the sub-titles are timed so briefly that we cannot read them.  This is a gift for a hearing-impaired individual so it is challenging to watch it when she cannot read much of what the sub-titles say. I watched it with her and I could not read them and I am a fast reader.,1297123200,,292,4.0344827586206895
8159266,4,B000KWZ2YW,"i first saw this show as a kid on toonami it was so funny, weird, and wacky!! also when i heard that it came on dvd i was so exited, this dvd was great and came in awesome condition! 4/5 i would give this because the japanese subs weren't right:( also i wonder why illumitoon stopped making these dvds:(",1249430400,,303,4.1525423728813555
8159267,1,B000KWZ2YW,"This series is pure randomness. I don't know whether this is supposed to be a parody or comedy anime. Though I don't think that matters because either way you slice the bacon Bobobobo bobo fails as either a comedy or parody.
Say it with me people randomness doesn't always equal a successful comedy or parody!
Predictably the anime purists cry watch it in Japanese the Japanese version is better.
I doubt it!
This series is so nonsensical that you don't even need talented actors or screenwriters to adapt this series. As far as I can tell this show is just one big ad-lib only not nearly as funny and enduring as White Chicks, Airplane and Monty Python's Holy Grail.",1220227200,,667,4.61344537815126
8159268,2,B000KWZ2YW,"The subtitles that are in this DVD are those for the english script. Which, unless you speak Japanese, you're not going to understand anything in the original Japanese dub. However the 2nd DVD to be released DOES have subtitles that match up to the original Japanese script.",1206576000,,274,4.851063829787234
8159269,4,B000KWZ2YW,"I love this DVD because it has japanese, japanese with english subtitles, and dubbed english. At first the menu is a bit unorganized but it was not an inconvienience. I do not think the english subtitles for the japanese moved too fast. The dvd came with a hologram cover thing that peels of so I put it in my locker. :)",1182902400,,320,4.262295081967213
8159270,5,B000KWZ2YW,Bobobo is a very quirky and random anime. They are constantly cracking jokes and making parodies of other manga and anime. I really enjoy watching this and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime and over the top humor.,1182470400,2,225,4.65
