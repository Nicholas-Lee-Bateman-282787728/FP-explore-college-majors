8371578,5,B002JPYIY8,"In 2008, Mark Gatiss created and wrote the 3-part miniseries CROOKED HOUSE for BBC.  The series aired in three 30-minute segments and was later released as one 90-minute movie on DVD.  This is how I saw it, and CROOKED HOUSE is right up my alley.

The framing story begins when Ben brings an antique doorknocker hes found in his yard to a local museum where the curator tells him it came from the now-demolished Geap Manor.

Geap Manor, the curator says, had a long and dark history, then begins to relate a couple of stories of past goings-on to Ben.

In the first story, set in the 18th century, Joseph Bloxham has purchased and is renovating the manor in the aftermath of a market crash that left one of his fellow investors destitute.  While trying to not let the mans suicide, nor his abandoned wife and three children, bother him, Bloxham is awoken every night to a strange sound coming from behind the recently-installed wainstcotting.  This was a surprisingly tense story, and very creepy and atmospheric with wonderful sound design.

In the next story, set in the 1920s, a party is going on at the manor when Felix announces to everyone present that he and Ruth are engaged.  Everyone is happy and the pair split up to mingle with the partygoers when Ruth spots a mysterious figure dressed in a wedding gown making her way through the crowd.  Ruth thinks the woman is one of Felixs reputed mistresses, but when Felixs grandmother finds her crying in bed, she relates a story of another bride-to-be in Geap Manor years ago, a bride-to-be who caught her intended with another woman and, instead of bearing witness to the sight, stabbed out her own eyes, then put a curse on any future weddings within the halls of Geap Manor.

With that, the curator decides hes told enough stories and he sends Ben on his way, insisting he take the doorknocker with him, even though Ben offers to let it stay here in the museum.  He takes it home, affixes it to his door, then goes about his life.

Late one night, though, hes awoken by a knocking at the door.  When he goes down to see who it is, theres no one there.  Ben steps outside, then the door closes on him.  Luckily hes got a spare key outside, but when he lets himself back inside, his flat is gone, replaced by a sprawling mansion, and strange voices coming from somewhere within.

When it happens again, Ben removes the doorknocker and tries to return it to the museum only to find the place has been closed for several years.  But something about one of the stories the curator mentioned makes Ben think hes part of something much more sinister than just a mysterious doorknocker than lets him walk into the past.

And hes right.  In fact, what happens next, when his pregnant ex-girlfriend shows up one night in labor will change everything Ben knows, and none of it for the better.

CROOKED HOUSE is just the kind of thing I like to see.  Weve got a house thats inexplicably cursed with no discernable cause other than evil is, as one character says, just attracted to the building.  Weve got suspenseful stories with tight writing and excellent acting.  And the effects are amazing, minimal as they were.

The individual stories might not all be winners--that second one was okay, but not nearly as effective as the first and third stories--but overall the movie succeeds very well.

Philip Jackson gave Bloxham a hard edge with a secret soft side, a side he struggles with in his society when stature and success brought with it a certain list of reservations, things allowed by society as well as things not allowed, not if he hoped to maintain his status, that is.

Lee Ingleby as Ben gave the story just enough wide-eyed wonder that it made the mystery seem a little deeper, a little more sinister, especially during the climax.  The ending was excellent and part of that credit goes to Ingleby for his performance.

Damon Thomas directed the series, and his use of shadows as well as framing, what to show, what to imply, was just as effective at telling the story as the dialogue and acting.  I imagine he could tell a convincing story with no actors at all just in the way he uses the camera to convey the visual aspects.

For me, CROOKED HOUSE was a great success and a movie that will stick with me for a while as I ponder some of the creepier moments and try to figure out how to steal them for my own work.  Hey, Im not proud.",1385424000,,4396,4.532319391634981
8371579,5,B002JPYIY8,"This 2008 BBC supernatural series contains three linked episodes centering on a creepy old Tudor mansion, the fictional Geap Manor. The series opens with a young man named Ben who brings an antique door knocker to a museum curator (played by Mark Gatiss who also wrote and co-produced the show). The curator narrates the stories regarding the history of the house to Ben.

In the first, ""The Wainscoting"", the setting is 18th century England and centers around Joseph Bloxham, a wealthy speculator who uses his money (derived from swindling other speculators) to remodel Geap Manor. He spares no expense and is particularly captivated by the elegant wainscoting in his study. It is only later that Bloxham begins to suspect all is not well when he hears strange whisperings and sees dark splotches appearing on his wainscoting at night. When the discovery of the true origins of the wainscoting is revealed, will Bloxham escape in time?

The second story, ""Something Old"", takes place in the 1920s, and Geap Manor is the setting for a costume ball. At the ball, Felix de Momery announces his engagement to the beautiful Ruth Sykes much to the shock of his old Gran and a woman named Katherine who had once been Felix's girlfriend. Not long after, Ruth, the bride-to-be sees a mysterious woman dressed in bridal finery with a veil covering her face. Ruth begins to feel all is not right and it is only after prodding that Gran reveals a tragedy that occurred in the family back in the 1800s, a tragedy that continues to have an impact on the present.

In the final story, ""The Knocker"", Ben discovers the awful origins of Geap Manor which has forever tarnished the building. It has to do with a wicked necromancer and what Ben doesn't quite realize is that the house's evil origins has tainted the very ground upon which it stood. There's also a shocking twist towards the end that gave me the chills!

Each story runs about half an hour, and makes for compelling viewing. I would recommend this anthology to fans of supernatural-themed dramas. I would love to have this DVD released in the US but for now there's always youtube.",1368489600,3,2128,4.774456521739131
