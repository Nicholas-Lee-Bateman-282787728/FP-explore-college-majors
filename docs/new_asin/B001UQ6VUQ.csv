8344796,5,B001UQ6VUQ,This is a good review of memory distortion and false memories.  The stories of false convictions due to memory distortion are real and grab your attention.,1258329600,,155,4.961538461538462
8344797,5,B001UQ6VUQ,"More and more of these cases are coming out, and it shows how inept the US Justice System really is. Cotton went through hell for something he didn't do, while the real scum was nearby in another cell, not saying a thing, and making sure that he wouldn't get more time in jail for what he actually did.
Cotton is more forgiving than I would be towards the woman and the system for what he went through.
Get the book, ""Picking Cotton"" which adds more details and fleshes out all the history of this case featured on to 60 Minutes.",1258243200,,529,4.3
8344798,5,B001UQ6VUQ,This is an excellent teaching tool for my psychology courses to show examples of how what you see is not always what is real.  I highly suguest others view this segment as well.,1250208000,,177,4.363636363636363
8344799,4,B001UQ6VUQ,"I teach high school psychology, and this segment is very good for showing the limitations of memory and the dangers of reconstructed memories.

It's short enough to be shown in a typical high school period and still allow time for discussion and reflection.",1248998400,,257,4.976744186046512
8344800,5,B001UQ6VUQ,"An amazing story!  A horrible crime, a smart and sympathetic victim, but our justice system is flawed. An innocent man went to prison for years until the real criminal was found.  I was surprised, moved and fascinated by this 2 part 60 Minutes story. One of their best.",1248480000,2,269,4.583333333333333
