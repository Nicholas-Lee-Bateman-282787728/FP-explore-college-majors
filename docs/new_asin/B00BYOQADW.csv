5682823,5,B00BYOQADW,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: Watching Call Me Kuchu, you will want to check a calendar. In Uganda they have newspapers that use words of pure hate and propaganda - and they do it proudly. They want to sell newspapers, even if their articles, and images, cause the beatings and death of innocent men and women. You may get physically ill as the editor of the national paper called ""Rolling Stone"" (NO relation to the famous music mag) smiles and nervously smirks that he is doing right for his country folk.

The gay and lesbian issue has always seemed to divide people around the world, from many religious tendencies. Throwing verses out of a book(s) about there being something wrong with same sex coupling; each resource is usually thousands of years old and written with societal control of peoples at-the-time very uneducated, naturally media-free, career sheep herders or such, as its readership; or listeners as very few were schooled for fear of rising above their stations.

And, right now (as the review is typed) Uganda tried to pass into law - introduced in 2012 - to kill homosexuals, and imprison anyone who does not turn in a homosexual (even said person's own child).

Call Me Kuchu follows a few brave citizens who rallied against the would be law. They share their everyday horrors of being unaccepted and persecuted. Sadly, you watch Uganda only relent in the 24th hour due to being threatened by America, Canada and others that financial aid was going to be denied and the United Nations strongly warned the country of the human rights issue that could not be tolerated.

Human rights are a huge issue. In Uganda they are attacking homosexuals, in other areas women, or castes. Call Me Kuchu is a brave gritty unpolished shocker. History is being made - at the cost of lives - and as technology makes the world smaller. Here, perhaps, we can use documentaries like this to help spread what is happening ""over there"" and save humans from other humans.

You watch upon a semi-catatonic edge as men and women, just trying to live, are exposed in the news, beaten in the streets, and forced to move from their homes. Their ""crime"" is being homosexual.

Why would a loving God or His son, who Christians know would live among the ""lowest"" peasants, wish harm to anyone, let alone a person they created in their own image? Obviously, this reviewer is pro-equal rights - pro humanity. But, beyond the personal morals, is a logical argument for the ridiculous persecution of people who may by different than you, but in no way affect your life.

The law was stopped; albeit not for the right reasons. People can make a difference, one brave advocate at a time.",1382054400,2,2691,4.749464668094219

8575651,5,B00BYOQADW,"This documentary is not one you will be able to forget. It explores the lives of LGBTI people in a gentle, humorous and heartbreaking way, but the backdrop of a deeply homophobic culture is terrifying. There is footage of right wing, Christian evangelists from America, saying that ""the battle (against homosexuality) has been lost"" in the US but that ""Uganda can be a light for the world"". After seeing the lies that are being spread, the hatred that is growing and the unreasonable fear against LGBTI people, getting to know real LGBTI Ugandans and their families and friends through this film makes you question, ""why - and how - is this happening?"" The subjects of the film are brave and inspiring, but after watching them, I couldn't help but feel an urgency to stand up and speak out against the lies spread by the Western fundamentalists. Everyone should watch this, and everyone should speak up!",1394668800,3,903,4.832258064516129
8575652,5,B00BYOQADW,"Uganda has in the last few years been in the news for all the wrong reasons . As the most homophobic country of Africa where the toxic influence of american evangelicals has certaintly produced ""fruits"" , the central african nation has almost reached a point of legal embrace of discrimination .

This documentary is simply heart braking . It's basic characters are David Kato , activist of LGTB rights , David Bahati, a  politician who has penned and promoted the controversial law which brought the death penalty to people guilty of ""homosexual acts"" and Giles Muhame , publisher of the magazine Rolling Stone.( no relation to the american famous magazine ) which published articles shamelessly demonizing gay people and inciting hatred with tittles such as "" Hang Them ! "" ,
Ignorance thrives in the central african nation and we see players of public policy comparing it with Kleptomania . Articles full of conspirancy theories even suggest that islamist terrosties cooperate with gay people ( !?!? ) in order to hurt the country .
One could imagine that David Bahati could have been an even more ignorant version of your average tea-party republican if the US societal concept allowed him to fully materialize their beliefs yet any viewer would have a hard time finding a character as repulsive
as Muhame. David Kato himself was murdered during the filming of this so this documentary became unintentionally a biopic of the last months of his life . The most cold blooding moment comes when we see Muhame giggling about it the next day .

Even when the president of Uganda makes his appearance , by talking in a voice over ( "" Hilary Clinton wanted to talk to me ..about GAYS !...President Obama called me ..about homosexuals !..."" ) he seems to be spitting the words with disgust .
It's strange to think how different the same thing would sound like with a softer voice and a couple of terms changed ( "" Hilary Clinton wanted to talk to me about discrimination. President Obama called to talk about equality of LGTB Ugandans "" )

No matter what your political opinions are about , whether you are for gay marriage or against , it's impossible not to sympathize with the gay activists in a country where even a priest in a funeral curses the deceased for his sexuality , instead of simply saying good bye to another human being . Sadly their strugle is one about survival against official  persecussion and not about equality .",1386460800,2,2432,4.753554502369668
8575653,5,B00BYOQADW,"Heartbreaking but powerful.  This film depicts recent Ugandan struggles over same-sex sexualities through centering the voices and perspectives of Ugandans. The film situates the Ugandan struggle in international context (US conservative Christian evangelicals & Western resistance to the 'Kill the Gays Bill') but rightly helps focuses on Uganda. Although I haven't yet seen it, Brett Davidson ([...]) suggests that ""God Loves Uganda"" is a good compliment as it focuses on the US story.",1385164800,3,487,5.671232876712328
8575654,5,B00BYOQADW,This documentary covers the rarely seen lives and struggle of gay africans and in this case the murderous colonialism of the American Evangelical movement.,1382140800,4,155,5.5
