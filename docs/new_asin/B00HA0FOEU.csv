6152616,5,B00HA0FOEU,"I'd been anticipating this latest installment of the Columbo series to add to my collection.  I wasn't disappointed! ""Murder Can Be Hazardous To Your Health"" guest-starring George Hamilton, making his second appearance as a murderer in a Columbo episode, is very good.  ""Death Hits The Jackpot"" is one of my favorites (a chimpanzee helps solve the case, what's not to like?) and Tyne Daly gives a great performance in ""A Bird In The Hand"".
I was a little disappointed with ""It's All In The Game"" (although I know many would disagree with me). The murderer's method and alibi are nearly identical to a season one episode ""Suitable For Framing"".  Also, the flirtation between Faye Dunaway's character and Columbo is a little off-putting for those who consider Columbo's adoration and dedication to the mysterious Mrs. Columbo a core part of his character. All in all this is a great collection.  Already looking forward to the last installment including ""Butterfly In Shades Of Grey"" with William Shatner and ""Ashes to Ashes"" with frequent Columbo guest star Patrick McGoohan.",1297900800,33,1074,5.0852272727272725
6152617,4,B00HA0FOEU,"Overall, this movie series is really good, I love the show and the character, and Peter Falk is one in a million.  I was a little disappointed in these later movies - to keep up with modern morals in TV, there were racier sex scenes and more profanity, and Columbo allows the Faye Dunaway character to kiss him and he's excited about it...  that wouldn't have happened in the early shows of Columbo, and I prefer the modest, almost prudish, character of the early days; they certainly don't make them like that anymore!",1297641600,21,519,4.56989247311828
6152618,5,B00HA0FOEU,"Columbo reappears in our DVD collections one more time.  To supplement the TV season collection, 6 films are represented for the first time.  Originally aired from 1991-1993, these episodes are just as good as the first time  I saw them 20 years ago (yikes!)

They are:

Caution:  Murder Can Be Hazardous To Your Health
Columbo and the Murder of A Rock Star
Death Hits the Jackpot
No Time To Die
A Bird in the Hand
It's All in the Game

With performances by George Hamilton, Faye Dunaway, Little Richard, Louis Herthum and Rip Torn, each segment is a winner.  I particularly enjoyed Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health in which Hamilton as an unsolved Crime Host is himself guilty of the same.  A nearly perfect murder leaves ONE piece of evidence.

I look forward to the next instalment of the series.",1297296000,4,805,4.605633802816901
6152619,5,B00HA0FOEU,Peter Falk nobody can play Columbo like he did!  I love his mannerisms.  My speciality is homicide.  Also the other saying is a classic and that is Oh Just ONE MORE THING.  A real detective that uses his mind and is really a genius at that.  A scruffy dressed man.  His first name is Lieutenant .  I just love it.  He always knows who the murderer is and always gets his killer.,1296086400,,378,4.152777777777778
6152620,5,B00HA0FOEU,While I would argue the earlier moview are his best - it is hard to fault Columbo.  His style is unique and the stories are good.  If you are like many that cought the 80's and 90's movies on TV as re-runs but haven't seen the original series from the 70's staring the same cast - then you are missing out.  Go buy all of them - you won't regret it.,1295308800,4,349,3.887323943661972
6152621,5,B00HA0FOEU,"I have to wait 30 more days for this, but I can tell you right now, it will be worth the wait.  I have every Columbo CD that is available and I plan on completing my collection with this one and the anticipated one to follow to finish the collection.  Peter Falk should receive a lifetime Emmy for this series. The very best series ever put on television.",1294617600,12,355,4.205882352941177
6152622,5,B00HA0FOEU,"Columbo does it again with this next box set of 6 great episodes. While all the Columbo episodes have been released in Europe, we are now seeing a continuation of the releases in the US.

My only hope is a Bluray release with additional behind the scenes, trivia, etc as Peter Falk has made Columbo an iconic detective worldwide. No other detective has been referenced more in television than Columbo.

For more Columbo, do check out [...]",1294012800,10,439,4.688311688311688
6152623,5,B00HA0FOEU,"The episodes mentioned by the previous reviewer aired from 1994 to 2003.  The episodes which should be featured on this set are as follows:

1. ""Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health"" - Feb. 20, 1991 (with George Hamilton)
2. ""Columbo and the Murder of a Rock Star"" - April 29, 1991 (Dabney Coleman, Little Richard cameo)
3. ""Death Hits the Jackpot"" - Dec. 15, 1991 (Rip Torn, Gary Kroeger)
4. ""No Time to Die"" - March 15, 1992 (Joanna Going, Thomas Calabro)
5. ""A Bird in the Hand"" - Nov. 22, 1992 (Greg Evigan, Tyne Daly)
6. ""It's All in the Game"" - Oct. 31, 1993 (Faye Dunaway)

The next episode, ""Butterfly in Shades of Grey"" with William Shatner, was shown in Finland in Nov. 1993, but not in the US until Jan. 1994.  I'm guessing it will appear on the final set, 1994-2003.

Of the above six, my favorites are 1, 3 and 6.  But all of them are entertaining.",1289347200,215,872,4.319018404907975
6152624,2,B00HA0FOEU,"Allthough most movies from columbo are quite good. This last box is a mixed lot. It is already  out in Europe. The first movie Undercover is quite bad. The second, third and fourth movies ,  Strange bedfellows, A Trace of Murder and Ashes to ashes are quite good columbo's.  The last two are very bed and should never have been put on DVD Murder with too many notes has a storyline which does not work and Columbo likes the Nightlife is really a mess.

So paying for three interesting movies so much is a matter you must decide for yourself. I personally would not do it.

6152645,5,B00HA0FOEU,"Very entertaining movies. I enjoyed all 6. Very well put together. They followed the traditional format, in which the murder is shown, and the real fun is watching how Columbo investigates. I particularly like that no small detail escapes him, no matter how absurd the detail is, if it bothers him, he'll make it count! I also enjoy how he meticulously questions and practically tortures the suspects into confessing. Some of them even congratulate him for sending them to jail! Also enjoyed the cameos (especially the Little Richard's). Very refreshing. This whole set is worth getting. Very entertaining. I recommend it.",1490054400,,622,5.1683168316831685

6152660,5,B00HA0FOEU,"As a big fan of the Columbo TV series, I think I've watched every episode 20 times.  What I didn't realize until recently, however, is that Columbo returned to the ""small screen"" in 1989 after a hiatus of almost 10 years.  Yes, there were Columbo movies made for TV from 1989 to 2003.  I've ordered all of them on DVD from Amazon, and this '91 to '93 collection represents only a small part of what I'll be watching for quite a while.",1468886400,,434,4.2682926829268295

6152669,3,B00HA0FOEU,"There's more time spent on the characters and their plot line rather than Columbo's antics as in the 60's, 70's and 80's episodes. Also, I guess the early 90's Columbo's decided to get racy. These episodes feel part soap opera, part crime drama.",1453420800,6,245,4.72093023255814

6152680,5,B00HA0FOEU,"I love his work here.  I was an understudy for a nearly retired sexual assault instigator for a PD in California.  The whole reason I started watching Columbo is because he reminded me of my instructor.  His aging gave me more interest in Columbo...and older guy getting the perpetrator. I believe his acting got better with age, and the writers did not let us down with this series.  I believe if you are a Columbo fan, at the very least, it will be a FOUR STAR Rating for you.  You will also save 10-12 bucks by purchasing the series instead of one by one.  This is a great series for a Friday, or Saturday night...The Plots are excellent, and the photography got better in the latter years.",1441756800,4,693,4.417322834645669
6152681,3,B00HA0FOEU,"here's my star rating for these DVD
DVD collection-5 stars..you will save at least $10 if you buy this set rather than buying separate 1991-1993,1994-2003 collection
DVD-5 stars--clear pictures,full screen with crisp sounds and one-sided DVDs
Episodes-3 stars---very few good episodes in 1991-1993 collection (3 episodes), 1994-2003 collection (2 episodes)
Mr Falk as Columbo -2 stars--the producers should have retired him  and replaced by a younger Columbo..he looks older and doesn't seem to fit his character anymore....anyway it was still fun to watch him crack his murder cases 100%
my collection is now complete!

They are even better than the Columbo TV shows and they were all good. Peter Falk seems even more relaxed in these movies and as a result he is at the top of his game.

6152726,5,B00HA0FOEU,"What a treat! This dvd mystery movie collection is just that. Death Hits the jackpot shows the audience a very differnt kind of mystery unlike any other columbo eposide! A Bird in the hand is very well written. We get to see one of his well talked about nephews in the hit No Time to die with an outstanding cast. But Its all in the game will blow all Columbo fans away. It truly leaves the audience guessing! We aren't even prepared for the emotional motive behind this stellar eposide. A true mystery collection,it gets 5 stars! Excellent dvd!",1402704000,,545,4.515151515151516

6152730,5,B00HA0FOEU,"If you're a fan of Columbo, reading my review is a waste of time.  Go get this collection and start watching.  If you don't know who Columbo is, be aware that this is a series made famous during the 80s so don't expect wild special effects.  However, Columbo doesn't need that stuff.  Columbo always starts with the murder and you can clearly see who the murderer is.  So where is the intrigue?  Columbo is a fascinating character himself with his cigar that he early on puffed away at and eventually he states he is trying to quit.  His famous line ""just one more thing"" or some variation of that, continues throughout each movie.  He appears as a bumbling fool, often embarrassingly so but if you're a fan, you know he is actually brilliant and is picking away at the ""cover up"" each murder is attempting in order to try to get away with murder.  Columbo is incorruptible even as he is compassionate when the criminal's deed has been uncovered and displayed to the world.  I recommend anything Columbo!",1398902400,3,1004,4.589887640449438

Probably becuase these are the ones that got me hooked on the LT when I was a kid (the first one I recall watching in full was Death Hits The Jackpot, with Rip Torn). Back in 1991-1993 when we had no cable TV and Saturday nights were a desolate waste land of Empty Nest and Dr. Quinn, every once in a while, if all was right with the world, we got a special Saturday Night Mystery Movie, starring the one and only Peter Falk as Lt. Columbo. Still get that feeling of joy in my chest,,,""New Columbo Saturday!"" I do recommend all eras of this show, but these hold a place as my favorites.",1397779200,,637,4.186991869918699

6152744,5,B00HA0FOEU,"Some of the fun of these later season's are the fact that Columbo has become predictable, but still entertaining and likeable.  I miss the big name actors as the murderers, and one of the shows is obviously a sweeps week salacious bit of fluff, but still fun.",1386460800,,259,4.51063829787234

It's nostalgic, for one thing--the cameos by all those old actors are a kick. And it's also a hoot to see how technology looked not that many years ago. But mostly, I love the films because Peter Falk is just plain terrific in them. It's very easy to see why he won multiple Emmys for this role--seemingly created just for him. Now and then, there's a role that fits an actor so well that you cannot imagine anyone else playing it. That's the case here. Peter Falk isn't just playing Columbo--he IS Columbo. And even though it's very amusing to watch each new challenger plot the so-called perfect murder (all the while trying to spot what he or she is doing wrong), the show really takes off when the old Peugeot shows up, and the man in the raincoat steps out and lights his cigar.",1360281600,2,930,4.444444444444445

""Columbo"" is a murder mystery television series, starring Peter Falk (1927 to 2011) as Lieutenant Columbo, a homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department.

This series popularized the inverted detective story format or ""HowdHeCatchem"" format where in almost every episode began by showing the commission of a murder by a killer.  There is no ""WhoDunIt"" element.

The plot mainly revolves around the killer or killers, whose identity is already known to the audience, and how he, she, or they will be caught and exposed.

Columbo is a friendly, verbose, dishevelled-looking detective (his trademark attire is a rumpled raincoat over a suit and tie) of Italian decent who is consistently underestimated by his suspects.  He has increasingly irritating, pestering behaviour with those he thinks committed the crime.  Columbo has certain unforgettable catchphrases (one of which titles this review).

The episodes were broadcast from (1968 to 1978) and from (1989 to 2003).  There were 69 (45 + 24) episodes in total.

This collection contains the six episodes that were televised in the years (1991 to 1993).  They are presented in chronological sequence. The titles of these episodes and my brief impression of them are given below:

(1) Caution! Murder can be hazardous to your health:  1 hr, 30 min;  Guest star: George Hamilton;  Filmed in 1991; Excellent
(2) Columbo and the murder of a rock star:  1 hr, 35 min;  Guest stars: Dabney Coleman with a cameo by Little Richard;  Filmed in 1991;  Excellent

(3) Death hits the jackpot:  1 hr, 36 min;  Guest stars: Rip Torn and a chimp;  Filmed in 1991;  Excellent
(4) No time to die:  1 hr, 31 min;  Filmed in 1992;  Bad.  I think the writers forgot they were writing a ""Columbo"" episode

(5) A bird in the hand:  1 hr, 33 min;  Filmed in 1992;  Guest stars: Tyne Daly, Greg Evigan;  Good
(6) It's all in the game:  1 hr, 35 min;  Filmed in 1993;  Guest star: Faye Dunaway;  This episode was written by Peter Falk;  Excellent

In each episode, the screen goes black for a second or two between scenes.

Finally, there are no extras with this collection (that was released in 2011).

In conclusion, this collection gives you a chance to see the legendary Peter Falk play the equally legendary trench coat-wearing Lieutenant Columbo.  Oh!  ""Just one more thing.""  (I'm kidding! This is another Columbo catchphrase.)

6152777,5,B00HA0FOEU,"""Just one more thing..!"" Columbo's style of questioning, his apparent ingenuity, and his brilliant ability to decipher the most enigmatic cases made him a favorite of the audience. So it was comforting to see Peter Falk return to television in the late 80's and early 90's to reprise his role in these mistery movies and is refreshing to watch them again in the 21st century, in DVD.

It is always amazing how Columbo is able to solve a murder case by paying attention to the ""small things"" most people tend to overlook.  Although it seems like Columbo is just being a pest and acts like he is not too swift, he is nonetheless professional and vigilant in figuring out the party that commited the crime.  All of the episodes are entertaining with a flavor of humor sprinkled in occasionally.  When you want to have a relaxing evening at home with a good movie, these Movie Mysteries of the Week, as they were once called, will be time well spent.",1303689600,,728,4.484848484848484

6152804,5,B00HA0FOEU,"Getting straight to the point, ""No Time to Die"" is the lesser installment in this six-episode compilation.  ""Columbo"" rarely strayed from its formula.  In most episodes during Act I, the murder and the murderer is revealed.  For the rest of the show, it becomes a cat-and-mouse game between the detective and the culprit as the show reaches a satisfying conclusion, usually with Columbo solving the crime in a most unorthodox manner.

""No Time to Die"" doesn't follow the pattern, with a kidnapping as the central focus of the plot.  While this is different, the installment is rather slow-moving, with several questions left unanswered.  However, it's still ""Columbo"" and any time a viewer gets to see Falk in his trademark role, it's worth a look.

With that said, the remaining episodes feature great performances from guests Emmy-winner-for-the-show Faye Dunaway, Tyne Daly (deserving of one), Greg Evigan, Steve Forrest, George Hamilton (second time as a murderer), Dabney Coleman, and a deliciously-evil Rip Torn.

The one with Daly, Evigan, and Forrest, by the way, features more than the usual single death, making it a landmark one in the long-running series' history.

No extras on the disc but each episode is presented in widescreen format, something that no previous compilation had.",1300579200,50,1295,5.217391304347826

Bad acting all around. ""It's All In The Game"" a Mother and Daughter plan to murder their gigolo boyfriend who's been playing both sides! Faye Dunaway's acting killed this movie when she tried acting sexy. Columbo was playing a game of his own! Just One More Thing!!!!!!!!!!Gotcha!",1300492800,7,477,5.050632911392405
6152806,4,B00HA0FOEU,I have been waiting for this DVD set for some time. I have all the other Columbo DVD's. In a quick summary I can say this set is excellent - you won't be disappointed. Normally when a series gets this old it it can 'run out of steam'. The writting gets stale and the acting can be plodding. This is not the case here - in fact I enjoyed this set even more than some of the previous DVD's. The stories seemed 'fresh' and entertaining. Hopefully there is one more set to come.

6152812,5,B00HA0FOEU,"In this boxset, we can see Columbo being a master detective. In my personal view, killers in these episodes seem not as ""educated"" as 1990 boxset, instead they seem to get back to 70s tricks depending on newer technology. George Hamilton's character makes the same & old mistake, the broken watch trick, and the poisining through a bottle cork as you can see.

In my personal opinion, as most ""Columbo Mania"" would agree, the cork poisoning trick done by the famous attorney is way too stupid compared to the same trick done by a food critique back in 70s and you know who. Why didn't he abondon poisoning cork and bottle somewhere else?

All through these episodes, Columbo seems moving and acting quicker than before though he's getting older. We can estimate that must be based on his accumulated experience, which include all of his ""tying up loose ends"", ""report to my boss"", etc along with his signature dogged persistence and observation done by his own old style. All of these make new technology and gimicks no match at all to him.

""No Time to Die"" is the very first episode that we are not told the criminal in the beginning instead Columbo and we chase who the criminal is. Also for the first time for us, we can see when Columbo really leads his fellow LAPDs and what he does in the headquater.

Only one my personal disappointment in these episodes is that I don't see Columbo eating chili!! Yet, I amm compromised because he still cracks hardboiled eggs and also he invented peanuts butter & raisin sandwiches!!

So it seems like really ""just one more thing"" in terms of DVD release. I will be one of many many many ""Columbo mania"" who will order it when released.",1298419200,11,1679,4.60200668896321
