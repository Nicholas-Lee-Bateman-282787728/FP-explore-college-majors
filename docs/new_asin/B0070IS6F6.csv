8507790,5,B0070IS6F6,"Huston Smith, I find, is always worth listening to. He is articulate, and his words broaden the understanding of why we here, what we need to do. On this CD the interviewer Ken Dychtwald, a scholar in the field of aging, explores aging and death with Smith. I'd recommend this highly.",1423008000,2,284,4.588235294117647
8507791,5,B0070IS6F6,"I have followed his writings and various interviews over the years.  He is a very articulate and interesting person who has literally lived several religions and has many respectful insights to share.  If you are not familiar with him, try the Bill Moyer series first.

It is touching to see how he has aged, but hopeful on how he has approached the frailty that comes with the aging process.",1391212800,2,392,4.6521739130434785
8507792,5,B0070IS6F6,"I look at this, and appreciate this great mans life and phgilosophy.  If anyone has the slightest spiritual light in their consciousness - this DVD is confirming and enlightening.  His wisdom - and life long pursuit of understanding ""religion"" and spelling it out for all is in a class all its own.  Here he speaks of advanced age - and puts life into perspective.  Wonderful/",1386806400,2,376,4.7384615384615385
