In comparison to the other films that proceeded it, I don't think I like the idea that she was in a police officer's role, but at the same time, she pulled it off well and it seemed to work.  The film also allowed the character (Angel) to finally demonstrate that she was capable of feeling (or sustaining) an emotional relationship with someone.  Thanks.",1425513600,,407,4.534246575342466

First off, the cover is a come-on. Just look at it and you want to watch the tape, right? Well, this nubile chick is NOT a ""high school student by day, hooker by night"". In fact, this one never even unhooks her brassiere in the film! Give this one a pass, make that a school pass.",1395705600,2,438,4.289156626506024
