8462746,3,B00596762A,"This DVD from 1962 is important, mainly for it's historical value to classical music lovers. Both Knappertsbusch and Backhaus have somewhat mixed reputations, and for Knappertsbusch and Backhaus this video dates from the later years of their careers. Knappertsbusch sits, while conducting, for example, and does not display the energy that some other videos indicate. His tempo, especially the Beethoven, seems almost painfully slow when compared with some other conductor's performances of the same work. Backhaus, a prodigy in his youth, had questionable relations with the infamous German government of 1933-45 and was reportedly personally invited by Hitler, to one or more of the Nurnberg rallies. Both Knappertsbusch and Backhaus died not so many years after this performance was recorded, Knappertsbusch in 1965 and Backhaus in 1969. Birgit Nilsson, here in the earlier years of her notable career, displays a reserve, almost stiffness, that is not so obvious in later appearances. Maybe, Knappertsbusch is responsible for that reserve in this performance or possibly she was intimidated by the credentials of her co-performers. Although in her later years she was anything, but, intimidated by anyone, with her being the dominant personality in such performances. However, even though the audio is sub par, her potential is evident. Further, the black and white of this somewhat aged video does not enhance the performances to the degree that later color videos would have done.",1366243200,2,1486,5.465217391304348
