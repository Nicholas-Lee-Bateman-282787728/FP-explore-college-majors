1122013,3,7883681753,"Jackie Chan's `The Myth' is based on an ambitious idea - maybe too ambitious. Jackie plays two characters: Jack, Indiana Jones-like archeologist living in modern day China, and General Meng-yi, a loyal warrior of Qin Dynasty that existed in China more than 2,200 years ago. Now, while seeking for the artifacts of ancient China with a help of his buddy William (Tony Leung Ka Fai), Jack is annoyed by a strange dream he frequently sees, a dream of General Meng-yi, faithfully protecting a Korean princess Ok-soo (Hee-seon Kim).

[JACKIE'S WUSHA] So `The Myth' can be divided into two segments. One is the part about more traditional actions Jackie's fans have been watching (such as `Operation Condor') where Jackie's character gets involved in conspiracy or something. The other part would be a more unique and different experience for fans because this is his first attempt at the now trendy `wusha' genre, Chinese historical play where characters show superhuman skills at sword fight or martial arts, as seen in `House of Flying Daggers' or `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'

The results are a mixed bag. Up to the point where Indian princess played by sexy Mallika Sherawat appears, the film is pretty fast-moving, and the actions are largely good. The highlight is the comic action sequences in which Jackie Chan and Mallika Sherawat are both trapped on the rat paper (yes, I'm not kidding), and this is simply Jackie at his best, always surprising and funny with his ingenious use of props. And again I say Mallika Sherawat sexy, whose brief appearance here is almost stealing the show from the star.

But after that, the film slowly goes downhill, with the familiar plot about international conspiracy and big company, which are just boring. Tony Leung Ka Fai is given a thankless role, who doesn't have much to do, and the climax action scenes are done in the weightless subterranean palace, where the hero and baddies fight each other in a very strange way. The novel idea of non-gravity battle is silly and unexciting, and the obvious use of green screen does not help.

As to the wusha part of the film, though it is true that Jackie does his best, handling more serious theme than usual such as love and honor (and clearly more than enough money is spent), the ancient China part does not go together well with the modern part of which light-heartedness is gradually weighed down by the other part's seriousness. Maybe I have seen too many of Jackie's films in the past, where his actions are closely associated with comedy touch.

So, see this film as two films in one. Both are OK in their own ways, but to many fans these two halves do not necessarily add up to one.",1168560000,,2682,4.796536796536796
1122014,3,7883681753,"The Myth initially feels like Jackie Chan is reinventing his Armour of God movies just as he recently reinvented the Police Story series, with a slightly darker tone. The film's two plot strands aren't always as complimentary as they could be, with the historical backstory of Chan's general falling in love with the Emperor's latest concubine far more interesting than the modern-day adventurer Chan's efforts to uncover their secret. It's not always successful, not least because of some poorly timed CGI, but it does offer an enjoyable fight on a glue factory assembly line that plays out like a demented version of twister and a spectacular battle scene (Stanley Tong is clearly a fan of Anthony Mann, copying several set-ups from The Fall of the Roman Empire) en route to the finale. And the last half hour is impressive stuff, be it a surprisingly bloody (for Chan) one-against-all battle that sees him fighting atop a mountain of corpses or the scenes in a giant weightless mausoleum that make imaginative use of superior wire work and which do carry a sense of wonder to them.

Surprisingly, the extras on this Asian 2-disc set are all subtitled in English, including the audio commentary. Also included are two deleted scenes (though not the uncompleted tiger chase sequence), a 15-minute making of, several on-set featurettes, music video and a selection of trailers and TV spots.",1145318400,6,1390,5.017316017316017

7900106,4,7883681753,"I give this Blu-ray version released in the U.K. by Showbox four stars because it falls a bit short of being the ""ultimate edition"" that they claim it to be. I also think it is one of Jackie's best movies.

First, an important fact: Although this Blu-ray disk is Region 2, it is actually region-free and the movie will play on U.S. Blu-ray players, no problem. However, that is not true of the four hours of extras, which are in 480p PAL format and will not play on U.S. machines (with the tiny exception of the theatrical trailer and 2 deleted scenes).

Now, what makes this version ""ultimate"" (or close to it)?  Two important things: (1) This is the original uncut version, 121 minutes, whereas the U.S.-released DVD by Sony is a staggering 25 minutes shorter! (2) This offers a choice of either the original Cantonese or an English dubbed sound track, either one in 5.1 Dolby Digital sound.  Most reviewers say they prefer the original sound track, but I prefer the English dub so I can keep my eye on the whole screen instead of having to look at subtitles (and this is an especially beautiful movie to look at).  But this disk gives you the choice, whatever your preference.

So what makes it less than ""ultimate""?  Two things:  (1) The cut Sony DVD version uses Jackie's own voice for the English dubbed sound track, but this ""ultimate"" version sadly does not!  That is a considerable shortcoming, but there is no uncut version available that uses Jackie's own voice in English.  (2) The lack of a lossless HD sound track.  There is a Chinese-only version that has that, and the Taiwan Blu-ray release by Pony reportedly has both Chinese and English audio tracks in HD but I cannot confirm that (it is also the uncut version of the movie and reportedly region free as well).

As to the movie itself, I am a big Jackie Chan fan and I consider this to be one of the six best of his movies. The picture quality of the Blu-ray is very good but not quite reference quality. The movie is really beautiful to watch with outstanding cinematography and exotic beautiful scenery not seen before on film (not to mention the exotic beauty of Indian actress Mallika Sherawat). There are quintessential Jackie action stunts, and the rat glue factory scene is hilarious vintage Jackie at his best.

I have watched this movie several times and it was a real treat to see the higher quality that this Blu-ray version brings to it.",1350604800,7,2419,4.597674418604651
7900107,3,7883681753,"The movie has an excellent story line, but there are some disconnects like the Jack's relationship with Mallika Sherawat.  Also, the bad guy is ""injected"" into the story halfway through, without any prior mention.

The ending is weak -- the biggest disappointment.",1336780800,,264,5.261904761904762
7900108,5,7883681753,"I enjoyed the US DVD of The Myth so I went for the whole enchilada and got the Avant-Garde Lim. Coll. Ed. Box and it's an cool package, With a folding stage to display the character cards and an actual packaged cube of ""clay"" that contains an ""temple idol"" from the movie. The DVD has a much better picture than the US disk (which looked fantastic) and the sound is a full DTS bitrate ( rare)  which sounds incredible. Plus the full 2 hr version moves smoother and faster (sorry Jackie, the US mix is OK/not!). And to top this off are two supplemental discs which are not bad and offer a continual replay setting for the music videos. A true collectors item of a huge, big budget film that plays like ""Raiders of the Lost KurosawaBondfinger with a Timeshifting Jackie Chan."" I mean this film is crazy confection with the kitchen sink doing a fly by; but I find it a satisfying epic with Jackies' light ""feelgood"" attitude in it. If you don't get this one at least try the US release which is still a hoot.",1212710400,3,1005,4.345744680851064
