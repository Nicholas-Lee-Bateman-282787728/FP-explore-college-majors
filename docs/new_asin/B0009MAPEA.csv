8063130,2,B0009MAPEA,Does not contain ALL of what I had expected from the Jib Jab Site,1480204800,,65,3.7142857142857144
8063131,4,B0009MAPEA,"When this DVD was first released, the subtitle seemed a little strange, ""The Early Years"".  How could a company that wasn't even a decade old be releasing material about the early years?  Then things started to make sense after the organization went corporate by signing a production agreement with Budwiser and then selling out even further by becoming another video dumping site for hopeful filmmakers.  Before the sellout, JibJab used to be a small little website that made hilarious and sometimes crude little animated films that mainly parodied politics, but sometimes poked fun at old age and Christmas.  This collection brings together almost all of the site's original material.  Some of the notable shorts include:

""This Land""-- a short that parodies the 2004 U.S. Presidential election

""Good to Be in DC""--a cartoon about George W. Bush first arriving in Washington

""Second Term""--the animated antics of George W. Bush after winning the 2004 election

""Santa Claus""--a musical number illustrating how Santa probably really feels

""Ahnuld for Governor""--video supporting the Terminator's first gubernatorial attempt

""Cooking With Clinton""--a cooking show with former President Bill Clinton.

For those who were familiar with JibJab back in their heyday, this is a nice item to own and remember how things used to be.  Also, for anyone who may have seen one of the political shorts during the campaign seasons when they first were shown then this DVD is a nice historical memento.",1156809600,,1492,5.271186440677966
8063132,5,B0009MAPEA,"This is a lot better than downloading and watching one at a time.  I love their political parodies.  Their snippets are at par with Jon Stewart's ""The Daily Show"".",1152835200,,163,4.586206896551724
8063133,5,B0009MAPEA,"Obviously the people who posted those one star revues are wrong.  JibJab.com is one of the greatest sites ever, and I highly recomend this DVD.  It's like Jib Jab.com without waiting to see the shows.",1130630400,2,200,4.685714285714286
8063134,5,B0009MAPEA,"What a nifty selection here. I love Jibjab's cartoons and this DVD has a handy selection of them:

""The Farting Elves"" is great if you love fart jokes.

The ""Rumple"", ""Cooking with Clinton"" ""Ahnuld for Governer"", and the Bush-vs.-Gore cartoons are a real hoot.

Buy this while you can, and don't believe those 1-star reviewers.",1118966400,8,327,4.909090909090909
