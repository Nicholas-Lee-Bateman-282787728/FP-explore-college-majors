1802518,5,B0000797E5,"I've been watching (and taping) this show religiously on BBC America, and I'm excited it's finally being made available to us Yanks on Region 1 DVDs.
simply put, Coupling has some of the best comedic writing you will ever see.  it's quick-witted and brilliantly set up and staged.  it's got some of the funniest and most unforgettable characters, especially Jeff, played by Robert Coyle.  Jeff's rants and weird theories about sex and relationships alone are worth the price of the DVD.
I'm very nervous about the idea of an American version of Coupling.  it seems set up to fail if they're going to use it to replace friends.  make no mistake, this show has some superficial similarities to Friends, as others have pointed out, but comparing Coupling to friends is like comparing filet mignon to a Whopper.",1037664000,4,807,4.861313868613139
1802519,5,B0000797E5,"My brother talked me into watching Coupling, and now I feel like I can't miss an episode!  This is one of the funniest shows I have ever watched.
The characters are all wonderfully cast, and the actors' comedic timing is excellent.  Richard Coyle as Jeff is especially brilliant in my favorite espisode ""The Girl with Two Breasts.""
Once you watch Coupling, you will be glad to be caught in the Giggle Loop!",1036627200,,406,4.625
1802520,5,B0000797E5,"Coupling is the best show besides Red Dwarf to come out of England! I loved watching the show and laughed every second of it. If you've never watcxhed the show before think of it as Friends, except they have English accents and talk about sex all the time. My favorite character is Jeff(poor thing can never talk to a girl without blurting out some part of the female anatomy!). I guaranty that if you buy this first season you will laugh through the whole thing.",1036281600,3,463,4.458823529411765
1802521,5,B0000797E5,"Coupling is simply brilliant. It's funny, extremely original and takes the humorous side of relationships to a new and very clever level. It shows the best and worst of the quirks of men and women who are dating in a very funny light without being judgmental or negative. It is the sort of show that is a little hard to explain and that really needs to be watched but I promise you that you won't be disappointed!",1036281600,,413,4.376623376623376
1802522,4,B0000797E5,"When they get around to posting an editorial review here, inevitably the comparisons between Coupling and Friends will fly.  Don't pay attention.  Yes there are superficial similarities -- 6 attractive singles evenly divided between men and women, etc. -- but this is comedy in the great British tradition of farce and has much more in common with Fawlty Towers or Blackadder than with any American sitcom.  I'll admit that the incessant need to label the unlabelable (word?) owes a debt to Seinfeld, though.
Episodes included on this first season set are:
""Flushed"" -- Steve (the beset Jack Davenport) tries, mostly unsuccessfully, to break up with Jane (the mad Gina Bellman), while beginning a relationship with Susan (the radiant Sarah Alexander).
""Size Matters"" -- Steve and Susan's relationship reaches a new level.  Sally (the moisturized Kate Isitt) is horrified by Patrick's (the swaggering Ben Miles) political beliefs.
""Sex, Death and Nudity"" -- Everyone ends up at Jane's aunt's funeral.  Jeff (the crazed Richard Coyle) has his job interview strategy boomerang on him.
""Inferno"" -- Susan discovers Steve's video collection.  A dinner party goes awry.
""The Girl with Two Breasts"" -- Jeff tries to connect with a girl who doesn't speak English.
""The Cupboard of Patrick's Love"" -- Susan discovers that her ex (Patrick) has videotape of her in a compromised position.
There is a second season of nine episodes currently in rotation on BBCAmerica for you digital cable subscribers.  And a third season has just begun airing in England.
Also, word is that an Americanized version of this show is being groomed as a replacement for ... aw, you guessed it.  The soon-to-end Friends.  See where it all began here.
And see where it (probably) was a whole lot funnier.  Unfair pre-judgment.  But probably true.",1036195200,79,1813,5.13265306122449
1802523,5,B0000797E5,"Hilarious, intelligent comedy that you can watch over and over.  Six great characters make this a comedy classic with these six episodes of Season 1.
I was a bit skeptical before watching the show for the first time on our local PBS station, but rushed to send in my annual pledge renewal afterwards.  NBC has enlisted the aid of the show's creators to create a version for American TV; if it can be half as good as the original, it'll be a huge success.  Hopefully the DVD for Season 2 will be coming out soon.
The action centers around six characters, 3 guys and 3 girls:  Richard Coyle's Jeff character, who manages to steal much of the show with unforgettable dialogue; Jeff's ""porn buddy"" nice-guy Steve; the man's man Patrick; Sarah Alexander's Susan, who is an uninhibited hottie; her best-friend Sally; and the nearly insane Jane.
A must-have addition to anyone's DVD comedy collection.",1035763200,7,894,4.785714285714286
1802524,5,B0000797E5,"All but the last season are great.  Watch and learn what the giggle loop, captain subtext, and the melty man is.  This is a million times better then the failed US clone.",1506729600,,170,4.28125
1802525,5,B0000797E5,"There are four seasons of this show and I've watched all Four!  I'm in the USA but I happen to love British humor. This series is sort of like the UK version of friends. I found it hilarious and I was looking to watch it again. But nobody streams it. So, I had to buy all four DVDs.
If you're a fan of Brit comedy, and you like relationship hilarity,  I think you're going to like all four seasons of these. I'm going to put this exact same review on the other three seasons so don't expect anything new there. Sorry about that. :-)",1499212800,,532,4.105769230769231

1802619,5,B0000797E5,Somewhat sexist but the Brits are pretty innovative with comedy. It's worth it just for the character Jeff. FYI - the actor who played Jeff left at the end of Season 3. Season 4 isn't nearly as worth watching.,1408320000,,209,4.384615384615385

1802621,5,B0000797E5,"One of the funniest BBC shows ever, the US version bombed when they tried to Americanize and sanitize the humor bit.  This is adult oriented LOL funny stuff, but may be a bit risqu for the more puritanical viewers (lots of overt sexual references - no nudity).  Everybody I watch it with's favorite character is Jeff.

The situations showcase the funny, awkward, and often neurotic personalities of the group of friends as they become romantically involved. The beautiful and talented Gina Bellman (Leverage) plays the wacky ""Jane"" to the delight of everyone.  British actress, Kate Isitt is fascinating as Sally.  Ben Miles, Jack Davenport, Sarah Alexander and Richard Coyle round out the half dozen brilliant cast members. I've enjoyed every episode and own all four seasons.

1802638,5,B0000797E5,I watched some of this series on BBC America when it first aired an found it funny and kind of cutting edge for the time. Seeing it now reminds me of some of the Seinfeld episodes but it is still as relevant as it was back then. Good ensemble cast along with the British Humor results in an enjoyable half hour of TV viewing. As a side not they tried to copy this show in the U.S. even using the same name but it never took off. I watched one or two episodes of that experiment and blame the failure on the casting. The interaction of these characters is more along the lines of Friends.,1403654400,,587,4.113043478260869

Overall it is great fun to watch this series.",1402099200,,380,4.434782608695652
1802647,5,B0000797E5,"Despite the 14 years since it was released in the UK, this series retains it's edgy and hilarious tone.  While it's still risque by American television standards, it's really not that racy.  The actors are all fun to watch and listen to, and each has created a pretty fleshed-out character.  The writing is clever and the story lines are suitably complicated.  I really like the show (in case you couldn't tell).",1402012800,,412,4.76056338028169

I referred to them as ""interesting"" because (as someone clearly beyond the ages of the characters depicted in the show), I qualify, I guess, as somewhat of a voyeur -- one who appreciates the wit and comedy of some scenarios, as well as the stylishness and fashion of some of the women in the show, while also wondering if younger folk really ARE this outspoken, extraverted, and active in their dating and sexual lives. I imagine that other viewers (say, late 20's to mid/late 30's, especially those who are still single and dating) would find the show more relevant than I did.",1401321600,,677,4.794871794871795

1802684,5,B0000797E5,"What's thought but usually left unsaid and unacted upon -- or not openly acknowledged if acted upon -- is put front and center and on the surface as this series shreds our society's conventions of embarrassed silence where sexuality is concerned, and the results are hilarious.  However, there was a bit of a falling off in the last two episodes of Series 1, a sense of a lack of freshness, I think because what is initially surprising and funny can become stale and seem somewhat juvenile after too many repetitions.  The Series nevertheless deserves Five Stars.  It will be interesting to see if the writers etc. were able to keep this show fresh over the following three Series, and if so how long.",1392422400,,701,4.682926829268292

1802703,5,B0000797E5,"I don't give a lot of 5 stars, especially to a sitcom.  However, ""Coupling"" just had that effect on me.  The humor is sometimes subtle, but, usually, it is in your face.  You have to laugh, although there may be a few times when you look around you first. :-)
I was hooked after 1 episode.  There are about 30 altogether and of those about 4 had me almost off the chair on the floor.  The background plots are decent and the humor, well British, sexy, and about some things that we don't talk about as freely over here (at least, not that I know of in groups).  The characters are done well and thorough.  The main six you get to know very well by the end of Season 1.

1802816,5,B0000797E5,"I am an American: used to American sitcoms that hold back on the sexual innuendos, that make light of twentysomethings and thirtysomethings having sex, and try to turn adult comedy into family friendly comedy to fit a certain timeslot.

I must also state that I am an avid Jack Davenport fan. (And, if you are, please do not miss this show)

I was immediately amazed at the bluntness and raunchiness of this show. Nothing is alluded to or glazed over. The sex jokes are sex jokes; the sex situations are sex situations, and get this, all the adults act like adults. It was funny to me that someone ewould compare this to Friends.

I think that the show does everything that Friends didn't: make single adult life in the city soemthing people can relate to. I cant say enough hjow un watered down this show really is.

The only gripe I have is the acting. At times i's a little blotchy, and a little campy. But, with the comedic situations (like the ""giggaloop"", or the ""lesbian spanking inferno"") you forgive the actors for their shortcomings!

The series, which I have only watched the First Season, is a delight. It's a fresh break from the ho-hum dryness of American sitcoms, and it has sparked my interest into more British sitcoms.

Echoing many of the reviews already written, this is a witty, fresh, entertaining show that sitcoms lovers can really get into bed with"" (pun intended)",1207180800,,1389,4.672131147540983

In this first season, there are only 6 episodes.....but what a bunch of episodes they are! We are introduced to Steve, Jane, Susan, Sally, Jeff and Patrick as well as their stomping grounds, flats, and workplaces. We get to hear about Jeffs ""rules"" and quirky life lessons like the ""giggle loop"" the ""sock gap"" and and the ""zone"" Jeff is really my favorite character, he is ""that guy"" you know that is always single, has a saying for everything, and you must have him around for laughs because he is too zany to be left alone!

Coupling is hilarious, but its also really sweet. Its not only about sex and relationships its about friendship and how men and women can be completely different yet the same on some levels. I know people compare this to ""Friends"" but its nothing like it to me, other than it has men and women in it. Coupling goes way beyond where Friends could ever go, because its not censored by uptight americans.

1802826,5,B0000797E5,"I love this show. While several reviewers have mentioned the obvious parallels between Coupling and the American show Friends, Coupling is in my opinion much better.

First of all, Coupling does not (largely) try to be as soapopera-ish (I really can't thing of another term) as Friends. At least in the first two seasons the jokes are the focus and consist primarily of one or two liners. The plots, such as they are, are kept simple and minimalist - basically serving as a platform for the humor, not the other way around.

And the shows, while not for the prudish, are very funny. The episode, Inferno in particular is great fun. While the series revolves around Susan and Steve's relationship and as such they get the lion's share of attention, the funniest character is clearly Jeff. His ruminations on life (and hints of a clearly disturbed childhood) are some of the funniest things you will ever hear on TV. The Giggle Loop and the Melty Man are just classic.",1161129600,,966,4.710059171597633

1802829,5,B0000797E5,"Just some of the incredibly outrageous topics covered by arguably the funniest comedy in TV history (UK or US). Late one night back around 2002, I found this on a PBS station and couldn't recall laughing out loud like that in years. The side splitting antics of these 6 friends should be seen by anyone with a taste for humor, and an acceptance of risque subjects. Sex is definitely a major topic, as it is certainly a major part of the lives of twentysomethings living in London.

We start the series with Steve breaking it off with Jane, only to hook up with Susan, which becomes a mainstay through the series. Patrick, Sally, and Jeff make up the rest of the sextet, with Richard Coyle as Jeff, being one of the all time great scene stealers in a comedic television show. His replacement in Series 4, while not a bad character or actor, simply cannot replace the talent that Coyle brought to the show. Enjoy him while you can, as he's only in it 'til season 3.

Many of the plots involve misunderstandings, revelations, futile attempts at dating (mostly by Jeff), and hilarious conversations that take place when it's just the guys, or just the 3 girls together. It's an ingenious show, expertly created and written by the talented Steven Moffat, who is also responsible for some of the new Dr. Who stories on the BBC, and was a writer for the popular 80's British series Press Gang.

You can compare it all you want to Friends, Seinfeld, and the like, but as it's own show, the storylines, dialogue, and interactions, among these 6 friends are truly unique, and incomparable to anything else on television.

British humor (or any humor) at it's finest.  I've guaranteed all my friends and anyone else who will listen, that if they buy it and don't find it to be one of the funniest shows they've ever seen, that I would buy it back from them.  No one has sold me their copy yet!  If you want to get someone a comedy DVD set for Xmas, I can't think of a better gift!",1134864000,5,1969,4.483240223463687

1802831,5,B0000797E5,"NBC tried to `Americanize' this series and made an American version with an all American cast, resulting in total failure. Creator Steven Moffat has not enough credit on doing this as he basically took original episodes from the British show and `cloned' them with the American cast (i.e. `Dressed' from season 2)

The first season of `Coupling' is definitely one of the best seasons of this show.  People dared to compare this show with `Friends', well, the only thing in common is the fact that we have 6 people that know each other. This is a show as you have never seen one. The characters, their motifs and the situation are unbelievable funny. The way in which the stories are told is quite creative and well done; take for instance my personal favorite episode `The girl with two breasts' in which we get to see the same situation from both different perspectives with a twist so intelligently made that you won't believe it.

Besides being the introduction for all the characters, the first season sets the events that will lead to the major changes to be seen on the next seasons. The show basically analyzes relationships and their ups and downs, situations that you may be familiar with (the nervousism on the first date, an ex-girlfriend asking you to go somewhere with her and asking you not to tell you are apart) and of course, sex. `Size matters' is about a guy feeling insecure about his size as he is competing with a `gifted' ex-boyfriend, `Sex, death and nudity' has the best gig of the season with the `giggle loop' (it made me cry of laughing) and the homage to reservoir dogs, `Inferno' has a serious discussion about porn films being works of art and `The cupboard of Patrick's love' introduces you to Casanova Patrick's video perversions.

Witty, smart and with intelligent twists, this show will make you laugh over the six episodes of the first season. Scary Jeff became my favorite character with all the extravagant ideas about sex, his perversions and his obsession with his mom, Richard Coyle is just unbelievable as Jeff. This show takes the intelligent British humor to a whole new level. Highly recommendable, and season 2, gets better!

The DVD extras are a few, some behind the scenes are included and images from the photo shot for the cover of the DVD are present as well. No subtitle options are available so you will have to rely on the `closed caption' option from the TV set. The digital transfer is fair enough and it is definitely better to have these than the awful American versions.",1121472000,5,2529,4.72562358276644
1802832,5,B0000797E5,"Coupling was originally conceived as a British version of Friends but it turned out so much better.  The first season is made up of six episodes.  The first episode introduces the main characters and the remaining episodes fill in the interactions, personalities, insecurities and outright insanity of the characters.

The premise is pretty simple.  Jack is trying to break up with his girlfriend Jane when he meets Susan.  As the first episode ends, Susan sums it all up by saying that the six of them are a couple, their two best friends and their two ex's.  These relationships are maintained pretty well throughout the current seasons.

The storytelling is often very cleverly done by using flashbacks and multiple viewpoints.  The characters are lovable and astounding and Steve's rants about the nature of being a bloke are absolutely classic.  In this first season you will learn such secrets as unflushables, the sock gap, the giggle loop, naked bottoms and civilization, breasts with brains, and the video cupboard.  So pop in a disk and join the lives of six of the funniest people in London.",1120608000,,1102,4.972677595628415

1802834,5,B0000797E5,"I got into the show Coupling a couple of years ago when I visited my boyfriend in his native land (Britain) and was hooked immediately. From thereon in I didn't miss an episode of the show on BBC America. The only problem was that I hadn't been able to catch the first season reruns. Coupling -- The Complete First Season is a clear indication as to why I became a big fan of this hilarious and clever Brit-com. The show is about six thirty-something single Londoners and their relationship plights. Well, there's a lot more to it than that. The clever one-liners, the hilarious situations and the smart and witty quips among the six friends make this show a comic marble. The three girls -- Susan (the sexy one), Sally (the anal retentive one) and Jane (the eccentric, manipulative one) -- are great and sort of remind me of Rachel, Monica and Phoebe (sorry, but I am sure that most of you saw that one coming). And the guys -- Steve (the more romantic one), Patrick (the commitmentphobic one) and Jeff (the hilarious, somewhat perverted one) -- take it one step further in comedy and bonding than the guys on Friends. Jeff is my favorite character. I love his quirky lines and immature behavior. My favorite episodes are ""Flushed,"" ""Size Matters,"" ""Sex, Death and Nudity,"" and ""The Girl with Two Breasts."" (The latter episode is the funniest one.) I got to see how Steve broke up with Jane and how he met Susan. And in that breakup and get-together, all six of them meet each other and become friends. I was not disappointed. The execution was great, especially during the first scenes of the episode ""Flushed."" In the hopes of saving both time and word space, I won't give a complete episode guide. I see that some reviewers have already done it. I just wanted to share my enthusiasm and utter satisfaction with the show's first season. Also, the DVD is quite good. It is far user-friendlier than the Sex and the City DVD in that each episode has a menu with scene choices -- something that SATC DVDs don't have for some reason. Anyway, if you're in the bargain for a clever and modern British comedy then I suggest you give the first season of Coupling a whirl.",1098230400,4,2165,4.5681233933161955

Besides, with all the attempts to duplicate the success of ""Friends"" on this side of the Pond it is nice to see that somebody pulled it off.  So just take it for granted that you will watch the first couple of episodes from the first series (what we in the Colonies would call a season) you will be figuring out which character on ""Coupling"" matches up with which character on ""Friends.""  But that is pretty obvious:

Steve Taylor (Jack Davenport) is Ross, without the Ph. D. in paleontology, who has just started dating Susan Walker (Sarah Alexander), who certainly is more confident about living in the real world than Rachel.  Jane Christie (Gina Bellman) is decidedly quirky like Phoebe, but without the loveable cuteness, and Sally Harper (Kate Isitt) is psychotic about her appearance the way Monica is about cleanliness.  Jeff Murdock (Richard Coyle) thinks about sex as much as Joey without any of the success with women, which makes it odd that Patrick Maitland (Ben Miles) ends up being the Chandler figure since he is apparently a sex god (or sex ""donkey"").  When you get to the point knowing that Patrick is Susan's ""ex"" and it becomes impossible to translate that into Chandler being Rachel's ""ex,"" then you are capable of watching this situation comedy on its own terms.

Now, the biggest difference between ""Coupling"" and ""Friends"" is the preoccupation with sex.  ""Coupling"" only had six episodes in its first series and I was wondering if you took the first season of ""Friends"" and selectively cut it down to only six episodes would it be as much about sex?  I have to say that the answer is probably not, even if you culled the choice moments from the first two or three season of 'Friends.""  Even when a subplot is about a job interview or a funeral, it still ends up about being sex.  To be honest, ""Sex in the City"" is not as much about sex as ""Coupling,"" which, you have to admit, has a more specific title in that regard.

The six episodes from the first series are as follows: ""Flushed"" has Steve trying to break up with Jane, once again, and having problems because not only does Jane refuse to hear what he is saying, she reveals another side of herself that catches Steve's attention.  Then there is one of the most unusual circumstances for arranging for a date you have ever seen as Steve and Susan hook up.  ""Size Matters"" has Sally seeing Patrick in a new way, or, to be more accurate, hoping to see Patrick in a new way.  ""Sex, Death and Nudity"" has the gang showing up en masse at the funeral of Jane's aunt, although exactly who is with whom and what their relationship is for public consumption is not clear.  Bonus: The boys do their ""Reservoir Dogs"" bit.  ""Inferno"" is about the elephant in the living room at Steve and Susan's dinner party, namely the porn tape that Susan discovered in Steve's magazine.  Fortunately, Jane has brought her ex-therapist, although everybody assumes the newcomer is gay.  That is okay because she thinks Patrick is gay (because of his new hair style).  ""The Girl with Two Breasts"" has Jeff successfully having a conversation with a beautiful woman who still likes him.  That is probably because she is from Israel and only speaks Hebrew.  The comic highlight of the season is when Jeff has a second conversation with her; we hear it first from his perspective and then again from her perspective.  The first series comes to an end with ""The Cupboard of Patrick's Love,"" where it seems one of his collection of videotapes of his bedroom activities has the name ""Susan"" on it.  You do not need to be told this is not a good thing as far as Steve or Susan are concerned (although Jeff and Sally like the idea of it).

Actually, the first series almost ended on a rather sweet note, but then they went for the gag, which is the whole object of ""Coupling.""  The show only tosses in one tag scene at the end of the credits, for ""Inferno,"" but it is a perfect capper to the episode and the issue of ""converting"" someone.  I am not surprised that the American version of ""Coupling"" failed because when the British talk about sex it tends to be funny, while when Americans talk about sex it tends to come across as smutty.  Talk about two people separated by a common language.  Anyhow, if you can get past the strong similarity with ""Friends"" and stop thinking of the show as a rip-off, you should be able to enjoy this raunchy and ribald little show.",1096416000,2,4547,4.591584158415841

1802837,1,B0000797E5,"Coupling is like Men In Black one and two. Its like seeing the same movie twice except the second is not even have as good as the first. A lot of people praise Coupling as very quirky and offbeat. When watching this show I feel as if I am watching an episode of Friends without the spirit, originality, and without that pinch of perfection. A great show is based on its originality. Coupling is a British rip-off of Friends. Not only have they stolen the premise of Friends: six friends, 3 girls and three guys. They have also stolen the relationships. Does a certain Couple on Coupling (pardon the humour) remind you of the Coupling of Ross and Rachel on Friends. Don't the characters on Coupling remind you of the characters on Friends: A womanizer(rip off of Joey), a nice guy(rip-off of Ross), a very wierd friend(rip-off of Chandler)..... and that goes on. Would Seinfeld be remembered for the great show it was if their was a rip-off of it, or what about rip-offs of classics like I Love Lucy or Cheers. The actors on Coupling feel fake and don't have the same quality the actors on friends do. Please do not call Coupling superior to Friends. If it weren't for Friends Coupling wouldn't be on TV, and the people obviously thought it was good enough to rip off. Instead pick up a season of Friends, call over a couple of people, and let the magic happen on your TV.",1086134400,3,1371,4.488
1802838,5,B0000797E5,"Coupling is without a doubt one of the funniest series from the last few years. Rivaling and actually exceeding the cleverness of other hits in comedy such as Friends.
Coupling, too, is about a group of 6 close friends, and deals with their every day problems and relationships.
In the first series, we are introduced to Steve, who is determined to break up with his girlfriend Jane and discusses this with his best friend Jeff. In their regular pub Steve runs into Susan (a colleague of Jeff), and sets a date with her. All this happens while he is having sex with Jane in the ladies' room.
Susan breaks up with her boyfriend Patrick, and her best friend Sally decides Patrick is fair game. More so after hearing Patrick is well endowed in the nether region section.
After the introduction episode, we get to see how Susan and Steve hook up together, and the crazy adventures the friends roll into. There's Jane's aunt dying, a discussion about Lesbian porn (the spanking kind), Jeff running into a stunner of a woman who doesn't immediately mace him, and Patrick's personal porn pile (starring Patrick).
While each of the actors is equally brilliant, the genius and probably the reason Coupling is such a success is Jeff (Richard Coyle). His absurd experiences in life have caused him to come up with names for situations. You'll laugh your ass off while he explains the ""The Zone"", ""Unflushables"", ""The Sock Gap"" and most brilliantly, ""The Giggle Loop"".
But you're not ready for that ;)
A definite recommendation. And for those who cannot get enough of Coupling, season 2 and 3 have also been brought out on DVD.",1082419200,16,1615,4.750889679715303
1802839,5,B0000797E5,"I've grown up on a steady, if small, dose of British comedy; it's very different from American comedy -- stand-up comedians in America are really funny, but sitcoms rarely are. I routinely browse BBC America in the hope of catching a Monty Python rerun -- and accidentally discovered Coupling on one such occasion. The episode was ""Size matters""; it was, needless to say, hilarious. A few weeks later, I was thrilled to find Coupling listed on a mainstream channel (NBC, I think) -- it turned out to be an Americanized version of the exact same show, right down to the script -- but it was terrible, downright unfunny!
So my wife got us a copy of the first season -- and I absolutely love it! I do think that the show thematically bears a loose resemblance to Friends, but the comparison doesn't go very far. In any case, both the script and the cast are outstanding, the character development seems to be progressing very well; you make instant connections with them -- and the comedic timing of the actors is superb.

1802843,5,B0000797E5,"""Coupling--The Complete First Season"" is a collection of six episodes of this very funny British comedy.  The show follows the experiences of 6 young adults (3 male, 3 female) as they navigate the waters of romance and friendship.  ""Coupling"" struck me as a sort of British blend of ""Friends,"" ""Seinfeld,"" and ""Sex in the City."" But in the end the show has its own very delightful identity.
In ""Coupling"" a very likeable cast does an outstanding job with some very witty scripts.  The subject matter is often quite spicy--pornography, penis size, bisexuality, etc. are all mined for humor.  The six episode arc culminates in ""the Cupboard of Patrick's Love,"" an outrageous story about home-made erotic videotapes that brings the whole ensemble together in a very satisfying and typically hysterical fashion.  The DVD contains some good bonus features, most notably a series of behind-the-scenes interviews with all six cast members, writer Steven Moffat, and producer Sue Vertue.
The strong sexual content of ""Coupling"" never seems gratuitous or tasteless--the topics seem to flow naturally from the characters and their life situations.  The cast members have a wonderful onscreen chemistry, and the scripts are cleverly constructed.  In the end, this show is often screamingly funny and always highly enjoyable.",1074384000,12,1313,5.344660194174757

True, much is based on misunderstandings and embarrassing situations that often arise out of previously mentioned misunderstandings. But the superb acting and witty dialogs are definite highlights.
Jeff and Susan are my favorite characters, if you're interested to know; and after reading reviews here at Amazon I see that I'm not the only one who thinks along the same lines.
The Girl With Two Breasts is in my opinion one of the best episodes. Anyway, it could provide you with many hours of entertainment. But what the one thinks is funny, an other might think repulsive stupidity. So do sample a bit first before buying.",1069027200,,834,4.839160839160839

The show is about six friends who all have had,are having or want to be having a relationship with each other. The six characters are much more loveable than any other comedy shows characters are. The acting is some of the best I have ever seen in a comedy series and I think that the script is funnier than all of ABC, CBS and NBCs scripts combined. The ""new"" Coupling on NBC is absolutely horrible! The acting is wooden, the script is edited, and the show completely loses its feel and sexuality when you compare the two shows.
 My personal favorite episode is ""Inferno"" but they are all good. A favorite character is impossible to choose since they are all so wonderful. This is truly the BEST COMEDY SHOW EVER and I recommend buying it highly.",1066608000,9,817,4.673611111111111

Unfortunately, they've been a bit short-sighted here. Our seasons are longer (22-24 episodes). The British first season is all of six episodes. NBC is going to run out of scripts to recycle very soon.

You will soon be able to anticipate 90% of the jokes before you even hear them: the woman paranoid about wrinkles, the man obsessed with breasts, the man worried about being outdone by his date's vibrator, etc.  The second episode details one of the most charmless first dates ever recorded on tape, in a way that really captures the feel of the series: Susan and Steve discuss whether they will have sex that night as though they are talking about the weather.  After a certain, presumably socially-dictated amount of time spent chatting, Susan announced that it's time for them to have sex.  This isn't supposed to be funny for being so weird--it's played as though completely normal.  Susan actually leaves Steven in the bedroom to spend time in the bathroom ""preparing"" before the two get it on for the very first time.  It would be as though our parents were transported into our Gen X bodies, displaying all their anxiety and self-consciousness about sex in a setting where it just doesn't fit.  The dialogue of this series is occasionally very witty, and the Jeff character can be brilliant (his extended scene speaking ""Hebrew"" is truly terrific), but mostly the jokes are just old.  If you're looking for a fresh, hilarious, irreverent, sensitive (albeit also unrealistic), comedy about modern sex, rent the Sex in the City DVDs instead.",1065657600,7,1415,4.891213389121339
1802849,5,B0000797E5,"The British ""Coupling,"" the version that is worth watching, features some absolutely terrific acting, wonderful comedy and true moments of innovation. Jack Davenport, who starred in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" appears in this BBC series as Steve, who in the series' first episode breaks up with the daffy Jane and goes on a date with Susan, who is clever and sexy. Susan, of course, has just broken up with Patrick the human tripod, who is now interested in Sally, Susan's best friend and a beautician obsessed with preserving herself. Rounding out the characters is Jeff, an altogether weird one who is Steve's best friend and Susan's co-worker. If you've seen the American version, then you get the basic idea of how they all meet and mix together.
But to see a cast of true inspiration and genuine hilarity, you need to catch these DVDs of the British series. The acting is better, the episodes are deeper, the writing is more clever and twisted. There's no canned laughter on this version - nor is there reason for it.

The show that followed Python was something called ""Coupling"" that I had no intention of watching if it hadn't been for that little streak of laziness.
As it turned out, I happened to tune in during a Coupling marathon which played every episode from the first season back to back. Within ten minutes of watching ""Flushed"", I was hooked!
How good was it?
BBC America showed the marathon twice in a row... and, don't you know, I watched it in its entirety... TWICE!! I was an immediate fan, as you will be, too!
I had never before seen a show as cleverly written and imaginative. An example of this would be where in the local bar, a main character, Jeff, sits at a table with a beautiful Israeli girl who doesn't speak a lick of english. The hilarity of him trying to break the language barrier ... was good enough. But it didn't stop there. All of a sudden the scene stops and rewinds to where he sits down with her, and some graphics come up saying ""Now imagine that you don't speak English..."" Then it replays the entire scene with the Israeli girl speaking English, and everyone else in the bar speaking some other language. Now you see how tough the language barrier really can be. All the parts you thought were funny before become downright hilarious in another language!! You'll never look at a ""woman with two breasts"" the same ever again!
I've now been a devoted fan for its three seasons with many to follow (I hope). I can't imagine what this show will be like when it is remade for America to replace ""Friends"". We should just leave well enough alone and show the British version instead. I""m sure I'll watch one or two of the American episodes, but I truly doubt if it will be as good as the original.
The cast has such great chemistry with each other. Half of its charm is that I didn't know any of the actors from anything else, which made it truly ""fresh"". There's no doubt that the American producers will try to put one or two ""stars"" in the series which will taint the show from the start.
Trust me... Buy the DVD and enjoy it time and again. This show will have you laughing aloud to yourself in church when one of the many memorable scenes suddenly pops into your head!",1053129600,2,2366,4.355203619909502

These relationships run the gamut from friendships, flirtation and of course romance and sexuality.
Of particular interest is the ""Jeff"" character who is cut mostly from the same cloth as Seinfeld's ""Kramer"". Jeff is hardly a clone however- and over time I came to quite appreciate his wit and witnessness.

But, when my wife and I watched the first episode of Coupling, we both laughed our [bottoms]off!  This is by far the funniest comedy I've seen in years, and this is coming from a big fan of Black Adder and Jeeves and Wooster.

I initially felt that this was a bootleg attempt at what many times we as an American audience have borne witness to . . . a trans-Atlantic version of a successful sitcom from the home country.
But over a period of watching the show, I was pleased with the wittiness of the dialogue and the chemsitry between the characters.  So yes, this may borrow some elements from successful American shows (like the ones I mentioned above), but it has a uniqueness all its own.
P.S. I read that they will attempt to make an American version of ""Coupling"" in 2003.  My advice:  leave it alone!",1047945600,,742,4.466666666666667

I don't really like to compare this show to ""Friends"", but resemblance is there: three guys and three girls hanging out at the pub. Difference is that ""Coupling"" is actually funny and inventive. It is said that men think about sex every 4.5 seconds, well women are no exception.

It is also contemporary and at times both hilariously silly and true, as well as explicit in terms of discussing sexuality and relationships. So, if you're okay with that, you'll adore this series. It's kind of like, well, the Networks here in the U.S. are catagorizing it as a ""Friends"" meets ""Sex in the City"" and much to my sadness and terror, NBC has purchased Coupling and plans to make it an Americna show. (This makes me want to cry! Will they destroy the show, as they did with British Men Behaving Badly? . . .Yes, duh.) The only hope, the only shred of hope, is that NBC has also brought in the British team who created the show on the BBC, to help with the show in the States.
Okay, anyway, the show is about 3 lovely youngish 30-something women and 3 30-something men, who are handsome,(I think) and quirky enough, and upon further reflection, I'm not sure if the men are handsome on first glance. The women are. But, regardless, everyone has their quirks and issues and these are all explored and hence an amazingly funny and candid comedy is created. The show is mainly about their day-to-day lives and focuses on their relationships with each other and the various comings and goings of other boyfriends and girlfriends.
Plus, there are some crossover boyfriends and girlfriends, within the group of 6, and I'd have to draw you a Venn diagram to explain it all. Needless to say the complexity adds to the multitude of comedic sitautions. Bottom line, very, very funny.",1046908800,,1530,4.67037037037037

""Coupling"" is certainly a BBC sitcom, but it doesn't stray over the top as do some.  While it can get carried away with characters' obsessions with sex, there is no resemblance to sophomoric Hollywood sex jokes or gags.
Unlike many comedies, good or bad, it isn't uneven. All characters, actors and episodes are strong.
If you're looking at this because you've typed in ""Jack Davenport"", who I believe is the only actor from ""Coupling"" with much recognition in the US, you'll undoubtedly be delighted.

This show hits you with zingers completely out of left field.
For example, in one scene, one of the women has a crush on a man in the group, she shows up at his house only to find out, after flirting with him and getting his interest that there is a girl already in his bedroom,  he explains that ""She is down to her underware so he should go back ion there""  The girl then explains how she would never try to interfere with him when he is with another woman, then right before leaving she looks back at him and says ""Underware?

This show packs so many burst-out-laughing scenes that it's strange that it remains a highly coveted secret by those who are aware of it. I, personally, tell everyone I know about it and have successfully managed to get five of my friends loyally addicted to it. Even my friends, who previously loathed British comedies, got sucked into this show and now watch every week.
It's that good.
Coupling has the outrageous not-afraid-to-be-crazy humor that Sex in the City is missing; and the blatant sex that Friends lacks. By outrageous humor; imagine two female cast characters talking about the endowment of one of the male friends, and immediately afterwards the one female decides her previous indifference to him can be chucked for a good roll in the hay. Now imagine her in agony because his politics doesn't mesh with hers -- to the point that she insists one of the other male characters go with Mr. Super Endowed to the bathroom to ensure he truly has been blessed. Eh, you have to watch it, it's hysterical.
There's too much on this DVD to go into, but you're guaranteed a good couple ""oh my God did they actually say/do that?!"" kind of laugh.
The show revolves around six friends; Jeff (clumsy around women, bizarre ways of looking at the world), Patrick (let's see how many women I can get into bed, confidence guy), Steve (""normal"" good guy), Susan (centered female, sexually confident, lots of ex lovers), Jane (bisexual crazy woman, lives in own fantasy world) and Sally (age obsessed, moisturizing, liberal princess type) -- each with their own unique view of relationships, sex and living life in their late 20s, early 30s in London.
British comedies tend to push the envelope and this show is no exception. You'll be delighted, shocked, and intrigued by Coupling ... and this DVD offers the beginning of your addiction with it. (And, it's a great deal, where else could you find the entire first season of a show for this kind of price?!)
So get it, get caught up, then tune your television to BBC America. You can thank me when Coupling becomes your newest ""must see"" television.

This show combines the best of Seinfeld in witty dialogue and offbeat characters, and Sex and the City with its frank sex talk.  I joined on to Coupling in the midst of the third season on BBC America, so I decided to shell out the money for the Season 1 DVD and found it was money well spent.
I never thought I would (or could) laugh for 30 minutes straight, but I did.  There is not one slow moment during each episode.
My personal highlights:
-- The Reservoir Dogs impersonation by the men in the third episode.
-- Steve attempting to put a plot to a porn film in the fourth episode.
-- Anything (and I mean anything) that comes out of Jeff's mouth.
The only downside if there can be one is that there are only six episodes, but from what I understand about British television, series run a lot shorter than their American counterparts since there is only one writer for Brit shows, as opposed to a team of writers for most American shows.
Let's hope Season 2 comes stateside on DVD soon! :)

1802913,5,B0000797E5,"""Coupling"" was a discovery I made one night during an evening of channel surfing on the cable. I stopped the clicker on my local PBS station, which was showing a scene of some attractive, hip, thirty-somethings trading quips and witty banter (with British accents) at a local urban watering hole.""This looks interesting"" I thought. By the end of the thirty minutes I was completely hooked on the racey conversations and situations that occurred in the lives of the wacky characters Steve, Patrick, Jeff, Susan, Sally, and of course, Jane. Many folks have comparatively called this show the British equivalent of ""Friends"".While there might superficially be some similarities, I think ""Coupling"" goes much further into farcial comedy territory. Many American network TV shows deal in euphemisms and double entendres when it comes to carnal situations. But the BBC's ""Coupling"" makes no bones about the fact it's primarily about SEX and the crazy situations we get ourselves into because of it. The characters on the show are often vain, shallow and often crazy. But they are also gut-wrenchingly funny as they spin away their endless, wacky theories & ideals about the opposite sex and how to navigate them into bed. These discourses on dealing with modern sexual politics usually leaves one or more of the characters naked and humiliated by the episode's end! My personal favorite characters are Jeff(an imbecile with his stories about having one leg and ear collections!) and the totally non-sensical, spacey, Jane (this generation's Gracie Allen).The show is witty, well written (often using ""Pulp Fiction"" like time shifts in story structure) and just plain out and out funny!

It's also going to be important to grab the BBC show on DVD, because the upcoming NBC (American) version seems destined to utterly fail.  If they manage to keep it on the air, I'd be shocked, knowing what American versions of British comedies tend to turn out like.
There's a larger debate here about just WHY our American networks think they need to redo British shows for American audiences, but this isn't the place.

1802929,5,B0000797E5,"This is one of the best British TV series I have ever watched. Comments on the BBC America ads make references to Friends and Sex in the City. I don't watch either one. The series focuses on how obsessive we are about things when dealing with relationships. In fact, it's based (loosely I'd imagine) on a real relationship. (Hint: look at the production credits - including the opening titles. The answer is in the extras on the DVD.)
The series focuses on 6 friends - Steve, Susan, Jane, Sally, Jeff, and Patrick. However, the primary focus of the series is the development of the relationship between Steve and Susan. The first episode begins with their old relationships ending. Jane and Patrick are the exs, and they stick around as friends.
Steve and Susan are the more ""normal"" ones of the group. Steve has a habit of getting into awkward situations. Susan is very open with sexual topics. (more so in later seasons)
The others are a bit different. Each set of male and female friends have similar personality types. Although I've paired them up for comparison purposes, they are not in relationships with each other.
Sally and Patrick are somewhat self-obsessed. Sally is totally focused on her appearance and even counts Susan's wrinkles. She seems to talk the most about her neck although bottoms and noses do get mentioned in later episodes. (Nose in second season.) Patrick is more self-centered. He is the stereotypical male who likes cars (assumes everyone else does too) and thinks every woman is a potential date. He feels he can convert lesbians. Also, as Susan puts it, Patrick is ""a very big boy indeed."" You'll find out what I mean in the second episode.
Jane and Jeff are the odd ones with their own unusual views on life. Jane is probably also like a female version of Patrick, but Patrick doesn't seem insane. Jane views reality as centered on herself. Plus, she has her own unique views of reality. She is definitely not politically correct. She believes homosexual males still date women from time to time and heterosexual males may cuddle at times when convenient. However, this view may come from the fact she is bisexual, and, of course, reality must agree with her. Season 1 focuses on her getting over Steve's break-up with her. She is over it in season 2.
Jeff is the one with extremely unusual theories and insights. When Steve talks about a long pause in a phone conversation, Jeff compares the pause to The Blob. He introduces us to The Giggle Loop (a type of feedback loop for laughter) The Sock Gap, and Nudity Buffer. He also has a few theories about celebrity marriages. Since he tends to always say the wrong thing (*really* wrong thing!), his best potential date is someone who doesn't speak English.
This series was actually shot in 16x9. I had never really thought about the framing of the scenes. This is the first TV comedy I'd ever seen shot in a widescreen format. If you simply watch the BBC America broadcasts, I'm guessing about 1/4 of the image is missing (as with many full screen edition of movies on TV and video).

1802931,5,B0000797E5,"I've been on the BBCAmerica Discussion groups and the posts have been flying back and forth about ""Friends"" vs ""Coupling"" and the dreaded evil of an Americanized version. The truth is that there is an obvious, if not superficial, ""Friends"" type of foundation for this show. But that is truly where the comparison ends because ""Coupling"" is unlike anything we see on Network television (the Brits get away with so much!!).. and it is naughty without being filthy which, IMHO, adds to the hilarity of the show.
The Americanized version is in the works and is utilizing the same writers of the British version who have said they have the green light to keep it just as naughty. I reserve judgement. However, if it is done well, people who have never seen ""Coupling"" (or don't like British TV) and can get passed the ""Friends"" foundation, are in for a treat.  For the rest of us, there simply can be no replacement for the original.
If you want to laugh, and laugh hard... this is a great DVD to own.
Hope this helps.",1043107200,,1013,4.565934065934066

The actors are charming and the situations they get themselves into are hilarious without feeling contrived as so many US comedies seem to be these days. The Brits are much more straight foreward when is comes to sex and sexual situations and their treatment of this subject matter may put some people off.  For the rest of you, if you want a fresh new approach to the interactions of modern men and women you won't find anything better than Coupling.  [...]",1041811200,,610,4.428571428571429
1802934,5,B0000797E5,"This show is funny, yet risque look of relationships that intermingle with friendship and sex.  Definitely worth the subscriber fee.

1802935,5,B0000797E5,"The characters in Coupling are wonderfully quirky and interesting. The dialog is quick and witty. Despite the characters' somewhat implausible friendships as a group - the clever writers pull it off and the resulting repartee is terrifically funny.
The DVD includes the Episodes: Flushed; Size Matters; Sex Death and Nudity; Inferno; The Girl with Two Breasts; and The Cupboard of Patrick's Love
Wait till you hear about ""Wobble Wars""! :-D
The characters are six thirty-something friends who are involved, formerly involved, or potentially will be involved with one another.
Susan is beautiful, bright, secure and sexy tart.
Jane is a nitwit completely oblivious to social tact and often oblivious in general.
Sally is pretty, but shallow, insecure, and vain. She is obsessed with appearance and aging (primarily her own but she also delights in critiquing other women).
Steve is a bit neurotic but the closest to ""normal"" in this bunch.
Jeff is a lunatic who has never had a normal healthy relationship with a women. Typically when he is around attractive women his brain disengages and he stammers himself into impossible-to-explain situations. Jeff has his own unique views on life and has named some of life's most arcane occurrences (""the sock gap"" etc.). Naturally he has to explain this stuff to his friends.
Patrick is a lothario who is the antithesis of political correctness.
This is the funniest show on television - period. I regularly laugh out loud especially at Steve and Patrick's reactions to Jeff's absurdity. How many laugh-out-loud funny shows are there on television really? The humor is at times British but that only contributes to Coupling's charm.
Coupling is probably not appropriate for young children and the character's topic of discussions are frequently sexual in nature.
Hysterically funny show! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1041724800,17,1862,5.189368770764119
1802936,5,B0000797E5,"In the United States, a basic description of Coupling - six stylish twentysomethings, three male & three female, hanging out together in a trendy urban setting - clearly invites comparisons to Friends.  However, this show is not just about 6 happy-go-lucky buds and their wacky adventures learning about life.  This is about 6 varyingly neurotic singles trying to balance their libidos with their inhibitions and insecurities, with a definite focus on sex and dating.
When compared to Friends, Coupling has a sharper, biting wit, and less linear, more intricate storytelling.  If a comparison to American television must be made, Seinfeld is probably a more appropriate choice.  The ""Masturbation"" episode of Seinfeld could have been written for Coupling.  Like Seinfeld, Coupling makes use of a number of tricky storytelling devices. For example, the story may cut back and forth between a scene where a member of the gang is recounting an event to his friends at the bar, and the event itself, where the joke is the difference between what's said and what really happened.  And like Seinfeld, this is usually good, but occassionally gimicky.
However, you probably won't buy this for yourself or your friends based on comparisons to US shows.  This has a British sense of humor, so its best to compare it to similar British shows.  This show will be most appreciated by folks who enjoy British comedies such as BlackAdder, Father Ted, and Red Dwarf.  While the subject matter can be decidedly lowbrow (its about sex, after all), the wit of the dialoque and the sharpness of its satirical edge can be as fine as older comedies such as Fawlty Towers, Yes Minister, and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin.
If you're looking for charming, elegant English comedies a la Keeping Up Appearances or As Time Goes By, you might want to ease into the darker comedy with Blackadder or Father Ted before buying Coupling.",1039305600,5,1910,4.962382445141066
1802937,5,B0000797E5,"I'm so used to so many shows today giving you a couple of so-so jokes and then pad the other 20 minutes with dribble.
Not so with Coupling.  This show has me laughing out loud throughout.  And when I'm not laughing, I'm busy trying to guess where in the world they are taking this episode (I'm always wrong).
It's refreshing story-telling technique is also worth mentioning.  Episodes could be completely linear or they might jump from one point to another and then back in time to the start of the episode to it's climax etc., or it may just stop the show completely half way through and then retell the first half again (albeit from a different perspective).
If you haven't yet seen this show on BBC America (or better yet on PBS without the commercials) I could not recommend it more highly.",1039046400,,794,4.538461538461538
