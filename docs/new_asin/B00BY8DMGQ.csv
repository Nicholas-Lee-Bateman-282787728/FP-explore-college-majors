5681941,4,B00BY8DMGQ,"I am a big horror fan, and like any horror fan, you start to get used to the rhythm of horror movies. Start with a big scare not necessarily including the main characters, introduce the leads, have lesser characters die off, big scare ending. This movie was going for something a little different. As opposed to a lot of horror movies where the drama and comedy seem like after thoughts, in Absence they were almost more the meat of the movie. Don't get me wrong, there are some really creepy moments, and the finale is satisfyingly nuts, but what I liked most was how much I found myself caring about the characters.  The actress playing Liz especially is excellent and delivers some very emotionally powerful stuff. And her brother Evan had me laughing out loud and was way more genuinely funny than a lot of the cheesy humor in a lot of horror movies. When Absence was working best, it felt a lot like hanging out with friends who you really cared about. If I had one complaint, I thought it could have maybe cut back a little bit on the ""this-is-found-footage-so-here-is-a-boring-shot-of-the-kitchen"" type moments, but it was not too bad at all with those and certainly better than some other found footage type movies I have seen. All in all, keep an open mind about this movie as a ""genre film"" and you will be pleasantly surprised.",1377561600,7,1338,4.6455696202531644
5681942,3,B00BY8DMGQ,"All in all it was good movie.  The acting was very good.  There were a few holes in the plot, but basically it was well worth the rental fee.  These kinds of movies creep me out a little anyway, so for me it was very suspenseful!  I gave it a solid three...",1376870400,,257,3.8846153846153846
5681943,3,B00BY8DMGQ,"Absence is a suspense release that uses the found-footage technique. I give it a mild recommendation for its target audience. A woman is seven-months pregnant; then, her child suddenly disappears from her womb. Then, her family and she disappear into the woods for a vacation after this traumatic event. Much like the Blair Witch Project, viewers see the actors much, much, much more than they see any creatures or special effects in the movie. Much like in Paranormal Activity, scary events happen mostly subtly and on a small-scale. Many found-footage movies have followed this cast-centric approach recently. Perhaps, they do so for budgetary reasons. Absence is the best film of this type that Absence can be. The performances are strong. These actors can act. I was actually very impressed with the main three cast members. The dialogue is witty and realistic. If one seeks good found-footage, Absence exemplifies well-done limited-budget found-footage.",1376352000,6,958,5.3509933774834435
5681944,4,B00BY8DMGQ,"Scary movies are my thing, and this is one of the rare good ones. In most horror/sci-fi movies the characters make decisions so stupid you want to punch yourself in the face, but Absence avoids that. Scary movies should always be funny, and this one is. Also, Erin Way (Liz) absolutely KILLS it. If you watch it more than once, you catch things you didn't the first time, which is another sign of a good film.",1375660800,2,409,4.394736842105263
5681945,4,B00BY8DMGQ,We saw this film n NYC and we thought it was entertaining and there were many edge of your seats moments. The actor who plays Erin Way's brother: Ryan Smale was very funny and there was a lot of laughter from the audience. The story line and found footage genre seemed real. We all talked about it after movie and the possibility of fetal abductions. Turns out they are real. I've been disturbed by this film ever since.,1374624000,2,420,4.397435897435898
5681946,5,B00BY8DMGQ,"From the start, this film creates an intricate mystery of exactly WHAT happened to the fetus carried by a woman - who is now a suspect in its very disappearance. When her brother decides to film nearly every waking minute of her existence, things get shaken up very quickly! The few special effects in the film are just enough to make your skin crawl, as they do the woman's (literally!) Was it aliens who took over her body? You may still be wondering by the end of the film. If you like the volume loud, prepare for a few blasts!",1373846400,2,531,4.32
5681963,2,B00BY8DMGQ,"Story: Husband and wife in hospital, baby missing after birth, take a trip to a cabin in the mountains to try and gather some solace about the situation, brother of wife brings self and camera on trip along with his psychotic obsession with camera. Some other chick keeps showing up in the cabin but never stays for very long. (Maybe she lives in the woods, who knows?)

I was exactly 1:04 (that is one hour, not one minute) into the film when something actually happened. Is that ridiculous or what? Sad thing is we don't even know what happened, and we NEVER find out. There is SO much footage of following people around who are doing nothing but ""being"" on a camping trip; so boring, I cannot even put it into words. I could watch a nature channel for that kind of footage and get a WHOLE lot more out of it. The characters are uninteresting. The main story is scripted like a second-thought to all the nothingness that is occurring.

Case in point: There was more focus on the fact that a guy was walking around with a camera than there was with the footage the camera was picking up; and there was a very good reason for it. The camera wasn't picking up ANYTHING worth filming. Sadly, in the end, the audience didn't even know what the cause of any of the nothingness was anyway. So the payoff was a bunch of nothing for a bunch of nothing.

This is a one-star film. The ONLY reason I gave it an extra star is because the acting was not forced or over-the-top, and the actors were doing the best they could with what they were given.

Steer clear of this dud!",1417737600,,1564,4.345890410958904
5681964,3,B00BY8DMGQ,"Again bunch of first time film makers attempting to pull off a ""found video"" If you've got nothing to do for an hour and a half and want to waste some $ go for it, other wise pass it by.",1397952000,,186,3.675
5681965,1,B00BY8DMGQ,"If I could give it zero stars I would. Most boring movie I have ever seen- kept hoping it would get better, but it did not.  The only excitement was literally in the last 30 seconds of the movie.
What a snooze fest, should absolutely not be called a horror movie.",1397692800,,263,4.1568627450980395
5681966,4,B00BY8DMGQ,"This movie was surprisingly good.  My finance and I both agreed why can't there be more horror movies like this instead of the same, typical run of the mill ones that are present today.  This is why I choose Amazon to find this unknown ""gems"" instead of On-Demand.",1379894400,5,264,4.479166666666667
5681967,4,B00BY8DMGQ,"I enjoyed this . . . At first you may think you are watching some kind of mystery but then weird things happen.  Erin Way as Liz is especially good, good at crying. Her brother is somewhat obnoxious but at least he has an explanation for it.  I don't do spoilers per se, and you have most likely read the synopsis -- I am just here to tell you whether I liked the movie or not - and I liked this one.  I am a sucker for found footage and this is one of the better ones.  Some creepy parts, some jumps, decent all-around acting. . . . Yes, I recommend.",1379808000,3,551,3.936936936936937
5681968,5,B00BY8DMGQ,"While I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Alien Abduction: Incident In Lake County, and The Wicksborro Incident did very impressive things with a very low budget, objectively speaking Absence is the best alien-themed found footage movie yet. The acting and story are interesting and enjoyable, the SFX are very effective and believable, and like every good found footage movie, it waits for the right moment to let hell break loose. It definitely creeped me the hell out. Fourth Kind may have had higher production values but it was bogged down by ridiculous gimmicks, and Area 51 Confidential lacked any kind of payoff for the audience what-so-ever. Absence succeeds were most of its predecessors failed. Granted, it didn't have a whole lot to compete against, but it's the best of its ilk yet. I'm really glad this movie exists because I've been waiting for something like it for a long time, and there have been so many near misses. Absence is the real deal.",1378771200,2,970,4.81437125748503
5681969,1,B00BY8DMGQ,"Movie doesn't really tackle anything to do with aliens or anything else until nearly the end. I was starting to have doubts I was even watching the right movie. Mostly just shows some out of focus lights and some other things, but the only really creepy part in the whole movie is the part they show in the preview.

Mostly the movie was a let down on the alien aspect. If your looking for a movie with tons of character building then its good on that part. Overall I wouldn't recommend it. Super happy I didn't buy it and instead watched it on netflix.",1378684800,,553,4.3173076923076925
5681970,3,B00BY8DMGQ,"The premise was interesting. The camera operator character was annoying most of the time. I liked the story and some of the dialog and character interactions. But the biggest turnoff was the filming style. If I knew it was supposed to be like a documentary, I would have saved my money.",1378166400,,286,4.627450980392157
5681971,1,B00BY8DMGQ,"Poor and inconsistent audio levels, poor enunciation at times and no subtitles made it difficult to follow the dialogue.
Typical shaky hand held camera with the bonus of numerous out-of-focus scenes.
Nothing happens for 3/4th of the movie other than a mother has her newborn disappear from the hospital and no one knows what happened? Not likely scenario.
So mom and dad and mom's brother go on a trip to allow her to recover from her baby's disappearance. Brother does the hand held filming.
Towards the end dad is seen for a few moments floating in the corner of a room which doesn't make any sense with the previous hour of film or storyline. Final scene is a millisecond shadowy glimpse of the stereotyped alien and the three are dead or disappear somewhere.
End of low budget over used storyline.",1378080000,,801,4.728571428571429
5681972,2,B00BY8DMGQ,"I found this movie to be very boaring, it seemed to go on for ever, not scary what so ever and the ending was disappointing I thought. But that's just my opinion.",1377561600,,162,4.09375
8575388,4,B00BY8DMGQ,"excellent  movie, wish they would of been more open so we would of seen the aliens. the shaky,blurry,loud static , is old-maybe the 90's.",1522022400,,137,4.708333333333333
8575389,5,B00BY8DMGQ,"A funny and mysterious record of a small extended family's vacation (with a splash of sinister). The 'found footage' aspects are very well done, tasteful, adding to the subtly of the story rather than being the distraction it sometimes is. The meat of this movie is about the realistic relationship between a brother and sister, two brother-in-laws, and the hardship of dealing with things out of our control.

Definitely recommended, a very entertaining, sneakily heartfelt, and worth-your-time 1hr20m ~",1506124800,,504,5.379746835443038
8575390,5,B00BY8DMGQ,He lived it awsome,1496620800,,18,3.75
8575391,1,B00BY8DMGQ,The story line isn't bad but being found footage/Blair witch knock off the camera was out of focus more than it was in focus. Yeah we get it you want us to believe it really happened but seriously being out of focus as much as it was became nothing but a distraction and you really can't enjoy the movie. Don't waste your money!!!!! Learn to use the auto focus!!!!,1494979200,,364,4.2898550724637685
8575392,4,B00BY8DMGQ,Was slow but it was good. I liked it. The way they joked around was good.,1492387200,,73,3.625
8575393,4,B00BY8DMGQ,"In its subtle way, this film is very good. Character development is very good, the acting and the characters very believable.  There's enough going on to keep us intrigued until we realize at the end, just what's happening and who's doing it.  The girlfriend's occasional mini panic and paranoia tells us, without being definitive, that she likely has some unpleasant repressed memories of her own regarding our mysterious visitors.  The suspense was quite good, and the realism top flight.  But if you don't like ""subtle"", don't bother with this film.",1484006400,,552,5.1
8575394,4,B00BY8DMGQ,"Surprisingly good, definitely better than the plot summary would lead you to expect. Pretty decent performances, with the characters relationships all being just off-kilter enough to be interesting. Sci fi elements are used sparingly and just enough to keep it from being bogged down in too much drama.",1471737600,,302,5.3125

8575396,4,B00BY8DMGQ,"This movie was so good.  I first watched it on Netflix and then just had to buy it.  It is or at least starts of as a sad story about a woman who mysteriously looses her unborn child in the middle of the night, with no blood and no clues as to what could have happened.  Her, her husband and brother go up and stay at a family cabin to get away from everyone (since most of the town thinks she some how got rid of her unborn baby).  Her brother documents the whole thing for film class.  Unfortunately they go to the worst possible place they can think of to heal.  It is apparently known to have a strong ongoing history of strange lights and strange encounters.  Every night the couple is visited by these lights and no one seems to remember anything about the night before.  I kept wishing the brother would rewind his camera to see what was going on.  The at the end something bizarre  happens that climax to something much worse happening.  Cannot say anything more than that without spoiling the end.  I think this is a very good movie and I would watch it again and again.",1443312000,,1079,4.261083743842365
8575397,3,B00BY8DMGQ,An okay movie that needed a bit more story line to it.,1429401600,,54,3.5833333333333335
