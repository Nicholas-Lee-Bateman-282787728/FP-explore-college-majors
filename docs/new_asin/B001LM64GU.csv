3685385,1,B001LM64GU,"I recently went to Bali on my honeymoon, so when I saw this was coming out on blu-ray I couldn't wait to see it and potentially revisit some of my favorite locales.  After viewing it, I couldn't be more disappointed with this sorry waste of money.  For starters, it is under 48 minutes long, not the 60 minutes that Amazon and the package advertise.  Apparently the photographers who shot this video felt is was only necessary to go to approximately 3 places on the whole island and shoot all of their footage there.  Clearly they went to the Bali Bird Park and shot at least 15 minutes of footage there of various birds (without giving any credit to the park), thereby misleading the viewer into thinking that these birds are just randomly roaming the island.  An additional 20 minutes of footage showed various dragonflies and butterflies...exciting.  They advertised that the video includes footage of one of the most breathtaking sights on all of Bali, the Tanah Lot temple.  In total there is about 8 seconds of footage of it during the beginning and end credits.  There is no footage at all of any of the resort areas, cities, Ubud, the volcanoes, or anyplace else recognizeable.  Some of the background music is Balinese, but most of it is muzak garbage.  All in all, whether you are a prior visitor to Bali or hoping to become acquainted with this wonderful island, this video will do nothing but disappoint.  Avoid it at all costs.",1233100800,16,1440,4.697211155378486

As others have also mentioned, I wish that this had the option to turn off the music as many of the other Earthscapes series has.  That being said, it is enjoyable to watch when the ""mute"" button is on; which is why I gave it 3 starts.",1388361600,,312,4.098360655737705
3685417,2,B001LM64GU,I had to admit I didn't watch the whole movie.  I had to turn it off after 5 mins because the music was so bad.  Just looked very unprofessionally done as far as the video.  Would not recommend.,1388102400,,194,4.052631578947368

3685419,3,B001LM64GU,"Having spent close to three weeks in Bali in 2000, I was anxious to revisit it through this DVD.  The photography and filming are stunning. But you don't see much of Bali.  As others have mentioned, you get a lot of closeups of flowers and butterflies. While beautiful, that wasn't the Bali we saw.  Flowers were around but not in the amount represented on the DVD.  Ditto the butterflies.  Music was decidedly not Balinese.  Which may be a good thing.  I wasn't a fan of the gamelan music.  However, some of that music could have been represented on the DVD. The music that was chosen was not suitable, at times sounding like Caribbean music. There is no commentary at all.  Whether that is good or bad is a personal preference. I suppose commentary is unnecessary for the endless shots of flowers and butterflies.  I recognized a few sites - Tampaksiring, Danau Bratan, Mengwi, Besakih,  and Lovina. The other fail, is that only one part of the year was represented with the rice paddies all newly planted.  As well, some of the most stunning rice paddies were not shown.  None of the monkey forests were shown.  And only small snippets of the beautiful Balinese people were shown. This DVD, while showing beautiful pictures, is not for anyone who really wants to see or know about Bali.",1364083200,,1289,4.671111111111111
3685420,5,B001LM64GU,"The Living Landscape Series of Blue Ray discs is unlike any other video series.

It's important to understand what these are, so you will not be disappointed.  These are NOT entertainment videos, and NOT educational videos.  If you are looking for a documentary ... look elsewhere.  But one step more than that... these are also NOT videos that are designed to be ""interesting"" or to ""keep your attention""... rather... they are extremely pleasant background videos.

Most people would probably not sit down and actively WATCH these videos from beginning to end (at least not more than one time, out of curiosity).  They are meant to be a soothing... meditative... UNEVENTFUL... relaxing background images with very subtle nature sounds.

You should be advised that the camera pans across the up-close landscape images very, very slowly.  It does not change from scene to scene quickly... it lingers at great length... hanging upon a single scene for with minimal camera movement for a few minutes at a clip.

It's nice to have this playing while you are reading, or cooking, or working on your computer... and just occasionally glancing up at the screen... rather than sitting and intently focussing upon the video as if it were some sort of ""feature presentation"" to watch.  You may also find it helps to put you to sleep, or to calm an infant.

So honestly... this type of video is not for everyone... probably not for most people... but if you like the meditative and slow lingering of the camera upon water droplets tickling off a branch without the scene changing for two minutes or more... then maybe this is for you.

Personally, I like it.  It's like the video form of Valium.

Reeeeeeeeelaaaaaaaaax.  :)

The Olympic Rainforest and the Redwood Forest are my two favorite discs in this series.",1362009600,4,1801,4.894389438943894

If you're hoping to see (or revisit) some of the most iconic places on Bali you'll be extremely disappointed.  They don't even go to Tanah Lot!  And the music...you'd think the soundtrack would be indiginous Balinese gamalong music but it's not.  It's some made-up soundtrack that does not even remotely sound like you're on Bali.

3685423,5,B001LM64GU,This is one of my favorite 3 HD samplers and I watch it repeatedly.  I collect HD samplers.  This movie is unique in that it is the only one that takes place in Costa Rica.,1304380800,,172,3.8857142857142857
3685424,2,B001LM64GU,"Based on some comments left on several ""Living landscapes"" volumes by Mr. Heumann (from the producing Studio), I purchased nine volumes from this blu-ray series - all from the same Amazon seller - with the certainty that I could turn the music off, and hear just nature's sounds.

Out of the nine I purchased, there are THREE(""World's most beautiful Sunrises & Sunsets"", ""Four seasons and ""Bali"" - sadly, among my favourite ones), that do not provide any audio option at all (I made dead sure about that): you just have to watch them with the music playing.

I figure they're part of an older batch, but I believe the producing Studio should have made sure that ALL of them were pulled out of the market, before reassuring the customers about the adio specs.

Needless to say, I'm very disappointed by all of that. I've been meaning to contact the producing Studio to get a replacement but couldn't find an email contact for the life of me.

It's a shame, cause I'd be happy about my purchase if it wasn't for that.",1304121600,4,1015,4.5911602209944755
3685438,5,B001LM64GU,Watching this video I became immersed in the rich imagery. I felt like I was on a virtual vacation to this exotic place. The people and culture are wonderous to behold. The beatiful art and design of the buildings is amazing and very different from western culture. The HiDef video really defines things so clearly that you feel like your there. Unbelievable photographic detail allows you appreciate the culture on a very deep and profound level. I highly recommend this videographic adventure!,1285459200,3,495,5.048780487804878
3685439,4,B001LM64GU,"If you are interested only in nature, this is quite stunning. A very good blu-ray product.
But I had hoped to see more of the culture which is an aspect that is actually very much linked to Bali's nature, and that was only very sparse.",1270598400,,235,4.2444444444444445
3685440,5,B001LM64GU,"This is one of the best ""Real feeling of being in the natural world"" DVDs I've seen. It's as if you are on vacation and take a walk in a lush rainforest. As you walk down paths where there are no other people, stresses, or distractions, you get to see nature at its best. There are soft, comforting sounds of doves and other birds. The tropical foliage ripples in the wind, with the colors of green, gold, and a little bit of red, giving an almost surreal appearance. There are varying sizes of waterfalls, ponds, and streams, all surrounded with ferns and moss. The water is so clear you can see the pebbles on the bottom. You hear the soft rain falling on the pond, as the camera ever so slowly turns your gaze to focus on one exquisite view after another. You aren't in a hurry. You take all the time you want, and you go back whenever you wish.

I've visited a rain forest and would love to go back. For now though, this video is just right for my purposes. I have it on as I'm typing this review. Earlier I used it as background while I was reading, listening to the sounds of the water, glancing up from time to time to enjoy the view. The 'nature sounds only' option is very unobtrusive, with bird sounds so real I keep thinking they are outside my window. My dog even thought so and I have lots of nature videos that he never reacts to at all. There may be wildlife in there and I'll continue to look for some as I use the video to relax after a particularly stressful day. Just now I caught myself breathing more deeply, something I normally don't have ""time"" to do.

The best use I am getting from this video is blocking out the stresses of my regular routine and getting rid of unnecessary tension, something this video achieves in just a few short minutes. As a bonus, I'm also getting some great landscaping ideas for the water feature (small waterfall and large pond) in my back yard. That was a plus I hadn't expected.

Even though I tend to turn off the music by choosing the nature sounds only option, which is now available. I have used the music option as well, and it was very appropriate and a good option for times when you want music. I'm glad that choice is available.",1268524800,2,2192,4.302663438256658
3685441,5,B001LM64GU,"Viewing this beautiful footage of Bali gave me the feeling of ""being there."" I could almost smell the smells and feel the warm breeze. I got a feel for these beautiful people on the island of Bali and a sense of their sacred culture and insight into the  role of art and creativity there. I thought, ""I can be a world traveler without ever having to get on an airplane again!"" I am going to get all of Michael Heumann's Blu Ray Living Landscapes.

3685443,5,B001LM64GU,"I have a good number of nature video dvd's, Let me say that with this Bluray edition of Olympic Rainforest a very interesting thing occurred not that long ago.
Some weeks ago while So. California was in the midst's of one of the fabled Santa Ana heat waves I popped this beautiful disc into my home theater, punched up 5.1 surround and began to walk the rainforest  when I realized that I was experiencing a physical reaction of it becoming cooler in the room. Watching the rain dripping off of fern tips and the fog and mists wafting through the air was having a real psychological and physiological effect on me. Coupled with the music and natural sound effects of dripping water, running water, it was just pure enjoyment. The videography is simply artful. It is a real treat to walk the paths through this amazing natural wonder. I highly recommend this dvd but you must get the BluRay versions or HDDVD if you have a player. Treat yourself to a feast of the senses. It's beauty at a walking pace. Enjoy the immersion.",1262390400,5,1022,4.554347826086956

My experience in hiking the boardwalk to the coast was that this amazing area was so much more than just moss hanging from gnarly trees.  I saw so many wild animals on this 9 mile hike that I thought for sure that the video would also document the fauna. Total count of animals shown, one bird, a few fish...",1258675200,2,451,4.409638554216867
3685445,5,B001LM64GU,"I am an avid collector of nature dvds. I love them as background while I complete tedious chores around the house. This series brings something different into the genre. Each disc is a destination, not just a theme.

The Bali disc is exotic in its local, and the soundtrack is exquisite. I like the option of turning on nature sounds and off the music to change things up, but this music is so well interwoven with the video, it is entrancing.

I recommend this series to any nature enthusiast, and I encourage all office bound working folk like myself to add something like this to your viewing collection to provide an escape to a tranquil locale at any time.

These titles are shot in HD, and I can only imagine how much more spectacular the picture is on an HD set since I do not yet have one.

More titles are due to be produced in this series, and I will be first in line to get them.

3685446,5,B001LM64GU,"The Living Landscapes series is one of highest quality productions I have seen in the genre.

The dvd clearly states that the video is interwoven with music, and I do agree with the reviewer in that I love the option of having nature sounds only, music, or both together on a dvd. Even though this is not an option on this series. the music is well done, and fits well with the scenery.

I took the time to ask the producer of this series to add this option for future releases, as there are some exciting titles coming up like The African Savannah and The Swiss Alps. Some of the videos are shot in time lapse, which makes the sequencing of natural sounds difficult, but I was told that this would be a feature that would be added in the future.

I am hoping this will be so, but on that Afican title I want some music that will match the modd of the title for a different experience as well.

The scenery is breathtaking, and it is a guaranteed escape to a place that most of us can only dream of seeing in person. It is well produced, and a true treat.

3685447,5,B001LM64GU,"This is a beautiful film - the high definition brings me right back to my trip there a few years ago. I don't want narration or education I wanted the experience back of being there. When I found this blu-ray I was hopeful that it would deliver that kind of experience.
It makes my living room become Bali and I can step back into the lush jungle, ocean and beautiful countryside instantly when I put this on. It makes my big old flat screen tv something of beauty rather than a kind of cold, gigantic 'thing' on the wall.
I've got quite a few of these living landscape DVDs for this very reason. they're cheap enough so I can bring a variety of 'feelings' to my home. It calms me down and picks up my spirit to watch these and just have them on in the background. I love them.",1233964800,2,777,4.1866666666666665

I am the type-A sort of person who cannot sit in the backyard without seeing a weed that needs pulling, which I get up and go pull. So this video set off that need. I also worried that the heavy moss, etc., hanging on the trees was killing the trees like kudzu. I am one of those people who actually watch these videos since I am not likely to go there, and I turn off the music so I can hear the birds and water - which there is not much of in this video - mostly it is a bunch of Boston ferns, moss, etc., who seem to be thriving in this area. I figure the photographer must have set up the camera to move a centimeter at a time and then went to lunch.
