8188077,3,B000GTJSQ2,"Sure, Corman's films were made fast and cheap.  But they're marvels.  Not all of them are good, but when they are - and this is a pretty good sampling - they're some of the weirdest psycho-sexual mind twists I've seen.  This set has terrible sound, making them hard to follow.  It's a shame because, really - there is content beyond the ""wacky"" plot outlines!  Still, this set is worth having around.",1241654400,,400,4.577464788732394
