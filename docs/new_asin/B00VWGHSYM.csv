8711434,5,B00VWGHSYM,"Great old time blues soundtrack that was the highlight in setting this low budget film apart from contemporary urban thrillers. I can see the black and white throwing people off before they see it, but it also adds the tone of the film. There is a surprising amount of graphic sex in this film, that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the viewer, but definitely worth a watch if you're a fan old time crime films.",1438646400,,426,4.271604938271605
