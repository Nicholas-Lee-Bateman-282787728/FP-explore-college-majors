4470402,2,B004UR1RBU,"My wife and I watched this hoping it would not contain the usual wooden acting and tortured plotting seen in so many faith-based movies. Unfortunately, we were disappointed, especially when the only review here was glowing (did he see the same movie we did???).  I am not going to repeat the much longer review I wrote for IMDB (under the name rbsteury) but if you are interested in why you should not waste your money on this, you can read it there. I have nothing against the producers of this movie but since they got my dollars for an inferior product, I just wanted to warn others.",1314144000,3,586,4.4766355140186915

8442040,2,B004UR1RBU,"Runs like a slow-moving play, I'm a Christian and would love to say I like this movie to say I could sit through it is rough, definitely better movies out there to get the point across. I found the acting to seem labored in many places some actors did much better I feel for you to be stuck in this movie.",1410307200,,305,4.016393442622951
8442041,2,B004UR1RBU,"The story of this film sounded good, but the movie was a disappointment.  Got it for a group Movie Night, and after previewing the movie, decided to not show it.  Waste of time.",1398643200,,177,4.333333333333333
8442042,5,B004UR1RBU,One of my favorite movies.  The plot seems disconnected at first but all flows together in the end - just like God has a plan for everyone's life and everything flows together the way he wants it to.  Nothing in life is by chance.  God wants all our circumstances to draw us closer to him but it is our choice.,1386720000,2,310,4.133333333333334
8442043,4,B004UR1RBU,"The Penny was a good movie and teaches some important lessons.
It isn't for young children that may be scared by the story.
It did a good job of teaching some important lessons.",1362700800,,177,4.393939393939394
8442044,5,B004UR1RBU,The Penny is what I expected great movie would recommended to everybody to watch. Hope people who watch  enjoy it as much as I did.,1358899200,,131,4.24
8442045,4,B004UR1RBU,"The cons first-

I was a little disappointed that they didn't share the Gospel more. They didn't really tell much about Jesus Christ and how he died for you. Which, I guess that wasn't really their focus, but in my opinion it would have been great to add. Any film considered a Christian film should have some of how Jesus Christ loves us and died to pay for our sins.

Overall though it was a great production. This wasn't some cheap production someone tried throwing together. A lot of thought and planning went into it. I liked how the first part gets your attention right away. It was a great story line too. It always keeps you guessing. It was gr8 how they also dealt with parent and teen relationship. Being kind, yet having rules and consequences. If parents today would grab a hold of this truth alone, America would be a different place.",1338595200,,847,4.4935064935064934
8442046,5,B004UR1RBU,Bought this for a Christmas present and they loved it.  Good family entertainment.  A wonderfully enjoyable movie.  Thats all I can say.,1332979200,,136,5.090909090909091
