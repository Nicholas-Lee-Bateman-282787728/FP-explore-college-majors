773897,1,6304071892,"I have been looking forward to seeing this excellent and under rated film released on DVD and was quite excited when it was finally announced.  Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the DVD is only 161 minutes long.  My VHS version is 188 minutes long.  That is a difference of 27 minutes.  I would gladly have paid more money for a two disc set containing the entire film, but I certainly will not buy this version.  What was MGM thinking?  Did they think no one would notice the missing half hour?  I just thought everyone should know they are not getting the entire movie when buying this disc.",1105833600,140,608,4.522935779816514
773898,5,6304071892,"George Roy Hill's ""Hawaii"" (actually,like ""Gone With The Wind"", it was completed by several directors)is a splendid example of Hollywood epic narrative at its best. That it is so much less well known than the rather soggy ""Dr. Zhivago"", done the previous year, is incomprehensible, except perhaps as a testament to the truth of P.T. Barnum's famous comment about American popular taste. This comparison is particularly apt, because ""Hawaii"" has a great deal more to say about American verve and energy -- both its laudable desire to improve the world, and its darker tendency to dominate it -- than the David Lean film has to tell us about the Russian Revolution. Max von Sydow is nothing short of transcendent as Reverend Abner Hale, who has to rank as the least likable or approachable hero ever to inhabit the center of an American epic film. (Scarlett O'Hara, with her husband-stealing and attempted fornication, was a piker next to a man who denies spiritual comfort to a sailor who just saved a ship from wrecking,and who prays for the death of a new-born baby because it was ""conceived in sin"".)Sydow accomplishes something almost impossible, something that Nathaniel Hawthorne,that great poet of the Puritan tradition, would have understood perfectly: showing how a narrow, humorless man, motivated by pure righteousness,can do great harm AND great good at the same time. The fervor that leads Hale to cruelly demand the end of the incestuous -- and utterly loving -- marriage of Malama and Keoki Kanakoa is the SAME force that leads him to teach the Hawaiian people to read, to save unwanted babies from being put to death,and to protect the rights of the Hawaiian people to their lands.(How the devil did the Academy miss this performance when selecting the Best Actor nominees for 1966?)I might add that this is a lesson in the complexity of cultural imperialism which is especially needed right now, when the U.S. is preparing to remake the world in its image by force with an intensity that might have given even those New England mission folk pause.
  The rest of the cast is equally superb. Julie Andrews, as Hale's wife Jerusha, manages to convey the strength of a woman who finds the loving qualities in a man who seems to lack them with a sweet sincerity that has no whiff of feminism-avant-la-lettre about it. Jocelyne La Garde as the Alii Nui (Queen)of Maui, Malama, is so lovable that you FEEL her eventual death as you would that of a dear friend. Even the smaller parts, such as Torin Thatcher as the mission director and Gene Hackman as the courageous, humanistic missionary John Whipple, are memorable.
  This film also has some really lovely images and line readings in it. The sight of Mrs. Hale's worn face as she looks wordlessly down the country road after her son as he leaves for Hawaii, knowing that she will never see him again,is like an Andrew Wyeth painting. The transition of looks on Sydow's face at the end, when he meets the adult man whom Jerusha saved from death as a baby -- calling her to come out of the house, and then gradually remembering, through his mental fog, that the beloved wife he is calling has been dead for years -- is like a miniature recapitulation of the entire story we have just seen. But my favorite moment is the one where the mission representative asks Hale how he can bear to stay on as an old man in Lahaina ""without friends"".Sydow looks at him, with the ageless wisdom of an Old Testament prophet,and says: ""In this place I have known God, and Jerusha Bromley,and Ruth Malama Kanakoa; and beyond that a man has no need of friends."" Anyone who can stay dry-eyed through that line is made of sterner stuff than I.
  A treasure of a film , not to be missed.",1048377600,28,3726,4.724615384615385
773899,5,6304071892,"""Hawaii"" is a sprawling and episodic retelling of the mammoth book by James Michener.  It is the story of the early Congregationalist missionaries to the Hawaiian islands.  It is a story of fundamentalist intolerance, greed, abuse of power, yet is also a story of love, mercy and forgiveness.  The beginning of the film is a bit uneven, but once the ship reaches the islands, all's well with the movie.  Jocelyn LaGarde as the Malama, the Hawaiian matriarch is the cast standout.  She is natural, funny and heartbreaking.  I would count this film as one of the great religious movies of all time, since it deals with true dilemmas of faith:  how religious faith can foster intolerance and contempt of others, and how missionaries must first accept their people as people, and not see them as potential converts.  The last scene with the student and Max Von Sydow is a tear-jerker, and a great example of God's providential nature at work.  The score by Elmer Bernstein is memorable as well.",1017964800,22,990,4.810650887573964

773901,5,6304071892,"One needs to transcend stereotypical mindsets to appreciate fully the depth and the brilliance of this movie. Events in the movie have unexpected finishes, not overly dramatized, with no particular story line (the randomness of real life), and consistently so. All the actors including Julie Andrews look very natural with none of that big star poise and charm and this further adds an aura of reality to the movie. I am not surprised this was not a big hit in Hollywood. But those who can appreaciate this movie will surely find it unique.",972864000,15,540,4.817204301075269
773902,5,6304071892,"Even though the 50's had its share of big-budgeted, all-star cast productions (""The Ten Commandments,"" ""Giant,"" and ""Around the World in 80  Days,"" to cite just three), it was not until the 1960's that Hollywood  brought out its ""big guns"" to do battle with that fledging upstart,  television.  The decade had its share of hits (""Ben-Hur,"" ""The Longest  Day,"" ""How the West Was Won"" and ""Spartacus""), monumental financial  disasters (""Cleopatra"" ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and ""The Great Race""),  Biblical opuses (""King of Kings"" and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told""), and  outlandishly weird productions (""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and  ""Casino Royale"").
""Hawaii"" is one of the last of these and remains one of  the best.  The film boasts great performances from Max Von Sydow as  overzealous Rev. Abner Hale who is obsessed with transforming the  ""heathens"" of the islands to Christianity.  So determined is he in his  efforts that he arrogantly condemns the lifestyle that had been in  existence for hundreds of years in the area.
Julie Andrews is wonderfully  strong as Sydow's wife Jerusha.  Although there are times when her  subservience to her mate is a little too much to take, there are moments of  strength her character shows when confronting her spouse about his actions.
Manu Tupou is brilliant as Keoki, a native Hawaiian torn between his  desire for Christian priesthood and his faithfulness to the customs of his  people.
Richard Harris, although briefly utilized in the effort, is good  as Rafer Hoxworth, Jerusha's former love, who still carries a strong torch  for Mrs. Hale.
Rising stars Gene Hackman and Carroll O'Conner round out  the great cast.
The real acting ""find"" is Jocelyne LaGarde, a first-time  performer who shines in her role of Queen Malama.  Whenever she is on  screen, her imposing physical presence is balanced by her very emotive face  and vocal intonation.  A deserving Academy Award nomination was given to  the actress.
Elmer Bernstein composed a score befitting the expanse of  the story and the grandeur of the islands.
The film does have its  drawbacks.  Both Von Sydow and Andrews are significantly older than their  characters' ages at the start of the film.  The then-acceptable showing of  the bare breasts of non-white females shows how prejudicial Hollywood was  at the time.
However, the overall production shows how ""primitive""  peoples of the world have fallen as a result of the ""advancement"" of  Christianity.  The movie may have glossed over the subject in a way that  only Hollywood could, but it still is a rousing good entertainment.",966124800,12,2595,5.066508313539193
773903,5,6304071892,"I read & watch everything I can find on Hawaii, and I love this movie.  Missionary  Abner's mistaken Christian zeal contrasts with the true Christianity of his wife Jerusha (Julie Andrews) as they to minister to the  Hawaiians.  The movie fails however to bring out the fact that the  missionaries brought much good to Hawaii, & they helped bring order to  a place that was being exploited by whalers, sailors, and other visitors of  the early 1800's.  The other early Hawaiian vistors traded ships &  merchandise to the chiefs for huge amounts of sandalwood which they ordered  the farmers to collect, & the farmers then couldn't grow taro, or fish  for food, & began to suffer from hunger as well as disease brought by  their guests.  These early visitors observed none of the Hawaiian taboos,  which devastated the Hawaiian concept of their own gods & left them  rudderless.  The missionaries were the one element that consciously tried  to bring good to the Hawaiians, even if they made mistakes.  Anyone  interested in Hawaii or the history of Hawaii should see this movie, but be  aware of its shortcomings.  I still love it for the music, scenery, and  because I so appreciate the character of Jerusha, played by Julie Andrews.  I still give it 5 stars.",943315200,18,1260,4.785046728971962

Rarely does there come a movie that blesses my heart and soul the way Hawaii does. It's one of those movies that tugs at your heartstrings because the characters feel so real and painfully human and even if you are able to foresee (without having read the plot beforehand) it will not end well for some of them, you keep hoping that maybe somehow it will.

The story is about Abner Hale, a young Protestant missionary  who journeys to Hawaii with his wife Jerusha to spread the gospel. Abner means well but is too hung up on hell and damnation and the Old Testament smiting with very little emphasis on the love of Jesus.

He manages to convert the Hawaiian king and queen and persuade them to separate since they are brother and sister because incest is considered a deadly sin in Christianity although an acceptable custom in Hawaiian royalty. But when the queen dies, the king goes back to the old traditions and performs a marriage ceremony for the prince and princess.

Abner is furious and calls on God to smite them for their backsliding. Little does he know he will regret his angry words for the rest of his life for a measles epidemic sweeps through the island decimating the tribe. He goes to the shore where hundreds of people are bathing in the water trying to cool their blazing temperatures and desperately tries to win the prince back to Christ but the prince will not listen.

""I have failed these people."" he tells Jerusha.

But Jerusha says she cannot believe God would send such kind and loving people as the Hawaiians to hell just because they do not see eye to eye with Abner.

""They are not rejecting God, Abner. They are rejecting your ARROGANCE, your LACK OF LOVE. You have given them the word of God but what you haven't given them is your HEART.""

Abner realizes his wife is a true saint while he has merely been a 'clanging cymbal' and a person does not always have to be scholar in order to share God's word, as long as he has the right attitude.

When his superior in the church inspects his work he sees Abner is exhausted and advises him to return to America. But Abner says he is firmly convinced God wants him to stay in Hawaii because through the hardships, he has gained a deeper understanding of what it truly means to be a Christian.

Max von Sydow completely melts into the character of Abner Hale. He pulls off his quirkiness and eccentricities and goes through all the transformations from eager idealistic student to condescending pharisee to humbled penitent in a thoroughly believable manner.

Julie Andrews takes a role that could have been an easy throwaway (the 'faithful little housewife' cliche) and simply lights up the screen with her ethereal voice and inner spiritual beauty. There are scenes that call for big chops such as the cabin where she is suffering from seasickness and the straw hut where she is giving birth but there are also quiet, subtle shades peppered throughout where she doesn't have to do or say much--a simple gesture here and there is enough. The profound look on her face and low resonant tone of her voice when she hears the news of her sister's death ""This letter is dated six months. For six months I've thought of her as living."" How she tries to stifle her tears by cuddling her baby. ""Don't cry little girl. Please don't cry."" The way she gently rebuttals her husband on the subject of perfume in the cabin. The solemn way she tells the prince ""Ordained minister or not, I shall always be your sister Jerusha."" Such a warm, sincere and heartfelt performance and even more incredible when you consider what came after the musicals.

Richard Harris' Captain Rafer Hoxworth is rather underwritten but it is still fascinating to see what he does within the limitations of his role because of his vibrant charisma and dominant masculine presence. He makes Rafer likable in his obvious joy for life yet unlikeable at the same time because of his arrogant, hedonistic nature and manages to convey that both lust and love are operative in his feelings for Jerusha. Deep down, he cares about her a lot; he is just a very worldly man who doesnt have an orthodox way of showing it--such as when he warns her Abner will kill her with hard living in a third world country and the scene towards the end where he barks out an order for Abner to evacuate the hut and give her a decent home. Rafer may be fun to have a short fling with but in the long run Jerusha is better off with Abner and can give herself the satisfaction in knowing she made the right choice.

Jocelyn LaGarde plays Queen Malama as a gentle giant with a heart of gold who isn't afraid to tell it like it is and defend her brood when necessary. Her saucy sense of humor is absolutely contagious. We get to work NOW! Too much law make people angry. and her relationship with Julie Andrews is very beautiful and touching.

Like William Wyler in Ben-Hur, director George Roy Hill handles the quiet and personal aspects of the film with skill and sensitivity so it is not just bloat or empty spectacle but truly beautiful images and complex characterizations.

Russell Harlans (cinematographer) powerful images simply leap out of the screen with bright vivid colors--the opening shots of the island and ocean, Queen Malama floating gently down to the ship on a stretcher, the storm on the day of her death, Prince Kelolo kneeling before the sacred volcanic rock, mourning for her--how can one forget them?

Elmer Bernsteins score is lush and dramatic at the right moments and mixes exotic elements with Neo-Classical writing for orchestra--a perfect representation of the clash of Hawaiian and American cultures not unlike Maurice Jarres combination of Middle eastern instruments and English fanfares in Lawrence of Arabia.

Overall, Hawaii is an overwhelming emotional experience that will help you appreciate the value of personal relationships and question the meaning of true spirituality.",1475107200,,6330,4.821955719557195

This is Julie Andrews when she was young and gorgeous, along with the dashing Richard Harris as a naughty whaler pining over the woman he lost.  The Swedish Max von Sydow is a perfect incarnation of a well-meaning but often cantankerous religious zealot.  ""Hawaii"" was filmed on two of the Hawaiian islands so your senses are filled with the scenic splendor.  I'm not sure how many people know it, but at one time Andrews owned a ranch on the Big Island so she must have been taken with the islands as well.  The movie has been re-tinted - good for preservation.  But, then, it's hard to mess up the colors of these wondrous islands.  A must-see for anybody who likes romance, adventure, and nature.

775097,4,6304071892,"I was 14 years old in 1966 and worked as an usher at the Kenwood Theater in Cincinnati, Ohio when this movie played for months.  Those were the days when people had assigned seats and ushers with their flashlights actually showed people to their seats.  And acourse there was an intermission.  This movie was absolutely beautiful on the huge widescreen theaters of those days not to mention state of the art sound systems.  Seeing this movie had a great impact on my attitude towards religion and life in general.

When I finally joined Netflix a few years ago and rented this dvd, I was perplexed that something was missing but couldn't figure out what.  It had been 44 years since I had seen it over and over.  Thought my memory was messed up and it never enterred my mind that they would cut out a good chunk of movie.  I mean why would you do that?  Makes absolutely no sense.  Imagine if they did the same to 2001 Space Odyssey, my favorite movie of all time.  I believe that was also by MGM as is Hawaii?

I will still give movie 4 stars with hope maybe the criterion people will get rights to do a bluray full version of it before too much more time passes.  In meantime, I will refuse to buy this expensive abbreviated version.  Still can't figure out what segments were cut.  Just know something very important was.  Have to check ebay for vhs two tape full version?  Pretty sad that such a classic movie of all times could be treated so poorly.

775240,5,6304071892,"This is a magnificent, beautiful, powerful and very, very clever and yet surprisingly nowadays mostly forgotten film. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

The cinema in the 60s is famous amongst other for spectacular super productions, very long sagas made with generous budgets and prestigious castings, betting on becoming a phenomenon to bring profit. There were some such films earlier, like ""Gone with the wind"" and ""Ten commandments"", but not many. It was only in the 60s that they appeared in large numbers, following the sensational success of ""Ben Hur"" in 1959 and to a lesser extent that of ""Spartacus"" in 1960.

Following those two precursors appeared ""El Cid"", ""The longest day"", ""Cleopatra"", ""The fall of the Roman Empire"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Docteur Zhivago"", ""The sound of music"", ""How the West was won"", ""The sand pebbles"", ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""Patton"", ""My Fair Lady"", ""The greatest story ever told"", ""The Bible: in the beginning"", ""The guns of Navarone"" - and also, last but definitely not least, ""Hawaii"".

Released in 1966 ""Hawaii"" was a great success - it ended n2 at box office in USA this year, just behind ""The Bible: in the beginning"" and beating films like ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", ""Sand pebbles"" and ""A man for all seasons"".

As other super productions from the 60s ""Hawaii"" was a long film - it lasted 189 minutes! Sadly, for reasons which I don't understand fully, all DVD releases available are, at 162 minutes, seriously edited, with many important scenes cut off. But even in its edited form this film is still EXCELLENT and IMPRESSIVE!

""Hawaii"" is the adaptation of just one chapter from the novel ""Hawaii"" by the great specialist of historic mega novels, James Michener. The book, written in 1959, was itself a bestseller and the expectations of the public for ,the big screen adaptation were high. The producers and the director did their best to not disappoint them. At 15 million dollars the budget was, for this time, very generous. The screenplay was written by the renowned, although controversial, Dalton Trumbo - for the music, Elmer Bernstein was hired.

The greatest star hired for this film was Julie Andrews, who after ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The sound of music"", was in this time the most popular (and the most expensive) Hollywood actress. To play Reverend Abner Hale, the main male character, Swedish actor Max von Sydow was chosen - and although he was definitely not one of major stars in Hollywood, it is clear from the beginning that he was simply BORN to play this role (see below).

This film was THE BIG BREAK for Richard Harris who was immediately after offered the role of King Arthur in ""Camelot"", and even more for Gene Hackman, for whom it was only the third role ever - next year he played in no less than five films, including ""Bonnie and Clyde""...

""Hawaii"" tells the story of American Calvinist missionaries arrival and work in Hawaii islands, beginning in 1819, until their death or recall home. Only married men are accepted as missionaries, therefore all of them bring also their wives with them - even if the voyage on board of relatively small sail ship is a horrible ordeal (it is necessary to sail around Cape Horn). Amongst those missionaries there is one doctor, John Whipple (Gene Hackman) and especially one particularly fervent preacher, Reverend Abner Hale (Max von Sydow). Reverend Hale was never very much inclined towards marriage or even woman company, but had to marry in order to become a missionary. The girl he married, former Jerusha Bromley (Julie Andrews) married him by convenience, not from love - indeed it is rather hard to imagine any woman falling in love with Reverend Hale, even if he is not half bad looking...

Reverend Hale and his wife are central characters and in fact ""Hawaii"" is in large part the story of their long but uneasy marriage, even if of course there is A LOT of other things in this film. I will say no more here about this aspect of the movie.

Jerusha Hale is a character very easy to like and it is understandable why even her husband ultimately falls in love with her. As for the Reverend Abner Hale himself - well, that is a whole different enchilada...

The greatness of this film resides in fact in the extraordinary complexity of this very peculiar and controversial character. There is no question that the fundamental characteristic of Abner Hale are his aggressive fanaticism, enormous pride and an ever boiling unlimited supply of indignation, anger and holy rage. This is a man so completely and sincerely devoted to study the Bible and so utterly committed to what he considers his holy mission that he is really ashamed when he realises that he has human feelings - and he actually considers them as a WEAKNESS! He also is deeply racist, as were most of white people in XIX century and even if he is sincerely fond of native Hawaiians, he nevertheless considers them intrinsically inferior to the whites. This guy is in fact so insufferable, that all during this long film I felt on a regular basis a strong need to go and hit him on the head with his Bible and then feed him to my chipmunks...

And yet he also has many qualities. The man is completely sincere - he believes what he says and he says what he believes. He attaches no importance to material possessions and is completely honest. Notwithstanding his prejudices, he actually REALLY tries to help the Hawaiians not only by converting them but also by defending them - with no small courage - against the land grabbing colons and abusive sailors. And in many of the fights he wages aggressively from the beginning against some local customs, he is simply DARN RIGHT! And finally, one cannot refuse him courage and a complete disregard for his own safety - a fanatic he definitely is, but a really courageous one, never backing away from a fight he considers just, no matter how bad the odds against him.

In a lesser film - and especially a more modern one, considering how much Hollywood hates Christianity - this character would be made into the main villain of the film. Here however things are much, much more complicated - and towards the second half of the film the story actually is more and more about the fight for Reverend Hale's soul, between his very dark passenger and his more luminous side.

OK, sorry, SPOILER here. The last scene of this film completes this long epic is a way so perfect and beautiful, that I really had tears in my eyes. Because in this scene Reverend Hale receives for the first time in his life a direct message from God. A message in which Lord tells him that notwithstanding all his terrible sins and errors, and all the disastrous defeats and losses he suffered, his works were NOT for naught. A message which tells him also that even if he greatly saddened and horribly insulted the Almighty by some things in his life, by many others, some of which he doesn't even remember well any more, he saved himself - and therefore God doesn't reject him. BUT to correctly understand and appreciate this wonderful ending you HAVE TO watch the whole film with great attention to the details!

There are also many other treasures in this film, including an absolutely hilarious discussion about the 23 kinds of adultery the native Hawaiians distinguished, but you will have to discover them yourself.

Bottom line, this is a WONDERFUL, beautiful, complex and intelligent film, to buy and watch ABSOLUTELY! Enjoy!",1382313600,2,7461,4.790046656298601

Being a loyal and faithful wife, she abandons her dreams of marrying the sailor and follows her husband's dreams of leading the heathens to salvation. Unfortunately for her, he is a very ignorant religious man who alienates everyone in his path. She tries very hard to be a good wife to such a man, but it is difficult.

The beginning tells about Hawaiian culture and its people. Their people fled to a new land bcause of many deaths among their people. They lived isolated until Captain Cook arrived in the late 18th century. Then others arrived to bring goods, religion, and disease, or to take their lands. Missionaries are recruited in New England to go to Hawaii and convert their people. [They must forsake their heathen practices.] The Reverend Hale is selected but must take a wife. [The scenes recreate early 19th century life.] They show the passage on a small sailing ship, the passengers suffer from sea-sickness. [Is this really funny?] There is a perilous passage through the Straits of Magellan. Sea water pours through an open hatch. [Did sailors wear shoes when they worked the sails?] Will prayers help? Yes.

The ship arrives in the calm waters of Hawaii. The natives paddle out to see them. We see cultural differences. Aloha! First the Queen wants to learn writing, then about their religion. Polygamy, polyandry, and incest? Reverend Hale disregards local customs. Inbreeding? The Hales will live in a grass hut. [Ecologically sound.] They find a surprise gift there! Will a child be killed because of a birthmark? Do foreigners want their land? Hale wants to build a church. Time passes. A ship approaches, women swim out to meet the lonely sailors. Reverend Hale arrives to retrieve his servant and rescue another from the whalers. Mrs. Hale meets an old friend. Rev. Hale asks for new laws against the 23 kinds of adultery practiced in Hawaii! [No problems with jealousy?] Mrs. Hale goes into labor. The native midwives have medicines but Mr. Hale rejects their practices. He has read a book and know what to do. Its a boy.

The years pass, Hale baptizes converts. The Queen promulgates new laws that must be obeyed. [No mention of the punishments.] Trouble results when sailors come ashore at days end. Will Hales church be in danger? What can be done? The sailors return to their ships. [Is Hale hot in that suit?] Time passes, there are changes. Hewlett is condemned for marrying a Hawaiian, but he is content with his choice. Christians must follow the Scriptures. Can a Hawaiian be ordained? A deacon will spy upon his people. The Queen is dying. [A problem with overweight?] She is baptized Ruth. A high wind arises as she passes away. Hales church is blown away. [Symbolism?] There is a song and dance for a traditional ceremony. Hale objects, to no avail. Will there be a punishment from God? Other settlers profit from handling merchandise [no risks there].

Measles broke out on shore, it will kill many and cripple the survivors. Those affected bathe in the surf to cool off but this will kill them. More than half of the Hawaiian people were killed off by diseases brought by visitors on ships. Mrs. Hale makes a speech [it seems out of character]. What can the Rev. Hale do now? We learn what happened to her. The sugar planters are taking over the lands of Hawaii. [The people are turned into serfs.] Will the religious ministers become exploiters too? Will Hale return to Boston and another church? His children will see their grandparents. Will Hale in his old age get help from a new visitor for his new work? One scene tells how Kanakas (young men) were taken away to provide sailors on long sea voyages. This also affected the Hawaiians adversely, just like turning young women into paid companions for lonely sailors.

Pretty sad story but true to history and one that could not be told today at this grand scale because of religious and nationalistic sensitivities. I think the film works well if one allows for the acting to be dated and it is historically important because it tells a historically important story and with a bit of theatricality it is blunt in a way that could not be done today by a major studio. Well worth seeing by any thinking person who enjoys films. If you are religious and are not familiar with the fact that too many missionaries have been fanatical, then you will find this disturbing.

There is a bit of love story in it, but this does not carry the film and seems almost thrown in -- but it does contribute to the characters and their situation. The photography is good. The music was not to my tastes. The ""making of"" was really old fashioned and low octane.

See it for a bit of important history. Then what is not in the film is that next the missionaries and their families developed an economy on the Islands and became wealthy and eventually got the US to take over the Islands as a territory and eventually of course a state.

775536,5,6304071892,"Never underestimate the power of VHS. Nor the stupidity of MGM DVD's packaging decisions-- for instance: making classic widescreen musicals like ""West Side Story"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" available only in full-screen versions, and releasing on DVD not the uncut roadshow version, but the horribly edited short version of the 1966 near-masterpiece ""Hawaii."" My estimation of ""Hawaii"" as a masterpiece might seem like a bit of an overreaction, but I recently watched the full version again on videotape and it was so magnificent and so touching I was immediately swept away. This-- offered in this particular edition as a widescreen video from 1996 with the full 189-minute release-- is the movie I fell in love with years ago (though it was in full-screen then). Julie Andrews gives her most believable performance as the sweet, all-embracing, life-affirming wife of gritty, awkward, judgmental, hypocritical Reverend Abner Hale, in this full-blown epic classic adapted from the most cinematic of the gargantuan mini-sagas in James Michener's book. The fact that it's only based on part of the book is null. The novel stands exceptional on its own merits, but they certainly chose the right part to film, just as Elia Kazan did with ""East of Eden."" Visually, no film set in the tropics is so beautiful. Musically, the film is perfect. Elmer Bernstein wrote what is, in my opinion, #2 on the list of the Greatest Film Scores of All Time. It'll move you to tears. The problem with the edited version is, of course, that it lacks so many of the film's finest moments-- including Julie Andrews' best scene, her most emotionally intense (with the exception of that heart-rending childbirth scene, better than even the one in ""Gone With the Wind""), when she stands up to Abner on the boat as they approach Hawaii. Without that scene in particular, her performance has no real emotional depth and it's hard to believe she belongs in a foreign land with such a repulsive husband. Thereby one short scene makes the difference between her character being the dutiful wife and the independent, fully rounded woman. Shame on MGM for its DVDs, but it's got a great track record with VHS. With my discovery of a letterbox version of the full movie on video, I realize there's no excuse not to immediately reissue ""Hawaii"" on DVD and possibly even Blu-ray in its complete form, as it was meant to be seen.",1300579200,14,2395,4.916049382716049

775599,4,6304071892,"I'll admit, the first time I watched HAWAII was around fifteen years ago (on videotape), and I found the whole thing a crashing bore.  When the DVD recently came my way at a very reasonable price, I decided to give it another try.  After all, it stars Julie Andrews, and was the highest-grossing movie of 1966.

I greatly enjoyed revisiting the drama and spectacle of HAWAII, and I'm so glad that I decided to persevere with it again.  Fifteen years ago and today, the drawcard for me remains Julie Andrews, and she's a radiant presence playing Jerusha Bromley, the wife of fanatical young minister Abner Hale (Max von Sydow).

With the best of intentions, Abner decides to travel to the Hawaiian islands in a bid to introduce Christianity to it's people, but also brings confusion, conflict, disease and death.  Throughout most of the movie, Abner is a most unsympathetic character.  He's selfish, sometimes quite cruel, unwilling to even consider the traditions, help or advice of the native Hawaiians; and, quite sadly, ignorant to his wife Jerusha's crumbling physical and emotional condition on the island.  When Jerusha's old flame Captain Rafer Hoxworth (Richard Harris) suddenly reappears, it sets the stage for a stormy battle between the island natives and the sailors who ""court"" the girls after dark.  Abner also condemns reigning monarch Malama Kanakoa (Jocelyne LaGarde) for carrying on an incestuous marriage with her brother.  Kanakoa is a benevolent ruler and wishes to learn Western ways, however her native beliefs are something she'll never sacrifice.  The tug-of-war between the natives, and Abner's dogmatic system of forcing Christianity onto them, is the core of the entire saga.

HAWAII does pack quite an emotional punch, with plenty of action and ceremony with the island community; plus one of the most harrowing birth scenes ever committed to film (Julie Andrews plays it very realistically).  Paul Tassone's earlier review points out the various trims made in this version of the film - I too would love to see the complete Road Show version one day, as I'm sure Julie Andrews' impact as Jerusha would be an even bigger asset to the overall story.  Additionally, watching Richard Harris and Julie Andrews in their scenes together makes me wish that Andrews had reprised her Guenevere opposite Richard Harris in the screen version of ""Camelot"" (released the following year)--they do share quite a magic here in HAWAII.

Anyway, as for this version, I found it awfully slow and one-dimensional.  We see the poor minister, wonderfully played by Max von Sydow, doing his narrow-minded, judgemental thing over and over and over, to the point where I really didn't want to watch it anymore and turned it off.  The next day, when I had some time to kill I returned to it and found that it did become more interesting.  Then, right before the end, the minister has  change of heart and turns out to be a loving guy, after all.  A case of ""too little, too late"" for me.  If more had been shown of the man's inner conflicts as the film went along, it would have been much more believable and interesting.  However at the time it was made, people still believed in black and white, good and bad so this was how the story was presented.

I think that the film did make some effort in showing the positive effects of Christianity instead of showing only the dark, condemnatory side.  The missionaries did keep the happy natives from killing the deformed babies.  I can't really complain that they made an effort to stop incest, either.

Von Sydow did a wonderful job given the character he had to play and his ending scenes were really marvelous.  Julie Andrews was adequate as his wife although she certainly didn't burn up the screen with either her personality or her beauty.  It was hard for me to imagine the handsome, squashbuckling whaling captain played magnificently by Richard Harris, pining away for this pale flower.

The supporting characters were all very good, especially the woman who played the native queen.

As epics go, this is one that didn't age well in my opinion.  However it is colorful and gives some interesting history of the islands.",1276387200,,1966,4.6138328530259365

Max Von Sydow is very good in his part as her husband, Abner Hale, the stiff Calvinist missionary you love to hate but who by the end of the film does exhibit some change for the better.  Richard Harris is certainly handsome in his tight white trousers as Rafer the whaling captain and Jerusha's first love but his acting seems at times unbearably smug and is one of the few shortcomings of the movie.

Gene Hackman and Carroll O'Connor are in the cast and both quite good in supporting parts.

The scenery and music of HAWAII are breathtaking.  The plot is exciting and the 19th century historical setting is fascinating and seemingly reasonably accurate.

Keoki, a native Hawaiian and first convert to the Christian faith has traveled across the ocean to America in hopes of convincing some of the upcoming graduates of a Christian seminary in New England to sail to Hawaii and share their faith with his people.

Amongst those to accept the challenge is Abner Hale (Max Von Sydow) a young man of good intentions, but overzealous and prideful in his Christianity. Unable to join in the missionary effort unless he is married, one is arranged for him with the lovely Jerusha Bromley (Julie Andrews).

The hardships of the sea voyage are only a taste of the hardship that face them once they arrive at their destination. As the new arrivals acclimate themselves to their new surroundings Jerusha soon falls in love with the open and loving nature to the natives while Abner grows more narrow and unbending in his proselytization efforts. Unable to appreciate the beauty around him, he sees only heathens doomed to hell for their pagan ways.

Abner eventually loses sight of the Christian message to ""love one another"" and in a fit of range calls upon God to bring death and destruction to the unrepentant Hawaiians. When a measles epidemic spreads through the islands it appears Abner prayer has been answered with dire consequences.

A poignant and ultimately sad tale of the lose of yet another native 'land of paradise' brought about the greed and lack of concern by foreign powers.

Being an Andrews fan attracted me to the movie, but watching it made me a fan of the movie. Von Syddow plays a rather annoying reverend that doesnt quite understand the true meaning of faith and love.

775801,4,6304071892,"In the mid 1960's, Julie Andrews was the biggest movie star the world.  Her success came on the strength of two block busters, 1964's ""Mary Poppins"" and 1965's ""The Sound Of Music"", the two films for which she will be forever identified.  However, her body of film work in the 1960's, though only 7 films in all is impressive in it's scope and content.  Of these films, one of the best and most successful was the epic ""Hawaii"".

The film tells the story of a zealous but misguided missionary, Abner Hale (Max von Sydow) and his loving, forthright wife Jerusha (Julie Andrews) who try to bring Christianity to the native Hawaiians.  Both von Sydow and Andrews give magnificent performances, bringing humanity to two characters that could have been cardboard, stock figures in less talented hands.  Indeed, these two characterisations work well because of each other with the unsympathetic Hale coming off as human after all due to being loved by his wife.  Together, von Sydow and Andrews make an impressive team.  The cast is rounded out beautifully by a raft of excellent players including Richard Harris, Gene Hackman, Carol O'Connor and even Bette Midler in her first film as an extra on the ship headed for Hawaii.

When the film was originally released, it was as a 189 minute roadshow production with overture, intermission, entr'acte and exit music.  The film was later presented in an edited, 161 minute version.  It is this version that has been released on DVD.  This begs the question, what's missing from the DVD version?

At 0:35:26 On the voyage to Hawaii, Hale makes a convert in the crew
At 0:35:44 The Captain charts the course and large bunches of bananas are brought on board
At 0:37:30 Hale force feeds a seasick Jerusha bananas
At 0:38:30 Hale condemns the convert he made among the crew because of drunkenness
At 0:39:21 The Captain requests Hale's prayers prior to sailing through the Evangels
At 0:46:05 The Captain throws his novels overboard (his part of a deal with Hale for praying in the ship's behalf) followed by Jerusha throwing the bananas overboard
At 1:16:12 Sister Hewlett dies after giving birth
At 1:17:57 Hale assures Jerusha that he can deliver her baby and that she will not die in childbirth
At 1:52:50 Hale recovers in bed after a shark bite and Jerusha tells him that a wife needs to be loved not worshipped (final scene in the first half of the roadshow version)

There are also some trimmed scenes in the first half such as the farewell scene prior to Hale and Jerusha leaving for Hawaii as well as the elimination of the entr'acte.

It is Julie Andrews' Jerusha that suffers most at the hands of the editor.  Some of her most powerful acting (the force feeding scene and her subsequent reaction to this in throwing the bananas overboard and calling her husband a bully, and again when she walks out on her husband's sermon when he condemns the incestuous marriage of the new Queen, for example) was removed.  The result of this it to make one of Julie's most absorbing characterisation seem less moving and less three dimensional.  In the full version, Jerusha is a devoted wife but is also capable of standing up to her husband and asserting her own personality and beliefs.  The shorter version presents less of this side of her character and leaves Jerusha as a submissive wife with a bully of a husband.  However, Julie Andrews is incapable of a bad or uncommitted performance and even in the edited version is at the top of her game matching von Sydow's Hale (a more flashy character) every step of the way.

Here's hoping that M-G-M will eventually release a fully restored DVD of the roadshow version to show what a fine film this really is and let us see the complete performances of two great actors, Andrews and von Sydow.

My recommendation: it's worth a look in its edited form but would have been better is presented complete.",1121385600,248,4258,4.737127371273712
775802,2,6304071892,"As with the other reviews I have read on this DVD version, what a disappointment seeing this film has been.  Waiting for years for the DVD to come out and it has lost almost 30 minutes.  Missing are the Overture, Entracte and Exit Music but a very crucial confession given by Abner to Jerusha that ends Act 1. It is very unfortunate that I will have to keep the VHS tape which contains the original Widescreen version of the film.

Please write to MGM and telll them how diappointed fans of this film are and encourage them to release a Special Edition of this wonderful film.  I am a little worried how they will cut the soon to be released titles-Grand Prix and Ryan's Daughter.  Just keep your fingers crossed that wiser minds will prevail other than those who chose to release this poor version of a great Film.",1120608000,23,815,4.442953020134228

The only reason I didn't give up was because of how much I enjoyed the Michener book.  Max Von Sydow was a disaster as Reverend Abner Hale, as was Richard Harris in the role of Captain Hoxworth.  They're both great actors and I've liked them very much in other roles.  But these guys ruined ""Hawaii"".

Additionally, it contains the original stereo soundtrack which accentuates the Elmer Bernstein score, one of his best.

Even minus the Overture, Intermission, and Exit musics. . .there have to be extreme edits in this version.  I could argue that the mere fact that this fine film is finally available on DVD--is a plus argument--but with severe edits--it simply is not worth a buy.  Hopefully a full version of this epic might finally be made available under the new owners of MGM.

775807,5,6304071892,"The DVD of George Roy Hill's ""Hawaii"" is long overdue. It tackles a subject that has always bothered me; that the good, well-intentioned fundamentalist Christians would invade native territory. Those simple natives never died of anything but age until the white man invaded their simple territory. The DVD is fine, with rich colors brought out of the magnificent panoramas (quite washed out on the VHS). An informative extra is about the making of the film, and you can compare the color restoration. That, and the theatrical trailer, are the only extras. A wonderful widescreen transfer gives justice to Russell Harlan's cinematography. ""Hawaii"" was nominated for 7 Oscars, and definitely should've won for Elmer Bernstein's great score. Cinematography, too (since it lost to ""A Man For All Seasons"", which was really just a filmed play.) Interesting was the nomination of Jocelyn Lagarde as Malama; she was certainly a strong character, and was quite good; she learned the whole script phonetically, since she knew no English. The acting was very good. Max von Sydow, fresh off his performance as Jesus in ""The Greatest Story Ever Told""was solid. Julie Andrews was best of all, really carrying this film. Everyone forgets that her first film was ""The Americanization of Emily"", and it's later that she gave the candy-coated performances for which she's best known. She is really a stabilizing factor in the goings-on, and her discovery of this new, magic land is much more profound. There's a wonderful insight here, much overlooked. She also gets a very brief moment to sing, but the song is only minimally presented; still, ""My Wishing Doll"" was nominated for Best Song. (I remember Jackie de Shannon singing it at the Oscars back then). I'd like to hear the whole song sometime. Heather Menzies, who played one of the von Trapp children, has a small role as her little sister. A lot of things could be cut, but overall, this is a fine film. It has power and conviction, and Mischner approved. It's interesting to note that there's a spiritual touch to the beliefs of the native Hawaiians that belies the Christian ethic. When Malama (the Ali'i nui) dies, a terrific storm happens, as predicted, though von Sydow's character thinks it's just superstition. He is regularly taken over by these people, something that Jerusha (Andrews) knew all along. It is a fine film, and one that I'm glad to have in my collection.",1113696000,2,2419,4.99009900990099
775808,3,6304071892,"I eagerly awaited the release of Hawaii on DVD - it's one of my all time favorite movies.  Like several other reviewers I was dismayed to find out it was about 30 minutes shorter then the VHS version.  I was hoping that they had just cut out the long music before the credits and the intermission, but I discovered that they cut out a number of scenes.  Most of the deleted scenes are important for the movies flow and for character development.

I'm not sure if the DVD is the original theatrical release (which I never saw) or just edited to fit on one DVD.  It's sad, but the VHS version is much better then the DVD version. If you've never seen Hawaii by all means get the DVD (it's still a great movie), but if you've ever seen the VHS version you will probably be disappointed.",1113436800,7,783,4.299319727891157

There is no excuse for this atrocity--both the laserdisc and the most recent VHS release were the uncut versions, and there is no noticeable quality difference in the elements, so MGM/UA just doesn't care.

775810,5,6304071892,"""Hawai"" is truly one of the great overlooked epic movies of the fifities and sixties, Not well released at the time it suffered appalingly because Julie Andrews' superb performance (one of her very best) was unfavourably compared to the two big ""nanny"" blockbusters that had preceeded it. SO--now the news comes that it is FINALLY to be released on DVD--but in the truncated version that was foisted on us for years until the two video set finally showed us the movie we had been missing. Surely this is the job of DVD to show the complete version (at 188 minutes) something must be done and every person who buys DVds and the Amazon management itself must complain to MGM who will rlease it on DVD that this is not acceptable to the many legion of fans of this movie who have been waiting for years for the DVD release. How difficult is it for UA  or MGM to go the print released on video some years ago and adapt that for DVD.....No other version is acceptable and

7860754,5,6304071892,"This sumptuous 1966 masterpiece, based on a novel by James Michener, pays tribute to the sacrifices made by American missionaries to Christianize 19th century Hawaii.
  Its featured theme song was later used to introduce the local CBS news on channel KGNB.I knew that tune initially in that venue before seeing this movie. Elmer Bernstein's score brilliantly and accurately captures the beauty of the tropical setting of swaying palm trees,blue ocean , and fabulous sunrises and sunsets.  The story begins with  a Yale University narration by the Prince Keoki,Manu Tupou, of Maui,who tells the Hawaiian legends interspersed with his peoples history, and problems caused by the troublesome whalers,ending with a plea for missionaries to Christianize  the islands as an antidote.  A Divinity school student named Abner Hale(, a gritty and hard nosed Max Von Sydow, fresh from playing Christ Himself in the previous year's release,The Greatest Story Ever Told,)volunteers for the mission, but we receive a foreshadowing of how his family's strict Calvanistic background will influence his treatment of those he seeks to convert.  In regards to Abner's character, one is reminded of a statement from the film, Dr. Zhivago about an equally zealous character in that story who is described as ...""The kind of man the world pretends to look up to, and in fact despises because that sort breeds unhappiness particularly in women. ""  The woman with whom he will eventually share his life is to be found in the Massachusetts city of Walpole.  The well -to -do Charles Bromley, (Carroll O' Connor) and his wife, Abigail, (Elizabeth Cole) seek a solution to the problem involving their  distaught and confused 22- year -old daughter Jerusha, (Julie Andrews,fresh from her role ad the equally religious Maria Von Trapp in The Sound of Music, )who was promised to a sea captain from whom she hasn't heared in two years. The two younger  Bromley sisters, Mercy ,(Heather Menzies, who played Andrews charge and stepdaughter in The Sound of Music), and little Charity, (Diane Sherry), join their parents in welcoming  Abner to their home to get acquainted, having been introduced by Divinity school head, Reverend Dr. Thorn (Torin Thatcher), who hides the newly arrived package of letters from the sea captain.  Abner is deeply attracted to Jerusha, but expresses his reluctance to expose  her to a level of hardships and deprivations he will face. But Jerusha is willing to accept such a life.  We are treated to Andrew's popular vocalizations only once when she performs a song called My Wishing Doll accompanied by Mercy's piano stylings.  Abner and Jerusha marry, and amid the singing of the hymn ,Blest Be the Tie That Binds,they sail for theory destination, facing a harrowing journey around the horn of South America. Even then,we see signs of how Abner's missionary zeal will be tempered by Jerusha's diplomacy and compassion for those aboard who don't always measure up to her husband's standards of Christian conduct.  In due course, they arrive on Maui at the whaling seaport city of Lahaina where despite Abner's rigid objections, Keoki jumps ship and swims over to greet his mother, Malama,(Oscar winner , Jocelene Le Garde ),who greets the missionaries warmly, admiring the Haole females she is seeing for the first time. Abner expresses apprehension when Malama insists on meeting exclusively with Jerusha only. But as a guest in someone elses country he will have to overcome his arrogance and concede to someone elses rules.  Jerusha experiences a harrowing amount of culture shock her first night there, but manages to teach Malama about writing. The hefty queen relents with her young guest when she feels she made her work too hard, and correctly guesses Jerusha is pregnant.  The Hales move into their new hut  where they find a girl named Illiki, (Lokelani S. Chicarell), who is given to them as servant. Abner vows to make her the first fruit of his ministry.  Abner begins to build a church, but finds himself at odds with locals who warn the site is unstable due to the whistling wind that blows through there when monarchs die. Abner brushes aside the advice of people who've been in that location for thousands of years.  Jerusha has a painful, distressing, and prolonged labor, during which Abner slams the hut door in Keoki's face when he tries to bring medical aid from indigenous midwives. Their son, ,Micah ,(Robert Oakley,Henrik Von Sydow, Clas Von Sydow, and Bertil Wetjfelt), is the first of their three children.
It is during Jerusha's first pregnancy that she is reunited with her former intended, Captain Rafer Hoxworth,(Richard Harris) , who is devastated by her marriage to a self- righteous missionary and warns her that their lifestyle will kill her.  Malama struggles to accept Christianity, particularly ,having to put aside her incestuous relationship with her brother Kelolo, (Ted Norbriga), and while Abner gloats when she finally relents, the pattern of Jerusha's being the heart of the mission counterbalancing Abner's frequent bullheadedness continues when she expresses empathy towards Malama's having made such a difficult choice.  Malama raises continuous objections to settlers taking over too much of the Hawaiian's land.  But at best ,the missionaries also see that laws are passed against formication,in view of the vast number of Hawaiian girls who contracted venrereal diseases from sailors, and they establish a home for unwanted children.  A member of the missionary society ousted for marrying the Hawaiian woman who tended to his  previous wife when she died in childbirth and tended to the baby. He is glad to leave, as he is self sufficient and tired of their hypocrisy.  Abner's smug refusal to ordain Keoki will have tragic results as well.  The years take their toll and the heart of the mission will be lost compelling Abner to make some poignant, life altering decisions.  Gene Hackman plays Dr. John Whipple,John Cullum plays Reverend Immanuel Quigley, Michael Constantine plays a sailor named Mason,Lou Antonio plays Reverend Abraham Hewlett, John Harding appeared as Collins,George Rose played Captain Janders,Robert Crawford Jr. played Crindland,Don Doolittle played Fredericks,Malcolm Atterbury played Gideon Hale, Dorothy Jeakins, his wife, Hebzibah, and  Honolulu native, Bette Midler plays a passenger on a ship.
