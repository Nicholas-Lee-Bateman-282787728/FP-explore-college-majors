I remember watching Robotech on TV in the 80's and it truly moved me then, and still does today!  If you haven't ordered this yet, DO IT NOW!",992476800,2,292,4.0701754385964914
1424197,5,B00005BJED,"Perfect for any anime purists.  You get 6 episodes for a very good price.  And seeing how most animes give you only 3 episodes on one disc this is a VERY good deal.  Besides, Robotech is as big a part in the lives of people who grew up in the 80's as lets Transformers, GI Joe, Thundercats and even Sabre Rider and the Star Sheriffs for that matter.
Buy this.

1424198,5,B00005BJED,"Then get the Animeigo version since it will be all in Japanese, and have subtitles (since there can be only one dubbed version of the series, and it has to be the the originally dubbed Robotech:Macross that was originally released in the early 80's.  Yes, anime has to be edited for it to be shown here in North America, and in some cases, heavily edited.  The wonderful guys at Harmony Gold and Carl Macek did their best with what they were given.  3 series, (since the one series of 36 episodes wasn't enough for North American standards for a full t.v. series they had to combine the 3 Macross, Mosapeda, and southern cross) built into one for the North American audience.  This is strictly for the buffs who enjoyed this series when it was originally released to North American audiences back in the 80's.  So, if you've never seen this series, and want to know where it all began, yes, buy the Animeigo version with the uncut violence and subtitles with no english dub.  If you want to see the edited North American version with english dubbed voices, combining all 3 series into one terrific story that's somewhat edited, get this version.  You won't be sorry either way.",992044800,6,1177,4.6298076923076925

1424200,5,B00005BJED,"Ahh, nothing like the classics. Anime that changed the way we looked at it. Star Blazers, Voltron and now the ever popular Robotech. If your not in on the story of Robotech (come on, who doesn't know Robotech is about?), here is a quick summary of the first six episodes.
Boobytrapped: In the year 1999, the SDF-1 battle fortress crashed on earth. Earth spends 10 years rebuilding it and alien invaders called the Zentradi move in to capture it. Rick Hunter, a amateur pilot, ends up being trafted into battle with his brother, Roy Fokker.
Countdown: While Rick and Roy protect the beautiful Linn Minmei while Macross island is evacuated, the SDF-1 attempts to lift off the earth as the Veritech squadron is under attack.
Space Fold: Captain Gloval orders to make a desperate hyperspace fold, but ends up sending the ship and Macross island into an area around Pluto.
The Long Wait: Rick and Linn get to know each other better when stranded in the depths of the SDF-1.
Transformation: While quarrels with his love for Minmei, the SDF-1 undergoes a transformation into a giant robot.
Blitzkreig: Rick joins the Vermillion squadron and the SDF-1 gets their chance to attack in the rings of Saturn.
The video quality is the same as the VHS tapes. Lots of little scratches and overbrightness, but it doesn't ruin the show one bit. Audio is much improved over the tapes however. The menus are pretty good but a tad hard to maneuver. The main menu starts with Exodore and Bretai watching a screen. Exodore says ""Heavy resistance, sir"" and Bretai ""Yes, but why are they using such primitve weapons"" and then up comes the main menu featuring video of the preview for episode 2 with the theme song. Someone wanna explain to me why ADV did that little piece before the main menu. Oh well, it didn't bother me that much. No extras, sorry. But just look how cheap the disc is. It's a steal. If you haven't done so, buy it now! I bought this title in a heartbeat and I haven't regreted it.",991440000,3,1976,4.6164772727272725
1424201,5,B00005BJED,"I remember watching Robotech on the SciFi channel before I went to school each morning.

It's the best!",990403200,,302,4.882352941176471

And then it arrived at my front door.  I watched the first episode.
No subtitled Japanese version... No extras... Only a dub...

1424204,5,B00005BJED,"Anime purists will want the original ""Macross"" series and clamor on and on about how infinitely greater the original was and how vile it was to commercially graft three disparate anime series into one Robotech, but let me put my money worth in with the rest of the American kids and say, ""Macross what?"" Robotech is what I grew up. I only knew its soundtrack, its fantastic storyline, and its riotous comic script(it's quite funny, at times, the same way Woody Allen's ""What's Up, Tiger Lily"" is a crackup). Do yourself a favor and watch Robotech for the fourth time(I watched it 3 repeated seasons as a kid); you'll forget how damn old you are.",994291200,,645,4.6173913043478265
1424205,5,B00005BJED,"Robotech - The Macross Saga 1: First Contact, contains the first six episodes of the legendary anime series from the mid 1980s.
For the uninitiated, Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s (along with Star Blazers, Voltron, Transor Z, etc.) Known for its cutting edge animation, thrilling battle scenes, futuristic techonology (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
Robotech's sweeping saga spanned three seasons and weaved together three actual separate storylines based on Japanese anime: The Macross Saga (Season 1), The Robotech Masters (The Southern Cross in Japan) (Season 2), and The New Generation (Mospeada in Japan) (Season 3). The basic story premise is that the earth became forever changed in 1999 when a mysterious alien battleship crashes on earth. The people of the world, now knowing that they are not alone in the universe, end all wars and unite to understand and assimilate the advanced technology and prepare for the inevitable alien invasion that is sure to come. As the story unfolds mankind would go on to battle three separate alien races over the next three seasons. The sweeping intergalactic war saga itself though, merely becomes the backdrop of a more deeper ""human"" saga.
Included on this first volume are these first six episodes:
Episode 1 - Booby Trap: Introduction to the Robotech world. In 1999 an alien battleship crashes on Earth, uniting all of mankind as one to figure out its awesome technology and to prepare itself against potential alien threats. Ten years later, the ship is renovated. Young Rick Hunter, a civilian pilot visiting his friend Roy Fokker (a commander in the earth forces) during the grand launching ceremony for the space ship becomes an unwilling fighter pilot caught right in the middle of an alien invasion!!!
Episode 2 - Countdown: During the Zentraedi invasion Capt. Gloval must contend with the fact that he and his inexperienced crew are commanding an alien vessel that they barely comprehend how to operate. Plus, Rick Hunter aimlessly tries to operate the strange transforming fighter plane he is stuck in while trying to save the beautiful young girl Minmei.
Episode 3 - Space Fold: After launching the SD-F1 to lure away the alien invaders Capt. Gloval orders a ""Space Fold"" to the moon to escape the bombardment from the Zentraedi battleships. Unknowingly, the Space Fold not only DOES NOT take them to moon, but it also winds up taking Macross Island with them - all the way out to Pluto. Plus, Rick and Minmei try to make a break for it and wind up lost in the depths of the SD-F1.
Episode 4 - The Long Wait: Rick and Minmei are trapped in the depths of the massive SD-F1 and must battle psychological and physical hardships. Also, the SD-F1 takes on 70,000 refugees from Macross Island. Plus, The Giant Tuna!!!
Episode 5 - Transformation: The Battle of Pluto!!! Under attack by Zentraedi forces Capt. Gloval's only hope of saving the ship is to transform the SD-F1 into batteloid mode - at the potential cost of thousands of civilian lives that may potentially get hurt during the transformation. Also, Rick is utterly confused about his feelings toward Minmei.
Episode 6 - Blitzkrieg: The Battle of Saturn!!! After much soul searching Rick decides to enlist and become a Veritech Fighter Pilot. Making their way back to earth the SD-F1 takes on the Zentraedi near Saturn. Plus, Rick crashes into the Zentraedi ship coming face-to-face with their mysterious foes.
In addition to these episodes the DVD also contains trailer ads for other anime series coming out on DVD from ADV.
Here's my assessment of the DVD itself:
Great: ROBOTECH ON DVD!!! 'Nuff said.
Good: Awesome production. The design, navigation, video and audio are all top-notch.
Okay: The trailers for the other DVD anime series from ADV were well done, but of course are just shameless plugs...
Incidentally, these volumes DO NOT have special DVD features. While on its own this may be considered a crime, not to fear. If you purchase the boxed set collections, each boxed set collection will come with an ""Extra: Elements of Robotechnology"" DVD special which will contain all the DVD special features you could want on DVD: interviews, trailers, specs, etc... So by all means, get the boxed set if you are planning on buying.
Personally, I'm very happy that ADV and Harmony Gold have finally released this series on DVD. This is BY FAR one of my favorite cartoons from childhood. If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST. It is the series that forever set the standard for Japanese anime. If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again. They're great for a trip down memory lane. Watching these episodes again now, I can honestly say that they are better than I remember. Give this (and all the other volumes, current and future releases) a watch. You won't be disappointed.
Highest Recommendation possible.",993945600,14,5142,4.980232558139535
1424206,5,B00005BJED,Finally i got my boxed set .... and the only thing i can say is this:AMAZING!! ... I was just a child when this anime took me into a world of dreams... I just dreamed to be Rick Hunter back in times.... after so much time i can live it all again..on DVD!. The good old Robotech is back... and it stills amazes me now grown up. GEt it it is a must for Robotech Fans. It would have been great if the sound and image could have been improved a little from the originals....but da heck...it is just as we saw it on TV back in the 80's. Get your copies people ..this is something you just cannot miss.,993772800,,596,3.975
1424207,5,B00005BJED,"This is not remastered! The picture and sound qualities are exactly what you saw in the 1980s when it was aired in the U.S.  And so what?  I know there are many out there who were hoping for ""DVD quality"", but I kind of like the nostalgic feeling I get when viewing this classic the way it was released.  To echo what has already been said, Robotech is not Super Dimension Fortress: Macross (which is being remastered and released later this year).  I never saw the Japanese version of Macross, so I'll refrain from the raging debate about which is better.  But for Robotech fans, this is a must buy and don't save your money waiting for remastered copies of Robotech.  I hear it ain't going to happen.",993686400,2,702,4.4453125
1424208,5,B00005BJED,"The original Japanese ""Macross"" is not ""Robotech"". They are almost entirely different stories, both are highly enjoyable. If you are a so-called ""anime purist"", you probably won't like Robotech. Get over it.

1424210,1,B00005BJED,"When i first saw that Macross was coming out on DVD i bought it ... without thinking. I even bought the BOX set! Now that i saw the first DVD i was really dissapointed! Why? Because it is in English! i want the original Japanese version with maybe chinese or english subtittles. I fell in love with Macross not Robotech! i saw the japanese original version back when i was 7yrs old and back in Asia. No complaint about the story because,hey it's Macross! But after i saw other peoples review saying there is a uncut and restored version coming out i will hold out on buying anymore Robotech... Well i have only 2 complaints about this DVD version. 1)Picture quality is horible! 2)I thought DVD was suppose to have great sound,not this one! But anyway thisbrings back memories. Dammit i bought the wrong one! I would rather spend the $250 that is on the animeigo site then buying another english dubbed version. Does not help to put ""Robotech"" in the cover either. We all know(for those who watched the original version in Asia or anywhere else) that we fell in love with Macross! not Robotech.",992908800,,1093,4.581632653061225
1424211,5,B00005BJED,"Okay people heres the deal, the two seperate Robotech DVDs are the American version. The Macross saga DVD boxed set is in Japanese.  However if you just learned how to speak Japanese and want to test your skill the Robotech DVDs have options that allow you to hear a Japanese voiceover.  You can also choose english subtitles. If you are a fan of Robotech, Gundam, giant robots, enormous aliens,on and off relationships, or anime in general this is for you!  And for those of you who saw it first on Cartoon Network, the DVD series will eventually include all three sagas.  That means that the last series that Cartoon Network left out for some reason will be published. Finally buy this here. I can guarantee you that this is no retail store.",992908800,,743,4.606060606060606

He watched all but the last episode on this DVD during his visit yesterday, & was completely enthralled all throughout it.  Not once did he give a bad criticism of it.  I was very glad to be able to give him the edited version of the series so his parents wouldn't kill me.

7937580,4,B00005BJED,"The first DVD volume of the Robotech series contains six excellent episodes, including the eyecatches to and from commercial breaks.  In the late 1980s, F.H.E. had released a videotape of these same episodes edited together to form one ""movie;"" while that was okay, this presentation by ADV Films is far superior, allowing easy access to any particular episode on may wish to view.
This is one of my favorite anime series.  However, I can only rate this PlayStation2-compatible DVD as a ""4"" due to its construction.  The main menu begins with a brief clip from the series without any actual menu selections immediately available, which can cause confusion for some users.",1011571200,4,671,5.027027027027027
7937581,5,B00005BJED,"In all of the Robotech series, this is probably the best DVD of them all. Because it unravels the precious story of Robotech, and tells the fantastic beginning! Plenty of comic reliefs, great fights, drama, music, and even on this DVD spectacular; nothing has been changed! They've kept it as original as ""original"" means! Yes!!
7 episodes of robotech wonder! If you just want one Robotech film, buy this one. Trust me, if you buy this one, it will NOT be your last.,",1005955200,,467,4.63855421686747
7937582,5,B00005BJED,"THE DVDS: It's true.  These dvds do not have any worthwhile special features (unless you buy the boxed sets) and the picture and sound quality on these dvds is not very impressive, but it's still better than watching a 15 year old VHS tape, AND you can skip to which ever episodes you like.  All in all, it's still the best quality editions of Robotech available, and it costs about the same as the old tapes.
THE SERIES: Macross fans that keep comparing their favorite series to Robotech have too much time on their hands.  While the animation and general plot are the same, the two stories take some very different directions, making them distinct from one another.  Both are worth seeing.  What makes Robotech such an amazing series is its ability to balance an engaging sci-fi war drama with a complicated interconnected web of characters that changes constantly.  It's character drama without too much melodrama.  Old characters die, sometimes unexpected and meaninglessly (as would happen in a real war), new characters appear, and favorite characters keep you watching.  If the first episode seems too predictable to you (young boy becomes a hero and gets the girl) KEEP WATCHING!  With the exception of only a few less than amazing episodes (4,14,17, and a few others) the series gets more complicated and fascinating with each episode.
  Finally, since Robotech is actually made up of three animated series (Macross was only one of them) Robotech also gives a long-range account of Earth's first intersteller wars.  Over the course of the series, you follow entire generations of characters involved in the Robotech saga.  If you're looking to commit yourself to a rich and complex sci-fi legacy, ripe with countless heroes and countless stories, Robotech is the way to go.",1003708800,3,1782,4.97972972972973
7937583,4,B00005BJED,"If you're in the 20-35 age group, then you *know* how huge this series was.  For many of us, this was our first exposure to Japanese animation.  The story is rich and complex, and for all its faults (Minmei, Gloval's disappearing accent, Lancer's um...costume), it struck a huge chord in my preteen mind.
 Basically, and alien spaceship crashes on earth.  Earthlings rebuild it, figure out the technology, and then the aliens (who happen to look *just* like us but 50 feet tall) come back to take the ship, only to find that they've underestimated us.
 Of course, what makes this series great is that it just begins with this huge war.  Macross is only the first third of a long story arc continuing through the Masters (Southern Cross) and Next Generation (Mospeda).  The earth is almost completely destroyed three times, we find out who the Zentraedi and their Masters are, where THEY got the technology, and why we're so similar to them.  This defined my childhood much the same way Superman did for a generation before.
 OK, so how's the DVD?  Well, it's the same old print.  I'm not sure if it was remastered or not, but it looks pretty much the same as I saw on reruns awhile back.  For the most part, the colors are a bit washed out, and the sound is pretty much UHF television quality.  They even kept the really cheesy ""star wipe"" effect between scenes, but what the heck, this IS an '80's show.  The nice thing is that you get six episodes for around twelve bucks as opposed to twenty for two episodes on VHS, so this is one heck of a bargain, and for the price, a great nostalgia trip.
 P.S.-there are plans to release the whole series.  If you're puzzled by the Zentraedi resemblance, read ""Inherit the Stars,"" by Frank Hogan.  It's the book Lunk (?) hands to Scott in the second episode or so of Next Generation.",997920000,,1825,4.532110091743119

Even now, all these years later, it's still a joy to watch. Carl Macek's labor of love is a must have for all Robotechies everywhere. Highly recommended.",996710400,,291,4.3090909090909095
