2626841,3,B000H5U5SU,Not what I exactly thought it would be. Considered to be a bit short on the history of the dynasty and focussed more on the militaristic feats. A bit of a disappointment to someone who is reasonably well versed with the history of India.,1185062400,3,237,4.409090909090909
2626842,4,B000H5U5SU,"This 90-minute program about India's Mughal (or Mogul) Empire, which lasted from 1526 to 1858, focuses on the battles and weaponry of the Mughals under the emperors Babur, Akbar, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb, with attention also to Mughal architecture, including the Taj Mahal. You'll learn a great deal about the making and use of the composite bow, armor for elephants, swords, matchlock guns, cannons, and rockets, and you'll see demonstrations of many of the weapons.

I was disappointed that virtually nothing was said about religion or government in the Mughal Empire--where Muslims ruled a largely Hindu populace--but if you're particularly interested in the Mughals as warriors, you'll probably find this program quite interesting.

8136417,5,B000H5U5SU,"""The unquestioned right of the king to seize power by any means, so whether that meant murdering his family, attacking the neighbouring kingdoms, it was up to his whim.""  That quote introduces the  mighty Moghuls who dominated the Indian subcontinent for centuries.  The Moghul Emperor was all powerful, and in the eyes of his court, followers and subjects could do no wrong.  On Earth, he represented Allah, and he was regarded as being divinely blessed.

Using an arsenal of weapons: the Composite Bow, the Rajput Kitar, the Indian Damascene Sword, Moghul Cannon and Mortars, the Merari Horse, Speared Rockets, the Indian Matchlock and Armoured Beasts of War, the Moghuls swept through India, conquering most of it, and at their height under the ruthless and cruel Emperor Aurangzeb ruled over 150 million people, one of the largest empires of its day.  It is estimated that at that height, one quarter of the entire world's economy was centred in the Indian subcontinent.

This documentary focuses primarily on the military exploits of the regime and the underlying weapons and organization that made those military victories possible.  Secondly, it deals with the immense building feats and engineering achievements to the dynasty.  The Moguls constructed fantastic buildings that still dazzle after the passing of time from Akbar's new capital of Fatepur Sikri to the ultimate, enchanting beauty of the Taj Mahal.  The great rulers: Babur, Akbar, Shah Jehan and Arangzeb; could combine the most callous cruelty with the most sophisticated, sublime sense of beauty.  Their monuments and palaces are some of the most gorgeous that the world has ever seen.

A gifted collection of scholars, weapons masters, archaeologists, engineers, artist and architects give their valuable insights into the world of the Moghul empire: Randolph Cooper, Lukas Novotny, Ratish Nanda, Thom Richardson, John Sims, Attilio Petruccioli, Stuart Tappin, John Fritz, Matthew Burk and Simon West.  Whether it is the armour of war elephants or the transportation of water to cities and palaces, these commentators are able to explain to the viewer how the Moghuls accomplished their massive achievements.

If this show piques the interest of those who see it, they may want to take a look at Michael Wood's ""The Story of India,"" which contains an entire episode on the Moghul dynasty and particularly concerns itself with the conflict between Emperor Auranzeb and his kin.  It, also, focuses more on the social and religious world of the Moghuls, and less on its military feats.

8136418,4,B000H5U5SU,"I bought ""The Mughals"" after a 13-day tour of north India.  Now I wish I had this before going since it put every site into historical perspective.  Whether you are planning to visit India or not, this is an excellent and understandable overview of pre-British, northern India.",1368835200,,277,4.872340425531915

8136420,5,B000H5U5SU,"This documentary went into depth on the Mughal weapons, and their power. Pretty scary to see how their little composite bows stacked up to the long bow. These guys must have been a real terror.",1248307200,,193,4.542857142857143
8136421,4,B000H5U5SU,"Firstly, I should state that I knew very little about the Mughals which is why I bought this DVD. I agree with the others who gave this film 4- and 5-stars. However, there is a negative no one has pointed out yet, so I will.
For some of the battle scenes the History Channel used the same kind of cheesy CGI that was used for Decisive Battles of the Ancient World. But this is just a quibble. It's entertaining. It's informative. Buy it. You won't be sorry.",1213833600,,457,4.264367816091954

8136423,5,B000H5U5SU,"I just watched this today and I loved it.  In 90 minutes, this provides you with a great introduction to the Mughals, their origins as nomadic peoples and how this shaped their style of conquest.  Particular attention is paid to the innovative weapons they either brought from Central Asia or adopted from the locals.  I am not a military history fan but I found the weapon demonstrations most interesting and enlightening.

Those of you familiar with the Mughals may agree that covering 3 + centuries of history in 90 minutes can only amount to massive omissions. For example, they did not go over the cultural legacy left by the Mughals apart from their exquisit architectural legacy.  They also overlooked how the Mughals expanded the reaches of Islam throughout the subcontinent. Their contributions to poetry, literature, painting and language are also overlooked.  It didn't bother me as much because everything they included was of interest, though more politically and militarily speaking than anything else.

I wish they came up with several volumes of this dinasty rather than the 90 minute documentary but for now it is the best I've found. Highly recommended.",1188000000,7,1171,5.099476439790576
