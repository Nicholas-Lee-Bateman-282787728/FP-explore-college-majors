I watch LOTS of movies, and enjoy a good twistful plot, or even some artful direction, but this garbage was the absolute worst film I believe I've ever seen. Yes, Anthony Hopkins is in it.

3060995,3,B00116GEJI,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Slipstream,"" a film by Anthony Hopkins. I didn't care for it. It's hard to explain, but it was a movie about making a movie. Well, and it was one of these artsy movies that were shot all out of chronological order. Plus the filming was in the style of what I would call ""playing with yourself.""  Little gaps and blips were present. Stops occurred here and there. Things changed color here and there. Parts of the film were in black and white. In my interpretation, most of this was just diddling around and had no bearing on the story. It was a film that only moviemakers could enjoy, and they might well get a kick out of it.

Parts were rather good. One part had two thugs take over a cafe and hold the employees as captives in a somewhat riveting scene, and then we find out that this was just part of the film they were shooting and everyone takes a break. Then one of the actors dies and there's a big scramble to decide what to do with saving the shots which have already been taken. Then there's the dreams about the film which are hard to tell from the film itself. One amusing episode has the writer asleep by his laptop and several people on the laptop screen watching him and commenting. Okay, it was somewhat clever and amusing here and there, but I just didn't get much out of the whole thing. Finally my mind just gave up on trying to piece it all together. I could try to watch it several more times to get it all sorted out, but it just isn't that interesting. Save your money, unless you're a film buff.

What I find interesting is why I wasn't upset with it. It contains nothing.
I too was caught by Anthony Hopkins name, who I believe is the finest actor around. No acting talents dispayed. The other surprize shock was seeing him as director.
It's not pretentious. It would need to have some thought or story line for that.
Perhaps I've grown soft by this flashing, scambled type of . . . video. (can't call it a movie). I don't mind the format, but it could be done so much better. Jacobs Ladder comes to mind.

3060998,1,B00116GEJI,"Anthony Hopkins is trying to outdo David Lynch, but this film is garbage.

After suffering through the entire movie, I watched the special feature which is a rerun of the movie with Hopkins doing a voice-over, giving his ""thoughts"" behind the movie.  He admits most of the scenes are random, much of the dialogue is improvised, and he named characters whatever popped into his head.  He says the script wrote itself, so he can't explain it and doesn't believe that it needs to be explained or even understood.  If anyone set out to deliberately make a terrible movie, I believe this would be the way to do it.

He says that if people like it ... fine, and if they don't ... all the better.  I guess you could think of the movie as a kind of Rorschach Test and some people will see what they want to see.

3061001,4,B00116GEJI,"The directorial and screenwriting debut of one of the world's greatest living actors is by no means an accessible film. While Anthony Hopkins stars in ""Slipstream"" as well, the thespian has stepped behind the camera to bring us a strangely imaginative cinematic experience.

The film itself makes no sense and is challenging, at times down right frustrating to watch. Though, ""Slipstream"" is one of those rare storytelling masterpieces about everything without meaning anything. Or perhaps a story about nothing that means everything.

Anthony Hopkins has drummed up what feels like decades of suppressed angst about filmmaking. His writing is full of the energy and guts of a young screenwriter, but with the wisdom of the most seasoned scribes. He has created a slice of cinema for the cinephile; overly rich in its flavors and densely packed with ingredients. If you're a connoisseur of the strange and admirer of Hopkins's demanding presence, like me you will eat it up till the last crumb falls indulgently from your gaping gaze.

3061002,5,B00116GEJI,"Although baffling at first, once you understand the spirit of the movie it becomes a thoroughly delightful romp, and a celebration of movies as an art form.  It starts out feeling like a 'Hollywood behind-the-scenes' movie, but then appears to change into a gangland murder mystery.  Shortly thereafter, you see the 'horse-of-a-different-color' from the WIZARD OF OZ, except that the 'horse' has been updated to a late model Corvette, and this modern horse-of-a-different-color scene ends with a silent-film-era closing iris shot.  The movie then turns into a 20-minute updated version of the 1936 Bette Davis/Humphrey Bogart movie THE PETRIFIED FOREST (except that Christian Slater is an even more menacing screen presence than Bogart was).  The film then transforms into a Hollywood behind-the-scenes farce, before morphing in other ways.

Near the end there is a 3-minute laugh-out-loud cartoonish sequence in the screen writer's study, and during the five minutes of closing credits the entire movie runs backwards in fast motion (as if an old reel-to-reel projector were projecting the film as it was being rewound).  There are repeated references to the original 1956 INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and the nearly 90-year-old star of that movie (Kevin McCarthy) plays himself in a charming bit part. In the DVD Special Features commentary, Anthony Hopkins explains the significance of the references to the INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, but he leaves many other things for the viewers to enjoy discovering for themselves (such as the fleeting three or four frames of a redddish-orange Frisbee flying through the desert like a UFO on its way to Area 51).",1280880000,4,1662,5.276515151515151
3061003,1,B00116GEJI,"Five minutes into this movie I realized I was in trouble.  Eight minutes and I began my own ""slipstream"" with the fast forward button!  I wasn't about to waste my time HOPING this movie would turn around.  And yes, like many others here, I was baffled, to say the least, that our beloved world class actor Anthony Hopkins wrote, directed, and starred in this ""film"".

Actually, I ordered this film by mistake.  I meant to get the other Slipstream movie, the one with Mark Hamill in it.  I guess I clicked the wrong box and this is what arrived.  Oh well, it's got Anthony Hopkins in it, probably gonna be good.  Not.  Afterward, I grabbed the packing sheet thinking to return it and realized the used copy I ordered cost $0.01. Yes, folks, just a penny (though $2.99 standard shipping).  That should have been a clue.  Actually, that should have been a BRIGHT NEON WARNING LIGHT.  A store selling a dvd for a penny...??!  Then again, I wasn't smart enough to catch that, so it may say something about my lack of intellectual prowess.

3061004,2,B00116GEJI,"I LOVE STORIES ABOUT TIME TRAVEL!  The movie, ""FREQUENCY"" is amongst my favourites.  I also like watching Anthony Hopkins on the screen -- he brings a reality and believablity to every movie I have seen him in. OK -- I've seen him in only two other movies:
""Hearts of Atlantis"", (where he played a ""remote-viewer"" on the run from the authorities), and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", wherein his often chillingly normally-acting Hannibal Lector, (aka ""Hannibal The Cannabal"", (canibble?), gave a terrifyingly
real tinge to this fictitious killer.  (I remember seeing the same moments of seeming-normality when I watched Tom Snyder's interview with Charles Manson.  Manson would seem SO normal for a few minutes...then his eyes would light up like a demented Christmas Tree, suddenly come to evil life...and you again became afraid for Mr. Snyder's safety, despite all the precautions you knew had to be in place....)  Looking at pictures of Mr. (or actually, SIR!) Anthony Hopkins, I think he would be PERFECT, to play one of my own personal heros -- Pope John Paul II -- in his older years, if ever such a movie was made.  Sir Anthony is the consummate professional --and I was definitely prepared for a real treat in this movie, which he not only acted in, but wrote and produced. A movie about one of my favourite subjects -- time-travel.  Not only this, but it also starred some of my favourite performers: JOHN TURTORRO, (who's done a wonderful job on the TV show ""MONK"", playing the lead character's, Adrian Monk's (TONY SHALHOUB's) brother, Ambrose Monk, KEVIN McCARTHY -- whom I, and just about every other sci-fi movie fan remembers fondly from ""INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS"", (a role he delighfully replays in this movie (!) -- but, sadly, it is never made clear in this movie whether it is the character or the actor whom we see here!, and CHRISTOPHER LAWFORD, whose other films I sadly have not seen, (yet!)...but whose name evokes fond memories of seeing films in which his late father, Peter Lawford, appeared.

I felt I was guaranteed a treat, and settled back to totally enjoy myself as I slipped the DVD disk of ""Slipstream"" into my DVD player.,,,,

I must sadly report that I have rarely been SO disappointed in any movie.  This may indeed, be the brilliant production of a very brilliant mind -- but my -- quite honestly -- less brilliant mind had a hard time grasping it all, at least as it was presented.  The action is disjointed -- as the situations, er...slip between and amongst each other with no seeming continuity.  This is SUPPOSED to be a movie about an ageing screen-writer, (Hopkins), whose characters unexpectedly come to life before his eyes.  But the line between what, (and who), is real, and what, (and who), is an illusion, is never truly defined, or at least, easily defined -- at least as far as I could see.  Only from the period dress, (1940s) of some of the lady characters, do you know that they are, er... ""not native"" to the 21st century.  Whether they are real or illusions is left up to the viewer to decide.  But it's real difficult for at least THIS viewer to decide, when the scenes themselves do not follow each other logically, and in sequence.  If this was done purposely to make the viewer realize the complications of the main character to distinguinsh between reality and fantasy, the ploy failed completely -- at least for me.  In any movie-- or play, book, ballet, or any other media -- the distinction between fantasty and reality, (if there is such a difference in said artistic work), should be drawn, and explained so the audience can UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING.  For instance, if there was a ""1984""ish type sci-fi made, and the people under the goverment's thumb kept their sanity, yet agreed totally with the dictum that ""2 + 2 = 5"", with no qualms whatsoever, it HAS to be explained to the audience that the reason for this seeming dichotomy is because....the people themselves have decided to secretly count numbers, ""1, 2, 4, 5, 3"".  Without this information, the viewer is confused and left adrift.  The many scenes in ""SLIPSTREAM"" which attempt to portray a dream-like atmosphere, and the difficulty of the main character to distinguish between reality and fantasy, are, sadly, not only dreamlike-- but utterly, and totally confusing.  Where is this movie going?  One really never completely finds out.

""SLIPSTREAM"" is a very noble effort, in that it piled reality and fantasy together, hoping to impress the viewer with the difficulty the main character has in distinguishing one from the other -- but a little more logical sequencing, in both writing and editing
would have been SO welcome!  Many episodes of the classic TV show, ""THE TWILIGHT ZONE"", dealt with the difficulty to differentiate between fantasy and reality, as well....BUT JUST ABOUT EVERY VIEWER COULD FOLLOW THE LOGICALLY-EVOLVING STORY-LINES OF THESE EPISODES.  Here, the story-line does NOT logically evolve.  It takes TIME for most people to realize the innuendos and subleties in this movie.  Most are murky, and even the clearer ones, (such as a vulture quite unexpectedly uttering, ""Have A Nice Day""), are quickly followed by even more of the confusing ""is it reality or is it fantasy?"" scenes which, as the scenes THEMSELVES do not follow in a logical sequence, vut seem to pile upon each other in a disjointed sequencing that makes just about no sense whatsoever, and thus make for an even more confused viewer.

Even so, I'm looking forwared, (eagerly!), to Sir Anthony's next science-fiction, science-fact, or fantasy film.  ""SLIPSTREAM"" shows a brilliant mind at work -- it's just that people with just as much interest in fantasy and science fiction, but without quite as brilliant a mind as Sir Anthony, find it hard to follow a ""scatter-scene"" script, that seems, which is difficult for, I hazard to guess, most viewers to follow.  So, I here respectfully  suggest that Sir Anthony watch, (or re-watch), the original TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, the original episdoes of THE OUTER LIMITS, or even some of the episodes of Steven Speilberg's AMAZING STORIES.  Amd perhaps, as well, ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  Even the strangest stories should have to have a LOGICAL SEQUENCE to them, so that those not quite as brilliant, (and I DO mean brilliant!!!!!) as Sir Anthony can also follow them!

To make a point in a movie, the audience has to UNDERSTAND what's happenng.  If the majority of viewers of this movie don't understand it, as I have not, the point is lost.  And that is a great pity.  Because, even though I couldn't entirely follow the story, the brilliance in the acting, and special effects, still leads me to strongly believe Sir Anthony was trying very hard to get SOME points of view over to the audience.  I for one am very, very eager to know what those points were.  Unfortunately, as I was not able to follow this disjointed film, I still don't know what they are.  And, please believe me when I say I continue to want, very very much want, to know what they were and are. I'll be eagerly awaiting the next movie, to find out!  : )",1259712000,2,7090,4.8112118713932395
3061015,2,B00116GEJI,"I picked this up out of the sale bin because of the name Anthony Hopkins on it.  Had read nothing about the film but have come to respect highly his acting. I did note that he had also directed and written it. I have scrupulously avoided reading any reviews or explanations regarding it till I finish this. Wouldn't want to be influenced in my intended guidance for other viewers.
With that out of the way, what about the film. Some reviewers called Neil Diamond's, Jazz Singer,  a vanity production when it came out, that is, something that was financed and released only because it was something a big star wanted to do, not because anyone else thought he should do it. Somehow, knowing nothing about the financing of this film, I think the same terms could be applied to it. Yes, one can ultimately make sense of it,  put it all together into a meaningful pattern, but, at least for me, by that time, I really only wanted the film to end and had no desire to see or hear any more of it or about it. Whether because it is overly ""arty"", or in a style that has an audience, but with which I am not familiar , I don't know. All I can say is that I thought it woefully lacking in what I like in a film and that it contained little that gratified me.",1258848000,,1248,4.235294117647059
3061016,1,B00116GEJI,"This is one of those films that would probably cater to those who are able to see beauty in anything that is SUPPOSED TO BE beautiful, whether actual beauty exists or not.  It reminds me of the story of the emperor who has no clothes.  Some of you may know this story.  It's the story about an emperor who wants a great garment-worker to make him a garment for a great event.  The garment-worker has trouble coming up with a truly original design that will impress the emperor, so he chooses to tell the emperor that the garment is so unique and exquisite that it's invisible.  The emperor puts on the ""invisible"" garment and goes to the event naked.  Because the public is talking to, and about, the emperor, everyone comments on how beautiful his clothes are.  Only a child points out the obvious by saying, ""But Mommy, the emperor has no clothes"".

This film and films like it, fall into this category for me.  If you show enough people something that is completely senseless, and chaotic, some will find it to be beautiful because it was made by a great name (In this case Anthony Hopkins).  Or maybe they want to believe that it is designed to stimulate their intellect, so they make something out of nothing and call it genius.  It may be possible that this film, and films like it such as ""The Fountain"", are simply over-my-head.  But to me they're just chaos and confusion on the screen that is then passed of as being genius.

My guess is that more than 99% of the population will find this movie to be crap.  The other 1% is able to look at crap and convince themselves that something transcendent is taking place.  So if you're like most people, you probably won't like this movie.  If you choose to see it, you certainly shouldn't get your hopes up.  I realize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it's still true that most people wouldn't choose the word ""cute"" to describe a spider.

%%%%%% The following is an update to my review %%%%%%%

I was looking through my amazon reviews and have noticed that many people have not found this review to be helpful.  After reading it again, myself, I can understand why.  I failed to really say much about the movie, itself, other than that it is so abstract to the point of being terrible.  For this reason, I have decided to add more content to this review pertaining to the actual plot of the movie itself.

The movie contains lots of big-name actors that you've seen before including Christian Slater and Anthony Hopkins himself.  So acting ability isn't the problem with this movie.  The problem is that it's basically a senseless feature film that boils down to things going on that make absolutely no sense.

Imagine a director turning on a camera and telling the actors to just react to whatever is going on around them.  Don't give them a script, and don't offer a plot.  Just tell them to talk to each other about things that make no sense, jumping from subject to subject so that anyone watching would wonder ""what in the world is going on?"".  Then imagine the director telling the audience that the movie is about a director who is losing his mind -- That's ""Slipstream"".  That's the movie.

As I've said before.  There is no way for me to appreciate this movie because it made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  So for me, it's like someone showing you a blank sheet of paper and saying that it's a picture of polar bear in a snow storm.  Some may call this clever, but it's really just a blank piece of paper.

I don't know if this will make my review more useful to those who read it, but I really don't know what else to say about this movie.",1252800000,2,3620,4.4581430745814306
3061017,5,B00116GEJI,"Slipstream is a rare kind of movie. Read the other reviews (not the 1 stars) if you want to get a fairly inclusive overview. What makes Slipstream so special is that it is experienced by the left brain as utter nonsense, but the right brain can catch on. It is possible to ""get"" this film without being able to say what you got. Isn't that delightful! The scenes are an indecipherable kaleidoscope that gave me a headache on my left side (true); there is a rhythm, rather than logic and a relatedness, rather than linear unfolding. Perhaps this film is even brilliant. If you can bear to be in a state of not-knowing, this movie can work for you. If you enjoy not knowing, if you enjoy not having complete control over your experience, you may thrill at this film. Early on, you'll realize that the ""plot"" is too complex for it to all come together at the end. So don't wait for it. Instead, let yourself enjoy your bafflement.

By leaving understanding entirely in our hands, the movie presents us with pure possibility. How often can we say that? Even though it was too violent for my taste, I felt exhilarated and inspired. What it left me with: Each of us is in a wildly individual, and often even significantly divergent, experience. What allows us to be related to another's experience is our ability to step out of our unique perspective and recognize the commonly held narrative in which we each have our own experience. I have no idea if the film delivered that or if my firing-furiously-at-novelty neurons invented it, but such is the wonder of this marvel, that I could be left with this delicious insight. What might you find?

The least of Slipstream's virtues are lighting, cinematography, editing that becomes a ""character"" and Hopkins' ability to get an excellent performance out of his actors. Bravo.",1236038400,21,1817,4.692789968652038

This is someone unable to bare his soul; unable to commit to any one important concept that would open a window to the viewer; or allow the viewer ""into"" Hopkin's consciousness. A gutless collection of ""isn't this a cute effect"" bridge-to-nowhere-isms.
He is quoted at a film festival as saying 'he was just having fun,"" but why spend your (or investors) money to not even try to make a piece of art? I believe when his failure became obvious, Mr. Hopkins is hiding in the rationalization that ""Well, I didn't really try to make a movie.""

3061019,2,B00116GEJI,"""Slipstream"" is a movie written by, directed by and acted in by Anthony Hopkins.  It should be great.  It is a stinker.  Nowadays it has become popular to make surreal movies that leave the viewer guessing.  It is overdone, in general, and especially overdone in this movie.  There is a constant barrage of disconnected shots and sounds, leading more to confusion and boredom than to profound experience.

I'm still not sure what this movie was supposed to be out and was surprised when one commentator wrote that it is supposed to be a commedy [???].  If so, it's the most uncomedic comedy ever.  The only thing I can figure about this mishmash is that it reflects the writer's [Hopkins] own confusion in making a confusing movie.  It might be like an old ""Twight Zone"" film that was altogether better done.  In the Twilight film characters at a diner are confused when they do illogical things, make stupid statements and then have to repeat them again.  It turns out that they aren't real.  They are the product of an overwrought author's imagination as he types pages of dialogue and action, only to toss them in artistic disgust and start over again.

Maybe that's the point of this movie but, if it's the point, it's seen through a very dark looking glass.  Maybe Hopkins the writer is writing and rewriting his script and his 'actors', not knowing they are puppets on the writer's string, go through oftentimes idiotic actions only to have to repeat them again, better.  Maybe but I'm not sure.  I gave this one a second star because I think anyone with 'Sir' in his name needs better than a one star.

After being bombarded with previews for this film over the course of the past three months with whatever film I rented; the catchy Lennox song, the obscure language, and the idea of a dream within a dream all pulled within my mind so long, that ""Slipstream"" finally found its way into my queue - subsequently into my DVD player.  Bravo to the marketing, its constant barrage of previews finally did break through my subconscious and I had to watch this movie.  None the less, Sir Anthony Hopkins jumps headfirst into the role of tri-fecta by directing, producing, and also creating the music for this random film that demonstrates the power of editing coupled with free thought.  It is a simple story, but the way Hopkins narrates; he easily gives it a voice of his own as well as paying homage to several influential directors.  As his wife produces and acts in this film, ""Slipstream"" transforms before your eyes from a confusing dream to a project of passion.  As Hopkins gives you small puzzle piece after puzzle piece, the average viewer will immediately scrunch up their face, wonder where the explosions are, and not give this little gem an opportunity.  This is not mainstream cinema.  ""Slipstream"" forces the viewer to use your imagination, listen to the clues, watch the symbolism, and use every part of the brain possible.  As this being a film by Anthony Hopkins it was surprising, for this critic, it was even a bigger surprise -  ""Slipstream"" is a cranial film that kept me on the edge of my couch the entire one hour thirty minutes.

We Have Lost the Plot

Where did this film come from?  Hopkins said that he had never written a film before, and I must say, this freshman outing hurt my brain more than any other film ever has.  It wasn't that it was boring, dull, overly stylish, or clich&eacute;, it was just intelligent.  There were scenes that just felt more surreal than - shall I say - real?  The concept that Hopkins developed, the idea of a dream within a dream, translated well to both being dream-like to even more literally, a film within a film.  He built an entire film around a small concept, a poem none-the-less, and he built it sans the big explosions, the linear storytelling, and the overpriced stars.  For the first time in my possible review existence, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed a particular scene involving Christian Slater and Jeffery Tambor.  Pre-""Slipstream"", one could never imagine the two being such a dynamic pair, but their words, their connection between themselves in that one scene was breathtaking.  I had to watch it again just to ensure that I understood their language.  It was as if Hopkins took a page from Tarantino's playbook with Oliver Stone looking on, that entire ""I'm Not a Crook"" coupled with the entire Yogi Bear references just sent shivers through my spine.  They were phenomenal, and I applaud Hopkins for giving them the words and emotion to create such a superb scene.

This Stone-esque scene was just the beginning of something startling unique.  Hopkins creates these scenes further within the film, never quite giving us that full taste of the real plot, but just enough to keep us guessing.  This isn't ""Remains of the Day"" Hopkins or ""Silence of the Lambs"" Hopkins, this is a film utterly his own.  The average viewer will not understand his darkened message about life and existence, but those cinephiles that enjoy challenging films will fall over backwards.  Hopkins choice of editor also creates this world with fresh new brush-strokes.  At times the jumps are spooky spiced with some brooding foreshadowing, but Hopkins creates a story with the jumps, the editing is a part of the story - choosing to ignore them will inevitably mean that you are missing the destructive nature of the film.  ""Slipstream"" is a mystery; clues are heavily embedded in the language, characters, and choice of editing all created by Hopkins.  It reminded me of a bit of ""Primer"" coupled with ""Natural Born Killers"", but uniquely Hopkins.

Overall, ""Slipstream"" came out of nowhere and proved to be an enjoyable hour and a half of unknown Hopkins.  Just when you think you know his style, he creates something like this.  The editing, the power of his actors (as small as they were), and his choice of language and sound blended a powerful film that will leave you guessing until the final moments - and even then, you may not capture the full scope of his message.  This is a challenging film to watch.  It isn't you straightforward storytelling or compelling characters, and in fact, Hopkins is only in about half the film.  It is the idea of using the tools around you to create a non-linear story based with a film of a film.  If that sentence doesn't hurt, than you may not be ready for this film.  That isn't to say Hopkins film doesn't have flaws - it isn't perfect - but it was intellectually powerful.  This is a thinking-person's film, Hopkins realizes it, but he doesn't talk down to the average viewer.  He creates scenes and emotions that literally come out of nowhere, leaving you in the dust asking for more.  Again, watch the Slater/Tambor scene to see what I am speaking about - surprisingly - it will knock your socks off!

If this constitutes the new world of Anthony Hopkins, I cannot wait for his second outing.  ""Slipstream"" took me back to an era where challenging cinema didn't go straight to DVD release, but instead found its way into mainstream and finally gave us something to pay nearly $10 for.  If you are looking for explosions, scantily clad women, and product placement - go to any summer blockbuster - if you are hunting for something to ensure brain cells are not decaying - see ""Slipstream"", it impressed me from beginning to end!

3061024,4,B00116GEJI,"I can't say that I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews for Slipstream, as it is most certainly an acquired taste and not intended for pedestrian viewers. But if you're into extremely surreal fare the likes of Jordorowsky, Lynch (at his most Lynchian), Maddin, etc., then I wholeheartedly encourage you to give Sir Anthony's exquisite little mindfvck an enthusiastic ride - I doubt you'll be disappointed. Fans of David Lynch and Oliver Stone (both of whom Hopkins has worked with on The Elephant Man and Nixon, respectively) should feel particularly at home with Slipstream given how much obvious influence their most surreal works exert over the look and feel of this production.

The FACT of the matter is that this is not a bad film, let alone a candidate for worst film of the year as some hyper-critical knobs have asserted. Some people however, have the insufferable tendency of ripping apart anything they don't ""get"". A highly experimental work such as Slipstream will always be lambasted by certain viewers of a particular [closed] mindset who exhibit more conventional or orthodox (i.e. conservative) cinematic tastes.

It's hard to wrap one's head around the fact that for his writing and directorial debut, Sir Anthony Hopkins has concocted a (literally) dizzying head-trip of a movie capable of casting a subliminal spell upon an open-minded viewer. The fact that an eminently respected artist in his mid-sixties has seen fit to offer up such an unapologetically uncommercial work is both refreshing and inspiring - and, once again, let the naysayers be damned for their refusal to acquiesce to Hopkins fever-dream vision.

Slipstream is downright hallucinatory, which can either be a very good or very bad thing depending upon one's constitution for such fare.* And even viewed entirely sober this film has the ability to induce a consciousness-altering effect upon the viewer. One would imagine that viewed under the influence of psychedelics that this cinematic ""trip"" would be a revelatory experience for the viewer. I look forward to testing this hypothesis at some point in the future for my second viewing.

*ANALOGOUS TANGENT FROM A METAPHORICAL PERSPECTIVE: Look, I personally will not set foot upon a rollercoaster - or any kind of  ""breakneck"" thrill-rides of the sort - as they are not my idea of fun; I simply do not have the constitution for them. But I would be remiss to confuse my own subjective displeasure of such rides with some ego-centric, self-deluded notion that such rides, therefore, [must] objectively ""suck."" Such a perspective would be immature (not to mention FALSE) in that it fails to take into consideration the obvious appreciation and enjoyment that such rides are capable of bringing to many others whose constitution is perfectly suited for physically-demanding recreational activities. Likewise, there are many people whose constitutions are simply not designed to enjoy extremely surreal spectacle the likes of a movie like Slipstream. And that's perfectly understandable. I would no more wish to impose a surrealistic cinematic ""thrill-ride"" upon a mindset not geared for it than I would want someone to impose a literal, mechanical thrill-ride upon me. But what I do wish, however, is that people make an effort to e-x-p-a-n-d their consciousness enough to realize a subtle yet powerful truth:

Just because something sucks FOR YOU personally (i.e. SUBJECTIVELY) doesn't necessarily mean that it therefore SUCKS in general for everyone (i.e. OBJECTIVELY).

3061045,5,B00116GEJI,"The febrile and fevered mind of a sly screenwriter - Felix Bonhoeffer -  is constantly baffled and besieged by personages of the fiction of a play he's writing for the big screen and his tormented past, when these characters intermingle themselves, and appear blended with his memories of the past, acquiring such dimensions of trueness that become a horrid nightmare of undecipherable horror in his alienated mind.

This film made remind  to Jorge Luis Borges, who wrote a forceful but descriptive brief tale about ""The memory of Shakespeare"" (a superb and relatively unknown tale) in which describes the sharp physical tensions into a creative mind in process, as final outcome of a well coveted ambition of any writer. In this sense the sleeping process may work out either liberator device or alienation mechanism. And that's why Hopkins, smartly makes reference to this cult movie ""The invasion of the body snatchers"", which is  (at least to my mind) the most pyramidal science fiction picture ever made in the Fifties. That interesting portrait about alien organisms, that masked into pods are capable to reproduce with absolute fidelity a human being after he has slept.

So these brief interludes of the suspended conscious or the pores of the infiniteness acquire life, being absolutely to distinguish in this ambivalence state what is reality and what `s unreal, will take over the mind of Felix leading to the last frontier of unexplored and even wasteland territories of our memory's labyrinths, carving once more in relief, the demons of the reason produce monsters.""

Along the history of cinema, there have been other films that have remarked this process of sudden breakthrough of the reality and the fiction. Paul Wengerer started in 1913 with his anthological film ""The student of Prague"", in the middle twenties was Murnau with ""The last man""; during the thirties ""The blue angel"", during the forties ""Dead of night"" ; in the fifties ""The seven seal""; in the sixties ""Shock corridor"" and ""Seconds"" ; in the seventies ""Catch 22"" and ""Someone flew into the cuckoo's nest""  in the  in the eighties  ""The stunt man"", ""Brazil""  and ""Altered states"", while in the Nineties ""Zentropa,"" ""Twelve monkeys"" and ""Window to Paris.""

Try watching it like most people, just seeing the trailer/commercial. You're led to believe Slipstream is more of a time travel movie where the person is sent into the past to change things they're afraid of, etc. (this definition of the word slipstream is stated by one of the characters talking to Anthony) but that never happens. So, with that introduction, and no information or sense of what his current life/reality is, you watch the movie trying to figure out which parts are past, present or possibly future. As it turns out, it's all ""present"" but you never really get that.

I have a good sense of humor (I don't care for the ""Three Stooges"" type of humor, but today's type I enjoy) but I saw NOTHING humorous about this movie and didn't even realize it was supposed to be a comedy 'til after I'd seen it. I'm also not ""easily confused"" as a reviewer felt negative reviewers might be. When someone asks, for example, ""Do you know the time?"", it is generally understood to mean, ""Please tell me the time if you know it"" and the typical response may be, ""12:35"". However, another valid, but less expected (and less enlightening) response would be, ""Yes, I do. Thanks for asking."" This is sort of what goes on in this movie. When they said they lost the plot, since the movie is about people filming a movie, it's naturally assumed the person is referring to THAT movie's plot, NOT the one you rented (""Slipstream"").

Despite what other reviewers say, Slipstream is a wonderful film.  Scattered...yes, Strange...yes and Different?  oh yes.  Sir Anthony Hopkins wrote, directed, starred, and scored this film.  About a writer who slips further into a slipstream of his characters and has trouble distinguishing his characters from reality (in a nutshell)

I believe Hopkins tried to do this very thing with his first directorial debut but failed miserably.

The movie seems to try to plunge us into the world of what actors, film makers, and screenwriters might go through as they slug along trying to make sense of their life as film creators.

The problem is who cares. We the viewing public pay to see a film that takes us into story and can suspend our reality for another.

This film fails to establish that ""other reality"" and therefore is tedious and extremely boring. Reminds me of the stupid psychedelic films that have been long forgotten into oblivion of the 60's--but instead much worst.

Those who found this movie entertaining or humorous must be either on drugs or are the type of people who laugh at senseless violence.

The film editing and camera effects make up 3/4s of what the film is about and as a film maker myself, I was not in the least bit impressed.

I have seen better editing and film effects from beginning film students.

This film was obviously made to cater to those who can sit and lose themselves (perhaps with the aid of drugs) watching a mish mash of cut scene after cut scene of unorganized footage with the repetitive and god-awful-boring endless `dj vu' references.

Well, and it was one of these artsy movies that were shot all out of chronological order. Plus the filming was in the style of what I would call ""playing with yourself.""  Little gaps and blips were present. Stops occurred here and there. Things changed color here and there. Parts of the film were in black and white. In my interpretation, most of this was just diddling around and had no bearing on the story. It was a film that only moviemakers could enjoy, and they might well get a kick out of it.

Parts were rather good. One part had two thugs take over a cafe and hold the employees as captives in a somewhat riveting scene, and then we find out that this was just part of the film they were shooting and everyone takes a break. Then one of the actors dies and there's a big scramble to decide what to do with saving the shots which have already been taken. Then there's the dreams about the film which are hard to tell from the film itself. One amusing episode has the writer asleep by his laptop and several people on the laptop screen watching him and commenting.

Anthony Hopkins has drummed up what feels like decades of suppressed angst about filmmaking. His writing is full of the energy and guts of a young screenwriter, but with the wisdom of the most seasoned scribes. He has created a slice of cinema for the cinephile; overly rich in its flavors and densely packed with ingredients.

3295499,5,B00116GEJI,"Although baffling at first, once you understand the spirit of the movie it becomes a thoroughly delightful romp, and a celebration of movies as an art form.  It starts out feeling like a 'Hollywood behind-the-scenes' movie, but then appears to change into a gangland murder mystery.  Shortly thereafter, you see the 'horse-of-a-different-color' from the WIZARD OF OZ, except that the 'horse' has been updated to a late model Corvette, and this modern horse-of-a-different-color scene ends with a silent-film-era closing iris shot.  The movie then turns into a 20-minute updated version of the 1936 Bette Davis/Humphrey Bogart movie THE PETRIFIED FOREST (except that Christian Slater is an even more menacing screen presence than Bogart was).  The film then transforms into a Hollywood behind-the-scenes farce, before morphing in other ways.

Near the end there is a 3-minute laugh-out-loud cartoonish sequence in the screen writer's study, and during the five minutes of closing credits the entire movie runs backwards in fast motion (as if an old reel-to-reel projector were projecting the film as it was being rewound).  There are repeated references to the original 1956 INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and the nearly 90-year-old star of that movie (Kevin McCarthy) plays himself in a charming bit part. In the DVD Special Features commentary, Anthony Hopkins explains the significance of the references to the INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, but he leaves many other things for the viewers to enjoy discovering for themselves (such as the fleeting three or four frames of a redddish-orange Frisbee flying through the desert like a UFO on its way to Area 51).",1280880000,4,1662,5.276515151515151

3295501,2,B00116GEJI,"I LOVE STORIES ABOUT TIME TRAVEL!  The movie, ""FREQUENCY"" is amongst my favourites.  I also like watching Anthony Hopkins on the screen -- he brings a reality and believablity to every movie I have seen him in. OK -- I've seen him in only two other movies:
""Hearts of Atlantis"", (where he played a ""remote-viewer"" on the run from the authorities), and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", wherein his often chillingly normally-acting Hannibal Lector, (aka ""Hannibal The Cannabal"", (canibble?), gave a terrifyingly
real tinge to this fictitious killer.  (I remember seeing the same moments of seeming-normality when I watched Tom Snyder's interview with Charles Manson.  Manson would seem SO normal for a few minutes...then his eyes would light up like a demented Christmas Tree, suddenly come to evil life...and you again became afraid for Mr. Snyder's safety, despite all the precautions you knew had to be in place....)  Looking at pictures of Mr. (or actually, SIR!) Anthony Hopkins, I think he would be PERFECT, to play one of my own personal heros -- Pope John Paul II -- in his older years, if ever such a movie was made.  Sir Anthony is the consummate professional --and I was definitely prepared for a real treat in this movie, which he not only acted in, but wrote and produced. A movie about one of my favourite subjects -- time-travel.  Not only this, but it also starred some of my favourite performers: JOHN TURTORRO, (who's done a wonderful job on the TV show ""MONK"", playing the lead character's, Adrian Monk's (TONY SHALHOUB's) brother, Ambrose Monk, KEVIN McCARTHY -- whom I, and just about every other sci-fi movie fan remembers fondly from ""INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS"", (a role he delighfully replays in this movie (!) -- but, sadly, it is never made clear in this movie whether it is the character or the actor whom we see here!, and CHRISTOPHER LAWFORD, whose other films I sadly have not seen, (yet!)...but whose name evokes fond memories of seeing films in which his late father, Peter Lawford, appeared.

I felt I was guaranteed a treat, and settled back to totally enjoy myself as I slipped the DVD disk of ""Slipstream"" into my DVD player.,,,,

I must sadly report that I have rarely been SO disappointed in any movie.  This may indeed, be the brilliant production of a very brilliant mind -- but my -- quite honestly -- less brilliant mind had a hard time grasping it all, at least as it was presented.  The action is disjointed -- as the situations, er...slip between and amongst each other with no seeming continuity.  This is SUPPOSED to be a movie about an ageing screen-writer, (Hopkins), whose characters unexpectedly come to life before his eyes.  But the line between what, (and who), is real, and what, (and who), is an illusion, is never truly defined, or at least, easily defined -- at least as far as I could see.  Only from the period dress, (1940s) of some of the lady characters, do you know that they are, er... ""not native"" to the 21st century.  Whether they are real or illusions is left up to the viewer to decide.  But it's real difficult for at least THIS viewer to decide, when the scenes themselves do not follow each other logically, and in sequence.  If this was done purposely to make the viewer realize the complications of the main character to distinguinsh between reality and fantasy, the ploy failed completely -- at least for me.  In any movie-- or play, book, ballet, or any other media -- the distinction between fantasty and reality, (if there is such a difference in said artistic work), should be drawn, and explained so the audience can UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING.  For instance, if there was a ""1984""ish type sci-fi made, and the people under the goverment's thumb kept their sanity, yet agreed totally with the dictum that ""2 + 2 = 5"", with no qualms whatsoever, it HAS to be explained to the audience that the reason for this seeming dichotomy is because....the people themselves have decided to secretly count numbers, ""1, 2, 4, 5, 3"".  Without this information, the viewer is confused and left adrift.  The many scenes in ""SLIPSTREAM"" which attempt to portray a dream-like atmosphere, and the difficulty of the main character to distinguish between reality and fantasy, are, sadly, not only dreamlike-- but utterly, and totally confusing.  Where is this movie going?  One really never completely finds out.

""SLIPSTREAM"" is a very noble effort, in that it piled reality and fantasy together, hoping to impress the viewer with the difficulty the main character has in distinguishing one from the other -- but a little more logical sequencing, in both writing and editing
would have been SO welcome!  Many episodes of the classic TV show, ""THE TWILIGHT ZONE"", dealt with the difficulty to differentiate between fantasy and reality, as well....BUT JUST ABOUT EVERY VIEWER COULD FOLLOW THE LOGICALLY-EVOLVING STORY-LINES OF THESE EPISODES.  Here, the story-line does NOT logically evolve.  It takes TIME for most people to realize the innuendos and subleties in this movie.  Most are murky, and even the clearer ones, (such as a vulture quite unexpectedly uttering, ""Have A Nice Day""), are quickly followed by even more of the confusing ""is it reality or is it fantasy?"" scenes which, as the scenes THEMSELVES do not follow in a logical sequence, vut seem to pile upon each other in a disjointed sequencing that makes just about no sense whatsoever, and thus make for an even more confused viewer.

Even so, I'm looking forwared, (eagerly!), to Sir Anthony's next science-fiction, science-fact, or fantasy film.  ""SLIPSTREAM"" shows a brilliant mind at work -- it's just that people with just as much interest in fantasy and science fiction, but without quite as brilliant a mind as Sir Anthony, find it hard to follow a ""scatter-scene"" script, that seems, which is difficult for, I hazard to guess, most viewers to follow.  So, I here respectfully  suggest that Sir Anthony watch, (or re-watch), the original TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, the original episdoes of THE OUTER LIMITS, or even some of the episodes of Steven Speilberg's AMAZING STORIES.  Amd perhaps, as well, ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  Even the strangest stories should have to have a LOGICAL SEQUENCE to them, so that those not quite as brilliant, (and I DO mean brilliant!!!!!) as Sir Anthony can also follow them!

To make a point in a movie, the audience has to UNDERSTAND what's happenng.  If the majority of viewers of this movie don't understand it, as I have not, the point is lost.  And that is a great pity.  Because, even though I couldn't entirely follow the story, the brilliance in the acting, and special effects, still leads me to strongly believe Sir Anthony was trying very hard to get SOME points of view over to the audience.  I for one am very, very eager to know what those points were.  Unfortunately, as I was not able to follow this disjointed film, I still don't know what they are.  And, please believe me when I say I continue to want, very very much want, to know what they were and are. I'll be eagerly awaiting the next movie, to find out!  : )",1259712000,2,7090,4.8112118713932395
3295512,2,B00116GEJI,"I picked this up out of the sale bin because of the name Anthony Hopkins on it.  Had read nothing about the film but have come to respect highly his acting. I did note that he had also directed and written it. I have scrupulously avoided reading any reviews or explanations regarding it till I finish this. Wouldn't want to be influenced in my intended guidance for other viewers.
With that out of the way, what about the film. Some reviewers called Neil Diamond's, Jazz Singer,  a vanity production when it came out, that is, something that was financed and released only because it was something a big star wanted to do, not because anyone else thought he should do it. Somehow, knowing nothing about the financing of this film, I think the same terms could be applied to it. Yes, one can ultimately make sense of it,  put it all together into a meaningful pattern, but, at least for me, by that time, I really only wanted the film to end and had no desire to see or hear any more of it or about it. Whether because it is overly ""arty"", or in a style that has an audience, but with which I am not familiar , I don't know. All I can say is that I thought it woefully lacking in what I like in a film and that it contained little that gratified me.",1258848000,,1248,4.235294117647059
3295513,1,B00116GEJI,"This is one of those films that would probably cater to those who are able to see beauty in anything that is SUPPOSED TO BE beautiful, whether actual beauty exists or not.  It reminds me of the story of the emperor who has no clothes.  Some of you may know this story.  It's the story about an emperor who wants a great garment-worker to make him a garment for a great event.  The garment-worker has trouble coming up with a truly original design that will impress the emperor, so he chooses to tell the emperor that the garment is so unique and exquisite that it's invisible.  The emperor puts on the ""invisible"" garment and goes to the event naked.  Because the public is talking to, and about, the emperor, everyone comments on how beautiful his clothes are.  Only a child points out the obvious by saying, ""But Mommy, the emperor has no clothes"".

This film and films like it, fall into this category for me.  If you show enough people something that is completely senseless, and chaotic, some will find it to be beautiful because it was made by a great name (In this case Anthony Hopkins).  Or maybe they want to believe that it is designed to stimulate their intellect, so they make something out of nothing and call it genius.  It may be possible that this film, and films like it such as ""The Fountain"", are simply over-my-head.  But to me they're just chaos and confusion on the screen that is then passed of as being genius.

My guess is that more than 99% of the population will find this movie to be crap.  The other 1% is able to look at crap and convince themselves that something transcendent is taking place.  So if you're like most people, you probably won't like this movie.  If you choose to see it, you certainly shouldn't get your hopes up.  I realize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it's still true that most people wouldn't choose the word ""cute"" to describe a spider.

%%%%%% The following is an update to my review %%%%%%%

I was looking through my amazon reviews and have noticed that many people have not found this review to be helpful.  After reading it again, myself, I can understand why.  I failed to really say much about the movie, itself, other than that it is so abstract to the point of being terrible.  For this reason, I have decided to add more content to this review pertaining to the actual plot of the movie itself.

The movie contains lots of big-name actors that you've seen before including Christian Slater and Anthony Hopkins himself.  So acting ability isn't the problem with this movie.  The problem is that it's basically a senseless feature film that boils down to things going on that make absolutely no sense.

Imagine a director turning on a camera and telling the actors to just react to whatever is going on around them.  Don't give them a script, and don't offer a plot.  Just tell them to talk to each other about things that make no sense, jumping from subject to subject so that anyone watching would wonder ""what in the world is going on?"".  Then imagine the director telling the audience that the movie is about a director who is losing his mind -- That's ""Slipstream"".  That's the movie.

As I've said before.  There is no way for me to appreciate this movie because it made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  So for me, it's like someone showing you a blank sheet of paper and saying that it's a picture of polar bear in a snow storm.  Some may call this clever, but it's really just a blank piece of paper.

I don't know if this will make my review more useful to those who read it, but I really don't know what else to say about this movie.",1252800000,2,3620,4.4581430745814306
3295514,5,B00116GEJI,"Slipstream is a rare kind of movie. Read the other reviews (not the 1 stars) if you want to get a fairly inclusive overview. What makes Slipstream so special is that it is experienced by the left brain as utter nonsense, but the right brain can catch on. It is possible to ""get"" this film without being able to say what you got. Isn't that delightful! The scenes are an indecipherable kaleidoscope that gave me a headache on my left side (true); there is a rhythm, rather than logic and a relatedness, rather than linear unfolding. Perhaps this film is even brilliant. If you can bear to be in a state of not-knowing, this movie can work for you. If you enjoy not knowing, if you enjoy not having complete control over your experience, you may thrill at this film. Early on, you'll realize that the ""plot"" is too complex for it to all come together at the end. So don't wait for it. Instead, let yourself enjoy your bafflement.

By leaving understanding entirely in our hands, the movie presents us with pure possibility. How often can we say that? Even though it was too violent for my taste, I felt exhilarated and inspired. What it left me with: Each of us is in a wildly individual, and often even significantly divergent, experience. What allows us to be related to another's experience is our ability to step out of our unique perspective and recognize the commonly held narrative in which we each have our own experience. I have no idea if the film delivered that or if my firing-furiously-at-novelty neurons invented it, but such is the wonder of this marvel, that I could be left with this delicious insight. What might you find?

The least of Slipstream's virtues are lighting, cinematography, editing that becomes a ""character"" and Hopkins' ability to get an excellent performance out of his actors. Bravo.",1236038400,21,1817,4.692789968652038

He is quoted at a film festival as saying 'he was just having fun,"" but why spend your (or investors) money to not even try to make a piece of art? I believe when his failure became obvious, Mr. Hopkins is hiding in the rationalization that ""Well, I didn't really try to make a movie.""

3295516,2,B00116GEJI,"""Slipstream"" is a movie written by, directed by and acted in by Anthony Hopkins.  It should be great.  It is a stinker.  Nowadays it has become popular to make surreal movies that leave the viewer guessing.  It is overdone, in general, and especially overdone in this movie.  There is a constant barrage of disconnected shots and sounds, leading more to confusion and boredom than to profound experience.

I'm still not sure what this movie was supposed to be out and was surprised when one commentator wrote that it is supposed to be a commedy [???].  If so, it's the most uncomedic comedy ever.  The only thing I can figure about this mishmash is that it reflects the writer's [Hopkins] own confusion in making a confusing movie.  It might be like an old ""Twight Zone"" film that was altogether better done.  In the Twilight film characters at a diner are confused when they do illogical things, make stupid statements and then have to repeat them again.  It turns out that they aren't real.  They are the product of an overwrought author's imagination as he types pages of dialogue and action, only to toss them in artistic disgust and start over again.

Maybe that's the point of this movie but, if it's the point, it's seen through a very dark looking glass.  Maybe Hopkins the writer is writing and rewriting his script and his 'actors', not knowing they are puppets on the writer's string, go through oftentimes idiotic actions only to have to repeat them again, better.  Maybe but I'm not sure.  I gave this one a second star because I think anyone with 'Sir' in his name needs better than a one star.

After being bombarded with previews for this film over the course of the past three months with whatever film I rented; the catchy Lennox song, the obscure language, and the idea of a dream within a dream all pulled within my mind so long, that ""Slipstream"" finally found its way into my queue - subsequently into my DVD player.  Bravo to the marketing, its constant barrage of previews finally did break through my subconscious and I had to watch this movie.  None the less, Sir Anthony Hopkins jumps headfirst into the role of tri-fecta by directing, producing, and also creating the music for this random film that demonstrates the power of editing coupled with free thought.  It is a simple story, but the way Hopkins narrates; he easily gives it a voice of his own as well as paying homage to several influential directors.  As his wife produces and acts in this film, ""Slipstream"" transforms before your eyes from a confusing dream to a project of passion.  As Hopkins gives you small puzzle piece after puzzle piece, the average viewer will immediately scrunch up their face, wonder where the explosions are, and not give this little gem an opportunity.  This is not mainstream cinema.  ""Slipstream"" forces the viewer to use your imagination, listen to the clues, watch the symbolism, and use every part of the brain possible.  As this being a film by Anthony Hopkins it was surprising, for this critic, it was even a bigger surprise -  ""Slipstream"" is a cranial film that kept me on the edge of my couch the entire one hour thirty minutes.

We Have Lost the Plot

Where did this film come from?  Hopkins said that he had never written a film before, and I must say, this freshman outing hurt my brain more than any other film ever has.  It wasn't that it was boring, dull, overly stylish, or clich&eacute;, it was just intelligent.  There were scenes that just felt more surreal than - shall I say - real?  The concept that Hopkins developed, the idea of a dream within a dream, translated well to both being dream-like to even more literally, a film within a film.  He built an entire film around a small concept, a poem none-the-less, and he built it sans the big explosions, the linear storytelling, and the overpriced stars.  For the first time in my possible review existence, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed a particular scene involving Christian Slater and Jeffery Tambor.  Pre-""Slipstream"", one could never imagine the two being such a dynamic pair, but their words, their connection between themselves in that one scene was breathtaking.  I had to watch it again just to ensure that I understood their language.  It was as if Hopkins took a page from Tarantino's playbook with Oliver Stone looking on, that entire ""I'm Not a Crook"" coupled with the entire Yogi Bear references just sent shivers through my spine.  They were phenomenal, and I applaud Hopkins for giving them the words and emotion to create such a superb scene.

This Stone-esque scene was just the beginning of something startling unique.  Hopkins creates these scenes further within the film, never quite giving us that full taste of the real plot, but just enough to keep us guessing.  This isn't ""Remains of the Day"" Hopkins or ""Silence of the Lambs"" Hopkins, this is a film utterly his own.  The average viewer will not understand his darkened message about life and existence, but those cinephiles that enjoy challenging films will fall over backwards.  Hopkins choice of editor also creates this world with fresh new brush-strokes.  At times the jumps are spooky spiced with some brooding foreshadowing, but Hopkins creates a story with the jumps, the editing is a part of the story - choosing to ignore them will inevitably mean that you are missing the destructive nature of the film.  ""Slipstream"" is a mystery; clues are heavily embedded in the language, characters, and choice of editing all created by Hopkins.  It reminded me of a bit of ""Primer"" coupled with ""Natural Born Killers"", but uniquely Hopkins.

Overall, ""Slipstream"" came out of nowhere and proved to be an enjoyable hour and a half of unknown Hopkins.  Just when you think you know his style, he creates something like this.  The editing, the power of his actors (as small as they were), and his choice of language and sound blended a powerful film that will leave you guessing until the final moments - and even then, you may not capture the full scope of his message.  This is a challenging film to watch.  It isn't you straightforward storytelling or compelling characters, and in fact, Hopkins is only in about half the film.  It is the idea of using the tools around you to create a non-linear story based with a film of a film.  If that sentence doesn't hurt, than you may not be ready for this film.  That isn't to say Hopkins film doesn't have flaws - it isn't perfect - but it was intellectually powerful.  This is a thinking-person's film, Hopkins realizes it, but he doesn't talk down to the average viewer.  He creates scenes and emotions that literally come out of nowhere, leaving you in the dust asking for more.  Again, watch the Slater/Tambor scene to see what I am speaking about - surprisingly - it will knock your socks off!

If this constitutes the new world of Anthony Hopkins, I cannot wait for his second outing.  ""Slipstream"" took me back to an era where challenging cinema didn't go straight to DVD release, but instead found its way into mainstream and finally gave us something to pay nearly $10 for.  If you are looking for explosions, scantily clad women, and product placement - go to any summer blockbuster - if you are hunting for something to ensure brain cells are not decaying - see ""Slipstream"", it impressed me from beginning to end!

3295521,4,B00116GEJI,"I can't say that I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews for Slipstream, as it is most certainly an acquired taste and not intended for pedestrian viewers. But if you're into extremely surreal fare the likes of Jordorowsky, Lynch (at his most Lynchian), Maddin, etc., then I wholeheartedly encourage you to give Sir Anthony's exquisite little mindfvck an enthusiastic ride - I doubt you'll be disappointed. Fans of David Lynch and Oliver Stone (both of whom Hopkins has worked with on The Elephant Man and Nixon, respectively) should feel particularly at home with Slipstream given how much obvious influence their most surreal works exert over the look and feel of this production.

The FACT of the matter is that this is not a bad film, let alone a candidate for worst film of the year as some hyper-critical knobs have asserted. Some people however, have the insufferable tendency of ripping apart anything they don't ""get"". A highly experimental work such as Slipstream will always be lambasted by certain viewers of a particular [closed] mindset who exhibit more conventional or orthodox (i.e. conservative) cinematic tastes.

It's hard to wrap one's head around the fact that for his writing and directorial debut, Sir Anthony Hopkins has concocted a (literally) dizzying head-trip of a movie capable of casting a subliminal spell upon an open-minded viewer. The fact that an eminently respected artist in his mid-sixties has seen fit to offer up such an unapologetically uncommercial work is both refreshing and inspiring - and, once again, let the naysayers be damned for their refusal to acquiesce to Hopkins fever-dream vision.

Slipstream is downright hallucinatory, which can either be a very good or very bad thing depending upon one's constitution for such fare.* And even viewed entirely sober this film has the ability to induce a consciousness-altering effect upon the viewer. One would imagine that viewed under the influence of psychedelics that this cinematic ""trip"" would be a revelatory experience for the viewer. I look forward to testing this hypothesis at some point in the future for my second viewing.

*ANALOGOUS TANGENT FROM A METAPHORICAL PERSPECTIVE: Look, I personally will not set foot upon a rollercoaster - or any kind of  ""breakneck"" thrill-rides of the sort - as they are not my idea of fun; I simply do not have the constitution for them. But I would be remiss to confuse my own subjective displeasure of such rides with some ego-centric, self-deluded notion that such rides, therefore, [must] objectively ""suck."" Such a perspective would be immature (not to mention FALSE) in that it fails to take into consideration the obvious appreciation and enjoyment that such rides are capable of bringing to many others whose constitution is perfectly suited for physically-demanding recreational activities. Likewise, there are many people whose constitutions are simply not designed to enjoy extremely surreal spectacle the likes of a movie like Slipstream. And that's perfectly understandable. I would no more wish to impose a surrealistic cinematic ""thrill-ride"" upon a mindset not geared for it than I would want someone to impose a literal, mechanical thrill-ride upon me. But what I do wish, however, is that people make an effort to e-x-p-a-n-d their consciousness enough to realize a subtle yet powerful truth:

Just because something sucks FOR YOU personally (i.e. SUBJECTIVELY) doesn't necessarily mean that it therefore SUCKS in general for everyone (i.e. OBJECTIVELY).

This film made remind  to Jorge Luis Borges, who wrote a forceful but descriptive brief tale about ""The memory of Shakespeare"" (a superb and relatively unknown tale) in which describes the sharp physical tensions into a creative mind in process, as final outcome of a well coveted ambition of any writer. In this sense the sleeping process may work out either liberator device or alienation mechanism. And that's why Hopkins, smartly makes reference to this cult movie ""The invasion of the body snatchers"", which is  (at least to my mind) the most pyramidal science fiction picture ever made in the Fifties. That interesting portrait about alien organisms, that masked into pods are capable to reproduce with absolute fidelity a human being after he has slept.

So these brief interludes of the suspended conscious or the pores of the infiniteness acquire life, being absolutely to distinguish in this ambivalence state what is reality and what `s unreal, will take over the mind of Felix leading to the last frontier of unexplored and even wasteland territories of our memory's labyrinths, carving once more in relief, the demons of the reason produce monsters.""

I believe Hopkins tried to do this very thing with his first directorial debut but failed miserably.

The movie seems to try to plunge us into the world of what actors, film makers, and screenwriters might go through as they slug along trying to make sense of their life as film creators.

The problem is who cares. We the viewing public pay to see a film that takes us into story and can suspend our reality for another.

This film fails to establish that ""other reality"" and therefore is tedious and extremely boring. Reminds me of the stupid psychedelic films that have been long forgotten into oblivion of the 60's--but instead much worst.

The film editing and camera effects make up 3/4s of what the film is about and as a film maker myself, I was not in the least bit impressed.

I have seen better editing and film effects from beginning film students.

This film was obviously made to cater to those who can sit and lose themselves (perhaps with the aid of drugs) watching a mish mash of cut scene after cut scene of unorganized footage with the repetitive and god-awful-boring endless `dj vu' references.

One of the worst written, misdirected, poorly filmed, and edited efforts in years.

What on earth was Hopkins thinking or better yet what medications is he on these days.",1205366400,9,1669,4.64625850340136
3295550,4,B00116GEJI,"How to convey that life feels unreal and meaningless ... not only feels that way, but can very likely BE unreal and meaningless? Perhaps one way is to make a movie that pulls viewers through unreal and meaningless moments ... and just as they think they can put something together into meaning, pull them back out into another mystery that can't be solved.

I'm glad I rented Slipstream. I knew I was going to be in for a ride that would be disjointed and confusing in a movie in which characters comment about the movie itself -- ""we lost the plot!""  It's a landscape of the Mind. I appreciate that. My advice if you are going to watch it ""Just go along, let yourself be pulled forward by the slipstream...""",1204675200,6,708,4.438461538461539

8240708,5,B00116GEJI,"""SlipStream"" was fabulous!!!  Highly entertaining (fun, full of surprises and never dragged), artistic (writing, acting & direction outstanding), intelligent, and profound!  Anthony Hopkins deserves multiple Oscars and Golden Globes.  He's done a lot of fantastic work over the years but this may be his crowning achievement.  I'm 56 and gifted with a superior memory.  I've watched a lot of movies but only occasionally do I watch a film more than ounce and never in close proximity to the first viewing.  ""SlipStream"" is a movie that I easily could watch a week after the first viewing without running the risk of getting bored.  In fact, scenes from the film have been popping into my mind for a week after watching the movie.  ""Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream.  Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily life is but a dream.""  I'll definitely recommend ""SlipStream"" to friends and no doubt watch it multiple times.  WARNING:  At the risk of coming across as egoic, ""SlipStream"" is for everyONE but it may test the coping skills of shallow idiots.  To fully appreciate ""SlipStream"" I believe it helps to have an eye for true art, the wisdom that comes with age, and a higher level of consciousness.  In ""SlipStream"" Anthony Hopkins plays a Hollywood screenwriter who is forced to drive his vintage big red convertible into the Mohave Desert to pen emergency scenes for a film shoot in progress with a menagerie of brilliantly-eccentric thespians at an aging diner run by a Dolly Parton impersonator.  I'm not going to say anything else because I don't want to spoil Hopkins' stream of thought, especially how it syncs with the ""Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.""  Suffice it to say, however, that Hopkins obviously possesses an eye for true art, the wisdom that comes with age, and a higher level of consciousness since he wrote, acted, and directed ""SlipStream.""  A true treat and Cinematic Trinity!!!",1461369600,,1905,4.977848101265823
8240709,1,B00116GEJI,"This movie wanted to be a great film, but I think Hopkins unfortunately fell into the trap of making a movie that looks and sounds like a great one without any of the heart.

It made all the difference and, actually, the movie made some sense and made me think that Anthony Hopkins (he is such a great actor) wasn't totally nuts. The special features added enormous relevance but still not any where near enough to recommend this strange concoction. To anyone who may decide to view this, I will recommend watching the special features first. That way you''ll kind of know what is going on and won't be totally lost and the special features will lend perspective.",1399852800,2,630,4.633928571428571
8240715,5,B00116GEJI,"This film is not for casual viewers, or anyone who has no experience with what might be called ""waking unreality."" This is as close as we'll ever get to watching someone else freefalling through the last moments of his life. It is shattered and shattering, disconnected yet completely and intricately connected, a dream within a dream (to quote Poe) and the nightmare that stays with us when we're awake, hiding just behind our eyes and making us see things that aren't there, or maybe that are. If you find these ideas difficult to fathom, be proud of your sanity and hold on to it with both fists. Those of us who are mad will understand every frame.

As a writer myself, I relate particularly to the sensation of pentimento that Hopkins' character experiences as his creations -- his characters -- take on a certain aspect of reality that is all their own. We create them; we are indeed their creator. However, as their creator, we are responsible for them. It's a lifetime commitment, and if you forget them... I promise you, they will come back and complain about their treatment at your supernatural hand.

Start with ""All That Jazz,"" the brilliant Bob Fosse film -- it will ease you into the world of the creative genius whose mind recreates his reality through dream sequences and an intimate conversation with Death. If you're careful, you can jump to ""Waking Life,"" which will make sense only as you assemble the puzzle pieces and look for the key pieces that tell you where you are and what's happening on screen. Then come back to ""Slipstream"" -- it will be much easier to understand then. Failing understanding, just let it flow through your mind and see what sticks. If you don't ""get it,"" don't worry... many people don't. Nobody's fault. You'll know more when you discover just how much of your everyday reality is all in your head. Like a story, or a movie, or someone's idea of what a life should look like.
