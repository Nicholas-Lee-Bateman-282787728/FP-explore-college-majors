348315,5,6301752708,"I have watched ""The Small One"" every Christmas since before I can remember, and it still makes me cry.  The message is simple -- like the song says ""There's a place for each small one"" -- but one that we all need to hear.  Don Bluth's films are at the top of my list for their mastery of storytelling.  Although this is a short, it is as emotionaly satisfying as one of his full length features.  It is a gem worth tracking down for kids and grown-ups alike.",1099958400,6,458,4.170454545454546
348316,5,6301752708,"I can't say enough about this short. Unfortunatly, Disney announced officially, they have no plans to bring this short to DVD. Which saddens me. They plan to hide this masterpiece in the catacombs while they release mindless films like Home on the Range. I hope that eventually, with the support of Small One's greatest fans, we can see to it that there is a Small One DVD one day. (...)",1090195200,11,387,4.542857142857143
348317,5,6301752708,"I've loved this story ever since my parents bought me the story record of it years ago. I recently started searching for it, either on VHS or CD. I'd just about given up hope when we stumbled across it at the video rental store on a new release Disney video called 'Countdown to Christmas'. It is the last story on the video, and it is there in full, with all the wonderful songs included.
This is a wonderful short story from Disney that gives a new perspective to the Nativity story - from the viewpoint of the little donkey that carried Mary to Bethlehem, and the boy who owned him.
The songs are lovely to listen to, especially 'Small One' and 'Friendly Face'. There is a charm and warmth in this tale that I find is lacking in many of the animations that Disney are producing of late.
This is something that is well worth having, if you can locate it.",1044230400,22,856,4.3229813664596275

I used to watch it every year, but have not seen it on TV for many years.  My husband had never seen it, and I retold the story to him- and he cried just HEARING it!  And I cried just TELLING it!
