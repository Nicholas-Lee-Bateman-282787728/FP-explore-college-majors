8143959,5,B000I5KAXE,"Brilliant early Peter Weir story of psychological terror. A plumber enters the university apartment of a young woman who is doing research on primitive African cultures. Within minutes of his appearance he's taking a shower in her bathroom. From then on he causes more and more damage to the plumbing, all the while playing up to her, intimidating her, in a sinister manner. At one point he is in the bathtub with his guitar and harmonica like Bob Dylan, singing ""I'm ME, Babe. Don't you turn your back on ME, Babe.""

The genius of the movie is that no one else is afraid of him. Her friend thinks he is sexy, her husband refuses to take her seriously because he's excited about his new job in Geneva.

At her wits' end, she plants the watch her husband gave her in the plumber's truck. When she says the watch is gone her husband is very disturbed about the cost of the watch, still indifferent to his wife.

We see the parking lot from above as the police converge on the plumber. When he sees the watch he looks up at the woman on her balcony, ""You bitch! You set me up!"" and his voice is suddenly covered by the throbbing of jungle drums as the credits go up.

Very difficult to watch, very rewarding.",1497398400,,1205,4.390134529147982

8143962,5,B000I5KAXE,"This 1978 Aussie film is a penetrating psychological study of just how far a highly educated housewife can be taken before she goes over the edge. The plumber she lets into her apartment not only tears apart her bathroom but also her psyche,  and it gradually becomes a raw battle of wits between this intellectual woman and the ""simple tradesman"" who is slowing hammering away at her life. From director Peter Weir. Excellent.",1417910400,4,427,4.8493150684931505
8143963,3,B000I5KAXE,"Somewhat amusing dark comedy about a woman who is terrorized
by a demented plumber who turns her bathroom into a three
stooges-like nightmare while constantly badgering her with
a slick combination of menace and charm. Not all that bad
and not all that good. Diff though having the plumber being
the bad guy! I was hoping it was more gruesome and having
a death by plunger! Or a customer having a spot on heart
attack after getting the bill.  This is directed by none
other PETER picnic at hanging rock WEIR. A offbeat HORROR
that may,or may not be up your pipes(sic)",1192665600,3,567,4.5588235294117645
