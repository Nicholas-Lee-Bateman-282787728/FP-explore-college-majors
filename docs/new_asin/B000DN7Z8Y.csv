8102566,3,B000DN7Z8Y,"The film itself, po polsku (in Polish) looked to be fun and lovingly irreverent. The English subtitles are almost worthless.  My Polish mother is sitting here translating for me (translating what she can actually make out as the audio is very poorly recorded as well.) The translated subtitles miss more than half of what is being said, creating sentence fragments, and failing to convey the humor of the script. There is just barely enough translation to follow the story line. Very disappointing.",1497744000,,498,5.073170731707317
8102567,4,B000DN7Z8Y,"The appeal of this movie lies in its accurate portrayal of a RURAL Polish CHURCH wedding...Yes, a RURAL CHURCH wedding! These types of Redneck get togethers, that are sanctioned, albeit promoted, by the 'holy' powers that pollute 95% of the populations' minds, are not as popular today as this film would make them out to be. To truly appreciate this film you'd have to either be Polish, or at least have had the 'privilege' of attending a Polish wedding, otherwise, you'll find this film to be boring and superficial.",1141430400,3,518,4.831460674157303
