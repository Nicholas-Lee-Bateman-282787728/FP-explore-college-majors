8344802,1,B001URA63I,I threw this dvd out.  The filmmaker was obsessed with bullfighting and showed terrible scenes of the bulls and also horses in the ring getting hurt.  The presentation of Picasso's artwork was also bizarre and disturbing.  This film is more about the filmmakers inner life than about Picasso.,1418428800,3,292,5.041666666666667
8344803,3,B001URA63I,"Nice to know things you don't know before bout your favorite artist. Every book or film more or less must got some new information. This film did too to me.  If you think you know a lot bout this artist this one might not for you. Well, it's always good to sit back and relax after work with beer watching short simple film bout Picasso.",1367539200,2,337,4.184615384615385
