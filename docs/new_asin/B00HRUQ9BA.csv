6201453,5,B00HRUQ9BA,"My wife and I like watching Hallmark movies and this movie was another great one that will be coming out soon. You will get some great snafus and humorous moments. There were so many comedies of errors throughout the movie, it left me with a smile on my face and thoroughly entertained. The actors did a great job portraying their characters and making them believable and likable. Overall, this was a fun movie for the whole family!

6201457,5,B00HRUQ9BA,I bought this movie because of Naomi Judd being in it. I really thought this was an adorable movie. Naomi Judd was good in it. Just a nice sweet little movie. A decent movie the whole family can watch.,1476316800,,201,4.17948717948718

6201461,3,B00HRUQ9BA,"The situations in this movie are very true to life situations that married couples find themselves dealing with. It has some comedy. I thought the characters  were okay but I found them to be somewhat annoying. It seemed their problems mostly came from them wanting only what was best for themselves and miscommunication. It was an okay movie but not one of my favriote romance movies.
It was interesting to see if they could make it through the hard times  and find out if their love would shine through or if it would all end in disaster.",1464048000,,540,4.556701030927835

6201466,4,B00HRUQ9BA,"This is a fun, somewhat humorous movie.  The premise is a good one.  While the outcome is predictable, the surprise is figuring out which couple decides what.  The best part is watching the couples' initial reactions to the unusual news and then their processes of arriving at their final decisions.  We really enjoyed the movie.  Not high powered, but fine to watch together during the evening meal.",1455926400,2,400,4.91044776119403

6201477,5,B00HRUQ9BA,"If you want to watch a feel good movie, then this one is for you.  It is one
picture you can watch and not feel dirty afterward.  The actors did an excellent
job......Naomi Judd is a long time favorite.  She didn't have to give up her day
job ( as one of the singing Judds )  to become a very accomplished actress.
Naomi and Wynona can still belt out a song.  Highly recommend this film.",1437955200,3,387,4.1066666666666665

6201479,4,B00HRUQ9BA,What a cute movie---3 best friends all get married. (Spoiler alert) then find out that their marriage licenses were improperly filed. Do they still feel the same way? Do they still want to be married? You will have to watch and find out!,1436918400,,237,4.534883720930233

6201492,2,B00HRUQ9BA,"This review is really a warning for parents who look at Hallmark movies as good family fare, as I do. I know plenty of people will disagree with me, but I think this movie gives a bad portrayal of what a marriage should be like all the way around. If any couple in real life had so little communication between them as these three couples do, then they would never make it to their first anniversary.  In addition (spoiler alert), to have one of the three brides not remarry her husband after they found out their marriage certificates were not legally signed and completed, but yet she got her ""happily ever after"" with someone else, I don't find this to be a good family movie at all.  There was also more language than most other Hallmark movies I have seen, especially taking the Lord's name in vain. And when I got to the end of the movie, I did not have that feel-good feeling like I often do with the Hallmark movies.",1415145600,15,924,4.366279069767442
6201493,2,B00HRUQ9BA,"I love Naomi Judd, but was disappointed with this film.  She was wonderful in

6201502,3,B00HRUQ9BA,"This one was entertaining, though many of the characters were over-the-top.  I bought this to watch with my 12 year old daughter.  We were looking for fluff and that's what we got, so if that's your goal, you'll enjoy it.  My daughter enjoyed it more than I did.",1402358400,,262,4.416666666666667
6201503,5,B00HRUQ9BA,"This movie Nearlyweds starring Danielle Panabaker, Jessica Parker Kennedy and Britt Irvin and Naomi Judd. This movie is about three best friends, named Erin (Danielle Panabaker), Casey (Jessica Parker Kennedy) and Stella (Britt Irvin) who get married in the same month. The three girls all thought they were getting happily ever after.  One day a letter came out to all three girls saying that the three girls are not married because some important papers were not filed. When the girls first read the letters they are afraid of telling their husbands because they think they will not marry them again because there are some bumps in the road with their marriages. Watch this movie to see if Erin, Casey and Stella ever get married for real. This movie is really cute! I hope you enjoy it!!",1401494400,,790,4.8088235294117645

Bad guy on When calls the heart. Cute dog. Nasty habits though. Good ending. 3 females wed then learn their marriage certificates were never signed. They all were experiencing conflict in their marriage. Jealousy, mother-in-law issues. A contriving husband.....on and on making for a temptation to stay unmarried. watch the rest yourself and enjoy!!",1527465600,,511,5.023529411764706
