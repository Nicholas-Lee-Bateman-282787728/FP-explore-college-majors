8052249,4,B0007VNPB8,"I've always had an intrest. Since ""James West"" pulled out his lock pick or ""Mission Impossible"" did the same; I've always been mesmerized by the act. The ""Visual Guide to Lockpicking"" opened this world up to me in laymens terms and graphic pictures that I couldn't help but understand. Cool !!!  Thanx a million...Write another one,  I'll buy it.",1346716800,2,346,4.8474576271186445
8052250,2,B0007VNPB8,"The DVD is well organized and contains some very basic, but very good information. However, I was VERY disappointed in the amount of information about different kinds of locks, pins, and types of picks. My opinion, you can get better information for free off YouTube.",1247443200,5,267,4.955555555555556
8052251,3,B0007VNPB8,"It was helpful there is alot of information on how to open a lock, but

I felt there should have been more animation technology where the mastering of opening locks is not as easy as they propose it on the dvd.

However it was insightful and interesting.",1171152000,2,254,4.382978723404255
