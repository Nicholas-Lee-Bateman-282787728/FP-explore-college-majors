8128434,4,B000G1MAEC,"Product not received in 5 box like pictured.  Came in one big collection box from Asia.  Discs not printed in english, menus on dvd screens either.  The epidodes are in english with some asian subtitles sometimes.  Was supposed to be sent from U.S.A.",1243468800,,250,4.744186046511628
8128435,5,B000G1MAEC,"These reviews are meant to describe the product not the seller. How can you give this product 1 star if you have never even used the product.  I am sorry you had a bad experience. I own the 5 box dvd set shown and I have enjoyed it very much. It's an easy cheap way to travel back in time and relive the adventures of the autobots, insectecons, aerobots, decepticons and all the other characters. If you were a kid in the 80s I am preaching to the choir. Unlike the chinese dvd 1 box set the Rhino 5 box set shown in the image has the following extras:
3D animated menus
Original script from""Transpor to Oblivion""
Bumbers
Animation outtakes
Animation slates and tests
Japanese show openings
Rhino Remastering process
Interviews with the writers
Digital transfer from original 35mm
Original audio option
Transformers Collectors Convention Documentary 2003
Public Service announcments
Historical trailers
BOTCON documentary and convention highlights
Interview with Voice Actors Neil Kaplan, Michael McConnohie and script writerEarl Kress
Mistake Reel
Good luck and I hope that if you buy this product used or new that you enjoy it.",1230422400,,1129,4.973544973544974
8128436,1,B000G1MAEC,"Picture shows 1 set of the 5 boxes of the 4 seasons of Transformers, but instead I got 1 chinese box of the 4 seasons Transformers. It's in english with chinese subtitles.  Amazon should remove the picture of the 1 set of the 5 boxes of the 4 seasons of Transfomers.",1186790400,21,266,4.215686274509804
