8325262,3,B000JJSL8U,"The fairy tales are nice and I chose this DVD because of the classic tales, but because of the low standard of animation, this is not as exciting and watchable as the recent animated cartoons. I will not recommend this DVD.",1267315200,,223,4.463414634146342
8325263,5,B000JJSL8U,"I have loved these stories as a child and wish to pass them on to my children and their friends.  Unlike new animated fairytales on film, these encourage more listening and imagination... almost as good as a grown up reading a book.",1241222400,4,232,4.523809523809524
