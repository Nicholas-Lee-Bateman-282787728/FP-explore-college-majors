I have been doing dvd workouts for years and I was looking for a nice, short cardio for days I don't have time for longer and to mix up my library.  The prompts are too slow, the moves are not explained well, and they do not last long enough to learn them without interrupting the workout, wasting my time.  I also found some to be dangerous to twist a knee as you are having to twist to the other direction.  Too many moves thrown in to get into the groove. I kept the dvd for a few years thinking as I learn the moves I will appreciate it more and will use it for variety, but I get so annoyed with the above issues I am disgusted before I even get to the 20 minute mark.  It is going in the trash.",1515024000,,803,3.9382716049382718
8179235,4,B000EDWL5K,"I was looking for a new workout that I can get done in 30-40 minutes and had heard good things about Karen Voight.  The exercise routine is fun and challenging and has some different moves that I've never seen before.  Its a good workout, keeps my interest and I will be buying other workouts from karen voight in the future.",1191456000,4,325,4.4
8179236,2,B000EDWL5K,"Let me just say that I'm a huge Karen Voight fan! I've been working out with her since Great Weighted Workout all the way to Burn and Firm. I got this dvd just to mix things up a bit. I was not impressed. I loved Strong and Smooth moves! Now thats a workout! This DVD felt like it was more for beginers! The moves are a little complicated though. I consider myself pretty good at picking up intricate steps, but I had a hard time learning these moves! I love Karens style of teaching! So if you're considering buying one of her dvds please buy Burn and Firm or Strong and Smooth moves!",1154563200,10,585,4.185840707964601
8179237,4,B000EDWL5K,"Karen Voight is so good at challenging you by always mixing it up! You never get bored and you always use new muscles. The only thing that bothered me about this DVD was that there was no cool down or stretching AT ALL. It ended so abruptly. When the credits came up I thought the DVD skipped and I missed something. So I was standing there sweating with my heartrate up and had to cool down and stretch on my own. Other than that, I'd recommend it.",1150156800,11,449,4.172413793103448
