3045433,4,B00104AYOC,"While I remember watching this show and loving Bob Cummings acting ability, that was way back in the late fifties and early 60ties.
You will enjoy these sitcoms, and they certain deliver on the nostalgia aspect, but remember , the quality of taping these shows was nothing like today's television. These are in color , so you might get one of your kids to watch it with you, but if you buy any black and white shows that you really loved from you childhood, forget getting one of your kids today to sit and watch it with you. Its' like having to watch a silent film from the 20s if you want to know why your kids feel like they do.
At any rate, please do not let them stop you from buying these shows from your childhood , or early teens. They're almost as good as you remember.....
Enjoy",1372809600,8,788,4.26

This episode has all the regualrs, Bob Cummings, Rosemary Decamp, Dwyane Hickman and Ann B Davis.  It also has Kathlene Freeman, Nancy Culp and Rose Marie  and King Vidor. Some of the greats of TV Land.  Each disk in this set has 5 episodes on them.  A great deal.",1370304000,2,421,4.111111111111111

3045438,4,B00104AYOC,"Bob Cummings plays a lady's man photographer of beautiful women.  It is funny to see his male chauvinism 1950s' style and charm turned on for every model who comes into his studio -- all quite politically incorrect by today's standards.  But that is part of the humor.  Not for femininazis, liberals, and other stodgy types.  His grandpa, also played by Cummings, is a ""dirty ol' man"" who outdoes his son in womanizing, athletics, and endurance, even to swiping one of his son's own dates, a model who is done with starving herself and eager to eat anything fattening.  Nancy Kulp plays her usual role as a man-loving plain jane, who wants to be one of Bob's lovely beauties.  Secretary Shultzy, played by Ann Davis, tolerates Bob's numerous escapades with a degree of her own humor.

Rosemary DeCamp plays Cumming's sister who lives with him and her grown son, who admires his uncle's success with beauty queens.  But Grandpa is steals the show whenever he is in it.",1357430400,17,967,4.748502994011976

8236775,5,B00104AYOC,"I ordered Love That Bob because I watch the Bob Cummings Show
back in the 1950's and I found out that Ann B Davis lived here

8236776,2,B00104AYOC,"The picture is rather grainy or fuzzy, the dialog rather hard to understand unless turned up. What was cutting edge comedy to us then (my wife and I watched it every week without fail) is just rather sad now and seldom elicits even a chuckle. Bob's over-the-top ""wolflike behavior"" isn't funny anymore. I'm unsure if this was a live audience show or dubbed laughter - sounds like the latter. Maybe it's just knowing the story of Bob Cummings life that dulls the comedy. I know it's not the comedy of the 50s that's no longer humorous because we still laugh every time we watch ""I Love Lucy"". As comedy entertainment I don't recommend it.",1401321600,3,637,4.5964912280701755
8236777,5,B00104AYOC,BOB CUMMINGS AND DWAYNE HICKMAN ARE REALLY WONDERFUL ACTORS. THIS WAS GOOD TO WATCH. HAD ME LAUGHING SO HARD. THANKS,1391817600,7,116,4.85
8236778,3,B00104AYOC,"Love That Bob is a hilarious series and Bob Cummings is at his best here, ably assisted by a wonderful supporting cast.  However, the episodes presented in this collection are in the public domain and so there is little motivation on the part of those who own the masters to re-issue them.  I was hoping for better quality on these DVDs but, unfortunately, that is not the case.  The transfers are from worn out 16mm prints that have obviously made the rounds too many times.  Worse, Alpha Home Video seems to think it has the right to implant a screen bug at certain intervals in the program.  There are many more episodes of The Bob Cummings Show that are copyright protected and it would be great if the company who owns them would release the entire series.  As it is, we have 15 episodes (there are actually 20 that are PD) of great show that is marred by sub-standard quality.",1391644800,14,882,4.48125
8236779,5,B00104AYOC,"Omg! Its just as i remember.  I watched this show as a child, and at the top of the show it would say ""Hold it I think you are going to like this picture"" we would stop and pose, lol, Do you know what I did the other day,I stopped and posed. Oh the memories. If you enjoyed it then you will cherish it for the memories. I recommend it.",1391558400,8,335,3.7857142857142856
