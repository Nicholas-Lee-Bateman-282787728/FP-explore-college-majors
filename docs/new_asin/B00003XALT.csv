1333751,2,B00003XALT,"Someone wrote they now see how porn once was made. Not true. I've seen porn from prior to motion pictures through early movies and later and this is not, never was, porn. It's just an old B movie with a little nudity in it. Story has some mild lesbian scenes and some T & A. It's kinda funny watching actresses in their mid to late 20's playing the parts of secondary school girls. Story is superficial and not well developed, but it's good, clean fun and your ears won't burn from the language. If you're a Prime customer, you may get a kick out of it. If you're thinking of buying it, I'd suggest saving your money because you won't see the star you might expect to see -- at least not at any recognizable age.",1411430400,2,712,4.242647058823529

1333754,4,B00003XALT,"Though it seems to be marketed as a b-grade 'naughty' film, it is really a classical love story/tragedy.  The style is more 1940's than 1960's, which combined with a couple of classical musical overtures gives it an even more classical feel.  Almost a Shakespearean coming of age movie.  Throw in a couple of nude scenes (more Venus de Milo than prurient), a topless appearance by young Georgina Spelvin (who later starred in the porn classic The Devil in Miss Jones), and I'm not sure what you have. Maybe a fine old-style melodrama with a just a touch of titillation.",1395705600,4,569,4.7272727272727275
1333755,2,B00003XALT,"Really, really old picture.  Very outdated.  Actors weren't very good looking and lines were at best spotty and choppy.  Would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1389830400,,162,5.153846153846154
1333756,1,B00003XALT,This was a bad movie couldn't finish watching it. That is all i have to say i didn't watch any more than the first 10 minutes.,1382659200,,126,3.8846153846153846
1333757,1,B00003XALT,I found this movie corny and boring.  There was too much censorship and little nudity. The only thing good about this film is it shows us how porn was made in the past.,1359158400,7,168,4.090909090909091
1333758,1,B00003XALT,"If you're buying this video because you're looking for Catherine Deneuve, be advised that not only is she not credited, but she is so young and the part is so small, you may have to view this several times to figure out who she is. The leads in this movie are VERY melodramatic and there are mild lesbian scenes in it as well (Catherine is not in any of them). Deneuve's talent, once you figure out who she is, is very apparent even at such a young age, but again, her part is so small, you may have to put your VCR on pause, just to get a glimpse of her face.",1029369600,34,560,4.008928571428571
7919522,5,B00003XALT,"Amazon Prime has the original it seems and not the American with additional unseeded material. Didn't think I'd like it, but kept my interest throughout. When a movie seems shorter than the actual length its a good move to me. Don't expect expensive sets, effects or stars. A good story is still a good story.",1461024000,,309,4.636363636363637
