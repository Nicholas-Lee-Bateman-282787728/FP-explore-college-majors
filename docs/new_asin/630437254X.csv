7869896,5,630437254X,"Vagabond Loafers - A good way to kick off the tape. If I had to be honest, I would say this is one of the more overrated Shemp shorts; of course, I think the Curly Howard original ""A Plumbing We Will Go"" is overrated as well. No big belly laughs, instead this short offers a good storyline with intermittent chuckles throughout.
3 1/2 stars

Pest Man Wins - Now we're talking. As far as big belly laughs go, nothing beats the ""clap and dance"" routine when that mouse goes down Vernon Dent's shirt. A remake of the Curly classic ""Ants in the Pantry"" and it very nearly tops the original. My only small complaint was the liberal amounts of stock footage used during the pie fight and that Shemp wasn't used in enough new shots at the end, but that's only a minor quibble.
4 1/2 stars

Three Dark Horses - Sometimes, less is more. Shot in only two rooms with the barest of props, the stooges manage to squeeze out another classic. Loaded with such rich gags as a toupee being sucked up inside a vacuum cleaner and the old, but reliable bird in the turkey gag, this short is a side splitter. Kudos also to Moe and Larry for that great conversation they have while cleaning up confetti. 5 stars

Overall, this is one of the best Shemp collections you can come by. I think only the ""Gents in a Jam"" and ""Dopey Dicks"" tapes exceed it in terms of quality. A 5 star tape.",1354752000,,1362,4.291828793774319
7869897,5,630437254X,"This is probably the best Three Stooges tape Columbia has made so far. I wish they would release all of Shemp's films, and some of Joe Besser's. Why release all of Curly's shorts, and not even half of Shemp's?
VAGABOND LOAFERS (1949) is the best short on the tape and my third favorite Three Stooges short. It's a remake of the Curly Classic A-PLUMBING WE WILL GO (1940) and even better than that one. This even has some recycled footage, with a brand new story line of Kenneth MacDonald and Christine McIntrye plotting to steal a painting. I find that the 1956 remake SCHEMING SCHEMERS is slightly better than this, but this is great also. A+
PEST MAN WINS (1951) is also a remake, this time of another Curly Classic ANTS IN THE PANTRY (1936) and once again, the remake is better. This even includes a pie fight, which includes stock footage of HALF-WITS HOLIDAY (1947) & IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE (1941). Most of the gags are the same as the original. The only problem is that the refreshment scene is a carbon copy of IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE. That doesn't take away the enjoyment of the rest of the short, though. A+
THREE DARK HORSES (1952) is another great short. The best part is when the Stooges are drinking coffee. Shemp puts in too much sugar, which is hilarious. I wish the short had more of a plot, but I guess the Stooges are just at their best in this one. A
Overall, I believe this is the best tape of the Stooges so far. The quality is excellent. If you want to laugh hard, GET THIS TAPE!",1006646400,4,1504,4.318021201413427
7869898,5,630437254X,"VAGABOND LOAFERS (1949) is a remake of the masterpiece Stooge short A PLUMBING WE WILL GO (1940). Remaking that classic could've been one of the worst ideas they ever thought of, but this remake turned out actually great. Despite Shemp copying Curly's maze-of-pipes routine, the rehashed scenes were done well, and the new sub-plot added in with the painting thieves was great. Not as good as the original, but still very good in its own right.
PEST MAN WINS (1951) is another remake, this time of ANTS IN THE PANTRY (1936). This may sound strange, but I actually think this remake is better than the original. While the original was great in it's own right, the short still moves at a bit of a slow pace. This remake is much faster paced, funnier, and has a hilarious pie-fight at the end. One of the very few remakes better than the original.
THREE DARK HORSES (1952) - This has very little plot, but still a classic. The opening scene with the Stooges getting into a fight, then wrecking that man's toupee is a riot, and what follows are very funny gags and scenes. They did a great job with very little material.
Overall, An excellent collection that is well worth watching.",994204800,3,1178,4.614285714285714
7869899,5,630437254X,"This video is definitly worth the money because it contains three of the best shorts from the Shemp Howard era. The first short, 'Vagabond Loafers', is about the Stooges work as ""The Day and Night Plumbers"" at a fancy party and try to stop a painting theft. The second short on this video, 'Pest Man Wins', is about the Stooges work as exterminators who get a job by planting mice, moths, etc. at a fancy custard party. The third short, 'Three Dark Horses', is about the Stooges who work for a campain manager. A must have for Stooge fans!",981244800,,539,4.454545454545454
7869900,3,630437254X,"These particular shorts may not be as well known as other Stooge comedies, even though two of these titles have familiar plots that were often used by the team. VAGABOND LOAFERS has the Stooges as plumbers who run afoul of art  thieves in a mansion. In PEST MAN WINS they invade another mansion, this  time as exterminators who bring their own pests. This one ends in a pie  fight that will be recognized instantly by Stooge fans (this is Shemp's  only pie battle). THREE DARK HORSES has a topical twist, with the Stooges  as delegates at a political convention. Between the novelty of these  seldom-seen titles and the cast's familiar antics, there's a good hour of  fun here for Stooge fans.",956793600,,693,4.677685950413223
