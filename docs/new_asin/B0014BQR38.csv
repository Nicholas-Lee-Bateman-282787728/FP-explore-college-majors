3128116,5,B0014BQR38,I could not understand why they canceled that show.  My husband and I loved it.  They do not come out with many westerns anymore.  Michael Biehn is a great actor and he had excellant co-stars.,1211500800,11,192,4.428571428571429
3128117,1,B0014BQR38,"Don't I feel like an idiot! I thought this new set combining both seasons would be fancier, spiffier, and basically re-created with ""more love"" for the show.

Instead, this set is simply the individual DVD cases of the previously released Season 1 and Season 2 sets placed into one box. It doesn't even take up less space on the shelf than the two individual seasons.

A disappointment and complete waste of money.

3128125,5,B0014BQR38,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" is a magnificent show.  I caught it on a local channel and it instantly grabbed my attention.  I immediately bought the DVD complete series and I've watched it over and over and will continue to do so.  I really like the way the characters are portrayed where their backgrounds are revealed in different episodes:  Vin reveals his memory of his mother in one episode as we see his protective way towards an older woman; or poor Ezra in the different storylines with his mother, and even Josiah's past.  Good dialogue and great acting, in my opinion.  There's always a main storyline with a couple of minor storylines going on at the same time.  But it doesn't get confusing.  It just allows up to enjoy the different characters and the situations they get themselves in.  But when they are needed, they all come together to fight the evil.

My only regret is that it lasted only two seasons.  I really wish those in power kept it on for a few more seasons.  I would have liked to have seen Vin clear his name with the help of the others; Ezra's mother become more caring for her son and even more storylines involving the two; the relationship with Buck and JD was great, but give me more; and in the last episode at the end, I do believe that Chris was softening more towards Mary and I would have loved to have seen that relationship develop more, even if it stayed as a friendship.  I felt the character of Chris could have developed even more.  But when a show ends, all this becomes a wish list and nothing more.

The DVD of the show is definitely worth having and at reasonable cost.  If you like a good Western, this is the one to have.",1490054400,5,1667,4.416393442622951

3128172,1,B0014BQR38,"Sorry, my friends!  This is one of the worst tv western series I have ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on.  I grew up in the fifties when westerns ruled the airwaves and have been a die hard fan all of my life.  I religiously watched the old series ""Maverick"", ""Have Gun Will Travel"", ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and ""Rawhide"" just to name a few.  And as I grew older I extended my appreciation to the classic western movies that came out in the 1940's, 1950's and early 1960's.  One of my favorites was the original ""Magnificent Seven"" starring You Brynner and Steve McQueen and directed by John Sturges.  Six years later I even found room in my heart for the sequel ""Return of the Seven""  even though it did not have quite the same emotional impact that the first movie did.  Both flicks were authentic in their depiction of the rugged hard type of men that made their living by being "" gunfighters for hire"".  Which brings me to the tv series ""The Magnificent Seven"".  I consider myself a true ""western aficionado' as I have been watching the genre my whole long life.  And I say without hesitation that this series is the most unauthentic piece of western drivel ever to come out of a television studio!  How dare they ruin the image of those two outstanding movies with Yul Brynner by offering up this weak and stupid tv imitation?  Like I said, in the movies the men were hardened professional gunfighters.  These oh-so-handsome tv  guys in the series wink and smile and wear such nice clean clothes to boot!  (Michael Biehn's outfit as the leader Chris ""Larrabee"" with his back pants, black shirt with gold buttons, long black duster-type coat and the wide rimmed black hat is so ridiculous it borders on parody.  All he need is a black mask and he could jump across studios and play ""Zorro""!)  My friends, I know television series may have certain limitations but too so inaccurately portray tough hardened gunfighters as such wimps is a disgrace.  Even Michael Biehn, when he tries to sound and act so much like a "" real mean baddie"" with an attitude comes across as nothing more but a shallow imposter to the authentic hardnosed Yul Brynner character from the movies.  Want to see a real western?  Rent the 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" movies.  And then move on to the most excellent James Stewart/ Anthony Mann contributions to the genre.  (Winchester '73"", ""The Naked Spur""  Bend in the River"" or ""The Man From Laramie'!)  Don't stop there!  Check the contributions by the masterful John Ford:  ""Stagecoach"", ""Red River"", ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""Fort Apache"" and so many others!  Want something a little more contemporary?  try ""The Last Train From Gun Hill"" with Kirk Douglas, or ""The Long Riders"" by Walter Hill.  Or even ""Tombstone"" with Kurt Russell aa Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as  Doc Holliday.  my friends, the lifelong pleasure I have derived from watching many many westerns stems in large part to the authenticity of the characters, plot and dialogue.  ""The Magnificent Seven"" for tv fails miserably on all three counts. And pretty much everything else.  Save your time and money and view instead ""real westerns"" where the directors and producers knew what they were doing.",1460937600,2,3199,4.714801444043322
3128173,5,B0014BQR38,VERY ENJOYABLE,1457395200,,14,6.5
3128174,5,B0014BQR38,I did not see this series in'98 & 99 when it originally aired but it played on a Western channel about 8 years ago.  I really found it very entertaining and I was very pleased with the DVD of the series.  I wish it had played a few years longer.,1456963200,,245,3.88
3128175,4,B0014BQR38,"This is an enjoyably descent episodic TV series that was cancelled before it came to a good conclusion. It has a nod to the original movie by placing Robert Vaughn in the cast not as a reluctant gun slinger but as a circuit judge. The cast is full of believable main characters (although they all seem to get beat up or wounded on a regular basis and end up in the next episode all healed up). The firearms depicted are true to the period as there did not seem to be any that were anachronistic for that time in the ""Old West"" and the story lines were fairly believable. There were a couple of plots that were left open which could have been closed up with another season, but that seems to be the way of commercial TV and ratings. Suck the viewers in and leave them hanging after the show is cancelled.",1450051200,5,803,4.254901960784314

3128191,5,B0014BQR38,I'm sorry I missed this on TV but I'm so happy to have it on DVD it's good wholesome Western entertainment.,1439769600,,107,4.142857142857143
3128192,3,B0014BQR38,"I hardly ever write reviews for something that gets 3 stars or a 6 outta 10 rating, but I'm going to give this a whirl. First, this is with out a doubt the worst VHS to DVD transfer I've ever viewed. So it looks like a decent VHS copy that you might have seen before this DVD release. Usually, bad video happens in dark scenes for low quality video, but here, it happens when the sun shines, and dark scenes are well presented, go figure. I am not a cinematographer or backroom editor to know why this phenomenon is occurring. I have hundreds of DVDs of movies and TV shows and this five disc set is the worst transfer I've ever seen. Even DVDs of movies and TV from 30 years earlier looks better. OK, we got the horrible out of the way, and it really does detract from the viewing, if you happen to be close to your HDTV. Sit back at least ten feet and the grainy video will blend much better, and you will start to forget about it. My desk is three feet from it and cannot escape it unless I head to the couch. I do not remember this show from the 1999 era, and can only assume it did not play on a major network. This may have something to do with the poor video quality, because it was aired on some new or defunct channel that did not put wonderful production values into the show. Nuff said there.

Secondly, There are characters here that obviously got me to purchase this show sight unseen, but after watching it, I'm not that impressed. If this show was produced today, I have no doubt that the stellar writing crews of today would pump this show full of sunshine and pep. Writing was definitely 1999'ish. Casting was a little iffy also. The goofy kid with the bowl hat could easily have been deleted. Laurie Holden was given absolutely nothing to do but look stunning in every scene, grainy or not(those eyes!). She had to wait ten years before she hit pay dirt with good writing on another #1 show. Michael B. wasn't as fun as I'd thought he'd be either. He was not giving me an ounce of his previous acting verve. A very monotone performance that maybe only Yul Brenner can pull off with that voice of his. That is a tough act to follow. Eric Close was a good addition, but again the writers need to give you something to work with. Anthony Starke's Ezra is maybe the best of the M7 crowd. Will the real Ron Perlman please stand up. Where was the voice that has made him famous? Again, Ron is under utilized here as the gritty strong guy with a gun. Just have him growl at bad guys. Nothing about him stands out. The cinematography is so poor, this also keeps everyone from achieving a persona that shines as their very own. All the characters are struggling to sparkle through the mud. Most all the characters just seem to be a meld of the 7 with little differentiation.

Thirdly, I've read a lot of the reviews and everyone generally loves the characters and is not really bothered by the goofy grains in the film. Not enough people complained about the inept video Q to keep me from purchasing. Am I being too picky?  I watched all of these M7's because I love westerns and who doesn't get inspired by that the best part of this M7, the theme song. You gotta love that, right? My other picky point, which for some reason didn't bother me in the movie because they only had to do it once, but not getting paid for all these wonderful things has got to make you rob a bank once in a while.

4thly, The best part of the M7 show is the bad guys. The casting for the bad guys was absolutely perfect. You have got to have real malevolent characters to push the drama down the highway. Most of these guys are REAL men, unlike the M7 Tv show boys. The movie M7 guys were real men, and that is the rub. Some of these great bad guys could have actually been better characters for the Magnificent 7. Most of the bad guys in the show are better character actors or just plain actors than the M7 gang. think about it. The M7 guys really try to make their part their own but it just comes across as a little vanilla, and in their defense, that is still a big script dilemma.

Lastly, This is a lot talk about a show I never heard of 'til I saw it for sale on Amazon, but if you are like me, and most of the other reviewers are too, real western lovers, even of the not-so-great TV westerns. The Q was so bad I almost returned it, but you all talked me out of it. Give it a try, don't sit too close, don't expect anything more than western fun, and don't think too hard.",1437350400,,4470,4.21120186697783

3128281,5,B0014BQR38,"For the years of 1999 and 2000 this is a very good western.  The writers stay true to the characters and his/her history and background.  And each individual characters contribution make for a Magnificent Seven.  There's Chris (Michael Biehn), the tortured soul who lost his wife and young son in a fire, ladies man Buck (Dale Midkiff), Vin(Eric Close) ex buffalo and bounty hunter then there is sometimes preacherman and always missionary son Josiah (Ron Perlman), gambler, son of a grifter/con-artist, Ezra (Anthony Starke), former slave and wanna-be doctor Nathan (Rick Worthy) and the youngest of them all J D. Dunn (Andrew Kavovit).  And the other supporting cast of Laurie Holden as Mary Travis, owner of the local newspaper and widowed mother whose son lives with his Grandfather, territorial Judge played by Robert Vaughn and Grandmother (that we never meet).  And Ezra's grifter/con-artist Mother played by Michelle Phillips.

As I said, I watch these shows over and over, It's not all shoot 'em up, but of course it is a western, but not a lot of blood and the fights are over quick. It's just a good, clean fun western series that should have lasted longer that it did.  My guess as to why it didn't last was not due to bad acting or story lines (all are good), it's that people have just lost interest in history and especially history of the west.  Do childred these days even believe in settlers, covered wagons and wagon trains?

I'm am very pleased with my purchase.",1305676800,10,1482,4.803149606299213
3128282,5,B0014BQR38,"As the other reviews say, the quality of the DVDs isn't what you've come to expect from DVDs nowadays. Check out an episode of M7 on Netflix Instant Play on your computer and that's the same quality you'll get on a 40"" LCD flatscreen.

But that's okay if you love this series - and what a great series it is. Two short seasons filled with memorable characters and plots (and surprising emotional depth) which are clean and safe for the kiddos to watch. The costumes appear historically accurate and the M7 are usually covered in dust and actually look like they really live in a desert region.

Michael Biehn does a superb job as usual, but especially so since he's recreating a character made famous by cool Yul Brynner. Eric Close and Andrew Kavovit are outstanding, while Dale Midkiff, Anthony Starke, Ron Perlman and Rick Worthy add their own unique characters to the mix with humor and flair. Laurie Holden as the main feminine presence in the show holds her own though she's not on screen much, while Robert Vaughn guests stars in a few episodes, the only original M7 member to appear in the show.

The series ends abruptly because the network cancelled it, so character development and plot lines are left wide open - which is aggravating because you really want to spend more time in Four Corners, yet it is preferable to end that way rather than have the series jump the shark and descend into the ridiculous, as most series do after the fifth season. Never mind - just enjoy it. You won't regret it.",1301270400,6,1509,4.602230483271375
3128283,4,B0014BQR38,"I remembered watching this series on TV quite a few years ago and liking it.  So I decided to buy it.  Now that I'm seeing it again, I realize that I'm fast falling in love with the same characters that I enjoyed the first time I watched it.  The cast is great and the characters are rich with depth.  You can't help but feel a connection to a lot of the characters.  While the title ""Magnificent Seven"" hypes them up to be superheroes of the Western sort, the series actually makes them very human.  They're not just good shots who are protecting a town out of the goodness of their hearts (initially).  But you get to see the transformation of these men from ""okay individuals"" into real people who mature over time, hunt down their own personal demons, or try to figure out who they really are.

The only thing that I was disappointed in, which was mentioned in other reviews, is the grainy quality to the show.  I've noticed that, every time there is a scene shot in full sun or with lots of light, the picture does get really grainy.  If you can look past that, it is still a great series and wonderfully written.  I have really enjoyed rewatching it.  Ezra is still probably my favorite character though it's hard to pick just one.",1297296000,6,1237,4.400881057268722
3128284,5,B0014BQR38,"Loved this show when it came out. Accidentially came across it Seasons 1 and 2 on Hulu. Watched the Pilot and have bought both seasons. This show was fantastic. Great sets, good acting, serious, funny, with good action thrown in.  Micheal Biehn, Eric Close, Dale Midkiff,Rick Worthy, Andy Kavovit, Ron Perlman and Anthony Starcke were a great cast, show should have gone on for many more seasons. Loved how they all brought something into the group, Biehn plays a renown gunfighter with a good heart but doesn't want to show it. Close a bounty hunter framed, quiet man with a purpose. Dale Midkiff is like a big kid but don't mess with him. Worthy is fantastic as Doc a healer, who favors knives. Andy Kavovit is hilarious as the new kid on the range naive but willing to learn. Ron Perlmas in great as the tortured man with religion in his heart but a dark side too. Anthony Starcke is hilarious as the gambler - one scene shows him teaching ladies of the evening how to ""walk"" with carriage. Has him walking down stairs with a book on his head, complete with gun/gun belt.  Would love to see them back together again in a made for TV movie! Big hit!",1295481600,3,1151,4.476190476190476

3128288,3,B0014BQR38,"Well other than the fact that Perlman has his stirrups rigged for a little fat kid, I find the show mediocre at best.
The only reason I'm going to buy season 2 is bcs of Starke's character Ezra.
Out of the whole show, that man is the most believable in his portrayal of his character.
I think he does an excellent job. Which makes me wonder why we haven't seen more of this guy in major stuff.
He's a wonderful actor & he's good looking. So why is Hollywood forcing such morons upon us as leading men when there's guys like this out there?
I'm a little jaded about westerns bcs we live on a ranch & whenever I watch one, my husband & I are always looking at the horses, tack, & the way the actors ride. The tack seems somewhat historically accurate. There were some pretty old saddles to see.
None of those actors could ride. Maybe they learned to ride in the 2nd season, who knows.
The show is way too idealistic & there just weren't that many senseless murders in the 'old west'.
But I expect that for a TV show & I suppose it's no big deal.
I must say that Perlman is playing such a creepy wierd guy he almost makes me cringe.
Bien looks so frigging silly in that outfit he's always wearing I can't help but bust out laughing during the credits when they show him trying to look all macho-which only makes him look more rediculous.
This J.D. kid is an unbelieveable idiot.
Buck is no ladies man that would ever attract me-ICK.
Vin Tanner is OK-his acting is almost as good as Starke's.
The Dr. guy is OK-but nothing to write home about.
Overall-the only saving grace for this show is the character Ezra Standish.",1260403200,3,1615,4.298360655737705

3128290,5,B0014BQR38,"They went all out on the costumes and the set design.  They also went all out when assembling a cast of good-looking actors.  The plots were well-written and they were not too rough or too sweet.  There was not tons of blood and guts or sex.

I have to admit that they were a little too idealistic when it came to the acceptance of women and minorities, but that is what made the show so good.  Everyone was accepted by the good-guys on the show.  For people who say it is not realistic enough, it is fiction and most people watch fiction to escape reality.  Wouldn't it be great if everyone treated people as well in real-life as they do on the Magnificent Seven?  You can always spot the bad guys and you can always count on the heroes to come through in the end.

Like my title says, it is a great feel-good, pick-me-up.  When I am feeling down I pop one of those DVDs into my player and I am rescued from the blues by seven magnificent men and one spunky woman.  It is not a show for fans of the original series because aside from a few similarities it is a completely different show.  It was not meant to be a heavy show, it was meant to be fun.

The casting was great and each character played well off each other. You could see the brotherhood even though each man had his own cross to bear. The stories were well written, and I found myelf loving the way the 7 garnered respect and fear from those who simply heard of their reputation. They weren't always hard men, and they weren't always right; the show gives you the gritty look of the old west, the hardships and what it took to make it through a day sometimes.

You want to sit back and watch a good series; another series that should have had a longer shelf life, then buy this series and enjoy. There are  so many little things to see, as one character is checking his gun and he flips it over his hands several times before slipping into his gun belt. Not a big scene, just something you catch and it's way cool. The Western Channel marathoned it this past Saturday......but I bought it because anyday it's worth watching again!

3128311,4,B0014BQR38,"First, a review of the series itself:  5 gigantic gold, gleaming stars.  I caught a few re-run episodes on Encore Westerns and fell in love instantly.  Amazing cast, phenomenal acting, great sets, and no gore.  It achieves that delicate balance of drama and adventure of the genre without the violence and sex that plagues most modern movies/show today. I really credit whoever cast the series because each actor shines in his role and their personalities play off each other perfectly.  I am saddened that the series was cut off after two (all too short) seasons and was floored when I heard that it only came back a second year after an intense fan campaign.  Once again primtime networks don't know a truly good show when they see it.

So why 4 stars?  I was very disappointed at the picture quality of the DVDs.  In the age of digital media when consumers are seeking crystal clear imaging, this set has the graininess of a VHS.  Acceptable for an old show of the 60's or 70's, but one that aired in 1999? No way. The quality of the current TV re-runs far exceedes these DVDs.  Apparently this is just a re-packaging of the individually sold seasons so I can't imagine that purchasing them separately would be any improvement.

That said, don't pass up the series on that account.  Better to have it available with a sub-quality picture than not have it it all.  The subperb show itself far outweighs this one downfall and I look forward to re-watching both seasons again and again.",1225152000,66,1486,4.64367816091954

3128313,5,B0014BQR38,"Let's start with the:

Pros: Action packed. Tight-story. Plots and sub-plots gets resolved by the end of the story. Good production values. Michael Biehn was a good fit to lead this heroic posse.

Cons: No matter how many times these guys roll on the dust, jump to a pit or anything that has to do with grime and dirt, they always stand up looking spick and span... super-clean. This removes the realism from the story. No bonus materials on the DVD!

The box set comes in 6 discs in 4 slim packs (thin packs). Easy to fit in your DVD shelf. Even if you are not a fun of western shows but prefer action ones, then this show will not disappoint. There's oodles of it from start to finish.

This is a wonderful western. I have loved every minute of it.
First, there is the eye candy that is very lovely to look at. Wouldn't it be great to live in a west with men who looked and acted like this LOL?
Second, it has little bad language and the gore factor is nil. I realize that a real-life cowboy in a gunfight would not say, ""Oh dang!!"", but I get the idea. I know that in a real gunfight, knifefight or fistfight there will be blood, guts and broken bones, but I don't really want to watch it happen. I realize that in real life the ""ladies of the night"" wouldn't be beautiful and sweet, but I don't really want to see the real thing.
My tv shows are my escape FROM life. And this one has succeeded wonderfully.

3362622,5,B0014BQR38,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" is a magnificent show.  I caught it on a local channel and it instantly grabbed my attention.  I immediately bought the DVD complete series and I've watched it over and over and will continue to do so.  I really like the way the characters are portrayed where their backgrounds are revealed in different episodes:  Vin reveals his memory of his mother in one episode as we see his protective way towards an older woman; or poor Ezra in the different storylines with his mother, and even Josiah's past.  Good dialogue and great acting, in my opinion.  There's always a main storyline with a couple of minor storylines going on at the same time.  But it doesn't get confusing.  It just allows up to enjoy the different characters and the situations they get themselves in.  But when they are needed, they all come together to fight the evil.

My only regret is that it lasted only two seasons.  I really wish those in power kept it on for a few more seasons.  I would have liked to have seen Vin clear his name with the help of the others; Ezra's mother become more caring for her son and even more storylines involving the two; the relationship with Buck and JD was great, but give me more; and in the last episode at the end, I do believe that Chris was softening more towards Mary and I would have loved to have seen that relationship develop more, even if it stayed as a friendship.  I felt the character of Chris could have developed even more.  But when a show ends, all this becomes a wish list and nothing more.

The DVD of the show is definitely worth having and at reasonable cost.  If you like a good Western, this is the one to have.",1490054400,5,1667,4.416393442622951

3362669,1,B0014BQR38,"Sorry, my friends!  This is one of the worst tv western series I have ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on.  I grew up in the fifties when westerns ruled the airwaves and have been a die hard fan all of my life.  I religiously watched the old series ""Maverick"", ""Have Gun Will Travel"", ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and ""Rawhide"" just to name a few.  And as I grew older I extended my appreciation to the classic western movies that came out in the 1940's, 1950's and early 1960's.  One of my favorites was the original ""Magnificent Seven"" starring You Brynner and Steve McQueen and directed by John Sturges.  Six years later I even found room in my heart for the sequel ""Return of the Seven""  even though it did not have quite the same emotional impact that the first movie did.  Both flicks were authentic in their depiction of the rugged hard type of men that made their living by being "" gunfighters for hire"".  Which brings me to the tv series ""The Magnificent Seven"".  I consider myself a true ""western aficionado' as I have been watching the genre my whole long life.  And I say without hesitation that this series is the most unauthentic piece of western drivel ever to come out of a television studio!  How dare they ruin the image of those two outstanding movies with Yul Brynner by offering up this weak and stupid tv imitation?  Like I said, in the movies the men were hardened professional gunfighters.  These oh-so-handsome tv  guys in the series wink and smile and wear such nice clean clothes to boot!  (Michael Biehn's outfit as the leader Chris ""Larrabee"" with his back pants, black shirt with gold buttons, long black duster-type coat and the wide rimmed black hat is so ridiculous it borders on parody.  All he need is a black mask and he could jump across studios and play ""Zorro""!)  My friends, I know television series may have certain limitations but too so inaccurately portray tough hardened gunfighters as such wimps is a disgrace.  Even Michael Biehn, when he tries to sound and act so much like a "" real mean baddie"" with an attitude comes across as nothing more but a shallow imposter to the authentic hardnosed Yul Brynner character from the movies.  Want to see a real western?  Rent the 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" movies.  And then move on to the most excellent James Stewart/ Anthony Mann contributions to the genre.  (Winchester '73"", ""The Naked Spur""  Bend in the River"" or ""The Man From Laramie'!)  Don't stop there!  Check the contributions by the masterful John Ford:  ""Stagecoach"", ""Red River"", ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""Fort Apache"" and so many others!  Want something a little more contemporary?  try ""The Last Train From Gun Hill"" with Kirk Douglas, or ""The Long Riders"" by Walter Hill.  Or even ""Tombstone"" with Kurt Russell aa Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as  Doc Holliday.  my friends, the lifelong pleasure I have derived from watching many many westerns stems in large part to the authenticity of the characters, plot and dialogue.  ""The Magnificent Seven"" for tv fails miserably on all three counts. And pretty much everything else.  Save your time and money and view instead ""real westerns"" where the directors and producers knew what they were doing.",1460937600,2,3199,4.714801444043322

3362671,5,B0014BQR38,I did not see this series in'98 & 99 when it originally aired but it played on a Western channel about 8 years ago.  I really found it very entertaining and I was very pleased with the DVD of the series.  I wish it had played a few years longer.,1456963200,,245,3.88
3362672,4,B0014BQR38,"This is an enjoyably descent episodic TV series that was cancelled before it came to a good conclusion. It has a nod to the original movie by placing Robert Vaughn in the cast not as a reluctant gun slinger but as a circuit judge. The cast is full of believable main characters (although they all seem to get beat up or wounded on a regular basis and end up in the next episode all healed up). The firearms depicted are true to the period as there did not seem to be any that were anachronistic for that time in the ""Old West"" and the story lines were fairly believable. There were a couple of plots that were left open which could have been closed up with another season, but that seems to be the way of commercial TV and ratings. Suck the viewers in and leave them hanging after the show is cancelled.",1450051200,5,803,4.254901960784314

3362689,3,B0014BQR38,"I hardly ever write reviews for something that gets 3 stars or a 6 outta 10 rating, but I'm going to give this a whirl. First, this is with out a doubt the worst VHS to DVD transfer I've ever viewed. So it looks like a decent VHS copy that you might have seen before this DVD release. Usually, bad video happens in dark scenes for low quality video, but here, it happens when the sun shines, and dark scenes are well presented, go figure. I am not a cinematographer or backroom editor to know why this phenomenon is occurring. I have hundreds of DVDs of movies and TV shows and this five disc set is the worst transfer I've ever seen. Even DVDs of movies and TV from 30 years earlier looks better. OK, we got the horrible out of the way, and it really does detract from the viewing, if you happen to be close to your HDTV. Sit back at least ten feet and the grainy video will blend much better, and you will start to forget about it. My desk is three feet from it and cannot escape it unless I head to the couch. I do not remember this show from the 1999 era, and can only assume it did not play on a major network. This may have something to do with the poor video quality, because it was aired on some new or defunct channel that did not put wonderful production values into the show. Nuff said there.

Secondly, There are characters here that obviously got me to purchase this show sight unseen, but after watching it, I'm not that impressed. If this show was produced today, I have no doubt that the stellar writing crews of today would pump this show full of sunshine and pep. Writing was definitely 1999'ish. Casting was a little iffy also. The goofy kid with the bowl hat could easily have been deleted. Laurie Holden was given absolutely nothing to do but look stunning in every scene, grainy or not(those eyes!). She had to wait ten years before she hit pay dirt with good writing on another #1 show. Michael B. wasn't as fun as I'd thought he'd be either. He was not giving me an ounce of his previous acting verve. A very monotone performance that maybe only Yul Brenner can pull off with that voice of his. That is a tough act to follow. Eric Close was a good addition, but again the writers need to give you something to work with. Anthony Starke's Ezra is maybe the best of the M7 crowd. Will the real Ron Perlman please stand up. Where was the voice that has made him famous? Again, Ron is under utilized here as the gritty strong guy with a gun. Just have him growl at bad guys. Nothing about him stands out. The cinematography is so poor, this also keeps everyone from achieving a persona that shines as their very own. All the characters are struggling to sparkle through the mud. Most all the characters just seem to be a meld of the 7 with little differentiation.

Thirdly, I've read a lot of the reviews and everyone generally loves the characters and is not really bothered by the goofy grains in the film. Not enough people complained about the inept video Q to keep me from purchasing. Am I being too picky?  I watched all of these M7's because I love westerns and who doesn't get inspired by that the best part of this M7, the theme song. You gotta love that, right? My other picky point, which for some reason didn't bother me in the movie because they only had to do it once, but not getting paid for all these wonderful things has got to make you rob a bank once in a while.

4thly, The best part of the M7 show is the bad guys. The casting for the bad guys was absolutely perfect. You have got to have real malevolent characters to push the drama down the highway. Most of these guys are REAL men, unlike the M7 Tv show boys. The movie M7 guys were real men, and that is the rub. Some of these great bad guys could have actually been better characters for the Magnificent 7. Most of the bad guys in the show are better character actors or just plain actors than the M7 gang. think about it. The M7 guys really try to make their part their own but it just comes across as a little vanilla, and in their defense, that is still a big script dilemma.

Lastly, This is a lot talk about a show I never heard of 'til I saw it for sale on Amazon, but if you are like me, and most of the other reviewers are too, real western lovers, even of the not-so-great TV westerns. The Q was so bad I almost returned it, but you all talked me out of it. Give it a try, don't sit too close, don't expect anything more than western fun, and don't think too hard.",1437350400,,4470,4.21120186697783

3362778,5,B0014BQR38,"For the years of 1999 and 2000 this is a very good western.  The writers stay true to the characters and his/her history and background.  And each individual characters contribution make for a Magnificent Seven.  There's Chris (Michael Biehn), the tortured soul who lost his wife and young son in a fire, ladies man Buck (Dale Midkiff), Vin(Eric Close) ex buffalo and bounty hunter then there is sometimes preacherman and always missionary son Josiah (Ron Perlman), gambler, son of a grifter/con-artist, Ezra (Anthony Starke), former slave and wanna-be doctor Nathan (Rick Worthy) and the youngest of them all J D. Dunn (Andrew Kavovit).  And the other supporting cast of Laurie Holden as Mary Travis, owner of the local newspaper and widowed mother whose son lives with his Grandfather, territorial Judge played by Robert Vaughn and Grandmother (that we never meet).  And Ezra's grifter/con-artist Mother played by Michelle Phillips.

As I said, I watch these shows over and over, It's not all shoot 'em up, but of course it is a western, but not a lot of blood and the fights are over quick. It's just a good, clean fun western series that should have lasted longer that it did.  My guess as to why it didn't last was not due to bad acting or story lines (all are good), it's that people have just lost interest in history and especially history of the west.  Do childred these days even believe in settlers, covered wagons and wagon trains?

I'm am very pleased with my purchase.",1305676800,10,1482,4.803149606299213
3362779,5,B0014BQR38,"As the other reviews say, the quality of the DVDs isn't what you've come to expect from DVDs nowadays. Check out an episode of M7 on Netflix Instant Play on your computer and that's the same quality you'll get on a 40"" LCD flatscreen.

But that's okay if you love this series - and what a great series it is. Two short seasons filled with memorable characters and plots (and surprising emotional depth) which are clean and safe for the kiddos to watch. The costumes appear historically accurate and the M7 are usually covered in dust and actually look like they really live in a desert region.

Michael Biehn does a superb job as usual, but especially so since he's recreating a character made famous by cool Yul Brynner. Eric Close and Andrew Kavovit are outstanding, while Dale Midkiff, Anthony Starke, Ron Perlman and Rick Worthy add their own unique characters to the mix with humor and flair. Laurie Holden as the main feminine presence in the show holds her own though she's not on screen much, while Robert Vaughn guests stars in a few episodes, the only original M7 member to appear in the show.

The series ends abruptly because the network cancelled it, so character development and plot lines are left wide open - which is aggravating because you really want to spend more time in Four Corners, yet it is preferable to end that way rather than have the series jump the shark and descend into the ridiculous, as most series do after the fifth season. Never mind - just enjoy it. You won't regret it.",1301270400,6,1509,4.602230483271375
3362780,4,B0014BQR38,"I remembered watching this series on TV quite a few years ago and liking it.  So I decided to buy it.  Now that I'm seeing it again, I realize that I'm fast falling in love with the same characters that I enjoyed the first time I watched it.  The cast is great and the characters are rich with depth.  You can't help but feel a connection to a lot of the characters.  While the title ""Magnificent Seven"" hypes them up to be superheroes of the Western sort, the series actually makes them very human.  They're not just good shots who are protecting a town out of the goodness of their hearts (initially).  But you get to see the transformation of these men from ""okay individuals"" into real people who mature over time, hunt down their own personal demons, or try to figure out who they really are.

The only thing that I was disappointed in, which was mentioned in other reviews, is the grainy quality to the show.  I've noticed that, every time there is a scene shot in full sun or with lots of light, the picture does get really grainy.  If you can look past that, it is still a great series and wonderfully written.  I have really enjoyed rewatching it.  Ezra is still probably my favorite character though it's hard to pick just one.",1297296000,6,1237,4.400881057268722
3362781,5,B0014BQR38,"Loved this show when it came out. Accidentially came across it Seasons 1 and 2 on Hulu. Watched the Pilot and have bought both seasons. This show was fantastic. Great sets, good acting, serious, funny, with good action thrown in.  Micheal Biehn, Eric Close, Dale Midkiff,Rick Worthy, Andy Kavovit, Ron Perlman and Anthony Starcke were a great cast, show should have gone on for many more seasons. Loved how they all brought something into the group, Biehn plays a renown gunfighter with a good heart but doesn't want to show it. Close a bounty hunter framed, quiet man with a purpose. Dale Midkiff is like a big kid but don't mess with him. Worthy is fantastic as Doc a healer, who favors knives. Andy Kavovit is hilarious as the new kid on the range naive but willing to learn. Ron Perlmas in great as the tortured man with religion in his heart but a dark side too. Anthony Starcke is hilarious as the gambler - one scene shows him teaching ladies of the evening how to ""walk"" with carriage. Has him walking down stairs with a book on his head, complete with gun/gun belt.  Would love to see them back together again in a made for TV movie! Big hit!",1295481600,3,1151,4.476190476190476

3362785,3,B0014BQR38,"Well other than the fact that Perlman has his stirrups rigged for a little fat kid, I find the show mediocre at best.
The only reason I'm going to buy season 2 is bcs of Starke's character Ezra.
Out of the whole show, that man is the most believable in his portrayal of his character.
I think he does an excellent job. Which makes me wonder why we haven't seen more of this guy in major stuff.
He's a wonderful actor & he's good looking. So why is Hollywood forcing such morons upon us as leading men when there's guys like this out there?
I'm a little jaded about westerns bcs we live on a ranch & whenever I watch one, my husband & I are always looking at the horses, tack, & the way the actors ride. The tack seems somewhat historically accurate. There were some pretty old saddles to see.
None of those actors could ride. Maybe they learned to ride in the 2nd season, who knows.
The show is way too idealistic & there just weren't that many senseless murders in the 'old west'.
But I expect that for a TV show & I suppose it's no big deal.
I must say that Perlman is playing such a creepy wierd guy he almost makes me cringe.
Bien looks so frigging silly in that outfit he's always wearing I can't help but bust out laughing during the credits when they show him trying to look all macho-which only makes him look more rediculous.
This J.D. kid is an unbelieveable idiot.
Buck is no ladies man that would ever attract me-ICK.
Vin Tanner is OK-his acting is almost as good as Starke's.
The Dr. guy is OK-but nothing to write home about.
Overall-the only saving grace for this show is the character Ezra Standish.",1260403200,3,1615,4.298360655737705

3362787,5,B0014BQR38,"They went all out on the costumes and the set design.  They also went all out when assembling a cast of good-looking actors.  The plots were well-written and they were not too rough or too sweet.  There was not tons of blood and guts or sex.

I have to admit that they were a little too idealistic when it came to the acceptance of women and minorities, but that is what made the show so good.  Everyone was accepted by the good-guys on the show.  For people who say it is not realistic enough, it is fiction and most people watch fiction to escape reality.  Wouldn't it be great if everyone treated people as well in real-life as they do on the Magnificent Seven?  You can always spot the bad guys and you can always count on the heroes to come through in the end.

Like my title says, it is a great feel-good, pick-me-up.  When I am feeling down I pop one of those DVDs into my player and I am rescued from the blues by seven magnificent men and one spunky woman.  It is not a show for fans of the original series because aside from a few similarities it is a completely different show.  It was not meant to be a heavy show, it was meant to be fun.  If you just want to sit down and not be too serious this is the show for you.",1255737600,12,1229,4.070833333333334

no excessive violence, gore or up front sex......it has no chance on
our networks!  These actor made the perfect cast, this show was one of
the best feel good Westerns where the good guys won and did so with
at what you could feel was honor.  Of course it wasn't given a chance,
isnt that the way it still is today?  I've ended my days of watching
T.V. shows, especially on the networks because as soon as you invest
in them, they are gone.  Thank you for packaging this series, and thank
you to the Western Channel for bringing it back to T.V.  Now, if only

The casting was great and each character played well off each other. You could see the brotherhood even though each man had his own cross to bear. The stories were well written, and I found myelf loving the way the 7 garnered respect and fear from those who simply heard of their reputation. They weren't always hard men, and they weren't always right; the show gives you the gritty look of the old west, the hardships and what it took to make it through a day sometimes.

You want to sit back and watch a good series; another series that should have had a longer shelf life, then buy this series and enjoy. There are  so many little things to see, as one character is checking his gun and he flips it over his hands several times before slipping into his gun belt. Not a big scene, just something you catch and it's way cool. The Western Channel marathoned it this past Saturday......but I bought it because anyday it's worth watching again!

3362808,4,B0014BQR38,"First, a review of the series itself:  5 gigantic gold, gleaming stars.  I caught a few re-run episodes on Encore Westerns and fell in love instantly.  Amazing cast, phenomenal acting, great sets, and no gore.  It achieves that delicate balance of drama and adventure of the genre without the violence and sex that plagues most modern movies/show today. I really credit whoever cast the series because each actor shines in his role and their personalities play off each other perfectly.  I am saddened that the series was cut off after two (all too short) seasons and was floored when I heard that it only came back a second year after an intense fan campaign.  Once again primtime networks don't know a truly good show when they see it.

So why 4 stars?  I was very disappointed at the picture quality of the DVDs.  In the age of digital media when consumers are seeking crystal clear imaging, this set has the graininess of a VHS.  Acceptable for an old show of the 60's or 70's, but one that aired in 1999? No way. The quality of the current TV re-runs far exceedes these DVDs.  Apparently this is just a re-packaging of the individually sold seasons so I can't imagine that purchasing them separately would be any improvement.

That said, don't pass up the series on that account.  Better to have it available with a sub-quality picture than not have it it all.  The subperb show itself far outweighs this one downfall and I look forward to re-watching both seasons again and again.",1225152000,66,1486,4.64367816091954

3362810,5,B0014BQR38,"Let's start with the:

Pros: Action packed. Tight-story. Plots and sub-plots gets resolved by the end of the story. Good production values. Michael Biehn was a good fit to lead this heroic posse.

Cons: No matter how many times these guys roll on the dust, jump to a pit or anything that has to do with grime and dirt, they always stand up looking spick and span... super-clean. This removes the realism from the story. No bonus materials on the DVD!

The box set comes in 6 discs in 4 slim packs (thin packs). Easy to fit in your DVD shelf. Even if you are not a fun of western shows but prefer action ones, then this show will not disappoint. There's oodles of it from start to finish.

Who said the West can't still be won even at this era? The Magnificent Seven just proved... it can be done.",1221782400,3,796,4.286666666666667

This is a wonderful western. I have loved every minute of it.
First, there is the eye candy that is very lovely to look at. Wouldn't it be great to live in a west with men who looked and acted like this LOL?
Second, it has little bad language and the gore factor is nil. I realize that a real-life cowboy in a gunfight would not say, ""Oh dang!!"", but I get the idea. I know that in a real gunfight, knifefight or fistfight there will be blood, guts and broken bones, but I don't really want to watch it happen. I realize that in real life the ""ladies of the night"" wouldn't be beautiful and sweet, but I don't really want to see the real thing.
My tv shows are my escape FROM life. And this one has succeeded wonderfully.
