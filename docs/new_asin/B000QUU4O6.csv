8197687,5,B000QUU4O6,"Omar Sharif introduces his audience to Pharaoh Tutankhamun, ""living image of the (God) Amum.""  His original name was Tutankhaten, ""living image of the (""heretical"" Sun God) Aten.""  Tutankhamun's life was cut short around the age of 19 in circumstances that remain a mystery to this day.  As Sharif rightly reminds his viewers, Tutankhamun was a minor, mostly forgotten Pharaoh in the history of Ancient Egypt until the beginning of the 20th century C.E.  Tutankhamun's main claim to fame is the treasure that was mostly found intact in his tomb.  With the assistance of renowned Egyptologists Zahi Hawass, David Silverman, and Kathlyn Cooney, Sharif explains how Egyptologist Howard Carter and his team finally found the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922 C.E. in the Valley of the Kings close to modern-day Luxor.  These Egyptologists and Sharif give the audience an overview of the artifacts that form the core of the itinerant exhibition about the treasures of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun and other outstanding Pharaohs.  These artifacts of Tutankhamun's tomb that are currently on display in Atlanta represent only a small fraction of all the objects found in his tomb.  For all its merits, the ""Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs"" DVD cannot be a substitute for standing in front of these exquisite artifacts.  These artifacts will continue to mesmerize many generations to come.",1231113600,,1385,5.202702702702703
