1923558,5,B0000DC154,"""Coupling"" is an absolutely marvellous treat for all people who like comedies - I'd NEVER laughed so hard watching any shows but this Britcom is just amazing.  The scripts are very well written, the dialogues witty, the storylines full of twists and turns, the actors/actresses perfectly chosen for their roles - and the quality of the show is quite equally high from one episode to another.  If you think ""Friends"" is good, watch ""Coupling"" and you'd know what exceptionally good is.",1071014400,2,484,4.962962962962963
1923559,5,B0000DC154,"I got hooked on this show watching BBC America in its first season and it quickly became my favorite show of all time. Unfortunately, the American copy didn't work at all, but this DVD is a must have in any comedy enthusiast's collection. The comparison to a cross between 'Friends' and 'Sex and the City' doesn't do it justice. This series is fresh, witty and sometimes a little raunchy, but I've never laughed so hard!  The writing and cast are superb and I can't wait for Series 3 on DVD!",1069113600,3,491,4.455555555555556
1923560,5,B0000DC154,"I have not seen the DVD version but I have seen every episode.  This is our favorite British Comedy!!!  I enjoy Friends but I never laugh this hard.  My husband almost hurt himself laughing at poor neurotic Jeff doing his blindfolded strip tease for his ""surprise"" birthday party!!!  Much wittier than Friends could be.  The storylines in each episode are great!!!  They are so convoluded with twist and turns.  The American/NBC version was absolutely painful for us to watch..we wrote to NBC to complain!  PLease don't compare the American version to the original - they are apples and oranges.  The original is fantastic and I've ordered mine!! Can't wait til Christmas on this one!",1067040000,17,684,4.9298245614035086
1923591,5,B0000DC154,"If even you were to watch these episodes out of order, there is no way you could possibly get lost!  You could start in the middle of Season 2 and still find your way back to the start; all of it still making perfect sense!  That's the brilliance of Steven Moffat!  This show is a breath of fresh air in all aspects of a sitcom.  Steven Moffat has been very creative about the way each episode is shot, and giving the viewer the sensation of almost being in that position yourself.  He take's our mundane day to day activities from men and women and makes me look at things in a wetting your trousers perspective or pissing myself silly with laughter!  Seasons 3 & 4 are ingeniously well written and shot cinemetography speaking.  The plot line is just as funny and he hasn't missed a beat yet!  Steven Moffat's my idol!",1103673600,2,820,4.3841059602649
1923592,5,B0000DC154,"When someone asked me about Coupling, I told them, ""It's like Friends plus Sex in the City, only funny.""  A snide remark, I know, but what can you say?  American sit-coms give us gags; British sit-coms give us wit, humor, and outrageous laughter.

I fear, though, that Coupling is over.  The original six actors were, taken together, perfection - like the various strains of point and counter-point in Bach or Mozart.  But then, tragically for the fans, Richard Coyle (Jeff) left the series.  The remaining five, plus the new character, ""Oliver,"" kept it up bravely and well, but, in the end, Coyle's departure, depriving us as it does of Jeff, removed an absolutely essential 1/6th of the recipe.  Oliver is good, don't get me wrong, but Jeff somehow was essential.  To Richard Coyle, all I can say is ""OH, Jeffrey!!""

To potential collectors, you won't regret buying any of these seasons, though.",1103500800,2,898,4.855263157894737
1923593,5,B0000DC154,"The American version of ""Coupling,"" the British comedy that is their version of ""Friends,"" was a big disaster, which only goes to prove Shavian adage that the Americans and British are a people separated by a common language.  Yes, when you start watch the first episodes you will quickly figure out which character on ""Coupling"" matches up with who on ""Friends,"" but that takes about five minutes.

Steve Taylor (Jack Davenport) is Ross, without the Ph. D. in paleontology, who has just started dating Susan Walker (Sarah Alexander), who certainly is more confident about living in the real world than Rachel. Jane Christie (Gina Bellman) is decidedly quirky like Phoebe, but without the loveable cuteness or the innate sense of compassion, and Sally Harper (Kate Isitt) is psychotic about her appearance the way Monica is about cleanliness. Jeff Murdock (Richard Coyle) thinks about sex as much as Joey but without any of the success because of an extraordinary ability to always say the wrong thing, which makes it odd that Patrick Maitland (Ben Miles) ends up being the Chandler figure since he is apparently a sex god (or sex ""donkey"").  But by the second or third episode of the first series (what we in the Colonies call a season) you should be able to deal with ""Coupling"" on its own terms.

The biggest difference between ""Coupling"" and ""Friends"" is the preoccupation with sex. ""Coupling"" only had six episodes in its first series and if you took the first season of ""Friends"" and selectively cut it down to only six episodes it would not be as much about sex as these episodes on ""Coupling.""  A plotline about a job interview turns into being about sex.  Everybody goes to a funeral and that turns into being about sex as well.  By the end of the first series you will not be thinking about ""Friends"" any more, but about ""Sex in the City"" as the more fitting comparison.

The six episodes from the first series are as follows: ""Flushed"" has Steve trying to break up with Jane, and one of the most unusual circumstances for arranging for a date you have ever seen as Steve and Susan first hook up. ""Size Matters"" has Sally seeing Patrick in a new way, or, to be more accurate, hoping to see Patrick in a new way. ""Sex, Death and Nudity"" has the gang showing up en masse at the funeral of Jane's aunt, although exactly who is with whom and what their relationship is for public consumption is not clear. ""Inferno"" is about the elephant in the living room at Steve and Susan's dinner party, namely the porn tape that Susan discovered in Steve's magazine. ""The Girl with Two Breasts"" has Jeff successfully having a conversation with a beautiful woman who still likes him, but that is because she is from Israel and only speaks Hebrew. The first series comes to an end with ""The Cupboard of Patrick's Love,"" where it seems one of his collection of videotapes of his bedroom activities has the name ""Susan"" on it.  The first series almost ended on a rather sweet note, but then they went for the gag, which is the whole object of ""Coupling.""

The second series offers up nine episodes: ""The Man With Two Legs"" highlights Jeff's inability to avoid saying the wrong thing to a pretty woman.  ""My Dinner in Hell"" has Steve convinced Susan's parents are making fun of his, uh, recreation practices.  Steve has a different problem in ""Her Best Friend's Bottom,"" in which he accidentally sees Sally naked.  ""The Melty Man Cometh"" has Steve and Jeff explaining the causes of impotence to Patrick.  ""Jane and the Truth Snake"" has Jane taking pills after being fired, which only results in her creating a snake puppet that insists on telling the truth.  ""Gotcha"" has Steve and Susan at a fancy dinner for their first anniversary and the question is whether Steve will pop the question.  ""Dressed"" has Jane at a dinner party where she is wearing nothing under her raincoat and Steve upset that Susan is pretending to be Patrick's trophy wife.  In ""Naked,"" Jeff has finally found a woman who also blurts out the wrong thing all the time, but unfortunately she is a senior manager at his firm.  ""The End of the Line"" has Steve and Susan's relationship in trouble because of a woman named Giselle and a bar in Australia that Susan thinks is named in honor of her trip Down Under (it is complicated, which is the whole point of the comic confusion).

The bottom line is that I find ""Coupling"" funny, as in laugh out funny, which is not something I usually do (unless watching the nightly news).  The fact that two series still amount to less episodes than you get with a season of an American sitcom works to the show's advantage.  Basically creator Steven Moffat, who based the Steve and Sue relationship on dating his own wife, only writes scripts if he comes up with good ideas, so it is not just that the best episodes are hysterical but that the worst episodes are still at least a bit above average.  Yes, this is a decidedly British situation comedy, but there is something compelling about this approach to combining sex and humor when compared to the drivel of most American comedies.",1101945600,2,5083,4.668533034714446
1923594,5,B0000DC154,"I caught this show on the local PBS station and immediately fell in love with it. Baudy without being vulgar it is a laugh riot from start to finish. The only drawback is the number of episodes. Evidently, British TV does not run on a strict new episode every week format. So both season one and two together have fewer episodes than one season of a typical American TV show. But it does make up in quality what it lacks in quantity.

I highly recommend the seris",1095897600,5,463,4.32183908045977
1923595,5,B0000DC154,"If you like Friends and Sex in the City, you'll love Coupling.  It's the funniest, smartest, most original comedy I've seen in a long time.  My husband and I love to watch it together so it appeals to men and women alike.
The cast is brilliant!  The characters and the situations they find themselves in could easily become silly and annoying.  However, the excellent actors make their quirky characters both human and endearing.  (There was an attempt at an American version and it flopped because of the lousy actors, in my opinion.)
I've watched each episode at least two times and they still crack me up.  This is a definite must-have.",1087171200,,639,4.711711711711712
1923596,5,B0000DC154,"Those are a few of the many baffling and hilarious ""Jeffisms"" featured in seasons one and two.  Coupling is one of my all-time favorite shows, with brilliant writing and a solid cast.  The actors have come to really own their characters, increasing in emotional depth with each episode (be sure to check out season three, coming out soon).  Over and over, I have enjoyed...
-Steve's rants (""You do not need padding to tackle upholstery!"")
-Susan's dry wit (""Lucky you didn't bump into any goats"")
-Sally's insecurities (""Don't touch me, I'm full of moisturizer!  You might drain it all off; like rain in the desert, it all gets sucked away.  You'd probably reflate!"")
-Jane's insanity (""There's no such thing as homosexuals, just peoplesexuals!""),
-and Patrick's relationship phobia (""Sally, there are certain words you just don't say to a man, they're too technical, like 'commitment' or 'cervix'"").
But best of all is Jeff, a charmingly neurotic Whelshman who is capable of attracting women, yet becomes terrified when he does.  Many of the phrases that come out of his mouth make me cringe and slap my forehead, while rolling on the floor laughing.  Some of his romantic disasters include smiling at a co-worker and destroying a water cooler in the process (""She thinks I'm a mute with a balance problem""), telling an Israeli woman that he collects women's ears in a bucket, telling a woman on a train that one of his legs was amputated (""I've met the woman of my dreams, and I can't take my trousers off!""), getting tricked into joining a three-way with Patrick and his girlfriend Linda, complimenting his boss/future girlfriend Julia in an elevator (""You have the eyes of ten women...not in a jar or anything, I'm not accusing you!""), and of course, the famous striptease in a room that was, unbeknownst to him, full of his coworkers, friends, and his parents.  Overall a classic character, and one of the funniest I've seen in a long time.  And yet, Jeff is just part of a whole, where all the acting, the writing, and the direction come together to form a TV show that is a masterpiece.  It's a shame there are only 22 episodes broadcast so far, but I could happily watch them over and over for years to come.
As far as the DVDs themselves go, there are pros and cons.  I like the menu design and interviews with the cast and staff.  The bad news is that there are no subtitles, and commentaries are only on episodes three through nine in the second season.  And the ""Play All"" option is only on the second season DVD.  Nevertheless, this whole series is well worth owning on DVD.  I think the fourth season will be broadcast on BBC America next month, and I can't wait!",1084579200,5,2677,4.702355460385439
1923597,5,B0000DC154,"This is by far the funniest tv series I have ever seen. The first episode had me laughing so hard that I missed most of what happened. If you are looking for a good comedy about what real relationships are about, then this is definitely a must see. No matter what gender you are, I am sure you can relate to something in these episodes. I do not normally purchase DVDs because there are so few movies I wish to see over again. This is the exception to the rule. I am sure I will watch these episodes over and over again. Just pure hilarious fun.",1073865600,2,545,4.150943396226415
1923598,5,B0000DC154,"Truly the most consistently funny half-hour of television today, miles and away better than any American situation comedy on air.  I've yet to see an episode of either of the first two series that didn't make me laugh aloud several times.
A man, his new girlfriend, his best friend, her best friend, his ex, and her ex--all the elements are ripe for endless complications and plots, and the writers take full advantage of the characters' intricate relationships, placing them in ever increasingly absurd situations that nonetheless are perfectly believable.
The humor is veddy, veddy British, which, as the atrocious NBC version illustrated, does not translate well into American, but that's okay.  The actors' comedic talents shine through in every scene.  Of particular merit is Richard Coyle's portrayal of the hapless Jeff, cursed with inappropriate speech in the presence of the opposite sex.  Watch the opening episode to Series Two, and you'll laugh yourself silly at his antics, culminating with his pathetic realization that he's ""got too many legs.""",1073692800,2,1059,5.285714285714286
1923599,5,B0000DC154,"This is beyond fabulous.  Perfect enough that I find myself making excuses to stay home and watch it in its 10pm Friday night time slot.  Beyond raunchy enough that I was terribly embarrassed at making my dad stop channel-flipping to watch an episode when I was visiting my parents last weekend.  So universally funny that he laughed more than, and loved it at least as much as, I did.  I love poor, awkward Jeff, and all of the delightfully horrific things that come out of his mouth.  He's probably the only character on television that I can watch make a total idiot of themselves without cringing, becoming terribly self-conscious, and having to change the channel.",1072915200,6,669,4.782608695652174

8000548,5,B0000DC154,Coupling is one of the best English comedies of all time. The characters are well developed and the stories are perfectly written to reflect real life situations. The actors all do such a good job that you can actually relate to the situations of their characters. I will definitely be ordering the rest of the series in the future.

8000549,5,B0000DC154,one of the best sitcoms or Britcoms of all time. think of Friends the TV show but a lot more interesting and a lot less silly. Stephen Moffat now the head of Dr. who at the BBC created this show with his wife and mother-in-law and it became one of the first or latest US UK hits. with shorter seasons and less seasons you also find in this program would you find in a lot of other British and Canadian shows that they have a direction that they're going in and they don't really make episodes to just fill time or stretch out into season after season trying to just make a buck till the story and characters are all played out and you're just sitting there looking at the show because you're too used to the show to turn it off,1386547200,,727,4.126760563380282

Steven Moffat is a writing genius and I wish that they could have continued the series. Maybe paused it after season two, waited a few years, and then begun again. I miss these characters.
