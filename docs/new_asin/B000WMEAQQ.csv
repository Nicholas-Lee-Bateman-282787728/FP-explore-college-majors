8224083,5,B000WMEAQQ,If you enjoy older movies of action-fantasy then this one is a good choice. I happened to be a fan of ALL the Sinbad movies. If you like those you would also enjoy Jason and the Argonauts.,1245196800,,188,4.108108108108108
8224084,1,B000WMEAQQ,"Your Agent, sent me the Sinbad the Sailor DVD knowing that it was not fomatted to play in the United States. Then charge my Credit Card for
payment prior to the 30 days for viewing the DVD. I suggest that Amazon
not use this company for the sale of DVDs",1209772800,,253,4.08
8224085,4,B000WMEAQQ,I had not seen this movie in years despite looking for it on video.  That should tell how long.  But the movie was so great to watch again.  Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was a perfect sinbad and plays the part with such great flair that I have a hard time seeing anyone else in the role.,1202428800,,280,4.054545454545455
8224086,1,B000WMEAQQ,"The H. Bala is who gave this a 4-star rating is obvuously a shill for the people responsible for foisting this abysmal-quality bootleg copy of an excellent film I, like others, have waited for years to be made available on DVD.

THIS IS AN ILLEGAL TRANSFER COPY FROM A VHS TAPE AND THE QUALITY IS NON-EXISTENT.

I bought and returned this item last month (December 2007) after alerting Amazon to the fact that this is a product to be dropped and for Amazon to notify authorities of its existence.

CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1199577600,10,535,4.857142857142857
8224087,1,B000WMEAQQ,I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for years and when I saw this release advertised on Amazon I was delighted.  However after I got the video it was very dis-heartening to find out it was a rip off bootleg copy. I didn't think Amazon sold this kind of junk.  I thought it was illegal.  Amazon please pull bootleg copies like this off your website and will whomever owns the legitimate rights to this movie please release a good version on DVD for all of us loyal fans.,1197763200,11,485,4.25
