8083700,5,B000B8QFBE,"I loved the singing, even though some of it was quite short and although the story was silly, it was fun.",1495497600,,105,4.0476190476190474
8083701,5,B000B8QFBE,"This is a totally delightful movie which I thought I had seen but found out I hadn't.  The musical portion is one gem after another; the singers looking so young and good looking, exploding the myth of fat opera stars.  Gino Bechi is particularly exciting especially in the Toreador's aria; Tito Gobbi his usual dramatic self in the Prologue to Pagliacci and sweetly singing an Italian song.  Though Gigli sings an aria from Andrea Chenier, it's obviously not him being pictured since he sings with his face to the back of the stage.  Maria Caniglia looks fine in singing Casta Diva; the ballet at the end could have been left out.  The story line is charming and hilariously acted by a game cast, including the beautiful 20-year-old Gina Lollobrigida who now at the age of 89 works as a photo jouralist.  I must look up her books online.  I forgot to mention that Caniglia's Casta Diva is not complete; just a segment unfortunately.",1468281600,,933,4.6871165644171775
8083702,5,B000B8QFBE,"The performances by Gobbi and Bechi are so outstanding that seeing them  should make opera lovers of anyone not already mad about opera. They have great voices, young, strong, and with brilliant technique.  Their intelligent acting is a lesson for everyone.  Then, as two other reviewers have said, Schipa, at age 70, gives another lesson in use of control of feeling, meaning. tone and diction. (I bought this film to follow Scipa's late career.)
As for the film, there is 20 year old Gina Lollobrigida to make us ask what she did at 70. The silly story and mugging actors have the faults and the virtues that other reviewers emphasize, and may demonstrate the influence of Hollywood.. I didn't mind one time through, and I am able to jump to the music now. I'm so grateful for the very rare opera content that i urge everyone to buy the DVD
The picture and sound are surprisingly good, I think,and  the Bel Canto Society says it worked for the best.",1452729600,,951,4.609467455621302
8083703,4,B000B8QFBE,"How you respond to this depends on what you are watching it for. As a film, it is a real, Italian, post-war period piece, dated and hokey with lots of mugging and slapstick but it also brings together four great La Scala stars, each doing a set-piece aria or two. Especially impressive are Gobbi and Bechi, the former a miracle of sweet legato, vocal control and subtle inflection, the latter another kind of vocal miracle, like a whirlwind or a thunderstorm, his extraordinary top notes absurdly prolonged, resonant and thrilling. Gigli does a good stand-and-deliver aria from ""Andrea Chnier"" but Maria Caniglia is sadly flat through most of a lumpy ""Casta diva"" as she is simply past her best here.

The casting of the ""leading man"" is inexplicable; let's put it this way: he's no matine idol - and Gina Lollobrigida has nothing to do but pout and make come-hither faces during the scene from Carmen where, if Bechi were really singing that close her to her face rather than miming, he would blast off her eyelashes.

The whole thing pretends to be set in London, using a bit of contemporary footage of the usual Thames scene to convince us, but is otherwise reliant on some fairly amateurish sets. It's fun to hear the Italian rattled off with only intermittently accurate, helpful, or even extant subtitles but of course the main attraction is the great singing. The sound is crude but perfectly listenable.",1449273600,,1411,4.802469135802469
8083704,5,B000B8QFBE,This was a really great movie made very long ago with marvelous performers of that era.  It has a great story and interweaves performances of well known opera arias into the story.  Lots of fun,1386806400,,193,4.485714285714286
8083705,5,B000B8QFBE,"Gino Bechi to some extant is forgotten today, apart from his recordings with Gigli. Yet he was a big star in his day and made many films. Among other things, he was Franco Corelli's all-time favorite baritone. You can see him for free in a clip from this film on the Bel Canto Society site.

The film's sung contents include Schipa in Barbiere, Gigli in Chnier, Bechi in Barbiere, Gobbi in Pagliacci, Bechi in Carmen, Caniglia in Norma and Gobbi in ""Dicitencello vuie.""",1336262400,2,469,4.650602409638554
8083706,1,B000B8QFBE,"This is about the worst DVD I have ever bought. Unless you love old-fashioned Italian slapstick - with hardly any real singing by the advertised great tenors - then don't hesitate to buy it. On the other hand, if you want to hear these great singers, just get something else - anything else.
I grew up with most of these tenors and can only repeat how terribly disappointed I was in this DVD.",1334534400,3,392,4.383561643835616
8083707,4,B000B8QFBE,"If you were born Italian & grew up in a community like this one then you will love this film.  It is so funny in the Italian style - it makes me smile & laugh outright.  I will bring it with me to NY & share it with my family, they will be delighted!!!  (Incidentally, on each Sat afternoon at !:00pm, during opera season at the Met, we had to stop whatever we were doing & gather 'round the  radio to listen to Milton Cross & opera ensemble.  Mom's orders - capisco?)",1325548800,2,468,4.043478260869565
8083708,4,B000B8QFBE,"I bought this DVD for the following reasons: 1) I am indeed mad about opera,  2) I wanted to see some of the great singers of the early 20th century in action, and 3) I was curious about why Gina Lollabrigida gets a billing in this film.  As I expected, it was worth my money for Tito Gobbi's performance alone.  In addition, I got to hear and see Tito Schipa in action -- what phrasing!

As for the story, it's ""cute"", but compared to the films we now have, a bit literarily and technologically naive.  If you truly listen for artists' interpretations -- and not just for the nice tunes -- buy this DVD.  Perhaps people interested in early films might also value this work.  Otherwise spend your money on DVDs and CDs of complete operas: most of the stories will be just as inconsequential and you'll get more music for your money.

Four (perhaps five) star rating for opera buffs; two or three stars for the general public.",1317859200,4,925,4.431952662721893
