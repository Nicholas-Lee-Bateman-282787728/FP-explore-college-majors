8306234,5,B001GMZGIC,The Global Wonders series is utterly delightful.  The art is beautiful and the production quality is great.  The kids are adorable.  This DVD provides a fun and simple introduction to Indian culture.  It's very accessible and fun for kids and adults alike.  We were so happy to have found this!!,1318291200,,295,4.82
8306235,5,B001GMZGIC,"A well written, informative and entertaining production for smaller children. The multinational cast is adorable and keeps a light, jovial mood. The program introduces sports, holidays, places, jewlery, important figures like Ram & Sita, Gandhi and much more. My husband is from India. In addition to visiting India we try to incorporate Indian culture into our lives here in the U.S.. This is a fabulous tool for assisting us in that effort. I looked high and low for media materials that introduce Indian culture to small children (like the ""Sesame Street"" sister program airing in India)but couldn't find any. So I was elated to discover this and my three year old son LOVES it! He immediately began practicing the new vocabulary and wants to see it over and over.",1294272000,,767,4.953488372093023
8306236,5,B001GMZGIC,Global Wonders has created a wonderful DVD which is both entertaining and educational!  My husband is from India and we are so pleased at the accuracy in the DVD.  Wonderful memories from my husband's childhood were brought back and shared with our children (ages 6 and 2).  My older daughter can't wait to share the DVD with friends to show them about her heritage.  And I can't wait to purchase the other DVD's to learn about other cultures myself.,1228003200,,450,4.658227848101266
8306237,5,B001GMZGIC,"We bought the whole set for our 2 year old son to help expose him to different cultures and understand and appreciate the similarities and differences.  I think it's great that the series allows kids to laugh at the differences and the pronunciations (the whole grandmother segment is hilarious).  I was a bit surprised when our son started asking for ""Namaste"" and would throw a fit when we tried Baby Einstein or Sesame Street instead.  The combination of the catchy music, great animation, and storyline captivates him.  All in all, a really great product that will be included in our baby shower/new infant/birthday/holiday gifts.  We've already bought multiple copies!",1225756800,,673,5.137614678899083
8306238,5,B001GMZGIC,"I received this series and have already watched them all with my 4 year old daughter. The India title is one of her favorites and I must say, it's pretty cute to hear her saying ""Namaste"" after the show! She especially loves the music in this title and even her little baby brother was bouncing to the beat. This video does a great job of representing this fascinating culture.

Best of all is that I really loved the series too - the music and voices were great but not annoying like many other kid videos and there was such a wonderful, diverse and positive representation of many different people. I also really liked the combination of animated graphics and real-life imagery. It is important to me for her to see people, places, cultures, etc as they occur in the real world, not just in animation. Global Wonders is definitely on my go-to list as a great holiday gift this year!",1224547200,,884,4.525
8306239,5,B001GMZGIC,"My four year old daughter loves this series. Like most four year old girls, she can be very picky (about everything!) and this is her hands down favorite things to watch. While being very entertaining (some of the Baby and Little Einstein people are the creative forces behind this), this is also a great educational experience. Our daughter has asked us to learn more about some of the themes touched on in this series. Overall, this is very highly recommended.",1224460800,,462,4.7875
