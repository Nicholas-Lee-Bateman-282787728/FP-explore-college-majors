2916904,5,B000U6YJMO,"The most striking aspect of this documentary is that the people giving interviews are not your typical anti-war activists. To the contrary, they are people like Colonel Paul Hughes, a strategic planner for the Coalition Provisional Authority, and Barbara Bodine, ambassador in charge of Baghdad. They were the ones ""on the ground"" attempting to create a successful democracy in Iraq. But their efforts were stymied by arrogant and clueless higher ranking Bush officials such as Donald Rumsfield, Paul Wolfowitz and Paul Bremer.

The stories they tell of the Bush adminstration's extreme incompetence are mind boggling. For instance, how Bush officials chose to completely disband the Iraqi military. This left huge numbers of Iraqi men, with military experience and access to weapons, out on the street and with a strong desire to seek revenge against those who had taken away their jobs and livelihood. This problem was further compounded by the huge stashes of Iraqi military weapons that Bush officials foolishy left unguarded. Thus the Iraqi insurgents were able to achieve a level of weaponry and man power that to this day fuels the ongoing civil war. Part of the problem is that the military experts, like Colin Powell, were being ignored. While ""chickenhawks"" with no substantial military experience, such as Rumsfield, Wolfowitz and Cheney, were making all the decisions.

A strong argument can be made that the Iraq War was always doomed to turn into a Sunni versus Sh'ia civil war quagmire. But this movie isn't really aimed at those who opposed the war from the beginning. Instead it seems more directed at moderates and conservatives who initially supported the war but are beginning to question the results, especially those military families who have lost loved ones in what appears to be a hopeless cause.

It's hard for me to imagine that anyone - conservative or liberal, Democrat or Republican - could come away from this film and not feel angry and disillusioned at how the Bush administration has conducted the war. Highly recommended!",1189036800,36,2056,5.149700598802395
2916905,5,B000U6YJMO,"Facts and figures can usually be overwhelming and dry as dust;but when they are laid out so explicitly and compelling as first time documentary film maker Charles Ferguson has done,then it is really tough to not want to cry as I did.""No End in Sight"" means exactly what it says;if the U.S does not leave Iraq a projected $1.860 Trillion will be spent on this ""War"" and who knows how many more lives taken. What I like most about this film is that Ferguson interviews those who were in key positions in the military during the initial push into Iraq. This is their story from their lips. These were people appointed by the Bush Administration to go in and ""get the job done and leave."" You will hear just how this did not happen,and it is sad and frustrating. It is significant for me to note that in order for those in The Administration to comment and be interviewed.....ALL DECLINED!

Is this just another documentary to be picked apart by naysayers? I heard Ferguson speak and he said "" I made mistakes and I would have made many more were it not for two things. First,filmmaker Alex Gibney (Enron:The Smartest Guys in the Room) agreed to consult. And second, my crew taught me my job."" If ever there is a more daring and compelling expose of the manipulation and mishandling of The Iraq War someone would really have to excel mightily in order to surpass ""No End in Sight.""",1188777600,19,1377,4.530120481927711
2916906,2,B000U6YJMO,"The film is nothing but an enumeration of facts and  figures.  There is no heart to this movie, I wonder if it should be called a movie, or just a long line of chronologically arranged news.  I guess one should not be surprised, the filmmaker is a software engineer.  Lots of numbers and dates...
I felt like I was doing time soon after the setup. About 70 percent of the stuff was common knowledge that anyone that watched the news knew about.  The rest was a bit deeper than the news, but very undeveloped. The filmmaker pointed out the strategic mistakes Bush made in Iraq, but little was done to explain what should have been done.
The most disappointing part is that the movie is pessimistic, but the premise is not developed.  ""No end in Sight"" equals, it is impossible to win this country. Fine, I would buy that if the film would explore different options, and have some smart PHDs and Generals explain why it would not work.
Instead the film is all about the past, while the title lures you to believe that it has a futuristic outlook ""In Sight..."" The end is terrible. Conclusion: Bush and Co. messed up in Iraq. In case you did not know...  we will sit you down for 2 hrs and tell you again.
I think good film making is done when a new facts or a new point of view is shown to the audience. The film does neither.
Also, there is no opposition in the film. ""The US didn't defend the Baghdad Museum""  Great, but the museum was on a 16 acres and from what I read it was next to impossible at the time to secure such a large area. I wish I saw some opposing views.
The visuals were terrible. For two hours you will see talking heads and general shots of US soldiers in Baghdad. Over and over. There is also one colored map.
Conclusion: Bush messed up in Iraq. Hey, Magnolia Pictures thought it was great...Go figure...",1188259200,19,1825,4.331378299120234
2916907,5,B000U6YJMO,"You probably won't learn anything new about the Iraq war from this understated documentary, nor should you expect any sort of neutrality. But the catastrophic consequences of the war for our country and the whole world make its chronological review of the basic facts worthwhile, while the cinematic power of pictures as compared to reading books about Iraq puts a very human face on the war. Director Charles Ferguson's film is a searing indictment of the recklessness, gross incompetence, and political cynicism of the Bush administration. He interviews soldiers, diplomats, Bush appointees, state department officials, and Iraqis, all of whom tell their personal stories about working hard at a noble cause only to discover that the emperor and his minions had no clothes and no conscience. Their sense of betrayal is heartbreaking. The film makes it clear that the administration's incompetence and hubris doomed their naive plan from the start, and that five years later there is still ""no end in sight."" Director Charles Ferguson is not your run-of-the mill film maker; he earned a PhD from MIT, founded and then sold his company Vermeer Technologies to Microsoft in 1996, was for three years a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, and has been a visiting professor at both MIT and Berkeley.",1187654400,103,1322,5.153488372093023
2916908,5,B000U6YJMO,"Put simply, what frightens the dickens out of me in this masterfully done Charles Ferguson documentary is that,all the time our American troops are dying needlessly in Iraq (and elsewhere for that matter) we have a Commander in Chief who is truly and totally disengaged! NOW THAT IS FRIGHTENING.This is very reminiscent of other regimes such as Marie Antoinette and Louis spending money and rousting about Versailles while France starves and the uprising begins!

Ferguson's case is airtight, and I doubt that even Bush himself could wriggle out of this scorching indictment of his administration's failed handling of the Iraq Mess. Ferguson's case is expertly laid out and pretty compelling: the Bush people have made errors in judgment peppered liberally with stubbornness,arrogance with complete disregard for the a majority of American anti-sentiment with the Iraq War. Ferguson builds his case by using the testimony of bureaucrats who served and saw the continued unfolding of the horror we know as the Iraq War.

Will your blood boil? Probably yes, but only if you have finally been convinced that we are ruled by a truly disengaged man. If this light bulb goes on, take a look in horror for the first time and act! Ferguson keeps things very low key, and Ferguson keeps it quite simple;that is the amazing part of this documentary!: Ferguson does not inflame the viewer-the viewer will simply get inflamed!

This is beautiful and compelling documentary filmmaking of the highest degree. Truly a must-see!

I saw this at a private screening with a Q & A after. Fortunately, many in the audience had voted for George W. Bush and supported his policies, but had grown weary and suspicious of his administration. THAT WAS ENCOURAGING.If you love our current President and his handling,or non handling of this War, I challenge you to see this film and decide for yourself. Even the most closed-minded jury must be swayed by an airtight case expertly prosecuted!",1187308800,80,1964,5.052469135802469

The incredibly misguided (really?) disbanding of the regular Iraqi army which overnight created a force of 500,000 armed and trained (and unemployed!) people will help to clarify any doubts. Very impressive interview by some of the military personnel who were there and actually saw the willful disintegration of what was the most advanced country in the Middle East (even under a despicable despot) and of how the hopes of Iraqis were betrayed by a group of criminal politicians who are now enjoying pleasant retirement playing golf....Well done Charles Ferguson!",1435017600,,829,5.384615384615385

2916918,5,B000U6YJMO,"I wanted to comment..sort of ""venting"" after seeing this so well made film of the dis-integration of Iraq back through 2003-2007.

The comments of those informed and well postured people with access to the Bush Administration ""decision"" was historical, yet so current based on today's Iraq situational news reports.

Having served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, both wars are testament to the horrific decision the Bush people made during post 9/11.  Most know, the Iraq invasion plan was initiated in November of 2001 to General Tommy Franks, then the Centcom commander (in his book).

The overriding evidence of the Bush Administration intent was now historical fact.  The absolute worse decision which will stand the test of time for decades.

I only hope the faceless souls of those lost come each and every night to haunt Bush, Cheney, Rumsfelt, Feith and Rice each and every night.  For what they did to the American military..so the young Soldiers, Marines, Navy & Air Force personnel shall never be forgotten.

The interviews with key players in the occupation of Baghdad are revealing and insightful.  It is incredible twelve years after going to war in Iraq to look back and see the blatant miscalculations that were made and how frustrating it must have been for many of the people in the film to have been caught up in the middle of all the politics when a nation was at stake. The film has a lot of unsettling footage but it shows what the executive planners back in Washington didn't want to acknowledge. The comic relief in the film has to be Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and consequently also the most tragic as footage of some of his interviews reveal an individual with so much background experience and in the end not very astute.",1428710400,,996,4.818713450292398

The magnitude of the suffering from mistaken decisions (which ignored the advice of experts interviewed), is overwhelming to consider, especially given the feeling I get from the film that the post-invasion course actually could have gone okay. How surprised I was by that possibility speaks to how long this conflict was needlessly drawn out: the time when things might have been wrapped up successfully is now so many years past, and since then Iraqi civilians and US soldiers have continued to suffer, and incalculable resources have been squandered. There is so much to learn not only about what happened, but what must be considered in future conflicts, that this film deserves multiple viewings.

2916949,5,B000U6YJMO,"The Iraq War for some people is not fully understood. I watched this film with a wary eye, I didn't want to watch a tree-hugging, yoga chanting, hippie documentary about the evils of our military. I noted the many people who were interviewed. I picked up their books, I searched for documents & files online and this film nails their points & facts very well. I feel that Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Walter Slocombe, Paul ""Jerry"" Bremer & Dick Cheney to start at the top. Failed our troops, with their planing, execution & handling of the Iraq War. When the CPA issued the Disbanding of the Iraqi Armed Forces with the defense of that there was no Iraqi military left ""they all went home"". Is it possible many of the Iraqis did not want to fight & die for Saddam? Maybe. We did not have enough troops. Rumsfeld wanted a lightning war with 50,000 boots on the ground. And, relented to have 160,000 troops sent.
One the eve of the order to disband the Iraqi military Jay Garner pushed for a change in the order or find some ways to soften it. The CPA order was conceived by a select few but would effect many with effects that caused thousands of American deaths & wounded service men & women. As of 2012 the suicide rate for members of the military is higher than ever before one can only wonder the damage Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Solcombe & Bremer caused. Watch this film and I can understand the frustration on to a fraction what our soldiers & those who tried to rebuild Iraq, fight the insurgents & do the job right. I grew up in a military household & everyone who has served in Afghanistan & Iraq will always be a heroes to me.

2916952,4,B000U6YJMO,"I watched this video with both awe and dismay. I don't want to say I dug deep into these events in the news when they were all coming down but my guess is I heard what much of America heard when viewing regular media sources. Now I see this and realize what I heard was in no way what was happening in reality.

This documentary deals with the events just prior to, and during, our invasion of Iraq. I was dumbfounded that, in this day and age, with our understanding of what actually happens in a war, we could have approached this in such an entirely inept manner. Could those in charge be so unbelievably moronic?! Bush I could understand. But Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfowitz are supposed to either know what they're doing or know to defer to those who do. None of that happened here. Not merely that they allowed an entire country to crumble, but the set in motion events that ultimately put our troops in unnecessary danger. And with the destroying of the National Library and the sacking of the National Museum in Iraq, thousands of years of history may become irretrievable. And watching footage of Rumsfeld trying to downplay these serious errors (or deliberate actions) makes me want to spit.

There is a lot of information from a lot of different sources here. Many were in our government, saw what was happening and were trying to make things right. They simply were not listened to by those at the top. Funny how no one or institution in the country got the protection they needed other than the Oil Ministry.

So....American Press. Where were you when this was all going on? You seem to have no reservations in editorializing when it comes to matters of lesser importance. Shouldn't the American people have gotten the skinny on what really was happening in Iraq at the time? Are you merely shills for the powers that be?",1329177600,,1833,4.599388379204893

It was in those early days America sealed its dubious fate in the campaign. The documentary does an excellent job of explaining what went so terribly wrong and continues to plague us to this day. I have been studying the War in Iraq for quite some time, but I have never seen such a succinct presentation of such high quality information as in this documentary.",1316736000,,666,4.558333333333334

For example not protecting the museums, firing all the Iraq military instead of using them to establish internal peace, firing all the government workers who were in the Ba'ath party which included school teachers and the people who ran the country.  None of this was in the reconstruction plan, but was done by the Bush administration as part of the Project for a New American Centruy plan to destroy Iraq.

I woke up, I got ready for work, I threw my headphones on, I got on the bus and...I saw nothing but conversation all around me.
Strange, I thought...
Then I got downtown and I ran into a former co-worker and he said, ""What do you think""...I replied, ""Think of what?"".
He replied...""The twin towers were attacked by terrorists"".
Like all of you life was never the same again.
From watching the planes hit.
Then watching the towers come down.
Then....finally having to endure the endless lies about Iraq's involvment.
....""Fast forward a few years later""....
The truth finally started coming out.
Once again I'm at work and a co-worker says..""We have to get THEM before THEY get US""...
What a sad and pathetic wake up call that was.
Everyone wonders how Hitler and Stalin got away with what they did.
It's so easy.
It's so obvious.
The masses are so easily deceived.
""We have to get them, before they get us""...
Fool.
Get us...for what?
I, like the majority of you knew why we went to Iraq...the oil
The Iraq museum...laid to waste.
7000 years of human history and our govt. does nothing but let looters burn it to the ground.
How sad.
How...sad, the only building they protected was the ministry of oil.
And yet our people still blindly defend them.
Why?
Blind stupidity and an unwillingness to think for themselves.
How many of our troops dead and for nothing?
How many innocent Iraqi's dead for nothing?
Where is the outrage?
Justice?
This film is a step in the right direction.

2916957,5,B000U6YJMO,"This film was produced, directed, and written by Charles Ferguson.  I became a Ferguson's fan when I saw his last film, Inside Job, a film about our current global & domestic financial crisis.  This documentary was done earlier and is also a series of interviews from those people who were at the center of Iraq War -- from the decision makers who never set foot in Iraq at the time (or served in the military for that matter), to the very people who were directly affected by their decisions (i.e. our military soldiers and the people of Iraq).  It's all here - straight from their mouth.  (OK, not EVERYONE -- only those people who were brave enough to appear on camera!)  I was touched by their candor and their courage to speak their mind.

This film was not easy to digest.  The subject matter is too close to heart and the event is still unfolding before us, but it is an important subject for every American to know.  How did we end up spending so much money and so much blood and tears -- all for WHAT?  What did we get out of it?  There's one country that benefitted greatly from our attack and it's not America or Iraq.  (Hint: It's a country right next to Iraq!)  It doesn't matter which political party you belong to.  You need to know the answer.

I read one reviewer who called this film ""TRAITOR!!!""  (Yes, it was written in caps and with three exclamation marks.)  How can you be a traitor if you want to know the truth?  That ugly word belongs to the people who abused our military, depleted our treasury, and fooled the American public and the world.  We have hearings on athletes taking steroids, but nothing on those people who caused this mess.  What's up with that?

This film was released in 2007 when it projected the cost of Iraq War to be 1.8 TRILLION dollars.  We willl know the final figure soon enough.  The end IS in sight!  One day soon, I hope the people of Iraq will say to the American people (like back in the days when we were allies) ""Ahlan wusahlan"" - ""Welcome""!",1310515200,,2000,4.389645776566757

People ransaked offices, carried things away from gov't buildings, destroyed Iraq's National Museum & we just stood by watching them all do it. Bush stood on an air craft carrier declaring the end of war just a few months after we invaded Iraq.  He even made a comment of ""BRING IT ON"" at one point.  Well, they did ""BRING IT ON"".  When I heard him say that I thought how STUPID you are!!!  Yes, Hussein was a dictator, killed his own people, thousands in one area but when he did that, we AMERICA, were his friend--Rumsfeld is seen shaking hands with him when he was in the first Bush administration--we even gave Hussein arms in the 80's.  Once on TV & I've never forgotten this, George W. Bush, when he was President, commented that Hussein ""even tried to kill my daddy"".  What better reason to go after Hussein then a vendetta.  It's now May 2011 & were still there, billions of money spent but even more than that is the 4500-5000 American lives that were lost in Iraq needlessly.

Many of his subjects are former loyalists who were disillusioned by the incompetence they witnessed.  The way the statements of policy makers directly contradicted those of policy implementers such as General Jay Garner, former deputy secretary of the State Department Richard Armitage, former chairman of the National Intelligence Council Robert Hutchings, and Colin Powell's former chief of staff Col.

2916968,4,B000U6YJMO,"2003 saw the U.S. led coalition invade and start the occupation of Iraq. Based on the documentary it soon became painfully clear that other than the invasion itself, there really was no plan as we'd be home for dinner.

The looting in Iraq started immediately and left the country in ruins both physically and financially. The coalition forces did nothing to stop it. The only building not looted was the oil ministry as that was the only one guarded by coalition forces.

No one in the White House administration was reading any of the ""on scene"" reports from the commanders. No one in the White House was listening to anyone on the ground in Iraq as proven by the appointment of L Paul Bremer to oversee everything ? His 3rd major sweep of the pen was to disband the entire Iraq Army rendering over 400,000 men unemployed in one day. All this despite warnings and advice to the contrary by the very commanders that had led the coalition forces in. The social and economic implications of such an asinine and callous decision still shape the landscape in Iraq to this day.

Obviously politicians know much better about this military stuff than 4/5 star Generals ?

The whole Iraq debacle was being run from the Pentagon by people (Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Cheney, Bush, Rice) who were so far from having even the basic experience required to do what they were doing. It would be akin to a business owner employing a baker to be a pharmacist. The cumulative military service of all in charge added up to maybe a weekend. It is easy to see why government can garner so much emotion from the governed. They make the decisions, the guys in the ""thick"" of it deal with the consequence.

By the end of the documentary I felt helpless and angry but I also felt part of the problem somehow. I admit to my own apathy during the time this was all going down. Like most of the country I trusted those in charge and trusted their decisions. I couldn't have been more wrong.

Documentaries can be slanted to portray the material portrayed as either good/bad, left/right wing etc etc and you can't help feeling this one is slanted a little to the political left.

Despite that, I felt that the evidence presented was overwhelming in that the Bush Administration listened to no one but themselves. They wanted this war, they were going to get this war, and anyone who stood out against it was going to feel their wrath. (Joe Wilson and his wife?). Also it's astounding how the media was completely in bed with the administration insomuch as there was little if any dissent to the actions being taken.

I recommend this documentary and I also recommend researching this whole Iraq/Bush thing further. There are many good books out there that tackle the Bush/Iraq era from many angles.

Both financially and on a human scale.

The errors in judgment and lack of military experience within the administration are both appalling and telling of the Bush white house.

This is a valuable and informative documentary; the experts interviewed are not individuals brimming with arrogance and ignorance, but mostly decent American citizens who had faith in their government and did what a loyal citizen would do!
I remember, when Baghdad was ""freed"", watching an Iraqi old man on CNN hitting Saddam's picture with his shoe then holding the picture and crying. It's not an easy thing to understand; the anguish of Iraqi people, who were oppressed by the Iraqi regimen then freed, only to discover, that it's not about their freedom. When you watch this documentary you will understand why American soldiers were welcome by the Iraqi people but were confronted later by their anger. You will also understand the emotional suffering of our American soldiers who found out that they as well as the Iraqi people are being played.

Watch and learn, as our American boys and girls learned after starting the war that there is a bigger nastier game at play.  Listen to Paul Hughes, David Yancey, Ann Gildroy, Seth Moulton, and Paul Pillar among others and find out how experts like General Jay Garner and Ambassador Barbara Bodine were pulled out of Iraq when they started figuring out the truth just to be replaced by inexperienced people.

Learn how Bremer's disbanding of Iraq's military entities affected the situation in Iraq; Why Bremer didn't consult the American military commanders in Iraq before making decisions? Why people like Bremer, Cheney and Rumsfeld declined interviews? How great minds like Sergio Vieira de Mello were lost? How Muqtada alsadr along with other parasites found a stage for their craziness in Iraq? Why precious libraries and museums have been destroyed while the oil ministry has been fully protected? Why was it ok for Saddam to oppress his people and use chemical weapons against them and against Iranian civilians? How come our government didn't intervene then? Do the math and figure out why the average hard working American person is struggling to live when tremendous amount of money has been spent on war.

The title of this review is actually a quotation by President George W. Bush found in some archival news footage near the end of this powerful documentary.

This is a documentary film about America's occupation of Iraq.  It focuses generally on the two-year period following the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and particularly with the period of a few months in the spring and summer of 2003. It asserts that serious mistakes made by the Bush administration during this time were the cause of the ensuing quagmire of problems of guerrilla warfare, warlord rule, criminality, and anarchy that dominate Iraq to this day.  (Note that this film does initially touch on other aspects prior to the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq.)

To a large extent, this film, besides archival footage, consists of brief interviews with high ranking officials who were involved in the initial Iraqi occupation authority and ORHA (the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, later to be replaced by the CPA, the Coalition Provisional Authority).  Iraqi civilians, American soldiers, and prominent analysts are also interviewed.

Thirty-five people were briefly interviewed, many of them former Bush loyalists who have since become disillusioned by the incompetence and recklessness they were involved in at the time.

Examples of those interviewed include the following:

(1) General Jay Garner, who briefly ran the reconstruction before being replaced by L. Paul Bremer III (who took over May, 2003)
(2) Ambassador Barbara Bodine, who was placed in charge of the Baghdad embassy
(3) Richard Armitage, former Secretary of The State Department
(4) Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, Colin Powell's former Chief of Staff
(5) Colonel Paul Hughes, who worked in the ORHA and then the CPA

One criticism of this film is that it is biased.  This is not true.  The accumulated professional standing of the people that were interviewed and their insistence on the facts makes this criticism not plausible.  Besides key officials such as Bremer and former Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld declined to be interviewed.

This film has won many awards.

Incidentally, there were no weapons of mass destruction found in this documentary.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2007) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has fifteen interesting extras.  There are no English subtitles but there is closed captioning.

In conclusion, this is the first film of its kind to chronicle the reasons behind Iraq's descent into chaos.  As such, it is not to be missed!!

2916977,5,B000U6YJMO,"Just when it seemed that documentaries about 9/11 and the Iraq war had played themselves out, along comes writer/director Charles Ferguson's devastating and insightful NO END IN SIGHT.  Where FAHRENHEIT 9/11 had basically nailed the Bush cabal for lying about the reasons America went to war in Iraq, and many other documentaries skewered the news media for basically being in bed with the administration, Ferguson probes into what was and was NOT going on in Iraq before, during, and after the invasion; and if you think you've seen it all, NO END IN SIGHT shows that what you've really seen is the mere tip of the iceberg.

In the film, Ferguson gets to interview people who were actually there in the firestorm, like Jay Garner, Paul Hughes, Barbara Bodine, deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, Seth Moulton, a U.S. Marine, and others who were involved in trying to reconstruct Iraq, and who instead found themselves totally stymied by an administration that displayed the worst in America: arrogance; venality; incompetence; cockiness; and indifference.  The idea that we would topple Saddam Hussein, restore order, create a new government, and then leave within six months or so was ludicrous to begin with anyway on paper; but as the graphic footage of the looting, the IEDs, and the various recountings by our people, numerous journalists (including George Packer), and various Middle East experts, show, it was infinitely worse when put into practice.  The unfortunate thing of it all is that very good people like Bodine, Moulton, and Hughes were left hung out to dry by an administration that bragged about knowing everything there was about imposing American power on the world, and proved that they knew NOTHING about the limits of doing it.

NO END IN SIGHT allows the viewer to see for themselves what it is over there in Iraq and doesn't preach from a pulpit as to the morality of going into Iraq in the first place.  But it leaves no doubt that the Bush Administration will be judged by history for how it handled the aftermath, and that the verdict will likely be devastating, regardless of the military outcome.  This is a film that MUST be seen by Americans of all political persuasions, because it forces upon us the reality that our good intentions can often be sabotaged by an administration's indifference to death and suffering.",1219449600,8,2359,4.9569620253164555

It doesn't call into question the crime of going to war in the first place but seems to in some way excuse this by ignoring it and pursuing a 'What went wrong' line in analysing the post invasion. This film talks a lot of the lack of military experience of Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush et al. The idea that many have that America would be there for the long run as long as the outcome is American domination of the oil in Iraq seems to me to be missing in this film and is crucial to any analysis of invasion and post invasion plans. (and I don't think that a quick outcome from expert military tactics but which resulted in a peaceful government which was in charge of their own oil without American domination is their objective).
Leaving unquestioned the motivations of the invasion (many would argue oil and big business, and which are of course necessary to investigate in an analysis of post invasion strategy) means that the casual uninformed American and western observer fed on westerm media would think that the supposed aims of 'freedom' and 'democracy for Iraq' have been destroyed or set back by 'incompetence'. This seems like a very small bitter pill for the administration to swallow as so many are against the war, and I'm sure they would rather be seen as 'incompetent' rather than criminal. As the US are building their massive bases there and securing domination of the oil I wonder if the media and films which are pursuing the (supposed) 'what went wrong' line are really just another smokescreen",1214265600,13,1726,4.640522875816994

2916983,5,B000U6YJMO,"If arrogance, ignorance and belligerence make you angry, be prepared to get really mad. I was so floored by this brilliant documentary, I had to watch it again the next day just to make sure I hadn't had a nightmare.

Focusing on the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq after the war in 2003, my jaw dropped ever lower as I listened to the catalogue of errors made by a select group of politicians and advisors at the Pentagon, headed up by Donald Rumsfeld. Their flippant attitude toward a terrorised and conquered nation laid low by sanctions is utterly sickening, their lack of preparation and naivety defies belief.

But it is the total disregard for all the best advice provided by their people on the ground that is the most shocking element of this story and nothing short of criminal.

This documentary is not liberal Bush-whacking or anti-war polemic (as some claim). It features interviews with US service men, diplomats, academics, US and Iraqi journalists, top members of the intelligence community and many other Washington insiders who were tasked with jobs in Iraq, and who went there full of vigour and hope. Their sadness, frustration and disbelief about the increasing chaos in the weeks and months after the war is painfully tangible throughout the film; despite their best efforts, they were rendered impotent by the total lack of structure, and by the blustering, bulldozing, ignorant decisions made by people who either stayed cosseted in Washington or in Baghdad's walled Green Zone.

Some reviewers here are criticising this film for not dealing with the 'reasons' (or lies) that took America into the war or for not looking at the progress being made now. This documentary is not about that.

It's about how things could have been different. It's about how the insurgency and orgy of violence now occurring might have been nipped in the bud. It's about how the efforts and sacrifices of those tasked with 'saving' and rebuilding Iraq didn't have to be worthless. It's about how Iraq's heritage - its museums, archives and libraries - could and should have been protected, not just the oil ministry (SCANDALOUS). It's about the expensive consequences of not listening to advice. It's about how the financial and human cost for America, Iraq and maybe the world could have been spared.

This film also provides a tough wake-up call on why the checks and balances of democracy must be preserved and protected to guard against abuses of power, and why it's vital that politics is transparent.

No End In Sight should be mandatory viewing in schools, not least for a lesson in how not to be a chest-beating gorilla like George W Bush (I apologise for the insult to gorillas) or a tag-along-Tina like Condoleezza Rice (it's baffling that she didn't know better). The true monsters in this tale though are Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and Paul Bremer who have a nation's blood on their hands, and should have a culture's destruction on their conscience.

It should also be pointed out that in laying Iraq so low, the Bush administration has by default made its nemesis Iran more powerful. Nice one guys.

2916991,1,B000U6YJMO,"What a laughably awful time for this DVD propaganda of anti-war falsehood to come out on DVD!!!! The reason the timing for this unlucky DVD is so poor is the facts in reality totally destroy, discredit and embarrass the makers of this DVD and the ideologues who radically put their trust in it.

The ruinous and slurring thesis of No End In Sight is whatever you may think about the reasons for liberating Iraq from the clutches of a WMD-building dictator, there IS ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION on what interpretation of the aftermath you should have. You should not even consider that the US military is winning or that Iraqis are better off after the Liberation--the makers of this DVD along with its sheeple-followers want the viewer to only accept their underhanded style of revisionism which dictates EVERYTHING THE US HAS DONE POST-WAR IN IRAQ IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE FIENDISH!

Proving how unequal and discriminatory for a particular, partisan viewpoint this propaganda DVD really is--in total contrast to FNC which always makes sure to include fair and balanced perspective from two, opposing viewpoints--this DVD ensures that it disallows viewpoints defending the Bush administration policy regarding Iraq!!!! This utter, one-sided focus on deviously belittling the management of the Iraq war aftermath neutralizes any value this DVD may've had, because it essentially serves as a cheerleader of retreat and wishing ill on US forces to lose in Iraq. As such, the viewers of this DVD will exclude immediately the vast majority of normal Americans--even those who sincerely though questionably believe the Iraq war was errant--because this DVD's apologists are of the ilk which believes the US should always be condemned for Iraq actions no matter what goes right.

That's why the timing of this release is so banefully dreadful for the partisan ideologues who put out this self-hatred DVD...because even the mainstream media actually admits now that Iraq is turning around! Of course, this will displease all viewers of this DVD because their thoughts are crookedly invested in a US loss and no evidence to the contrary will convince them otherwise, but for the majority of Americans, they can see what a fr*ud of enemy-emboldening this DVD is.

See, what all the viewers and makers of No End In Sight willfully blocked out is that the Surge Strategy implemented since early 07 is actually working and producing real, lifesaving results in Iraq. Conversely, this means that ALL THE VIEWERS OF THIS DVD ARE WRONG because they hallucinate that Iraq is in a civil war!!!!

The sheeple of withdrawal who lust for this propaganda obviously reject reading the news despite the fact their own mainstream media writes it. In the last few weeks, sources from all over the mainstream media have literally authored articles and reports of deaths dropping wildly in Iraq, deaths of both US soldiers and Iraqi civilians. The REAL TRUTH in Iraq is that it's NOWHERE NEAR AS BLOODY AND CALAMITOUS as this DVD falsifies it is! In fact, the trend is in the opposite direction: the US military has lost fewer soldiers this past October than at any time since early 06, and servicemen deaths are lower every month since the summer! Alongside that, Iraqi casualties are so low now that the mainstream media actually expresses disappointment at the low, daily death tolls. For instance, the death toll of Iraqis each day for a long while was about 56 or so dead, yet in the last few months, it has dropped to something in the 20s. The AP was the author of said fact, and they oppose the war.

This past weekend, the AP actually authored a news story which chronicled the inarguable fact that Iraqi civilians--the same civilians this DVD charges are getting blown up and massacred left and right--are returning in droves to Baghdad from surrounding countries like Syria. The AP's title for their grudging admission of an article was ""Thousands return to safer Iraqi capital."" This fact alone utterly humiliates and dismisses the appeasement and alarmist slant of this mutinous DVD which is obviously against acknowledging the success the US military's had due to the SURGE.

It's clear the makers of this DVD loathe the US military with a vengeance because when chronicling the aftermath of the Iraq Liberation, they NEVER CREDIT THE US MILITARY with doing anything right despite the fact the military has performed exceptionally. For instance, No End In Sight refuses to credit the US military for building schools and hospitals; rescuing Iraqi civilians from terrorists (Sunni and Shia); training Iraqis; distributing aid; and helping the Iraqis build a democracy by making the country safe enough to foster political reconciliation.

Like my thesis asserted: with all the success of the Surge and lower US and Iraqi deaths together with a return of Iraqis to Baghdad, only diehard naysayers and withdrawal ideologues will love No End In Sight.",1208563200,14,4924,5.04054054054054

I wouldn't say that the film is completely objective. However, as the filmmaker interviews top government officials, the facts make a strong argument against how the Bush Administration handled the war from the very beginning. You also get perspectives from military officers who have been in the field, journalists on assignment in Iraq and various political figures involved. While the documentary isn't objective, the facts are hard to dismiss because it comes from numerous credible sources.

But, the attention Micheal Moore gets can be a distraction from the issues at hand as well.

What I thought would have been extremely effective would be a well crafted, dispassionate (""cool headed"")documentary that simply laid out the indisputable facts, had interviews with relevant people, along with some good footage of the places and people that are in the center of this disaster.

The movie never attempts to lecture its audience, and lets the interview subjects portray the situation from their own perspectives, which is rare for such emotionally-charged topics.

For me, the two most shocking scenes were:

1. The footage of the museums being looted - thousands of years of history about the first human civilizations are gone forever.

2. The random shootings by contractor's bodyguards, arbitrarily firing machine guns out of car windows at other vehicles.

Everybody should watch this movie - it's by far and away the most important film of 2007. Regardless of whether you're Republican or Democrat, it's impossible to see without concluding that the US government lied to its people, mismanaged its own army, and systematically destroyed post-war Iraq through lack of planning.

The major decision 'deciders' who spent their time in Washington would not consent to being interviewed.  Probably hard to defend the indefensible.  And, on some crucial facts, it seemed that Bush had not even read the summaries.

The main focus is on the two major mistakes, which was de-Baathification, and disbanding the Iraqi army.  And to examine that, they had interviews with the principals who were in Iraq and supposed to be in charge.  Extensive interviews with General Jay Garner.

The only drawback that I felt was overlooked was the bombing of the Askariya shrine in Samarra that ignited a civil war between the two major religious sects.  This happened in February 2006 and could have been covered in the film.

After all, even a malevolent intent can be handled competently; but this was just one bungle after another.  The only downside to the film is that, because it relies so heavily on interviews with officials involved in the various stages of the war's execution, it tends to get a little plodding.

I appreciate the fact that they're trying to stress a point, but it's nice to see the other side so that the I can best judge for myself. Barring that, I at least want to see an attempt made at getting the other side; perhaps a journalist chasing after someone who doesn't want to talk about whatever subject is being focused upon.

Which brings me to NO END IN SIGHT. Anyone with any wits about them knows that we're involved in a war that is heading straight into the toilet. The U.S. has spent billions upon billions of dollars and lost thousands of armed forces personnel for a cause that is often quite unclear. Are we there for the U.S.'s best interests? For the oil? For the world? Muddied is an adequate descriptor.

What No End In Sight does is show us, precisely, how we got where we are today. And director Charles Ferguson pulls out all the stops, trying, succeeding, and sometimes failing to get the higher-ups of the higher-ups on video, explaining what went wrong. No one is left out. Whether its archived footage or direct interviews, Ferguson puts it in perfect perspective for all viewers.

From inappropriate foreign relations assignments by the Bush Administration (they often sent over field personnel who had no foreign relations experience and didn't even speak Arabic), to failing to listen to commanders on the ground, the entire restructuring of Iraq was doomed from the start. Completely disbanding the Baathists and the Iraqi army not only caused an extremely dangerous increase in unemployment, it also aided those with no love for the U.S. in the first place to embrace fundamentalism (see Roadside Bomb-Making 101).

It is to Mr. Ferguson's credit that he tried to get politicos like Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell, George Tenet, Donald Rumsfeld, and Dick Cheney to agree to interviews. When they refused, he put up on-screen the words ""{This person} refused to be interviewed for the film."" I like that. I like it a lot. It shows that the director wasn't afraid to get the other side of the story, that he tried. And when he failed, he wanted the audience to know it. It is also very telling that these highest of higher-ups didn't want to answer some very tough questions surrounding their involvement in the early Iraq War.

What makes this documentary so great, though, is that it's laid out in uber-easy points, following one problem until it intertwined with another, then another, then another, showing that not only is this ""war"" a terrible injustice to the people of Iraq, but to the U.S. as well since it's our tax dollars that are funding such incompetence.",1202515200,9,2670,4.833698030634573

In the documentary, ""No End in Sight,"" filmmaker Charles Ferguson attempts the nearly impossible feat of trying to make sense out of an historical event - in this case the horribly botched Iraq War - while that event is still going on.  Yet, against all odds, he has succeeded magnificently in his endeavor.  Like Thomas E. Rick's superb book, ""Fiasco,"" ""No End in Sight"" chronicles the series of missteps, blunders and, in some cases, deliberate acts of malfeasance that went into the planning (or, in many cases, the sheer lack of planning) for the post-war phase of the Iraq invasion.

Ferguson spends a few moments up front questioning the justification for the invasion itself, but his primary concern lies in trying to figure out why the post-war stage was bungled so badly.  Very little of what Ferguson reveals in his film is news to those of us who have been following the situation closely from the beginning, but it's nice to finally have it all laid out so thoroughly and succinctly in one place for all the world to see.

Although he aims his sights squarely at President Bush, Vice President Cheney, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, accusing each of them of duplicity and incompetence in their handling of the war, Ferguson reserves the majority of his opprobrium for then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and L. Paul Bremer, the chief administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority from May 2003 to June 2004, both of whom, not surprisingly, refused to be interviewed for the film (as did virtually all the other key players responsible for the fiasco).  Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz are shown ignoring all the warnings they received from military experts (prime among them General Shinseki) about potential problems they were likely to face in a post-war Iraq, particularly in regards to the number of troops that would be needed to effectively secure the country and ensure a peaceful working transition to a new government.  Ferguson goes through a list of boneheaded missteps, starting with the failure to establish martial law and to rein in the looting that began almost immediately following the fall of Saddam Hussein.  Thanks to miserable planning on the part of men like Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, what the Iraqis ended up with was a totally dysfunctional country, one in which there was no working police force; criminals flowed out of jails and directly into the streets; rapes, kidnappings and murders became common everyday occurrences; women were suppressed; and civil war broke out amongst various sectarian factions, each of them jockeying for position in the power vacuum that emerged and deciding to take by force that which they felt was rightfully theirs.

Ferguson then moves on to skewer Bremer, the man who instigated the policy of De-Ba'athification, which resulted in mass unemployment and the disenfranchisement of large segments of the Iraqi population, a condition that only fed the flames of resentment and anti-American hatred.  Even worse, according to Ferguson, was Bremer's decision to disband the Iraqi army - a move to which even Bush himself was reportedly not privy - leading millions of enraged armed men to mount an insurgency against not only the coalition forces but opposition parties in their own country as well.

Add to all this the inadequate armor for the troops, the flagrant misspending of billions of dollars earmarked for reconstruction, the unguarded weapons caches scattered throughout the country and one can see why the Iraq War has become a human and military disaster of monumental proportions.

As a filmmaker, Ferguson lets the facts and the people he interviews speak for themselves (some of his most convincing subjects include Jay Garner, Bremer`s predecessor in Iraq, Colonel Paul Hughes, who worked in the reconstruction effort, and various soldiers and marines who did the actual fighting).  Through them, we get a clear-eyed vision of what happens when incompetents are put in positions of great power and when ideologues and zealots are allowed to run roughshod over calmer, more rational thinkers.  Indeed, Ferguson points out that virtually none of the people responsible for this disaster had any real understanding of or familiarity with Iraq and none had themselves served in a wartime military.

How things will eventually turn out in Iraq is anybody`s guess, but ""No End in Sight"" will continue to serve both as an important document examining the past and as a chilling warning for anyone contemplating a similar endeavor in the future.",1201651200,9,4601,5.139223560910308

The level of ineptitude with our senior DoD leaders is apparent throughout the film.  Ferguson interviews many officials with inside knowledge of the war's planning and conduct.  The information presented here is consistent with other accounts of the war, to include Bob Woodward's 'State of Denial'--probably the best book on the same subject.

Including bombings at a religious gathering and another at a funeral.  I believe that it is, in fact, the writer of the aforementioned review that does not have a grasp of what is going on in Iraq.  In any case, this documentary is well-done and does outline some interesting facts.  It may be slightly biased, but only due to the fact that the Bush regime has made some grievous errors when it comes to Iraq's postwar strategy.  (Even if Bush himself was not aware of some of these errors) If you have any appreciation for information then I would recommend this.  If you unrelentingly support Bush, Rumsfeld (no longer secretary of defense - go  figure), and the rest of his administration even though they aren't even fiscal conservatives and you vote based on the hope that somehow Roe V Wade will be overturned and that is your only criteria for a presidential candidate.. then you probably won't take anything away from this because you refuse to see or hear anything that doesn't fit into your agenda.  I don't know what your agenda is because you aren't even really a conservative, you're bankrupting our country.  Yes; we, the mighty Americans, too can go broke.  In case some of you forgot it was only roughly 70 years ago that many Americans couldn't even put food on the table.  That time, a war saved us.  It generated jobs at home and revived our economy.  However, this time the manufacturing jobs have been outsourced largely to other nations and many of the military jobs have been outsourced to private organizations.  The suburbanization of post  World War II United States has left us with urban areas relinquished to the poor, resulting in the decay of our cities.

2917019,5,B000U6YJMO,"The power of the cinema over the written word is exemplified by watching the powerful documentary ""No End in Sight"". I had already read ""Fiasco"" and ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"", so I was not surprised by any of the revelations in this documentary. In fact my son watched it before I did and I asked him what he thought - he said ""you won't see anything in the movie, you don't already know'. That said, this is one documentary that as Roper said""Every American should watch"", even if you already know the subject material. I wish I had the money to send a copy of this movie to every member of Congress. John McCain was correct in his damming of the Donald Rumsfeld strategy which the other Republican candidates view as heresy. Rumsfeld comes across as a real ""bad"" guy, after seeing all of the film clips of him with his idiotic comments. If you look up the word arrogant in the dictionary I would not be surprised to see his picture. Other bad guys are Paul Wolfowitz and a Slocum who did consent to interview. His comments tell you everything you want to know about the Bush administration. This film should be on the political science curricula of our major universities for it's inights into politics and policy and how the power of group think works and the fear that keeps good public servants from coming forward to expose incompetency at the highest levels. My wife who hates these types of films was moved by it, especially by the way we treated the average Iraqi's who started out welcoming us, and the way we let the entire city of Baghdad be trashed by a bunch of thugs while our military stood by and watched.  This film will make you angry. As one of the few women that worked in Iraq trying to reconstruct the country said ""if there were two-three ways to do the right thing and 500 ways to do the wrong thing, we did the 500 wrong things.""

2917021,5,B000U6YJMO,"Excellent documentary on the perversion this Administration has foisted on the American public under the guise of the ""Iraq War.""

The creators bypass the element of the lie that led us into this deception, but take up with the way this action has been carried out.  There was no planning, no preparation, no concern for consequences.  Advice was not sought and was not accepted.  Unqualified cronies and loyalists were selected over experts to fill positions and determine policies.  The Iraqis were not brought in as partners, but were subjugated to our command.

What I found exceptional about this film was how it imparted to the viewer the experience of the Iraqi people.  You share their somewhat qualified sense of hopefulness as the invading army rolls in.  Perhaps it will lead to something better.  We promised ""democracy"" and all the benefits that would come with it.  We were there as ""liberators.""  So they waited.  But what followed was rampant looting and lawlessness.  Shops, museums, schools, factories, hospitals all stripped not only of equipment and supplies, but down to the wiring and rebar.  The army, which was mandatory and a source of employment for Iraqi males, was disbanded (but left armed).  Bremer imposed ""de-Bathification"" which prohibited those in the Bath Party from normal employment.  (Membership in the Bath Party had been a requirement for employment under Saddam, and was not necessarily indicative of loyalty.)  Government food rations were cut off.  So there was massive unemployment, no income to buy food, no hospitals, no schools, limited safe water, lack of electricity, etc.  The ""liberators"" turned a deaf ear to the Iraqi people.  So the liberators became unwelcome occupiers, and disgruntled citizens became insurgents.  The troops the citizens had once welcomed, were now the same troops breaking down their doors at night and carting off their husbands, sons, and fathers.  The viewer internalizes all this from the Iraqis perspective and is left with a sense of anger.

These events unfold as interviews are conducted with government and military officials.  It becomes clear that the Administration was repeatedly advised of the circumstances that were developing, but the warnings were ignored.  Those who complained were removed from their positions.  Those here at home made light of the situation.  The public was reassured that all was going well.  The interviews reveal the discrepancies, as officials disclose the information they conveyed and the indifference they were met with.

2917028,5,B000U6YJMO,"Watching this DVD doesn't replace reading a good history of events such as FIASCO (Thomas E. Ricks). But its visuals reinforce a lesson.

This is the banality of evil.

In American discourse, ""Nazis"" and ""Fascism"" are ex nihilo, emerging, as maggots were said in the Middle Ages to emerge from meat, from nothing: in American discourse, Nazis appear as they do in Indiana Jones, suddenly and unannounced, Nazi Space Monsters from the Planet Bnarg.

Which of course makes it bad behavior and farting during the sermon to use ""fascism"" in reference to people or institutions in American life, despite Adorno's and Arendt's desire to participate in a real ""never again"" project (unlinked at the time to the survival of an apartheid state whose name I'd rather not mention)...in which the preconditions for some sort of fascism (fascism having strong national variations) in smirks, winks, sighs and idiotic grins.

Such as Walt Slocombe's idiotic smirks when he confirms through his pathetic attempts to lie on this DVD. Slocombe was more concerned about having a cozy deal in the Green Zone than the fact that Arthur Bremer (the clown in the Brooks Brothers suit and Timberlands boots) ""de-Baathified"" Iraq through an idiot mass layoff.

With his stupid post-Iraq beard, Slocombe is in fact the face of world-historical evil: its origin: the belief, in fact, that events make no sense, cannot be known, and that our at best partial control of events, by exposing our inadequacies, means that there's no point in even trying a more complex plan, which would keep the Iraqi army and police force together.

Slocombe is the man in the glass booth and an Eichmann. Bremer's policy was of course no mass liquidation of Jews. But if it had been, Slocombe would have gone along to get along.

One's shame for one's country increases when this DVD shows the United Nations' Sergio de Meilho bravely setting up HQ in an unprotected area only to be ignored by Arthur Bremer...and martyred in a truck bomb explosion not even noticed by most fat Americans as they sit gaping in front of their made-in-China HDTV sets.

There is no end in sight. Hilary is going to get elected and then she will become a monster, an Imelda Marcos, Indira Ghandi or Lady Macbeth. She will be compelled by the tragic equations of American politics to hang ""tough"" in a country where voters are little more than ""gang leaders of the self"", people without hope, without love, and filled with fear, raging against the dying of the light.",1197676800,,2500,4.865882352941177

The documentary history of planning for and fighting the war in Iraq.  Told by insiders and advisers to Rumsfeld, Bush, and Cheney.
""All but 25 to 30,000 troops will be out of Iraq by August 2003.""
  -  A Bush spokesman on March 19, 2003.
The persons appointed to handle postwar Iraq avoided expert advice and held to their ideological mission.  They alienated the Iraqis and doomed the reconstruction process.  The reaction of the Iraqi people became ""Leave Iraq to the Iraqis"".  Basically, Paul Brenner, the Rumsfeld/Bush/Cheney man in charge, destroyed the government, the educational system, and the economy. He purged government officials who could have helped reconstruct the country.  He disbanded all of the military and police forces -  500,000 became unemployed - many of which joined the insurgency instead of supporting reconstruction.  This documentary follows the ongoing efforts to end the violence.  The problems only get worse.  Total economic cost of the war is closing in on $2 trillion.  Who do you think is going to pay for this?  Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Brenner?
And, there is ""no end in sight"".

2917053,3,B000U6YJMO,"No End in Sight is okay at best.
To its credit, it lays out in a convincing manner the Bush Kabal's now-obvious lack of interest in successfully facilitating a stable Iraq. Beyond that this film falls very short of anything more than reinforcing the prejudices of people who are biased and uninterested in expanding their limited view of a very complex world.
The film is full of techniques that are intended to manipulate viewers emotions . . . the focus on darkness, the narrow camera shots on explosions and fires are classic propaganda media. The film slips in many examples of conclusions from its interviewees that are never substantiated. One person refers to an executive summary of a report and then says ""The president never read it."" Really, how does he know that? Because no one could get Bush's reply we simply can only assume he didn't read it. That is propaganda not journalism or documentary.
The biggest disappointment of this over-hyped film is that it never does much more than taxi down the runway. I would have liked to have seen a third of this film focus on the bizarre direction the Bush Gang of Four took in the post conquest efforts. The rest could have been a fresh informative discovery of the real motivations of this bunch of boneheads. The film quotes some researchers stating that in their opinion the war will cost 2 trillion dollars. Where is that money? In a hole in Iraq? Or is it in the pockets of US corporations? Follow the money. Do some real investigation. Give me something new for my money and time.
Another implication is that some how Rummy and Cheney are morons because they didn't understand what State Department people did. Or that somehow they are incompetent because they were never in the military. It coaxes biased people down the path of thinking this mess was because they were stupid and incompetent. These two guys are a lot smarter than that. So what was their real motivation? Answering that question would have made this an excellent film.

2917055,5,B000U6YJMO,"I personally think that this movie is something that every man, woman, and child of the world should watch because it provides insightful perspective on what went on during the early years. Granted it's not a complete perspective but considering that Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld all declined their time and chance to defend themselves, I dont' see how that one reviewer's rant is relative at all.

I agree that this movie might lean towards being one-sided but I think the main point was to give a voice to those who were being ignored by the incompetant administration. The point of the movie was to show that in the early days of the war, the chance of stabalizing the region and creating an autonomous democratic government was undeniably possible. The blunders of the administration created the hell that it was in 2004-2006. Now, whether or not you agree with the war or not shouldn't prevent you from watching and gaining whatever insight you may, and will be able to take from this movie.

This movie is neither one produced by ""ideologues"" nor is it propaganda... I'm sorry sir, but ideology tends to deal with religious persuasion not an objective documentary like this one. If you found this movie to be pro Christianity or bias towards Islam in any way then you are a sensitive prick who is part of the problem. If anything, you are sounding very much like a Neo-Con citing the recent downsizing in violence as a victory for Bush.

The filmmakers gave a voice to everyone that wanted one, nothing more. It shows what was possible in Iraq and what actually happened and if you can't appreciate that then I will have to say that I'm at a loss for words.

If there was one thing that the movie cleared up for me completely, it was the body dragging done by the Iraqis to the Americans. When I glanced at that scene on the news one day it made me very angry because I could not understand why they hated Americans so much that they'd do that to some random Americans in the region. However, after seeing that home video of the American contractors shooting at people all over the streets for no reason killing dozens, it's obvious why they hate Americans...

Not that I condone such hateful behavior but the problem in the middle east is immensely complicated and will have impacts for decades to come. I think it's every persons' responsibility to try and fully comprehend the situation and the people involved. This movie is a very good start.",1195171200,4,2451,4.651270207852194

The way I look at this documentary is that it's a summary of everything I already knew, plus a little bit more. It goes deeper than other docs go and is more grounded in solid facts.

Why wasn't security a bigger issue? Why wasn't martial law declared, which would have been legal under UN charters and easy for the forces, however few there were, to be carried out? Why was the Iraqi army disolved? Questions like this are discussed.

Campbell Scott's narration does just what it should. It doesn't offer up opinions, the people on the screens do that job beautifully. It transitions and explains things in facts, events, and terms that the people on the screen can't do.

2917057,4,B000U6YJMO,"A lot goes into making a documentary of the breadth and scope of `No End in Sight'.  Yet, one has to go into the movie asking what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish.  `No End in Sight' is richly informative, but it's persuasive as well.  The premise of the film is to show that The Iraq War is a protracted tooth ache; one that needs to be pulled out or remedied in some fashion.  Reflecting during my viewing, I decided that the filmmakers were more than likely liberals, but their tactics drew from conservatives` sympathies.  Instead of  ""primarily"" focusing on the toll that, say, any war can bring, their main focus is to illustrate the missteps of  planning for the war.  The documentary does an excellent job of showing the beginnings of triumph when American soldiers were greeted as liberators--only to turn to chaos and occupation.

One way of looking at the film is to say that in all wars things go wrong.  I've always believed that ""war"" and ""contingency"" are synonymous--synonyms really.  Having said that, The Iraq War is also about a ""preemptive war"" as even George Will has described it--one that has great risks inherent in its deployment.  The movie does provide some accountability for the judgment of key players, particularly former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Bremer.  Many former advisers are presented who criticized the administration and offered counter proposals.  Despite the biases, I believe liberals and conservatives could both find something to draw from the film.  Free elections and reopening schools are the brighter side of the difficult situation.  And, to the film's credit the positive developments are also underscored.

Interestingly enough, as a candidate, Gov. George Bush said during his debate with Al Gore that the armed forces are not for ""nation building,"" but are meant ""to fight and win wars.""  Understandably some revision needed to take place after 9/11, but one often wonders what would have happened if President Bush had stuck to his guns.  During the Clinton years, conservatives like Jeanne Kirkpatrick objected to the use of ground forces in Kosovo for about the same reasons we are seeing today.  While it may be argued that Kosovo and Iraq are located in completely different regions, the movie has the effect of begging many questions.  I personally wouldn't want the film to demoralize our soldiers whose noble pursuits may have the effect of fighting Al-Qaeda, so we don't have to at home, but some of the film`s focus is to say how even they could have been served better.  Lieutenant Seth Moulton, who is interviewed extensively during the video, may not represent every soldier's beliefs, but his thoughts are telling nonetheless.  'No End in Sight' does an admirable job of answering two questions:  What happened?  and What if...?

Every administration has wise men (and women) giving alternative advice that would have altered the course of history.  Surely even Lincoln, who provided success during the Civil War only a short time before his second election, had to have advisers whom he should have listened to first.  And that's the main premise of the movie:  Take those with alternate reasoning and interview them as how failure could have been averted and success would have been more accessible with the war in Iraq.  Surely, things could have been done differently.  Just like the film, at least that's something most of us can agree on about Iraq.",1194220800,4,3449,4.9982456140350875
2917058,5,B000U6YJMO,"""No End In Sight"" is the best documentary yet made on the disastrous fate of Iraq at the hands of the Bush White House. It is quite possible that historians and scholars will include this as a valuable visual source of information in the future when discussing the illegal occupation and destruction of Iraq. Like Errol Morris' ""Fog Of War,"" this is a valuable piece of film because it is not based just on paper documentation or the opinions of analysts, the information here is spoken by the very people who were part of the team that was supposed to reconstruct Iraq and set on the course for a transition to democracy, instead they became helpless witnesses to the birth of a horrific quagmire. The information shared here is devastating, it gives us a rare glimpse into the incompetence and sheer ignorance that went into the planning and execution of this war. We learn about the important historical and social facts about Iraq that were discarded by Bush and his cronies, the horrendous looting that was allowed as soon as Baghdad fell and how American troops simply stood by as priceless national monuments like the National Library and National Museum simply burned. The disastrous tenure of Paul Bremer as the practical czar of Iraq is discussed, and how his idiotic decisions including the disbanding of the nation's armed forces contributed to the chaos and violence that later became a full-fledged insurgency against the occupation. ""No End In Sight"" makes it quite clear that Iraq was a bad imperialist operation conducted by people with no understanding or desire to understand the nation they were pretending to invade and rebuild. For nationalist Americans this will be a hard film to bear, but it must be seen. In meticulous detail we see how we have been trapped into an endless guerrilla war similar to if not worst than Vietnam. There are moments of tragic, enfuriating comedy as an official describes how 20-year olds fresh out of school were put in charge of Iraq's traffic plans, there are atrocious tales of troops raiding homes at night, terrorizing civilians, and yes, supported by video evidence. There is even footage of private contractors randomly shooting at passer-by vehicles. We have stolen Iraq from the Iraqis and turned it into a calderon of violence, ""No End In Sight"" must be seen by all concerned citizens because as I mentioned, it is straight from the horse's mouth, no second-hand witnesses, these were the people directly involved. A disturbing picture is presented of a White House in denial, of a President blind to the consequences of his own devices, and a nation torn apart by imperialist war. The film also goes through important moments of history, including the Reagan administration's own support of Saddam Hussein even as he carried out his worst atrocities. Future generations will look back at a film like this and wonder why these men were elected to office. ""No End In Sight"" is urgent, it must be seen, now before later.",1194048000,8,2982,4.895256916996048
2917059,5,B000U6YJMO,"November 26 -- OK, just how infantile is this?  Someone who obviously hates political dissent and only wants happy accounts telling how splendidly everything in Iraq is going (whereas the most one can do is cherry pick the fact that there is less killing -- though in every other way things remain awful) just now, in a matter of a few minutes, gave every review that praised this documentary eight (8) unhelpful votes.  Talk about a big baby!  Has political discussion degenerated to this point, to creating multiple accounts to give a stack of negative votes in only a few minutes?  Pathetic.  So reviews that had gone two months with only 2 or 3 unhelpful votes get 8 in 30 minutes.  I wanted to point this out because in a month some coming here might think all those unhelpful votes were given by a lot of people over the course of several weeks, instead of one person with multiple accounts in the matter of minutes.

I'll add my praise for this exceedingly well done documentary.  The difference between this documentary about Iraq and most others is the sheer number of highly placed individuals participating.  If you ever supported the war, this should change your mind.  If you opposed it, it will show you that it was conducted more foolishly than you had suspected.  I was passionately opposed.  I had multiple concerns.  Because of the reports of multiple highly placed former Iraqi weapons inspectors, I was quite confident that Saddam neither had WMDs nor the means to deliver them.  I was concerned that it would be easy to invade Iraq, but that we would quickly become stuck in a quagmire and that it would take years and years to leave.  I was convinced that huge numbers of civilians were die and that many Americans would die as the result of guerilla resistance.  What I didn't anticipate was that the Department of Defense would make everything far worse than it needed to have been.

This documentary will break your heart.  The various participants explain some of the stunningly stupid decisions made during the invasion of Iraq.  The worst was unquestionably the decision to disband the Iraqi army.  We are likely to be suffering the consequences of that horrific decision.  The short term effects were that the United States lost a half million trained soldiers that could have been used to maintain martial law in Iraq until order had been established.  Instead, a half million men were rendered unemployed and a huge number of trained soldiers instantly became insurgents.  Though not all of the insurgency was a result of this catastrophic decision, clearly a substantial among of it was.  The army could also have easily have nullified the threat of the various ethnic militias.  In the long run, not having a well trained and unified army could result in a greater vulnerability to invasion by Iran than ever before.

This is simply one of the most depressing documentaries I have ever seen.  One of the great myths of the past 30 years has been that the Right is better on security matters than the Left.  Prior to the Iranian Hostage Crisis the public did not consider either the Democrats or the Republicans as better on defense.  Given the catastrophe in Iraq, we definitely should view the far Right in particular and the Republican party in general as extraordinarily incompetent on all military and security matters.  The entire affair in Iraq could not have been bungled more completely if someone had tried.  And that doesn't even get into the absolutely staggering waste of money.  The film sites the work of two scholars at Harvard (one of them was Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz) who computed that the likely cost of the invasion and occupation of Iraq will likely amount to almost $1.9 trillion.  I suspect that will turn out to be conservative, because I think we will be forced to stay in Iraq far longer than any of us want.

The film also drove me to a conclusion toward which I have been moving for some time.  I now regard the invasion of Iraq as one of the three greatest tragedies in American history.  The two largest tragedies were the ""peculiar institution"" of slavery and the genocide of the continent's Native American population.  The invasion of Iraq has been a catastrophe on more levels than one can easily enumerate.  I noted the absolutely gargantuan cash cost of the war.  With that money we could have easily funded social security until the end of the 21st century as well as putting in place a universal health care system, and still have had the vast majority of the money left over.  The film doesn't even touch on the fact that much of the cost of the war has been funded not by congressional appropriations, but loans that we have taken from China.  We have further empowered Iran to a degree it has never been before.  By gutting the Iraqi military we have made Iraq extremely vulnerable to invasion by Iran.  The hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians who have died is a moral stain on the US that cannot easily be eradicated.

I have come to two other conclusions.  I honestly believe that the perpetuators of this war -- George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and others -- should be prosecuted as war criminals.  I know this won't happen, but what they have done has been as thoroughly evil as anything that has happened in Somalia or Bosnia.  They should be forced by an international tribunal to account for their crimes.  The other conclusion is one that surprises me.  As much as I detest our presence in Iraq, I believe that there is no way that we can leave before we have rebuilt an Iraqi army and security force.  If we do not, the nation will remain vulnerable to various militias and to threats from surrounding nations.  Iran is the major threat, but northern Iraq is vulnerable to Turkey, which feels threatened by the Iraqi Kurdish population (the Kurdish areas in southern Turkey, which they fear might break off from Turkey to form a new Kurdistan, are among the richest in natural resources in all of Turkey and therefore crucial for the Turkish economy).  I hate the fact that we need to stay because missteps by the Bush administration have essentially painted targets on the backs of every American soldier in the country.

This is a must-see film.  And it provides additional evidence that Bush is the worst of all our presidents.  But I think that is not quite right.  I honestly believe that Bush is not only the worst American president.  I believe that he is the worst American ever.  No single individual American can come close to the amount of harm that he has inflicted on the world.  Unfortunately, we as a nation will be struggled with his tragic legacy for decades if not centuries to come.

The film ends on powerful words by a former American soldier in Iraq.  He asks the interviewer, ""Are you telling me that this is the best America can do?""",1193788800,17,6898,4.717391304347826
2917060,4,B000U6YJMO,"I have not seen No End in Sight yet, but was reading these reviews and just wanted to comment.  First, let me say that you all need to see Iraq for Sale.  See iraqforsale.org for details.  It will open your eyes even more.  I don't think this administration made a ""mistake"" in Iraq.  Thats what they want us to think,  ooooopsie, I tried, giggle giggle.  Bush is an idiot with his snickering.  I think it was a well thought out plan, not by Bush, but buy Cheney, and the other powers that be that has been very profitable and is working out swimmingly for them.  I also think that there is much more to the ""offical story"" of what happened on that horrible day that changed everything, 9/11.  In my opinion, at the very least they KNEW what was going to happen and did nothing to stop it, then capitalized on it and are now making BILLIONS (billions, my mind cant even understand billions) and will continue to do so as long as the war continues.  With profits increasing every year.  That is blood money.  From American soldiers, who are fighting for their country and making the ultimate sacrifices.  If anyone should be making a profit off any war, its the soldiers who fight and their families who should be getting the dough.  Its also the blood of millions of innocent Iraqi citizens who never asked for their country to be invaded and never had ties to any Al-Qeida.  Plans for the war in Iraq we being drawn up BEFORE 9/11.  6 of the 19 ""identified"" hijackers in the 9/11 commision report ARE ALIVE!  ????? Dont believe anything you see on TV, especially Fox News and the like, its BS straight from the White House.  Take the time to do your own homework, like see these films, and google like crazy.  We have to all band together and put a stop to all the craziness.  We are losing our civil rights at an alarming rate.  Next thing you know, our kids will be living in a police state.

2917062,5,B000U6YJMO,"After watching this film in theaters, I reserved it here immediately. I wish something like this could just be broadcast one day during primetime television to show all the people who ignore our blunder in Iraq that there really is no end in sight. Watch this film, it really is amazing. I tend to ignore the news stations in my area because they're useless, but read in newspapers on occasion how the war is going. I really never expected to see the things that I saw in this film, and had absolutely no idea that we really were just destroying an entire nation for no reason. On top of that, it looks like Bush is going to send troops into Iran to ""defend our interests and troops"" (just read the article in the New Yorker about it from Oct. 8th) so I'm hoping that we can essentially do nothing in Iran that we've already done in Iraq. Watch this film, but be prepared for what you see, it is incredibly powerful. When it ended in the theater, I couldn't even get out of my seat, I just sat there for about fifteen minutes trying to figure out what the hell had just happened. I hope you do the same, because the reality of the situation is very grim.",1191888000,20,1154,4.298165137614679
2917063,4,B000U6YJMO,"While, as another reviewer has suggested, this latest documentary on Iraq does nothing to push forward the medium of documentary in its aesthetics or its style, it doesn't need to in order to achieve its aims: to present a clear picture of how the situation in Iraq went from difficult to nearly impossible in the few years following President Bush's declaration of victory.  What makes the film refreshing is that it makes its case in a non-partisan way, since what we really need as a country is to come together and face our mistakes rather than point fingers of blame at each other for our failure to begin the difficult process of recovery from these mistakes.  The film, while very critical of decisions made by the current administration, is not making a case against Republicans per se or against the military, and does not even take a stand on whether we should have gone into Iraq in the first place except to mention what is now obvious to most Americans, that the repeated rationale given for going into Iraq that Saddam Hussein was in cahoots with al Qaeda was bogus.

What the film does present, in a clear and convincing manner, is a brief account of the devastating history of the war and occupation that emphasizes moments where administrative decisions were made in a top-down fashion that went directly against the advice of military and intelligence and other leadership on the ground in Iraq.  The film shows that these decisions progressively turned an initially complex situation with at least a number of Iraqis who were supportive of the U.S. ouster of Saddam into a nearly impossible quagmire - the failure to protect infrastructure and property and cultural legacies against looting, the inability and unwillingness to protect citizens against violence, the removal from office without immediate replacements of civil servants who had previously worked under Saddam resulting in the loss of essential services, most crucially the total disbanding of the army and police resulting in massive unemployment of trained military personnel who had access to weapons that were not being adequately protected.  It is no wonder that many of these became initially disgruntled and ultimately joined opposition forces.  Numerous interviews with high ranking officials whose pleas for reason and common sense were ignored repeatedly by leadership in and appointed by the Bush administration make clear that even if the war in Iraq shouldn't have happened in the first place, it definitely didn't need to turn out as bad as it has.

The scariest part of the documentary is the way it depicts the administration's refusal to accept and report the obvious facts about an increasingly dangerous situation on the ground.  In a telling scene, Donald Rumsfeld suggests to a group of reporters that reports of difficulties (such as looting and insurgency) are wildly exaggerated by the media, and that he even had to look up a few words in the dictionary to understand what the media was claiming, words like ""insurgency,"" and, some one in the audience asked ""quagmire""?  No, Rumsfeld insisted, ""I don't do quagmires.""  The evidence presented by the film strongly suggests otherwise.  Rumsfeld and friends do quagmires quite effectively.  By depicting the quagmire as clearly as it does, the film ""No End in Sight"" at least offers hope of an end to wildly inaccurate depictions and predictions of the current mess from which we and future generations will have to extricate ourselves.",1191542400,36,3491,5.062717770034843
2917064,5,B000U6YJMO,"No End In Sight is a powerful and poignant documentary that every freethinker should see.  It is not a political bashing movie by the leftist but rather an honest recollection of the events leading up to the occupation by the actual individuals involved with carrying out the administration's misguided and ill-conceived plans. It's a tale of honest people following the orders (albeit reluctantly) of a dishonest demagogue and the pain and regret they now feel for being a part of the most unjust military occupation of this century. When will the citizenry of our country wake up to the atrocities being done in the name of ""We the people"" of these United States? It's time to recognize that ""High crimes and misdemeanors"" have been repeatedly committed by the arrogant and ignorant in this administration and that the only prudent recourse is IMPEACHMENT.",1189900800,22,858,5.042253521126761
2917065,5,B000U6YJMO,"""No End in Sight"" is a history of the US involvement in Iraq beginning with the Gulf War in 1991 and continuing up until the end of 2006.  The interviewees and informants are former senior U.S. government officials, including Rich Armitage and Jay Garner, military and intelligence officers, soldiers, marines, and Iraqis from all walks of life. All senior Bush administration officials declined to be interviewed for the movie.  The tone of ""No End in Sight"" is bleak; the music is appropriately funeral.

There's little that we haven't seen before in this movie, but its useful to recall how we got involved in Iraq.  Reverse selection of brains for a thousand years could not have resulted in a bigger mess than created by Messrs. Bush, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, et al.  Perhaps the sub-title of the movie should be, ""The Power of Delusionary Thinking"" because the whole basis of our involvement in Iraq was due to the deluded minds of a few highly-placed US government officials.  This movie brings that out clearly.

The most startling fact to come out of the movie is that the ultimate cost of the war is now projected at nearly 2 trillion dollars.  Some elementary arithmetic establishes that our expenditure in Iraq will be about $80,000 for each and every Iraqi man, woman, and child.  We would have had a better chance of success had we just dropped dollar bills instead of bombs.  A disaster many times over, our most optimistic hope now can only be that the mess we have made in Iraq does not spread beyond its boundaries.

2917066,4,B000U6YJMO,"Both in published reviews and among our citizen reviewers on this site, there has been some criticism levied against this documentary that there is little or nothing NEW presented here.  Naysayers also opine that the film offers little analysis of options and that the title is misleading in that the filmmakers seem to be content to ""rehash"" mistakes of the past rather than focusing on solutions--i.e. discussing likely ""ends"" and getting them closer to being ""in sight.""

I can only speak for myself, of course, but I did indeed learn much that was new to me.  Like many Americans, I had concerns about this war from the outset and was pained to see so many things going wrong so early--almost no sooner than the President had declared ""mission accomplished.""  There was a basic sense that the administration had not adequately prepared for post-invasion realities, but I don't believe that I am in the minority when I say that I didn't have a full grasp of just how bungled that planning (if it can be called that) was.

This film lays out the history of those tragic mistakes concisely and graphically.  There are certain advantages that film offers over even the best, most well-researched prose.  Visuals are but one, but they are certainly an important one.  It is literally painful to see the charred bodies, to hear the screams of the wounded and the dying.  Even the best newspaper accounts or the most exhaustive books can't hit you in quite the same way.  If it IS a rehash, it's a needed one, and a powerful one.

Again, I am speaking for myself when I say this, but I have to admit that I may have been in a strange sort of denial about this war.  I thought I was following the news accounts fairly closely and that I had a basic understanding of what was happening (and failing to happen) in Iraq.  But the film not only made the issues painfully graphic, it also convincingly made the case that even steps taken by the administration that were at least debatable (""de-Ba'athfication,"" the complete dismantling of the Iraqi military) were actual hopelessly misguided and counter-productive.

The looting and pillaging of Baghdad, to which the US administration effectively gave a green light, was an early sign that things were going wrong, perhaps hopelessly wrong.  I recall reading accounts of the destruction of the National Museum--with its 4000 years worth of cultural history lost or destroyed--with some dismay.  Seeing film footage of the same was literally sickening to me.

No two-hour documentary can be as extensive as the scholarly literature and expert journalism that emerges during the course of a protracted war, but there is a reason why the authors of so many recent books on Iraq opted to appear in this film--and they go beyond sheer self-promotion.  A film can serve as a wake-up call, can get necessary dialogue going.  (One can easily make the case that as a nation, we've been in denial about the realities of this conflict for quite some time now.)

""No End in Sight""?  The charges that the title is misleading (since it is pointing to the future while the film's actual focus is on the recent PAST) is ultimately without standing.  The film lays out the reasons for this quagmire (and yes, Mr. Rumsfeld, that's precisely what it is) clearly and logically.  Commentators interviewed DO address the fact that because of those mistakes, there are no good solutions, and that Iraq's future looks bleak no matter whether we stay in force, pull out gradually or pull up stakes immediately.  There truly is no clear end in sight.  And that's downright scary.",1189123200,29,3595,4.815960912052117
