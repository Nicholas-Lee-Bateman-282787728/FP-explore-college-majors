Mainly, the selection of girls isn't great. Not terrible but definitely not Peach's top shelf.

The multiple-angle business on this one is a complete waste and sort of misnamed. Instead of multiple angles it's actually more like two cuts of the same angle in each scene, a moving CU and a static wide-angle.

The saving grace of this DVD is the same thing that most Peach DVDs have going for them, and that is explicit nudity. The seven girls all show everything (including a lot of good rear shots...thank God at least  one company on the market understands the value of a good butt view). Another positive is the brevity of the vignettes. I just don't care for vignettes that go longer than five minutes because there tends to be far too much repetition and too slow a pace. These all clock in at around three and a half minutes...perfect.

Not really worth a buy but don't pass on viewing it if you get an opportunity.",1283040000,2,1136,4.517073170731707

7995714,4,B0000A4G9Z,"One of many Peach DVDs I've viewed. I only get ones that feature one or two babes I really like; if you don't, you may end up with a sexy beer coaster, as these usually have a few babes that do nothing for you.

Girls Night In has a slumber party scenario, but unfortunately does not feature any great g/g action. It does have numerous babes, some of which were really hot (Rachel Elizabeth, MacKenzie Mack and Red Heaven really blew me away; Honey was also a DDlight).

Most of the vignettes are similar; babes on exercise equipment, couches, etc...stripping out of their lingerie, mini-skirts, etc...Very good but DVD is elevated to 4 stars because of some fantastic pink moments - on some of the babes (not all) you get the long, lingering, pink close-ups that set Peach apart from the posers. MacKenzie Mack gets special props - the open leg show she gives here (and in all her DVDs) will have Major Stiffington at full salute! WOW! Hot babes in explicit action worked for me.",1189728000,3,980,4.5625
7995715,3,B0000A4G9Z,"Not super. Staged strippers and not much else. The ""slumber party"" was merely a group of women sitting in lingere and chatting. Beautiful, they were, but boring. The camera work wasn't the best either. Few close-ups.

Some strippers looked a bit uncomfortable, and I don't like fake breasts which most of them had.

Once you've seen it, it's over.

It gets a 3 just because the women were pretty.",1147046400,17,396,4.7101449275362315
7995716,1,B0000A4G9Z,"The DVD has nothing to do with a slumber party.  The flick starts off with all the girls sitting together in nighties telling stories, then five minutes into it, the DVD cuts to individual strip sessions for each of the girls. No slumber party at ALL!!!  This is not what I saw in a previous trailer, and I am highly disappointed.  do not waste you money.",1101081600,11,355,4.348484848484849
