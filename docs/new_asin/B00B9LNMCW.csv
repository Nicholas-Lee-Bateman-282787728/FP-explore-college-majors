8564760,2,B00B9LNMCW,"The DVD comes with a very misleading jacket which would make you think it contains only B&G stories. But its only one story with the two characters. The other three are not with B&G.

The front cover in particular depicts and names B&G only and makes no reference to any of the characters in the other 3 stories.",1405555200,,312,4.379310344827586

8564763,5,B00B9LNMCW,"I cannot overstate how great the entire Scholastic video series is and your kids are sure to enjoy just about any entry in the series.  All of the Scholastic videos are marked by great production values, charming animation and art design, and first rate stories.  The Bink & Gollie video is another winner.  The stories on the video are all themed around friendship: compromising, getting along, helping one another, appreciating differences, etc., and the messages are timeless.  This video may be most fully enjoyed by girls as Bink & Gollie are female protagonists and because the overall tone of each story quite gentle.  Certainly boys can enjoy it too, but this one would be an especially good choice for girls.  Overall, this friendship-themed collection is a delight and is sure to appeal to kids preschool and above.  Recommended.",1385942400,,839,5.036231884057971
