1731522,5,B000069CD1,"Any film viewer who cherishes a well done story and relishes delicious acting from two great actresses needs to take a long and hard look at PAULINE ET PAULETTE.Belgian veteran dames Dora van der Groen and Ann Petersen shared best actress award for this sensitive,comical and  heart-wrenching story of two sisters,one who is mentally-challenged and one who is challenged-mentally. Pauline (van der Groen who has ANTONIA's LINE and VILLA des ROSES to her long credits) has the mental capacity of a child. When her caretaker dies,sister Paulette (Petersen) is forced to have Pauline stay with her. Pauline is an innocent who needs everything just her way;Paulette is also set in her ways as a lingerie shopkeeper and an amateur opera singer. Pauline, childlike, adores her older sister. Paulette cannot be bothered with the intruding annoyance of her simple-minded sister. Paulette packs Pauline off to live with their younger sister Cecile and her French boyfriend,but Pauline WANTS Paulette,so back she comes. The hilarity never lets up and the timing of two magnificent pros with a sharp and clever script clocking in at a perfect 73 minutes is irresistible as a supreme example of a film sharply focused,trimmed of excess fat and served up for a great viewing experience.

For those not familiar with Belgian film,PAULINE ET PAULETTE is a first rate introduction to the world of the European character-driven,actor par excellent movie. Along with films such as DAENS, ANTONIA'S LINE,THE OX,GOOD EVENING MR.WALLENBERG,ELLING,BLACK BOOK,CHARACTER and EMMA'S SHADOW  Flemish cinema is the still, IMO ,undiscovered treasure of moviedom. Folks that enjoy reading will enjoy the well paced,character-filled screenplays of Belgian movies.

On VHS and DVD, PAULINE ET PAULETTE is a bargain for such rich entertainment. IT is in Flemish with very readable subtitles.(You won't even realize that it is foreign after a few minutes)
Great companion films that feature a pair of great acting jobs would be LADIES IN LAVENDER (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith),NOTES ON A SCANDAL (Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett) and IRIS (Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent).",1191542400,,2135,5.3076923076923075
1731523,5,B000069CD1,"Sensitive and humane, but never saccharine, Debrauwer's witty, touching portrait of four sisters avoids all the clichs one expects in depictions of mental disability. Groen (star of ""Antonia's Line"") is a marvel playing the childlike Paulette, a limited, sweet-natured woman whose capacities for understanding are greater than others suppose. Meanwhile Pauline and Cecile puzzle over how they can place her in an institution without losing their inheritance--a condition of Martha's will. With its wry, delicate observations of a family in crisis, ""Pauline and Paulette"" will stealthily win your heart.",1185148800,,602,5.775280898876405
1731524,4,B000069CD1,"PAULINE AND PAULETTE is a bittersweet little slice of life drama about four sisters, three of them senior citzens.  The oldest sister Martha takes care of the mentally retarded sister, Pauline, while the two other sisters have gone on with their lives, the youngest sister Cecile having moved away Pauline doesn't even remember who she is.  Pauline idolizes her somewhat indifferent sister Paulette who runs a small women's fashion shop and performs regularly in local amateur opera productions. Pauline in her limited mental capacity perhaps recognizes a kindred spirit: both sisters have a love of beauty, Pauline forever watering Martha's flowers and never without her scrapbook of pictures of flowers roughly torn out of magazines or from scraps of gift wrap,  Paulette lives in a candy-box world with her rosy red boutique and her small home and it's womanly bric-a-brac, feminine furniture, and perfume. When Martha suddenly dies, the surviving sisters are forced to assist Pauline probably for the first time in their adult lives.

This Belgium movie was a popular title at film festivals when it was first released and among it's rewards was bringing two of the grande dames of Belgium cinema to international attention - Dora van der Groen as Pauline and Ann Petersen as Paulette, both of them about 73 when the film was released although playing sixty-something.  van der Groen is amazing as the childlike Pauline but Petersen has many wonderful moments too as the prententious but not unfeeling Paulette. To me the film's most stunning moment is when the curtain comes down after Paulette's swan song at the operetta and she finds herself quite alone on the stage, her little dream world revealed for the plastic fantasy it was.  This was sadly Petersen's final film, she passed away in 2003.

Director Lieven Debrauwer has a fine sense of human emotions and the movie is beautifully photographed, vividly capturing Paulette's gift-wrapped world and Pauline's austeure existance.  The movie also sharply portrays the hostile unkindness the mentally-changed often face, here from a belittling butcher clerk and Cecile's self-centered boyfriend.  The ending is perhaps unsatisfying to general American tastes with it's meloncholy, slightly unresolved ending but then the movie was not meant to be a Hallmark card.  Director Debrauwer does a very good job in his first feature film, after several short subjects (three of them starring van der Groen and one regrets they are not here as bonus features on the DVD) and his commentary on the DVD is pleasant.  I recommend this film to those who enjoy slightly sentimental films, you will certainly be moved.",1143936000,3,2663,5.169767441860465
1731525,4,B000069CD1,"Very short Belgian film, by first-time director Lieven Debrauwer, 'Pauline & Paulette' may not be seen at your multiplex, but will appeal to the movie fans who prefer the 'bitter-sweet' tale. Thanks to the exceptional acting from the leading ladies, the film is lifted one notch higher than usual European dramas.

The plot is simple. You see the four sisters -- Martha, Paulette, Cecile, and Pauline. Pauline, who loves collecting beautiful paper and watering flowers, is mentally-handicapped, and is now living with Martha, who suddenly dies, leaving the instructions to the remaining sisters, Cecile and Paulette. That is, if they both refuse to take care of Pauline, all of her money goes to Pauline.

As a consequence, Paulette takes Pauline back to her house, where she also runs a small business. And so far, you know, the story development is not surprising. It seems at first going on the familiar road, to the tidy 'feel-good' conclusion, but in the second half, you see, it is not. The subdued ending at the cold seaside town is very memorable, one of the best part of the film.

The film's tone is always quiet, even low-keyed, and there's nothing you cannot predict in the film's story except the final reel which is very insightful. But what I liked about the film best is that it does not deny the possibility that Pauline's life could be fine if someone else, someone outside her family, takes care of her. Some films tend to treat the life in hospital in the negative light. In 'Pauline & Paulette' it is just another alternative way of life.

Beligian veteran actress (75-year-old) Dora Van Der Groen gives impressive acting as Pauline, who could be both very charming and irritating, and equally good is Ann Petersen as Paulette, who suddenly discovers her utter loneliness in an unexpected place. The film starts like a Hallmark entertainment (which I like very much, don't be mistaken), but ends with a slightly bitter taste, which reminds us that 'Pauline & Paulette' is an European film, after all.",1117324800,10,2021,4.88338192419825
1731526,5,B000069CD1,"The centerpiece of this fine little film is Dora van der Groen's portrayal of  Pauline, a retarded woman who is helpless and stubbornly willful, oblivious and conveniently aware, guileless and mischievously wily - in short, a handful to her sisters.  van der Groen creates such an authentic character it's not only hard to believe, it's hard to **accept** that we're watching an actress and not the genuine article. Add to that the family dynamics that slowly, quietly unwind from frustration to grudging acceptance and then to real warmth, and you've got 78 minutes of the small compromises, small reconciliations, and small steps forward that left me thinking, ""Yes, that's the way it should be.""",1102377600,6,698,5.114035087719298
1731527,5,B000069CD1,"I discovered this film about a month ago, and, initially, I must admit, I had reservations as to how good it might be. I haven't seen more than a dozen foreign-produced films, and while some have been quite well done, I came away from the majority disappointed. Everything about this film, though, vastly exceeded my highest expectations-the attention to detail, both in plot and characterization, is exquisite.
The beauty of the plot, along with its actual realization in the film, defies any overly simplistic description that I might relate here, so I will limit myself to the basic theme and the manner in which this theme is expressed. I view the major theme of this film to be that of the treasuring, or cherishing, of ALL individuals-especially those who are often viewed by society as being less than human. Less than human, of course, refers to those people with physical/mental disabilities, who are generally brushed aside and devalued. Lieven Debrauwer's film, through careful plot device and quite humorous (yet still subtle & instructive) dialogue, never falters in bringing genuine and clearly heartfelt emotion to the screen. Quite clearly, this director has a great passion for fine filmmaking; never once throughout the film did I feel that any detail was excluded or otherwise overlooked. Unbelievably, all of this is packed into just slightly over 70 joyous minutes.
The director's commentary on this DVD is superb; watch the film first, and then view the film again with his thoughts and various comments. You will be delighted by his style, and will acquire a wealth of insightful information about the participants in the production.
I cannot close without noting the incredible acting ability of each & every actor in this film; even the taxi driver seems to have been chosen especially for his particularly convincing approach. (If this sounds far-fetched to you, please, please, please---buy the DVD & experience it for yourself!)
If only Columbia had released his two short films on this Region 1 release! I eagerly look forward to the future directorial efforts of Mr. Debrauwer.",1061164800,3,2107,5.110144927536232
1731528,5,B000069CD1,"Before seeing it, ""Pauline & Paulette"" was at the bottom of my list at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival.  I had low expectations for it and only went to see it because my other choices were sold out.  As sometimes surprisingly wonderful happens at these events, it turned out to be one of my favorite films.
This is a story of four elderly sisters, one of whom is mentally retarded.  Dora van der Groen's portrayal of Pauline, the retarded sister, is brilliantly convincing.  Ann Petersen plays her favorite sister, Paulette, the owner of a dress shop whose future plans are thrown into question when Pauline's guardian (another sister, Martha) suddenly dies.  Both Paulette and the fourth sister, Cecile, struggle over who will care for Pauline.  Pauline clearly prefers Paulette and the love these two have for one another is heart-warming.  While it has some powerfully emotional moments, Pauline's misadventures also provide some light comedy.  These moods are all enhanced by the set designs (like Martha's dreary brown kitchen or Paulette's bright red and pink bedroom) and background music (the ""Waltz of the Flowers"" for the garden scene is fantastic).
I'm delighted this film is now available on DVD and I'm very happy to recommend it.",1038700800,2,1256,5.063106796116505
1731529,5,B000069CD1,This Movie was very funny. You must see her water the flowers. Paulette has a cake bed that looks yummy. Pauline likes Jam not chocolate on her toast. Well I hope you enjoy the vul-au-vent.,1034985600,2,189,4.428571428571429

7965428,5,B000069CD1,"I love movies and have loads of them all over my home.  I don't own a lot of foreign films, but I enjoy them so have purchased a few of my all-time favorites.  ""Pauline & Paulette"" is one of them.  It's the story of four sisters, one of whom--Pauline--has the mental capacity of a small child.  The sister caring for Pauline suddenly dies and the two surviving sisters are not keen to take on the challenge of caring for their handicapped sister.  The rest of the film revolves around their disagreements concerning Pauline and their attempts to cope.  For me, this is a funny, sad, and very touching film.  Dora van der Groen's portrayal of a mentally challenged adult is one of the best I've ever seen.  It's a clean film and something I don't mind watching with my young children.  It is a very memorable film that I highly recommend.  Definitely worth buying and watching more than a few times.",1404086400,,898,4.521739130434782

7965430,5,B000069CD1,"We watched this about 10 years ago. My oldest son, who is a special education para-professional, loved it. Since it is a foreign film, it wasn't available anywhere. I was thrilled when we found it on Amazon. I surprised my son with it, and he was surprised to get it. It is a tender movie about two sisters, one mentally-challenged, who have been separated for most of their adult lives. After the death of their oldest sister, they are thrown together and learn to love each other for the special people they are.",1371081600,,514,4.537634408602151
