8600222,5,B00E1SFRFA,Really creepy Lovecraftian horror movie ... Very nice atmosphere of dread achieved ... I thought the lead actor did a great lob and the effects were really good for the budget ... I am a big Lovecraft fan and i loved it ... :):),1516579200,,228,4.204545454545454
8600223,1,B00E1SFRFA,"The people who made this movie definitely did not learn film making from Miskatonic.  I'm sure it was P.U. because man, what a stinker.

I thought I had seen the worst movie ever made before, but this might be a new low in the ""indie crapfest ruination of Lovecraft"".

Aspiring indie filmmakers should have to be beaten with 100 copies of the book they are planning on ruining in a pillow case and if they survive, then they can make the movie because they understand the pain their abomination is going to cause others.",1488758400,,520,4.51063829787234
8600224,3,B00E1SFRFA,Just an OK makeshift film. For that price I was expecting much better.,1484438400,,70,4.461538461538462
8600225,4,B00E1SFRFA,Met my expectations fully.,1458777600,,26,5.75
8600226,3,B00E1SFRFA,"This movie is a ""classical"" Lovecraft movie in that it has the town hiding a secret, everything is not what it seems, New England-Cthulhu cults abound, etc.  Don't confuse the title with ""The Lottery"".  The budget is low and it shows but for what it delivered, it's ok.  Like the 21st century version of the Wicker Man, a man falls in love with a woman and is persuaded to go to her home town and meet her grandparents for the undetailed ""the festival"".  Lovecraft fans know where this is going.  The male lead stays with the grandparents despite the lack of a reason for doing so, especially when he starts to uncover their ""true"" nature"".  Predictable ending.  More predictable- ""he was an author who went insane and killed himself"" ""explanation"" to the outside world.  No tense feeling or suspense of being watched, followed, etc.  If you're a Lovecraft/Cthulhu fan I recommend it.  If you're into cheap, cheesy horror movies I recommend it for you.  Otherwise, buyer beware.",1395014400,10,978,4.796407185628743
8600227,5,B00E1SFRFA,"Creepy movie! Really liked it! This is an alternative take on the H.P. Lovecraft story, this independent horror film has some truly creepy moments!",1384732800,2,147,5.166666666666667
8600228,5,B00E1SFRFA,"The best way to describe this film, is like a surreal fever dream!  Just like the filmmaker describes in the audio commentary track that this is loosely based on the HPL short story. Especially that the short story itself is only a few pages long and the idea to take that story and expand on it is the only way, just like Stuart Gordon did with his films. And yes, there is some nudity in the film, just like in any Stuart Gordon HPL film!

The film is very creepy and atmospheric!  It's like if you took David Lynch and Lucio Fulci and combined them two together this is the type of movie you would get!..  A nightmarish trip!!

The acting is solid and the special effects are nicely done without any stupid computer graphics!  Enough to please the gore hounds out there. It's a simple movie that has the feel of an early 80's piece.  The audio is a bit weak, but overall, I really liked this film!!  I could imagine what the director could have done with a bigger budget!  But it's perfect for what it is and people today rely too much of brainless mega budget films or remakes than an original like this little gem!

Definitely worth seeing..  And again!!",1382486400,6,1159,4.369158878504673
8600229,5,B00E1SFRFA,"This is great for what it is, it's a low budget horror film not a true adaption of HPL like the other reviewer said. It's obviously loosely based on Lovecraft's work, and it's impossible to make a true adaption of his literature even if this was a big Hollywood type movie. It's creepy and grindy, and reminds me and had the feel of those old 70s type horror films. The special effects are uniquely creepy, and so are the characters. Definitely worth a watch.",1382486400,5,459,4.476190476190476
8600230,1,B00E1SFRFA,"This is poorly filmed, the sound quality is poor, while Ms. Guthrie is wonderful to look at, the sex is gratuitous. HPL didn't think it was something which should be in his fiction. The Old Lady is creepy, but in the end the fiilm is low budget and unlike The Dark Sleep, it cannot rise above this problem. Boring.",1380758400,4,314,4.338983050847458
