3479820,4,B001B23ED6,"Reporting for duty and maybe some hilarity as well, it's Popeye the Sailor and his third volume of 32 classic cartoons on two titanic discs.

These cartoons are dated 1941-1943: the WWII era.  And for that matter, Popeye along with his spinach-scarfing demeanor and good sportsmanship has taken his sailor role really seriously on account of him and perhaps the barmy Bluto joining the navy.  I must warn you, however, these wartime classics are very rarely seen, and very controversial at that to those who aren't familiar about them.  Episodes such as ""You're a Sap, Mr. Jap"" and ""Seein' Red, White, and Blue"" totally make fun of and slightly offend the Japanese attackers of Pearl Harbor.  (Thankfully, I have a very deep respect for anything and anyone Japan-related.  Long story.)

Maybe younger veterans shall divert their attention to other classics like ""Problem Pappy"" starring Poopdeck Pappy, ""Nix on Hypnotricks"" featuring Olive Oyl, and my favorite, ""Me Musical Nephews"" starring Popeye's fun foursome, Pipeye, Pupeye, Poopeye, and Peepeye.  Don't forget about some swell special features such as ""Popeye Popumentaries"" like ""Popeye: The Mighty Ensign"" and ""Pipeye, Pupeye, Poopeye, and Peepeye: Chips Off the Old Salt"".  Other features include commentaries on specific episodes, ""Out of the Inkwell"" cartoons, and the documentary ""Forging the Frame: The Roots of Animation, 1921-1930"" where it continues from where it left off from the first volume and tells more about the evolution of animation dating back to the Fleischer studios and beyond.  And if learning about the terrific techniques behind these cartoons wasn't enough, there's a special short called ""Finding His Voice"" where you'll learn about the 1920's technology behind sound cartoons.

So ""Popeye the Sailor: Volume 3"" will make a great addition to the collection.  Hopefully you have the first two volumes as well.  Surely there are more Popeye classics coming soon and I hope you won't miss them !",1230595200,,1978,5.261146496815287
3479821,4,B001B23ED6,"Despite the change in design and content this is still a great collection of old Popeye cartoons.
 This being from the time the Fleischer's lost control of the studio and Famous Studios was born.
 Now Popeye joins the Navy and is designed a lot cuter than before. And since these cartoons are at the time America enters WW2.
 The politics of the day,show up here. Ironically after Max and Dave lose the studio. More offense stereotypes are shown.
 But it was WW2 and the Germans,Italians and Japanese governments were the enemies.
 So you've been warned. Not for little kids,Parental Discretion is advised.",1229472000,,606,4.901960784313726
3479822,4,B001B23ED6,"The final wrap-up of the Fleischer Studios Popeyes. In some cartoons, a shift in role for the main character; he goes from longshoreman to naval recruit. It's a shift in animation style too. The earlier gritty scenery and smooth movement gives way to the more polished backgrounds and zipping pose-to-pose action influenced by Disney or Tex Avery. Some never-aired war propoganda shorts are included. Extras continue with the Roots of Animation and KoKo the Clown. Not my personal favorite of the three volumes, but it great to have the Fleischer Popeyes set complete.",1229472000,2,568,5.118279569892473
3479823,5,B001B23ED6,"Yes, Though this ushers in the end of the ""Fleischer era"", I can happily report that even the entrance of the ""Famous Studio"" series, isn't nearly as bad as I had expected!
  I purposely started watching a few of the cartoons near the end of disc 2, just to see how bad they could be. The first ""good"" sign was that they were still black and white, and though visually, the characters were beginning to look a little different, the nice thing was that there were now some unique and differant stories.
  The last of the Fleischer cartoons are the first two on disc two, and to me, they almost seem like a smooth transition into the ""Famous Studios"" look. In other words, everything seems to nicely meld, and again, these first ""Famous Studio"" ones aren't so bad after all! It seems to me as though the new company was nice enough to keep the same ""vibe"", so to speak, and were still well aware of the roots of their ""bread and butter"". Of course, all of disc one are pure ""Fleischer"", that is, as how they had evolved since the much larger company (by now), had set up shop in Florida.
  This will probably be the last set for me, though, since I recall later on the series changed ""too"" much. But this one's still great!",1227657600,2,1221,4.356828193832599
3479824,5,B001B23ED6,"The start of the 1940s brought about many changes for Popeye. World War II had just begun, and as the United States prepared for its eventual involvement in the global affair, the country's animation studios sent out their best stars to fight for the cause and rally people's support for the troops. The Warners sent Bugs Bunny and Disney pushed out Donald Duck, both of whom found their stardom peaking in this decade. The Fleischers, naturally, drafted Popeye into the Navy. Along with this came changes: among other things, his regular outfit was replaced with a regulation naval uniform which he would wear throughout the rest of his screen career, and he and Bluto went through further design changes, both becoming more rounder  and softer (especially in Bluto's case, if you'll notice his appearances in this set). At this point, the Fleischer Studios were in big trouble. They were in heavy monetary debt to Paramount, as their second feature, Mr. Bug Goes to Town, failed at the box office (being inconveniently released two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor), and their new Miami studio had been costly on its own, not just to move there, but to construct the facility and expand their workforce to work in feature films in the first place. And what's more, the studio was in the midst of its own war, as the co-founding brothers Max and Dave Fleischer grew increasingly estranged from each other for reasons that remain quite unclear to this day. The large debt and the equally large rift caused Paramount to force the brothers out of the control of their studio (especially as Dave Fleischer began moonlighting to Columbia Picture's Screen Gems studio around this time), renaming it Famous Studios in 1942. While the staff consisted more or less of the same people, it would become evident over time that the loss of the Fleischers would also cause the loss of the shorts' trademark personality.

But it seems unfair to compare Famous Studios to its predecessor. While it would lose the soul and charm of the Fleischer works, it would in fact develop a soul and charm of its very own, and they deserve to be looked at in a light such as that. The shorts contained here cover the wartime years, as well as the transition from Fleischer to Famous. The black and white Famous shorts (all of which are present here), seem to try and keep on the Fleischer feel---and perhaps, due to lack of color, they appear to succeed---yet by the end of this bunch, the studio's own personality seems to be evolving out of what they once were. Notable shorts (for me) from Famous at this point are ""Me Musical Nephews"", ""Seein' Red, White, 'n' Blue"", ""Happy Birthdaze"", and ""Cartoons Ain't Human"", as proof that one should not judge that the shark had immediatley been jumped. As this covers the wartime era, the fact that a large number of cartoons here contain Japanese and German stereotypes (more emphasis on the former than the latter, as German references are mainly regulated to swastikas and only two episodes really show any German characters), typical of cartoons during these years. It should be understood that this was done to boost the morale of the supporting public to cheer the country on as it fought its enemies in the war. Thus, they are a product of their time, and should be looked to as relative to it, and that the stereotypes should practically be considered harmless and inoffensive as a result (especially if you see what a lot of programs, such as South Park or Family Guy, have been allowed to put out today) as their caricatures are essentially meaningless in the present day. They are in fact capable of being as enjoyable for anyone and everyone as anything else in the Popeye theatrical series. Several of the shorts also contain references to the war effort, such as supply rationing, that many may not understand today. (A couple of audio commentaries tend to point them out.)

In terms of the DVDs, the video and audio quality continues to be excellent. What I happen to find bothersome is that the extras are lighter than in Volume Two. While we do get three new excellent ""Popumentaries"", the number of commentaries we get are roughly halved from the number in the previous collection. Not only that, but the vintage shorts and the retrospective documentary on animation in the 1920s seems out of place as this collection covers shorts from two decades past all this. However, it could be argued that this is because the collections are now two-disc, and had Volumes Two and Three been a four-disc set, it would have had the extras arranged somewhat like this. Thus, it's sort of okay. But it still makes me wish there were just a couple more things in here. Nevertheless, the collection is excellent when all content is taken together into account. Yet again, this is one that fans of Popeye and Golden Age cartoons don't want to pass up.",1226966400,5,4875,4.760047281323877
3479825,5,B001B23ED6,"Of the three Popeye collections this is the one I was looking forward to the least. Not that I wasn't eagerly anticipating it but there were some thing about volume 3 that I knew I wouldn't be thrilled with. First of all these cartoons were released in 1941 just as World War II was starting and after the 10th cartoon of disc one, `The Mighty Navy', Popeye spends much of his time on a Navy destroyer. I'm not that into the Popeye in the Navy cartoons and his switch to Navy dress whites isn't nearly as visually effective. However the biggest problem is the use of disparaging racial stereotypes as in `You're a Sap Mr. Jap'. The Japanese are shown as buck toothed; jibbering sneaks with coke bottle glasses. I'm particularly sensitive to these kind of offensive stereotypes given that my wife is Asian. `You're a Sap, Mr. Jap' also marks the beginning of the Famous Studio's years and the animation just isn't as appealing as what was produced by Fleischer Studios.

Bluto only appears in a handful of episodes as a navy shipmate of Popeye and Lord has the man let himself go. All the muscular mass has descended into his stomach and rear end. Seriously he looks more like Baby Huey than the classic Bluto. On the upside there is more Poopdeck Pappy this time and even Geezel makes a brief and awesome appearance in one episode. I was never a fan of Popeye's nephews but they only appear in a few episodes and they actually are more entertaining than I remember. Unfortunately Popeye's mooching friend Wimpy makes not a single appearance.

The commentaries have always been one of my favorite parts of these collections but this one is weaker than previous volumes. The first two commentaries on disc one didn't even deal with the cartoon being presented instead they are interviews with the son of one of the head animators. The Popumentaries were rather light this time having only a single one dealing with Popeye's obnoxious nephews.

I've been a bit tough on this collection but in no way do I want to dissuade anyone from purchasing it. None of the episodes are bad per se but they were better when produced by Fleischer. In fact volume 3 features one of my all time favorites, `Alona on the Sarong Seas'. Bluto even manages to whip himself back into shape for this one. If, however, someone is in the unlikely position of being able to only afford one or two of these collections I would definitely pick up volumes one and two before three. On the other hand this collection does feature 4 previously banned episodes; unfortunately they are also the ones most uncomfortable to watch.

At the risk of sounding like a shill for Popeye stuff let me just say that if you love Popeye you have to check out the original comics by E.C. Segar being released now by Fantagraphics Books. As great as these cartoons are NOBODY does Popeye like Segar and these books are as good as it gets when if comes to Popeye.",1226534400,2,2912,4.594230769230769
3479826,4,B001B23ED6,"All of the ""ship door title and credits"" cartoons seem to have the Paramount logo and ""Paramount presents Popeye..."" title cards digitally spliced in from a single source print, after which a grainier and much more contrasty print is used. Looks like somebody had the telecine on AUTO rather than trying to match the different source elements.
Some reasonable amount of digital noise reduction would have made a tremendous improvement in the look of these cartoons. The spocket wear jitter and rapid brightness changes (flickering) are all left as-is for your enjoyment...There is no reason for these newer cartoons to look WORSE than the 1930s cartoons on Vol 1 except for scrimping on the restoration.
The extras are skimpy and unimaginative. Enough with the silent Koko the Clown cartoons! It just takes ONE to show how much the Fleischers improved in just a few years! How about some sample episodes of the 1960-61 TV Popeyes or ""Popeye and Son"" or the sorta gay Minute Maid orange juice commercial, or a side by side running of an original B&W Popeye with a horrible retraced colorized Korean remake with the pink and mustard color scheme?
Still, these cartoons on Vol 3 are probably the most fun of the entire series, particular the politically incorrect ones.",1226275200,7,1266,4.948356807511737
3479827,5,B001B23ED6,"Is it kind of ironic that this DVD set was released on election day? I'm pretty sure I am in the majority that I bought this set on the day of its release, but did not have a chance to watch it until the day after due to the election. We were originally supposed to have this set on September 30, but it got delayed in order to prevent the issues that arose with Volume 2. While I was disappointed about the delay at first, let me just say it was worth the wait.

After watching disc 1 last night after work, and disc 2 this morning, I can't more than recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of Popeye or Golden Age animation. This set appeals to both the casual fan and the hardcore collector. And what is best about the format Warner's is following is the fact that they have chosen to release the Popeye shorts in chronological order, something they could've (and should've) done with Tom and Jerry.

Disc 1 starts off with 1941's ""Problem Pappy"" and ends with 1942's ""Olive Oyl and Water Don't Mix"". The first 7 on this disc are the last to have the ship-door opening title sequence. The remaining 11 cartoons on this disc (as well as the first 4 on disc 2) go to a new opening sequence that features a close-up of Popeye's pipe ""toot-tooting"" in sequence to the opening theme. Among the best shorts on this disc are ""Problem Papp"", ""Quiet! Pleeze"", ""Child Psykolojiky"", and ""Pest Pilot"", which have Popeye paired with his troublesome father Poopdeck Pappy. Also among the best on this disc are the first few Popeye shorts that relate to World War II. The first Popeye short with a wartime theme, ""The Mighty Navy"" was actually produced before America entered the war (the identity of the enemy is kept secret), but it was quite obvious at the time many Americans knew their country would eventually be involved in a war. Other wartime greats on this disc include ""Blunder Below"" (unedited here; most TV airings have edits) and ""Fleets of Stren'th"".

Disc 2 starts off strong and kind of lags towards the end. I will admit, I am not much of a fan of anything made post-Fleischer. The first two shorts on this disc are the last two produced by the Fleischers. The next 14 are among the first Popeye shorts produced by Famous Studios, and also the remainder of the Popeye shorts filmed in black-and-white. Actually, the first two Famous shorts credit Paramount since a studio name had not been decided upon yet. The real gems on this disc are the wartime shorts that can't been shown on television today, which include ""You're a Sap, Mr. Jap, "" ""Scrap the Japs"" and ""Seein' Red, White n' Blue"". All three of these pretty harshly stereotype Japanese and may offend some (especially anyone who is of Japanese descent). The way they are presented in this collection, however, is the right way to present them on a commercial release. Having them released in chronological order (and having ""1941-1943"" in the program's title) will caution many who may be blind to the fact that such racist depictions did exist back then. Also, like many people have mentioned in reviews for other classic-era releases by Warner, there is a disclaimer at the beginning of the disc explaining the context of such stereotypes. Since most people probably know ahead of time, I doubt this set will suffer the same fate that ""The Golden Age of Looney Tunes"" did almost two decades ago when the inclusion of a certain wartime short named ""Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips"" caused controversy to the point where the set had to be recalled. Aside from those three, Popeye also battles the Nazis in ""Spinach fer Britain"" (which has had limited airings on ""The Popeye Show"" that used to air on Cartoon Network). Other great cartoons on this disc include ""The Hungry Goat"" and ""Happy Birthdaze"", the latter of which is the first of three cartoons to feature Popeye's friend Shorty, whose name is a perfect description of the character.

I am not going to go into much detail of the bonus content on this set. In my opinion, the best feature was a Popumentary about the wartime shorts. Also worth watching is the feature on early animation from the 1910's through the 1930's. In addition to that, there are two more Popumentaries and a handful of Fleischer ""Out of the Inkwell"" shorts that feature Koko the Clown. However, the bonus shorts are from the silent era, and may be hard to sit through if you aren't used to watching a film with no sound, because absolutely no music tracks are played with these films.

Overall, this volume is on par with the first Popeye set released in terms of quality. Like it was explained many times before, the delay in the release of this set was to make sure all the cartoons are presented as close to original as possible. Not a single cartoon on this set has any A.A.P. produced titles, and once again, Warner's has done a terrific job with their restoration efforts. These cartoons never looked so good, and I no longer have to dig through all those VHS tapes in my basement which I used to tape these cartoons off of TV. In conclusion, if you haven't already, you should buy this set.

One last thing (sorry to go off-topic). I have heard that people have finally received their volume 2 replacement discs. I haven't ordered mine yet, is it too late to call? If I do call, how long should it take? As long as it would arrive within the next 4 months, it should arrive before I move to a new address.",1225929600,29,5404,4.548818088386434

3479831,5,B001B23ED6,"Our spinach-eating sailor surely serves his purpose at the end of his term with Max Fleischer. While these cartoons are much more polished than the earlier shorts from the 1930's, it became evident that Fleischer Studios (and successor company Famous Studios) became aware of the screwball animation coming out of Warner Bros. (Bob Clampett), Universal (Walter Lantz), and MGM (Tex Avery, who arrived from Warners in 1942) and did not want to be left behind. On top of that, the top brass at Fleischer Studios also saw that the war overseas could soon reach America, and what better wartime mascot for a cartoon studio than Popeye (though the Fleischers also started making Superman cartoons with wartime adventures of his own)?

What is important to remember is that there are a few cartoons from the early Famous Studios era on this release that show Popeye The Sailor beating up Japanese sailors and spies. While such content is considered politically incorrect today, it was nonetheless used to boost American morale.

If you want to see Popeye as a true American hero, this is it! If you want a glimpse of animated propaganda, this is it!

That gave many of the gags a new flavor. Draft-dodging came up - not Popeye, of course, but the perpetual bad guy Bluto. So did life aboard a naval destroyer, and plenty of sight gags around guns, warships (he's a sailor, after all), and military life. A bad guy in one cartoon was a hoarder, against the background of wartime rationing. (It's hard to imagine a pile of tires or sugar stirring much emotion toda.) It also gave plenty of room for unfortunate stereotypes of the Japanese and German enemies. The apology at the beginning of the disk is scant warning for the negativity of the images. But, we haven't wholly outgrown that - some editorial cartoons about the recent Mid-East wars have been just as blunt and unkind.

Those propagandizing slurs weren't the only disappointments. For whatever reason, I saw far fewer of the lovely backgrounds I enjoyed in earlier cartoons, and the rivalry between Popeye and Bluto softened a lot. Perhaps enmity between warfighters on the same side had to tone down. Although these remain capsules of the time they came from, like bugs in amber, I didn't find the artistic and social richness that earlier cartoons displayed.

3479861,1,B001B23ED6,"Ordered Popeyes The Sailor 1938-1940 & 1941-1943 DVD sets and chose the 2-day shipping, I wanted to get it on Friday Feb. 14th right in time to give them to my mom while she was in town, but they didn't show up until Feb. 17th. The order didn't deliver to me on time as it has been promised.
Then I thought of keeping the DVD sets myself and have the 1941-1943 one opened to watch.  Overall the picture quality so awfully poor and disappointed me, screen jumping up and down got me so dizzy after watching only 3 episodes.  Warner Bros claimed that these collector sets have been REMASTERED, I doubt it.
I already returned the 1938-1940 set to the seller, still thinking of contacting the seller about the 1941-1943 set if I could still return them since it has been opened.",1393113600,,774,4.443661971830986

The final B&W Popeye cartoon, ironically titled 'Cartoons Ain't Human' was worth the price paid. Popeye could have been quite the animator. The asides to the audience in the war cartoons were a perfect fit, and I have not been brainwashed by the propaganda to hate the Germans or Japanese--I understand that many had personal stakes in the conflict.",1383955200,4,490,5.061728395061729

To be honest i wished i hadnt. The difference between the two is startling. It was episode 10 before Bluto appears and the early episodes with Popeyes family (Father & Nephews)are dreadful. It picks up a bit when you get to the wartime ones but they are a bit samey and i don't know if its my imagination but both Popeye and Bluto didn't look the same as in Vol 1.

3479874,2,B001B23ED6,I thoroughly enjoyed volumes 1 and 2 of Popeye classics. Volume 3 reflects a transitional period for Popeye in which he is relegated to nothing more than a hen-pecked fall guy. Even the animation appears to have suffered from the studio cut backs. From my personal view point...don't waste your money on this set unless you are interested only in the historical aspect of this pooped out period of Popeye's pathetic performance. Stick with Volume 1 and 2.,1332892800,3,455,4.846153846153846
3479875,5,B001B23ED6,These 2 disks of Popeye the sailor 41-43 represent the change from the Fleischer studio to Paramount's Famous studio. Just as I remembered them from when I was little.

There are a few war-time cartoons here as well, so expect some stereo-typical characterizations thrown in there as well.

3479877,5,B001B23ED6,"The cartoons speak for themselves.  They are pieces of history, especially the war cartoons.  Today's generation would call the toons racist, but it was only a way to rally the country for war.  It was the animator's job to make the enemy look as ugly and obscene as he could.  You were supposed to hate your enemy, and these cartoons illustrate that fact. The war 'toons are an equal to Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will in terms of propaganda.  These are history.  Also, the commentaries are history as well.  You feel the feeling of the East Coast (Fleischers)v. West Coast (Disney, Warner Bro.s) animator war. A must if you're as big a fan as I.",1305504000,4,649,4.591304347826087
3479878,4,B001B23ED6,"For a wartime cartoon where things got ugly in real life, the stereotypes you see in a handful of the cartoons in this collection are objectionable but dismissable as an anachronism.  Unlike some of the previous Popeye collections, the sound is adequate, not perfect, and the picture has been digitized. The video component of these is as good as it could be, given that these are 67 years old!!  How's your radio, credenza, car, and house doing from 1943?  I thought so.  The film laboratory doing the restoration did their best, and their best was plenty good.

Popeye does not fight Bluto in many of these toons.  He is an opponent, but often they merge their efforts to fight the common enemy, normally Japan.  The brat like kids are featured a few times, as is poop deck pappy.  Eugene the Jeep, wimpy, the Genie, are some of the characters that I do not recall seeing.  Overall, the fight in the Pacific is the most prominent feature, but there are several peacetime toons also.  This should not be your 1st or only collection of Popeye, as it is not inclusive of those missing characters that made it Popeye.  However, the restoration of these toons is very well excecuted.",1284681600,3,1180,4.6521739130434785

3479886,5,B001B23ED6,"Superb picture quality as expected. The cartoons are fascinating as they are a product of their time period. Too many people fear the stereotyping may hurt feelings and perhaps rightly so. However, to ban these from the public is in my opinion an admission that we are not as mature today as we were back then. We certainly are more mature enough to understand that we were at war and cartoons like this was strictly propaganda. What cartoon character did not get into the battle during WWII? Bless the folks at Warners who put out volume three. I look forward to volume four. Only complaint is that they now have two discs instead of four and the price is still the same. Customers are not stupid. They can tell when a studio is trying to make more money by splitting the discs into the same size packaging. Please Warners, go back to four discs-per box set. It'll keep me from shopping around for the best price.",1238198400,2,914,4.5120481927710845
3479887,4,B001B23ED6,"Popeye the Sailor Volume 3 finishes up the B&W cartoons. Disc 1 starts off with more Popeye cartoons with his father Poopdeck Pappy. But as we near entering World War II, the format changes; Popeye's in the navy & is wearing navy whites.

After Baby Wants a Bottleship (the last Fleischer made Popeye cartoon), Famous Studios takes over production (or should I say Paramount kicked out the Fleischers & took control of their cartoon studio, eventually moving it back from Miami to New York). Most of the cartoons from this time period have a war-time theme to them, including some that'll never be aired on TV due to demonization of certain members of the Axis Powers.

Like the previous 2 volumes, the cartoons are beautifully remastered. The Roots of Animation 1921-1930 is good, but not as great as the one in volume 1 (which covers the years 1900-1920) The bonus short Finding His Voice is nice & informative.

And the commentaries? Despite the return of the infamous trio (John, Eddie & Kali), they're also informative despite the small number on this set.

Again this set finishes up the B&W cartoons. Starting in Volume 4, color will be permanently introduced to the Popeye cartoons.",1235779200,2,1190,4.847290640394089
3479888,3,B001B23ED6,"By the time Max and Dave Fleischer lost their animation studio in 1942, the best Popeye cartoons were behind them. Paramount renamed the operation Famous Studios and forged ahead, but Max and Dave's creative spark was sorely missed. Meanwhile, the advent of World War II brought the immortal sailor a welcome relief from Disney-style conformity. Not surprisingly, the wartime Popeye shorts in this 1941-43 DVD set garner the most attention. ""The Mighty Navy"" and ""Kickin' the Conga Round"" stand out among the later Fleischer efforts, with Famous contributing a few gems such as ""A Hull of a Mess"" and ""Ration Fer the Duration."" What becomes evident in the Fleischer/Famous transition is the domestic blandness that surrounds our spinach-eating hero  resulting in weak entries along the lines of ""Flies Ain't Human"" and ""Happy Birthdaze."" Luckily, these misfires are offset by lively non-war cartoons such as ""Quiet! Pleeze"" and ""Alona on the Sarong Seas."" Though the final black-and-white Popeyes remain a mixed bag, the series would enjoy an upswing in quality when Famous switched to Technicolor in late 1943.",1235174400,15,1111,5.27683615819209

3479891,4,B001B23ED6,"I received this set as a Christmas gift and just finished watching it.

While many of you may be offended by the ""politically incorrect"" replications of the Japanese and German characters in some of these cartoons, you can only imagine how people felt back then after Pearl Harbor was bombed, not to mention the impact of WWII on everyone (if you haven't seen it I strongly recommend viewing the Ken Burns documentary called THE WAR, which you can find elsewhere on Amazon's site).

How did YOU feel after 9/11? I'm guessing that's how everyone felt back in the early 1940's also. But instead of Osama it was Hitler and the Japanese! You can't imagine how people in theatres just loved seeing Popeye ""take care of"" the enemies as only Popeye could do!

If you want to see the seldom (if ever) seen war classics, buy this DVD set.

If, however, you're looking for the more common Popeye episodes you may be more familiar with (with Wimpy and more of Bluto), check out Volumes 1 & 2 instead.",1230768000,5,989,4.570621468926554

I grew up watching these as a kid and the DVDs have great features involving character and studio history,art work, and other commentaries by artists and animators. Don't be fooled by the later 1950's and later Popey cartoons which are regurgitations of the old studio, this is ""the real deal"".Politically,racially and socially incorrect as well as stereotypical. NO ONE makes cartoons like this today and none would dare. I watched Popey religiously as a young 5-6 year old and it didn't have any negative effects on me, but other parents may not wish to have their child watch these. These cartoons are completely nostalgic for me and Popey has always been one of my favorites.
