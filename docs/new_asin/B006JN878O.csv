4993658,4,B006JN878O,"This was a fun video to watch.  I've seen it several times now and never get tired of it.  Not only is it interesting, but those raccoons are just so cute you can't hardly stand it.  I suppose that might be part of their ""survival"" techniques if, as the show implies, these citified racoons are just getting smarter and smarter.  Okay, I'm just kidding...or am I?

The show follows raccoons have have learned not only how to live in the 'burbs, but how to thrive.  They wander around backyards and across roads on their own secret trails, hiding out in a varity of places that they've staked out, and engaging in a War of the Garbage Cans with the innocent humans in the vacinity.  It's like a Raccoon Arms Race, as people strive to protect their garbage and the raccoons strive to learn how to break open one more can, undo one more latch, get past one more lock.

My favorite bit was the mother raccoon taking her children out for their first rounds of the neighborhood (after the frightening bit where the babies had to make their way down a terribly tall tree) and hiding out in a garage.  One baby couldn't quite manage wrangling his way inside, struggled for hours, and finally, as daylight was approaching, his mother hauled him inside to safety.

Despite having grown up around raccoons, I never know that their faeces are dangerous and can even be life-threatening and that one should never sweep up behind them without protective gear.

Anyone who loves these bandits will love this show.  A great one for kids to watch.  Informative and fun.",1364515200,,1552,4.6
4993659,5,B006JN878O,I bought this DVD to hopefully learn enough about them to keep them out of my bird feeders.  They are so cute but so pesky and very wiley.  This is very interesting film whether you love them or hate them!,1358035200,,205,4.1
4993660,5,B006JN878O,"This is a fantastic show about raccoons. Too many people think they are scarey creatures, but they can be adorable. They still are wild animals and need to be handled that way, look from afar. I realize any animal can get over populated in a city, but we happen to have an adorable raccoon that visits us nightly and she is a joy to watch. She plays like a puppy with dog toys in the yard, takes a bath in the water buckets and snacks on any left over cat food, looks for bugs too. There were three tiny babies and we watched them grow, but one by one they either left on their own or, unfortunately, didn't make it, but we still have the last little girl raccoon as a nightly visitor and we enjoy watching her. Great informative, educational show at a great price. Thanks Amazon.",1352592000,2,780,4.277027027027027
4993661,5,B006JN878O,"This documentary is very well done. Raccoons are very smart. Raccoons have learned to adapt to their shrinking natural habitat.  This is well worth watching.  I however do Wild Life Rehabilitation, and have a soft spot for Raccoons.  People call them rodents, but they are not!",1347580800,,277,4.978260869565218
4993662,3,B006JN878O,"This is a fascinating account of raccoons moving into the suburbs of Toronto, Canada.  It happens that large areas of Toronto are older-type construction with detached garages and fenced-in yards.  These make it easy for raccoons to forage for food and find places to live. Raccoons are extremely resourceful, intelligent, have considerable physical ability and survive well in an environment like this.  Food, as it happens, was plentiful.  The photography was excellent.  If you like ""critters,"" you will love the filming.

On the other hand, the movie postulates the development of an urban ""uber raccoon,"" as though this is going to be some kind of monster taking over cities and towns.  They suggest that their problem-solving ability with locks and latches is almost human-like and paint a picture of a non-existent threat of super-intelligent beasts.  They are admittedly very adaptive animals who are simply using their skills to exist, feed themselves and make more raccoons.  This is pretty much all raccoons have ever done over millions of years.  No sinister conspiracy here.

To listen to these guys you'd expect to hear of raccoons hijacking automobiles and taking over people's homes.  Some of their selective filming suggests that this is on the verge of happening.  In a sense this adds a bit of humor to the film, but only if you're critical enough to see through the hype.  In other respects, it's just another bunch of careerist young scientists hatching up another emergency that needs a government solution, generously supplied by themselves.  I found myself rooting for the raccoons.",1344556800,10,1606,5.170542635658915
4993663,3,B006JN878O,"This is probably as interesting as a documentary about raccoons can get.

It had some very interesting facts about raccoons that were new to me.  Some unique footage as well, particularly a mother raccoon trying to help her babies get through an awkward, upside down crack in a farm shed.

The pace of the documentary slows down a bit after the middle.

Overall a pretty cool documentary about raccoons.  3.5/5",1344384000,3,410,4.8
4993664,5,B006JN878O,"I'm a Chicagoan and this documentary said raccoons are flocking to big North American cities.  However, here they are roadkill down every other street.  I'm afraid of them in that I heard they can be rabid.  However, while it doesn't surprise me that mice, pigeons, and maggots thrive in human environments.  It shocks me that those slow-moving raccoons do.  This work points to the ways that we may as well start discussing raccoons in the same breath that we bring up dolphins, octupusses, and other ""smart animals.""

The work said that raccoons are helped in many ways.  They have opposable, hardworking front hands like we do.  They are cared for and trained by their mothers like we are.  They have more food sources because they are omnivorous.  They are nocturnal and thus avoid human detection.  But in the same way that viruses seem to get stronger each time modern scientists come up with vaccines.  Raccoons in urban areas are adapting and improving mentally.  Believe me: I know firsthand that the animals can knock over garbage cans and make a total mess.  Moveover, this work shows them being able to open refrigerator doors, unzip tents, and climb through all kinds of stuff.

This work had an international flavor.  I guess raccoons are indigenous to North America, but their importation to other places is wreaking havoc.  When German scientists got folk to put blockers on the storm drains that the critters climb, they learned how to climb over those too.  In Japan, raccoons are chewing up ancient shrines.  Worse, their doodoo and peepee is eroding antique wooden architecture.  There was a cartoon that started a raccoon craze in Japan decades ago.  Foreign folk gotta be careful about appropriating each and every thing that they hear we have in the US.

I was really grossed out to hear that raccoons have worm larvae in their stool that can float on dust particles!  Usually, I'm ashamed to be a renter, rather than a homeowner, at my age, but this work said raccoon doodoo in people's garages can be disease-inducing and even fatal.  The work adds that the animals are not as solitary as we used to think.  They can even be a bit packish.  I heard cats naturally like to kill other animals, but they showed a cat that did nothing to a raccoon that was chomping away at a potential food source.

I do wish they had a comparison group here.  While I just loved the guinea pigs and hamsters I had as pets in my youth, I always got the sense that rodents are just dumb animals very low on the habitat totem pole.  I thought they had so many young 'cuz it's a givent they will be eaten up and killed at steep rates.  So why is the raccoon different?  The work says their only enemy are cars.  I wonder if this is a testament to how we North American humans have killed off so many wolves or coyotes or foxes that could have eaten them.

I'm not a science person in the slightest, but I really liked this Nature installment.  I recommend it highly.",1329004800,12,2968,4.601145038167939

8499511,5,B006JN878O,"Great film, despite the sketchy research. Ive lived my life WITH raccoons. They need water but don't need to live near it. They love family life and love living near humans. They are as lazy as we are. We live in cities because it is easier. Urban humans are easy to manipulate, thus raccoons! The lazier the human, the less they like raccoons. Lazy people can't secure barn or shut a garage door, thus raccoons!

Misunderstood because they usually die young, adult raccoons are calm, behave themselves and respect a good situation. They recognise a few advantageous words like, ""treat,"" ""no,"" and phrases like, ""Excuse me but mama does not need any raccoons in the cupboards."" And all animals love the sound of a sincere, ""thank you.""",1486166400,,735,4.78740157480315

8499514,3,B006JN878O,"I was all ready to love this dvd, because it sounded so promising. My little son loves raccoons, so I thought it would be fun to watch with him. I believed it was a nature program about how raccoons live, survive in the wild and near cities, and that their eating habits and rearing of offspring would be described. I read the back of the actual dvd after it arrived, and half the program is dedicated to the efforts of various places (Canada, UK) to KILL and ERADICATE raccoons! Wtf. Now I can't watch it with my baby son, which is the sole reason why I got this. Raccoons are friends, not foes- they are trying to survive in a harsh environment which has been taken over by humans, and are simply adapting better than foxes and some other wildlife. They are not vermin to be eradicated, they are beautiful, smart, interesting creatures. I am deeply OFFENDED by this piece of garbage program masquerading as a nature documentary, while it's film-makers spend half their time studying the efforts to murder the very animals they just filmed! It's like filming a show about lions, and spending half the time interviewing the hunters on the effective ways of murdering those same wild animals. I gave this dvd 3 stars, because it still contains valuable information about the lives of racoons. It's not a real nature documentary though. Irritating.",1473811200,15,1346,4.7076271186440675

Some studies done by two prominent ""raccoon specialists"", and just some everyday footage of raccoons doing what raccoons do best.  Which is enjoying life to the fullest.  If you are some blood thirsty coon hunter looking for tips on how to hunt and kill these beautiful little creatures, this is NOT the DVD for you to watch.
