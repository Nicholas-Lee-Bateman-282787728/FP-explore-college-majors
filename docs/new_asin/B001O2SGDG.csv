8328944,4,B001O2SGDG,"I enjoyed watching this movie, and being part of this eccentric town for a short time. Great characters.",1442102400,,104,4.833333333333333
8328945,4,B001O2SGDG,"Just Like Home (Hjemve) was very enjoyable, albeit a little simplistic. So much of small town life centers on rumors and gossip, but when it really comes down to it, people will stick together and stand up for each other. I believe this is the basic message, and it is delivered with a lot of humor - and some good women.",1380499200,,321,4.278688524590164
8328946,1,B001O2SGDG,"first off this movie is another movie that mocks Christians and Christianity. It basically says that if you are promiscious lying profane rude brute or someone who likes to ""walk around my garden naked from time to time"" you are ""OK"" . . . ""normal"". But if you are a devout Christian you are ""weird"" and to be ignored or disrespected. . . probably a cult member. It is said how western civilization has turned its back on its roots . . . . Anyway the plot is weak. It it is boring. Perhaps Danes are simple minded boring people who enjoy movies like this.. . I dunno. But it just appeared immature and silly. There wasn't even a plot. Just strange people wandering around having strange conversations while being strange. It seemed like a farce. Perhaps it was. But the entire town was falling apart because someone at some point in time saw some unnamed man supposedly running down the street naked carrying a newspaper. The horror of it all (or the secret fascination) was that they could ""see everything"". Anyway after all of that boring weird conversation what do all the men do at the end of the movie? Strip off in the town square. So maybe it is some ironic point that is being made but it was just a waste of my time. I think American audiences are a little more sophisticated than this.",1325030400,3,1295,4.445378151260504
8328947,5,B001O2SGDG,"I really liked ""Italian for Beginners"" by the same director, and this one is also great. Watch it if you like subtle comedy and kind humor.
I know I will watch it again and again.",1287014400,5,179,4.142857142857143
8328948,1,B001O2SGDG,"I have just received this film, which I saw at a film festival in Canada, and really looked forward to owning.  However, the copy I received will not play on my DVD player.  Is it for the wrong US region?? Will yours play????",1236816000,,225,4.209302325581396
