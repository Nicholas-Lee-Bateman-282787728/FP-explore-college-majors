8531687,3,B00005LKIX,"Prince Charles never should had married if he already was in love with Camila. I find Camila a vulgar person, who is now royalty by marriage. Mistress while she and Prince Charles where married. If I were her, before and after the convenient death of Princess Lady Diana, she should had buried her head in a hole and did not face the public again. The same thing goes to prince Charles which both are shameless in their behavior in there past towards young Lady Diana prior to her marriage to Prince Charles and after.  Prince Charles should had remain unmarried honoring Prince William and Harry due all the kind of heart ship he cause to his sons and spouse at the moment (Princess Diana.)

I thing the Queen mother; Her Majesty Elizabeth II, should pass her crown to his grandson Prince William to bring back some sense of morality, which Prince Charles damage prior, during, and after his marriage with Princes Diana).

I know times has change, but Camilla always will be Prince Charles mistress in the eyes of God and the whole world.",1358553600,2,1039,4.635869565217392
8531688,5,B00005LKIX,"This video tries to be objective towards both Camilla and Diana, but it comes out being VERY pro-Diana.  As an avid Diana fan and supporter, I bought this video on the recommendation of a friend.  She was right - it's wonderful!  It contains fascinating footage and facts that I had never seen or known before.  And the interviews with Royal Historian Dr. David Starkey are fantastic.  I highly recommend this video to anyone who loves Diana and wants the facts spelled out for them by people within the royal circle who KNOW what happened.  The other review of this video listed here must have been based on the title alone... as I stated, don't let the title of this video fool you and keep you from seeing this interesting account.  The prospect of ""Queen Camilla"" is indeed the ultimate fantasy.",1057190400,3,799,4.664285714285715
8531689,1,B00005LKIX,Camilla is most definatley not the Queen of England and never will be. Diana should have been the queen and Camilla has no right to be called the queen. She is simply Charle's mistress and in large part the reason of Diana's death. She was a large contributuion to Diana and Charle's split and Diana being with Dodi Alfad who she was with at the time of her death in Paris. Camilla should not have a video from the Royal Family Collection and most definatley should not be called the Queen. SHE IS NOT!!!,1055721600,6,504,4.372340425531915
