1446744,5,B00005JKXE,"Remember the first time you saw Austin Powers? How your brain kept telling you how stupid this movie is but you laughed yourself silly anyway? Well, for me, this was one of those movies. I honestly laughed, at points until tears came, from beginning to end. But make no maistake, this is not high comedy. This is without doubt one of the stupiest movies I've ever seen. Think Godzilla starring Jim Carrey. The purposely terrible dubbing, the voices that in no way can be interpreted as Chinese, the ridiculous noises used to fill space why the actors lips are still moving.... I know, it really sounds stupid. I guess you just had to be there, and I highly recommend you go. I don't know who was responsible for this movie, but I consider it comic genius. I can't explain it why I found it so funny, but I can't help but smile every time it crosses my mind. I can't wait for the sequel.",1012262400,4,886,4.408536585365853
1446745,1,B00005JKXE,"I saw this movie on the first day of it's release and I have to say if I could have gave this movie ZERO stars, I would have.  The previews made the movie look hilarious, but one thing they didn't do in the trailer was let you know this movie was voice dubbed throughout the ENTIRE movie...including the dog when he barks!!  Another point to make is that the main woman in the movie is overdubbed by a man who annoyingly throws his voice to TRY to sound like a woman and he fails miserably.  He sounds more like Miss Piggy!  The only funny scene was the fight with the cow in the pasture...and you can see this in the previews.  All of these parody movies are getting out of hand.  SCARY MOVIE was pretty good, but SCARY MOVIE 2 and NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE were a little less funny.  I know there are a couple other recent parody movies out there too that I haven't got to see yet (one similar to SCARY MOVIE).  But this one, KUNG POW totally sucks.  It's a total ripoff low budget movie with several attempts to TRY to make you laugh, but you end up leaving the theatre, wanting to go into the film booth and tear up the film to shreds to prevent anyone else from wasting their money.  But I'm sure this film will soon be yanked out of the theatres with no problem.  Watch it be the least popular movie of the year!",1012089600,8,1315,4.158102766798419
1446746,5,B00005JKXE,"When my friends and I got to the theater last night, I was thinking to myself, ""This is going to be the dumbest movie I have ever seen!"" and it was! There is no point to this movie whatsoever, and is probably the most ... movie of the year, but it is also one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!!! The whole movie is dubbed, and that, I think, was very creative. Me, (or any of my friends) couldn't stop laughing! The only part of the movie that really wasn't that funny was the scene where ""The Chosen One"" fights the cow. But besides that, the movie is hilarious. Many people might walk out within the first 10 minutes of the movie, but I encourage you to watch the whole thing. So if you are looking for a funny movie to see, see this one.",1012089600,,747,4.08843537414966
1446747,3,B00005JKXE,"First of all, I would say that this movie takes some scenes, goes to what you would least expect, and does things that you expect even less.  And even when they do that, they sometimes put unexpected things withing the unexpected scenes.
The story revolves around...well thats not important.....
The movie spoofs all of those Japanese movies that have some traveling warrior out to avenge some murder.  As a result, they do that Japanese audio sync throughout the entire movie.
I would give it four stars instead of three but there are some scenes that go on to long.  It might have been funny for 10 seconds, but those scenes just kept on going.  as a result, there is a loss of a star.",1012089600,2,687,4.516129032258065
1446748,5,B00005JKXE,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. Produced by the same guy who did ""Thumb Wars"", Kung Pow is a silly parody of old Chinese kung-fu movies. To create this film they took scenes from a 20-year old Chinese movie, stripped it of it's soundtrack, then redubbed it with new lines and blue-screened in some new actors and props. It's kinda like watching Mystery Science Theater 3000, only much much better. I saw this movie last night, and I'm still laughing just thinking about it. Go see it now!",1012003200,4,507,4.462365591397849
1446983,1,B00005JKXE,"First off, I love this film. Its exactly my kind of humor. However, when originally purchased, there was no indication that this is a Region 2 DVD, meaning it will only play on DVD players coded primarily for Europe and some gaming systems (we have a PS4) after changing the default Region Code. The big catch: you can change the Region Code on a PS4, but only 4 times in total, so if you live in the US and watch a lot of DVDs with it, youd be stuck on Region 2 after the second time you watch this one, and any Region 1 (US) DVDs you have would be rendered useless. I recommend this movie, but not the copy from this seller; its available for much less on Amazon Video, and for much more on Region 1 DVD from other sellers.",1522022400,,725,4.112676056338028

I honestly wise I could wipe me memory of the movie and relive that moment again. It's a cult classic and very meme worthy. This is all kung fu movies mushed into a extreme parody of sillyness.

Famed for its Normandy scene, I believe on the contrary that the depth lies in the emotional performance of Tom Hanks as the captain of a band of ragtag men. His unifying force as the father figure is equal parts comforting and fearless. I only subtract one star for the gore, since my 3 year old was watching, and I think there should be a warning on the front of the box.

1447761,5,B00005JKXE,"This is one of my favorite comedy movies.  The majority of the humor is derived from the absurdity of the situation.  Steve Oedekerk voices all of the characters (with the exception of the one boobed chick) and the audio track is purposely out of sync in the majority of the scenes.  This film isn't meant to be taken seriously, unless you're using it for inspiration to avenge your family who was murdered by a man named Betty.

Be prepared for a lot of weird dialogue, characters who make weird sounds, and blatant product placement.  I've watched this movie countless times over the last ten years and it has never failed to make me laugh.  This is a great movie for anyone who enjoys dumb comedy movies, though it is not for someone who is easily irritated by unrealistic films.

This film is great to watch with kids -- they find it hilarious.  However, I would advise any parent/adult to watch the film on their own before allowing children to watch it.  This way you can decide if it's alright for your children to watch rather than relying on others to make that decision for you.  There is no nudity and I don't recall any swearing, but there is a lot of violence (most of it is clearly fake).",1449360000,,1202,4.472477064220183

1447952,5,B00005JKXE,"Once in a great while, a truly original film comes out of the woodwork. Using footage from an obscure 1970's Hong Kong chop-socky film and some brilliant editing, it tells the story of a kung-fu prodigy known only as the ""Chosen One"" (Steve Oedekerk, who also directs) and his quest to avenge the death of his family at the hands of an evil warlord.

The film itself is uproarious, with goofy dialogue (done up to look like bad dubbing), and the best scenes, involving ""gopher-chucks"" and a duel with a CGI cow are worth the price of admission in of itself.",1431216000,,557,4.514851485148514

For anyone who does not know the setup (how film was made, not plot).  The film takes an older kung-fu film and digitally replaces the main character with Steve Oedekerk.  They also redub the voices and add there own dialogue which allows for some funny moments.  If the movie would have stuck closer to this formula then I think it would be even better than what it was.

We used to turn the TV sound off and ad-lib our own dialogue. ""Kung Pow"" is the result when a professional does this, along with inserting himself into the action on screen.

The commercials made it look like a terrible kung-fu comedy meant for children, we had never heard of anyone in it and it just didn't seem appealing. Then we went and saw it, all of us laughed so hard we were crying. We saw it probably 4 times in the theaters in total. The first time you see it you will not notice all of the little issues like where they used real modern actors to replace the old characters, but the dubbing and character creations are genius. I wish I could go back in time and relive watching this movie for the first time, I have never walked into something so unprepared and left so happy. If you like Mystery Science Theater 3000, Most Extreme Elimination Challenge or any other dubbing/spoofing shows, you will absolutely love this movie. I have seen it over 100 times and enjoyed it every single time. From, ""so cute!!

For those of you who haven't seen: This is a wildly imaginative spin on the Kung Fu genre that only Steve Oedekerk could have brought. Adding himself and a few people into the classic Tiger and Crane Fist this delightful Satire brings out the absolute ridiculousness of Mythical Kung Fu powers to a level that is only matched in Kung Fu Hustle. The purposefully bad dubbing will have you laughing out loud as a whole new set of one liners enters your vocabulary forever and even the now dated references still keep you laughing as they are introduced so blatantly and yet masterfully you can't help but laugh.

Some people call this movie childish, I call it a masterpiece of Satire and Slapstick comedy. I only wish I had the option to switch the audio from what they are dubbed as saying to what they are actually saying as that adds a whole new level of comedy that digital versions lack since there is no special feature menu.

A spoof in almost every sense of the word, but not in the way that The Naked Gun movies or the Airplane! movies are spoofs, nor in the way that Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein are spoofs. Those movies are silly and zany, but they have an underlying cleverness to them, a wit masked by lunacy, an intelligently unhinged charm. This movie isn't very witty, nor particularly clever, and really pretty devoid of intelligence. But it has zaniness, silliness, and charm in spades. I went into it thinking I would hate it. But after the first viewing, I was hooked. My brothers and I watched it frequently. We recited lines. The stupid one liners and affectionately over-forced character tics made their way into our daily conversations. Eventually we could nearly recite the film from memory. These days, I'm not home as much as I used to be. I only visit a few times a year. But it seems like we still make time to put this movie on, at least once a year, and we sit back and remember all the laughs we had. I still laugh til I cry every time I watch this movie. And sometimes I watch it at home and let myself be reminded of that wonderful time spent with my brothers, reciting lines to a movie few others saw, and saying stupid things that no one thought was funny but us.

Recently I tried getting my friends to watch this with me. Some of them shrug it off. ""Meh, it was ok. It had some funny parts."" Others don't seem to care much for it at all. A few of them like it almost the way my brothers and I like it, but not quite.

This is an unapologetic campy slapstick comedy stuffed with visual hilarity that is brainless yet executed with intentional flaws.

Basically Steve Oedekerk spliced up, redubbed and added some new footage to an old kung fu flick to create a fun little comedy that will get you chuckling.
Oedekerk stars as The Chosen One who sets out to avenge the murder of his family by the evil Master Pain, along the way he has to fight a cow, meets a one boobed mystic, and trains himself to fight in some unusual ways. Oh, and I forgot to mention that his tongue has a face?!
Again, if you are looking for high comedy, this ain't it. But if you want a fun little movie that will get you chuckling, then give ""Kung Pow"" a try.",1302134400,,688,4.180451127819549

1448736,3,B00005JKXE,"My kung fu favorites were always the classics, though I have always loved the cheesier ones -- the ones with the very bad dubbing, the ludicrous plots, and all the other cliches that came with the genre once it began to go downhill during the mid to late 1970s (with some obvious exceptions).  In particular, I've always loved the many many Wu Tang movies, many of which were completely insane but in a way that you grew to love.

""Kung Pow - Enter the Fist"" is an obvious spoof of the worst of the genre, using - funnily enough - a rather serious and rather good movie, ""Tiger and Crane Fists aka Savage Killers"" - for inspiration and lifting entire scenes from that movie.  The director, writer, and star obviously knows the genre quite well and pokes fun at many of the things you would ordinarily find funny anyway while watching a typical, lesser grade wuxia film.

If you know the genre, you might find this film quite clever.  Indeed, you will 'get' many of the jokes and genre nods.  However, I am not sure that the fact that you will 'get it' will make the film a winner for you.  It 'is' a clever film but it is hardly ever as funny as the real thing is.  Frankly, I would much rather watch one of the original films, badly dubbed, and laugh at that.  Which is, funnily enough, what I did once I got halfway through ""Kung Pow.""

Again, that isn't to say that the film is bad -- it is funny in a very silly way, but it is hardly a winner.  There are some giggle moments but no laugh-out-loud moments for me.  Most of the humor comes from the concept itself, which gets old about 10 - 15 minutes in.  Yes, the originals were badly dubbed, the camera often panned funnily on the faces of the protagonists, the sound effects were ludicrous at times -- we get it.  But after about 10 minutes, it isn't really funny anymore and you find yourself wanting to see the originals and laugh at the often unintentionally funny segments of those movies.  Or watch ""Drunken Master,"" which has many of these conventions but is legitimately funny within the concept of the movie (and the English version 'is' badly dubbed).

Could have been better.  As it is, a decent spoof.  If the wuxia classics ""The 36 Chambers of Shaolin"" or ""The One Armed Swordsman"" get 5 stars in my book, this one could never possibly get 5 or 4 stars.  And the originals, like any of the worst Wu Tang or fake Bruce Lee movies, would get a 3 or 2, then this one gets a 3.",1301011200,,2441,4.325274725274725

1448772,3,B00005JKXE,"I was THIS close to giving ""Kung Pow: Enter The Fist"" four stars.  The film received some genuine laughs from me, and I wasn't being ironic or facetious.  It knows it's ridiculous and embraced itself, for which I came to accept its kung-fu oddities.  The story of The Chosen One (Steve Oedekirk) wanting vengeance against the evil man named Betty was amusing enough, and the digital effects used to insert actors into an old movie was almost seamless.  Although it's easy to compare this movie to Woody Allen's ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"" (which also used the premise to splice an old Asian movie and include new scenes by an American actor/director), its humor and aimless direction reminded me of ""Sealab 2021"" as well as other pre-Adult Swim shows; maybe that's why I'm in good terms with ""Kung Pao"" since I like the early Adult Swim programs.  It had promise, but then it had stupidity.

Firstly, I would appreciated it if didn't start the movie off with a disclaimer saying it used the original Chinese wushu movie and how it was used make to include American content.  That's not necessary, the magic of the film is to not how it works, even if it's obvious.  Matter of thought, I don't like how self-aware or self-referential the movie tried to be.  The narrator got on my nerves whenever he commented on how outrageous or stupid a specific scene happened: ""Did you see that?  He punched a hole through the guy's chest, that's impossible""...yeah, I know that's impossible, it's not funny when you (narrator) say it; leave the comments to the audience.  These things only distract the film's uncertain nature.

The strength that lies within its chi is its effective uses with and around the original material.  How the film was dubbed was deliberately blatant, not exactly original, but it had a couple of good jokes, particularly one with the dog.  It does rely on obvious parodies and gags, but they work: stuff like the constant crazy zoom during the fight with the The Chosen One vs a band of warriors, fighters hitting Betty's crotch and he felt nothing, and the yokel love-interest yelling 'Chosen One' when he's running at the distance again and again; humor through repetition, I say.  It had some really clever moments, like escaping from a trap by simply reversing yourself, but the film's not clever enough.  I'm not saying it should be funny and smart; 'smart' isn't always synonymous with 'clever', and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/stupid-comedy-can-be-clever/dp/B000B5XOWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">stupid comedy can be clever</a>.

What holds the film back is the added content itself.  A few scenes were good like the entire baby sequence, but then it borderlines on the absurd.  THe fact that in one scene, The Chosen One was fighting against a kung-fu mastering cow (the allusion of Steve Oedekerk making ""Barnyard"" in the future was made clear). It's too goofy to be funny, moments like that stick out for their immature nonsense.  Half of the jokes in the dub script consists of people making silly noises; that was cute for a few times, but the ""wee-oo-wee-oo"" running gag eventually reached&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackovasaurus/dp/B0000CABL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackovasaurus</a>&nbsp;levels of irritation.  And then there's that guy playing pop songs with a boombox, which felt out of place.  Finally, the tongue...I was just creeped out with that thing than I was laughing at it.  All of these are funny for six-years-olds and I'm not exactly a child at heart.

The off-the-wall slapstick and lazy script lead ""Kung Pow"" into bad habits.  At the same time, it is nicely-made effort and it does have a creative edge.  I did enjoy this movie to some degree, and it's worth a look for those who want a little non-sequitor in their kung-fu spoof.",1277942400,,3880,5.177884615384615

This is a parody movie. Wait...do not run away just yet. Unlike the mass of crappy parody movies that are produced these days, this movie is actually very funny. If you are into the Japanese Martial Arts genre, you need to pick this one up. This movie is a parody of that specific genre. Luckily, you do not actually have to known anything about the movies it is spoofing to find this movie laugh-out-loud funny. Even if you hate martial arts movies, you will enjoy this one.

The movie starts in a small village. Master Pain and his group of thugs enter a home looking for a baby. The baby could affect their evil plans in the future if he is not stopped now. After the baby takes down most of the gang, Master Pain burns down the home in hopes to kill the child. Unfortunately, the baby narrowly barely escapes the flames. His family has been killed, so he is raised by the local wildlife.

The baby would become known as ""The Chosen One."" Chosen One will be forced to fight off Master Pain's henchmen for the rest of his life. However, after growing into an adult, he encounters Pain in a nearby village. Chosen One now seeks revenge on Pain, who will change his name to Betty. ""Isn't Betty a woman's name"" is the question running through your and Chosen One's mind. Betty is still a force to be reckoned with despite his feminine name.

This is not a intelligent comedy. Kung Pow expects you to lose about 20 IQ before viewing it. There is nothing wrong with a stupid (in a funny way) comedy every now and then. Some of the jokes are insanely humorous; other jokes are lukewarm stupid comedy. All of it mixes fairly well together. You will see references to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-King/dp/B00003CXB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion King</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;at certain points of the movie that will make you laugh. The other idiotic characters will have you laughing for a long time.

The only problem with this film is that the video quality is low sometimes. Kung Pow takes pieces from other Japanese movies that originally played in the 70s. I enjoy this idea, but some might get annoyed by it. The ending credits show how they achieved this in more detail.

I wish a sequel were made for this movie. There is plenty of reference to the making of a sequel in this film, but no sequel has been made to my knowledge. This movie has become a Cult Classic and the sequel would probably ruin this movie anyway.

Kung Pow, on the other hand, had us laughing just about from beginning to end.

The long and short of it, for people who don't know the schtick, is that the movie's creator basically found an old 1970's kung fu movie and either used green screen or reshot parts of the movie to put himself into the action. He also revoiced much of the dialogue to completely remake the movie into his own twisted vision of a kung fu spoof. The end result is occasional hilarity, occasional groans, a few slow moments but an overall great spoof.

1448862,5,B00005JKXE,"This may be funny for the regular fan of comedies but for kung fu fans, this hits a totally new level of funny. Personally, I don't think I would've enjoyed this movie nearly as much if I hadn't been watching kung-fu for so long. But not just kung-fu, bad kung-fu. I only own the good stuff but I've seen enough bad ones to get alot of the jokes going on in this movie. Basically, this movie almost killed me. I laughed so hard for so long, I almost couldn't breath. I hadn't seen anything so funny in a long time and it's been almost as long since.

Suprisingly though, I didn't see this in the movie theater. I remember the previews for it and thought it was just going to be stupid. I was dead wrong. I ended up renting it shortly after it came out on video and still didn't expect much. Not long into it, I was in tears. My girlfriend thought I had lost my mind as she had never seen me lose it like that. I agree as it's rare that anything can crack me up like this movie did. Coincidentally, the next movie on my list that has such an effect on me is 'Ace Ventura:When Nature Calls', which is also directed by Steve Oedekerk who stars in and directs 'Kung Pow'. Although Jim Carrey was fantastic in the last 'Ace', I think the teaming of the 2 made it comedy magic.

The funniest things about this film are that Oedekerk really knows and gets kung-fu films. He knows exactly what's funny about them. The things that all kung-fu movie watchers chuckle at when watching a particularly bad one. Even the better ones have some, what?, moments in them that can only be explained as bad writing or bad translation. Here, Oedekerk focuses on those and makes them the focus of almost all the characters dialog and personalities. I guess as most any spoof goes, you have to know the original material for it to hit on that deeper level and 'Kung Pow' is an absolute bullseye shot at kung-fu.

For me, one of the better aspects about Oedekerks' films is that they're basically clean. He doesn't indulge in cussing to make dialog funnier or gratuitous nudity for cheap thrills like today's comedies. No, he just sticks close to the source of silliness and doesn't get side tracked. Kung Pow never tries to be serious or anything other than an 81 min. joke. Because of that, this movie totally succeeds.

The audio and video aren't really worth mentioning here as it's not the type of movie that you'll care as long as it works and it does. The picture is clean, colorful and bright and the audio is clear and discernable on all levels. You'll be having so much fun, you'll forget to check anyways. Personally, I don't think I could watch it just to check the sources. Other than that, the graphics and edits are cheesy but perfect here for what it's doing. Even though it looks fake, the cow is hilarious!!! The dubbing over the old film footage is also crazy funny. It reminds me of an old show called 'Putting on the Hits', where actors would improv voice overs for old films. It used to crack me up and it works here too as the majority of the movie is an old kung-fu movie dubbed with new dialog.

I'm not sure how well this movie will do for people who don't watch kung-fu but I can positively guarantee that it'll have the fans in stitches. So for the casual fan of comedies, give it a rent. For the kung-fu fan, buy it now and watch it immediately. If you don't laugh, check your pulse cause your probably dead.",1201132800,,3413,4.360062893081761

The more into kung fu flicks, the funnier you'll think it is, as in this case familiarity breeds not contempt but laughter. I had to actually pause it several times I was laughing so hard. IMHO even every Stephen Chow flick pales in comparison to the humor factor inherit in this movie...Chow's flicks are meant to have humorous elements, but are not outright spoofs as this movie.

Dubbing himself into a 1976 Hong Kong film, Steve Oedekerk gives us one hilarious acid trip of a film complete with quirky dialog and hilarious special effects.  Spoofing everything that makes classic Kung Fu films so funny in the first place and adding a touch of modern cinema like a Matrix fighting cow, `Kung Pow! Enter the Fist' delivers laugh after laugh after laugh.  So little tonguey may be ridiculous, but renaming the villain Betty was a classic stroke of genius!",1165881600,4,654,4.564102564102564

In a day and age where a movie is considered a hit if it provides two or three laughs, this movie is so refreshing. ""Kung Pow"" had me laughing from the beginning, the baby roll, to the end, THE FRENCH!!!! I'm not sure if I've ever seen a comedy that had me holding my sides because they hurt from laughter, trying to catch my breath before the next ""bit"" (which was usually only a few seconds) and almost pissing in my pants. When I saw the movie the 1st time, the theater was almost empty, but you couldn't tell from my laughter. I really embarrassed my dad. I have very few comedies in my DVD collection. That is because most of them have diminishing value, with each viewing the movie is less funny. ""Kung Pow!"" is the exception to that rule. I've seen it several times and have laughed as much as I did when I 1st saw it. The reason I am writing this is because a few moments ago several scenes from the movie popped into my head, ""Call me Betty"" and ""I'm eeeevvvviiilll, so evil!"" and seeing Taco Bell in the village (maybe that's the prob with Taco Bell, they're still using the ingredients they had back then, LOL!). No other comedy has done that, pop up for no reason and get me laughing all over again. Now that I wrote my review, I'm going to buy the film. I wish Steve would do another film like this. One last thing, unlike other films, the outtakes were actually funny as well. Okay weee weee weee folks!",1165881600,3,1539,4.255972696245734

1448931,4,B00005JKXE,"The martial arts comedy ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist"" is like a film remix. Two Hong Kong films from the 1970s have been spliced together with new footage, so it now stars director Steve Oedekerk, who also dubs everyone in silly voices (including himself). It's an entertaining, silly film, and I know here in Australia it's already something of a quiet classic among the DVD rental crowd.

Steve Oedekerk plays the chosen one, a young man raised by rodents, who has a talking tongue named Tonguey and a dog named Dog, and a young man who seems to attract trouble. The biggest cause of the trouble is a Mr ""Betty"" Pain, a man whose iron claws, triangular studs and boombox tunes make him virtually invincible. To top it all off, he is a master magician, and can make his associates clothes change colours halfway during a scene. To defeat him, the Chosen One must reach the next level, so he trains and the local dojo. He trains hard, and is an impressive fighter, but will he be able to stop Betty?

Dubbing an old film with your own voice seems like such an obvious and funny concept I'm suprised it hasn't been done in a feature film like this before. Steve Oedekerk has a lot of fun playing with the dubs, camera angles, battle scenes and martial art film cliches. The new footage fits in really well. There is a bit of computer animation, but it is given the weathered treament along with the old footage, which is a really good look I think. It's a very, very quotable film. My favorite scene would probably have to be the intermission, where the characters recommend snacks for the viewers to eat from the lobby. ""I have Chosen the large tub"" says the Chosen One. ""My nipples look like Milk Duds"" says Wimp Lo. ""I hope they have Icies!"" the pretty Ling says. One of the martial arts masters makes a comment about yellow popcorn, but I won't repeat that here. That reminds me, the film does get a little crude at times, and a little bloody (in a silly way), but it's not too bad.

The ""Chosen"" Edition is the one to get, as it includes features (like the audio modes) which are just as funny as the film, and give you an idea of how the film(s) was mixed together.

I'd recommend this film to people who like to laugh at bad films (though this is a good film). It plays errors and such for laughs, and is goofy enough to be watched again and again.",1162425600,2,2351,4.385321100917431

1448933,5,B00005JKXE,"Steve Oedekerk (the writer of the film BRUCE ALMIGHTY) directed, wrote and starred in this quite silly kung fu spoof. Though one hesitates to call it groundbreaking, KUNG POW is genuinely remarkable, in that much of it is composed of scenes from a 1977 Chinese film with modern actors smoothly and digitally inserted into them. Watch the credits at the end for examples of what I'm talking about.

Because of this creative juxtaposition, KUNG POW manages to create a comedic atmosphere that is uniquely its own. It really does ""feel"" like a vintage martial arts film, yet the dialogue is so extraordinarily silly and the timing is so odd, it just wrings laughs out of you.

SIDELIGHT: The entire movie is dubbed, and Oedekerk also did all the voices for every character (except Whoa.) To further the bad dubbing effect, Oedekerk wrote a fake script of gibberish for the modern actors to repeat on-camera.",1148860800,7,904,4.863636363636363

This movie is for those who loved Hot Shots and Naked Gun or Shaolin Soccer and KungFu Hussle! It's for those who like when the protagonist is serious about what he's doing, but the things going around him are just wrong and funny!

Kung Pow: Enter the Fist is done by editting an old Chinese movie. Steve Oedekerk (both director and main character) has put himself into the movie by using green screen technique. He replaced himself with someone from the old Chinese movie and dubbed the whole movie!!

Eventhough the scene might be serious, the characters speak so high pitched or squeling-like that you just start laughing!

It's not uproariously funny.  There are many gags that just lay there and die.  But then, there are the brilliant bits, little pieces of comedy gold.  Though it's tempting to be harsh on this film, I have to admit every time I watch it I laugh.  And isn't that its purpose?  And in that respect, it succeeds admirably, because I still laugh and I still look forward to watching it.

Basically the story is ""the chosen one"" (played by Steve Oedekerk) bears the mark of infinite wisdom which in his case is a talking tongue. Because of this profound mark he is pursued by many challenges and opponents. However the main target through them all is a killer named Master Pain (Or self named Betty) who murdered the chosen one's parents with a sharp set of iron claws when he was a baby.

Now the chosen one over his journey of walking, sometimes driving, and occasionally partying with the desert creatures has to learn how to best beat Betty and his strange Evil Counsel who happened to be aliens in silver triangular spaceships.

The dialouge is extremely funny and will keep you laughing from start to finish. The kung fu is choppy and matrix style sometimes especially in the Moon yu fight scene (The kung fu cow) and the words are often so random you don't know where they came from or where they fit in.

Just when you think the movie's overstayed it's welcome, Oedekerk pulls out another hilarious moment and you find yourself both impressed and entertained by his silliness.  With none of the dialogue in synch with the character's mouths, it's just proof at how campy and bad these earlier Japanese movies were.  Most hilarious are some of the noises that the characters make, especially Ling, the heroine.  A sequel is coming out next year and I'm sure it'll be just as insanely hilarious.

You say that the movie is bad because of the acting, well guess what, its supposed to be! Now, I do think that martial arts movies and comedy do not mix well together, which is probably why the movie ended up with such bad results, but somehow, the plot is so stupid and simple, that it makes it incredibly funny. The stupid one-star reviewers are obviously incredibly high because I guess they thought that this was supposed to be a real martial arts movie, when actually, that was just the premise. The producer chose a crappy martial arts movie, added a couple of characters and extra scenes, and turned it into a comic masterpiece. There is even a dumb f*ck on here who said and I quote, ""punching a hole through a person is incredibly unrealistic. I know it's a movie, but it overdoes it"" or something like that. Please, how many movies have been unrealistic? Just about every horror movie, alien movies, movies like the sixth sense, and pretty much any action/adventure movie. Face it, movies are practically made to be unrealistic, unless they are movies based on a true story. So to say that kung pows fighting scenes are too unrealistic is like saying that the dawn of the dead is a true story. Now aside from all the douchebag, retarded one-star reviewers, this movie has got to be one of the funniest movies ever. I have watched a lot of comedies (probably because comedy is my favorite genre of movie), and the only movie that has been funnier than this one is South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, and Team America: World Police. Now let me prewarn any people reading this review, this is not a martial arts movie, so don't expect to see much of anything in this movie that you would see in a real martial arts movie.

Kung Pow also works well for evaluating dates--10 bucks spent on this can save you hundreds, maybe tens of thousands, later.

This movie is incredibly silly and marvelously stupid which means the comedy is wonderfully whimsical and wackily unpredictable (Gesundheit!). A lot of it is nonlinear (there are no straight lines anywhere in the film) and that's a turnoff for those who like their ""Scary Movie"" pie fights, and a delight for others, like me, who watch the ""Scary Movie"" films from the safety of the bathroom. I recommend Kung Pow for really really smart people who need to relax with something goofy that has no point to make about the real world other than the real world is often goofy and irrational. A very fun movie and one of my favorites. Someday a big statue of Steve Oedekerk...somewhere.

And this movie is probably the stupidest of them all.  This, of course, is what makes it insanely funny.  However, it seems as though everyone here either loves it or hates it.  The people who love it take it for what it is, a hilariously stupid martial arts parody, and the people who hate it try to take it too seriously.  I had my friend watch it, and for the first twenty minutes he had a ""what the hell is giong on?"" look on his face, but then he let let go and enjoyed it.  You really just have to take it as it comes to you and let yourself laugh at its blatant stupidity.

This movie was made with the actual footage of a 70's martial arts film from Hong Kong, dubbed with the dumbest, funniest script ever (even the dog is dubbed), and with writer Steve Oedekerk edited into the picture.  At this point, hilarity insues, and lasts from beginning to end, including everything from using a lighter to light the torch to catch the house on fire to our hero Chosen One being caputered and subdued by a tiny net (hence the title of my review).

And you must remember that this is not a martial arts movie, but a spoof of one.  It also makes spoofs on other movies ranging from The Lion King (Mu-shu-fasa) to The Matrix (slow-motion milk dodging scene when fighting a cow).  Also, there is a significant Holy Grail vibe to this movie with the redundant but funny scenes.  So if you are a fan of Monty Python, then you will really appreciate the humor in this movie.

It's not even as sassy as ""Airplane!"" or ""Spaceballs.""  But it is funny in a sophomoric kind of way.  Director Steve Oedekerk seems himself into an old 1970s kung fu movie.

The result of all this madness is Kung Pow, a no-budget film with a few slow spots but many moments of priceless hilarity.

All but one character's voice dubbing work is Steve. Steve did the editing, re-shoots, writing, and plays the lead character ""Chosen One."" He hunted countless scratchy old Hong Kong movies to deconstruct, eventually buying and restoring ""Tiger & Crane Fists"" for this movie.

So Kung Pow is really a labour of (deranged) love, and a genuinely entertaining experience at a time when 100m budget films can be so overly slick and competent they leave zero impression.

An inspiration for our affordable-tech generation. Get the DVD for a few precious out-takes, like the Evil Betty ""so sparkly"" scene, and Chosen One hiding in the giant bell.",1100736000,3,940,4.8930817610062896

While some of the gags get annoying, especially some of the more over the top voices, I laughed harder during this movie then during dozens of other, better known comedies.

I have no idea why critics hate this movie so much, don't listen to them. It is one of the funniest movies in recent years whether those uptight cinema snobs admit it or not. It's tempting to list every hillarious moment in this film, but you really should see it yourself. I know it looks stupid, but just trust me. You WILL laugh, and laugh often. It's not the perfect comedy, but it's pretty damn close! It breathes new life into a genre that's currently overflowing with clones of the ""different people switch places"" and ""white guy meets black cop"" plots.

Steve Oedekerk has concocted some of the most idiotic stuff ever to be filmed (Ace Ventura, the Thumb series, Jimmy Neutron) but this reigns over all those things. Kung Pow is cross between Modern footage of Oedekerk and a select few othe ""actors"", and footage from an old Chinese kung-fu movie called ""Tiger and Crane fists"", blended in with each other. Oedekerk has muted the dialogue spoken by the Chinese actors of the original movie and dubbed in his own voice, or maybe I should voices, (he plays several ridiculous characters.
As far as the plot goes basically an evil Chinese uh.. guy named Master Pain (later he calls himself Betty) has killed an entire Japanese family looking for a member of it called the Chosen One, who is the infant of the family. After a stupid and not-so-funny sequence of the baby kicking his ass they flee, and the baby winds up on his own. He travels and grows up and fights people on the way, all in search of the man who killed his family. He goes to a weird old man named Master Tang to train him and help him find Master Pain. He finds him, there are many pointless scenes following- inclding one spoofing the Lion King, and then a big battle between the Chosen One and Betty. Using his sacred gift (a tongue with a face on it) the Chosen One defeats Betty and that is the end of that.

Good lord, what an awful movie this is. I expected it to be bad, but I wasn't expecting ninety minutes of Kung Faux with the addition of actors and scenes.

If you've never seen Fuse's show Kung Faux (or this movie), the basic idea is this: take old martial arts movies. Add in your own dialogue. Hilarity ensues. Well, okay, in very small doses. A full episode of Kung Faux is usually too much. Ninety minutes... ugh.

It did, however, make me want to see the original film used (Tiger and Crane Fist), simply to find out if the original is as bad as Kung Pow.

His family killed as a child, the ""Chosen One"" (Steve Oedekerk) wanders in search of enlightenment and revenge against his nemesis, the evil Master Pain (who inexplicably changes his name to ""Betty"" early on).
The movie usues some clever digital manipulation to insert Oedekerk into a 1970s martial arts film; the dialogue track of which is replaced with amusing commentary and ridiculous dialogue -- a sort of ""Bruce Lee meets Mystery Science Theater 3000"".
Original footage, including a remarkable and absurd fight between the Chosen One and a cow (""milk shooting out of an udder in Matrix-like ""bullet time"" slow mo), and a confrontation with the aliens from the Evil Council (Evil Betty's masters) is mixed in in not-so-seamless fashion in order to heighten the story's absurdity.

1449442,3,B00005JKXE,"I'll start by saying that if you take your martial arts B-movies seriously or have highbrow expectations for your comedy, your annoying pretentiousness alone will seal Kung Pow's fate for you. For the rest of us laypeople who can enjoy a good spoof at face value, Kung Pow is a highly entertaining movie that is more appreciable as you think of the processes that went behind it.
Using both new footage and clips taken from a 1970s martial arts movie called ""Tiger and Crane Fists,"" Kung Pow: Enter the Fist is re-edited to tell the story of the Chosen One (Steve Oedekerk, who also wrote, directed, and basically was in charge of everything related to this movie), who grows up to become a great kung fu master whose greatest challenge is defeating the mighty Master Pain, who sends out mixed messages by demanding to be called Betty by his boot-licking disciples. Throughout the movie, Oedekerk's face - through the magic of some occasionally off-the-mark computer integration - constantly replaces the old protagonist's mug in his epic struggle to avenge the death of his parents by destroying Master Betty once and for all.
This is by no means Oscar-caliber fare, but the movie scores laughs by perfectly recreating the bad dubbing, poor lighting, and unintentionally humorous dialogue that make these types of obsolete flicks good old-fashioned cheesy fun. It is true, though, that the Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that everything is good in moderation, so Kung Pow gets brought down a few stars for its penchant for driving the worst of its jokes into the ground while only using the good ones sparingly and for copping out with a lazy and incredibly ludicrous ending.
However, the average score does not mean that you should avoid it; in fact, it comes with my highest recommendations for anyone with a loose sense of humor. If your late-night movie stash consists of more than a few old karate flicks, you should be able to appreciate the thought that went into the parody that is Kung Pow. If a cow that shoots milk torpedoes out of its utters and nunchukas made of gophers don't deter you, then nothing will stop you from liking this movie.",1057276800,2,2156,4.8297297297297295

1449447,5,B00005JKXE,"With the conception of Kung Pow: Enter The Fist, the culture of film has been raised to a new brand of sophistication.
This work goes beyond parody, inanity, and sheer dumbness, and bends uncannily into unqeustionable profundity.
Jorge Luis Borges, in his essay On Dubbing, anticipated and therefore practically demanded that Steve Oedekerk step forward and encapsulate the obvious incongruity of watching someone speak with a foreign unseen voice. Borges also, it should be noted, citing Kafka and his precursors, asserted that writers create their own precursors. Thus Oedekerk, nominally inspired by the eternally bad dub, reinvents 1977's Tiger and Crane Fist into the very original Kung Pow. So much so that Kunf Pow's originality defies time and makes plagiarists of movies that came chronologically before it. Think of Matrix, Matrix 2 (I live under constant attack!; or: There will be a Chosen One; or Mu Shu Fa's vague movie-magic opacity)
This seemingly goofy undertaking by UberGenius Steve Oedekerk has accidentally contained all of film history.
Kung Pow is the sum and the part.
All one needs as evidence is the unbearably hot curlicue's on Ling's wee-o-wee-o face, or just as well, the moth and the coughing master, or Wimp Lo's inverted bravery, and of course all of villainey is triangulated in the concetrated evil of Master Pain, also know, of course, as Betty.",1054857600,2,1380,5.165178571428571
1449448,5,B00005JKXE,"Is there anyone who just, sort-of liked this film or just sort of didn't like this film? It appears not! I'm not sure what the detractors were expecting from a guy that makes ""Thumb"" movies. If you went into a theatre, rented the video or (gasp!!) bought the movie with any expectations... SHAME ON YOU!! Here's how I ""stumbled"" into ""The Fist"" and imediatley laughed my (expletive) off!!
I was looking for ""Big Trouble in Little China"" on DVD when I found it packaged in a 2-pack with ""Kung Pow; Enter the Fist"". The 2-pack was $$ more than BTiLC all by itself. I actually hesitated. I thought ""do I really want to spend 2 bucks extra for a film I hadn't even concidered buying?"" I decided to take the plunge. To this day it is still my crowning achievement in DVD purchasing savvy. This said, my expectations for this film were ZERO!
The first time I watch ""Kung Pow"" I was eating lunch (turkey on Italien with mustard and a pickle). I giggled, pretty much non-stop, through the first 20 minutes. Then, I just smiled amusingly for about 20 minutes. Then I laughed so hard I nearly choked on my sandwich (seriously). Dispite this trauma, I continued to laugh myself to tears. The cause of this disgusting display was an out-of-the-blue moment were Ling(?), the female lead with the voice of Miss Piggy, inexplicably ""quacked"" like a duck with strep throat. Now, the whole film is not funny. Some scenes just try too hard. But, overall, I enjoyed myself enough that in retrospect, I would certainly have paid regular price for it.
So why the discrepancies in reviews? Why the ""all or nothing""?
I still have not figured it out. I loaned my DVD to a co-worker, insisting it is the funniest thing I've seen in recent memory. He said it was ""sophmoric"" and painfull to watch. I responded ""OF COURSE IT'S SOPHMORIC!! WHAT DID YOU EXPECT!?"" This from a person who is a Monty Python geek!? Now, I love the ""Holy Grail"" but I did not, EVER, laugh hard at that film. Holy Grail elicited chuckles but never good, from the gut, belly laughs as Kung pow did. Now don't think I'm comparing the 2 as films, I'm comparing their ability to make me laugh (which admittedly is not difficult).
Is this a stupid movie? Of course!
Is this a great film? Of course not!!
Is there a story, great acting, breathless imagery... ...a point? OF COURSE NOT!!!
If you expect any of those things, bow out now.

All the obligatory jokes are made regarding mismatched dubbing of voices, including a dog whose bark you hear 2 seconds after his mouth moves.  The virginal heroine is made provocative and kooky, thanks to some hilarious editing trickery.  And, of course, what movie of the early millenium would be complete without a ""Matrix"" spoof/homage?

I really should have avoided it after I read all the scathing reviews. Why did I watch it? I think it was because it's a redubbed, digitally altered version of some old chop socky movie, featuring Oedekerk digitally inserted into the plot and a bizarre new soundtrack. Here's the problem: Woody Allen already redubbed a weird Asian movie thirty five years ago with ""What's Up Tiger Lilly,"" and frankly my dear, Steve Oedekerk is no Woody Allen.
The 2.35:1 DVD looks pretty good, and the scenes that were lifted from the old kung-fu film look better than I'd expected. There are also a bunch of extras, for those who actually care. There are two more alternate soundtracks, which are as terrible unfunny as the real one. There are a few documentaries, in which Oedekerk self-worships himself, praising his own work for being ""original"" (maybe he's never seen ""Tiger Lilly"" or ""MST3K""). There are also some deleted scenes, which are worse than what was left in the film.

The creators made an awfully silly film and thats the point.  Some minor interations between characters had me laughing so hard I woke up my roomates.  It's just so dumb that you have to laugh.  I thought the special effects and the insertions into the old film were excellently done.  In fact I was so shocked at how well done the effects were since the rest of the movie was so purposely done poorly.  It was a neat context as they are making fun of movies that traditionally had awfull effects and acting by re-dubbing a film with awful acting yet great special effects.

1449598,5,B00005JKXE,"There's a very definite crowd that will hate this movie, this rant isn't for them. Kung Pow! will most likely be loved by any loyal fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It's also great for fans of Monty Python, Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura, etc. Basically, it's stupid comedy. I'm talking, /really/ stupid comedy. That's why it's so funny, and some people just won't get this.
So, what's Kung Pow! all about? Well, Writer/Director/Lead Actor Steve Oedekerk basically takes an old, unknown, laughably bad 70's kung fu movie and one ups MST3K by not only making fun of it, but throwing out the dialogue and sound. They redubbed the entire thing. They digitally added several characters, including the main character, into the film. Everything is then mercilessly hacked and ducted taped together to form one hilarious story.
The jokes are certainly hit and miss, but that's to be expected in this type of film. More or less, it's a great comedy with a lot of action. The story, although very fragmented, is rather entertaining as well. It does manage to keep a sense of continuality though all the random fun. The end of the film, although unusual, will be well known to any anime fan. Suffice to say it's almost like watching Kung Pow! 2 in 30 seconds. It's very entertaining.
So what else do you need to know? Go rent it! Keep an eye out for WimpLo, a great MST3K style humiliated character. ""We purposely trained him /wrong/, as a joke!"" The cow scene isn't nearly as lame as it seems in the previews. The cow itself is actually quite well modeled, and animates smoothly. It's somewhere around 5x-10x the detail of the Black & White cow, if that helps anyone. Have fun, and keep the scoffing movie critics out of the room while watching. Threaten them using various WimpLo quotes, that'll keep them away for awhile.

I did however give this turkey 2 stars. Why is that
This is perhaps the most original concept for a film in the last few years. While the market is saturated with formulaic junk that is guaranteed to make good at the box office, Steve Oedekerk, like Tom Green (FREDDY GOT FINGERED), risked having a bomb on his hands when he released this film. If you're not a fan of 70's Hong Kong chop-socky, and nobody explained this films concept to you, you would think it was just a bad bad attempt at spoofing a genre.
But this is both a spoof and a sincere homage to the chop-socky of days past, before Jackie Chan killed off the Hong Kong chop-socky scene forever when he migrated to Hollywood and started making action-comedies with Chris Tucker and Owen Wilson.
Now the problem here is with the comedy element. Quite simply, few of the jokes here are remotely funny unless you're 12 years old. Perhaps that was the intended demographic and perhaps it wasn't. Either way, if you are reasonably intelligent and old enough to see this film without your parents, you'll probably find yourself groaning, rather than laughing at the jokes.
.... Now if you've gone and spent your money on something, you want to convince yourself that it was worth it. I know what that's like. So you go and give this the best possible rating and think of something, anything good to say about the film.

Almost every single word a person says in this movie is something [funny], from the Animal Song to the ""LOOK! A WHALE!"", you will [laugh and laugh]even more with friends.
Anyway, take my advice and SEE THIS MOVIE. It is hilarious. ...",1042934400,,803,4.4324324324324325

I'm a fairly big fan of general Kung-fu type movies, so was looking forward to seeing this one.  It's kind of a mixed bag.  The best way to describe it is its similar to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode but with new footage instead of just offbeat comments.
There are several laugh out loud moments in it, especially at the beginning of the movie.  But after watching half the movie, the jokes get kind of stale and repetitive and it gets less and less interesting.  The last 20 minutes were just bad and there wasn't really anything funny at all going on in them.
Overall I'm giving it 2 stars.  It had good potential, but it just ran out of steam halfway through and made it a chore to actually finish it.  It did have some great individual lines/parts though, especially during the first half.  It's also incredibly short, just 81 minutes - which is good, because it would have been hard to really sit through anymore.",1042243200,,1020,4.475675675675675

It's like they painstakingly went through the film frame by frame and removed anything remotely humorous. At the end of my life, when the Grim Reaper comes to take me, I fully expect to ask for and get this hour and fifteen minutes of my life back.",1041724800,5,423,4.3

The begining did not grip me and I was still convinced that it was going to be horrible, but when I realized that it was a spin-off of a Kung Fu movie with added scenes, it all ""made sense"" and it was hilarious. I had to press pause so that I could stop laughing and continue on.
You definitely have to have a certain sense of humor to find this movie funny and highly entertaining so if you have a sense of humor on a self-made high chair, then don't watch this movie, because you just won't get it.

The jokes are VERY silly, predictable, and I don't think they worked very hard on them. The only reason I saw this movie is because my friend kept quoting from it and telling me I should watch it. So we did. It's a good idea to edit the actors into old footage of kung-foo movies, but the parts that they made themselves (i.e. when he fights with the cow...) are very dumb. Obviously the people that made this have brains that work like this:
FALLING DOWN + STUPID FACE = FUNNY. I don't agree with that logic. I mean, just look at the cover of this! Gopher-chucks? Why? I just don't get it! Really, don't waste your time on this movie unless you like really goofy and predictable things.",1039910400,,809,4.364238410596027

Nevertheless, I found myself enjoying it. I think that the reason I did was because I have seen many fighting flicks in the past, and seing a movie that made fun of them was very novel.  After all, this comedy makes fun of practically every single stereotypical feature of an average kung fu movie.  If you were or still are a fan of kung fu movies you might find Kung Pow rather entertaining. If you are not, then be aware of possible disappointment.",1038873600,,607,4.45045045045045

This movie is a low budget film; it was meant to be a spoof; and shouldn't be taken seriously. Some people will say that their level of intelligence is above that of Oedekerks and Kung Pow is a disgrace for what theatres allow now. What is with these people? They adhere to some belief that if they would be embarassed to show the movie to their mother then it is bad and should ruin everyone else's fun by saying it's not funny; when really they aren't able to enjoy the movie for what it is because of these standards. I think Oedekerk was hilarious in the movie and the writing [or what sounded almost as improv] was top-notch; however, by the film's end I was tired of the dubbing and the purposely delayed reaction between Oedekerk and what he is saying.
We all like to make fun of Jackie Chan movies or whatever, but basing a movie on spoofing another type of movie? It's hilarious for the first part of the movie, then it just gets redundant. I especially got tired of Oedekerk's voice and the shotty job at acting, if that's what they call it.

1449657,5,B00005JKXE,"Okay, so you've seen the commercials, the trailers, the magazine ads, and I'll agree that they did the movie no justice. Sometimes you have to swallow your pride and take the risk of watching a movie that could be potentially bad or potentially great. This movie will entertain a certain audience; an audience that can sit back and say, ""This is a low-budget movie with a crazy man at the helm. I am ready for anything."" If you don't like spending money on a movie that might make you say, ""That was ridiculous! Why would anyone say/do/suggest that kind of thing in this situation??"" then don't spend your money on this movie, because you will not truly appreciate this hour and a half of raw and senseless slapstick comedy.
  Steve Oedekerk plays a martial arts prodigy aptly dubbed The Chosen One who is stuck in the typical 70's Hong Kong Action Flick storyline: An evil kung-fu master(body doubled by Leo Lee) named Master Pain...I mean...Betty, has killed the Chosen One's family, and he must avenge their deaths. The Chosen One, who wailed on everybody anyway, travels the East and trains in his unorthodox fighting style to locate and prepare himself for the Evil Betty. On his way he is assissted by many wacky and ludicrous counterparts, which range from his dog who is constantly disappearing form wide angle shots, and the one-boobed superwoman, Whoa(Jennifer Tung). The movie's visual quality and low-budget are stunning to say the least. The movie took eight days to shoot, and some scenes were shot in parking lots, beaches, and even Oedekerk's backyard! This short filming time is due to the fact that more than 3/4 of the movie is old footage from a 70's martial arts sleeper. Oedekerk digitally replaced the main character with himself in scenes where the Chosen One was needed and often just replaced the original character's head with his own. This technique was also topped off with beautifully accurate stage designs that were almost identical replicates from the movie it spoofs. All dialogue, except for Jennifer Tung's, is dubbed by Oedekerk in the most wacky way possible. Most lines were improvised and make for an almost impossible storyline, however this is NOT a movie rich in story!
  Rent this movie when you just want a night of hilarity with no strings attached. Keep your standards for the comedy high, and your standards for the story extremely low, and let the impossibility of this movie entertain you. You will either like this movie, or you won't. There's really no grey area. Keep in mind that this movie is no blockbuster, but it is one of my personal top three favorite movies. You can't get much more original than this! Although the movie is actually a spin-off from the original kung-fu flick it spoofs, it's done at a perspective never thought of before. If you like this movie, check out some other Oedekerk movies and featurettes such as the Thumbation series(Thumb Wars: The Phantom Cuticle, The Blair Thumb, Frankenthumb, Bat Thumb, Thumbtanic, The Godthumb) or some of his previous works like the two Nutty Professor movies with Eddie Murphey and Ace Ventura 2: When Nature Calls.",1036195200,11,3131,4.8686679174484055

1449713,1,B00005JKXE,"Oedekerk, the brains behind this film, connected with Jim Carrey to script the second Ace Ventura flick. That is the brief shining moment in a career otherwise devoted to movies in which the only actors are giant close-ups of thumbs with miniature human mouths grafted on them through crude digital effects. The humor and the ambience of these films is childish, but they are not aimed at kids. (Oedekerk has a potty mind and frequently goes where he shouldn't go with the general audience.)
Maybe that is all I need to say about Kung Pow. But indulge me for a minute. There is a joke here about a man named Nurse Betty Pain who is left in charge of a sick man with a chest wound. The nurse/guy gets way too friendly with the man and way too interested in the wound, and in the next scene, we learn the man took an inexplicable turn for the worse and died (inexplicable, except to the audience --nudge nudge, wink wink, haw haw). The implication here, I leave to you. But this is typical Oedekerk. The coarsest humor in the most questionable of taste. And, for those who care about such things, no finesse or style to anything that happens. Oedekerk is a thoroughly accomplished Mr. Amateur Night. (The only thing worse than Oedekerk here, might, MIGHT be any one of the millions of wannabe funnymen launched at a target far past their grasp by Bill Murray's lounge singer from the first season of SNL.)

1449716,1,B00005JKXE,"Whatever  Steve Oedekerk was paid to make this film, I would gladly give up my inheritance to ensure he never makes another film again.  Though other viewers may laud KUNG POW:  ENTER THE FIST, I challenge them to find copies of Steve Martin's DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID, or Woody Allen's WHAT'S UP, TIGER LILY where the effect of intersplicing modern actors with older film are done with better aplomb.  Certainly, Allen's WHAT'S UP. . .does a far better job at dubbing over an older movie and with a more hilarious effect.  That said, at the very least, I wish I could recommend this film to potsmoking, white fratboys on a lazy Sunday afternoon, but I can't even do that.  They'd be better served watching the senior PGA tour than painfully suffering through Steve Oedekerk's KUNG POW: ENTER THE FIST.  Better yet, one would be better served willfully eating a bowl of Drano than watching this film.
All barbs aside,  this film fell flat on several points.  The film, I think, was supposed to be a spoof.  A spoof only works if the audience watching it knows the origin of reference, i.e. 70's kungfu films.  Now, seeing as how the majority of the public isn't very savvy on these films, it's plain to see where Oedekerk alienates a good amount of his audience.
Two, Oedekerk is really playing into some serious negative stereotypes here.  I'm so tired of watching asians put in the same categories time after time after time.  Yeah, it's a Chinese kungfu film.  That's a given.  But I cringed when he introduced the character of Wimpy-Lo which furthered asian male stereotypes as ineffectual and effeminate by dubbing in this lisping, high pitched squeek of a voice for the characters'. My favorite, of course, was the one-breasted kungfu sex kitten-I feel for that asian American actress who had to don clothing that would make Britney Spears blush.  It supported the stereotype that asian women are sexual playtoys.  I sincerely hope that actress works again. Thanks for perpetuating that one, Steve, a greatful asian-american nation thanks you.  Not really.
Three, the joke is done after the first ten minutes of the film.  Many of you who've seen this film refer to MST3K.  Fine, that's valid.  I'd just like to say that MST3K had commercial breaks.  Or at the very least, I could take my clicker and switch over to something more interesting, like say-Public Access Television.  The entire movie  is a lame joke at best.

They show some of the worst parts of the movie. Despite being a very stupid movie, it's also one of the most creative, original, and just plain funny movies ever made.
Half this movie is not original, but is taken directly from an old 1970s Hong Kong Film. What better way to spoof an old martial arts films then to actually use the film itself. Using modern technology, the main character, the Chosen One, is inserted into the old film, replacing the original main star. Then the whole movie is dubbed. Let me just say that those voices are the most hilarious voices ever. For anyone who has watched old Kung Fu films and made fun of them (especially the dubbing), or any fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, this movie is great.
The characters are enjoyable, especially the dreaded enemy, Master Tang, or as he likes to be called, Betty, or Wimp Lo, a young fighter who was trained wrong as a joke.
The DVD extras are great. The cut scenes are funny, but the alternative audio tracks are hilarious. The commentary gives a glimpse of the comic genius that created this film. There is also the Book on Tape track, where only one British guy, in the an extremely proper accent, dubs the whole movie itself. Finally, there is the what they were really saying track, where the actors, in order to preserve the bad dubbing quality of the 70s films speak entirely different lines than what is actually dubbed.

If you thought that CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON was a cinematic gem, then you might find tinkering with martial arts films like this to be a sacrilege. But if you thought CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON was overrated, then you just might think it could stand some of the same treatment that created this present spoof. Those who like farce should find a lot of laughs in KUNG POW! ENTER THE FIST. For those of us who find martial arts films to be a hit-and-miss proposition, a spoof like this can be a refreshing diversion. It had me thinking what other films I might like to see twisted this way, not necessarily with total disrespect for the originals. I thought of Jackie Chan movies, for example. I really sort of like Jackie, but surely I'm not alone in finding that plot lucidity is sometimes not the strong suit in his movies. So it got me to wondering if any of his might be given this sort of treatment and maybe even produce sometimes a movie more coherent than the original. But for that matter, why limit it to the martial arts genre? It's equally intriguing to wonder what this kind of re-dubbing might do with THE VIRGIN SUICIDES or VANILLA SKY or INSOMNIA. Maybe even WHAT DREAMS MAY COME or MEET JOE BLACK? Well, that might be asking too much.",1029715200,12,1512,4.521897810218978

I agree with the spotlight review that the best jokes were in the trailer.  Yes, the digital work is quite well done, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the dialogue sounds like it was done by a class clown from the 3rd grade.  Oedekerk had a great idea - he just should've had someone else write the screenplay.

A Chinese woman tells him that he's the ""chosen one,"" but he was so absorbed into her chest tat he didn't hear her.  How many times has that been used?

I didn't know the movie was a partial rehash of a 1970s kung fu flick, so I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out which parts were from the original movie, and which parts had been put in. After that the gags and the movie itself got old.
I like parodies of movies, but this movie used the same gags over and over. The lips not matching up was funny for the first 10 minutes, but when they go so far as to make the dog bark follow 10 or 15 seconds after he makes the barking motion, it's no longer funny. Master Pain renaming himself Betty just doesn't make sense. Maybe if he'd worn nylons or lipstick, or did something even remotely feminine it would have tied in. The guy with the stereo dancing to Sir Mix A Lot and other songs didn't make any sense either, I'd never seen anyone even remotely like it in a kung fu movie, so it didn't fit into the parody.
I have to give the movie 2 stars though, the first is for the cow. The CG cow was really well done; it didn't look dodgy or mechanical or really fake. The milk shooting out of its udder was a bit much, but the CG work on the cow was really well done.
The second star is for the splicing of Oedekerk into the original movie. The blue screen work was well done, he's put into the scenes well enough that you can't automatically tell which scenes were from the original film and which were filmed for this film.

1449825,5,B00005JKXE,"The idea is that Steve Oedekerk got a hold of a long-forgotten 1976 martial-arts film and shot some new scenes, and digitally inserted himself into the action .
If you know Steve Oedekerk at all it would be from his writing and directing skills as he wrote the screen play for The Nutty Professor II and wore both the writing and directing hats for Ace Ventura:When Nature Calls. He's also made a name for himself as a producer being involved with both Patch Adams and Jimmy Neutron:Boy Genius of all things. What does all this tell you about Steve? Well, other than the fact that he really likes movies with colons in the title, it lets you know that he knows a thing or two about comedies and isn't some no-name person who managed to get a movie made.
The premise of the movie is pretty straight forward martial arts stuff. Once every 1000 years a ""Chosen One"" is born who will defeat evil, you'll be able to tell he's the Chosen One because he bears a particular mark. In this case, the mark is a little working face on his tongue, and evil is a Master who has decided he wants to be called ""Betty

Check out Kung Pow and find out. It has a place of honor in my collection, between Austin Powers and the gorgonzola.
The DVD itself is even more of a treat. There are two `alternate soundtracks' that cover several scenes, one of what they're really saying before it was dubbed, and one of a cultivated British voice actor reading the dialog in a books-on-tape style that is just hysterical, especially when he reads the love interest's ""we-oo-we-oo-we-oo's."" There are also several before-and-after scenes with the original characters from Savage Killers, and then with Steve Oedekerk, that help you appreciate how well done the blue screen work was in the movie.

I rented the  video from Blockbuster and my kids  said  they would  tell me  when to come  watch the  funny part- after a  few  seconds, they said--'' Here  somes the  funny part''-- It  was  actually funny. Before I could get  up they said- 'Wait Dad- here's another  funny part''  and  it  was.  Every time I tried to get up, they told  me to wait and the 'funny part'  came a few  seconds  later. After  15  minutes, I was  hooked and  laughed my way  through the whole thing--a  few times uncontrollably !!
Then I  got on Amazon.com and  bought  the  CD.  It  reminds  me  of a  good  Mystery Science  Theatre 2000  parody  with  wierdly wachy dubbed  voiceovers  like Crow and Bot used to do on MST 3K.
My wife came in the  middle of it  and, like  me  before, she  couldn't see  what  was  so funny.  It's one you need to sit  down and enjoy. Maybe you need a  couple of  kids to watch it  with. I'll have  to see how I react solo.  I can't wait !!",1027814400,2,1178,3.9030837004405288

1449927,2,B00005JKXE,"Steve Oedekerk's (he was responsible for the Ace Ventura movies) name will never be associated with subtlety or wit but still the idea of this goofy guy in the middle of an old Hong Kong action film sounded promising.  I was thinking that something wonderfully goofy like Young Frankenstein or The Life of Brian or maybe like What's up, Tiger Lilly (which is the film this oddity most resembles) would result.  Unfortunately, despite some amazing technical work that is worth seeing, the viewer is left seeing a promising comic idea whither and die an excruciating death.
There is some good here.  Steve Oedekerk obviously spent a lot of time getting fit and learning to move well.  He sometimes has something close to grace in some of his comic pratfalls. It's also obvious, from the director's commentary, that he has a lot of affection for and knowledge about this genre. This shows in the amazing way that Mr. Oedekerk is inserted into the old scenes and the way he matches them with new footage almost seamlessly.  The old film footage looks wonderful and must have required a monstrous effort to restore to this level.
Unfortunately all this good work is also undone by Oedekerk who sabotages it relentlessly.  One of his first errors is being the voice for almost every single character on screen.  This is funny for the old master of the temple but works horribly for the female romantic lead (he often has her squealing in a high pitched pig voice).  It also becomes monotonous because the voices often sound like the same person with a limited vocal range trying (and failing) for different effects.
Oedekerk also keeps on with his few good routines well after the laughter has died out on everyone's lips.  Witness the rushing camera zooms in his second big fight of the film.  Funny at first and then it becomes old and stale.  Also Oedekerk has to underline every funny act as if we couldn't get it without a repeated double take or a camera pressed relentlessly right into the joke.
And then there is the humor which is, as expected, juvenile and sophmoric but shows not even the cleverness of Adam Sandler and it doesn't go anywhere.  For example, the story.  It begins with a legend of The Chosen One (who bears the mark of a talking tongue) who must avenge his family's death at the hands of a dictatorial bully who is working for a mysterious council that fears him.  In the middle of this with no relation to anything in the genre Oedekerk inserts a fight with a lactating cow.  Probably because his comic imagination was so limited he couldn't think of anymore funny stuff to do with the film without inserting a complete non sequitur that contributes nothing but a bizarre sight gag (although maybe the milk shooting is the best parody of The Matrix I have yet seen but aren't these Matrix references getting a bit stale??) and then disappears almost completely without a trace.  My recommendation would be to see the film only if you are a big fan of Steve Oedekerk or love Martial Arts parodies.  People who enjoy good comedy would be wise to steer clear.
The DVD is a pretty nice package.  There is an okay director's commentary featuring Oedekerk and the film's producer and film editor(!) and an alternate soundtrack where you can hear the actual actor's voices and what they were saying before Oedekerk overdubbed them.  All this stuff was actually scripted by Oedekerk and doesn't really make much sense (all the original martial arts film sequences are in Mandarin) but it is funny and it is a relief to get away from his voice. There is a brief promotional featurette and some nice brief features on the special effects of the film.  The transfer looks great. I'm sure getting the two films to match well was a challenge at every point in the process and the colors look full and natural and the grain is appropriate to this film genre and actually enhances the viewing experience.
In conclusion, good DVD package, good technical work, bad film.",1027555200,6,3975,4.708513708513708
1449928,4,B00005JKXE,"Steve Oedekerk, the warped mind that gave us Thumb Wars (parody of Star Wars), Thumbtanic (parody of Titanic) and the infamous Blair Thumb, now inflicts upon us his bizarre humor in Kung Pow.
This is not a movie that will stretch your cerebral cortex, and is probably best enjoyed while on thorazine. It is a dumb movie, nearly tragically so, but despite my personal cynicism, I found myself laughing right out loud. Perhaps the reason this movie seems funny is that Kung Pow is almost as stupid as most  of the martial arts movies themselves. Stupid begets stupid, but at least Oedekerk employed creative and entertaining stupidity.
Do not mistake my meaning here, as I was entirely entertained watching this movie. If the viewer can appreciate ""ludirous as art"", they will find this an entertaining movie. With wild abandon, Oedekerk unleashes his wit on everything in sight, particularly other movies, such as the Matrix.
Personally, I do not see this movie being any more, nor less ludicrious, than many Jett Li movies or those of Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. Lets be ruthlessly honest. Some of the traditional martial art flicks are really insipid, and Oedekerk lampoons them with ruthless satire and deadly accurate humor.
I suspect those who are fans of foreign karate pictures may be highly upset with Oedekerk and regard this movie with a hypercritically jaundiced eye. For others who regard most martial arts flicks as absurd, if not ridiculous, they will be thoroughly entertained as Oedekerk renders his parody with black belt humor.
It isn't a movie that is going to appeal to everybody. It isn't a movie that will enhance your baseline I.Q. It is a dumb movie. Dumb, funny, silly, and even ridiculous. But I enjoyed this film, and if you accept it for what it is, then you are likely to find it entertaining as well.",1027468800,2,1827,4.8370607028754
1449929,4,B00005JKXE,"First off, let me say that I really like it when modern fancy digital trickery is used for an entirely stupid and silly purpose.  Such is the case in ""Kung Pow: Enter The Fist"".  It's clear that Steve Oedekerk and crew prided themselves on this movie making little or no sense at all.  Oedekerk had himself digitally inserted into dozens of existing scenes from other older movies simply because he could and it looked ridiculous.  It made for a refreshing and funny experience.  Now, for the DVD of this film:  Nice selection of extras, delete scenes, commentary and the like.  But the best part is they were able to offer the viewer something totally unique to this silly little film:  The original audio tracks from the 1970's kung-fu movies they ""borrowed"".  This track includes Oedekerk's original dialogue(which he naturally replaced later with his own selection of silly  voices for the dialogue).  The ""original"" recordings he made had him saying utter nonsense, thus allowing the dub over later to look like an authentic kung-fu movie.  Simple yet quite effective.  Another gem on there is the sixth ""English"" track.  I use it in quotes because this track is just someone reading the dialogue with a British accent!  This is just a great example of some movie makers who were just out to have some fun.  I can think of nothing I'd rather see more of than that.",1027296000,5,1369,4.761702127659574

They did such a great job that I didn't even realize till the shots at the end of how it was made that the female lead was from the original movie, and not a new character.

Sometimes specific episodes seemed like they'd be tedious or boring in some movies, but this movie set its mood so precisely that they were welcome here. A movie like CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, with its dead-serious tone demanding a creedence that was certainly stretched by scenes seeming to defy gravity and other things, invites having minor fun poked at it by a spoof like this. As such this movie is timely, and that perhaps increases its charm. Should someone call this film stupid, that would be hard to refute, but if stupid, it's delightfully stupid. Maybe its success is due to being perfectly attuned in what it demands from its audience.

You have to see it to hear some of the outrageous one-liners: ...""What do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord?""... a cameo by Mufasa from Lion King, heck, even a vilian named Betty who listens to rap and picks up chicks before his epic battles! Not to mention the classic wee-ooo at the end of every sentence (its one of those you'd have to be there things).

1450047,4,B00005JKXE,"A movie like ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist"" is one of those types that seems to come along every decade or so.  Honestly, Kung Pow is probably the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. But, I don't think that I have ever laughed so hard in my life!  This movie is basically an old kung fu flick who's rights were bought, and then chopped up and re-edited and re-dubbed.  The whole movie was intentionally re-dubbed with the lip-sinc being totally off just like an old kung fu flick.  Certain clips are also used over and over again but with different dialoug giving it this goofy look.  I have watched this movie at least 5 times now and it just gets funnier and funnier because, Since I'm so busy laughing, I miss out on some parts.  All in all, if you're the kind of person who likes Mystery Science Theater 3000, this movie is right up your alley!",1019174400,,848,4.30188679245283

The reason why it's so funny is it's so stupid! Not ""It's so pathetic i'm gonna laugh at it"" stupid, but ""laughing at it because they purposely made it stupid"" stupid...get it?

1450123,2,B00005JKXE,"Can you complain about a movie that shows kung-fu cows (complete with milk shot through its udders in dramatic Matrix-style bullet-time?)  Can you complain about a movie that is poorly dubbed with whiny, childish, and otherwise awful voiceovers -- intentionally?  Walking into a theater with the full expectation of seeing practically every adolescent joke a 12-year-old could think of, including fart jokes, gopher-chucks, nipple-twisting and leg-humping (as weapons), is it even fair to complain this movie is stupid?
Well, uh.. yeah.  You'll laugh out loud a few times, if just for the absolute ridiculousness of it all, but for the most part, the jokes are more irritating and overly repetitive than funny.  Considering this movie probably won't outgross How High, the movie's suggestion that a sequel is coming out - now that's pretty funny.

There are a lot of movies that succeed at being both deliberately stupid and funny at the same time - the classic Airplane (still one of my all-time favorites), The Naked Gun, Dumb and Dumber, etc...  Even Oedekerk's Star Wars spoof Thumb-Wars was pretty funny.  Unfortunately, this movie is stupid but rarely funny.  You've been warned (again).",1013644800,2,1193,5.209424083769633
1450124,4,B00005JKXE,"There's not much I can say about writer-director Steve Oedekerk's ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist,"" a spoof on the kung-fu movies of an era gone by that contains jokes, gags, and humor ranging from chuckle-inducing to all-stops-outs belly laughs. As a humorous play on a overly cheesy film genre that only gets goofier with age, the film follows all the necessary rules; the good news is that unlike such a film as, say, ""Scary Movie,"" you don't necessarily have to be acquainted with movies of this sort to appreciate Oedekerk's brand of humor.
Using the elements of the digital age to insert himself as a character in the 1976 Hong Kong film ""Tiger and Crane Fist,"" Oedekerk plays The Chosen One, whose family life was stripped from him in his infant years at the hands of Master Pain, who, in the present, adopts the name ""Betty."" Chosen One returns after many years, bent on exacting revenge against Betty.
A pretty lame setup, considering the fact that it was the plot of an actual film. What Oedekerk has done is removed the film's main hero and placed himself and various new characters into the film, all the while providing the replacement voices in the redubbiing process.
All of this is corny and cheesy, to be sure, but what is most surprising about the movie is how funny it can actually be if you can get into it. The spoofs of ""The Matrix"" and ""The Lion King"" aren't exactly fresh, but they still manage a good deal of hearty chuckles. The bigs laughs come from the Oedekerk's voicing of his character's lady-love, who spends much of her time running around yelling ""wee-ohh;"" the narration of the story, at times, provides humorous commentary on the present situation, and was I the only one who got a kick out of the tongue gag?
What's most enjoyable about a movie like ""Kung Pow"" is that its dialogue fits right in with the body language and movements of its characters; at one point, a highly-revered master breaks into a coughing fit during the middle of a discussion. Oedekerk's solution? Insert a fly that will enter his mouth. This, and many of the movie's sight and sound gags, are cheap in their construction and execution, but still manage to provide one with a well-spent 80 minutes of almost-continuous laughter. Wee-ooh!",1013472000,15,2243,4.709923664122138

1450127,5,B00005JKXE,"Ok, here it is. Everyone I ve talked to said it was the stupidest thing ever. But you know what I agree to a point. It's not your run of the mill spoof movie. Don't expect an Austin Powers/ SpaceBalls or any other. Treat this movie like an independent Art Piece. Enjoy it for what it is. A mockery of foriegn films dubbed in English. Mostly Kung FU type films. This film creatively uses an original piece and intergrates todays actors as well as little things that you might not catch. The film's originallity lies in the freshness of it. Some parts of the movie's dialogue seems to be original, almost improvic, like they wrote a script, shot the movie and then threw the script out. The little quarks in the movie are great. Expect to see little commercial jingles as well as a little of sci fi, including Matrix, stargate and indpendence day references.
Don't take the movie too serious and you'll enjoy the heck out of it. My coodos to the director and writer and actors. Woo-wee

 That doesn't mean it isn't funny, though. I spent most of the 80-something minutes laughing, so how bad could it have been..?
 Writer/Director Steve Oedekerk stars as ""The Chosen One"" (raised in a ditch by ""Various Rodents..), chosen for WHAT we never learn. We Do know that the mark of The Chosen One is a bizarre face that sits on the tip of his tongue, and the the evil Master Pain, A.K.A. ""Betty"", wants him dead. That's pretty much it, plot-wise. The really amazing part of the movie is this: It's an old Hong-Kong action movie, with Oedekerk digitally inserted; kind of a Zelig/What's Up Tiger Lilly?/Forrest Gump mish-mash. (Stick around for the credits and you'll see scenes from the original, and see how they put Oedekerk into the action.)
 The BIG problem with Kung-Pow IS Oedekerk. He looks like your next-door neighbor; not someone who should be on the big-screen. I just didn't think HE was that funny. (He DID provide EVERY VOICE-OVER for the Movie, so I guess he's funny as long as I can't see him...) The real laughs come from the other characters.
 There are a lot of laughs to be had in Kung-Pow. As long as you're expecting a low-brow, lightweight film, you won't be disappointed.
