8579055,5,B00CA4S452,Two very underrated public domain classics. So glad to finally get high quality versions. And these are top notch transfers.,1501891200,,124,5.25
8579056,5,B00CA4S452,"These are both first class restorations of films hopelessly lost public domain.  The black and white restoration of ""Dementia 13"" is magnificent and the colors on ""The Terror"" are bright for once and not muddy.",1442275200,,210,5.0
8579057,5,B00CA4S452,"Finally after all those subpar pan and scan fullscreen version of Dementia 13 and The Terror, we now have restored anamporphic widecreen transfers of them!

Each film comes with BOTH a blu-ray and and a DVD of the film in a collectable slipsleave that houses the two cases, so this set comes with four discs total.

The restorations are the best I have I ever seen for these two films, and I have owned several different versions on various formats (on both VHS and DVD, all fullscreen)

Of thse two films included, I enjoy Dementia 13 more, as it is Francis Ford Coppola's film debut as well, but The Terror has it's own charm too, being one of Jack Nicholson's first films and was directed by several directors including Roger Corman, Francis Ford Coppola, Jack Hill, Monte Hellman, and even Jack Nicholson (Althogh only Roger Corman is given sole directors credit).

Film Chest did a great job with these restorations!",1368403200,3,921,4.7375
