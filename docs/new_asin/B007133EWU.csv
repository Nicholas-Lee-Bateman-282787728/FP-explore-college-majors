5046580,5,B007133EWU,"Joey Dunlop, was truly a motorcycle riding champion. How he was able to hang on to win,based on the excruciating physical requirements, and the professionalism, of true motorcycle racing, would appear to be miraculous,based on races like the ""Isle of Man""",1397174400,,255,5.2439024390243905
5046581,5,B007133EWU,"Everything you ever wanted to know about a legend, Joey Dunlop was a good father, good friend and a legend on a motorcycle",1390089600,,122,4.3478260869565215
5046582,2,B007133EWU,"Nice guy
Big funeral
Very little footage of actual racing
Not worth sitting through
But yes, a nice nice guy",1390003200,,108,4.45
5046583,5,B007133EWU,Usual Joey information. Great to know where he came from and his unusual character. No doubt he is one of the greatest riders in M/ cycle history.,1381536000,,146,4.444444444444445
5046584,5,B007133EWU,Mostly a documentary about Joey. There is some race footage but. Would like to see more. Lots of interviews with friends and family telling of the man they knew. Very interesting . Takes a while to understand them with the heavy accents but I loved it . He was a role model for all of us.,1376092800,,288,4.160714285714286
5046585,3,B007133EWU,"Not the best edited or filmed work I have ever seen, could have used subtitles as most of the dialogue is almost unintelligible due to the thick Irish brogues. However the actual footage of Joey Dunlop racing is worth the wait, the man could ride! It's also touching to see how revered he was by family , friends and fans. Too bad motorcycle racing doesn't enjoy the same status here in the US  where rednecks think racing happens in one direction on an oval track...",1371945600,,467,4.4941176470588236
5046586,5,B007133EWU,Excellent. Thank you.,1435708800,,21,6.333333333333333
5046587,4,B007133EWU,"I really enjoyed it, especially the archival racing footage.  Joey's exploits weren't that well known here in the states, and that's a shame because he was easily one of the finest motorcycle racers to ever slip on a pair of leathers.

Definitely a good watch!",1418860800,,260,4.7555555555555555
5046588,4,B007133EWU,it's old but good,1416787200,,17,3.5
5046589,1,B007133EWU,"A great racer but a poor tribute to the man.  This is like an Irish wake sans the booze, therefore, you don't leave with a good buzz.  As others have mentioned, too much of the ""tell us what you think of Joey"".  Should've had more of his racing highlights and a narrative of his career.  The film makers missed a great opportunity to tell a whole new generation of motorcycle racing enthusiasts of one of the greatests road racers to ever leave rubber on the macadam.",1413590400,,467,4.395348837209302
5046590,4,B007133EWU,Wonderful retrospective of an amazing person.  My Yankee ears had some trouble deciphering Irish accents ... altho' that took nothing away from the program.,1410480000,,156,5.5

5046593,5,B007133EWU,"Excellent biography of an excellent racer and what appears to be a very thoughtful, kind and modest human being.  A great film for motorcycle race fans.  I loved viewing it.  PN",1400716800,,177,4.645161290322581
5046594,3,B007133EWU,I enjoyed the documentary. Nice seeing all the family and friends. I would have enjoyed a little more about his fantastic racing ability.,1398816000,,137,5.0
5046595,2,B007133EWU,The movie was a never ending stream of people saying how great Joey was with a few shots of him racing in between. I would have liked more of his history and video clips of his racing. I could only get through about 45 minutes of it before I gave up.,1398643200,4,250,3.9215686274509802
8507972,3,B007133EWU,I have only watched the first quarter of it and it is all talk and no bike footage so far.  Hopefully that'll change.,1510358400,,117,4.086956521739131
8507973,3,B007133EWU,"Not enough racing footage.  Is mostly interviews, and the British accent is hard to understand.",1475539200,,95,5.333333333333333

8507980,5,B007133EWU,"For a motorcycle aficionado this film is a must see. Perhaps the greatest professional rider of the last 100 years. This film highlights only 100 of the thousands of great moments he gave us on the track and gives an insight to the man himself. This film brought back fond memories, and let me relive some of those races which I was fortunate enough to get too watch.",1445126400,,367,4.411764705882353
