7034774,5,B00UART7YI,Great classic series of the FOX kids in the 90s.  Would recommend everyone to watch,1497225600,,83,4.533333333333333

7034776,4,B00UART7YI,"This was one of my favorite shows back in the day, and I'm so pleased to finally have a copy on DVD. I do wish, however, that a little more effort had been put into remastering it. Making it widescreen, for instance. The recording looks as it did on old TVs, square, and since it's formatted for a widescreen TV, you get to see thick black bars on both sides of the screen. Not a deal-breaker, but it's definitely dating itself. There also appears to be an issue with the sizing of the screen in random episodes, as you can sometimes see bits of the border along the top of the screen. Again, I'm only reporting on the quality for those looking to purchase this series. It doesn't bother me much.

Others report on episodes being out of order. That does seem to be true, however, I'm one of those who isn't interested in skipping around through discs to find the next chronological episode. Each episode is a 20 minute story with adventure and comedy; I'm not fussed about them being out of order. Chronological order doesn't seem to affect the larger plot much.

Special features are lacking in this DVD collection. There's a featurette about the story of Young Hercules (I haven't watched it) and that's all. I would have loved to have seen a gag reel, or even a Where Are They Now with interviews from the cast today. Maybe someday that'll happen. Until then, I'll enjoy watching episodes I watched when I was a preteen, laughing and cringing at all the lame humor and loving every second of it.

If you're a fan of Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi's work (especially Xena: Warrior Princess and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys), definitely add this to your collection!",1492646400,,1664,4.577181208053691

7034781,5,B00UART7YI,"This arrived a day later then it said it would but I ordered it for myself for Christmas. I remembered watching this show when it first came out and it got me into reading a lot on Greek and Roman Mythology. Loved this show and still do. Kevin Smith as Ares, Dean O Gorman as Iolaus, a lot of people now know him that plays Fili on The Hobbit series and you have also Chris Conrad, who plays King of Cornath and Ryan Gosling as Hercules.
Wished though Netflix had it for streaming but it's all good, brings back some good memories. It's also a fun and kid friendly show.",1481846400,2,570,4.1909090909090905

7034784,4,B00UART7YI,"I loved this series I would watch it every day when it came on.  Sadly missed the last episode when it aired but before it aired again the show went off air.  While I watched this in the order it is on the disks I was disappointed to find the episodes weren't in order.  This is noticable through out but it is very clear on disk 6.  Thesius (sp) shows up in an episode as a good friend to Herc and the rest of the cadets, than a couple of episodes later they don't know who he is.  While this was annoying it didn't take away my enjoyment from finally watching this series again.",1472774400,2,580,4.052631578947368

7034786,5,B00UART7YI,"This show is much more high-spirited than the Legendary Journeys and Xena, and it's a little dumb and childish in areas, but it's great. There's a lot of humor in it, and the very last episode (especially the very end of it) was FANTASTIC. I highly recommend it.",1469836800,2,262,4.479166666666667

7034793,5,B00UART7YI,"Great stories from a simpler time! Yes, it was a kids' show and campy, but it was meant to be. And considering the cast, especially Ryan Gosling and Dean O'Gormon, it was well-acted and a great companion to the ""adult"" series starring Kevin Sorbo and Michael Hurst. The stories are enjoyable for all ages; considering it was shown daily, it's quite fleshed out. I enjoyed the series with my kids when they were small, and I enjoy them still today.",1456617600,,447,4.6

7034798,5,B00UART7YI,"Great to finally have the complete series on DVD! I'm sure the popularity of Ryan Gosling has a lot to do with this series finally being released. If you like Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, then this series of Young Hercules brings the same mix of action, humor, mythology and anachronisms, and would be perfect for introducing a young fan to this world of fun and adventure.

If you have seen every episode of Hercules and Xena, pay special attention to the guest stars and recurring actors of Young Herc: for me it's great fun to spot actors and actresses who appear on all three series at one time or another. An obvious example is Dean O'Gorman, who plays Young Iolaus, but also played several different characters in both regular Hercules and Xena episodes. And of course the late, much-missed Kevin Smith, who gets to demonstrate his versatility and comedic sense here as Timor, a poor farmer who looks just like Ares, the God of War.

I tried to find the answer online to the question of the order of the episodes on this set. Several fans think the DVD set presents the episodes in production order, which would make sense. The bonus feature of interviews with the writing staff was very interesting to me.",1446336000,4,1244,4.701834862385321

7034810,4,B00UART7YI,"I was just a kid when this series premiered, and I watched it (along with its parent shows, ""Hercules"" and ""Xena"") with something like religious fervor during its original run. When I found out ""Young Hercules"" was coming out on DVD, I was very excited...but also somewhat troubled. You see, the original series aired wildly out of order and caused major gaps in consistency and story logic. My friends and I used to argue about the order the episodes should be in as kids, and I hoped that the DVD set would provide the corrected viewing order.

Alas, it does not, so I must deduct a star. The episodes are given in order of air date, not in the correct viewing order. The corrected order is as follows below, for other fans' reference.

Whew! Despite the fact that the episodes aren't in order, this set is quite nice. My old VHS tapes (yes, I still have them...shut up) were really worn out and having the series in DVD quality is a major plus. There is also a short featurette by the writers of the show that is nice to have.

Overall, I would recommend this set, with the caveat that the episodes are way off. Four stars.",1435622400,27,2663,4.08604206500956
7034811,5,B00UART7YI,"Great as a prequel to Hercules the Legendary Journeys, and great as a stand alone title",1433548800,,87,4.5
7034812,5,B00UART7YI,"If you are not concerned with region coding.....there is an 11 disc version on Amazon.de
Cost is only slightly higher with shipping and video quality is generally higher for the European producer Koch Media
as compared to Shout! (and other producers).

I generally like Shout!, but 50 episodes and a featurette on a 6-disc set is really too high of a compression level.",1429833600,,369,4.857142857142857
7034813,5,B00UART7YI,"The ""Young Hercules"" series follows its predecessors' footsteps, with Ryan Gosling as the title star. Young Iolaus is played by Dean O'Gorman, best known these days as Fili the Dwarf in The Hobbit Trilogy. Yes, that's him!

Reprising their roles from ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" and ""Xena - Warrior Princess"" are the late Kevin Smith as Ares, God of War, Joel Tobeck as Strife (a rather Jim Carrey-ish godling), and Meghan Diesmond as the Goddess Discord. The only real downside to this series is that the episodes are only half the length of the other series', but they cram a lot of action and story content into those reduced time-slots.

50 episodes of our then-teen heartthrob Ryan Gosling as Hercules, telling a lot of cool 24 minute stories, in the comical style of its predecessors, while also relaying some good lessons in the process. Unlike adult Hercules & Xena, there's little to no sexual content in this series, so it makes it very well-suited to younger audiences, and families.

Note: When the series originally aired, they were aired horrifically out of chronological sequence, making a very confusing mess. One hopes that when they assembled this collection, they corrected this oversight. I'll be posting an update to this review once I receive my copy, so everyone can know what they'll be purchasing.  One may also note a LOT of continuity errors between the material of the early years of Hercules and the later years, including this series. One could blame the writers, or just sit back, shrug it off, and laugh yourself silly with the comedy elements of this series.",1426723200,22,1598,4.929368029739777
