8025911,2,B0002CERWI,Very disappointed in this. Was hoping the characters would be updated a bit but they weren't and the quality of the picture is bad. It looks like it was taken directly from a VHS and not cleaned up at all. Don't bother buying it is my opinion.,1427414400,,243,4.191489361702128
8025912,3,B0002CERWI,"As someone who's never seen the original series, allow me to offer my thoughts on the movie from a purely unbiased viewpoint.

I love this movie and can't understand how they never made a series out of it.  As Peter Gunn, Peter Strauss is cool in the finest sense.  He's confident without being overly-macho; he's not aggressive unless he has to be; and his comebacks are actually witty instead of silly.  In short, he's classy in a way too many ""cool"" heroes fail to achieve.

The plot, set in the 1960s, involves Gunn being caught in the middle of a battle between two mob bosses.  The brother of one has been murdered, setting off a gang war, with Gunn trying to figure out who the real killer is so the two sides will stop putting out hits on each other.

Complicating things are Gunn's new, ditzy secretary; his girlfriend, who's conflicted about their relationship; and the real killer, who seems to be egging on the lethal mob attacks and counter-attacks.

Gunn uses the typical dual weapons of the '60s television hero:  his fists and his verbal wit, and he relies only on the former when the latter fails him.  The wonderful thing about this movie is that the witty remarks are parceled out not just to Strauss, but to quite a few of the characters.  Even Gunn's former boss, Lt. Jacoby, gets off some good zingers.  When Jacoby wants to question Tony Amatti's beautiful lady friend, Amatti will only identify her as ""an old friend.""  As the woman slinks away, Jacoby looks her up and down and replies, ""She can't be THAT old.""

And if you liked Blake Edwards' ""Pink Panther"" movies, there's even something here for you -- one of those scenes in which every time you think the situation can't get worse, it does.  It's a ""kitchen sink"" scene in which everything that could possibly ruin Gunn's evening conspires to happen to him all at once.

One other extra is that all of these shenanigans are set to the music of Henry Mancini, and Mancini's stuff fits this movie like a smooth velvet glove.  And even those of us who never saw the original TV series are familiar with the hard-boiled, jazzy ""Peter Gunn"" theme, which is well-represented here.

If I have a complaint about the movie itself, it's that, ever since I originally saw this on ABC in 1989, I have YET to think of a way they could've possibly made the opening credits more cheaply.  I mean, really?  You've got this funny, entertaining movie, and your opening titles look like they were designed in all of five minutes on a cheap TV station character generator?  Come on....

Anyway.  So, the writing is excellent.  Very pleasurable popcorn entertainment.  What makes me rate this product lower is that the DVD itself is somewhat poor.  Not only isn't the movie ""restored"", it's apparently not even from a good print.  It's adequate, that's all, in terms of sharpness.  And it's dark.  I've never had a DVD with an image dark enough that I actually had to adjust the TV to compensate, but I did with this one.  Sound quality, like the image, is just adequate.  And this movie is ""obscure"" enough that, while I didn't expect anything like extra features, I sure didn't think it would come without even closed captions.  Ah well...you'll just have to turn up the brightness AND the sound.

The weirdest thing of all?  At about 41 min. into the movie, and again at about 51 min. in, the picture switches to color bars -- yes, color bars!  They go away after a few seconds, but really -- WTF??

Packaging is, like the video and sound, only adequate.  I mean, it has a decent box...but the cover insert is purely amateur hour.  It looks like a bad Photoshop job done on someone's home printer, and whoever worked on the box photo needs to learn what an ASPECT RATIO is.

I really hate to give this an average rating, because I had a lot of fun watching the movie.  In fact, I find it highly re-watchable -- but purely because of the acting, writing and music, not because of the quality of the DVD itself.

8025915,4,B0002CERWI,if you like the tv series get the movie you won't be dissapointed. It has the mancini title song/ the jazz singer jennifer edwards /the humor and the acting is pretty good along with the dialogue. its close to being as good as the series but not quite.,1279584000,4,252,4.270833333333333

8025917,4,B0002CERWI,"Peter Gunn represents the panache and cool of the late 50's and early 60's urban scene.  I remember watching this show as a kid and still today that easily recognizable intro of the theme song by the late Henry Mancini is firmly implanted in my consciousness.  This version starring Peter Strauss ( a brilliant actor) pays a laudable homage to the TV show.  Peter Strauss could be Craig Stevens revisited, yet Strauss adds his own personal stamp on the role. The plot may be a little thin and contrived, but having Strauss and Ms. Pearl Bailey (in one of her last roles prior to leaving us) as ""Mother"" more than makes up for the film's shortcomings.  While the other supporting characters are not quite the same as the originals, they do a credible and noteworthy job.  I think Blake Edwards wanted to introduce a new generation to the ""Gunn"" private eye genre.  While this film does have some flaws, I think it's a worthy effort and it's entertaining to watch.",1187654400,2,962,4.629411764705883
