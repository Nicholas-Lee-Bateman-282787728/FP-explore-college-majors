4669405,5,B005EXA87S,"First, an historical note.

In 1967, Moby Dick & The Mighty Mightor came on Saturday Mornings in Los Angeles (Channel ""4""). It was another entry from the (then) mighty Hanna-Barbera Studios, which, from 1966-1968, absolutely ruled Saturdays on all three major affliates in town:

1. KNXT-TV (Columbia Broadcasting System(CBS) - Channel ""2"")
2. KNBC-TV (National Broadcasting System(NBC) - Channel ""4"")
3. KABC-TV (American Broadcasting System(ABC) - Channel ""7"")

With that out of the way, I'll break this review into two sections:

1. Moby Dick - A super whale who finds, befriends and watches over two children while they search for their father who was lost at sea during an scientific expedition. This half of the show details their adventures. Personally, it was just ""ok"" If standing on its own, it would garner at best, 3 stars.

2. Mighty Mightor - The story of a young cave dweller (named ""Tor"") who saves an old Hermit being threatened by a menacing T-Rex type of creature. The Hermit, being grateful, bestows upon Tor a mystical club that possesses great power. To invoke this power, Tor only needs to raise the club above his head and say, ""Migh-Tor"" and he is instantly transformed into a being of great strength and power.

This is where the fun begins.

As a side ""benefit"", his pet dinosaur (""Tag"" - as in ""Guten Tag"" - german for ""Good Day""), is changed into a Fire-breathing Flying Dragon. What used to crack me up was the narrator saying ""transferred"" instead of ""transformed"" when it came to Tag. But, I digress...

What amazed me about the cartoon was the level that Mightor dealt with the bad guys he encountered. There was nothing nice about those times, Tor's village was a peaceful place to live, and Mightor meant to keep it that way, using and (and every) means at his disposal.

Violence? Oh, yes! Living in that hostile environment, Mightor had to deal with some very savage groups determined to attack, over-run and/or conquer his home. To attack his village was to be totally defeated/destroyed. Personally, even as an 8 year old, my view at that time was, ""That's what they get! They should've left Tor's village alone!""

But there was one, ""complication"".

Tor's alter ego (Mightor) was one big secret.

He even had a girl that he liked (if nothing else, he had good taste!). But in this girl's eyes, he wasn't much more than a boy (and a scary one at that), so, Tor already had two strikes against him in the romance department

And, ahem, she kinda had a ""thing"" for Mightor.

And, she had a younger brother (""Little Rock"") who did nothing but get in trouble trying to be a ""Mightor wanna-be"".

Watch the cartoons, and you'll see what I mean!

One of my most favorite cartoons in the mid-to-late 60's!

I rate Mighty Mightor: 5 stars!

P.S.: One of my favorite Space Ghost episodes is where Space Ghost briefly meets Mightor. I figured that space ghost is anywhere from 6'1 to 6'5, but, standing next to Mightor, he looked like a kid - as Space Ghost just came to Mightor's shoulder. That made Mightor stand somewhere around 7'1 to 7'5 - I mean he was at least TWICE Space Ghost's size! This 8-year-old was blown away by that comparison. But, you'll have to get the Space Ghost Series (or find/watch it on Youtube) to see it! Don't worry, Space Ghost, too is worth the money!! Have fun!",1313712000,36,3321,4.696551724137931

4669448,4,B005EXA87S,"As I have said in my Herculoids review, I am happy to finally have this Alex Toth, Hanna Barbera action adventure cartoon series, Finally there is a place for fun,hard to get cartoon and movie titles!(Warner Archive collection) While remastering and restoring would make these cartoons look more polished and mint conditioned I still enjoy these high quality prints that are vibrant and colorful! I find it fun to spot all the fun action, humour and thrills that Action for childrens television put down and censored from later tv cartoons,which made most of them bland and dull in the 1970s and 1980s!! Bruce W. Timm(1990's Batman the animated series) was influenced by Alex Toth's character designs and the Max Fleicher Superman cartoons so it is fun to look back at these 1960s action adventure episodes and their place in fantasy animation history! I wish there was an art gallery feature on this 2disc dvd set for displaying Alex Toth's model sheets for Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor! Moby Dick with two kids here is certainly different from what Herman Melville had in mind with his whaling novel! But maybe Moby here is the vicious Moby's friendly lost brother! Mightor's throwing and hammering of the bad guys reminds me of both Popeye and Superman! Again I really hope Hanna and Barbera's SHAZZAN series with the SHAZZAN genie becomes available really soon like in this spring, summer or fall of 2012!! It is hard to wait to have all these Alex Toth 1960s cartoons in my collection!! So get them while you can!!",1430179200,,1519,4.823754789272031
4669449,4,B005EXA87S,"Thanks to my Dad, I've always been a huge fan of the classic Hanna Barbara cartoons, specifically their superhero/action shows, such as ""Space Ghost"", ""The Impossibles"", and ""Jonny Quest"".  For the time, the animation was pretty good, and the art styles often evoked a comic book  or pulp magazine feel.

This half hour gave us two cartoons in one; the first taking place in the prehistoric times, centered around a young boy who transformed into a superhero via a magic club.  (Basically, it's the stone age version of Captain Marvel/Shazzam.) The other was about two boys, Tom and Tub, who fell off a boat and were rescued by a giant, white whale.  Both shows are your basic, Saturday morning cartoon fare. The plots aren't really that deep, and just involve Mightor protecting his village from something or someone (with the help of a fire breathing dragon), or the boys running into some monster of the week under the ocean and Moby Dick having to save them (along with their seal friend, Scooby, not to be confused with the famous dog of the same name).

That certainly doesn't mean this show isn't fun--far from it. Any time Mightor shows up with that really great transformation sound effect, you know something like an awesome dinosaur fight's about to happen.  The Moby Dick segments are a little less exciting by comparison, but it makes up for it by both Moby and Scooby being utterly adorable.  If you live near the ocean, what kid wouldn't want to have a giant whale as their friend and protector?

The DVD is made on demand, and the picture quality is excellent.  Sadly, there's nothing in the way of special features.  But if you're a Hanna Barbara fan, and want something a little more action packed, give this series a watch.",1429920000,2,1742,4.7161716171617165

4669473,5,B005EXA87S,"One of my first cartoon experiences that made Saturday morning the source of my creativity today. I remember tuning in to any network and grabbing a bowl of Quisp cereal and being transported to this magical world that seemed so empowering.  This was a boys world and no Smurfs or Care Bears were to be found. I guess Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound were more universal for all kids.

I was a little skeptical with purchasing something so obscure, yet somewhere in my memory hid Moby DIck and Mighty Mightor's dinosaur world. A little boy of 4 found dinosaurs as sweet as a bowl of Quisp cereal. A prehistoric super hero who punched out these beast were just who I wanted to grow up to be. I even had a stick from outside that I held up and yelled MIGHTOR!!

Next came Moby Dick, who I just loved and imagined him swimming in the bathtub with me. This was innocent fun in the spirit of pure adventure and I didn't care if Tom and Tug were ever rescued. Moby Dick was a boys best friend.

Alas, the spirit of courage and adventure didn't last long as this cartoon wonderland disappeared after a few years. Adult groups rallied, and said the lineup was too violent. I guess it was long enough to sew the seeds of courage and adventure in my mind. Thanks to Warner Brothers, they have released this to a very refined niche audience and I am able to bring this world back to life on Saturday mornings or any time. Now if I only had a bowl of Quisp cereal...",1420675200,5,1453,4.330882352941177

4669502,3,B005EXA87S,"If there were half stars, I would actually give this one a 2 1/2, but it's better than a 2. Where Moby Dick is a bit of a silly plot, with a whale and his two kid pals, the Mighty Mightor (not much thought put into that name) is actually quite captivating, at times. Although. like the Birdman show, the lead is an obvious imitation of HB's Space Ghost, this one can at least stand on its own two feet. The prehistoric backdrop adds a bit to the atmosphere and the villains are actually quite good (one of the better shows for this).

4669508,3,B005EXA87S,"I bought this for Mightor only.  I find the Moby Dick episodes pretty lame, but then Mightor himself isn't all that awesome, either. Interesting to me mainly for the sharp comparisons to the later Filmation He-Man series. An interesting piece of animation history but both shows are pretty much assembly line, by-the-numbers filler that Hanna-Barbera studios cranked out by the TON back in the 60's & 70's. For me, the charm of Mightor, aside from the He-Man similarities, are the character designs by Alex Toth. Mightor basically comes across a lot like Space Ghost in a loin cloth, but given that they're both created by the same artist who was stuck working on a tight timetable with a limited H-B budget, it's really no surprise.

Episodes look pretty good considering their age and the fact that this release is an M.O.D. (Manufactured-on-demand) DVD-r release from Warner Bros.' Archives division.  That means no remastering, no restoration and zero extras, like 99% of their MOD stuff. Important for H-B fans & completists, and curious animation fans like myself.
