3727070,3,B001O4C6WG,"Growing up, I loved this show (on Ch 11 in NY, I think). Forty plus years later, I can't believe how awful it was. Cheap effects, bad dialogue, etc. Still I found it hard to turn off, as it was a part of my childhood. My wife had never heard of the show, despite growing up here as well, so she sees it unjaundiced, and agrees that it's just plain bad. My thanks to the DVD company for having made the effort to find this show.",1306800000,2,427,3.9767441860465116
3727071,5,B001O4C6WG,"I received the DVDs promptly and in perfect shape. The quality of the video is the best it could be. I haven't watched most of it yet, so I can't say anymore. I am happy with the process with Amazon.",1281744000,3,199,4.0

8329439,5,B001O4C6WG,"If you, like me, are a child of the 60s, then you may remember the Diver Dan show.  For years I have asked people whether they remembered it, and in particular the Barracuda's song (""There's nothing ruder than a barracuda, they're the rudest fishes in the sea""), only to get blank stares from most.

This set will instantly bring you back to that era - a much simpler time, when the only special effects were things like filming through an aquarium to make it seem like the set is underwater.  I love it!",1470960000,2,504,4.397849462365591
8329440,5,B001O4C6WG,"If you grew up in Chicago during the 60s or so, then you remember Diver Dan on Ray Rainer early morning show. This is a great product.  I am running for President of The United States, and from time to time, I need a mental break, so I watch something uplifting that teaches morals and family values and faith in God; I feel these through Diver Dan.  My Presidential Daily Issues Blog is:  http://presidentkopitke2016.blogspot.com/

Great value, for a great TV series.
Praise Ye The Lord,

8329441,1,B001O4C6WG,"How or why I ever liked these as kid is beyo d me. The episodes are about a minute or so in length and absolutely atrocious! I actually bought the entire series about 8 years ago when they cost much more. Watched a few with the kids, apologized to my kids, complained to my wife that the kids had lost all respect for me and my childhood,  then flogged em on eBay",1448496000,,363,4.041666666666667
8329442,2,B001O4C6WG,"First, it is great to see this again, after all the people in the SCA who don't understand why I tell them to ""Call me 'Baron', nincompoop!"" and won't respond appropriately.. Love the characters.

  But... not only is the ""collection"" incomplete..... the episodes are in what appears to be a random sequence, with arcs broken up without rhyme or reason.  I want to find these people, and tell them to call me ""Baron"", incompetents!",1417132800,,431,4.783783783783784
8329443,3,B001O4C6WG,"I like it but it isn't the complete series, I fell it was mis represented",1410134400,,73,3.933333333333333
8329444,3,B001O4C6WG,"For some unknown reason, this set has been described as including the complete series.  It does not.  It is just the shrinkwrapped Diver Dan (Alpha Video ALP 5152D / UPC 0 89218 51529 2) and the shrinkwrapped Diver Dan Volume 2 (Alpha Video ALP 5710D / UPC 0 89218 57109 0) shrinkwrapped together.  A big, plain white sticker identifies the whole package with the following:

""Diver Dan Classic TV Series Collection Volumes 1 & 2 (5-DVD)
A 2-DVD set containing 30 episodes from the classic live action TV series featuring Diver Dan and his underwater pals.
Starring Diver Dan
0 89218 96139 6
Alpha Video 9613D""

(See the picture I've posted of it below.)

I don't know why the label has ""(5-DVD)"" on it.  Each volume comes in its own keep case and contains 15 episodes in BLACK AND WHITE.  I remember watching these episodes in full color back in the 60s and 70s on WGN-TV channel 9 in Chicago as part of Ray Rayner and Friends.  Although the picture clarity on these discs is adequate, the lack of color definitely detracts from the enjoyment of seeing Miss Minerva in her full, golden glory.

As others have mentioned, the episodes are NOT in the correct order.

The first volume contains the following episodes:

01 (Episode #34) THE BUBBLING PIT
02 (Episode #35) THE VOLCANO
03 (Episode #36) DEPTH CHARGE

11 (Episode #13) AN UNUSUAL TREASURE
12 (Episode #14) TRIGGER'S REVENGE
13 (Episode #20) RIDDLE OF THE HERMIT CRAB
14 (Episode #21) SARGASSO SEA
15 (Episode #22) LOST IN THE SARGASSO SEA

The second volume contains the following episodes:

LTC (LOVING THE CLASSICS), Inc. released a 2-disc set in one DVD keep case entitled ""Diver Dan (1961)"" with UPC 6 49159 78113 1.
- This set is not in Amazon's database
- LTC used the same UPC number for their release of the  movie ""Honolulu Lu"".
- It is described on www.lovingtheclassics.com as ""4 disc set, complete series"".
- The back of the DVD case states, ""Complete 40 cartoons on a 2 disc set
- The 2-disc set actually has 30 episodes (15 on each disc)
-- ""Disk 1"" contents are exactly the same as Diver Dan 2 (Alpha Video ALP 5710D / UPC 0 89218 57109 0)
-- ""Disk 2"" contents are exactly the same as Diver Dan (Alpha Video ALP 5152D / UPC 0 89218 51529 2)
- LTC, Inc. release is almost certainly sourced from the Alpha Video releases
-- The Alpha Video releases contain customized, undersea menus.
-- The LTC release has very basic, generic DVD recorder menus.
-- The odds of both companies randomly coming up with the exact same randomly ordered track listing is very low.
-- The Alpha Video package design is  2006.
-- The LTC package design is  2008.

Episodes #10, #15, #18, #28, #29, and #30 have been unavailable on DVD as of 02/01/14.

I've attached a few color pics to give you an idea of what we're missing watching these episodes in color.  The ones showing a clapboard are actually from the raw footage for those particular scenes.  I did the screen captures to help confirm the fact the show was filmed in color.  The raw footage was originally sourced from the extras included in a ""Diver Dan"" videocassette released in the 80s.  That's the reason for the muted colors and lack of sharpness.",1389916800,9,4467,4.663265306122449
8329445,4,B001O4C6WG,"I grew up watching Diver Dan.  Baron Barracuda and Trigger are two characters that made a big impression on me.  It's a lot of fun re-visiting the under water world that is Diver Dan.  Unfortunately, these DVDs are not in chronological order.  The final episode seems to be near the front of the sequence.  Plus, some story lines never get completed.  The odd thing is, I remember watching as a child and experiencing the same issue.  I don't understand why this series is/was so disjointed.  But the DVD itself is well preserved and the episodes look and sound good...well as good as they could considering everything was shot through a fish tank!  It's great fun to see my old friends again.",1371427200,2,693,4.661157024793388
8329446,3,B001O4C6WG,"While all of the episodes are here and complete, they are out of order as others have pointed out. I'm pretty sure I remember seeing these in color way back when I was a kid.  A little grainy and soft at times but where else are you going to be able to see these? If you want to see Diver Dan again then this set does deliver.",1355011200,3,326,3.8656716417910446
8329447,5,B001O4C6WG,"These old shows are a great way to take a trip back in time to childhood days in the 1960s.  The sweet innocence of these shows is remarkable, as Diver Dan emerges out of the black-and-white darkness to have adventures with his fishy friends.  The imagery is iconic and dream-like, and the theme song is endearing.  You will re-live
sensations of youth, and these simple and remarkable images will stay with you.",1311120000,6,412,4.694444444444445
