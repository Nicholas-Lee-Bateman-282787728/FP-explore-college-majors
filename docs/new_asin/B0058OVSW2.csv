4601502,4,B0058OVSW2,"Informative and well produced (not overly flashly, loud or annoying).  It made us even more interested in top bar hives.  You'll still need other ways to gather information (classes, books, etc.) but it gives you a lot of good, basic information and helps you know which areas you want more data on.",1361145600,2,299,4.730769230769231
4601503,4,B0058OVSW2,"The DVD is well done.  Just know that it is for a specific style of bee keeping, but according to me the best style of bee keeping.",1352764800,,131,3.8518518518518516
4601504,4,B0058OVSW2,"I have watched this video twice so far and each time I learn more. I ordered it in preparation of my venture into bee guardianship. I learned more from this video than I have from many of the books I purchased. In it they show with amazing graphics, the order of the hive and the difference between comb with capped honey, comb with brood and comb with pollen or nectar. There is so much to learn about bees and this video is a great place to start.",1337731200,5,449,4.172413793103448
4601505,5,B0058OVSW2,"The Video is very thorough, informative, and inspiring. The narration is almost meditative and the film work is visually appealing. Well produced. I was surprised to see much of the bee handling done without protective gear, gloves, and smoke. A very refreshing approach to Bee keeping.... These guys are on the right track... Impressive...",1327017600,9,340,5.314814814814815
4601506,5,B0058OVSW2,"I received this new DVD as a gift for Christmas. It is absolutely fabulous! I was aware of the top-bar hive concept and I was very sure that was the way I wanted to go but it didn't all really make sense to me until I saw this instructional film.

You will learn so much about bees, their environment, why the top-bar hive is by far the best way to raise a home hive, and get step-by-step instructions on taking care of your own hive throughout the year. And the quality of the production is terrific. Just beautiful.

This is certainly the most helpful tool for anyone who is interested in starting their first hive or converting to a top-bar hive. I found it on their website at backyardhive.com with some other very good information. I highly recommend it to everyone who want to begin a relationship with bees and become a bee guardian!",1326672000,11,840,4.4480519480519485

8462116,3,B0058OVSW2,Lots of good information about using top bar hives provided mostly visually - you watch a person doing it.  But the dialogue and music makes you sleepy.  I love the stereo sound with the occasional loud bee drone from the left speaker.,1429401600,,235,4.571428571428571

8462121,5,B0058OVSW2,"The dvd ""Back Yard Hive"" is an excellent introduction to keeping bees in the top bar hive style.  The top bar hive style is a way for home owners to keep bees in a fairly simply way.  Every step from ordering the hive and the bees, though setting up the hive, to hive maintenance, to harvesting the honey, to winter care of the hive is covered simply and clearly.  The images and demonstrations are well done.  The level of presentation is excellent without jargon or overly technical terms.  All terms used are well explained and demonstrated.

I strongly recommend this dvd to anyone thinking of keeping bees in their back yard or acreage.",1364256000,6,641,4.628318584070796
8462122,5,B0058OVSW2,This will be recommended by me to others who want to raise bees...what a revelation and carefully instructive showing clearly the beauty of nature and the need to approach our place on earth with care and intelligence. Fabre's work opened the way for really seeing insect life and in doing so we are honoring the best in ourselves...protection for the bees=protection for our own lives.,1361750400,2,386,4.953846153846154
