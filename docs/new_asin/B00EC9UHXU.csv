5901532,5,B00EC9UHXU,My 6 and 2 year old daughters love this movie! They sing along to the songs. Great for a car ride or road trip.,1386892800,,111,3.6666666666666665
5901533,4,B00EC9UHXU,"Pretty standard Dora, I wish the actual ice skating story was longer because my four year old doesn't really like the Shape Train one but really liked the ""ice witch one"". We rented this and although we own a lot of the Dora movies I probably won't purchase the full length film. She much prefers Dora's Knighthood Adventure or Dora Saves the Crystal Kingdom.",1384387200,2,359,4.625
5901534,5,B00EC9UHXU,"My girls love Dora the Explorer. This DVD contains three episodes from the Nick Jr. cartoon. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

1. Dora's Ice Skating Spectacular - Dora and Boots must help their Snow friends get their ice skates back.
2. Catch that Shape Train - Dora and Boots must find a runaway train's steering wheel.
3. Dora and Perrito to the Rescue - Dora and her dog must save Boots from the Big River.",1380240000,22,498,4.354838709677419

5901539,3,B00EC9UHXU,"I don't understand the point that if this.  One extra ice movie that is 20ish  minutes and the rest I'm pretty sure we've watched free on Amazon Prime.  Kindof a ripoff,  but it was a month long rental.  My daughter loved it.  I did not,  but thst I'd to be expected.",1435104000,3,267,4.117647058823529

5901553,2,B00EC9UHXU,I was a little disappointed in this video.  I was expecting the full dvd to be the Ice Skating Spectacular but there was only 1 short episode then the rest of the video was just regular Dora episodes.  I don't think I will be renting any of the other Dora DVDs.  My granddaughter liked it but she would have been just as satisfied with the previous seasons that I could have streamed for free with my Amazon Prime.,1418860800,,414,4.282051282051282

5901560,1,B00EC9UHXU,I selected this from the movie category and expected a Dora movie about skating.  It was three random TV episodes packaged together complete with three theme songs and three sets of credits.,1399334400,4,190,4.9375
