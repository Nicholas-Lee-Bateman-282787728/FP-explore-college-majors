3712468,5,B001NCE3R0,"The review by MSUKate, who is evidently part of the psychiatric establishment, clearly highlights why GENERATION RX is such an important film. `Kate' is a denialist, and she notes that ""so many people in this film are so quick to blame the drugs that they have become blinded."" I would submit to you that it is Kate and her cohorts who are blinded -- and they are subjecting their air-filled science upon millions of children for professional and financial gain.

How else can one explain her villifying Pultizer Prize nominated science journalist Robert Whitaker's take on the use of psychiatric meds among children and teens? In the film, Whitaker clearly expresses that he was a strong believer in the merits of these drugs -- until he actually conducted the research and examined the scientific studies that any responsible journalist must. When he learned that the science was NOT able to support the claims of the psychiatric and pharmaceutical communities, Whitaker showed great integrity by speaking out against what he called the ""fraud perpetrated on the American public.""

`MSUKate' also claims that ""psychoactive drugs are not prescribed without cause,"" which is complete and utter nonsense, unless one considers a child squirming in his chair to be just cause for drugging him/her with Speed/Ritalin. Finally, Kate opines, ""I found this so-called documentary very one-sided and highly biased.""

The reality is that GENERATION RX tells ""the rest of the story,"" the one that the drug reps and purveyors of shoddy science don't want you to hear. God forbid that you would be made aware of possible dangers of these drugs before you actually put your child on them!

What are these people afraid of? It appears that Kate -- and indeed the entire psychiatric community --  are simply afraid of the truth.",1237766400,5,1812,5.046822742474917
3712469,2,B001NCE3R0,"This documentary drew my attention because it addresses the use of psychoactive drugs in children and the possible problems that arise with them.

What this film does is vilify psychiatry and the drugs that are used.  I am not saying that some of their arguments are groundless, but they forget one major aspect of proof.  That correlation does not imply causation.  Meaning that because a person took a psychoactive drug, means that it definitively caused the adverse event.

It seems that so many people in this film are so quick to blame the drugs that they have become blinded to all other information.

One thing that they forget is that 1. psychoactive drugs are not prescribed without cause.  Your doctor believes that this will help you, and that the benefits outweigh the risks. and 2.  that Millions of people have been helped by these drugs.  That a lot of people go through a lot of extreme symptoms and some of these psychoactive medications are the only thing that helps them.

I found this so-called documentary very one-sided and highly biased.",1236643200,5,1060,4.838888888888889
3712470,5,B001NCE3R0,"This was an excellent documentary and very eye-opening.  It is also not as hard to watch as I thought it would be.  But tells it like it is.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone - so that you can be informed and protect both yourself and others from the deadly affects of modern ""legal"" prescription drugs.

Even the psychiatrists and pharmacists who have been involved in creating these concoctions have admitted time and again that they don't work, that they are harmful, that they are based on no testing, that their full effects are unknown, and that their success is purely a marketing success and not a success in science or workability.",1233273600,5,645,4.68141592920354

3712476,5,B001NCE3R0,"Cutting to the chase, I want to tell you that I am living proof of how these drugs can destroy your life. I didn't sit and watch this documentary feeling any need to be convinced. I feel sorry for those who deny the claims made within this horrifying expose. Ritalin and Prozac have the capability of truly crippling your mental and physical health as they have done to me. In 1969 I was diagnosed as having a mental condition because my teacher informed my mother that I was too hyperactive in class. The truth is I was just figity and not paying attention enough to suit the teacher. I was seen by a shrink and put on Ritalin. I was 8 years old. The drug made me feel so strange and dopey that I couldn't function well at all. I felt like a zombie. I was on it for years. It was a horrible experience. After I was taken off the drug I was never the same again. I became distant from people, very shy, depressed, and had suicidal thoughts often. I also suffered from psychotic episodes where I felt like I was loosing total touch with reality. By my teens I couldn't fit into society at all. In 1980 I suffered a total mental breakdown, and have been seeing phychiatrists ever since. I developed severe IBS, and episodes of severe mental symptoms that would last 10 to 21 days that went on for more than 17 years. I was put on prozac a few years ago which caused some of the worst mental suffering I have ever experienced, so alalming in fact that the doctor took me off of it after just a couple of weeks.. These drugs are simply evil. Eli Lilly who introduced prozac into society interestingly enough also created LSD, and used the basic blueprint of that drug to create Prozac, Check into it if you think I'm fibbing,. I feel so very sad for the hundreds of thousands of children that will be destroyed by these drugs as I was destroyed, and cry in my heart for those who have or will commited suicide because of these horrible medications.",1367625600,13,1944,4.343406593406593

3712480,4,B001NCE3R0,"While most of the suicide information is dated; the inclusion of the warning though does little to prevent the use by many teens in America. While the continued over-prescription of ADD/ADHD medications is still relevant and persistent in our society and not likely to get better. Since teachers, counselors and doctors started pushing for the medication of children who the ""couldn't handle"" in the classroom the use of these medications has increased; which is disturbing since many European countries are now banning the use of these Methylphenidate drugs in children. Perhaps an update to this would be in order.

3712481,2,B001NCE3R0,I agree with a lot of these reviews about this film being propaganda. There is a lot of missing evidence throughout this film.

3712482,5,B001NCE3R0,"This film, based in part upon serious and sound scholarship, that draws poignant links among the pharmaceutical companies, the Federal and Drug Administration (FDA), and mental health professionals is a must see for anyone who wants to improve upon our health care system, so that it is truly in accordance with fundamental ethical principles in order to improve upon the quality of life for all.  Some of its facts that the German equivalent of the FDA did not approve Prozac because of its links to suicidal ideation and gestures; that in one year alone 2,000 children had attempted suicide who were on psychotropics; that close to one third of children in Atlanta are on psychotropics; the hypocrisy to have Drug Free Zones around school districts with so many children on drugs in side the schools; 90% of the drug ritalin, banned for decades and now where the USA consumes 90% of its global sales; and  the conflicts of interest of those who authored the DSM-IV  are definitely not in the mainstream media and need to be better known.  Certainly, not all health professionals are ""in collusion,"" so to speak and the film has a plethora of experts who acknowledge the failure of these drugs that have destroyed lives of children.  It might have been enhanced by noting international human rights law by referring to such documents as the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness, which clearly asserts that drugs should not be administered for the convenience of others, but only to enhance the well being of patients, something our health system has failed to do.",1306108800,10,1569,4.90566037735849
3712483,5,B001NCE3R0,The over-medicating of our children is a problem I see every day in my practice as a pharmacy technician.  It is a problem that is only getting worse.  The only thing that will change it is parents becoming educated about the truth regarding these drugs and the forces driving the diagnosis and prescribing of them.  This is a video that every parent and teenager should see.,1303171200,6,375,4.651515151515151
3712484,1,B001NCE3R0,"I'm no big pharma fan but what a joke. This film is like a mid-century propaganda film. It does nothing but make false claims. It claims antidepressants actually cause neurotransmitter deficiencies. That there is zero evidence that they help depression and that depression is basically made up by the drug companies. It shows footage from the Columbine shooting several times when only one of the shooters had been previously prescribed antidepressants. Obviously antidepressants weren't the common link in that situation. I could go on and on.

8323469,5,B001NCE3R0,"As a damaged patient who was never informed of the risks of antidepressants and benzodiazepines (or the lack of their efficacy), I wish I had seen this film before 2011 when my descent into disability fueled by these drugs began.  This journey has forced me to learn so much about the underpinnings of modern medical treatments and their science (or lack thereof).  Having been so damaged, I find it particularly disturbing that I can find no medical help to repair it despite a growing number of publications and great movies such as this calling out these drugs and harmful medical practices for what they are.  As a self-proclaimed ""survivor"" of treatment, I applaud the maker of this film.  Raising awareness is critical for those who have been harmed already and those who are headed for disaster in the future.

I understand a second film is coming.  I look forward to it's release and will help promote it so that perhaps even just one person is spared from the damage that was done to me and so many others in the name of greed.",1470960000,2,1036,4.633879781420765
