336495,5,6301374290,"Starting off in a mafia-controlled seafood restaurant, we find Fletch in drag and the object of desire of a near-sighted Greek man.  And he doesn't even get reimbursed for the leg waxing ... it's all automatically deducted from his paycheck by computer ... ah, those undocumented expenses ...
Inheriting a Louisiana mansion, Fletch flies down next to an obnoxious but friendly nasal-surgery candidate. Yet another classic dream sequence, and this one is not to be missed.  As ""Old White Joe"", Fletch fantasizes that his ex-wife's lawyer, his boss and Betty, the cute gal from the office, all fall at his feet. The imagery from Disney's ""Song of the South"" is pure genius and you might notice ""Ted Underhill"" making a cameo appearance at the end of the dream sequence (there must have been 300 extras here or a *whole* lot of CGI ... check out the *very end* of the dream sequence closely).
I love it. Again beautiful women involved here including the lovely Julianne Phillips. This is Cleavon Little's best work since ""Blazing Saddles"" (though he was great in the early 1970's ""Vanishing Point""). Randall ""Tex"" Cobb never fails to amuse especially with his ""Ben Dover"" appearance as a *faux* zooerastia-obsessed transvestite necrophiliac (get a dictionary!). Now this movie doesn't bash Christians, in fact there are some accurately quoted Bible verses. But it does lampoon some who misuse Christianity for money solely.
Phil Hartman is here as a Bly Bio Chem manager. Richard Libertini is back and a little goosey it appears. Hal Holbrook is here as the vengeful attorney / land owner. And the great Geoffrey Lewis who never fails to deliver an interesting, if not xenophobic and myopic, character, is here. Little is ""Calculus Entropy"" causing Chase to introduce himself as ""Geometry Fletch"" and the real-estate attorney as ""Miss Trigonometry Ross"". As Billy Gene King of Bug Busters, Fletch investigates Miss Ross's house for ""Reticularious Marios Cuomos"" (approximately!). Dangerous African Flesh-Eating Termites, not only do they cause the walls in Miss Ross's house to be deplaning to an alarming degree but they jump into the ear of the sheriff's deputy. Fortunately, Fletch gives him sound advice on how to get those termites out. Too funny! Besides, how many movies have the terms ""carpetbagger"", ""toxic waste"" and ""The (Rolling) Stones"" in them? ...
On one of my trips to Universal Studios in the early '90's, I saw the Ark they used for ""Fletch Lives"" as well as the street scene they used for the ""flood"".  We were on the tour ""tram"" so we couldn't get out but we did get to experience a flood.  Cool!",1046995200,2,2613,4.97254004576659

In this day and age it becomes increasingly hard to find a comedy of this stature. Chase is a  genious who has  perfect timing .Their is also an  unforgetable  cameo by  the late Phil Hartman .Fletch Lives desrves more.

The movie is set in the American South and a lot of time is spent making fun of southerners.  There are times when it is genuinely funny.  ""Fletch"", of course, is always smarter than everybody else.  No one else has a clue.  In the context it reminds me of the pseudo intellectual elites who always know more than the people.  Honestly I find that somewhat offensive.  But the bottom line is the movie is funny and is successful in amusing a viewer.  Thank You...",1476403200,,559,4.257142857142857

This is one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. And pretty close to ""Three Amigos"" for Chevy Chase's worst movie. It lacks total plausibility, is an absolute farce, and lacks any warmth or heart of the first. There isn't a single character that's well written. And it reaches drastically for chuckles, totally wasting the talents of it's best actors, including R. Lee Erney, Hal Holbrook and Clevon Little. Too much forced attempts at humor often leaning on cliches. By only a 1/4 way through it, I was ready to shut it off. But left it running to say I sat through it. Who knows? Maybe it'll get better? NOT! Wasted time. There's better ways to waste your time.",1422144000,,834,4.457516339869281

My husband and I have seen this many times, yet, find missed nuances and smart-aleck asides each time. This is a case of the sequel being even sweeter than the original (Fletch - also masterful.) Chase is my favorite comedian and I miss the Chase/Akroyd/Ramis and other 70's - 90's era geniuses. Steve Martin, too, of course. This movie actually is part social commentary, part sleuthing, and mostly Chevy Chase being a fearless, smart-alecky, and smart Journalist. WHAT A CLASSIC!",1405728000,2,558,4.946808510638298

337075,4,6301374290,"OK, Fletch Lives is not as good as the original Fletch film. But that doesn't mean that it's a bad movie. Fletch seems less in-control this time, and is more accident prone to fit Chevy Chase's old schtick. But that's not bad. This is a funny movie, and it looks good too.

This is a Louisiana movie. Filmed there, and it has stereotypes all over the place. Strange thing is, these stereotypes are both true and untrue, and I know because I live in Louisiana. If you love Louisiana, you definitely need to see this movie, since it's a lesser-known LA state film.

Also, the DVD cover to this movie is AWFUL. The original movie poster was a great-looking ""Gone with the Wind"" spoof painting, which looked fabulous. That was used as the VHS cover too.

337144,2,6301374290,"I watched this movie a bunch of times as a kid, but my wife and I turned it off after about 30 minutes last night because it simply wasn't funny.  I think Chevy Chase's sarcasm had its day in the 1980's but I think there's a reason he hasn't gotten as many movie roles as time has gone on.

One way or the other, we watched about 30 minutes, and my wife laughed exactly once (which was once more than I did).  Cleavon Little (the sheriff from Blazing Saddles) brings some relief just because he's so likeable, but the rest of the time the jokes just kind of made us squirm.

Sometimes you can enjoy a comedy even if it doesn't make you laugh, but I find this one pretty vapid: The only character I care about is Cleavon Little, and there's no life lesson hiding under the surface.  All we learn is that Fletch thinks a bunch of people are stupid, that televangelists scam their viewers, and that corrupt businessmen use money and the guise of respectability to cover up their crimes.  Funny for a junior high kid, but not for grown-ups.",1273881600,,1036,4.341968911917099

It has a more serious look at some time honoured cliches about the South (evangelism, racism, quaintness) which may be less fair as time goes on, but as they say cliches exist for a reason. Chevy Chase's swansong and the last passable effort of his career - unless you want to count Memoirs of an Invisible Man. Buy the double CD with Fletch or else skip this one.

I think Chase does very good in this movie with his one-liners and sarcasm.

As with the first FLETCH movie, there is a mystery as to who the antagonist is.  That really doesn't matter in this movie because it is so funny throughout the rest of it.

337195,3,6301374290,"I don't think I'd ever heard of Fletch before meeting my boyfriend, never mind Chevy Chase. Since then, I've had the opportunity to see some of the Chevy Chase films that he's best known for, but I still prefer the National Lampoon series. They're slightly more memorable. I consequently bought my boyfriend all the Fletch books by Gregory McDonald last Christmas or something. I finally relented and watched Fletch Lives, cos I was getting sick of the puppydog eyes.

Fletch Lives has Chevy Chase in a number of disguises, and all but one I recognised as being him. He's certainly one of those actors who can put on a totally different accent without any effort, and I applaud him for that, cos it's something I cannot do. It makes the characters more realistic, unlike certain actors who cannot put on a different accent no matter how much you pay them. But it still doesn't make me like Keanu Reeves any less.

Fletch discovers he's inherited a rather run down mansion down south, gives up his job, and moves down. Along the way he has daydreams along the lines of the Song Of The South movie (which I saw many, many years ago) and gets into a song & dance routine, probably spoofing Song Of The South? There's another mystery to be solved, when a woman he sleeps with, is dead by morning. Poor Fletch. Wonder what the real cause of it was?! :) He sets about solving the mystery.

I bought my boyfriend quite a few of the books, so it's a shame there's only been two films. There might even be more Gregory McDonald Fletch books out there, that I missed. There could have been a real film franchise there.

Fletch Lives is good, but is less memorable than the National Lampoon Vacation series, but still worth a watch.",1159574400,2,1721,4.541935483870968

I love Fletch Live, it is so damn funny and cackles with hilarious dialogue. It's a bloody shame that the critics were beastly, when it first came out. Chevy Chase, once again, nails the role of Fletch and only he can deliver the deadpan sarcasm in a way no other actor can.

The plot may be a little weak but it works fine. Fletch quits his job as an investigative reporter after he inherits a plantation mansion in Louisiana. But he stumbles upon another mystery and does his best to unravel it.

His disguises will make you grin from ear to ear (Claude Henry Smoot steals the show) and they way he comes out with the most ridiculous of things when he's talking to people makes you wonder why they ever believe it. As Peter Lemonjello, Fletch tells a studio camera operator that his house is on fire. The guy believes him!

I do wish that they had used more of the Bibleland sets as it seems so much for so little screen time but the presence of R. Lee Ermey as the eccentric TV Evangelist makes up for it.

I'm not really that impressed with this lackluster DVD. There are still pictures over the end credits that hint at deleted scenes, but none of them are on here. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is fine, as is the Dolby Surround sound design. But it's yet another non-effort by Universal. Fletch Lives really deserved a lot more than this.

And to any of you who are puzzled why Mr. Underhill is credited in the cast of characters but not actually in the film, he IS. Look closely at the Zipedee Doo-Dah sequence and you can see him as one of the dancers.",1146268800,13,1818,4.524390243902439

- Chevy as a member of the KKK

- Chevy confessing his sins to evangelist preacher ""I parked in a handicapped zone.  Actually on a handicapped person - but I told him I'd be back in five minues so that's not such a big deal.""

Amusing film about an attempt by nefarious forces to buy ancestral land bequeathed to Fletch (Chevy Chase) by his late aunt.  Chase is his usual hilarious self.  The plot is a bit confused, but becomes clear as the story develops.  The background scenery of the old south, with its ivy covered mansions, Spanish moss covered trees and swamp is reminiscent of Georgia around the Okefenokee swamp, but without the alligators and cottonmouth moccasins (although reference is made to the latter.)

This is a fun film to spend an evening with.  Some allusions to sexual miscopnduct in a jailhouse scene by Chase and Tex Cobb (Ben Dover), but nothing too raunchy.  It will pass for an over 13 auduence, I think.

I absolutely LOVE Fletch Lives, and I sometimes laugh just THINKING about some of the scenes.  The ""Bug-Busters"" scene, the Klan rally, and the Claude Henry Smoot scenes are the best. DEFINATELY watch Fletch Lives, then watch it again. As with some of the better comedies it only gets better the second, third, and 4th times you see it.",1082505600,,479,4.759036144578313
337253,5,6301374290,"Director Michael Ritchie and Chevy Chase team up once again for FLETCH LIVES, with Chase reprising the role of Irwin ""Fletch"" Fletcher, newspaper journalist and master of disguise. When his recently deceased aunt bequeaths her decrepit manor to him, Fletch travels down south to rural Louisiana. Initially, things go well, especially when he hooks up with a flirtatious southern belle. But when he wakes up the morning after, he's shocked to find that she has been murdered. In order to catch the killers and clear himself, the intrepid, chameleon-like Fletch must infiltrate the congregation of Jimmy Lee Farnsworth (R. Lee Ermey), a greedy local preacher who wants to gain control of Fletch's land in order to build a Bible-themed amusement park. Written by Leon Capetanos, FLETCH LIVES crackles with the same blend of rapid-fire dialogue and visual jokes as the original, making it a solid sequel that works on its own terms. By thrusting the big city character into a shady small Southern community, Chase is given an entirely new field on which to play. It's this contrast--especially between himself and R. Lee Ermey--that provides the film with its loudest laughs.",1069632000,,1171,5.136125654450262

Chase dons lots of disguises in this film, as he did in the first, but these disguises are more numerous, and funnier than before. There is some adult humor, as is the norm with Chevy Chase movies, but not a lot of it. This is a must have for Chase fans, or comedy fans in general.",1059782400,4,603,4.298245614035087
