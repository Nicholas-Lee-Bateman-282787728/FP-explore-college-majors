""Yo im from little rock, yo im from NY, yo im from cali,"" is all you here in this flick. Men everywhere. If you want to see men in their cars screaming where there from, then this vid is for you!

7933555,1,B000059HII,"I really don't understand how the people who made this ""hip hopumenatry"" plan to make their money back, unless they plan all the people who went to Freaknik 2000 to buy a copy to see if they're in it.  This movie is basically a video documentary of Freaknik, Black College Spring Break in Atlanta.  I don't know if I can really call it a documentary because it doesn't really follow any really flow of ideas.  The main idea of this movie is booty.  That gets old real fast.  It is amazing though to watch people let total strangers just lift up their skirts and smack their booties.  Makes no sense to me, maybe you just have to be there.  Anyway, pass on this one and just check out some No Limit videos and you'll fill the same booty quota.",991094400,5,742,4.294964028776978
