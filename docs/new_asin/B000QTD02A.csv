Yes this is a very low buget film but it is worth a look if you are a gorehound like me. The story is not very orginal but the gore in this film is very impressive for the buget they had. And the kill scenes are very cruel and brutal. So if your in the mood for a low buget gorefest. Check it out.

8325649,1,B000QTD02A,"BE FOREWARNED! The front cover and DVD are printed with a visually arresting image that has NOTHING  whatsoever to do with the contents of the disc, or a single solitary scene in the movie. There is ANOTHER movie called The Traveler, starring Val Kilmer, that does include an impressive and well done bagging/suffocation scene (rendered somewhat stupid by the decapitation at the end). The makers of THIS Traveler have sought to lead unsuspecting viewers, who are seeking out this scene,  astray by implying that this is that movie. Frankly, I'm not sure if a bagging scene would have saved this slop, but it'd have been worth a try.",1296432000,,633,4.851851851851852
8325650,1,B000QTD02A,This was a stupid and low budget movie.  The acting was so bad and pathetic that I didn't even finish watching this crap.  I can't believe this garbage even made it in the stores.  In the right hands (i.e. Stephen King) it could've been a great movie.  Buyers beware.,1286064000,2,267,4.387755102040816
