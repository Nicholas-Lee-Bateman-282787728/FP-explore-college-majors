Very  amusing how she would ""play"" a note on the piano,and the other cat would strike the keys or hammers to get Nora's attention. One has to realize this is not a Hollywood clip, just an ordinary cat doing performing as cats do.",1214352000,,286,4.377358490566038
8218510,4,B000VEKH08,"I bought this CD for my mother, who loves animals and likes to contribute to organizations that help them.

She loves the video and watched it a couple of times on the day that she received it.  She says it is really cute.

From speaking to her (as I have not viewed the CD), two complaints might be that the segments are too short or another short segment should be added to justify the cost.

Overall, a fuzzy furry feeling results from watching!!",1202601600,,449,4.373493975903615
8218511,5,B000VEKH08,"Nora the Piano Cat is an absolute delight!  Cat lovers, musicians, and anyone who just enjoys a good laugh will all love Nora.  Had I really looked in to just how short this DVD is (I think the total length is less than 15 minutes) I don't know that I would have paid full price for it, but I have no regrets.  I could watch Nora over and over again...even my cat was intrigued!  Make no mistake, she is not playing Mozart here, or even chopsticks, but she gets an A for effort and enthusiasm.  I think her duets are the best.....I love Nora!",1195776000,,542,4.173076923076923

I love Nora.",1194566400,,97,4.705882352941177
