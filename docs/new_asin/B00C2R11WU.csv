5688958,4,B00C2R11WU,"Ellen dies from a heroin overdose.  About the same time her uncle Niles in Tremo, Texas also dies, leaving her everything. Her look-a-like roommate/user/waitress (Sarah Haley Webb) and her new boyfriend Billy (Josh Henderson) devise a scheme for Sarah to impersonate the dead Ellen and get the ""7 figure"" inheritance in a small town where everyone is related and has secrets.

Cameron (Aidan Quinn) is the attorney for the estate. His brother Bob (Beau Bridges) is the sheriff while Belle (Lorna Raver)their mother was Niles' housekeeper. The plot includes private letters with secrets, revealing DVDs, and murder.

The movie held my interest from stem to stern. There are twists which you see coming and twists which you don't. There were a few moments of dark comedy. It is a well put together film with a semi-grindhouse plot and Louisiana bayou musical score.

Written, directed, and produced by Antoni Stutz.

8576641,2,B00C2R11WU,"Bluntly speaking? This movie needs a heapin' helpin' of edits and character personality implants. The paper mache leads are buried when talents Bridges and Quinn enter the script - and that's only 1/7 of the film's faux pas. See, Rushlights coulda been so good...but it's not; oddly reactive, non-invested people doing outrageous silly - foreshadowed - and way-to-out-there schemes and scams. And watch the actual, oddly focused upon, drinks here; too funny - but not meant to be...just lazy shooting; unless the half full glass of ice tea in first scene was some kind of deeply dug in tale of a life being half full. Yeah. No. It was just shot weird. Next time, call a script doctor to help purge the poop. And an editor with an eye for what makes drama, dramatic,  and a true crime twister ~ Love and knishes, Emily Blunt, BluntReview (dot) com",1464825600,,846,4.716216216216216

8576646,3,B00C2R11WU,An okay film if one had absolutely nothing else with which to entertain oneself.  Story line fell short of expectations.,1378944000,,120,5.0
8576647,3,B00C2R11WU,"Looking for another reason not to visit Texas? Rushlights is one weird, but beautifully shot indie film about a couple Billy (Dallas' Josh Henderson) and Sarah (Haley Webb, Final Destination) scheme to get millions by impersonating her dead friend to get an inheritance. As Billy says early in the film, everyone has a story to tell and their past come back to haunt them.

Sounds like a easy plan, show up, claim to be a dead girl and walk away with millions. Things go well until everyone and their mother in Tremo, Tx - including Sheriff Sheriff Robert Brogden, Jr.  (Beau Bridges), the scheming couple's lawyer Cameron Brogden (Aidan Quinn), a mysterious long lost son and Sarah's former drug dealer wants a piece of the action.  There's even a little procedural elements thrown in, when we find out that the victim was actually murdered.

Writer/Director Antoni Stutz, (was co-written  by does an admirable job in his 2nd film and infuses it with some nice cinematography and ambiance, but doesn't get much out of his actors.  I'm really loving Henderson on Dallas, but don't think he is as charismatic as every director seems to think he is. His ""smoldering"" look normally comes across as ""bewildered.""

The movie suffers from being an overly complicated potboiler and too stylized. There are too many shady characters to keep track of. Who are we supposed to be rooting for here? There are several moments in the film when it gets a bit over the top violent, but it is earned violence because I did want to see these people get taken out so it didn't come across as gratuitous.  As Billy says early in the film, everyone has a story to tell and their past come back to haunt them.  Rushlights is now available on Blu-ray/DVD and OnDemand.

This isn't a bad film to catch on cable when it comes out, but not one worth purchasing.",1376524800,2,1835,4.688473520249222
