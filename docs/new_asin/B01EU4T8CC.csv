8759553,5,B01EU4T8CC,"Dealing with a Bi Polar disorder must need  a huge feat of strength.  Madison Davenport and Taryn Manning did a fabulous portrayal of the daughter and mother.  Anyone who thinks they can stop their meds for this disorder is delusional.  Feeling better is a sign that the meds do work, not that they can be stopped at the whim of the patient when the patient feels better.",1520380800,,371,4.492537313432836

8759555,4,B01EU4T8CC,"Beautifully captured tale of broken family dynamics. The lead heroine plays a realistic role in her valient coming to grips with Severe mental Illness. I wish the makers of the film would have said she HAS  bi-polar disorder and is not bi- polar. As in she is not her disease. Poignant, touching and true to life. I may know, someone close to me is afflicted with the same illness. Heart wrenching. Overall very well crafted dialogue and true to form life drama .",1478304000,,463,4.578313253012048

8759558,4,B01EU4T8CC,"""A Light Beneath Their Feet"" (2015 release; 90 min.) brings the story of a mother and daughter. As the movie opens we see the daughter Beth doing dishes, while her mom Gloria is taking prescription medication of some sort. Pretty quickly we get the idea that something is really ""off"" with mom (probably bi-polar), which pushes Beth, a senior in high school, in the unusual position of having to care for her mom, rather than the other way around, In the meantime, Beth, already accepted at Northwestern (her mom's school of choice because it's nearby) and also at UCLA (Beth's school of choice because it 's far away and the weather is perfect) needs to decide what to do. On top of all that, Beth has developed a small crush on a boy. At this point we're 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is directed by up-and-coming director Valerie Weiss. Here she brings a tough topic, namely how a mother and daughter must tackle life when mom needs help. ""You know  can't take care of myself"" Mom tells Beth early on. Can you imagine having to deal with that as a 17 or 18 yr. old? The movie is helped immensely by the lead performers, Taryn Manning as the mom and Madison DA=avenport as the daughter. Weiss paces the movie nicely and before you know it, the movie has flashed by. There are tons of great songs throughout the movie, many of them of the female indie-rock variety.

I never heard about this movie until I saw it at my local library the other day. So I basically took a flyer on this, and I'm glad I did. Nothing earth0shattering, but simply a nice 'little' movie about a mother-daughter relationship under some trying circumstances. ""A Light Beneath Their Feet"" is worth checking out!",1473033600,2,1832,4.562310030395137

8759560,5,B01EU4T8CC,"A truly compelling film about the relationship between a frazzled mother, who is addicted to the alcohol drug and other drugs - and her caretaker daughter. Taryn Manning is incredibly believable as the mother and Madison Davenport is the daughter who has given up her life to keep a (practically!) 24-hour watch on her mother. The real challenge for the daughter is deciding to live her OWN life, while realizing that she can never totally abandon her mother, given her love for her. Such is life, sometimes! This is one of the better films of 2016, which I would recommend for ages 15 and over.",1467763200,2,595,4.6761904761904765
