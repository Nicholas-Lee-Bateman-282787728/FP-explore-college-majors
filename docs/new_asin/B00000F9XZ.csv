7907411,3,B00000F9XZ,"Normally I would rate my ""Great Guitars"" albums with a 4 or 5, but this one just doesn't do anything for me. If you're a jazz guitar fan, I recommend ""Straight Tracks"" by the original great guitars. There is a Brazilian tune  called ""Favela"" on it. which is worth the price of the album all by itself. Guess that's it....thanks.",1384387200,,328,4.466666666666667
