2917328,5,B000UAE7BS,This is an excellent movie. Clifton Powell is an excellent actor and deserves an award.  I love his way of presenting the characters that he play.  I give him a 100% rating.,1294790400,,173,4.375
2917329,5,B000UAE7BS,"I Love it Iam a big fan of Clifton Powell, Vivian Foxx and DMX so to have all three in one picture its great",1287014400,,108,3.5416666666666665
2917330,1,B000UAE7BS,"Without a doubt one of the worst movies ever produced!

Looked like it had been filmed using my Backberry Video Camera.  And, ermmm...DMC on the front cover? Why?  He had about a total of 10 lines in 4 appearances! Honestly, if I could I'd get my money back!",1265587200,,258,4.333333333333333
2917331,1,B000UAE7BS,"They said I ordered it by accidentally, probably I did.  But I would have not 'cuz I saw all reviews that said it terrible , so once it came in. I sent it back suddenly. And got my money back",1262908800,,191,3.775
2917332,5,B000UAE7BS,"this movie was excellent!  a real movie, not a play and great actors.. I have seen ""The Bisho"" in a lot of roles but this role did the trick. He was again fabulous.. I saw Vivica Fox in a different light and she pulled it off again.  What a great message with a wonderful story line.. kept my attention all the way thru.. beautiful job, Well done!",1231545600,,347,4.164179104477612
2917333,3,B000UAE7BS,"For a movie that had a very interesting storyline I cannot say that I recommend spending the money to buy it.  It was interesting to examine different personalities at work in the church, to see vulnerabilities and human frailties displayed by those at the ""top"" in ministry, but I honestly couldn't hear what they were saying sometimes because the sound was horrible....it was hissing, too low, or even almost mute!!  It was ridiculous, especially during a key scene when the bishop and Luther Heir were discussing a proposal in Luther's limousine...who was the Einstein that decided to film the scene with the back windows open and the overwhelming sound of the outside traffic/noise??!!  Very frustrating.  I could have at least survived with subtitles, but alas, there were none.

The acting was good, generally, but there were some disconnections in the story....one not-too-loud shot was fired in one part of the building and suddenly the Conference was screaming and scrambling in sheer terror?! And what about all those snake tattoos...there could have been more done with that theme.  There were also some non-creative stereotypes used -- the accountant is a nerdy, argyle-sweater-wearing guy; the film's title character was a Turk, a Muslim (at least assumed) with the name, Luther?? It's hard to not come off as arrogant when the Christians have a Muslim-type as Lucifer in their film.  Not a good choice in my opinion.

As a Christian I enjoy the look at a public, successful leader in ministry that is complex in that he is still proud, yet humble, sober and drunk, confident and cowardly....it just would have been very, VERY nice to actually hear ALL of the dialog.

Definitely rent it ( the scenes with DMX were my favorites ) but don't buy it until they improve the quality of the DVD.",1219017600,5,1802,4.920792079207921
2917334,2,B000UAE7BS,"I was TRULY diasappointed with this movie !!  How can ESTABLISHED actors like Clifton Powell & Vivica Fox align themselves with such a HORRIBLE script ??  I guess it had to be for the money because it's OBVIOUS why this flick didn't make it to the BIG screen !!  Oh well , I gambled & LOST so hopefully you'll take my advice & save YOUR money !!",1213833600,2,345,4.119402985074627
2917335,5,B000UAE7BS,"The movie is very good. I would say that everyone should see. The acting is very good, but it can be a little extreme at times. 5/5",1202428800,5,131,3.888888888888889
2917336,4,B000UAE7BS,"This movies is about how quickly we forget that prayer is the key to your problems NOT money. It gets you to really thinking about your friends. Vivica played a low keyed role then usually, but i was surprise at DMX role. Over all it was good and worth the $13.00 buck @ Sam's Club.",1196121600,12,282,4.1454545454545455

8212439,4,B000UAE7BS,"Great acting, plot and filming.  Left me with a feeling of justice being applied appropriately.  Unknown actors were creditable. I'll share with my friends.",1394323200,,156,5.458333333333333
8212440,5,B000UAE7BS,"This is a very good movie with a great cast! More movies about the church need to be made.. This movie has twist and turns and shows you what goes on behind the church scenes.

The messages in this movie show the truth about everyday church activities. Many ministers go through on a daily bases. Many pastors are cast out of the church. This movie will not disappoint you.

Always pray and keep your eyes on the Lord and not man or money. There are many personalities in the church, and many issues and conflict within the church walls. The church is like a hospital where many souls go for healing, salvation, prayer etc. This movie will touch on many different things. There are many churches going through court currently on many different issues.

There is another great movie called The Undershepherd that is also about the church that we have been looking for on DVD and unable to find.

You will enjoy both movies! Do not listen to the negative reviews, feed your spirit man with good food for thought.

Keep your focus on Christ! Study the word for yourself. Be a light to the world. Focus on the promises and not the problems.

Praise God! Be About Kingdom business!",1364601600,,1176,4.549763033175355
8212441,3,B000UAE7BS,"Didn't really enjoy this movie after viewing it. It wasn't excellent, but it wasn't good either. It was just okay. Judging by the cover, I expected to see DMX with more roles in this film besides being posted up in the church. This was the first and last time I watch that movie.",1301702400,,279,4.283018867924528
8212442,5,B000UAE7BS,"Second rate movie with first rate actors.  I think I know the lead character personally!  The good news is that it has a great ending. If you are a member of the Body of Christ, a megachurch, or the local church around the corner, you may want to check this out!",1297036800,,262,4.117647058823529
