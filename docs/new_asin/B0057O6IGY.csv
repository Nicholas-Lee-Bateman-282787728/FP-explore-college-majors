4597302,5,B0057O6IGY,"I have been faithful in buying each of the seasons as they became available, so no need for the box set of the entire series.  It does upset me though that sometimes (like Renegade) that they come out with the first few seasons and then the box set without making the remaining single seasons available.  Spoiler Alert and the big surprise:  the sixth and final season is called just ""McMillan"" since his wife died in a plane crash.",1318032000,4,432,4.512820512820513
4597303,5,B0057O6IGY,"Universal has announced the entire series of ""McMillan and Wife"", all 6 seasons (although the last didn't feature Susan Saint James) comes to DVD on October 18, 2011 and features all forty 90 minute telefilms as the series was more like a movie-of-the-week that aired on a rotating basis on NBC Sunday nights with ""Columbo"" and ""McCloud"". This was really the last great acting gig Rock Hudson ever did although he would state in later years he hated doing the series because he didn't like the scripts. He and Saint James remained close friends until the day he died in 1985.

 Unfortunately, like the individual box sets there are no bonus features, but the telefilms look impeccable and have been restored to pristine condition.

4597304,5,B0057O6IGY,"Whine Whine Whine - Season One was released in 2005, 7 years later you are complaining that the rest of the series is being released? You should be clapping that the rest of the series is coming out!

This was a great show, Netflix had many of the seasons available to stream for awhile and I enjoyed watching them immensely! I can't wait to get the complete series in my hands. I will donate the Season One set I bought 6 years ago to my local library so that others can enjoy it as much as I did!

Buying from VEI and saving some cash! It ships from Canada, and won't be here in time for Christmas, but for a fifty dollar savings, I'll wait.

Will review sometime after Dec 25th!

Well, it finally came! It's great to watch this classic series again! Starting with Season 3 the Henry Mancini ""NBC Mystery Movie"" theme starts each episode. You remember that, it goes something like Ewww Weeee Ooooooo. There is a guy walking with a flashlight on an ""orange"" cloudy night and he moves it in different directions to reveal different shows like Columbo, McCloud, McMillan and Wife, etc.
I am thoroughly enjoying the series. The video quality varies from episode to episode, but they are all entirely watchable. Season One was quite pristine, but they probably used the masters from the Universal release. It is definitely time to get rid of my Universal S1 ""FLIPPER"" discs.

I got mine directly from VEI in Canada for $99.99 + $2.98 shipping as a gift from Amazon Marketplace, so that is why I am not Amazon verified, I don't see them listed anymore as a vendor, that's too bad. This is a great set, pick it up. The box is cool and you get the Complete Series of ""The Snoop Sisters"" as a bonus.",1309305600,34,1692,4.427652733118971
4597305,1,B0057O6IGY,"I am SOOOOO sick of buying the initial DVD's to get the ball rolling, then have the studio stop producing the DVD's due to poor sales only to have the show farmed out, they release the rest of the series and then they offer a complete series for far less than what you pay for the individual releases. THIS SUCKS AZZ",1309132800,12,316,4.19672131147541
4597306,4,B0057O6IGY,"MacMillan and Wife brought movie heart throb Rock Hudson to the small screen as part of NBC's anthology series NBC Sunday Mystery Movie.  While it was definitely not as successful or good as it more famous counterpart Columbo, it definitely had its pluses.

Joining Rock was Susan St. James in her first true starring role and Nancy Walker as the comic relief maid, Mildred.  Unfortunately, Walker  and St. James after season 5, leaving Rock to solve cases with just his sidekick St. Enright (John Schuck). Walker who left the show and her more sucessful role in Rhoda for the disasterous Blansky's Beauty was replaced by Martha Raye as her sister Agatha. St. John's character was killed off.

Hopefully, this set includes all 40 episodes under the MacMillan and Wife and MacMillan series.  There are 21 discs, so two episodes per disc.  Each of the six seasons consisted of 6 or 7 episodes which is why the Mystery Movie franchise was successful. (Hey NBC maybe try this again and attract some big names!)

As police commisioner Stewart ""MAC"" MacMillan oversaw the most baffling cases in San Francisco.  His plucky wife, Sally, usually found a way to get involved and sometimes their maid Mildred would stick her nose in, usually finding the key clue to unravel the mystery!

Due to the high profile nature of the series, it attracted a bevy of high profile guest stars including Mildred Natwick, Stephanie Powers, Jack Albertson, June Havoc, Dana Wynter, Van Johnson, Susan Strasber and Tab Hunter.  And was a starting point for many young actors including Kim Bassinger and Donna Mills.

Susan St James and Nancy Walker each received 3 Emmy Nominations and Martha Raye received a guest star nomination. Nancy and Susan both also received Golden Globe Nominations.

For fans of 70's detective shows, you will not be sorry that you bought this!",1308873600,9,1845,4.912903225806452

4597323,5,B0057O6IGY,This mini-series is 45 years old and is still fresh.  Susan St. James and Rock (her husband and the police commissioner for San Francisco) play off each other with perfect comedic timing.  Susan is somewhat an updated version of Lucille Ball - headstrong and always getting involved in her husband's police work to help solve the crime.  Rock Hudson is as handsome and charming as ever playing the smooth and brilliant commissioner.  Nancy Walker is the wisecracking but loveable housekeeper Mildred and John Schuck is the devoted and dependable sidekick Sgt. Enright.  Clever plots and beautiful California scenery along with famous guest stars will keep you entertained and trying to guess whodunit.,1516147200,4,701,5.223214285714286

4597330,5,B0057O6IGY,"From 1971 to 1977 there was a series called NBC Mystery Movie that aired once a week.  There were 3 separate shows that made up the NBC Mystery Movie... McMillan & Wife, McCloud, and Columbo.  They would rotate them each week.  One week they'd have an episode of McMillan & Wife, the next week it would be McCloud, then the next week would be Columbo, and so on.  Each episode was about an hour and a half, so they were more like mini-movies.  I loved all 3 of the different shows and watched the Mystery Movie every week.  We already have the entire boxed set of all the Columbo episodes & subsequent movies.  Now I have the McMillan & Wife set.  I can't wait for someone to produce a DVD boxed set of the McCloud series.  They were all great shows.  I definitely recommend them.",1511913600,23,780,4.317241379310345

There were many big name guests stars in each episode.

However, the actual box lists a running time of (you guessed it) 3990 minutes and there's nothing anywhere else on the packaging that suggests the four movies are anything separate from the original series.  There is no mention of them anywhere.  The spine of the first disc says Seasons 1-3 and the spine of the second disc says Seasons 4-6.  There's also no mention of anything extra on the back.

As I don't believe our library has its own copy, I decided to see how much it would cost to buy them for myself. The price, as they say, was right, so I bought it. My mother was the one who, as with Westerns, got me started on this series. Actually, she got me started on Rock Hudson through Doris Day movies. As a kid, I knew every Doris Day movie so well, I could recite them verbatim. So I decided to try watching Rock Hudson with another actress. The chemistry between Hudson and Susan St. James is good--not quite Day-Hudson, but then she wasn't trying to cash in on that Sixties success story. The two, together, in this genre work well. I like their give-and-take. Mildred the housekeeper (Nancy Walker)adds to the chemistry the way Alma the maid (from Pillow Talk) added to that show.

4597476,5,B0057O6IGY,"I loved this series when it first came out so when I rediscovered it on Netflix, I fell in love with it all over again.  This series is one of the few that I can watch over and over again and never get sick of it.  I was so disappointed when Netflix dropped it, I immediately searched for it to purchase.  Well to be honest, I put it on my Christmas list and someone purchased it for me as a gift.  I have already watched the entire series a few times (with the exception of season six titled ""McMillan"" because it is without Sally, Sgt Enright & Mildred).  What a wonderful series this was.

This box set includes the complete series, season 1 - 6 and as a bonus, an additional DVD  titled ""The Snoop Sisters"".  If you are like me and only enjoyed MM&W on Netflix, you will be in for a treat if you buy this set  Why? Because not only does it include the pilot episode ""Once Upon a Dead Man"" (episode was never shown on Netflix), each episode is shown in its entirety.  I never realized that almost every episode on Netflix was edited for time. Sometimes this left some scenes a little disjointed & some dialect seems to come out of left field. Now it all makes sense. For example, the episode ""Husbands, Wives and Killers"" always confused me because it clearly says ""starring Tyne Daly"" in the beginning credits. I'd watched it a dozen times and never could find her.  I even checked IMDB to see if anyone knew the reason, but could find nothing. Only after getting this box set did I discover that she actually is in this episode in a pretty large scene that takes place in a costume shop.  This happens with almost every episode, which is an added bonus.

So if you are a boomer like me, this series will take you back. Sure, some of it is corny and a little dated, but the on-screen chemistry between Saint James & Hudson is pure magic. And Sgt Enright and housekeeper Mildred are just as lovable as ever. I even enjoy the 70s cars and fashion.  Sally's outfits were a dream.  One more fun bonus is each season starts by playing the NBC Mystery Movie theme song & incls that memorable intro of the walking mystery man with flashlight.  All in all, this boxed set is pure nostalgic gold.",1457654400,5,2191,4.320293398533007

4597478,4,B0057O6IGY,"The plots are a little slow, but they are funny in about five different ways and so cleverly written that it really is a shocker what happened. I like that sally wears a football jersey to bed and can solve mysteries,get anyone to talk to her , but cannot make toast. Everybody in the show plays off each other really well and adds their best to make you not want to change the channel even though it is on really late at night. It's at it's best when Mildred dances the tango or mac and sally have double entendre' conversations while laying in bed . But don't watch the last season,everyone pretty much quit. And it's just a run down looking Rock Hudson and Mildred's VERY ANNOYING sister solving mysteries together.",1457136000,4,718,4.488549618320611

4597484,3,B0057O6IGY,"This series starred Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James as the couple of the title. Also on the show was Nancy Walker who played their alcohol loving maid Mildred and John Schuck as the dim- witted Sgt Enright.
 A rotating movie mystery of shows which ran with McCloud, and Columbo. There were other series but these three were the most popular. I can only think that this show was so popular because of the strength of having Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James on the show.
I had not seen this series since it first aired when I was between 9 and 15 years old. I remember it being quite good back then but seeing it again it does not live up to my memories of it. Simply because the series seems corny instead of funny and some of the scripts are hard to swallow. I had not realised that Sally McMillan (Susan Saint James) was so kooky.
This show has a Jekyll and Hyde element to it. In the fact that the mysteries can be gripping but then is spoilt by it's comedy elements. I suspect it was corny even back in the 1970's. For example, one night Sally sees a man looking up at the house from her bedroom window. She tells Mac (Rock Hudson) but he sees no one. Dog- tired he gets back into bed and Sally places her night shades over his eyes. She then hears a noise outside the house and alerts Mac who sits up in bed and says "" I  don't know but I think I've gone blind"" at which point see takes the night shades off of his eyes.
Another example it when Sally is stuffed into a steel drum and tossed into the river. Mac jumps in and swims up to the container shouting out to her if she is alright. She asks ""Where am I"". To which he replies she is in a container labelled for Istanbul. She says "" I can't go to Istanbul. I'm not dressed for Istanbul""
Even the solving of some of  the mysteries is questionable. One episode has them at a Scottish castle visiting Mac's uncle. Unfortunately he has been murdered while the door is locked from the inside and the only witness is the dog who was in the room. Mac notices that the dog barks at anyone carrying a fishing rod and reel. Just by this, he figures out that the reel was attached to the gun hanging on the wall in the room where his uncle was murdered. The murderer was in the room up above and tugged on the rod which pulled the reel which ran down the outside wall and through the window into the room where the uncle was. But in order to know when the uncle would be standing near the window the murderer had to have an accomplice  who would signal him from the lawn when to tug on the rod.
Another episode has Sally being kidnapped. After her kidnappers has let her talk to Mac,he asks her if she is alright. She says that she has not been this nervous since the time he asked her to marry him. After two hours of running around San Francisco he figures that Sally was trying to give him a clue when she mentioned about the marriage proposals. In flashback he remembers that they were eating bagels and Lox when he first asked the question. The second time they were eating caviar and the third time they were eating a Tuna fish sandwich. All of a sudden he shouts to Sgt Enright, his assistant, ""That's it Sgt. It's Fish. She can smell fish. She's on a boat. Quick Sgt,call the Harbor Master.
Me thinks that Mildred isn't the only one who liked to knock back the alcohol. It seems the scriptwriters liked to as well.
Things seemed to have improved after season three and the next three seasons were better script wise. Season six, the final season, now called ""McMillan"", because Susan Saint James had left the show. Either to pursue her movie career or over a contract dispute. The script writers came up with the idea that Sally had died in a plane crash. Nancy Walker had left as well as she had been given her own show. Now she was genuinely funny and a plus to the show. At the same time as doing this show she was on another series called ""Rhoda"" playing the mother.
 I never really liked Sgt Enright when I was a kid and nothing has changed.
But the biggest mystery of all was what happened to the two pregnancies that Sally had. At the end of season One she was pregnant. When season Two started there was no mention of the pregnancy. Did she mis-carry? Then, throughout Season Four, she is pregnant again even giving birth to a boy at the end of season four. But you never see the baby. In Season Five, there is no sight or mention about the baby. Did the child die?
I think I might have solved the mystery. Since Sally was so kooky, it was phantom pregnancies and that she was only over-eating. Of course, they had all seen the second baby so I think that it was all an hallucination and they were all Puffing on the Magic Dragon. Hey, if the scriptwriters can come up with lame stories, so can I.
Although the show is not as good as I remembered it. After watching all the episodes I still kind of like the show
Also as a bonus there is the complete series of ""The Snoop Sisters"" about two octogenarian ladies who solve murders. There were only five episodes made as this was not as popular as the other mystery series.",1454976000,4,5087,4.245614035087719

4597500,3,B0057O6IGY,"Three stars, for me, means ""so, so.""
According to the current posting on the City and County of San Francisco Police Department website, the San Francisco Police Commission has seven members, all appointed by the mayor and the Board of Supervisors, whose mission is to "",,,set policy...conduct disciplinary hearings...impose discipline...and hear police officer appeals.""  They ""...oversee the Police Department and Office of Citizen Complaints.""  And, some other routine stuff, like have meetings every Wednesday.  Nowhere in the description of duties broad and sundry is mentioned assuming the role of doing actual police work, such as chasing perpetrators, investigating crimes and criminals, playing detective, or allowing spouses of said commissioners to insinuate themselves into official city business activities.
Based upon that discovery, ""Macmillan and Wife"" seems a pretty implausible collection of fantastical, ill-conceived and poorly written episodes of what seems like copycat tales of crime, murder and mayhem in and around one of America's most notoriously recognizable backdrop cities.
  The writers, directors and producers make a seemingly over-emphasized big deal of the protagonist, Commissioner McMillan, played competently and low-key by Rock Hudson, engaging in several domestically intimate encounters with his hippyish, clothes-horsely fashionable way junior wife, played by his way junior co-actor, Susan Saint James, with a constant stream of former girlfriends and lady admirers to, what(?), insinuate that the character is a hunk, straight participant in the social playground of the city, yessir, while chasing villains and bringing order to the community.  Even the music is overbearing.  The best part of this series is the computerized intro, where the undefined seeker comes at the audience with a probing flashlight.
  By the time Susan Saint James and Nancy Walker had left the series, leaving only Martha Rae behind to attend to the dusting, food  prep and wisecracks, we had also had enough.  But, we did stay to the last moment of the last installment in the final season.  It's like going to a restaurant and, even though the portions are way too much, eating every last bite on the plate ""because I paid for it.""  Did I mention that, once again, the music was too loud?",1446163200,,2312,5.47887323943662

And what made this series for its time so GREAT was 1 the right  actors were cast in this series (you won't believe who were ALMOST cast in the Mac and Sally roles BEFORE Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James) 2 The series had FANTASTIC behind the scenes script writers and 3 the guest actors that did this series were wonderful and well chosen. This series was just GREAT for its time. And the fact that Rock Hudson chose to do this series in the format that Mcmillan & Wife was shown in as part of the N.B.C. mystery movie wheel was a PLUS for Rock Hudson along with being paired with Susan Saint James which was an added extra bonus for him and us the audience.",1444003200,4,852,4.1017964071856285

4597512,5,B0057O6IGY,A great show that takes me back to my teen years.  So nice to see an adult couple who are loving but no smut included....I was sad when I reached the last episode.(especially when Sally was gone),1436140800,,195,4.27027027027027
4597513,3,B0057O6IGY,"The first couple of seasons were mildly entertaining. I'm sure some would read that as ""not entertaining""; however, I mean that they were entertaining just not ""wow that was great let's watch it again"". While the earlier seasons has some plots that kept you watching the shows were 90 minutes long. Way too long for me. And they seemed to included a lot of random unnecessary stuff that just bored me. Anyway the later seasons/shows were just not that good.

Some of the things that bothered me about this show were the typical cheap 1970s/1980s TV action scenes. There were two different episodes with the exact same car chase scene. The exact same scene. Same people walking along the streets during the chase. Same police car. Same car being chased. It was a recycled scene.

The shows started out with MacMillan literally running down some bad guy, swing a couple of punches, and the rest of the cops catching up to lock up the bad guy. In these scenes the bad guy literally fell before Rock Hudson swung. No joke. It was laugh out loud sloppy.

Then of course you had Rock Hudson's character being this reformed womanizer who was still popular with the ladies after he had settled down with Sally. And to reinforce that characterization Sally and Mac were always kissing on the mouth. And given what we know about Rock Hudson now, after the fact, I just cringed every time that happened. And I also felt lied to . . . cheated. I felt like I was played big time. Mocked even.

But I will say that the earlier episodes had an almost unrecognizable Hudson playing this character quite well. He had big Elvis sideburns. Had some weight on him. Had a mustache. He looked like the part. But later he slimmed down, shaved off the mustache and was more ""Hudson"" than ""Macmillan"" I felt. Kinda lost its charm by then anyway. I mean how many times can Sally be kidnapped as the plot before it gets old.

The maid was annoying. I read where she was a popular character. I have no idea why. She was lazy. A drunk. Rude. Insensitive. And sometimes her rudeness, laziness let to people meeting their early demise. But they never pointed that out. She was just supposed to be funny. She wasn't to me. Annoying is more like it.

Also there was even an episode where Sally was pregnant. Never saw the kid. Never heard of the birth. Nothing.

But to end on a high note the show did give you another take on San Franciso in the 70s in two ways: 1) you saw it before the yuppy rich took over as it is now  where ordinary joes lived and there were bad and good parts to it and 2) you saw the glamorous parts of that era outside the orange shag carpet and lime green kitchens of Archie Bunker.",1435449600,,2676,4.435845213849287

4597571,5,B0057O6IGY,"For those of you who have not seen Macmillan and Wife you're missing a real treat. This show was on about a million years ago with a movie star idol - Rock Hudson--at the time the handsomest man alive. Unfortunately Mr. Hudson died of Aids years ago and we lost an icon; this show shows you why!
The premise of the show is that 'Rock' is a 'top cop' and want it or not his wife (Susan St James) manages to entail herself in each story and become 'super cop's super detective' whether he likes it or not.
I adored this show and always loved all his movies but Rock was a real treat to behold in this show as was his sidekick and a trusty housekeeper (neither of which you would recognize if you aren't as old as me (LOL).
I do feel a bit cheated because the very last season Susan disappeared from the show with a one line explanation about a plane crash. This is the fifth series where one of the major stars just goes off into the sunset and I was not happy about that at all.
It is a cop show, it is a mystery show, it is a comedy romance show and a comedy/drama romance show and all of those mixed up in one big terrific series I couldn't stop watching--I laughed, I cried and I laughed some more. Every single show was a winner and though I paid a pretty hefty penny for this series it was well worth it for I know I'll go back  and watch it again; yep, it's that good!!!!!!!!!

Case one contains Seasons 1-3 and case two contains Seasons 4-6.  The seasons are stacked on top of one another, and one has to be extremely careful when removing the discs from the cases so as not to damage them.
