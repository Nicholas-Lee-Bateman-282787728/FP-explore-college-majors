1092099,1,6305885141,"I purchased this after seeing Iron Monkey on the big screen this weekend. I coerced my martial arts resistant wife to watch it as well (she loved the first Iron Monkey).
Awful. There is no other word for this pseudo sequel. The story is uncompelling (and virtually unrelated to the first film); the fight scenes don't hold a candle to the original; the production values are bargain basement.
And the pan-and-scan! It's impossible to tell what's going on! I refuse to watch another martial arts movie in pan-and-scan: its letterbox for me for now on.
It's sad to think that some people will be lead to this film after discovering the original at the multiplex.",1003104000,3,660,4.747826086956522
1092100,2,6305885141,"The first Iron Monkey is a classic, sometimes cited as the best fight
choreography ever done by Yuen Wo Ping.  I'd recommend skipping a
rental and just buying it.  Iron Monkey 2, however, barely merits a
rental -- and even then only if you have a high tolerance for stupid
villains, a paper-thin plot, and execrable dubbing.
I give it two
stars only because I still like Donnie Yen, some of the characters are
potentially interesting (in an unfulfilled sort of way), and the fight
choreography is decent enough to grab your attention (though perhap
not to sustain it through the less action-filled -- and more
actionable -- stretches).
To say that this film has only a tenuous
connection to the original Iron Monkey is rather generous.  (The back
of the video box charts new linguistic territory by describing it as a
""semi-sequel."") It takes place about a hundred years after
the first movie, apparently during the Japanese occupation of China
(but with what appear to be modern handguns); Donnie Yen is in both
movies, though playing different characters, and a hero called Iron
Monkey obviously has a central role in both.  Also like the first
movie, the Good Guys seem to be fighting against corrupt officials,
but character motivation is not this film's specialty; character
origins and motivations are murky at best, absent at worst.
I won't
even attempt to enumerate the script problems.  Some of them may
actually be due to the poor dubbing, but that can't excuse the entire
plot; still, if plot's important to you then you won't be watching
this in the first place.  Suffice to say that things don't work out as
you expect, and even the finale has no
significance outside of the choreography.
But as for the
choreography . . . well, the wire work is decent.  Some of the scenes
are even engaging, especially the first fight between the two heroes.
There's nothing groundbreaking, like the fight on the townspeople's
shoulders in Fong Sai Yuk or the fight on the poles in the first Iron
Monkey, but the fight scenes are reasonably diverting.  Aside from the
lack of anything new here, my largest complaint would be that neither
the heroes nor the villains had anything interesting or unusual in
their gong fu repertoires.
If you're interested in the breadth of HK
cinema and/or in Yuen Wo Ping's filmography, Iron Monkey 2 isn't a
*total* waste of time; it's just a *relative* waste of time,
considering the finitude of a human life.",991440000,10,2441,4.795238095238095
1092101,4,6305885141,"This somewhat ""sequel"" to the 1993 ""original,"" not to be confused with the more classic 1977 Chen Kwan Tai ""original"" of the same name, is less majestic, less enthralling, and of much smaller production value than the original 1993 offering.  The look and feel of the movie, in fact, make you feel the movie was made BEFORE the original.  There are numerous intense, very good fight sequences throughout, though the plot flounders and is choppy in the middle reels.  More ""classic"" and less ""wired"" than the orginal, the movie contains some distracting elements, such as modern backdrops (a nightclub?...with showgirls?...and patrons in tuxedos?) and WAY TOO MUCH gun-play (handguns and the like) for the kung-fu purist (do we allow ANY?). If you liked the 1993 original, you will most certainly appreciate this second offering (but also treat yourself to the 1977 classic!)",970012800,10,874,5.140845070422535
1092102,5,6305885141,"In the spirit of the first, Iron Monkey 2 blazes onto your home  entertainment system!  The martial arts are incredible, giving you the ever  stunning fight scenes that leave you with your mouth wide open.  If you  haven't seen an Iron Monkey flick yet, I demand that you get this and share  it with your friends, you won't regret it!!!",965606400,4,336,4.516666666666667
1092103,3,6305885141,"I hope I can recall all the plots uncovered in this movie.  Let me see there was a traveling troupe bent on assasinating a crime boss.............a couple of street urchins trying to get themselves off  the streets with a couple hustles.........a country boy looking for his  father in the city..........the crime boss trying to scheme a gun running  operation.........a woman offering bounty to any hitman to take a  job...........and then there is Iron Monkey-the Robin Hood type- who  supposedly gives to the poor.  Believe it or not this is one movie and is  typical of the Hong Kong Genre.
This is not Yuen Woo Ping's best work but  I believe it works because of Donnie Yen who in my opinion is up there in  on screen fighting fireworks with the likes of Jet Li and Jackie Chan.  Hopefully in the near future Donnie is given the opportunity to showcase  more of his talents in the U.S.  Word is he will be given this chance in  the new movie of the HIGHLANDER series.
The other highlight in this movie  was the actor who portrayed the son looking for his father--he had  incredible martial arts skills in his own right.  And his fight with Iron  Monkey was arguably one of the better ones in the film.",964224000,3,1206,4.55607476635514
1092264,1,6305885141,"This really is poor. Donnie Yen is an incredible martial artist. Billy Chow has chops too. But the film sucks. The stars are wasted. Dreadful story - usually to be expected as it's Hong Kong Cinema - but where's the thrilling choreography that makes up for the limits of a HK story? Further, my copy was faulty, (it skipped) which only added to the grief. There are a couple of decent moves, not fights, just moves, but, really, give this one a miss.",1154995200,,450,4.433734939759036

Just wanting to know who did what, and who is involved in what,,it 's an amazing story to follow, not complicated,,it just griped my imagination!!  This is a really good old school kung fu movie, truly and really entertaining!!",1149465600,2,472,4.85
1092266,1,6305885141,I felt so sorry for Mr. Yen being in this so called sequel. Please don't judge this movie in the same light of the original. If you do. You will be greatly disappointed.,1087257600,6,169,4.151515151515151
1092267,2,6305885141,"Pretty standard low-budget HK actioner. The production quality is no where near the Quentin Tarantino presentation of ""Iron Monkey."" Feels like they took an old movie and repacked it for IM fans. Yuen Wo Ping is credited with the fight direction which is good. Acting directing is poor to mediocre at best... It is good to see more of Donny Yen, but I'd like to see more of him in some higher quality films, like a CTHD follow-up, Matrix-style or Jet Li film.",1050364800,5,459,4.542168674698795

Donnie Yen is good, the action and fighting sequences are good, Yuen Wo Ping did design the fights. But the filming, editing, and overall quality are mediocre (fans expect this sort of low budget quality in most HK action films). I really believe this is Tai Seng's attempt to cash in on the popularity of Iron Monkey. Frankly, they've done a poor job, as any serious fan will detect absolutely no connection to that story and this.",1024704000,10,544,4.505050505050505
1092269,1,6305885141,"Want proof that this isn't a true sequel: Even Iron Monkey himself never dresses like he did in the first film.  Before he always had half his face covered, but now he does most his fighting in leisure suits with everyone seeing his face. Even the original music is absent, instead we get a musical score from the movie ""True Lies"" (I know, I own the soundtrack) during the action scenes, repeating the same string in one of the music tracks over and over (almost in every fight--at least at 5 different times!). In fact, besides dubbing in the use of the name ""Iron Monkey"" every once and a while, this is basically an older Donnie Yen movie re-released with the ""Iron Monkey 2"" label. Somebody tried way to hard to market in on the ""Iron Monkey"" name, and it shows quite badly.
The only thing that made me keep watching was the frequent appearance of astonishing hyper-kinetic fight scenes choreographed by Yuen Ho-Ping, not the endlessly inventive Yuen Woo-Ping (as Amazon.com states), who came to fame as the fight choreographer of ""The Matrix."" Many people think that Woo-Ping did the fight choreography in this one... but he didn't. Those that have seen many of his other movies will notice the fight scenes lack a certain charisma that only Woo-Ping can deliver. Still, the curious thing is that, after a while, this choppy movie starts to lurch into a good-old kung fu spectacle. Iron Monkey 2 grows strangely compelling. It's as if, through directorial incompetence, the movie has been distilled to the basic elements of cinematic storytelling.
This is not Yuen Woo-Ping's work, but I believe you may find it worth it because of Donnie Yen, who many believe is up there in on screen-fighting-fireworks with the likes of Jet Li and Jackie Chan. The other highlight in this movie was the actor who portrayed the son looking for his father --he had incredible martial arts skills in his own right. His fight with Donnie Yen was arguably one of the better ones in the film. The one bad thing was that we get more fighting from this looking-for-father guy than Donnie Yen himself. He's not a bad fighter, but I bought the movie looking for most of the fights with the Iron Monkey himself involved.
By itself, you have some good fighting with some really bad dubbing and a reused music track from the movie ""True Lies."" But when you slap the name of the sequel to one of Yuen Woo-Ping's best work to it, too many comparisons will be made.",1024358400,19,2441,4.650462962962963
1092270,2,6305885141,"So I'm out hunting for some new martial arts DVD's.  I'm just about done and I come across Iron Monkey 2 ... I didn't even know they had an Iron Monkey 2.  A quick review of the back cover reveals that this is a ""semi-sequel"" to the original.  Uh, okay.  I pop the movie in.  There is no screen set-up or anything.  What you see is what you get.  The movie looks like an early 80's kung fu movie.  Nothing like the stylish first.  Yes, the movie is laughable and there is no real plot.  I still enjoyed the movie.  I took it for what it was...a kung fu movie.  The only reason I rate it so low is because I'm comparing it to the first.",1019952000,5,635,3.9523809523809526
1092271,2,6305885141,"The only reason why I bought this dvd is because well, one i loved the first iron monkey and second i'm a fan of Donnie Yen.  I was really excited to watch it until I watched the beginning which was pretty corny.  After that, my expectations of it just started falling from there.  Although Donnie Yen is featured in this movie, he plays somewhat of a supporting role which is kind of disappointing.  The dubbing is bad and so is the acting.  The storyline isn't that great either compared to the first.  If you can stand through all this you will be rewarded with a pretty well choreagraphed fight scene in the end.  But I warn you.. this fight scene is not worth the price of the dvd.
If you are a die hard kung fu or Donnie Yen fan I suggest that you watch this movie first before you see the first iron monkey (If you haven't already).  Don't worry, the plot and storyline aren't interrelated and you wouldn't miss much.  That way your expectations of this movie won't be as high.  So should you buy this dvd?  well if you are a fan of Donnie Yen and like to collect all his dvds then you should. Just know that this is not one of his best.  For anybody else this is more of a movie that you should rent not buy.",1018224000,3,1216,4.171673819742489
1092272,1,6305885141,"I should have read the reviews before I made a purchase of this DVD. I was totally discussed with this movie. I couldn't agree more with all the comments of the other reviewers, but my impulse got the best of me. I was just browsing in the store and I saw ""Iron Monkey 2"" with Donnie Yen. I had to buy it. What a mistake. Usually, the kung-fu movie plots are not so great, but this one was really terrible. I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be a comedy or an action film. The DVD version of this film was the worst I've seen. It was like sitting in the front row in the theater with binoculars. I couldn't follow and see the details of the fight scenes. As far as I'm concern, the lead actor could have been David Carradine and it would have made no difference.
I've learned my lesson. I will read reviews before making any purchases of DVDs and not judge a movie by its cover.",1011398400,,878,4.1104651162790695
1092273,1,6305885141,"LOL
I bought this DVD thinking it was gonna be as AWSOME as the first Iron Monkey.  The box art looked professional, and the information about the movie on the back sounded fantistic.  However, I played the DVD and found that it is probably one of the worst Kung Fu movies EVER (Trust me Ive seen a lot of bad ones, but at least they were worth of being watched).
The cast is not exactly the same from the first movie.  The story is about some bad guys that purchase GUNS that look like shotgun laser pistols from Star Wars.  Apparently they think they can rule the world or something...
Fighting is OK.  The big problem is trying to follow all their movements.  They have the problem of switching camera angles ever three seconds.  As far as dubbing goes... its just plain awful.
Overall, get the movie if you are REALLY bored and want a few good laughs.  And If you happen to see this DVD first, please do not think the first one is just as bad, because it far from it.  GET IRON MONKEY ONE FOR THE REAL DEAL!!!!!!!",1010102400,,1017,4.282722513089006
