3691844,5,B001LXIDSG,"I bought this video for my grandson who is 3 and who simply loves Thomas the tank engine and just loves Trains in general. The animated thomas video, Railway friends is Great!!!!
its so nice to see the people move and talk and the train faces have expressions. He loves it. he loves the animation. we have to watch it everyday. I highly recomend this dvd for that thomas fan in your home!",1238025600,3,388,4.328767123287672

3691846,4,B001LXIDSG,"How cute this is! Thomas and all the other trains actually talking! My son was absolutely nuts, but here is a problem that I need to warn all of the parents. The Thomas & Friends DVD's have several stories which is what my son expected (he is 5 y. 0.)  This is just ONE story and the bonus story has nothing to do with Thomas, but a race car. My son had the biggest tantrum because he couldn't understand why was it only one story and the bonus story was about a car! So do not expect a bunch of little Thomas & Friends stories like the other DVD's. It's one story.",1236556800,14,565,4.044642857142857
3691847,5,B001LXIDSG,"My son talked about wanting ""Thomas Talks"" for about a week nonstop before I finally figured out what he was begging me to buy him! This video is different from all the other Thomas videos because of the animation, the trains mouths actually move when they are ""talking"". My son watches this video almost every single night at bed time ( 30 min tv time ). HE LOVES IT~",1236211200,3,368,4.3478260869565215

I enjoy them as well, and plan on expanding our Thomas and Friends library. I'm not going to ""review"" the show or this compilation, but I *will* say that the writers certainly have a communist leaning. Lol",1403481600,,347,4.523809523809524

3691891,2,B001LXIDSG,"The release date on this dvd was 2009, so I expected the graphics to be much more up-to-date. It's evident that this movie was created  much earlier than 2009, and does not hold my child's attention like the modern version.",1392336000,,223,4.575

3691894,4,B001LXIDSG,"Great ""newer"" versions of Thomas and his friends!  My 2 year old son is really into Thomas right now, and this one is fun to watch for him, especially because the characters talk and aren't just narrated.",1375056000,,204,4.513513513513513

3691908,4,B001LXIDSG,My 3 year old really enjoyed this Thomas title. As a parent I really enjoyed the values that were taught in this program.,1368921600,,121,4.304347826086956
3691909,5,B001LXIDSG,My kid loves these fun filled videos. They are full of adventure and mischief that the trains get into.this video is for the toddler train lover in your life.,1368748800,,158,4.482758620689655
3691910,1,B001LXIDSG,"Premise: A show where trains interact with humans, are constantly worried about being sent to the scrap yard, and are filmed reality-TV-style on an island where an abysmal safety record has apparently still not produced any regulations to cut down the 50 crashes a day.

Annoyance level (1-10): I give this one a 5, as there simply has to be a limit on the amount of old abandoned mines that one island can have. I would also like a better explanation of how the town of Great Waterford could actually become lost (""the maps were lost""? - spare me Sir Thopham...) and then re-discovered a mere 10 years later. What is the life expectancy on Sodor?!?

Educational content/value: This program teaches the value of keeping the boss man happy, under the constant threat of the scrap yards. However, Thomas is no Wesley, and Sir Thopham Hatt is no Dread Pirate Roberts...

Questionable content that makes me wonder: Why are accidents the main source of plot lines in this series? Why not a season of Thomas trying to find and then reunite with his real father? It would make it much more gripping television to watch.

If I were a script writer: First, I would make Rosie much less of a tease. Second, I would cure James of his vanity by making him work at the quarry for 6 months under threat of shipping him to North Korea. Finally, I would create an ""and then there was one"" episode, where one train a scene met a grisly fate (starting with Sir Handel, that's for sure...) until the real killer was unveiled (Harold the helicopter). Perhaps this would be appropriate for a Thomas and Friends halloween episode?",1363910400,2,1608,4.631578947368421
3691911,5,B001LXIDSG,"This and many other of Thomas & Friends movies as well as books have been so enjoyable to watch with my grandson.  It is not only cute and filled with adventure, but educational as well. Not only do children learn about friendship, helping, empathy and sharing, but they also helps them increase their vocabulary and learn to be creative.  My grandson is only 2 1/2 years old and these movies have taught him so much.  I like watching this and discussing it with him.  Family and friends know he loves Thomas & Friends, so he gets lots of related books, has an extensive collection of the trains and railways.  He knows all the trains by name, number and color.  His parents and I have been reading to him and now he is starting to read.  We also have many of the activity books, which are all fabulous!
I recommend this to parents, grandparents, & babysitters.  These movies are a great learning tool and very enjoyable too!",1363392000,,925,4.530120481927711
3691912,5,B001LXIDSG,This is a great quality movie. Both my daughter and son enjoyed this. If you want to keep the kids distracted for a while this is a good video to watch.,1362096000,,152,3.935483870967742
3691913,4,B001LXIDSG,"My grandson loves watching this.  He is only 17 months old, so having a bunch of little movies instead of one long one helps him in holding his attention.",1362009600,,154,4.310344827586207
3691914,5,B001LXIDSG,Fly to Atlanta from Indiana with my 2-1/2 year old grandson.  We watched Thomas over and over.  He really enjoyed it and the trip went by quickly.,1361923200,,146,4.37037037037037
3691915,5,B001LXIDSG,My sons love Thomas.  Thanks for having such a great selection of children's shows available.  Keep up the good work!,1360627200,,117,4.8
3691916,5,B001LXIDSG,I think all the Thomas videos are great for kids.  I'd much rather have my child watching this than most of the programs available for kids.,1360627200,,140,4.384615384615385
3691917,5,B001LXIDSG,"Thomas and Friends is another of my grandson's favorite shows.  He is almost two and when he comes over the first thing he asks for is ""Thomas"".  Love it!",1360454400,,154,4.275862068965517
3691918,5,B001LXIDSG,My son loves Thomnas Trains and these DVDs are priced well. Received on time and continue to order many others. Great product and he enjoys them over and over.,1353974400,,159,4.517241379310345
3691919,3,B001LXIDSG,"Typical Thomas video but before you get a chance to watch it, you'll have to endure ten (10!) lengthy promos as well as a copyright screen AND two separate opens for both Lionsgate and HiT Entertainment. After all this garbage, you arrive at a screen that offers you the option for (finally) playing the video via HiT Entertainment's ""enhanced"" Autoplay feature (for your conveinence.)

Its obvious that these discs are ""enhanced"" only to make you buy more product. It's a shame that little kids have to wait to see Thomas while this company engages in the hard sell with us parents. Shame on HiT and Lionsgate!",1298851200,,611,4.764150943396227
3691920,5,B001LXIDSG,"My 5 year old son, my 4 year old niece, and my 2 year old niece all love this movie. They are all wild about Thomas, but this is especially liked because Thomas is animated. He is more realistic in that he moves and talks, his eyes and everything are more lifelike and this makes him seem alive.",1263168000,,295,4.103448275862069
3691921,4,B001LXIDSG,"We love the new annimated Thomas series! It gives the characters a more natural feel! All the trains, conductors and even Sir Topom Hat all talk! Much more entertaing! My one year old just loves this too! Old and New fans will love the change. Highly Recommend.",1252627200,2,261,4.574468085106383
3691922,5,B001LXIDSG,My son and I are new to Thomas and I am so glad that they have made the jump to CGI.  I think this has helped my 2 1/2 year old to understand the story line with more interest.  The stories are wonderful teaching tools.  We also love the bonus of Rory the Racing Car.  We watch this DVD over and over again and it hasn't gotten old yet.,1252022400,,336,3.8260869565217392
3691923,2,B001LXIDSG,Sure I should have know that this Thomas DVD would have an American narration but gone are the opening titles with each episode and so too is the song at the end. The new animated faces are good but it's a so so release for me,1250985600,,226,3.9347826086956523
3691924,1,B001LXIDSG,"My sixteen month old son loves Thomas & Friends. This new ""improved"" version is fully computer generated. As soon as he saw their mouths moving he FREAKED OUT and cried until I turned the DVD off. I don't recommend buying these newer DVD's for smaller children. It may be cool for older kids but it's frightening for youngsters who are used to the classic Thomas series. It's a shame they had to ruin it.",1240790400,13,404,4.472972972972973
