1655544,2,B00005RIXO,"Perhaps no production of La Fille could make me enjoy the shallow music. Please don't get me wrong. I love bel canto and I have enjoyed many evenings of Donizetti, but this opera is just too bumptious for me. The genesis of the bouncy Broadway musical is too apparent. So I admit I'm prejudiced. However, THIS production seems gratuitously silly. Every chance to make the music sound oompah corny is exploited. There are more than a few tuning problems spread generously among the singers, and voice timbres are harsh throughout, more bellow canto than bel canto. Reading the other amazon reviews, I find myself agreeing with most of the faults noted and few of the virtues.
To offer something positive: if you want to see and hear a successful comic opera in the bel canto style, you might choose Rossini's ""Le Comte Ory"", which is available on DVD. Silliness can be delightful when the music isn't sacrificed.",1163548800,4,911,4.808917197452229
1655545,4,B00005RIXO,"This live performance of La fille du rgiment was made roughly 15 years after Sutherland's celebrated commercial recording of the opera with Pavarotti.  She was just short of 60 years old at the time of this performance and was at the time enjoying a sort of renaissance of renewed strength and vigor in her voice.  I saw her in four performances of Anna Bolena in Houston just two months prior to this Fille, and in a challenging concert in Dallas about six months after, and noted that she sounded magnificent each time I saw her.  Here, she is in good representative form for the period.
Even though Sutherland was best known for the many heroines, most of them loony, that she portrayed in the serious operas of the bel canto era, her true mtier was comedy.  Her sense of timing was flawless.  At Marie's entrance Sutherland appears to do several drum rolls and then one time the offstage drummer does a roll that she ""accidentally"" fails to follow, with a delightful reaction on her part; she returns to this joke once more during her entrance aria that follows.  The second act includes a long comic tour de force as Sutherland, playing a canteen girl brought against her will into high society, is forced to rehearse a rather long-winded and stuffy song her ""aunt"" (actually her mother trying to cover up Marie's illegitimate birth) wants her to perform.  For me the highlight of her visual performance involves one of the oldest gags in the book, a scene where she follows her aunt around mimicking her gestures; each time the poor aunt turns around Marie adopts a pose facing the audience that belies the fact that she has been making fun of her.  She is so natural and so delightful in this scene that she had me rolling on the floor with laughter.
But what about vocally? you ask.  How does she measure up?  Well, I'll start with the bad stuff, what little of it there is:  Sutherland simplifies the music only very slightly from her celebrated recording from 15 years earlier (a high note omitted here, a long note cut short there), and her imitation of a bugle call near the beginning of the opera contains a few (and I mean few) notes that are a bit flat, a flaw she corrects by the end of that call.  Other than that, she is in very good voice, with even the famous Sutherland trill still very much in place.  Perhaps I might be expected to say at this point that ""she is in very good voice for an almost-60-year-old woman,"" and as it turns out no apologies are necessary.  Sopranos half her age might well have cause to be envious.  We were very fortunate to have Sutherland for as long as we did; when will her like come along again?  And while it is true that most of the men in the chorus who played her many loving regimental ""fathers"" do appear to be half Sutherland's age or younger, this was probably less evident in actual performance than on television.  Still the television director, not wanting to push his luck, uses few true close-ups.  Bottom line is that the audience truly loves her, and who can blame them?
The rest of the cast does not let the side down either.  Veteran Heather Begg, looking and sounding older than she probably actually was (check her out in the Adriana Lecouvreur video made two years later to get a better idea of her actual age), is appropriately snooty and stuffy.  She also shows herself to be a good comic actress as well, particularly in the aforementioned rehearsal scene.  Anson Austin, Sutherland's partner in a number of these Australian videos, sings well enough.  He does sound a bit raw in a few of the nine high C's in his big aria, although he recovers in time to do a good and long-held final one.  Gregory Yurisich as Sergeant Sulpice is nowhere near as crusty as I might expect an old sergeant to be; still he was fun to watch and very much into the piece.  Richard Bonynge's conducting is buoyant and very supportive of the singers.
Production values could have been a bit better.  All we get is the opera with no special features.  Picture and sound are good, although it would have been nice to at least be able to turn the subtitles on and off, something that is possibly not Kultur's fault.  Anyway, the lack of special features is the only reason I gave the DVD four stars instead of five.
This is easily the best of the Sutherland videos that I have seen, even if I still regret that nobody took the time to videotape her Semiramide or Esclarmonde.  Highly recommended for those who want to spend a couple of hours enjoying one of the more fun comic operas, and even more highly recommended for Sutherland fans.",1086652800,13,4590,4.530909090909091
1655546,3,B00005RIXO,"I had watched my VHS tape for years and enjoyed the staging of this comic opera. I ordered the DVD when it came out, and boy, did I regret it! The DVD production is horrible! It came at the usual poor Kultur DVD production level (no extra features, DD2.0 sound, no subtitle selection, etc.) That's fine, I can live with that. But the video quality is so poor, you can literally see the screen as a bunch of small pixels! I don't know what kind of video compression technique was used for the DVD production, but it is about as poor (if not poorer) than a VCD (MPEG1) quality. And the compression is so bad that some times you watch the action in slow motion!
Regarding the opera production, it is a real delight! Joan may not have all her power and high notes in her prime, but she showed us what a brilliant actress she is. The orchestra played real well under Richard's conducting. The tenor is no Pavarotti, but is quite acceptable.
I just hope that Kultur can start improving their DVD production quality. Otherwise, so many great performing archives that Kultur owns the release right will be ruined.",1027900800,20,1105,4.502487562189055
1655547,5,B00005RIXO,This is a truely wonderful set and I'm certain that very few could have sung these arias as well as our Joan. ( perhaps no one could have sung them  like this ),967680000,,160,3.8484848484848486
1655548,3,B00005RIXO,"If you want to hear and see what Joan Sutherland was really about, don't buy this one, she sounds old and tired. She was close to 60. If you want to  hear why La stupenda caused such a sensation during her operatic reign as  the Queen of bel canto, I would recommend the following VHS tapes.

7952346,1,B00005RIXO,The image quality is so bad as to render the DVD virtually unwatchable.  The picture has multiple diagonal lines that are probably from the tape used to master the DVD.  This artifact makes the images blurry.  I suggest avoiding the DVD and getting a CD of Miss Sutherland's performance instead.  I cannot comment on the performance as I could not watch beyond the first five or 10 minutes.,1474934400,,390,4.6911764705882355

7952348,5,B00005RIXO,"Why do so many reviews begin or end with the tiresome caveat: ""Though she was no longer in her prime. . . ? ""  The fact is most of the greatest XX century voices were never filmed in their signature roles.  However, Sutherland can be found both with Opera Canada and Opera Australia in definitive performances of roles she reprised locally once she had left the international stage.  There are nine with Opera Australia. I am on my way to acquire them all.  This particular performance dates back to 1986.  Dame Joan, in ""decadence"", belts out the kind of superb coloratura many younger sopranos wish they could achieve at any time of their careers.  Anson Austin makes an appropriately handsome Tonio, and here we come to another cliche: ""No Pavarotti""--though he did hit the requisite number of high C's.  Begg, Wilcox and Marie-Claire are perfectly suited to their roles. I was quite surprised to see Dame Joan enjoying the slapstick comedy as an accomplished comedienne.  I also noticed Donizetti himself was in on the fun, for the ""Singing lesson"" episode is a model of self-parody: Donizetti is using Bel Canto to make fun of Bel Canto!",1400457600,,1142,4.790816326530612
7952349,5,B00005RIXO,"Joan Southerland should not be missed whenvever you can hear her; however, she is about thirty years too old to be playing the part of a young thing for the amorous glances of the members of the regiment.  Overall, very delightful and not be be misssed.",1357171200,,253,4.5
7952350,5,B00005RIXO,"Although an old recording (1986), this is an excellent example of Joan Sutherland in a role for which she was famous. Her voice, and her control of it, is still impressive - although it lacks some of the brilliant clarity it had at its peak. Any Sutherland aficionado will appreciate this performance.",1249776000,,301,4.8076923076923075
7952351,5,B00005RIXO,"When this came out most of us never knew Dame Joan had such a flair for comedy.  The only weakness in this delightful production is our tenor who does hit all the notes, and even looks pretty good, but just doesn't have the ring and focus that we would want in Tonio's voice.  Other that that I have no complaints.  In fact, the character parts couldn't be better and the staging is excellent.  I have 12 videos of Fille, most are very good.  This is one of the best, other greats being Kraus/Welting and Dessay/Florez and Devia/Kelly.

I have this on vhs so I can't speak to dvd transfer quality or lack thereof.",1248912000,2,613,4.380530973451328
7952352,4,B00005RIXO,"The ranking is in terms of comparison with the Sills Wolftrap and the Florez-Dessay versions. Some will like the sound of one or another of the female leads with Florez clearly superior to his two male competitors. My own judgment is based on the productions as a whole rather than the particular voices that portray individual parts. In that regard, I found the Australian Opera version (Sutherland)less successful as musical comedy than either of the others. It simply does not have have the energy and  playfulness that radiate from the other two nor are scenic design and costumes as eye catching (to me). Nevertheless, it is quite satisfactory and will provide an entertaining evening.
A note, after watching again, in 2015, having seen both aforementioned other versions during this same week. Now I would place the Florez-Dessay version as that with the singer most fitting in age and performance to the demands of the role. Florez in looks and singing is still the one I would give the edge to among the tenors. The Dessay version seems to me also to have been a better over-all production.
On the other hand, I can't downgrade anything which gives us a chance to see and hear Sills or Sutherland belting out those ""songs"" and seeming to have such a good time doing it. That they are no longer in their glorious youth will not be apparent to most of us amateur viewers who take our entertainment in opera as we take our entertainment in Broadway or London Theater Shows: different approaches to the same objective...entrepreneurs seeking to entertain us and we seeking to be entertained....anything more than that is a product of greater profundity on the part of the creators and the viewers.",1246665600,,1701,4.845360824742268
7952353,5,B00005RIXO,Excellent performance one that I saw myself live.  I am pleased we areable toget rcordings from the productions of the Sydny Opera House. Again it is Sutherland at her best.,1234137600,,173,4.766666666666667
7952354,2,B00005RIXO,"Read several of the reviews.  Some praise Dame Joan for her singing.  I'm with  those that can't see it.  Compare her to the powerful voice of Tonio.  Even Sulpice's gentle efforts.  Dame Joan might have had a voice and acting ability once, but compared to the others that have recorded this part - sorry - you've wasted your money.  The marchioness and duchess were great in their comic parts.  The chorus did it's job.  But Marie can be done so much better.  Better acting - very definitely.  Better singing technique - well maybe it wasn't too bad.  But voice - sorry, sorry, sorry.",1217030400,,585,4.572815533980583
