8038449,4,B00064AEFG,"Saw this movie a few years ago and it seemed like a good watch, so I thought I would see again. What I noticed this time around is there a lot of martial arts action fighting almost to the point of too much. Still though a good movie.",1480982400,,234,3.8958333333333335
8038450,5,B00064AEFG,"Let's set the bar low: It's a Die Hard clone. It takes seventeen minutes for the action to start. The Ships ball room is a tiny set.
The high points:The hero gets kicked over a glass pained guard-rail but he grabs the guard-rail part and swings back through the glass in order to kick the villain. Many people go face-first through glass. About two family's get gunned down. Lots of UZI fire. At one point the villain known only as ""first officer"" shoots some random guy cowering by a stair case; just cause he's having a Die-Hardish walkie-talkie conversation with the hero. To start the climatic final fight, first officer does an epic drum solo in the unconvincing ball room while the camera cuts away to an annoying child actor tied up, suspended a  dozen feet in the air and has a timed TNT stick bomb strapped to her.

The only thing that can explain all these high points is that director Yuen Wo Ping became Paul Verhoeven for several months of shooting.",1393286400,,962,4.554913294797688
8038451,3,B00064AEFG,"Red Wolf was a pretty decent movie directed by Yuen Woo-Ping, but don't be expecting anything spectacular.

The movie has plenty of gun-firing, martial arts action, and people dying to satisfy anybody that's entertained by that kind of stuff. The plotline was simple, but plausible - just enough to give the protaganists something to fight for.

When watching the movie in Cantonese, be prepared for some English dubbing thrown in. Although some of the actors in this film are American, I don't see why they felt a need to dub over some of the things they were saying into English when they were clearly speaking Cantonese. Even the Oriental actors had some English dubbing. It's a bit annoying and somewhat laughable seeing their mouths move when nothing is being said due to poor dubbing, but it's done only a few times, so it's not too destracting of the film.

Character development is minimal, so don't be expecting to cry over any of the characters. But the characters still have their distinct personalities and the actors play their roles well enough, so the movie rolls along at a nice pace. There's some humor thrown in for good measure, a little bit of suspense to keep you on the edge a little bit, and plenty of fighting to keep the movie entertaining - even some moments where you're saying to yourself - ""Ouch!"" Just don't go in expecting an award winner and you'll be satisfied.",1157241600,2,1394,4.728395061728395
8038452,4,B00064AEFG,VERY NICE ACTION MOVIE. GOOD STORY LINE AND ACTING. AND OFCOURSE CHRISTY CHUNG IS AS BEAUTIFUL AND STUNNING AS EVER.,1154736000,2,116,4.85
8038453,3,B00064AEFG,"This is a Black Belt Theatre double feature! Red Wolf directed

by PING and Awakening Punch fight choreographer by PING! Are these movies good! Red Wolf is a 1994 film that is like a very violent Under Seige! But a far as action goes, Red Wolf is a thousand times better! Story wise, it's not that great! But it does have Christy Chung in here! She's a hot number! You get to see a close up on her butt which is reason enough to buy this! Red Wolf is in original language with Chinese/English subs.! Awakening Punch is an early-mid 70's kung fu film! The kung fu in this one is pretty good! But 2 things not to like about this

movie is bad picture (especially on the night fights to where you only see shadows and all that)and a very retarded story! Awakened Punch is english dub! QUALITY - The DVD plays how it's suppose to! They did nothing to improve the picture! There are no extras, but this product is cheap! I liked Red Wolf and Awakening Punch was average at best!",1107129600,5,973,4.282608695652174
8038454,1,B00064AEFG,"What do you get when you cross legendary action choreographer Yuen Woo-ping (here directing rather than choreographing) with the plot of Speed 2, a bland leading man, an immensely irritating leading lady, an obnoxious and untalented child actress and some tired and uninspired action scenes? Unfortunately, the answer is a complete waste of time. Probably a career low for all concerned, it's a real slog getting through to the end of this surprisingly cheap-looking and occasionally amateurish mess, all hope that it will get better being continually thwarted as it staggers from tired action scene to tired action scene. And how can you root for a hero who is so inept that, despite being head of security on a liner, fails to prevent the villains killing every single one of the passengers and crew except the aforementioned irritating females - probably the two people most audience members will want out of the picture and fast?

Worse than Speed 2 - yes, you read that right: even worse than Speed 2. Not worth the time of day.",1100476800,,1033,4.869318181818182
