8513751,5,B007BFOTWW,"The great Italian-American actor Ben Gazzara delivers a warm feel-good performance as the gentle Don Bosco, a 19th century Catholic priest who founded the Salesians and became patron saint of youth, in this 1988 biopic filmed in English on Italian locations. Although some of the actors appear dubbed, Gazzara and Patsy Kensit carry the film with spot-on performances, as the former appears to be delivering a heartfelt love letter to his Italian Catholic roots. This is a happy, uplifting, positive family movie that manages to avoid getting too sweet. It's quiet, sincere, and hardworking to a fault -- much like its title subject. This film is suitable for children of all ages.",1487980800,,681,5.089285714285714

8513756,3,B007BFOTWW,"I like any movie on a saint, especially if our family can watch it together.  This movie was not one I could show to my children (language and the brothel being next door).  It was a very dated movie, with the music and a few silly camera angles/movements.  The most disappointing part of the DVD is that his mom, Margarita, and Dominic Savio were not included in the story.  I later bought the other movie on Don Bosco (Saint John Bosco Mission to Love), and it is much better at providing the whole picture of his extraordinary life.",1437350400,6,535,4.428571428571429
