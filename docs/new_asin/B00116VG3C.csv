Shaun of the Dead + 28 Days Later + Brain Dead = Dead Moon Rising

1) Acting-- for a low budget indie, it's amazing how many people can act in this movie! Usually, there's a few that stand out and everyone else is very wooden and gives forced performances, but in this one, the actors can hold their own. The characters that are portrayed here (sadly) are people that we all know; The ""Bible thumper, the hot chick, the slacker. There are no over the top individuals in this movie. Just a bunch of regular everyday folks trying to stay alive.

2) Plot--The plot is very reminiscent of Shaun of the Dead and 28 Days Later with a little of Brain Dead added in for good measure. I would call this a combination of the three, with the producers' spin on it, as the cause of the zombie invasion is never explained. The synopsis above states it all.

3) Zombies--The zombies here are ""Snyder"" runners and are destroyed by the typical ""destroy the brain"" attacks. The make up for the zombies consisted mainly of face discoloration and little else. The only real thing that i didn't care for regarding the zombies was that sometimes, the zombies retreated from an attack if the survivors got the upper hand.

4) Make up and special effects--See above for the zombies make up. In regards to special effects, the blood and gore was pretty good for a low budget indie. When a zombie was getting his head bashed in by a baseball bat or taking a gun shot to the head, the blood flowed. I would think if you suffered a paper cut in this movie, you would lose 2 pints of blood! Also, there were no continuity errors that I noticed which was a nice change of pace.

5) When filming the big ""stand off"" on main street, everyone in town must've shown up for this scene! There LITERALLY must have been over a thousand people there! That really showed the effects of the zombie invasion on this small town.

6) This obviously was a labor of love for the producers and all involved in the proction of this movie. One is made to think that the budget of the movie was a lot more than what is was. (less than $[...]) This was a fun romp into zombie land with people that knew how to stretch a dollar and just wanted to get the movie made. The ending was left open (potential sequel?) and I hope somebody offers this guy some serious money to do another. I couldn't imagine what he could do with a real budget!

8240843,4,B00116VG3C,"Let's be honest up front here - the film looks like it was shot on zero budget. It doesn't suffer visually, as much as it does from some poor sound mixing, which makes spoken lines hard to hear at a few points. Thankfully, they decided to go with a B movie self-parody for the project, so the plot and dialogue aren't exactly vital to the film's enjoyment.
The film succeeds largely because of Jason Crowe, who plays dual roles as the hapless lead character, and the occassionally fourth-wall-breaking narrator. It's silly, it skips around, it doesn't make a lick of sense at times, but it still manages to be a lot of fun due to its tongue-in-cheek nature.",1248739200,2,657,4.576271186440678
8240844,2,B00116VG3C,"Dude, this movie was so bad.  The only reason I got it was because it was pretty funny in a few areas.  The acting and whole movie production was horrible.  Do not rent if you are looking for a good movie!  Never buy this movie!!  Just rent it if you want to have a laugh at a crappy movie.",1246492800,,290,3.847457627118644

8240846,1,B00116VG3C,"OK.  I agree completely with the other reviewers that DMR is a very bad movie.  Not bad in the campy, B-horror movie sense of the word.  Just plain bad.  I realize this was a low-budget affair.  I'm used to those.  But in my book low-budget does not automatically equate to a waste of time and/or money.  Sadly, in the case of DMR it does.

First, the film is one of those horrid shot-on-video films which to my personal taste ALWAYS hurts a horror flick.  I realize shot-on-video is usually a budget decision, but more often than not, that choice of medium robs an already low-budget endeavor of any charm it might otherwise earn.  Shot-on-video productions always make me feel as though I'm watching camcorder movies from my Aunt's Tilly's vacation to Mexico.  It just never feels like I'm watching a movie.  And doesn't that sort of defeat the purpose?

What's more, shot-on-video requires very specific lighting to do it right.  It wasn't done right in DMR.  Virtually every scene in DMR is marred by extreme shadowing to the point where at times, so much detail is lost in darkness that you can't even make out expressions on actors' faces.  And believe me, shot-on-video does NO favors for already bargain-basement special effects like the ones in DMR.  Zombies here are nothing more than just street people in pale makeup.  In the ""gore"" scenes blood churns forth from off camera as if pumped by a garden hose.

As far as a story, no one who watches a zombie film expects a whole lot in the way of plot depth (I know because I watch a lot of them).  But they do expect a plot.  In the absence of a plot, viewers expect laughs, scares, and/or gross-outs.  DMR doesn't have a plot(unless you consider running from zombies for an hour a plot).  And sadly it doesn't deliver laughs or scares eithers.

Here it is.  A few guys work at a discount car rental agency.  Zombies start infecting the world.  They run all over town for an hour delivering bad lines and talking to the camera.  End of movie.  A few additional folks are picked up along the way but essentially nothing happens within the story.  There are attempts at humor which mostly fall flat.  But there are no side-splitting guffaws to be found here, intentional or otherwise.  Likewise for scares.  Not a single jump moment to be had.

Sadly, the best thing about DMR is the DVD cover.  Apparently that's where the bulk of the budget went.  I'm not one to turn up my nose at low-budget.  There is a lot of good low-budget stuff to be seen out there.  But sometimes bad is just bad.",1236556800,2,2547,4.540838852097131
8240847,1,B00116VG3C,"This will be the 3rd time I have tried to review this movie, the previous attempts I guess were sensored by amazon. That being said, if this review goes through I will simply say don't bother with this movie. The only thing this movie has going for it is a Cool Name, and Cool Coverart. Otherwise it is an empty shell, don't bother, there are so many other b quality zombie movies that are so much better.",1206403200,4,405,4.2727272727272725
