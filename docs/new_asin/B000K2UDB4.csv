8154038,1,B000K2UDB4,"East Coast Swing Volume Two. Another poor quality DVD. It is too grainy, has a constant flicker, soft focus, and is only 57 minutes long. The patterns are dated. It covers turns, wraps, swivels, and Lindy turns.  I would recommend another East Coast Swing DVD.",1249603200,,260,4.777777777777778
