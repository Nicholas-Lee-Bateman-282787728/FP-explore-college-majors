8535397,5,B005N8Y3QG,this tv series is awesome. there is nothing better or more accessible. The only thing that would make it even better is an option to turn off the sound so I can practice my signing better without immediately knowing what's being said. I could use the volume but my daughter knows how to operate that and turns it back up everytime. Thanks for such a great show.,1354060800,,361,4.402985074626866
