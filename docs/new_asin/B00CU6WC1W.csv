5741639,3,B00CU6WC1W,"Very nice as a stand alone series.  Does not have the original writer Dai Sato working on it.  Wouldn't really compare it to the original,  nor connect it",1373932800,4,154,4.428571428571429
5741640,5,B00CU6WC1W,"As a huge fan of the original Eureka Seven series, I was really excited to see that a small sequel was coming!  At first I was really nervous because of how well the first series ended.  However seeing as how pretty much every staff member returned in the production of this and not to mention took their time with it (because it has been a while since Eureka Seven first aired).  I also enjoy the fact that even though this is a sequel, people who are not familiar with the original can still enjoy this one!  However knowing the originial makes it exponentially more fun and enjoyable!  I'm m very excited to own another piece of my favorite series ever when it comes out!",1371340800,15,674,4.403225806451613
5741641,2,B00CU6WC1W,"If you like Eureka Seven, go buy those blurays instead. Have the blurays, go buy the manga instead. Got that, go buy the manga for Neon Genesis Evangelion and the bluray for said series (and after war gundam x if that's ever released outside of japan) because those two insperations for Eureka Seven are much more like the original ES unlike this god awful sequel. It doesnt seem bad at first but slowly dives into hell and tries to drag fans of the original with it! Im not gonna spoil but be warned there are far better things to spend your money on.",1413936000,4,552,4.368932038834951
5741642,5,B00CU6WC1W,"I'm no ""mecha"" fan but AO is engaging and quite fun. One or two fairly annoying characters but in the grand scheme of things it matters not. A very appealing, scenic island environment, cool futuristic technology, and it's an automatic winner in my book. Characters are pretty fleshed out, the English dub is fantastic. The animation, attention to detail and blu-ray video quality is simply -superb-

Again Studio Bones proves they can do no wrong",1410566400,,447,4.96
5741643,5,B00CU6WC1W,"A much better storyline than Eureka 7. AO is a young boy that has the gift of piloting Nirvash, a mech. Similar to Renton from Eureka 7 with one huge difference. AO has a character that develops and matures. Honestly this series is way better than the previous one. Good acting, characters, story, and animation all around. The nice thing about this series is that it stands on its own apart from the original. Having seen both I can say that I would recommend renting or watching online the original if you want to understand the history of Eureka 7.
Oddly, there aren't hardly any bonus features for the AO series, whereas the original did. The original was more childish, almost immature throughout the series and AO more developed, maturing characters.",1398297600,,756,4.778625954198473
5741644,5,B00CU6WC1W,"Big fan of the original series
And initially excited about this but something is lacking . Overall enjoyable and worth the money
Also something to have the collection.",1394928000,,167,5.0
5741645,4,B00CU6WC1W,"Astral Ocean (AO) is a sequel of the original Eureka Seven anime but it takes place before the events of that series.

The animation is great with vivid colors, scenery and of course mechs. The action sequences were also well thought out but one can get lost in the story if they haven't seen the first series. But don't get me wrong, the show still stands on its own and can be viewed so. You may just get a little confused in its last act when characters and certain plots are revealed.

On that note, If you watched the first series then you will get that sense of ""Oh, now I get it"" as certain events in AO are also necessary to understand elements in Seven.

I was able to watch the series in a couple of sittings without loosing interest and some of the episodes kept me looking forward to what would happened next. I would definitely recommend this series to fans of the first Eureka Seven and any other anime Otaku.",1389657600,3,923,4.323699421965318
5741646,5,B00CU6WC1W,"This was just beautiful I am a huge fan of the original series, and to see it come back was just the greatest thing. This is just like it says on the box, ""a worthy successor to Eureka Seven!"" It brings back the fresh feeling and the good times that the original had plus more. The story is laid out nicely, the characters are memorable and fleshed out nicely, the animation is just gorgeous and combined with its beautiful soundtrack it makes for a crazy piece of eye candy.

If you have seen Eureka Seven, this is a must watch! Just make sure to pay close attention, it likes to throw you for loops and spins with its story. But if you keep track it all adds up, and you'll get dashed easter eggs. If you haven't seen the first series this might be a pass until you start Eureka Seven.",1385856000,2,787,4.211920529801325
5741647,3,B00CU6WC1W,"I thought the original series Eureka Seven was a great series with many memorable characters and a great story. Then I watched Eureka Seven: AO. It really didn't have the same heart and soul of the original series, it felt to me that it may have been better off sold as an alternate to the original series. Where I felt for Renton, Eureka, Holland, Talho and the rest of the GekkoState, in the AO series I felt no real attachment to any of the characters. I gave it a chance though and my hope went up when the *spoiler alert* scub coral in orbit broke apart to reveal the Gekko and second Nirvash but I was let down from there.
Don't get me wrong, AO would have been a good series stand alone or as an alternate universe take (ala J.J. Abrams Star Trek 2009) but with the Eureka Seven tag next to it, the viewer is going to be expecting certain things that just weren't there in the sequel.",1383177600,7,891,4.247058823529412
5741648,2,B00CU6WC1W,"Eureka Seven AO sabotages the very essence of its predecessor in just about every way possible. This story did not start badly as in the very beginning the viewer is treated to interesting (albeit clich) characters presented in a very beautifully rendered environment. Then the story began to reveal itself and that is when you realize that this series never really had a chance.

Much like the characters, the story is never entirely consistent, and eventually settles on a bizarre path that wrecks the premise of the original series all together and will leave any true fan bitter and feeling somewhat betrayed by the way this series was handled. The animation and action sequences are, for the most part, good, so I could not tank the score to one star in good conscience.

If you enjoyed Psalms of Planets: Eureka Seven, then do yourself a huge favor and don't bother watching this, much less buying it. If you have not seen the original series, then you would do well to see it as it is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest animated works of all time. Then you should do whatever you can to avoid seeing this series.",1381104000,4,1127,4.63
5741649,5,B00CU6WC1W,"I really loved the first half of the series! I can see why people rag on the show, but I feel like they blow everything said way out of proportion. I would definitely suggest checking this out. I love it personally, and I CANNOT wait for the second half to get shipped to me!",1380499200,,275,4.111111111111111
5741650,4,B00CU6WC1W,"As I watching the original, I was also reading alot of criticisms about the sequel about how there was NO story, the characters were meh, and there were seldom any action scenes. I ignored the criticisms and watched it .Wow, I really liked it. Although the series felt like a generic mecha boy pilot series, I liked the characters, I thought the plot was easier to follow, the mecha concepts were cool, really good openings/ending songs, there was as much action as the original, plot twists didn't happen sporadically(they actually tied to past events in the series), it was well paced, and it actually made me wish for more at the end.

 Im not a huge fan of the original. To me, the original was a slap to the face with all of the plot holes, terrible twists, the majority of characters designs(Exception to Renton), the jumbled plot, the prolonged pacing of the series, and the backward progression for Renton's character development. Aside from the mechas and the occasional humor, Renton had to be the best thing about the series since he was so well animated and felt like a REAL character. I had to watch the 'Good Night Sleep Tight Young Lovers' to get some sort of closure with the series from the original ending.

Of course, Eureka AO does have its own problems. After ep. 20, there was a story arc that didn't develop similar to the original series where the Gecko state became the #1 enemy of the world for a time. My guess, the studio, BONES, lost funding and had to cut the series short similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion with Gainax. The series also had a problem not to show much of the original characters, Renton and Eureka. I didn't mind the build up for Renton's appearance, and I didn't mind Eureka's brief appearances since it did add onto the overall story. However, I can see why people didn't like this considering they had grown to enjoy the characters so much.

I really would like to recommend this series to anyone who has a deep passion for awesome looking Mechas and Kawaii/Moe girls. However, If you do watch the series, you have to watch the original series to get a better understanding of some of the plots. I was able to understand the story very well with the assistance to the Eureka 7 wiki(didnt help me with the original unfortunately).

Pros:
-Excellent Mechas
-Easier Plot
-Less Plot Twists
-Better Pacing than 50 episodes series
-More appealing character designs/personalities
-Made me Wish for More

Cons
-You do need to watch the original series
-Renton and Eureka are barely seen
-Rushed ending after episode 20",1379894400,2,2559,4.700892857142857

5741653,5,B00CU6WC1W,"It is a great follow up from the original. I was truly expecting to be disappointed, but it really delivers.",1378684800,,108,4.45
5741654,5,B00CU6WC1W,"So far this show is amazing and lives up to the eureka seven title in animation quality story and characters, Certain aspects of the story are a little bit foggy and the end of part 1 just leaves you waiting in anticipation for the release of part 2 so you see what hell is going on and try to answer some of the many questions going on but that's good in my opinion as it makes you think and feel more for the characters....I PRAY that part 2 isn't going to end the way Guilty Crown part 2 ended...seriously disappointed in the way they ended that show. Guess we'll have to wait until OCT to find out though. Part 1 of Eureka Seven: AO is a slam dunk though I'd def. Recommend it.",1378512000,,681,4.12781954887218
5741655,1,B00CU6WC1W,"If you loved the original don't watch this one, it takes everything the original stood for and just throws that out",1377561600,7,115,4.523809523809524
5741656,1,B00CU6WC1W,"If you're going for the Limited Edition one, which actually costs less, don't buy this version! The other one on here is also a Blu-Ray + DVD Combo Pack and contains more. Don't be deceived like I was!",1376611200,9,201,4.315789473684211
5741657,5,B00CU6WC1W,"I am a huge fan of the original (which I hope they make a blu-ray release of) and I am willing to buy anything with the Eureka Seven name tagged on if it comes from the same development team.

The product can in very nice. I picked up the LE set which is just a larger box to put set two in when it comes out in October. The set is very sturdy and I also like how they put both the BR and DVDs in the same cast to limit the wastefulness of two cases.

I won't go into the story as must of you reading this mist likely have seen the first and may know a thing or two about this one. All I will say is the first 18 or so eps are really nice paced and the last few will start to speed up (only 12 are on this set). The ending can leave you wondering about a lot of things that happened in this series but I will say it does answer the biggest question everyone had and the end of the first series. Which I think everyone should enjoy.

All in all I feel this was a good addition to my collection.",1376352000,,993,3.764423076923077
5741658,3,B00CU6WC1W,"The first series was a beautiful love story about a boy maturing into a young man with an anti-war message of tolerance and understanding wrapped in an interesting and unique sci-fi world with an ending we all wish all anime had.

This series has the interesting sci-fi bit and it has a bit of romance but it's missing out on any deeper meaning. It's an adventure, a fun one, but not as fun and not really memorable like the first series. And it will confuse the hell out of you most of the time. The end doesn't even answer all of the questions.

The problems probably stem from the fact that Dai Sato (the brains behind the first series) wasn't attached to the project and that there were problems with the production staff mid series.",1375747200,18,737,4.451851851851852
5741659,2,B00CU6WC1W,"Overall I was pretty disappointed with E7:AO. It lacked the heart and direction of the original series. The original score was adequate, but in no way lived up to Naoki Sato's sublime arrangements for Psalm of Planets or Good Night, Sleep Tight Young Lovers. The action is well laid out and exciting. While I really didn't like the story at all, there were some lovely movements between Ao and Eureka, but generally the story felt lacking to me, as if it were written by someone who didn't really understand the original series. They made some bizarre voice actor choices as well.",1375315200,5,580,4.752475247524752
5741660,3,B00CU6WC1W,"Eureka Seven AO was a surprise to me when I first heard BONES was making it. My anticipation for a sequel to one of my all time favorite anime's was nigh unbearable.

The series starts out very strong, with excellent animation, fluid action, and a superb OST that really pulls you into every scene. I felt BONES was on course for another winner. However, things start to feel rushed halfway through and the story that had a strong start became convoluted and nonsensical.

Overall, if you are a fan of the original series keep your expectations low, and go in knowing you are just watching for an add-on to the original Eureka Seven.
For new viewers that haven't seen the original series, I urge you to find a way to watch it before viewing this sequel.

The OST alone could have pushed me to finish the series if I didn't already love the Eureka Seven series enough finish watching this.

Reasons to Watch:

 - Excellent Animation
 - An OST that keeps you engaged
 - Exciting action sequences
 - (BONUS) If you've seen the original series, keep your eyes out for some Easter eggs!

Reasons to Skip:

 - Story becomes rather disengaging the further in to the series you get
 - If you haven't seen the original Eureka Seven already, skip this series until then.",1375228800,8,1260,4.571428571428571

8586406,4,B00CU6WC1W,"I personally had my own reasons of liking and barely even any reason for disliking this sequel to Eureka 7. So if you're a fan of the previous 50 episodes, you're in for a slight change.

Pros:
1. The soundtrack to this series is behind phenomenal! It surpassed even the soundtrack to Eureka 7 and every time the music began for a scene you could feel the energy and emotional impact behind it.

2. This isn't going to be the same story of the star-crossed lovers who fell in love the first time around and struggled to kindle their budding relationship, it's more action packed filled with giant IFO's (LFO's basically, no difference) vs. Secrets battle sequences and friendships among a colorful set of new characters Ao meets. Ao at times may seem confused in situations as much as we are, but he is never afraid and fights with no fear to the very end.

3. The storyline itself was a bit confusing at first, seeing as it dives into a lot of political mumbo-jumbo, certain dark topics diving into wars of the past and slight racism towards Ao for being an outsider with blue hair, and many different confusing questions you have through out the whole time: Where are Eureka and Renton now? What are these things called 'Secrets' and what do they REALLY want? Who is the man named Truth, what are his motives, how can he do the things he does, why is he after Eureka? Why does everyone want these 'Quartz' cubes that come from the Scub Coral? Many questions come into play in this series and it takes a good eye and ear to fully grasp everything going on around Ao and his journey to find his mother Eureka. But in the end, everything comes into perspective following the last 4 episodes of this 24 episode series. Then, you fully grasp the whole meaning behind everything that's happened previously and can really appreciate such a beautiful story!

Cons:
1. Like previously stated; you'll need to pay attention closely. Through out all the political views, shenanigans among the Generation Blue members with Ao, and conversations among the characters on this show, you might accidentally miss some information and later on not know what they're talking about.

2. I can't fully speak for everyone, but personally the ending for the original Eureka 7 left me longing for more. Primarily saddening me beyond any show or movie in my entire life ever did because I wanted Eureka and Renton to live happily ever after WITH the others from Gekko State back on their world after ALL that they went through to fall in love, but they were at least together on Earth which made up for it. Where I'm getting to point-wise is that this ending has that precise exact feeling: saddening. Ao has to make a very difficult choice that will affect everyone and everything the entire story even builds up to and it just leaves you sitting there wishing for more, like closure is in need.

Overall, I give this show a 4.5 only docking a .5 from my rating because of the ending. Besides that factor, this show was just the right thing to watch and had me wanting more every episode!",1419984000,,3065,4.594149908592322
