2765060,3,B000NDFHXE,"A good story that takes a long time to tell.  Maybe I like explosions and action too much than is healthy, but if you are looking for an action-adventure, this is not the show for you.  If you like something that takes a long time to develop but develops it really well, you will like it.",1301011200,2,288,4.125
2765061,5,B000NDFHXE,"Shingu - Secret Of The Stellar Wars is a very entertaining series.  Following the adventures of Hajime Murata, second year student at Misumaru Middle School.  He befriends the newet transfer student, Muryou Subaru... witnessing incidents with aliens and those that would defend the Earth against.  A lot of action, comedy, romance (building and then some).  There are some inside jokes... one shared between Hajime and his Dad.  A number of surprises in the 26 episodes.... recommend that anyone viewing Shingu watch the episodes first and save the bonus stuff for later.  Great series.  If a sequel comes to be, I hope to see it with great interest.",1263686400,4,650,5.018691588785047
2765062,5,B000NDFHXE,"Going to keep it simple here folks.  If you enjoy Anime that has some thought behind the world is represented, then purchase this Anime.  The story is a little slow at times, even during these times you find yourself very interested in what is going on, as the characters tend to act in very human and thought provoking ways.  I really enjoyed the series and I believe you will as well.",1181692800,8,386,4.408450704225352

8176984,5,B000NDFHXE,"A very fun title. It is full of friendship, loyalty, duty, and courage with a wonderful optimistic view by the middle schoolers story. A fantastic title.",1404950400,,153,4.923076923076923
8176985,5,B000NDFHXE,"This anime had the usual story about the weakling getting the girl, however rather than being like Tenchi or Seina who turn out to have hidden super powers or get enhancements in Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Muyo GXP. So in that way I thought the story did have a nice twist. It took some research but I was able to find out that this set has an English dubbed track also before I made the purchase. I did a search for the set on Ebay and ran the UPC to get a match. There was more info on Ebay including the fact that the dialoge included an eglish dubbed trac. I am thoroughly disgusted with Amazon on this point of not giving accurate info on language and dialoge. if I could rate Amazon seperatly I give them Zero Stars on product description.",1382918400,,741,4.225352112676056
8176986,5,B000NDFHXE,"Great story, not your usual anime. It is not full of action or cute girls, but it keeps you interested in the story. I have actually seen this a few times all ready and every time i seem to find new details/story to it.",1372723200,,219,4.0
8176987,4,B000NDFHXE,"A lot of folks overlooked this anime, and it's release.  Not a lot of fanfare or reviews.

Poor them.  It's not Miyazaki, or even Cowboy Bebop, but what it is it does pretty well.  A funny little sci fi paranormal lark with a sort of first contact scenario, and a whole other mixed bag of influences that slowly unravel as a mystery.  The main character can be kinda.. blah, but he changes and evolves.  Lots of crazy going on, and fun.

Nice little box set, nice packaging, good quality, not a lot of extras.",1369180800,,509,4.351063829787234
8176988,5,B000NDFHXE,"Shingu is one of those amazing anime that no one knows about. High school hijinks meet Twin Peaks meet the X-Files, all packed in a fine wrapper of nostalgia and humor. It may seem to start slow, but every moment in the story is important, and a second viewing leaves you going, ""HOW did I miss all of that?"" The show plays completely fair with you.",1368835200,,349,4.303030303030303
8176989,5,B000NDFHXE,"took a while to get to me but i wanted it and no complaints here.
