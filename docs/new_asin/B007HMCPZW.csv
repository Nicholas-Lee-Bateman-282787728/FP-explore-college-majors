8516747,1,B007HMCPZW,"I thought that this would be a great DVD to put alongside my ""Legendary Guitar Of James Burton"" Hot Licks DVD where James, himself, teaches you how he plays his electric guitars with a finger pick & flat pick and maybe I could learn more of the solos from some of those legendary Rick Nelson or Elvis Presley recordings that I've wanted to figure out.  NOPE!!  I was sorely mistaken!!  Max doesn't even use the kind of amp James uses to get his sound (A Fender Twin or Twin Reverb for live applications - a Fender Deluxe Reverb for studio applications).  About the only thing he got right was that he was, at least, playing a Telecaster.

The DVD should have been titled, Play Burton The Way Max Milligan Plays James Burton!""",1495756800,2,725,4.462121212121212
