4240434,5,B0040HJNHU,"I must say, I didn't have the highest expectations for this movie, because I've never been a fan of foreign films-- as most of us are accustomed to the high-budget monster movies from Hollywood, foreign films often seem mundane and slow-moving, which is a direction this movie could have gone in. However, this one pleasantly surprised me.

White Wedding is a lighthearted, adventurous romantic comedy that will entertain its audience the whole time thanks to its ridiculous twists and turns, and a young couple in love that will keep you rooting for them until the very end.

While the plot mainly follows a humorous roadtrip story of man-racing-to-get-to-wedding-on-time, the film touches on some social issues too, all the while providing a captivating backdrop of the beautiful landscapes of South Africa- something you don't get to see in the typical Hollywood movie.

White Wedding also boasts a strong cast of relatively fresh faces; but don't let that fool you, their performances will draw you in with every scene. The cast is dynamic and memorable, and the characters complement each other nicely. If you like romantic comedies with farcical mishaps and lovable characters and are looking for one with some more cultural substance, you'll find this movie delightfully entertaining. I definitely give this movie 5 stars.",1296432000,4,1329,5.200934579439252

4240437,5,B0040HJNHU,"I was thoroughly impressed with the beautiful scenery that was filmed on location. The lead actor who played the groom was a natural for that role. It was well cast and he made the role believable. The lead actress who played the bride was beautiful, graceful and was enjoyable to watch. I feel that the tension and stress a wedding can bring (along with all the joy) in the form of family conflict, difference of opinion, going against your parents wishes, friction with friends and old wounds all played out convincingly. The numerous and unique obstacles that the groom had to face and overcome, again and again, were humorous and surprisingly new. The township wedding was wonderful and I learned something new about a culture that was very endearing. I loved how the guests burst into song at the end of the wedding ceremony and the bridal party stroll to the tent. Almost everyone that has planned a wedding (and has a large family) will be able to relate to this film.",1331596800,,975,4.674418604651163

4240441,4,B0040HJNHU,"Let me just say that I enjoyed this movie immensely!  The complexities of love, marriage, friendship, and not to mention the reality of of race relations in a post-apartheid South Africa are all portrayed with a comic flair and dramatic sensitivity.  The writers (which include the two male leads of the film) were able to weave in masterfully the sometimes conflicting themes of tradition versus modernity within a cultural context, as well as presenting an insightful look at class differences among Black South Africans, and the acceptance of racial tolerance in relationships. The movie takes you on a journey through cities, townships, and rural areas while you partake in a melodrama that involves a cast of characters on the way.  You will be pleasantly surprised at what is encountered on the journey, and what you find at the end.",1318291200,,839,5.0215827338129495

4240443,4,B0040HJNHU,"There are so many things I like about WHITE WEDDING.  The characters are cute and interesting, the scenery is beautiful, the storyline is engaging, and the actors are obviously having fun with it all.

I especially enjoyed peeking into the languages, customs, and personal interactions of another country.  Even though it is a comedy and some things are most likely exaggerated, I still came away with a connected feeling to the people there, who no longer seem so different from my own experience.  South Africa is so interesting because of their rich and complex history, and recent changeover from apartheid to their present form of government.  Seeing this comedy helped me put some normal, present day structure to all the things I have heard.  One very insightful line in the movie came from an elderly lady who was greeting an old friend after he returned from America, ""Where have you been?  Thank God you're here!  They told me you were in America! I hear there are bombings everywhere, that side.""  It is rare to get some perspective on the feelings and attitudes in a place so far away, and I loved that.

All in all, it was a fun, silly, down to earth road trip tale - but it also had heart and depth.  Amid all the farce and buffoonery, this story touched on some very serious themes without ever descending into heavyhanded, self righteous preachiness.  The tone was always hopeful and lighthearted.

The scenes and dialoge were relatively ""clean"" - no nudity and very little ""language"".  There was a suggestion of group sex early on, and in context this part of the story was to emphasize a character who had a good heart but had gotten morally lost.  It was not exploitive or glorified, but was done in a comedic way.  It wasn't explicit, but it was clear what was going on, so I wouldn't want to watch it with children. I might have given it 5 stars, but the goup sex scene made me uncomfortable and I wish that this character's moral issues had been illustrated in some more discreet way.  Also, some people might be offended by an interracial romance that occurs in the sub plot, but this storyline was actually very sweet, and I don't think it would be a problem for most folks.  Another potential issue is that the dialogue is only partly in English, with the majority of the speaking done in Xhosa.  The sub titles went by too fast and it was difficult to keep up with what was going on.  In this way, there was some work involved in watching this movie, so it is not appropriate entertainment for someone who is simply in the mood to ""veg out"".

I watched it three times (because I missed some of the dialoge due to the language barrier and subtitles), and it was just as much fun the third time as it was the first.  This is saying a LOT because I seldom go back to a movie I have already wached.  I just wish I could see it with a South African so they could fill me in on the details I might have missed and the idioms that I don't understand.  I had to Google the song, ""Delarey"" to get the full significance of the scene where it is played.

All said, I thought is was a good movie and highly recommend it.  While not being the best movie I have ever watched, it is certainly very enjoyable.",1302220800,,3219,4.450511945392491
4240444,5,B0040HJNHU,"I really enjoyed White Wedding, from the chemistry of the actors to the creative direction that Jann Turner took with the film. This movie was VERY appealing to the eye. Most of the time when you think about Africa, you think about deserts, wild animals, and safaris. White Wedding shows in spectacular grandeur the enchanting terrain of South Africa - the lush green grass and trees, high class resorts, and beautiful hills and mountain tops. The fact that this movie is a road trip movie shows off the scenery even more, with the pair traveling everywhere from Johannesburg to Cape Town.

Although it is a storyline that has been seen before, executive producer Ken Follett  helped put together a highly original cast and the chemistry of the actors creates a new and exciting environment, that blends well with the chaos that ensues. I personally picked up 2 copies, one for myself and one for my girlfriend. *HINT HINT* Guys it would be a great Valentine's Day gift! I loved it and give it 5 stars.",1296432000,3,1002,4.72

8412322,5,B0040HJNHU,"Further proof that good movies come from beyond Hollywood. This is a typical grt stuck on a roadtrip while trying to get to the big event comedy complete with misunderstanding. But the cast pulls it off and some of the country-side shoots are quite breathtaking. The wander English doctos gets suckled into their misadventures which has it all"" getting lost, mechanical breakdown, non=standard passengers, and the obligatory drunken ornery bar scene. In the latter our protagonist, Elvis, unwittingly enlists to his cause to get to his wedding.  The crusty old Boer he befriends, the most unlikely of kindred souls, understands the great leap of faith into matrimony he is about to take and becomes committed to seeing it thru on multiple counts"" getting him to the ceremony, officiating as the preacher and defusing tensions. Some serious issues are addressed but they are not in your face and preachy. Its really a fun romantic comedy thats applicable no matter where in the woods you hale from.",1484179200,,997,5.042424242424242
8412323,4,B0040HJNHU,"Cute movie, I liked the chubby husband and the women were beautiful.  But why is it that the men can be overweight and out of shape and the women have to have perfect bodies (I'm specifically thinking about the scene with the grooms friend and him being in bed with 3 gorgeous women, and his girlfriend, who looks like a model, catches him)?

This happens in EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY ON EARTH!  Its ridiculous and annoying.

But it was a good movie to add to my African film collection.  :)",1444608000,,486,4.415730337078652

8412325,3,B0040HJNHU,"White wedding seems to be, on the surface, a comedy about a wedding in contemporary South Africa, but it touches on quite a few important issues. It's a little slow in injecting more serious matters--leftover apartheid characteristics in today's SA, human integrity, the age-old clash between traditional and modern ways, the importance of friendship--because at heart the movie is a comedy. To me what prevents it being a 4 or 5-star movie is a certain looseness of plot, and the unnecessary time it takes for the movie to settle down. That being said, if you don't mind dealing with a mix of English and sub-titles, the movie is reasonably entertaining.",1367366400,,655,4.963636363636364

Its a happy, funny, feel-good movie about one man's adventure to get to the alter - that's both entertaining & lighthearted.",1354924800,,455,4.548780487804878
