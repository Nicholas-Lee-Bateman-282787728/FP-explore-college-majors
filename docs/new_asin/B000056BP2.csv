This being the case, I had my expectations high.  I was thoroughly impressed.  Wonderful storyline...not preachy or one-sided.  Mormons and non-Mormons will enjoy this.  And everyone will learn a little more about these white-shirted guys.  Well acted by no-name cast.  This movie had everything...humor, drama, suspense, love, and lot's of emotion.

1396438,5,B000056BP2,"God's Army was Richard Ducher's first movie, and his first attempt at making a movie of the LDS culture.  He pulls no punches in portraying the 6 Elders who live and work together in L.A.  If the realism bothers some people, then it means you have never served an LDS mission.  Kudos to Richard Dutcher for opening the door to a new genre for LDS people and their friends.

1396440,2,B000056BP2,"Because of the marvelous movie, ""Brigham City"" I was, for a time, a Richard Dutcher fan. But as a Latter-day Saint, I am on guard about what influences I invite into my home. And with God's Army, the director uses spice from Babylon. In the real world faithful LDS missionaries do not ogle over women, so what's the point of depicting it in a movie?  Why do we ever have to compromise our values?  I served a full-time two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 19771979.  There were in my mission some missionaries who acted dumb, a few were even 'stuck in stupid.'  But they were not typical.  So what is the point of highlighting or featuring that, as if to imply that it typifies our missionaries?  The lowest common denominator even with you Richard Dutcher?",1245888000,,790,4.567375886524823
1396441,5,B000056BP2,"God's Army is a spiritual journey made rich by the universal human struggles and strivings of the young people on that journey. Their questions, missteps, and mistakes make their yearning for, and grasping of the sacred powerful, and real. Although Richard Dutcher made this movie for a Mormon audience, I, a non-Mormon, loved it, as did a Muslim friend. God's Army has, in fact proved somewhat controversial in Mormon circles. While it's been very popular in Utah, with many finding the portrayal of Mormon missionary experience very true to life-- there is a minority who feel it's not proper to portray anything other than a sanitized picture of Mormonism to the outside world. Richard Dutcher, who produced and directed the film (as well as playing the part of ''Pops'' the oldest missionary)  wrote this movie out of his own life experience--at different times he experienced the faith, doubt, joy, despair, miracles, etc. portrayed fictionally by the different characters in this film. This Deluxe Edition contains a new widescreen digital transfer of the film, as well as many new extras on a second disc. I highly recommend it.",1198713600,2,1135,5.06951871657754

1396444,5,B000056BP2,"Writer/director Richard Dutcher's films are small masterpieces made on shoestring budgets and limited time, that have themes that will deeply touch anyone on a spiritual journey no matter what their particular denomination or faith. ""God's Army"" is about Mormon missionaries in Los Angeles, and reflects Dutcher's personal experience as a missionary in southern Mexico and has a wide range of emotions. It will make you roar with laughter, or cry with the beauty and tragedy of other scenes, and eventually will encourage you to reflect on the state of your own soul. Dutcher doesn't make one shot viewing movies. His films stick to your ribs like a good meal and stay inside your head. Don't rent them, buy them. You'll be watching them for many years to come, again and again.

""God's Army"" cost $300,000 and was filmed in 18 days, incredible by Hollywood standards. The script is a marvel, and makes the characters come alive. Also a superb actor, Dutcher stars as Elder ""Pops"" Dalton, and as Brandon Allen, the new missionary with a troubled past, Matthew Brown, with his expressive, handsome face, gives an exquisite performance. The entire cast is good, and includes DeSean Terry, marvelous as Elder Banks, John Pentecost, Jacque Gray and Michael Buster. The extras in this terrific 2 disc set are voluminous, and include 2 audio commentaries on the 1st disc, and deleted scenes, outtakes (the ocean baptism outtakes are hilarious), a ""making of"" featurette, and more on the 2nd disc. It even includes 7 frames of the original film in a little clear baggie, as a nice souvenir.

In one choice scene, Elder Banks says to Elder Allen: ""Sometimes I think God does it on purpose...He gives you 100 reasons to believe, and then He just drops one or two for you not to believe, so that you can choose to see if you really want to believe."" Few films have depicted the struggle of faith as well as ""God's Army.""

Dutcher followed this film with the award winning ""Brigham City,"" a crime drama with a spiritual core that also stars Dutcher and Brown. It's a very special film and another big favorite of mine, and then he made ""States of Grace,"" which is somewhat of a sequel to ""God's Army,"" and not to be missed. I love Richard Dutcher. I love his talent, his heart, and his faith (since this film was made he has left the LDS church, as stated on his web site over ""theological differences""). I think he'll go down in filmmaking history as one of the greats.",1197158400,7,2459,4.7272727272727275
1396445,5,B000056BP2,"This is an enjoyable movie to see, even if you're not a Mormon!  The blurb on the back of the box says it best:

""Life as a Mormon missionary is not what 19-year old Brandon Allen expected.  Hours after stepping off the plane, he's ready to hang up his necktie and go home.  But persevering the harsh realities of missionary life in Los Angeles, not to mention an unrelenting mentor (Richard Dutcher), Brandon soon realizes that his most important convert may be himself.  Critically acclaimed performances by this ensemble cast make ""God's Army"" a rare film experience you won't soon forget.""

1396448,5,B000056BP2,"This is the first ""modern"" (I mean unconventional) mormon movie Ive seen. I was warned not to see this one because it may discourage me to go on a mission (they don't have to worry since im not going anyway,personal choice) or I may get turned off as a member. Well,they were wrong! I found this movie very uplifting and inspiring,everyone (people going on their mission or not) should watch this. Brandon Allen went to serve his mission in Sodom and Gomorrahlike Los Angeles. He had culture shock at first (he was from Kansas) being in a really different environment plus meeting some quirky fellow missionaries. There,they met different types of people from prostitutes to non believers. Elder Allen was becoming more and more discouraged,and without expecting it,wonderful things began to unfold (sorry can't give them away here).

  Being surrounded with missionaries myself(im a Mormon by the way),I witnessed their hardships and at the same time the better part of being a missionary. I think this movie strongly hits close to home. This movie may ""look"" like a B-movie (because of its low budget,color and unfamiliar actors,this is a really poignant and well acted film.",1133049600,4,1177,5.0256410256410255

1396450,4,B000056BP2,"There has been several LDS films lately and most deal with the mission experience. While the non LDS viewer might see all these films as unlikely portrayals, what they do represent is true to life except that the gamut of experiences is typically lived over the course of the two years that missioneries serve. When I first saw this I kept saying yeah but, yeah but. As I contemplated later, I thought to myself when was the last time that Miracles were part of your regular life? The answer is when I served as a full time Missionery. The Film ""The best two years""
Is another very true to life portrayal of mission life, and the conversion of a missionery to service. The reason ""God's Army"" is not a 5 star is due to the budget of the film which resulted in some less than authentic looks. This film is probably moving for many former missioneries, but provides an interesting look at ""those mormon boys"".",1108166400,7,907,4.503030303030303
1396451,2,B000056BP2,"I will try to rate this movie as unbiased as I can. It should be known that I am not a Mormon so I hoped folks out there don't think I am bit prejudice against the film based on faith.

Having wrote that, I would say that this movie proves to be very clumsily made. Its clear that a novice director is at work here, the editing isn't very strong and scenes seem to be cut piece parts that seem to be string together to make a whole. Its tell the story but it looked bit cheap.

The strong point of the movie proves to be the acting although I thought Richard Dutcher's role seem to be the weakest, maybe the director/actor isn't used to playing both roles yet. Scenes without him seem to be stronger then the scenes with him. Ironically, the movie centered around Dutcher's character and the effects he had on Matthew Brown's character who was losing his faith.

The movie also suffered from bad script, which also seem to be cut pieces string along to make a story. At times, it seem to skip a scene or two although I am not sure, it sure felt that way. The end scene where Brown' character met up and married the girl he met on the mission is a classical example of ""make a wish"" script writing. The entire sequence would have more meaning and impact if there was some sort of mutual chemisty and feeling between the two characters during their time in Los Angles but most of the movie shown them no more then just casual friends.

Obviously, this is a type of movie that can only pleased one narrow audience, the members of the LDS and even some of them it seem from the reviews, were not pleased. Non-members would probably find this movie bit overblown, preachy and bit one dimensional in nature. You might say that this movie is basically a LDS movie for the LDS members. Pretty sad that it is that, I really enjoyed Two Best Years which is another LDS movie about missionaries that had a broader appeal and a superior film.",1096675200,6,1930,4.337950138504155
1396452,3,B000056BP2,"As a non-Mormon viewer who has been a missionary for my own faith tradition, I came upon this movie because of recommendations from viewers of The Other Side of Heaven.  My sense is that Mormon viewers might enjoy the story more, because they can fully relate to the characters--with great empathy.  The inner struggles of the missionaries seem true and realistic.  I was particularly intrigued that one of them left the field, and probably the church, after seriously contemplating the claims of critiques of the faith.  The anti-Mormon books were presumably written by either ex-Mormons or fundamental Christians.
The strongest aspect of God's Army was the the coming-of-age transformation that is naturally intensified by missionary experiences. Though different in tone, the young idealist-turned tentative skeptic-transformed to true and confident missionary parallels the experiences portrayed in The Other Side of Heaven.
The weakest aspect of the film is the narrow audience focus.  Unlike the Other Side of Heaven, which details experiences missionaries of any faith might experience, God's Army is strictly Mormon in flavor.  Non-LDS viewers might garner mild interest in what drives those well-dressed teenagers that sometimes appear at our doors, but otherwise, the film seems meant for Mormon youth meetings as discussion material.
Bottom-line:  A well-acted and plausible story, but meant primarily for Mormon young people and those who care about them.",1085788800,4,1467,5.551569506726457
1396453,5,B000056BP2,"I thought this was a great movie.  It depicts many of the kinds of things that really happen on a Latter-day Saint mission, both the good and the bad.  One person mentioned that the movie only shows missionaries building relationships with each other and not doing much work.  It would be a pretty boring movie if it showed missionaries going from door to door getting doors slammed in their face for two hours.  I think one has to assume that is happening as well.",1065484800,4,465,4.5

1396455,2,B000056BP2,"I need to preface my review by mentioning that I am an ex Mormon who was extremely disappointed by my two-year mission. This baggage both stains my opinion toward all things Mormon with a vitriolic bias while also allowing me to make first-hand trenchant observations as to the film's content. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the film begins with the only true to life depiction of the Mormon missionary experience. Most Mormon missionaries are young (the convention is to begin at the age of 19) and consequently full of youthful levity. This levity is diminished in the public's view of missionaries by the fact that the Mormon Church invests a lot of energy in inundating its members with images of the sacrosanct missionary. I remember internalizing this spoon-fed image early in my mission. Missionaries tend to live in a dual world, in pubic they behave according to proscribed behavioral norms leaving their truer personas for private. This results in a pervading conflict between the struggle to obediently (and often blindly) comport to the Church's constructed missionary identity and my 19 year old body and mind. Mr. Ditcher begins the film by acknowledging this central conflict that most young missionaries experience. In Mormon circles, this is actually extremely controversial. I particularly identified with the central character that couldn't quite decide whether to just pack his bags and go home. Mr. Ditchers challenge to the churches extremely sanitized image is one of the film's strong points. The remainder of the film is dedicated to events that are clearly meant for a believing Mormon audience. It quickly retreats back to the church's party line. This church party line consists of the absolute 'truth' of the religion regardless of any evidence to the contrary. The film does flirt with historical inaccuracies in the Book of Mormon and the fact that the church would not allow African-Americans to hold the priesthood but then somewhat incredulously solves these issues when the characters simply choose to leave them unexamined and ignored because, well hey, since the church is true, one doesn't need to go any deeper. The film also uses the typical Mormon trope of using campy emotional situations where the viewer is encouraged to conflate the emotional response as evidence for a spiritual manifestation of the absolute correctness of Mormon religious dogma.",1053302400,9,2401,5.190721649484536
1396456,3,B000056BP2,"I'm not quite sure what to say about this film.  I would have given it two and a half stars, but that's not possible.
Writer/Director Richard Dutcher's project obviously faces some difficult constraints.  After all, how do you present an experience--seriously, but without sanctimony--that is deeply personal and sacred for some, and seems like propaganda to others?  Dutcher's film attempts to express the difficulty of faith and inner conflict involved in missionary service, without trivializing or sugar-coating it.
I'm inclined to say that he succeeds to a degree.  Unfortunately, he tries to cram a mission worth of experience and growth into what seems like a couple weeks.  The story's investigation of the main character's spiritual journey is too simplistic, but is far more real--tension-filled and conflict-ridden--than any Mormon church-sponsored production.  Having served a mission myself, I can say that the tomfoolery depicted actually does exist, despite what many more serious types would say.  And I can defend his relative lack of conventional missionary content (knocking doors all day, constant rejection, meetings and lessons, etc) by simply pointing out that Dutcher's character, Pops, is obviously not a conventional missionary.  Even with its obvious shortcomings, I applaud Dutcher for his attempt to give voice to the joy, despair, hope, and trials of faith that, in turn, plague and buoy young Mormon missionaries.
However, it seems that many others, on both sides, would disagree.  Many Mormons I know feel that it makes light of sacred things, and take exception to its loose portrayal of missionary life.  Many non-Mormons take issue with the perceived frankness of its account and the implicit claims to truth.  To the former I would say, my experience (and apparently Dutcher's) seems to differ from yours; try to be more open-minded.  As for the latter, I'm not sure what they would be expecting.  The movie clearly advertises its Mormon content.  I would hope by now that people in the world would be working toward a modicum of flexibility in trying to at least understand, if not appreciate, worldviews that differ from theirs.  I'm pretty sure Dutcher's film was not meant to shove Mormonism in your face.  Must an affirmation of one man's faith necessarily threaten that of the audience?
In the end, I'm not sure if this type of attempt to present Mormon missionary experience to a mainstream audience could ever be truly successful, in terms of popular reception.  A mission is such a profoundly personal experience, most of it gets lost in translation.  Music and well-intentioned melodrama are poor media for expressing such feelings.  But I'm glad people like Dutcher are at least making the attempt, however flawed.  There are far too few movies that actually take religion seriously, on its own terms.",1041638400,16,2848,5.2312775330396475
1396457,5,B000056BP2,"If you want to watch something different, yet funny, clean, and entertaining--then this is the movie for you.  It's about a Mormon missionary and the events he goes through. It packs about almost everything that could happen in one mission.  It poses interesting insight, but doesn't preach to you.  If you want something different try this movie, okay?",1039392000,,353,5.051724137931035
1396458,4,B000056BP2,"Elements I really liked
1. The moving words spoken by the Mission president, after Pop's death, were very appropriate. I was surprised at the Mission President's profoundness and wisdom. 2. Missionary work is a turning point in a young man's life. The mission combines tough and rigerous spiritual discipline and mental preparation. This is two years of total devotion to a cause. A Elder learns what commitment and hard work mean. The mission field is a battle field where the valiant distinquish themselve. 3. I liked how the director protrayed missionaries as caring servants. The blessing of the sick and spiritually deprived brought back many memories serving in Anaheim California. I empathized with the story line and found it interesting. 4. The friendship between Pops and Elder Allen seemed genuine. The story line created alot of respect between the two characters. 5. I liked the spiritual journey of Elder Allen, it demonstrated compassion, humility, and faith.
Criticisms of the movie
1. Baptisms are done in an LDS chapels with a Bishop or counselor presiding 2. Blessings are sacred not secret. I personally was uncomfortable about these scenes dispite the directors accuracy. 3. As a missionary, who served under one of the greatest mission presidents, former Rick's football coach and MTC president; I doubt any new Elder would have been treated so poorly. Mission presidents build up their Elders and assign them with trustworthy and proven Elders for training. 4. There's a mixture of horseplay and seriousness in the mission field. I'll say it was the hardest but funnest work, I've every done. Missionaries must uphold the highest image and reputation for the Church they represent. 5. Not every missionary finds their future wife in the mission field. 6. An Elder would never flirt with the Mission President's wife. This idea was offensive. Because there's a tremendous respect for the Mission President's family.",1034467200,2,1937,5.211538461538462
1396459,1,B000056BP2,"I heard, for quite some time before I saw this movie, that this was an accurate portrayal of a Mormon missionary's life.  I saw this movie with that in mind, and I have to say it was a disappointment from start to finish.  This is nothing like missionary work, regardless of what faith you belong to.
The missionaries in this movie, though they are supposed to be preaching the gospel, spend their time sitting around talking, flirting with waitresses, and developing relationships with each other.  I was surprised to see how much of this movie is just them sitting around doing nothing.
Any true Mormon missionary knows that the best of these guys would be nothing short of a disgrace in real life.  Richard Dutcher has made a mockery out of a serious thing, and for what?  If he wanted to promote the Mormon church, is this the way to do it?  I don't think so.
If you set aside the [weak] plot, the horrible acting, and the numerous holes in the storyline, you're still left with one underlying fact--this movie bears no resemblance to reality.  Do not take this movie seriously, don't even bother watching it.",1033689600,3,1113,4.619289340101523

Overall, Dutcher does a great job of looking deep into the human soul and the process of finding truth and developing faith. So while the characters may not be completely well developed and a few things are not fully explained, I believe that overall this movie deserves four stars for the honest portrayal of the trials and triumphs of missionary life.",1033084800,,607,4.735849056603773

This, to me, was nothing more than church propoganda designed to look and feel ""cool"".  While there were moments of friction and doubt, the weak script left many gaps in the storyline:
- Why did the kid end up staying after threatening to leave the first day?
- What was the whole deal with Pops' relationship with his father?
- Are Mormons honestly saying they have the power to perform miracles?
The central message to this film was that if you truly want to be happy and one with God, you've got to believe in the Mormon theology.
My advice for future Dutcher films, don't make Mormons hollier-than-thou by showing them healing afflictions.  (This is bogus anyhow.)  Second, don't cast yourself as a 29 year old when you don't appear a day under 40.

We just got done watching the Director's Commentary with a former 6th generation Mormon.  Unfortunately, this movie is just another attempt to expand on the lies that the LDS church has proclaimed over the past 170 years.

1396467,5,B000056BP2,"Up to this point Mormons seem to have been universially unable to accurately express why their mission was the single most defining time in their lives. There have been several attempts ranging from the saccharine-like tales of Jack Weyland to the more confrontational ""Fires of the Mind."" The task is difficult because it involves conflict and resolution in many different dimensions: spiritual, physical, intellectual, and emotional. God's Army comes the closest to explaining why a Mormon mission becomes a pivotal point in one's life.
Here the writer/director takes a little literary license. Whereas in real life the conflicts usually come as one proselytes, in this film problems arise mostly from the interactions of the other district missionaries. This district is populated by all the classic archtypes: the elder who is extremely sick, but won't let them send him home; the worldly elder; the elder whose family are all outside the church; the ""intellectual"" elder; the elder and sister who meet and get married after their mission; the straight-lace elder who has all the right habits; and so on. I saw many of these types, but never in the same district.
Not just the ""types,"" but the actions seem very familiar: the pranks (even the slightly gross ones), the fighting, the elder who leaves the church, the elder who dies, and the discouragement.
But you also see the fruits of this labor: the people who are touched by the spirit, the baptisms, the spiritual growth experenced by elders and contacts. This also rings true to someone who has served a mission.
There are some things protrayed in this film that seem a bit harsh, such as the ""Mission President Interview,"" but I took this as an attempt to increase the conflict aspect of this story. There are some things that are a bit unrealistic, such as the ""Baptism in the Ocean,"" but I interpreted this as an attempt to make the ""success"" even more ideal.
The one thing this film wasn't able to capture was the utter monotony, the day in and day out experiences. But I consider that to be an issue dealing with the medium, not the writer/director.
Basically I feel that this is the best attempt, up to this point, to explain why a Mormon Mission is so important in so many lives.",991785600,2,2246,4.836363636363636

1396481,4,B000056BP2,"First of all, I served a mission in Brazil from 95 to 97.  From my experiences, I have to disagree with Alan's review of God's Army.
Young men and women do not become perfect just by putting on a name plate.  Missionaries often play pranks on ""Greenies"" and will horse arround (I disapprove of the toilet scenes).
Most non-members only see missionaries as they are out working.  This film focuses on the less known aspects of life in the field.
Missionaries may have problems at home that affect them.  Despite these weaknesses, Heavenly Father uses us to convey His gospel.
In answer to Alan's critism, there were several months where only one or two missionaries arrived in Campinas.  We would often ride alone to our new areas.  Also, in Laie (with two stake centers) most baptisms are performed on the beach.",991094400,3,812,4.723404255319149

1396483,5,B000056BP2,"The movie is great.  Period.  I respectfully disagree with Alan Holyoak's review of God's Army in that it was not Richard Dutcher's goal to portray LDS missionaries in the traditional, sanitized manner, but rather to show them as having the same human failings we all have.  The difference that Dutcher deftly shows is that these young men and women, despite their failings, have been entrusted by God to help people understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
One would think that showing this view of LDS missionaries and their mission presidents (which view is based on a lot more reality than perhaps Alan wishes to admit), would tarnish the image of LDS missionaries.  On the contrary, our experience with our non-LDS friends has been that they now truly understand what it means to be a missionary in the LDS church and that the extraordinary experiences portrayed in the film actually have happened to some missionaries.  It has drawn them closer to the message of the LDS church, not further away.
I would agree with Alan if Dutcher had left off at the end of the movie with an ending that mirrored the levity found in the beginning.  But the final moments of God's Army are touching and stay true to the principles of the Gospel.",985132800,11,1233,4.738317757009346
1396484,5,B000056BP2,"What a fantastic film.  I bought a copy for myself and one to give away as a gift.  The DVD extras are plentiful and the commentary by the director/producer/writer/co-star Dutcher are very insightful.  ""Brigham City"" is due to premiere next month and I'm looking forward to enjoying Dutcher's next work.  My wife knows very little about the Mormon faith and she watched this film for the first time last night - you guessed it, she loved it.  We laughed, we cried, we love this movie!  An indy must-see for LDS and non-LDS alike.",983750400,2,529,4.634408602150538
1396485,5,B000056BP2,"My viewpoint of this movie may be biased, as I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  The movie did cause me to feel sorry that I did not go on an L.D.S. mission.  It would have been a highly charitable as well as rewarding experience. I found the movie's title somewhat offensive, as well as the liberal use of our sacred prayers (baptism, healing and annointing of the sick).  These prayers were accurate however, and something which we as church members should not feel ashamed of.  This movie may or may not have been sanctioned by the general authorites of the church, but I feel that it was an excellent representation of missionary work.  Many of my returned missionary friends have told me of much more horse-play than what was portrayed in this movie.  You must remember, these are only nineteen year old boys, or twenty-one year old girls, in most cases.  I'm sure that a lot of child-like behavior is very common.  This movie was highly charged with emotion, fun to watch, and just plain left me feeling good.  I highly recommend it, especially to anyone investigating the L.D.S. faith.  I know my life is blessed by my faith in our savior Jesus Christ.",982713600,,1190,4.570754716981132
1396486,3,B000056BP2,"""God's Army"" uses the full-time missionary program of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as the pretext for the movie's storyline.  In the movie a new missionary, Elder Allen, arrives alone in Los Angelos, CA.
The acting in the movie is average, the storyline is not especially compelling, and, in many respects, this movie does not accurately reflect full-time service of missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  For those reasons I awarded this movie the 3-star rating.
In the movie, Elder Allen meets the mission president.  He then meets his companion, and four other missionaries with whom he shares an apartment.  Those six missionaries and their experiences are, at best, composites of many of the more extreme experiences missionaries may have had.  During the course of the movie Elder Allen goes through his own journey of faith.
It is true that there are some missionaries that reflect some of the attitudes and actions depicted, but the missionaries depicted in the movie are not, again, in my opinion, examples of the vast majority of missionaries.
Criticisms of the movie include the following:
1) New missionaries seldom if ever travel without a companion to their assigned field of labor (there is almost always a group leaving a mission at the same time that a group arrives in a mission). 2) The filming of blessings and baptisms (even by actors) is not encouraged by the Church. 3) Baptisms would not be authorized to be performed in the ocean when a Church meetinghouse is in the area -- as they certainly are in the greater LA area. 4) I seriously doubt that any mission president would treat a new missionary the way Elder Allen was treated in his first interview with his mission president. 5) The movie showed more apartment horseplay and less work being done than any missionary would actually do.
All in all, this movie is a mediocre representation of life as a full-time LDS missionary.  Again, some aspects of the movie are accurate (morning personal and companion study time, lights out at night, etc.), others are questionable (practical jokes, general sophomoric pranks, etc.).
I do not recommend that prospective missionaries view this video with the idea that it will give them an idea of what missionary life and missionary service will be like.  My review is based on personal experience, I served as a full-time missionary from 1978-80.
I hope this review was helpful to you.  Have a great day!

1396487,3,B000056BP2,"The most interesting aspect of this Mormon film is that the writers had the courage to portray real Mormon youth as they deal with realistic problems on a missionary trip.  The film surprisingly mentions several serious problems with Mormon doctrine, such as the fact that Blacks were not allowed until 1978.  However, the story fails to seriously deal with these issues, and the audience is told that faith alone will solve all your problems.",979430400,4,443,4.972972972972973

1396489,5,B000056BP2,"God's Army is a spiritual journey made rich by the universal human struggles and strivings of  the young people on that journey. Their questions, missteps, and mistakes make their yearning  for, and grasping of the sacred powerful, and real. Although Richard Dutcher made this movie  for a Mormon audience, I, a non-Mormon, loved it, as did a Muslim friend. God's Army has, in  fact proved somewhat controversial in Mormon circles. While it's been very popular in Utah,  with many finding the portrayal of Mormon missionary experience very true to life-- there is a  minority who feel it's not proper to portray anything other than a sanitized picture of Mormonism  to the outside world. Richard Ductcher, who produced and directed the film (as well as playing  the part of ''Pops'' the oldest missionary) is a active Mormon who wrote this movie out of his  own life experience--at different times he experienced the faith, doubt, joy, despair, miracles, etc.  portrayed fictionally by the different characters in this film.",976320000,48,1024,5.114457831325301
