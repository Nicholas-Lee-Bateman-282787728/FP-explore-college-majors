7835990,1,6303037194,My husband and I bought this tape because we are into Desert Survival.  We had been busy with my upcoming surgery and didn't get to watch it till recently. Well the tape (VHS) is marked DEMO but not on the box.  When it shows a survival skill all of a sudden it stops and goes on to the next segment.  This happens all through the tape.  I would recommend not buy this tape and looking for something else.,1364601600,,405,4.153846153846154
