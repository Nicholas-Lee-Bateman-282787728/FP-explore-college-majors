1247159,3,B00001U0GG,"Although Jame's L wolcott's bizarre film will NEVER be seen as anything but a campy joke, I actually found it kind of cute. The ""story"" as such revolves around the men of Wongo being rather plain, but the women attractive, and the men of Goona, being a bunch of bronzed ""Bo-Hunks"" in leotards, but the women being plain....you get the idea.

It is like a cheesy slice of ""exotica"" music, done as a late 50's jungle/beach romp, with absolutely terrible ""acting"" literally the worst I think I've ever seen, and the most stilted and ludicrous dialogue ever written, complete with the dumbest, most atrocious story as well. B grade, more like zilch, but it is still fun, with some nice underwater shots of the girls to boot.

A classic of BAD cinema!",1285632000,,746,4.643939393939394
1247160,1,B00001U0GG,"The only intelligent animal in the movie, a colorful parrot, narrates this simple story of love, lust, and bedrail. The main pair of wild women looks like white trash in leopard skin and black. They dislike their uggy local tribe's men and may just have to hogtie some men from another tribe from the south. They swim in a large croc pot, or legume of crocodiles, tempting the croc gods like leggy snacks.

Bad acting and stilted duffus dialog do a comedy not make. It is a croc.

1247161,2,B00001U0GG,"I got this as one of the ""50 SciFi Classics"" in the $11.99 collection of that name.  Boy, what a stinker!  Why was it made?  Who were these people?  Did money exchange hands?

Favorite part:  When the comely star, Jean Hankshaw (you remember her from...uh...""Wild Women of Wongo""), wrestles the dead aligator for an interminable amount of time before she realizes it is dead.  Well, not exactly but close enough.

I'm trying to resist buying the Mystery Science Theater (Film Crew) version of this movie since I couldn't help noticing what a great mark it would have been for those guys and darned if they haven't done it.",1243382400,2,622,4.694444444444445
1247162,4,B00001U0GG,"The Wild Women Of Wongo is has to be the wildest B-movie ever made. The film is about two perhistoric tribes, the Wongo and the Goona, the women of Wongo are beautiful and stunning and the men of wongo are mean, ugly bullies. While the men of Goona are handsome and charming and the women of Goona are unsightly, hateful hags. The film has some intense moments like the the leader of the Wongo women wrestling a live aligator, but it also has some funny moments as well, like the Wongo men and the Goona women falling in love with each other. My favorite part of the film is the frenzied dance sequence between the Wongo women and the high priestess. This is the kind of movie that should be aired on Sci-Fi late at night.",1183680000,,722,4.3161764705882355

Right up there with Cannible Women of the Avacodo Jungle of Death and She Devils on Wheels. For a couple hours of laughs and jokes this is the one.",1173312000,,493,4.550561797752809

1247165,3,B00001U0GG,"Despite being a camp classic, this film often drags. The premise is simple: two tribes, Goona and Wongo, inhabit an island. The women of Wongo are beautiful, while the men are ugly (by which I mean average looking), while, predictably, the women of Goona are ugly (really ugly; one of them looks like Divine on a bad day) and the men are handsome. This paves the road for great conflict, but also paves the way for long boring stretches of canoe paddling and stupid subversive plotting.

The film opens with amusing credits done in a cave painting motif, and notes that one of the star Wongo women, Wana, is ""Adrienne Bourbeau"" (Barbeau) in a very early role. The other Wongo women get monikers like ""Omoo"" and ""Ahtee."" The central fixture of Wongo life is worshipping a ""dragon god"" which is actually a small alligator. (This was filmed at various tourist traps in Florida.) Women go talk to the alligator, and then interpret the alligator's instructions for the tribal leaders in between frolicking in their authentically native sundresses and bikinis.

This film has loads of filler, and manages to get boring at an alarming pace. Also frequently featured is a highly annoying parrot that mostly squawks, but also encourages the women to wrestle each other (with much hair pulling.)

Of course a man from Goona shows up and the Wongo women swoon while the men plan to kill him. The women foil their efforts in one of the least plausible screen moments in history. Trivia buffs please note that as the Goona man makes his escape (by canoe) the background music is the exact same music as used during the ""resurrection of the dead"" scene in Ed Wood's infamous ""Plan Nine From Outer Space!"" This is a welcome break from the rest of the soundtrack, which is highly bassoon intensive.

I would have given this film two stars, but there is one scene that earns it another: the ""sacrifice dance"" scene, which features the Wongo women writhing about led by a Queen in an alligator headdress. I have not laughed quite so hard in a while.

As the film winds down we see a woman wrestling a small alligator for what seems like an hour, followed by a call-and-response sacrifice ceremony reminiscent of the loyalty vows in ""The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman."" This leads ultimately to a unique fight scene featuring men with clubs against women with spears against an alligator. (The alligator wins.)

Of course everyone knows how this is going to work out: the ugly men and women pair up, and the attractive men and women pair up. This leads to much rejoicing, mostly from the audience, because their 72-minute nightmare is finally over.

This is fun viewing once for strictly camp value, but most people won't need to see it any more than that.",1147564800,10,2736,4.723270440251572
1247166,1,B00001U0GG,"I think I must have lost my sense of humor, because this movie was just bad.  The dance of the women for the dragon god became unendurable, and I was tempted to fast forward through it.  The fight between one of the women and a four foot long alligator was too protracted to have any tension.  I did think the fact that the alligator started to swim after release was interesting.

There are supposedly three groups of people in this movie.  There are the people of Goona, where the men are handsome and the women are homely.  There are the people of Wongo where the women are beautiful and the men are ugly.  Lastly, there are the ape men who may be invading Goona.

After the hot women of Wongo anger their god, their men send the women off to the temple of the dragon god, which is a large alligator.  The women soon encounter the handsome men of Goona, who have been sent weaponless into the woods as part of a trial, and being the wild women that they are, they capture all the men to be their personal playthings.  In the meantime, the men of Wongo appear to have disappeared, perhaps done away with by the ape men.

The absolute worst part of this movie is the predictable ending, which I will not reveal in any detail in the event you decide to watch this turkey.

This movie has it all; bad acting, bad plot, bad dialog, and bad props.  I thought I saw colorful shorts under the loin cloth of one of the men.  The women appeared to be wearing swim suits under their outfits, or perhaps tights.  I did enjoy the blue hair of one of the male leaders of Wongo.  The leader anticipated a trend.

I thought this movie might serve as fodder for bad jokes.  However, either I was uninspired or this movie is just too insipid to be joke material.  In any case, this movie fails to take off in any meaningful way, so I recommend you avoid this movie for something with more quality, like ""Blood Tide.""

Well, the men of Wongo are goons, while the women are beautiful. The men of nearby Goona are surfer-dude beach-types, and the women are ""ugly"" (which means they're fairly normal looking). Wongo refuses to help Goona to defeat an army of apemen (guys with white paint on their faces). Events occur which force the Wongans to seek out the Goonans, which gets the ""ugly"" guys 'n' gals together! The women of Wongo strike out on their own, capturing the Goonan men by surprise, and a good time is had by all! Watch for the annoying parrot, the 3' alligator attack, and the Wongo-babes' dance of doom!

1247170,4,B00001U0GG,"Review of the Film Detective Restored Version of the Wild Women of Wongo.  I have this film from a Mill Creek set - 200 Drive-In Cult Cinema.  The quality of that version was so poor - it was hard at times to distinguish the Women of Wongo from the Guys of Goona.  I had high hopes that this ""restored' version would be great.

The Good - You can tell the guys from the girls and the film quality is slightly better than the Mill Creek version. However, if you're expecting a great or even good transfer - you'll be disappointed.  The restored version is slightly better than Mill Creek - I would rate it FAIR.  The restored version has a bit more color, slightly better focus, and a lot of scratches and grain from its 8mm source.  (As opposed to he POOR quality Cult Classics version that is more of a blur - perhaps purposefully to hide the scratches in the source).

The Bad - The transfer is sub standard for any commercial DVD, there are no subtitles, close captioning, extras, or menu.

So this is not a great transfer or DVD for supplements (or even basics) - but it is better than other versions I found on DVD.  However - the Prime version available for online streaming seems to be similar or the same as the Film Detective version.  Plus the streaming version has close captioning and is free!",1453248000,,1305,4.395833333333333

1247182,5,B00001U0GG,"Well, folks, this is the weirdest movie of all time. Absolutely ridiculous use of celluloid. I don't know who could have written such a dumb thing, staged it or, heaven help us, costumed it. It is downright creepy. I found it on television one night by accident and was glued to the screen. It was watching a train-wreck. I knew I shouldn't be staring but could not pull my eyes away from the most dimwitted thing ever. I am thinking that the writers, actors, directors, costumers, and everyone else connected with this was doing it on a bet that they could not create something this dismal. They won the bet! And, having said that, I actually watched the whole thing in utter fascination. Then I bought two of them as gifts for people I know would find it as unbelievable and funny as I did. I mean, I laughed and screamed my way through the whole lunatic story. And, having said all this, it did make a point about evolutionary biology. But my admiration goes to the team who created this relentlessly idiotic movie. This couldn't have been easy to do with a straight face, yet every frame is filled with the most enthusiastic and sincere acting. You really have to see it to believe it. Piece of friendly advice: do not eat or drink while watching for fear of choking as you inhale gasp after gasp in disbelief. Have fun.",1375920000,,1324,4.4979253112033195

Wongo worships stock footage films of alligators which they call the dragon god. The two live separate, but when a pretty Goona male prince comes to visit to ask for help against the ape men, the ladies go gaga over him, which the brutes don't like.

The film boasts one good cat fight. Not that the fight was any good, but the people watching and cheering in outtakes was funny.
