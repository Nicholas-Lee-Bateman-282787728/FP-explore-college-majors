8145926,5,B000IJ7ACE,"I loved the different views of cities of America.  I was not born in America and I loved to see all the different cities, especially Washington DC.  I learned a lot and enjoyed the DVD of California.  The San Francisco tape is not very good.  I've been to San Francisco and doesn't show San Francisco the way really is, the colors are poor.  As a whole it is worth buying and showing it to your family and friends.",1365379200,,414,4.256410256410256
8145927,5,B000IJ7ACE,"All of the OVER sets are a good value.  I enjoyed this set very much, especially the Over America and the Washington DC dvds.  The color is crisp and clear on these, and the photography is very professional.  The Globetrekker shows are interesting, but more informational than scenic.",1222560000,5,284,4.875
8145928,4,B000IJ7ACE,"Over America - Deluxe Box Set is great for learning some interesting facts about the United States that you may have forgotten, or never knew in the first place!

The first disk simply called Over America has wonderful photography taken from a helicopter flying over various parts of the United States.  Sections of New England, New York City, Florida, Texas, California, and the Pacific Northwest take up most of the disk.  My state, Virginia, is only shown where the flight cruised down the Potomac River and flew over Great Falls, Virginia, on the way to Washington, D.C. It is great to see some of the monuments of Washington, D. C. from the sky. That was enjoyable, but the South was pretty much ignored in most of the series. In defense of the project, I know that every state could not be covered.

The second disk is San Francisco where the city is introduced as the most liberal town in the United States. This is more like a city tour where you walk around with a guide who does street interviews and gives you local history.  The guide covered many parts of the city where various ethnic areas are visited including  Chinatown, Haight Ashbury, and  North Beach. A trip to the old prison, Alcatraz, is also interesting and lots of wonderful scenery with huge redwood trees are shown in all their glory.

The third disk is Washington, D. C. Having worked in D. C. for a number of years and living within a short distance away, I know this area the best. The Capitol, White House, Jefferson and Lincoln monuments are all showcased, as is the Library of Congress.  I think most Americans would find it very interesting.

The fourth and last disk is New York City.  Again, very enjoyable, with two different guides giving their personal tours and visits of the city.  This was done in a light hearted way and there are some fun and amusing scenes. I especially loved seeing The Statue of Liberty and many of the tall buildings from the air!  Also, the viewer is given a visit to all five Boroughs. The horrible destruction to the Twin Towers is discussed and Ground Zero is shown. An interview is conducted with a man who survived the bombing. That was a very mournful and sad part of this otherwise easy going tour. We Americans will never forget that day in our history!

I found this series to be very rewarding and recommend it to anyone who wants to visit some of the places mentioned.  If you have no thoughts of a visit, this series will make you feel like you've been there!",1214697600,20,2488,4.559550561797753
