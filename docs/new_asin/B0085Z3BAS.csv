5134275,5,B0085Z3BAS,You are in  a studio class with a talented teacher but with the advantage of being at home. Great variety; great video.,1355529600,,119,4.409090909090909
5134276,5,B0085Z3BAS,"Although I've been exercising for many years, I am relatively new to yoga.  I had low-back fusion surgery two years ago, and my doctor recommended yoga as an alternative to my ""typical"" workouts - running, weight training, high-level cross training...  Although I typically scoffed at yoga (felt it was for those who didn't really like to train), I tried it.  I became hooked!  Some of my favorite instructors include Bob Harper, the P-90X guy, Jeannette Jenkins, the MTVinstructor (Kristen...?), the Exhale couple...  I saw a video clip for Travis Eliot's Cross Training and decided to give it a try.  In short, it's an awesome workout.  I enjoy the flow of the poses, the music, the way in which his voice resonates, the degree of difficulty...  I'll buy more of his DVDs for sure!!",1349481600,9,784,4.842105263157895
5134297,5,B0085Z3BAS,This Travis Elliott yoga DVD will defiantly be one to add to your weekly  practice!! Be your best inside and out!,1399766400,,113,4.380952380952381
5134298,3,B0085Z3BAS,"Was so looking forward to this workout by Travis Eliot. This workout is similar to an Intensive body Sculpt by Bryan Kest I recently gave to a friend cause it was 50mins[should've of kept it!].  Bryan Kest has just the right number of people in the class and has one modifier.  I specifically ordered this DVD because Travis Eliot appeared as soft spoken and have the same yoga style as Bryan Kest.  it for the 30min Cross Training [not the additional workout Hardcore=63min] but the 30min was 58minutes in reality, time I don't have to do this workout. Other than that I found that there were too many people in the cast with too many modifications that you just can't look at while doing the poses. I would recommend Bryan Kests Intensive Body Sculpt before I'd recommend this DVD :(",1397088000,4,785,4.5928571428571425
5134299,5,B0085Z3BAS,A great workout video that focuses on different parts of the body that I didn't know muscles even existed. I would definitely recommend this one to others.,1386288000,,155,4.777777777777778
5134300,4,B0085Z3BAS,"I have several yoga cd's.  This one is challanging but not way over my ability level.  Mr. Eliot is upbeat yet calming, if that makes sense.  He does a good job of explaining the poses, but does not over explain.  I like the options regarding sound, music, etc.",1371340800,,261,4.375
5134301,4,B0085Z3BAS,What a wonderful dvd. It is as if you have a class in your house that is on-going and you can make happen whenever you want--,1370217600,,125,3.8461538461538463
5134302,3,B0085Z3BAS,"It was very basic and yet, challenging because of static holds.  I probably wouldn't purchase any more of his dvd's yet, I would go to a class if he were teaching",1368316800,,162,4.225806451612903
5134303,1,B0085Z3BAS,"I did not realize that this is a DVD of a yoga class. I cannot tolerate doing yoga DVDs that have the instructor guiding the class.  There is something kind of pretentious about yoga instructors that grate on my nerves.  Instead of demonstrating the pose, giving brief direction and shutting up, he kept going on and on and on.  That's what I hate, the running commentary.",1366502400,7,372,4.606060606060606
5134304,5,B0085Z3BAS,Crosstrainer has added a great addition to my yoga practice. It's helped me to stay commited. Highly recommend it. Worth every penny.,1364860800,,133,5.090909090909091
5134305,5,B0085Z3BAS,"I really love this yoga practice, and all things Travis Eliot. He is an amazing yogi, with a very pleasant teaching style and excellent cues. As with his other DVD's you really don't have to watch, just listen as he guides you through the poses. I would highly recommend this product. I would say it is for intermediate yogis because of the length and the level of some of the poses....if you are new I would recommend his Yoga Foundations DVD and then follow with this one.",1362441600,9,474,4.459770114942529
5134306,5,B0085Z3BAS,This is a great series for those who want to push for stronger practice but need motivation. Travis gives advice and encouragement through out the dvd.,1362355200,2,151,4.846153846153846
8525778,3,B0085Z3BAS,Probably the best yoga instructor I have seen...you don't even have to look at the screen to accomplish the poses...Travis does a great job at reminding you to engage!,1427673600,,167,4.793103448275862
8525779,5,B0085Z3BAS,"I am relatively new to traditional yoga (have been doing fusion fitness for years - workouts that blend cardio/pilates/yoga/weights). That said, I love this DVD. Travis' descriptions are fabulous and I don't feel like I have to constantly crane my neck to see the TV screen. He is teaching a live class with students who appear to be at a variety of levels so there are modifications to make poses simpler or more difficult.  Definitely a great workout - gets my heart pumping and I ""feel"" it the next day. Looking into buying more of Travis' DVDs for sure.",1426550400,2,557,4.626262626262626
8525780,5,B0085Z3BAS,I would not recommend this to a beginner or someone who prefers a leisurely workout but I loved it!! It's a great way to show you more of the speed and intensity of his Ultimate Yogi DVD's which I have just started and am loving as well.,1425168000,2,237,4.0638297872340425
8525781,5,B0085Z3BAS,"Some background on me first.  I am in my mid-fifties and have been using home fitness videos for many years. I work out 4 - 5 days a week and usually do high intermediate/advanced workouts.  I was never a fan of yoga until I found Travis Eliot.  The settings, music, his instruction are all top notch.  I can move through any one of his practices without having to look at the TV, his directions are that good.  If you are new to yoga I would recommend you start with Yoga Foundations.  I used that DVD about once a week for six months or so before I felt like I was ready to move on.  Yoga Cross Training was the perfect next step for me.  It moves faster then Foundations and is more intense.  The Hardcore Yoga section s fantastic!  I love core work and felt I had a nice, strong abs until I did this section of the DVD.  Yowsers!  I really felt that one the next day.  Fantastic DVD, very challenging and I highly recommend it.",1419897600,4,931,4.192090395480226
8525782,5,B0085Z3BAS,I LOVE Travis Eliot! This is a GREAT DVD for my collection!,1413590400,,59,4.0
8525783,4,B0085Z3BAS,"Overall, I have really enjoyed this video.  The class is paced well, and I enjoy how he describes the moves very clearly.  I did note that for some reason, I was a bit put off by his voice at first. However, that very quickly passed and now I thoroughly enjoy it. The cross train class was very comparable to a Hot Yoga class I take (obviously without the blazing hot room!) at a nearby studio.",1409788800,,394,4.24
8525784,4,B0085Z3BAS,"Having 2 years of classroom experience, found this DVD to be a good companion to use to keep up the practice during my off time. Very easy to follow but a good workout.",1407628800,,168,4.121212121212121
8525785,5,B0085Z3BAS,Good home Yoga DVD.,1406937600,,19,4.0
8525786,5,B0085Z3BAS,Amazing instructor.  Great program.,1406592000,,35,7.75
8525787,5,B0085Z3BAS,"I have Travis Eliot's 30-Min Short and Sweet Yoga workout DVD and I needed a longer one and this is it!  I can do for full DVD or shorter, I make it work for me, right now I've only done up to 45 mins, I did 10 mins of the YogaHardCORE workout and it is tough!  Overall very challenging Yoga workout, try it!",1401062400,,308,3.873015873015873
