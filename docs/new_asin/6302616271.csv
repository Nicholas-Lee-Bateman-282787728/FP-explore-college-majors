Ridiculously cast with horrible direction and an awful script (hey, you new screenwriters out  there, if this thing can hit the big screen there has to be hope in selling  yours) Chris, and his discovery, should have stayed undiscovered.  Painfully, I sat in my seat in utter disbelief for almost an hour  (historical accuracy or not).  I turned to my lady friend and asked her if  she wanted to leave.  Turns out she was just as miserable as I and accepted  readily.  Between 1 and 10, this turkey gets the lowest possible mark, a 1.

490273,1,6302616271,"Mind-numbingly awful ""historical drama"" recommended only to Marlon Brando completists. In his 1994 autobiography, Brando had no qualms admitting that he earned $5 million for ""an embarrassingly bad performance"" as Torquemada. He also realized ""Christopher Columbus"" would fail due to its ""boring, poorly written, idiotically constructed story.""

I know some other reviewers think this is a ""cheesy"" movie with acting that is not so good, but I disagree.  The filmmakers and writers did their research and it is one of the most accurate portrayals of Christopher Columbus and his desire to sail ""across the ocean sea"".  It starts with the troubles he had getting someone to believe in him and his ideas and then continues with the first voyage and landing in the ""new world"".  I don't want to say any more for fear of giving away the story entirely.  I realize it does contain some images of naked Amerindians, but it is usable with classes if you stop the movie when they first land.  My students always enjoy the film and remember much later about Columbus and his exploits, so I think that is worth something.

490277,3,6302616271,"Is Christopher Columbus: The Discovery a swashbuckler? Is it a revisionist history? A celebration? Condemnation? All or none of the above? Well, yes it is, and that's just part of the problem.

To be honest, it's not really THAT bad. It's not that good, but it's not that bad. Aspiring to Warner Bros. in the 30s to evoke the spirit of Errol Flynn, but only making it to Fox in the 50s and their Richard Conte Deluxe-CinemaScope costumers, the Salkinds' much ridiculed version is not quite as moronic as its reputation would imply.

Many of the key incidents Ridley Scott omitted are to be found here: the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, Colon's ineptitude leading to the wrecking of one of his ships, with the relationship between him and the Spanish Court much more convincingly essayed. To Ferdinand, the New World means finance, to Isabella, converts. Both are allowed more depth than in 1492: Conquest of Paradise; Isabella in particular is penned in far more detail than Sigourney Weaver's conspiratorial flirt. Sadly, this high-point of the script brings the low point of the casting, to hysterical effect.

Isabella may have been a gung-ho Catholic zealot not averse to having a few hundred heretics tortured to death, but it's hard to believe she was quite as jolly hockey sticks as Rachel Ward's head girl of the chalet school incarnation here. On the other hand, as the king, Tom Selleck, the poor deer, wanders through it all like a man emerging from a serious road accident, aware of his wounds but too numb to take it all in. You just can't help feeling sorry for him.

Other casting is similarly erratic. Although hardly memorable, Marlon Brando's Torquemada is at least allowed a motive and rationale for his cruelty that is very much of the time. Robert Davi and Oliver Cotton are both very good in drastically underwritten roles, but Nigel Terry, whose ham acting has near-ruined many a good film, makes the most of the opportunity to ruin a naff one by undermining many of their scenes. A young Catherine Zeta Jones here seems dead set on being the next Rachel Ward: with her disturbing tendency to stare at the ceiling in moments of high emotion as if waiting for a song cue, she is just part of the scenery.

Yet the odd thing about The Discovery is that while critics were quick to sneer in anticipation of Ridley Scott's version, it actually comes down much harder on its hero. George Corraface's Columbus has a much nastier side to him than Depardieu's victim of snobbery and class warfare; whereas Scott constantly found or invented excuses, here the explorer has the kind of contradictory fanaticism that sees no need of them, as capable of exploitation and cruelty as of great dreams, and certainly more mercenary in his motives. If Depardieu's incarnation fails his dream for all the right reasons, Corraface's succeeds for all the wrong ones, and he is good enough in these later scenes to dispel at least some of the memory of his incessant would-be dashing grinning of the first half.

But the darker side is never tapped by either the confused script or John Glen's painting by numbers direction (at one point Timothy Dalton was set to star but pulled out three days before filming after reportedly falling out with his former Bond director). The photography is distinctly available light - there is no vision or style here, and despite the higher budget it looks cheaper than its main rival. The New World seems to be little more than a stretch of highly desirable beachfront property ripe for timeshare development, making it hard to see what all the fuss was about. Only Cliff Eidelman's rich and sweepingly romantic score attains the epic status the film aspires to.

Too old-fashioned (or not old-fashioned enough) for its own good, this may have made marginally more than 1492 at the US box-office, but it's no surprise that it's now no more than a footnote to Scott's film (which itself is no more than a footnote to Scott's career these days).",1216944000,,3985,4.78343023255814
490278,3,6302616271,"This film is mediocre in spite of the many screen stars working briefly in it. It seems all money has gone there and so, it's failed.
Curiously, Colon, the protagonist, is little known although yes, he has the face of a South Europe man;  material means are clearly scarce. One doesn't believe that tremendous risky voyage. Moreo curiously, Marlon Brando seems like some portraits of Torquemada, the great, strict, cruel inquisitor of Catholicism.
However, general focus or overview I think is correct.  It's suspected the many mysteries about Colon come  from his own will. He wanted his origins and early life to remain hidden. I have read the original diary of the navigation written by the own Cristobal Colon. Without little doubt it's a writing partially real, partially covered by false or disguised facts, all involved into the incognita he pretended to discover: alarming declination of primitive compass, false estimation of length of the ocean etc. He justifies these in order of no alarming the crew, (they believed Earth was plane and were superstitious people), and Spanish Inquisition. Conception of Earth by Catholic authorities was in conflict with ideas of Colon. Much speculation has been made abut this personage, who was a womaniser, had several extramarital sons,  sailed and traded in all known seas and at last, into the unknown ones excepting for some testimonies lost in the past perhaps he knew.
Also, at times of Colon, Kings of Spain Isabel and Fernando finished in forging a powerful country and soon, a world  empire, but proceeded to expulse the Jewish from Spain, a tremendous error we still pay in Spain, and defeated in full the moors, conquering Granada: Spain, form these times was a monolithic Catholic country.
But gold, silver and money were scarce. Colon wasn't surely religious nor Spanish, at less at hearth; he seems a mercenary with an idea of his own, but excepting that, an accommodating man, perhaps a genial character, it could be. He isn't perceived today as a hero, but as a man not very scrupulous, audacious opportunist, a gambler and dreamer surrounding unlawful activities. The crew of the three carabellas were in high proportion criminals with nothing to lose, commanded rigorously by brothers Pinzon, very expert sailors and no doubt men of honour very different of Colon. They had a task to do and they did, but they were not dreamers.
Beginning of the drama of convert to Christianity to the Indians is shown, as the first killings and tragedies the colonization supposed. This movie show a little of all that but has a poor making very compressed. Religious fanaticism and corruption are two things that fatally go closely together. This movie, summing up, shows all these, but is short in time. People not previously interested I don't think taste this movie.",1208390400,,2821,5.019230769230769
490279,5,6302616271,"C. Columbus: The Discovery  DVD

This movie is probably the most historically accurate film that I've seen, so far, on Christopher Columbus.  Contrary to what you might have been taught in elementary school the intelligentsia did not think the world was flat.  They thought the world was round and was approximately 25,000 miles in circumference at the equator.  Columbus thought the circumference at the equator was more like 18,000 miles.  (25,000 is correct)  Since Marco Polo had traveled by land to Cathay(China) going East for about 12,000 miles, all he would have to do was sail West for 6,000 miles and voila he'd arrive in the Indies.  Well, he was wrong, but got lucky and hit the New World instead.  I think it is pretty arrogant to say that Columbus ""discovered"" the New World.  One would think the Indios did that.

Anyhow it is a good movie.  Tom Selleck plays the King of Aragon, Marlon Brando gives a credible performance as the Grand Inquisitor Torquemada.

Warning some bare breast of the native females, but tastefully done.

Recommended for students that want a historically accurate version of the discovery of the New world.  Not the typical PAP they teach.

And the cast! It's so cool to see the great Brando pass the proverbial torch to next generation actors Benecio Del Toro and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Rachel Ward is excellent as Queen Isabella and Robert Davi is superb. People expected to get a serious drama about Columbus but what they got was much more fun and for this people complain?

The performances are terrible. I am not going to talk about Marlon Brando because many people have done it already. But from an historic point of view this is a crime. Who wrote this?
Columbus was not an idealistic. Like any man of his time (Renaissance) fame and fortune were the great objects for a man's life. He wanted to be famous. For him this enterprise was bussiness. That is why he went to Portugal, because Portuguese were at the time the most advanced in nautical enterprises. But once rejected he went to Castilla. This was an enterprise made by Castilla not Spain. Aragon was more interested in the Mediterranea, that is why Fernado showed no interest.
And of course, The Inquisition.
Yes, probably Torquemada had the torture multimedia room, right by his office. Please. What do you think  a Gran Inquisidor was?. The man did not need to be before the poor prisioners while they were being torturated. He was more busy with politics and advising Isabel.
No this is not a good film, it is a nightmare. And from the didactic point of view is a great mistake. Better read a book. from Prof. Antonio Dominguez or the History of Spian edited by Alfaguara. But do not spoil young brains with this",1075420800,2,1383,4.532

This odd casting brought to mind episodes of Fantasy Island. But there was a Big Name included too; Marlon Brando as Torquemada, Spanish Inquisitor and Advisor to Ferdinand and Isabella.
