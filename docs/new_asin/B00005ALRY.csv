1414548,5,B00005ALRY,"This is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. In my opinion it is too good for an oscar. The writing and acting are impeccable. It would be an injustice to tell anymore about the movie other than its better than the Usual Suspects which i like. This is a must see! The DVD also has an alternate ending. See it as soon as possible, if you like great movies.",998784000,,369,3.933333333333333
1414549,4,B00005ALRY,"It is probably only right that the process work both ways. American cinema gobbles up Australian talent, from Mel Gibson and Judy Davis to Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman, so it's fair play when Australian cinema imports elements familiar to the American crime film genre.
""The Interview"" stars Hugo Weaving, now known to American audiences as Agent Smith in ""The Matrix"" and Elrond in ""The Lord of the Rings"" films.  The movie gets off to a jarring start, reminiscent of Franz Kafka's  ""The Trial"", as Weaving's character Fleming is arrested, dragged into the police station, and questioned with no idea if he is being accused of something or what that crime might be.
From there, the film borrows elements here and there from recent American crime movies like ""Internal Affairs"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Seven"", and ""Presumed Innocent"".  The common thread linking these films is the omnipresent theme of ""The Interview"" - what is the truth and how far can or will a person go to find it.  A workmanlike script benefits from a talented cast, headlined by Weaving but also complimented by Tony Martin as the lead interrogator, Aaron Jeffrey as hot-headed cop Prior, and Michael Caton as a savvy beat reporter.
Although many American viewers might find ""The Interview"" a little too overly familiar in some spots, the solid script and the skilled acting make it a worthy and recommendable film.  It's smart, and it handles its territory efficiently.
One technical note - as of the day of this review, the technical details of the DVD do not list it as being widescreen.  For all you widescreen fanatics like myself, take heart.  The film is indeed widescreen, presented in its original aspect ratio.  Enjoy.",991872000,6,1704,4.954385964912281
1414550,4,B00005ALRY,"Okay, I lied about having seen the DVD, but I've seen it in the theater and I thought someone should get the ball rolling with a few thoughts about the movie itself.
Hugo Weaving you will either remember from ""Pricilla, Queen of the Desert"" or ""The Matrix"" depending upon whether great cinematography and acting (in the first case) or expensive special effects and editing (in the second) opens your wallet at the local cineplex. Weaving gives an amazing, better-than-Oscar quality performance in this recent take on the police interrogation movie. In the opening scene his apartment is raided by some very aggressive police... gosh, if I tell you about it, it will lose all of its impact. Better not to tell.
Suffice it to say that if you liked ""Glengary GlenRoss"", ""The Trial"", ""Under Suspicion"" and/or ""The Usual Suspects"", if you like to see an actor wrap himself around a role, and if you like a nice plot twist or two, buy this film. Twice.",984614400,12,946,4.739393939393939
1414591,5,B00005ALRY,I love this movie.  I love Hugo Weaving.  Check this movie out if you can find it.  I have seen it about 10 or so times and it is definitely in my top 50 favorite movies of all time.,1350518400,,182,3.6153846153846154
1414592,5,B00005ALRY,"I watched The Interview some years ago & loved it. I saw it was available at Amazon, purchased it , and again was not sorry I did
In my opinion this is one of Hugo Weaving's great performances.",1314576000,,193,4.105263157894737
1414593,4,B00005ALRY,"Fascinating story.  Many subtle twist (without even leaving the Interrogation Room).  Hugo Weaving, et al, do a masterful job of dragging you through the many twist and turns.  This is the kind of movie that I'll pull out and watch late at night every year or so.",1300838400,,263,4.553191489361702

1414595,5,B00005ALRY,"I thought the guy from  The Matrix, Hugo Weaving, who say's ""Mr. Anderson"" to Neil, was a boring part, but Now I have seen what this guy can do. I don't even think I can compare his acting to anyone else I have seen in my 50 plus years.

Compelling, award wining(in my opinion)acting to the extream, it seems so real, like if it was to happen to you in this same situation. Some times the accents from the other Austrailian actors are hard to figure out, Hugo is superb.
 If anyone ever tells you the ending, then the purest of acting skill, will be fornot. This guy, is my newest ""best Actor"". I will now buy ALL his films.",1267747200,,624,4.183333333333334
1414596,4,B00005ALRY,"One of Hugo Weaving's earlier works, shows his ability to play the role of someone on the edge. Did circumstances push him there or just follow him ? Is he or isn't he a madman ? I've watched it twice and still don't know the answer. A very gripping movie !",1266796800,,257,4.0588235294117645
1414597,5,B00005ALRY,"Great acting, great film work, good pace... A must see, and see again.  Classic.",1081296000,,80,4.714285714285714
1414598,5,B00005ALRY,"I'm not even going to bother comparing this to ""The Usual Suspects."" This is not a hard-boiled movie like the aforementioned, but it does have moments of emotional release and stylized violence. Subtlety is the modus operandi in this film. Director Craig Monahan propels the cast toward a creepy conclusion that answers all lingering questions, yet leaves many avenues of debate open long after the film ends. I found ""The Interview"" to be a fascinating and insightful portrayal of flawed characters to whom I could relate in many cases. Hugo Weaving delivers some chilling work that Kevin Spacey could only dream of nailing with such believability.
In addition to top-notch acting, the cinematography was also excellent. The variation in camera angles and film speeds was again subtle and masterful in its creation of a dark, unsteady environment.
Ultimately, in my opinion, this is a movie that stays with you long after the credits roll at the end. I highly recommend it.",1051056000,17,974,5.055900621118012
1414599,3,B00005ALRY,"Contrary to many views, this is not similar to Usual Suspects. In the latter film, a man concocted a story based on information he was viewing the entire time of the police interrogation.  Here, while there is, similarly, an interrogation, the man being interrogated is not viewing anything at all. A more important difference has to do with the psychological basis for the events that unfold in the two different stories.
Whether or not the suspect here is concocting a story should not be revealed for fear of spoiling the premise of this work--which is a real paradox.  Why?
While the acting here is superior--especially Hugo Weaving in the role of the man under investigation--and the premise is gripping, ultimately the rationale for the events that unfold in the police station is shown to be too banal to support the powerful theme of the story.
A critical difference between the two films is that The Usual Suspects involves a spectrum of shady characters in the criminal milieu, while The Interview focuses on just one.  This is important, because the opportunity for multi-layered interaction (among the criminal bunch) in Usual Suspects is present and handled very well.  Here, the interaction is strictly between the suspect and the police.  With that kind of restricted focus, there would have to be a much greater emphasis on the psychology of the two sides.  While that is true to some extent, because this film ultimately emphasizes procedural error, the entire psychological basis is trivialized--in essence, destroyed.
The trivialization and virtual elimination of the psychological basis for the mental battle between the two sides itself makes the film much less than what it could and should have been.  This is really too bad, because there are some fascinating sequences.  The very last scene of the suspect alone could have been a great ending, if the focus on procedural error had been replaced by something more subtle.  As it is, this is a noble and failed effort.",1025568000,2,1991,5.009090909090909
1414600,4,B00005ALRY,"I had been intending to see this film for some time because I heard it was good and I am glad I finally got around to it. To review it though is a little more difficult. This movie contains a plot that slowly unfolds, revealing several twists, which I would not want to spoil for the masses. The film opens with Eddie Fleming(Hugo Weaving) sleeping on his couch when all of a sudden some police inspectors break down his door and come charging in. Eddie is so frightened he wets himself. He is then arrested, although the police refuse to tell he what is going on. They take Eddie and a couple bags of his things(that can only be assumed are some sort of evidence) to the station. The inspectors lock Eddie in an interogation room shortly before conducting what they call a ""formal interview"" with him. This is all I can really say about the story. Almost the entire film is centered around the interview. What I can say, however, is that despite some slow pacing this is a very well made and entertaining movie. The cinematography is very stylized. Monahan uses lots of deep focas, fish eye lens, and Dutch tilts. The lighting in the film is dark with very high contrast. All this helps the audiences sense of confusion as to why Eddie is being detained. The editing conveys the gradual unraveling of the events that have led to Eddie's arrest masterfully.
Also I would like to make a note of the casting. The actors in this movie did a very good job. The two lead characters played by Weaving and Tony Martin(Detective Steele) were very engaging at there sort of cat and mouse game during the interview. But in particular Weaving is great. American audiences know Weaving as Agent Smith from the Matrix, but what they may not know is that he is a fine character actor(see Pracilla Queen of the Desert if you don't believe me).
This film may not be for everyone. Because of it's slow pacing and totally character driven plot I am not sure I would recommend it to people who want to see action. This being said, the director has done a fine job, with a good script, and he keeps the film interesting from start to finish. Anybody who likes films that keep you guessing will get a kick out of this.",999043200,7,2197,4.467661691542289
7935506,3,B00005ALRY,"Comparisons to the Usual Suspects are GREATLY overblown, but this is still a tightly plotted, well acted little set piece focused but not entirely limited to a pair of cops interviewing a suspect in a room. Loses some steam in the third act  but manages to more or less keep it's credibility, which is an accomplishment for this kind of film.",1508457600,,342,4.60655737704918
7935507,5,B00005ALRY,"This demonstrates the skill Mr Weaving has at creating a character that, by the end of the film, one isn't quite sure of - something that takes a great deal of finess.  The lift of an eyebrow, the tweak of the lips - all the subtle nuances that he uses oh so well to build his character.  An excellent film, completely character driven and with equally talented support cast.",1502064000,,375,4.420289855072464
7935508,4,B00005ALRY,"Very good performances and it kept you guessing right the way to the end. Love Hugo Weaving. The characters were a bit one-dimensional and it dragged a little, but otherwise good.",1496275200,,179,4.806451612903226

7935510,2,B00005ALRY,"This psychological thriller is worth a look, but it's not that good. It was advertised as similar to the usual suspects (because it's an interrogation type of movie), but it can't stand up to the usual suspects if you place it on top of a ladder. This movie drags and it has no closure. Leaving the viewer hanging doesn't make something a classic. A lot of the rave reviews on the cover of this movie is in my opinion very misleading.",1433030400,,434,4.37037037037037
