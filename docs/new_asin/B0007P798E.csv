8050100,5,B0007P798E,"When you realize that the Big Quake hit San Francisco in 1906, you get a sense of how amazing it is that this DVD has clear footage of the aftermath of the event. Films had just started coming into the mainstream it must have been a novelty to record images of the event after it happened. Most films of this era did not survive, which makes these clips that much more fascinating.

The rest of the disk is less dramatic, but still interesting. It's all very, very vintage silept clips from around the city in the first half of the 20th century. Top notch all around.",1148256000,5,567,4.349056603773585
