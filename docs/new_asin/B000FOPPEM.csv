2578387,4,B000FOPPEM,"This is a good pair of niche Sci-Fi movies. I'm not going to review the films in depth, so I suggest you see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sphere/dp/079073639X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sphere</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Contact/dp/0790733226/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Contact</a>&nbsp;for more detailed coverage.

The case includes a single DVD with Contact on the front and Sphere on the back. There is no labeling on the DVD and the packaging didn't release the DVD very easily so I felt very nervous handling it. Additionally, it was a little difficult to tell which side of the DVD was which because you had to look at small text on the inner ring of the DVD.

From what I could tell, both sides were identical to their standard non-bundled counterparts. You're just getting two on one disc.

These are pretty good movies with a little bit of a cult following (especially Sphere). The only bad thing here is the packaging.",1220400000,2,1034,6.117241379310345
2578388,1,B000FOPPEM,"By putting out these two films on one DVD, I can't help but feel that Warner's has ""short-changed"" Contact by pairing it with such an inferior film like ""Sphere.""  In my opinion, Criterion should have issued their own DVD print of ""Contact"" with all of the extras.  I don't even see it in upcoming Blu-Ray releases and it certainly deserves that kind of upgrade.  ""Contact"" knocked my socks off when I first saw it.  The day it came out on LaserDisc, I bought it.  The DVD had many extras on it so I got rid of the LD and picked it up on DVD.  It's definitely a classic 90's sci-fi film that is NOT getting the kind of treatment (like a release on Blu-Ray) that it so richly deserves.  This is a step in the wrong direction...and a slap in the face for fans!!!  Forget it!",1215475200,3,772,4.239726027397261
2578389,5,B000FOPPEM,"Two great movies
I love having them both on the same disk
on time delivery
Thanks.",1197676800,2,82,4.1875
2578390,5,B000FOPPEM,"Love these new double features they have out can't beat the deal on these two films one low price,Sphere and Contact both are really good, great acting, good story lines and special effects....Enjoy.",1193443200,4,199,5.0606060606060606
2578391,4,B000FOPPEM,"Contact is a good picture story held together by its main actor. A story that has more effect now with current global warming problems. I liked it so much that I bought sequel.
Sphere is an incredible story at the time it came out brought closer to reality now with the latest scientific discovery that time travel is a possiblity. Actors are great and story line is clear.",1191715200,2,373,4.5
2578392,5,B000FOPPEM,"Contact is one of my favorite stories of all times. I loved Carl Sagan and had read the book long before it had become a movie. And Jodi Foster &
Matthew McConaughey did a great job with this story!

Sphere,on the other hand,also was a great book HOWEVER the 'movie' was lacking severly. Although the actors were all great people for other projects I am clueless as to how anyone ever thought they needed to be in this story. Still it is an ok scifi film to have in your collection but my advice would be to buy the book as well because it really was a BETTER  story when read.",1185321600,7,577,4.1891891891891895
2578393,5,B000FOPPEM,"A surprisingly good film based on the SETI project, with a great question at the end!!

  I did not find Sphere to be as interesting as Contact.",1178928000,6,144,4.2592592592592595

2578406,4,B000FOPPEM,"I bought the DVD for Contact. Very good flick. If you haven't seen it, and you're into science fiction, you should see it.

Sphere is just as boring and confusing as ever. Even a powerhouse cast couldn't save this flick.",1376179200,,220,4.5
2578407,4,B000FOPPEM,"This is more a review of the double feature DVD than a review of the movies. If you already know these films and want decent copies of them in a space efficient single DVD, then this is a good item to buy at less than six bucks delivered. With so many well-worded thoughtful reviews of these films already published, I'll keep this very short:

Contact is still a fun adventure even a decade and a half after its release. The cast is solid; the melding of science and religion still makes for good controversy, and the special effects are not awful.

Sphere is a great book written by a brilliant author. Please judge Mr. Crichton on the book. If you read the book, it may help the movie for you but nothing can completely rescue this film from sad editing and directing. Take the worst of ""The Abyss"" and combine it with a bad Star Trek episode.",1364083200,,846,4.382165605095541
2578408,4,B000FOPPEM,These are a couple of old favorites of mine and I was delighted to find them avalible as a double feature and with such a good price.,1361145600,2,133,3.962962962962963
2578409,5,B000FOPPEM,"5 stars for the two together. Separately they are good movies. But together at the price I paid they were more then an excellent buy making them worthy of 5 stars. Both action packed, edge of your seat, and it keeps your mind open to other things in life. The possibilities that might await you. I recommend the two pack of movies. Keep an open mind.",1360195200,2,350,4.318181818181818
2578410,5,B000FOPPEM,We love watching these movies at home.  They never get old and I can't wait to watch them over and over again.,1355875200,,110,4.0

2578412,5,B000FOPPEM,"""Contact"" having long been a favorite of mine, and Sharon Stone and Dustin Hoffman being on that list as well, I couldn't resist the combo and was not disappointed. However, for first-time dunno-how-the-2-feature DVD works, I'd have appreciated BIG RED LETTERS - TURN OVER for 2nd one. But that didn't take too long. I'm now prepared for another double feature DVD.",1231891200,,365,5.0
2578413,5,B000FOPPEM,"Both good science fiction movies.  Jodi Foster and Matthew Mcconaughey are both excellent in Contact.  The book was a bit better in detail, but books usually are.  This book was translated to video format keeping true to the theme of the story.  It seems like the ending could have been closer to the ending of the book, but I'm sure they had their reasons.  Sharon Stone and Dustin Hoffman made a great team in Sphere.  I like the idea of time travel, when carried out well and without the usual problems of temporal inconsistencies.",1222646400,,534,4.627659574468085
8124989,4,B000FOPPEM,"Another great deal of two good movies, ok the Sphere is a bit more far-fetched - who would have a discovery like that and only some scientists around with no security- but still good movies!",1508716800,,190,4.457142857142857
8124990,4,B000FOPPEM,"I had seen both of these films many years ago and decided to watch them again. Both are good, though I liked Contact better because it was ""deeper"" than Sphere (pun intended). Seriously, Contact is a more spiritual film that ponders our existence and what happens when we die. Sphere is an adventure film that's fun to watch. This is a nice pairing for fans of one or both movies, or for those who just want to see a couple of old films that can't be found on Netflix.",1490227200,,468,4.269662921348314
8124991,5,B000FOPPEM,"Love this set. This is the second time I have bought this, and I'm not a sci-fi lover. Both are well done",1485388800,,105,3.8181818181818183
