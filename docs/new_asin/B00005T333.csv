1659279,3,B00005T333,"This video is for beginners.  I'm an intermediate to advanced and found that this video is to slow and doesn't challenge my muscles.  I didn't even break a sweat, not even when I increased my weights.
Great for beginners though.",1070236800,3,228,4.675
1659280,1,B00005T333,I am a firm beleiver and I love all of the Firm videos. I swear by them but this one is not what it says it is. 95% of this video is abs and MAYBE 3 leg excercies. You might as well buy 5 day abs.,1044316800,6,196,3.282608695652174
1659281,4,B00005T333,"For the absolute maximum results, by all means use weights.  Albeit, dumbbells, ankle, etc.  Beginners definetly move at your own individual pace.",1043366400,,146,5.590909090909091
1659282,5,B00005T333,"I think this workout is awesome.
She works the heck out of  stomach.  So much I lock up.  But I love it.  You also work your inner thighs and your [behind].  If you are serious about working out, then I recommend
this for you.  I think they should have called this tapes, Lock up Crunch and some buns hips and thighs.  But it definately gets the job done.
I am a serious exerciser and would not recommend it if it did not impress me. You will get a workout.
I also recommend you incorporte this workout with The Firm Upper Body and every other day Pilates. Also, a healthy diet. That is what I do and have seen phenomial results.",1042243200,7,629,4.191666666666666
1659283,4,B00005T333,"I bought this video as an alternative to the wonderful ""Standing Legs""  This one is just not so tough, but I would suggest it to those just beginning a fitness program as a way to strengthen your lower half before getting serious with ""standing legs""  You will find that this video concentrates on your body from the waist down, which for most women is THE problem area.  Combined with a healthy diet and cardio sessions, this one will be effective for you.  However, if you are an advanced exerciser looking for a lower body challenge, get you some big old ankle weights and give this one a go!",1029456000,12,595,4.481481481481482
1659284,2,B00005T333,"This FIRM tape is titled ""Sculpted Buns, Hips and Thighs"" which is ironic because AB work is mainly what you will be doing. The back of the box also lists Upper Body for 1.5 minutes. There is no Upper Body work, but the back of the box shows Tracie doing push-ups. Did they cut the Upper Body work out of the tape? Other FIRM users tout this as a very difficult tape to do. I had no trouble doing all of it the very first time and I would count myself as an intermediate exerciser. I will do the tape several more times to see if it brings about the changes that other FIRM users claimed. Don't get me wrong. I love the FIRM but I think they need to explain the title.",1021939200,21,668,4.030075187969925
1659285,5,B00005T333,"I bought this video a few years ago and used it off and on until recently.  It's a great workout for bun, hip, thighs, and especially ABS.  It doen't point out ABS in the title, but it includes a great ab workout.  It took me a while to be about to finish the entire ab workout segment, but I stuck with it until I mastered it and the results speaks for itself.  I'd recommend this video to anyone who's serious about resculping their lower half.  It's a great lower body workout for the beginner as well as the intermediate exerciser.  The advanced may not find it challenging enough.  Again, it's a great workout video.  Not too fast and not too slow.  I highly recommend it.",1016323200,7,677,4.352
1659326,5,B00005T333,I used to have the VHS of this when I was in high school and my sister and I did it all the time. We literally had 6-pack abs just from watching what we ate and doing this video.

1659357,5,B00005T333,"This workout takes place entirely on the floor.  The title does not mention abs, but there is a good bit of ab work in this workout.  Overall, I really like it.  It focuses on all of my problem areas.  :-)  This is a shorter workout (37 minutes) and I normally prefer longer workouts.  I usually do this one in addition to another workout to get a longer time in.  With that said, doing this one alone is a good lower body workout.  Tracie Long is an excellent instructor and gives very clear cues.  I'm very happy with this addition to my library of Firm videos.",1361232000,4,563,4.285714285714286
1659358,5,B00005T333,"I used to use the VHS back in the day and was thrilled to find it available on DVD. I have always loved this workout. It's not easy, but somehow, even if I'm not in the mood to do any other form of exercise, I can usually talk myself into this. Excellent core workout.",1360195200,5,268,3.9814814814814814
1659359,5,B00005T333,Tracy Long is the best...and she works you out so well.  I love this floor workout.  She provides excellent instruction and you will see results if you do it.  I use this one for extra work after a total body workout.  Love it.  I've almost gotten to the point that I can keep up...almost.  ],1350000000,3,292,4.218181818181818
1659360,4,B00005T333,"I have sworn by this video for years now, but decided to switch from my VHS copy to DVD. I still believe this is one of the best ways to tone your hip area even though it's a bit older. I was a little disappointed that the quality of the DVD was worse than my VHS tape, and the DVD seems to be a straight copy of the VHS tape without any addition of a title screen or menu. I am still happy I got the DVD version so I can use it in more devices, but I just try to do the workout without looking much at the screen due to poor quality.",1309305600,4,534,3.692982456140351
1659361,5,B00005T333,"Tracie Long is an excellent instructor. I owned this workout on VHS till it finally bit the dust. I replaced it right away! It's that good! Although the title doesn't state it, this workout also focuses heavily on your abs. It's a great abs and lower body workout done all on the floor using dumbbells and ankle weights. If you're new to weight training you could start off light or even no weights and get a great workout. If you're used to working out, going heavy gives you an awesome ab/hip and thigh workout. You feel and see results right away. It's a workout you'll pull out for years to come. I know I always manage to work it into my rotations and I've A HUGE collection of workout videos. BTW my 21 year old daughter loves this one too.",1307923200,12,746,4.335714285714285
1659362,4,B00005T333,"I really like this workout. I used to have the VHS, but it broke so I got this DVD. The quality is much better. This workout is tough and effective. The FIRM said you would see results in 10 days, and I noticed results even before that in my lower body and abs. This is a great workout for the abs, butt, and inner/outer thighs. Use ankle weights and dumbbells for quick results and better tone.",1307577600,8,395,4.2105263157894735
1659363,5,B00005T333,I wanted this DVD because I knew how much I loved the VHS.  This is a really great workout.  You can definitely feel this burn after this one!!,1304121600,4,143,4.071428571428571
1659364,5,B00005T333,"So I had this on VHS and used to do this in college. You can feel the burn in your thighs, buns, and stomach. The good thing about this video is that you don't have to have any side equipment to do it, though hand weights might come in handy. It is an interesting video to watch too with its random arrows and inside jokes you don't hear. But overall this is a video worth adding into your routine or standing by itself.",1278720000,8,420,4.072289156626506
1659365,5,B00005T333,"This is the first Firm workout I ever purchased, over 13yrs ago, and I still come back to it. I'm buying a new one simply because my daughter broke my VCR, so I'm getting it on DVD. The whole purpose of this workout is to strengthen and tone glutes, hamstrings, flexors and abs - without putting pressure or strain on the knees. I'm not really sure if it's possible to include quad exercises in an all-floor workout, but your legs and butt will be so toned you'd never know this area was left out. This is CLASSIC Firm; excellent cuing, and a good variety of exercises taught by trainers whose focus was potent, easy to follow workouts over looking cute on camera, and before they got gimmicky and started doing info-mercials hawking cheap plastic workout ""systems"". The Classic tapes have more of a ""class"" feel to them - there's a room full of people working out vs instructors working out in what is obviously a studio soundstage. These are the serious workouts for serious exercisers - the 10 Workout rule is true. You will lose weight, you will tone up, and you will MAINTAIN your weight loss. I have - for 12yrs.",1262131200,6,1118,4.53960396039604
1659386,5,B00005T333,"The Firm tapes are wonderful and this one was my first one. I joked that for my 40th birthday I got these attachments to my hips in the form of fat. well,I did this tape the 10 times they suggested and although it was tough at first I stayed with it and the ""hip extenders"" i had developed were gone! it was this tape that made me try more Firm dvds and i know i can pick them up and 10 workouts later i'm back in shape. there's so much out there to try but i know that the firm really works. i will say however, that it is heavy on the abs which is fine, but the title didn't warn me about that part of it. and honestly, not much on the thighs. this is more like a buns hips and abs video.the only part of the thigh they hit on was the hamstrings and left out the quads.",1260921600,13,771,3.825
1659387,4,B00005T333,"I have been using the Firm tapes for years.  This one is quick and no nonsense, all on the floor.  Love it.",1255046400,4,107,3.8181818181818183
1659388,5,B00005T333,"I love Tracie Long. She is one of the few people I can work out to at home. Her cuing is perfect, very seamless and she seems to intuitively know when it's time to move to the next position. If you listen to her, you're able to transition very easily from one position to the next. Her work-outs are also relatively low impact, so I can see why people with injuries would find her work-outs appealing. I have found the ab work-outs to be very effective. My belly area has always been my number one problem spot, and no amount of crunches ever did anything, but the different positions in this videa really do the trick for me. It doesn't concentrate on just one area, but the upper, lower, and sides so while I may not be destined for 6 pack greatness, it does give me definition in my waist. This work-out is all about working smarter, not harder, which I'm all about. It is true there are no chapters, but one, this is a straight copy from the original VHS, and two, it is so short, you really don't need chapters. Her other DVDs, including the ones where she has branched out on her own are just as excellent.",1203552000,14,1112,4.3
1659389,5,B00005T333,"When I really don't feel like working out, this is the DVD that I use.  It's a 30-minute floor workout concentrating on abs and legs.  The segments are pulled from The Firm's early videos ""The Tortoise"" and ""The Hare,"" and are led by excellent instructor Tracie Long.

You get a nice basic workout that should leave you a little sore if you really put effort into each of the exercises.  Great for the days when you just don't have the energy to do a more active workout.",1180742400,10,471,4.379310344827586
1659390,3,B00005T333,"Although this is a DVD, it might as well be a video. There are no chapters. You have to sit through (or fast forward) the opening advertisements. The workout is combined - alternating abdominal & leg exercises. All are done from the floor. I bought this DVD because I'm recovering from a knee injury and can't do standing leg exercises. This DVD has a great leg workout for my situation, so I'm glad I have it. However, I thought the abdominal exercises were too easy, so I'll be fast-forwarding through those sections and using this DVD exclusively for leg work. There are better Ab workout DVD's elsewhere.",1177545600,6,608,4.691588785046729
1659391,5,B00005T333,"When The Firm created this video - it was just that, a ""created"" video - not a choregraphed workout.  This was spliced together from two original workouts entitled ""The Tortoise"" and ""The Hare"" - they took portions of both workouts to make 3 additional workouts, originally entitled, ""Lie Down and Workout,"" (whose title was changed into Sculpted Buns, Hips & Thighs), ""Tough Tape"" and a aerobic tape that featured all the step routines from the original workouts entitled ""Ballroom Aerobics"".  That is why they have Tracy Long in between some sections of the workout to set you up a little before it started to make sure you had the proper weights and were in the right position.  (Later on, when The Firm continued to splice new workouts together they even got rid of the introductions - in this way they could make a whole bunch of tapes from just a couple original workout productions.) The name was altered primarily, I imagine, to lure other consumers, not familiar with The Firm, to buy it.  If you know anything about The Firm - all the original titles have been changed for one reason or another.  What used to be called, ""Volume One"", is now ""Body Sculpting Basics"" - probably because ""Volume One"" wasn't telling the general consumer anything about what to expect.  Remember - this was once all sold from a catalog and one television commerical way back in the eighties.

I was never disappointed in this workout - you have to take it for what it is. It isn't meant to be a ""Total Body Workout"" - It was intended to be used when you wanted brevity - it is something to do on the days you don't want to spend over an hour exercising. It's an effective workout - and its good but just keep in mind, it is only 30 minutes - and most super hard and effective leg and butt work is done standing - using bigger weights.  You can still up the poundage and make it more difficult but again - it is what it is.  I suggest that you alternate this video with other workouts because one video won't get your lower body in the best shape of your life. There are tons of other videos out there to get better leg work.",1133222400,4,2113,4.439276485788113
1659392,4,B00005T333,"I started doing this tape again last week. I have been doing it every other day. If you are looking to buy it, you should know that what the other reviews say is true. It is definetly mostly abs. The leg excersises feel good because you can tell that the muscles are working.

  This video really makes you feel like you have accomplished something afterwards but the setting is freaky. It is in some sort of strange mansion with paintings and intricate carpets. The music in the background sounds sort of like nintendo and as the reps get harder, the music gets faster and more intense. It is somewhat amusing. As far as the instructor, she seems pretty serious the entire time. If you are looking for someone peppy, this isn't the video for you.

  You may as well buy this video to add to your collection. It's worth having, especially for abs.",1124323200,3,847,4.503267973856209
1659393,5,B00005T333,"This workout with Tracy Long is highly effective in changing your body in just a few workouts.  I use this tape to jumpstart my workout routine every morning.  It's only about 30-35 minutes long (which is just long enough to make a good workout but short enough to not make you bored and want to stop).  I have occasionally gotten too busy to work out for a couple of weeks and when I start back up everyone notices a difference in my body.  I started the tape again about a week ago and my friend mentioned how flat my stomach looked.  It's great for tonong.  Don't expect to sweat while doing this tape as it is mostly tough toning.  The buns section isin't very long (but it's really intense and does the job)and I strongly notice a difference after doing the tape for a couple of workouts. This tape is so great to use and really produces the results that you need for toned hips, buns and thighs.  Working out thighs is not the easiest to do especially for females but this tape really delivers.  Tracy Long is a great instructor who moves through the entire tape in a very smooth manner.  I recommend this tape to all of my friends as a great way to loose inches and tone the really hard lower body areas. In fact, I am going to Hawaii on my honeymoon and I'm using this tape to get my bathing suit body back.",1111276800,4,1315,4.266129032258065
1659394,3,B00005T333,"As far as the workout itself goes, I guess it's pretty great if you do use weights. Don't let the title fool you, though: even though the tape does include some good thighs/buns exercises, it's mostly abs (just like other reviewers have stated). I never sweat and my heart rate never goes up while working out to this tape, but I still feel the work in my muscles.

The setting and the instructor are both extremely annoying, though. No, I don't think any of the people working out in the background have anything natural about them and neither do the surroundings or the instructor. She seems as if she were reading the lines and basically as if she just weren't there at all or couldn't care less.

Altogether I have to say I have very mixed feelings about the tape and I don't think it'll ever grow to be one of my favorites.",1097625600,3,828,4.405228758169935
1659395,2,B00005T333,"I saw the add on the shape magazine.
Just after a page where there was an exercise explained with Body mechanics.
So I tohught this video will also have exercises explained with reference to muscles being involved in the exercise .With detail diagrams too.
But it was not so.......
And this video does not have any sections specificaly saying
warm up ,workout,cooldown.
So it is definitly not for beginers.
as it does not specificaly appear warm up,cooldown and so on...
I am just saying thos on the basis of first you do the warm up.
Well in this video I see them doing Crunches even at the warm up.(the first 3 minutes)
I wonder whether that can realy be so. Someone pls let me know.
As for leg exercises. I ve seen you say there is not. It is all abs. Well I got to say there is a lot of abs.
But there is legs too.
Hamstring(I guess biceps of legs),the opp of hamstring(Quadriceps)
Inner tighs,opp of that(outer tihgs)
It is there.
But forget diagrams. They do not even mention  the name of the part to which they are doing this exercise. You can not just hear them say Ok this is for iner tighs and so on.
Soooooooooo..............
And I feel they do not give a good detail on how to execute the exe5rcise.
There was one point where she says...
doing exercise with Isometric hip...
Any one knows what this means ?
And how do we do isometric hip..hip is a joint not a muscle as  bicep...
But one thing I like about this is entire work is done on the floor. But how can a one follow when execution is not so well explained. And sometimes even what she says is difficult to here..
Is She saying  As or Abs .
Thanks
Hope u find my review useful. Take a look at the questions I made here. Pls let me have an answere.

Firstly, it's super-short, just 30 mins or so. But here's my main gripe: Approximately 75% of the routine is simple ab crunches. There are also some leg lifts, but frankly, if you just want to lie down and do 500 ab crunches, you could do that for free. Total waste of money. The leg lifts are straight out of Jane Fonda. This DVD is Jane Fonda lite - it's a VERY watered-down version of her famous Eighties Jane Fonda's Workout, which was brilliant. Anyway, I got through the boredom of this DVD and none of my muscles hurt whatsoever the next day. The workout is just too short and unvaried. I can't believe it's called Buns, Hips, and Thighs - it's basically almost abs alone. Total crap - for some conditioning, get Dangerous Curves Ahead.",1504137600,2,910,4.455089820359281
