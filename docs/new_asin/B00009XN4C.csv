1896527,4,B00009XN4C,"I found this movie to be quite good, some of it was very disturbing; which means the writer hit the nail on the head with his subject.",1127347200,7,134,4.0
1896528,4,B00009XN4C,"Since I work for a police department the whole ""drug"" theme of this movie was a little too close to home for me. I did enjoy the movie but you wound up feeling sad for the pathetic lives of the characters. Gerard Butler fans will like his portrayal of a slightly crazy arms dealer. The acting was well done and the plot was unfortunately really close to the type of lives that drug dealers and users actually live.",1126828800,23,414,4.32051282051282
1896529,3,B00009XN4C,"Shooters  is in the genre including John Woo's City On Fire (1987),  which Tarantino borrowed for Reservoir Dogs (1992).  Very violent, with drugs, guns and violence the stars.

While it does not have the balletic grace of Woo's slow-motion shooting scenes, nor a star with the charisma of Chow Yun Fat behind the gun, it is a worthy entry into the genre.  The cast acquit themselves well in mostly underwritten roles.  Louis Dempsey is fine as recently released from prison Gilly, who is the voice telling the story.  His friend(?) J is annoying, but Gerard Butler does a crazed violent and vain gun dealer well.

The gritty streets, sleazy bars and places these underworld people frequent is shown with the contrast to the home J and his wife and child have but he is already among the living dead, as the narrator says.  These people walk streets with the rest of us, but their world can turn violent and deadly in a second.

Not great, but I give it a solid 7/10.",1122076800,43,967,4.569767441860465
1896530,4,B00009XN4C,The actor Gerard Butler is my favorite and his portrayal of the gangster Jackie Jr. in this film is right on target. Jackie is scary and dangerous one minute and oozing charm the next. He is the highlight of this movie for me but all of the performances are great. The viewer is dragged into the gritty underworld of a UK metropolis and dragged through many sordid episodes. Not for the squeamish but it is a dark study in crime and retribution.,1121990400,31,445,4.439024390243903
1896531,3,B00009XN4C,shooters isn't the best movie i've by a long shot but it was ok.  there was too much storyline and it was hard to follow.  there is a good performance by melanie lynskey.,1100476800,2,170,4.121212121212121

1896598,1,B00009XN4C,I didn't like the movie. Acting was lame. Story line was even lamer. Not at all what I was looking for.,1391558400,,103,3.9523809523809526
1896599,4,B00009XN4C,Very good movie. Not Butler's work but considering it was early in his career it is enjoyable to compare 'Shooters' to his more recent movies.,1388534400,,142,4.72

1896601,5,B00009XN4C,"Shooters is a very violent movie that is all heart. Gilly dominated the film. hard core, edged from prison time, still enchanted by his friend's wife. Butler in a great mood of flamboyance is like comic relief in this road going straight to hell with you caring for Gilly all the way to the bitter end. Great script. The ending was spot on in film's story.",1380326400,3,356,4.409090909090909

1896604,4,B00009XN4C,"I simply rented this movie and am glad I went that route rather than buying a cheap used disc. The movie is easily worth the rental price via Amazon but I would not personally want to add it to my video library.
Fairly well made and fairly well acted. Worthy of a rental but not worth purchasing....again in my humble opinion only.",1349740800,,331,4.354838709677419
1896605,4,B00009XN4C,"It takes a while to get into British crime thrillers, they are usually very different from those produced in the US.  I think the acting is outstanding, and the plot took a while to understand, but after watching it twice, I finally got it.  Just do not expect it to be American, and you will be fine.  I always turn the subtitles on, as otherwise, I miss some of the language.  I think it is a good B level flick.",1336003200,4,414,4.1375
1896606,3,B00009XN4C,"One of Gerry Butler's earlier movies. worth seeing and for his scenes. The film is a gritty crime drama along the lines of THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and a bit of reservoir dogs and rockabilly (dark scenes and humour).",1321920000,,211,4.578947368421052
1896607,1,B00009XN4C,"Well, I just didn't care for it; wouldn't watch it again and can't see recommending it.  LOTS of language, so have a strong stomache for it if you choose to watch it.",1308528000,,166,4.1875
1896608,2,B00009XN4C,"The DVD arrived in the advertised condition.

The movie itself was a typical English gangster movie with a lot of unecessary profanity and blustering, and as I said in the title ""Everybody Dies in a ""Shooters""
good (if you can identify any) and bad alike, except one.

1896612,5,B00009XN4C,I purchased this DVD for the sole purpose of seeing early Gerard Butler.  He was absolutely charming and at the same time disturbing (wish he had a bigger role).  I found the DVD a troubling reminder of the absolute violence associated with guns and drugs.,1202860800,2,256,4.666666666666667
1896613,3,B00009XN4C,I purchased this to see Gerard Butler.  NOT.  He is billed as he has recently become a big star (300).  He is barely in the movie.,1202169600,,130,3.923076923076923
1896614,1,B00009XN4C,I think this was one of the worse films I ever watched. Absolutely terrible. The film made absolutely little sense and was so poorly done and written had a ray of hope with Gerard Butler at the end. Yet even his performance was so small and poor you may as well don't even bother to waste your time and anyones on a film that was a total waste of time to begin with. Just plain terrible. Just say no.,1198972800,,400,4.075949367088608

1896616,4,B00009XN4C,"The movie starts a little slow, and it could be difficult for some americans to understand some of the thick accents, but the story is o.k.  Gerard Butler's character and his performance though is worth watching alone. He is Great!!!",1184198400,6,233,4.825
1896617,5,B00009XN4C,"Set in the London underworld of drugs and gun dealers. Gilly (Louis Dempsey) and 'J' (Andrew Howard) are two small-time gangsters who find themselves pawns in the games of big-time crime bosses and corrupt police. The dark and moving script is given life through the outstanding performances of everyone in the cast, especially Andrew Howard. He portrays `J' convincingly as a thoroughly sleazy and unredeemable guy. Louis Dempsey's Gilly, who wants to start a new life after he is released from prison, is hopelessly and frustratingly stuck in all the old patterns that landed him in jail in the first place. Dempsey as Gilly narrates the film, and his voice resonates with such profound sorrow and despair that you can hardly remain untouched by it.  Little by little these two friends break your heart and win your sympathy until, by the end of the film, you are desperately hoping there is some way out for them. Lots of violence, crude language, certainly not for children. I am not usually a fan of `gangster' movies, but this one is definitely worth seeing.",1158969600,7,1064,4.878453038674033

7994144,5,B00009XN4C,"It would be better to review a movie right after seeing it. It has been a week since watching it. My records show that it did have violence so I liked it. I also see that the picture was 1.85:1 so there was a tiny black bar on top and bottom. I also see that it was not 5.1 so it was not surround. It was only stereo so I just let the A/V decode with my preferential decoder.
I just discovered how to review. I won't remove from Watchlist until I review. All I have to do is skip to the end of all the reviews. After writing review I can then remove from Watchlist.
