8543163,3,B009NOVCME,"There is no one who is more of a fan of Herr Meyer than me. I love his style and appreciation of the more fuller figured female. I have all of his movies and when I saw this I was excited- 4 previous unavailable Meyer films to add to the collection and did not hesitate to buy. However, that's where the excitement ends. These films have no story line and are not movies of any kind and merely are documentaries that would appeal to nude model photographers of the time. kind of educational films on how to take photos and every now and then Herr Meyer appears amongst those photographers busily snapping away at typically 60s models which are not of the Meyer kind at all. Disappointing and in my opinion should not be classed as lost Meyer films.",1361404800,9,748,4.388489208633094

8543165,3,B009NOVCME,"It's been over a decade since the death of legendary independent film auteur Russ Meyer, and in that time fans of his work have suffered through frustratingly underwhelming and mediocre presentation of his home entertainment offerings.
Even though Blu-ray is the current state-of-the-art, Russ Meyer films are still only available on DVD (and Laserdisc and even VHS!) in standard-definition using decades-old transfers. This would be completely unacceptable to ""King Leer"" as he was known to take great pains to always present the highest-quality visual product to the public. The current managers of Russ Meyer's estate and legacy (the newly-named Russ Meyer Trust) are a controversial group who have been criticized by some fans and observers for their seemingly lazy approach to preserving Meyer's films and his place in cinematic history. One gets the impression that The Russ Meyer Trust is oddly unwilling or incapable of upgrading Russ Meyer's catalogue to 21st century standards.
Efforts by Arrow Films in the U.K. have provided some relief: attractive packaging and meaningful bonus features have livened up Russ Meyer on DVD, but offers from Arrow Films to the Russ Meyer Trust to upgrade Meyer's catalogue to high definition have strangely been rebuffed. In response, The Russ Meyer Trust explains that Russ Meyer fans are not their only consideration - there is the economics of Meyer's charity wishes to manage as well. It's possible the Russ Meyer Trust simply doesn't have the capital required to upgrade Meyer's movies, but what could be preventing them from accepting investors for this endeavour?  Perhaps the market demand for high-definition Russ Meyer doesn't make sufficient business sense.  We may be caught in a catch-22 situation - in order for The Russ Meyer Trust to survive we need more interest ($$$) in Meyer's movies, but we can't grow more interest in Meyer without the availability of high-definition Meyer product ($$$).  I wonder if the Will Ferrell movie ""Russ & Roger"" could renew the needed market to kick-start some sort of salvation plan?
Well now we have a rare new announcement and release from The Russ Meyer Trust: a four-movie, two-disc DVD set of Russ Meyer's early short films, made in 1960, 1961, and 1963. They're calling it ""Russ Meyer's Vintage Bodies Set"" and they're selling it for almost $50.00. As a Russ Meyer fan, this release is underwhelming but mildly welcomed news. These are indeed old, short, rare Russ Meyer pictures that do hold value in completing the span of his career releases, but this is not essential Russ Meyer. And this is not what Russ Meyer fans are craving.
It is my estimation that there are at least a dozen Russ Meyer movies that could truly breathe life into themselves and make waves again in the high definition era if they were given the proper investment, attention, and treatment. I can picture ""Supervixens"" in full 1080p glory in my mind's eye and I can't help but grin. But this is an expensive undertaking, and there's that matter of the Charitable Trust and it's strange economies....",1352937600,12,3075,5.073122529644269
8543166,5,B009NOVCME,"Why did it take so long to get these 4 films to DVD?  I've read that Russ Meyer didn't think these were good enough to release to home video.  Thank goodness his estate thought differently and finally put these out.  Everything is there.  Tongue in cheek narration.  The incredible editing.  The gorgeous cinematography and of course, those ladies.  These are the missing pieces in your RM library.  I love these films.  So daring at the time but so tame now.  Althea Currier rules! Russ only used her in 3 of his films.  That is a shame.  What a woman!  Bring back the nudie-cuties.",1352851200,7,583,4.543689320388349
