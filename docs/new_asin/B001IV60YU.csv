8311439,1,B001IV60YU,"There's no option to rent this video series. You can only purchase them...at $9.00 a video. I assumed that at such a price, this product would have to be of some value in order to be sold by Amazon. Here's where I made my mistake. I suffered through every painful, sickening second of this so-called writing workshop, looking for even one second of enjoyment -- or one point made that would be worthwhile. Sorry folks. There's nothing here but some woman reading in a monotone voice, with background noise (it's not music) and lots of very badly done visual effects that have nothing to do with writing. After 57 minutes of suffering, she finally gets around to saying something about the definition of a ""protagonist"" and an ""antagonist"" and by then, you want to kill yourself.

I gave it one star, because you have to click at least one star to be able to write your opinion.

AVOID THIS SERIES!",1396915200,,897,4.6
8311440,5,B001IV60YU,"Let me begin by stating that I am a produced writer with another film in development. Two of my other screenplays have been optioned.

I watched several of the DVDs and read the workbook and found them both to be packed with useful information that writers at any stage of their career can benefit from.

Perhaps what is most useful is the number of ideas that the course gives to stimulate your own imagination. It helps you come up with great ideas for stories and helps you to develop well-rounded characters and more interesting plots. For example, one of my favorite sections so far is the list of 142 plot twists that you can adapt for your own story. Any one of them, well-employed, can set your story off in a new and exciting direction. Imagine if you used a few more.

The  course covers so many of the essential elements of writing a great script: coming up with story ideas, creating memorable characters, how to effectively use the three act structure, where to place the major beats of your story (something that producers look for) and so much more.

I highly recommend this course. That's all for now. I want to go watch another one of the videos.",1295654400,4,1163,4.545454545454546
8311441,1,B001IV60YU,"I was trying to decide whether to buy these videos in DVD or use video on demand. I decided to watch the sample. Useless. It is nothing more than a promotion for how great the videos WILL be.
The woman (who does NOT have a voice for this sort of thing) tells us how digital videos can be made cheaply (duh) and film making has changed (double duh).
The woman hosting is a nice lady, I'm sure - but no voice over potential. Apparently she hosts the entire video set. If so, it will be very difficult to get through.
If the video has the same flow as the sample, apparently it's written for idiots and will be useless. There is no book or secret to a winning script. Everybody knows that. A crappy idea written in the best format will still be a crappy idea. I was hoping for a simple guide to help me get organized and put a working script together. According to the title, I don't think that was too much to hope for. If they can't even put together a winning video sample - what are the chances there is anything of value in the DVDs?",1283990400,,1035,4.154228855721393
8311442,5,B001IV60YU,"I am using this workbook to plan out a story that I have been working on for many years with tons on notes. I can say it works to organize your ideas. There are lots of areas as a writer I forget to think about sometimes. Just by going through all the exercises and questions I feel like I cover all the narrative idea bases. The story starts to snap into place like a puzzle after awhile with all the brainstorming lists working together. I have found that this process works best if you answer the questions in order, but leave space to come back later to add ideas as they pop up.

Now whenever I get an idea, I just go to that page in my workbook and add it then all the ideas stay organized! This Writing A Great Script Fast class has change the way tI organize my screenplay ideas in a huge way.

The lists of brainstorming ideas art each step make coming up with a specific story idea for own screenplay much easier than any other kind of writing class I have taken.",1277769600,3,973,4.170212765957447
