4235098,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"I recieved my dvd today and watched the whole thing. It is wonderful and I can't wait to use it tomorrow. It is the best in my large collection. It does have a beautiful calming set. Kia's voice is calm and soothing. The yoga sets are real kundalini, long enough and challanging. The kriyas are wonderful. Approxamately 3 hrs of wonderfulness. I just feel this is real real kundalini like a class would be if one could afford them, which I can't. The meditaion sections are excellent. I feel this dvd and her other one, which I will buy are the one's I will use for the rest of my life.  Keep them coming, please. Thank you and Namaste.",1292457600,7,636,4.34453781512605
4235099,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"I just finished doing this dvd this morning and my initial reaction was Wow! I feel great.  I own about 25 kundalini yoga dvds. Almost all of Raviana's dvds and a set of live classes from noted teacher Gurmukh.  However, I am always on the look out for well produced, inspiring kundalini yoga dvds.  This one and Kia's other dvd Sun Energy are now at the top of my list for 2 of the best KY dvds I own. What's special about this dvd is that it has hatha and kundalini yoga practices.  I find that when I just do hatha yoga I miss the rhythmic movement of kundalini yoga.  On the other hand, when I just do KY I miss the stretchiness of hatha yoga.  What a treat to have both on one dvd.

From the dvd menu:

Yoga Sets:
Quick energizer set (15:16)
Surya C Series (26:29)
Abdominal  Strengthening Kriya (53:47)

Setting:  Yoga studio with hardwood floors.  Soft lighting.  Kia is in voiceover.
Music:  OMG.  This is the first KY dvd where the music is great and goes perfectly with the poses.  The music is provided by Aykanna.  It consists of vocals, instrumental and percussion.  For me, one of the best parts of a KY class is the rhythmic music.  It helps you to keep up, and focus your mind.  The music can be found on spiritvoyage website.

Yoga Set 1: Quick Energizer Set is a kundalini yoga kriya that includes tuning in, stretch pose, ego eradicator, nose to knee pose a couple of others all done to breath of fire.

Yoga Set 2: Surya C Series is the a hatha yoga set that includes, cat/cow, moving cat cat/cow, sun salute c, a couple of twists, 2 simple backbends and forward bend.  It really helps to open you up for the abs kriya that follows.

Yoga Set 3:  Abdominal Strengthening kriya is a kundalini set that you may have seen before on the Raviana abs dvd.  It includes leg lifts, stretch pose, king cobra, bow pose, spinal rocking, standing side stretching, standing twisting, boat post and sat kriya.  What's different from Raviana is that the poses are done for the maximum times.  Kia encourages you to work up the maximum times.

Each set is designed to be done on its own.  Both KY sets tune in and end with savasana.  The hatha yoga set begins with setting an intention and ends with savasana.  You can do all 3 sets by tuning in once and fast forwarding thru the tuning in of the other sets.  There is no matrix. After each set the dvd defaults back to the main menu.

Bonus meditation: Lion's claws. (11:00) Again this meditation can be found on the Raviana Radiance dvd, BUT what makes this one better for me at least, is the music by Aykanna ""Beautiful and I"" The actual meditation is putting your hands in lion's claws and moving the arms from parallel to crossed above your head for about 9 minutes.  After about 3 minutes of this my mind was screaming stop this now, but I kept up, mostly because of the wonderful music.

The teacher:  Kia Miller is a certified hatha and kundalini yoga teacher.  She gives very clear and precise instructions.  She also has an amazing spirit that comes through the camera.

So in conclusion, you may be thinking why should I get this dvd when I have so many others? Well I thought that too, but after doing the sets this morning I am glad I purchased this well produced, well thought out dvd.  The music was outstanding.  Kia is wonderful and I felt happier afterwards.  Money well spent! Thanks Kia.",1290038400,12,3361,4.414355628058727
4235100,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"I bought the Core Energy DVD and just had to have the Sun Energy DVD as well.  This did not disappoint and is just as versatile and beneficial as Core Energy.

I particularly love that Kia describes the advantages of each posture and exercise and helps you understand why it is beneficial.  It is clear that she knows what she is talking about and if you trust and follow along you will receive such powerful benefits.  I would even venture to say that you could find postive change in all areas of your life if you incorporate even just five minutes of this video into your life every day.

Kia divides the segments into varying lengths so you can do just one at a time for 5-15 minutes or you can link a few together to make a challenging 1 or 1.5 hour class.  If you are a beginner or an advanced student you can do this video and will enjoy Kia's straightforward direction and really effortless teaching style.",1289692800,4,914,4.378698224852071
4235101,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"This DVD, along with Kia's Sun Energy video is amazing!  If you are not fortunate enough to attend Kia's classes this is a great way to bring her into your own living room.

8410664,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"love this video. Kia Miller is a fantastic teacher, & I love how there are 3 separate sets which you can combine if you have more time. There are several short breath meditations which are great stress reduction tools. All in all very practical & useful video.",1421020800,3,260,4.553191489361702
8410665,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"This DVD was my first yoga class and I have purchased several others since. I took the advice of the instructor, (Kia Miller), and I practiced the 26 minute Surya C Series for 40 days. I am amazed how much flexibility I have gained and how much my range of motion has improved. In my opinion this is a perfect morning routine and I look forward to it each day. Kia's beautiful, soothing voice is another benefit which has a way of relaxing you.
  I picked this DVD based on Amazon reviews and am happy to provide this 5 star review. Glenn Jurczyk",1394236800,2,546,4.29126213592233
8410666,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"I just recently discovered Kia Miller.  What an amazing instructor and she has that perfect demeanor; very soothing, warm, cultured voice.  Although Core Energy has several practices on it, along with a bonus meditation, I see myself using the Abdominal Strengthening practice the most.  I was amazed at how peaceful and blissful I was after finishing this 54-minute set.  Even though I have been doing Kundalini at home for a while, I found the amount of repetitions challenging, but I think the challenge is what produces all of those lovely endorphins.  This DVD also has such a wonderful ambience:  Simple but lovely setting; beautiful, appropriate music; and excellent filming/editing.  My only disappointment is that it turned out to be a DVD-r (burned) rather than a pressed DVD.  This is not mentioned in the main description.  Given that DVD-r can degrade and be ruined more easily, this issue concerns me.  The price of the DVD is also rather high given this fact.  The case is a cardboard slipcover, which I know is considered more eco-friendly, but I feel my DVDs are better protected and more easily handled in a plastic case.  However, my impression of Kia Miller is extremely positive and I hope she comes out with more workouts.",1360281600,4,1244,4.927884615384615
8410667,4,B003ZN6VGQ,"This DVD has a variety of combinations you can put together. i liked that some were short, 15 minutes, for a quick morning workout while others were longer for more extended routines. I would not consider it for beginners but is a great DVD for the next level.",1357084800,,260,4.4375
8410668,4,B003ZN6VGQ,"Just to let you know, this is a DVD-R and not a pressed DVD, it that should matter to you.  Just thought for the price, it should have been a pressed DVD instead of a copy.",1356307200,7,172,3.7777777777777777
8410669,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"Though the yoga practice is great, both of her DVDs are really DVD-Rs if that should matter to you.  I thought for the price, it would be a pressed DVD instead of a copy.",1356307200,3,170,4.0
8410670,5,B003ZN6VGQ,I love this DVD!  Been doing this form of yoga for years with Donna Davidge(Awakening-LOVE HER TOO!) and wanted to expand my library.  This is exactly what I needed. Doing the Lion's Paw meditation gets me smiling every time.  A real winner!  Thank you Kia Miller!,1352419200,,264,4.673913043478261
8410671,1,B003ZN6VGQ,"I bought this solely based on the other rave reviews. It arrived on time but in a paper sleeve vs. a DVD case. For $20 I want a case that isn't going to eventually fall apart or scratch the DVD.

So I watched it first before trying it out. There are 3 yoga sections (23-30 minutes in length) and 3 guided breathing/meditation sections (4-7 minutes) I didn't watch any of the breathing exercises

The yoga sections could hardly  be called that. Almost half of the time she's just sitting there, breathing and telling you to figure out what your purpose for the exercise is. There was only 1 section out of the 3 supposed 'yoga' sections where it wasn't completely about breathing, and the poses were overly simplistic and minimal at best. I'm not even that flexible and I thought this was a waste. I've been practicing yoga (at time of this review) for about a month.

Her voice is British and annoying

The music is even more annoying

I brought my yoga n00b friend over to see what she thought and if it'd be at her level to start practicing with. If she did, I would have merely given the DVD to her but she also thought it was retarded and boring.

I'd recommend David Swenson, Gurmukh, or Patricia Walden. They are actually good instructors that seem more grounded in reality than this chick. I am returning this DVD because no one I know wants it.

I think one of the other reviews is fake, seeing as there are only rave reviews for Kia Miller, and nothing else.",1333152000,8,1467,4.4275092936802976
8410672,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"I have both of Kia Miller's DVDs and I love them both. This one is especially wonderful. Sometimes , I do not do the complete set, only one or two. I especially love and benifit from Surya Kriya and do it over and over, it is my favorite. I may begin it anxious and finish relaxed and feeling in love with life! Kia is straightforward, her voice so pleasant. The music is soothing and the meditations are long enough. I await more DVDs from her, please...AM/PM pretty please",1314835200,4,474,4.3977272727272725
8410673,5,B003ZN6VGQ,"I can not recommend this and Ms Miller's second dvd Core Energy enough. I'm relatively new to yoga and have been blessed to find these 2 indispensable and incredibly supportive and inspiring works. With them I have found the focus to create my own practice, something I've been searching for for a very long time.

Her concise and informative explanations and warmth of personality give real encouragement. The various lengths of practice are very helpful also, so that on those days when time seems to be in short supply, the 15 minutes energy booster, for example is perfect and does exactly what it promises!

Thank you!

Namaste x",1305590400,,634,4.851851851851852
