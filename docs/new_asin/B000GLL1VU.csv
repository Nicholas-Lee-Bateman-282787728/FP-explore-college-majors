8133379,1,B000GLL1VU,"The original version of this film is an expansive epic of something like 3 hours and 40 minutes; this version gives you 100 minutes (1 hour and 40 minutes) so more of the film was cut out than left in!  It shows too, in the resulting viewing experience.  This version is choppy, doesn't make a lot of sense and makes the whole production look amateurish and completely miscast.

The full version allows you to experience the life of Ernest Hemingway, whatever good or bad that may involve.  He was a man who lived life hard and reflected it in his writings.  In this edited version, you don't ever even see him writing!  All the passion and emotion of the original is gone, and the power of Victor Garber's performance is totally lost.

I would love to see Beverly Hills Video release the complete version of this film, and I would gladly pay more for it than what is being charged for this shadow of a film.  C'mon, BHV, do the right thing and do it over!",1168128000,18,956,4.392045454545454
