722139,4,6303891357,"This is a great dvd.  The picture is so cozy.  Tells how Christmas is not only for presents but of God's biggest gift to us, Jesus.  Great family film for anytime of the year.",1202342400,4,175,4.088235294117647
722140,5,6303891357,"I got this movie for my 4 year old son and I felt it really accurately captured what the true meaning of Christmas should be in a way a young child can understand.  It is truly a keeper and a great choice among the so many other secular videos available. We've watched it together many times. The length is perfect, just long enough to hold his attention and the content is excellent. This movie should definitely be a part of every Christian's Christmas movie collection.",1199059200,2,472,4.552941176470588
722141,5,6303891357,Red Boots for Christmas is one of my favorite Christmas stories.  I like it as well as any animated or non-animated Christmas story.  It not only reminds us of the real meaning of Christmas but the diversity of feelings that Christmas brings to many people.  I make a point of watching it every Christmas since the first time I saw it.,1164585600,,335,4.459016393442623
722142,5,6303891357,I remember seeing this for the first time on TV. The story behind this DVD truly touched my heart! I was so happy to see that I could buy it. This is a family classic that will touch your heart!,1118966400,18,194,3.875
722143,5,6303891357,"I happened to work at a local television station the year Red Boots for Christmas premiered.  So I made a point of watching the show, and boy was I surprised.  Not many of the newer Christmas animated shows have held up to my picky nature, but Red Boots does.
The video and the book are now traditions in our family, right up there with Charlie Brown and Rudolph.",1007769600,3,363,4.323529411764706
722144,5,6303891357,This was one of the best Christmas movies that I ever got the chance to let my daughter see.  It really portrays what the real meaning of Christmas is.  Even if you are a stingy child you learn to give a little of yourself.,1006041600,2,223,4.045454545454546
722145,5,6303891357,I love to collect christmas movies for my son. I happen to see this movie a couple of days ago on the fox family channel. This movie was so good!

722217,3,6303891357,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. We both remember watching this as children, and she was so excited to get it! However, I can't give it 5 stars, as it's actually a DVD-R, not a DVD. My player won't play DVD-Rs at all, so if you don't have a player that can read them, you'll be out of luck. Thankfully my friend's DVD player can read and play DVD-Rs, so it didn't affect her. Just wanted to note that for anyone who is interested! Otherwise it was in good condition when I received it.",1470873600,,490,4.061855670103093
722218,5,6303891357,"Great movie. If you love the little Christmas villages featured in malls and stores around the holidays, you will love this movie. It's set back to the same time period, the ideal Christmas nostalgia: snow everywhere. Little stores and cottages. Bundled up and cheerful townspeople etc.

And you have a great message about Christ.",1468540800,,330,5.111111111111111

722274,5,6303891357,"Because of the clear message of Jesus Christ at Christmas time as to age related that children could understand.  It was presented
in a different way as to some of the other Christian Christmas stories such as Veggie Tale",1390176000,,221,4.666666666666667
722275,4,6303891357,I read the book to my daughter and she wanted to see the video.  A heart-warming Christmas message on the true meaning of the season.  She liked it.,1388707200,,148,4.25

722278,5,6303891357,This simple little cartoon carries such a powerful message.  I indeed tell the story of the true meaning of Christmas - Jesus Christ came to save us from our sins.  Please consider renting this video.  It is well worth it.,1355961600,2,222,4.5
722279,5,6303891357,"I am from Germany, so I like the ""Bavarian"" village setting of the story, and that there is no Santa figure.  It's a sweet story of neighbors helping neighbors, and sharing God's love and message of hope for mankind.",1353196800,2,216,4.538461538461538
722340,3,6303891357,"Nice message to this movie, however, the kids didn't seem to like it near as well as ""jingle Bells"" or ""Annabel's Wish""",1353024000,,119,4.454545454545454

722342,5,6303891357,I showed this at a Christmas assembly for my school.  Kids from Kindergarten to Grade 8 were in attendance. All of them enjoyed the story.  It'a good DVD to show any age group.  There are many teachable moments throughout the character development of the story. The DVD also comes with discussion questions if you choose do them.,1324598400,,329,4.7368421052631575
722343,5,6303891357,"This video is truly a great video to watch at Christmas time. The theme is the real meaning of Christmas, that is Christ coming to us as our Savior. He is the most beautiful gift there is. Children will learn the meaning of sharing gifts at Christmas and will really understand that Christmas is about Jesus coming to us. It is about 30 minutes, it has 3 language tracks (English, French and Spanish) and will appeal to children of all ages. I highly recommend this video!",1291161600,2,472,4.5
722344,5,6303891357,A story for all ages.  I could watch it over and over again.,1269388800,3,60,3.6153846153846154
722345,5,6303891357,"This is our family's favorite Christmas movie. It gets right at the true meaning of Christmas with a story of greed vs. giving. It's a bit like the Christmas Carol where an angel visit a grumpy ""bah humbug"" kind of man and then he sees the true light-our Savior. What I like most about this movie and it stays true to scripture with how Christians are saved-by God's grace alone. It's a wonderful way to help children understand Christmas isn't about the gifts. I think it's around 30 minutes. The story is very well written and the animation is truly charming.",1257292800,,561,4.564356435643564

722347,4,6303891357,"""Red Boots for Christmas"" was a hit for my elementary and preschool students.  The story makes the audience think about their values at Christmas.  It demonstrates anger because of past experience and the selfishness of a spoiled child.  It also shows the compassion of a woman who seems to have nothing on the outside, but has great love on the inside because of her love for Jesus.  This was a good choice for me.",1230422400,,415,4.5675675675675675
722348,5,6303891357,This is just a phenominal production for families to watch together before Christmas to help kids understand what it is we are actually celebrating. We've had the vhs movie for a few years but the best thing about the dvd is that we keep it in the van during the months of November and December and the kids watch it on the dvd player many times during the weeks leading up to Christmas. It's a wholesome Christian video that beautifully proclaims the gospel.,1226361600,,459,4.542168674698795
