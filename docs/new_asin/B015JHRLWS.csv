7441860,4,B015JHRLWS,"I love the Tardis speaker.  It charges quickly with the USB cable.  The instructions say it should be able to hook up with your computer if attached by the USB cable, but I have only been able to get it to connect to my aging 2008 MacBook Pro by using the Bluetooth connection.  It pairs excellently with my iPhone and iPad also.  A total treat for this Whovian.

In a comment to another post I listed all the episodes included in the three disk set, and I am repeating this info below as it is not included in the item information by Amazon.  I am giving this only 4 stars because the DVD set arrived with the middle piece to one of the DVD holders half broken, making it impossible to securely stow one of them when not in use.  All three DVD's were loose in the case on arrival but fortunately not scratched and all played well.

7441865,5,B015JHRLWS,"Amazing set with great speaker. The speaker alone retains for $90-$100 so if you're considering buying the Christmas specials or the speaker it's well forth it.
The set does not have the 9th Doctors special, perhaps they assume people already have it if they own Series 1. Otherwise it's a great set. Perfect for a holiday marathon while waiting for this years special.
Now If only they had a River Song boxed set to make my binge watching easier.",1449273600,33,447,4.670886075949367
7441866,5,B015JHRLWS,"Last year at holiday shopping time I was lamenting that the Christmas specials for Doctor Who had never made it to DVD format.  I asked around at different venues and was always told, ""The Christmas episodes were never put onto DVD or video.  Sorry.""

Well, apparently, someone was taking notes regarding the holiday specials, because NOW the Christmas episodes are available in a set of their own!  I jumped on this as soon as I received the email for pre-orders.  I was also tickled because this set includes the twelfth doctor's sonic screwdriver!  I also noticed that the DVD set is available in retail stores as of this past weekend, but WITHOUT the sonic screwdriver!

My fianc is going to be so surprised when he gets this at Christmas!",1449187200,,743,4.713178294573644
7441867,5,B015JHRLWS,This is a lovely little set and for the price it's great. The sonic is amazing and so are the blu rays. A great collection to have for any whovian. Plus the packaging is awesome as well.,1448409600,3,186,4.054054054054054
7441868,5,B015JHRLWS,"This is really cool. You get all of the christmas specials and a sonic screwdriver of the 12 doctor. It's 4 discs and it comes in a cool box. Great for every Doctor Who Fan and collector. Even though if you have all the seasons of Doctor Who with these christmas episodes it's still a great buy. On Disc 1 is The Christmas Invasion The Runaway Bride Voyage Of The Damned/On Disc 2 you have The Next Doctor The End Of Time parts 1&2/On disc 3 you have A Christmas Carol The Doctor, The Widow And The Wardrobe The Snowmen/On Disc 4 you have The Time Of The Doctor Last Christmas The Bonus Feature: Ten Christmases. The cover on Disc 1 is the cover of the box. The cover on Disc 2 has the 10th doctor David Tennant in the Tardis. The cover on Disc 3 has the 11th doctor Matt Smith in the Tardis. The cover on Disc 4 has the 12th doctor Peter Capaldi in the Tardis. Running time is 692 mins approx. 16:9 Animorphic and Subtitles English SDH. On the back of the box are pictures from the Christmas episodes you have a christmas tree The Daleks The Master and more. The Sonic Screwdriver is pretty cool you could just buy the screwdriver but this way you'll have a DVD with all the christmas episodes from 2005-2014. You get the DVD and the sonic screwdriver comes in this cool plastic box that tells you about the dvd and how the screwdriver is included. This would be a great christmas gift for any kid who is a Doctor Who Fan and for any Doctor Who fan. This is one great deal.",1448323200,9,1474,4.212014134275618
7441869,4,B015JHRLWS,"If you're a long-time Doctor Who fan, you may have all these Christmas Specials already. But you may not have a sonic screwdriver! The screwdriver included in this set is the model used by the Twelfth Doctor. It's a little different from an older model we have. But it looks identical to a 12th Doctor version that's been available for about a year:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Who-Doctor-Who-12th-Doctor-s-Sonic-Screwdriver-Peter-Capaldi-With-Lights-and-Sounds/dp/B00M8BKNK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Who - Doctor Who 12th Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver - Peter Capaldi - With Lights and Sounds</a>

This Christmas Special giftset is also being issued in Region 2, but instead of a sonic screwdriver, Region 2 gets five Doctor Who Christmas cards and a booklet. If you go to the BBC official Doctor Who site, they have Doctor Who Christmas cards that you can print out for yourself.

The discs have one Bonus Feature ""Ten Christmases"". This featurette is presented by Rufus Hound, which means it has a comedic bent. Rufus is a comedian and also starred as a happy highwayman in the Series 9 episode, ""The Woman Who Lived"".  Peter Capaldi and Steven Moffat also comment, as Rufus asks, ""What makes a Doctor Who Christmas so special?""

There are 10 Specials in this set totaling about 685 minutes. Technically there's 11 episodes, because one special has two parts. English SDH subtitles are available. Russell T. Davies wrote the first 5 specials and Steven Moffat the last 5.

1. ""The Christmas Invasion"" (1st aired Dec. 2005, with David Tennant) The Doctor has just regenerated and is very sick. Rose and her mom, Jackie, take him home and put him to bed while he recovers his wits. Which is why the Doctor spends most of this episode in pajamas and a bathrobe. But he still bests a horde of murderous Santa Clauses and saves Earth. again.

2. ""The Runaway Bride"" (Dec 2006, David Tennant) Donna Noble is going to marry Lance, her dream man. But halfway down the walk to the church altar, she is enveloped by a glowing mass and transported to  the TARDIS. The Doctor doesn't know what to do with her, but he has to rescue her when Santas from last year return. It's funny, but Donna doesn't know about the lethal Santas because she slept through the Christmas Invasion. But who or what is running the Santas now?

3. ""Voyage of the Damned"" (Dec 2007, David Tennant) The Doctor is shipwrecked on the Titanic. Not the original, but a luxury tourist spaceship orbiting Earth. After his psychic paper keeps him from being thrown in the brig as a stowaway, he sets out to have a little fun. He meets Astrid, a waitress who wants to visit the galaxies, and you sense a new companion in the offing. But it all goes desperately wrong when the ship is deliberately sabotaged. If you don't die from the explosions, you die from the murdering robot angels.
This is my 2nd favorite of these Christmas Specials. Courage comes in all shapes and sizes.

4. ""The Next Doctor"" (Dec 2008, David Tennant) The Doctor is answering a cry for help in London, Christmas Eve 1851, when he meets - another Doctor!  The other Doctor even has a TARDIS  a Tethered Aerial Release Developed In Style. Together they fight off yet another Cybermen invasion.

5. ""The End of Time: Part 1 & 2"" (Dec/Jan 2009/2010, David Tennant) Lucy Saxon has been in jail since murdering her husband (the Master) in ""Last of the Time Lords"" (Series 3). She's freed by the Master's disciples and is used, to her horror, to resurrect him on Christmas Eve. The regeneration is dramatically interrupted, though, leaving the Master with amazing powers, unfillable hunger and, it's hardly possible, even greater megalomania than before.

6. ""A Christmas Carol"" (Dec 2010, Matt Smith) Kazran Sardick inherited his father's loan shark business and owns most of the planet. This includes holding relatives of debtors as hostages, held in cryogenic chambers. His father was a cold ruthless man, and Kazran won't admit that he could be any different. Can the Doctor rescue this man from himself?
This was a tear-jerker episode for me, with no usual sci-fi monsters or bad guys. It's also the episode where the Doctor gets engaged to Marilyn Monroe.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-A-Christmas-Carol/dp/B004FUYSV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: A Christmas Carol</a>

7. ""The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe"" (Dec 2011, Matt Smith) Madge Arwell does a good deed for a stranded spaceman on Christmas Eve 1938. In return, he reappears at Christmas 1941 to spend Christmas with Madge and her two kids. She is determined it will be a splendid Christmas, even though she's just been notified that her husband, WWII pilot, has disappeared with his plane over the English Channel. The Doctor, erstwhile stranded spaceman, gives the family a big gift, a huge box, the entrance to another world. And danger. He didn't see that coming.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Doctor-The-Widow-and-the-Wardrobe/dp/B006MVKMTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe</a>

8. ""The Snowmen"" (Dec 2012, Matt Smith) The Doctor roams Victorian England, depressed over the loss Amy and Rory. Then he meets the intrepid and insistent Clara Oswald and starts taking notice of the world around him again. Good thing. Because snowmen are appearing all over London  and they eat people.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Snowmen/dp/B00CENXWA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Snowmen</a>

9. ""The Time of the Doctor"" (Dec 2013, Matt Smith) A strange message is being broadcast across the universe from an insignificant planet with an insignificant village named Christmas. Thousands of ships from many races have surrounded the planet, when the Doctor and Clara are beamed down to investigate. (Beamed down? I must be confusing my  shows.) Christmas is surrounded by a truth field, which is way above the pay scale of the village inhabitants. So who is broadcasting the message and field, why, and to what nefarious purpose?
This is the 800th episode of Dr. Who, and Matt Smith's last. It answers Whovians' most important question at the time: If the Doctor has used all of his 12 regenerations, how will they plausibly bring on another Doctor?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Time-of-the-Doctor/dp/B00HCK7THS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Time of the Doctor</a>

10. ""Last Christmas"" (Dec 2014, Peter Capaldi) At the North Pole, a group of scientists are beset by telepathic face grabbers. It's a good thing the Doctor and Clara arrive to help. Isn't it? Well, then, it's a good thing Santa Claus arrives to help.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Last-Christmas/dp/B00QHND1BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Last Christmas</a>

7441905,4,B015JHRLWS,"This set provides us with  several of the 'Christmas' Specials.  Six involving the tenth Doctor, played by David Tennant.  These were not in of themselves specials.  Written primarily by producer  Russel T. Davies.  Then four involving the eleventh Doctor played by Matt Smith.  Written by producer Steven Moffatt.  These were the episodes that I enjoyed the most.  And one  with the twelfth Doctor Peter Capaldi.
I must state this one was named 'The Last Christmas' and by the dullness of it probably will be the last special.
As a bonus feature it has a completely lame and very unfunny special about the specials, with Rufus Hound, who evidently played a small part in one episode.
I bought this on the Amazon Yearly Special Buys day.  And so also received a 'Sonic Screwdriver'.  I have yet to use it as it requires batteries,
and it seems the people of Gallifrey also are forced to have their products manufactured in China.
Three great episodes, seven good episodes, one dull one, and a bonus not worth watching again.  But hey, A SONIC Screwdriver!",1468972800,2,1055,4.794444444444444

7441918,5,B015JHRLWS,"Great set, as described it comes with only the Christmas Specials (well and the only New Year's Special that is the second part of the xmas special that was the swang song of the 10th Doctor).
The episodes included are
-The Christmas Invasion (10th Doctor)
-The Runaway Bride (10th Doctor)
-Voyage of the Damned (10th Doctor)
-The Next Doctor (10th Doctor)
-The End of Time Part 1 (10th Doctor)
-The End of Time Part 2 (10th Doctor)
-A Christmas Carol (11th Doctor)
-The Doctor, The Widow, and the Wardrobe (11th Doctor)
-The Snowmen (11th Doctor)
-The Time of the Doctor (11th Doctor)
-Last Christmas (12th Doctor)

The episodes at least visually and in sound have no difference with the releases before this (the 10th Doctor Episodes on the bluray set that has all the episodes until the 7th Series includes all his episodes and i see no difference with those, and the others have been released in separate ways or as part of the Series set)
The only new extra here is a brief (20 minutes maximum) of a british celebrity revising the xmas adventures of the Doctor. (a brief version of this extra was already avaible on internet).
The great plus here is theBluetooth TARDIS. It makes sound when the devices connects, disconnects, when the TARDIS is turned on it makes the sound of the TARDIS materializing. It has a great power speaker and the light on top illuminates when turned on. I thought the size of the TARDIS was like a bluray box like the image makes us think, but it's a lot bigger on the outside (fans will get this) than a bluray box. So for collector's it's a perfect oportunity to get a TARDIS and even better a TARDIS Bluetooth Speaker.",1462147200,3,1653,4.603389830508474

7441962,5,B015JHRLWS,"2015 was the year I suddenly became really crazy about Doctor Who - I had always watched the show but somehow just became very much more of a fanatic. I had to have a Tardis, and when I saw that this speaker not only functioned as a bluetooth accessory but also made the famous Tardis sounds - well, naturally I had to have it. At $69 to get the speaker plus the Christmas Blu-Ray set is a great deal. I haven't watched the Blu-Rays yet, but I am very much looking forward to it. The speaker works great with my iPhone, connects right away and plays music / podcasts / audiobooks. The quality is good, if you're looking for Bose level quality, this isn't the one for you, but it is a step up from my previous speakers. The volume output is quite good. Now for the famous Tardis sounds - when you turn it on you will hear the ""materialize"" sound, there is a ""we're in trouble"" sound while pairing, and the Cloister Bell gongs when the speaker is connected to your bluetooth device. These sounds are LOUD and you have no control over it, as another fellow said, don't turn on this on when someone is sleeping in the next room! Also when the speaker is not in use, after a few minutes the ""Dematerialize"" sound happens and this is also loud - when my wife heard this the first time (not a Doctor Who fan) she said what the heck was that? Even more funny is the ""Turbulence"" sound that occurs when the speaker is low on power, I heard that clear across the house and knew something was wrong! On a full charge the speaker seems to last between 8 and 10 hours. I have had it for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it.",1452384000,9,1617,4.202572347266881
7441963,5,B015JHRLWS,What's not to love? It's the Doctor. The TARDIS that came with it is an object of contention as all of us want to steal it from my husband.,1452384000,,139,3.8275862068965516

7441965,5,B015JHRLWS,Tardis peaker was bigger than anticipated and is fantastic. Great value with this set as the speaker alone retails for $120 then throw in the Christmas specials blu ray set and it's a steal for $70.,1452211200,,198,4.527777777777778
7441966,5,B015JHRLWS,"Bought for my Whovians to watch on the drive from Richmond to Tampa last week for Christmas.  They LOVED it and it kept them entertained the entire drive.  They are 14 & 17, but I know younger kids are fans as well.  The only challenge would have been distribution of the 12th Doctor sonic screwdriver - but the ever alert big sister snagged it and hid the box before the prize was discovered by the hapless little brother.",1451606400,,423,4.397435897435898
7441967,5,B015JHRLWS,"This was a gift for my niece, and I was told ""this is the best gift ever"".  She loved it.  She takes her sonic screwdriver everywhere, and is very discriminate as to who gets to hold it.  The videos have been watched over and over even though she has seen them on tv numerous times.  The kid is a total Doctor Who geek.",1451433600,,319,4.015873015873016

I can not seem to get the speaker to work again.. when i flip the switch to on it doesn't make the sound of the tardis anymore to let you know it is looking... my cellphone that used to be able to find it under blue tooth is not working... annndd tried to hook it up to windows 7 blue tooth no luck... so used the red cords that came with it.. placed the cord into the headphone jack still no sign of life other than the green light on the back.  Sometimes when i hold down i believe is the phone icon the computer will make a sound like it will pick it up but still does not work....

If anyone knows how to get this to work please let me know!!!
