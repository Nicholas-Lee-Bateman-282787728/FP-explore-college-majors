8401837,5,B003P2O21I,"I finally bought the entire series of 10 DVDs (Green Valley, Victorian Farm, Edwardian Farm & Pharmacy, etc,)  from Amazon.uk
You will need an international 4 - zone DVD player, about $70.
Prof. Ruth Goodman and her supporting crew offer accurate and fascinating displays of the demands and skills required for British farming life from 1620 to the late Edwardian age.
The physical demands of pre-industrial farm work and the generally unclean conditions of life, explain the much shorter life expectancy of farm families before 1910. Few lived beyond age 60.
Happily, the farm life portrayed excludes aristocratic tyranny, natural disasters, famine, illness and disabling bodily harm.
Goodman's portrayals of farm life over the previous 400 years offer educational and delightful enjoyment.  Strongly recommended.",1368403200,6,814,5.556451612903226
