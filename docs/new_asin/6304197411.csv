I looked everywhere for th lyrics to the theme song, so I thought I'd just type it out and post them just incase someone else is looking for them.

What's little on top and big in the middle and pink all over?
The answer to the riddle is my friend serendipity, the pink dinosaur.
Serendipity doo serendipity dee
Wow, what a wonderful world we'd have, if we all could be
Loving and caring, giving and sharing, like my friend serendipity
 Serendipity doo serendipity dee
Everyone everywhere could have fun, if we all agree
 To live and let live, learn how to give, like my friend serendipity
Serendipity doo serendipity dee
I love serendipity and she loves me.",1272672000,2,748,4.398550724637682
808434,5,6304197411,"This movie left an impact on me.
Years and years ago when I was but a child, I had it on VHS and would watch it often.

Then, recently, I had a dream about it. I woke up and instantly wrote down the name Serendipity, before I could forget. I looked it up and found the theme song on YouTube and it brought me back! I decided to order the VHS again and watch it for the nostalgia.

I ordered it for about $7, and watched it the day it came. This movie is amazing! I never really understood what was going on as a child, and I am extremely lucky to have rediscovered it! This could have been in theaters and became a huge hit! The animation is irresistible, and the plot is fun and exciting!

I really hope there is a DVD release some day! This movie shouldn't go to waste, it's such a gem. I strongly recommend it. Yes, I am 24 years old and very much enjoyed it.",1267833600,4,862,4.0
808435,5,6304197411,"I was looking for this manga since long time!! :) It used to watch it when i was 5-6 years old. I didn't know the original name of it, so it was difficult to find it. But it is only in video. Please put it in DVD, it is different from other cartoons and i think it is great for children! I am sure there are adults who would enjoy watching this manga, like me :) I want to get it but I prefer to buy it in DVD!!

Last if all, I am agree; the cover is not the same as in the original one. I have found the original cover on a web site in which characters are represented in their true nature ;)",1147132800,3,593,3.7063492063492065
808436,5,6304197411,"What you might not have been aware of when you first watched this film: it was Japanese in origin.  This film actually is a compilation of a few episodes of ""Serendipity Monogatari Yori: Pure Shima no Nakamatachi"" (The Story of Serendipity: Friends of Pure Island), a TV series which aired in Japan in 1983.  It was around six years later that the compilation was dubbed into English and released in the U.S. by Celebrity Home Entertainment.  I had been under the impression that the show was conceived in America and the animation farmed out to a Japanese studio (since creator Stephen Cosgrove is American), but that isn't so.  (Also, Bobby's name in the original version was ""Corna."")

The basic story: Bobby's scientist parents have taken him along on an expedition to the South Pole.  An iceburg breaks apart and separates Bobby from his parents, and Bobby ends up floating out to sea and landing on the lush, tropical Paradise Island, along with a large egg... from which hatches Serendipity.  The inhabitants of the island, which is governed by Laura the mermaid princess, are initially hostile toward Bobby (distrustful of humans, if I remember correctly), but warm up to him after he helps them defend the island from the vile Captain Smudge.  The most memorable character for me is Peela-Peela (sp?), a large parrot of sorts who serves as the source of a lot of comic relief.  At one point in the film, Peela-Peela goes on trial for something (stealing fruit?), and both Serendipity and Bobby have to testify against their friend, who is put in chains as punishment - a lesson about the integrity of the justice system.

As I recall, the dialogue and the dubbing, in the English version at least, were pretty well done.  And there are songs too, most of which tend to be somewhat corny (but this film is for kids; don't expect ""American Pie""), with the exception of one, a ballad with sort of a Caribbean/island feel, sung by a female vocalist about ""Paradise."" Having never read the books, I can't testify as to how faithful the film is to Cosgrove's original story, but as a stand-alone piece, this movie is good entertainment for young children.  Noticing that it was re-released on video in 1996, I think it's about time this film made it to DVD, especially since the books are still available and since anime has never been more popular in America than it is now.",1108512000,8,2378,4.745145631067961
