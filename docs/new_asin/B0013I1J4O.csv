8251039,5,B0013I1J4O,Good information on 52 blocks,1488412800,,29,5.0
8251040,5,B0013I1J4O,I loved this dvd.,1477958400,,17,3.5
8251041,5,B0013I1J4O,First of all I would like to say being a product of my environment I grew up around this style of fighting and to see this dvd It really gives you an insight on what the style is and where the style came from. If your looking to learn the style from this video than this product is not for you but if you want a down and dirty insight on the techniques and the skill its self please buy this DVD. Its a very strong depiction of the lost fighting style of the United States.,1453852800,,473,3.9375
8251042,3,B0013I1J4O,"Good and informative content on 52 blocks.
However, the video and editing were not professionally done.",1406764800,,103,5.5
8251043,1,B0013I1J4O,Another impostor jumping on the 52 Blocks band wagon. This is an instructional DVD but NOT of 52Blocks. Its a mix of Sanuces looking martial arts magic and I guess I can't blame him for wanting to make a buck but it pains me to see people putting the name 52 on anything just to sell some DVDs.,1371340800,3,294,4.086206896551724
8251044,5,B0013I1J4O,I have to say this was an intriguing and informative video. Well worth watching over and over to pull as much knowledge from these old school brawlers as possible.,1360800000,,163,4.655172413793103
8251045,5,B0013I1J4O,"Props to Sensei Mo for having the ability and taking the time to bring the street to the screen. He does this masterfully through his lens of an accomplished life long martial artist who still respects the streets he comes from. Sensei Mo gives credit to those that came up before him, learning how to protect themselves both in the street and in the prison system. He gives this credit in a very unique way, that doesn't glorify a criminal lifestyle, but instead points the watcher to values of honor, integrity, and courage that he instills in his martial arts students. We will be highlighting Sensei Mo's 52 Blocks at the MMA Fight Council web site during the month of February. Bottom line here, is that if you want to be better prepared to protect yourself and those that you love, in the streets, where there are no rules...watch 52 Blocks!",1359590400,2,847,4.6158940397351

8251047,3,B0013I1J4O,great video it really shows alot about the fighting system but it does not teach u how to fight it its more of a documentary of what 52 blocks is,1325030400,,145,3.8666666666666667
8251048,5,B0013I1J4O,I think that this DVD is a great sum up for what the Style is. I would Like to see more information on the subject but for what it cost It is definetly worth it!,1321142400,2,161,3.6285714285714286
