5449016,1,B00ALTQRRK,The discs skip and the sound cuts out in several spots. Even if you start over or video search FF or Backward it doesn't help or correct it...disappointing.,1386806400,,156,4.607142857142857

Then, we thought that we would try the second and were not disappointed.",1380844800,,157,3.9375

5449020,5,B00ALTQRRK,That is kind of how this movie rolls. Its very fun and super 90/80's. It's not a movie to be taken seriously at all.,1377475200,,116,3.875

5449046,5,B00ALTQRRK,"I've seen these movies in the past, but bought them here on Amazon so I can watch them with my daughter whose never seen them before. Funny how the 2nd time through a movie you see things differently. For instance it seems to me that Mick is sort of a con-man at first although he's a very likable kind of guy. He and his pal seem to want to put a fast one over. The original is divided up into two parts with the first half in Australia and the 2nd half in New York. The follow-up starts up in New York and then ends up back in Australia. It was a fun movie to see the 2nd time around for me and the first time for my daughter. Now we'll look forward to seeing the 3rd installment. This is a movie that the whole family can watch.",1524268800,,731,3.945945945945946

5449137,4,B00ALTQRRK,"The Blu-ray double feature value of these two comedies, though they certainly show their age, still allows us to take an adventure in the land down under.

Crocodile Dundee: Extremely dated as 1980s outro by todays standards this is still a fun throwback to the aforementioned 80s but more importantly it shares its warm humor and Aussie backwater personality; its good to see people not taking themselves too seriously and ol Mick (Michael Crocodile) Dundee stands front and center as the unflappable Australian white aboriginal animal whisperer, an amazing figure not just to sexpot journalist Sue Charlton (played by a vampy Linda Kozlowski) but to his fellow mates in the outback. Crocodile Dundee made a star out of Paul Hogan who helped to shape his character and the movie as he wrote it and helped adapt it for the screen. The story utilizes the fish out of water factor both with Sue who goes to Australia to track down and do a story on the enigmatic croc hunter and she is taught the ways of the wild western outback, but it also then flips the role as she talks Dundee to travel with her to her home in New York and he gets to experience those animal streets. The whole package is zithy and fun and even manages a little charm.

Crocodile Dundee II: Capitalizing on the success of the first hit film the sequel, while it still has its charms, lost some steam and didn't capture the magic of the Aussie dreamtime quite the same way that the first movie had done. Starring Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski again as Mick Crocodile Dundee and Sue Charlton (respectively), now a couple living in New York where Mick is still adjusting to the weirdness of the world that never sleeps, when Sue gets marked by some gangsters as someone who can turn evidence against them. In order to protect her Mick takes her back to his grounds in the Australian outback and when the gangsters with their guns follow they find themselves at the mercy of the man and the land that he knows like the back of his hand. Still following the fish out of water model that the first movie used the affable Mick is getting along alright in New York but he isn't comfortable there and is the proverbial fish. When he travels back to Australia he takes charge, without having to resort to firearms, and uses his cunning against the gangsters who are the proverbial fish in the Australian outback. The first movie is the superior film in almost every respect. Where Dundee II trumps the first one, if it does, is in the final act where we get to laugh and cheer on Dundee as he hands the bad guys their arses using his knowledge of his homelands terrain and animal peculiarities. Its worth a look but probably not without having seen the first one first.",1485734400,,2731,4.571428571428571

5449330,5,B00ALTQRRK,"It's not often that you get two great movies put together in one box but they definitely get the consumer appeal award with this one. Sometimes though, when there is a great movie put out on Blu-ray, and it has a sequel, they will only release the first film first, and hope to sell a few hundred thousand copies, but then they will release it as a double film release later to re-sell the first film again, concluding that you would have been double-dipped. They did that with ""Airplane"", then doubled it up with ""Airplane II: The Sequel"", and also with ""Every Which way But Loose"", and then later doubled up that one with ""Any Which Way You Can"" that was not released individually.  And, of course, there are more.

Anyway, I was worried that people would forget about the great ""Crocodile Dundee"" series because the first two films were fabulous. Who knows, they may release it as a triple pack with the much later released ""Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles"" but I don't think I'd bother to buy that one.

5449332,5,B00ALTQRRK,"The CROCODILE DUNDEE/CROCODILE DUNDEE II DOUBLE FEATURE is a double feature movie set that contains the first two Crocodile Dundee movies.

Although he was a fairly well known tv star in Australia, Paul Hogan was a virtual unknown in the United States. Then, in 1986, along came CROCODILE DUNDEE and Hogan became a huge international movie star who also helped make Australia a dream vacation destination for millions of Americans.

Hogan stars in the movie as Mick Dundee, a part Aborigine crocodile hunter who doesnt hunt for fun. Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) is a New York journalist on assignment in Australia. Before coming back home shes trying to track down a local man from the very small town of Walkabout Creek who supposedly had part of his leg bit off by a croc, but managed to survive and crawled out of the Outback several days later. She eventually meets the man who the story is about and he agrees to take her on a journey to retrace the steps of that episode. This leads to some hilarious moments in the Australian wild with Sue, but the story takes an even more interesting turn when Mick agrees to accompany Sue to New York City where he explores the urban jungle.

Hogan was not only the star of the movie, but he also created the story and co-wrote the screenplay. The chemistry between himself and Kozlowski is exceptional and it really came as no surprise that the two eventually ended up in a very long term real-life romance with each other.

CROCODILE DUNDEE was a major surprise hit when it first was released. Other than some 1980s fashions with Sue and the people in New York, the film remains fresh and vibrant a quarter of a century after it first came out. The movie has a great, well-written story with some very colorful characters and some good actors who have some amazing on-screen chemistry. There are some really funny lines that became catch phrases of the time (You call that a knife?), but there is also humor that works on several different levels from classic slapstick to wry and witty. Also, although there are a few adult references, CROCODILE DUNDEE is basically a family film. It was rated PG-13 in 1986, but is only a PG movie by todays standards.

Although the movie might not be a critical darling, CROCODILE DUNDEE was a huge popular success that remains fresh and relevant today and offers something for everyone in a family to enjoy.

It's rare that a sequel (not part of a planned series of films) lives up to the original film; sequels almost always aren't as good as the original films they follow. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is one of those few sequels that's just as good as the original and, in some ways, is an even better film. The movie begins in New York City. Although he has been in New York City for a while, Mic (Paul Hogan) is still ignorant of city life. Sue's (Linda Kozlowski) writing career is bigger than ever. One day Sue receives some photographs from her ex-husband Bob that depict the murder of a man at the hands of the lead of a Colombian drug cartel. Her life is in immediate danger and she ends up getting kidnapped. Mic rescues her, but knows the danger isn't over and that the criminals will not stop. So, Mic takes Sue with him back to Australia so he can protect her and fight off the drug lords on his own turf.

CROCODILE DUNDEE II has some humorous moments, but it's a more serious movie than the original. The audience actually gets to see some real character development with Mic and Sue. The first movie was more of a comedy with some romance thrown in; the romance actually wasn't the main focal point of the story. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is more of an action-adventure movie with a good dose of comedy that's actually tied together by a love story; the relationship between Mic and Sue is the catalyst for most of the plot. I actually enjoyed the more serious tone of the picture and found it gave it a bit of gravitas that the first movie never really had.

I first saw CROCODILE DUNDEE II in a movie theatre as a kid and I remember thinking even then how good of a sequel it was. I've seen both films several times since then and my impression of CROCODILE DUNDEE II has not changed: it's a great sequel to a classic 80s movie that remains as memorable now as it did when I first saw it.

CROCODILE DUNDEE II is a great sequel and follow-up film to CROCODILE DUNDEE. It's got a good plot and finds the right balance between comedy and action-adventure.

Its great to find a DVD that has both these movies together in one package.",1400025600,12,4519,4.520195838433293

5449334,4,B00ALTQRRK,"The '80s were all about fish-out-of-water films, and one of the most successful was ""Crocodile Dundee,"" an Australian comedy-adventure starring Paul Hogan. The first half is all about a ""Jane"" journalist roughing it in the outback to get a story on a Tarzan-like fellow who's a bit of a local legend, while the second (and more fun) half we see Dundee in New York City trying to survive in the urban wild . . . and make friends in the process. The sequel is more of a standard crime story about drug lords trying to recover incriminating evidence and Sue and Mick caught in their crosshairs, but even that one picks up in the second half when the bad guys are the fish out of water after following Sue and Mick to the outback. But when you have a double feature like this it's easy to think you're buying one good film (grade B) and getting a bonus film (C+) thrown in. Both films look terrific in HD, by the wayFamilyHomeTheater.com",1398988800,3,933,4.461988304093567

5449342,5,B00ALTQRRK,"This twin pack contains the first two (of three) Crocodile Dundee movies -- each on a separate disk. That is far, far, far (did I say far?) more preferable to the two-sided DVDs usually found in such ""twin packs.""  The latter are easier to scratch and I simply won't buy them. Only problem -- the manufacturer/studio doesn't tell the consumer if the contents are twin-sided or not. They should, in the interest of full disclosure print that on the case and in their advertising. That said, the viewer will thoroughly enjoy Paul Hogan's portrayal of Mick Dundee. The first movie is the best and sequel in a near runner up. The visas of Australia and the, to be commended, use of aborigine actors are icing on the cake. An enjoyable fun ride, mate!",1390694400,,746,4.609022556390977
