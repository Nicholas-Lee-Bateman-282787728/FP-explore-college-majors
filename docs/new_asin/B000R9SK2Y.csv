2863121,5,B000R9SK2Y,"John Schneider's best movie so far!

In this film he basically did everything himself.

He wrote, directed, financed, starred in...name it and he did it for this film!

This movie is about JR Collier, a racecar driver fresh off the circuit, who is in the business of selling cars.  How he does this is by racing other drivers for their cars, pink slip for pink slip.

On one such race for a Shelby, JR wins the car, but inside the car there is a package that belongs to one ""Mr. Fanning.""

And, throughout the entire movie ""Mr. Fanning"" tries desperatly to get the package back.

There are hilarious chases between JR and Tex and Shorty that have Dukes of Hazzard references that go really well with the film.

Now, the only bad thing was the special effects, but hey they are good concidering what John had to work with.

Everything in this movie is brilliant and wonderfully put together by John, and I look forword to Collier & Co II and you should too.

So, people go out and buy this movie.

No Dukes memorabilia collection would be complete without it!",1180915200,11,1058,4.486910994764398
2863122,2,B000R9SK2Y,"Sorry John, Love you, but this movie was pretty awful...",1485475200,,56,4.7
2863123,5,B000R9SK2Y,I love the movie. John and all the other actors were awesome. I do believe it's everything the dukes of hazzard movie could have been but wasn't. Sure it's has bad camera quality. But so what it's a great movie for the whole family to watch. I do recommend this movie 100%.,1483747200,,273,4.269230769230769
2863124,2,B000R9SK2Y,Purchased this based off of the reviews and there is NO WAY this movie is better than the Dukes of Hazard....I understand this was his wife and daughter but the acting was HORRIBLE and I guess I just expected it to be a lot better than what it was.  My husband is a huge Dukes fan and has all the seasons and the movies and this one was a disappointment.,1482796800,,354,4.057142857142857

2863126,5,B000R9SK2Y,I really liked the way this movie has all kinds of things commemorating the Dukes of Hazzard series and that it is what a new movie for the series should be.  There is all kinds of action and high speed chasing and getting out of trouble with the law.  Throughout the whole movie there are references to different parts of the series that show up.  This is a great movie to watch with the whole family,1479600000,,401,4.25
2863127,5,B000R9SK2Y,"another good movie by JS.  This one I understand he wrote, directed starred in and even funded himself.  Although I had to say it had
a flavor of Dukes of Hazard right down to the same color of car.  But still a good addition if your a JS fan and have other works of his
It was nice to see his family in it as well.",1479254400,,315,3.742424242424242

2863141,1,B000R9SK2Y,"I had high hopes for this movie, I really did. I grew up watching and loving The Dukes of Hazzard and to this day it remains my all time favorite TV series. I own the entire original series and both reunion movies on DVD plus a lot of other Dukes memorabilia that I've collected over the years. I have a large amount of respect for John both as an actor and off camera so it pains me to say this...but this movie was just plain bad. I realize it was filmed on a low budget but the acting, video, audio, and special effects were quite poor. Plus they tried way too hard to make this a Dukes movie. Orange '69 Charger, chase scenes, jumps...it was just painful to watch in comparison to the original Dukes series. I almost turned it off only 10 minutes in but I forced myself to sit through the entire thing. I'd return it if I could but for the cost of shipping and the 50% deduction for the opened package I might as well give it to someone else who might enjoy it.",1438992000,,965,4.138297872340425

This movie, as it notes, was written during that period when Bo, Luke & Daisy were running rampant. It has a lot of the same shenanigans. I personally enjoyed it, probably because it was new to me. But, it's not the Dukes of Hazzard(which it doesn't claim to be). All I can say is that if you were a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard, it's worth viewing. I'm glad that I have included in my collection!",1432339200,,555,4.196261682242991
2863148,2,B000R9SK2Y,"You may be disappointed in this movie.

As I watch this movie, I think, H. B. Halicki. It felt like a low budget, semi professional film. The longer I watch, I start to think that H.B. Halicki's movies (Gone in 60 Seconds, Junkman, Deadline Auto..) look more like a big Hollywood production than this movie does. (And I love Halicki's movies).

Not to put down Bo Duke (my brother and I would race to the TV to watch the Dukes of Hazard every week.... not so fast during the season with Coy and Vance Duke) but the acting was low quality and there really was not enough action. This was more like a home movie, and that is including the CGI pyrotechnics. There was more action in 40 minutes of the Dukes than in this whole movie.

But there was some comedy. No, it did not have Rosco and Enos chasing Bo, But Bo was being pursued by another couple of knuckleheads.

In the start of this disc, you see John talking to the camera and mentioning a Collier and Company 2. If you watch this movie, you will see why there was no sequel.",1430352000,,1030,4.266666666666667

2863183,1,B000R9SK2Y,"As a long time Dukes Of Hazzard fan I was looking forward to this movie.
While the movie itself was good, I am writing about the shoddy depiction of the product. I bought the ""Limited Edition"" of this movie since it was cheaper. I watched it and the quality of film was rubbish. But the movie was good so I decided, based on John Schneider's opening statements to get the ""regular"" dvd. Which he says has all these special features on it. Well I received the movie and the back cover says it is a 2 disc set with loads of special features. But upon opening it I was stunned to find it was actually the same copy as the one I purchased before, with the same lousy picture quality. Now I've wasted money on two copies of this disc. Neither price was that expensive so I'm not complaining about that. I'm upset that the description of the product is not at all what it claims to be. Two different covers with the same low quality movie in it. Even long time fans of his-such as I am would agree this is cheap way to con fans out of extra money. I would give it zero or half a star if that was an option.",1331856000,,1100,4.120930232558139

The whole family watches hours of Dukes of Hazard DVDs and this fits right in to the 'do the right thing"" theme. The movie budget was less than movies that you see in the theater. Yes, you can tell the difference, do not let that stop you from buying this movie. Plot was very good with lots of neat cars in the movie.",1326326400,,406,4.0875
2863185,4,B000R9SK2Y,"I got the movie I ordered yesterday in the mail. ""Hot Pursuit"" staring John Schneider. I sat down to watch it last night. (10/19/2011) My son was at the computer at the time. Let's just say he actually gravitated from the computer to the couch to watch the movie with me. He has never done that before. I asked my son what he thought when it was over. He said, ""It's entertaining."" He's not the kind of person to sit down with me and watch a movie with me. I did have to explain the difference between the name of the car in ""Hot Pursuit"" and the one in ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" but that's okay. His Asperger's Syndrome was working over time on him.

Now for my review. It was good. Only 1 swear word in it. There was some questionable behavior in it. Such as backing over what were to be motorcycles in a handicap parking stall. Something that only a hothead would think of doing. Hm... It was a likable movie I would say. Of course I am a Dukes of Hazzard fan and this movie (Hot Pursuit) had some of that in it. I don't want to give too much away. It was a nice movie and I'll pop it in the DVD machine and watch it again and my son will to.

2863187,3,B000R9SK2Y,"I like this movie. It's so different from the CG-loaded sci-fi I usually get. It's obviously meant to follow up or pay homage to Dukes of Hazzard (a show I enjoy!).

This DVD has an unusual beginning: John Schneider will thank you for purchasing the DVD, talk about how you can buy it in bulk to resell, and explain that he put the whole thing together as a labor of love, involving his family and friends. It's a fairly good story that opens with John (playing JR Collier) about to hustle someone (would Bo Duke have done that?) and continues with  decent lines, decent funny moments throughout (almost Hazzard style), a little bit of scariness, and some fancy driving on dirt roads. JR drives a Dodge Charger he named Traveler. The sidekick is a version of Cooter put into a big fancy garage. The bad guys are threatening but won't really scare anyone (one good ol' boy wears a Roscoe-esque hat). The special effects are just enough to make a point. Throughout the movie is a family struggle that honestly tugged at my heart. John's acting is great, his wife is charming, their daughter is like the tomboy next door. I think the two cute towheads in the restaurant scene are Schneiders and credit is given to a son working behind the scenes. As other reviewers mentioned, the sound is nothing to brag about. Also the movie is presented in full format rather than widescreen. All-in-all, it gave me the feeling that some cousins whose company I enjoy, but don't get to see very often, have put together this film to entertain anyone who loves the core features of The Dukes of Hazzard.

Note: You won't get extras on this DVD, as there is supposedly another out there released several months after this one, but there is a short bloopers track after the movie that features a very funny nod to his role on the TV show Smallville.

In case you didn't know, here is a little trivia that will make watching this movie more interesting: Bo Duke was supposedly patterned after Jerry Rushing who ran moonshine in a car he named Traveler before going into stock car racing, and The Dukes of Hazzard was compiled in part by stories Jerry (JR?) told Gy Waldron.",1297036800,,2153,4.584415584415584

If you've seen all the Dukes of Hazard series and are looking for something more, I would encourage you to check out ""Moonrunners"".

John Schnieder did so many things behind the scenes raising the money, directing etc he reminds me of the late  H.B ""Toby"" Halicki who was well noted for financing and acting in several car films most notably the original ""gone in 60 seconds"" from the 70's. All in all I advise anyone who likes fun car chase movies that the whole family  can watch to pick this one up. Also there is a sequel in production.",1216166400,3,589,4.345454545454546
2863195,4,B000R9SK2Y,"This is a silly but enjoyable effort done by John Schneider with his family and friends.  The acting is a bit off but there are some good laughs and best of all... it's a clean movie.  If you like the old Dukes of Hazzard show, you'll like this too.",1216166400,,249,4.061224489795919
2863196,5,B000R9SK2Y,"It would be difficult not to give this film five stars simply because it has such good intentions.  There is a lot to admire in this film.  Schneider proves that he knows how to direct a scene and he gets the most from his amateur cast (Schneider's family and friends fill many of the rolls).  At times the film feels like a very elaborate home movie.  There are a couple of truly humorous scenes and Schneider's mother steels the show in her cameo role.  There are also a lot of technical flaws that take the viewer out of the action. Let's hope that such a lazy approach is not taken in the next film.  Still, this is a lot of fun and I enjoyed it very much.",1208908800,,660,4.15748031496063

2863198,5,B000R9SK2Y,"""Collier & Co. - Hot Pursuit"" is a home movie which John Schneider made for his fans.  It is a comedy suitable for all ages to watch.  There is something for everyone.  Comedy, action, stunt driving, and more abound.  Do you like the TV series The Dukes of Hazzard?  If so, then you will love this movie.  You know the ingredients...wonderful good guys, not so bad bad guys, and even that 1969 Dodge Charger...orange of course...named Traveler after the legendary horse of the even more legendary General Lee.  This movie stars John Schneider, his wife Elly, his daughters Karis and Leah, his son Chasen, and his mother Shirley.  This is actually a two-disc set consisting of the movie and many special features.  The special features include a director's commentary and a cast commentary on the movie.  They also include a music video ""Traveler"" written and performed by Las Vegas two-time entertainer of the year Paul Casey.  This movie has something for everyone.  I recommend it highly!",1190678400,2,990,4.897590361445783
2863199,5,B000R9SK2Y,"What a fantastic family movie.  It has everything for all ages.  My whole family loved this film.  My Kids and their Great Grandfather found something to laugh with while watching this film.  Congratulations on making a movie from the heart.  There is a plot and it captures your attention from beginning to end.  Finally a movie that is not all about the special effects, and how far the envelope of decency can be pushed.  This movie should be in everyone's library.

Home Run!  Thanks for a great picture, can't wait for the sound track, and for Collier & Co. II.  I have only had my copy of the DVD for a couple of days, and I have seen it three times already.",1190505600,10,664,4.368852459016393
2863200,5,B000R9SK2Y,"I always loved the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" but unfortunately I never found a movie that has all what made that TV-show so special:clean humour,great car scenes,family values,friendship,romance and much more. With ""Collier & Co -Hot Pursuit"" John Schneider made such a movie. He and his family put so much love and all their hearts into this movie and that's exactly what you see when you watch it. It's entertainment for the whole family at its best. You simply forget your everyday troubles for a while and do nothing but laughing,enjoying and feeling great. We need and want much more like that, so,John: PLEASE,make a second part!!!!!!",1190332800,20,633,4.981132075471698
