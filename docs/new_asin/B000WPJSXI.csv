8224944,4,B000WPJSXI,"The biggest negative to William Weyler's documentary is the short running time of 40+ minutes. Considering how many hours he spent inside B-17's (not just the Memphis Belle) risking his life to film hours of combat footage, it is surprising so little of it was released.  With that being said, the film is a must and not to be missed if B-17's and the air war in Europe are your specialty.  I might add that the U.S. government pulled a fast one on the unsuspecting American public.  The Hell's Angels of the 303rd bomb group, not the Memphis Belle of the 91st bomb group, became the first 8th Air Force B-17 to complete 25 combat missions.  The crew that accompanied the Memphis Belle was a makeup crew of men who had completed 25 missions. It was not the original Memphis Belle, Captain Morgan crew.  Wyler noted in subsequent interviews that he had plenty of footage inside the Hell's Angels B-17 if the Memphis Belle was shot down.  It would be nice to see the hours of Weyler's raw footage, if if exists, but probably not after 73 years.  The P-47 Thunderbolt film is uninspired, boring, and not reflective of what a great fighter this ""little friend"" was to the ""heavy"" friends in the ETO.",1472947200,,1195,4.55607476635514
8224945,5,B000WPJSXI,"This was an exciting movie especially since I suspect it was filmed from the bellies of B17's by director William Wyler and his photography crew.  I suggest viewers of this movie read the book ""Five Who Came Back"" which is about 5 movie directors who were asked by the army to direct short documentries for  showing in movie theaters during WW2.  One of  Wyler's photographers went down with a B17 on its 25th mission.  Meanwhile the Memphis Belle completed its 25th mission with Wyler aboard.  The  directors in the book are William Wyler, John Ford (Midway), John Huston (North Africa & Italy), George Stevens (With Eisenhower in Germany & the concentration camps) and Frank Capra who stayed in Washington DC dealing with all the red tape and censorship from the War Department of the other four.  He also did a series called ""Why We Fight"".  I have watched the first two documentaries of that and it is excellent.  I learned a lot that was not information given out at that time.  I plan to watch all 8 episodes.",1427846400,4,1015,4.646067415730337
