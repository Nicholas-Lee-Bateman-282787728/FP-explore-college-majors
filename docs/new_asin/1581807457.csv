7799355,5,1581807457,"It is remarkable what Chinese watercolor artist Lian Quan Zhen can do with a minimal set of colors, a few brush strokes, and a piece of rice paper.  I was first introduced to this DVD in water color class (my teacher had taken one of his workshops), and had to purchase it in order to emulate his brush stroke technique, and the way he poured washes onto his paper (in the most elaborate composition on this DVD:  a rooster, hen and chicks).  I am still impressed by the way he was able to paint a fence with just a few brush strokes and colors.

On this DVD, the artist paints a fish, chick, rooster, cat, dog, tiger, monkey, and the above composition.  The spontaneity of his technique is belied by his years of experience in painting and teaching.  His art teaching credentials include eight years at the University of California at Berkeley where he taught watercolor outdoor sketching, and he has taught many watercolor and Chinese painting workshops nationwide in US, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Bahamas, China, South Africa and Australia.

It is magical to watch a cat appear on the rice paper after just a few passes of this artist's brush.  This DVD is a great place to start your journey with Chinese watercolor painting.",1304812800,14,1227,4.674418604651163
