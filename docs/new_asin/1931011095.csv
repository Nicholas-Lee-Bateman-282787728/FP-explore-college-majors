7801451,3,1931011095,"I've known about TKM for years and used a couple of techniques.  So I don't need convincing.
This DVD is 39 minutes long, and the first 20 are a few annoying dramatizations, some introductory talk, and testimonials.
The last 10 minutes demonstrate several useful techniques.  When we played the disc in the DVD player for the TV we could only play it completely from beginning to end, no other controls work. On the computer we had controls and could watch techniques again to learn.
This disc has the stop bleeding hold, but not the one with the hands reversed to remove toxins.",1467590400,,579,4.666666666666667
