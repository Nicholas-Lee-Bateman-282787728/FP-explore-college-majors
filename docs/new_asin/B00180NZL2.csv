I love this Pokemon Diamond & Pearl DVD. I still have it in my Region 2 DVD collection. Well it only has 2 episodes in the form of a two part story called ""Pokemon Ranger! The Dashing Riolu"" straight outta the 11th season of the Pokemon TV Anime series. It can be watched in full length or marathon story mode in all of its Japanese uncut glory. That's cool. Even so Pokemon DVDs in Japan, especially the previous releases from past generations are considered collector's items now. Enjoyable but memorable as well.",1451692800,,749,4.674242424242424
