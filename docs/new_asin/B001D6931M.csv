8291940,5,B001D6931M,"The official review is inaccurate and should be ignored.  The civil defense information in these films remains completely valid and could save your homes and lives.  If you happen to be outside the blast area of an attack, which most people would be, all information given in these well made government films is completely valid.  It is also good information for other disasters like housefires.  your local fire department will tell you the same things.  The threat of attack has not ended and all citizens should take these steps to protect themselves.
