8444451,5,B004W5ALOY,"Fantastic sweet storylines appeals to the younger crowd and teaches Spanish/English .. The friendship bwn Cat and Dog is charming, and love how they change roles: if cat asks in English, El Perro answers In Spanish  -- and vice versa.  Simple enough story with enough adventure that reinforce vocabulary. -- all good.

8444453,4,B004W5ALOY,These videos are great for helping kids learn and understand Spanish words. One character says it in Spanish and the other repeats in English. They do not really grab my 11 month old's attention though. I think when she's older she'll get into them.,1374883200,,249,4.681818181818182
