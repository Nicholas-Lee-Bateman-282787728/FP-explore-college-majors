4558714,3,B0054509GQ,so i did go ahead and order the nightmare on elm street 2 AND 3 on blu ray together i think it is unfair for these movies to be released together.  i remember the first time i saw the first 4 movies on one dvd disc and the rest on another...i was pissed.  back in 99 when the box set came out we paid loads of money to have all the movies then they sell them for 10 bucks for the first 4 movies...total cheap shot.  i feel this release of 2 and 3 and total cheap shot as well.  I wanted a Freddy's revenge with deleted scenes and other unreleased material for blu ray...same for dream warriors...but it seems they are going the cheap route by releasing them together.  whatever at least we are getting them on blu ray.  its taken them long enough.  so many other horror films have been put on blu ray and it has taken them this long to release the rest of the elm street series.  I know there isn't hope for Freddy's nightmares to be released...gotta find those on ebay.  but yeah its a bunch of crap in my opinion.  i would like all movies seperate...with their own art..and everything that the movie deserves.  maybe things will change between now and the end of September..wtf...end of sept.  how bout a quicker release date. oh well.  we will see what happens.,1307577600,4,1264,4.282700421940929
4558725,5,B0054509GQ,"These are two of my favorite Freddy films. They are scary and very entertaining. Robert Englund's iconic portrayal will go down as one of horrors best villians. If you haven't seen these films ,I suggest getting them , they won't disappoint.",1358985600,,241,4.902439024390244
4558726,4,B0054509GQ,After watching this disc now i know why this movie is one of the best rated scary movie series from the 80's. The video quality was a little off compared to other bluray's on the market but considering these movies are almost 30 years old there's not much you can do about actually making it look any better. The sound as well was not real spectacular. Overall this movie collection in my rating is a 4 star rating!,1339718400,2,415,4.333333333333333
4558727,5,B0054509GQ,This has always been one of my favorite horror movie series. The job done remastering this movie in Blu Ray is EXCELLENT. When you look at it it's like it just came out in theaters in 2011 and on Blu Ray in 2012! It definitely doesn't look like a movie from the 1980's. Amazon's FREE Super Saver Shipping is unbelievable!!! Everytime I've ordered something and chose FREE Super Saver Shipping it always comes 2 or 3 days earlier than the estimated delivery date! The last 2 times I've ordered items and chose FREE Super Saver Shipping they were here 2 days later!! Amazon is the BEST and so is this Blu Ray! If you love Freddy Kruger you'll definitely love watching him in FULL HD on Blu Ray!! I'm very satisfied with this purchase!!,1330214400,2,733,4.477611940298507
4558728,5,B0054509GQ,"you get 2 movies for the price of one, Great transfers, the movies look like they just came out of the movie theater.  Grab this one its definitely worth it.",1325548800,3,157,4.233333333333333
4558729,4,B0054509GQ,"After getting over the initial surprise that these two films are on one disc it is time to look at the product for what it is.  To have these films on blu ray is an amazing treat and being on one disc in itself in no way hinders the quality.  We still get a bunch of extras.  They are extras we have seen before but at least they are there.  What does play the biggest factor in each of these movies is in fact the original source used to make the transfer and how good its quality was.  Both films are presented in 1080p and DTS HD Master audio 5.1.  Now, how are the results.

Blu ray when done well can really do amazing things to a film and surprisingly 2 - FREDDY'S REVENGE which is indeed the more inferior of the films presents itself brilliantly on blu ray.  The opening sequence with the school bus is of very poor quality but the very next scene the film bursts into glorious vivid colors, superb clarity with excellent black/white ratios.  For the entire remainder of the film the video is superb and rivals that of the original on blu ray.  And the audio is just as good.  Dialogue is strong and present, surround sound is utilized superbly and the atmosphere never falters.  Blu ray makes this film much better than it actually is.  It is a joy to watch.

Sadly DREAM WARRIORS which is most fans favorite after the original is all over the place.  The video will have little snippets of clarity but is mostly very grainy and overall appears here only slightly better than the dvd.  The video quality just goes in and out.  This would be passably acceptable if the audio was supreme as in FREDDY'S REVENGE but sadly it is very lacking.  Dialogue goes in and out as well.  The audio gets louder during the action sequences and it is very difficult to set your volume at a level where dialogue and surround mix for a frightening and Freddy filled experience.  This is the first film where Freddy started his sarcastic comments and due to the bad audio they all go under the radar.  What a waste. The whole wit and suspense of the film gets lost.

So FREDDY'S REVENGE is a revelation and DREAM WARRIORS is a huge disappointment.  I still give it 4 stars for I love having both films on blu ray, even if I choose to watch DREAM WARRIORS  in stereo to get a more steady audio experience.  I hope they can redo this film again to better quality.  I will double dip.  But for the price I still highly recommend this blu ray for FREDDY'S REVENGE takes on new life and at least DREAM WARRIORS is better than the dvd, if only slightly.",1319846400,7,2537,4.3312101910828025
4558730,4,B0054509GQ,"The movies look good and the special features are nice.  I'm a big Freddy fan and I hadn't seen most of the special features before.  The only thing I would have liked is a new commentary track for each movies duration.  But the one big flaw that I notice right away is on the first menu screen when you choose if you want to watch part 2 or part 3.  The half of the screen for part 3 has two pictures.  One is the standard picture that I have seen before of 3 headshots.  Heather Langenkamp on the left, Patricia Arquette in the middle, and Laurence Fishburn on the right.  Then, for some reason, there is a picture of Freddy taken from a scene in Freddy vs Jason.  WHY IS THAT THERE???  There are plenty of great pics of Freddy from part 3.  Why not use one of those?  It's not really that big of a deal, but it bothers me because I HATED Freddy vs Jason and I think it's the worst entry in both series.",1319155200,,905,4.056497175141243
4558731,5,B0054509GQ,"i am pleased with these transfers, they look great, more color more detail and i noticed where they touched some spots up like in nightmare 2 the bus scene at the beginning looks blu-ish on dvd but on blu ray it looks red and hot.
not the best transfers out there but very close.",1318982400,,279,4.185185185185185
4558732,5,B0054509GQ,"So for some reason there seems to be a lot of crying about this release. No tears over here, I paid 10 bucks for the two movies... And they look pretty awesome. I was actually more impressed with the way part 2 looks than I was with part 3, but I may have to go back through them. I definitely like 3 more....

When part 2 starts on the bus it doesn't look anything special, but just wait until that scene ends and you end up in Jesse's house on Elm Street. It looks awesome, and the rest of the film looks good too.

Yes the artwork on the box is off, yes it's not the greatest set ever made, but 10 bucks for 2 Nightmare movies on Blu Ray? Can't beat it. This is the best these two movies have ever looked. Anyone is says the DVDs look the same is wrong by a long shot, this is coming from someone who has owned all the NOES dvds.",1318377600,2,832,3.9171597633136095
4558733,1,B0054509GQ,"If You compare to the dvd version , you can see how bad this is. The picture is green and dark and poor colors!!!they even deleted original opening logo,and put a new one.... shame!!!",1318291200,,183,4.411764705882353
4558734,4,B0054509GQ,"So much for the idiots who write a review before the product is released! The movies are of Blu-Ray quality, with a better transfer than even the special edition DVD (which I owned). The colors are deeper the picture is pristine (sometimes gritty in the darker parts of the movie) and the sound quality is heads and shoulders above some of my other 80's Blu-Rays. Loved IT!!! DO NOT TRUST ANY REVIEW BEFORE 9-27-11 (the release date). I guess people are feeling they get screwed if there is more than one movie on a disc, but the truth of the matter is that you could put 3 or 4 1080p movies on a single disc. The special features are a little lacking. Although adequate, they could have included extensive material that was seen in the documentary ""A Nightmare in Red White & Blue"" But if you are worried because they put 2 movies on a single disc, HAVE NO FEAR!!! They did this one right. Personally I hope more studios start doing this. THE ONLY THING TO LOSE, IS MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET!!!",1317686400,10,994,4.407608695652174
4558755,4,B0054509GQ,"I actually watched both films Today. The blu-Ray quality is very, very good. For fans of extra content, there is plenty.
No question that 2+3 being packaged together is inferior to a blu Ray set of all the original nightmare series. But that's a dumb reason to keep yourself from watching Dream Warriors in all it's blu Ray-big screen-glory.
Yes, freddys revenge is your typical not that good seqeul. Although Freddy is always awesome and the quality isn't bad but why they would omit any of the original music is more baffling than why we have to see this guy in his underwear so many, many times.
It gets 4 stars for Dream Warriors alone. It is one of the best in the storied history of the franchise, it's the best it's ever looked and sounded, and it's less than 15 bucks. I'd pay that for 3 all by itself.

4558756,5,B0054509GQ,"So i read reviews about this and was planning not to get it, though very excited they even put the sequels out on blu ray. It is kinda lame they don't get there own box but when they have their own menus and stuff it doesnt really matter if they were released on a double feature. Also people on hear didn't really review the transfer so hears my review: The films may not look as good as some blu rays but its deff a good transfer. Picture quality and sound quality are very good, its a huge upgrade from the dvd version so im happy. Plus there are special features and for 2 movies in 1 for a low price of $13.99 is a steal :)now i just hope they release 4&5 and 6&7 cuz really im impressed. Fer sure i'm going to watch them again on halloween :) I'll be waiting for halloween 3 season of the witch on blu ray and friday the 13th part 4 on blu ray :) so enjoy the hi def of this double feature because it really cant get any better than this.",1317340800,3,944,3.973684210526316
4558757,5,B0054509GQ,"I love the films.  The only thing I'd rather have instead is if they just go ahead and put all nine in a Blu Ray Box Set for us.

I don't understand why some fans get so freaked out over these films not having their own box.  This was clearly done because Blu Rays are still expensive to make and Part 2 will have little hope of doing well on its own.  The price is great, it's almost like getting two for the price of one.  So, if you're not a fan of Freddy's Revenge, think of it as a free gift.

I actually hope they keep releasing these this way.  Four is seen as stronger than five and seven stronger than six.  This way they pair up and all get out on Blu Ray.

That's the real point here people.  That the movies we love get a high definition transfer done up right and put out on Blu Ray.  To me, it doesn't matter if they films land in one box or two.

As for the films themselves, I love them both.

Freddy's Revenge:
To me, the homo-erotic psycho-sexual nature of this film was a huge plus.  I think I heard Robert say once that this film did a lot better in Europe than in America.  Not bashing America, I think he was just pointing out that the Europeans had an appreciation for that type of film that most Americans really didn't at that time.  Also, homosexuality itself was a topic not really well welcomed or well known in the days this film came out.  As a young kid, 23 now, I grew up with this film from the DVD Box Set.  It was very personal for me.  And, as Never Sleep Again points out, it was clearly personal for the actor too.  The film shows an inner conflict in its subtext.  Sometimes it boils to the surface.  Newline and Bob Shaye were very brave for going out on a limb and making this type of a film when they did.  It was an artist and gutsy move, especially considering its only the second film in the franchise.  The first film was the only other one to compare it with; and its very different from the first film.  It's so easy for people now to brush it off as the 'odd duck' because it doesn't fallow all the 'rules' the franchise later grew to have.  I hope people will give it a chance again, this time around, and try to see the deeper side of this film that has made a niche for itself in the homosexual horror community.

Dream Warrior's
In many ways, this was the direct sequel to the original.  Nancy coming back is a definite plus.  The film adds a darker, religious nature to Krueger.  It is here that Freddy is painted as an inverted Christ character; paralleled with the Anti-Christ. Both Freddy and Jesus are born of 'Mother Marry.' Freddy was conceived over Christmas Break whilst Jesus was 'born on' Christmas. Freddy's blood (genetics of his Father being one of a hundred maniacs) was given as the cause for his damnation while the blood of Jesus is used to redeem people. Freddy destroys innocence while Jesus saves the innocent. This extra dimension expanded the mythology of Freddy and allowed for the character to act as Christian commentary as an added dimension to Freddy already acting as commentary on suburbia.  Also, the idea of fallowing suicidal teenagers facing a spiritual evil that divides the views of the doctors was a daring view that few are brave enough to take today.  There is clear tension between the mainstream doctor and the one that is willing to have an open mind to the spiritual.  Nancy's blending of modern science and a spiritual level is what I hope medicine will someday be in the future when enough people like her character with deep character get into those positions of society.  Perhaps that's why (not kidding) I almost always cry when she dies at the end.  While it is true that this is the film that sets the Freddy Formula in motion; that we will see again in almost every film, it does so with a deepness that the fallowing films sometimes lack.  Not bashing the other films.  I love them all.  But this film has a perspective that clearly question why spirituality and science are being kept separate instead of being melded together to help the youth of our generations.",1315785600,14,4102,4.395750332005312

I never thought I would get the third one (one of the best, in my opinion) in HD. Hopefully they are done properly, even if they didn't have any extras, I'd just want both movies to look great.

4558760,5,B0054509GQ,"First off, let me just say that the nightmare franchise is quite possibly my favorate horror series of all time. I'm dying for Freddy to come to Mortal Kombat (August 9th). That being said, I don't see why they have to degrade the series to offering two for one. I love the thought of getting twor movies (especially blu ray) for the price (or less) of one. while this isn't less, it's still awesome to get more for less. while this is slightly more (I believe that the first one was released at 12.99), it still seems like a fairly good deal in my opinion. I mean, two movies for one low price, one of them being absolutely incredible, kind of making up for the wait for this (the first one was released over a year ago, I believe on April 15th), or limiting the wait for the next one (in a way, you know, being able to focus on 4th as opposed to 3rd). However, because they'll be two, that could lead to some problems that could lead to it being undesirable. first off, the box art. while I'm less fickle about these things, their are people who want a full box of 2 and a full box of 3 (art wise, two cases), and because the box contains a combination of 2 and 3, that may anger some people. and my one other complaint is no longer valid, for there are 2 disks, so yeah... pretty stoked, hope their are plenty of new scenes, alt scenes, documentries, interviews, the works.",1311638400,,1376,4.255725190839694
4558761,1,B0054509GQ,"Do not get me wrong I am happy to get blu ray version's regardless. And that is because there were talks of not bringing the series to blu ray. But I do agree how insulting Nightmare on elm street being treated like crap. If saw and scream as well as other series can get their own case/disk treatment for each movie, then why is nightmare on elm street getting treated awful buy value water downed version. This is not the full or intended version of the movies. I bought the first movie and the remake (even so i dislike the remake) which i almost bought the Canadian version of the first movie which was super over priced and limited. There was no plan of putting the first movie on blu ray but at least the did the movie justice with it own box and treatment. I heard pt. 4 when sent over from studio to studio that alot of its extra's and intended version was in awful shape, which i wonder if that is the reason why they are cheating us out. Not every friday the 13th movie is on blu ray but they claim it soon will, But at least it will be on separate disks with great treatment. So what is the issue here? In my case if they do release the blu ray like this then this October they should release the Collectors Box set of all freddy related movies, series and related cameo's on blu ray or take the time for this Christmas.

8456244,4,B0054509GQ,"This is the best film out of all the NOES- ""Freddy"" franchise series. I first saw this film in the movies when I was 9 or 10, and still have a high opinion of the movie regardless if their special effects today are pretty cheesy.

Why do I believe this is best of the Freddy genre? I enjoyed this film the most simply because the heroes could fight back, and fight back hard as equals to Freddy and his magical all encompasing power over his victims inside the dream world. Freddy clearly from a military perspective, controls his own battle space forcing his opponent- victims to go on the defensive channeling where he wants them and placing them at a huge disadvantaged position.

In this film unlike the others the young people TARGETED by Freddy have found the ability to control the realm of the dream world, which acts as another dimension in sci fi terms outside of this universe. These young people with the aid of a powerful drug learn to become their own superheroes inside this dream world, providing them with certain ""X-Men"" like powers against Freddy to the point where they are now equal combatants in this area of horror which did NOT happen in any of the other Nightmare on Elm street films before.

I felt as if there is a very ""X-Men"" like theme to this Freddy movie, to where they have adult educated leadership to guide them in their quest to deploy in ""Dreamworld"" combat against Freddy. I also felt this film reminded me of the other 80's classic Sci Fi Horror Adventure, ""Dreamscape"".

Plot: Surviving teenagers of Elm Street are all in a mental institution believed by their parents and the doctors that they are all mentally ill. Freddy is believed to have been dead but the town keeps Freddy and his fate a big ugly secret. The former Sheriff is now a SECURITY guard after being fired for becoming a drunk after his mental state goes insane becoming a drunk due to his first battle with Freddy. He does not get along with his daughter the one he helped save from Freddy before.

The only girl that knows the truth is now a grown up mental specialist who not only seeks out the teens to help them, she tries to convince a nice young Doctor of what is really happening and how to really help these kids. She was a victim of Freddy in episode one and lived to survive to tell the tale. She knows what Freddy's powers are and also knows of a method to destroy him, preventing him from killing all of the Elm Street teens.

We learn some origins of Freddy in this movie, where his mother is revealed to be an innocent victim spirit inside the mental institution where she was sexually assaulted by 100 loose psychopaths in the ward years previously. Her ghost is on a Holy Jesus mission to help stop Freddy and his ""Devil"" inspired powers.

Despite all of these people teaming up in this film to fight Freddy, he remains an all powerful mix of a serial killer slash genie, slash wizard inside the dark realm of the dreamworld.

This is one of the premier movies of the 80's I can clearly recall, and is the absolute best among other films which really are exploitive horror garbage and could have been a lot better. Even this new ""Freddy"" movie of Y2K-2010's honestly is really bad film making. So if you want actor Robert Englund's ""Freddy"" this is the premier movie of the series.",1422576000,,3305,4.496666666666667
