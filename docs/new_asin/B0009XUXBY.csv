8069949,3,B0009XUXBY,"This video was created in the 80s and feels like a step back in time.  The skiers' clothes and hair styles remind me of my high school days.  But I knew the video was archaic when I bought this VHS tape so all that doesn't bother me.  What does kinda get on the nerves after awhile is the music, which is designed to help you set your pace.  I just turn the volume down, enjoy the scenery, and use the routines to help me time my workouts.  This video has two 15-minute, and one 20-minute routine to use and combine as desired.  If you're still using a VCR and want to start a NordicTrak workout, you might consider popping this video in for distraction and a laugh or two.",1327968000,,673,4.178294573643411
