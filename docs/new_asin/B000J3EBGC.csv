8148885,5,B000J3EBGC,"""Escuela de Vagabundos""

 This film is hilarious, with the kind of sharp, clever wit that is a thing of the past, joyous slapstick, sweet romance, and gorgeous music. It takes a lot to make me laugh out loud, and this film will make you laugh until it hurts, guaranteed. When we first meet Jose Alberto Medina, his car has gone up in smoke and down a ravine, and his bucket has a hole in it; he wanders to the nearest residence, a mansion where the seora of the house, Emilia, gushes over him, thinking he is the latest in her ""vagabundos."" It seems that Emilia feels so blessed to have all she has, that she takes in wandering hobos, to feed them and educate them, and though Medina just wants to use the telephone, he gets embroiled in this wonderful but crazy family, and ends up being their ""chauffeur,"" and so much more.

Pedro Infante is superb as Medina. His songs are a marvel, and include ""Nana Pancha,"" where he dances around in an undershirt looking incredibly buff, the super romantic ""Grito Prisionero,"" ""Quien Sera,"" which has a melody you hum for days after hearing it (many will remember Dean Martin and Bobby Rydell having hits with this song as ""Sway""), and a glorious ""Cucurrucucu Paloma,"" with the Mariachi Vargas. The rest of the large cast is also marvelous, and includes Miroslava Stern as Susana, Blanca de Castejon as her daffy but adorable mother Emilia, Oscar Pulido as gruff father Miguel, and Eduardo Alcaraz, the origin of much of the humor as Audifas the butler. Directed by Rogelio Gonzalez with lovely cinematography by Rosalio Solano, this is romantic comedy at its brightest and best, and possibly one of the funniest films ever made. Not to be missed by Infante fans.

""Ahi Viene Martin Corona,"" 1952.

Martin (Pedro Infante) is ""humilde, valiente y sincero"" and helps those in need, along with his wise teacher and friend Piporro (Lalo Gonzalez), and then Rosario (Sara Montiel) arrives on the scene. She has come with her father (Florencio Castello) from Spain because she has inherited a ranch. To escape some bad guys, she disguises herself as Carmen, ""La Bellisima Cancionera Andaluza,"" and her stubborn and petulant temper get in the way of her love for Martin. The plot may be thin and convoluted, but the songs are fantastic:
1: ""Copa tras copa"" (Infante)
2: ""Cartas a Eufemia"" (Infante) A marvel of a song as Martin writes a letter for a friend (played by Infante's brother Angel) to the friend's girlfriend Eufemia.
3: ""Paloma querida,"" (Infante, Jose Alfredo Jimenez and Antonio Bribieska on guitar) Fabulous! And with Infante's horse trying to steal the spotlight!
4: ""Amorcito de mi vida"" (Infante) Exquisite!
5: ""Cuando el destino"" (Infante)
6: ""Del mero norte"" (Jose Alfredo Jimenez) This song is sung in the early part of the film as a background for some great cinematography, and again later with Jimenez as part of a scene.
7: ""Para el carro"" (Montiel)
8: ""Copla en la noche"" (Montiel)
9: ""Cancion del ole"" (Montiel)

""El Enamorado,"" AKA ""Vuelve Martin Corona,"" 1952.

This sequel has the same cast, and time has gone by, with Martin and Rosario now married. Her jealousy and temper have curtailed Martin's activities and people have started to say he is no longer the man he used to be. The film becomes very dramatic towards the end, with some ""edge of your seat"" moments. Both films share the same director, Miguel Zacarias, and the same masterful cinematographer, the great Gabriel Figueroa, whose use of light and shade, and the sheer beauty of his work is especially noticeable in the last part of the film. Song selection:
1: ""Del mero norte"" (Jose Alfredo Jimenez)
2: ""Viejos amigos"" (Infante)
3: ""Siempre, siempre"" (Infante)
4: ""Un dia nublado"" (Infante)
5: ""Ahi vienen los mariachis"" (Infante). I love this number!
6: ""La buenaventurera"" (Montiel)

I have not seen ""El Innocente"" yet, but am looking forward to it.",1214956800,6,3879,4.831325301204819
