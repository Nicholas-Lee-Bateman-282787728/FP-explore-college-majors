3157108,5,B0016JFDRE,"I love this. I'll admit I watched it a few times before I attempted the routine, but it has grown on me. I especially love combos 3 and 4. I talk myself through combos 1 and 2 because I know I have the last two to look forward to :-). I've always loved good music and this video has plenty of it. The moves are challenging (and I miss a few steps here and there), but it is worth the effort. The ab section is also unique and great. My Amy Bento collection has grown significantly since I discovered her last year; I hope she keeps creating these workouts.",1232928000,2,556,4.110091743119266
3157109,5,B0016JFDRE,"If you don't own this workout you don't know what you're missing! It's an intense workout, but so much fun and as mentioned by the other reviewers the music is great, current hit music - very motivating. Also, the ab section is phenomenal! I recently bought some kettlebells and it is perfect to use them here (Amy uses dumbbells). Love this workout!",1231718400,,350,4.661290322580645
3157110,5,B0016JFDRE,"This is one of my favorite cardio workouts, and I have so much fun doing it!  Amy's style of hi/lo aerobics is an athletic one, and you will really work with this one.  For comparison, I own almost all of Cathe Friedrich's cardio workouts, and this is tougher than many of Cathe's.

The workout is broken down into four hi/lo aerobics sections, and each one has a kickboxing interval at the end of it.  Amy also doesn't give a lot of breakdown in her cardio workouts, so you have to be patient in learning this one, and use your pause and rewind button a lot.  It took me a few times to get the choreography down, but, once I learned it, it's great to not have those constant breakdowns. This one also doesn't require quite as much space as her Hi/Lo Xtreme workout.

The music and energy on this are so great that I often tell myself that I'll only do two segments, but then I end up doing the entire workout since I'm having so much fun.  Amy's fun personality definitely shines through!

Highly recommended!",1227052800,6,1010,4.39247311827957
3157111,5,B0016JFDRE,"Amy Bento is such a good instructor.  She's tough but encouraging and friendly and makes you want to work.  This routine is more for advanced exercisers, but intermediates will find this a great challenge.
She combines aerobic favourites with high intensity bootcamp and kick boxing moves.  Your heart rate will be up there fast and long time.  The one thing I really loved is that the choreography isn't too tough to follow so it's easier to follow the moves and get the job done.  There are your usual repeaters, jumping jacks etc and then you might add arm movements to make it more intense.  They are all mixed in with the bootcamp and kickboxing portions and so it basically never lets up.  Her energy is what helps keep you going.  It's very infectious.  I also love the music here and that helps you out a lot too.
If you have some dumbbells, then you're good to go.  It's tough but worth it and while I've only done this three or four times, it definately gets a little easier each time and I can't wait for the day I can do it without stopping.  Again, she is a great instructor and this is sure to give you results.",1206748800,14,1125,4.386473429951691

8262721,1,B0016JFDRE,"I put this dvd in an shut if off within less than 5 mins.  I thought this would be a great workout because of all the positive reviews.  I was shocked after the first couple seconds that this workout actually had as many great reviews as it does.  I have worked out for 12 yrs. using dvds or videos. This is the 1st one I tossed in the trash.  I like Amy...she's very nice.  However, this is way too fast and crazy.  No way to focus on getting a great workout due to the fact that you have to figure out every move they are doing on your own with no modificaton of any kind.  It's so fast you can't concentrate.  Sorry, but this was officailly the worst excercise dvd I have ever purchased.  Thankful that I bought it used!!",1343088000,4,724,4.114285714285714
8262722,5,B0016JFDRE,"I am new to Amy Bento's workouts.  For some reason I never thought I would like floor aerobics so stuck with kick-boxing, Turbo Jam, step-aerobics etc.. for cardio.  I finally decided to try floor aerobics and chose this video because I like workouts that last an hour or longer.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved it.  I am a dancer by nature and pretty coordinated so I didn't have any problems getting the moves down the first time I tried this since she does repeat them several times. But I can definitely see this workout to be very frustrating if you are not coordinated.

I find the intensity to be high and there is quite a bit of high impact moves but they can be modified if you need to go lower impact.  I am having fun, sweating, and breathing hard while doing this workout and the time passes by pretty quickly.

I highly recommend this video if you are the type that can pick up moves quickly and for patient people who need to try a workout video several times to pick up new moves.

Its a great fat blaster!",1305590400,,1037,4.309278350515464
8262723,5,B0016JFDRE,"I love Amy Bento's workout videos!  As with her other videos, the choreography is a little complicated at first, but once you get the routine, it's great!  The first two combos are higher impact than the second two combos, but I definitely get into the anaerobic zone in Combos 3 and 4. In all 4 combos and knockout intervals, my heart stays in the 70-90% zone.

The core work at the end is challenging, yet enjoyable.  It's got the premixes for days when you're pressed for time and don't have 1:30 to work out. Overall, it's a great video and a great calorie burner.",1297382400,,568,4.4326923076923075
8262724,5,B0016JFDRE,"I really like this workout. It's tough and the choreography can be complicated but it's  great cardio.  It takes a few times of working out with it to catch on to the moves, which is okay with me because it keeps me from getting bored with the routine.  It is about 90 minutes long.  There are four ""combos"" with a different ""knockout"" between each combo.  You can select premixes at the beginning though, so you can do all combos, all knockouts, or two different combos with two different knockouts.  If you are looking for a great cardio workout and don't won't to be bored by the routine, then this is a great workout. Beware that the choreography is very challenging.",1279584000,,671,4.55
8262725,1,B0016JFDRE,"I exercise regularly and am in good shape.  I was looking forward to this workout because it was rated as ""advanced.""  I was very disappointed.  It is advanced because it is a very aerobic oriented  and complicated workout.  You must know the moves because there is no explanation or practicing the moves by Amy beforehand.  Basically she starts into the workouts at breakneck speed (literally).  She goes so fast that she can barely say what she is doing next before she is already doing it.  You could probably get the moves down after doing this workout 5-10 times, but really, I don't want to take the time to do that.  The reason I exercise at home is because I want to save time and I just want to exercise and feel like I'm getting a good workout.  I don't want to feel like I'm running around in circles trying to follow what is going on and wasting time.  Something like Jillian Michaels workouts are much better.  They are not complicated at all, but I really feel like I'm getting a good workout.  I have several workout videos that I do at home, but I will not be putting this video into my exercise rotation.",1268006400,6,1121,4.436274509803922
8262726,5,B0016JFDRE,"When I first got this workout I was at an intermediate level of fitness and could barely get through half the workout!  I thought I had reached the ninth circle of cardio hell!  lol, in a good way!  This, and other workouts, have helped reach an an dvanced level.  I can now complete this workout without any breaks.
It is an awesome workout, great music, fun moves, great energy.  I really love Amy Bento and have since bought a couple more of her workouts.  She gives you the feel of being in a really great class.  I just crank up the volume and the time flies by.  I have done this workout many times but still look forward to it.
There are great options for pre-mixed workouts if you can't quite tackle the entire thing right off the bat or don't have enough time.
Id say anyone who completes this workout can expect to burn in excess of 700 calories.",1266364800,,856,4.30625
8262727,2,B0016JFDRE,"I should've known that there would be trouble when I nearly ran into the wall trying to do the ""Axl Rose"" move. But after watching Amy Bento's latest dvd, ""All Cardio-Hi-Lo Knockout"" a few more times, I finally gave up and called it a day. This dvd was just too confusing for me. While I did work up a sweat, I was too frustruated after surviving all of the complex choreography to appreciate it. Heck, I was trying so hard to keep up with Bento and company's movements that I barely noticed the allegedly good background music mentioned by so many other reviewers! I recommend this dvd only to those with lots of time, patience, and living room space.",1245456000,8,652,4.487394957983193
8262728,5,B0016JFDRE,"This is one tough workout! Talk about sweating...this one will do it, as well as raise your heart rate BIG TIME...I hit 190.

There are 4 hi/lo combos and some cardio combos really frustrated me.  She does the moves (which are extremely fast & includes pivots) with little instruction.  After I do this workout a few more times, I am confident it will get much easier! In addition to the cardio, Amy does combat, kickboxing, and bootcamp moves that keep you moving!!!

Here's a list of some moves used in this DVD: grapevine movements, kick ball changes, repeater knees, pendulums, lunge chop - kicks, cross punches, chasses, rope, jump shot, pivots, arabesques, mountain climbers, speedbag, mambo, crossover sqauts, round house kicks, high kicks, shuffle touch ground, crescent kicks, jabs..as you can see it is a workout packed full of intense moves =)

The weighted core section (use 5 or 8 lbs) starts with some standing core work. On the floor, some variation on side plank moves, all while holding one weight.  Straight leg, tucked legs, and lift up with both weights....tough, effective core work!

Amy's All Cardio Hi-Low Knockout Workout is geared for intermediate to advanced exercisers! I highly recommend this - it is quite challenging =)  Those with knee problems probably should stay away from this one.",1245196800,7,1317,5.009174311926605
8262729,5,B0016JFDRE,"This workout is only for people who are at an intermediate or advanced level.  It is an awesome workout.  The music is great and the moves are fun.  She goes quick when learning the new routines, so you have to rewind and keep trying until you get it.  I would suggest watching your heart rate through the workout and make sure it does not get too high.  I noticed that would happen to me and I would just need to take out the arm movements or do an alternative movement that is lower impact. The more I do this workout, I am able to keep up more and more.  I would say this for all of her high impact workouts.",1234483200,2,611,4.05
