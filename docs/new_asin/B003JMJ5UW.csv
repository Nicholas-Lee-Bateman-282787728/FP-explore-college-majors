8398257,5,B003JMJ5UW,"The second collection of Eyeshield 21 starts after the exciting final game of Collection 1.  Now everyone at Daimon High knows they have a great football team, and hordes of guys are eager to try out--even though it involves taking part in Hiruma's fiendish endurance game.

Notable new Daimon characters are Komisubi, a muscle-bound midget who appoints himself Kurita's apprentice: and Yukimitsu, whose mother has never allowed him to join a club because it would take time away from his studies.  We also see the Ha-Ha brothers begin changing from playing under extortion to becoming dedicated football players, though that journey is not yet complete.  Suzuna also makes her first appearance, hired by the sportscasters to try and discover Eyeshield's secret identity.  She becomes a regular character later in the series. And Musashi finally begins to come into the storyline, as Sena discovers his name scratched on the TV with those of the other founders, and he later appears in a brief image when newscasters mention Daimon's lack of a kicker.

In football, Daimon challenges the Taiyu Sphinx, an Egyptian-themed team with linebackers who make Kurita look tiny.  Then they face a visiting American high school team, the NASA Aliens, featuring Panther, the man with zero-gravity legs, maybe even faster than Eyeshield 21.

Between the games are the usual helpings of comedy, personal growth, flashbacks, hopes and dreams. Hiruma continues to brandish an arsenal that would make the NRA drool.

Changes from the original: Besides those mentioned in the Collection 1 review, the team Wild Gunmans has been renamed to the more grammatical (but less entertaining) Wild Gunmen.

Special features: again, nothing besides Sentai Filmworks trailers.

If they go on to produce the next season, the Devil Bats will take a training trip to America, where they will undergo various grueling tests of endurance, teamwork and skill, meet old friends and make new ones, and generally prove that the writers have no idea what America is actually like.",1278892800,,2042,5.195121951219512
