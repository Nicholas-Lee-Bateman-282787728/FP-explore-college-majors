7914129,5,B00000K3D0,"If you like Jackie Chan, you know that ""Who Am I"" is one of his better quality movies. Replacement Killers is not a Jackie Chan movie. It was a good movie though with a different tone and mood than a Chan movie.",1495324800,,211,4.0476190476190474
7914130,2,B00000K3D0,This movie title is misleading. Jackie Chan is not even in this movie.  Chow Yun Fat is fantastic in this movie. (He deserves 4-5 stars).,1394064000,,137,4.48
7914131,4,B00000K3D0,"While I rarely agree with Maltin, I will say that I was SOMEWHAT disappointed with Replacement Killers.  The Corrupter was SOOO much better and would have been a more appropriate introduction for Chow Yun-Fat to Hollywood.  That being said -- I LOVE Mira Sorvino so it was still a GREAT movie with some GREAT action.  Just not as a good as The Corruptor, IMO.
'Who Am I?' roolz!  Nuff said.  You won't be disappointed with this DVD.",989280000,,432,4.558441558441558
7914132,4,B00000K3D0,"These are two excellent movies if you enjoy Hong Kong action movies. Being a big Jackie Chan fan, I thought Who Am I? is perhaps Jackie's best movie to date. Ditto for the Replacement Killers. Was reading the review for Titan AE and noticed that Maltin hated that movie also, BUT I remember Roger Ebert saying he really liked Titan AE because of its great graphics. If like me you hate Maltin's reviews so much that you use him as a contra-critic (you like what he hates)--these two movies are for you. Both have terrific action sequences with more action than in  5 American action movies each. And if you like Jackie Chan's playful comedic style of movies you will love both of these great  action movies. Replacement Killers will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next. A super combination of two movies, rare when so many companies are packaging movies like this with one bad movie put with one good one--I assure you this is not the case here.",969667200,5,971,4.542857142857143
7914133,5,B00000K3D0,"A perfectly executed painting, set in motion, and wrapped around a simple story.  This is a piece of art. A series of beautiful images and motion. Colors and movement flow from scene to scene taking the viewer into a deep  realm of perfect design.  If your the kind of viewer who involves  themselves in a visual experience, you can't go wrong. If your looking for  a story to blow your circuits and change you forever.... don't be lazy, go  buy a book.",940464000,4,453,4.463414634146342
