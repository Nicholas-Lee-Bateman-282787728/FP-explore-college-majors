1078285,4,6305816611,"I happened upon this film one evening while surfing the channels and could not stop watching it. The first thing that grabbed me was that it is very odd. A mentally challenged boy plays with a toy plane that seems to summon a flying and flamboyant couple to crash into the roof of the boy's unhappy household. At first, I could not tell if this film was a drama or comedy. The heated and serious subject matter of the two parents still burdened with guilt over their son's debilitating accident makes me lean to the former that has some lighter moments thrown in (the funny comments of Yasmine Bleeth's character, an airhead with plenty of wisdom). The couple who crash in (outgoing and sometimes silly) help the parents recapture their magic and prompt them to deal with their guilt. They also seem to fortell a brighter future for the family which has me believe this crazy couple were unorthodox ""saints"" or ""angels"" of sort (the film never clears this up). Still, a major outburst is needed before peace can be had in this household. An often suspenseful film that is beautifully acted.",1029715200,12,1090,4.682291666666667
1078286,5,6305816611,"A small plane crashes onto the roof of a house.
A family torn apart by a tragedy involving there young son(Played by the talented Kevin Zegers)is on the verge of a Divorce until the strange Man and woman in the plane come into there lives and turn things around.
Christopher Looyd and Jasmine Bleeth are great as the soon to be married couple and John Ritter is great as the bitter husband and father of his brain damaged young son.
The film has a good underlying message that Love and a positive
attitude to traumatic events will conquer all.
Very good cast and a film well worth seeing",999993600,6,587,4.444444444444445
1078287,3,6305816611,A good cast makes this strange little movie watchable and enjoyable. A pilot crashes his plane through the roof of a house occupied by a couple who are both sick of each other. John Ritter and Christopher Loyd are both terrific. This movie is a refreshing change of pace from the normal Hollywood formula films. It's worth seeing for that reason alone. Some will find it too slow but it really is unique. If only there weren't so many unanswered questions at the end. Who was Christopher Loyd supposed to be? Was he a con man? Was he a bum? Then how could he afford to charter his own plane? Why did he lie about owning an insurance company? John Ritter is perfect as a frustrated father/husband. He's kind of a jerk yet you really feel for him and care what happens during this night of strange events. This is kind of like watching a play. Definitely worth a look.,995500800,7,866,4.41875
1078288,2,6305816611,"Stars Christopher Lloyd, Yasmine Bleeth, John Ritter, JoBeth Williams, Kevin Zeger. There are some film's whose heart's are in the right places but just don't have enough ooomph to rise above the ordinary. This is such  a film. What sounds like a B-monster movie is actually a comedy/drama about  a group of people who do some self-discovering and resolve some issues over  one fateful night. Ritter, Williams and Zeger, make up an Unhappy  family,whose day to day live seems to be keeping their ""special""  son, Andy, happy and functioning. Mother is a bit too obsessive with taking  care of her boy, whilst Dad is just plain unhappy. Then one day, when Andy  make believes he crashes his toy plane into his toy house, a real plane  crashes into their roof, and out comes an odder than odd couple (Lloyd,  Ritter) on their way to Vegas for Valentines Day. What ends up happening is  the Guests end up staying around for a while, and also bring a bit of magic  and life back into the household and help with Andy too. The film's got  some good messages in it, but it is a bit odd. As for plot holes, there are  aplenty. At the start when Andy seems to make his toy plane crash,  resulting in the plane crashing for real, we assume he must have some kind  of magical power. We never learn anymore about it though. As for Lloyd's  shady insurance agent, we never quite work out whether or not he is the  shonky con-man Ritter suspects he is. Anyway for what it's worth, this will  fill an afternoon in.**3/4",963187200,7,1504,4.487084870848708

I don't think enough is known about it but I just finished it with tears of joy running down my face. The last minutes of this film are so outstanding it defies description..All I can say, man, woman or child--don't miss this hidden treasure Please!  P.S.  It is NOT a science fiction film as the title suggests.",1348358400,,474,4.075268817204301
7895346,4,6305816611,"John Ritter and Jo Beth Williams play a couple whose marriage is being torn apart by unresolved guilt over a swimming pool accident which left their son (Kevin Zegers) mentally impaired.

In one of the many fantasy elements that permeate the movie, Zegers' playing with a toy airplane somehow resonates and interacts with a real plane flown by an eccentric millionaire (Christopher Lloyd) and his beautiful-but-ditzy girlfriend (Yasmine Bleeth).  Mysteriously guided and controlled by the boy's actions with his toy plane, the real plane crashes into the roof of the family home, without injury to either the occupants of the plane or the house.  Perhaps here there is a hint of the Hermetic principle of ""as it is below, so it is  above.""

This begins an interaction between the two couples in which the mysterious millionaire and his girlfriend act as catalysts for deep soul-searching and healing between Ritter and Williams.  Lloyd offers homespun wisdom and Bleeth offers womanly consolation which at times has an overtly sexual quality.  So there's a Freudian element here, along with a deeply spiritual element, for one eventually gets the feeling that Lloyd and Bleeth are in fact angels in disguise.

Films which combine realism and fantasy are hard to evaluate and hard to make work, but I think this movie succeeds.  I found it very moving and I've watched it several times.",1116547200,5,1385,5.0394736842105265

7895348,5,6305816611,"This was a really great movie.  Going into it I thought it might be aimed at a younger audience, but that wasn't the case at all, as there was some profanity and adult subject matter.  At one part in the movie the 13 year old brain damaged son gets a hard on watching Pepper (Yasmine Bleeth) while having his feet massaged by his doting mother, much to everyone's embarrassment.  The entire cast was excellent, Kevin Zegers in particular.  Zegers was the movies principle character, and he played the part out beautifully.  It reminded me of a similiar role that Leonardo DiCaprio played in Whats Eating Gilbert Grape, in that he was so convincing in the role you actually believed he was brain damaged just as DiCaprio pulled off his role as a retarded boy.
There were a few bonuses such as commentary and such, and the movie really is a must see (and own in my opinion.)",1055462400,10,872,4.528662420382165
