8606583,5,B001M1JOI0,"One of my favorite interpretations of A Christmas Carol.  This one was slightly cheese and politically incorrect with a big helping of pidgin, but that's what makes it funny.  This is most definitely a new Christmas Tradition!",1459036800,,226,5.081081081081081
8606584,5,B001M1JOI0,"I'm a Japanese-American, my dad is from Hawaii but I was raised off the island. I agree that there is a lot of ethnic humor, but it is very funny and everyone in my family (on the islands and on the mainland) love this show. I'm buying the DVD this year because my wife and kids have never seen what I grew up watching on a beta video.",1417651200,4,335,3.9411764705882355
8606585,1,B001M1JOI0,"I have collected more than four dozen versions of A Christmas Carol, and this is my least favorite.  It is culturally insensitive, politically incorrect, anti-Japanese in particular, anti-oriental/Pacific Islander in general, and includes transvestism.  Although it is obviously intended to be humorous, I find it more repulsive than amusing.",1387152000,,342,5.959183673469388
8606586,5,B001M1JOI0,"Okay, I know this is supposed to be a review. But I remember this when it originally aired in 1982 when I was living in Hawaii. I have ordered it and cannot wait to see it again! After 26 years, a VHS recording will only look so good. Frank DeLima's humor is timeless so I'm sure I will love it just as much today as I did when I was 12!",1227916800,5,337,3.76056338028169
