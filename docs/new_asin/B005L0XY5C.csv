4719203,5,B005L0XY5C,"This is my first exposure to Bethenny Frankel; I picked up this DVD on a whim and I am so glad I did.  It is a great addition to my workout DVDs and I find myself choosing it before some of the others.  Her relaxed, ""you don't have to be perfect"" style is refreshing and their banter is engaging enough not to be annoying several workouts later.  The DVD flows nicely between the three workouts and I often find myself extending into the next workout just because I enjoy it so much. The poses are a good mix of challenging and attainable with unique additions that I haven't seen in other yoga workouts.  Mike keeps you moving throughout with steady variety.  A great buy!",1320624000,2,673,4.395161290322581
4719204,5,B005L0XY5C,"I love this. I find Bethenny to be hilarious, and she doesn't disappoint in this workout. She is real and you don't feel like an idiot when she's honest about what positions are still hard for her. It's not the meditative yoga you might find elsewhere, but it's an amazing workout and then some!",1318636800,4,295,4.481481481481482
4719205,3,B005L0XY5C,I got this at Target. I love Bethenny so of course I had to buy it as soon as I saw it.  It was okay to me.  But I like her first video better. I like the instructor in her first workout better too. I had the desire to do her first video multiple times(and still do). I do not have that desire with this one. Not sure why just not my preference or what I expected.,1318291200,,364,3.7142857142857144
4719206,4,B005L0XY5C,"First of all, I'd like to say that I credit Bethenny Frankel (and Kristin McGee) for helping me lose some weight and get into better shape with the Body by Bethenny DVD that I LOVE. I saw this new DVD while shopping at Target and had to have it, and while the workout is awesome, I just have minor issues that bothered me a little bit.

Good things first. Like I said, the workout is great, and about as challenging as Body by Bethenny was. Not overly so but still...it's not easy. The new trainer, Mike, is wonderful. His calm approach and quirky sense of humor eased me through the workout, and I will say that time FLIES on this thing. I like to do at least 35 minutes worth of exercise, so about 2 segments, and yeah, I'm done before I know it. Having the three segments instead of the one long yoga segment in Body by Bethenny is a plus, because you get to chose what you feel like doing each day and it feels like less of an undertaking.

Now for the minor issues. There seems to be something wrong with the DVD menu. Whenever I select one of the segments specifically on the DVD, I expect it to play that segment and then return me to the menu page--but that never happens. For example, I only wanted to do the first 15 minute segment one day, and I was just waiting for it to end and return to the menu, but it kept going onto the second segment. I didn't realize I'd been working out for 25 minutes until I looked at the timer. It's not a huge deal, but the fact that it does this doesn't make very much sense. Secondly, my one gripe with the workout is that there is a LOT more balancing stuff than Body by Bethenny. I understand the importance of balance, but as Bethenny says, somedays you can do it and somedays you can't. And when you can't do it and they're holding multiple balancing poses for long periods of time, it gets frustrating and annoying. Body by Bethenny had the tree pose and warrior 3, but that's it, and if I couldn't balance I was only missing out on about 2 minutes of exercise. When I can't balance and I'm missing pose after pose on this DVD, it feels like I'm wasting time.

But like I said, these are just minor problems. I can definitely look past them and say I'm happy I bought this DVD, and I will be using it just as much as Body by Bethenny, which is a lot.",1317513600,23,2300,4.175675675675675
4719207,5,B005L0XY5C,"I have never really done yoga before, but wanted to get into it.  I will admit that I am a huge fan of Bethenny.  I think she's wonderful and I love her sense of humor so when I saw this at a big-box store I knew I had to own it.  I figured if anyone could make yoga accessible it would be Bethenny and I was right.  She doesn't always do every pose perfectly and doesn't always do the ""advanced"" option, which I find refreshing.  To me there is nothing worse than a workout DVD that the person is so stiff and does everything perfectly....kinda makes me feel like a failure.  The dynamic between Bethenny and Mike McArdie is great - very relaxed and enjoyable.

I really like the 3 workouts that you can pick and choose from and the 12 minute stretch is awesome.  It is NOT an easy workout - just challenging enough to push you, but not so impossible that you want to give up.  I'm looking forward to using this for a long time in the future.",1316995200,46,943,4.165745856353591

4719214,5,B005L0XY5C,This DVD is amazing! I am already noticing results after doing it four consecutive days. The workouts are manageable given the time frames and various poses based on your flexibility. I would recommend this to beginners and advanced yogis!,1419897600,,239,5.153846153846154
4719215,5,B005L0XY5C,Great workout!  I wish it told me how many times I would have to do the workout until I looked like Bethenny! :),1405382400,,112,3.869565217391304
4719216,3,B005L0XY5C,This is a really easy DVD for beginners.  I didn't feel like i got a really good workout from the DVD.  I love Bethenny but she talks WAY too much in this DVD.,1400198400,,159,3.787878787878788
4719217,5,B005L0XY5C,"If you are looking to get into yoga this is the best dvd to start! It's not your typical super slow/boring yoga session...you really move in the dvd! I was traveling and needed something to work out to that didn't require weights. I didn't really do yoga before, because I prefer more high intensity training. Well, this dvd got me hooked to yoga, within days, i felt and saw changes in my body. I'm way more leaner and more flexible than I have ever been. I do yoga before I hit the gym, and it makes my workout so much better! so happy i found this dvd.",1393632000,2,555,4.196261682242991
4719218,5,B005L0XY5C,"Such an awesome, easy to follow workout! I have tried other yoga videos before, and couldn't keep up. This doesn't even feel like a workout, but I am sore and feel amazing afterwards. SO happy that I purchased this. I've been doing this for about two weeks now and haven't missed a day. It has become my ""morning coffee!""",1386115200,,321,4.4576271186440675

4719220,5,B005L0XY5C,"I started this dvd a year ago, I could only do the first part, some of the second part. The more I worked on it and when I was able to finish I felt so good! This is more than a yoga workout, it will seriously get you into shape. And bethenny's talking during the dvd is encouraging, she keeps saying if you can't do it, skip it! Then when I don't skip it I feel really good about myself ha ha.",1382918400,,394,3.817073170731707
4719221,3,B005L0XY5C,"I liked this yoga workout in theory, especially the aspect of being able to do 15, 30, and 45 increments. The workout is pretty good as well, challenging enough with interesting shifts from pose to pose. The problem is Bethenny, who I usually like on reality television, but don't when I'm trying to zone out and do some yoga. Her voice tears into your zen-like state with arbitrary comments that aren't very helpful but feel more like a constant reminder that THIS IS HER YOGA DVD, HER BRAND. And it's annoying. Also, the vocal instructions are sometimes unclear, so you're constantly looking at the screen when to figure out what you're supposed to be doing, which, in my opinion isn't a strong characteristic for a yoga DVD.
One positive? Cookie makes an appearance!
I'd suggest this DVD for people that really like Bethenny Frankel and find her acquired brand of charm endearing enough to put up with her endless yapping.",1381708800,,925,4.7875
4719222,4,B005L0XY5C,"I thought I would use this to lose weight... but in reality I use it to strech every morning or relax on the weekends.

4719226,4,B005L0XY5C,"These are very good workouts, but you may need to adapt them to your own needs. Anyone with MS or other neurological problems, you may not be able to maintain the poses balanced on one foot. Just hold on to the back of a chair. You're still getting a good workout.

One other thing I couldn't understand, though: in the first section, Bethenny and Michael agree that they never do crunches, and then in a later section, they do them.

Like other viewers, I appreciated Bethenny's not being perfect, but talking back to the instructor.",1375142400,,534,4.610526315789474

4719228,5,B005L0XY5C,"Bethenny is fantastic in her dvd's. Her humor and sarcasm help ease a challenging work out. She is very relatable and I hope that she makes more dvd's. This is separated in three segments so if I am feeling tired one day, I do one, if I am up for more of a challenge, I will do all three. The instructor is humerous as well and this is an upbeat workout!",1372982400,,354,4.0
4719229,3,B005L0XY5C,"I wanted a yoga video, and got two workouts, so that's awesome.  Except, Bethenny talks and almost criticizes ALL the way through the yoga.  Since I'm not a Bethenny follower, maybe that's part of her overall appeal.  I like the workout, but may turn the sound off.

She is quite skinny.  I'll give her that!!!",1372809600,,310,4.5636363636363635

4719235,5,B005L0XY5C,Loving this workout. It's challenging but fun and I feel better after I do it. Bethany is funny and makes you want to stick with it. I recommend this to anyone wanting to try yoga for the first time or just wants a toned healthy body.,1359244800,,234,4.108695652173913
4719236,5,B005L0XY5C,"I love this workout DVD, even bought it twice and downloaded on my IPad for when I travel.  Easy to follow and is a great workout and I love that it is divided into three segments, so I can do one, two or all three, depending on the amount of time I have.  I love Bethenny Frankel, I also bought her book from you, Skinny Dipping, and I am reading it now.  Aloha from Hawaii, Cheryl",1357948800,3,382,4.0

4719238,3,B005L0XY5C,"i love bethenny and this was just ok. her trainer should really get the credit for this. ""bethenny"" did not shine through, i did not feel like i was doing yoga with her (to keep it light and funny) which to me, was the whole point.",1356220800,,231,4.043478260869565
4719239,3,B005L0XY5C,"This is a unique, fairly challenging yoga flow with some balance moves.  However there are two errors - I docked a star for each:
At 7:07 in the first segment Mike has you step your right foot forward into a deep runners lunge for the second time - omitting runners lunge on the left side.
At  9:50 in the third segment (or 44:50 if you're doing all three segments back to back) after flying pigeon on the left side, he forgets to take you into standing, split leg hamstring fold (as he did on the right side) - I honestly think this is because Bethenny has distracted him by saying that pigeon is actually a triceps exercise (??).
There is also way too much chatter, to the extent that it interferes with the flow and some poses are held much longer one side than the other whilst Mike waits for Bethenny to finish talking.
That said, I still use the DVD once in a while, correcting the errors, and stopping for a sip of coffee when they start to chat and hold you in a pose too long.",1354406400,4,985,4.23404255319149

4719241,5,B005L0XY5C,Easy to do and feel great afterwards!  Recommend it for anyone who has limited time.  Bethany is amazing! Love her,1347667200,,114,4.65
4719242,1,B005L0XY5C,"It was not the case of the chatter between Bethenny and her instructor or perhaps it was, it was that there is no mix and match feature here. In other words, when I chose to do just workout 1, it jumped right to workout 2 and the rest of the DVD. Plus, this DVD should be considered advanced since most of the poses are sort of confusing and difficult for someone like me who is not all that flexible at all.  Other than that, I hope Mike McArdle will be out with more yoga DVDs in the near future.  He was not bad at all as instructor.  But Bethenny's chatter often interrupted with his teachings which caused some confusion as too what the moves I was supposed to be doing.",1343606400,2,675,4.176923076923077

4719244,2,B005L0XY5C,"The workout itself was ok.  I like how it showed different moves and how it didn't put too much pressure on you to be able to do so much at the beginning, but Bethenny  just wouldn't stop talking.  It got to the point where it was just annoying to listen to her.  I wouldn't do the workout again.",1341014400,,296,4.051724137931035
4719245,1,B005L0XY5C,"Not even one star. I usually don't mind instructors talking during workout dvd's and videos, especially in yoga or yoga-type workouts, where their talking is so often necessary in preventing students' having to look up  tv all the time as we learn. But there was just WAY too much idle chatter in this dvd. The majority of the yoga instructor's vocal and non-vocal instruction in this dvd is constantly interrupted by Bethenny. She even interferes with verbal instruction. This was so jarring and unhelpful I gave the dvd away after my first use--I just can't be craning my neck thru an entire workout dvd, especially a yoga one, in a vain effort to follow the instruction and the yoga flow. I have nothing against Bethenny, who seems like a nice person. But this dvd should not have been released as it is. Very amateurish and not helpful at all.",1340582400,2,847,4.684563758389261
4719246,4,B005L0XY5C,"I'm a fan of Bethenny Frankel, so first off if you don't like comments made throughout the video, you probably won't like this workout. If you like Bethenny and know her personality then it shouldn't bother you. I find them funny and it makes you feel good to know that Bethenny is not a ""yogaramma"" just like me. :-)

I have done the video twice now. I will admit the first time I didn't like it. It was not what I expected at all and was completely different from the first workout video. Body by Bethenny focuses more on a Vinyasa sort of yoga so its a lot of flowing through chaturanga and back to downward dog. This video still has some flowing but it is more advanced with the downward dog splits and more variety of movements. This video reminds me more of the yoga classes that I attend in the studio versus another yoga DVD.

The instructor is great but doesn't always explain things as well which is why I was not as fond of the video at first. I felt that Kristin McGee did a better job of that. But I caught on pretty quickly with my decent knowledge of yoga poses.

Overall I like the video and I know that the more I do it the more I will like it. I love the stretch segment as well and the fact that the video is broken into segements for days when you don't have time to do a full hour long session.",1337126400,3,1315,4.12890625

4719250,2,B005L0XY5C,"I just received this DVD and watched the first 10 minutes today - that's all I could take. It was really too difficult for beginners, requiring aerobic and strength moves (push-ups and thrusters) and balance that is difficult if you're overweight or overage (older than 25, that is!). I'm 58 and about 30 lbs. over weight, if that helps you decide if this is for you.

Plus, there is no instruction, just straight into the moves, which are difficult to see on the TV when you're bent into a pretzel, looking at your toes. I think I'd rather take a class to have a live instructor correct my moves.

P.S. Oh, did I say that Bethenny makes quirky little comments throughout? That will also get annoying after the 3rd time of watching!",1332720000,6,732,4.537878787878788

One of the things I love about yoga is that you can make it as easy or as difficult as you want. I like that Bethenny is a ""real"" person --- she isn't claiming to know all there is to know about yoga.

I've never done yoga before and this DVD professed to be for people of all levels. I found it difficult to do most of the positions properly because I had to keep looking at the tv so I knew what I was doing. Also, many of the moves were quite difficult for an inexperienced person. There wasn't enough explanation or time given to perform each new move before moving on to the next. Also, I can easily see how someone could seriously hurt themselves if the moves aren't done properly. It does give a fantastic stretch..but aren't you only suppose to stretch warm muscles? Anyway, if you've done yoga before, this would be quite enjoyable I'm sure. However, if you've never done it, I would suggest taking a class for some hands on training.",1331078400,4,894,4.5246913580246915

I just got it last week and I'm hooked. It's much more intense and challenging than the first one. I was really sore the next day, in a good way that made me feel like I got a good workout. It's a more fast-paced yoga -- you don't hold the poses for very long but instead move quickly from pose to pose. It really works your abs, butt, and arms. I plan on doing this workout often, maybe alternating days with the first DVD.

Bonus: While the workout itself is awesome, my favorite part of the DVD is Cookie's cameo.

If you love Bethenny, this is a must-buy!",1327276800,14,736,4.068965517241379

I popped it into my DVD player and started with workout #1. I was thinking that I would do workout #1 and #3 which are both 15 minute sessions so I began with #1 and immediately I could hear my back cracking with some of the first moves.  I could really feel all of the stretches and this workout did not feel boring AT ALL. I didn't know that after the first 15 minutes it would take you to the next workout (20 minutes) immediately but time went by so fast that I didn't notice until I saw a brief pause on the screen when it was taking me to the third workout.  The 35 minutes I did went by so fast and were very enjoyable, I would have continued to do the last 15 minute workout but I had to get going with my daily schedule.

It was a little difficult but Bethenny always says that it doesn't have to be perfect and that it WILL be tough at first.  It was challenging but fun and this is the first Yoga DVD that I have truly enjoyed.  I can definitely see myself improving.

Bottom line: this is a great DVD and you should purchase it; especially if you are a ""begginer Yogi"" and want to try a fun Yoga DVD for a change.",1325635200,3,1353,4.0

8477292,1,B005L0XY5C,"Instructor is very good and positive. However, hostess is very chatty. It's not only distracting but also annoying. Don't like that she overrides instructor's directions, i.e. I am going to do this instead. I would still keep the DVD if her vocie can be turned off. It's going back.",1485561600,,282,4.775510204081633
8477293,5,B005L0XY5C,"Don't let Bethenny fool you!  This is one yoga workout where you will work! This one is not for relaxation but rather strength and flexibility. The yoga is constantly flowing. Some of the movements are quite challenging and some are unique, at least to me. Most yoga DVDs have the same ole poses. McArdle is an excellent instructor and is worth every penny. I highly recommend this workout.",1476316800,,390,4.735294117647059

8477295,3,B005L0XY5C,I rented this DVD from the library.  I like the overall moves and found it really opens my body up.  Bethenny talks way too much though and it's distracting.  I use my yoga for both exercise and relaxation and the excessive talking got annoying.  It would be better if there were two versions of the workouts...one to use as you're learning the workout and need the commentary and then a version that just includes some prompts to guide  you as you get used to the routine.,1470441600,,473,4.453488372093023
8477296,5,B005L0XY5C,"I love it!! Sometimes Bethenny gets a little chatty, but then so do I (in my head). I really appreciate the 3 workouts, even though it's more like one big workout broken up. Since its yoga, I don't think you need the traditional warm up if you decide to start #2 or #3. I have the other DVD, Body By Bethenny and love that one too. Bethenny PLEASE do another yoga DVD! I feel like these yoga workouts are so approachable. Unlike others where the instructor is doing a voice over rather than talking directly to the camera or to someone in the video; which is so odd in my opinion.  Also unlike over DVDs where everyone is so damn serious, calm, and seemingly ultra focused, this one (and the other) is more like real life. Chat, make comments or jokes, offer variations, show the instructor losing their balance a little, or the dog (Cookie) walking in the background.  That's real life!  I still feel super relaxed, zen, and my body feels good.
Confession, I love the Shaun T. Insanity and T25 workouts, but for health reasons I am unable to do them (hopefully I can again in the future). The thought of doing yoga was not very motivating - I only enjoyed this one yoga class/show that used to come on TV at 6am on Oxygen. I am happy that I found some yoga workouts that I like and motivate me - Bethenny's DVDs (and also Jillian Michaels').",1469318400,3,1342,4.381526104417671
8477297,5,B005L0XY5C,I really enjoy Bethenny's yoga workouts. They're not too long and you really feel like you get a fantastic total body workout. I've done many yoga workouts and this is one of my favorite DVD's.,1468454400,,193,4.542857142857143

8477299,5,B005L0XY5C,Highly recommend. I Love these DVDs!  I have just recently started doing yoga I am no pro and these are simple but effective yoga workouts. Bethenney DVDs gives you the option to do what ever amount of time you have to workout whether 15 min or up to 55 min. The workout is so smooth that before I know it I have a 55 min.yoga workout done. I have used these for about a month now and am seeing definition in muscles! Love these DVDs!,1456444800,,434,4.105882352941176
