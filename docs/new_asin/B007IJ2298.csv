5089078,5,B007IJ2298,This is a great DVD to explain the Eucharist to small children.  My grand-daughter love this DVD and has watched it several times.  I would recommend this DVD especially to children before they make their First Holy Communion.,1395532800,2,226,4.921052631578948
5089079,5,B007IJ2298,My 4 year old daughter loved this and was singing along with the songs after the first watch. She wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over! Well worth the purchase. I bought a few Catholic videos for children recently and this was the only one that was watchable and entertaining while teaching important things about what being Catholic is all about.,1393459200,6,358,4.523076923076923
5089080,5,B007IJ2298,"This was presented in a loving way, not scary for young students and very meaning full. Good job. Will purchase forgiven also.",1392681600,3,126,4.7727272727272725
5089081,5,B007IJ2298,The reaction from the children was very positive - they were singing the songs within short order. It competed very well with the contemporary TV dross.,1386892800,2,152,4.884615384615385
5089082,5,B007IJ2298,"This video is approximately 29 minutes long, but don't let the length fool you. It is CRAMMED with fun and information. From the Bible alone, your children will see cartoon versions of The Last Supper, Jesus' Resurrection, and The Parable of the Vine and the Branches. They will also learn the story of a lesser known saint in Blessed Imelda Lambertini. She was just a little girl who's love of Jesus and the Eucharist filled her heart. She is also the patron saint of First Communicants. Lastly, there two songs for your kids to sing along with.

I'm not sure if any of you parents, catechists, or teachers out there have ever tried to find Catholic cartoons for kids, but they are hard to come by. There are a glut of Christian/Protestant DVDs, but the few Catholic ones out there are usually high on the theology scale and low on the graphic scale, not so with Brother Francis! The Brother Francis DVDs are great theologically with Bible stories and saints, and graphically, as you get a mix of both 3-D animation and 2-D animation. It also has the option to watch it in Spanish, if you are part of your Church's Hispanic ministry. Get this 5 star DVD and pair it with the coloring and activity book to help your kid(s) prepare for their First Communion.",1363996800,10,1257,4.561946902654867
5089083,5,B007IJ2298,"We have been big fans of ""The Friar"" from the EWTN, but had never seen this one.  I was nervous so spend the money without knowing, but it is worth it.  Very well done. I am looking forward to ordering the rest of the episodes.",1354492800,8,227,4.022222222222222

5089086,5,B007IJ2298,"My kids love this DVD. The songs are catchy and the animation is better than in a lot of other religious kids programs. The theology is solid and presented in a way that is interesting and understandable for kids without dumbing it down or skipping important points. They really couldn't have done a better job, and I will be buying the rest of the episodes in the series.",1428105600,,372,4.485294117647059

5089093,4,B007IJ2298,This video is geared toward four to six year olds. It was fine for my 8 year olds preparing for Holy Communion but they seemed a bit bored by some of the longer songs. It's tough to find Catholic videos for kids so I'd recommend this video.,1398124800,5,240,4.127659574468085
