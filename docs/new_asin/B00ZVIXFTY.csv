8721026,3,B00ZVIXFTY,"This Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) event is their annual tag team tournament with the winners walking out the P.W.G. Tag Team Champions due to the champions defending their title in each tournament match.

The opening round of the tournament featured matches such as the Beaver Boys vs. Team Tremendous in their P.W.G. debut that saw some humorous moments such as hip tosses & dropkicks executed from the lowest position possible resulting in both men having a ""double charlie horse"", Biff Busick & Drew Gulak vs. Inner City Machine Guns in a clash of grounded submission wrestling & athletic high flying styles, Mike Bailey & Matt Sydal vs. Andrew Everett & Trevor Lee in a evenly matched contest, and P.W.G. Tag Team Champions World's Cutest Tag Team vs. Monster Mafia in a back & forth match that saw everything from the ""Kiss My Ass Club"" to ""LaRae 3:16"" along with an unexpected surprise.  The rest of the tournament saw Monster Mafia against Beaver Boys in a competitive match while Andrew Everett & Trevor Lee fought the Inner City Machine Guns with many references to other P.W.G. alumni along with other ""electrifying"" superstars and with the finals being Beaver Boys vs. Andrew Everett & Trevor Lee that saw one team take extreme shortcuts to get an advantage with the match getting more intense as time went on.  Non-tournament matches include Johnny Gargano vs. T.J. Perkins in a heavily submission based match & P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong vs. Brian Cage vs. Chris Hero where clearly there was an odd man out who kept trying to be very sneaky but kept getting caught with each man interacting with each other leading to some moves having a domino effect onto two or all three competitors.

Usually you can never go wrong with a P.W.G. show but I would say that the quality here was a step down from their previous DDT4 events but it's still an event to check out.",1438214400,,1883,4.7846153846153845
