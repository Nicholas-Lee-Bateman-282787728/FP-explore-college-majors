different endings. Hard to find, many thanks.",1405123200,2,167,5.461538461538462
7878773,5,6304890621,"I have tried searching for this film, that is known as ABOVE THE LAW, not knowing it is under another name. It is a very good film and quite entertaining too. Go buy it",1155600000,,168,3.9705882352941178
7878774,5,6304890621,"This is hands down Yuen Biao's and Cynthia Rothrock's best movie! I'm not much of a fan of either of them, but this movie displays some of the best martial arts I have seen. The movie is extremely violent as well with a little gun-fu. Don't get me wrong tho, there is more hand to hand stuff here that'll get you pumped up. The story, Yuen Biao is a lawyer trying to prosecute 2 mobster-like individuals for arranging a hit on Biao's friend and his friend's family...without evidence, Biao decides to take matters in his own hands, but he is being trailed by a policewoman (Rothrock)...Biao will end up being at the wrong place at wrong time, and Rothrock will wrongfully accuse him...from then on its pretty much about finding the truth and RIGHTING WRONGS. Both Biao and Rothrock show their best stuff here and all of the fighting is clear and insanely brutal...Don't be fooled of the age of the film, a lot of classic martial arts flicks come from the 80's. Not only that, but the stunts are real here as well, and there are some crazy and awesome acrobatic moves in this film (although Rothrock doesnt really do hers). As for which version to get, I got the dual sided Universe version and Im assuming this is the original since this is a major HK dvd distributor. Either way, this movie is simply one of the best...it's definitely somewhere in my top 10 best martial arts flick...think of this movie as Michelle Yeoh's Royal Warriors with a lot more fighting and violence. The ending is quite unusual and it'll probably make you think, ""Oh, it's one of those movies"". Enough praise, I could go on forever...all martial arts fans should at least view this movie if not own it...check it out!!!!!!",1011571200,6,1700,4.595394736842105
7878775,5,6304890621,"Why?  Because it is a double-sided disk, with two different endings, and other scenes which are found in one version, are not in the other.  No, I'm not giving anything away here.
This is an incredible film!  The martial arts of Yuen Biao are unsurpassed.  This film was nominated for a Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography.  Wu Ma's heartbreaking performance was also nominated in the the Best Supporting Actor category...",1010880000,6,436,4.917808219178082
7878776,5,6304890621,"WOW.  OK, this movie is a classic hardcore awesome martial arts movie.  I love this film.  I first saw the English dubbed version when I was young and it blew my mind away.  I had seen a few Van Damme movies before I was  enlightened by Yuen Biao and all the Hong Kong martial artists that  followed.  The speed, the viciousness, the martial arts, everything.  Later  on (many years of searching for this film - thank you Amazon.com) I saw the  Chinese one (original version) with subtitles to help me out and was blown  away again.  This `is' the movie that inspired me to do martial arts,  Kung-fu.
The action is great and all the fighters duke it out without  being the average flippy flashy ninja people. Yuen Biao is great.  Fast and  flexible, not a bad actor either. Biao is a friend of Jackie Chan, and has  been a goof in Dragons Forever, but this movie is hardcore and serious.  Cynthia Rothrock, I have lots of respect for her.  She is one of the best  female martial artists that I have seen.  I admire that woman a lot (only  in her good films though, so beware of the bad ones). This movie was made  in the mid 80s, so it has a neat look and score to it.  I like the song in  the credits.  The plot is actually not that bad.  A lawyer who has seen  many criminals get away and put in jail for a long time or short time, gets  fed up with the law system and goes out to enforce it by hand (Yuen Biao).  Cynthia plays a cop who follows the law to strike down the lawbreakers.  They both fight to serve the law, but both on different terms.  Sooner or  later, it gets time to get down and dirty, better to say, down and bloody.  There are more one on one fight sequences than one versus many.
If you  want to see this movie, I recommend that you get the Chinese one with  English subtitles. In the Dubbed one, they said that it was all in Tokyo.  Come on, Tokyo?  It's Hong Kong!  Personally I feel the dubbed one is a  sell out in some of the lines.  The Chinese one contains a few more scenes  (I think - if memory serves me) and the dialog is much better.  The ending  in the Chinese one is very different from the ending in the Dubbed version  that I saw some years ago (memory serves me on that). I like the Chinese  ending better.  If you have the time and money then get both, then you can  make the decision for yourself, I won't tell you either endings.",955497600,13,2373,4.134657836644592
7878777,5,6304890621,"This is one of the most action packed/stunt filled movies ever filmed. This film takes no prisoners, and pulls no stops, and the ending leaves you breathless. While most of Rothrock's movies are far under par, she does  have a few decent HK films, this one being the best; and Yuen having his  greatest fight scenes since Dragon's Forever(co-starring J. Chan). This has  my vote for greatest action movie of all time!",945302400,5,417,4.763888888888889
