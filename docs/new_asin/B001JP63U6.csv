3658857,4,B001JP63U6,"Reviews for different versions, releases and formats of BLACK SABBATH are lumped together.  The movie which I streamed via Amazon is the American version of the film.  No subtitles. No ""adult"" themes.  Look elsewhere for the international release of this movie.  It is still a classic Boris Karloff movie.

 Moments ago I tried to write a review for THE KNIVES OF THE AVENGER only to receive a message that I had already reviewed it.  Apparently the physical dvd's are a set of Mario Bava movies and reviews of the individual movies are lumped together.  I do not have the dvd's.  I streamed the movies via Amazon Prime but my reviews are still treated as if  they are for one movie.  I know that Bava is considered a great director but even the great have off days.  The movie is actually fairly dull.  Cameron Mitchell rides around throwing knives in an extremely unrealistic manner and mooning over a woman he had wronged.  All the while seeking revenge against a villain who wronged him.  One of the irritating things about this movie is that there is no sense of space and distance.  Karin is hiding from the villain seemingly right next door to him.  All of the action may as well have happened in someone's backyard.",1451865600,,1223,4.640186915887851
3658858,4,B001JP63U6,"Three short pieces.

The first The Telephone (**1/2 of 5) is a thriller with no supernatural elements.  Its also a bit dull and predictable.  It takes its own twists far too seriously.

But the other two stories The Wurdulak (starring Boris Karloff seeming like he's having a great old time, his tongue firmly in cheek.  Karloff also does terrific bookend pieces to the film) and A Drop of Water (both **** of 5) have a real sense of fun and playfulness along with Bava's usual stylishness, and over the top lighting (which can, admittedly, get annoying at moments  in Drop of Water light from every window keeps rising and falling.  It may be that its supposed to suggest lightening, but its mostly just distracting).  When Bava has fun with the hoary clichs of vampires and revenge of the dead, its a lot easier for us to have fun too (and, ironically, I also found it more tense).",1449100800,,883,4.579617834394904

I first saw in early 1960s when it first came out, I was 10 and it was my first horror movie and the theatre was the grand ole STATE walk in theater in LONG Beach, calif., with its gold and red carpets and drapes, and Boris Karloff on the big screen, doesn't get any better than that.

3658900,1,B001JP63U6,"First of all, don't be seduced by the well tanned hunk of muscular man-god on the cover.  It's a total fraud-fantasy and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie.  There's no skin,  and not even a hint of anything sexy.

There's also very little real violence.  There are dozens of swords and knives, but not even a single drop of blood !!!  The fight scenes and stunts are pitifully amateur.  You can see the men pull their punches,  and watch them spring, tuck and roll,  like a gymnast or an acrobat,  when they ""fall"" off a cliff or down some stairs.

The ""plot"" is another version of Homer's ""Odyssey"".  Not that that's a bad thing.....it's just been done (and overdone) a lot !
The soundtrack is pretty good,  but it often overpowers the acting.  I'm sure it wasn't planed, but there are two or three scenes where it actually looks as if the actors pause for a moment while waiting for the musical climax to finish.

There is some clever knife throwing (although I doubt that most of it was real).  So if you are really into knifes,  or if you are a big Cameron Mitchell fan (and don't mind bleached orange hair),  you might want to watch this movie (one day when you have nothing else to do).  Otherwise I recommend you not waste your time.",1412035200,,1250,4.4035087719298245

Each cautionary tale  features the beautiful, buxom damsels in distress from supernatural forces meeting not so happy endings.

3658910,4,B001JP63U6,"""Black Sabbath"" is an anthology of films directed by Mario Bava. There are three films in all and contain an introduction by horror actor Boris Karloff, who also concludes the anthology. I confess that I am only partial to one of the films in this anthology, ""The Wurdulak"" which features Karloff as Gorca, a man who returns to his family after claiming to have slain a wurdulak, a creature of the undead/vampire who legend has it, preys upon the ones it loves the most. Gorca's family members live in fear when he returns because they are not sure whether he has fallen prey to the vampire and is a member of the undead himself. They take precautions but the wurdulak is relentless in its thirst for blood. ""The Wurdulak"" is my favorite of the three tales here because of Karloff's chilling and menacing portrayal of the vampire, as well as the creepy atmosphere and a supporting cast that delivers credible performances.

The first story is ""The Telephone"" which features the beautiful Michele Mercier who plays Suzy, a voluptuous beauty being stalked in her own home by menacing phone calls threatening to kill her. There are shades of lesbianism here. It is not really a supernatural tale, but more of psychological horror and suspense. The lead actress here is beautiful but there's not much more to recommend this tale.

The last story is not that bad. ""The Drop of Water"" features Jacqueline Pierreux as Helen Corey, a lower class woman who steals a ring from the body of a dead old woman, and ends up being plagued by the owner's spirit. It is more atmospheric than ""The Telephone"" but falls short of being truly scary. ""Black Sabbath"" is worth watching, especially for fans of classic horror and suspense, and most notably for ""The Wurdulak"".",1399939200,,1751,4.775577557755776

This is absolutely one of my favorite old (60s/70s) horror anthology films.  Mario Bava...he just did a fabulous job here!  Very atmospheric, beautifully-shot color, gorgeous costumes, creepy atmospher,e creative storyline.

In the middle story, ""The Telephone,"" the ending had me so confused that I went to Wikipedia to try to figure out exactly what happened.  Here I learned that what I saw was an edited total switch-around for pre-Civil Rights, homophobic, xenophobic American audiences.  The fact that the two characters were in a lesbian relationship was clear to me without any references being made and without any physical contact between the two.  It's just obvious.  But yet, to appease American audiences they had to cut out a letter that actually had one woman confessing her feelings for another and replace it with another letter, TOTALLY different, that completely hijacked the entire plot, taking it into another (less interesting, confusing) direction.  God, this nation had some dark, DARK days.  I thank God that this sort of censorship and demonization of people is slowly waning away, on its way out.

Surprisingly the original version did not include Boris Karloffs's narration that was added to the American version of the film. The stories are also presented in a different order. 'The Wurdalak', the second story in the original, was last in the American version presumably to surprise American audiences because Karloff actually stars in this story in both versions of the film.

The discs of Black Sunday, Black Sabbath, and The Girl Who Knew Too Much include some extras that US audiences have never seen. There are audio commentaries, interviews, trailers, and biographies. Beware the stand-alone Blu-Ray releases of many of these films don't include the extras featured in this collection. My only complaints are that the hyped AIP prints of Black Sunday and Black Sabbath (which have never been seen on DVD or Blu-Ray) are not included. None of these films have a 2-hour retrospective documentary. Since all of these films are fairly obscure you are getting good value in this set. This is a better box set than Dario Argento received in North America so fans will appreciate these horror classics.

Buy this collection. It's probably worth about $40. There are now Blu-rays available for some of the films. For more Bava, check out Volume II. Mario Bava deserves a deluxe Blu-Ray release with 4 hours of new extras including a feature-length documentary. This DVD has managed to hold its value well.",1377302400,,1551,5.489539748953975
3658933,5,B001JP63U6,"I was introduced to this movie via Net-Flix and learned it was part of a trilogy through Amazon! Amazon offered me the opportunity to get these great B-rate movies at a reasonable price. You may wonder how can this knuckle head give a B-rate movie's a 5 star rating. Well its like this I rate a movie for what it was intended to be, these are low budget fun action film's never intended to compete for an Oscar! ""Erik the Conqueror"" is the first followed by ""Last of the Viking's"" and finishing with "" Knives of the Avenger"". This may be the most graphic in the bunch. The restoration is great, the story is fun and fast paced, the acting is adequate & the cinematography is exceptional with some truly beautiful shot's. The musical score foreshadows the T.V. western Cameron Mitchell would go on to gain popularity in called ""The High Chaparral"" from 1967-71. A little strange hearing western style soundtrack in a Viking film, but it doesn't take anything away from this film. If Mario Bava & Giacomo Gentilomo were given a huge Hollywood budget these films would have rivaled the Technicolor all star epics of the 50's for their gritty edge. But sadly they do reflect there limited budget. But as I said before I rate them for what they were meant to be and this movie succeeds in its objective Fun violent Viking action!!! If you've been searching for the movie ""Viking Massacre"" search no further as this is the same film with a different title. I missed out on these as a kid & I have been having a ball discovering these old gems. If your a fan of everything sword related like me get them while they last as I have a feeling these cult classics will become very hard to find & and probably increase in value as they get scooped up & happily added to other fans collection. A great way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon & bulk up your Viking collection as the genre isn't exactly overflowing.",1373328000,,1901,4.497109826589595

3658935,5,B001JP63U6,"This is a mixed bag in more ways than one.
A mixed bag of masterful cinema.
If you like gothic horror, murder mysteries and action
and you have a love of old-time movies,
then you will not be disappointed with this collection.
If you are not yet familiar with great Italian film-maker
Mario Bava's work, then you are in for a revelation.
It is a sampler of different types of themes.
This is only one of two Bava box sets released by Anchor Bay
and very well done; the movies look great.
One of my favorite Bava films, ""Planet Of The Vampires"",
a great Lovecraftian sci-fi flick and more,
is not included in either box set,
but do not despair, it is available via Midnite Movies.
Bava is a genius at creating interesting sets and atmosphere
and a grand artist with a primary color palette and a camera.
Much like his fellow Italian master of the macabre and mayhem,
Dario Argento, he approaches film as art
and I marvel at the images that are created...serious eye candy.
This kind of cinema will not appeal to all,
but I recommend it without reservation.
Any one that is a fan of cinema must watch Bava's films
because they are true masterpieces
and countless other directors since have been sitting on his knee.",1360195200,,1213,4.5181818181818185
3658936,1,B001JP63U6,"While I understand and respect all the purists out there who don't mind wading through subtitles to watch a film, I don't happen to share their views.  Personally, I prefer to be able to relax and enjoy a movie without having to constantly split my focus between what's going on in the film and deciphering what's being said by having to read the scroll at the bottom at the same time.  And since I don't speak Italian, that would be the only option for me in following the movie.  Unless, of course, the folks who put this collection together had been considerate enough to include English versions.

Yes, I know some say dubbing is ""sloppy"".  Frankly, I don't care.  I watch horror movies (and other movies) for entertainment.  I want to relax and enjoy them, without having to work at it.

That is my critique.  When they release the English versions, then I'll get around to reviewing the actual plot and direction.",1328659200,,919,4.6234567901234565
3658937,5,B001JP63U6,"Mario Bava once told John Phillip Law in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danger-Diabolik/dp/B000228EJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danger: Diabolik</a>&nbsp;""I'm not that good of a director, but I am really good with a camera.""  I disagree.  His use of color and atmosphere still inspire many today.  I think he was both a good director and an even better cameraman.  Every film in this collection is a winner all showing how to make a low budget film correctly.  As for the films:

Black Sunday - Bava's 1st film as a director is a gothic horror tale about an executed witch(Barbara Steele who's awsome here) getting revenge on the village that destroyed her.  Even in black and white his cinematography could shine.  The outside and graveyard scenes alone are worth the price of purchase.****  Some people claim that this is his best, but I think its:

Black Sabbath - the best horror anthology film.  Three stories of horror hosted by Boris Karlof.  Bava's use of color here is awsome as is his tight direction. As for the stories:
""The Telephone""-A woman returning home late at night is terrorized by a man over the telephone.  Very simple and basic giallo-ish story, but the way its done is anything but.  Probably the worst story of the three.***
""The Wurdalak""-A grandfather(Karloff again) kills an evil villan who terrorized his family but finds out that the murder comes with a price.  Bava's twist on the vampired film with a gothic formula is awsomely done with some really chilling moments(""Mama, I'm cold."").***1/2
""A Drop Of Water""- I always thought Bava did his best with ghost stories and here is one of the best ones and the best section of the film. A nurse learns that crime does not pay when she is called to a house and steals a ring from a dead psychic.  Absolutely terrifying, he really pulls out all the stops here.****

The Girl Who Knew Too Much-And then the giallo was invented.  After witnessing a murder a tourist can't convince the police that a crime actually occured(or did it?).  Bava's in full Hitchcock swing here and still great in black & white.  Acutally has a very engaging (if imperfect story)One of his more sucessful giallos is also maybe the 1st.***1/2

Kill Baby Kill- Basically, a mix between ""A Drop of Water"" and Black Sunday.  After arriving at a small village to investigate some suicides that have been occuring a coroner discovers that they might not be suicides, and why is everyone in the village not cooperating.  Bava did his best with ghost stories and here is no exception.  Man is that little girl creepy.****

Knives of the Avenger- My favorite of Bava's Heculies clones.  A barbaric stranger protects a helpless woman and her son from thugs.  But then things start to get complicated.  Like I said this is my favorite of Bava's sword and sandal films.  It may not be the best but its at least entertaining and gets to the point quick.***",1273104000,,2939,4.928716904276985

8313202,1,B001JP63U6,"Composer Marcello Giombini works very hard to set the mood of the movie as the credits roll over crashing waves. Very hard. In fact, after the credits stop, the camera just keeps showing the waves with no other action, just music. Waves and music. Waves and music. FINALLY, we cut to some mystical scene (or was it a beach cookout?) and a woman talking. Oh wait! It's two women talking! And talking. Then we cut to some bad guys who do still more talking leading to a cheer by the baddies that sounds as energetic as the pathetic cheer in a Rocky and Bullwinkle skit.

At last, 15 minutes or so in, we come to Cameron Mitchell (Cameron Mitchell? Yup!) who, after being turned down by a blonde for food and being told where to find berries and fish, is seen eating a raw fish, which somehow turns into a dead bird he's carrying (guy must have been hungry).

There are loud voices (aka dialog) from the blonde's house and Cameron Mitchell is close enough somehow to hear this and slooooowly makes his way to the house where some bad guys are exchanging running lines with the blonde (turns out she's some kind of queen). The dialog is so poor that Mitchell decided to intervene. He bursts in, throws a knife through one guys throat and begins to fight with the other bad guy. And it's a pretty good fight, too! But, in fairness, Cameron Mitchell is replaced through 98% of this fight by a stunt ""double"" with much darker hair and more muscles.

That was it for me. Meh. Couldn't endure any more stilted chat.",1466812800,,1506,4.449275362318841

This is the US dubbed version with introductions to each story by Boris Karloff. Fans of the movie can read other reviews of the film for a synopsis. Grain is present throughout, but color definitions & depth are very good. At times, the HD does show the limitations of facades & props in the background. Not too bad of a transfer for a 52 year old low budget horror film. The film's visuals are stunningly creepy in this HD transfer.",1464998400,,544,4.505050505050505
