8327244,5,B001NJY63Y,"Lair of the Minotaur ain't playing around, folks. And Southern Lord's not, either. This DVD is what we need more of in the metal market. There's nothing cheap here. It's all well made. And what was this other reviewer looking for? Not what you'd expect?! It's exactly what I'd expect! And that's why Lair of the Minotaur is one of the most unsung metal bands out there. While so many other bands are over-exposed with much weaker material, these guys are grinding out metal that's dying to be heard. And this proves they can put on one hell of a show, folks. Some needs to listen up and get these guys on a major, major tour. Of course, they might be scared they'd have a hard time following them. Nice metal, scenes with very nice flesh, what more could you ask for? Big metal horns to the sky on this one!",1280102400,,807,4.3509933774834435
