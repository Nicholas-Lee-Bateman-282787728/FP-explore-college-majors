8597977,5,B00DUO1DC2,"I've had cats all my life but recently read an article about how lonesome they get when their owner leaves, especially in a single-cat household.  I saw a link for this video and immediately went searching for it on Amazon.  You can purchase individual discs or the four-disc super set, which is what I bought.  There are lots of similar videos in production, and I even purchased a couple of them, but this one, by far, is my feline ""Harry's"" absolute favorite, hands down!

I have a 55"" TV but it will work just fine on any computer or smaller set.  I guess which one you use just depends on how many ""paw-prints"" you want to clean off of your device, because your cat will go wild for ""Mewvie""!  In the four-disc set, there's the ""Birdland Bonanza"", ""Backyard Buffet"", ""Bug Brigade"", & ""Hummingbird Happiness"".  Each one has one thing in common and that's the bird sounds playing in the background.  Whether it's bugs, squirrels, mice, or actual birds, the sounds still play.  I've come to the conclusion that it's both motion & sound that attracts my feline friend.

I tried all four discs and can say that my kitty loves ""Birdland Bonanza"" best.  I think it's because the specific birds in it, move more than in some of the other discs.  He particularly likes the segment with the sparrows & chickadees; in fact he even has it memorized.  All I have to do is say, ""birdies"", in a high-pitched voice, and ""Harry"" will come running from whatever room he's in, hop up on the bench in front of the TV, and eagerly await the first sounds.  He taps the screen, sometimes lies in wait for the birds to appear in and out of the screen, pounces from the floor, and even ""chatters"".

Most of the time, I play it when I'm going to be out of the house for a longer period of time, as I want him to have mental stimulation while I'm away, and I don't want him to be lonely.  I also use it if I'm busy in the house and don't have enough time to pay adequate attention to him.  It's so much fun watching him stalk and ""chatter"".  When ""Harry"" gets tired playing, he will take a rest, then come back to the TV after a nap.  I think he likes hearing the sound of the birds even when he's not actively engaged and, frankly, I do as well.  One of the best features is that each disc is on a 90-minute loop, so the video doesn't stop unless you want it to.

The quality of the picture is excellent, as well as the variety of critters & their activities.  If you're looking for a stimulating, entertaining, fun video for the feline(s) in your life, don't hesitate to purchase ""Mewvie"".",1438387200,,2569,4.364210526315789

8597979,5,B00DUO1DC2,"I have the Cat Sitter Volume 1 DVD, which has been played to death in my home for a good two months - before I saw this four volume set and reviews.  So far, both the cat and I like this DVD set better than Cat Sitter.  ""We"" play them early in the morning and late afternoon/early evening, often when the sun is coming up or setting.  It is a relaxing way to start the day or begin to wind down.  I enjoy the nature sounds wherever I am in the house.  The cat seems a little more entertained by this DVD set than Cat Sitter.  He likes to lay at attention in front of the TV or curled up on the sofa and watch and listen to it whether I am near him or not.

My cat is a 4-year old feral, that was the last of a small bunch.  He was the most feral and I think he got lonely and became attached to me since I'd been feeding him since he was a kitten.  So I started leaving my door propped open this last fall and he started coming in and within a month he was a full-time indoor cat and becoming a pet, starting to let me touch him and laying near me or on my feet.

I bought a used copy of the Cat Sitter DVD to see if it would interest Fluffy, calm him or instigate play and activity.  We experience some of each depending on his mood.  Initially, he did try pawing the TV screen and would walk around the TV and its cabinet trying to find the birds and insects, but he never destructively attacked the TV or appeared frustrated.  Whenever I play his DVDs with nature sounds, he comes to the TV room right away to check it out.  How long he is entertained and stays in the room seems to have more to do with whether he wants to be around me or whether he is content to curl up and watch.

Personally, I find the Mewvie Anthology more pleasant than the Cat Sitter DVD (Vol. 1) because it doesn't contain ""infomercial clips""...just pleasant  nature sounds and quality video shots of birds at feeders, insects and butterflies buzzing, etc.  Also, the first volume of Cat Sitter has squawking parrots.  I don't find that relaxing and it was a nature sound not familiar to the cat either...although they were entertaining to watch due to their color once he got used to the squawk.

Mewvie Anthology discs are nice because you can choose your subject.  Each disc menu contains a list of the subject, so you can start or just play a particular section.  This is nice since every cat is different and attracted to different things.  In general, Fluffy seems to enjoy the butterfly and insects just as much as the birds.  Occasionally he is ""tricked"" by the appearance of squirrels on the screen, but I think the insects/butterflies and birds are more real to him.

I also like the Mewvie Anthology discs are better than Cat Sitter because there are not minutes of intro with hokey music, cats watching TV while a human voice says why the video is entertaining to cats.

Each Mewvie disc does have a very brief proprietary motion clip of a cat with LOUD music for just seconds at it starts before the menu appears.  For this reason, I strongly suggest that you turn your TV volume to low and then adjust it to a higher level if desired after you start the play mode.

With so many pet sitter DVDs on the market, even though I've only viewed one other, I think this may suffice for us for a long time.  It is definitely a far better value to buy Mewvie: The Anthology that to buy individual DVDs of similar content.

Finally, if you haven't tried any pet sitter CDs (music) or DVDs for your pets.  I encourage you to borrow one from your library or a friend and play it several times with your pet when you are home.  While I am new to having a cat as an indoor pet, my observation as to whether the cat will enjoy either depends quite a bit on its state of health and mood and sometimes it takes a cat a period of time to become accustomed to something and/or begin to play with it and enjoy it.  When Fluffy came inside, he was cautious and afraid of every sound and everything new to him.  The nature DVDs actually seemed to help him relax a bit and make my home more his own on a daily basis.",1423612800,2,4086,4.190781049935979
