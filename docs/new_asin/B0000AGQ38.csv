7996984,5,B0000AGQ38,"It's a wonderful cd.  And one that I wish  was played in every classroom in this country
at least once a year.

I'm neither a neoconservative or a screaming liberal.  I'm merely a person who appreciates
having been born in this country.

Hopefully some billionaire will see this and say, 'hey, not a bad idea.  Let's get ahold of Warren
and Bill etc., put some money together and do it!.  Provide schools around the country with
this cd, that is.'

By the way, I have absolutely nothing to do with the people who put this cd together or who are
selling this product.  I'm merely someone who, although it may not be politically correct, still waves
the flag.
