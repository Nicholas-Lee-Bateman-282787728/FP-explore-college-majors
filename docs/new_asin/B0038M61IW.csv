8391440,5,B0038M61IW,"Rimsky-Korsakov is still a rare guest on western opera stages and his operas are largely unknown to the broad public. Many opera lovers will be amazed at some point of how good his music is. This DVD presents one of his best operas, Sadko which is rarely performed even in Russia due to its staging and casting demands. This is a historic recording of 1980, and it needs to be judged as such, as the modern recording technology did not exist at the time, and it is impossible to compare picture and sound quality with what we get today on blue rays. I am actually amazed how good the picture and the sound quality are. The video directing is also very good and provides a very adequate impression of this 1949 (!) production of the Sadko. Stalin still had 4 years to live when this Sadko premiered at the Bolshoi. It is a rare glimpse at the style and scale of the productions of the era. However, the significance of this recording is most and foremost in the extraordinary performance by Atlantov as the title character which remains unsurpassed to this day. And this alone makes this Sadko the best available to us. His wife and the soprano primadonna of the Bolshoi sings the part of the sea princess. The quality of the Atlantovs performance and his ability to create a powerful character are especially amazing considering that he performed Sadko once-twice a year at best, and not even every year. Other biggest Bolshoi stars participating in this performance included star mezzo Arkhipova, famed bass Ognivtsev (Variag merchant), and baritone Voroshilo (Venetian merchant) who showed a great promise but very early lost his voice.
The libretto could be more logical, the performance itself gets a bit messy at times with a huge crowd of people on stage almost out of control in addition to not the best ballet performances but it does not make this Stalin era spectacle less interesting to me.",1500768000,,1901,4.728915662650603
8391441,5,B0038M61IW,"I liked it a lot despite the less than adequate picture quality. It's old and it looks it, but still thoroughly enjoyable. I loved the under water wedding. if you limit yourself to ultra deluxe crystal clear wide screen mega sound productions your only cheating yourself out of culture that will not be reproduced in our super slick digital age.",1462147200,,345,4.766666666666667
8391442,3,B0038M61IW,"I trust I have summarized my impressions in the title of this review. Now a few words of explanation. One reviewer said the picture quality was ""acceptable.""  It may be--on a small screen. I played this Sadko on a 42 inch screen, and, trust me, it looks terrible. So if you have a 42 inch TV or larger, and you think this picture quality is acceptable, you either 1) work for or own stock in VAI,or 2) are extremely easy to please. If you have a 30 inch TV, as I once  did, this picture quality may be acceptable. I owned several VAI releases years ago, and they looked okay on a small TV. I currently have another VAI release of Russian material (Hvorostovsky singing songs of the war years) which was on Russian TV a few years ago (this performance of Sadko was on Russian TV circa 1980). That Hvorostovsky concert, in its VAI incarnation, is arguably acceptable in respect to picture quality, but is definitely nothing to write home about, as it does not even reflect the quality of modern TV in Russia. I have lived in Russia (2008-09), and have watched Russian TV. One of two conclusions is inevitable: 1) either the Russians provided shoddy material to VAI or 2) VAI botched the job of transferring this material to disc. The Kultur discs I own, while rarely all that could be desired, when Russian materials are in question, invariably seem to be superior to VAI's productions. BTW, I do not work for or own stock in Kultur.

  With respect to this Bolshoi performance of ""Sadko,"" there are several other Russian operas of the same vintage (1979-1981) which were available for purchase in Russia when I was there: ""Boris Godunov,"" ""Khovanshchina,"" ""Prince Igor,"" and ""Ivan Susanin."" In all of them, the picture quality, while far from HD, is clearly superior to VAI's ""Sadko."" The same performance of ""Prince Igor"" has been published by VAI in the USA. Several times I have been tempted to buy it, if for no other reason than to compare its picture quality with the copy I bought in Russia. Another consideration is that VAI provides Russian subtitles among the subtitle options, which Kultur, to its lasting shame, does not for its Russian operas. Alas, I have not bought the ""Igor"" because I fear its ""PQ"" will be akin to that of this ""Sadko,"" which, quite frankly is abominable. That being the case, the prices being charged for this VAI ""Sadko"" are exorbitant. The greedy, alas, are ever ready to use disclaimers about the quality of vintage source materials, to excuse their doing nothing to refurbish them. Alternatively, if the disclaimers are indeed true, and the materials cannot be refurbished, that does not excuse the high prices, indeed it cries out against them.

  All of this, of course, is a great shame, given the virtues of this Bolshoi production. It clearly deserves a better presentation than VAI has afforded it. This ""Sadko,"" if it had even minimally acceptable picture quality, would easily be a five-star product. As it is, it can only be recommended to the aforemention easy-to-please people, those who are blind or have small TVs (though I suspect it may look terrible even on a small screen). Three stars is generous enough in my estimation, and I have a number of Russian operas with less than pristine sound and picture quality. This ""Sadko"" is the worst of the lot. CAVEAT EMPTOR!",1379030400,,3319,4.72020725388601
8391443,4,B0038M61IW,"First, I would like to mention the drawbacks of this DVD recording and the production itself. The sound quality is acceptable, except in some scenes (for example, Tableau IV) there are too many people on the stage, and the microphones seem to be jumping and the sound is momentarily being distorted. Another drawback is the cuts. This production (and all the soviet recordings, too), as far as cuts are concerned, are identical. In total, it amounts to maybe 15-20 minutes of music. First, the opening chorus of guests is shortened, then the song of Nezhata, and so on, and lastly, in the final, the gorgeous song of Sadko (where he retells his adventures) sung along with Nezhata, the three foreign guests, and chorus, is absolutely absent, too. Gergiev's version is also with many (but much less) cuts, and these usually are independent. For example, Gergiev skips the gorgeous dance-chorus in the Undersea kingdom ""Ai lioli, lioli lado"", and some other dances; thus the Tableau VI is longer in the production under review. And, finally, another drawback is the same as in Gergiev's version - ""Sadko"" is really an earnest and deep masterpiece with a profound humanistic message, and I personally do not like the circus-like attitude towards the staging of Tableau I, where skomorokhs are dressed and behave like clowns, mocking other people in a circus-like fashion. I really think Tableau I is very earnest part, and the production should be accordingly serious, too.
The rest are all advantages of this production. Vladimir Atlantov, here in his prime, really lifts the banner very high; some secondary roles are very good, too, like Duda and Sopel, or the Venetian guest (he makes one mistake, but the rest of his song is sung really magnificently). The decorations are very good, the see is gorgeous, one really indulges into the fairytale, and this is exactly the kind of production which many people prefer, and not so many places remain where You can see such an honest work, alas.",1323388800,12,1990,4.943283582089553
8391444,5,B0038M61IW,"Here is the second DVD of Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko. Both this and the later Kirov are simply gorgeous and if you love the opera like I do you should have both. Both are quite different and dripping with gorgeous melody. There's more here than the Song of India.

It's hard to choose between the two but but this version - slightly - gets the nod.",1292457600,4,345,4.390625
8391445,5,B0038M61IW,"I have both this and the Kirov version with Gergiev.  The production and most of the singing are clearly superior here and only the picture quality is clearly superior with the Kirov.  Given that the picture and sound on this DVD are quite acceptable this is the version to have if you only want one, and worth the purchase if you have the Kirov already. It's that enchanting.",1278288000,13,376,4.514705882352941
