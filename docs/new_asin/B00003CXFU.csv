1265093,5,B00003CXFU,"Erin Brockovich is a great movie.  I just saw it and are still thinking about it.  She is a great person trying to help others, and greatly succeeds and helps everyone get what they deserve from the company.",953942400,,207,4.421052631578948
1265094,5,B00003CXFU,"Julia's performance as Eric Brockovich was unbelievable.  It would not be a surprise to see her name in next years list of Oscar nominees.  Although the film is a bit long, this true story is well directed and well written.  Erin Brockovich definitely worth seeing.",953856000,,265,4.844444444444444
1265095,5,B00003CXFU,"I am probably one of Julia Roberts biggest fans and I own almost all of her films. Steel Magnolias and Pretty Woman are my favorite movies of all time, and now that I have seen Erin Brockovich, I would have to say that  this one is the best.  I love her humor, her wit, her talent as an actress,  her charm that she has over people, everything about her in this movie is  excellent.  I have always envied Julia Robert's for her abililty to do  anything, and after this movie, she has proved that she can play any part.  I will definitely own this movie when it comes out.",953683200,2,571,4.18348623853211
1265096,5,B00003CXFU,"The story of this film is similar to ""A Civil Action"" - but with a far better ending!
Julia Robert's is great in this film. Compared to her other films where she plays a naieve girly-girl, Erin is a great role  for her. She has a lot of really funny quips throughout the movie and he  character has a lot of moxie!
Erin's story is that she's on the brink of  poverty before she gets hired at a law firm to file away tons of papers.  From that point on, she dazzels everyone and turns a lot of heads when she  stands up for what she knows is right.
I saw this film with 3 of my  friends and we all have very differnt tastes in films. We all loved it.  Another friend of mine and his 8 friends all saw the film and they all  loved it. This film should be required of everyone to see.
GO SEE IT!",953683200,3,792,3.90625
1265097,3,B00003CXFU,"Erin Brockovich offers up the ""David/Goliath"" lawsuit setting with Roberts as the heroine. Julia plays a strong character who is need of a job to support her three children.
Bold, brash and funny at times. I  thought Albert Finney did a stand-up job as the lawyer who gives Erin more  chances than he has reasons for.
There is not much drama in the courts  but rather when Erin has to visit the small town to do research.
There is  some witty banter between Robert's character and the people she works for  and with.
While Erin's job seems to be taking off, her new relationship  seems to be falling apart. Can she balance the two? Watch the movie and  find out.
I don't think this film will be around next year for Oscar talk  but it is an enjoyable one. A typical Julia Roberts film with a real-life  story...and there's nothing wrong with that.
You'll leave with a smile  on your face and feeling content knowing there are people out here fighting  the injustices happening to the little people.",953596800,38,998,4.550561797752809
1265098,5,B00003CXFU,reviewers should get a clue and get outside - this is a great story and had everything you need to make it play straight to your heart.  some of the language is a little rough for the older crowd but the younger set will  understand it is part of live in the 21st century  julie roberts and  albert finney are great  don't miss this movie  would give it 20 stars if  possible,953596800,,375,4.125

It offers a fast and engaging, Hollywood entry point into considering the value of water and how big money, corporations, are willing to scam the ordinary working people to increase their profit margins.

1265562,5,B00003CXFU,This is an amazing movie and I never get tired of watching it.  Julia Roberts is fantastic and she really was the reason why this movie turned out so well.  The passion she showed for the work she was doing brought back memories of certain jobs that I had where I had a very similar passion.  I highly recommend this movie.,1487721600,,323,4.262295081967213
1265563,4,B00003CXFU,"Good movie, overall. The somewhat true story of a scrappy young woman, and her discovery that citizens in a nearby town were being slowly poisoned by the water, which was contaminated by the waste products of an uncaring corporation. A classic ""David and Goliath"" theme. It is something of a chick flick, but we have a motorcycle gang type boyfriend to spice things up. Julia Roberts suits the role quite well and looks great in a tiny top and a mini skirt. A little slow moving even for me. It isn't great cinema, but certainly worth watching.

The title of the review is a tribute to one of my favorite scenes in all the movies, where the prim, ugly female lawyer tells Julia Roberts that she has ""holes"" in her research. For example, missing contact information. Julia is then able to provide the phone number of a file chosen at random. So perfect.",1487548800,,852,4.568627450980392

1265677,5,B00003CXFU,"I don't see very many movies these days, mostly because I feel there are so many mediocre ones to get through before you come across something truly great, that it doesn't seem like a very good utilization of my time.

Having said that - this movie was exceptional. I loved it. An inspiring, uplifting plot, and a power-packed performance by Julia Roberts makes this an absolute must-watch.

The movie is based on a real life David versus Goliath kind of story (and I love those!!).

It centers around Erin Brockovich (well, of-course ) -  a down-on-her-luck single mother of three, who after being a SAHM for several years, is struggling to find a job to support her family. During this already-bad phase of life, she gets into an auto accident, that leads her to a law firm, which takes her on as a pro-bono client at first, and eventually (very grudgingly) as an employee.

It was  during this stint as a clerical assistant at a law firm, that she stumbled into a case with staggering implications, and quite by accident, uncovered a huge corporate scandal. It was very interesting to watch her navigate through this, and start an overwhelming, yet determined journey towards justice.

All in all, it's a powerful and well directed human interest drama, and I highly recommend it.

1266363,5,B00003CXFU,"I have no way of knowing whether the real Erin Brokovich matched the beauty queen appearance of Julia Roberts who was chosen to play her in this superlative film.  Nor do I know whether any of the other named characters other than the defendant PG&E match real persons living or dead.  But I am familiar with the geography and the general nature that such a case was in fact brought while ongoing problems, including a ""gold miner"" using mercury to extract gold from his ore continue to be problematical for the human population of that desert area and the ""religion"" gang in an extremely nearby town whose ""city hall"" has been subverted into a place of worship of that felony tax evading ""religion"" draining the aquifer to create an open air evaporation ""lake"" to waste that precious resource to supply a coastal humidity environment while human interests in adequate water supplies are shunted aside in the name of ""drought conditions"".

It shows where a single person is able to get the entire process moving forward to address and alleviate the rule of corporations. The language is a bit harsh at times but the message is still the same. Julia Roberts gives a fine performance and the writing is good as well. It is quite pointed in that it still takes money and legal power to make sure that the  laws of this nation still rule though. I do not know if these types of actions are still possible giving the relationships between politics and money in today's world. I had not seen this movie in many years and was glad I watched it again. It may be from a different time period, but it really rings true for today.

1266769,5,B00003CXFU,"If I didn't know it was based on a ""true"" story I might have dismissed this movie as ""unrealistic"", particularly in the first half hour or so when it started off like another Julia Roberts comedy.
At the beginning the film appears to focus primarily on her wardrobe, her foul language, and the developing romance with the ""boy next door"", whom she initially dislikes. As it turns out, the actual story, according to the bonus features on the DVD was even more melodramatic than the film's. The real Erin actually got sick to the point of hospitalization from the chromium in Hinkley. The director wisely decided to cut out this part of the story, to avoid making her too much of a martyr. Another aspect while not totally ignored (she does mention at least once that she's a ""slow reader"") but underplayed is Erin's dyslexia. This makes her accomplishments all the more amazing! Personally, I think this fact could have been emphasized more, as no doubt it was a big factor behind her ""attitude"" problems - her combativeness toward people with more education than herself, her struggles in finding a job, perhaps even in her efforts to accentuate her physical attractiveness through her outrageous clothing. All in all I found it an enjoyable and enlightening story - the triumph of a unique individual whose determination, empathy, and sense of moral duty ultimately outweigh her abrasiveness and lack of social graces. And largely why she triumphs is her partnership with an intelligent and decent lawyer in Ed Masry. What a refreshing departure from the usual Hollywood stereotype! On many occasions, he effectively counters Erin's prejudices with rational explanations how and why the legal system works the way it does, and why lawyers behave the way they do. With her passion and his reason, they make a great team. Now if only the movie hadn't fallen into the old Hollywood trap of giving its leading lady more outfits than is realistic for someone of her economic status. The point that Erin dressed provocatively and this caused problems with her co-workers could have easily been made with just 3 or 4 costumes. Other than that, it was a good movie - great performances and a wonderful story.",1474243200,3,2202,4.890374331550802

1267809,4,B00003CXFU,"really riveting drama based upon a true story...Julia is typically brilliant in another dynamic performance.

she plays a dirt poor divorcee with three kids she cannot feed...she bullies her way into a law firm, after blowing a job interview with Head lawyer Albert. her raw intelligence and assertiveness earns her an associate (if U will) position..but it takes that to the max, bringing home a case file re toxic waste from a huge power company. she plays detective and delivers some very tasty evidence, to initiate a real case, involving more and more Kansas residents.

she decides to go off on a mission to further develop the ""case"" ...and gets dropped. will the case actually go forward?

fantastic work by Albert as the career Lawyer who just wants to stay afloat after a very grueling career...less fantastic acting by Aaron, stuck in a bizarrely incongruous role as out of work Construction worker / Harley guy neighbor who ends up in a kind of ""role reversal"" (for the time) babysitting the kids. unnecessary, embarrassing soap opera tripe  to mess up the continuity, in my opinion.

wonderful mid-west cinematogoraphy and soundtrack (incl. Sheryl Crow, also from the Midwest). much kudos to the screenwriter (despite the rough cut boy toy distraction).",1440720000,,1266,5.0673076923076925

People tell me that Erin is still working to tell the truth about industrial practices which poison our environment. I often wonder what it is that brings us to a moment of confidence, that moment in which we take charge of our lives, and commit to something outside of ourselves. How do we navigate any negative feedback from the people in our inner circle as we slice through complacency, our own and others? I think you will see...it is the story that I enjoyed in this film. I usually watch any film project that Julia Roberts chooses, and it is pretty fun to go back in time and see how an artist matures and emerges via the stories they inhabit on the screen.

1268064,4,B00003CXFU,"Do you believe in destiny? Me neither, until I watched the story of Erin Brockovich unfold before my eyes. Thirty-something year old Brockovich, portrayed by the always endearing Julia Roberts, is a struggling, twice-divorced mother of three youngns. Shes witty, resilient, and a flashy, self-proclaimed fashionista. An itinerary of unlucky events led Brockovich into a courtroom, where her feisty and honest behavior caused her to lose a lawsuit against the doctor that smashed his Jaguar into her car. Clearly upset with her lawyer, Ed Masry (portrayed by Albert Finney), Erin shows up at his firm and doesnt leave until he offers her a clerical job. Dont make me beg, she whispers to Ed.
 This is where destiny steps in. She stumbles upon a real-estate case in which PG&E wants to purchase Donna Jensens home in Hinkley, California. Curious as to why the files include medical records, Erin asks for Eds permission to explore the documents on her own time. Visiting multiple residents in Hinkley during and outside of work, Erin discovers that PG&E had been lying about the Hexavalent Chromium contamination of the towns groundwater, and many residents were mysteriously suffering from respiratory issues and cancer. Through a string of random events that all fell into place, Erin found herself in the position of a lifetime. A faded beauty queen with sixteen dollars to her name somehow found the esteem she needed to hold up a fight against a major, powerful company. Whats even more riveting is that although she needed the money, I cant help but get the feeling that Erin wouldve brought justice to Hinkley for free.
 The writing of Susannah Grant is welded into a perfect marriage with the direction of Steven Soderbergh in this smart and sassy legal drama. The film harnessed Julia Roberts charisma and wit in a refreshing manner, without overdoing her proud personality. Erin Brockovich is a real-life person, of course, and its important to stay true to her! The film exudes an almost sweaty and dusty atmosphere in Hinkley. The movie posters tagline is She brought a small town to its feet and a huge company to its knees. You can imagine that Brockovichs big-talking mouth put up a fight with PG&E, and resulted in the largest direct-action lawsuit in American history. It might already be implied, but this is one of those movies where you find yourself chuckling through your teary eyes. Definitely a feel good.
 Julia Roberts took the character of Erin Brockovich and gave her a dramatic, Hollywood spin with her charming smile and harsh language. Seriously, the language was harsh enough to make this film rated R. Shes a proud, hard worker that makes this film so satisfying to watch.
 I give this film 4.5/5 stars because of how well the story was portrayed through the actors, setting, and writing. The movie makers brought to light a major lawsuit that not many people outside of California would know about, therefore creating an easy-to-watch, educational film. My one gripe, worth -0.5 stars, is that I didn't fully enjoy the George storyline. While he was a likeable character, the love story didn't quite sit right with me. However, I can understand how Georges presence helped emphasize Erins personal sacrifices and willpower. I don't think Georges role was unnecessary, just poorly executed. The other 4.5 stars, however, make up for the lacking love story.",1433203200,,3387,5.010657193605684

I always like movies that re-create situations or historical events that people sometimes aren't aware of otherwise.  I also liked the suing the Phillip Morris cigarette company movie in the early 2000s with Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Also, I'm studying paralegal studies right now; it lends credence to the idea that not all legislation or legal cases are merely vanity binges, they can have merit and social value as well and that the people that work for them are creating change and working for the people they serve.",1424390400,,657,4.79646017699115

A true story ""David and Goliath"" style with an accurate depiction of actual events and characters. If you're a struggling single Mom, this movie should be part of your personal library and viewed whenever you think you're defeated. Erin Brockovich the person and Erin Brockovich the movie sets a timeless shining example of possibilities and what one can accomplish with determination and belief in one's self. You Go Girl!",1416182400,,594,5.197916666666667
1268478,5,B00003CXFU,"Brilliant! How can you not want to stand up and cheer for Erin, Ed and the entire Masry Law Firm?! A tremendous depiction of courage, determination and sheer guts, in this powerful true life portrayal of justice verses corporate power and greed. A Goliath company that for years, maliciously and willfully had been dumping a poisonous chemical into it's water supply and consequently poisoning innocent, unknowing residents of a town was suddenly..., facing a judge in a Court of Law, by a ankle-biting David (Erin), who just wouldn't go away. Oh, how refreshing it is, that a pure, justice-minded heart, one who really cared, would be so brave. And to think, that the least and most unlikely, would be used in a monumental law suit to take down and thoroughly humble a corporate giant, and in so doing, bring justice and financial restitution for the innocent victims. Wow! Hooray for Erin and the legal team that made legal history. And in so doing, exposed a powerful company that deliberately perpetrated such a heinous crime for no justifiable reason - other then, too pad their corporate pockets at the expense of innocent, human lives. Which amounts too nothing short of a vicious crime against humanity, itself. Greed is very destructive. And who takes them down? A former beauty queen with three kids and no job, having been rejected by one employer after another, resorts to doing anything at a Law Firm, to pay the bills and support her children. And while there, she stumbles onto the case and quickly recognizes that it is a horrific, deliberate and willful cover-up that literally affected hundreds of innocent victims that were diagnosed with various forms of cancer, and were dying as a direct result of a profit-minded company that took no notice of those it deemed, expendable. Even of it's own employee's. Meaning: Profiting off of the unwarranted, inhumane, cruel and needless suffering that these precious, unknowing, cancer victims endured was brought to light by the fortitude and integrity of a determined woman who was an outsider and one who didn't even go to Law School. ERIN BROCKOVICH cared, and in so doing, exposed the treachery of a corporate giant that was into profits..., at the expense of people, by way of poisoning. The company knowing allowed contaminated water to flow into the town's domestic water tanks and subsequently into their homes, for the sake of the 'company appearance' and it's own lust for money. It's inconceivable that innocent and otherwise healthy people were needlessly tortured by a dreaded disease like cancer and those within the company that knew..., merely turned their heads for the sake of money. And this is also true, for the corrupt and like-minded, greedy, attorneys which represented the company. Personally, I think that they should have been disbarred. That's why it's so unbelievable and miraculous, that ERIN BROCKOVICH - a divorced mother with three kids, even pulled it off. For without a doubt, it is a true story of tremendous courage and triumph for justice and the colossal consequences..., for the vanquished. And, it just goes to show you, that the truth of a matter... no matter how much you try to cover it up, will always be brought to light. And probably, when you least expect it and by the most unlikely and unqualified person. In this case, it was by a woman, named: ERIN BROCKOVICH. A standing ovation to you ERIN, for persevering in the midst of corruption and adversity and for bringing the 'Light of Truth', to the victims who were suffering and perishing, needlessly. This color, single-disc, DVD that is both disturbing and compelling in story and content, will rivet and shake you to the bone. But in the end, you will cheer with tears of joy for ERIN and the surviving victims, in their glorious triumph over an unscrupulously greedy, corporate, Goliath. An absolute keeper for your home DVD collection. Nina Kish",1415750400,,3911,4.945288753799392

1268620,5,B00003CXFU,"This is one of the Best acting performances of Julia Roberts that I've seen, and I watch all her movies as she is one of my favorite. She plays the Perfect role of Erin Brockovich as she fights for justice as a single mom of 3 young children. Desperate for a job to support her children, she meets up with a lawyer, winds up working for him, then convinces him to work on a special case.

She helps a small town as she battles with a huge company, and never once did she doubt herself in her beliefs to save the town, help the poor people that suffered, while planning to force the company to compensate for all the suffering. She is very strong, and determined, which impressed the lawyer she was working with.

Julia Roberts makes this movie a Triumph in all its glory as it portrays courage, strength, and determination to fight for justice, which wins the battle! Captivating, inspiring, and entertaining from start to finish. Highly recommended!",1410825600,,950,4.58235294117647

1268765,5,B00003CXFU,excellent movie. Based on a true story. The fight for the innocent people who trust BIG business to be honest. A clear picture of corporations deep pockets.

1268772,5,B00003CXFU,"I love this movie and have watched it many times. Erin comes from a struggling background, learns of an infraction against a small town that was deliberately deceived by a major corporation. She persists and ultimately a successful judgment is received for the residents of the town of Hinkley, California. This story for me is proof that even a small person can create a wave to overcome something corporate giants think will never happen to them.

The language within the movie is strong but it fits the story. Pushy and outspoken is how Erin wades through rhetoric and legalese. I love her tenacity. At the end of the movie, though, Erin is speechless and you'll have to watch it to see why.

If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend it and watch all the interviews, deleted scenes, and director comments. Do I even have to add that Julie Roberts was so believable as Erin Brockovich. Love her as an actor. My other favorite Is Albert Finney who has a subtle wit in dealing with Erin's outbursts.",1401235200,,1008,4.657303370786517
1268773,2,B00003CXFU,"Living near Love Canal, this story has great interest to me.  I enjoy most Julia Roberts movies too.

1268774,4,B00003CXFU,I mostly like this movie because of Erin's tough to like personality. It kind of reminds me of me sometimes. And the whole corporate responsibility thing too is something I liked.,1399766400,,179,4.806451612903226
1268805,5,B00003CXFU,"An inspirational story of determination, not giving up, desire to make things right for those in situations worse than Erin's. Julia embraces the role that fits her like a glove and shows a part of her acting not seen in other movies.",1399507200,,234,4.595238095238095
1268806,5,B00003CXFU,"I watched this film as a requirement for a training program as the heroine illustrates the qualities of a successful candidate in our program. Watching this film, I could see why. She was not just a crude, sassy single mom with three kids without an education but a fierce, precise and an intelligent mind driven for survival and humanity. Julia Roberts was just awesome as an individual who fought for her beliefs that simple folks do have rights against a giant mega corporation and she didn't let fear or rejection stop her quest to save people whose lives were in danger. Very captivating, a powerhouse of a movie I haven't seen in a long time.",1398988800,2,648,4.643478260869565
1268807,5,B00003CXFU,"Julia Roberts delivers the performance of her career in this based on a true story portrayal of the life of Erin Brokovich. The story revolves around the contamination and coverup of a local water supply. It takes a woman with nothing to lose to stand up against a huge corporation. She desperately needs a job and browbeats a local lawyer into giving her one. She takes no guff from anyone as she fights for what's right. In addition to Roberts' work, the rest of the cast provides true counterpoint with character portrayals that leap off the screen. This story has plenty for all to enjoy, directed by a master craftsman who knows how to keep things moving yet sensitive. Enjoy this movie more than once! A library keeper.",1398556800,,725,4.671875
1268808,5,B00003CXFU,"This movie is one of my all time favorites! Julia Roberts is amazing and this story is truly awesome...it is funny, happy, sad, suspenseful, sad, and heartwarming. You will not be disappointed, my favorite line of any movie ever is from this movie:

George: How many numbers you got?

Erin Brockovich: Oh, I got numbers comin' outta my ears. For instance: ten.

George: Ten?

Erin Brockovich: Yeah. That's how many months old my baby girl is.

George: You got a little girl?

Erin Brockovich: Yeah. Yeah, sexy, huh? How 'bout this for a number? Six. That's how old my other daughter is, eight is the age of my son, two is how many times I've been married - and divorced; sixteen is the number of dollars I have in my bank account. 850-3943. That's my phone number, and with all the numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.",1397260800,2,864,4.471337579617835

1268863,4,B00003CXFU,"However, if you're looking for a version that is 264 minutes long, then this ain't the one. I don't think there is a long version as such, but the details are posted as 264 minutes for the playback time. This is not true. The movie is 132 minutes long and that's it. There are no extra deleted scenes put back into the movie to make it 264 minutes long. So if you have never seen this movie and you are on the fence about getting it, then I would say it is a good investment of your time to watch this movie. It is a good movie, but the facts need to be clear, this ain't a 264 minute movie. If anything else, it is worth a view, for sure.",1393200000,,639,3.923076923076923

1268895,5,B00003CXFU,"This must be the third time I have watched ""Erin Brockovich"".  It just keeps getting better even when I know what is coming.  Classic lines include ""they're called boobs, Ed"", and the line when she demolishes her up tight opposite from the hired guns who is incredulous and asks how she got every single eligible signed up to come on line with the arbitration procedure, she responds ""Sexual favors."" Finally her reaction when her she thinks her boss, Ed Masry, is cutting her expected bonus and after screaming at him she looks at the check and finds that he has upped it far beyond her expectations is literally jaw-dropping funny! Julia managed to look a lot like the real Erin Brockovitch, who at the present time has made enough money to turn herself into looking a lot like Julia Roberts.

1269015,1,B00003CXFU,"I give this movie 1 starsimply because of the entertainment value. It's troubling to me when filmmakers tout their film with the ""based on a true story"" tag and then don't tell the truth.  Sure, it's a feel-good story about scrappy Erin standing up for the little guy.  But what about the disputes that took place between the firm and its clients?  The matter went to arbitration, and there are many allegations, including not releasing the settlement funds to the victims for six months, an arbitrary distribution of the settlement among the victims, the firm taking more than was proper from the settlement for fees and ""expenses""... if you're going to make a movie based on a true story, why not tell the entire story, warts and all?

No different from witch burning in the past based on random co-incidence, except for the fact that the target is large and is willing to shell out money rather than burn. There was a great back-and-forth on the WSJ on the topic of how wrong this was from beginning to end, creating a heroine out of a sympathetic but ultimately greedy and un-informed activist. (Search for [erin brockovich wsj] or [erin brockovich facts] - salon, the wsj and others have done exposes, but they receive a fraction of the attention of the movie).",1385164800,2,704,4.551181102362205

Because it is based on true life events, the story makes you feels both appalled and elated. It's by far my favorite Julia Roberts movie. Watch it and learn something about how one person can make a big difference and how corporate America operates.",1382140800,,675,4.616666666666666

1269143,5,B00003CXFU,"Julia Roberts at her best.  She plays a character I don't even like, but she plays it well and it's an excellent movie. I suppose you can admire Erin, but not really like her.  She alienates everyone around her.  She complains of the men in her past, but she walks all over two good men ( her boss and her boyfriend ) in the present.  It would be interesting to see what the men in her past thought of her.  This is not to say the character is not interesting; she is.  But it's the one and only time I found Julia Roberts unappealing.  Which is probably just right for the movie.

Albert Finney ( no surprise here ) is excellent.

The movie is exciting with it's share of heartbreak and humor.",1376352000,,694,4.196969696969697

1269200,4,B00003CXFU,"While viewing the riveting ERIN BROCKOVICH one has to ponder. . .if the REAL Erin is so talented and so intelligent, why couldn't she hold a job?  How did she end up with a string of loser men?  Yet, alas, based on the recent boating adventures that placed Ms. Brockovich in some legal peril, perhaps she's not quite as intelligent as the movie suggests.  But I digress.

When we meet Erin Brockovich in the film, she is a bombshell single mom down on her luck--a woman absolutely fearless to wear tight, suggestive--very revealing--outfits.  When her auto injury lawsuit gets thrown out, she bullies her way into a job at the firm of the lawyer who represented her (Albert Finney, a curmudgeon to my liking).  But what's she going to do?  Turns out she's a heck of an investigator, uncovering a cover-up by powerful Pacific Gas & Electric.  The utility giant has been dumping toxic waste near Hinkley, California, and the poison has seeped into the ground water, causing premature death and gruesome disease.  Erin befriends the victims, convincing over 600 of them to file a class action lawsuit, while PG&E throws up roadblock after roadblock.  There are the (predictable) setbacks, and all the while Erin's personal life is put in serious strain, yet in the end there is a poignant feel good moment, augmented by a fiery Erin getting her long overdue comeuppance once she receives her bonus check from Finney's gloating character.

This is my favorite Julia Roberts role (to be honest, there's not much competition); the actress aptly carries the freight the entire story.  Finney more than holds his own, and the chemistry with Roberts is exceptional.  Special kudos to Aaron Eckhart as the free spirit, shaggy, next door neighbor biker who ends up babysitting Erin's three kids on a full-time basis; Eckhart's character is the soothing balm that keeps Erin's life from spinning out of control.  There are some jarring moments with the victims, and this film, as it's based on a true story, will make you angry, yet overall ERIN BROCKOVICH is a win/win:  Justice is served, and it's delivered by a vehicle that's ever so easy on the eye.

I will admit to the admiration of the true life Erin B. and her ability to get those 634 signatures in one week, that is a movie on it's own imho...  This is the first Julia film that portrays her bad angle, the sad sak story on the bed w/George just made her features harsh and more of that to come unfortunately, what a gorgeous woman who just lost her looks and just can't put a finger on where.... the hair, lips, eyes, ????  should have showcased the real Erin more in the film, she is one hottie w/a mega bod, Julia looks like a 10yo boy w/pushup bra...  wish I had her money in the early days to buy that seXy wardrobe... felt bad for ol' George watching those kids 24/7 and not getting any, who would expect a guy for ANY amount of cash to do that job??  soooo, high recommend: David vs Goliath routine drama, Aaron Eckhart w/long hair n harley, and some notable quotables i.e. STFU KRISPY KREME!!! priceless...",1370217600,,1236,4.28755364806867

1269236,5,B00003CXFU,"I love this movie because it is a sotry of someone who worked against tremendous odds and made a success of herself by discovering the gifts she had and never realized. She might never have known the meaning of chutzpah, but she certainly knew how to use it. In the process she winds up revealing a huge, longstanding toxic dump that was poisoning the residents of a small California town. She eventually is able to produce the evidence that convicts the utility company and makes them pay nearly $400,000 to the victims.
The only problem with this edition of the movie--at least for me--was the constant use of foul language. The F-word is in every other sentence of Erin's at different points in the movie, and other words are liberally sprinkled about. If that bothers you, I know there is another version that eliminates a huge amount of those words without messing with the plot. During the time Erin was really working on this case, she, too, developed medical issues from being too close to the contamination, and she really wound up in the hospital. This was filmed but never used; however, you can find a version that includes those scenes, either in situ or as an appendix.",1365724800,,1183,4.6923076923076925

As for the Blu-ray and digital copy added for the 100th Anniversary edition, I have not used the digital copy, but the Blu-ray is PHENOMENAL. It was crystal clear on a 1080p screen.

Like a detective and secret agent she investigated an extremely villainous assault on people's lives, property and welfare for money, and works not only with authorities but with the people.  Every bit as exciting and suspenseful as any spy movie, the plot went on to a happy ending with which and person or family could identify.

I would also recommend her book, ""Take it from Me,"" which adds to the film and explains that there are no fairy tale happy endings.  For better or worse life goes on, and she tell us how to make the best of it.",1353024000,,619,4.4035087719298245

1269384,5,B00003CXFU,"This video is a classic, and worth reviewing to note the methodology by which Erin Brockovich took on the struggles of a town to legally challenge PG&E's dumping of hexavalent chromium into the water supply. The exposure of PG&E's attempts to buy off the innocent victims who were dying of all kinds of various chronic lethal diseases provides a compelling view of the dark side of human nature. This slice of California history serves as a universal eternal morality tale. The story of Erin, compassionate leader of the victims, is truly inspirational and empowering for anyone cowed by corporations, the system, or any of life's challenging situations.

1269389,5,B00003CXFU,"This is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.
I watch it at least one time every year much as with the Grapes of Wrath. Not at all alike but dam good storytelling.

PG&E does a lot of good for the Country. But sometimes with Companies and Governments
some group of idiots and Jerks will put profit above safty and could care less who is hurt. In some cases even famleys.  Who ever was in Charge of the pumping stations at PG&E should go to prison personaly. But like the Government the personel are sometimes  protected and the whole company pays. As it should.
I would love to see a simalar Movie about Al Gore and the MTBE contamination in the State of CA because of his Greed. All Gore tried to tell us all that MTB in the Gasoline would be a good thing even though UCB tested it and showed that it not only would not help but would harm the state. And it has and folks are being contmitated and there are deaths not unlike the PG&E case. It is not the oil companys fault like Barbara Boxer wanted to say and sue them for the contamination. The oil companys made it very clear and fought to keep this crap out of the fule we need. Al Gore MADE the State Add this stuff to the fule. And it is still in the fuel. Who Wins. Al Gore Does. Just like a few folks at PG&E. They could have used many many non toxic substances as anti oxidents in the pumping station cooling water. Just as al gore could have used something other than MTBE. A nasty substance made from Natural Gas. And guess what. Al's family owns or at the time owned stock on the plants that made the stuff.

He also at about the same time made the Federal government sell the Navy Oil Wells and resever oil to Ocidental petro;ium for a few cents on the $. You and I paid for these wells and Al gore is making $ on them.

This Movie helps remind me of all the kinds of things folks will do to others to make some $ and it is discuting. Give them some power and watch out. They will change into persons who lie and cheat.

Get the Movie. It is a true story. Just as is the Grapes of Wrath.

When we arrived at the small town called Barstow, however, in the middle of the Mojave Desert, it was to find that the harshness of the life there was more extreme than anything I had ever known, ever known existed. The people there appeared hardened, etched into the jeans they wore, with skin that told many tales. Trips to the ocean and the carnival parks became a thing of the past.

The little house sat on a dusty plat of land, ten acres in size, at the end of a road surrounded by sagebrush. Walls of hot dust, rocks that glimmered in the daytime, crooked telephone poles that dangled glass beads and strings of copper, peppered the landscape. I used to stare at those lines, imagining they led to treasures on the other end. The only reference point I had to my previous home was the water hole I found in the middle of a field that otherwise served as a yard of rocks. (chapter 11)

1269423,5,B00003CXFU,"Strong, emotional, at times pathetic, this film will let you enjoy a real case in its Hollywood rendering. The theme is not new, especially in the US where these disputes about the pollution created by industrial businesses end up all the time in front of a judge. The active woman who is going to fight for that case has three kids, has been married twice and she got divorced twice too. She is fighting for her independence and a motivation in her life in general and professional life in particular. The case is simple: an industrial factory pollutes the soil of a whole residential zone, knows it and hides it to the residents and even lies to them. That Erin Brokovich is doing the only work that can win a case like that: she canvasses all the people who have a reason to claim some damage. She gets them all to sign the document to go in front of a judge. In spite of not liking the procedure chosen by the new experienced associate of the firm she goes along with it and even finds a direct witness of the misbehavior of the business and of its concealing methods. That witness has even stolen some documents that he was supposed to destroy. That will bring an unexpectedly high result and Erin will get a nice check in the end. But Julia Roberts is excellent because she embodies a pugnacious lady that is both stubborn and effective, charming at times and uncompromising when necessary. She manages to win the heart of her son over, though he is young, the understanding and support of her third boyfriend who is going to be the third husband one day, and of course the case more than anything else. There is no real suspense in the film but the impersonation of Erin Brokovich by Julia Roberts is the real charm of the story.

I think Albert L. Finney does a bang up job as Edward L. Masry (the lawyer who hires Brockovich), but all the characters do great work.  A story with substance and pathos.

1269469,5,B00003CXFU,"Steven Soderbergh made an impressive directorial debut in 1989 with Sex, Lies, and Videotape. Six unremarkable films followed: Kafka, King of the Hill, Underneath, Gray's Anatomy, Out of Sight and The Limey. Then, in 2000 he directed two hits: Erin Brockovich and Traffic. Traffic won a number of international awards and Julia Roberts won an Oscar for Best Actress as the brash tough-talking Erin Brockovich.
The award was well deserved. This was probably Julia Roberts' best performance, although her later appearances in two Mike Nichols films: Closer in 2004 and Charlie Wilson's War in 2007, come close. Julia became America's Sweetheart in 1990 in Garry Marshall's Pretty Woman. Now she is approaching Merle Streep territory as she matures and continues to work for our best directors. Her Erin Brockovich compares favorably with Streep's Karen Silkwood in the 1983 Nichols movie Silkwood.
Meanwhile, Soderbergh seems to have been on hiatus recently with three rat pack films and other lesser offerings. His 2008 epic Che, just coming out on DVD and blu-ray may redeem him. Stay tuned in.",1264464000,,1094,5.221590909090909
1269470,5,B00003CXFU,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't THIS the movie where Julia Roberts really became the great movie actress that we think of today?  The movies I've seen released before this one starring Julia Roberts show an actress on the verge of greatness, but never quite reaching that point for whatever reason.

Well, Erin Brockovich is definitely a movie I have no problem calling fantastic.  Perhaps it's the memories of when the film came out and how I remember my family really enjoying how Julia's character develops into a strong and intelligent woman, or perhaps it has more to do with the writing of the story, which is both interesting AND moving.  Not to mention the kind of storyline anyone of any age can understand and appreciate.

I will always remember Erin Brockovich as the movie that got me into paying more attention to movies as a whole more than anything else, and I recommend everyone watch it at least once and see if you too are able to discover the same kind of enjoyment that me and my family once did.

This is also an important movie that women should take notice of, because it shows women can do absolutely anything if they set their minds to it.  I believe Erin Brockovich sets an example for everyone though, men and women alike, to stand up for what you believe in.",1257724800,,1289,4.554112554112554
1269471,4,B00003CXFU,"I cannot believe the abomination that is Erin Brockovich. This is a $100 million+ grossing wretched trash catered to the audience in the same fashion as Patch Adams. Anybody who loathes the manipulative, vulgar and sentimental Patch Adams will hate Erin Brockovich as well.  Steven Soderbergh directed this saponaceous and sanitized Hollywood version after his botched effort The Limey and he does with his annoying guerilla cinematic gimmicks as usual -- which is also an irritating factor of the film.  What really grates my nerve the most is not only Julia Roberts' bizarre and over-the-top portrayal of the real-life Erin Brockovich whose attitude and lifestyle are rude, irresponsible and repugnant but also the fact Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter seem to believe this is an important ""message movie"". If that's the actual intent of the film, then it fails because it definitely isn't the emotionally intense and sympathetic movie unlike Michael Mann's brilliant film The Insider. It just ends up cumbersome and retch-inducing with the forced ""stand-up-and-cheer happy ending"" that borders on utter audience manipulation. These and the steady stream of coarse and vulgar language throughout the movie -- especially in the scenes where Erin cuss at her kids and desecrated over 600 clients with her ""sexual favor"" reference intended as a sarcastic joke -- made me despise the movie with vehemence. If this movie was meant to reflect the exhibition of the vulgar attitude by the real-life Erin Brockovich, then I have no respect for her as an intelligible human being whatsoever.  Any movie glorifying the cynical attitude of the characters and screwed-up lifestyles like the ghastly overrated American Beauty do not deserve my respect. This movie is an insult to my perceptive sense of common sense, decency and intelligence.",1253404800,,1837,5.305841924398625
1269472,3,B00003CXFU,"Julia Roberts gives an excellent and Oscar worthy performance of real-life character Erin Brockovich who in finding a way to make ends meet stumbles upon a case of big corporate bully and exploiter of the innocent against the simple folk and serves as the catalyst in putting ambulance chasing to good use for a change.  In stark contrast to the beginning of the show where Erin fails to take advantage of ambulance chasing on the small scale with her traffic accident claim the huge payoff she gets at the end of the show where she presumably helps more people than just herself and her kids seems to argue a case for the necessity of this particular form of legal practice to protect the little guy who would otherwise have no way to seek proper justice.

It is indeed amazingly hypocritical for Americans to decry poisonous Chinese-made toys and/or melamine laced candy when they themselves are poisoning their own citizen's drinking water however this in no way excuses the Chinese situation naturally although it is interesting to see just how if given a chance American companies would happily kill innocents for the almighty dollar without a second thought.

This dvd has good special features such as interviews with Erin herself as well as a making-of documentary.  The picture and sound quality are both good without any obvious blemish to report.  It's hard to resist an underdog makes good story like this one and for this reason, this film ages pretty well.

The testimony in court doesn't go well; inappropriate language for this young mother may prejudice the jury. [Unfair, but that is life.] She applies for jobs over the phone. No experience? Erin gets a job at that law firm. She meets the new neighbors. Does she have problems at work? Erin learns why there are medical records in a real estate file. The Jensen family has medical problems. Chromium is involved, it can be deadly. There is a factory a few hundred yards away. Erin searches the records at the water board and finds evidence of pollution. Was she a beauty queen? [Looks aren't everything, manners count.]

Lawyer Ed Masry drops by for information. Erin gets even more information. Did PG&E pay for that doctor? The illnesses of the Jensen family can be explained by exposure to chromium hexavalent-6. ""Wow!"". Former neighbors of the Jensen's visit the office for advice. Lawyer Ed explains the laws, Erin explains the costs of litigation. Erin wears sandals in a barn yard! She talks to other neighbors. There are four more families involved. Can Erin find the evidence for law suits? Will she be threatened? Will the case become too large for a small firm? The judge upholds the suits, they will go to trial. Erin's job made her respected by people. [Feared rather than loved?] Masry has a new partner with the most experience in toxic tort law.

PG&E wants the case settled by arbitration. Erin still has a problem in dealing with people. Lawyer Theresa does not have the common touch. There is a problem in their suits, all of the plaintiffs must agree. If they don't use binding arbitration the case can go on for 15 or 20 years. Erin gets the signatures of the plaintiffs. Would a chance meeting bring new evidence? ""How did you do this?"" The judge decides for the plaintiffs, the amount is on the high end. Erin, ever abrasive, gets a surprise from Lawyer Ed. ""Do beauty queens know how to apologize?"" The settlement in Hinkley vs. PG&E was the largest award in a direct-action lawsuit in US history. Other suits against PG&E were pending.

1269627,5,B00003CXFU,"I don't understand how anyone couldn't love Julia Roberts.  I mean I guess I can see how maybe she just isn't your brand of actress, but truly, she is extraordinary.  She has turned out classic performance after classic performance and is a standup person to boot.  Her portrayal of Erin Brockovich may actually be one of her most challenging roles and she delivers it with such precise determination and dedication that she becomes so real and engaging and truly memorable.  The best thing about `Erin Brockovich' though is that Roberts is not the only reason to stay and watch.  Sure, she has everything a movie star needs to keep her audience at her beck-and-call, but Soderbergh (who had such a marvelous year in 2000) doesn't rely solely on Roberts to carry his film.

`Erin Brockovich' sports a brilliant script penned by Susannah Grant that utilizes fact with Hollywood drama and peppers in enough humor and charm to make the film stand out apart from your everyday biopic.

The film tells to story of Erin Brockovich, a brash young single mother who winds up working for attorney Ed Masry.  Erin doesn't always rub people the right way, but her blunt self-confidence carries her a long way in the legal world, especially when she takes it upon herself to investigate further a case involving a power company and their blatant disregard for the health of the citizens of Hinkley, California.  As Erin becomes absorbed in the case her personal life starts to take a turn as she meets her kind-hearted yet gruff-exteriored neighbor George.  `Erin Brockovich' does a masterful job of melding this woman's personal and professional life together in a way that makes both sides of her interesting and entertaining, never once waning.

One of the main reasons to watch this film is to witness the rapport between the actors on the screen.  Julia Roberts is a standout, obviously, but everyone involved pulls their weight and works wonderfully together.  Albert Finney is flawless as Ed Masry and should have won that Oscar.  His chemistry with Roberts is beautiful to witness, just beautiful.  In infuses this sense of paternal concern into his performance that makes Masry a likable and relatable character.  Another standout is Aaron Eckhart who marvelously captures the heart of George.  He plays to Roberts strengths and helps keep the personal side of this story lively and tender.

In the end, `Erin Brockovich' is a film that stands on its own, a film that deserves to be seen and lauded.  Roberts received countless amounts of praise for her performance (and a much deserved Oscar to boot) but I think the Academy Award nominations for Supporting Actor, Screenplay, Director and Best Picture speak for themselves in declaring just how impressive this film really is.",1208822400,2,2775,4.954643628509719
1269628,4,B00003CXFU,"Erin Brockovich is an exciting, motivating, movie for all people who might need a confidence boost. This is a movie about a young average woman searching for jobs to help raise her family. It has both physical and mental thoughts. If you are looking for a genuine movie, this is a great movie for you to watch as Erin works as a lawyer helping people sue a poisoning water company.

As the movie begins we watch as Erin Brockovich begins searching hopelessly but excited for jobs. The first job interviewer does not say anything to her after her interview, that's probably a no. As the movie continues Erin begins searching even for more jobs, as for one day she gets hit by a car and gets a lawyer. Of course the defendants' lawyer has to try and annoy Erin to get the truth out of her. Erin ends up not winning and because of her loss she demands her lawyer for a job. At first he says no but then he gives her a chance and that's when Erin's job search finally ends. As her first case she investigates about a contaminated water company PG & E. At first no one believes her when she tells them that the water they drink, bathe in, and  swim in, is contaminated with an illegal chemical chromium 6. Later on all of her clients start coming to her with information and things that have been happening to their families. Finally they start believing that it is not just for the money.

Later  on watching the movie it disappoints me how it never shows much scenes of Erin in Trial with the company. For example, it shows a scene with a judge but then it goes to another scene immediately. It was pointless when the movie took  me from one place to another. For example, when Erin was done arguing with one of her clients about how all she is trying to do is help , it skips all the way back to her job scene. Another thing I disliked was that the ending was practically clich&eacute;d it was as if...""and they lived happily ever after"". For example, the ending was that something good happens and then it just shows how how she keeps on going to other towns solving cases about the PG & E company.

Obviously between all these scenes, I did enjoy how this movie was unique, it did not copy of other stories or have its crazy ups and downs scenes. Also this is a very realistic/inspiring movie, (its based on a true story). This can happen again anywhere in the world. For example, there could be another lawyer or person investigating about something that is harming and affecting humans and getting paid for it. Another thing is that I loved whenever she had something negative come by, she still didn't give up and stop the case.

Erin is one of those ladies you love to hate, until you see the goodness and intelligence that may not be the first thing that most people notice about her.  And she's a bulldog.  Once she gets moving in one direction, there's no stopping her which is a good thing, at least in the true story that this movie portrayed.

1269672,5,B00003CXFU,"PG&E, Pacific Gas And Electric company, unintentionally polluted ground water for the town of Hinkley, CA, but tried to cover it up rather than admitting they had caused a major health problem to the residents.  This cover up went on for a long time, until a barely-employable spitfire named Erin Brockovich, working for the lawyer Ed Masry, uncovers a strange file of real estate documents which include medical records.  Curious as to why a real estate file would contain medical documents, she begins to research the case.

What follows is the true story of a woman named Erin Brockovich, who together with Ed Masry uncovered a major cover up of a health hazard resulting in one of the largest settlements in history.  This film is extremely well done, dividing its time between Erin the worker, Erin the single-mom trying her best to raise her three kids, and Erin the human being.  The movie skates over the fact that the real Erin got sick along with the rest of the town (although you can see some cut scenes of her illness in the ""deleted scenes"" feature).

The movie is definitely a dramatized reproduction of the true story, though it still manages to hold very close to the truth.  A&E has done a special on the Erin Brockovich case which proves the movie stays true to form.  Julia Roberts as Erin and Albert Finney as Ed Masry both give excellent performances.  The movie isn't necessarily fast-paced but the dialogue is intriguing, intense at times, and funny at times, keeping the entertainment level high.  The acting and dialogue alone are enough to carry this film.

He perfectly compliments her in every scene they share, and the same can be said for Aaron Eckhart who plays George, Erin's neighbor who falls in love with her and offers her the stability she's always needed and never received.

As much as I enjoyed Pretty Woman, that performance doesn't compare to the excellent work Julia did portraying Erin Brockovich. Years ago, Albert Finney gave an excellent Tom Jones (classic movie, not the singer) portrayal.

I'm a paralegal and relate strongly to this movie - all the research and paper processing, the concern for clients, the knuckle-biting waits hoping verdicts are delivered favorably. It's a true story making it even more interesting.

Erin is a down-on-her-luck divorced mother of 3, just trying to make ends meet. She has a personal injury case after a vehicular accident, and is represented by the attorney who, after her case is lost at trial, becomes her boss (she kinda forces herself into his payroll). While working at the attorney's office, Erin happens upon the beginnings of a major class action suit against a water company that has been knowingly poisoning the residents of a town with chromium, a rust inhibitor. Nasty stuff, that chromium, when ingested. Will Erin and her boss persevere for their clients?

1269719,4,B00003CXFU,"Watching Julia Roberts play a jobless, skillness single mother whose greatest glory in life was winning a local beauty pageant, might make you wonder what she really thinks. Though Erin Brockovich achieved success far beyond what most in her position would, Roberts is consistently playing down to a station far beneath her own. While not unique in this film or for this actress, its particular noticeable in the contrasts here. Roberts is the only true ""welfare queen"" that ever lived, the Queen of Hollywood playing a destitute single mother, giving a chance for the ""common American"" (or at least the lower middle class single mothers out there) to live vicariously through her. Does she actually empathize with her subject or feel only a professional patronizing cynicism, as if we, the peons of life, must watch a film like this to lift us up from our ""hum-drum little lives"" (to borrow a quote from Jean Hagen)?

Cynical or empathetic, Erin Brockovich at least manages to deliver. When it takes flight from reality it is entertaining and when it hits home on everyday realities it is deeply troubling. A sharp reverse in gender roles is deeply evident, with the pedagogically talented boyfriend watching the kids 24/7 while Brockovich goes off to pursue the substance of the film. Once this logistical arrangement is established, the boyfriend's screen time drops off dramatically, and it might seem at times that we are only to be reminded later that, oh yeah, they still exist (how dull), but that is an unfair interpretation. Brockovich's family gets more screen time and substance than the families of the protagonists of any other typical Hollywood thriller would get (Ordinarily we don't see the wife and kids unless they are in physical danger, or unless a sex scene is about to happen). The movie is conscious of its own gender reversal and thrusts the challenge of balancing work and family into the light, tackling the awkward compromises head-on. Indeed, there are very deep though somewhat implicit family values dominating the film, and its to the credit of the scriptwriters that they were able to mix legal thriller and family drama as if they themselves were working parents trying to balance work and home. Certainly a unique film.",1143763200,2,2254,4.99468085106383
1269720,2,B00003CXFU,"Even though I would agree that ""Erin Brockovich"" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in ""Pretty Woman.""  I am second to no one in enjoying a good ""David and Goliath"" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the ""true"" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the ""Xena"" character is the main attraction in ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).

Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in ""Pretty Woman"" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.  Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.  Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.

Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired ""work clothes"" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.

Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The ""convenience"" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar ""bonus"" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a ""thanks"" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.

The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.

  Our whole family watched this DVD together (we have daughters in junior high & high school) and despite the language and ""R"" rating, I think it was excellent for them to get such a realistic look at the world's problems & such a positive message about the impact we as individuals can have when we take a stand on something.",1111276800,5,876,4.337423312883436
1269727,4,B00003CXFU,"Julia Roberts is winsome and not at all cloying in this *Silkwood* meets *Love Canal* meets *Marie* meets *Pretty Woman* extravaganza. In fact, I'd almost admit I'm beginning to like her, now that I've gotten past all the years of oppressive hype. But it's not her fault. She seems like a genuinely nice woman who is growing up to be a competent actress. And *Erin Brockovich* supplies her with just the kind of role that the world like's to see her in - beleaguered but with spunk (an often repellant combination). She plays the real-life whistle-blower of the title (the real Erin has a role as a waitress in the movie), and proves she's a real actress by following the time-honored path beaten by Hollywood actresses since time immemorial - playing white trash. But, of course, she's white trash with a heart of gold, who cares only about taking care of her three children, and finding justice in the world. With her bra showing most of the time, and her New Jersey-deluxe hair, she actually does a credible job of it, and that's where it's possible to develop compassion for her character. And thank God for that - for without her, there's little else memorable about this movie that makes it any different than the kind of movies made for the Lifetime channel. Finney is excellent as her boss, and the handsome Latham is wasted as the boyfriend when the love story just kind of fizzles out. Many say it's the best work Roberts has done. I wouldn't know.

1269807,4,B00003CXFU,"I think there are two aspects that are present all along the film. One of them is, of course, Julia Roberts. Her acting could be somewhat annoying as she is in almost every scene: her bad-temperament, her mini-clothes and lots of her clichs are present in the more than two hour length of the film.

The second aspect is the horrible hot and yellowish tone of all scenes, even when at night. When the movie finished I thought I have been watching some documental in the desert or the African savannah!

Well, the movie is well oriented. It is easy to have a real testimony to make your film and watching the extras (which alone would be rated 5) you find the film is a lovely story of struggle and desperation with a more-than-happy ending. If the story was not true, it was almost impossible to believe attorney Ed Masry had a great heart and a good eye to keep with Erin Brockovich.

Albert Finney is rescued from the past. It's more than 40 years he made a success with Tom Jones and in the last few years had only made several TV film appearances. Good job and great similarity to the real Masry!

People are sick and dieing by drinking and using water with a toxic form of chromium in their water wells.  How did it get there?  It got there by PG&E's thoughtless use of the toxin in their plants.  It all started before 1966 - the corporate office knew, but didn't do anything about it.  It's a classic case of turning a blind eye to a huge environmental problem to save the bottom line.  It's an example of a big, faceless, powerful economic force not caring for the little guy - just as long these same little guys pay their bills and add to the profit margin of the company.

1269811,5,B00003CXFU,"The year of 2000 belonged to Steven Soderbergh, directing two of the year's best films, this and ""Traffic"" (the year's BEST). ""Erin Brockovich"" partially served as a foreshadowing of ""Traffic"" through its vivid and bumptious style, utilizing different color tints and handheld cinematography. However, its main glory is obvious: Julia Roberts.

 With her impudent, dauntless and saucy performance, the character of Erin Brockovich perfectly mirrored Soderbergh's style of filmmaking. Susannah Grant's screenplay contained impeccable lines to quote, ranging from, ""They're called boobs, Ed,"" to, ""Bite my ass, Krispy Kreme."" Roberts pulled it off graciously and unflinchingly, finally winning the Oscar on her third try.

 And, while there may or may not have been a boost in sales of actual Krispy Kremes from that now-famous quotation, the true Krispy Kreme of the film is certainly Roberts, without whom Soderbergh's film would have been bland, tedious and ultimately unmakeable, although Soderbergh could certainly have come up with another brilliant film on the flip of a dime.

 The point is, Krispy Kremes have new meaning, and as such, Julia Roberts can tell anyone to bite her ass.",1091577600,,1189,5.434782608695652
1269812,3,B00003CXFU,"Julia Roberts is like the vanilla ice cream of movies. Everyone pretty much likes her more or less, and for a dessert, she'll do in a pinch.

And I don't mean that literally.

Of course, vanilla ice cream isn't really all that memorable, and, I'll admit, there are a few memorable Roberts moments. But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts: she is the same in every movie.

There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way. If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots. But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore. Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film.

Don't get me wrong. It's entertaining. But it's formulaic. A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot. The story: Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm. Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car. This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way.

They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man. Hip hip hooray!

I didn't ruin the movie for you. It's not a surprise. This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on. Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality. Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre.

With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges. Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone.

Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe. Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib. Erin serves it up piping hot.

And she won't take none of your lip, neither.",1091491200,3,2775,4.849894291754757
1269813,4,B00003CXFU,"Erin Brockovich is a real woman with real problems and a real will to do something good. So what does she do? Something good. And, quite honestly, it's fun to watch her do it.
Brockovich (Julia Roberts, Oscar-winner for this role) has three kids, two ex-es, and a realy foul mouth. When she lands a job at the law office of Ed Masry (Albert Finney, Oscar-nominee for this role), she finds herself initiating the investigaiton of a local power plant, which has apparently contaminated the water of a small town nearby and caused numerous illness and deaths. Erin keeps pushing Ed and the townspeople, and ends up being a participant in a 333 million-dollar lawsuit, one of the biggest in American history.
Besides a heartwarming David-and-Golliath story, this is essentially a star vehicle for the winning Julia Roberts, as well as an ego trip for the real-life Erin Brockovich (who gained MUCH publicity... after the release of the film). The film is not perfect: it sometimes lacks a sense of coherence (one scene ends and the next begins without flow), and some performances are mediocre. However, Roberts finally frees herself from her previous stereotype of the candy-colored heroine and Finney is wonderful as usual, and also noted is a quite moving supporting performance by TV-veteran Marg Helgenberger, who plays Donna Jensen, a victim of the contaminated water due to the power plant's carelessness.

 While many movies have subtle and underlying themes, ""Eric Brockovich"" blatantly screams female empowerment and the fracturing of feminine stereotypes. This movie tells the amazing true story of a woman who against all odds and against many hardships was able to turn a court case around. At first glance Erin Brockovich with her skimpy clothes, bad manners, tough attitude, kids and mediocre job seem to frame Erin as a promiscuous, ill mannered and irresponsible mother type. It seems as though she is capable of nothing but mediocrity. Yet, throughout the movie her behavior, intelligence, courage, hard work and use of femininity help her become something even more special then she could have ever imagined.
 Erin's appearance is an entity of its own throughout the movie.  In the movie she is an extremely good-looking female who dresses to impress. With her breasts in plain view, tight clothes that show her curves and the way she carries herself; they all combine to objectify her as a ""piece of meat"", and not a person. Men cease to see her as a woman and only as a commodity/object of which to look at or try to acquire. This phenomenon is not in vain; it serves a purpose for Erin. The objectification in the eyes of all men allows to her to unsuspectingly acquire knowledge and to get her way without any resistance. This concept is not unique to only Erin. All women whom radiate these qualities are deemed a sexual prize to admire or try to win, they loose all personality and substance. It is a common theme within society today and will always be. Ironically, this objectification that seemingly decreases her human feminine substance is just the thing that allows her to become the staple of female empowerment throughout the movie.
 This movie also works to explore some feminine stereotypes that society has built through the last couple of decades. The fact that ""a middle age mother, fairly non-educated and of the middle class"" is able to achieve so much in law/ humanity is really amazing. She proved that someone of the middle social and economic class can achieve greatness. Most importantly, she proves that women can take processes that work against them and turn them around in their favor. Erin also took the notion that someone so attractive and expressive is just a nitwit/ ""sexual prize"" and destroyed all precedent with her achievements on screen and in reality.",1084320000,,2673,4.986547085201794

1269850,5,B00003CXFU,"Erin Brckovich, Directed by Steven Soderbergh was an outstanding movie in my view. This movie was about a single mother who was determined to make ends meet for her three children and herself. Erin Brockovich's had to struggle to get her job by being turned down, and everything in her life was being challenged by car accident,undependable babysitters and a house with cockroaches crawling on your food. Erin was so determined to make a name for herself that she didn't take no for an answer with a law firm who tried to turn her down for a job. As Erin persued her career with this law firm she still was encoountered by challenges with the employee's at the firm as she was not very well liked by fellow workers. This just seemed to make her want to even work harder to prove to this firm she was well worth her weight. Julia Roberts definetly played this role perfect as she was able to be a single mom but,also a very educated woman who had the will,and determination to make things happen for this law firm.
  In my view I feel this is one of the best movies Julia Roberts played as an actress who made her way to the top in this movie. She had so many obstacles in the way which made her give it all she had to succeed. This is a must see movie!!!!",1081036800,,1255,4.291139240506329
1269851,3,B00003CXFU,"Although highly overrated, this movie is far from being great, as it is distant to Z-grade filmmaking. Overall, ""Erin Brockovich"" is an above average Hollywood flick that suceeds due to two relevant elements: the director Steven Soderbergh and the lead actress Julia Ruberts. Frankly, I have never been a big fan of any of them, but I`ll admit that they make this movie work.
Roberts gives a solid and convincing performance, probably her best ever, and proves that she can do better than formulaic romantic comedies. Soderbergh creates a film that is somewhat like many predictable TV-movies, yet he manages to present a couple of details which turn this effort into a peculiar and distinct one (professional and appealing direction, competent character development, a familar story told in an absorbing and gripping perspective).
Despite the typical Hollywood ending that certainly won`t surprise anyone, ""Erin Brockovich"" is an interesting cinematic experience that doesn`t need to rely on high action, multiple twists or shock-value scenes to offer enough dramatic tension. This is a subtle and well-crafted effort, not the great film ever but not a disappointment either (however, the huge hype that it received may work against it).

A down and out, twice divorced, single mother desperately looking for a job finally bullies her way into a job in a law office using the excuse that since her lawyer lost her injury case that he said she would win that he owed her.
She ends up looking into some real estate files that have medical records attached to them and is confused.  As she delves deeper, she is shocked and horrified at finding that a major energy company has been dumping toxic chromium waste knowing that it is getting into the water system and making people sick, etc.  She convinces her boss to help the people by taking the matter to court.

Plus: I've seen it twice on cross-country plane trips, once in the local theater, and once on home video. Lordy!
Anyway...
This fact-based movie earned Julia Roberts an Oscar, deservedly. It captured her ability for slapstick, pathos, drama, etc. Twice-divorced and flat broke Brokovich forces her way into a job in the office of a lawyer who failed to win her a big award in a traffic accident injury case, then goes on to make herself indispensible in the investigation of toxic chromium contamination of the groundwater of little no-place, no-count Hinkley, California, where locals have suffered a plague of pain, death and disease. With her common-folk ways, she succeeds in winning the confidence of 100% of the distrustful and jaded populance - and a huge award in a personal injury case against big business.

OK, sure, some people talk about her big mouth, and she works it out quite a bit. But we have to give a big hand to Wonderbra - they worked wonders on Julia!
This film gets bogged down by a lot of jargon about the world that Julia's character works in. Not enough attention is paid to her attention of her kids, or their father(s). Some will say the highligh of the movie is Julia prancing around in a low cut top, belts, and sky scraping heels. True. But put that aside and you've got a potentially good movie on your hands. It could have been cut, and been much more interesting. I wouldn't have given Julia an Oscar for it though.",1070323200,,807,4.212903225806452

Julia Roberts portrays true life Erin Brockovich.  A lady who came from a not so glamerous background who with the help of the law firm she worked for took on big and powerful Pacific Gas And Electric (PG&E) and won a huge settlement for the townspeople of Hinckly, California.  This is a true life case where PG&E used Hazardous Chemicals in their electric turbines and took the waste from the turbines (Chronium) and instead of safely containing them in lined waste ponds, decided not to make the ponds safe and thus the Chronium seaped into the ground soil and contaminating the town's water supply.
Erin Brockovich (Roberts Character), needed a job desperately and was able to work for a law firm who had the case ""pro bono"".  THANK Goodness for the law firm and Hinckly that Brockovich worked for the lawyers (even though she isn't a lawyer).
Overcoming a tremendous burden (single mom, low paying salary), Brockovich researched the cases, got to know the townspeople, gathered evidence, and to make a long story short, won for the ""little people"", over 300 Million Dollars!!
This is a movie that everyone would enjoy.  Roberts rightfully won the Oscar for Best Actress from this movie.  All actors/actresses in this movie did an excellent job.  The plot is true life captivating, intelligent, and will keep the viewers interest from the very first scene.

He has his unique styles in displicting certain important scenes so the audience can understand the deeper atmosphere that these characters are in.  Julia Roberts was well-deserving of her Oscar for Best Actress for the portrayal of this feisty, strong-willed woman.  Her emotional and financial struggles prove that there is always hope for a brighter future.  The real-life Brockovich isn't a bad actress as performed in her small role as a waitress.  The screenplay has many creative words giving it a broader emotional edge.  Some are funny.  This will force the audience to listen closer to what every character says, especially Brockovich.

1269929,4,B00003CXFU,"The 2000 film ""Erin Brockovich"" is named for the woman whom this true-life story is about.  Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) was an unemployed, poorly educated, single, twice-divorced mother of 3 young children trying to find work to make ends meet.  Following a car accident, her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), was unable to win her lawsuit against the other driver in part due to Erin's irascible and antagonistic demeanor.  Frustrated, Erin storms into Ed's office following the trial and demands a job from him.  He reluctantly hires her and sets her to work on a seemingly simple real-estate deal, but the deal is anything but simple as medical records of the involved homeowners are included in the file.  As Erin investigates, she meets the homeowners, Pete and Donna Jensen (Michael Harney and Marg Helgenberger respectively), who have been repeatedly sick for a long time, as well as their children.  The potential buyer is not an individual, but a major corporation that has an industrial plant very close to the couple's home.  Erin's investigation leads her to some potentially damaging information about the corporation's doings near the Jensen's home that has also affected many more people within the immediate area.
Though the story about sick homeowners and corporate doings is powerful and thought provoking, the time in the film devoted to Erin's homelife is far less compelling in part because of Julia Roberts' acting.  Julia Roberts earned the Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Erin Brockovich, but that was probably due more to the politics surrounding the film rather than the quality of actual acting.  The film was also nominated for four other Oscars including Best Supporting Actor (Albert Finney), Best Director (Steven Soderbergh), Best Picture and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  Other notable actors in the film include Aaron Eckhart as Erin's unemployed biker boyfriend George and the real Erin Brockovich doing a cameo as a waitress.
Overall, for its engaging story about sickened residents in a small community but less than stellar acting, I rate ""Erin Brockovich"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  If you have never seen the film, I highly recommend seeing it at least once.",1054166400,2,2228,5.110192837465565

Though not in the same league as a great film like the similarly-themed ""Silkwood,"" I found this to be an entertaining and satisfying tale of the little guy triumphing against the system.  Roberts is very good as a tough, tired, disappointed woman who flaunts what she sees as her only asset--her physical beauty.  Albert Finney fleshes out the underwritten role of Brockovich's boss, Ed Masry.  The character of George, however, is a misstep.  He is some kind of working woman's fantasy man--a tough, good-looking biker who is also sensitive, domestic, and good with kids.  He comes across as a blatant plot device--a convenient way to show that Brockovich's kids are being cared for while she works overtime as well as provide a love interest whose only real purpose is to be neglected so we can see the impact of her job on her personal life.

So she gets into a car accident and sues the man who hit her. She loses. No money there. So she ends up working at her lawyer's firm.

It was totally entertaining, gripping, and handled the serious subject with humor and a straight-forward drive. There is never a dull moment. (I don't understand why ""Traffic"" won the Oscar for its choppy, coarse editing, while this wasn't even nominated). I've also never understood the standards involved in the Best Sound category, but every subtle whisper & utterance of Susannah Grant's brilliant screenplay was clear, crisp and understood; also not nominated for Best Sound.  What the Oscars got totally right was Julia's performance. This was an example of total control and commitment. I haven't been so impressed in many years. I was also very impressed with the kid performances of Scotty Leavenworth & Gemmenne de la Pena as Erin's kids. They were real and natural. I can't tolerate bad kid actors. I was impressed with the performances of Marg Helgenberger and Cherry Jones, and Jamie Harrold (as Scott) was perfectly dorky, a real treat. Then there was the great Albert Finney who seemed to be the centering force in the whole spiel. He was customarily excellent. This is, quite simply, an excellent film, and deserved a lot more credit than Julia's flawless performance.

I was pretty disappointed, though.  The title character, who I guess we are all supposed to see as a sharp, tough woman, seemed to me little more than someone with such a chip on her shoulder she was bowing under the weight.  Her law partner (who was excellently played by Albert Finney) was nothing but kind to her, and she was constantly accusing him of trying to cheat her or of going behind her back.  He gave her a car, for Heaven's sake, and she was still treating him like the enemy.  Her refusal to dress professionally wasn't funny, either..it was an indication to me that she was a person who was determined to be rude to others.
Since seeing the film, I have read more about Ms. Brockovitch and discovered that the story in the film is only half of the truth anyway.  Many people in the town she ""saved"" found that their settlements were much smaller than the settlements of people who were particular ""buddies"" of Erin's..not to mention the fact that the chemical everyone in the film was so upset about is certainly present in Erin's cigarettes in far greater concentration than it was in the water, and that that particular chemical has STILL never been proven to do damage to people.

Roberts is perfectly cast as the titular (no pun intended) character, a 30-something ex-beauty queen with the mouth of a truck driver and the body of a Barbie doll, as well as its sense of responsibility. Down on her luck after two failed marriages (surprise), three kids (surprise) and no money in the bank (surprise), Brockovich hooks up with a broken down ambulance chaser (played marvelously by the always affable Albert Finney) following a car accident that may have been her fault. After practically extorting a job from Finney, she latches onto the plight of a California town, whose bumpkinish residents have been slow-poisoned by the local power utility. The movie wants to tell a David-and-Goliath story about a ""common"" woman taking on the big, bad corporation, but too often the motives of Brocovich get clouded by her self-indulgent behavior. For instance, she routinely dumps her kids on whoever will watch them, including a scary-looking but kind-hearted biker who just wants a girlfriend that's actually around. Though she claims her crusade is for the residents--she even seems to sacrifice her health for the case--ego seems more the impetus, as she basks in the adulation of the townspeople and takes generous swipes at anyone with a formal education, all while routinely running as far away from her own family as possible. And she expects a big check in the end from the very lawyers whose ethics she repeatedly condemns. What does that make her? I just don't buy into the cockeyed moral center of the movie, no matter how much gritty charm Roberts brings to the role. Ultimately, of course, Brockovich triumphs, but the movie makes it clear that it's her sexuality that open doors for her and not much else. True to life? Probably. But so is cancer.

Erin (Julia Roberts) finds out about it, and makes the company pay $334,000,000 to the residents that were affected by the contaminated water.  Roberts definately deserved the Oscar for this one.",1026345600,,538,4.752688172043011
1270015,5,B00003CXFU,An absolutely brilliant movie.  Julia is definitely the hottest star in Hollywood and this movie really shows all her acting skills.,1019606400,,132,5.285714285714286
1270016,5,B00003CXFU,"It is often hard for a movie about a landmark legal battle to capture the public's interest, especially if it is based on a true story. Examples include A Civil Action in 1998 and The Insider in 1999. Despite much critical praise, these movies were apparently perceived by audiences as being too dry. Such was not the fate of Erin Brockovich, which became the first smash hit of 2000. Perhaps having Julia Roberts as the title character fighting for justice helped make the difference. I know it didn't hurt.
The picture opens with Erin desperately looking for a job. She's twice divorced from no good husbands and has a child to support. After one interview, she is injured in a car wreck when another driver runs a red light. She decides to sue the other person, not because she is greedy, but because she needs to be compensated for her medical expenses. She turns to a lawyer named Ed Masry [Albert Finney], a very busy man who virtually assures her that she will win. Ed does not factor in Erin's flashy, almost trashy taste in clothing or her tendency to spew out four letter words when she is angered. Her appearance on the witness stand is a disaster, and they lose the case, which brings forth a tirade on the lawyer from Erin. Meanwhile, she meets a decent guy who winds up frightening her. She has had such rotten luck with men. In an ironic turn of events, she ends up working for Ed Masry. The other women in the office are pretty hostile, since Julia's style is hardly what we expect in a staid law office. Erin persists, and one day she discovers a case that has been on the office's back burner. It involves a group of people who live adjacent to one of Pacific Gas and Electric's plants. There is a probability that these people have been poisoned for years by chromium the company has allowed to seep into the local drinking water.
There are several things which make the movie work. Much of it concentrates on two very interesting characters, Erin and Ed, rather than on the workings of the legal system itself. It also plots the progress of a remarkable woman. Erin starts off as an intelligent woman with vitally no marketable skills. Also lacking any skills at dealing with other people, she seems destined to be someone who works a lifetime just to eke out a living. For some inner reason, this legal case mesmerizes her. It requires her to learn a whole lot very fast and to put her personal life aside for a cause worth fighting for. In the process, we watch as a whole new woman emerges. Her progress is at least as interesting as the legal battle's.
Julia Roberts and the great British actor, Albert Finney, are splendid as Erin and Ed. The way they play off of each other reminds me of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. There is no sex involved, but this is decidedly a battle of the sexes. She's too brash and outspoken for him, and he's too stuffy and cautious for her. It is a case of opposites attracting. As for the movie itself, it's a case of a job well done.",1016409600,,2997,4.480804387568556

1270020,1,B00003CXFU,"i went into this movie not expecting much. i expected not to like it. i had no idea that i would be absolutely repulsed. for one thing this idea has been done before. i had already seen civil action with john travolta, which is much better. for one thing travolta can act, and julia roberts can't.
but the big problem with the movie is erin herself. she is just so unlikable. there is a real problem with a movie when you're rooting against the ""heroine.""  she has 3 kids, no husband and no job. i've heard this before. she plays the victim thing real well. she complains about everything. she demands a job just because her lawyer couldn't win her lawsuit for her. maybe it was the fact that she was't that injured or she  cursed at the judge and the jury. does she blame anything on herself? of course not. she blames it on ed, her lawyer(the only real likeable character in the film) for a job. she has no skills of course, and doesn't really wear any clothes. and of course when ed asks her to wear more business like clothes, she curses him off, like she does with everyone else. when ed offers to rehire her, she demands a raise, saying ""i can get a job anywhere."" really? what arrogance. she's supposed to be a great mother but does she actually spend anytime with them. no? she dumps them off on her semi-boyfriend george. george eventually leaves because he doesn't want to be treated like some slave, but of course erin manages to say that ""my two ex-husbands never gave me much choice."" please. ...
then there's the people themselves. it's horrible what's happening to a lot of them. it's sad. erin says they don't really care about the money, but they certainly complain a lot when their worried they might make 50 million dollars instead of 400 million.
there is just nothing to this movie. it's all been done before, and it's all predictable. the whole point of the movie is to like erin brockovich, but she just makes you want to smash your television. recommendation: see civil action or the verdict.  their  basically the same movies and there's no erin brockovich.",1012003200,11,2082,4.529255319148936

My one flaw with the movie is Erin's full-force bravado that comes with little reproach.  She manages to fire off some SERIOUSLY mean things, but yet is never really heald accountable for them.  Hard to suspend my disbelief when most real life situations calling for this would probably get you belted.
Overall, a seriously well acted film that horrifically depicts the corrupting power of a large corporation and it's ripple effect on a community and on lives.  But it also shows how much power one person really can have.",1010707200,,799,4.845588235294118

1270023,1,B00003CXFU,"This is basically a movie of the week,except for the presence of Julia Roberts. This movie,like any Hollywood production doesn't bother with the facts,only with what makes drama and pulls at the heartstrings. This movie is more fairy tale than anything and paints one side(Brokovich and her lawyers)as the ""Good guys"" and the Gas company as the BIG<EVIL monster. Go to Fumento.com for a few real facts on the case. First of all it has never been established that Chromium 6(supposedly the cause of Hinckley residents illnesses)is a toxic agent except when inhaled. But laywers knew that a 30 billion dollar corporation would make a rich target. So they set out to find as many sick people as they could find,and lo and behold,with a few town meetings and intentional playing around with facts and manipulating peolple's fear you had a movement with momentum. Eventually,PG&E settled for $333 million,and of course the lawyers got a nice,fat sum for themselves(40%).Some of the plaintifs still haven't received any money. Of course during the trial,just like in this movie,facts never got in the way of a good victimology,good vs. evil story. With a society so despicably deficient in science it only makes sense that rackets like this could be carried out. By the way Brockovich and team have tried to pull their shenanigans elsewhere with little success. Second note:When news outlets went and interviewed residents of Hinckley the general consensus was that the only factual part of the movie was the name of the lawyer!

1270064,1,B00003CXFU,"Let's start with Julia Roberts.  Let's face it, she is a hack actress.  But she is a ""star"" and she puts butts in the seats.  Only 30 plus women admire her and buy tickets.  Let's see, an Oscar for being another one of her usual on screen loud bombastic characters?  Given that her character was one of today's PCims's most popular--the struggling single mother, I can see why she won.  That isn't merit!
More disappointing was the brilliant director Steven Soderbrugh.  What cinematic genius when he made stuff like ""Kafka"" ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" to name a few.  I am a fan.

1270065,5,B00003CXFU,"I think that almost everyone is familiar with this film version of how Erin Brokovitch took on a large corporation that had knowingly polluted the water supply of a small town, and through their intentional cover-up had adversely affected the health of almost everyone in that town. This is a true life David and Goliath story. Only, in this case, ""David's"" weapons were chutzpa, perseverance, cleavage, and a big dose of commitment to something she believed in, instead of a sling and a stone.
Brockovich was no dummy. To the contrary, as portrayed by Julia Roberts, (one of my favorite actresses!) she was bright, articulate (if a little earthy), and always aware of her impact on people. She had a natural empathy that people could feel. Consequently they liked her and responded to her. This applies, from what I've read, to the real life Brockovich, and certainly to the screen Brockovich. Julia Roberts' manner of dressing was, if anything, toned down a bit from that of the real life Erin Brockovich. For those who found Roberts' attire distracting, I wonder how you would have responded to the real Erin.
Albert Finney played her boss, a moderately successful ""shirt-sleeve"" attorney who had a lot to lose if the lawsuit went awry. He gave this role just the right blend of wit, concern, fear, anger, and elation. He's the attorney that we'd all like to find.
I found this movie to be entertaining, well acted, satisfying, and one that I can watch and watch with feeling so happy at the end. See it to know what I mean....",1008374400,,1530,4.7556390977443606
1270066,2,B00003CXFU,"There's nothing new from Julia Roberts in this movie. I have no idea what sort of woman the real Erin Brockovich was from Roberts' portrayal. This is just another movie in which Roberts turns her character into a form of herself. The only things I know about Brockovich from this movie, if it can be trusted for giving a correct portrayal of the woman, is that she is extremely brash and vulgar. I also highly doubt that the people that were actually surrounding this woman were as bland as they were made out to be.
When the movie finally comes around to the storyline about the contamination, everything smooths out a bit, and it becomes easier to overlook the sloppy characterization of just about everyone in this film. The only bits of description for the smaller characters were added to make the crude Brockovich look like a saint. If the real world were as full as such terrible people as in this movie, there would be no hope for civilization to last more than a few more years. And if Brockovich, as she is portrayed in the movie, were our salvation, like in the movie, we would be doomed.
As a writer, it always pains me to see a movie that could have been good completely wasted because of the screenplay. There's no excuse for secondary characters to be written as cardboard, or maybe that feeling only comes out in Julia Roberts films.

There's no desperate missions to liberate Nazi art treasures or courtroom custody battles over polio-stricken children. However director Soderbergh makes sure every ounce of tension is wrung from this seemingly unromantic plot. I watched this movie having already heard the whole plot on the radio, and it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the piece. Julia Roberts is in one of her best roles, making the rather strident character she plays likeable and identifiable with. Albert Finney provides fine support as the gruff American lawyer, and thoroughly deserved is Best Supporting Actor nomination. The pathos is overdone in some of the scenes featuring ill children, and the romance subplot seems a little unresolved, but - hey, it's based on the truth, and not everything works out well in real life... or maybe it does!",1001376000,,907,5.053333333333334

1270071,1,B00003CXFU,"Much-touted, much-praised, much-starred Erin Brockovich was a movie I was keeping for a lonely night at home, when I could rent it. To my disappointment, I discovered that Julia Roberts plays an extremely arrogant and mouthy lead character. Like the snotty girls who looked gorgeous in high school, but who thought themselves a cut above the rest of the merely plain or downright ugly masses, Roberts delivers a Brockovich who is foul-mouthed, contemptous, and demanding. I thought Dirty Dancing was bad and Terms of Endearment even worse, for portraying angry, demanding, self-pitying women who are continual victims of male exploitation or indifference; this movie tops them both.
  Fortunately there is the relief of the exquisite actor Albert Finney. Even his character is dominated by Roberts's Brockovich, but he at least manages to stand up for himself and explain the facts of life as a hard-working, simple-living, honest lawyer who has had to scrape and save in order to create a life for himself and his family.
  The movie begins with Brockovich as the single mother of three children, a plight toward which anyone would be sympathetic, trying to secure work and keep her children safe at the same time. However, it gardually begins to dawn on the viewer that every character around Brockovich is either shallow, mean-spirited, or ugly. The babysitter is uncaring. The working world is unsympathetic. When she is injured, her lawyer (Finney) fails to secure her financial future through an injury lawsuit, even though Brockovich, in testifying as plaintiff, exhibits ubelievable rudeness, profanity, and accusatory behavior, against the advice of her counsel. Eventually, she browbeats Finney into employing her, to supposedly compensate her for his failure to win her case. On the job, she immediately alienates her co-workers, but in the movie, the subtext is not that Brockovich has been rude, which she has, but that her co-workers are stupid and ugly! There are more ""oh poor little girl"" scenarios offered in conversations that recall events prior to the setting of the plot. If the movie Patch Adams was too sweet in portraying one heart-tugging scenario after another, with the big bad world of corporate medicine as the villain, this movie is equally over-laden with attempts to portray the protagonist as a victim. What is truly amazing, however, is that all of this pathos surrounding the persona of Erin Brockovich has absolutely nothing to do with the principal story of the movie!
  Eventually, Brockovich begins to emerge as the champion of the rights of the ordinary citizen against the corporate interests which have contaminated their environment and lied to them about it. That is the theme of the movie and it is a fine story. Apparently based on reality, the inspirational value of the events has wonderful potential to make a fine, ""All-American hero"" plot, and with the added value of having a female hero. While that is still the core of the movie, the surrounding events, in which Brockovich browbeats, profanes, and dominates all of the males in her proximity, while scorning the women, drown out the essentially wonderful storyline.
  It is possible that the real Erin Brockovich is actually like that; perhaps Julia Roberts was only depicting the character realistically. It is also possible and plausible that the real Brockovich, precisely because of her personality (if this performance actually reflects her personality), had the tenacity and fighting spirit to take on such a Goliath as the utility company, and that a more polite and well-integrated person (e.g. Finney) might not have had the ""hutzpah"" to do it. Nevertheless, trying to make an inspirational movie, one that chould be Sunday evening family fare, is defeated by the frequent use of expletives and a generally rude and obnoxious protagonist. I would have preferred a little airbrushing of the lead character's personality, even if it meant fudging on the literal truth.",1000339200,16,3981,5.1804043545878695

Based on a true story, though doubtless with some Hollywood style touch-ups, this is a powerful tale of a bunch of disparate, ordinary individuals, none too aware or confident, fighting against a wealthy corporation that has played havoc with their lives. And the driving force behind this fight is Erin. Julia Roberts plays a scrappy survivor in this movie, loud, foul mouthed, but a fighter all the way. She makes no apologies for her self or her circumstances and manages to rub countless people the wrong way. Down on her luck and nearly out of funds with three kids to support, she bullies a lawyer who let her down into giving her a job (the responsibilities are never clear!). Once at the law office however, she learns in passing of a set of strange events centered around a power company that has been polluting the water supply in a town near its plant, and then suppressing all news of its activities till the statute of limitations can rescue it. Biting in like a bulldog, Erin-Julia hits the ground running, talks to the victims and slowly assembles a case. She has to fight the status quo all the way, be it her own boss (Albert Finney, superb in a well crafted role), his new partner, the power company itself, the legal system and for that matter her personal life. Left behind by her single minded quest, her boyfriend (an unbelievably soft and sensitive Harley Davidson biker!) bails out.

1270110,4,B00003CXFU,"It's sure hard to find any opinions about this movie that aren't knee-jerk. On the one hand, the movie and its hero are attacked by people who don't seem to think corporations can do any wrong. On the other, it's defended by people who seem to think having a Good Heart is all that's necessary to Defend The Environment and the Public Health.

Well, the true story involves _both_ junk science _and_ sleazy corporate practices. And whether or not the ""science"" in the movie is defended by actual scientists (which it isn't), Erin Brockovich was and is a hero.

One hard fact is that hexavalent chromium probably wasn't responsible for all the injuries attributed to it in this film. Yes, it's a carcinogen and it's dangerous when inhaled. But so far as I know, there's no evidence linking it to all the problems detailed in this movie when it's ingested as part of the drinking-water supply. (Not that I'd want to risk it myself, mind you.)

But another, and equally important, hard fact is that Pacific Gas and Electric _did_ screw up big-time. The company knew Cr(VI) was a health hazard, _didn't_ know exactly what the risks were (at that time nobody did -- in fact we still don't), failed to take obvious (and, for better or worse, EPA-mandated) precautions against polluting the local groundwater with the stuff, and then lied to everybody about everything. They were not heroes, and Brockovich did uncover their wrongdoing.

Brockovich, as I said, was and is a hero, and she is well portrayed in this film. I am not ordinarily a fan of Julia Roberts (in fact, frankly, I haven't liked her in anything but _Steel Magnolias_). But she does a nice job here.

The movie, while (I'm told) varying in places from the facts of the actual story, manages to avoid falling into at least _some_ obvious cliches. Far, for example, from portraying a triumph of the ""little guy"" over the big corporate baddies, the film makes clear that the law firm for which Brockovich works _could not have won_ without the aid of a big-corporate-baddie lawyer (Peter Coyote) with both money and toxic-torts experience.

Brockovich doesn't much like this, but it's one of several points on which her knee-jerk, legally inexperienced judgment is simply shown to be wrong. Another is in her initial opposition to binding arbitration, a point handled nicely by Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who is marvelous throughout). And there's another cliche successfully avoided: refreshingly, the fact that Brockovich's ""heart is in the right place"" doesn't magically make her an expert who out-lawyers the lawyers at every turn.

It's probably impossible to avoid comparing this film to _A Civil Action_, which involves a somewhat similar set of facts. But unlike that other movie (which heavily fictionalized Jan Schlichtmann in any event), at bottom this is a character study of Brockovich herself. And, presented ""warts and all,"" she is much more interesting than ideologues in _either_ camp would like to allow.

She is most assuredly a very refreshing movie hero. Sassy, foul-mouthed, and occasionally downright mean (watch, e.g., her nasty comments to Conchatta Ferrell's character), she is also hard-working, (mostly) responsible, and hungry for justice. No cardboard cutout, she's a complicated person with genuine flaws, and Roberts plays her as such.

The real fun is in watching her learn to put her ""flaws"" to work on the side of the good guys. It's a joy to watch her win -- against the usual Hollywood gang of weaselly attorneys (including a condescending Miss Priss who has a hard time believing Brockovich has anything on the ball at all), against PG&E itself, and against the shortcomings that have thus far kept her from success. It's impossible not to like her and root for her.

A satisfying film overall, then (and one that incidentally succeeds in many respects in which the heavy-handed and absolutely pathetic _Pay It Forward_ fails utterly). Many reviewers will probably disagree with me here, but I hope Julia Roberts never goes back to romantic comedies.",994291200,12,4043,4.976296296296296
1270111,5,B00003CXFU,"While ""Erin Brockovich"" follows a similar plot to Jon Travolta's movie from a few years back, ""A Civil Action,"" this movie is more entertaining and better directed.  It's amazing to think that the director, Steven Soderbergh, released Traffic in the same year as this and not many directors since Steven Spielberg in the early 90's (Jurassic Park & Schindler's List in the same year) have produced two attention-grabbers like these in the same year.
Besides the drama involved in the lawsuit against the chemical polluters, one aspect of this movie this is so attractive is it's family feel.  Brockovich, played by Julia Roberts, goes through life as a single mother of three and an interesting boyfriend as she tries to be ""Superwoman"" and save a small town that is slowly dying off from years of groundwater contamination.  A great performance by Roberts and equally impressive performance by Albert Finney as her boss.
The DVD has some interesting extras included.  Like many modern-day DVDs that are based on actual events, there are a few documentaries interviewing the real Erin Brockovich (and her employers) along with stories from the events that actually happened.  (Watch for the sneak cameo of the real Brockovich acting as a waitress to Julia Roberts.) There is a clever short documentary about the filming of the movie included that reveals the director's intentions of making this film as close to the actual historical events as possible. (Which is a miracle in cinema!) Also included in the same documentary are interviews with real-life residents of the polluted town that also filled in as extras at town meetings and other scenes.
The DVD includes a director's commentary and a few other small tidbits.  Not entirely impressive with it's extras included, but it's probably because I'm a little biased in that I feel films as good as this should contain many extras that show the magic behind a masterpiece.  One of the best films in recent years - and definitely not a disappointing purchase.",993168000,6,2012,5.024024024024024

She leads a crusade to help small town people who have suffered needlessly at the hands of a large corporation. She doesn't really have time to fall in love, but she gives it a try. You'll find yourself wanting to open doors for this gutsy lady who dresses like she's about to step out on the corner and solicit herself.

1270123,2,B00003CXFU,"To start with the good, Julia Roberts's performance in this film is deserving of much of the acclaim it has received.  To the degree that her performance is a result of just doing ""whatever Steven Soderbergh told her to do,"" as I heard her claim in an interview, he deserves some credit.  Otherwise this guy seems to be getting WAY too much credit for his film.
As a true story it is interesting that a woman with no prior law training or experience could achieve some of the things that Erin Brockovich apparently did.  And it is very inspirational how she personally knew all the details of all the clients' cases and all their phone numbers by heart, etc.  But these little tidbits are not the stuff of interesting filmmaking.  The story is way too familiar to be of any interest.  There are no surprises, there is no new revelation about corporations or about law or about human nature.  There is hardly any comedy, there is no really gripping drama, this is just a true story.  It could have been a TV movie!  Nothing is cinematically contributed to this story to warrant the jump from TV movie of the week or ""Dateline"" documentary to the big screen.  Is the story inspiring?  I guess so.  Is the movie?  As a movie?  No.  If you want stories of justice and injustice and the middle grounds between, which actually provoke thought into new directions and earn their emotional responses from the audience, look no further than David E. Kelley's brilliant TV show, ""The Practice.""  A half an hour of which is ten times more gripping than Erin Brockovich.
I have the sneaky suspicion that all the acclaim of this film is due to the political value these days on telling stories about evil corporations.  I don't think it really has anything to do with Soderbergh being a genius, because this film gives no evidence he is one, or this film being rousing, because it is not.  It is simply predictable and politically correct.  I do not mean to say that there are no evils contributed to American or global life by corporations, just that this film gains everything from what people expect to feel and want to feel about this familiar villainy and not from what it actually accomplishes in creating something truly insightful.  There are not even any new insights into the nature of corporate villainy where it exists.  This is simply an overrated film.

1270129,4,B00003CXFU,"I did enjoy watching this film.  It's well made, well acted and well edited.  Unfortunately, to some extent it felt like a 'painting-by-numbers' exercise.
EB recounts the unlikely story of an unemployed, divorced mother who talks her way into a clerical job, spots an anomoly in an - apparently minor - real estate deal and goes on to successfully sue a large conglomerate for a record sum.
What is unusual about this film is that story, though unlikely, is based in fact and the film direction largely avoids the usual clichs of painting all the characters as heroes and villians.  In fact, other than a couple of minor characters there are no 'baddies' in the film at all.  The story concentrates more on the efforts of 'little people' to get on with their lives and what happens when they come up against the apparently immovable bulk of a multi-million dollar organization that is damaging their lives.
Albert Finney certainly excels as the lawyer but the casting of Julia Roberts, a major, rich and confident Hollywood star, as EB, a harrased, divorced, poor and unemployed mother, was risky.  It's a credit to her acting ability that she largely manages to carry it off.  It wasn't until I saw the interview with EB (on the DVD) that I realised how well she did.
The DVD contains many deleted scenes, both as filmed and also with a talk-over by the director Steven Sonderberg.  Seeing what he cut out of the film and hearing why is a wonderful insight into the background of both the film and the original (true) story.  It is such extras that really elevate the DVD over the video.

1270130,4,B00003CXFU,"This is a very entertaining, well directed movie with an excellent performance by Albert Finney and a notable one by Julia Roberts who plays the title role of Erin Brockovich. The rest of the cast, likewise, give excellent performances.
The story is a compelling one. A down and out single mother of three young children, Erin Brockovich, gets into an auto accident. Her personal injury suit goes down the tubes, when she alienates the jury with her checkered past and salty language. Angry and desperate, she bullies her lawyer, Ed Masry, disarmingly played by Albert Finney, into hiring her, after he loses her personal injury case. He does so, to the consternation of his other employees. You see, Erin marches to the beat of a different drummer. She dresses like a tramp and talks like a longshoreman.

Which only goes to show you, that one should never judge a book by its cover. Beneath the vulgar exterior, lies a steel trap mind, which Erin put to good use when she goes through a pro bono real estate case, only to discover that there is more to the real estate transaction than meets the eye, a whole lot more. Intrigued by the fact that extensive medical records are included in the real estate transaction paperwork and wondering why that should be, Erin lets her natural curiosity and interest in people prevail. She goes about and investigates the matter.

What she ultimately discovers is that toxic waste is very clearly affecting the quality of life of the inhabitants of the town of Hinckley, California. It appears that the utilities giant Pacific Gas and Electric has been letting highly toxic chromium seep into the ground, affecting the water which the inhabitants of the town use. The utilities giant has compounded the problem by telling the townspeople that they should not worry about a little chromium, despite the high incidence of cancer and other illnesses which abound in Hinckley.

Erin, outraged on behalf of the townspeople, discovers through her research and investigation that Pacific Gas and Electric knew about the toxicity of the Chromium, but continued with business as usual and set about deceiving the unsuspecting townspeople to their ultimate detriment. Eager to right a serious wrong, Erin persuades her employer, small time lawyer, Ed Masry, to take on this big time case. This ultimately leads to one of the largest monetary class action settlements in history.

This is a true life David and Goliath story. Julia Roberts gives a sassy and brassy performance. Albert Finney does his part justice, as the beleagured small practitioner who decides to do the right thing, even though it could end to his detriment. His low key performance is a perfect foil to that of Julia Roberts'. It makes for a film well worth watching.",987120000,9,2768,4.920770877944325

Where Roger Ebert said he kept remembering that she was Julia Roberts and it got in his way, I thought she really lost her ""self"" in the part. I'd have given it the award. I'm glad I bought it.

1270132,5,B00003CXFU,"""Erin Brockovich"" is one of those movies that makes you stand up and cheer. Based on the true story of the real Erin Brockovich's law battle with a major corporation, director Steven Soderbergh and actress Julia Roberts bring the events of the movie to life in an unclichd, refreshing discourse that is a delight on the eyes and both humorous and dramatic. Soderbergh handles the material in his usual way, filming it with new and evoking techniques, and Roberts, scantily clad but immensely intelligent, proves to audiences and the world that she has matured since her days in ""Pretty Woman,"" playing the role with in a strikingly serious manner that anchors the rest of the plot.
As the story begins, Erin is down on her luck, trying to find a well-paying job to support her three kids. After an auto collision leaves her broke with lawyer's fees, she demands that her lawyer, Ed Masry, give her a job in return for losing her case. As she begins working, she discovers some files that seem out of place, and upon further investigation and interviews with several residents of the small town of Hinkley, she uncovers a major coverup involving a major corporation that could mean a major lawsuit that will bring the small firm down or earn it enough money to make a name for itself.
The first thing that must be discussed is the incredible performance from actress Julia Roberts, who brings Erin's character to life in such a way that we find ourselves so moved by her performance as the final credits roll. She brings with her all her old tricks, that sweet charm that makes her one of Hollywood's most valuable stars to date. She is vivacious and and brutal in this role, establishing the fact that Erin is a force to be reckoned with.
The movie establishes the many traits of Erin right from the beginning of the film, introducing us to her as someone who is hard-working and willing to earn her keep. Her willingness to work is also a testament to her strong devotion to her children, whom she must support on her own. She is also fiesty and outspoken, as shown during her court debate when she comes under cross-examination: ""That a**hole smashed in my f***ing neck!"" Erin is strong-willed and a leader in this film, which is a brilliant testament to the real life figure.
Erin is also smart and intelligent when it comes to deciphering the many nuances of the case that falls into her lap. From the beginning, when she first senses something is not right, she knows enough to question certain residents of Hinkley about their involvement with Pacific Gas and Electric, and the reasons for their illnesses and diseases. Not taking anything for an answer other than ""yes,"" she pushes her way through all the barriers to come out on top, all the while surviving the troubles of her own personal life and coming out on top as a real person we can all look up to and admire for their strength and courage.
There is a nice bond that develops between Erin and her boss, Ed Masry, who is hesitant to hire her from the beginning. His pity for her, though, clouds his judgement, and he takes her on, soon realizing that he is in over his head with a lawsuit that could mean the end of his career and his financial security. Their many arguments over this and other things concerning the case are intriguing to watch, some adding light moments of comical humor, others advancing the plot to the next level.
The human emotion and drama of this story and brought to full view in this film, always keeping with the fact that these are real people who experienced these events. Erin's interaction with these characters, and her devotion to their cause as well as her own is inspiring and ambitious. Soon, her cause becomes nothing but concern for their victory, and Roberts brings this change of events to life. Her reactions to changes in the case, things going wrong, and the way in which her character handles them, are all convincing and authentic, and this keeps us involved with the moving story and the developments at hand.
Steven Soderbergh's treatment of this material is brilliant, setting his work high above the mark of good and making this movie one of the best movies of 2000. The way in which he handles Erin's story is one of fluidity and constant plot development, whether it have to do with the lawsuit or with Erin's personal life and her involvement with Ed, who takes care of her children. He is able to combine all of Erin's emotions and balance them against the true story of the people she defends in her pursuit of the truth, which makes us feel for them as well as for the losses she suffers because of her efforts. There are a good deal of shots in the film that give it the look and feel of a typical Soderbergh film, showcasing his use of Steadycam, giving the film a true-to-life perspective which keeps it more involving without putting off the audience.
Alongside the star power of Julia Roberts is a brilliant supporting cast that have their own roles and key parts in the film. Albert Finney plays Ed Masry, Erin's boss and friend, who comes to learn the true value of her work as the movie progresses. He and Roberts have a nice workplace chemistry that gives life to the movie's lawsuit plotline, while also keeping it more touching and emotional. Aaron Eckhart plays George, Erin's next door neighbor and boyfriend, who is given a lot of time onscreen to develop into a terrific supporting character. His moments with the children are moving, establishing him as a father figure, while his relationship with Erin is complicated because of her work, bringing them to a crossroads. Their chemistry is convincing and believable, and provides some nice bits of romance for the movie without taking it under.
In ""Erin Brockovich,"" all the stops are pulled out, and history is given a quite refreshing treatment that is humorous, emotionally moving, and involving all in one package of short skirts and high heels. In reality, Julia Roberts is what makes this movie work, bringing her charisma and charm to the movie with the same intensity and credibility she carries in her previous roles. Stand back, because the Pretty Woman has grown up, and she's back with an attitude and a brain to match it.",985996800,2,6223,4.673655423883318

1270181,5,B00003CXFU,"""Erin Brockovich"" is a wonderful movie! Starring Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, and Aaron Eckhart, it's based on the real-life story of Erin Brockovich, a down-on-her-luck, twice divorced former beauty queen with three young children. Having no post-high school education and few job skills, she has great difficulty finding and holding down a job. Despite her adversities, she displays a fierce grit and determination as she constantly seeks ways to support her family.

Then a seemingly tragic twist of fate puts her on the road to a complete reversal of  luck. After being seriously injured in a car crash, she sues the doctor who hit her. Her antagonistic personality and foul mouth cause her to lose her lawsuit. With bluff and bravado, she persuades  her lawyer, Ed Masry, into giving her a job as a file clerk in his law firm.

Erin finds herself intrigued by one of the cases contained in the files she's putting away. Why are people's medical records included in a simple real estate transaction? She asks Ed if she can look into it. He agrees.  What Erin finds horrifies her. A large electric utility near the small town of Hinkley has been dumping a highly toxic form of chromium into the water. Citizens in Hinkley are contracting various forms of cancer and other gravely debilitating diseases.

The film's main story line tells of Erin and Ed's efforts to persuade Hinkley's citizens to join in a class action lawsuit against the utility.

Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, and Aaron Echhart each  illuminate the screen with their superb performances.  In Roberts' case, it would be easy to focus on her good looks and skimpy wardrobe and slight her acting.  The fact is, though, her acting in this movie is probably her strongest attribute.  Throughout the film, Roberts' character comes off as completely natural, believable, and admirable - if not always likeable. Julia Roberts is certainly deserving of her 2001 Academy Award Best Actress award.

Albert Finney (nominated for Best Spporting Actor) plays the gruff, irascible, hard-working, and totally decent lawyer Ed Masry. Finney's Oscar-worthy performance is certainly the equal of Roberts. The chemistry between Roberts, the star of modern-day female movie stars, and Finney, the grizzled veteran of stage and screen, sparkles.

Aaron Eckhart' s portrayal of George, the biker-turned-boyfriend and live-in baby-sitter is a refreshing change from the typical - and expected - Harley-Davidson rider stereotype. As Eckhart depicts him, George is smart, tender-hearted, probably a bit lazy, possessed with a wanderlust he keeps under control, and a thoroughly decent fellow.

How director Steven Soderbergh managed to keep ""Erin Brockovich"" from becoming another tedious, clich-ridden legal and family drama is intriguing, and is probably one of the key reasons for the movie's tremendous popularity. It would have been easy to turn ""Erin Brockovich"" into a film filled with stereotypical courtroom pyrotechnics; long, idealistic speeches about the ""little guy"" versus corporate America; and characters that are either too easy to hate or too easy to love.

That's pretty much what I expected when I began watching the movie. Instead, I witnessed a film filled with ordinary, decent people... people with faults, to be sure; but all living their lives as best they can. Instead of slick lawyers seeking victory at any cost, there are attorneys zealously representing their clients to the best of their abilities. Instead of hapless, pitiable victims of corporate greed, the townspeople of Hinkley are portrayed as caring, decent, law-abiding citizens whose only concern is the welfare of their families.

What Soderbergh has, in fact, done is present to his audiences a wonderful reflection of American life - the good as well as the bad. At the conclusion of this wonderful film, it's easy for viewers to walk away feeling pretty good... not only about the ultimate outcome of the movie, but also about the fact that we Americans are, for the most part, decent, caring, law-abiding citizens. And that makes ""Erin Brockovich"" a film well worth seeing!",985651200,15,4116,5.194864048338369
1270182,5,B00003CXFU,"""Erin Brockovich,"" directed by Steven Soderbergh, is based on the real-life story of the title character, played in the film by Julia Roberts. Brockovich, a feisty legal clerk, is instrumental in exposing the misdeeds of a powerful corporation which has exposed families to disease-causing industrial residue. As Brockovich and her grouchy-but-loveable boss (wonderfully played by Albert Finney) take on the corporation, the viewer is treated to a rousing ""David versus Goliath"" story.
At the heart of this film's success is the sizzling (but entirely non-sexual) chemistry between Roberts and Finney. They bring great passion and intelligence to their roles, and when they are together, the energy is amazing. Also noteworthy is the fact that although this is a serious drama, the witty script (written by Susannah Grant) is also full of humor. In fact, many of the best scenes from ""Erin"" are firmly in the great tradition of the workplace comedy. Both Roberts and Finney thus deliver not only excellent dramatic performances, but also great comic performances.
The supporting cast is also outstanding. Marg Helgenbeger is particularly affecting as one of the victims of corporate greed and dishonesty.

The case involves possible chromium contamination in the water due to negligence on the part of utilities giant Pacific Gas & Electric.  Erin becomes intrigued by it and through her tireless effort and Masry's support, they ultimately win the case and receive the largest class action settlement in history.  Director Steven Soderbergh takes what could have been into a television movie of the week story and turns it into an intelligent, funny, dramatic and thought provoking film.  Julia Roberts is absolutely magnificent in the title role.  Her wardrobe in the film (pushup bras and tight clothing which are nice) garnered alot of attention, but they are merely a sideshow to the best acting job of her career.  She makes us feel for the situation Erin is in and through her compassion for the people of Hinckley, we too become involved and concerned for them as well.  Albert Finney contributes his usual first rate acting to the role of Ed Masry.  He perfectly plays off Ms. Roberts, absorbing the rants and abuse she heaps on him and then returning the favor with a few zingers of his own.  Aaron Eckert plays Erin's boyfriend George with the right amount caring and support that gets tested throughout the film.

Julia Roberts turns in a powerhouse performance as Erin Brockovich who uses her quick wit, perseverance and aggression to fuel her drive not only to wheedle her way into a job for which she is not at once qualified but uses it even more convincingly when she investigates the case for which she is well known and around which this script is built. A compelling story of a regular person who uses what skills and assets she does have to discover a cover-up and to get compensation for those whose lives were adversely affected or altogether destroyed by the information covered up.

Score: 85/100
Wow, what a surprise. We didn't really see this one coming. Mostly with names like Erin Brockovich or Joan of Arc, you'd expect there was going to be some kind of war hero who dies in the end and has never been noticed before. But, in Erin Brockovich, it focuses on a classy new kind of hero that brings a small town to it's feet and huge business to it's knees.
Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an unemployed single mother desperate find a job but is having no luck. This losing streak even extends to a failed lawsuit against a doctor in a car accident she was in. With no alternative, she successfully browbeats her lawyer to give her a job in compensation for the loss. While no one takes her seriously with her trashy clothes and earthy manners, that soon changes when she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Co.. What she discovers is that the company is trying to quietly to buy land that was contaminated by hexavalent chromium, a deadly toxic waste that the company is improperly and illegally dumping and in turn poisoning the residents in the area. As she digs deeper, Erin finds herself leading point in a series of events that would involve her lawfirm in one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against a multi-billion dollar corporation
In Erin Brockovich, you can no longer expect the romantic-comedy type of Julia Roberts. Here, she shines in her role as Erin, a feisty and determined single mom with a plan. It's the first movie in which Roberts really deserves the `career-best' nod, and it will be a movie that she will be remembered for in the future. She is well supported by Albert Finney who handles Ed Masry's anger and happiness perfectly. There is also Aaron Eckhart, who stars as Erin's love interest, to keep us occupied and he is cast nicely and has promise for future roles. Hats off to director Steven Soderbergh (nominated for Best Director twice this year!) and Susannah Grant, who put mindblowing effort into this great picture.

1270187,4,B00003CXFU,"Like many other reviewers,I have been oblivious to the star power of Julia Roberts. I've always found her bland, and her one attempt at off-beat casting ""Mary Reilly"" was disasterous. But in ""Erin Brockovich"" she has found a character who is not a grinny Girl Scout, but on the other hand seems to fit Ms Roberts' persona. Erin Brockovich is a loose cannon whose worst enemy is her own mouth, but underneath the bluster (not to mention the Frederick's of Fresno wardrobe) is an impulsive woman with a brain and a warm sympathy for others. Ms Roberts handles the role well, using her natural charm and vitality to complete the character. (And I'm sure it helped to have a strong director Steven Soderbergh controlling the  character's in-your-face crusading spirit.) Her co-star is Albert Finney, who is remarkable as Erin's lawyer-boss -- an American, of course. Who would believe that Finney was born in England and attended RADA? (Incidently, that 18th Century stud muffin Tom Jones in unrecognizable here.) They get hefty support, especially from Aaron Eckhart as Erin's boyfriend, a down-to-Earth biker who isn't ashamed to play with kids or wear reading glasses. Marg Helgenberger is touching as a woman whose life is threatened by an irresponsible bureaucracy, and Conchata Farrell is always fun in any small role she plays. As another litigant in the lawsuit Erin is involved in, Cherry Jones has yet to display on screen that wattage that has electrified New York. Susannah Grant's screenplay manages to miss most (though not all) the clichs of let's-buck-the-system stories; and the musical score (thank God!) is laid back, avoiding any soaring feel-good excesses.

Julia Roberts is outstanding in portraying one of the most strong-willed and determined but caring and loving persons God has created. An oscar for Julia and a standing ovalation for Erin.

I'm very glad that the REAL Erin dressed the way she did.  Julia Roberts is able to show off her ""stuff"" (trying to keep this review family-friendly); although it's a little distracting.  That's the sort of distractions I like!
Erin Brockovich follows a story line of ""small guy conquearing big guy"".  This true story is reminicent of other good movies we've seen:  SILKWOOD, ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, CHINATOWN...others?  A factory (part of a billion dollar company) poisons the water of a small town and tries to use devious tactics to get out of paying for their mistake.  It has moments that will make you want to cheer for the players on screen-especially Erin as she simply says what she feels.  Roberts and Finney are an excellent NON-STEREOTYPICAL pair and both deserve Oscars.  And here in my state (where Julia is from) we are proud of our pretty ""Georgia Girl""!",984441600,3,890,4.809210526315789
1270229,5,B00003CXFU,"If not necessarily Best Picture.
First I have to state that there is probably no one who is less of a Julia Roberts fan than I.  Her acting talents to me have always seemed pretty run of the mill.  And she can occasionally appear to be stunningly beautiful at most times she appears remarkably average.  So i've never understood the hype
We are treated here to an extraordinary performance.  She brings genuine honesty to the role.  I would highly recommend that you read the review of 'RESOLUTE' which I found to be particularly poignant and accurate.  To RESOLUTE: I wish that you would include your email and that you would write more reviews because you really seem to know your stuff ie: Independence Day
What I enjoyed most about this film is that the story and the performances carried the day rather than production tricks and hype.  In short the movie is very low key.  It's understated in it's visuals and drama.  The viewer is not forced to like or dislike (the character) Erin Brockavich although she is certainly a sympathetic presence as are Albert Finney and the victims of the dumping.
In short I did not expect to like this film and viewed it with reluctance but was treated to a real gem of a film and all involved are to be commended.  It's got all of the elements a great story, well acted, enough laughs and plenty of drama plus ultimately vindication.

""My Best Friends Wedding"" was sweet but this movie will remain in people's heart and mind for a long time.  She has put all her looks aside and created a masterpiece of the chracter.

1270232,4,B00003CXFU,"There is something about true stories that make for better films.  Add in a good cast and good acting, and you have a decent movie.
Julia Roberts plays Erin Brockovich, a broke, out-of-work single mother who pushes herself into a clerical job at a law firm that previously lost her ""can't lose"" automobile accident court case.  While there, she discovers a power company that poisons the water making several citizens in the surrounding town fatally ill.  Roberts and her boss, played by Albert Finney, set off to take down this power company, and bring justice and a large settlement to the citizens of Hinkley, California.
The acting was superb in the film.  Roberts did a wonderful job in the title role, and her timing in the dialogue was pretty dead-on perfect.  Albert Finney was also quite masterful in his role, and his straight-man attitude was the best complement to Roberts.  Aaron Eckhart added in a stellar performance as the motorcycle-driving neighbor, George, who eventually falls in love with Erin.
The movie flowed along quite nicely, and the storyline was well-drawn out.  All of the character-development was done well also, allowing the audience to relate to the people on screen.  This film was nicely done, and is sure not to let you down.  It is a worthy effort.",983577600,3,1286,4.889400921658986

There are different meanings about this film, and I can understand that because of the language and that it is based on a true story. But why can't you just admit that there are good and fantastic films even don't YOU like them...!

1270234,4,B00003CXFU,"When Erin Brockovich originally came out, I was suspicious.  It seemed like a calculated move by Julia Roberts, Inc., to buy into the character market, the Norma Rae/Silkwood real estate. I thought it would be a star turn.  Roberts and the film are much better than that.  The filmmakers made some excellent choices in rendering the true story of a California legal office clerk who uncovers a ulitity's cover-up of an environmental disaster that has caused widespread health problems in a small town.  They have opted for realism, and have chosen to emphasize the entertaining ironies in Brockovich's character.  Roberts wears the role well and has let go of some trademark mannerisms.  Albert Finney, playing the lawyer for whom Brockovich works, is remarkable and deserves more attention than he's gotten.  The director wisely abandons the hand-held camera early enough, before it becomes annoying. The film slyly comments on legal culture when it puts Finney and Roberts' roll-up-the-sleeves characters in a room with the stiffly attired and mannered upscale corporate lawyers.  I suppose some people should be warned that the dialogue makes frequent use of those words that can't be broadcast on network television; but people I know who are usually offended by such liked this film because it has a humor and charm that pick it up off the ground.",983318400,,1352,5.113636363636363
1270235,3,B00003CXFU,"""Erin Brockovich"" is one of the three films nominated for Oscars that i have seen, and I don't see this one taking home the statue. Okay, so it was a true story, that doesn't make it a great film.  I guess my expectations were too high as I had heard that it was a great film.  Julia Roberts was good as the title character, but I had no sympathy for her.  It seemed as if as soon as Erin had a real job and was out trying to get PG&E, her family seemed to not matter much to her.  This is just what I got from what I saw on film.  I am just very surprised at the academy this year, for including this film in it's nominations.  In my own personal opinion, I don't think it is deservant of it.  Nor does Julia Roberts deserve a Best Actress Nod.  There was nothing stunning or awesome about her performance.  It was decent. The movie is worth a rental fee, but i wouldn't buy it.",983059200,3,879,4.005747126436781
1270236,5,B00003CXFU,"Okay, language issues aside, Julia Roberts SHINES as the real-life Erin Brockovich, a dogged, unabashed crusader for justice.
Erin accidentally finds out that several hundred unsuspecting residents of Hinkley, California are dead or dying from poisoned water that has exceedingly high levels of toxic chromium.
This is a touching story that reminds me a lot of Sally Field's performance in Norma Rae. It's about a grass-roots effort to right a very terrible wrong, and the investigative techniques used by Erin will floor you with their sheer simplicity. It's not what she does, rather it's HOW she does what she does that makes a difference. Erin is not equipped professionally to take on this insurmountable task, but she refuses to let that stop her from trying. She's what I would call ""ignorance on fire"", but she's also smart as a whip.
What I love most about this movie is how Roberts character gets results when others can't. She may not be the most professional (this movie is cleavage city!), or meekest person you'll ever meet (her boss says she could use a good dose of ""charm school"" - he's right!) but she has a way with people. True, her wardrobe doesn't hurt in her getting her way so often (especially with men), but it's her honest compassion for these victims that makes the movie work.
Erin Brockovich teaches all of us a lesson in true leadership, persistence against all odds, and how to motivate people. These victims TRUST her because they know she really CARES, That's the real lesson here, and that's why she is so successful in getting them to do something they would never have done without her.
This movie is a real gem. You will learn a lot about purpose, passion, corruption, romance, and how to deal with people so that they respond. And you'll also learn that door-to-door selling is NOT antiquated!
Highly recommended.

1270256,3,B00003CXFU,"I wasn't expecting alot from this movie, even though it is nominated for Best Picture. I was pleasently suprised. When I rent movies, I tend to watch them while I am doing something else. This movie held my attention the whole time. Of course, I do enjoy real-life dramas. I found this one to be very well done. Stephen Soderbergh is amazing. I found Out of Sight and Traffic to be better, but I was really impressed with this movie. I'll admit Julia Roberts was good, but not great. I prefer actors who make me forget the actor and believe in the character they are playing. I couldn't forget that it was Julia Roberts. So, she played somewhat out of character. But, all she really did was show some skin and swear. Yes, she was good, but Oscar worthy? I don't think so.

1270257,4,B00003CXFU,"This movie may have changed my opinion of Julia Roberts.  I have never like her acting, and the media's portrayal of her as some sort of beauty queen in the 80's (and she has never been a very attractive woman) only made it worse.  But she did an excellent job in this story, seemingly portraying the real Erin Brockovich with perfection.
Great story, maybe a little hard to believe though if you didn't know it was true.  But everything was very well done.  All the characters were good.  One bad thing is that they seem to have cut some scenes out to speed it up?  Some of the scene transitions were downright bizarre and there was no logic behind.  But other than that, no real complaints.
One thing I'd like to point out to people before they watch this is that Erin Brockovich is not a very likable person.  She's profane, crude, obnoxious, rude, and treats everyone around her, especially those who are better educated, like garbage.  She always had trouble finding and keeping a job and she always blamed it on her lack of education and experience.  That wasn't it.  It was her attitude.",982540800,,1094,4.558974358974359
1270258,5,B00003CXFU,"In her dozen or so years in show business, Julia Roberts has played many roles.  A hooker, a movie star, a step mom, and Tinkerbell are among a handful of Roberts' roles in the past decade.  And in that time Julia Roberts has become ""America's Darling"" and one of the most recognizable (and highest paid) actresses in the history of cinema.  Yet, she has never clutched an Oscar in all those years.  So, to say that her Oscar-nominated performance in Erin Brockovich is well deserved would be a tragic understatement.  Roberts takes on the roll of a double divorcee-single mother of three struggling to earn enough money to get by.  Playing Brockovich is easily the most challenging role of Roberts' illustrious career.  But it was also, in turn, the greatest performance of her career.  What makes this a standout role for Roberts is the fact that she has built up that ""squeaky-clean"" image over the course of her career.  She almost always played the role of the vixen, or the damsel in her most memorable movies.  But now, she plays a foul-mouthed, and cunning ex-beauty queen... a far cry from Tinkerbell indeed.  And Julia Roberts stood and delivered the entire length of the movie.  However, Roberts is not the only one to make the movie as great as it is.  Steven Soderbergh's directing job is flawless in this film.  He helped create a movie based on a true story that is, in fact, very believable, humorous, witty, clever, and moving all at the same time.  Erin Brockovich could very well be the best film of the year.  It is certainly well rounded in terms of production.  Great casting.  Great direction. Great Acting.  Great Writing.  Great Film.  And so on Oscar night... Julia Roberts may finally get the recognition she deserves.",982368000,,1745,4.75

1270261,5,B00003CXFU,"Julia Roberts stars as an unrelentingly tactless, thoroughly tasteless, charm-school dropout twice divorced, the mother of three who dresses like a Las Vegas whore.  We love her.  She is a woman who's been disappointed a time or two and generally expects the worst, and when she doesn't get it, she's surprised.  She is her own worst enemy with a foul mouth and a skanky style and a chip on her shoulder.  She is also very smart and incredibly strong and knows right from wrong (and that's the chip on her other shoulder).  We love her.
Stir in Richard Gere or Tom Cruise (no, he's too short)...  How about...no, no, NO.  Give her someone near her equal.  How about a real actor twice her age?  How about Albert Finney (whom I first saw in the delightful Tom Jones (1963))?  Together they play it like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy without the romance.  Not only does it work, it's a triumph.  Finney really is brilliant.  His timing is exquisite as is his ability to round his character.  Did you catch the shot of him with the one eye comically magnified through his glasses?  For love interest give her a bandana-wearing biker whom she turns into a house husband to take care of her kids while she takes on Pacific Gas and Electric (market cap = $28-billion).  For the first time in her life she is doing something important.  For the first time in her life people respect her.  There's something wonderful about this because even without an education people can see, and she can know, that she's their equal and maybe a bit more.
Aaron Eckhart, lately seen as the sociopathic Chad in the startlingly original In the Company of Men (1997) plays the biker house husband with fidelity and a kind of sappy warmth.  She neglects him and her kids for her obsession.  Susannah Grant, who penned the very clever script must have gotten a good laugh with this unusual household, the poor, stay at home neglected husband, the always on the road wife.  Incidentally, don't miss the scene where he first kisses her.  It was so real all I could think was this guy is kissing Julia Roberts!  She is so powerfully expressive that everything she does is real.  That's her gift.
A significant part of the success of Erin Brockovich of course is in the compelling (and substantially true) story of David versus Goliath (""and all his relatives,"" as Finney quips), of good versus evil, of the ""little guy"" versus the corporate behemoth.  I won't be giving away anything by telling you that there's a happy ending.  But this is also a triumph for Director Steven Soderbergh who can now add a box office success to critical acclaim.  I haven't seen any of his latest movies,  (I'm looking forward to seeing Traffic), but I recall with pleasure the very interesting Sex, Lies, & Videotape from 1989.  I am also looking forward to the Academy Awards presentations because I suspect the Academy is going to reward both Julia Roberts and Soderbergh by making Erin Brockovich the Best Picture of the year 2000.",981417600,,2993,4.680076628352491

This movie offers nothing more than a few profanity laced diatribes, Roberts in clothes that are so tight you almost wonder if the director is poking fun at the real woman being portrayed.

Anyway, once I had gotten over the way Julia swore and dressed, I really enjoyed it, even though the end was kind of predictable. But even so it is still very riveting.

1270333,4,B00003CXFU,"When a single mother obtains clerical work at a local law firm, her curiosity concerning a relatively mundane real estate deal prompts her investigation into what ultimately uncovers egregious misdeeds by the local energy company.
The inevitable problem with any film based on real-life events is the relative lack of suspense and surprises for viewers familiar with the story. We know that Karen Silkwood is going to die under suspicious circumstances at the end of Silkwood and we know that the tobacco companies are going to pay at the end of The Insider. And since we saw Erin herself being interviewed on all of the major news programs when this film was released, we know that she is not going to be run off the road to be kept quiet. On the contrary, we're aware that she's going to help win a major case against a huge company. But this doesn't mean that these films still can't be amazingly entertaining.
Despite these disadvantages, Brockovich's tale provides for one of the most engrossing films of the year due to the very entertaining script by Susannah Grant, the skill with which Steven Soderbergh unfolds the tale (the audience comes to sympathize completely with Erin whose character is in nearly every scene), and the terrific performance by Julia Roberts (sure to be nominated for an Oscar). And though Roberts dominates the entire film, Albert Finney offers some excellent support as her curmudgeon boss and Aaron Eckhart is fine as her sympathetic though neglected boyfriend.

What I would recommend, if you don't understand legal systems is to read about the case first which this film tells of. Julia Roberts is a real looker in this as single mother Erin Brockovich, who is out of work and involved in a car accident. When the devious lawyer defending the driver who struck her causes her to lose her compensation claim, she ends up working for her defending lawyer - Ed Masry - who is expertly played by Albert Finney. When she is researching a real estate claim she finds some shocking medical reports and discovers that a massive public utility - PG&E - has been dumping toxic hexavalent chromium into the groundwater - cost-cutting can be dangerous! Through her own determination she finds her purpose in life - helping people - and with the help of MAsry, who feels a bit intimidated and harried by Erin at first - they struggle to bring justice to those families who were affected by the chromium poisoning. This is based on a true story and it is pretty scary to think that the poisoning had been going on over several years. The DVD package is superb as well - interview with the real Erin, the deleted scenes(I'm sure a couple were in the UK cinema release) and a host of other features. I'm really glad I gave this movie a second chance - having been made up recently into a health and safety officer/manager at work overseeing procedures with chemical disposal, it certainly strikes a chord - we use material far more lethal than chromium.

Erin the character is awesome.  She is not a person of status, she isn't rich, she isn't even very nice, but she has attitude and determination and guts and leaves you no choice but to respect her.
She always has some kind of smart comeback to say whenever someone ways something she doesn't agree with.  When she argues, just the right words seem to spew from her mouth, especially when arguing with the lawyer. When her oddly passive biker next-door neighbor tried to hit on her she quickly spat the less-than-desirable details of her messed-up life.  Her comments are always abrasive and hilarious, and Julia Roberts does an excellent job portraying her.
The actor who played the lawyer (his name I do not know) also did a great job.  He grated on your nerves; at times I just wanted to slap him, but that was his role and he played it well.
This movie has an actual plot and a great ending.  It's even based on a true story!  It is great.  See it.",977356800,,1491,4.526119402985074

Julia was superb in the movie - no question about it. She's always great - but this isn't the sweet role she usually plays. I think I heard someone compare her performance to Sally Field in Norma Rae, and I'd second that. She, as Field often does, nails the hard, rough exterior that holds back a tender, caring inside. Roberts is truly excellent in this movie - funny, quick, strong... just brilliant. Albert Finney is excellent as her 'sidekick' in this one - watching them together is truly a joy. You can see in their eyes they're enjoying their jobs, and I swear there were a few times when I caught Finney laughing, almost shocked about Roberts' performance. Regardless, it was an incredible duo. This kind of age difference is hard to accomplish, (see Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery in Entrapment) - but this one works well.
The script is also great - although there are many points when you can feel the fact the writers were trying to squeeze too much in. But - it does it well. John Travolta starred in A Civil Action, a very similar movie, but one which I was ready to leave after a half an hour - Brockovich, despite running about the same time, seems to go by much quicker.
Overall - you gotta see this movie. Julia Roberts stakes her claim as the (2nd) Best Actress in Hollywood. (sorry julia - i'm still giving best to Angelina Jolie :)",976579200,2,1445,4.498098859315589

Erin Brockovich works for this law firm, but her position in it is really low because she doesn't have a law education and not much of an education in most things. What she has is spunk and one day while she was filing something she found this estate plan with doctor notes in it. Erin became curious and she began to dig around. She discovered that the water in some people's home was contaminated and they had all these diseases and serious nosebleeds and other things. She then goes around trying to get information with her boss, the lawyer. They're trying to prove that the water company is wrong and to make them pay.
I think this is really a good movie. The thing that makes it so good is that this was based on a true story. This movie involves a little bit of everything. There's a little humor in it and some other things. I wonder if this movie has received any reward because it should.

She deserves an Oscar nod for this rousing movie, which only sporadically becomes a Hollywood-ish version of the truth.  The story, mostly true, is richly compelling, as are the characters of Erin, Ed (her boss, deftly played by an older, jollier Albert Finney) and George (Erin's too-good-to-be-true biker boyfriend, who is dashingly handsome beneath the ponytail).  For all of her alarmingly, and entertainingly over the top costumes, Julia's personal beauty has never radiated with as many layers as it does in this terrific story of a ""nobody"" who has the guts, determination, pride and smarts to take on the Establishment in a big way.

1270451,1,B00003CXFU,"Ok, so maybe I just don't get it.  I guess that I'm in the extreme minority here -- but I didn't much care for the movie ""Erin Brockovich"".  I didn't find Brockovich to be an admirable person, much less a hero, and I have grave disappointments concerning the fidelity of the movie to actual events.
Item:  Repeatedly throughout the movie, Ms. Brockovich is portrayed as ""doing this for her children"" or some similar line.  Yet her home life was chaotic at best, her relationship with her kids was awful, and her relationship with her boyfriend (who actually DID seem to care for the kids) was also unimpressive.  (She has since dumped him.)
Item:  The movie played fast and loose with the actual facts of the matter.  In the months since the movie's release, numerous syndicated columnists have demonstrated scientific inaccuracies, fiscal irregularities as far as payments to ""victims"", exorbident attorney's fees, etc.
Item:  The heroic attorney figure has, in real life, not tended toward the highest examples of the ethics of his profession.  He was a religious cult lawyer, an attorney FOR polluters, and was a convicted felon.
Item:  In real life, many residents of Hinckly are terribly bitter toward Brockovich.
It's politically correct, nowadays, to bash large corporations as intrinsically evil.  For that matter, it's also politically correct to promote ""single mother makes good"" themes.  But the real facts of the story show that the movie heros aren't at all what they seem.

In a script that seems tailor-made for her, Julia Roberts makes the most out of being witty, quirky and beautiful. That this is based on a true-story is typically grounds for me to start groaning.  Still, it had Roberts in skimpy clothing...so I bit.  I'm glad I did.  Albert Finney is a definite supporting Oscar favorite at this point and Julia should have a lock on a nomination as well (and should win the Globe for best comedic).  The witty repartee between these two alone makes Brockovich a worthy film, but add in across-the-board solid acting by the rest of the supporting cast (including my favorite underused film actress, Cherry Jones) and you have a delightful film that should be the highlight of any dinner party you throw at home.",970012800,,917,4.729559748427673
1270453,4,B00003CXFU,"Erin Brockovich is such a wonderful movie, I really didn't find myself caring too much that it wasn't all that suprising.  But while the story may be more than a little predictable for anyone who's ever seen, well, anything -- it's also a pretty great movie, is terrifically directed by Soderbergh, and is fueled by a wonderful, sassy, and complex performance by Julia Roberts.  The DVD is a must, and offers some great extras as narrated by Soderbergh, as well as interviews with the real Brockovich, and a look at an alternate (and completely factual) storyline which was ultimately edited out from the film, and which shows that, for once, Hollywood actually toned DOWN the real events for their translation to film.
My favorite things about ""Brockovich"" were the little touches -- the realistic look at the life of a struggling single mother who's this close to screaming in frustration, the wonderful supporting characters, and the way the wardrobe really seemed to provide Roberts with a completely new character than any other we've seen her play.  Erin is loud, sassy, foul-mouthed, impatient, and rude.  She's also a heck of a lot smarter and more compassionate than she lets on, and takes us on a great ride.  Albert Finney is also equally wonderful as Erin's surprisingly caring boss -- there's a priceless scene where she gets him to let his hair down and do a little screaming, and Finney is just wonderful in it.
Erin Brockovich is a great movie, a movie that redefines what the phrase crowd-pleaser is really supposed to mean.  Sure, ""A Civil Action,"" (which details a remarkably similar story) may be more pretentious, more ""serious,"" even more surprising -- but I'd take a dozen Erin Brockoviches over ""Civil Action"" any day.",970012800,3,1742,4.908163265306122

1270510,5,B00003CXFU,"As a Julia Roberts fan, first I'm biased.  However, there was a good story  here and though I think Julia Roberts was great for the part, another  equally skilled actress could have done as well.
The acting was wonderful  by all, including that by Albert Finney that played her bumbling lawyer  boss; Ed Masry.  The character he played was a smart man, but was not  skilled in speaking.  A scary thought for an attorney.
As with many  others, I did find Julia Roberts outfits overly provocative, but if they  were in character, then they were appropriate.  However, what I did fault  with is the endless variety and quality of these outfits.  If she was  single mom with two kids and struggling to eat, her wardrobe never  reflected it.  All of her clothes appeared expensive and worn once.  The  wardrobe person should be faulted here and the director for not adhering to  reality.
The story is one of this woman's brashness in resolving her and  others problems.  Erin Brockovich, went to Ed Masry to obtain a settlement  for an injury obtained in a car accident.  He assured her of their success.  Unfortunately, through his bumbling and her appearance and attitude which  did not endear her to the judge, she lost the case.
She approached this  attorney shortly after winning the case, for a job, since he had done her  no favors in the courtroom and he grudgingly gave her one much to the  consternation of the rest of his staff.
Later on she noted some  oddities in one of his files and asked to pursue the lead.  He  absentmindedly told her it was okay.  However, after a week of absence due  to researching this, he fired her.  His staff was openly pleased and she  left in a huff.
Later, when calls started to come in that her research  initiated, her former boss came to her for more information.  Recognizing a  golden opportunity she negotiated for her job back at a better rate with  benefits!
Shortly after returning to work she met her next door  neighbor that was soon to become her babysitter and eventually her love  interest.  This resulted in some bedroom scenes were she gave some of her  background and you could understand some of what drives her.  George her  boyfriend/babysitter played back fiddle to her job through most of the  movie and winds up leaving because of this.  You can really see the pull of  both.
As time went on she pieced together the whole sordid story of what  went on.  Once the corporate bigwigs got hold of this she received some  threats and leads started to dry up.
As a small law firm, they  struggled with the manpower to support and try such a large case.  They  opt to get a partner with more experience to help them.  Here Erin feels  really pushed out.  She struggles against the bias over both her lack of  education besides her trashy dress.
In the end they triumphed.  This  isn't quite so simple there are a lot of twists and turns and details, all  well done.
Not knowing the personality of the real Erin Brockovich, I  don't know if Julia Roberts portrayed her accurately or not.  However  there is a lesson learned here as well.  If you choose a path you know to  have biases, dressing trashy, working in a field that you have no  qualifications for, you wind up aways fighting to prove you can do the job.  Human nature is that it wants homogeneity.  You have to fit, otherwise your  differences are something you have to add to that hill you have to climb  over every day.  Erin Brockovich chose that battle and triumphed.  I'm  not sure the battles (the trashy dress) were worth the fight, but it's not  my life.
The other message here that in today's age, education is  merely a more formal doorway for various jobs.  If employers limit  themselves to only candidates with the right educational background despite  a job candidate's obvious ability, they may be shorting themselves.  So  much of many jobs are on the job knowledge and drive.  Erin Brockovich is a  good example of that.",968025600,,3954,4.595375722543353
1270511,5,B00003CXFU,"A tenacious file clerk for a small law firm, curious about some information included in the file of a pro bono case, purses it and  ultimately becomes a major player in a huge lawsuit involving hundreds of  people in ""Erin Brockovich,"" a movie based on actual events, directed by  Steven Soderbergh.  When Erin (Julia Roberts) questions why medical records  are included in the file of a simple real estate transaction between a  public utilities company and some homeowners in the town of Hinckley,  California, she uncovers information that PG&E may have been  responsible for water pollution that may have caused widespread illness and  even death among the citizens of Hinckley.  But truth is one thing, and  having the resources to fight a company worth billions of dollars is  another.  And that's the problem that falls into the lap of lawyer Ed Masry  (Albert Finney), owner of the law firm that employs Brockovich.  Millions  of dollars, as well as justice for those who have been harmed is at stake,  but it's a case of David versus Goliath, and Masry has reservations as to  whether or not he is up to the task; the meager resources of his firm will  only go so far, while the utility could tie them up in court for years and  not feel a thing.  Masry, however, has something else to consider:  Erin  Brockovich, who has latched on to this case harder than a pit bull on a  mailman's trousers.  Julia Roberts gives one of the best performances  of her career in this film, as the sassy, brazen Brockovich, who tells it  like it is and won't take ""no"" for an answer.  She captures ever grain of  realism in bringing Erin's story to life; this woman who was down on her  luck, but refused to give in to circumstances that overwhelmingly stacked  the odds against her.  She perfectly conveys the sense of frustration felt  by this single mother of three who, unemployed, and with no help or  prospects in sight, simply would not quit on her own life or let her  children down.  It's a gritty, charismatic performance with a depth that  aptly demonstrates what kind of person Brockovich really is; not a portrait  of a superwoman or a story made up of overblown, feigned heroics, but of a  self-assured, very real person with too much pride and integrity to turn  away from the truth and people in need.  Albert Finney is also outstanding  as Masry, the honest, hard working lawyer who finds his horizons somewhat  expanded by Erin's zeal.  He's something of a decent, regular guy with a  good marriage, small but successful practice and diabetes.  And Finney  brings him to life with a performance that should get him an Oscar  nomination at the very least.  It's tough taking the part of an average Joe  and making him memorable, and it's a credit to Finney's ability as an actor  that he succeeds so well in doing so.  The solid supporting cast  includes Aaron Eckhart, exemplary in his role of George, the man in Erin's  life; Marg Helgenberger (Donna Jensen); Cherry Jones (Pamela Duncan); Peter  Coyote (Kurt Potter); and Conchata Ferrell (Brenda).  One of the best  movies of the year, ""Erin Brockovich"" is a well made, absorbing and  entertaining drama, well directed and superbly acted, especially by Roberts  and Finney; it's theme of the underdog fighting for justice has a universal  appeal that will get the adrenaline pumping and engage you emotionally.  It's a great story, with Julia Roberts at her very best.  This is one you  do not want to miss.",967939200,,3471,4.729411764705882
1270512,5,B00003CXFU,"Many reviewers will compare Julia Roberts's performance to her more popular films, but stating that this is her best film since ""Pretty  Woman"" would gloss over how unique a film experience ""Erin  Brockovich"" (DVD) is. Having never been a fan of Roberts, I avoided  the theatrical release only to be extraordinarily surprised upon seeing it  by how well she served the role. Roberts delivers her usual charisma, but  also brings an unexpectedly believeable balance of strength and tenderness.  Brockovich is a broke single mother who achieved a sort of excellence out  of desperation, hunger, and necessity. Roberts's Brockovich is an admirably  flawed and driven woman who bludgeons men with her bravado and sexuality  without any false neo-feminism nor teary-eyed victimhood so obligatory in  female lead roles.
Brockovich is real, fighting the ""big  polluter"", yet director Soderberg manages to give the viewer all they  need to have genuine empathy for Brockovich without preaching the virtue of  the small town and the single mother versus the implacable corporate  entity. No, forget the movie-of-the-week conventions. Similar to ""A  Civil Action"", EB is character driven from Finney's reluctant boss,  the chameleon-like Aaron Eckhart's long suffering boyfriend to Marg  Hegenberger's horrified realization at the swimming pool. This film depicts  how the law works for real people without boring courtroom drama.
The DVD  does not contain flashy special effects, but its many outtake scenes and  commentary add depth to the characters. Viewing the extra scenes lends a  greater appreciation for the real life Brockovich's determination,  Roberts's delivery (alternately understated and explosive), and director  Soderberg's commentary on editing choices.

1270515,4,B00003CXFU,"As is so often the case with a film based on a real person, this film continues to be at the center of controversy. I have no idea how  ""true"" its screenplay is and now comment on the film itself.  First off, I think Roberts's acting is solid but hardly worthy of the  lavish praise it has received. True, it's hard not to notice her but she is  hardly in the same league with Field and Streep who portrayed similar  characters. Albeit less photgenic and certainly less energetic, Albert  Finney (as Ed Masry) does much the better job. Given the tragic and  potentially tragic circumstances presented in the film, I expected them to  be the primary source of tension rather than whether or not Erin will get a  job, win the lawsuit after the automobile accident, etc. As is, the film's  priorities seem to suggest that Erin's sense of self-worth is more  important than a cancer which has killed or will kill less glamorous folk.  I enjoyed the movie. I wish I could admire it more.",967766400,,982,4.517045454545454
1270516,3,B00003CXFU,"I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie - Groundbreaking cinema, no.  I thought that the story was engaging, made incredible by the fact that it  was based on actual facts.  I have to say that Ms. Brockovich earned every  dollar of that bonus - what should have been a routine pro bono job was  revealed to be a horrible corporate cover-up.  This said, I don't think  this film will be remembered much two years down the line.
Julia  Roberts gives a Julia Roberts performance.  While this was adequate, I  never felt any sense of desperation in her character, even when she was  down to 3 hungry children and $76 in the bank, with no job prospects in  sight.  I think of Holly Hunter's performance in The Firm as the  short-skirted secretary/accomplice of Tom Cruise's Mitch character and how  she oozed that sense of white trash.  Ms. Roberts ALWAYS exuded a sense of  self-confidence.  I know that much was made of the provocative clothing  when this film was released.  That didn't bother me, but what did was the  fact that her entire wardrobe (all 25 changes or so?) seemed to come from  Richard Gere's Gold Card shopping spree on Rodeo Drive.  She just never  looked as poor and desperate as the film would have the viewer believe.  She always wore what appeared to be designer clothes (with matching shoes,  of course).  I also thought that some development as to what led to her  second divorce would have helped (yes, she was brash to the point of  obnoxious).  That divorce must have occurred while she was pregnant, or  shortly after the birth of the baby.  Why didn't he pay child  support?
These minor complaints aside, this was, as others have noted,  what Civil Action should have been.  The denouement was worth the wait - a  satisfying ending to the ordeal endured by the victims of PG&E.",967680000,2,1807,4.6075949367088604
1270517,5,B00003CXFU,"What was the last film I seen with Julia Roberts in? Ah, Runaway Bride, another Romanic comedy, and Notting Hill before that, same genre. So what  on earth is she doing in a true-life drama? A lot actually......... I have  to admit, I am a bit of a Julia Roberts fan, but never in my life did I  expect she is this good. No, good is not the right word; Oscar worthy only  comes close. That might make me a bit biased towards her but even the  cynics cannot denied that she has broken her ""pretty woman"" mould  and become a true character actor, besides Julia Roberts, her co-star  Albert Finney is also excellent as Ed Masery, he almost steels the show  with his subtle and convincing portrayal of Erin's boss and friend.
As I  said and you probably know, this film is based on a true-life story about a  woman with no skills who found out something weird is going on and sued a  multi-billion-corporation company and won the largest lawsuit payout in  American history. So what makes this film differ from other  ""true-life-dramas""? Well, a lot of the credit must be given to  Julia Roberts, her portrayal of the real Erin is truly convincing. Her  performance brings the character to life; the audience can truly FEEL the  way she felt, I've seen this film twice in the theatre and it's just as  good the second time around.
The script is sharpe, some of the dialogue  from Erin is really humorous, and the drama is dealt with care and  precision. This is true movie from Julia and from director Steven  Soderbergh, another masterpiece to buy on DVD.",967593600,,1552,4.514388489208633

She gets a lawyer - gos to court & loses (due to her attitude &  language on the stand).  So she eventually gets a job at her lawyers law  firm as a secretary or something.  Ends up finding something odd in one of  the files & gets permission to check it out.
Then this movie  embroils upon a legal action against PG&E - for making a whole town  sick.  It also a wonderful movie showing the lenghts a mother will go to  for her children.

This is Julia Roberts at her best -- and I'm far from a  JR fan. In fact her performance is worth an oscar. I hope she has an  opportunity to play more brassy broads with character, instead of the  sensitive vulnerable roles she usually gets. All the characters are  well-cast.
The movie invites/demands comparison to ""Silkwood""  and ""A Civil Action"" and it comes off looking better than both.  ""Silkwood"" was preachy and self-righteous. While  ""Action"" was one of the best nonfiction books I've ever read, it  was too complex for a good movie. ""Erin"" corrects the  shortcomings of both.

Interestingly, while the film centers on a major lawsuit, there  are no courtroom scenes presented in connection with it.  All of that is  carried out through interpersonal relations, and carried out well, indeed.  For me, that was a refreshing touch.  As a federal judge, I appreciate not  having to take a bussman's holiday.  Plus, I often have problems with  courtroom scenes, and not infrequently find myself shouting at the screen,  ""Object you dummy, he's leading the witness!""

Julia  is undeniably the most successful female actress in the history of motion  pictures and this movie shows why.

Julia Roberts, in one of her freshest performances, is Erin Brockovich, a  single mother with three kids, out of work, with little education or  experience. She gets a job as gofer in a law firm headed by Ed Masry  wonderfully played by Albert Finney (Millers Crossing). Based on a true  story with a real life Erin Brockovich, it's a tale of David versus  Goliath. Watching the essentially conservative Julia Roberts playing  against herself with short skirts, push-up bras and stiletto heels and then  watching her character playing against the long suffering Ed Masry is very  entertaining. Aaron Eckhart (Any Given Sunday) gives a nice, complex  performance as Erin's helpful neighbor; Marge Helgenberger (K.C. of ABC's  China Beach) plays Donna Jensen, a touching victim who becomes a plaintiff.

Brockovich, a single mother, starts off in a survival  mode, trying to pay the bills and provide for her kids, but when her  straight forward personality lands her in the thick of ethical violations  by PG&E, she can't help but fight for the victims.  Her ability to  relate to these people is the axis on which the impending lawsuit turns;  her ability to weasel her way into her boss's fatherly heart enables her to  continue in a fight many would've deemed hopeless.
The humor was  effective throughout, softening me for the emotional scenes--directed with  subtlety by Steven Soderburgh.  The up and down relationship between  George, a neighboring biker, and Brockovich adds depth to her struggles and  emotions.
Sure, the movie has a lot of foul language, but it's an honest  depiction of a real woman, and it's hard to imagine her pushing her way to  the top of this dog-heap without just such grittiness.  She pulls no  punches, and neither does this movie. Don't miss it!",966643200,2,1210,4.900990099009901

Even though she hasn't exactly been typecast, films like Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Runaway  Bride stand out in her film r&eacute;sum&eacute;. However, she has proven that her acting  is definitely worthy of an Oscar with Erin Brockovich.
This is a true  story about a struggling single mother whose only wish is to have some  financial security for her three children. Having suffered a minor car  accident, she persuades her lawyer into hiring her. She begins to take  interest in a particular case. Several families have suffered from diseases  because their water is contaminated with chromium -- the Multi-billionaire  Company responsible has offered to buy their homes for a lot less than the  market value. The lawsuit, of course, is a big one for such a small law  firm, but neither Erin nor Ed (Albert Finney) has given up on the fact that  the company must be punished.

1270661,4,B00003CXFU,"Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story.  Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck  mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job.  After having an auto  accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law  firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications.  It seems that  utility giant PG&E has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents  are getting gravely ill.
The story starts poorly with scenes of Erin  looking for jobs and botching her accident case.  The first twenty minutes  of the film could have been condensed into five.  However, once the  investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing.  It is a  powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and  smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the  victims.
Director Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this  after his extremely avant-garde effort in ""The Limey"".  His key strength  here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert  Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters.  However, my  only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was  presented.  George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left  shoulder says ""DIRTY"") who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a  ponytail.  He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and  kind.  All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems  inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this  package.
Julia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any  myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.  A far cry from her  accustomed lightweight romantic characters, her portrayal of Brockovich was  gritty, raw and audacious.  Emotionally, she commanded states from  manipulative vamp and vicious harpy to sympathetic confidant and indignant  crusader.  This is unquestionably her best performance and legitimizes her  as one of the more versatile actresses in Hollywood.
Albert Finney also  gave a fine performance as the bumbling but effective curmudgeon of a  lawyer.  He was simultaneously obnoxious and charming and created a good  contrast to Roberts' character.  The two of them had terrific  chemistry.
Aaron Eckhart was lovable as George, although as mentioned  above, the character's forbearing personality didn't jibe with his  rebellious culture.  However, I put more of the responsibility for this on  the director than on the actor.
The DVD has some excellent comments by  the real Erin Brockovich that lend credibility to the story.  However,  Brockovich is so toned down in these interviews, it makes Roberts'  portrayal seem like an exaggeration.
This is an excellent story that is  well and believably dramatized.  I rated it an 8/10.  For viewers who enjoy  strong dramatic performances and who are not offended by liberal profanity,  I recommend it highly.",966384000,87,3000,5.2441613588110405

The fact that she had her cleavage on display for  most of the film was only a distraction for the first 40 minutes or so. As  the story developed I began to watch her character, not her breasts.

1270665,4,B00003CXFU,"Erin Brockovich could be regarded as one the outstanding movies made by Julia Roberts in the recent years. My Best Friend's Wedding was good, but  Rupert had stolen much of her attention from the audience. Notting Hill was  also good but the beautiful scenery and the superb supporting cast had  shared the glory. Erin Brockovich was a good one woman show for Julia and  she undoubtedly had picked up a good script and made a good movie.
The  story was not very complicated, with a new single mom bumped into all sorts  of bad luck in a short period of time, that finally turned out to be a  breakthrough of fate for a successful career in the legal profession. There  are lots of gags and funny lines throughout the movie, particularly like  her attitude against the other female lawyer who originally despised  Julia's qualification to be in the legal industry. However, funny lines  were not the only thing offered by this movie. There is a good description  between Julia and her boy friend, Julia and her eldest son, Julia and her  clients (which was of vital importance in the whole story) and Julia and  her boss.
What made this movie a successful one was that it tactfully  combined different elements in a single movie and the chemistry was just  right to the point. Humorous but touching, intriguing but sweet are some of  the good contrasts adopted in the movie. The change of attitude of Julia's  boss to her was a very good written part of the movie, from despise to  admiring, from fury to caring etc. they were all carefully written and  portrayed.
Nonetheless, there was one draw back for the movie. That was  Julia's constant dressing of low cuts in the movie (well, that helped a lot  in the movie for her to make different men yield to her requests)which I  think is not necessary in some instances. Anyway, this did not give the  movie a bad image because Julia did have a good outlook, so audiences would  still receive her happily.

This movie, starring the excellent actress Julia Roberts,  looking incredibly sluttish in a cheery sort of way, and the old war horse  Albert Finney as her jaded lawyer boss, is about as typical of this good  guy-bad guy style of movie as it gets.  The trouble is, it's a little too  long and the secondary plot about Erin's personal life is just really  poorly handled.

1270739,4,B00003CXFU,"In its story, `Erin Brockovich' breaks little new ground. Essentially, it joins the ranks of earlier films such as `Silkwood,' `The Insider,' `A  Civil Action,' `The Rainmaker,' among others, each of which tells the tale  of a common `David' (be it in the form of a whistleblowing employee or  compassionate, righteous lawyer) who, against all odds, mounts a seemingly  quixotic crusade against a corporate Goliath. All the above five films  expose the shoddy and often malevolent business practices of companies that  have resulted in major health care crises for both their own employees as  well as the residents who live near the companies' facilities. In the case  of `Erin Brockovich,' the villain is the PG&E electrical plant located  in the desert community of Hinckley, near Barstow, California. It seems  that the residents of this small town have been experiencing a  mind-bogglingly high number of serious illnesses and miscarriages that  PG&E has assured them are not in any way related to the activities at  their site. The company has even brought in medical professionals and  toxicologists to assuage the residents' growing fears. Almost by chance,  Erin Brockovich stumbles onto this information and takes up the challenge  of fighting for the rights of these victims and exposing PG&E's gross  malfeasance in the process.
Looking at its bare-boned plotting, one must  concede that there really isn't much that is new here. However, thanks to a  pair of utterly smashing performances by Julia Roberts and Albert Finney  and a beautifully well-rounded portrait of a real-life heroine, this Steven  Soderbergh film emerges as a true crowd-pleasing triumph. This may, in  fact, be not only Roberts' best performance, but her finest role as well.  Erin is not a conventional do-gooder heroine. First of all, she is often  abrasive and off-putting in her demeanor. Dressed more like a fashion  devotee of Roberts' `Pretty Woman' call girl character than a serious legal  executive, Erin often launches into unrestrained, obscenity-laced tirades  at her boss, her loving boyfriend, even the corporate lawyer bigwigs sent  to help her when the case she is making comes close to completion. Yet, it  is just this no-nonsense directness that earns her the confidence of the  people she is trying so desperately to help. A twice-divorced mother of  three, she is as passionate in the defense of her own children as she is in  the defense of her case. Yet, she is a woman made up of any number of  internal contradictions. Much as she loves her children, she has made a  shambles of her life in recent years. Rootless and lacking the skills  necessary to procure a well-paying job, she practically has to beg to get  hired in the office of a lawyer who has failed to win her a settlement in a  traffic accident case. Staunchly individualistic, she refuses to tone down  her rhetoric or her temper - or to adopt the more `professional' attire of  the business world - even if it might mean that she would be taken more  seriously by those around her. She assumes that no man would be willing to  consider having a serious relationship with her because of her children and  marital track record, yet, when a man enters her life doing just that, her  insecurities and her intense commitment to the cause for which she is  fighting begin to drive him away - and her children as well. Most  fascinatingly, perhaps, we are led to wonder whether it is really the  suffering people who motivate her obsessive commitment or rather, as she  herself admits, the personal recognition she receives now when she walks  into a room and people clamor desperately to know what she thinks on an  issue. All credit to Susannah Grant for writing a character so full of  believable paradoxes. Obnoxious as Erin is at times, her innate vitality,  wisdom and warm-hearted compassion consistently shine forth. Grant, by  making her such a three-dimensional figure, mitigates much of the  incredibility that lies at the root of this story, true though it may  be.
And, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.  She conveys each conflicting mood and character trait perfectly. Never  before has this actress brought such a breezy assurance to her every action  and statement. She literally holds this rich film together, forcing us to  focus intently on the storm of emotions taking place deep inside this  complex woman. This is definitely Oscar-caliber work. Equally brilliant is  Albert Finney as Ed Masry, the lawyer for whom Erin works, a jovial,  easygoing man who watches with a bemused appreciation as Erin hurls  colorful invective at him, rages against the system and dresses down with  withering sarcasm not only the legal representatives from PG&E but the  seasoned lawyers Masry himself has hired to help bring home the case. One  of Erin's most endearing traits is that she is an equal opportunity  harridan - a fact that wins Masry over every bit as much as it does  us.
If `Erin Brockovich' has a weakness, it comes in the form of Erin's  romantic relationship with the unemployed motorcycle rider next door. He  seems simply too good to be true, and, although we know that it is  necessary to fill in this particular part of Erin's life to make her  portrait a well-rounded and complete one, it is still the least interesting  and believable part of the tale. We feel we are being too often distracted  from the meaty center of the story.
Still, this is a minor quibble about  a film that works so beautifully on so many levels. As Erin Brockovich,  Julia Roberts has finally found the role uniquely suited to her enormous  talents and she blazes forth more brightly than she has ever done before.  I, for one, will be roundly rooting for her come Oscar night.",966038400,,5782,4.912953367875648
1270740,4,B00003CXFU,"Is this, as some have stated, a NORMA RAE for the 90's, uh, 2000's (well, it takes place in the 90's)? Well, yes it is. Hollywood likes to turn out  these ""little-man (or more recently, woman) against the system""  spectacles, and they can be counted on to have many in the audience  cheering on the quixotic main characters in their fights against a.  corporate polluters b. union busters c. corrupt politicians d. the powers  that be in any of their permuations.
So in that regard, ERIN BROCKOVICH  is not especially original. It is, however, effective--as good an example  of the genre as any you're likely to find.  As a tough-but-sensitive broad  with a heart of gold, Julia Roberts turns in another winning performance.  She cements her much vaunted ""comeback"" with a somewhat more  serious role than she usually gets and may well walk off with an Oscar for  her efforts. (Think of MASK-era Cher with a social cause.) And the rest of  the cast is very good indeed.  Much attention has been paid to Albert  Finney, who is very good as Erin's irascible boss.  More attention should  have been given to Aaron Eckhart, Marg Helgenberger and the all too briefly  seen Cherry Jones.
Following on the heels of THE LIMEY and OUT OF  SIGHT, the film represents another step forward on director Steven  Soderbergh's comeback trail as well.  It is, of course, a much less daring  film than Soderbergh is capable of.  But he is entitled to enjoy the  success (both artistic and commercial) achieved here.

Yeah, yeah, a lot of stuff has been said about the amount of  cleavage in every shot, and I can only say that it really isn't that  distracting (and for the male viewers, it does give you some entertainment  for some of the slower portions of the movie!).

1270830,5,B00003CXFU,"Erin Brockovich By: Heather Wadowski USC Grade: A+
 There is only one thing wrong with Julia Roberts' latest hit ""Erin Brockovich"" and that is that the film was released at the wrong time.  ""Erin Brockovich"" is  the perfect film to sweep the Academy Awards if only it was released around  the holidays. It is a touching movie that stays as real to real life as it  can. Similar to real life, the only way to get through the rough spots is  to laugh, and writer Susannah Grant knows this. Even during the film's most  depressing and down moments, humor rises to lighten the mood and entertain  the audience.  Julia Roberts gives her best performance to date as  Erin Brockovich, and she alone makes the movie. Albert Finney gives a  wonderful performance as well as Ed Masry, the boss who hates to love Erin.  His performances definitely deserve a nod come Oscar time, while Roberts  deserves not only a nod, but the gold.  Based on a true story, ""Erin  Brockovich"" is the story of a desperate single mom who takes a job in a law  firm to help put food on the table for her kids. What she ends up  discovering though are connections between a power company's abuse of toxic  chromium and the sick town locals who have been drinking the poisoned water  supply.  The DVD also includes deleted scenes, production notes,  spotlight on-location, theatrical trailers and ""Erin Brockovich: A Look at  a Real Life Experience.""  If there is one film every movie fan should  see it is ""Erin Brockovich."" Even with all the great summer films out in  the theaters right now, this one still beats them hands down. So go out and  rent the film that should sweep the Oscars before everyone else runs for a  copy, ""Erin Brockovich."" It is a touching story, a great comedy, and a  tear-jerker... in other words it has something for everyone.",964915200,,1823,4.6125
1270831,4,B00003CXFU,"We remember Julia Roberts for her megawatt smiles in Pretty Woman and romantic comedies like My Best Friend's Wedding. But never has she been  more feisty, intelligent in the gritty Erin Brockovich and with director  Steven Soderbergh from Out of sight, the movie is glossed up with excellent  cinematography from Ed Lachman, a strong and sexy plot, and stauch  supporting cast. No doubt, the star vechicle is Roberts in which she play  an intelligent waitress who sue a company and summoned an astounding  compensation for toxic pollution in which contamination plagued the town of  Hickley, California. There she emerged to be the talking point by beating  against corporate dominion.
Julia Roberts hones her acting and has never  been better. No doubt her megawatt smiles are put to good use for this one,  with those moulding apparel to flaunt boldly her figure. But behind the  cloak of independence lies a resonant human drama. Roberts faces the  breakdown of her family as a single, raising her children, and there in  lies a pillion rider neighbor Albert Finney and her refreshing chemistry  with George in the attorney firm.
It is her affection, her will and  strength that bolsters the drama and Roberts handles the emotional scenes  with maturity. It is a believable drama which explores the human heart, the  triumph against evil and the vulnerable woman's center. The video release  makes it a must-watch and is definitely a keeper.

Enter man on bike called George,( Aaron  Eckhart).Then theres the laywer Ed Masry(Albert Finney).Gruff hard boiled  but again has a kind heart under that bull interior. Story true, little  people take on the large corperation this time a water company. Roberts give  something more than playing the part of this heroine,she shows herself.

Even though the water company is the villian, you have a smaller one  played by another fine actor name  who is ask to come in by Finney  and help take the case the rest of the way. Roberts is both excellent and  frustrated by this out landish plan. She shows that she may look a tart but  she really has no label on her.

1270833,5,B00003CXFU,"I think that almost everyone is familiar with this film version of how Erin Brokovitch took on a large corporation that had knowingly polluted the water supply of a small town, and through their intentional cover-up had  adversely affected the health of almost everyone in that town.  This is a  true life David and Goliath story.  Only, in this case, ""David's""  weapons were chutzpa, perseverance, cleavage, and a big dose of commitment  to something she believed in, instead of a sling and a stone.
Brokovitch  was no dummy.  To the contrary, as portrayed by Julie Roberts, she was  bright, articulate (if a little earthy), and always aware of her impact on  people.  She had a natural empathy that people could feel.  Consequently  they liked her and responded to her.  This applies, from what I've read, to  the real life Brokovitch, and certainly to the screen Brokovitch.  I also  understand that Julie Roberts' manner of dressing was, if anything, toned  down a bit from that of the real life Erin Brokovitch.  For those who found  Roberts' attire distracting, I wonder how you would have responded to the  real Erin.
Albert Finney played her boss, a moderately successful  ""shirt-sleeve"" attorney who had a lot to lose if the lawsuit went  awry.  He gave this role just the right blend of wit, concern, fear, anger,  and elation.  He's the attorney that we'd all like to find.

This film may not have been the best legal  drama but that wasn't it's intent.  The intent was to show a woman who  started with no money, three kids, no job and ended up making a lot of  money because she CARED about other people.
It shows a strong woman who  had to do things on her own and survived.  It shows a caring mom who  dressed scantily and made it look good.  How many women out there went out  and bought Wonder Bras after that film?  It shows a woman who was dedicated  so much to helping other people that she spent her own time and money to do  it.
And the part is played so genuinely.  When she looks at her soon to  be boyfriend and says, ""Are you going to be something else I have to  survive because if you are, I have to tell you, I just don't know if I'm up  for that right now,"" every woman knows how she feels.

So what on earth is she doing in a true-life drama? A lot actually......... I have  to admit, I am a bit of a Julia Roberts fan, but never in my life did I  expect she is this good. No, good is not the right word; Oscar worthy only  comes close. That might make me a bit biased towards her but even the  cynics cannot denied that she has broken her ""pretty woman"" mould  and become a true character actor, besides Julia Roberts, her co-star  Albert Finney is also excellent as Ed Masery, he almost steels the show  with his subtle and convincing portrayal of Erin's boss and friend.
As I  said and you probably know, this film is based on a true-life story about a  woman with no skills who found out something weird is going on and sued a  multi-billion-corporation company and won the largest lawsuit payout in  American history. So what makes this film differ from other  ""true-life-dramas""? Well, a lot of the credit must be given to  Julia Roberts, her portrayal of the real Erin is truly convincing. Her  performance brings the character to life; the audience can truly FEEL the  way she felt, I've seen this film twice in the theatre and it's just as  good the second time around.

About how we  should balance our work lives and private lives. About how personal  relations and decent behaviour towards other people matter. Not that the  movie gives any predefined answers - it points out that the answers are not  written in black and white, you have to prioritize and make your own  choice, and it will not always leave you feeling good all of the time.

1270893,4,B00003CXFU,"I have always respected Julia Roberts for being a talented actress. For the past few years, she seemed to be stereotyped playing the nice girl  around the block type or forgettable role as she's done in ""Pretty  Woman"", "" Best Friend's Wedding"", ""Runaway Bride""  and ""Hook"" respectively.  I'm adamant that she could do better  considering that she had handled heavier roles before as she had done in  ""Sleeping with the Enemy"", ""Pelican's Brief"",  ""Conspiracy Theory"".  Obviously, the best has yet to come.  ""Erin Brockovich"" is every inch a Julia Robert's movie.  All the  punch lines were hers, and she dominated most of the screen time.  Her  presence is undeniable & unmistakble.  My friends reckoned that the  movie was so-so but I thoroughly enjoyed watching Julia Robert playing  ""Erin Brockovich"".  Rather than resorting to typical Hollywood  feel good ending with over-the-top soundtrack, & the common people  cheering to the Court's judgement, this movie took a subtle approach,  having Erin Brockovich breaking the verdict to one of her clients at the  front porch & having her accepting the verdict with quiet joy, a  triumph which was savoured with dignity.  True, this is a David versus  Goliath movie but a movie that's executed with style & sheer punch.  I  was disbelieved to be told subsequently that the real Erin Brockovich was  in the movie playing a waitress with her name tag being ""Julia"".  Get it?  So, you have better watch out.  Highly recommended.  By the way,  for your curiosity, the real Erin Brockovich just recently sued her bikie  ex-boyfriend for extorting her, such a far cry from the bikie boyfriend in  the movie who stood by her through those hard time.

  I know not many  people will agree with this, but Steven Zallian's 1998 film A Civil Action  was a masterpiece for every reason it is different from this one. That  movie was drenched with moral ambiguity, it was never clear who was good  and who was bad, all its character were lost in a sea of legal manovuering  and legal tactics that left all of them looking positively grey. In one  towering scene between Duvall and Travolta they sit in the corridor and  decide the fates of others. ""We are kings"" says Duvall at one  point.
  Erin Brokovich doesn't even attempt to explore such moral  depths. Indeed the phrase ""David and Goliath"" is used repeatedly  in this film, and in the process explaining what this film is about  completely. It maybe based on a true story, but so are those soulless T.V.  movies, and like those it feels positively fake. When it does attempt  depth, like the scene where a father stands alone in a junk yard shouting  at the sunset, I was wondering if the projectionist had accidently slipped  in a shot from another movie. Ofcourse these are precisely the reasons its  so popular with audiences, and unlike A Civil Action, the ending is happy,  cheerful and reassuring.
  This is unfortunate because anybody who knows  the films of Steven Soderbergh, knows how daring and original his films  usually are, particulary the masterful OUT OF SIGHT 1998 and KING OF THE  HILL 1993. This is a huge step down for him, making a predictable story  such as this. His terrific visuals don't mean much when serving cliche.
  I suppose the acting can be considered good. Lots of show offy stuff, great  one liners, lots of swearing, basically a good show. But the fake feeling  of the film makes the performances just that, a show, with no real pain to  back it up.
  This movie would make a passable rental then, but nothing  more. Watch this film back to back with A Civil Action and see the  difference between a real complicated soul searching film and crowd  pleasing nonsense.",956102400,17,2280,4.678481012658228
1270966,4,B00003CXFU,"Steven Soderbergh has done more than prove he is a good director, and this was a srange career move for him, it's not like his other movies. While formulaic, the movie is extremely entertaining and features a powerhouse  performance by Julia Roberts also with comic relief by Albert Finney, Aaron  Eckhart was also good in support. The wardrobe is distracting but  necessary, both to keep the audience interested and to show us how the real  Erin Brockovich dressed. The screenplay is OK, but at times too sarcastic.  Great performances and good direction by Soderbergh make this one more than  entertaining. Extras: the real Erin Brockovich appears as a waitress. From  a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 7!",955929600,,709,4.858333333333333
1270967,4,B00003CXFU,I loved this movie. The only thing was with the raving reviews it was getting I expected more. But  Julia was grate in this movie this is my favorite movie that she has been in besides Pretty Woman. But she shows a  little more in this then she did in that it is hard to belive. But this  movie was funny but it was also sad but it was funnier then I thought it  would be I thought more or less it would be a drama and it is both. That is  what makes it such a good movie. This is a must see it is worth your money.,955843200,,515,3.688073394495413
1270968,3,B00003CXFU,"Supposed to be based on a true story, but in actuality it merely shows the premise that it's OK to flash cleavage and have a Barbie-doll figure to get ahead in the world. Erin was a single parent on welfare(this smacks of too much PC for my liking) who took on the corporate society when a village's  children were poisoned from a nearby chemical water treatment works. The  courtroom scenes are second-rate John Grisham reworks. But the appearance  of Albert Finney as her harried solicitor boss, and a perfectly  hypocritical ending(she harped on about her principles but shut up when two  million dollars was handed to her) which to me shows the American national  sport of suing one another and just being plain selfish and greedy makes it  pretty interesting and cynical stuff indeed. Not one I'd see again, but it  was not a turkey either. Worth a look.",955670400,,859,4.718120805369128
1270969,5,B00003CXFU,"I enjoyed this movie tremendously.  I laughed.  I cried.  Felt sympathy for the victims.  Hated the bad guys.  And, most of all found Julia Roberts and her provocative outfits were fun to look at.  Yes.  It was a bit of a  distraction because in spite of a good story, her wardrobe became, in  effect, a character in itself which demanded attention.
The movie had a  lot of things all rolled into one.  It was a serious movie about people  whose lives had been ruined because of pollution.  It was a movie which  celebrated the spirit of an individual who takes on a corporation.  And it  was sexy.
I couldn't help compare this movie to ""A Civil  Action"" in which the twists and turns and complex legal details of a  similar lawsuit were explored at length.  I remember that movie being very  long and dull.  I don't think it did well at the box office.
There is  nothing dull about Erin Brockovich though.  And will surely make a lot of  money.  And if people go to see the movie to get an eyeful of Julia  Roberts, they will surprisingly see a good and inspiring story.
Erin  Brockovich isn't perfect.  Sometimes it plays like an overblown soap opera.  But it's sure to hold your attention.  If only to see Julia Roberts'  outfits.",955670400,3,1233,4.468181818181818
1270970,5,B00003CXFU,"Tiis movie showed that no matter who that you are you should hold your head high. Erin's personality showed that if you respect everyone people will respect you in return. Erin also showed that by having love,  compassion, and a strong will you can touch others in a way that never  seemed possible. In addition, by being true to herself and her clientsshe  succeeded.",955152000,,368,4.71875
1270971,5,B00003CXFU,"I still feel great after seeing ERIN BROKOVICH yesterday.  Without a doubt, Julia Roberts is a leading lady today, who lived the part of the  most outspoken woman who called a spade a spade, but who was extremely  intelligent with a strong love, and compassion for the people she was  lobbying for in Hinckley.
ERIN BROVOCICH knew who she was right from the  start even when she was broke and desperate.  She was a shrewd lady who  knew how to effectively use what she was physically well endowed with in  order to obtain the information she needed on the chromium problem without  performing any sexual contact favors with any person or persons.
I  could truly identify with ERIN because most times I too have negative  attitudes toward the utter hypocracy of the way that most on the executive  rung treat their subordinates.  Of course, if I were to try and become so  verbal with my attitudes toward the condescending attitudes of the  higher-ups, I would quickly be escorted out the door, and off the  premises.
I particularly liked the scene where she read that female  associate down who said to ERIN ""Well, we had to go through the files,  because there may be some questions that you would not have known enough  to ask"", and of course, ERIN replied ""Do not talk to me like I am  some kind of an idiot!""  Go for it all the ERIN BROVOTICHES out there,  you are just as smart, perhaps even smarter than the ones with some fancy  law degree or some super MBA degree from some ivy league college because if  you are not ready to fight your just cause in this  system, which in the  vernacular, sucks, it will devour you.  Therefore any film that can have  such an impact on the viewer is well worth seeing atleast once.  Thank you  Julia Roberts, you have never let down any of your viewers in all the  diverse roles you have played over the years.",954547200,2,1853,4.490963855421687
1270972,4,B00003CXFU,"She's great in the romantic comedies (""Best Friend's Wedding"", ""Runaway Bride""), but I prefer to see her in films like this and ""Conspiracy Theory"" and ""Sleeping With the Enemy"". She  has a good time with Erin's 'tude and her costumes.  The film only lacks a  little of the ""Silkwood"" endangerment, but I guess it didn't  happen that way.",954115200,,338,4.775862068965517
1270973,4,B00003CXFU,"It may be simple, but I gauge a movie with the question: ""Would I stand in line, pay my money, and sit through this movie again?""  For ""Erin Brockovitch"" the answer is YES!  Not only do I like Julia  Roberts in this movie, but Albert Finney plays the perfect lawyer/challenge  to Julia's character.  You know the ending has to be positive, but how you  get there has enough twists and turns to keep your attention from beginning  to end.  Stubborn is one word to describe Erin Brockovitch and it doesn't  get boring.  A must see movie that ""I'd see it again.""",954028800,2,559,4.445544554455446
