8337579,5,B000F3AAKM,Bought this series original release after buying a bootleg version. Keeping all eight volumes in original manufacturing wrap and even have the awesome limited edition art box with vol. one.,1388707200,,189,5.333333333333333
8337580,4,B000F3AAKM,"The movie was awesome. Though it does seem that it ended rather early. I say this because as soon as there was a break through and after all the back ground you would think it would involve much more twist to the end or a deeper plot but it basically ends good guy wins bad guy loses. I believe if the story continued a little longer exploring the new developments and the extent of it that it would have been better, a lot better. However, the story came to a close as soon as it really got interesting. Sorry if it's not too helpfull I'm not into spoilers.",1173312000,,558,4.175925925925926
8337581,5,B000F3AAKM,Alright.... I love the series but Im begging for more. It just wasn't the greatest thing being left open like that at the end with a feeling of there could be more... Although the series ends with an unfinished note it still a great peice of work and should definately be looked into.,1171324800,,284,4.377358490566038
