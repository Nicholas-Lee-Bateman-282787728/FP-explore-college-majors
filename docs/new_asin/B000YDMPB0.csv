3027486,3,B000YDMPB0,"I got the chance to see a rough cut of writer/director/actor Maurice Jamal's film last year during the 2006 San Francisco Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. As an openly gay black man, he lends a particularly unique and contemporary perspective on the Prodigal Son parable with this tale of a class-conscious New York-based magazine writer whose discovery of a ten-year old son leads him back to the family he left behind years ago in his hometown of Paris, Georgia. Those who have seen Cameron Crowe's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabethtown/dp/B000CNESJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabethtown</a>&nbsp;or Harvey Fierstein's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torch-Song-Trilogy/dp/B0001HAGRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torch Song Trilogy</a>&nbsp;will recognize the fish-out-of-water comedy that dominates the movie's first half. However, the movie gradually congeals into a more resonant drama of acceptance and forgiveness.

Despite his bare-bones production budget and a sometimes too facile approach to easy laughs, Jamal has a keen eye for his Deep South setting and especially his characters that manage to sidestep stereotypical treatment. What I particularly like about the family interactions is how Jamal chooses to emphasize the son's elitism that has alienated the family, not as much his sexual orientation. Rockmond Dunbar brings a sympathetic core to the uptight son, Patrick in his current life but Sheldon to his family. However, it's Loretta Devine who shines as his mother Evelyn, a hardened, alcoholic washerwoman who holds her own secrets and rails against her son with fervor. She seizes a great moment as she delivers a near-soliloquy at the dinner table near the end. With her foghorn, female-impersonator delivery, veteran scene-stealer Jenifer Lewis plays judgmental Aunt Lettuce with her usual gusto and provides the film's biggest laughs.

Most of the cast is amusingly over-the-top - Terri J. Vaughn's supportive sister Jackie, Filipino comedian Alec Mapa as the overzealous metrosexual friend, Sommore's throaty turn as the sassy daughter-in-law, and Jamal's own performance as Sheldon's straight, dim-bulb brother who runs the local butcher shop. The one major fly in the ointment is Joey Costello, who comes across far too flighty and nave as Patrick's partner Ryan. The film has a too-pat though forgivable ending, but Jamal shows himself to be a most idiosyncratic comedy talent.",1194566400,19,2501,6.0821529745042495

3027696,5,B000YDMPB0,I saw this video on Bet but missed about twenty minutes of it so I'm going to buy it from amazon.  The book touched on the touchy subject of being homosexual.  I believe that some people are born gay and I cover this in my book Don't Call Me Crazy! The Sequel.  I was reading Sylvia Browne and she said that before we're even born we choose our sexual preference.  And I believe this fully.  I used to think that people who were molested became gay but that's just not true for everyone.  I learned from an associate that he was never molested and grew up with two good parents.,1325116800,,578,4.209090909090909

3027699,4,B000YDMPB0,I was given this movie as a gift and was quite surprised by it.  Very Funny at times and also has messages about family love and forgiveness. I was also surprised by some of the hateful reviews here by some calling themselves Christians.  Well they might find out on judgement day their hatred and judgement is more a sin than homosexuality is.,1313971200,,344,4.532258064516129

3027701,3,B000YDMPB0,"It's not brilliant- i love Maurice Jamal (who wrote, directed and plays brother Eugene) but with DIRTY LAUNDRY the film he's pulled together comes off as disjointed and tepid. That said, it is a warm, well-intentioned film with a heart. The cast tries, especially Loretta Devine (who's working on all cylinders as a flawed mother) and Jenifer Lewis (pulling out the loud, overbearing Jackie Washington stchick she should have patented). Dunbar is a pleasant surprise as well. Overall it could've been much better, but it's still harmless fun. I could think of worse things to do on a Sunday afternoon.",1307404800,,601,5.02

And the way she had her cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth was too funny. The little girl named ""Pudge"" cracked me up too especially the way she spoke to Sheldon aka Patrick when she woke him up with her loud music. She acted like an old soul in a child's body. When she was dancing, I said, ""You go girl!"" I enjoyed the singing. The people in The Nashville Super Choir had some serious pipes! I liked the fact that in the end, the main characters changed for the better. Let's face it, at the end of the day, the only things that really matter are love and family.",1298419200,,705,4.30827067669173

3027705,5,B000YDMPB0,When this movie permired in NYC my friends raved about how good it was. Funny thing is I never saw it in theaters in DC when it came out.

3027720,5,B000YDMPB0,"This is a very funny movie that gets even funnier as it progresses!! Hold onto your sides, as you'll be laughing non-stop!!! Sports an elite all-star cast.

Magazine writer Patrick Sheldon (Rockmond Dumbar) who is gay, is a very successful businessman, lives in the Big Apple, has a very high-paying job, a luxurious penthouse-style apt and a very caring and loving boyfriend, just couln't ask for anything more or less.

That is until one evening during a party, a little boy named Gabriel (played by Aaron Grady Shaw from the HBO series In Treatment) shows up uannounced, knocks on his door, introduses himself and then tells Patrick that he's his son. The rug is snatched out from under him.

In an effort to get to the root of this surprise visit by Gabriel, Patrick
then takes the boy back with him back to his hometown of Paris, Georgia where he tries to unravel the mystery to find out just how he happens to suddenly have a child. Once there, he finds out that two worlds seem to collide with each other, as one shocking revelation after another is revealed!

Patrick who is often refered to as his birth name of Sheldon, he steadfastly and sternly demands to be called Patrick, visits and stays with his mom (Loretta Devine) while trying to find out just how Gabriel is his child. It appears that 10 years ago according to his mom (that's how long Patrick was in New York), Patrick had an affair with a promiscuous overweight girl, Christine, who is now deceased and that's how Gabriel came into existence.

While there, his partner / boyfriend Ryan (played by newcomer Joey Costello) happens to show up from New York unannounced (Baby, what's going on here?).(Mom: Baby?!! Baby?!!!) Well, the mud hits the fan when Pat's mom learns the real truth about her son being gay! She goes bonkers wondering why and where did she fail him, acting like she just wants to knock him out!

Enter Patrick's brother Eugine (played by Maurice Jamal who also wrote, produced and directed the film), who is insanely jealous of Patrick, stereotypes and puts him down constantly, mainly because of his sexual preference. But he openly wishes that he had Patrick's son. He and his wife have been trying to have a child, but they can't. Patrick also has a nosey snobbish snotty-nosed self-centered aunt (Jennifer Lewis from Cookout)) who just can't seem to stop poking her nose in the family's pesonal affairs and is always stirring up trouble and controversy!

Patrick also has an overweight smirky-comment-spewing 11-year-old cousin, Pudge who doesn't let Patrick get a word in edgewise and flatly insists that she has to get up and pratice very early in the morning for her dancing lessons, playing outlandishly loud music and making Patrick's sleeping late impossible. Ryan later has a conversation with her while Patrick's mom eavesdrops. She begins to slowly rethink things about her son.

When he was a little boy, Patrick used to keep a diary that he read by the lake, which his brother Eugene uased to ridicule & embarass him about, and his mother use to yell at and scold him about back then and snatched it from him and keeps it hidden from him and reads it herself now and then. Gabriel has started doing the same thing.

At church and at a cookout, even more shocking secrets are reveled as Patrick and his lover accidentally reveal their love affair over the PA system! The crowd gasps in horror and the aunt faints (""Oh Lord! Gay! I knew about it, but not in my family. Not in my family. Homosexual).

Meanwhile, Patrick and Gabriel try to work out their arguments and diffences. Gabriel overhears a very disturbing argument between Patrick and his mom, and becomes very upset with his dad, giving him the cold shoulder and tuning him out of his life! But later, they both come to terms with the fact that they still love and want to be with each other. Touching! Patrick eventually accepts Gabriel has his child, and the two are now getting along together and are inseparable.

Then, just when one would think that all of the dirty laundry has been washed and hung out to dry, Patrick's aunt who sits down with the family for a Sunday Dinner, drops another bombshell and opens up another can of worms and then the family is fighting all over again, as personal insults begin to fly across the room!! Mom is a heavy smoker and an alcoholic, as she likes to smoke, drink and get drunk. Patrick and Ryan announce that they, along with Gabriel, are moving out and into their own apt. Mom then accepts Patrick and his lover as part of the family.

The whole family them comes together and buries the hatchett. A very happy ending.",1239062400,5,4629,4.673218673218673

My disappointment comes from the story - It seemed very contrived. It reminded me of that Movie Norman...is that really you ? from 1976. A movie I can forgive because it was 1976. I know there are a million stories out there but this one has been done to death. ""Good looking Gay african american man  whose family doesn't suspect he is gay until his ultra feminine white boy friend shows up "". How come he didn't show up with his masculine white boyfriend , or show up with his feminine black boy friend
or why not a good looking white guy and his ultra feminine black boy friend going to meet the white family - you get my point . Whats up with that . It wouldn't bother me as much but there was no on screen chemistry Rockmond and Costello - so Sheldon coming out to his family seemed more contrived than anything and force upon him. Rather than have Sheldon showed up with a less famboyant friend with somewhat similar interest and jobs no one really thinking anything of it and  Sheldon deciding  on the truth.

This movie is not the greatest story ever told. And it won't be taking home a busload of Oscars. But there are moments of real truth and poignance and compassion here. And the acting---though over the top---is an absolute delight. Rockmond Dunbar is sexy and subtle and moving. The entire cast deserve a huge Bravo.

This film is interesting, insightful, funny, and reveals itself skillfully during the course of the film so that it keeps you guessing, just a little.  On the whole, it is a great film with wonderful characters, a good story, and some good belly laughs.

That said, there are some unnecessary story lines and unnecessary characters that don't significantly add to the story, and I winced a few times the second time I watched it, wishing a few things were trimmed.  ""Laundry"" is also a bit of a ""talky"" film, where everybody talks a lot, mostly without listening, but I suppose that's probably what most families do.

The characters are well fleshed-out, likeable, and the actors seem to relish their roles, played to the max. The music is fun, too.

This is a film that is worth seeing and thinking about.  It's enjoyable, has good messages, generally, and is well-crafted overall.  Recommended.",1204156800,3,1013,4.91764705882353

At the insistence of a friend, I watched the movie and I do NOT regret it. It is true to the T of how it is to be gay, black man and how African American deals with homosexuality. In real life it's not as great as this portrayal, but it's nice to see it finally on screen. This film is hilarious. I ROFLed (seriously) a few times throughout and found myself wanting to watch it again. I could've docked two stars because Rockmond Dunbar's portrayal of Sheldon/Patrick was a bit much and I feel like they could've made better choices with the score, the ending credits and there is an obvious flub in the beginning involving a character's wardrobe (see if you can spot it).

3027750,2,B000YDMPB0,"In both of these movies, a gay man of color has to deal with his family face-to-face after a long time.  In both, they have white lovers who are more obvious than they.  In both, a child is involved.  Both have big family functions where tension rises.  In both, at least one parent becomes or admits to accepting their son's sexual orientation.  The role that language plays in ""Wedding Banquet"" is played by socioeconomic class here.

There are two small differences.  In this, the gay man of color goes to his family's world whereas in ""The Wedding Banquet"" the parents come to their son's world.  Here, there are only Black folk on the cover whereas Mitchell is on the cover with the Chinese characters, if I remember correctly.  This must do with target audiences.  This movie is trying to bring in Black viewers without spilling the beans.  ""Wedding Banquet"" attempted to attract non-Chinese viewers who might assume it's ""just Chinese"" otherwise.

Though Loretta Devine's character says, ""This ain't Soul Food!"",  this film's penultimate scene is clearly taken from that film.",1203724800,6,1083,4.95
3261983,3,B000YDMPB0,"I got the chance to see a rough cut of writer/director/actor Maurice Jamal's film last year during the 2006 San Francisco Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. As an openly gay black man, he lends a particularly unique and contemporary perspective on the Prodigal Son parable with this tale of a class-conscious New York-based magazine writer whose discovery of a ten-year old son leads him back to the family he left behind years ago in his hometown of Paris, Georgia. Those who have seen Cameron Crowe's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabethtown/dp/B000CNESJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabethtown</a>&nbsp;or Harvey Fierstein's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torch-Song-Trilogy/dp/B0001HAGRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torch Song Trilogy</a>&nbsp;will recognize the fish-out-of-water comedy that dominates the movie's first half. However, the movie gradually congeals into a more resonant drama of acceptance and forgiveness.

Despite his bare-bones production budget and a sometimes too facile approach to easy laughs, Jamal has a keen eye for his Deep South setting and especially his characters that manage to sidestep stereotypical treatment. What I particularly like about the family interactions is how Jamal chooses to emphasize the son's elitism that has alienated the family, not as much his sexual orientation. Rockmond Dunbar brings a sympathetic core to the uptight son, Patrick in his current life but Sheldon to his family. However, it's Loretta Devine who shines as his mother Evelyn, a hardened, alcoholic washerwoman who holds her own secrets and rails against her son with fervor. She seizes a great moment as she delivers a near-soliloquy at the dinner table near the end. With her foghorn, female-impersonator delivery, veteran scene-stealer Jenifer Lewis plays judgmental Aunt Lettuce with her usual gusto and provides the film's biggest laughs.

Most of the cast is amusingly over-the-top - Terri J. Vaughn's supportive sister Jackie, Filipino comedian Alec Mapa as the overzealous metrosexual friend, Sommore's throaty turn as the sassy daughter-in-law, and Jamal's own performance as Sheldon's straight, dim-bulb brother who runs the local butcher shop. The one major fly in the ointment is Joey Costello, who comes across far too flighty and nave as Patrick's partner Ryan. The film has a too-pat though forgivable ending, but Jamal shows himself to be a most idiosyncratic comedy talent.",1194566400,19,2501,6.0821529745042495

3262217,5,B000YDMPB0,"This is a very funny movie that gets even funnier as it progresses!! Hold onto your sides, as you'll be laughing non-stop!!! Sports an elite all-star cast.

Magazine writer Patrick Sheldon (Rockmond Dumbar) who is gay, is a very successful businessman, lives in the Big Apple, has a very high-paying job, a luxurious penthouse-style apt and a very caring and loving boyfriend, just couln't ask for anything more or less.

That is until one evening during a party, a little boy named Gabriel (played by Aaron Grady Shaw from the HBO series In Treatment) shows up uannounced, knocks on his door, introduses himself and then tells Patrick that he's his son. The rug is snatched out from under him.

In an effort to get to the root of this surprise visit by Gabriel, Patrick
then takes the boy back with him back to his hometown of Paris, Georgia where he tries to unravel the mystery to find out just how he happens to suddenly have a child. Once there, he finds out that two worlds seem to collide with each other, as one shocking revelation after another is revealed!

Patrick who is often refered to as his birth name of Sheldon, he steadfastly and sternly demands to be called Patrick, visits and stays with his mom (Loretta Devine) while trying to find out just how Gabriel is his child. It appears that 10 years ago according to his mom (that's how long Patrick was in New York), Patrick had an affair with a promiscuous overweight girl, Christine, who is now deceased and that's how Gabriel came into existence.

While there, his partner / boyfriend Ryan (played by newcomer Joey Costello) happens to show up from New York unannounced (Baby, what's going on here?).(Mom: Baby?!! Baby?!!!) Well, the mud hits the fan when Pat's mom learns the real truth about her son being gay! She goes bonkers wondering why and where did she fail him, acting like she just wants to knock him out!

Enter Patrick's brother Eugine (played by Maurice Jamal who also wrote, produced and directed the film), who is insanely jealous of Patrick, stereotypes and puts him down constantly, mainly because of his sexual preference. But he openly wishes that he had Patrick's son. He and his wife have been trying to have a child, but they can't. Patrick also has a nosey snobbish snotty-nosed self-centered aunt (Jennifer Lewis from Cookout)) who just can't seem to stop poking her nose in the family's pesonal affairs and is always stirring up trouble and controversy!

Patrick also has an overweight smirky-comment-spewing 11-year-old cousin, Pudge who doesn't let Patrick get a word in edgewise and flatly insists that she has to get up and pratice very early in the morning for her dancing lessons, playing outlandishly loud music and making Patrick's sleeping late impossible. Ryan later has a conversation with her while Patrick's mom eavesdrops. She begins to slowly rethink things about her son.

When he was a little boy, Patrick used to keep a diary that he read by the lake, which his brother Eugene uased to ridicule & embarass him about, and his mother use to yell at and scold him about back then and snatched it from him and keeps it hidden from him and reads it herself now and then. Gabriel has started doing the same thing.

At church and at a cookout, even more shocking secrets are reveled as Patrick and his lover accidentally reveal their love affair over the PA system! The crowd gasps in horror and the aunt faints (""Oh Lord! Gay! I knew about it, but not in my family. Not in my family. Homosexual).

Meanwhile, Patrick and Gabriel try to work out their arguments and diffences. Gabriel overhears a very disturbing argument between Patrick and his mom, and becomes very upset with his dad, giving him the cold shoulder and tuning him out of his life! But later, they both come to terms with the fact that they still love and want to be with each other. Touching! Patrick eventually accepts Gabriel has his child, and the two are now getting along together and are inseparable.

Then, just when one would think that all of the dirty laundry has been washed and hung out to dry, Patrick's aunt who sits down with the family for a Sunday Dinner, drops another bombshell and opens up another can of worms and then the family is fighting all over again, as personal insults begin to fly across the room!! Mom is a heavy smoker and an alcoholic, as she likes to smoke, drink and get drunk. Patrick and Ryan announce that they, along with Gabriel, are moving out and into their own apt. Mom then accepts Patrick and his lover as part of the family.

The whole family them comes together and buries the hatchett. A very happy ending.",1239062400,5,4629,4.673218673218673

3262220,5,B000YDMPB0,"Dirty Laundry has a somewhat slow /  questionable start, however, after the movie gets going it is hillariously funny and entertaining.  It is the type of movie that will make you laugh out loud over and over again. It is great fun for family or a group of friends looking to enjoy a good funny movie together.  I have shown this movie to several groups of friends and family and they all loved it. Definitely worth renting or purchasing.",1222819200,,438,4.518987341772152
3262221,2,B000YDMPB0,"I was disappointed and I really wanted to like this movie. When I first saw the cover of the DVD . I thought ""WOW"" what a great cast. Jennifer Lewis and Loretta Devine never disappoint , and of course Rockmond Dunbar gold stars all around.
My disappointment comes from the story - It seemed very contrived. It reminded me of that Movie Norman...is that really you ? from 1976. A movie I can forgive because it was 1976. I know there are a million stories out there but this one has been done to death. ""Good looking Gay african american man  whose family doesn't suspect he is gay until his ultra feminine white boy friend shows up "". How come he didn't show up with his masculine white boyfriend , or show up with his feminine black boy friend
or why not a good looking white guy and his ultra feminine black boy friend going to meet the white family - you get my point . Whats up with that . It wouldn't bother me as much but there was no on screen chemistry Rockmond and Costello - so Sheldon coming out to his family seemed more contrived than anything and force upon him. Rather than have Sheldon showed up with a less famboyant friend with somewhat similar interest and jobs no one really thinking anything of it and  Sheldon deciding  on the truth. I give the movie a luke warm recommendations I feel it could have been better they certainly had the talent",1222300800,,1363,4.358267716535433
3262222,1,B000YDMPB0,"I was disappointed as the cast boasted a better ensemble than the story itself! This was a garbage movie, horribly written and just all around bad..very disappointed to say the least. All the veteran and good actors/actresses..bad flick..save yourselves the trouble and the 2 hours to watch this and go watch something else..
Anyone who knows anything about a good well written movie knows that this one is just not one!",1222041600,2,420,4.929577464788732

3262224,4,B000YDMPB0,"Being a fan of Rockmond Dunbar and Loretta Devine, I made it a point of seeing this movie in its theatrical release.  And I also knew it would become a part of my DVD collection.  It's not the best out there but it's entertaining, cute and endearing.  Rockmond Dunbar is to be applauded for his courage as an American black actor willing to take on these kinds of roles.  He did a good job.",1217203200,,390,4.22972972972973
3262225,1,B000YDMPB0,"This movie is awful from the start.  I rented it and was totally disappointed.  I actually had to turn it off after about thirty minutes.  It seems to celebrate homosexuality and tries to marry it with Christianity.  I was appalled as a believer.  If you are a Christian, this is not the movie for you.  Great cast, but horrible storyline and even worse acting.",1216339200,2,361,4.5625
3262226,1,B000YDMPB0,This movie is awful!  Good Christian values DO NOT go hand in hand with HOMOSEXUALITY!  It was a total waste of my $19.99 plus tax. It was definitely not what I expected it to be.  ZERO STARS!!,1214265600,4,193,4.162162162162162
3262227,5,B000YDMPB0,"I really enjoyed the movie. The storyline was great. The actors were wonderful (""Kudos"" to Loretta Devine). It made me really proud to know that Black writers/producers could present a movie, dealing with gay life relationships, in a positive family oriented atmosphere. I was also honored that the movie showed that gay families CAN and DO provide their children with loving homes and positive family structure. THANKS to ALL and please continue to educate others!",1212364800,,465,5.213333333333333
3262238,5,B000YDMPB0,"This movie is so well put together. The writing, directing and the cast are phenomenal. It is truly a shame that because of the subject matter, this movie did not make it to mainstream audiences. Kudos to the cast, Rockmond Dunbar, Loretta Divine, Jennifer Lewis, Teri J. Vaughn for having faith in Maurice Jamal and his project and working for next to nothing to get this story told. A day will come when movies like this will be told to broader audiences and can put thought and challenge thinking, which is so needed in the world these days.",1208736000,,544,4.561224489795919
3262239,5,B000YDMPB0,"The film is touching and very well done for an independent film.  The performances are outstanding and the key to its quality.  Loretta Devine is amazing.  Jenifer Lewis is hysterical.  And, Rockmond Dunbar is extremely skilled and endearing as the quirky lead character.  A must see for the family.  Great job!",1206921600,,311,5.0
3262240,4,B000YDMPB0,I watched this movie and loved it!  It was full of life lessons and filled with many surprises.  And talk about funny?  It was small town comedy at its best.  It is a definate watch.,1206662400,,182,4.114285714285714
3262241,4,B000YDMPB0,"I first saw ""Dirty Laundry"" during an advanced screening with Maurice Jamal and Sommore. I know then that I would be buying this movie as soon as I got a chance. It doens't disappoint. Rockmond Dunbar, Loretta Devine, Jenifer Lewis, and the rest of the cast all bring their ""A"" game. Yes, the movie took a somewhat predictable, sappy turn at the end and some plot holes remained, but I finished the movie very satisfied. I hope Maurice creates a sequel to catch us up on the happenings of this hilarious family. The DVD extras and deleted scenes must be watched to get to know the characters that much better.",1206403200,,609,4.545454545454546
3262242,3,B000YDMPB0,"I enjoyed Maurice Jamal's The Ski Trip. I adore Loretta Devine and Jenifer Lewis, and Rockmond Dunbar brings a comical sensitivity to his roles, but there was so much going on that it was a bit difficult to catch some of the stories.
I felt as if I were watching a redux of Tyler Perry....better luck next time...",1205193600,,313,4.413793103448276
3262243,5,B000YDMPB0,"Jennifer Lewis & Loretta Devine---what more could a moviegoer ask for?  These two stellar talents wring more humor and pathos out of a line of dialogue than Laurence Olivier in his prime.

This movie is not the greatest story ever told. And it won't be taking home a busload of Oscars. But there are moments of real truth and poignance and compassion here. And the acting---though over the top---is an absolute delight. Rockmond Dunbar is sexy and subtle and moving. The entire cast deserve a huge Bravo.

But the movie belongs to Jennifer Lewis and Loretta Devine. They should be charged with grand larceny, because they steal every scene.",1204156800,10,640,4.853211009174312
3262244,4,B000YDMPB0,"Director Maruice Jamal has managed a quantuum leap from his previous film, the Ski Trip, which was barely passable.  This film is interesting, insightful, funny, and reveals itself skillfully during the course of the film so that it keeps you guessing, just a little.  On the whole, it is a great film with wonderful characters, a good story, and some good belly laughs.

That said, there are some unnecessary story lines and unnecessary characters that don't significantly add to the story, and I winced a few times the second time I watched it, wishing a few things were trimmed.  ""Laundry"" is also a bit of a ""talky"" film, where everybody talks a lot, mostly without listening, but I suppose that's probably what most families do.

The characters are well fleshed-out, likeable, and the actors seem to relish their roles, played to the max. The music is fun, too.

This is a film that is worth seeing and thinking about.  It's enjoyable, has good messages, generally, and is well-crafted overall.  Recommended.",1204156800,3,1013,4.91764705882353
3262245,5,B000YDMPB0,"Maurice Jamal has come a long way.  His first film ""The Ski Trip"" was release a year of so on DVD, and now his latest, ""Dirty Laundry"" is out and hanging proudly on the clothes line.  It is rare that a film maker is able to cross the line from the LGBT world to the general market.  This film allows Jamal the chance to discuss real family issues without scaring people away.  It is time that movie/DVD lovers let their hair down and just enjoy a good film.  Sometimes you have to look beyond race & sexuality and just relax and experience it.  This is one of those films.",1203897600,,572,4.201834862385321
3262246,4,B000YDMPB0,"I was very resistant to watching this movie because I thought it was going to be campy beyond belief and poorly written. At the insistence of a friend, I watched the movie and I do NOT regret it. It is true to the T of how it is to be gay, black man and how African American deals with homosexuality. In real life it's not as great as this portrayal, but it's nice to see it finally on screen. This film is hilarious. I ROFLed (seriously) a few times throughout and found myself wanting to watch it again. I could've docked two stars because Rockmond Dunbar's portrayal of Sheldon/Patrick was a bit much and I feel like they could've made better choices with the score, the ending credits and there is an obvious flub in the beginning involving a character's wardrobe (see if you can spot it). But it made for all of these by being funny, relevant and honest. Buy this film, you'll love it.",1203811200,,890,4.367469879518072
3262247,2,B000YDMPB0,"In both of these movies, a gay man of color has to deal with his family face-to-face after a long time.  In both, they have white lovers who are more obvious than they.  In both, a child is involved.  Both have big family functions where tension rises.  In both, at least one parent becomes or admits to accepting their son's sexual orientation.  The role that language plays in ""Wedding Banquet"" is played by socioeconomic class here.

There are two small differences.  In this, the gay man of color goes to his family's world whereas in ""The Wedding Banquet"" the parents come to their son's world.  Here, there are only Black folk on the cover whereas Mitchell is on the cover with the Chinese characters, if I remember correctly.  This must do with target audiences.  This movie is trying to bring in Black viewers without spilling the beans.  ""Wedding Banquet"" attempted to attract non-Chinese viewers who might assume it's ""just Chinese"" otherwise.

Though Loretta Devine's character says, ""This ain't Soul Food!"",  this film's penultimate scene is clearly taken from that film.",1203724800,6,1083,4.95
