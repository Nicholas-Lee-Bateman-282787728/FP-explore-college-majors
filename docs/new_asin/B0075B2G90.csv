5057112,4,B0075B2G90,"To put it bluntly, Dr. H is one sick f##k!!!!  Necrophilia was never too interesting to me (at least, none of my crowd was into it), but it's not surprising Freda would want to explore it -- and with Steele, no less!  The thing that always gets me is the film was made during the waning days of the Production Code (yes, even Europeans had to go along with it), so there were limits to what  was actually allowed on screen.  That means that even though the doctor can run his hands along the sides of a woman's body, he can't actually touch her breasts.  Which makes it even MORE perverse.  Steele is very good; too bad they always dubbed her.  Best of all, the picture looks absolutely TERRIFIC!!!!  Recommended.",1422489600,10,713,4.430769230769231
5057113,4,B0075B2G90,"OK early '60s English-dubbed Italian horror film.  Barbara Steele plays the second wife of an off-kilter doctor who, after some kinky fun-and-games, lost his first wife.  Or did he?  The usual spooky goings-on.  Barbara Steele is tormented by weirdness that everyone assures her is her imagination. At 83 minutes the Video Dimensions DVD-R  is the most complete. The Olive Films is very good quality but is only 77 minute, and has no extras except for English sub-titles.  The Video Dimensions DVD-R is excellent quality, the color is beautiful and, has a lot of trailers.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1409961600,7,608,5.02
5057114,4,B0075B2G90,"Last night we had a late night double feature. In addition to watching 'The Vampire Bat' we also viewed 'The Horrible Dr. Hitchcock'. I'm a big fan of Mexican, Spanish and Italian horror films. I enjoy there different atmosphere and stories compared to American made films of the same time. Here director Riccardo Freda (as Robert Hampton) did a fine job. I especially enjoy films, like this one, with Barbara Steele. 'THDH' had many of the elements I enjoy most like, good atmosphere, artistic cinematography, fine acting, seemingly accurate period costumes and Gothic settings. The story itself was very off- beat especially for 1963, dealing with a taboo theme like necrophilia. The plot seems like a mixture of Rebecca (1940) with bits of Jane Eyre and strong doses of horror. The films are alike in that a second wife, or lover to be, comes to live in the secluded mansion of a departed beautiful first wife. The home is full of her memories and even large portraits of the first wife. And of course there are mysterious screams and noises in the night and figures moving in the dark. Like in Rebecca theres even a strange maid devoted to her first mistress. There are some other comparisons to Jayne Eyre I won't go into so as not to reveal the plot. We watched this in Italian with English subtitles. The subtitles did not take away from the film at all. If you like Italian or foreign horror films in general, this is a must see. I would include it on my list of best Gothic horror films of all time.",1394841600,5,1508,4.588888888888889
5057115,3,B0075B2G90,"A good Barbara Steele character, but the plot is not as interesting as it sounds.  If you like old scary films, this one doesn't have much scare, but still entertaining for the atmosphere.",1376956800,,188,4.696969696969697
5057116,5,B0075B2G90,"I just have to say, Wow!! what a great job Video Dimensions did with their print of Horrible Dr. Hichcock. I have had a few versions of this public domain title and it NEVER looked this good! The picture is anamorphic widescreen (approx. 1.66) and full of color. The detail on this DVD is really good, too.
This may not be Barbara Steele's best, but I still like it. Like it even more now upon getting this copy.
This version (on a DVD-R) runs 83 minutes and has a tacked on opening credit but the rest of the picture knocks my socks off. Cleaned up print without dirt, scratches and other debris. I cannot believe they found this good of a print of this lost classic. Thank you Video Dimensions (whom you can buy directly from on Amazon) for releasing this disrespected classic after all these years. I will cherish this version and add it to my Barbara Steele collection. Now, if you could only put out a decent print of Steele's THE GHOST.
This appears to be the uncut version originally titled The Terror of Dr. Hichcock. Let me know if I have mistaken on this being the uncut version.",1373500800,16,1089,4.422885572139304
5057117,4,B0075B2G90,"I'm a Barbara Steele fan and quickly ordered the product once I saw it was finally available on DVD. I give the film itself 4/5 stars.  The product is a DVD-R and not a DVD.  Amazon and sellers should list this product as a DVD-R.

5057118,5,B0075B2G90,"While the GHOST (A SEQUEL) is a better film this one, The Horrible Dr. Hitchcock should not be missed either. Who can resist Barbara Steele`s horror flicks?  The quality (COLOR & WIDESCREEN) on this one is great unlike most copies from VHS which are barely watchable.",1352505600,10,267,4.804347826086956
5057119,4,B0075B2G90,"The DVD from Video Dimensions looks very good and is anamorphic widescreen. It's a DVD-R. It doesn't look official, with low resolution artwork, but the source elements for the film appear to be taken from an official release.

Most sources list 2 versions of this film, one running 76 minutes and another running 88 minutes. The DVD from Video Dimension runs 83 minutes. I'm not sure what the difference is between the 83 and 88 minute version, but be assured that there's plenty of disturbing stuff here, even though it's from the '60s.

It's generally considered to be one of the highlights of Italian Gothic horror and we're not likely to get a better version any time soon.",1348272000,20,678,4.737288135593221
5057120,4,B0075B2G90,"A nice Ricardo Fredda, gothic tale about a mad physician obsessed with his dead wife and keeping her alive. In the middle of all this, he marries our beautiful Barbara Steele, who becomes suspicious until she eventually finds out. To the fans of our gothic queen, this is probably her prettiest look ever. The cover is a bit deceptive as she does not shoot the mad guy.

Technically, a surprisingly clear DVD transfer by Video Dimensions. The aspect ratio seems to be widescreen. This feature runs for 83 minutes as advertised. Two or three scenes seem to be cut in their original length, so we may have an extended version in the future. Audio is in English and no subtitles are provided. As extras, you will get about 6 trailers of other b-horror movies, including Doctor Butcher M.D.",1334448000,28,786,4.695652173913044

5057123,2,B0075B2G90,"DVD Specific Review:

I was given a copy of this as a gift, shrinkwrapped, new from the only vendor who sells it (I'm not allowed to post the name) and it was a DVD-R. I was told by the person who bought it a couple of months ago (we all know not to buy gifts that far in advance and, somehow, we all do it, don't we) that it was not supposed to be a DVD-R but a pressed disc, that the listing here would specify DVD-R (homemade copies) as opposed to official pressed releases, if these were not the official discs, but the listing does not. So, allow me to warn you. This is not a pressed, official disc. It is a DVD-R also called a homemade or home burned copy. We have other names for home burned copies but I am not allowed to use those either though I'm betting you can guess them. I was horrified to receive such a disc that had been sold by a reputable source and I admit that it is entirely possible that they are unaware of the problem with their supply but, upon reading reviews here, this has happened before. For that reason, I am buying the Olive release, even though it is edited. I know it will be an official, licensed product. I hope this helps you to make an informed decision. Up until she handed me this homemade item, I would never have agreed to buy the edited version so I thought you guys might want to know, just so you can make a choice based on all the information. Good luck.",1474934400,5,1403,4.13919413919414
5057124,5,B0075B2G90,"Once again Olive Films comes through, who are these guys? Classic, atmospheric film, way ahead of its time, great copy! Highly recommended!",1473984000,,139,5.363636363636363
5057125,4,B0075B2G90,"The upcoming Blu-ray and DVD (finally, a real DVD and not DVD-R for this title) from Olive Films are listed on both Amazon and the Olive website as having a running time of only 77 minutes.  The previous DVD of this, from Video Dimensions, used a fantastic-looking print (anamorphic transfer) that ran 83 minutes.  That's six minutes shorter than before.  Why go to the trouble of restoring the image for Blu-ray if you're not going to use a complete cut of the film?  Does anyone know what will be missing from the Olive release...and why?",1471305600,6,540,4.652631578947369
5057126,3,B0075B2G90,"The DVD is fine, no problems, the video transfer is OK, The only problem I had was there seemed to be some odd cuts here and there. I wish these distributors would stop messing up movies, I thought Blockcuster went out of business.",1470528000,,231,4.395348837209302
5057127,2,B0075B2G90,"I hate to pre-judging DVDs before I buy them usually or even before they are released. But already hearing this is going to be the butchered American cut of this movie turns my stomach.  Maybe they should just hand the rights to Severin or Synapse and be done with it. At least they would preserve the movie uncut.
Note that the original version of this movie ran 86 to 87 minutes long and the US release or this DVD which will be released in September by Olive Films is going to be missing about 11 minutes of that. I guess that's the only way we're going to see this movie legitimately speaking, the original version has long been circulated by bootleggers and gray market disc sellers. I was hoping someone was going to release the uncut version to disc and end the years of bootlegs, but probably no such luck. By the way they got the name of the Director wrong, or at least used his alternate name ""Robert Hampton"" who really is Riccardo Freda. That's like attributing a Mario Bava movie to ""John M. Old"".",1468195200,13,1010,4.43010752688172
5057128,5,B0075B2G90,The dvd was excellent.,1467417600,,22,4.75
5057129,4,B0075B2G90,"The best version of this film currently available.  The prints is in good shape and the widescreen anamorphic 16 by 9 is good too.  Colors are vivid and this film's vivid use of color inspired Dario Argento--who sites this director as being more of an influence on him than Mario Bava.  Though this isn't blu ray--I have seen the OLIVE release blu ray and this version looks nearly as good, sounds much better, and is far less cut up--  The quality in this release is so much better than previous crappy looking versions that, for now, this is the way to see this movie.  I liked it so much better finally seeing this decent DVD that it was like seeing the film for the first time.  This version seems to be uncut or any cuts made to it were done professionally as there aren't any jumps in the fine music score or anything too obvious.  This is a relatively early horror film so you shouldn't expect lots of nudity or bloodshed.  The necrophilia aspects of this are solidly implied.

This is one of those key films in Italian horror cinema.  DVD also includes trailers for some other Italian films and some of these are also widescreen.  Yes it is a DVDr but they give you a good product at a decent price.  Now if only someone, or they, would do an equally good version of the follow up film by this same team  THE GHOST.",1457395200,11,1323,4.351020408163265
5057130,5,B0075B2G90,"From what I've heard, this is a legitimate release and that Video Dimensions actually purchased the rights to release this gorgeous copy.  It can be considered the official US commercial release of the long awaited film.  Ditto OFF ON A COMET by Karel Zeman.
I'm glad I got it as this is a beautiful transfer and worth the price if you are a fan of Italian Gothic Cinema.",1449446400,2,371,4.4411764705882355
8510485,4,B0075B2G90,"Alright, here we are with another ""Olive Films"" Blu-ray edition. The movie print they used looks good for the age of the movie, etc.
I like the movie and the ""Doctor"" played here is one sick puppy. He can't stand the idea of his beloved Margaret being buried in the ground, so what does he do? He goes to the cemetery where she is about to be buried by the caretaker and literally gets her body back out of the coffin, fondling it before he does.
As I have stated in my other reviews, ""Olive Films"" has zero special features and that is sad, to say the least.
I am sure there is a theatrical trailer out there for this movie if they looked for it AND the movie runs (76:48) in length from opening to end.
So any of you thinking of buying this edition, it looks good, but it is not the extended version of 83 minutes as some reviewers have stated.
The only features the MENU has to offer are CHAPTER SEARCH and ENGLISH SUBTITLES.
Comes with an Olive Films Mini catalog inside also.

I would look around for a good deal on this one, if you really want it on HD Blu-ray. The print does look good on the Ultra 4K TV, but it isn't as sharp as some of her black and white movies on Blu-ray.",1511827200,,1184,4.125541125541125

8510487,5,B0075B2G90,Excellent horror movie especially if you are a fan of Barbara Steele.  I ordered the DVD from Video Dimensions which is the uncut version.  The picture and sound quality is excellent.  There is also a trailer for the film and some trailers for other horror movies as well.  The movie has a good pace to it and Barbara Steele does an excellent job playing the wife of the bizarre Dr. Hichcock.  I highly recommend this film for fans of Gothic horror and for fans of Barbara Steele.,1497312000,4,480,4.471264367816092
8510488,2,B0075B2G90,I didn't know this film was cut. Why does the U.S versions of euro films always have to be censored? Besides it being cut...not a bad film,1487635200,,138,4.148148148148148
8510489,5,B0075B2G90,"I have the Video Dimensions copy, and it is quite good as others say.  I also have an import version that runs 84 minutes,  and has the original  Italian title. I think it is more uncut, but haven't compared two  in a while, but I do watch the import over the V D copy, as  it's just  as  good  quality.  The extra  minute could be being PAL,  although I think PAL runs  a little faster.  This film suffers just  a little  motion jumping when the camera  pans, but that's  in both these copies,although the import just a little less.  I got the import from  a friend,  so any inquiries  about it, I can't answer. There are some very reputable grey market  sellers that probably have the import version",1485302400,,701,4.3125

Video and sound are quite good for this ""uncut"" version.  Well worth having for any Giallo fan.  Skip the Blu-ray version until someone gets smart and puts it out in its original form.  Generally, I'm a fan of Olive Films for delving into obscure titles, but not when they deliver chopped up versions of them.  Definitely stick with this 2012 Video Dimensions version.",1478131200,5,495,4.579545454545454
8510493,5,B0075B2G90,"A classic gothic thriller from the golden age of Italian cinema!  Unfortunately this is the trimmed U.S. version that omits the more blatant references to necrophilia, the blu ray is still a must-have for Euro horror and gothic terror fans!",1477872000,,240,5.0
8510494,5,B0075B2G90,"Contrary to the what the reviewer ""Rae"" said, the Video Dimensions release is NOT a DVD-R. It is a bona fide DVD release. It says this both on the case artwork and on the DVD itself. The DVD topside has a nice photo from the movie imprinted on it - very professionally done. Unfortunately I have not seen the Olive Films Blu-Ray so I can't compare image quality of the two releases (I won't buy the Olive version because it is the American edit which is cut to 77 minutes). But I wholeheartedly agree with other reviewers who said that for a DVD the Video Dimensions release features very good image quality with nice color balancing, certainly WAY better than previous versions and bootlegs. The run time is 86.5 minutes. They advertise it as ""Uncut,"" which I suspect means it is the entire UK cut of the film. Phil Hardy lists the runtime of the original Italian version as being 88 minutes, so at most the Video Dimensions release is only missing 1.5 minutes of footage. Not bad! Recommended.",1476144000,8,995,4.564245810055866
