8629052,1,B000094FFX,I am Chad Wingerd and the film image and year are incorrect.  War Dogs:  America's Forgotten Heroes was a documentary/re-creation film shot in 1998 by GRB Entertainment and can be purchased through them.  William Bison did direct and Tim Prokof was the writter; John Drimmer was the Supervising Producer.  I have no idea what film this is or who the actors are on the cover shown.,1190160000,,380,4.712121212121212
