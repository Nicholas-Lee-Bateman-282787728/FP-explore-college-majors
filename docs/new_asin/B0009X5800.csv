CUBA CROSSING: There's plenty of action when a Florida boat captain - Tony Terracino is forced by members of the Mafia and CIA to put an end to a Cuban based drug smuggling ring and Fidel Castro. Stuart Whitman stars as a mercenary hired to kill the Cuban dictator. He soon discovers that he will be immediately expendable once the deed is done, and that co-stars like Robert Vaughn should not automatically be trusted. Beautiful location filming in Key West highlights this fast-moving - action packed adventure.
