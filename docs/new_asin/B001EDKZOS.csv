8297888,2,B001EDKZOS,"Cannibal Taboo(2006) is a soft core porn/horror exploitation film directed by Mike Tristano. The script was written by Chris Burdick. The film stars Scott Carson, Neil Delama, Paul Logan, Ashlie Rhey, Linda Roberts, Regina Russell, and Jessica Simone. The film's production values are on par with a soap opera and the acting is decent. The movie was shot with digital video cameras. Do not watch this film with children or people with strong morals and ethics! In Cannibal Taboo, a professor has to stop his crazy mother from sacrificing her children. This movie feels like a poor, poor man's Roman Polanski style thriller! Regina Russell plays a TV reporter in the film. She played a mermaid in Hook(1991). Cannibal Taboo was shot in 2003, but not released on home video until 2006. The Blu Ray version was released in 2008. Hollywood ""A movies"" these days are packed with CGI. Cannibal Taboo relies on old fashioned, practical effects and editing tricks. Cannibal Taboo is a must see for people who like ""roughies"".",1349568000,4,1017,4.953216374269005
8297889,2,B001EDKZOS,what a wierd movie! from bad acting to incest i don't know where to begin. the movie is a cross between a bad horror movie and a porno. the director actually manages to keep the viewer in some suspense until about midway through the film then it just gets ridiculous. but if you like cheesy movies you may like this. if you want a real film about cannibalism and an ideology about it watch the movie Ravenous,1340064000,,408,4.311688311688312
