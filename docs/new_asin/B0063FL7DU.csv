I started to watch it all alone, and before I knew it my whole family was absorbed in it.  There are three disc and each one delivers more than the advertisement on the case describes.  Buy this one!",1398211200,,299,4.5

8491968,5,B0063FL7DU,"I'm getting this and giving it a provisional FIVE until I tell you otherwise.
I'm getting it MOSTLY for those giant crystals men can WALK on... and some of
the other STRANGE, but TRUE stuff!

SOME will complain that it's THREE one-hour DVDs... but it makes ""re-visits""
easier and QUICKER!",1379980800,,288,4.76
8491969,4,B0063FL7DU,I bought this set of DVDs because of seeing a snippet of one of them on public TV. I loved the aerial views of Cappadocia and was stunned by the HUGE gypsum crystals in a cave in Mexico. As it turns out the opening sequence on the same DVD is breathtaking as well. Great DVD and I haven't seen all of it or the other 2 yet.,1376784000,2,323,3.8358208955223883
8491970,3,B0063FL7DU,"Amazing Underground Secrets had its moments, but was a disappointment.

The background music was so loud that you could hardly hear the presenter.

The music really wasn't necessary in my opinion and spoiled the documentary.",1344729600,,224,5.371428571428571
