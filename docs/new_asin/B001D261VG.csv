3522228,1,B001D261VG,"This movie is not officially related to the cars franchise. The animation is terrible, the storyline is nonexistent which made it impossible to make it through the entire film. Our two year olds wouldn't even watch it. It cost .01 cent which was still overpriced.",1364169600,2,263,4.866666666666666

3522231,1,B001D261VG,"First of all. I am from Brazil and this was a ""Brazilian production"".
  But Every Brazilian CG ARtist just hate this production, cause it's a shame for the world to had something like that produced here. Brazil is very strong in Computer Graphics, exporting so much talented artists to around the world, and we have tons of very good artists here. Please, don't consider that production as an example of Brazillian CGI Capacities, this is the worst thing we ever saw on our industry...

  This Review is just a answer from the Brazilian CGI/Artists and Animators, to alert you, that THIS IS NOT A REPRESENTATION OF BRAZILLIAN ANIMATION CAPACITIES. We don't like that too, and it's not, in any way a sample of our work. We can do any production here, with the same Level of quality of any bigger studio, for sure. So, don't take this trash movie as a sample of Brazillian work. It's not.",1229385600,6,886,4.617834394904459
