6140115,5,B00H83OGZM,great game.  Auburn played very well- I have to tip my hat to them.  Very exciting battle with lead changes and momentum shifts all through the game.  The game was not decided until the final minutes of the 4th quarter.  Classic game- will go down in history as one of the best title games.,1389052800,7,290,4.314814814814815
6140116,5,B00H83OGZM,Great,1409270400,,5,5.0
6140117,5,B00H83OGZM,The DVD is perfect for reliving the best victory since our 1999 Championship. It was a long time coming.,1408838400,,104,4.526315789473684
6140118,5,B00H83OGZM,Loved it,1407110400,,8,3.5
6140119,5,B00H83OGZM,"Great video quality for a DVD but I wish it was in HD.  Although this is not a BluRay it is a dual layer DVD so the bit rate/picture quality is better than if it was recorded on a single layaer DVD.  If you recorded this game from your DVR to a single DVD using your DVD recorder then you should buy this DVD.  The quality will be MUCH better.  My PS3 upscales it to better than DVD quality so I'm OK with the video quality.  This may be the best quality non BluRay recording I have ever seen.  Worth buying if you are a fan of NCAA football.  (Video Specs: 720x480, 60 Hz, 16:9, Dual Layer DVD  /  Audio Specs: AC3, 48,000hz, 16 Bit, 2 Channel).  Approx. run time 161 Minutes.  No Commercials.",1403222400,,694,4.104477611940299
6140120,3,B00H83OGZM,"Quality of the picture left something to be desired and the chapters are random and useless. The ""bonus"" feature is the trophy presentation. I would have waited and bought the bluray, but I read they weren't going to do one. Still fun to watch one of the best championship games ever",1401580800,,283,4.568627450980392
6140121,5,B00H83OGZM,"One of the best games of the year with the mighty invincible SEC going down, will watch it over and over",1398988800,,104,4.0
6140122,5,B00H83OGZM,The DVD was well edited and the game unfolded smoothly.  The feeling and momentum of the game was not lost by the editing done to this DVD version.  Nice job!,1397952000,,158,4.233333333333333
6140123,1,B00H83OGZM,"Why in the world would they not produce a blu ray version of what has been dubbed one of the best, if not the best BCS National Championship? FSU is on of the top selling brands in college football, with fans the world over. This is insane.",1397433600,,240,4.127659574468085
6140124,5,B00H83OGZM,It was the best way to close out the BCS Championship with a 34-31 victory for Florida State over Auburn. Auburn had nothing to be ashamed of with the season they had....Great job Amazon with me getting my video on time also.,1396656000,,225,4.380952380952381
6140125,5,B00H83OGZM,My son is in the military and on a mission when the game was played. He is an FSU graduate and avid Seminole fan !!! He loved seeing the game on tape even though he knew the result. He has watched the game many times since he received the DVD. I am sure it will be one of his prized possessions for many years to come or at least until next years National Championship victory!,1395964800,,377,4.04
6140126,5,B00H83OGZM,"Now my husband can relive the game over and over.  Too bad it was so far away and expensive to go to, or we would have been there.",1395964800,,130,3.642857142857143
6140127,1,B00H83OGZM,"Totally unacceptable quality for 21st century TV. Back in 2001 this recorded version would have been fine, but with HD TVs and blu ray technology, this is definitely a purchase I would NOT recommend. Especially for sports. Sad.",1395446400,2,227,5.0
6140128,1,B00H83OGZM,"I just heard back from Team Marketing who I'd contacted to see when we could expect to see a *HIGH QUALITY* Blu-Ray of the game. Apparently they don't think they will sell enough produce a blu-ray.

Alabama got a blu-ray last year, the 'Noles should get theirs this year!

If you want to buy a copy please contact them and let them know! (see comments for link)

Tell your friends!

Go Noles!",1395100800,5,392,4.402777777777778
6140129,5,B00H83OGZM,"A wonderful keepsake DVD of the last BCS Championship game, this was a gift for my grandson who is loving every minute of it.",1394409600,,125,4.25
6140130,3,B00H83OGZM,"The DVD reproduction of the BCS National Championship game is not the same quality as the original broadcast.  Disappointing.  Not as clear and sharp, but good enough for viewing all the plays and instant replays of this classic game.",1394323200,3,234,4.9743589743589745
6140131,5,B00H83OGZM,My wife and I went to the game but missed a lot since we were there.  This DVD was well done and we will enjoye it over and over again.,1393891200,,135,3.5
6140132,3,B00H83OGZM,"Again, whoever produces these videos (ESPN productions or XOS Digital) does not include chapter marks to quickly scan thru the game and the sound is only 2 channel sound instead of the 6 channel sound the game was originally broadcast on ESPN. Furthermore, there are frequent shortcuts taken to fit the game on a regular 8.5 gb disc. Also, the frame rate is probably around 24 fps which does not give the game that ""live game"" feel but rather a ""movie"" feel. Other than that , i guess the dvd would be acceptable for most people. Still do not understand why there is no blu ray version of this game as there was one for the 2013 BCS Championship.",1393804800,7,646,4.436974789915967
6140133,5,B00H83OGZM,"Given that previous NC games have been released on Blu-ray, I'd be really surprised if the producers on this game release it only on standard DVD format.",1389484800,6,153,4.703703703703703
6140134,5,B00H83OGZM,"Wow, unbelievably comeback in the ages for Florida State to beat Auburn in the most emotional roller coaster ride dramatic title game since the 2006 Rose Bowl and the 2003 Fiesta Bowl.",1389052800,4,184,4.78125
