2092329,4,B0002F6AIE,"The Rubberdubbers is a hard-to-find British preschool slow action series (kinda like claymation) that is occasionally run on the Discovery channel.  Finbar is the arrogant but lovable shark and this DVD centers around him.  (I think he is very funny.)  My 5 year old son was engaged, but my 3 year old daughter did not like it that much - maybe when she is older.  I enjoy watching it though, so I'll be optimistic.",1184716800,,415,4.5675675675675675

8027749,1,B0002F6AIE,"The shark is SUPER annoying. He speaks in normal words and then says ""arr arr arr"" or something like that. He says it A LOT. Maybe it is geared for a younger audience. My 7 year old asked me to please turn it off because of the shark.",1445472000,,234,3.8958333333333335

8027752,5,B0002F6AIE,"I think the thing my son loves the most is that it's based off bath toys and their adventures when not being used at bath time. Like all little ones, bath play is a big part of developing their imagination and this show helps take that concept a step further. Love this one for my boy (4 yrs).",1437350400,,293,4.068965517241379
