6486332,5,B00LGQ0T8U,"I had the great pleasure of meeting Karen Noonan in 2009. My mother had just passed away and I was suffering from many physical issues. I was in a dark place and felt hopeless. My sister suggested we begin a Yoga practice as a dedication to our mother. I had reservations as I had never practiced and really knew nothing about Yoga. As clich as it sounds, this was one of the biggest turning points in my life. Karen greeted us with open arms and an open heart. I felt like I was home and part of a family; accepted on every level. The growth and transformation that occurred was unlike anything I had ever experienced. Her knowledge of Yoga and her gentle, compassionate nature assisted in moving my mind, body and spirit to another level. I highly recommend this video/practice to anyone that is suffering from physical issues or anyone that is searching for a gentle practice. Karen is a blessing to so many; this video is a must have!",1417651200,11,938,4.491228070175438
6486333,5,B00LGQ0T8U,"I began my journey with Karen Noonan and Yoganize after a serious back injury with recurring pain. My doctor advised that until I began exercises to strengthen my core, things would not improve. I asked around for Pilates/Yoga studios and found the Yoganize studio through a friend...I was hoping only for a physical solution to a chronic injury. What I received was so much more. Karen's knowledge of the body is remarkable. Her understanding of the connectivity between mind/body/spirit is extraordinary, and placed me on a lifelong journey towards better overall health and well-being. It's wonderful to have Karen available through her videos to help refocus when things get hectic. I highly recommend this DVD and all of her products!",1414454400,7,739,5.166666666666667
6486334,5,B00LGQ0T8U,"Several years ago I started yoga with Karen Noonan.  As a teacher of art in middle school, i loved my job and liked my students.  The were fun and bouncy. Still at the end of the day I had was tense and tired. Consequently, I remembered a co-worker who went to Yoganize.  I was a bit hesitant to go for I considers myself pretty old, in my late 50ish life. Indeed, was going to the chiropractor for spinal problems as a result of scoliosis. He encouraged me to stretch and exercise, but I do not like the gym.
Yoga sounded like a good way to excercise my spine, relax and detox my mind. I read all her education and credentials; Still, Little did I realize what a journey I would begin.

  I cannot thank Karen enough for her instructional style, her caring heart, he beauty and beautiful way she trained me to replace negative thoughts, and replace patterns of thinking that were wholly hurtful to my spirit.  This transformation was solely predicated on my just showing up, moving through the poses as best I could, and listening to her affirmations.  Slowly in 6 years of yoga my daughter was saying you have completely changed, my chiropractor said, you have improved you spine and neck which is now has a much better curve.

Yoga is a mind body and spiritual process.  Karen calls it loving self, I call it letting go of the ego that is not serving you and embrace all that you can be.  She applauds all our successes and is the sweet voice in our hearts and minds that helps us value and love ourselves.  Yoga is a life-long  path to healthy both mentally and bodily that is for me critical to continue.

 I will always be able to cherish my dear friend even though she now lives in Germany. I have bought her DVD's and love them both. I use all the healing yoga to warm up and go to the Loving self for additional moves.  Having been in her class, I would be so pleased if she offered more tapes for her routines and so varied and excellent. I love both these tapes, and yes, I have Arthritis, and Auto-immune issues. So I warm up with Healing Yoga at least 2 days a week. I still love to take classes from teachers she has trained. I am also so proud of her for making these DVD's. She is very warm and very animated and fun in class.
Lastly, I am so proud of her for making these DVD's because I know it is so hard to tape your process and put yourself out there on tape. She has gone outside of her comfort zone because she wants every one of us to have a wonderful healthy life and to experience a great yoga practice and create a path to loving self.  She has made two great tapes for our enjoyment and I highly recommend both. Hope you love your tape, and have many blessings on your yoga path. Much Love XoXo Karen.  Fondly, Katy Stanberry.",1414195200,21,2754,4.273603082851638

6486353,4,B00LGQ0T8U,"This dvd is supposed to be designed for people with arthritis.  There were certain poses that a person with arthritic knees can not do well. I tried to modify those poses, but I wish the practioner  with arthritic knees could have demonstrated the modifications.  Overall, I enjoyed the dvd, but found some of the exercises too difficult with my arthritic knees. For example,  one pose requires the person to kneel.  I cannot do that, but the practioner who had arthritic knees on the dvd could do everything that stressed the knees.",1446768000,15,533,4.813186813186813

8665752,3,B00LGQ0T8U,Not for back surgery. I got this CD because I needed help in strengthening my back. I had surgery 2 years ago and felt I could use this tape to push me along.  Boy was I wrong.  Some parts of it were pretty good but I think the part putting your legs up on the chair and exercising was not good (for me).  It took me 2 weeks to recuperate from that exercise.  I would still do the very first part as that is very comfortable and I think it is a very good CD for those who have not already had surgery.  You have to be careful what you do after surgery.  I am not reporting on the entire CD.  Just the part that I already did.  Will update later.,1481932800,3,645,3.8702290076335877

8665754,3,B00LGQ0T8U,"I haven't been doing yoga in years so I thought I'd start with low impact yoga. This video gave the options for advanced and beginner/people with knee or back problems which made it easier since I'm not as flexible as before. My only complain and the reason why I gave 3 stars is that the audio goes in and out in different areas, it sounded like she was pinching her nose or she had congestion which made it hard to follow when you were lying down.",1475280000,2,449,4.232558139534884
