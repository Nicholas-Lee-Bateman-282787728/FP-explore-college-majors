8741701,1,B01884404G,"None of the comments positive reflect the junk that I received.  It's a green screen with flurries and cheap basic piano.  No Bing Cosby, no snow scenes... Pure crap!",1512172800,,166,4.689655172413793
8741702,1,B01884404G,"Absolutely disappointed! In the first place I thought I was ordering the movie ""White Christmas"" so imagine my chagrin. I decided to play it, might be something to watch & listen to. Again total disappointment. First of all it will not let you choose which of 4 scenes to watch from the main menu, cinlly figured it out with playing & using skip. Next all the scenes are is different types of snow falling on different colors of background. The sound is very tinny sounding and one song was garbled sounding. I tried some music on each section and i had to turn it off. It was getting to my nerves. If I want to watch it snowing all I have to do is look out my window!
I want my movie",1481155200,,684,4.1893939393939394
8741703,4,B01884404G,"Disclosure: My review is based off of a review copy of this DVD.

First off, let me say, ""Wow."" I did not expect what I actually got. I actually wasn't expecting much because the artwork and description do nothing for me. In spite of the flaws with the artwork and description, this is one little entertaining DVD. It's not entertaining in the sense that you can sit and watch it endlessly...well, I guess you could, but it's entertaining in the sense that it creates the right Christmas ambiance. In that it lives up to its name. I had it on in the background during festivities and it really set the mood. Listening to the music and glancing occasionally at the TV to see what scene was playing while I was cooking or whatever just put me in a good mood. Plus my cats enjoyed it. I recommend it.",1450483200,,797,4.385135135135135
