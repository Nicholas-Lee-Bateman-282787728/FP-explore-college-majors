8126020,3,B000FS999U,When I ordered this I didn't think to look and see what the code was. I received it saw that I couldn't  play in my dvd player. So I can't do a good review on it because I couldn't watch it. I will try again on ordering it and see what happens.,1404432000,,244,3.6923076923076925
8126021,1,B000FS999U,"The item I received was not in a format that could be viewed on a United States DVD player.  The seller should not be selling this type of product to people in the United Stattes.  In the title, it indicates European Universal Studio Release but I didn't know that meant I was not going to be able to view it.  It should be spelled out better for the buyer.  The cover was not even in english.  I did contact the seller via email and we did an exchange for the United States version but this should not have been necessary.  When you purchase a product from someone in the United States then you should think that you can view.  Thank you to the seller for correcting the problem but he should explain this better in the future to his potential buyers.  Now that I have received the correct formatted product I am enjoying it very much!",1269043200,4,836,4.314102564102564
