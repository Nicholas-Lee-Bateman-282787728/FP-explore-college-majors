7873248,3,6304498950,"Weddings and Babies was one of Morris Engel's follow ups to Little Fugitive. It isn't as charming or good as that film but then it is a more serious film.
John Myhers plays a photographer who is sick of filming weddings and babies but that is just what his girlfriend wants (Viveca Lindfors). The presence of his declining grandmother entering into the picture only makes things worst. He has to question the direction in his life.
The New York setting is made to good use. The settings are photographed well. Engel was a photographer before hand so possibly there is an autographical edge to this movie. 2.5 rounded to 3.",1130025600,2,622,4.663636363636364
