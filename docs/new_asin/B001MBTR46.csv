8320894,5,B001MBTR46,These trees are astounding.  I had heard of the giant redwoods of course but never anything about these beautiful trees.  Everyone should at least see them.,1431475200,,156,4.961538461538462
8320895,2,B001MBTR46,Music and narration depressing.  I think it would have been better had I muted the sound entirely.  He doesn't say anything significant.  But even then the photography is dark.  Just not worthwhile.,1429401600,,198,5.09375
