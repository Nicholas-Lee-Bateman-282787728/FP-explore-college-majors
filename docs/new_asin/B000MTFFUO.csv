2747504,5,B000MTFFUO,"I first watched this special on PBS just channel surfing. Never had I seen a documantary that sent chills up and down my arm. I was very young when all this was taking place, but I remember the movie that was made about this sinister act. Well, the movie did not do the actual events any justice! The thing that really got me was hearing the screams of the mothers and children as death succumbs the entire congregation.

Everybody cannot handle ""in your face"" truth like this, but if you can, I suggest you see this documentary, if just to be aware how quick you can be ""spiritually"" seduced my evildoers. .",1194134400,,608,4.428571428571429
2747505,4,B000MTFFUO,"This documentary is well made, but I feel bad for anyone who saw only the film and didn't see the DVD. Without the deleted scenes, which explain how some of the members escaped and what happened to them afterwards, the film makes even less sense, and frankly, there are many questions left unanswered. For example, why Guyana? We never hear how or why Jones chose that country to establish Jonestown. At 90 minutes, the film should at least be re-cut to include the deleted scenes, and could have gone much further in its exploration of People's Temple. That said, it's well done and interesting to watch.",1193529600,6,605,4.716981132075472
2747506,4,B000MTFFUO,"There have been several films, documentaries as well as docudramas, about Jonestown, and the first hour of this documentary doesn't offer much new information. The thing that makes it stand out from the rest is the last half hour, which includes footage from the last day in Jonestown and interviews with several members - at least two of which were there on November 18th, who escaped into the jungle - and members of Leo Ryan's group of visitors.

The movie never really tries to explain why it happened and it doesn't answer all the questions the vierer may have, but it is still definately worth watching, especially for the last half hour and for the interviews.",1187913600,,667,4.75

2747508,5,B000MTFFUO,"This is a fascinating and chilling (if too brief) look into the history of Jim Jones and his People's Temple.  What it offers beyond mere history, though, is a glimpse into the seductive nature of good turned into evil, through the eyes and words of people who at one time followed and believed in Jones.  Most of them acknowledge some sense of strangeness, even psychosis, in the behavior of Jim Jones, but they chose to focus on the good he was doing and the utopian hope he was preaching publicly.  And clearly in its early days, the People's Temple WAS doing good, and offering hope and a real sense of community - integrated community - to those who came through the doors.  But somewhere, somehow, it all began to go wrong.  And yet people averted their eyes, as Jones drifted deeper and deeper into madness and drug his followers with him.  This film esposes these issues without rendering any judgment upon them - it reveals the dreams and the hopes that were shattered that November day in 1978 along with all those lives.  It is a morality tale for anyone who knows the power and goodness, but also the dark side, of religious faith.  I am a Presbyterian pastor, and I would highly, highly recommend this film - as hard as it is to watch at times - for anyone who is interested not just in history, but in the power of faith - a power that can do such good, and yet be used in the wrong hands, for such evil.",1178323200,8,1418,4.385496183206107
2747509,5,B000MTFFUO,"""Jonestown"" was originally a PBS ""American Experience"" program. It is presented only in the form of archival footage of the People's Temple and survivor interviews. There are no interviews of sociologists and there is no narration. This format is very powerful.

The DVD has good extras, including a touching interview with the director and some informative deleted scenes. The program has more information about the survivors interviewed during the final credits, so don't turn it off until the very end to see everything.

This program is horrifying and depressing, but IMHO, something that is important to watch because it illustrates very well how religion-based psychological and intellectual submission can, in the space of a few years, turn good people into slaves and good intentions into tragedy. I recommend watching ""Jonestown"" early in the evening, then watch something fun like ""Wallace and Gromit"" before you go to bed!

One note of caution. While it might be appropriate - even important - to watch this film with a strong-minded and mature teenager, young children should not be present while it's viewed.

I woke up with the following thoughts the morning after I watched the film (Unfortunately, I did not follow ""Jonestown"" with ""W&G,"" so I went to sleep very agitated) :

Jim Jones and his People's Temple had a lot in common with many of today's (and history's) religious leaders and religious groups.  Do any of these things sound familiar?

A CHARISMATIC AND PATERNALISTIC LEADER offers distressed and idealistic people hope - ""new life"" - and a profound sense of community. He tells the downtrodden that they are no longer ""lost,"" that they are special indeed. He provides his followers a sense of superiority to the ""worldly heathen"" - which also instills fear of outsiders. He interprets scriptures, and chooses passages, in a manner conforming to the psychological needs and existing beliefs of his audience. He makes tithing a moral duty and a necessity for full membership. He presents himself literally as a wise and knowing ""father,"" but eventually uses that status as a tool for abuse and self-gratification, sexually and otherwise. He develops an ""inner circle"" of people willing to do his bidding in an increasingly unquestioning manner. Once a solid group of followers is formed, he begins to teach that to leave the group is to ""blaspheme"" and that misery will befall those who leave, when in fact the greater misery is found by those who remain.

THE MEETINGS / SERVICES skillfully employ music and rousing speeches to excite the audience. The assembled people are asked to greet and embrace the people around them, which serves to increase solidarity, and whether by design or happenstance, to expose and create discomfort among the hesitant and the skeptical. Phony healings are part of the proceedings.

THE FOLLOWERS are a mix of individuals, but in general are characterized by either very difficult personal/social/economic backgrounds or by a deep sense of idealism. The leader's message promises hope and equality to the former - a feast for their starving psyches. For the merely idealistic, passions for love, community, and justice are inflamed.
Almost all of the followers are essentially decent and good people, but tend to be psychologically needy in one way or another. The tremendous sense of hope, of caring community, and the promise of utopia (in this life or the next) offered by the leader and his belief system causes the followers to suppress whatever critical faculties they might possess.

All of the above describes Jim Jones and his People's Temple. At least some of the above describes a zillion other religious groups, though of course very few come to such an horrific end.
However, if you watch this film, consider the point at which the People's Temple situation began to produce more harm than good. I think that point came long - very long - before the Kool-Aid was prepared. In fact, it came at a point where thousands - maybe hundreds of thousands - of churches, mosques, and synagogues operate every day - where doctrine, community, and leadership become more important than reason and reality. This is the point where, to be precise, the people become ""as children"" or ""humble sheep.""

Also, this program serves, in my opinion, to bolster the contention, recently made most vigorously by author Sam Harris, that religion is, and has always been, the most effective vehicle of mindsets that lead to senseless violence. Terrible ideologies and ""leader worship"" sometimes come in secular form, but history and any daily newspaper both show that nothing creates dangerous zealots like the idea that one is doing ""the Will of God"" on your way to heaven.

In the case of the People's Temple, Jim Jones skillfully combined his charisma with a Christian/socialist ideology - a devastating mixture long before the final Kool-Aid was prepared. But without his Pentecostal training, his ability to claim the authority of God (indeed, to be God), and without the concepts of heaven and hell, his reign would very likely have ended far sooner and with far fewer than 909 deaths.
The physicist Stephen Weinberg said, ""With or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion."" I would add only the words ""almost always"" before the words ""takes religion.""",1177459200,10,5423,5.067264573991031
2747510,5,B000MTFFUO,"Two films came out this year on Jonestown, the Discovery Channel, ""Jonestown Paradise Lost"" and ""Jonestown: The Life & Death of Peoples Temple."" The former presented actors in segments and this was a true documentary.  This was a horrific time in the history of the Bay Area when one week after Jonestown both Mayor George Mascone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were shot and killed.  The great tragedy in both events was the good intentions that caring people can make to change the world and the vicious response to such an effort.  The people of Jonestown shared a vision of a world free from racism and the coming together of loving people for a united good.  What happened to them during those years of declining paranoia from the demented mind of Jim Jones is by far the most compelling part of this Greek tragedy.  I knew a woman who met Jim Jones and was recruited to go to Guyana. She was like many of the residents, a Black woman, religious and elderly. Her family did not go and they were spared. There were many people recruited to go to Jonestown. Most turned it down. I think many who went were either lost to the cause or so entwined in the thinking of Jim Jones that they could not see the storm ahead. To gain a deeper prospective, read ""Deadly Poison,"" by Deborah Layton. This film gives an excellent overview on a very complex subject and I feel it is an excellent introduction to those who were too young to know about Jim Jones or were somehow not aware of this tragedy. I might add that I was in a cult for a short time and it is unbelievable how easy it is to be sucked in and I am not a weak minded person. Isolated and removed from any outside perspective, it is no wonder that they did what they did.  I do think that the most horrific deed in this horrible event was the act of a mother, who was in the capital Georgetown, and who slit the throats of her three children and then her own.  She was not even there but she had come under his spell.  All in all, quite an unbelievable story.",1176163200,9,2010,4.327127659574468
2747511,5,B000MTFFUO,"Jonestown, Guyana tragedy is still one of those tragedies that scare and fascinate me at the same time. The idea of people willingly drinking cynaide kool aid and dying under the burning sun. This DVD edition of Jonestown does not do enough in my opinion to help understand the situation. Deborah Layton's book, Seductive Poison, helped me gain a better understanding of the absolute horrors of Jonestown and how Jim Jones evolved from a good willing minister to a monster. Cults don't just pop up overnight. Jim Jones reached out to the disadvantaged and vulnerable like a predator stalking his prey. Once he lured them under his spell, he stripped them of their dignity, their finances, their free will, etc. It was like he possessed his followers and controled their outcomes. They were beaten, humiliated, embarrassed, and mistreated. Some who left were considered traitors to the church and the cause. This documentary displayed men and women, black and white, who wanted a society where it was more family. Jonestown became an Orwellian nightmare by catastrophic proportions. Could it have been stopped or prevented? Cults like the Peoples Temple start off well-spirited. The people like the members here felt that Jim who was charismatic and charming the pants of anybody lured them into his web. Once under his web, you were robbed of everything that made you an individual. Jim Jones feasted on the souls and the minds of his followers like a drug addict which he later became. The last day was the most horrifying to see those images of people lying together after drinking the poison. Tim Carter, one of the few survivors, recalled his wife and child drinking the poison and dying. Another survivor recalled laying his wife next to her grandmother on the ground. On November 18, 2008, it will mark 30 years of that tragic day. We forget such tragedies like Jonestown and Pan Am 103. Maybe the American public needs to be reminded of these events to help our future. You have to beware people like Jim Jones. I would have liked to see Stephen Jones, his son, in this documentary. I was glad for the final montage of pictures of those who died. They were murdered. They did not go willingly. After all, many of the followers were simply exhausted. In the interviews here, I didn't realize that the People's Temple Members were overworked, exhausted, and felt guilty for being tired. Exhaustion especially by Jim Jones' orders were sheer torture. Imagine being up for days working for your church while Jim Jones lived like a king but yet his followers did the work and weren't rewarded by him. Layton writes a lot more in her book which I recommend since it brings us to understand how she fell for him like so many other followers. Their loss is our loss in America. A third of the victims were children on November 18, 1978. I was five years old when it happened. I'm still haunted by it. I'm still shocked that a congressman like Leo Ryan was gunned down and the guilt of his death was brought upon the members by Jim Jones. The lies of Jim Jones was just outrageous and hard to believe. Layton writes about the white nights that occurred when Jim Jones called everybody to the Pavillion. The brainwashing was constant and lack of contact to the outside world was non-existent. Deborah Layton was one of the lucky ones to get out but she didn't forget the others including her brother who survived and her mother who died a week before Ryan's visit. They didn't mention Sharon Harris who was one of Jones' righthand zealot followers who killed her three children and herself in Georgetown only because Jones ordered her too. The others didn't in Georgetown that included his sons. There is still so much and there was that haunting letter telling us to keep investigating this tragedy to prevent another one. We are foolish to think that we can't be fooled when we know that smart, intelligent, wise, people are equally fooled as everybody else. Jim Jones was a master predator because he sought people who were vulnerable, insecure, ignored, etc. He preyed on their insecurities, isolation, abandonment worse than any predator could do. He robbed so many people of their lives, their homes, their finances, their health, their minds, their souls, and finally in the end, their lives. By the time, Jim Jones orchestrated his revolutionary protest or the mass murder at the pavillion, he had their souls and minds. Their bodies were just the shell that was carrying them around. It was Jones who dictated what they ate, heard, saw, etc. by then. He created a hell on earth that he masqueraded and sold as paradise. When the people came into Jonestown, they had no idea that it was really based more on the concentration camp during World War II. Only in those camps, people had more freedom than they did in Jonestown.  Because once you entered Jonestown, there was no way out. We must not forget the lessons of Jonestown even now as if it was distant history.",1176163200,17,4971,4.7735191637630665
2747512,5,B000MTFFUO,"I was in the eighth grade in 1978 when the Jonestown massacre took place and remembered it well from nightly newscasts. I remember how preachers used the Jones tragedy as a cautionary tale against the dangers of cults. The late 70s were a time of mass confusion after the traumas of the 60s, Vietnam, and Watergate, and a lot of these confused people were looking for direction.

This DVD does an excellent job of using archival footage and the recollections of survivors of Jim Jones' sickness and lunacy (including his African-Americn adopted son Jim Jones Jr.). To their credit, unlike most followers of cults and similar movements, no one among his former followers continues to defend him and all seem to accept the reality of how evil he actually was.

As the story goes on, one really feels for the poor blacks, elderly people, and assorted sixties misfits who fall for Jones' baloney. In most cases, its easy to mock the followers of such people as Jones as ignoramuses who should have known better, but to its credit, this film doesn't do that. It makes clear that most of these people were rejected by everyone else in society and Jones was the only one who appreared to acknowledge their humanity, thus they fell for him hook, line, and sinker to where they were convinced to worship Jones instead of God. The scene of Jones telling a cheering crowd not to believe in a God they could not see is really frightening.

The testimonies of former followers to Jones' sexual preversion and vile public sexual humiliation of his flock is truly jaw-dropping. It is noteworthy to consider that he would not get into such antics until long after he convinced his following of his false divinity. All of course led to the ultimate tragedy of convincing his followers to move to a remote outpost in Guyana, South America, and to commit mass suicide.

The Jonestown tragedy has receded in public memory due to the many events in recent history that have eclipsed it, but as Elijah Muhammad's biographer Claude Clegg correctly put it, ""In times of crisis, charlatans fare well."" This film serves as a timely reminder for succeeding generations to understand the dangers of surrendering one's mind to charasmatic ""leaders"" and false prophets. Check out Matthew 24:24 while you're at it.",1176163200,27,2283,4.831202046035806
2747516,5,B000MTFFUO,"This is horrible but necessary history. The Jonestown story gives us insight into the disastrous shadow of religion... That it is vulnerable to cult leaders and to people who want to give over the heavy burden of individual responsibility to a cult leader. I think religious leaders should be required to view this video.

2747522,3,B000MTFFUO,"--I was completely engaged in this movie. However it failed to answer many questions. The DVD extra interviews helped answer some questions. So I started to read online and found the disturbing ""death tape"", now in mp3 format, and listened to the entire harrowing recording, about 30 minutes. [Search for FBI No. Q 042]. Now I understand much more. The main question the filmmaker failed to address was the motivating philosophy of Jones. But the tape makes the philosophy clear: socialism/communism. This was a glaring omission in the film. Here are some quotes from the tape the filmmaker left out: ""Don't do this, this is not a way for a socialist communist to die."" Jones was referring to parents letting their children scream while they forced the poison on them. And one member said: ""No better way to give my life for socialist communism... His [Jones'] mother was the advent god of socialism.""

--The filmmaker never discussed what is ""revolutionary suicide"", and never discussed who the Red Brigade was. I was shocked when members had guns and started shooting Ryan's delegation. The movie never prepared the viewer that Jones had a ""Red Brigade"" with guns.

--In my opinion the filmmaker wanted to completely avoid the socialism/communism motivation and in so doing made a movie full of holes as it is impossible to understand what happened without this.

--However, I do highly recommend this film and am grateful to the filmmaker for making it.

--A few more disturbing quotes from the tape:
""Children it will not hurt, if you'll be quiet."" ""I don't care how many screams you hear, you will be glad to be going over tonight."" ""Adults, stop this nonsense, quit exciting your children when all they are doing is going to quiet rest. Don't do this anymore. Your exciting your children. Hurry.""

Update:
This film made me interested to learn more and since learning more I lowered the rating to 3 stars. The production value and interviews were great, but the filmmakers purposely omitted key facts about the communist, marxist, socialist agenda of Jones and how he got his followers to go along. Yes he was a mad man, yes he was progressive, the film did show this, but they should have also shown the real point of what he was trying to do. This is why, for example, they were calling Russia on the final day, they had tried to secure entry there to live as communists.",1365811200,5,2379,4.7926829268292686

2747537,4,B000MTFFUO,"This is a very graphic documentary about Jim Jones and the church he assembled called People's Temple. The film follows the story of the beginning of the church to the tragic end with commentary by surviving church members. Commentary is also offered by members of the media who were present on that fateful day at the airstrip when gunmen attacked them as they tried to board an airplane to leave.
There are many parts that contain the actual voice of Jim Jones spewing his propaganda. I wouldn't call anything I heard sermons or preaching. It seemed like a lot of brainwashing on his part to me. The trickery he employed using miracle healing is discussed and shown. It was mentioned often in the beginning by multiple people that there were a lot of things going on behind the scenes, but nothing was mentioned about how Jones was sexually manipulating a lot of the women. I was surprised about that, since I have watched other documentaries that put a great bit of emphasis on that aspect of what happened. Jones' drug addiction was talked about some, but the main focus was on how many people died. It is very graphic in depicting the reality of the mass suicide.

2747539,3,B000MTFFUO,"This is a documentary. And because it was made almost 30 years after the massacre in Guyana, it has the perspective it needs. This has authenticity, and in fact one of the survivors interviewed was Deborah Layton, author of ""Seductive Poison,"" which I have read.

Photographs and videotape of the actual People's Temple is interspersed with comments from the survivors and from others with knowledge of the events. I lived in San Francisco when all this was going on, and I was a bit spooked to see familiar-looking faces in those pictures. Of course, they were not necessarily people I knew, but people I had passed on the street, or perhaps saw at some public gathering. Mayor Moscone, who was given major support in his campaign by Jim Jones and the Temple members, I had met. He spoke at Hastings College of the Law where I was a student just a week before he was murdered.

The survivors are all a good bit older now, and you'd think that nearly 30 years would give them ease from the pain. But at least a couple of the men had their wives die in their arms before they ran into the jungle to live. Congressman Ryan's secretary was injured, and only survived by pretending to be dead, as did one of the cameramen. These are people who were sufficiently traumatized that they cannot talk about that final day even now without wiping tears from their eyes.

This movie one goes all the way back to what is known of Jim Jones' early life, the foundation of the People's Temple in Indiana, the move to California first to Redwood Valley near Ukiah and then to San Francisco. It recounts the activities of the Temple in San Francisco that had so many people convinced it was a wholly benevolent organization.

Some of the big faith healing scenes were captured on video, and one of the survivors mentions one of the most spectacular healings was of a lady in a wheelchair who was persuaded to get up and walk, and actually ran up and down the aisles of the church. Matter of factly, she relates that she later found out the woman in the wheelchair was actually one of the secretaries of the Temple, and the healing was faked. This is consistent with Deborah Layton's explanation that she and a couple of other young women had the assignment of finding out who had what problems by visiting them at home, asking to use the bathroom, and recording what medications were in the medicine cabinet.

The survivors also recount the deterioration of Jones' mind, his raging paranoia, his bizarre attitudes towards sex, and a host of other things that were kept from the public but became much more evident once he moved to Guyana. But at the end, we still don't really understand. ""How could one man persuade 900 people to commit mass suicide by drinking cyanide-laced Kool-Aid in the jungles of Guyana? . . . this film tries to answer that question . . . "" says the cover. Yes, it tries to answer it, but does not altogether succeed. I think only those survivors really know what it felt like to be involved in the social experiment that was People's Temple and Jonestown. ""We were there for peace and social justice, for what felt like a family to us."" It sounds so hippie but also so inadequate to explain. ""Why?"" is still an unanswered question for me.",1336867200,,3248,4.564322469982847
2747540,3,B000MTFFUO,"There are 2 polarizing views when it comes to historical analysis of Jim Jones and Peoples Temple. On the one side are psychologists and the anti-cult movement, who view Jim Jones as a sociopath/megalomaniac and openly criticize Peoples Temple for it's destructive cult practices dating at least as far back as its time in Ukiah, California and possibly Indiana. Then there is the other side, the Pro- New Religious Movement (NRM) scholars and people that tend to paint a positive picture of Peoples Temple and its social activism, and view Jonestown as a Utopian vision that merely went wrong in the end.

It's important to keep in mind that this film was made in collaboration with Rebecca Moore and Fielding McGehee, who run the Alternative Considerations of Jonestown website at San Diego St. University. Although their site is a great resource for documentation of Peoples Temple & Jonestown, Moore and McGehee are known to be firmly on the side of the pro-NRM movement (and as the sister of 2 of Jones' closest aides, Moore can hardly be relied upon as an un-biased source of information).

Although this film does try at times to present a balanced view of both sides, it is clear that it glamorizes the utopian vision of Peoples Temple and leaves out many key facts about its many disturbing and illegal practices, especially in the Ukiah years. For instance, there is no mention of the 1972 series of articles by the San Francisco Examiner and Indianapolis Star that exposed Jim Jones as a fake and described Peoples Temples' practices of psychological cruelty toward its members, its financial improprieties, its infiltration of local government and its general terrorizing of the Ukiah community. The film supports the misconception that the 1977 New West magazine article was the first public expose on Jones and PT, and that is simply not true. If not for the long line of California media and politicians siding with Jones and covering up the evil side of PT, the Jonestown massacre could have been prevented, and that is not addressed at all by this film.

There is literally no mention of the word ""cult"" or any distinct analysis of the mind control techniques used by Jones and his henchmen to control the individual lives of Temple members and not allow any dissention or defection. Interviewing experts on cult leaders and cult behavior would have given the film more balance and informed the viewer that despite the good intentions of its members, Peoples Temple was in practice the very definition of a destructive cult.

What worries me about this film and other more recent analysis of Peoples Temple and Jonestown is the revisionist history that seems to going on, whether it be by religious scholars praising PT as a legitimate ""new religion"" while brushing aside its long history of cultic practices, or the mainstream media's sensationalist portrayals of a madman who simply commanded his ""robots"" to commit suicide.

2747543,5,B000MTFFUO,"In each article, tv special or book about cults, Jonestown can't be missing. The cult with the largest number of victims in recent history is something to be studied and why many people still believe in those false prophets is not exactly a mistery, but not enterely understood.

Reading about sects and cults all over the world is good information to avoid of joining one. In the case of People's Temple, leaded by Jim Jones, there were many things that the people inside couldn't see as an obvious alert, like someone said ""you don't want to get out because you don't even know you're in"", if you don't see the smoke is because is your building that's on fire.

The aspects about what a leader is are all in Jim Jones, charismatic, charming, articulated, and able to manipulate the most people he wanted. Now, the difference between a leader of a religion, (the pope, a priest, rabbi, etc.) is they represent an authority inside of a religion, if one of them die, there will be another one. In the case of the leader of a sect, they don't represent god, they ARE gods. In the words of Jim Jones ""If you see me as your friend, I'll be your friend, if you see me as your father, I'll be your father, if you see me as your god, I'll be your god"" They don't tolerate anyone who's against them and take all critics as a personal offense to them, like a betrayal.
About the followers, mainly is people who's looking for something, maybe is in troubles, sick, unemployed or facing a personal crisis (a divorce, a death, a difficult disease)

The dvd is highly recommended, the whole evolution of Jim Jones since he was a kid obsessed with religion and death to the beginning of People's Temple (full of ""miracles"" made by Jim Jones), to their move to Guyana and the unavoidable death of his followers is something worthy to be studied.

How can we know we're facing a cult? If the group demands important changes in your personality (change of clothes, the name, the way of talking or thinking). If the group affects the relation you have with the family, friends, colleagues or couples or the entire world (""the rest of the world is evil..."" ""the family and friends don't really love you, etc.""). If the group demands work beyond the human strenght (lack of food, sleep, excessive work), massive confessions, ""bomb of love"". If the group demands a ""proof of faith"" with acts that are against moral or common sense.

A cult can be destructive only if you let them.",1304380800,,2459,4.5542986425339365

2747558,4,B000MTFFUO,"Jonestown / B000MTFFUO

I would hazard a guess that the hardest aspect of making a documentary is picking and choosing which material makes the final cut. It's obviously impossible to condense every intriguing detail of the life of Jim Jones and the history of his ill-fated church into a documentary format that won't exceed a length of a couple of hours.

Although the subtitle of this documentary is ""The Life and Death of Peoples Temple"", ""Jonestown"" would probably be more accurately subtitled as ""The Life and Death of Jim Jones"". A decent chunk of time is devoted to Jones' early life and childhood, all of which is interesting, although the portions on his early life as a preacher start to feel a little drawn out and focus, in my opinion, a little too hard on the black/white aspect of Jones' churches. (Numerous interview subjects say things like ""Jim was really a black preacher"" and ""The Temple was a black church"" and while I understand that these statements are meant to partly convey the unusual integration of the temple as well as the worship style in particular, the narrow scope on race relations in the church seems unnecessary especially since it is not particularly surprising that a disturbed megalomaniac would welcome anyone willing to contribute to his empire, regardless of race. Then again, I can see how this revolutionary aspect could be fascinating to some viewers, depending on your specific historical interests.)

As interesting as Jones' childhood and early career are, by necessity that focus on the 'early years' means that less screen time is devoted to the inner workings of the Peoples Temple in its heyday. This is, in my opinion, the documentary's greatest failing - a lot of amazing and shocking information is dispensed rapidly through the middle of the documentary, leaving as many questions as answers. What are we to make of assertions that Jones' insisted he was the 'only heterosexual man' on earth, and that he was sexually involved with the majority of his congregation, regardless of gender? I would like to understand how that worked without many of his lovers becoming jealous or disillusioned; for that matter, I would like to understand why more of the heterosexual, married men didn't find this particular trend a basis for concern. And then there are details like the 'strip board meeting' scene that simply boggles the mind that apparently Jones' influence was so strong that no one walked out of that meeting then and there. Or perhaps they did - most of the 'long' interviews are with ex-cult members who survived the massacre; it would be nice to hear from some of the people who left early on and to understand why they did so.

Also of interest is the aspect that the elderly members were encouraged to deed all their property to the temple, in exchange for free assisted living... which was then provided by temple volunteers, allowing Jones to pocket 100% profit - some details on how many people and how much money was involved would be highly interesting.

Don't let my criticisms deter you from watching ""Jonestown"" - the documentary is fascinating, and I learned a great deal about the Peoples Temple thanks to this effort. The production is wonderful and the interviews, voice-overs, and scene cuts are all done very skillfully - this is definitely a high quality documentary. Surprisingly, the tone of the documentary seems fairly neutral and sensitive and refrains from openly or excessively criticizing Jones or the temple members, preferring to let the evidence speak for itself, rather than descending into a morality play, and I do appreciate that - it's nice to see a documentary allow the viewer to come to their own conclusion rather than trying to force an author viewpoint (evil/deranged/sick/misunderstood/victim/etc.) onto us. My only regret is that this documentary couldn't be longer, but since one of the interview subjects has also written a book on the subject, I take the documentary's informational gaps as incentive to read more about this tragic event.

The film is interesting solely because of its subject matter, not because of its presentation.  The documentary ends up being very superficial, covering things in a very quick, piecemeal way, and there is precious little new information that I haven't read and/or seen before.  The only thing that I didn't know was that Jones's church was one of the most integrated churches during its time (with a mostly black congregation), and this caused much consternation during Jones's time in Indiana.  The interviews are interesting and sad (many of the subjects lost relatives in the massacre), but there's nothing particularly new here, and for such a fascinating, tragic subject, you'd figure the filmmaker could come up with more material.

2747560,4,B000MTFFUO,"Jonestown: The Life and Death of the People's Temple (Stanley Nelson, 2006)

Thirty years later, it's still hard for me to wrap my head around the monstrosity that was the People's Temple. Stanley Nelson's documentary does a pretty good job of explaining the how of it, using extensive footage of the Temple and interviews from survivors, But I just can't grasp the why. (I'll attempt not to turn this review into a diatribe against religion, so if it seems a little sketchy, that's why.)

Rather than focusing on what most know of the People's Temple-- the events of November 11, 1978-- Nelson (Sweet Honey in the Rock: Raise Your Voice) goes back to the beginning, examining the life of Jim Jones as he started his small church in Indiana, tracing it through its various moves, and finally ending up in the small South American country of Guyana. Nelson wants to get at what it was about Jim Jones that made him so charismatic, and he does a pretty good job of it. Jones comes off scary, but that has far less to do with Nelson than it does with the fact that it's impossible to look at Jim Jones and not know what's coming; the guy was slick and persuasive, and it's pretty easy to see how he ended up with as many congregants as he finally did.

2747563,5,B000MTFFUO,"""Jonestown-The Life and Death of The People's Temple"" is the best of the documentaries about Jonestown available. It is less sensational than the ""made for TV movie specials"" I have seen on this subject. ""Jonestown"" contains great footage of Jim Jones preaching and children singing ""Welcome"" in the San Francisco location. As with most PBS documentaries, the information is presented in a straight-forward style, without commentary or question. Most important to the documentary are the interviews with Jonestown survivors. Their stories do the most for explaining what happened and why they were drawn in to the church.

But this documentary has a lot of holes in it. Many of the deepest questions that remain about Jonestown are not answered by this documentary. The interviewer does not ask one survivor to explain his/her escape. One interviewee explains how he was next to his wife and baby when they were given the cyanide flavor-aid. His wife died in his arms. From that point you never hear what happened to him or how he escaped death. Another survivor says a kid bumped into him, fell to the ground and died. He then comments ""then he knew it was real"". But we never hear how he gets away if there were people with guns keeping him and everyone else in.

Curious about these unanswered questions, I went digging around on the net and was very suprised at the information I found. The most illuminating piece of information available is something called the ""Jonestown Death Tape"". This is a tape of the temple meeting after the Senator was killed. If was released, with 900 other tapes, by the FBI last year. You can listen to the tape on many sites, or you can read a transcript. On the tape, temple members discuss the death of the Senator with Jim Jones for about 45 mintues. I was always under the impression that most people were coerced into killing themselves. Amazingly, most peoople profess to being happy to die. One lady even stands up and asks that her child Teddy be given something now and she will be satisfied. Many members express disappointment over the white people that deserted with the senator's group. The desertion makes them doubt their noble experiment in equality and race relations. Many people say they have no life back in San Francisco. They tell ""father"" he gave them the best days of their lives. You can also hear the full exchange between Christine Miller and Jim Jones that is mentioned in this DVD. Christine Miller is not immediately shot down when she brings up her questions about Russia on the tape even through the interviewees in this documentary state that she is.

Despite the morbidity, the tape is a good thing to listen to before or after you watch ""Jonestown"". The death tape addresses the questions left unaddressed by the Jonestown DVD, but be warned that it will leave you with other questions unlikely to be answered until all information about Jonestown is declassified.  For example, Jim Jones makes statements on the tape that leave you wondering if the victims found with gun shot wounds or needle marks weren't given them after voluntarily drinking cyanide so that Jim Jones could make it seem like he and his followers were attacked and be viewed as martyrs. We'll never know because autopsies weren't performed on the bodies. And many people on the tape mention 1200 people being in the temple that day. What happened to the other 300? How did the 16 escape? Why does Jim Jones whisper to his assitant that ""they only have 40 minutes left""? The questions go on and on.

Be warned, the tape is not for the faint of heart. It contains the clear cries of children dying while temple members discuss their situation. But you will hear how and why 900 people died in Guyana that day. Amazingly, they weren't bullied. A lot of group mentality took over. Also, you'll hear clear parallels between Jonestown and Waco. You'll hear Jim Jones telling his followers they are in a ""compound situation"" and everyone decides they are willing to take their own life rather than face attack. From there it's not difficult to imagine what happened at Waco. Both Waco and Jonestown came under scrutiny because of custody battles.

8171948,5,B000MTFFUO,"The film unfolds chronologically and covers the formative years of Jim Jones' life and the birth, rise and eventual demise of the People's Temple. The story is told through interviews with the surviving members of the People's Temple, their family members and the survivors of Congressman Leo Ryan's ill-fated trip to Guyana. The director of the film forces us to look at the People's Temple on it's own merits and set aside the preconceived notions we have regarding the ""mass suicide"" and the tired notion that the members of the church were cult members who enthusiastically drank cyanide laced kool-aid to ascend to heaven. The former members of the church come off as enlightened idealists who were searching for a life with meaning in a society that ignored them because of their poverty or the color of their skin and they found their champion in Jim Jones. This film doesn't ask questions and answer them; it provides you w/ information and you are forced to disseminate it yourself. We get to see Jones for what he was: a father, a political power broker, old time preacher, son of a dysfunctional family, molester, savior, integrationist and killer. The camera doesn't pass judgment on history it just records it. This documentary fills in the gaps of a story that we thought knew. The music, archival photos and film footage used are amazing.

8171949,4,B000MTFFUO,"I recall watching a documentary on Jim Jones on the Discovery or History channel (I forget which one), and my father telling me that he actually remembered the ""Guyana Tragedy"" being on TV back in 1978. I enjoy researching things, so naturally I started doing some research on this Jim Jones and his self-named ""Jonestown"", today known as one of the largest mass murder/suicide tragedies in American history.

Having done some searching on Jim Jones, this is what I've deduced: he was raised in a very dysfunctional family; he had an obsession with religion and death as a kid; he found solace in the Pentecostal church; he became a revivalist preacher; he became a charismatic ""faith healer"" to a Temple of hundreds of weekly attendees; and he led his ""children"" to their ultimate and tragic end.

I don't want to get into Jones' life too deep, because if I do, then there isn't any need for you to watch this DVD. Having said that, some people like to view Jones and his Peoples Temple as movement with great potential that went wrong near its end, but I must disagree with that. I personally believe there were problems with this movement from the get-go. Jones was never particularly interested in Christianity or spreading God's Holy word, but instead used religion (what he called ""Apostolic Socialism"") to spread his communist views to people (like him) that couldn't find acceptance in society. From my own personal view on this Peoples Temple movement, there always seemed to be a sense of ""darkness"" in the air, or this is the vibe I get from the interviews with former Temple members and videos of the Temple's services. Jones was a dictator-like figurehead that controlled the lives of his followers, rendering them unable to think for themselves or to have contact with their loved ones.

Getting away from that, I will discuss the documentary itself. It is informative, but flawed. At a running time of nearly 90 minutes, one thinks that there could have been a little more information put in some where. Some of the places seem to drag, and, in all honesty, there really isn't enough information here to fit into a hour-and-a-half of film. Had these events been assembled in a better way, this documentary could have been more entertaining and perhaps could have fitted into an hour. This isn't to say that the information here is pointless or anything like that, I just feel that some of the information was ""stretched"" to make this thing longer. If you're interested in Jim Jones, his Peoples Temple, or the tragedy that was Jonestown, this is undoubtedly a very good watch. However, be warned that some places throughout this lengthy documentary might begin to bore you. Recommended.",1479340800,,2701,4.854663774403471
