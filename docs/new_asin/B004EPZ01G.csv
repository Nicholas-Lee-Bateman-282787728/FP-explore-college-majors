4346177,5,B004EPZ01G,"Dolphin Tale is a movie that will warm your heart (and have your child asking if they please have a pet dolphin at home!  It is based on a true story and begins with an injured dolphin (nothing graphic is shown) who is rescued by a marine hospital. The discovery of the dolphin, named Winter, couldn't come at a better time for Sawyer, a young boy who has just said goodbye to his beloved older cousin Kyle. Kyle has been called into active duty, leaving Sawyer feeling alone and discouraged. However, it isn't long before Sawyer and Winter form a special bond.

Without many friends and missing Kyle (who also is somewhat like a fatherly role model to the fatherless Sawyer), the sweet and outgoing Hazel, is a welcome friend. She and her father, Gary, who is a marine hospital doctor, join Sawyer and several others in the effort to save Winter.

I loved the wonderful show of family unity in this movie. Sawyer, his mom, aunt, and Kyle are all very close. Hazel and her dad and grandpa are also close. When Kyle returns home from active duty with a severe injury, his family rallies around him. Friendship plays a huge role in this film and a doctor from the VA not only befriends those trying to save Winter, but also joins in the fight. Another thing I enjoyed about this movie was the positive light shed on homeschooling.

Winter becomes an inspiration to all, but especially those with physical disabilities. A little girl in a wheelchair travels with her mother eight hours to see Winter, thus opening an excellent opportunity for discussion of how we are to show compassion to others. Kyle, struggling with his depression from the life-changing injury he received, is inspired by Winter as well. Another great discussion topic of how we should always be mindful and grateful of what our soldiers endure just to ensure our freedoms.

I would highly recommend this movie for the entire family. It is a movie that will stay with you long after the closing credits! I have added this movie to my Mom-Approved Movie Listings on my Wordpress blog.

4346178,5,B004EPZ01G,This show is the best show that I ever seen it is an awesome video you should watch it you so see it.,1316995200,,101,3.4347826086956523
4346179,5,B004EPZ01G,"This was the best movie of 2011. It is dramatic, comedic, fun, emotional all at the same time, and does it all very well. It is very family friendly, appeals to kids very easily, also it appeals to adults very easily. It also has a strong pull for veterans and disabled people. People can relate to a dolphin with a prosthetic tale and the main character's cousin who comes home from war with a disability.
The acting is top notch. I have to say the young lead, Nathan Gamble, really stuck out as the best of the bunch. He acted every scene and every line, and every expression to the 't'. He has a bright future as an actor and will have no problem becoming as well known a star as his co-stars are now. Morgan Freeman was his usual fun and endearing self with a whimsical twist. Ashley Judd was very good as usual. The other young co-star, Cozi Zuelsdorf, made a very good start with her debut role, and should succeed should she choose to go on acting. Harry Connick Jr. was a fun character and made his usual top notch performance, he even got to flex his musician muscles for a scene. Winter the Dolphin who plays herself will even captivate your attention with her own unique personality.
Also the cinematography was grade-A outstanding!!
This movie is a hear-felt, fun, dramatic and inspiring movie. People may compare it to other aquatic-themed movies, but once they've seen it, they will agree it stands apart as unique and wonderful.
I would give this movie a 20 out of 10 but this site won't let me. So 10/10 all around, especially for young Nathan Gamble!",1316908800,2,1567,4.5017543859649125
4346180,5,B004EPZ01G,"I cannot wait until this movie is available on DVD.  We just got home from the theaters minutes ago and I immediately signed up to get notification for when the DVD is released.  A movie definitely worth watching again and again.  A true ""FEEL GOOD"" movie.  What an amazing cast too!!!!  My kids enjoyed it as well (13 & 10).",1316908800,4,325,4.35
4346181,5,B004EPZ01G,"This is one of the most emotionally powerful movies I have seen in a very long time!  5 stars does not even begin to cover it!  Based on a true story, young dolphin ""Winter"" faces impossible odds to live without a tail.  My only hope is that I can provide a review that is worthy of this beautiful story.  I saw this in the 2-D version and it was outstanding!

The movie opens with a few minutes of beautiful underwater shots and dolphins swimming in what appears to be their natural habitat.  Then we see commercial crabbers dropping their traps and ropes. ""Winter"" plays herself in this powerful heart-centered movie about love, caring, and perseverance.

We flip over to learn a bit about young Sawyer (Nathan Gamble), a very quiet, keep-to-himself young man about age 12.  Champion swimmer cousin Kyle tries to bring young Sawyer out of his self-imposed closet, but it just ain't happening. Then Kyle joins the army because they will pay his way through college and Sawyer is soon to be without his big-brother type cousin.

While riding along South Beach, Sawyer approaches a beached dolphin, tangled in ropes and dragging a metal crab trap.  Her tail and mouth are bloody and the ropes are tightened around her tail.  Dolphin and boy bond immediately as he begins to cut the ropes that bind her, while making short whistling noises to answer her dolphin sounds.  Dr. Clay (Harry Connick Jr) and young daughter Hazel are among the Clearwater Marine Hospital folks who arrive quickly and take the little 3-month old dolphin in and try to save her tail.

Dolphin rehab begins to take effect when Sawyer sneaks into the Marine Hospital to see how his new friend is doing.  Then, Kyle is injured during his active duty tour and he reminds us what some of our men and women in the service go through when they return home and must adjust to permanent changes in their lives.  We begin to watch lives intertwine and healing begin in many ways as folks are touched by something special and wonderful.

Ashley Judd plays Sawyer's mom (Lorraine) and Morgan Freeman plays Dr Cameron  who helps soldiers with prosthetic devices at the Veteran's Hospital. Kris Kristofferson plays Harry Connick's dad.  Rufus (named so because he lives on the roof) the pestering pelican provides comic relief throughout the movie.

Through the tears, fears, and worries, I found some laugh-out-loud moments throughout the movie, laughing so loud I thought someone was going to tell me to shut up!.  There is also play time between the boy and the dolphin.

The real Winter was rescued from Mosquito Lagoon (near Cape Canaveral) and now lives at the Clearwater Aquarium, in Florida.  She lost her entire tail and two vertebrae and wears a prosthetic device, as many humans do.  She is an amazing lesson to us all about determination, adjusting to life's changes, and perseverance -- about taking the lemons and making lemonade.  Her lesson is also about how amputees and disabled children can be encouraged by an itty bitty dolphin who has overcome all the odds.  The gel sleeve developed for prosthetics in this story is said to be in use today.

This charming movie touched me at the soul level.  I urge you to take your children, and yourself, to see it - then buy the movie to watch over and over again. It has powerful lessons in it!  Keep your tissues close by.)

Oh, and hang out for some extra tape right after the end of the movie.  Looks like it is probably photos of the real rescue and folks in the actual story.  You can also visit winterstail.com and seewinter.com for more information.",1316908800,15,3576,4.719354838709678
4346182,5,B004EPZ01G,"A must see movie. It covers so much the soldier, handicap, the rejected,the importance of being where God sends you in life, the love of animals etc.etc. Very inspiring and touched every sense, laughter, tears, suspense and love:)",1316822400,3,230,5.078947368421052
4346183,5,B004EPZ01G,"This is the perfect movie for families, especially homeschool families for a number of reasons...

1. It features HOMESCHOOLING beautifully.
2. It is a family movie (nothing graphic). Yes it is implied how the tail is damaged, but it is not shown.
3. If you are or know someone with disabilities...This movie is for you/them!!
4. This movie shows how a child, when given the ability to follow his dreams without being told ""that is NOT possible"" will accomplish the impossible.

This movie is based on a true story and will tug at your heart strings so bring some kleenex. ;)

4346439,5,B004EPZ01G,"This movie can be watched over and over again if your children enjoy a thoughtful movie that focuses on friendships, finding a passion in life, and overcoming adversity.  The movie is rated PG and there are other places on the internet to get a list of why it is PG but in general the images of animal injury/disability is the main reason.
Villains:  One of the best parts of the movie is there is an absence of mean people that either scare children or are ridiculously overacting and repulsive for adults to watch.  I will refrain from a spoiler but it is physical and economic adversity that is the real 'villain' in the movie.
Kindness: Believe it or not, this movie has all sorts of people being kind to one another.  No snooty kids or adults
Friendship: great friendships that will carry over to the sequel.....",1494201600,,817,4.575342465753424

It is truely amazing and a really wonderful relation between a so called animal and us sometime stupid and cruel humans!  But not in ths case!  More like Dolphin SafeTuna?
I have swam/swum with Porpoises in Key Largo FL and you would not believe how incredibly intelligent they are!  Dolphin's Plus, in Key Largo caters mainly to helping autistic children with incredible results.  The Porpoise have senes far beyond us mortal humans!  Their brains a larger than us.  Before we could go in the water with them the women were asked if anybody was pregnant, everyone said NO!  Dolphin Plus would not allow pregnent women into the water with them!  What had happened in the past was, a women who didn't know, went into the water with them.  Instantly the female porpoises swam under her and defended off the males, protecting the woman!!!

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,,1188,4.8088235294117645

I love that it is based on a true story, where a group of people got together to help a hurt dolphin.

4347959,5,B004EPZ01G,"You know, I'm the kind of guy who likes my meat and potatoes.
I also like action movies with occasional science fiction thrown
into the mix.  Romantic comedies?  I don't have the time for them.
Movies about a dolphin?  Not something I thought I would ever
place into my Blu-ray player.....

But you know what?  Call me a softie if you must, but Dolphin
Tale is one of the most truly moving films I have seen in a long
time and I'm not ashamed to say, it tugged at my heartstrings.

Inspired by a true story, this is a film about a dolphin named
Winter who is found on a beach after being tangled in the ropes
of a crab trap.  Among the people who discover the helpless
dolphin is a young, shy boy named Sawyer (Nathan Gamble)
who has been mostly withdrawn since his father left home many
years before and whose cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell), a champion
swimmer, has just left for tour in Afghanistan.

When Winter is rescued and brought to the Clearwater Marine
Hospital, Sawyer is immediately drawn to the hospital staff which
includes a young girl named Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) and her
veterinarian father, Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick, Jr.).  As
the young boy and Winter quickly connect with each other, his
Mother (Ashely Judd) is discovering her son becoming more
social as he realizes his dreams coming true.

Sadly, Winter's tail becomes infected and must be amputated
leaving only a stump in her rear.  At the same time, Sawyers' cousin
Kyle, injured in war, returns home in a leg brace unwilling to face
his new future.  It is at the local VA hospital where Sawyer meets
Dr. McCarthy (Morgan Freeman), whose specializes in fitting amputees.
McCarthy agrees to fit Winter with a prosthetic device to help her swim
again.  However, with funding running out at the Marine Hospital,
it looks as if Winter's own life hangs in balance.

Dolphin Tale works so wonderfully on so many levels.  At its heart,
it's the story of bonding between a boy and mammal.  At the same
time, the film gives real inspiration to individuals affected with
physical disabilities -- many of whom we meet during the closing credits.

This Blu-ray sports an immaculate transfer that shows off an
impressive amount of perfectly clean, razor-sharp detail both
above and below water.  Colors are solid and black levels look
acceptably rich.  The fact that 95% of the film is shot outdoors
and under well-lit underwater conditions makes it an especially
pleasing experience to watch in 3D thanks to its exceptional
level of depth.  It's a little hard to describe, but there is a sense
of ""layering"" where in-between the foreground and background
objects, rays of sunlight or splashes of water exist on their own
levels.  It doesn't just immerse the viewer into the story -- it
makes the viewer feel part of the story.  All of it feels incredibly
natural and this is one the few times I have really appreciated
3D for what it's meant to be, sans the abundance gimmickry
that I usually crave.

Still, young ones should find themselves delighted with the
few 3D gimmicks that do exist here.  At the start of the film
we are treated to some beautiful underwater ocean photography
featuring playful dolphins, fish and a sea turtle that seems to
float before our eyes.  Though the effect is not as dramatic as
Imax: Under The Sea, it still should garner ""oohs"" and ""aahs""
from viewers old and young.  Not much else after that other
than the beak of a pelican that jabs itself outward from time
to time.  I'm rather surprised to hear myself say this, but I am
happy that the filmmakers didn't push the envelope on gimmicks.
The basic level of depth the 3D provides makes this film a far
more engrossing and intimate experience for the viewer over
its 2D counterpart.

And guess what?  Not one bit of ghosting to be seen anywhere,
including the few darker interior scenes.

The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is up to the task of
providing a perfectly smooth, flawless sonic presentation.
Mark Isham's heartwarming score is conveyed across the
entire soundfield with amazing definition given to the strings
and woodwinds.  Though a tad on being front-heavy, there
is quite a bit of surround activity particularly in the underwater
scenes and poolside whistling of Winter.  Dialogue is always
clear and intelligible.  The dynamics of the soundtrack is perhaps
best demonstrated during a sequence involving a tropical storm
where viewers become suddenly enveloped in windswept rain
accented with powerful LFE bass.  In all, a very pleasing soundtrack.

Dolphin Tale arrives as a 3-disc combo package that includes
3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, DVD + Ultraviolet Digital Copy.  Ultraviolet
allows you to watch movies at home or on-the-go, using streaming
or permanently downloaded copies on devices such as smartphones,
PC's and in the near-future Internet connected Blu-ray players and
TVs.  The discs housing is enclosed in a lenticular cardboard sleeve.

Extras on the 2D Blu-ray disc include:

* Animated short about the legend of Rainbow Bridge,
narrated by Harry Connick, Jr.
* Behind-The-Scenes look at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium
in Florida
* See how the filmmakers created the underwater opening of the film
in 3D
* The true story of Winter's rescue and creating her prosthetic tail
* Ormie and the Cookie Jar animated short
* Additional Scene and Gag Reel

Dolphin Tale aptly fits the definition of perfect family entertainment.
In fact, it's been a long time since I can remember watching anything
as wonderfully inspiring as this film.  The 3D does an amazing
job of making the viewer feel part of the action without resorting
to a barrage of gimmickry.  In fact, I am going to be placing this
film somewhere on my list of the best 3D titles currently available.

4352316,5,B004EPZ01G,"My husband and I were able to visit the Clearwater Marine Hospital before we knew about the movie at all. It was amazing. We found out about the movie while we were there and watched ""Dolphin Tale"" afterwards. We enjoyed the movie very much, knowing it was based on a true story and because we had seen Winter in person, in action, as well as meeting the caring staff and the good that they do for hurting sea animals and the effect on children and adults who also have some disabilities. Inspiring!

The acting, the script, the sets (the real beach and the real hospital), and the original footage of the rescue) were terrific. We showed the movie to our grandchildren and they loved it, too. It really drew them in. They were impressed when we told them we were standing right there, seeing Winter and other special animals in person.

We also enjoyed visiting Winter's Dolphin Tale Adventure, which is close by. Admission is free with a ticket to the Clearwater Marine Hospital, and you can take a Trolley or a boat ride to the site. Here is a description from their website:
""Experience the Movie, Relive the Tale! Following the success of Dolphin Tale, we expanded in downtown Clearwater with a new facility that gives you an immersive, behind-the-scenes experience of this heart-warming movie.  Winters Dolphin Tale Adventure provides hands-on experiences for children, a comprehensive overview of Winters prosthetic development, an up-close look at rebuilt sets with actual movie props, an interactive Hurricane Experience exhibit and a large retail shop full of unique gifts for all ages.""

We love the movie, loved our visits to the Hospital and Adventure, and love the area.  We hope to return with our grandchildren someday.",1422489600,,1735,4.907849829351536

4352318,5,B004EPZ01G,"I had never heard of this movie until I recently picked it up in a movie bin at a store.  Inspired by the true story of Winter, a dolphin that had been found off the coast of Florida with an injured tail, it is the story of her rehabilitation at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.  It has an all-star cast, including one of my favorites, Morgan Freeman, who is as fun to watch in this movie as he is his others.  It is, as I said, a feel good movie, and one that both adults and kids will enjoy.",1422489600,,492,4.0

The dolphin loses its tail because it had been tangled in a net for too long a time, cutting off circulation to the tail.  it is amazing to see how adaptive the dolphin is at swimming without a tail, but it is learned that the dolphin is doing damage to her vertebrae and the prognosis is death.  The boy and the vet who saved Winter's life, work together along with a doctor who created prosthesis for war veterans, to create a tail that will work for Winter and allow her to swim as other dolphins do.
