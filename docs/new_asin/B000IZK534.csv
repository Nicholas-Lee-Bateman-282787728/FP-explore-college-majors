2664382,5,B000IZK534,"Being from the UK, Qi is a show I've followed from the start, unfortunately the BBC hasn't released the series digitally. If Amazon could get the BBC to release all series on their video service I'd buy every one of them now.",1353024000,11,225,4.380952380952381
2664383,5,B000IZK534,"Fantastic series!  I wish ""D"" and beyond would be released.  A perfect combination of comedy and wit that entertains & educates like no other quiz show I've seen.",1336262400,4,162,4.75
2664384,5,B000IZK534,"Why this funnny, & intellectually entertaining show is not available in the US is a mystery. May be the reason Americans really are as dumb as they look.",1294272000,11,153,4.5
2664385,5,B000IZK534,"Great Q&A panel comedy series that takes on the mundane and intellectual in one breath - and that is unreasonably unavailable in the U.S. in this age of technology. If the corporations can't get together on universal formatting, what hope is there for world peace? Catch snippets on YouTube.",1283904000,25,291,4.959183673469388
8148041,3,B000IZK534,I'm from the United States and these DVD's refuse to play in my DVD player. Very sad,1502409600,,84,4.0
8148042,5,B000IZK534,"Why can't American TV do anything this intelligent, convivial, and zany? If you like to think and like to laugh, QI fits the bill. I just wish these shows aired in the US. Until then, I'll keep buying up whatever QI series are available on DVD. And, no, you can't borrow my copies. I'm not letting them out of my sight!",1439683200,2,319,4.245901639344262
8148043,5,B000IZK534,"Love this show. I just wish I could get the others seasons of it.

Love Alan Davis and Stephen Fry.",1415836800,,99,3.95
8148044,5,B000IZK534,"Fantastic! As a US fan, this saves me from having to use my internet bandwidth to watch QI. My only problem is that I'm almost done with the DVD, and am about to go into withdrawal until I can get the next order. Educational and hysterically funny...",1406073600,,250,4.340425531914893
8148045,5,B000IZK534,"I have a regions free DVD player, so was very happy to find some QI on DVD.  I have access to the series via the internet, but I enjoy having the subtitles available on DVD, so my husband, who has a difficult time with the many different English language accents, can follow along without too much difficulty.

The program is witty, chock full of excellent players, and sometimes a bit ribald, but always Quite Interesting!",1399766400,,423,4.626666666666667
8148046,5,B000IZK534,Cannot wait to order the second season!!  Roll on payday so that I can satisfy my craving.... love this series!,1398124800,,111,4.55
8148047,5,B000IZK534,"This is the funniest and most informative show I've ever seen. And sadly because of region locking, there is no legal way to see this show in most of the world.

Can we get some region free BluRays? Add the show to Amazon Prime or Netflix? Something?

Why does the BBC not want my money?",1396396800,3,287,4.2
8148048,5,B000IZK534,"While visiting family in the UK, I was introduced to this BBC game show and IMMEDIATELY became ""hooked""!!!!  I have had more than my share of ""withdrawals"" upon returning to the USA. The Jordie dialect was difficult to understand, but other panelists were easily understood. I laughed and learned while watching QI. WISH WE HAD IN USA!!!",1395014400,3,337,4.912280701754386
8148049,3,B000IZK534,Series is okay -  I didn't quite know what to expect and ordered this series based on recommendation of a friend. We like Stephen Fry very much as an actor but will stick with his portrayal of characters in other roles.,1393372800,,219,4.341463414634147
8148050,5,B000IZK534,"Frankly put, this series is one of the best: part game show mock format and part comedy. The show is intelligently entertaining and most times hysterically funny. The comedic guests and Stephen Fry are brilliant. Highly, highly recommended.",1388448000,,240,5.342105263157895
