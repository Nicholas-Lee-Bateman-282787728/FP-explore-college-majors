6567674,4,B00MBNRPT8,"Get On Up (2014 release; 138 min.) is a biopic of James Brown, similar to what the movie Ray did for Ray Charles. As the movie opens, we are in 1988 where we see the beginnings of an out-of-control James Brown (the infamous police chase follows later in the movie), but before we know it we are thrown back to 1968 where Brown is set to perform for the troops in Vietnam, and minutes later we find ourselves in 1939, where we see him as a 6 yr. old dealing with his troubled parents. And with that, we are off to a whirlwind of scenes for the next 2 hours. To tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, Chadwick Bosemans performance as James Brown will floor you. He has every move (dance, or otherwise) down to the last detail, and surely he will get an Oscar nomination for his performance. Boseman carries the movie on his shoulders, so to speak. Second, the movie thrills and delights most when it is focused on the music, in particular the live performances are irresistible. Check out the 1-2-3- punch late in the movie of ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine,"" ""Super Bad,"" and ""Soul Power"", which are brought in the movie as one long medley, and I could barely contain my itch to get up in the theater and to start dancing! (Check out the excellent soundtrack for the movie, where these songs are of course in their full versions.) Third, going to the theater, I noticed the movie is PG-13, which surprised me, given the subject matter (Brown's life was anything but PG-13). Alas, the producers for the most part have treated James Brown with a velvet fist (unlike what Brown did himself, arrested multiple times for domestic violence).  Fourth, while I am not saying that a biopic needs to have a chronological story path, I do not understand what the writers and director of the movie were trying to prove with zigzagging us around from one era to another, non-stop for the entire movie! Just dizzying, if nothing else. On the other hand, I thought that using the lifelong friendship between James Brown and Bobby Byrd as the lynchpin for the movie worked quite well. Last but certainly not least, being in Cincinnati, I am very happy that the movie paid its proper respects to the huge role played by King Records in the first decade of Browns illustrious career. To think that the Godfather of Soul recorded so many songs right here in the Queen City, its just amazing.

I had been eagerly looking forward to the opening of this movie. The matinee screening I saw this at this weekend here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not super-great. If you have a passing interest in James Brown, or in US music history in general, I'd suggest that you check out ""Get On Up"", shortcomings and all, and draw your own conclusions.",1407110400,24,2856,4.5310077519379846

______________________________________________________

Through a rough upbringing and going on to inspire musicians around the world comes the story of James Brown, nicknamed the king of soul. From the director of The Help is Tate Taylors musical drama as it follows James Brown (Chadwick Boseman) as his fame skyrockets with his long-time friend Bobby Byrd (Nelsan Ellis) at his side. Having to depend on himself most of his life Brown faces challenges along the way that tests his relationships with those around him. What he never loses, however is his passion to sing and uses it to get through life.

Weve seen countless biographies; including this years Jersey Boys that followed Frankie Valli and his friends making it to the big leagues. A lot of the direction by Taylor is reminiscent of Clint Eastwoods film where they break the fourth wall and have conversations with the audience. What didn't work for Eastwood was that the attention surrounding the group in Jersey Boys hurt the film by just seeing the business side of it. In this film it comes close to James Mangolds Walk The Line where we got to see the rise of Johnny Cash through not just the business side of it, but the affects it had on his family as well. So in essence we get a taste of both worlds in Get On Up that really make the film work.

The main performance by Chadwick Boseman as James Brown was perfect as he inherits the charisma that made him famous. We were able to see two stories going on side-by-side in that one had Brown as an adult and the other while he was a child. As he rose in popularity there were hurdles that brought back memories of his mothers abuse by his father. Never having a close relationship with either one, Brown had to channel his anger by singing through his pain. Towards the films end we see Brown and his mother, Susie (Viola Davis), confront one another about why she left him when he was young after not being able to take the abuse any longer. It wasn't until then that we saw true emotion from Brown as he broke down from years of neglect.

Advertised as a drama the movie also presented a great number of musicals along the way. Showcasing again the true talent Boseman possessed to play tribute to one of the greatest singers to live kept the viewer hooked in. The supporting cast of Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis do not disappoint; considering their previous work where they play estranged characters in difficult times. Their performances may not match up to their roles in The Help but they do have a presence thats hard to overlook.

There were times when I struggled to understand where James Brown was coming from in his rise to fame. We kept seeing flashbacks of when he was a kid and how it was impacting him as an adult but the narrative wasn't tight enough to blend the two worlds together. The film felt a little too long as the pacing suffered with the narrative between both plot threads. More attention could have been placed on Browns mother Susie after coming back into her sons life so by the films end it wouldnt seem rushed.

With the direction of Tate Taylor, Get On Up is full of soul that almost touches that of his work in The Help. Certainly not perfect all around but definitely does the job with Chadwick Boseman taking the lead. The movie is energetic with amazing musical work that added to the art of the film.

6567676,5,B00MBNRPT8,"Here we have (finally!) the thrilling biography of a musical icon. Director Tate Taylor (""The Help"") brings us a familiar rags to riches (to rags to riches...) show business story that describes the life and times of James Brown (1933/2006), one of the most influential musicians in recent history.

Here are some of the top-notch actors:
  * Chadwick Boseman (""42"") as James Brown, a dirt-poor survivor of a brutal childhood, part of it spent in a brothel. His gospel roots helped launch him into the spotlight where he soon learned how much money went to the middlemen. Watch his reaction when they ask his permission to book an unknown band, ""The Rolling Stones,"" to open for one of his shows. BTW Mick Jagger is one of the producers of this movie.
  * Nelsan Ellis (""Lee Daniels' The Butler"") is Bobby Byrd, a stalwart friend who understands ""Mr. Brown.""
  * Dan Aykroyd (""Tammy"") is Brown's cagey manager Ben Bart, who describes himself as, ""A lucky old Jew.""
  * Viola Davis (""The Help"") Susie Brown was a teenager when she gave birth to James. She knew nothing about marriage or babies and had no job skills to survive on her own. To say he is conflicted about her is a mild understatement.
  * Octavia Spencer (""Snowpiercer"") Aunt Honey can see that little James has no one to believe in, so she urges him to believe in himself.

Expect some violent situations along with PG-13 profanity, a mild car chase, a bit of drug use and one ""F"" bomb, but LOTS of performances from Paris to Cincinnati, studded with the dazzling footwork and trademark wail we associate with James Brown. Boseman must have worked long and hard to master THAT one; he is amazing!

It's fun to watch the music businessmen try to grasp the appeal of this rebellious master of funk. His only value to them is his money-making potential. He understands that each person has his own area of expertise; for example, he doesn't advise the Army how to fight the war in Vietnam and he suggests that they not tell him how long his concert may last. (And that successful record company executive can NOT do the Mashed Potato, but he sure can sell records!)

You will like the occasions when Brown shares his beliefs: Once with his son's classmates and another time during the concert that was held (over the mayor's objections) the day after Martin Luther King Jr.'s death. After traveling the highs (stardom and acclaim) and the lows (drug use and jail time), the screening audience was pumped! Amazon will notify me when the DVD is released.",1406851200,16,2513,4.681818181818182

There is no way to make a true biopic of the man that gave us everything he had and expected no less from his band or fans. Condensing his amazing life into 150 minutes must have been an epic challenge for all involved. What amazes me is they were able to convey the same feeling you got from seeing him live. Chadwick Boseman nailed his performance and quite frankly this movie succeeded at doing what James Brown was a master of- entertaining!!!

6567734,5,B00MBNRPT8,"I felt they really put a lot of effort into making this movie.  Digging into James Brown's personal life as well as professional.  And they did it articulately.  Lately, especially in the last couple of decades, in making movies of this genre, many directors assume that much of the subject matter (artist they document) that their personal life is irrelevant and spend little time filming it.  I think one exception is Milos Foreman's Amadeus.  So, there are some slow parts of this film that are somewhat lackluster but for the most part, it was a great effort on all parts especially Chadwick Boseman's performance.  I have seen this movie a few times so it makes an impression.",1497139200,,681,4.777777777777778

I thought it jumped around too much with flashbacks and the backstory. So much that the movie didn't flow very smoothly.
The acting was pretty good, but the script was weak. Chadwick Boseman gave an adequate performance, but it was mostly imitative of JB's bluster. Viola Davis tried to portray Brown's Mother sympathetically, but I think her part must have suffered in the editing.  All in all, the movie was just OK.",1484006400,2,579,4.79

I appreciate the brotherhood and love he showed and kept between him and Bobby, Mr. Byrd.
A couple of awesome fellows. I just wished he would have played 'I Lost Someone . . . '
Much Love Mr. James Brown! I Pray that you are with The Lord!

6567785,4,B00MBNRPT8,"Luckily, the personality and life story of James Brown is interesting enough to overcome the bland structure of flashbacks precisely where any audience would expect them to be.  I didn't realize he came from such a terrible background.  It makes his guts, tenacity, and hard work all the more inspiring.  There are a million ways he could have ended up without the right bandmates, musical venues, and record labels necessary to maximize his talents.  Once he got the first wave of success, there were a million ways he could have sunk back into obscurity.  This was a man fully convinced of where he should be, and even more importantly, the drive to keep proving it to others.  Even during his peak years, I still much prefer the music of Miles and Ray.  But I can't help but admire the stagecraft, passion, and drive to make the most of his basic formula.",1472256000,,858,4.642384105960265

6567790,3,B00MBNRPT8,"I have mixed reviews about this movie. The music is great and the leading actor (Chadwick Boseman) did a great job play the Godfather of Soul. It's just that the lifetime of James Brown was jumbled up in the movie, meaning that the sequence of his life didn't go all that smoothly. It didn't progress in one straight continuous line from his childhood right into his adulthood, so to speak. It kept getting off track, like a train. But it does have funny moments too.",1470528000,,467,4.5058823529411764

6567813,5,B00MBNRPT8,"This movie introduced me to the amazing talent, Chadwick Boseman. I mean really! What an actor! I am a really tough critic when observing any form of art and Chadwick had me reeled in from the beginning. I thought I was watching the real James Brown. That's how unbelievably he portrayed the character. The look, his voice, his dancing, his demeanor, everything was on point. You can tell he did his homework and I will definitely support his future endeavors. Actually, because of his A+ performance in this movie, I bought ""42"" where he portrays Jackie Robinson. Can't wait to see how he pulls that off.",1465603200,2,605,4.716981132075472

If you've not seen it you are really missing a masterpiece which takes you on a journey through the life of Mr James Brown , who I had the pleasure of meeting & opening for in the early 1990's at a festival I played . His personality is nailed in this as is the music & the evolution of ""The Funk"" . He was intense , brilliant , imperfect (as we all are) & a fascinating super-talented person & if you like his music you will LOVE this movie !!!

6567818,3,B00MBNRPT8,"While this depiction of the life of the music legend James Brown was welcomed and long overdue, it was disappointing the this tremendous ensemble of actors was limited by the condensation and homogenization of his story. Often stories that explore the lives of people who become legend after overcoming overwhelming odds eliminate so much of the hatred and negativity of the society that the viewer has no real appreciation for the fortitude and determination it took to overcome the horrible stench of racism and bigotry in the deep south during the majority of James Brown's career. While the biopic does expose some of the violence Brown's unleashed on those closest to him, it excludes much. On the other hand, the incident that sent him to prison appears to grossly misrepresent what actually happened (I lived in the area at the time and followed the story closely).",1465171200,,872,4.97945205479452

8671478,3,B00MBNRPT8,"As a huge James Brown fan I was dissapointed. I feel like they shrunk this giant and that Chadwick wasn't the best choice for James. Not to down play Chadwicks talent he just was stiff and made Jame mannerism seem awkward. The people who produced this movie should have looked harder. I also didn't like the tone of the movie. It wasn't epic or dramatic enough like What Loves Got To Do With It, which is a classic. James deserved a movie like that. I don't feel like James was celebrated in this movie. This movie almost made a joke or caricature if James. I give a 3 instead of a 2 because I respect and like Chadwick, and also because I had fun listenin to James music during it. This movie should have been big like Malcolm X or Ray, but it wasnt, they dropped the ball.",1532563200,,774,4.236486486486487
