7810421,5,6301247086,"This is far and away one of the most astonishingly stupid 80s horror films ever made.  It will have you laughing from beginning to end.  The performances are across the board terrible and cringe inducing.  Dean ""The Dream"" is one of the greatest douchebags in the history of cinema.  For trash fans, highest recommendation.",1408492800,,323,4.925925925925926
7810422,4,6301247086,"The 1987 film Twisted Nightmare is about a group of seven couples who receive invitations to Camp Paradise from a mystery person.  After there arrival at camp it becomes obvious that this isn't going to be the fun vacation they had expected.  You see one of the quests is the sister of a retarded boy named Matthew who was burn't to death a few years earlier at Camp Paradise.  The sister blames her friends for her brothers death and she is the one who sent out the invitations to the quests and she is out for revenge.  The sister has summoned Matthew back from the dead to kill all the quests. Mathew is now a long nailed, shaggy haired sharp toothed monster man with a deformed face and wearing a long trench coat.  This is definatly a B movie but I love 80's slasher movies and I love the name of the movie Twisted Nightmare.  Not the best movie I've ever seen,but it is 80's slasher fun and I think it deserves a DVD release.",1392595200,,931,4.291428571428572
7810423,1,6301247086,"Dumb, terrible film obviously deserved the 5 year shelve-away because of the poor acting, poor editing, poor direction, poor script...basically, poor everything. The plot, or what little there is, is the story of a retarded boy who was burnt to death two years ago at Camp Paradise and has been summoned up from the dead by his sister to kill all her friends, who she felt were responsible for her brother's death. Sound familiar? This film is so incredibly bad that when I watched it with two of my cousins, we cried laughing so hard. This is one of the cheapest (if the not the cheapest) slasher flick of all time. It's the first movie that I've ever seen that has a full grown man screaming like a small toddler girl! Also, why is this movie so incredibly 80's as compared to other slasher movies? Everyone has a mullet or some kind of bad hair, and they all drive the same, beat-up car! Excellent for a stomach-contracting laugh, but terrible for a decent scare.",1075593600,4,966,4.557471264367816
