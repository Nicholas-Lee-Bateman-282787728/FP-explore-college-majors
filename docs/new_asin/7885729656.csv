I am often disappointed by the hype of fans of silent films; however, Sunrise will not disappoint you.  In 1929, it won the first Academy Award for Best Picture although it was called the Academy Award for Unique and Artistic Production at that time.

2691632,5,7885729656,"This is a stunning and absolutely essential Masters of Cinema release of F. W. Murnau's iconic silent masterpiece Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927). No. 1 in this fine company's catalog, the film has justifiably always been high on Top 10 lists of greatest films ever made and in this incarnation the film sparkles as never before. Alas, a 1937 fire in the Fox studio vault destroyed the original negative and a new one had to be struck from a surviving print. This means everyone has been deprived of seeing the film in its full pin-sharp glory for the last 75 years. The version (actually two versions) offered here is as fine as we are ever likely to have. MoC present the film on 3 discs. The first disc has the initial release Movietone version, the 'standard' one that everyone knows. The aspect ratio is 1.20:1 and comes with the option of two soundtracks - the standard Hugo Riesenfeld compilation of Romantic classics from Liszt through Wagner to Gounod (in Mono), and a more recent highly effective score composed by Timothy Brock (in stereo). The second disc has a version found in the Czech Republic which has an aspect ratio of 1.37:1. The film is cut by about ten minutes and has Czech supertitles. However, the visual quality of the print is astounding, far better than the Movietone version even if the same Mono soundtrack has been added to it. My personal preference is for the Movietone version together with the Brock default score. I wish the print could be as sharp as the Czech version, but feel a slight sacrifice in visual quality is justifiable in view of the film's apparent completeness. Murnau's fastidious visual style combining long languorous takes and exquisite painterly compositions with skillful montage and superimpositions is substantially clipped by the Czech version. The marvelous long trolley car journey into the city is an unforgivable loss as is the cutting of most of the Summertime montage at the beginning. Virtually every shot is chopped of a frame or two and the expressionistic titles which move to suggest emotion are gone. I doubt very much if Murnau would have been happy with this version. The third disc offers both versions on Blu-ray. Not having a Blu-ray player I can't comment on it, but other reviews here praise it highly.

MoC support their release with a barrage of highly interesting extras. The commentary (both on the Movietone version and on outtakes) is by John Bailey. A noted cinematographer who operated the camera for Nestor Almendros on Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven (a loose reworking of Murnau's next still extant Fox picture City Girl), he has a lot to say about Charles Rosher and Karl Struss' astonishing cinematography, if not so much about Murnau's direction. Of outstanding interest though is Janet Bergstrom's excellent 40 minute updated documentary reconstruction of 4 Devils (1928). Inexplicably lost, it is said to be one of Murnau's most outstanding achievements and with a mixture of production stills and drawings Bergstrom guides us through what looks to have been a wonderful drama set in the circus world of a family trapeze act and with yet another love triangle (again involving Janet Gaynor). As well as the usual trailer there is also a decent booklet with articles which cover the film restoration, but again with no hard information on Murnau. The way William Fox plucked Murnau away from Germany by offering him absolute control over his films and the way this control was subsequently withheld as the studio tampered with every film after Sunrise, leading eventually to Murnau's flight to the South Seas to make Tabu (1931) and his eventual tragic early death in a car crash at the age of 41 makes for a fascinating story which could and should have been told here, if only to stir public interest in both City Girl and Tabu - outstanding films which barely register in the public consciousness today. No matter, I shouldn't complain. This is still a generous issue which needs to be in every film collection worthy of the name.

So what makes this film special? Most critics will point to the sheer originality of the work. Coming towards the end of the silent era, William Fox wanted something new for the American market and decided on Murnau's brand of expressionism. He didn't want another American picture. He wanted a German one which would really seize people's imaginations in a radically innovative way. Therefore though Sunrise is Murnau's first American film, in essence it is as German as Faust (1926) or Der letzte Mann (The Last Laugh,1924). An adaptation of Hermann Suderman's German short story Die Reise nach Tilsit (A Trip to Tilsit) by Austrian Carl Mayer, the only Americans involved in the film apart from the Fox studio technicians were the actors, Karl Struss (of German extraction) and Fox himself. The film was shot on the Fox backlot at amazing expense with exteriors done at Lake Arrowhead, California, and yet we never feel we are in America. The city is left deliberately unnamed (as are the three central characters) and could be anywhere. Interiors (a farmhouse, a city caf, a church, a barbershop, a photographer's studio, the amazing Luna Park funfair) are close to the German Weimar republic ones as shown in earlier Murnau and in Fritz Lang's German films, showing typically shadowy lighting and angled perspectives achieved by raised floors, optical illusions and even the use of midgets in crowd scenes. Exteriors (especially the buildings around the lake) look Austro-German. The influence of Austro-German Romantic painting of the 19th century (Arnold Bcklin, Casper David Friedrich, even Egon Schiele) is particularly striking as per the German expressionist remit. The Dutch masters also exert their influence as shown by numerous languorous studio shots which are Rembrandt-lit (John Bailey) exquisitely. The use of light sources is radical especially in the farmhouse scenes which depict the Man's tortured conflict. The length and the sheer sophistication of many of the camera set-ups in which the camera moves (The Woman from the City's night walk, The Man's famous swamp tramp, the trolley car ride into the city, the entrance into Luna Park, the storm) just hadn't been seen in American films before, Fox continuing the radical modernity of Der letzte Mann in particular with stunning success. That film did away with intertitles and this one could easily exist without them as well.

After the film's staggering mise-en-scne, it's worth emphasizing the amazing sensitivity of the acting - Margarite Livingston as the vampish `Woman from the City' who distracts George O'Brien's `The Man' from his wife, `The Woman' played by Janet Gaynor. Of these it is Gaynor who really lights up the screen in one of the most astonishingly touching performances ever seen in the cinema. She desperately wants her man to love her and through his attempted murder of her on the lake, the escape away on a trolley car, the blind rush into busy city traffic, the gradual rapprochement with him via a caf scene, flowers and then a pivotal church scene wherein the couple renew their vows to each other, her performance is simply pitch-perfect. She makes the improbably swift transition from petrified fear to radient happiness seem so natural. Her celebrations during the central funfair sequence are never mawkish and when she returns with her man on the boat atop the moonlit lake we have a miraculous picture of Paradise Regained which feels entirely organic.

The splendid photography and wonderful acting are two things, but the key to the film's greatness really lies in its stupendous narrative structure, one of the most perfect in existence and one which is completely symmetrical. I have commented elsewhere on the amazing sophistication of Fritz Lang's Die Nibelungen (1924) and here we have the same extraordinary craft, but on a human scale. The film is in three parts denoted by the settings - the country, the city and the country again. Each scene from the outer parts is refracted in its opposite number either side of the city episode with the whole film pivoting on the Luna Park funfair sequence and the ecstasy of the couple's love reignited. To make things clear I offer the following overview which should be read bottom up as well as top to bottom:

Part I: The Country - Infidelity and planned murder
(a) Prologue: Summertime montage (gradual sunset)
(b) The Woman from the City has arrived
(c) The Man and Woman in crisis
(d) The nocturnal tryst between The Man and The Woman from the City
(e) The boat trip across the lake toward the city (attempted murder)
(f) The Woman petrified and burning to escape The Man
(g) The trolley ride into the city (anger and torment)

Part II: The City - Reconciliation and Celebration
(h) The caf (disharmony)
(i) The church wedding service (Man and Woman renew their vows)
(j) The barbershop / The photographer / the Luna Park funfair
(i) The 'wedding reception' dance (a peasant dance ""Midsummer"")
(h) The wine restaurant (harmony)

Part III: The Country - Fidelity and Love
(g) The trolley ride back to the country (love and bliss)
(f) The Woman relaxed and happy with the Man (sleeping)
(e) The boat trip across the lake away from the city (love and storm)
(d) The nocturnal fight between The Man and The Woman from the City
(c) The Man and the Woman in love
(b) The Woman from the City leaves
(a) Epilogue: The Woman awakes. The start of a new life (sunrise)

Within this strict symmetrical structure Murnau/Mayer build the narrative out of a series of binary opposites - sunset/sunrise, day/night, good/evil, sun/moon, corruption and sensuality/purity and innocence, country/city, rustic simplicity/urban sophistication, blonde/brunette, fidelity/infidelity, love/hate, sin/redemption and more. Murnau/Mayer not only balance entire scenes, but they carefully bookend each one with a powerful emphasis on the idea of fate, inevitability and the whole wheel of life moving around inexorably. Note the nocturnal tryst where the Man throttles the Woman from the City for suggesting he murder his wife balancing the corresponding scene near the end where he again throttles her. Then there are the reeds which the man prepares in the boat for his own safety which end up saving his wife. The funfair sequence begins and ends with the same shot, the couple walking past a giant fountain to be confronted by the extraordinary scene replete with rollercoasters only to walk back past the same fountain at the end. The man's search for the Woman is framed by identical shots of the Woman from the City lurking on a rock just above a path. A number of bookends exist in this film and repeated viewings reveal more of them. The film stays remarkably fresh no matter how many times you watch it.

Beyond this somewhat cold and schematic reduction of the film's narrative (one which perhaps is beter intuited emotionally than stated intellectually) lies a second structuring feature which I would argue is what primarily makes this film such a potent emotional rollercoaster ride. The film's subtitle, A Song of Two Humans guides us to the idea that the film is in essence music made visual. Murnau had already given us 'Eine sinfonie des Grauens' (a symphony of horror) in Nosferatu (1922) and here he gives us another three-part symphony, one on the scale of a work by the Austrian song-symphonist Gustav Mahler. Contrary to the classical tightness of Beethoven and Brahms, Mahler's huge symphonies seem to embody entire worlds and express extra-musical ideas/storylines. The 30 minute first movement of the Third Symphony for example is an extraordinary account of spring over-powering winter. His nine symphonies vary in structure, but they tend to open in total darkness and surge towards blinding light with a strong (often Adagio or Andante) opening movement (almost a symphony within itself) followed by one or even two jokey Scherzo dance movements, a tranquil Largo and then culminating in a joyous life-enhancing Rondo-Finale. Not all the symphonies follow this pattern (Nos. 3 and 9 end with astonishing slow movements of the most exquisite poise), but for the purpose of my comparison with Murnau, I would say that the structure of No. 5 broadly fits Sunrise. Mahler expert Henry Louis de La Grange calls the symphony, ""Dankgesang eines Genesenen"" (a song of thanks of one restored to health), an entirely apt possible title for the film! Like the film, the Fifth Symphony is in three distinct parts. A dark opening movement (marked Trauermarsch - Funeral March) is followed by a tormented violent Allegro (marked Sturmisch bewegt, mit grter vehemenz - stormy with gross vehemence). Part Two is a long and highly complex Scherzo movement full of dance and joy which acts as a pivot for the whole work. Part three opens with a miraculous Adagietto introduction which leads through stormy episodes towards a blindingly exultant Rondo-Finale conclusion.

Looking closer, the first part of the film (which in my schema conflates the first two movements of the Fifth Symphony) takes on the even larger scale of one of Mahler's other huge opening movements, perhaps the Adagio of the Tenth Symphony. After a quick and lively montage suggesting the city emptying of people (especially the Woman from the City), the film quickly settles into a series of long languorous shots which tell the story in the manner of a composer leisurely stating his themes, his first and second subjects, the development, the recapitulation and so on with the tension of the film building inexorably towards the blind madness of the murder scene. We see the Woman from the City first walk towards an assignation with The Man who is established as a farmer trapped in an unhappy marriage. Why he should be unhappy with his devout wife is a moot point, but every man will acknowledge the universal truism that Man cannot be married to Woman for a long time without his head ever being turned. The nocturnal tryst leads to the suggestion to murder his wife, his initial outraged reaction, but then his careful preparations for the fateful boat-ride in which he will push his wife overboard. Tension escalates as he is tortured by his desire for the Woman from the City - skillful superimpositions from Struss of the vamp embracing him as he works up the courage to suggest a picnic to the Woman. Then once the trip is underway the dog escapes his tether which forces the boat back to shore. The whole mood of the film up until this point has been of ever-deepening gloomy mental torpor as the Man gradually turns into a maniac looking like the Golem from Paul Wegener's famous 1920 feature. As he advances towards his wife on the boat in the middle of the lake she starts to pray. This is the moment in the Adagio of the Tenth Symphony when it bursts into an extraordinary atonal dissonance as the music structure is rendered asunder. So it is with the Man here, but he recovers at the last moment and (like the music) gets over his crisis. The Woman however is still shaken to the core and runs away from the Man. Just as that burst of dissonance can't let things settle completely in the music, so things can't settle for the Man. He pursues the Woman (the trolley car ride) and tries unsuccessfully to woo her with cakes and flowers. It is only when they enter a church and witness a wedding service that the Man shows sincere repentance for his sin and the Woman forgives him. They renew their marriage vows. The first part of the film ends on one the most amazing shots in film history as the couple wander out of the church straight into traffic which dissolves into a view of the country as they kiss oblivious to the traffic around them which they have brought to a standstill. It is typical of symphonic structure that the first movement ends in a recapitulation of the early main theme and just as in the Adagio, the first part of the film ends with a sense of circular completion.

The film's story in a sense finishes with the end of Part I. The Man has been reunited with the Woman, but of course the main subject of the film (the surge back to iridescent life) has yet to be told. This is also the sense we get at the end of any one of Mahler's opening movements. In the Fifth Symphony the hero is dead and is tortured by the powers of the beyond (conflating the first two movements), but in the second part of the symphony (the third movement Scherzo) he surges back to life with an unstoppable life-force. Just as the dance themes are numerous and complex, so in the film there are many strands of comedy/dance that work brilliantly together - the visits to the barber and the photographer and then the funfair. The funfair is an extraordinary polyphonic outburst which seems chaotic but which is carefully structured. As said the whole sequence is book-ended with the same shots of the couple entering/leaving past the fountain. Then there are two dances, one (a 'city' waltz) which the Woman looks at and then the other (a 'country' landler) which the Woman forces the man to take part in. In between there is an astonishing sequence as a pig runs loose in the fair. The animal upsets people, scares a waiter and even gets drunk. The close-up of the drunken pig's face is probably the very center of the film's symmetrical structure, underlining Murnau's true theme of the film - that life should be celebrated as a raucous crazy circus full of love and delight. It is perhaps significant that the couple perform an Austrian peasant dance (named ""Midsummer"") which is actually a lndler, Mahler's preferred dance form which inform all of his Scherzi. The composer/arranger Riesenfeld was astute in choosing the tune for the Movietone soundtrack (in fact, he had played the violin under Mahler in Vienna and had moved to New York in 1907, the same year Mahler began conducting seasons there - Jeremy Barham in his article ""Plundering Cultural Archives and Transcending Diegetics: Mahler's Music as 'Overscore'"" says, ""His score for F. W. Murnau's Sunrise: A Song for Two Humans (1927) is cast in a rich late-nineteenth-century idiom, its scenes in the city pleasure palaces offering an unusual tour de force in collage techniques of composition that conceivably derived much from a Mahlerian multidimensional musical aesthetic.""). The film's 'Scherzo' ends here on a sequence which is clearly designed as a kind of wedding reception, the dance complimenting the earlier wedding ceremony and ending the second part of the film on an ecstatic burst of adrenalin.

The tender (and much loved) strains of Mahler's Adagietto open Part III of the symphony and this could be said to echo the opening of Part III of the film with a comic/romantic restaurant scene in which cupids are superimposed flying around the lovers as they slumber love-sick at their table. This effect may seem mawkish now, but it is in keeping with the tradition of 19th century German painting. The scene comments ironically on the film's earlier dark caf scene as does the scene where the Man whisks the Woman onto the tram which counters the Woman's earlier headlong rush into traffic. The quiet still mood carries over onto the return trolley-ride and then most tranquilly of all onto the boat. Another peasant dance takes place in the distance to offset the feeling of Paradise Regained as these lovers reach out for each other. But of course that is not the end and as the Adagietto is only a prelude to the stormy Finale of Mahler's symphony, so this quiet scene is merely the quiet before the storm of the film. The Man had started the day wanting to kill his wife and now he must pay the price as hubris catches up with him in a violent storm which capsizes the boat and seemingly kills the Woman. The Man's grief is rendered extraordinarily effective by the shots of him scouring the lake, one of them having his face leer famously into close-up (one of only two close-ups to compliment the one of the pig!) as the boat carries him toward the camera. The business with the Woman from the City has to be tidied up (one of the themes of past movements which a Rondo-Finale must deal with) which involves a second night walk to parallel the first and a second throttling. Her death is averted by the news that the Woman has been saved by the reeds that were initially meant to save him and the Man and Woman are united for a euphoric conclusion, the sun rising on a new day and a new beginning for their lives. This is of course exactly how Mahler's Fifth Symphony ends with the hero miraculously brought back to life and the world set to rights on a glorious chorale. The film works in the end for me partly because of the amazing narrative structure, but mostly because the film appeals to the same senses that respond to music. We shouldn't forget that the greatest music is also structured with astonishing intellectual acuity to work its visceral emotional effect on the listener. Murnau here achieves the rare feat of creating a cinematic visualization of music which is as appealing to the intellect as it is over-powering to the senses. Completely satisfying in every respect, for me it is cinema's greatest love story, a truly glorious Song of Two Humans.",1435622400,7,21228,4.867533185840708

2691638,4,7885729656,"This is by far my favourite F W Murnau film and certainly ranks among my top 5 silent favourites as well.  We have a very good screenplay about succombing to temptation and about the subsequent redemption which will only fail to move the hardest of hearts having been so well acted out and directed.  Murnau shows just how important any film's director is in effectively telling a story and he does so masterfully here with various tools from his directorial toolbox.  He does this with relative constraint when compared with what was perhaps necessary on ""Nosferatu"" which as a supernatural film probably warrants all the jump cuts and stop-motion photography but we get nice fade ins etc here which move the story along very well and one doesn't get the impression of a director trying to show off.  As a mark of a truly great film this decades-old film makes me want to watch it over again and again.  Janet Gaynor must have delivered one of the all-time best female lead performances ever captured on film and George O'Brien wasn't that far off either.  This release comes with both the standard dvd as well as the blu-ray in both the Movietone as well as another European version.  The restoration effort is admirable given the state of the old master tapes but is not perfect understandably and so has many imperfections from scratches to some flaring although these do not happen often enough to detract from the overall viewing experience.

The picture was in b&w and was very sharp.  So sharp that I thought it was made this modern day with a twist to make it look ""classy ancient"" But the extras in the background looked so real with their real 1920s outfit, and with their look, I was starting to realize I am watching the real thing.
It's a silent movie, with caption and music.  So little was said, but the emotion was delivered in artful visual suspense.  So much can be expressed in a simple, earnest smile or a humble gesture of an eyebrow.  Never before did I see the ""roaring 20s"" in its best, with clear documentation of the way life was.  Yeah, they had the time of their lives, with great parties, booming cities, great opportunity for young people.  Shots of busy city streets, people at the fairground that made you feel like you're there in the 1920s.  This movie is a must to have in your collection.
The story is very moving, part cautionary tale, part praising the sanctity of marriage and family.  I came to know several married couples on the verge of divorce.  What held them still together is the fond memories of their relationship through the years, and the gratitude they have for one another pulling through thick and thin.

Among my favorites from the history of cinema would include:  ""The Best Years of Our Lives"",  ""The Good Earth"",  ""Marty"",  ""High Noon"",  ""The Time Machine"" (1960),  ""West Side Story"",  ""The Godfather Trilogy"",  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"",  ""Tender Mercies"",  ""Lonesome Dove"",  ""Blade Runner"",  and ""Saving Private Ryan"".

""Sunrise - A Song of Two Humans"" by F.W. Murnau might easily top the list.  This movie begs to be watched again, and again......and again.

To bad, most films today do not come close;  See my review of ""Gravity"",  the first film to draw us into the theater in 23 years.  What a difference between that over-budget lightweight and Murnau's complex and poetic masterpiece of almost 90 years ago - ""Sunrise - A Song of Two Humans"".

Here is some of the best acting ever (with or without words) in a setting that is is truly great art. The story is rich in layers, twists and ironies.

This movie can speak to so many people on so many different levels.
For me,  without spoiling the film for others,  the crisis point recalls Psalm 73.. Where Asaph finds his answer:  ""Then I went into the sanctuary of God...""
When a relationship is destroyed seemingly beyond repair, no one but Providence can bring about true repentance and true forgiveness.
Yet there are more lessons to be learned...
I don't know if that was Murnau's intent,  but great art will speak to the individual's heart.

The multi region DVD plays nicely. You may need to disable Korean subtitles in set-up, and,  by all means,  go for Murnau's original Movietone soundtrack.  It adds to the emotional power of the film.

See it, and you might just agree with Francois Truffaut,  that it is  ""..the most beautiful movie ever made.""",1394409600,6,2221,4.989041095890411
2691646,5,7885729656,"Is SUNRISE the greatest silent film ever made? Many polls consider it so but to me comparing it with a handful of other silents such as NAPOLEON or BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN or GREED (not to mention the comedies of Chaplin and Keaton) is like comparing apples and oranges. What is without question is that SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS (to give the film its complete title) is one of the greatest movies of all time sound or silent. The fact that we still have it is a miracle as the original negative was destroyed along with virtually all of the pre-merger Fox Films (except for Shirley Temple and Will Rogers) in a horrific warehouse fire in 1937. That is why there are so few Fox silents available. Fortunately more and more are being discovered in foreign archives like the John Ford film recently discovered in New Zealand.

A simple story of love, betrayal, and redemption is transformed and elevated into a work of art captured on film thanks to director F.W. Murnau and cameramen Charles Rosher & Karl Struss. There are so many things to savor in this film, such as the breathtaking cinematography in the village scenes which is reminiscent of the 17th Century Dutch Masters, the Bauhaus influenced set designs of the City, or the remarkable performances by George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor (who won the first Best Actress Academy Award), that trying to compile a complete list of them here would take up too much space. It is the first film to officially feature a soundtrack (as opposed to sound on disc) and is the only movie to win an Oscar for ""Unique & Artistic Production"". The first Best Picture award went to WINGS.

The new U. S. Fox Blu-Ray / DVD combo pack is a cause for celebration as it provides us with the best surviving American version which looks remarkable considering its age and history. It also comes with a Czech version of the European release (which is 79 minutes instead of 94) as well as valuable audio commentary and your choice of the original Fox Movietone soundtrack (which has been sonically remastered and sounds fantastic) or a newly recorded score by Timothy Brock and the Oympia Chamber Orchestra. There are also outtakes, the original script, and promotional materials as well. If you are truly a lover of cinema then you need to see SUNRISE and decide its status for yourself. Like all truly great films, it can be watched over and over again and that is the highest compliment I can bestow.",1393632000,19,2433,4.682242990654205

2691649,5,7885729656,"Sunrise is a remarkable film, thanks in large part to how relatable it is to the viewer. This all starts with the characters' namesor lack thereof. The Man. The Wife. The Woman From the City. These are characters who have no names and they don't need names because they are more than characters in a story; they are representatives of us all.

At some point in our lives, we have thought the worst was upon us. At some point in our lives, we have been in love and have watched that love wither. At some point in our lives, we have been the victim of someone else's ill intentor maybe we were the ill-intendingor maybe we were the other (wo)man. And hopefully at some point in our lives, we have loved and almost lost, yet found that love renewed again.

In 90 silent minutes90 minutes that simply breeze bydirector F.W. Murnau (1922's Nosferatu) beautifully captures all of that: the desperation of hopelessness, the sorrow of a dying love, the fear that all is forever lost, the hope for a better future, and the joy of a love renewed. And he does it not only without the benefit of dialogue, but with very few intertitles. He allows his direction to tell the story.

Murnau also allows the actors to tell the story. Livingston is fine as The Woman From the City. She plays temptress well, letting her looks and attire do a lot of the work. As The Man, O'Brien is mostly great, particularly when he is fearful his actions have lost him The Wife forever. His ability to convey desperation through only physical action is really quite good. When he's angry, though, he looks more like a zombie with a vicious underbite. The star of the picture, without a doubt, is Gaynor, who took home the first ever Best Actress Oscar for this, as well as for Seventh Heaven and Street Angel (the individual awards were more about an actor's body of work for the year). I've not seen those other two films, but I don't know that she needed them. Her performance is flawless.

The Blu-ray's 1080p transfer is excellent. A great deal of restoration has been done to the film and the disc really highlights that hard work. (This becomes particularly evident when you see some of the unrestored footage in the extras; the degradation is shocking.) The audio, however, is magnificentin glorious Dolby 1.0! To explain:

Sunrise is one of the first films to place sound on the film reelnot dialogue, but music and sound effects. This was called the ""Fox Movietone Score"" and it's what filmgoers heard when they saw the film in theaters in 1927. That's how I wanted to hear it. Speaking of restoration work, the clarity of the restored audio track is quite perfect, and the best way I can describe it is to quote the restoration notes, which says the goal of the restoration efforts was to ensure the sound was ""historically accurate and demonstrate[d] both the limitations and the potentials of this early sound process."" It succeeds and then some, which is surprising given the source limitations.

In addition to the film's original version with the Fox Movietone Score, the disc includes a new score by the Olympic Chamber Orchestra on a separate audio track in Dolby 2.0.

The best extra is the European silent version of the film, which is notable for two key reasons. The first is that the aspect ration is full frame 1.33:1, not 1.20:1 like its US counterpart. The reason for this is that the US version need the space on the film reel for the audio track. The other difference is that the European version was cut down to 79 minutes.

A multitude of other extras include commentary by ASC Cinematographer John Bailey on both the film as well as 10 minutes of outtakes. These are not outtakes of the humorous variety; these are scenessometimes short snippets of filmthat did not make the final cut, nor were they restored. Those same outtakes are available separately on the disc with text cards.

Onscreen printed works include the Original Scenario by Carl Mayer with Annotations by F.W. Murnau (39 images); the Sunrise Screenplay (102 images); and Restoration Notes (9 images). Rounding out the extras is the silent, 1:51 film trailer and a DVD copy of the film (both US and Euro versions). Unfortunately, there is no accompanying booklet.

2691650,5,7885729656,"I like most films of this time and Blu-ray (DVD Release Date: January 14, 2014) does it proud. I only watched the version that has the duel original European version and the Movietone versions (both silent with different inter-titles.) There are more expensive and intensive versions. One thing I found fascinating is that I try to get the screen play to various movies. This DVD version has the 130 page screen play built in.

This is not my favorite subject and I usually avoid movies of this type, of betrayal and redemption. I prefer ghoulies and ghosties. I also prefer war and peace or at least ""The Love of Jeanne Ney"" (1928). But because this film is a keystone in cinema it is required watching. I did see a part of this film prior in a survey ""The Story of Film: An Odyssey"" (2011) by Mark Cousins.

The film is based on a short story by Hermann Sudermann. ""This song of the Man and his Wife is of no place and every place; you might hear it anywhere and at any time.""

A marriage is threatened when the husband (George O'Brien) allows himself to go astray after being lured by a woman (Margaret Livingston) from the city. There are a few tear jerker scenes after the Husband almost dispatches his Wife. He does not see the error of his ways until he thinks he has lost his wife (Janet Gaynor,) does he realize who he really loves? Yes. Who does he blame for his mishap? The ""Woman from the City"" for leading him astray, as it was not his fault.

I did like the scene in the photography studio where they look for the lost head.

You definitely want to listen to the voice over commentary by Cinematographer John Bailey as it adds worth to the viewing experience. The commentary points out the obvious that is not really that obvious. You discover that it was filmed at Lake Arrowhead. Also you bet a different prospective on Murnau's life story. John Bailey does not know where the `Amon Carter Museum"" is located, but we can forgive him as he presents an excellent commentary.

Based on a Hermann Sudermann story, the plot is relatively simple. A peasant farmer (George O'Brien) becomes involved with a city woman (Margaret Livingston) and is persuaded to murder his wife (Janet Gaynor)  resulting in an intense emotional struggle. Though a Hollywood production, Murnau conveys a distinctly Germanic atmosphere, with superb cinematography by Charles Rosher and Karl Struss.

One version of the movie is the Movietone (US) version which is 93 minutes long, and the other version is the Czech version which is 79 minutes long. The Czech version is missing some footage, but it is clearer and has a higher resolution than the Movietone version.
The Czech version also has slightly more width (1.37:1) to the image compared to the Movietone version (1.20:1) which evidently was cut down a bit to incorporate a soundtrack back in the day when this movie was originally being edited. The two versions also have slightly different title cards with some of the Movietone title cards having an animated effect. It was common back in the silent era to film the same movie with two cameras side by side: one version was for U.S. distribution and the other was for Europe. It is likely for this reason that some of the footage may appear to be shot from a slightly different angle. The Czech version also has optional English subtitles. This is a UK release with all of these discs being playable on North American blu-ray players, however the dvds might not play on all North American dvd players.

There is an interesting full-length commentary by John Bailey on the Movietone version as well as some rare outtakes from the film.

I have loved this film for years, ever since I saw a mute Standard 8mm print that a close friend loaned to me.  Even with no music and not-that-great print quality, I fell in love with every frame of this film-I had first read about this film in the ""Joe Franklin"" book on silent movies (actually written by the great William K. Everson) and had wanted to see it for five years and was not disappointed one bit.  I have also had a Super 8 sound print from Blackhawk Films (from the Killiam Collection), a VHS tape from Collector's Choice, the DVD from Fox, an R2 2-disc set from Eureka! and now this Blu-Ray.

This simple story of a farmer, his wife and the woman from the city who has captivated him never fails to move me and dazzle me with the brilliance of Murnau's directorial flourishes (the incredible swamp scene, the trolley car ride into the vast city set, the wedding scene with the contrition of the man and the couple's renewal of their love, the amusement park sequence, the storm and the brilliant conclusion).  Carl Meyer's poetic scenario, the still gorgeous photography of Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, Hugo Riesenfeld's lyrical score (incorporating Phil Spitalny's ""The Enchanted Forest"" for the love theme)-skip the new score, nowhere near as beautiful and powerful-and the performances from George O'Brien, Janet Gaynor and Margaret Livingston and all the rest of the cast-just wonderful.

It looks like all the extras that are on the Eureka disc will be on the Fox one-do not miss the outtake reel-some nice alternate takes from the film and even a few brief flashes of Murnau on the set and what looks like a technical goof-up with the fireworks appearing to be moving out of position.  There is also a look at a film that I would kill to see-the 4 DEVILS, Murnau's next film for Fox which, sadly, appears to have been lost for many years.

This film did not fare very well commercially when it was originally released.  The critics loved it but even some that did felt more dazzled by the film's technical achievements than the story and characters and were not shy to say the same in their reviews.  One critic even awarded its acting award for the month ""to the camera in SUNRISE,"" which probably made your average moviegoer feel that the film might be too artsy for them.  Too bad-for this is one of silent cinema's and-I think-ALL cinema's most sweet, sincere and poetic love stories, and I am so glad that its reputation continues to grow as the years pass.",1383868800,4,2612,4.654347826086957

I feel that it helps the audience focus on the Husband, Wife and his affair with the woman from the city.  Janet Gaynor steals the show from George ""the chest"" O'Brien with her portrayal of the sweet, loving wife.  George has one scene where I tear up every time I watch this.  He plays the scene with such male regret that is almost palpable.

You are also shown how evil of the Woman from the city.  First, by the way they show her in black attire. The tendency to portray evil in dark images seemed popular in silents.  Then by the way she schemes to shed the man of his wife.

Margaret Livingston plays the hot chick from the city who convinces The Man to off his wife (Gaynor). I suspect this was revolutionary at the time, but played out in hundreds of films since.

2691663,5,7885729656,"Some films become instant classics. Others are not so lucky. 'As cold as the marble a sculptor uses', 'the sort of picture that fools highbrows into hollering Art', 'there is a not a heart-throb in Sunrise,' 'Mr Murnau's film is more than technically competent but woefully ignorant of matters of the heart.' There were good reviews too, more for it's ambitious technique than it's other merits, but Sunrise was generally regarded as a disappointment on its first release. It was quickly overshadowed at the box-office by Janet Gaynor's following film for Frank Borzage, Seventh Heaven and left a shadow over F.W. Murnau's Hollywood career, only finding an audience many years after his death and assuming its position as one of the great achievements of silent cinema many years after his death.

In many ways, Sunrise is the last great masterpiece of German Expressionist cinema. The cast and the studio may have been American, but those behind the camera were almost exclusively German (cult director Edgar G. Ulmer, who many years later would delve deeper into film noir with Detour, was one of the assistant art directors), having a notable effect on the look and feel of the film. There is little in contemporary American cinema to compare with it save King Vidor's less experimental but emotionally similar The Crowd.

At the time, Murnau was the hottest of the German Expressionist filmmakers, due to the international success of Nosferatu and, in particular, The Last Laugh. He was eventually wooed to Hollywood by William Fox, who put all the resources of his studio at his disposal. Surrounding himself with his favourite collaborators, most notably cinematographer Karl Struss and screenwriter Carl Mayer, he built massive sets and constantly reshot scenes in his quest for perfection. Expectations were high, and were bound to be disappointed.

Many felt the story, based on Herman Sudermann's novel The Journey to Tilsit, too slight: a farmer (George O'Brien) is persuaded by a woman from the city to drown his wife and run off to the city with her, but finds himself unable to do it and falls back in love with his wife (Janet Gaynor), only for her to fall overboard in a storm. Indeed, it has often been argued - especially by some the films admirers - that the plot is merely an excuse for Murnau's visual experimentation, but nothing could be further from the truth.

Both characters and narrative have an unpatronising simplicity that is completely involving. Set against the contrasting worlds of the country and the city, the design is striking only in that the film is almost entirely studio shot: both the city and the funfair were in fact false forced perspective sets, as was the swamp. There is certainly a real sense of a world existing beyond the requirements of the plot, but Murnau uses them to ensure his total control of all the elements and does not linger on them unduly, keeping the focus firmly on the characters throughout, never giving in to spectacle purely for spectacle's sake.

Murnau's use of the camera is truly remarkable, with a look and composition that remains unique to this day, but his visual approach is in the service of the emotions, building a cumulative effect that has few parallels. The husband's shadow appearing at the window to signal to his mistress or the camera following the woman's footprints in the mud, even the shadows of the trees against the white farmhouse wall in daylight create an oppressive atmosphere in the first third that adds to the joy and despair that follow. Yet, where one of the key criticisms of the expressionists has always been their relentless pessimism, Murnau belies this with the sheer fun of the central city sequence. There's a lot of humour in the film, be it George O'Brien chasing a drunken piglet in a ballroom, Arthur Housman's lech putting moves on Gaynor in the barbershop or Eddie Boland repeatedly rearranging the strap's of a woman's dress.

As what was intended as a murder becomes a second honeymoon, the film does not give in to cheap sentiment but instead has a real feeling for the everyday, simple pleasures. When the couple respond to the barbershop manager's entreaty to 'Come again soon' by inviting him to visit them someday, the film does not condescend to either party. He takes it as much of a compliment as they intended it. Indeed, considering its early appearance as a motive for murder, everyone they meet in the city is remarkably benign as if the city were bringing them back together to make a liar of the woman of the city and her motives.

The film is filled with ambitious visual effects: images of a bright shining city of light and motion are conjured up out of a swamp in stark contrast to the funereal atmosphere of his farm; a ghostly image of the woman is superimposed over the tormented farmer as he makes up his mind to kill his wife; and when crossing a city street with his wife, it fades away to reveal an idyllic countryside that is only shattered when they realise that their passionate embrace is literally stopping the traffic. Yet the most powerful effects are the emotional ones.

The primary problem with any romance has always been the language. How to convey the growing closeness between two people which transcends the limitations of the dialogue? Murnau simply dispenses with it altogether and just gives us pure, undiluted emotions in action.

There are surprisingly few titles, those there are resonating throughout the film, often being repeated to bracket key shots. The film is a fundamentally visual experience. We don't need to hear or know what O'Brien and Gaynor are saying - we feel it through the way they respond to each other, the way the distance and mistrust is gradually, painfully lessened as they move back together. Even in their cathartic moments in their reconciliation - his inability to kill her and his breakdown in the church when they watch a wedding - more than just the mere essentials are expressed through body language. Their actions and reactions speak far more eloquently than any dialogue ever could.

O'Brien's performance is predominately insular for much of the film, a man withdrawn into himself both physically and mentally, his reactions veering towards (but only at the end giving way to) violence, his posture almost simian as his humanity has been sapped away. With Gaynor the transformation is one from hope to realisation, but with O'Brien it is much more dramatic, almost a complete rebirth as he rediscovers his passion for his wife and for life itself. There's a real sense of, almost childlike, joy to him in the funfair sequence that makes you understand why Gaynor held on to him so long after the bad times came.

But the film belongs to Gaynor in a stunning performance that is one of the miracles of the silent cinema, indeed is one of the most remarkable pieces of screen acting in film history. She understands how to work to the camera, but is never 'working' it. It isn't a display of technique but an embodiment of the heart, remarkably natural and unaffected but very affecting: you don't merely observe her feelings, you share them.

Witness the expectation and disappointment in her face as O'Brien ties up the dog that has followed them into the boat. Her look conveys the memories, joys and disappointments of an entire marriage in a few seconds. Or the way that while he cannot stand to look at her, avoiding all eye contact, she tries to playfully move into his line of vision, only for the smile to fade tragically from her face. Later, when they are reconciled, as she watches him in the barbershop, the way she worries what his response will be to an attractive young manicurist is a delight to watch.

At first, their performances are stylistically at odds, as with the early scene crosscutting his wife's joy at what she thinks is reconciliation with his torment over her forthcoming murder, but it's not a selfish performance on Gaynor's part. As the film progresses, she seems to be willing the life back into him, so that when she is lost in the storm there is a real feeling that it is not only her life that has been lost but his as well.

Much has been made of the almost musical construction of his films, and it is very much a symphony in three movements: the opening section on the farm, the idyllic episode in the city, and the storm sequence and it's aftermath. But, if anything, Sunrise is ultimately a journey towards the light. The narrative begins in darkness and an oppressive mood of emotional frustration and, while the director had reputedly at one time planned a darker ending, it ends with a resurrection and the birth of a new day sweeping away the shadows of the old. In most films this would seem a cliche. Here it provides a fitting end to one of the most profoundly emotional experiences in all cinema.

Eureka's all-region BluRay offers a fine selection of extras to compliment the film too - not only all the extras from Fox's Region 1 DVD (outtakes from the film, choice of alternate soundtracks, audio commentary by cinematographer John Bailey and a documentary on Murnau's lost followup, Four Devils) but also the fairly recently rediscovered shorter alternate Czech version of the film!",1292716800,7,9241,4.825126262626263
2691664,5,7885729656,I watched this movie on TCM thinking it would be another interesting silent film that eventually gets boring enough to fast forward to the more interesting parts with DVR.  Instead I was mesmerized by the emotion and magnificent scenery.  This is a must see for anyone who can relate to the dilemma of a good person tempted by love and lust to dispose of his wife and family.  It is honest and very realistic with a refreshing sense of story telling above and beyond most twenty-first century talkies!  I am fortunate enough to have seen a few clips of this movie on Blu Ray.  It's a must own with fine acting as a bonus!,1289865600,4,621,4.412280701754386
2691665,5,7885729656,"Sunrise"", made in 1927,  is a masterful movie that was released at the beginning of the era of talkies.  It is not exactly a silent movie, because it has a musical score synchronized with the story and the soundtrack included some sound effects.  During a crowd scene in a busy street you can hear voices yelling ""Get out of the way!""  ""Sunrise was well done and  poetic with deep themes of guilt and redemption.  The plot is simple and poignant.  A young, married farmer with a baby, falls for a seductive city woman.  She is a flapper that just wants to have fun, the money from the farm and move to the big city with all its action. She uses her feminine wiles to convince him to drown his wife.

At any rate the naive farmer plots to murder his sweet, trusting loving wife during a boat ride.  He promises her a day off the farm with a boat ride to the city.  They leave their rustic farm and cross a lake or a river to the bustling, crowded,  tempting city.  His wife is full of anticipation of a good time as they leave their young child with their live-in servant.  He looks dark and evil as he rows the boat, her expression changes slowly from one of anticipation to horror.  The farmer's conscience is awakened as he starts to get up to throw his wife overboard.  He is ashamed and she is frightened, betrayed and crying so hard her body is shaking in misery.  As soon as they get to land, she hops out of the boat and runs to the trolley, which he catches as it takes off to the city.  Once in the city, it seems they do not belong and are confused and caught in the wild traffic.  They find some quiet in a church while a wedding is in progress.  They renew their commitment to each other while vows are being made.  It is a touching scene and brings light to their lives as they enjoy the rest of their time with a photographer and then the big wild and futuristic nightclub.

The story is heart-wrenching poignant, and a silent movie masterpiece.  I found it romantically beautiful and deeply poetic.  It should be noted that the special effects were used skillfully to show the effects of light, night and day and themed elements of good and bad.  The faithful wife is blond, the evil temptress Flapper has black hair and painted eyes and lips.

It is a fabulous movie and hardly needed the subtext - the acting and directing gave it great emotional power and each themed scene had the best technical touches for the time.  Janet Gaynor starred as the devoted wife and George O'Brien starred as the adulterous husband.",1289865600,5,2532,4.377682403433476
2691666,4,7885729656,"Amazon has many versions of Sunrise, I was looking at the imported Korean version because it came up with my search for it in Blu-ray.  It even had reviews that referred to a Blu-ray version.

But upon a more thorough investigation, I found out that the imported Korean version is only the regular DVD Version - not the Blu-ray.  If I had purchased it, I would have been very, very displeased.

This is something that Amazon has been doing a lot of lately - mismatching reviews - one has to be careful.

2691667,5,7885729656,"(The following is copied from my review in [...] -- probably in 2003)

""Sunrise"" was the featured film at the 10th annual Kansas Silent Film Festival, Washburn University, Topeka, KS. Music provided by Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra.

The festival discussion described this film as being an American studio's attempt to be taken seriously as a quality studio instead of being known as the producer of quantity. Germany at that time was known for making the most important, serious films and so a famous German director (Murnau) was brought in and given a blank check to make a statement film (its final total expenses pained the studio).

But the result is a powerful, timeless film on themes of betrayal, seduction, adultery, murder, and reconciliation.

For today's taste, the actors somewhat overly-dramatize their actions (as typical in the silent era) BUT just as most of us adapt quickly to reading subtitles in a foreign film, most also adapt to this convention to convey the message between those intermittent written screens that give dialog or explanations.

My understanding is that the very first year the Academy Awards were introduced, THIS film -- made a couple years earlier -- was the VERY FIRST chosen to be honored as ""Best Picture."" While I've not seen the other silent films that were its competitors, this honor certainly seems fully deserving. The actors, photography, pace, unfolding, etc., are all superb. Some of the scenes will remain in my memory forever.

What a rare treat to have seen it! I rate it as one of the all-time best movies I've ever seen.",1276128000,4,1584,4.958490566037736
2691668,5,7885729656,"This beautiful painting of the joy and light found in a marriage during an hour so dark the external storm threatens one life while an internal one threatens the very soul of the other is today considered a cinematic masterpiece. William Fox made some excellent decisions regarding both the making and distribution of this film which often, and quite unfairly, get chided by critics rolling their eyes heavenward in delight at the mere mention of director Murnau's name, with whom a long love affair has been in play. While his artistic genius can be felt in Sunrise, a few directorial flourishes do not work. The artistic framing of light and space to mirror the sentimental love story haunted by darkness is magnificent. The insertion of expressionism is awkward in a couple of spots, however, as if a great artist painting a masterpiece in muted tones had suddenly decided to add a splash of color to call attention to himself, rather than his subject. An achingly beautiful performance by Janet Gaynor, and the decisions made by Fox, however unpopular they may be with critics, keep the painting in focus, making it a masterwork of silent cinema.

Trimming the film by 20 minutes, Fox rushed Sunrise into theatres to cash in on the artistic and commercial triumph of Frank Borzage's masterpiece, Seventh Heaven. The decision by Fox afforded Sunrise what little success it had with the public. Audiences flocking to Sunrise in order to see Seventh Heaven star Janet Gaynor, were again treated to another wonderful performance. They did not warm to the film itself, however, and Murnau's choice to make Gaynor a blonde and give her a spinsterish hairdo in order to contrast the pretty city girl was an example of the less than subtle hammer on nail approach of expressionism which was unnecessary. Borzage, understanding the feminine, had been willing to let Gaynor show her vulnerability through her performance without this artifice in both Seventh Heaven and Street Angel. Murnau did not. While Sunrise is often cited as the film for which Janet Gaynor garnered the first Academy Award, it was a combination of the two Borzage films and Sunrise for which she won. She was deserving in each film for her tremendous efforts onscreen, but it was most certainly Seventh Heaven, so wildly successful and beloved, which put the statue firmly in her hand.

George O'Brien gives an emotional performance full of angst as the simple farmer blinded to his diminutive wife's charms by a woman from the city. Janet Gaynor is moving in her loneliness, longing for her husband to return to his former self. Margaret Livingston's city girl has him in a sensual frenzy so complete, however, that even her suggestion to murder her and make it look like an accident cannot be refused. Murnau used light and spacing to create a beautifully realized atmosphere in harmony with the dark and light of the simple story line. O'Brien does an excellent job as a man so hypnotized by the forbidden fruit he's had, and the promise of more earthly delights to come once they break free, he becomes a tumultuous mess. His agony at what he finds himself about to do as their row boat leaves the dock is evidenced by his inability to even look at her. Gaynor is also wonderful here, filled with joy at just the slightest attention from her husband, then becoming fearful the further out to sea they get. Even the dog adores her, breaking free and sensing she is in trouble. It is her sweetness which begins to untwist the knot, but her horror at his betrayal has her running in fear even after the city girl's spell is broken.

It is now Gaynor who cannot bear to look upon her husband, a loving heart devastated that the man she trusted so completely had thought to take her life. Gaynor makes you feel her pain and want to comfort her, while at the same time O'Brien's efforts to win her trust and see his shame are equally moving. The city he had so dreamt about then becomes a magical place full of wonder as the couple slowly get back to who they once were amid a carnival and fireworks, a dance of life, and the heroic capturing of an intoxicated piglet. The art direction of Rochus Gliese and photography of Charles Rosher and Karl Struss shine in these scenes. Not only do they capture the playful joy of Gaynor and newfound happiness of a couple whose love has been renewed, but the magical setting which makes it all possible. The elaborate carnival especially provides a marvelous backdrop in which the couple can be framed in a romantic light, in stark contrast to the prior darkness. The stylistic carnival set was built in a diminishing perspective, making it appear to go on for blocks. The most moving of moments is a simple one in a church, however, with God's light streaming through the windows to frame a married couple as O'Brien and Gaynor break down. Tender and moving, and very similar to a scene in Seventh Heaven, which was released months before, it is followed by the couple walking out of the church as though it is they who had gotten married.

It is in this most basic and tender moment, however, that Murnau shows that flourish which, for a moment, threatens to tarnish this sweet, simple scene of beauty. A technical camera trick seems out of place and jarring as the couple cross the street. Gratefully, Gaynor and O'Brien pull the focus of Murnau's masterpiece back to its subject before the moment is irrevocably damaged through their sensitive portrayals. Rowing back home on a new day full of promise, the darkness returns in the form of a deadly storm which may bring things full circle, and fate into play. I won't ruin the conclusion for the few film fans unfamiliar with this lovely example of the silent art form, but will say without doubt that the ending Fox insisted on was the right one, filled with magic and tenderness. Lauded too much for the wrong reasons, and not enough for the right ones, it still adds up to a beautiful film and one of the finest from the silent era. I watched it with the original score option and it was an arresting supplement to the visual and poetic story unfolding. Production decisions made by William Fox, a memorable characterization by George O'Brien, and a sensitive and adorable performance from Janet Gaynor, make this a must see film for anyone serious about the movies.",1274140800,3,6330,4.7361740707162285
2691669,5,7885729656,"In 1927, German film director F.W. Murnau (known for his role in German Expressionism) was invited by William Fox to make an Expressionist film for Hollywood and in return, Murnau created a film that would simply become a true classic and a true masterpiece with ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"".

The film is highly regarded as a masterpiece and is featured in the American Film Institute's ""100 Movies List of Great Films"" (#82) and the British Film Institute's critic's poll as the seventh best film in motion pictures.  The film won an Academy Award for ""Unique and Artistic Production"" at the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929 (including ""Best Actress in a Leading Role"" for Janet Gaynor and ""Best Cinematography"" for Charles Rosher and Karl Struss) and was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

Although the film was highly regarded then and now, the film was not a success at the box office because of its creative and artistic interpretation while critics were calling it a true masterpiece.

""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" was the first film with a soundtrack of music and sound effects utilizing Fox's Movietone souund-on-film system and for its creative and artistic style, the use of groundbreaking cinematography during that time would influence many filmmakers and even has been referred to as the ""Citizen Kane"" of American silent cinema.

Despite the original negative for the film being destroyed in 1937 due to a major nitrate fire (nearly 80-90% of Hollywood's silent films by Fox Film Corporation's created between 1910-1920's were destroyed) at Fox's storage facility in New Jersey.  Fortunately, a 1936 print held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive and the NFTVA were still present (the UCLA print was later destroyed due to advance decomposition in 1992).  In 1995, Kevin Brownlow and David Gill of Photoplay Productions prepared a new print for the 1995 London Film Festival using the NFTVA print and in 2002, restoration talks for the film began.  A fifth generation 1940 nitrate negative print was found in 2002 and then a 1927 print loaned by the Narodni Filmovy Archv in Prague featured a Czech version of footage not featured in the American release.

Eureka! via ""The Masters of Cinema"" has released ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" featuring both Movietone and Czech films on the Blu-ray release and with a choice of the monaural Movietone score and the stereo Olympic Chamber Orchestra score.

VIDEO:

""Sunrise: A Song for Two Humans"" were shot with two cameras thus one has the aspect ration of 1:20:1 and the other with 1:37:1  According to Eureka!, the Blu-ray version of the films were encoded with both HD masters in 1080p AVC format on BD50.  Eureka! decided against HD-DVNR, MTI or other forms of digital restoration or grain removal after tests revealed noticeable disruptions of the film's ""Sfumato"" qualities in many scenes.  And thus, their hands off approach was their respect to the filmmaker and the patina of the image. The level of damage still present is exactly what you would see if the film was projected via 35mm theatrically.

Having not seen any previously DVD or VHS release of ""Sunrise: A song of Two Humans"", I can tell you that from what I saw... despite it having some scratches and dust, I was very impressed with the picture quality of the film on Blu-ray considering the film is over 80-years-old.  According to my associates who have compared this film to the previous standard definition releases from Fox and Eureka!, this HD release of the film is absolutely fantastic!

I will say that the Czech version is a bit much more difficult to watch because it's missing frames and thus I prefer the Movietone version.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

Eureka! via ""The Masters of Cinema"" has released ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" featuring both Movietone and Czech films on the Blu-ray release and with a choice of the monaural Movietone score and the stereo Olympic Chamber Orchestra score by Timothy Brock.  According to Eureka!, the absence of any surviving soundtrack for the Czech version led Fox to roughly approximate the Movietone score to it in 2008.

Original English intertitles on the Movietone version are featured and optional English subtitles on the silent Czech version.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans - The Masters of Cinema Series #1"" comes with the following special features:

  * Audio Commentary - Full-length audio commentary by ASC cinematographer John Bailey on the Movietone version.  Interesting to hear Bailey's comments, especially on the camerawork and effects used.
  * Outtakes - (9:57) Outtakes with optional John Bailey commentary.  It's amazing that a film of this age has any outtakes.  So, I was surprised to see this on the Blu-ray.
  * Murnau's 4 Devils: Traces of a Lost Film - (40:55) Janet Bergstrom's updated 40-minute documentary about the lost Murnau film ""4 Devils"" featuring still pictures, art and details of scenes from the film.
  * Original Theatrical Trailer - (1:50) The original silent theatrical trailer.
  * Original `photoplay' script - The original ""photoplay"" script by Carl Mayer with Murnau's handwritten annotations (150 pages in pdf format).  You can download these from the Masters of Cinema website as well.
  * 20-Page booklet - Illustrated booklet with film restoration and DVD/Blu-ray transfer information, along with a comparison between the two versions.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have wanted to see ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" for such a long time.  I've waited with heavy anticipation for UK-based entertainment company Eureka! to release this film via Blu-ray courtesy of their Masters of Cinema series and I am so grateful that they decided to release this film with no region encoding, so anyone from all over the world that has a Blu-ray player can enjoy this film.

After watching the film, I can't help but gush about how fantastic this film is.  From the crowded streets in the city to the innovative camerawork and editing, I was simply amazed of what was accomplished back then.  The film is literally gripping as the film has its share of action and drama and literally from beginning to end, ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" manages to captivate you courtesy of George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor.

O'Brien plays the man from the country with such a great presence as Gaynor transforms from this sad housewife to this vibrant woman, especially in one scene with the crowd ask the two to dance.  But the camera work and artistic presentation was just phenomenal.  The whole city sequence created on the Fox back lot with hundreds of extras and cars from that era in a traffic jam to the man and wife attending a fair.  I don't know how much was spent on this film but everything on camera just worked. I was overwhelmed by how magnificent this film was but then watching the special features that came on the Blu-ray release, especially the slight differences from the Movietone and Czech version was quite interesting to see, especially to know that we will never be known of what was the final cut that Murnau had wanted due to the original print being destroyed in the Fox Warehouse and many other prints out there suffering from major deterioration.

But what we are able to see on this Blu-ray release, again...I'm grateful for Eureka! for releasing this Blu-ray via non-region but most importantly, choosing a silent film for its first major release on Blu-ray.  If anything, I am more inclined to purchase the Murnau DVD box sets out right now and look forward to watching the Master of Cinema's next Murnau Blu-ray release ""City Girl"".

Overall, ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" is simply magnificent and this Blu-ray release is just outstanding! If I had to give this film a rating, then definitely an... A+!",1267488000,54,7900,4.963525835866261
2691670,5,7885729656,"Pure visual poetry. No serious movie-lover or historian should be without this disc. It is Region Free and so will play anywhere. It is also a new scan, since MoC felt that the 2005 scan wouldn't be good enough for a 2009 Blu-ray release (hear that, Criterion?), and it's gorgeous. The only real digital work that has been done is to stabilize the frame and even out the flicker, something that nearly drove me mad about the 2005 DVD release (but only after repeated viewings). Everything else is here, scratches, an occassional missing frame or two, film grain (thank god!) so the result is like watching a screening of a very good print. Sunrise, like Murnau's other monumental classic, Nosferatu, suffered a fragile and dangerous history, but has survived nonetheless. In typical Murnau fashion, the first half of the story is a brooding thriller, then it moves, quite logically, into a romantic comedy, then turns to tragedy. Murnau liked to cover the whole spectrum in his films, mixing laughter with tears.

End of press release.

There is nothing special about the story behind this movie. A farmer (George O'Brien) is attracted by a vamp from the City (Margaret Livingston) who seduces him and has gradually had him selling his farm off piece by piece to provide presents for her. She finally suggests that he leave his failing farm altogether and return with her to the City. However, to complete the plan, he will need to drown his country wife(Janet Gaynor). A few days later, the farmer takes his wife for a trip to the city. As he rows his wife across the lake that is between their village and the trolley, he comes close to doing away with her. However, always a reluctant partner in this plan, he recoils in horror and rows the boat to the shore, his wife unharmed. The wife, having seen the murder in her husband's eyes, jumps onto the trolley to the city with her husband in hot pursuit. Once in the city, he reassures her that he would not harm her, and he begins to feel real remorse for his previous actions. They slip into a church and watch a wedding ceremony going on, and in doing so begin to reconnect to one another. By the end of the day, they've fallen in love again; the man remembering why it was he married his wife in the first place. However, when a storm breaks out on their way back across the lake, the wife falls out of the boat. The farmer goes for help and the entire village looks for her, hoping she has not been drowned in the storm. This rather simple story could easily have been transformed into a hackneyed melodrama. What makes Sunrise a great film, though, is the majesty and tenderness F.W. Murnau managed to give it without the benefit of audible conversation.

Particularly intriguing is the set of the unnamed ""City"". If the traffic patterns shown in this movie are indicative of traffic laws in the 1920's it's a wonder anybody made it to or from work alive. Early autos, horse-drawn carriages, and people all chaotically race through the streets without rhyme or reason. Also wondrous are the night shots of the Coney Island-style amusement park where the farmer and his wife go for some fun before returning home as well as the view of the trolley ride and and the glide following the farmer through the moonlit marsh. This truly was the ""Best Artistic Picture"" of the year.

A little known fact is that Sunrise was one of the first feature films to use sound-on-film techniques, in which Fox was a pioneer. There were fully synchronized sounds of automobiles, church bells, crowds, and other effects. Unfortunately, ""The Jazz Singer"" was released shortly after Sunrise, and Sunrise failed at the box office. Time, however, has had a different judgement. Today, ""The Jazz Singer"" is mainly remembered for ushering in the age of the talkie. Likewise, ""Wings"" which won the first Best Picture ""Oscar"", is largely remembered for its aerial stunts, for which it also won an engineering award. Sunrise, however, is still appreciated as a whole motion picture experience, not just a temporary technical triumph that has faded as other technical triumphs take its place.",1257552000,32,4502,4.886125654450262

8157129,4,7885729656,"I saw this film for the first time 13 years ago. I do have a few more things to say about it now.

Firstly I see Sunrise in a much more intimate manner than I did before. Before I felt it was an ""everyman/woman"" story that spoke to all. It does speak to everyone but the story is specific to THIS man and his wife, in the fact the wife is so childish and naive. A smarter, gutsier girl would have simply put her foot someplace where it mattered before things got out of hand.

Perhaps the overly-childish wife represents ""womanly purity"" vs ""easily led astray lusty man"" thus the universal theme. And today I view the woman from the city as simply a prop to further the action. We don't care about her.  She's disposable.

This time around the movie touched me more in the heart. A couple of scenes even brought tears to my older, empathetic, more sentimental eyes. Janet Gaynor was pitiable. The husband less so, and actually he wasn't as good an actor as her, relying more on theatrical gestures than Gaynor's subdued facial expressions. Although she really sunk her teeth into the woe is me despairing role.

I didn't like the scenery as much this time around as I did the first time. The backdrop appeared sinister to me now. Especially the city scenes, and the carnival almost something out of a horror movie. Confusing, off kilter, odd. I always feared the couple would lose each other in the crowd, never to find the other again. That never happened. But there always seemed that threat.

The boat scene back seemed less dramatic than the first time too. Although I did forget if the wife was found or died (my memory isn't what it used to be) so a tense few minutes for me there.

What really struck me more now was, the cruelty of the husband. I didn't appreciate how brutally he treated the woman from the city after he thought his wife had died.  In my opinion that was ALL ON HIM. And any man who can throttle a lady for ANY reason whatsoever has a barbarous streak. So what's to prevent him from doing the same to his ""beloved"" if given sufficient reason or opportunity?

Plus my God he did want to kill his wife originally. Untrustworthy. Perhaps played deliberately so. After all we do not know what happens after the wife recovers and all returns back to ""normal"".

The new normal includes an infidelity and a loss of trust, so no longer can the couple remain ""happy as children together"" with that blot on their record.",1496534400,4,2436,4.466216216216216

8157131,5,7885729656,"There's something about older films that appeal to me.  Perhaps it's their time-capsule quality, or maybe it's the dramatic craft, which relies more on stage acting than our modern ""shoot-it-from-every-possible-angle-43-times"" approach.

The film isn't terribly long, but it has a pace and development that makes it substantial.  Not long, just . . . substantial.

I won't debate the artistic merits of the film itself, but the craft of film making, of classic drama is on full display here.
