Dvds of such appalling quality as this should not be allowed to be sold. This is worse than the worst pirated videos I've seen. I'm not blaming Amazon, but why isn't this Koch transfer in the same legal class as pirated videos? People shouldn't be allowed to charge people for such a product. I haven't seen such terrible video resolution since 1st generation mobile phone videos! I'm binning my copy as I wouldn't inflict in on anyone else",1269907200,9,617,4.5675675675675675

Gina Lollobrigida was only three years removed from her 3rd place finish in the 1947 Miss Italia beauty pageant and all of 23-years-old when she had the title role in ALINA. It's a noirish post WWII story of a child bride who, when her much older husband falls ill, takes his place as part of a smuggling ring. Trying at night to travel from an Italian border village to a French casino/rendevous point, she battles bitter winter weather, physical exhaustion and the advances of a fellow smuggler determined to make her his own. The film's highlight is a flight over snow-covered mountains.

In ALINA, Gina does not portray a provocative woman --she's most demure here-- so don't be misled by the DVD box's cover photo of her in a slip. This KOCH VISION product is a rather mediocre transfer of what appears to be a videotape of a well-used, edited, English-dubbed movie.

In 1957, Miss Lollobrigida also appeared in one of the many remakes of Victor Hugo's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-HUNCHBACK-OF-NOTRE-DAME/dp/B00005U152/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME</a>, along with Anthony Quinn (as Quasimodo).
