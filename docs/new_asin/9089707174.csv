1172993,5,9089707174,"First off, this has lovely video footage, split into three approx. 18 minute walks.  The footage is without wobbles (except for one obviously unanticipated bump in the road that was a minor wobble) and very crisp.  As I was hoping, there are very few people or vehicles that I felt I was required to ""dodge"" while cycling....I like my walks/rides to be as ""out in nature"" as possible.  This video, as is, definitely rates 5 stars.

It would have gotten another star if the soundtrack....bird song overlaying some background sounds like runners' shoes striking the pavement or the infrequent grounds keepers' vehicles' engine noises....had more variety.  I don't know if the same soundtrack looped on itself over the course of the three separate walks, but there was no break in the chirping when the scenes changed location (shown as pages turning) and I found that a bit disconcerting.

I would also award two more stars if the camera was capable of panning left and right, not just aimed straight ahead at all times.  I felt as if I was wearing a set of very deep blinders and not allowed to turn my head as one would naturally do if one were out taking a walk/ride.  There were things ""coming up"" that just abruptly disappeared a few feet ahead that I would have loved to see as I ""passed"" them.

I have no idea how fast I ride my stationary bike....don't have my speedometer hooked up...but I exercise walk at 4 mph.  I would estimate that this walk was filmed at a speed of about 2 1/2 - 3 mph. most of the time.  Rarely did I pass scenery at what seemed to be my normal walking speed.  That mattered not at all for me on the bike....but if you're going to be on a treadmill and your desired walking/running speed is different from about 2 1/2 - 3 mph., I can see where it might throw you off.

The three walks total about 53 minutes and there's a trailer for another CD (Singapore nighttime skyline....people and architecture) that runs about 7 minutes.

I enjoyed it...it gave me the desired break from my normal lecture/documentary/stand-up fare that I lean toward for my almost-daily bike ride.  And today....oh, yeah....beautiful Singapore weather when my window shows the groundhog's prediction of more winter...snowy/rainy/cold.  This one's a keeper.",1391385600,,2262,4.717557251908397
1172994,5,9089707174,"These are a must have if you walk on a treadmill or indoor bike! I love Tony's walking DVD'S.
  Walk One starts in the Chinese gardens, this walk starts by crossing a Bridge lined with Red Flags celebrating the Chinese New Year. All through the park you will see red flags and red lanterns hanging from the trees. You will see a Temple as you enter the park. You hear the birds singing and sometimes children playing. As you walk you will see the lake and pagodas which are very beautiful. You will pass a few other walkers and feel as though you should wave to them. You will go over a few bridges that are different. As you finally come to a bench you think it would be so nice to sit down and listen to the birds and the flags flapping in the wind. But you know you have more to see.
  Walk Two Japanese Gardens, This walk takes you into a traditional Japanese Garden. You will be walking along the lake and some ponds. Small gardens and statues make this garden have a different feel than walk one. This walk is relaxing and thoughtful, you feel like you are far away in nature, but actually the city is right there close. You do not see as many people in this walk. And it has more trees and shrubs in it. You can just feel how quiet it is here.
  Walk Three, This walk is more of a Jog the movement is faster, but you can still walk to it also. You will pass over a beautiful red bridge to enter the park. You will pass by Chinese style pavilions which you think  it would be nice to stop at. There is a seven story pagoda that I thought was so nice. You will see smaller pagodas along the way also. You will pass a few joggers going by. The lake will be on both sides of you along the walk. This walk has alot more structures and picnic areas than the other walks, you find that you want to know what they are. Then a tree full of lanterns come into view and it is so beautiful. This walk makes you feel like this is a small community with all the buildings and everything going on. The walk ends crossing the bridge of Double beauty. You feel like you are walking right into the city.
  You will not regret getting this DVD. It is well done and there is so much to see and you feel like you are there walking in these parks. I won't ever be able to go to these parks, but these walks are the next best thing. You can walk in the Singapore,Chinese and Japanese gardens right at home and feel like you are there.
  Tony you did a great Job on these, Keep them coming!",1390780800,,2473,4.088842975206612
1172995,5,9089707174,Bought a few of those and they are amazing. What a great idea. Now every morning I don't mind doing a 30 minute cycling on the spot because I can choose what part of the world I will do it in. The key here is to have a few choices available and it does make a huge difference. Still cheaper than a gym membership!,1389657600,,313,3.90625
7901583,1,9089707174,"Other entries in this series are interesting, but this is the most boring ""virtual walk"" video I've seen. First, it does not seem to be more than one ""garden"" which I suppose has different sections. No matter, it is a drive (not a walk or trot) on asphalt past lots of vacant green lawns with very little of interest along the way. One goes by a pagoda here and there but there's no real look at it. No displays of flowers or interesting vegetation ... several times I saw the same clip of the same jogger on the same road. It really looks as if they had fifteen minutes of footage that they tried to extend into forty-five. While there are three ""walks"" I can't tell the difference, except one seems to have some gnarled trees at one point. You go over the same white bridge with and without red flags numerous times. Plus the cutting is jarring and takes you off your stride. This one is a turkey and they should be ashamed to have palmed this off on the consumer.",1500681600,,966,4.313186813186813

7901585,5,9089707174,Great scenic walks. Almost like being there. They run far too short for an average treadmill workout though. I am usually on a treadmill anywhere from one hour to two and a half hours.,1462492800,,184,4.4411764705882355

7901588,5,9089707174,"This DVD is great for anyone who lives in a big city and who wants its daily running workout seeing nature,then this DVD is for you. Whether you want to walk by a Chinese or Japanese park, on this DVD is something for everyone. You walk over bridges, you pass Chinese pavilions, temples and pagodas and there is wonderful green nature. The colors on this DVD are beautiful and the sounds of nature make the experience even more realistic. Here and there we also encounter some other joggers or walkers, so you do not have the feeling of exercising alone. I enjoyed the workout with this DVD. A run through this beautiful nature with its beautiful colors and the sights is very relaxing.",1443312000,,686,4.585365853658536

7901592,2,9089707174,"It is not a walk through the parks it's a run or drive. I thought it was a small park with maybe lanterns, koi ponds, and bushes etc. it is more a drive through paved large drive through bridges, and more a large park with not a lot to see. the Chinese and, Singapore parks not as nice as the Japanese. it would be okay, but not my best buy.",1396828800,,341,3.8857142857142857
