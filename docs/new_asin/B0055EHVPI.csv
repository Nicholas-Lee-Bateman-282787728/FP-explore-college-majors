8458180,5,B0055EHVPI,"Classically trained by Romana Kryzanowska.  You will not be disappointed.  This is pure Pilates, not the watered down version you see so much of today.  Darien stays true to The Method and gives you all the essential points to remember to perfect your mat workout.  You can't go wrong here.",1490659200,,290,4.74
8458181,5,B0055EHVPI,"This DVD is a rare find! It is both a treat and a rare treasure to get to witness Darien Gold's physique precisely articulate the Original Pilates Advanced Mat Repertoire with striking clarity! Students seeking authentic Pilates instruction will find this DVD extremely helpful to them. The DVD gives a range of showing the moves in sequence - flowing one after another - and then allows the viewer to study any specific move by itself in the second section. Because of this the DVD can be viewed over and over again to improve a student's own practice as well as serve as an elegant presentation of the mat to the newcomer. In the latter half of the DVD there are clips of Darien Gold working hard on Pilates equipment during an advanced study with accomplished Teacher Trish Garland. You will see Darien working hard and using breathing during the challenging moves of her workout. It also shows Trish giving feedback, adjustments and unique exercises for Darien to use.
There is nothing more to say but this is a 5 STAR GOLD TREASURE!

8458183,5,B0055EHVPI,"This is a high-production value, fast-paced, absolutely legitimate rendition of the original Advanced Pilates Matwork.  (I taught Pilates for seven years, and took from teachers who were two generations away from Pilates himself.)  This is fabulous.",1378684800,,249,5.888888888888889
8458184,4,B0055EHVPI,"This is a great video to watch and learn how to do the advanced variations of the classic Pilates sequence however, I thought it too fast to follow as a work out. I consider myself an intermediate Pilates practitioner and I found that by the time it took me to position myself for the next exercise, the instructor was almost ready to move onto the next.  Be advised that only the advanced variations of sequence are shown--there are no beginner/intermediate modifications.  The workout as a whole is about a half-hour long.  It is followed by a reformer session.  This is not something I know a lot about so I cannot comment.  The initial sequence seems to be repeated immediately after, which I found strange.  I didn't watch any more than that.  Overall, I recommend the first thirty minutes of this video.",1326585600,4,809,4.695035460992908
8458185,5,B0055EHVPI,"If you want a real Pilates workout that sticks to the original exercises I highly recommend this video. Other videos tend to add their own twist to Pilates, but to me the original exercises are perfect and are so hard to accomplish, so why change it. Darien's form is perfect and the video shoots give you a clear view. This is an advance video so the exercises do happen at a fast peace but you can always pause it.

Thank you Darien for such an awesome video. I wish the ""Mat 2"" was On Demand as well, but I ordered the DVD. Can't to get it!",1311897600,4,543,4.122641509433962
