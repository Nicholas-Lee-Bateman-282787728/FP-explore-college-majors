7799357,5,1581991274,I love this product.  It shows interesting characters of parrots. I recommend it to the people who are interested in birds and have pet-parrots.,1383177600,,144,5.0
7799358,5,1581991274,"I was so happy to find this video. I remember watching this on PBS when it aired and was so impressed that I actually wanted to own this video.
Item came as advertised. And I immediately opened and placed it in the VCR and watched it from beginning to end.
As a parrot companion owner I strongly suggest that you watch this video. If you're not, watch it anyway. It may change your life.",1311724800,,387,4.243243243243243
7799359,4,1581991274,"Being accustomed to watching ""Nature"" on my local PBS channel, and listening the marvelous voice of George Paige (who in my opinion has the perfect voice for nature narration), this will not disappoint those that have the high standards that ""Nature"" brings.  This shows all sides of Parrots and is quite informative and captivating to watch both the wild and pet parrots. I am especially happy that Dr. Irene Pepperberg's hard work has made it into this video.  She has been tireless in her 20 years of hard work and has proven that african grey parrots are as intelligent as dolphins and chimpanzees. If you have a grey, you must get a copy of her book AND videotape entitled ""Teaching Your African Grey The Alex Way."" I rate that video five-plus stars.",1016582400,10,755,4.712121212121212
7799360,5,1581991274,This video is very entertaining. One can not ever get tired of watching it. I have seen it about 5 times now and keep finding new and interesting pieces in the video. I showed it at one of my bird club meeting and everyone just loved it. There are not  many bird videos out there and this one makes up for that. In this video you get to see how intelligent and beautiful the birds are. I hope everyone buys and enjoys this as much as I have.,991440000,10,441,4.011363636363637
7799361,4,1581991274,"I loved this video. It not only shows the amazing abilites of pet birds, but shares information on parrots in the wild. A few words of caution- the video does show a wild parrot being shot by a farmer, and it also shows a woman hitting her pet. The video also has a scene where pet birds are shown in a shelter for unwanted animals, referring to ""disposable pet syndrome""- a very sad part of this otherwise wonderful video. I feel the majority of this video is heart-warming and fun, and shows the viewer the true wonder of these chatty, playful bundles of feathers",979257600,17,565,4.4423076923076925
7799362,5,1581991274,"Excellant video which should be viewed by anyone thinking about adopting a large bird with such intelligent natures. Shows wild, domestic, good side, bad side, beauty, and seriousness of these fine creations of God's earthly  kingdom.",958003200,9,234,5.5
7799363,5,1581991274,"This is a wonderful video, and should be shown in the schools, to give students an understanding of the capabilities of these marvelous bird, and appreciate nature.  No the parrots do not just mimic what they hear but  display a comprehension far beyond anything you could imagine. It is fun  and a joy to watch their antics. I wound up owning an Africa Grey, as a  direct result of this video, and yes he is a delight to the whole family.  If you want to add a little humour to your day watch this video, it is a  sure cure for for a bad mood.",955670400,17,544,4.133333333333334
