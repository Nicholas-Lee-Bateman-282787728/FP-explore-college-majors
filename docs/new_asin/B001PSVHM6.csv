8334532,4,B001PSVHM6,"A long time fan of this wonderful soprano, I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  In particular, Dame Kiri's performance at the Royal Naval Chapel, Greenwich singing Care Selve, Exsultate Jubilate and O mio babbino caro, I think exquisite.  The ease with which she sings is astonishing. It is definitely a DVD to be treasured in years to come. I think Dame Kiri's voice was at its finest at the time of this concert.

I would have liked to have see more of her at the end of each performance when she so graciously acknowledges the conductor (Stephen Barlow) and The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden.

I also enjoyed her beautiful singing in the first half of the DVD in New Zealand with the NZSO.  Pokarekare ana and Home Sweet Home are very moving.",1364428800,,759,4.592592592592593
8334533,5,B001PSVHM6,"This was a typical Te Kanawa performance -- beautiful, dazzling, perfect.  Every time I watch this DVD I walk away feeling enriched, as if I had become a  better  person for having experienced it. In other words, the heart's typical reaction to having been subjected to something Worthwhile.

Kiri's singing is wonderful and the locations are as impressive as her superb performance in them. Together they are an absolute delight to eye and ear alike. I would highly recommend this video to anyone who loves being part of a truly beautiful  musical experience",1261353600,8,559,4.967741935483871
