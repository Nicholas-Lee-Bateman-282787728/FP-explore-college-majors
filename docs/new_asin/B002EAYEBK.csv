8367156,5,B002EAYEBK,"This film is beautiful.
Directed by Fatty Arbuckke under a  pseudonym.
Marion Davis is in top form. She can go toe to toe with Chaplin and Keaton with this performance.
Added bonus; the soundtrack!!!
Wow! I can just play the soundtrack from start to finish. This film was scored to perfection.",1518307200,,293,4.745098039215686

8367159,5,B002EAYEBK,"A terrific silent film comedy that even children will enjoy. Wonderful pathos in the acting of Marion Davies in the role of Tina.  Makes a good tie-in to ""Citizen Kane"" in film studies classes.",1360022400,2,193,4.676470588235294
8367160,4,B002EAYEBK,"Marion Davies plays a maid in a wealthy home. She is an unusual girl who makes friends with mice and gets herself into awkward situations. One day she accidentally finds herself competing in an ice race in the village and she wins, catching the attention of one of the most popular men in town and her ideal man.

Later we learn that the miss of the house Marion works in is engaged to marry a wealthy man she does not love. The girl is homely and desperate to marry a poor laborer in town. Marion finds this out and offers to switch places with her so the girl can elope before her parent force her to marry.

This silent has great pacing, makes good use of the technology of the time period, and features a wonderful comedienne in a role that shows off her talents. Button-nosed and freckle faced Davies looks like a little girl here, but at the time she was one of the most famous kept-women of all time to one of the wealthiest men of all time. She was no dumb blonde and this film proves that. The supporting cast is excellent too and makes for a very enjoyable comedy directed by Fatty Arbuckle, who had been ostracized from Hollywood and therefore had to use a pseudonym.",1358467200,4,1178,4.35
8367161,4,B002EAYEBK,"The Red Mill is charming and funny and has some nice drama in it too. It stars Marion Davies, comedienne extraordinaire, in a comedy set in Holland where everyone wears wooden shoes and skates on the frozen canals. Marion - who plays a put-upon servant/maid - falls for a gent from the city. Money was spent on the production and it shows. I liked this movie a lot.",1309132800,5,365,4.382352941176471
8367162,5,B002EAYEBK,"I usually buy from amazon, but I bought this film directly from WB for much less. A great silent film that doesn't air much. Watch TCM's schedule in Aug 2009. But be forewarned that the disc wouldn't play in my DVD recorder and may not play in your pc if you have recording software on it. It did work fine in my DVD player.",1247097600,10,324,4.078125
8367163,5,B002EAYEBK,"For many, the DVD release, and the August TCM showing of, The Red Mill will have a special value.  Now, those who study Roscoe Arbuckle's directing skill, after 1921-1922, can learn more about this silent film genius .

Clearing Up a Misunderstanding:  At birth, Roscoe was given the name ""Roscoe Conkling Arbuckle"".  His father's name was ""William Goodrich Arbuckle"".  In his entertainment career, Roscoe used the name ""Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle"".  In 1921 and 1922, Roscoe was charged with manslaughter involving a film actress, Virginia Rappe.  Although he was exonerated in court, Roscoe was given only limited work, mostly directing or other jobs behind the camera.  Because a hostile and vocal public still condemned him, Roscoe thought it best that he become as anonymous as possible.  A partial solution was to go by, in his work, the name ""William Goodrich"".  Roscoe used the pseudonym from 1925-1932.  He died in 1933.",1246492800,5,926,5.147651006711409
