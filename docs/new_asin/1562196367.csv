This movie would have been extremely good but the character's voices are all different. To some people it doesn't  bother them that the voices are different but for me I just don't feel the emotions when the voices are entirely different than before.

183276,2,1562196367,"As the title states, I am a HUGE Yu Yu Hakusho fan. I remember watching the series as a kid in the 90's. For the past few months, randomly, I decided to re watch the whole series and the movies.

Everybody is entitled to their own opinion but it's just hard for me to give this a rating higher that a 2 or 3. No way does it deserve a 4 or 5.

Lets see what should we cover

Graphics - decent DVD graphics. the movie is old, back in the 90's. It shouldn't be a problem though, graphics did not bother me at all.

Storyline - pretty decent storyline. As I said, I am a huge fan. I'll watch anything Yu Yu Hakusho. The story was decent, ok, no problem with that at all.

Voices - Basically, it boils down to this. Nothing else would bother me, I don't ask for much. After watching the english dubbed ""Yu Yu Hakusho movie"", I was hoping Poltergeist report wasn't as horrible with their character voices and acting. Ok, it wasn't AS BAD, but it was still pretty bad. I don't feel as though the acting or the voices reflect the characters rightful personalities at all. I don't know how this whole process works, but all those responsible for the english dubbed voices in this movie should be ashamed. Its a disgrace. I should have just watched it in Japanese with english subtitles. I'm really hoping that they re release this movie with better voice and acting. In my opinion this is what killed it. It's hardly even watchable.

Final Opinion - So do I recommend you to watch this? Well there's so many people that doesn't seem to mind the voices and acting at all. Are they Yu Yu Hakusho fans I don't know. To me yeah, I would still watch it, because the visuals bring back memories from my childhood in the 90's. But the voices and acting absolutely killed this movie. It's just not the same.",1342224000,,1790,4.29673590504451
183277,4,1562196367,"I am an avid Yu Yu Hakusho fan. I think the plot line for this is very good. The whole Netherworld concept was explored which was nice. I will admit there were times where it was like huh? why would that happen. But over all it was a good movie.

Now for the dub, I don't want this to be a rant. I for one did not mind the dubbing. This was before Funimation had the rights to Yu Yu so of course it is not the same cast. My thing is people complain if its dubbed because of the voices others complain if its not dubbed because then they have to use those oh so unimportant reading skills they acquired (note the sarcasm) so really no one is happy ever.

Anyways yeah the voices weren't outstanding to the point they moved me to tears, but hey they were good. I would maybe argue that Kuwabara's voice got a little annoying because of the deepness but again nothing is perfect right?

Plot was good, art was nicely done, the voices were also good.",1320105600,,946,4.158469945355192
183278,3,1562196367,"This movie was entertaining.  It was interesting to see a new world added to the Human, Spirit, and Demon world.  I would have liked to see another character from the show come back into the plot since the movie format doesn't have enough time to really develop new characters very well.  I thought it would have been awesome if the younger Toguro came back and helped fight the villain.  I thought that would have been awesome since I'm pretty sure he got banished to the same place where the villain was from before he eventually would cease to exist.  Anyway, a fun movie, just didn't have the depth of the series.",1299456000,,617,4.5225225225225225
183279,3,1562196367,"""Poltergeist Report"" is a 90-minute animated action/supernatural movie intended for the teen male audience.  It is the movie sequel to the animated TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Yu-Hakusho/dp/B004GZZGWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu Yu Hakusho</a>.

VISUALS- When this movie debuted in 1994 it would have been considered very well-animated.  Just remember that it has been nearly two decades since then.  This is pretty impressive cel animation drawn by hand (from the era of pre-CGI).  However, the master from which this DVD is made wasn't the best and DVD doesn't hold a lot of data in the first place; expect a slightly aged, yellow-tinted picture and 480p quality or less.  It's too bad there isn't a remastered blu-ray version for this movie like there is for the TV series.

AUDIO- The English dubbing seriously detracts from the movie; several parts of the dialogue were changed for the worse and the voices don't match the characters' personalities at all.  Try to imagine a deep heroic voice given to a 14-year-old delinquent, an annoying but dead serious voice given to a comic relief character, or something vaguely reminiscent of an elf given to an extremely bad-tempered demon.  Some of the girls' voices are so high-pitched and grating they literally make small children cover their ears in pain.  If you're going to watch this movie, I would recommend turning on the subtitles and watching it in Japanese.

PLOT OVERVIEW- The plot of the movie is simplistic but solid enough.  It begins with a massive flooding of the River Styx.  Botan, a guide who ferries people across the River, is entrusted by Lord Koenma with a mysterious sphere of untold power.  Botan then flees to Earth to warn Yusuke, an investigator of the Spirit World, about the crisis in the realm of the dead.  After Yusuke and his sidekick Kuwabara track down Hinageshi, another guide, they quickly learn that King Yakumo of the Netherworld is attempting to destroy the Spirit World in hopes of rebuilding his own.  Yusuke, Kuwabara and Hinageshi, joined by Kurama and secretly helped along by Hiei, decide to restore the Spirit World by using the energy stored inside Earth's five elemental sites.  However, Yakumo turns the tables by sending out his demon gods--each skilled in various types of illusion--to steal the sites' energy.  Things go from bad to worse when Yakumo reclaims the Power Sphere from Botan, and it all leads up to a series of duels: Kuwabara versus Majari, Kurama versus ""Kuronue"", Hiei versus Raigou, and Yusuke versus Yakumo himself.

STORY EXECUTION AND CHARACTER SETUP- ""Poltergeist Report"" is the movie sequel to the animated TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Yu-Hakusho/dp/B004GZZGWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu Yu Hakusho</a>, so if you haven't seen the TV show up until the end of the second season you're probably going to be a bit confused.  There is no real introduction to the characters, their unique abilities, or the story up until the start of the movie.  We are not told that Yusuke has died, been resurrected by Koenma, and as a result of his resurrection has attained supernatural powers which he uses to hunt down demons.  Some backstory probably would have been helpful, especially when you get to the part where Yusuke and his friend/rival Kuwabara suddenly start shooting Spirit Guns and swinging around Spirit Swords.  Sadly, this lack of information is consistent with all characters and makes certain parts very confusing (example: why does Kurama have white hair and fox ears in his flashbacks?  It's because he's remembering his past life--not that we are ever told this.)  We are given more backstory for the antagonists, but not all of it makes sense, and it even creates plot holes in some cases.

Okay, you don't get any of their history or their powers, so you're left blinking in confusion when the characters let loose with Spirit Guns and Black Dragon Waves.  Do we at least get a good setup of relationships?  Sort of.  We get a sense that there are strong ties between characters, but we don't really know what those ties are.  The emphasis on Botan leads us to think that Yusuke is romantically involved with her, when in fact he's involved with Keiko (who has less than a minute of screentime because she's not part of the plot).  There's no question about Kuwabara's crush on Yukina or Hiei's older brother relation to Yukina, but when it comes to Kurama's ties with Hiei and Kuronue we're not entirely sure what they mean when they say they are ""partners""--they're partners-in-crime, but the whispered encounters in the night suggest a romantic element as well.  Depending on your opinion, this ambiguity may be a good or bad thing.

--CLOSING STATEMENT--

All in all, ""Poltergeist Report"" isn't really the type of movie you just pick up without having seen the TV series first.  It's fun for long-time fans, but if you haven't seen the show before you're going to be confused and are probably better off not buying this movie.  If you want a good introduction to the show, I'd suggest buying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Yu-Hakusho-Season-One-Classic-Blu-ray/dp/B004GZZGWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu Yu Hakusho: Season One (Classic) [Blu-ray] </a>.  Funimation does an excellent job adapting the series to English with well-chosen voice actors and a great script.  A 28-episode season naturally gives you a better sense of the story and characters than a 90-minute movie will, and it has much more of the comedic element that made the series so popular in the first place.  The drawing style and animation aren't as impressive as the movie's, but the picture is remastered so the colors are bright and beautiful and the lines are crisp and clear.",1289606400,2,5861,5.268030139935415
183280,4,1562196367,"Alright, first of all this movie was great. I loved every minute of it. It had a nice arc in story and felt appropriate as well. But for the love of anyone who has seen the english version back then and now of the show, please just put it in japanese and subtitled, unfortunately the original voice actors are not here. It's a real shame, they really set the mood and these new guys just didn't seem to get any of the characters or learn from their predecessors. I could only tolerate it for about 5 minutes before I had to change voices, and since the japanese tend to keep their voice actors it was a fun ride from beginning to end.

All he needs is a ancient mystical orb lying dorment inside Botan to make that vision a reality. But, there are four men ready to fight him. In other words, it's up to Yuuske and his friends to make sure that doesn't happen. A must have for any fan of Yu Yu Hakusho.",1275696000,,560,4.242990654205608

On this note, I have no idea who is rating this. I'm finding more and more that you can no longer rely on people who rate these animations on any sites. This movie was awful; even on the Japanese version; and I'm not talking about the English voice actors. The story plot was terrible and worst of all characters like Kurama and Hiei seemed weak and spoke, in one case, in a way that their characters wouldn't. It was overall bad that I sold it back.

As other reviewers said, they have NO emotion in their lines, they've changed the dialogue and screwed the original meanings, most sound NOTHING like the english cast YYH fans are used to from the series, and they didn't even get the names right... *Cough* Kuwahara *Cough*
If you want to see ALL of YYH, including Kuronue, who can only be found in this movie, buy it, but DON'T expect much from the English cast. As for me, I'll leave it on my shelf and continue to pray that FunImation redubs both movies in the future.",1241222400,2,833,4.56

And the voice acting, oh my the voice acting.  Its quite bad.  There are a couple barable ones in there, and actually the villain has a pretty good actor, but a lot of the main characters are just [...], especially yusuke.  As far as action goes, I love it, its got some good fight scenes.  That is the only redeeming quality to this movie [...].",1216339200,,561,4.346153846153846

I just want to say that I am a huge fan of the YuYu Hakusho TV show. THis movie was released by U.S Manga Corps not funimation like the show. Their was a whole different cast of Voice Actors than on the tv show. The Voice Acting was horrible their was no emotion. It seemed like they just plainly talked into the mics when they were recording it. There was no humor at all. Even the characters who provided comedy relief in the show provided no humor to the movie. Also, The called KuwaBara, KuwaHara which drove me crazy.

Now for the positive parts. The story was pretty good, and the action scenes were good.

All in all, don't expect this to be typical YuYu Hakusho, because it's not. If this movie was redone with the voice cast of the Funimation Tv show  than it would be awsome. We can only hope that that happens.",1187308800,,1166,4.409302325581395

The story is simple, long ago there was an alternate world, the Netherworld that was for Demon World what Spiritworld is for the human world. The Netherworld was defeated and cast away and has now returned.

I liked the concept, I really did. It gave the option of introducing characters that could challenge the gang post Three Kings Saga. That said... well the problems were endless.

For starters, the group that did the english dubing was not the same group that did the dubing for the tv series, and as a result fans of the series might have problems adjusting to the voice changes. If that was the only issue with the dubing it would be ok, but its not. The voices all sound the same, bland and uninspired. There is no emotion in ANY of the characters lines.

The next issue is the power levels of the character. The Movie was hyped up as post Three Kings, but Yuske apparently has lost most if not all of his power. Infact the only character that dispalys a reasonable amount of ability in the movie is Hiei.

Finally, though the concept for the movie was good, the implimation of the concept was as poor as I have ever seen in a movie. The characters had to race to sites of spirit energy and battle over them. How every original. Honestly I would have prefered a 90 minute slugfest to the garbage plot that was used.

In closing, beware this movie. If your a Die hard fan you might buy it, but otherwise its not worth 2 cents.",1151625600,8,1636,4.330065359477124
183293,5,1562196367,"A COOL FANTASY ACTION THAT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!!!!!!

Maybe not FAST as Dragon Ball but is SOO HIGH BUDGET!!! I mean... The animation is SUPERB ***** (the moves, destruction and fights were very realistic), the character desing is soo COLORFUL (just as seen in the cover), the graphics are pretty realistic, GOOD story but very simple, bad english dub but not THAT bad, COOL song at the ending credits and the camera moves were AWESOME!!

I said that this anime is like Dragon Ball because there are to many ""HADUKENS"", jumps that make look like the characters are flying and the story about the bad guy that want the ultimate power to conquer the wolrd but the good guys also can have the ulmate power to protect the world. But this anime is not THAT similar to Dragon Ball.

I like the concept of the characters... I mean... each character have a diferent power, one with a cool spirit sword, other with a power whip, other with ""haduken"" and the last one with the control of a giant power dragon!!! obiously this anime concentrate more on the action and not much with the story.

I never saw the serie, so I don't care what people say about the comparison to the serie.

P.S: This anime is like PG-13 style or a Saturday Morning Cartoon but don't worry!! you will be SOOO entertained that you won't care.

Even George, Koenma's hapless demon flunky, only has a couple of warning lines.  But the usual banter between Yusuke and Botan, or Yusuke and Genkai is non-existent.  The characters of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei, Genkai, Koenma, and Kurama act like wooden actors from a Hong Kong martial arts '70's film with a formulaic plot of heroes bent on revenge.  Botan is a helpless female the whole time.

The music is poor.  Sound effects feel off.  The story is about Yakumo, the king of the netherworld, who wants to take over both the spirit world and the human world.  A little miko from the spiritual world with the world's biggest and most annoying cowlick alternately tries to help, but mostly gets in the way.

Oh, God, the English voices are HORRIBLE!  The movie was released by a different company that released the Yu Yu Hakusho series.  Not only are the voices different, the acting has no heart.",1140739200,10,1069,4.744565217391305

But, the voices for all the familiar charactes (Yuske, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, Keiko, Genkai, Ogre, and Koenma) really stink. There are two ways to watch this movie. To watch the English version turn the subtitle on and press the mute switch every time the familiar characters begin to speak. to watch the whole movie in the Jappanese version with subtitles. other than that it was a beautiful movie with good action, good animation, good story, and good artwork.",1120953600,,660,5.064220183486238
183297,5,1562196367,No matter what the others said this was a great movie. It came out in America LONG before Cartoon Network did the tv series. I saw it years ago and was hoping they would bring it but they killed the voices I was use to and redid tons of names. For instance Hiei's black dragon wave is now called something totally different. Hiei's voice was much better in this movie and fit him more. The name was pronounced right for Kuwahara in this movie since it came first in my opinion which CN does a lot just look at Inu-yasha with them calling Kirara Kilala in America. They change the names only because they feel it will be easier for us to say. The movie drags you into wanting to see more and in my opinion is better than the show. You might be a little lost if you don't see the show first to find out what everything is about but you can catch on quick.

I adore his voice(s) (Shuichi and Youko), and they killed it in this movie.  Kuwabara's voice scared the crap out of me; and they mispronounced his name throughout the entire movie.  They completely ignored the 'b' in his name; and replaced it with a 'h'.  Plus, Yusuke's voice lacked his sarcasm and attitude.  I did like the animation; it had a little something different from the series that I liked.  The fights were rather boring and a lot of running around.  My favourite thing, was the fact that Kouronue appeared in it.  I have been searching for him ever since I heard about him in the series and among my friends.  Even though it wasn't the real him, I adored his character.  I saw this movie On Demand since I have Comcast Digital Cable.  I recommend that you either rent the movie or borrow it from a friend.

183302,4,1562196367,"I have read plenty of reviews on this one- enough in fact, that I hadn't expected too much out of the movie. As a hard-core YYH fan, I expected a pro-longed episode. It was very much that- your typical Yuusuke and the gang saves the day from power-hungry demons that try to rule the Ningenkai once again. However, the animation is superb- much better than the series. The voice actors and actresses are very different in their voices- but it depends on your style to whether or not you like them better or worse than the original dubbed cast. The plot line is basically the same as always, Yusuke is cutting classes- Emergency arises in the Spirit World- Evil demons come to take-over- and the foursome (Kurama, Hiei, Yuusuke and Kuwabara) come to save the day with fist fighting and spiritual power to boot.
Personally, I loved the plotting. I believe it is Yuu Yuu Hakusho at it's best, however the story line could be thicker, if they had more time and energy (or funding) to do so. My one complaint is that they added in a new character- Hinageshi, who in my opinion, is a little whiny. Also, I was not fond of the voice acting, so I watch it in it's original Japanese with subtitled state. I would definitly recommend Yuu Yuu Hakusho- Poltergeist Report (Also known as ""Bonds of Fire"") to any YYH fan.",1087344000,2,1306,4.514767932489452

This movie is very old and was liscenced WAY before Funimation got its nasty grubby hands on it and ruined it with lousy voice actors that screw it up right now.  I personaly like the original japanese versions beter any day.  But Manga entertainment did a very good job with matching the japanese actors voices for this one.  I don't know what everyone else is talking about.  The animation was great and its told a very good storyline that was diferent from the regular run of the mill spirit dective lingo.  It was cool to see the fighting and some of the concern from the characters who saw their loved ones get their butts kicked.  Hiei was my favorite in all of this.

183304,3,1562196367,"Well, I watched this movie when I was lucky enough to find a subtitled Japanese version. Much to my disgust, the subtitles SUCKED!!! Well, what I drew from the movie overall was this:
1. It was pretty good, like an hour and a half-long episode of Yu Yu Hakusho.
2. The violence was kicked up a little from the FUNimation editted version I was used to.
3. I really, really needed to either a. learn Japanese or b. get a better movie
But when I saw Poltergeist Report in Blockbuster, I read a review on Amazon before I rented. Turns out the producer decided the American dub-cast from the series wasn't good enough so they got a new cast. If I could quote from Ronska's title the dubbed voices were ""mediocracy at it's best"".
Yet another little thing I didn't like was they took the funny bits we'd get from relationship errors or maybe just Kuwabara doing something stupid. There was no Keiko/Yusuke fights. In fact, you only had two scene with Keiko: one where she's taking care of Boton, the other, she's only there for the villian to hurt and have Yusuke get pissed.
Overall, not as good as the series, missing the funny bits, (but I must admit when Kuwabara hears that Yukina is at Genkei's place he looks and sounds funny!) and PLEASE watch subtitled.",1083196800,,1255,4.508771929824562

With the exception of Kurama the new voices don't fit the characters at all. Kuwabara and Yusuke's voices are especially terrible. Luckily you can watch the movie in its original Japanese language where the voice actors give off a superb performance.

The story itself is fun but not anything great. It is your typical ""save the day"" type story. However the story is fast paced and enjoyable and it is always nice to see Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei and Kurama in action.",1080864000,2,617,4.558558558558558

It's bad enough that the show went straight downhill after Yuske came back to life and basically turning into another DBZ/ Saint Seiya Tournament type show, but now this? I expected a lot from this movie. I figured they could come up with an interesting story that was above what they do in every episode of the T.V. show, but they didn't. It's just more shoujo action. One rediculous fight after another with some of the most horrible back ground music I've ever heard. The only thing keeping this from getting one star is the animation. The animation was handled very well and didn't just look like another episode of the show.  If you're a fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, you'll enjoy this.

I'm not going to spoil the movie for you, but I reconmend it. You get to see Hiei's new attack, and Kurama's old frined Kurone. For you Kurama fangirls...Kurama takes a bath in a lake, have fun drooling over him.

183314,5,1562196367,"The ""God-Warrior"" subgenre of anime basically focuses on teams of human warriors gifted with extraordinary powers who are chosen to fight against gods/demons with major world-conquering ambitions. The original God-Warrior anime is generally considered to be Saint Seiya; others include Yoroiden Samurai Troopers (""Ronin Warriors""), Shurato, and the parodic approach of Sailor Moon.
  YuuYuu Hakusho broke several of the standard tropes, starting with not being a five-team (four main characters), and eliminating special costumes. Then they made sure to be distinct by making all of their characters not-nice people. The nicest one is Kuwabera, a gang leader who's always lived his life by his fists but who shows a surprising secret heroic streak. The others range down from there, with the sarcastic Yuske and the fox-demon Kurama about equal and the demonic Hiei (who appears to be Vegita's [DBZ] love child, judging on appearances) coming in dead last on the ""Guy I want to actually MEET"" sweepstakes.
  Because of these changes, YuuYuu was able to provide some plotlines and approaches the others could not, keeping it fresh even while it otherwise followed genre conventions to the letter. The YuuYuu Hakusho movie epitomizes all of the best features of YuuYuu Hakusho, including the characterizations, the twists of plot, and the dramatic battles. The villains are actually rather inventive for a show which like so many anime has only buttkicking as its _raison d'etre_, and the grand finale against the dark god, king of the Netherworld, Yakumo, is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.

THEY DID NOT USE THE VOICE ACTORS FROM THE SHOW ON CARTOON NETWORK!!! Kuwabara, pronounced Kuwahara in the film, actually sounds some intelligent!

This is about the nether world and trying to take over the human world. I have to say the plots lines are very good. The fights are awesome, but at the end of Kuwabara's fight,well it ended alittle silly. People really can't say Kuwabara is stupid cause he proves us wrong so many times in the battle field. This is a must see for all who love Yu Yu Hakusho. Hiei and Kurama Fans will love the fight sense in this movie. If you have been watching the series you are already know about Kurama's past, but it shows alittle more than what you would think as he is now. All I can really say is Kurama is very loyal. Hiei, well we all know he has a bad past. One of the nether world's demonic legions is crupting Hiei's demon heart and ordering him to destroy his friends. Will he give in to the dark power and destroy Yusuke and the others? Well you'll be shock to see what happens here. One more thing Yukina is in here too. It seems also that Kawbara name is said wrong but don't worry it didn't bother me. If you are a true Yu Yu Hakusho Fan you will not worry about little things like that.

Being a dedicated fan of Kurama, I was very pleased that they showed more of his past. One of the the evil Netherworld Emperor's demon servants has the power to create ""evil halucinations"" with these swinging scythes. He tricks Kurama by turning into this guy with crow wings and black clothes, claiming he is Kurama's old partner, Kuronue, from way back when he was the legendary theif, Youko. They have a flashback scene where Youko and Kuronue have just robbed somewhere, but while making their escape the chain of a pendant that was obviously extremely important to Kuronue broke, and when he dived to get it, a bunch of bamboo-blade things came down and killed him. The part of this memory the demon servant twisted was what Kuronue said to Kurama while he was dying, as well as saying that the fox demon deliberately cut the chain of the pendant to kill him. Back in the present, Kurama goes down into this mystical fog to fight with his old partner, but he doesn't want to attack. Unfortunately for him, the demon posing as Kuronue has deadly scythes and attacks Kurama while taughting him about his past. That is all I think I should give away ^^
The only thing that bugged me about this was the voices. If you have seen the television series alot, the difference in voices may slowly eat away at you and maybe, like in my case, drive you insane. Also, a warning to people who are not familiar with the Yu Yu Hakusho series; no introduction is given for the characters or storyline. If you do not watch Yu Yu Hakusho and understand it , this probably is not the best DVD for you. Besides that, I think this movie was good and highly recommend it to all Yu Yu Hakusho fans. =^_^=",1052352000,,1887,4.52046783625731
183327,5,1562196367,"For those introduced to YYH from Cartoon Network and the subsequent DVD's from FUNimation, take note -- this is NOT done by FUNimation.  As a result, the English cast is not the one you are accustom to and this may put people off.  However, if you've been watching the DVD's and using the Japanese audio, the Japanese cast is the same (as best as I can tell).  You should have seen the TV series through DVD volume 9 in order to understand everything that goes on here.  If you've never seen the show, you are going to have a difficult time understanding who the characters are and their relationship to each other.
Story-wise, Spirit World is under attack and Botan barely makes it to Earth to alert Yusuke.  Thus Yusuke and his crew have to fight demons from the supposedly banished Netherworld.  We have some of the typical one-on-one battles the series is famous for but this time we actually get to see the boys work as a team!  The ending is kind of weak in that I would have enjoyed seeing an aftermath portion, but that didn't happen.
Bottom line:  YYH is an anime title I have a weakness for. Having a new English cast is disappointing, and the English subtitles aren't as good as FUNimations, but if you are a YYH fan, you'll want this movie.",1051228800,19,1252,4.4605263157894735

The main complaint was Kuwabara or Kuwahara(wtf is with this name?!?). His voice acting was terrible. but some of the voices were alright(Like Hiei and Yusuke). But genkai was another terrible one.

You also get a glimpse of Kurama's back story. Since this occurs later in the series you also see some incredible powers. I would suggest at least watching the series up to the gate of betrayl, otherwise you maybe lost. This is a must have for all Yu Yu Hakusho fans.",1043452800,2,509,4.1

This movie got me completely addicted to hunting down as much YuYu Hakusho as possible.  The animation is GORGEOUS. It flows smoothly, and the character design is awesome (if ya like dead sexy men, then GET THIS ANIME). The music is just plain amazing. In fact, I heard a song before I watched the anime and that's what got me interested, as well as a nagging friend... The plot is great. I had no idea who any of the characers are, but i got a basic idea of who everyone was just from watching the movie (Except for Botan... just go online to figure her out like i did).

183347,5,1562196367,"I said it above, and I'll say it again... What's wrong with you people?  First things first.  The people who slam Poltergeist Report for the animation quality have absolutely no ground to stand on.  This animation is excellent, top of the line, no question.  These the are the sort of people who think that X had boring artwork.
Secondly, what's wrong with the plot?  You people seem to forget that this is a FIGHTING anime.  It's about FIGHTS.  So what if you've never seen the TV series?  All you need to know is that Yakumo is evil, and the four heroes are good!  Where did they get their powers?  It doesn't matter.  If you really want to know, go order the series fansubbed from Sekihou Gumi (It's really easy and cheap).  I assure you that you need not have ANY prior knowledge of the series to enjoy this movie.  Poltergeist Report delivers in every way that matters.  The characters are amazingly cool, the fights are awesome, and the entire movie just oozes raw power!
Finally, complaints about a subpar dubbing job?  What a shock!  A bad anime dub!  Sorry folks, but if you order dubbed anime you should know what you're getting into.  The voice acting in the original film is so good that there is no excuse not to order the subtitled edition (Amazon even has it for a few bucks cheaper than the dub!)  In short, if you like good fighting anime, order this.  If you don't, go watch Evangelion or Ghost in the Shell.  I know what side I'm on.",974246400,9,1452,4.444866920152092

I bet it's just as good or maybe better. I  reccomend watching Yu Yu Hakusho: The Movie dubbed and subtitled by  AnimeWorks.

183352,1,1562196367,"'Poltergeist Report' follows a group of young 'spirit investigators' as they become the last hope for the world when the Netherworld threatens to rise and take the place of the mortal world. Sounds pretty neat, I think.  Too bad the execution of 'Poltergeist Report' doesn't live up to its  promise.
The film has two fatal flaws, both of which relate to its  script.
First, the film assumes *way* too much knowledge on the part of  the viewers, namely that we are familiar with the comic book upon which it  is based. We are never properly introduced to the cast of characters--all  we learn is that they, for some reason, have 'spirit powers' are are in  league with the powers-that-be in the Spirit World. (For most of the film,  I thought they were somehow spirits that were walking the mortal world, but  toward the end, references seem to imply they are mortals.) We also never  learn what their relationships to each other are, and there's never even a  sliver of infomation provided about *why* these kids lead the dangerous  lives they do. The only one that makes a small amount of sense is the  Shrine Maiden, but that's because she's a stock character. Everyone else  remains total enigmas for the entire film, something which I assume is not  the case to anyone who's read the comic book. It would have been nice if  the unitiated could have been granted some insight, too. I suppose that if  that insight had been provided by the film, the title might even make  sense, too. ('Poltergeist Report'? What Poltergeist? What Report?  Huh?)
Second, the film probably resembles too much the comic books upon  which it is based in its pacing and execution... which, judgeing by the  film, are probably quite awful. It's a string of fight scenes, with what  passes for the plot serving as an excuse to get from fight scene to fight  scene. And like all bad comic books, the fights seem completely  unmotivated. In fact, on more than one occassion, the heroes behave in a  mystifyingly stupid fashion just so the fight scene can take place. (I  imagine that if I understood why some of the characters behave the way they  do, *maybe* their behavior would make more sense. Somehow, I doubt it,  though.)
There isn't much about 'Poltergeist Report' that I can be  positive about. It features average animation and average voice acting (  have the dubbed version). The near complete lack of craft present in the  screenplay, however, more than outweighs the average craftmanship in the  animation and voice acting.
I advise taking a pass on this one... unless,  of course, you are a fan of the comic book series upon which it is based.  Then it might well come across as a masterpiece.",958694400,,2685,4.7155172413793105

Dont listen to the people saying ""the english version for this movie is not the best, but its ok""; they are just being too nice. To tell you the truth, it was really TERRIBLE! The (Eng)voice actors on this are horrible. Especially if you're one that got used to watching the english dubbed anime episodes, like I have. Idk if the script was bad on this movie or just the translation/words chosen, but the dialogue between the characters is just AWEFUL to listen to, the execution of how they say their part is just soo wooden and out of character. And why the hell do they growl so much? Especially Kuwabara; not to mention how they mispronounced his name -,- That little red head girl, her part/scenes were pointless, and shouldve given to one of the regular characters instead. There was a lot of unnecessary 5sec pause between scenes. It gave me a headache, that I had to fast forward some parts. Then I finally gave up and decided not to see the last 30mins of the movie. There's just a lot of flaws that are waaay to obvious, that I feel like its a joke of a movie. Since it won't let me give a 0 rating; that one star I'm giving it for that scene with Hiei showing his true form. That was the only scene worth watching tbh. And its like... what..? 5mins long? Lol. If I knew that from the beginning I wouldve fast forward it to that part. Dont spend for this crap, its not worth it.

Its not really a full screen, nor wide screen, nor 4:3 ratio screen, it is more box screen (not sure of right term).  It just look like a video with a black rectangle background so that the video never touches the edges of the tv at a big margin.  Other than that it was just fine.  TV had a overscan which made screen the video to almost fit the entire screen with some black background edges on the right and left sides about less than half an inch and the top and bottom was stretch a little bit that cut off just a bit of the video still not bad.. just wish it was standard 4:3, full screen, or widescreen.",1512950400,,783,4.078431372549019
7796287,3,1562196367,"Back when I was in middle school, Poltergeist Report: Yu Yu Hakusho was one of my favorite VHS tapes to rent in Blockbuster's anime section (certainly dating myself there.) The art and animation were solid, and the action in the film was more than enough to satisfy my tastes as a dumb 12-year-old boy.

As a grown man, I can say my feelings have changed a bit. I have read some of the manga and watched a smidge of the TV series, so having an inkling as to who's who in this movie helped me still enjoy it as an adult. Reviews I have either  read or listened to are not wrong when they say there's not a whole lot of character development to be seen here. Thus, anyone watching without knowing the characters and looking for that or a deep plot won't enjoy this very much.

Also, if you like your anime dubbed, the English dubbing may give you some second thoughts about that. Keep in mind, this is the one property of YYH that Funimation does not own, and the original US release by the now-defunct US Manga Corps may even predate Funimation's acquisition of Dragon Ball Z. The presence of Veronica Taylor (best known for playing Ash on Pokmon back in the day) and Eric Stuart (Brock/James on said show) in the supporting cast may trigger the nostalgia reflex of some; when compared to much of the rest of the cast, they do give respectable performances. But the main stars of this film all sound either unbearably melodramatic, outright listless, or a mix of both. So if you're going to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it with the original Japanese audio track.

With all this negativity you see above, you'd think my three star rating was a low 3. Well, it's actually veering more towards a 3 and a half. There are definitely some positives here.
-Though the art and animation are a bit dated, the film remains visually appealing in retrospect.
-Contrary to much of the anime that was on the shelf, this was not violent to the point that I can imagine anyone getting offended by it or turning it off in disgust.
-As a whole, it is anything but offensive... except the English dub track.
-It's a guilty pleasure, dang it!

It has no ties to the manga, and its relevance to the TV show is next to nothing, but dang it, Poltergeist Report is just plain fun to watch! And if you want to make the dub fun you can always MST3K it.",1508716800,,2344,4.391705069124424
