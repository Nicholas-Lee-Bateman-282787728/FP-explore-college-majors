2803316,3,B000OYCMO4,"The Screwfly Solution is an interesting take on the zombie genre. Jason Priestly and Eliot Gould star as scientists who have studied the effects of genetic engineering on screwflies. They are called in to assist when suddenly men start attacking and murdering women.

While the premise has only the slightest amount of believability, suspension of disbelief can be achieved. However, the idea that this is being done by some higher beings for some ulterior motives stretches beyond that point.

I like my horror grounded in reality or Earth-bound alternatives. I find that suddenly introducing a ""sci fi"" solution to an otherwise non-sci fi story to be a cheat; a cop out, if you will. But that's just me.

This isn't the worst of this series, but its also not the best: Coscarelli still holds that mantle: ....Mountin Road.",1190073600,,824,4.956521739130435
2803317,2,B000OYCMO4,"This entry in the compelling MOH series is a little strange, mixing social commentary with a small dose of horror.  The world is suddenly going mad, at least its male population...sexual arousal is leading men to murder the woman responsible...and soon it's just men murdering women.  Two scientists offer a solution, as evidenced by the control of the dangerous screwfly population.  But no one listens, and of course disaster ensues.
Director Joe Dante doesn't do anything compellingly different, and the acting by Jason Priestley and Elliott Gould is merely adequate.  Not a sterling entry in this otherwise good series.",1181779200,6,623,5.262626262626263
2803318,5,B000OYCMO4,"I expected this to be good because I know that Joe Dante is an excellent director, but when I saw that it was based on a story by James Tiptree Jr., I sat up, because I knew this was going to be something REALLY extraordianary.

James Tiptree Jr. is one of the greatest science fiction writers of the latter part of the 20th Century. James Tiptree Jr. was also the nom de plume of Dr. Alice Sheldon (look for Tiptree's books on Amazon). Her writing was always psychologically complex and surprising. And this installment of MASTERS OF HORROR captured that, thanks to Dante's brilliance and Sam Hamm's great script.

It's made clear from the beginning that there is a parallel between our decimation of the screwfly/pest insect populations by disruption of their sexual cycles, and what is occuring to the human population in this story (at least it's clear to us, the audience). So this naturally begs the question: If we did that to the insects, who or what could be doing this to us?

The conclusion of this story is set up right from the beginning, is deepend, enhanced, and made more apparent throughout the telling of it. There is no cheap ending here. It is logical, inevitable, and horrible. Horrible for humans, anyway.

The dogs seem to like it.

It's important to keep in mind that this isn't a chainsaw hack-'em-up-er, or blood drinking beast fest, or a vengeful ghost mind twister. This is a story about the most terrifying monsters in the world: ordinary people who give in to the worst within themselves, thinking they're right, and good, and normal. Men who don't see other people (women) as human. And you have to pay attention.

Personally, this is my favorite episode so far in the series.",1181088000,14,1707,4.6923076923076925
2803319,4,B000OYCMO4,"In the 1950's 2 American Entomologists (Dr. Raymond Bushland & Dr. Edward Knipling) developed the ""sterile insect technique"",
to control the population of the screwworm fly. In this technique the male screwworm flies were exposed to radiation, thus rendering them sterile. They were then returned back to the wild, to mate with other wild female screwworm flies. The result was a reduction in the amount of eggs being laid inside American crops.
Now someone or something is applying the same technique to mankind.
A new form of sterilization, characterized by sexually driven bloodlusts.
At first it appears to be a few random mysoginistic slayings.
But as the numbers grow, so does the concern.
With the possibility of an epidemic, whole areas are soon quarantined.
No women are allowed in for they're own safety.
They're being forced to stay away, because women of all ages are being wiped out by  men who seem to believe that what they're doing in natural & rational.
In countries around the world it's occuring on such a massive scale, that whole rivers are being damned by the steady influx of bodies.
But who is causing this, and why?

I watched this episode with my wife, which almost never happens as a result of her being female, and hating horror movies.
So, after an unnatural amount of coaxing, I finally got her to sit down and watch one with me.
And of course, it was an apocalyptic horror movie concerning the erradication of women.
Suffice it to say, she will never be watching another horror movie with me, for as long as we both shall live.
Obviously, this movie had a much greater impact on her than it did on me.
And rightfully so,
I'm not a woman, who in most countries (and maybe even in this one),
have to live in fear of men every day.
(Hell, in Japan, groping is so bad, women have their own subway cars.)
(And let's not even get started on the Middle East)
This flick is the cinematic embodiment of every woman's fear.
Namely, Men.

With all that being said,
this film deserved more time to explore it's subject,
a bigger budget to employ more extras & horrific scenes,
and a much better ending that doesn't blow the whole premise.
(Nothing ruins a good horror movie more than a really cheap twist ending.)
All in all this was an enjoyable film, that could have been memorable, had it been alotted the time to go the extra mile.
As a result, the films story suffered, often taking huge leaps in time, giving it an incomplete feeling.
But if you really wind up liking it, I have a suggestion.
A better, modern example of ""gendercide"" is depicted in Brian K. Vaughn's monthly comic series, ""Y: The Last Man"". Pick up the trade-paper-backs, you will absolutely not be disappointed.

In closing,
If you're a horror-buff you'll enjoy this movie for what it is,
But do yourself a favor and don't watch it with your female,
She won't look at you the same way, for like a week.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
A world without women
is not a post-apocalyptic world I would want to live in.",1180828800,3,2995,4.601123595505618

2803391,4,B000OYCMO4,"This hour long episode had some blood, but wasn't a slasher film. A little sex and nudity, but wasn't a softcore production. It had some mystery and suspense, but not enough to make watching it a chore. It has humor, but wasn't a comedy. The acting was good with another fine performance from Gould. Nothing like a liberal family faced with the final solution and being forced to survive like red necks. Try not to get too attached to any of the main characters as most don't make it through the movie. The line I liked most was when the the teen girl says, ""We should just nuke those f***ing ragheads."" To wit the feminists reply, ""Don't say ragheads."" That one line is what separates real liberals from the rest of the world.",1276819200,,727,4.473684210526316
2803392,1,B000OYCMO4,"The story from which this is supposedly adapted is genius. Read it. It's subtly depraved, terrifying and moving. As you read, ask yourself why the men kill the children.

2803393,3,B000OYCMO4,"It's worth watching, especially if you never read the story it's based on.

Of course, this might be due to  a transference of my general terror of parasites (and hence, screwflies) to the story itself.

As other reviewers have pointed out, it's not as much a ""horror"" movie as others in the series, but I think how much it gives you the chills is likely based on your own life experiences. Anyone who's had a serious run-in with a physically abusive man will likely have nightmares after watching it....",1265068800,,834,5.5078125
2803394,2,B000OYCMO4,"It was like watching a cheap ""Movie Of The Week."" Absolutely horrible acting. I realize the plot and circumstances that lead to the behavior of the characters, but the reactions of the onlookers were something of the nature of ""Shawn Of The Dead."" - almost comical. Even Elliot Gould and Jason Priestly seemed like they were reading off a script. The supporting actors weren't any better or convincing, which took away the effect of the movie.",1232755200,,443,4.842105263157895
2803395,4,B000OYCMO4,"Joe Dante (Gremlins, The Howling) helmed one of the best episodes during the first season of Masters of Horror with Homecoming, and does so once again with this second season episode, The Screwfly Solution.  Based on the James Tiptree Jr. short story, The Screwfly Solution stars Jason Priestley and Elliott Gould as scientists Alan and Barney respectively; both of whom are caught in the middle of a virus epidemic that is causing men to viciously murder women in the name of God.  Alan's wife (Kerry Norton) and teen daughter (Brenna O'Brien) soon find themselves in danger and treking across the country as the virus continues to spread, leading them all to wonder just what, or who, is responsible.  Unlike Homecoming, which was thought provoking while still a bit comical, The Screwfly Solution is profoundly disturbing and features some truly horrifying moments.  That being said, The Screwfly Solution is easily one of the best offerings in the otherwise sub-par second season of Masters of Horror, and is more than worth the trip.",1226016000,,1038,5.052631578947368

2803398,3,B000OYCMO4,"The Masters of Horror series brings us sixty-minute episodes that cover a wide range of topics in the genre. In this installment, the story revolves around an attempt by an unknown entity to eliminate the human race. The story is fine, but there are a couple of problems with this episode. First, I think that this barely makes it into the horror genre; it seems more of a psychological thriller. The second problem is that the ending left me unsatisfied, since I felt it was a poor explanation to the reasons behind the events.

On the plus side, the acting was pretty good, especially for a horror production. In particular, I liked the performance of Elliott Gould, as Barney, a scientist trying to stop the debacle. Overall, episode is OK, but I would not recommend it to those that are new to the series.

8187426,4,B000OYCMO4,"Considering the ""Political Climate"" we're living in today, it's a shock that such a movie (even one made for TV) could ever even exist, let alone actually be approved for broadcast. Congrats to ""SHOTIME"" for having the ""balls"" (pun somewhat intended) to present such a no-holds-barred terrifying look at a sinister extermination plot wrapped in the disguise of something ""restorative"" -- a similar theme that was explored & presented more dramatically and without any allusions to violence in a 1956 ""SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE"" episode entitled, ""End of Tomorrow.""

I would''ve been interested in seeing if they could've successfully expanded this episode to a ""75-minute"" feature to make it feel more like a ""theatrical"" production, but even clocking in at 60-minutes they've managed to cover a lot of ground in such a tight story, so that it's one of those rare instances whereby it's difficult to see how it could've possibly been improved in any way with any sort of expansion.

You can't be squeemish going into this one -- not because of the gore, but because it will challenge all of your ""social conditioning"" to the point of extreme discomfort... so all sorts of ""TRIGGER WARNINGS"" are in effect if you have even the SLIGHTEST inclination toward Feminist Indoctrination. ""Men Going Their Own Way"" (MGTOW) *may* received a little bit of ""dark"" cynical satisfaction from the story, but ANYBODY who appreciates intense and controversial stories that violently and unapologetically shake-up our social norms and refuse to ""hold back"" for fear of ""offending"" its audience should likewise enjoy this entry.",1527033600,,1607,5.2007722007722

  The movie is premised that an attack is perpetrated against the world, an attack that is so heinous that it will eventually destroy the human race.  Men have contracted some type of disease whereby they are compelled to slaughter every women that they see, because men see themselves as the superior, and doing gods will, taking the world back to the days when it was only man and the creator, with no women. (Thus extinction of the human species because then there can be no procreation)...which is exactly it seems what the aliens that are taking over the planet want.

  Further into the movie it can be construed that all the women are now dead, and the men have now turned to killing male children, and many will not like the ending of the movie due to the viewer just being left hanging in the end.  Others might flog the movie for not being a true HORROR movie...as this film is from the masters of horror series, it is more like a sci-fi thriller.

  In any case I definitely like this movie, it thinks outside the box, and is a refreshing story prompting me to look further and potentially buying the book that movie is based off of.  I recommend this movie",1294876800,,1306,4.52991452991453
8187435,5,B000OYCMO4,"OMG...I'm truly affected by this movie. Any movie that has me Googling topics like ""Horse Latitudes"" and ""Disease Wind Vectors"" is definitely worth watching. Its also kind of deep how Male Sexual Arousal turned Aggressive links to Religious Phonetics. Could that be why The suppression of sex in men and priest in the Dark Ages led to Witch Hunts and the killing of thousands of women.  Look how the Bible or any deep rooted religion views women. Hmmmmm. See the type of thoughts this movie invokes. I absolutely love it.  And also can the course of human nature be affected by altering a simple enzyme?  In a world lacking the proper nutrition are we (specially men) being changed because of corrupted or under developed ENZYMES.
Think about it.

I also loved how a choice was made to choose between chemical castration and manhood. Here's this man with a sexually attractive wife who KNEW what was happening and why decided NOT to take the chemical castration shot. Which led to him becoming a woman-killing monster like all the other men.

One last point...the original author of this short Story was James Tiptree Jr.---HOW ABOUT THAT WAS A PEN NAME. Mr. Tiptree was actually a woman. Google it...you will see. Even more fascinating of why this woman pretended to be a male author.

A good marathon would be Keanu Reeves' ""The Day the Stood Still"",  Nichalos Cage's ""Knowing' and Mr. Tiptree's ""Screwfly Solution"". They all have the same ""save the earth from us"" themes. Then if you really want to mess with your mind watch Discovery Channel's ""Life After People"".",1293926400,,1568,4.8283582089552235
