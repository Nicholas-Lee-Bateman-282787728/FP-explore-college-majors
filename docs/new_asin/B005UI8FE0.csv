8486861,5,B005UI8FE0,Seeing God As A Perfect Father DVD was just what I and many others need to see and hear.  Louie Giglio has a God given talent to teach God's Word in a way that is not preachy.  He uses humor while maintaining Scriptural integrity..  The words father or dad do not always mean loving or caring.  This DVD makes it possible to see Father God as the perfect loving Father.  I am enjoying my Father and daughter relationship and am drawing closer to Him moment by moment.,1411344000,4,467,4.32183908045977
