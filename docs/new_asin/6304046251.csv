7859754,3,6304046251,"I've always liked this film - watched it again recently.  Carole Bouquet is so charming to watch,  everyone rather overacting around her is worth it.  Jonathan Price possibly miscast, such a gifted actor, the role didn't seem to suit him.  Christopher Walken over the top fun.",1453680000,,276,4.934782608695652

7859756,1,6304046251,"Yes, I bought this flick to see this ex-Bond chick Carole and, yes, she still looks good but her Greek charm was lost somewhere on a road to England  where she married another ex-Bond character but another ex-Bond character want her too. Gee, life is so complicated when you have to chose bettween this and that.
Hm, impression is the producer have to make living and these characters too so put them together, let them move and movie cooked to be consumed.
Sure, England has other problems, real problems, but why bother when three celebrities move and movie cooked, right?",1351296000,,574,4.74

7859758,5,6304046251,"Carole Bouquet is still one of the most beautiful actress ever born. Her face is a real Symphony; and her alluring fits perfectly with this role: she is a gorgeous model happily married with a talented but neglected novelist, he is possessively neurotic and needs her as a child needs her mother, but by these destiny's trickeries she has the chance to meet the editor of the firm in which his husband is hired, an entrepreneur, ambitious who is immediately attracted to her. She will be the driving force in this formidable comedy that will make us to reflect about a question without answer: Does the ideal man exist for such woman? .

Some lines are particularly incisive and acidic in this clever plot, a brilliant film measure by measure.",1188086400,,743,4.7153846153846155
7859759,1,6304046251,"There is a scene towards the long and tedious movie A Business Affair where the character Vanni Corso (played by the often stylish Christopher Walken) is seated with his Italian mother at the dinner table, and for a minute or so he stares blankly at the camera.  One senses Walken has had enough of this piece of romantic schlock by now, enough of a meandering and befuddled script, enough of Carole Bouqet's weak attempt at a French accent.  No doubt the Video/DVD cover will pitch a different caper, may even describe this tripe as ""comedy"", but I fail to see the comedy after having paid [money] in a second hand store for the DVD version.  I knew in my heart why this was only [money], and yet, I am a sucker for a bargain, and wanted to be consoled by the store attendant (""Christopher Walken looks so young!"") when I knew I had bought a lemon.  There is nothing funny, nothing at all that warrants the association with any ""feminist"" viewpoint, and not even a decent soundtrack (spare me the French accordian music please).  I fear that if that was my last [monry] and I may be eating the video cover this came in, scribbling over the title and hocking the DVD as a blank CD-R.  Stare blankly, longingly at this one, but don't stare for too long at your purchase, or you will regret and be forced to find another buyer like I am doing now.",1042675200,2,1345,4.425101214574899
7859760,5,6304046251,"This is a marvelous movie with wonderful performances by Christopher Walken, Jonathan Pryce, and the exquisitely beautiful Carole Bouquet. It is the story of a woman (Carole Bouquet), who is married to an egotistical, self absorbed Englishman (Jonathan Pryce), who is a well known writer and highly acclaimed literary figure. Christopher Walken plays the part of an Italian American publisher who is looking to sign up some English authors for the American market. He wines and dines Pryce, who ends up signing with him.

Meanwhile, Pryce is suffering from writer's block, while his long suffering wife is typing out her own manuscript. Pryce speaks to his wife contemptuosly about her effort. She gives her finished manuscript to Walken, who likes it and agrees to publish her book. This angers Pryce, who actually tells Walken not to publish it, so enraged is he by his wife actually having a thought that does not evolve around him. Walken meets with the wife and sees her as the beautiful, warm, intelligent, and articulate woman that she is.

Delighted to be treated like a normal person, rather than an appendage of her husband, Walken and Bouquet begin an affair that culminates in divorce from Pryce and marriage to Walken. She finds out that once married, however, Walken basically expects her world to revolve around him. In essence, Pryce and Walken are basically one and the same. She ultimately leaves Walken, writes another book, and becomes a best selling author in her own right and a woman of independent means. She comes into her own as a person, and is no longer another's doormat. This is the story of her liberation as a woman.",998092800,6,1648,4.903225806451613
7859761,4,6304046251,"I saw this movie for Christopher Walken.  But it's not his movie.  It's Carole Bouquet's movie.  She plays the main character, and it with her character that we identify and empathize with.
I saw this labelled as a  comedy, but it's not.  Its a very real human drama... sometimes  lighthearted, sometimes not so light... but always a real drama.  And I  cared what happened to the characters.
In the end, the characters  didn't all act the way I wanted them to.  But it's not my movie.  And I  realize that it ends the way it should.  It's a movie about a woman who is  stuck in a man's world.  Who faces, and loves, men who want to keep her in  her parents' era.  But she wants a life of her own... and in the end it's a  movie about her liberation.
If you are looking for another good creepy  Christopher Walken movie, then you may be looking in the wrong place.  Because this is a very good movie, but it's not a psycho-thriller.  It a  human story.",950313600,3,952,4.259887005649717
