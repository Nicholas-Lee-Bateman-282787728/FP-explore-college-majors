8046902,4,B0007D4MAO,"When the first season of Gravion ended, basically none of the questions raised throughout the series had been answered. For example: Where is Eiji's sister? Are Toga and Leele even human? What past is Sandman hiding? Most importantly, what is the origin of the Zeravire and why are they attacking Earth? Is someone controlling them? Well, I have to say that in Volume 1 of Gravion Zwei, we might have taken half a baby step towards getting the answers to some of this, but it doesn't look like a sure thing. The back of the DVD trumpets ""Effeminate Heroes! Giant Fighting Robots! Gravity-Defying Breasts!"" which appears to be a desperate ploy by ADV Films to improve the sales of this show to the lowest denominator. It does have all those things, but its not the borderline porn that it's hyped to be. If anything it's more about comedy than the first season, and seeing the characters get on each other's nerves or just being in everyday situations like a company picnic or a hot springs trip is great. Yet, in the end, there's always an alarm triggered off by an encroaching Zeravire, and everybody gets into their mecha transforming overacting hand motioning alien butt kicking mode! (If the Zeravire are aliens) The Gravion crew is also getting some competition because the government is tired of being beholden to the mysterious Sandman and is planning to mass-produce its own Gravion-like mecha.

I actually thought Volume 1 of Zwei was more enjoyable than the previous season's installments. My favorite part of this anime was always the story before the token battle of the week at the end. Most of the episodes of this DVD deal with what leads up to the battle instead of focusing on the battle itself. The conflict between Eiji and Luna has gotten even funnier, and at times it seems as if they might be in love. Even Sandman seems to be enjoying himself this time around, letting the Gravion crew have a break at a hot springs resort. I know the whole giant robot with assembling vehicles has been done to death, but so what! The fun is in the path to the metamorphosis, not in the transformation itself.",1153267200,2,2116,4.688172043010753
8046903,2,B0007D4MAO,"another fans service diguised as something eits not. Basically like Ikki Tousen its basically a showcase of complicated and detahced plot,and busty hot chicks. at times i wish it was just about the chicks. The dialogue usual showcase of the flat and dull to the annoying and grating. While all the while laying out corny jokes thorughout. WEll i guess the creaters think they can mix fan service with big scaled nonsence action to keep us distcrated from the dead tired and over familair set up(even as a comdey it bores with old tired jokes).IT even says on the back of friggin cover in bold letters ""fan service"".",1132963200,2,615,4.703703703703703
8046904,4,B0007D4MAO,"After the first season gravion begins to be very funny but you still want more of story from them. The best new addition to Gravion is that they seem to be creating a Villan. Something other than a gigantic alien that froms every shape learned in preschool, that appears every other day that never talks to say why It wants all humans to die because there isn't anyone or anything in it It's just a big kiling machine sent by who knows. The big thing about gravion is that It is a comedy and serious show all at the same time but sometimes a little bit more comedy It's very funny but It's nice to see them put some more concentration on the serious part of the show so fans can keep buying the dvd's for the excitement and suspence and not the big boob chicks. The only thing that they haven't  done that I would like to see is Eiji and Luna create some kind of a relationship. In conclusion this dvd really isn't worth 36$ so do like i did and borrow it off a friend or watch it on the anime netwok that way you can't lose.",1111449600,5,1025,4.125
8046905,1,B0007D4MAO,"these girls have the biggest boobs. this show has absolutely no point other than fanservice. If you actually like the show you must be on crack. This is a mecha show,but they don't even need the mechas mizuki can battle them off with her boobs. this show is a piece crap and no one should buy it.",1109635200,5,296,4.2105263157894735
