so this new 2 disc set is a major Upgrade from the previous home video formats
Don't let the odd choice art work fool you (The cover looks somewhat like some of the cover art for Madman
The reversible artwork is also a bit strange at first you'll think It's a Elvira flick!

Synopsis
A private detective is hired to find an ancient book. What he doesnt know is that the book has the power to turn any woman into a nymphomaniac, and that a group of Nazi scientists who fled to the US after World War II also want the book, and will do anything to get it
Jacqueline Lorians will go deep undercover and expose the truth in the way that only she knows how. With her hot body and insatiable sexual appetite, she will take you on a sex adventure that'll melt your world.
Blue Ice will take you to unbridled heights of XXXtacy now in a 2k HD!

While this film certainly isn't for everyone (It's a prime example the power Adult Studio had in the 1980's)
Being able to help push a new home video format (VHS) during a time when there were actually legit Stars
Herschel Savage, Jamie Gillis, Paul Thomas, Ron Jeremy, & Shanna Mccullough are all A List names that could carry any film they were featured in. It's also the final film by Director Phil Marshak
Mr. Marshak is one of those guys  that never truly was given his due at being a solid Director with a great eye!
Maybe with this release more people will discover his work and appreciate what he tried to bring to the table
a solid must have two disc set  9.2/10

Vinegar Syndrome Synopsis
Since our inception in late 2012, we've dedicated ourselves to saving some of the most endangered, unexpected and unseen American genre films from the 1960's to the 1990's.
Running Vinegar Syndrome is much more then simply discovering interesting films and releasing them on Blu-ray and DVD. Our facility serves as a massive (over 20,000 sq. ft.)
climate-controlled film archive where we house negatives and prints for thousands of films, many of which would never have otherwise quite literally ended up in dumpsters or deteriorated beyond repair.
Our in-house lab is equipped with state-of-the-art film scanning, digital restoration and color grading suites, which allows us complete control over our  digital film preservation efforts. Additionally, in 2015 we launched our own distribution company, which has allowed us both more control over our release schedule as well as the ability to better market and promote our titles.

But, despite all of this, we are still a small company and we rely heavily on selling direct-to-consumers through VinegarSyndrome.com to cover
a great deal of our operating costs. As such, by buying direct and ""cutting out the middlemen', you are truly helping more films get saved, preserved, and released",1513987200,,3789,4.866459627329193
