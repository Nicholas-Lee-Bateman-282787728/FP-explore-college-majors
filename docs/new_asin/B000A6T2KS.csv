2368239,4,B000A6T2KS,"Don't get me wrong but I truly love these plays. I'd love it if Tyler Perry would come to Denver, Colorado and do them here but I don't think Denver would be black enough for it to happen.

This weekend I bought this collecvtion but I found out that the dvd called "" Class Reunion "" wasn't working at all. Yesterday I got a replacement copy thinking that it would work but again I had the same problem.. I just thought everyone thinking on buying this collection should know what';s going on.

Have a wonderfull week.",1128988800,7,517,4.375

2368241,1,B000A6T2KS,"Not at all as expected, a complete waste of money. I expected it to be on the order of the movie, ""The Diary of a Mad Black Woman"". Instead they are all plays, not movies, and hard to understand.",1128816000,12,195,4.0256410256410255

2368327,4,B000A6T2KS,I'm a big fan of Tyler Perry so when I seen this DVD Play Collection I jumped on it.  Very funny!,1389052800,,97,3.619047619047619
2368328,5,B000A6T2KS,Well I've got the play and the movie. I really like the play better. Live plays for me brings out something that when on film just doesn't do. Great story where Madea is letting some of her family stay with her and you know Madea she puts them in their place when need to be. The songs in this play was awesome. Tyler knows just what type of songs to chose for these play's. The play's always gets me in a spiritual move. I do recommend both but I loved the play better.,1384732800,,470,4.064516129032258
2368329,5,B000A6T2KS,I am not up on people or movies but find this collection very enjoyable.  Watching funny movies are uplifting and Tyler Perry does a fantastic job.,1376697600,,147,4.653846153846154
2368330,3,B000A6T2KS,"The other 3 of these plays are not his best but they are good and very entertaining and feature the character Madea. Meet the Browns was a real disappointment to me and was bad enough for me to discourage anyone else buying this collection. This play doesn't feature the Madea character though she is alluded to in the story. I felt so embarrassed for the actors of these characters because their actions just didn't make sense in any meaningful way, The performers seem good but the music seemed to be a lot of screaming and repetitive melodies. The funeral scene in the last part of the play I really felt the play humiliated many of the characters with a sparse plot line and nonsensical and unfunny craziness. Lots of WTF moments. It ends with the standard positive messages of the rest of Perry's plays but by then I had just lost interest and hope in the play being able to redeem itself. I just watched the movie version of ""Meet the Browns"" and Perry nailed it in this version. All of David Mann's craziness along with the other characters is put in a much better perspective that is hilarious but still makes sense.",1375574400,,1124,4.541871921182266
2368375,5,B000A6T2KS,Tyler Perry went and did it again. Making others laugh and understanding the true meaning of the movie all at once. Perfection!,1368576000,,127,4.818181818181818

2368382,5,B000A6T2KS,Tyler Perry never fails to entertain.  Never.  He is always on the mark and always includes some spiritual uplifting element to his plays and movies.,1302393600,,149,4.92
2368383,1,B000A6T2KS,"I bought this box set expecting 4 Tyler Perry movies.  What I got was a collection of 4 live-action plays, NOT movies.  Nowhere in the product description does it make it clear to the consumer that these are not movies.  Deceptive, to say the least!  I will say, however, that Amazon was very accommodating when I called to complain.  They made the return process very easy.",1298246400,,374,4.606060606060606
2368384,1,B000A6T2KS,"NOWHERE IN THE DESCRIPTION DID IT SAY THAT THESE WERE THE PLAYS. I LOVE ALL OF TYLER PERRYS MOVIES BUT I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WHEN I HAD GONE TO WATCH THEM AND CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT THEY WERE NOT THE MOVIES, BUT THE PLAYS.",1276214400,3,230,4.133333333333334
2368438,5,B000A6T2KS,"I love Tyler Perry's movies and play. They are very funny and well created.  I have watched both his plays and the movies that are made from them, even though they differ a bit the essential plot is still the same and the hilariousness is still there.

2368440,5,B000A6T2KS,"Each time that I watch a Tyler Perry play, I feel so uplifted after wards. He makes you laugh out  loud while going through whatever it is that you are going through or even asking God questions about. It's as if he himself has walked every single journey of your natural life. Wow! Often days when I need a good funny or uplift in my day, I will just pop in a DVD by Mr. Perry and instantly get my joy on!",1263081600,,406,3.951219512195122

2368552,2,B000A6T2KS,"Although I thought these were very funny and enjoyed them, nothing on the boxed set or information tells you that they are not actual movies.  They are stage plays.  I bought on Tyler Perry's reputation for his humor and didn't realize I wasn't getting real movies.  Somewhere in the description it should be noted that these are plays and not movies.",1197676800,7,351,4.721311475409836

2368626,5,B000A6T2KS,"My family and I have been fans of Tyler Perry since seeing our first Madea video borrowed from a friend several years ago. When I saw this set, I had to have it. He speaks the language of families and has much better subject matter and language in his productions than many my family could see elsewhere. We are making plans to see his latest production ""What's Done In The Dark"" live, and know it will be worth it.

2368628,5,B000A6T2KS,"I will admit to this; I LOVE Madea; got her book, DVD's(trying to get the latest ones); I am a big fan; I go to the movies on opening weekend. What I like about these plays and movies is that they have a message; a message that has been sort of lost and that is you don't have to have sex to be with someone, you should remember God in what you do; Ok, Madea is ""over the top"" sometimes, but how are you going to defute that she isn't getting the message across to the millions of black fans that flock to her plays and shows, made the book a bestseller and is basically making Tyler Perry a household name? Is she that bad a character that we have to ignore her? I don't think so; I can say this and that is, we ALL have a Madea in our lives; and if  you don't mind me writing this, we sure need more!! Now, three years ago, I didn't know NOTHING about Tyler Perry; watched his ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" play and though that isn't my particular favorite, I was hooked; watched his Family Reunion, and got even more hooked; went to the movies when they came out, and I'm sorry, you just cannot tell me she is all bad; she is more needed than anything.sorry; these plays come highly recommended; Peace.",1151971200,10,1204,4.123404255319149
2368629,4,B000A6T2KS,"I'll admit that I'm a Johnny-come-lately to the ""Madea"" series, finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece. Creator Tyler Perry and his alter-ego, the opinionated, pistol-packing, chain-smoking (never lit, by the way) ""Madea,"" have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans, mostly African-American, nationwide.

Though the stories feature the tried-and-true clichd characters (the belligerent teenager, the devoted wife, the straying husband, the vixens, the lotharios, etc.) and situations (infidelity, promiscuity, straying from the church, comedic funerals, obnoxious and overbearing family members), Perry's productions also introduce a bit of spirituality with each story's ending dependent upon DIVINE INTERVENTION making things right. Some of the acting performances are a little over the top, and the musical selections, though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists, are weak in the lyrics department; however, as a whole, the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational.

Perry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by Hollywood, and is having great success on both the stage and screen.

This compilation lets the viewer experience and/or revisit those money-making stage shows.",1151280000,26,1324,5.957894736842105
