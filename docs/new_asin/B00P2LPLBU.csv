However, if your looking for a demo of HOW to chop, dice, julienne etc. You will not find it here. All of the ingredients are in bowls already and you watch Andrea literally put them into pots, or a blender or food processor.  Also, these are not complete meals, nor are there any menu suggestions given.",1426896000,2,408,4.368421052631579
