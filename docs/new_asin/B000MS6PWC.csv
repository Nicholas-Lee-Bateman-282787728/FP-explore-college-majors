8171589,5,B000MS6PWC,"I am 50 years old as is Duran Duran's Simon LeBon. Listening to 80's music and watching 80's videos remind me of some of the very best days of my life. Kajagoogoo, like Duran Duran, is one of the greatest pop bands from the best days of MTV. Remember when MTV was fun and uplifting to watch?! Remember you could see fun stuff like Kajagoogoo videos on MTV? I hate MTV today. Anyway, this 3 song VHS is a must-have item if you are an 80's and/or Kajagoogoo fan. I preserved my Kajagoogoo VHS onto DVD so I can enjoy it until I croak-off someday. Kajagoogoo should make more music...",1238112000,4,581,4.290909090909091
