5116931,5,B0081FSMMO,"I've never been one for westerns. My Dad, on the other hand, is. He has seen his most favorite Western, Tombstone, several times, so, of course, he made me watch it. I was very surprised. No other Western was as gripping or witty as Tombstone, and has since become one of my favorite movies.

So when previews of Hatfields & Mccoys started appearing on the History Channel, I was slightly interested. My Dad was definitely ecstatic as we were both counting down the days. I was a little surprised, in a good way, when I saw Part 1 on Memorial Day. I was expecting a lot more action, I was expecting it to be more like Tombstone. Instead I saw the origins of the feud that slowly escalated into the backstabbing, murdering, hatred-filled families that we all know.

Beginning in the Civil War with the two ""Leaders"" of the families, Randall Mccoy and ""Devil"" Anse Hatfield fought as comrades in the Confederacy, until Anse deserted the army. It is here that the seeds of hate had been placed, as Randall would never forgive Anse for what he done. These two would drag down the two families with them, whether they wanted too or not. From here we see a dramatic tale of betrayal, deceit, romance, and tragedy that will leave you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.

For those who love Westerns, or even those who don't, I highly recommend buying this, or otherwise seeing it on the History Channel. With high production values, talented actors, and a gripping tale, this is the must see series of the year that will likely rival some of the best summer blockbusters.",1338336000,27,1576,4.561837455830389
5116932,4,B0081FSMMO,"The History Channel has given us some memorable series (""Life After People"", ""How the States Got Their Shapes""), so I looked forward to their movement into mini-series in competition with PBS and Biography who have given us some really great mini series (e.g., Ken Burns' ""The Civil War"").

The ""Hatfields and McCoys"" chronicles the feud between the two families, lasting from approximately 1865 to 1890, involving the murder of dozens of people, the use of state militias from two states, and even the intervention of the US Supreme Court.

Despite the fame of the classic feud, it has only occasionally been covered in film (""Roseanna McCoy"", 1949) or TV (""The Hatfields and the McCoys, 1975).

The current mini-series features some top notch actors (Kevin Costner, Bill Paxton, Tom Berenger, Powers Boothe, Mare Winningham), excellent production values, art and set direction. One gets the sense of the time and place, although the series does move through decades without any apparent changes in the principals and/or the locations.

Kudos to Tom Berenger who gives a great performance as the psychopathic Hatfield uncle who sets the feud in motion.

If the material is interesting, IMO it lacks engagement, partly because there is no one to root for. Each group consists of back stabbing, liquor swilling, bible thumping psychopaths and/or half wits, and the only character who seems to have some sense of proportion is Powers Boothe, who is on camera far too little. Even the ""romeo and juliette"" romance has such flawed characters it's hard to get behind anyone.

Because the history (with a few minor exceptions) and the production values are so good, what we have here is a very good history lesson, which doesn't necessarily make for an excellent drama

Bottom line - good history, but if you're looking for drama you'll have to look hard to find someone to root for.

BTW - if stories about backwoods people is your interest, you might enjoy the TV series ""Justified"" or these films - ""Grapes of Wrath"" (1940), ""Tobacco Road"" (1941), ""Deliverance"" (1972), and ""Winter's Bone"" (2010).",1338336000,12,2094,5.04927536231884
5116933,5,B0081FSMMO,"I'm quite the history buff, so you see why this three part series is so appealing to me.  Kevin Kostner has dropped the ball in the past a bit, but from what Ive seen of the series thus far, it seems that they are trying to stay within the bounds of historic correctness.  Mel Gibson bit the big one with 'Braveheart', where the only thing correct about the movie was William Wallaces' name.
I'm thorougly enjoying this series and can't wait for the conclusion.  My wife works nights, so my plan is to purchase this series in the near future.  An avid fan of history.",1338336000,9,567,4.371428571428571

5116948,5,B0081FSMMO,"Clocking in at just under five hours, this mini-series is a very well-done fictionalization of Kentuckys infamous Hatfield vs McCoy feud. With Kevin Costner and the late Bill Paxton headlining an excellent cast, the show is very well-shot (as, unfortunately, are many of the characters). Romania stands in for Kentucky, and its very apparent that a lot of money was put into this production. The sets and exteriors both look great, and there isn't a whiff of cheapness anywhere to be found. Some might find it a tad long, but this is a story that couldn't easily have been told in the movie-length foramt. The miniseries chronicles the birth of the feud between both family patriarchs during a Civil War battle and runs all the way to its bloody termination. Theres plenty of gunfights, drama, and even a little character development along the way, and afficionados of the western genre (even though this is technically an eastern) should find a lot to enjoy here. Extra features are pretty bare-bones, limited to a small amount of behind-the-scenes documentary footage, but considering the price of this set on Amazon, it still makes for excellent value.  Highly recommended.",1513987200,,1176,5.030769230769231

5116976,5,B0081FSMMO,"while most reviewers tend to look upon this film as a morality play, I do not.  It reminds me of the Iliad.  Costner and his crew deserve a great deal of credit for showing the lifestyle of my ancesters -- the Appalachian pioneers.  I call us all in fondness ""white trash'.  Many criticize it for not being accurate.  Was the Iliad accurate?  Achilles was quite likely sleeping off a huge hangover.  But an accountant's accuracy is not the point.  Costner shows the effect of the Civil War on these mountain men as well as their sense of  responsibility for their respective clans.  In an era of effeminacy this does seem shocking.  But these people lived much harder lives than than descendents..  Anyway the film captures the essence of that time and era.  While I found much of it hard viewing, I applaude Costner for not sugar coating the violence. I noticed an attempt to show the mountain background  but I think more could have been made of how the beautiful but harsh environment conditioned the people.  I was sorry they didn't use the real West Virginia and Kentucky but I don't suppose it was feasible..  Costner has a real feeling for that era.  Hi s Wyatt Earp was excellent too.",1498867200,2,1192,4.6

5117019,5,B0081FSMMO,"The mentality of the warring parties never forgive  never forget becomes the enduring theme. Kevin is the Hatfield patriarch: Bill Paxton is the McCoy patriarch. The accompanying documentary on this DVD which covers the making of this historical re-enactment is the icing on the cake.
Initially on the same side, fighting for the Confederate cause, when the war is over Anse Hatfield and Randall McCoy engages in warfare. The initial fall out resulted from a land dispute that had already been smouldering because Hatfield deserted during the war, whereas McCoy remained and ended up suffering in a POW camp. Hate and warfare blow out of control following other misunderstandings. These are complicated and escalated by illicit love then result in further bloodbaths and murder. Even though this epic is based on a true story, Hatfields and McCoys draw in elements from Shakespeare. This western is reminiscent of: Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and War of the Roses. As with Romeo and Juliet the fued holds the entire community to hostage and is amplified by constant violent reprisals.

Ironically, not all the Hatfields and McCoys seek to engage in hate and warfare, other weaker individuals are drawn into the mayhem, while those who resist participating are pressured. This is a classic tale of revenge and the destructiveness and immorality created by those who take the law into their own hands. The lovers who want to transcend the hatred between their clans are victimised and their relationships ultimately destroyed.

Despite the graphic violence this is a human story and the characters suffering draws audience sympathy.",1476403200,,1628,5.206106870229007

5117043,5,B0081FSMMO,"I got this from my local library, and I must say it was so good I am going to get my own copy. I will definitely be watching this again. One of Costner's best performances, probably his best since JFK IMHO. He's perfect as Devil Anse, not over the top, but cold and calculating like Al Pacino's Michael Corleone.

I am a Jazz aficionado, I saw the latest Miles Davis film Miles Ahead, and was somewhat let down by the artistic license taken in that film. I am an expert of Miles Davis so that film while generally getting rave reviews has had a lukewarm reception by true aficionados. I hear some of the same criticism about this film, perhaps bending of the historical facts rubs some the wrong way?

I only generally know the history of the Hatfield's and the McCoy's, I studied some before I watched this, but in no way am I an expert. Perhaps that's why I liked this so much? It's brutal and realistic, and about what I would think it was like in the hills of Kentucky and West Virginia circa 1880. I did not know the feud lasted so long, basically 30 long years. I also did not know so many were killed.

The tit for tat, hell bent on getting even at all costs story is chilling and can really serve as a warning for any human being that gets consumed with revenge to the point of it costing you everything.

I was left thinking, what if this had been on HBO? They could have really upped the violence and language to even more realistic levels? Even so, this is one brutal, realistic classic film and no wonder Costner won an Emmy, it was well deserved.",1464652800,,1559,4.292517006802721

5117171,4,B0081FSMMO,"We missed the first episode of this when it was aired last year and for some reason it just seemed to stop and so we missed the start and the end of this apparently famous Western feud. Having received it as a Christmas gift, watching it from start to finish it definitely makes a bit more sense. Not surprisingly, the initiation of the feud is over an event which, understandably, a couple of friends might reasonably fall-out but given that the main protagonists are stubborn, pig-headed and frankly thoroughly unpleasant characters, it is easy to understand how a full-blown bloodbath feud would ensue. And it does. This less than inspiring episode in American history is a telling insight into the American national psyche; the aforementioned stubbornness and pig-headedness, their heartfelt conviction that they are right all of the time, their proclivity for conflict by proxy and, of course, their absolute assertion that God is on their side.

However much one might tut and shake ones head over the pointlessness of it all, you can't help but appreciate the effort made with the production. The cast are excellent once you learn to distinguish the mumbling characters hidden beneath their identical hats, coats and beards and the environment is authentically grimy and realistic (mind you, leaves on the trees when it was supposed to be new-year was a bit sloppy). Nobody seems to do much work though (except for the brood-mare women of course) and there's a lot of drinking & general bad behaviour to be done by way of entertainment (thank goodness for the telly!).

A well made and insightful portrayal of events at a pivotal period in American history as the Wild West gave grudging way to civilisation and the rule of law. Definitely worth a watch.",1421452800,,1761,4.925925925925926

5117174,5,B0081FSMMO,"It's great to see in recent years TV show studios putting the same amount of effort into TV shows as is given to movies, script wise, costume wise and budget wise.  If you're a fan of Hell on Wheels, you'll love this three episode mini series.  Sure you could analyse this against what really happened and find a lot of disparities between this fictional version and what really happened but it isn't marketed or sold as a documentary so I have no problem with that.  If anything people watching this will be encouraged to research what really happened.  I remember when I was back in high school and a couple of other kids used Young Guns to do a presentation on Billy the Kid that they'd then researched further and presented the real facts as well to the class, and no doubt kids could do the same with this.

The acting in this, not just by the two heads of the families Costner and Paxton but by pretty much the entire cast, is done extremely well.  You definitely hate some and like some characters like you're supposed to when watching something like this.  This was actually filmed in Romania, the DVD version I have has a lengthy special feature on this being made there, including the construction of the towns, the costumes, the actors learning to shoot the old weapons, and the armourist getting mad at those not treating his weapons with respect, a few were dangerously fired when they shouldn't have been.  Some studios may have been inclined to cover that sort of thing up, so I respect that they included that.

TV shows like this along with others such as Hell on Wheels, Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones have shown that if you're prepared to invest money and resources into something, viewers will watch it.",1421280000,,1725,4.574675324675325

But don't let the lengthy feature scare you away, this story draws you in and makes you part of the family on both sides. It is very intense, you learn of how two clans go from partnership to all out war against each other to the bitter end. You can't help but develop feelings for family members on both sides. This is one of those movies that stays with you awhile after you watch it, emotional and gripping! And probably a contributor that is, it's a true story, or close to one.

5117274,4,B0081FSMMO,"In asking how Christian is the History Channel's miniseries Hatfield & McCoys I do not mean that it was done by a Christian production company, that it has Christian actors and certainly not that it is a series without sexual immorality, crude language and terrible violence.  What I am saying is that the story line concerning the two leaders of the feud has a profoundly Christian message.
 (If you haven't seen the series, you might not want to read further, since I give away the ending in what follows.)
 The 3rd and final episode of the miniseries shows the end of the feud and the end of the two leaders of the two families--Randall McCoy and Anderson ""Devil Anse"" Hatfield.  As I argued in my previous post, Hatifields & McCoys: Family Values (You can find it by following this link [...]), Randall McCoy's self-justifying identification of Christianity with his own interests is idolatry.  Hatfields & McCoys vividly portrays the self-destructive end of such a pseudofaith.  When McCoy tragically loses several members of his family to Hatfield attacks, he abandons his false faith in prayer, the Bible and God.  He discovers that his wife's criticism that his prayers seldom work was valid.  He then becomes consumed with vengeance and loses any remaining sense of justice, as well as his sanity, the family he supposedly was fighting for, and finally his life.  In a drunken stupor and alone in his cabin he burns family pictures in the fireplace.  The sleeve of his shirt catches fire, and he perishes as the cabin burns to the ground.
 Randall McCoy created a faith out of his own interests.  His theology was self-centered rather than God-centered.  Such an ideology, to use Karl Marx's term for philosophical or theological justifications of self-interest, results in isolation, insanity and finally death.  Randall McCoy began with the desire to defend his family.  Because his theology was centered on his own interests, in the end he lost his family.  Because his theology was the creation of his own mind, he was left alone with his thoughts and became insane.  Because his theology was his life, when it failed him, he died.  In fact, his end was a vivid picture of hell--a lonely lost soul being consumed by the flames of its own bitterness.
 In contrast, ""Devil Anse"" Hatfield, while a brutal leader of his side in the infamous feud, at times shows an ability to see beyond his own self-interest and understand the other person's perspective.  For example, he recognizes that ""Bad"" Frank Phillips was only doing his job as a Pinkerton dectective when, in self-defense, he killed two of Hatfield's kinsmen.  Because his culture's perverted sense of justice required him to do something about Phillips, Hatfield pays him  to leave town rather than kill him.  In the end, Hatfield recognizes that the feud is destroying his family as well as McCoy's.  Rather than rescuing his son from execution or avenge him, he publicly calls off the feud so that litterally there could be peace in the valley.
  It would appear that Hatfield, perhaps unconcsiously, had recognized the truth of Jesus' words that he who lives by the sword dies by the sword (Matthew 26:52).  On a personal level he saw that true justice and peace came with a recognition of one's own sins and the need for forgiveness from God.  The series ends with ""Devil"" being baptized in the river with family and church members looking on.  A true Christian theology, one that comes from God and not our self-interests and that both condemns us and offers us forgiveness through faith and repentance, brings peace and sanity and life.
 Historically speaking, it is true that Randall McCoy died in a cabin fire and seems to have never recovered from the feud.  The series's portrayal of his false faith is plausible and certainly dramatically effective, but I can't verify it historically.  The end of Anderson Hatfield is factual.  At age 72 he accepted Christ as his savior in a revival meeting and was baptized on September 23, 1911.  He died peacefully several years later, a part of the greater and eternal family, the family of God.  I have heard that many of his descendants are practicing Christians.  The reality of the gospel that causes us to put God in the center of our life rather than self or family saves us and others.  ""Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it"" (Matthew 10:39).  Now, that's the gospel!",1404000000,,4445,4.830687830687831
5117275,5,B0081FSMMO,Kevin Coster is one of my favorite actors and he and Bill Paxton did a bang up job in this one. I did alittle research on the Hatfields and McCoys and there were somethings in the movie that weren't right but alot of it was true. Even though it is pretty violent it was good. I wanted this in my library and am not sorry in anyway for this purchase.,1403913600,,349,4.0

5117281,5,B0081FSMMO,This is one of the best TV mini-series ever!  The story and the acting are fantastic!  I highly recommend it!,1402790400,,109,4.4
5117282,4,B0081FSMMO,This is an extremely long movie but very well made. I watched this over two snowy days. I like Kevin Costner as an actor in a lot of movies and I thought he played his part exceptionally well.,1402531200,,192,4.078947368421052

5117284,3,B0081FSMMO,"While I enjoyed the movie in terms of entertainment, I did not find it to be anywhere close to historically accurate. For example, although they show Anse Hatfield as having deserted from the Confederate army - which is apparently true - there is no mention that he was part of the home guard along with his uncle Jim Vance. Rosanna and Nancy McCoy are depicted as having been about the same age when in fact Nancy was at least four years younger than her cousin - she was only 16 when she married Johnson Hatfield. Frank Philips is depicted as a man well into his thirties when in fact he was only in his twenties. Frank is depicted as having been shot and dying on the spot when he actually died some time afterwards and was almost forty years old at the time of his death. Perry Cline is depicted as a single man with the hots for Rossana when in fact he was married to one Martha Adkins, (Some sources give her last name as McCoy, but if so, she must have been married to a McCoy before she married Cline. The film indicates that Cline was victim to fraud in the case of the land claimed by Hatfield, but in fact a WV court awarded the land to Hatfield as damages after Hatfield sued Cline for ""stealing timber"" off of the land, which Cline had received as an inheritance. Cline's sister was the wife of Asa McCoy, who was believed to have been murdered by Jim Vance in early 1865. As entertainment, the movie is okay but don't depend on it as a historical account of the famous feud.",1402185600,,1488,4.298932384341637

5117295,4,B0081FSMMO,"A mini series that garnered many accolades.
Kevin Costner and Bill Patton are extremely good as the opposing Hatfield and McCoy combatants.
The other cast members are equally as good and the set design and costuming take you back to the deep south at a time when their world was, for them, destroyed.",1396828800,,300,4.679245283018868

5117297,5,B0081FSMMO,"Excellent .... Well done. Great acting.
This mini series was unwatchable when originally televised, due to the complete over stuffing , saturating, infuriating quantity of commercials the network crammed in. It was actually stress inducing to try and watch when it was aired. I couldn't even get through it at that time. I knew it was a good movie, but stopped watching when the 4th 5 minute commercial interrupted the show in the first 40 minutes. Glad I bought the DVD.",1396569600,,471,4.827160493827161

5117300,5,B0081FSMMO,"Not being a historian of this event I cannot vouch for the authenticity and truth.  However, being someone who watches a lot of movies I can say for a fact, this is one great series.
  There's a historically based feud between the Hatfields and McCoys that had been going on for so long most parties forgot the reason it started in the first place.  They were just happy to have a focus to aim the violence to in the form of a person.  They needed something to enrich their miserable lives.  Enter a pig.  The stage is set.

Worth watching over and over.",1395446400,,554,4.310679611650485
5117301,5,B0081FSMMO,Kevin Costner and his cast are all very convincing actors in this historical tale of the two famous neighboring clans who frequently clashed with one another back in the late 1800's.,1395187200,,182,4.903225806451613

I stopped watching because the accent gets thick and the story is depressing: an angry, humiliating scar on the face of American history.  I have studied records and correspondence.  People in general were better than this.  They may have been poor and experienced hardship, but our forebears were decent, dignified, principled human beings.

This story is one of the oldest stories in American history and now everyone knows the story in much more detail and with a greater understanding of the feud. Weird as it was. The performances were outstanding. Mare Winningham is GREAT (as usual) in this film. Should have gotten an Emmy for her performance. As Paxton should have shared it with Cosner! Great acting by everyone. That war was such a terrible thing as all wars are but that more so than any other for Americans. Hell people are still fighting the war down here in the South! Grudges are a terrible burden to carry around and can lead to death and destruction as they do in this story. Funny thing about the film is that much of Appalachia is still, in many ways, just the same today as it is depicted in this film. Hell, just a couple of years ago a U.S. Census worker was hung from a tree in Kentucky! WHY? Who knows. Ignorance is my guess. Too much inbreeding. But that's another subject altogether.

When i opened the package, there was no problems with it and the seller ever put a personal message in there with it stating that if I was not happy with the product or if it got damaged during shipping then I could send it back and they would replace the order Free of charge! they would even cover the shipping and handling as well.  Plus the price for this full movie pack is AMAZING!!! walmart sells this for 30.00 bucks and its only half the movie, you have to pend 30 more bucks for the other half!

5117381,5,B0081FSMMO,"The Hatfields and McCoys plays out on screen impeccably, thanks to bulls-eye performances by the entire cast, most notably Kevin Costner, who assumes the role of the formidable ""Devil Anse,"" with an astonishing likeness.  Granted, Costner is one very versatile actor who defies typecasting. Yet...the thought of the boyishly handsome, even-featured, Kevin Costner playing the role of craggy, hook-nosed patriarch, Devil Anse Hatfield, seems  unimaginable and ill advised. But we are talking about Kevin Costner, of course, the same actor who appears equally at home on a baseball diamond, putting green. Indian settlement, and a world under water.  To say he mastered the part of Devil Anderson (""Anse"") Hatfield would be giving the actor short shrift. He became the man in every sense of the word -- gestures, locution, facial expressions.

The mini-series captures the raw essence of frontier life in rural Appalachia but galvanizes the mundane with gunshots, grit and hair-trigger reactions. The imperative to defend what is theirs seems to reflect the survivor mentality of settlers in rural America. However, a continual call to arms represents the extreme extent to which these two clans will go in their efforts to defend their property and their families. The curious may search for an explanation as to what caused these people to settle their disputes differently from other Americans living during that era.

Surprisingly, filming took place in the forests of Transylvania, Romania, at the Carpathian Mountain foothills, a setting which apparently simulates the untamed, rustic beauty of Appalachia quite effectively.

Convincing performances by an extraordinary ensemble of actors pump energy, family pride and a firestorm of emotions into every second of this 3-part series.  Matt Barr plays Johnsie Hatfield, the charming, handsome suitor of Rosanna McCoy, played by Jennifer Pulsivar. The searing, hormonal fusion between these achingly beautiful lovers leads to a wrenching resolution.

Lest the film's critics decry the movie's lack of humor, it should be noted that the story focuses primarily on the legendary feud, hardly a reason to make merry.  Additionally, frontier settlers designated special occasions for gaiety which often involved the entire townsfolk, as depicted at the beginning of the series and in a later scene, which actually shows Devil Anse and his wife dancing.

Neither family submits to idle conversation; there is work to be done and money to be made, not to mention axes to grind.  Interestingly, the film's arresting moments need little in the way of verbal enhancement.  One scene of particular intensity involves Devil Anse's instantaneous, harsh reaction towards son, Johnsie, after learning of the young man's romantic involvement with Rosanna McCoy.  Devil Anse evidently possesses a short fuse but a long memory; even after Johnsie and Rosanna's romance has ended, he beholds Johnsie with a calculated, menacing demeanor, so much so that when he announces his intent to take the boy on a fishing outing his wife looks on with abject fear and foreboding. The question ringing through the silence seems to ask whether the Hatfield clan - and indeed, Devil Anse's own children - are exempt from his violent, often deadly, acts of vengeance.

Hatfields and McCoys throws no stones, but makes no bones, either, about the priorities and truths those mountain people held dear, and the unconventional means by which they upheld them.",1377820800,2,3476,5.354128440366972

The series depicted the conflict with a great deal of historical accuracy.  The story is a sad one and reminds us of the enduring truth that settling scores with those who have hurt us, somehow, only leads to more hurt and pain. The other side invariably thinks you are ""on up"" on them.  Then they have to even things out, and the cycle continues and become more violent.

Everyone in the movie is a real person.  The families finally signed a truce in 2009.  Each family has history of the people involved.  Some of this may be fabricated or exaggerated for TV, but it is based on actual events.

I have hard headed people like them in my own family.  If you think of the ""Stand Your Ground Laws"" today, you will understand how people could think the way they did back then.

5117432,5,B0081FSMMO,"Being a native West Virginian, this was the first film I thought was historically accurate.
The conditions in West Virginia and Kentucky are correctly shown, and it shows there were no winners.  Everyone lost.",1369958400,,209,5.147058823529412
5117433,2,B0081FSMMO,I truly love this story... but the Blu-ray I got from Amazon over-heats and skips a lot. Checked the player and works great. Not much for on-line shopping sooo back to the stone age for me. (Receipts for returns). :),1369872000,,216,4.425
5117434,5,B0081FSMMO,Great mini-series. Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton did an amazing job. The music was great. The setting was fantastic and the supporting actors did great jobs as well. I watched it with my grandfather in one day and he loved it. Job well done.,1369785600,,241,4.5
5117435,5,B0081FSMMO,"We watched this on TV when it aired and purchased this as a lighting deal for my husband's grandfather as a Christmas gift because we enjoyed the show so much.  It is a very well done show, and the actors do a great job.  We really enjoyed watching it.",1369785600,,252,4.122448979591836
5117436,5,B0081FSMMO,"I watched this when it was originally broadcast and thoroughly loved it.  I was very pleased to find that I could purchase the DVD set here for such a deal.  When I watched it, I did not watch it to learn history, but to enjoy a story.  I've read reviews that negatively state that the historical accuracy of this depiction is way off.  One of the allures of this story is that there is so little historical record concerning the legendary feud.  Filmmakers are always granted artistic license when producing historical dramas or historical fictions, to make the story sell and be more entertaining.  I was entertained, and they sold me into purchasing the DVD set.  We may never know what happened to spark this family rivalry, but I appreciate the producers attempts in this story to try to incorporate many of the commonly accepted ideas as they could.  Good show!",1369785600,2,867,4.695364238410596
5117437,3,B0081FSMMO,"I am not a big fan of Mr. Costner.  Ok, ""Dancing with Wolves"" did I get the title correct, was a great movie.  This one satisfied my history quest, but I felt both leads were miscast.  I was at the end, so glad our neighbors are so great.  I cannot image having a grudge that huge,",1369699200,,281,3.9642857142857144

5117441,4,B0081FSMMO,The movie on tv was awesome!!!! Which is why I ordered my own copy.  However after waiting a few weeks and not getting it...I questioned Amazon who very quickly looked into and found out that the company I'd ordered it through had gone out if business and not told anyone.  So I got a refund and will try again.  I don't have good things to say about the company but Amazon and Hatfields and McCoys are still great :),1369353600,,417,4.253164556962025

5117443,5,B0081FSMMO,"Really enjoyed the show, it kept me entertained through all three episodes. I recommend watching the series straight through but 4.5 hrs is quite a bit for one sitting. Received package on time and the package was well protected.",1369353600,,229,4.897435897435898
5117444,4,B0081FSMMO,"A piece of history that is difficult to believe until you watch this movie. Great acting, but a lot of brutal violence. Action packed and educational for those old western fans. Not recommeded for children.",1369180800,,206,4.914285714285715

One of Costner's best performances.  Once you see this you will be thankful you did not live in that era. Buy it, you won't be sorry. Kat",1368921600,,283,3.8275862068965516

5117450,4,B0081FSMMO,"HATFIELDS & McCOYS is well-acted and well-filmed. According to some other reviewers, many of the historical fine points are inaccurate. Nevertheless, it relates the basic story very well, and, most importantly, gives an impartial dual-focus of the two clans and the complex nature of their snowballing feud.

The whole flavor of the film is that of a very good made-for-TV western--or perhaps ""eastern"" is the proper term. By necessity, of course, it's repetitively violent and full of shoot-'em-ups, hangings, and such, and is often rather depressing, with little humor or any other form of relief. Many may find this 290-minute TV miniseries a bit hard to watch in one or two nights. Still, it's a very captivating story whose beautiful scenery provides excellent contrast with its grim plot. Actually filmed in the Carpatian Mountains of Romania (!), but, aside from some stagey-looking buildings, it could have fooled me into thinking I was looking at authentic Appalachia.",1368403200,,977,5.262820512820513
5117451,5,B0081FSMMO,This was very good acting when we watched it on TV and we just had to have a copy of our own. Perhaps some of the facts were played with a little but it made for a good story. It's surprising just how many younger people (under 40) have never heard of the feud. Guess we are just getting older!,1368230400,,294,3.9166666666666665
5117452,5,B0081FSMMO,You won't even want to pause it to take a potty break! One of the best movies I have watched in a long time.,1368144000,,108,3.5416666666666665
5117453,5,B0081FSMMO,"I grew up down south and heard a lot about this controversy but never knew how bad it was. This movie is AWESOME!!!! and you can't help but take sides, I chose the Hatfields side, lol but It definitely gets you thinking how some small things can grow into major problems and pride can destroy all hope of resolve.",1368144000,,313,4.322033898305085

5117458,5,B0081FSMMO,A must see for anyone who enjoys westerns or is a Costner fan. I'm glad they didn't try to pack it in a two hour movie as it wouldn't have done the story justice. Lots of action and gritty. Spent time developing the characters so you cared about what happened to them.  I'm surprised a movie like this wasn't made earlier since their names are such a familiar part of American history.,1367712000,,385,4.347222222222222

The acting is superb, the writing excellent, and the characters draw you in so effectively, you can hardly stand to turn it off.

5117486,5,B0081FSMMO,"Our entire family watched this series on the History Channel.  Since we live in West Virginia, we were very familiar with the Feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys, so it was interesting to see how close the movie would be to actual events.  I have read several books (some written by either a McCoy or Hatfield descendant) about the feud.  I just wish the movie had been filmed in the most beautiful state-- West Virginia (Yes, I am very prejudiced there!), instead of being filmed in Romania.",1364515200,,498,4.636363636363637

We didn't know much about the Hatfields and McCoys so we don't know how true to the actual events the movie held.  It was a lot to take in all at once and we will need to watch it again to pick up some of the fine points.  Be aware that this movie does contain senseless violence based on nothing but family traditions and grudges.,1363392000,,411,4.1645569620253164

can testify to how backwards their thinking is.  The vocabulary and events
were acurately depicted but the actors are too attractive to realistically portray
these hillbillies.  We know hillbillies don't have nice teeth like these actors and

5117539,5,B0081FSMMO,"This blu-ray refused to play on my BD player, even tho' I have multi region capacity. All other US blu-ray discs have been fine. Amazon were great and replaced original copy but problem remained. Solved by burning an mp4 version and watched the series. Is excellent, a real gritty and authentic piece of Americana. Costner and Paxton as the titular leads are brilliant. Complex, multi-faceted characters whom you both admire and despair of simultaneously. Truly excellent in almost every department, beautifully filmed locales capture the guts and the glory of the Appalachians, both stunning and brutal. The family feud is shown from both sides in all it's misguided and moralistic ignorance and misplaced honour, but also in the inexorable descent into tragedy that cost both families much more than they could ever recapture. That said, the sense of family, the tribal aspect, and the individuals involved are appealing (in the whole) and never painted in one dimension. If you loved Lonesome Dove, this is almost as good if not as epic. If you loved Deadwood, this is almost as gritty, without the language and blatant sexuality. Highly recommend it. (And thanks to Amazon for trying to fix the issue.)",1360540800,,1206,5.065326633165829

One day I looked at my suggested items on Amazon, and this Blu-Ray set popped up.  I sat down and watched the 5 hours of story over two days and loved every minute.  The filmmakers transport the viewer back into the time and place of the years of the feud even better than I expected.  The cast leaves nothing to be desired either.  The only complaint I have is that they took some liberties with the facts, nothing serious, just made certain parts of the story a little more ""Hollywood"".",1359849600,,623,4.3826086956521735

5117570,5,B0081FSMMO,"Grudges and fools often go hand in hand.  When the events of importance in one's life lead to disagreement, holding a grudge is one way some handle it. This grudge between friends went on way too long, creating vicious involvement of family members on both sides.  It became a clan-style feud that touched generations, and neighbors, and even state governments. While holding onto principles they mostly forgot, these two men became fools who could not yield their point, costing lives in the process.

This production of the Hatfields and McCoys really was well done. Though there may be some artistic variations of the truth, the story was compellig history. You got to know the mountain people and their basic level of living. The scenes were true to the country they lived in, the lack of education, and the sheer poverty surrounding them. But family ties were close and strong, the kind you need for survival in a hostile environment. The family love and intimacy were depicted well. The struggle of loyalty and care for the vulnerable was shown, even among hard hearted people. It took the militia and some bounty hunters to bring the questions to legal resolution.  This true story even ties you to the real places of important events.

When watching, you will know that it is based on real lives, but it is on it's own for acting skills and slightly bent history. A bit romantacized, but very entertaining. You can argue that it does not reflect true events, but get by that and it is a good rolicking story.  Just don't do a historical forensics on it, just enjoy it for what it is.  A good tale.",1358380800,,477,4.0638297872340425

The story of the Hatfields & McCoys is a well know legend.  Although some of the historical facts were incorrect, it was still an interesting storyline.  I was fascinated as the story played out. Kevin Costner, playing ""Devil"" Anse and Bill Patton was good as the head of the McCoy. I was particularly impressed with Tom Berrenger's performance. This film brought out that Kentucky and Virginia almost went to war because of this feud, that was an amazing fact that I handn't realized.

This film is worth buying, it had everything: murder, kidnapping, fights, court room battles, drinking and sex.

the Northern war of aggression. Times were very hard. People were
starving all over. In the movie there is an argument over a pig. And many
people these days think that would be crazy. But in those days that pig
would mean the difference of weather you had food or not over the winter.

5117693,4,B0081FSMMO,"This film was a nice surprise. Although I am sure that they took some editorial liberties, this film is pretty darn accurate from a historical perspective. The Hatfields and McCoys have been wrongfully stereotyped over the years as being a bunch of barefoot, moonshining hicks. Thankfully, this film accurately portrays the more complex nature of each locally prominent family and their patriarchs. Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton both perform at their best in this documentary. I found myself rooting for both sides at various parts of the film but I think I sided with one side (I won't tell you which one!) in the end.

This film is worth watching and I highly recommend it to anyone who is enjoys the History Channel and/or Western films. After watching it, I bought this film for my brother for Christmas and he loved it.",1356739200,2,824,4.802816901408451

My only complaint is the muting of color that the film makers used. I assume it was to present it as ""looking historical, or aged"", To me, I kept wondering if every day of the late 19th century was overcast. The union army jackets were hardly even blue in color, and I didn't see many reds or yellows, either.

The grey and dingy effect was tiresome after a few hours.",1356480000,,503,4.294736842105263

5117758,5,B0081FSMMO,"Honestly, I didn't think they made Westerns like this anymore, let alone on cable TV. However, this was a very fine production which held my interest from beginning to end.

The cast (led by Costner and Paxton) in this mini-series was simply excellent, as were the script and music. Also, the sepia-tone quality of the film struck a perfect balance between the old and the new - well done!

There are some apparent historical inaccuracies present (kind of ironic for the History Channel), which I can forgive in the name of artistic license. What this mini-series does so well is to capture the pot-boiling-over family feud in such an entertaining manner.

""Hat""s off to all those involved in the Hatfield & McCoys as it's the best production I've seen on cable since Battlestar Galactica. Yup, this mini-series is the real ""McCoy"".",1355184000,,832,4.886524822695035

I was also interested in how the families tried to bring the ""law""into the feud. There was an attempt to compromise and negotiate, . Was also surprised at the national impact of this unfortunate feud. Too bad these families couldn't forgive and forget. But, the Palestinians and the Jews don't seem to be able to do it.

Although it is not 100% accurate , it does come close to explaining the drama that unveiled in a very entertaining way.

5117773,4,B0081FSMMO,"This is a powerful recreation of one of the most famous feuds in history. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear why this particular feud had such an impact on the American legal system and why it has become inscribed on the modern psyche. Although quite long and extremely violent, this rendition of the story adopts a detailed approach which is effective in not only placing the tale firmly in its social context, but in drawing out those elements which transcend the period. It is a thought-provoking exploration of family loyalty in its positive and negative aspects. The performances are stunningly good. Kevin Costner and Tom Berenger were never better.",1354492800,,659,5.0

I have often heard of the Hatfield/McCoy feud while I was growing up in Ohio, but had never heard any details of what all took place. I found many parts of this movie to be sad, and learned so many things I never knew about the feud. I felt sorry for the wives and children who suffered because the men from both clans couldn't get along. So sad that the two families allowed things to get so far out of hand. I feel this movie was very well directed and the actors/actresses all deserve an award. Best movie I have watched in some time. Everyone should watch this one.",1354320000,,633,4.283333333333333

Really, really bad, and I was looking forward to seeing it. The one good thing in it is Kevin Costner's performance, but even he has to spout some of the worst contrived dialog this side of the original Star Wars. Where to start? It's too long by at least 2 hours. The dialog appears to have been written by writers who based their knowledge of how backwoods people talk by multiple viewings of ""The Wonderful Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia"". That film also seems to be the basis of most of the supporting cast's characterizations. Yeech.

It is chock full of the good ol' ultraviolence, so if that's your cup of tea, enjoy!",1351987200,10,814,4.537414965986395

5117805,3,B0081FSMMO,"I rate this production 3 stars because of casting, costumes, props and  cinematography (all of which rate 4 to 5 stars), but I rate the teleplay as 2 stars. The teleplay elevates Costner character (Devil Hatfield) to superhuman status - typical in Costner films - while roping viewers into liberal cliches about the Civil War, life in southern back-country, sex and Christianity.

Typical of Devil Hatfield character development is the opening scene of this series in which, single-handed, Costner wards off a company-sized assault by Union forces after explaining to Bill Paxton's character (Randall McCoy) that he doesn't need no Christian God to help him. Moreover, McCoy's character development is Christian and according to liberal cliches - McCoy is never superhuman, is married to a wife more plain than secular Hatfields' busty brunette, and is palpably less intelligent than the all-knowing Hatfield.

The cast of characters - all back country southerners - are depicted, according to liberal cliche, as dependent upon moonshine for income and hydration, given to irresponsible sex, squalid living and occasional church attendance under direction of hypocritical preachers. If you'e old enough to remember the ""Bonanza"" television series, Costner plays the equivalent of Ben Cartwright, all-knowing, all-wise land baron amidst lesser mortals.

The final reason the teleplay rates just 2 stars is the way in which it draws the viewer into the vengeful life of the warring families - the film appeals to our baser instincts. As the story unfolds the viewer finds himself targeting certain characters for assassination, just as in the film ""Godfather"" one actually feels sympathy at times for the mob Corleone family. Great writers can depict evil without maneuvering to resonate with the evil that lies dormant, most of the time, within all (or, at least most) of us.",1350777600,3,1874,5.320945945945946

5117822,4,B0081FSMMO,"Like most people, I had heard of the Hatfield/McCoy feud all my life but didn't know any of the specific origins of it. The A&E dramatization was especially well researched and cast.  With any historic representation, it is essential to be factual because there will most assuredly be a lot of people who be checking how accurate you were.  I didn't recognize Tom Berringer until the end of the movie.  His makeup was very well done.  Kudos to Jena Malone and Lindsay Pulsipher for being the two wives of Devil Anse's son.  This is a dark corner of American history, brought into the sunlight, warts and all.  Its a break for Kevin Costner's usual roles where he is a heroic figure, to be seen as a man consumed by vengence to the point where all decency is cast aside.  Likewise Bill Paxton, who could avoided all the bloodshed if he had heeded the advice that Powers Booth gave him, to mend their differences or risk destroying both families.  To quote Master Yoda, Fear leads to Anger, Anger leads to Hate, Hate leads to Suffering and that is very true in this American tragedy.",1349136000,,1081,4.564766839378239

It was also disappointing to me that many of the cast members were NOT Americans. There were several innacuracies in the movie, several fire arm(s) related and others related to the types of animals (specifically Horses) that would have been used in that area during the time(s). As a child I heard stories about the Hatfield/Mcoy ""Disagreements"" from my paternal grandparents and great grandparents who were from Kentucky. As it was told to me, the PIG was more instrumental in the situation than was indicated in the movie.  My family had people on both sides of the fight during the civil war and animosities carried on within my family up to the passing of my grandfather in the early 1960's.",1348963200,2,795,4.719424460431655

Be that as it may, I'm convinced this film is about as close as you can get to the real facts and still be able to tell the story in the time allotted to a motion picture.  Cast-wise, it is unbeatable and performance wise, it is as good as it gets, bar none.  The locations and historical portrayals are unbelievable.  All in all, I don't recall any previous attempts at telling this story that can possibly compare.  I was watching Fox News the morning Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton just happened to stop by in their Levis and plain shirts to tell folks about their new picture.  It sure looked unplanned and I believe it was, given the looks on Steve Goocy's, Gretchen Carlson's, and Brian Kilmeade's faces.  Kevin and Bill were just plain folks with their conversational description of what they'd done.  It was great and so is this picture.  Five stars, for sure!",1347926400,,949,4.607142857142857

Kevin Costner, and Bill Paxton, were excellent as well as the whole cast.

5117870,5,B0081FSMMO,"I am unable to comment on the historical accuracy of the story.  People I respect in the history community gave it high ratings for historical accuracy.
They do get the look and feel of the times.  Nothing seems out of place from the dress to the buildings.  The attitudes and dialog reflect the times and what we expect of them.

Kentucky descended into anarchy after the Civil War.  For years, the state had one of the highest murder rates in the nation.  West Virginia was not far behind.
This is the story of the best-known feuds in our history.  The Hatfields of West Virginia fought the McCoys of Kentucky for years.
Life required hard work that produced not much more than needed to survive.  Law was largely absent and when present tended to create as many problems as it settled.
The result is people who do not shrink from violence and are strong enough to carry them point.

While almost five hours long, you will not be bored.  The first part covers the origins of the feud.  Social slights lead to words.
Words lead to fists leading to knives and ending with guns.  The feud did not spring into being and we follow the descent into war one logical step at a time.
Part 2 covers the major fighting.  Each side manages to ""score"" but neither can win.
The third part covers the end of the feud and gives us a history of the major participants after the story ends.

The cast is excellent.  Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton look and act the part as the family heads.
Both proud hard men, that can and will not bend.  Tom Berenger is a joy to watch as a stone cold killer and source of many problems.
All the actors are believable and well cast.

5117871,4,B0081FSMMO,"It seems like every time I see one of these movies, Jim Vance (Tom Berenger) is always the bad guy. Clocking in at just under five hours, one must make time to watch this film which is not as much fun as LOTR or the ""Star Wars"" saga. I enjoy watching histories when they are not too long. Clearly this could have been condensed with some of the opening Civil War scenes edited except for the fact Civil War pictures are popular.

I almost turned it off when 'Devil' Anse Hatfield (Kevin Costner) said ""brain pan."" I also didn't like Bill Paxton's portrayal of Randall McCoy. I thought much of the supporting cast was excellent. This version appears to be one Charles Beard might have written as the origins of the feud is economic. As a history, this was far superior to the version with Christian Slater, but then what isn't better without Christian Slater in it?

When I found that an actual mini-series about it was coming to The History Channel, I could not wait. It was all I expected and more, and loved seeing actors I had not seen in anything in a long time: Bill Paxton, Mare Winningham, and Powers Boothe.  Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton were the perfect choices for Hatfield and McCoy; if you look at pictures of them on The History Channel blog about this, the costume and makeup artists got each to almost looking like the real people; there are pictures of the real people close to their pictures.

To keep an audience interested in something like this, you must put entertainment factors in it; I've heard people fuss about that.  It kept me glued from first night until last; I could not wait to get home from work to watch it. I've read blog posts from the actual relatives, and they are not as disappointed as the non-relatives; the majority of them actually enjoyed it very much.

5117886,4,B0081FSMMO,"Although I am not biologically related to either the Hatfields or the McCoys, I have known people who are.  As a child, I heard stories of the feud from descendents of the McCoys who lived far away from Kentucky.  They were afraid to speak openly about it because they thought maybe some of the Hatfields had moved out where they were living.  But because I was just a kid, they didn't worry too much about what they said in front of me.

I remember their fear, and what I recall them saying was that one of the Hatfields had tried to marry a McCoy girl and that neither family would have it.  But from what I heard, she didn't sound like a nice person, not like the very sympathetic Roseanna McCoy in the movie.  I heard that she and he went swimming and that during that seemingly harmless activity, she did something to him, something that McCoy women were known for.  She hit him in the head and almost killed him.  In his dazed state, she fed him lies, and they became a couple.  In the South when someone is hit in the head very hard or almost drowned to death or choked almost to death, he can from then on be seen as ""changed.""  It's not that he was born with mental retardation, mental illness, or some other mental ailment; he was violently attacked with the sole purpose of rendering him brain damaged.  This is, according to what I heard as a youngster, what happened to one of the Hatfield sons at the hands of one of the McCoy daughters.  Later, the same son married another McCoy girl, but just as in the movie, she was a bad character.  This violent ""changing"" of someone at the hands of a McCoy stands in contrast to how the Hatfields treat people.  In the movie, the boy Cotton, who is developmentally disabled, was not ""changed""; he was born different, and this is pointed out for good reason.  The filmmaker did not want any of his viewers to think that the Hatfields had mistreated the boy, making him different.

Another thing I heard as a child is that the McCoys didn't just shoot people like crazy and hit them in terrible fights, but they also poisoned people.  This was lightly touched upon in the movie when Johnse was captured by Roseanna's brothers, and one of them suggested that they make him drink poison.  However, as I was watching the part when Johnse and Roseanna's baby dies and then when Roseanna dies, it occured to me that perhaps both of them had been poisoned by her family, the McCoys.  The McCoy descendents that I knew were not gentle people; both the men and the women were subject to violent fits of rage.  The women didn't usually raise their voices; they could almost whisper a threat.  Furthermore, they all behaved as one huge criminal family that reminded me of organized crime families associated with the Mafia.  But they were not Italian, nor were they very religious.  Some of them went to church, but it was only for show.

As an adult, I have met many people related to the Hatfields, and many of them are in the U.S. military.  Generally speaking, I have found them to be trustworthy, hard working people who despise trickery of any kind.  They have said that many of the McCoys have gone into law enforcement (the movie reflects this at the very end), where their presence has become detrimental to decent society.  They cautioned that in places like Kentucky and Tennessee, it can be risky to call 911 because the police officer who shows up might be a McCoy.  In the movie, some of the worst criminals wear a badge.

Just as the McCoys have many different last names now, so do the Hatfields.  You can't tell much of anything by the last name, but you can identify a real McCoy by his or her behavior.  Some of this is touched upon in the movie, and I found that fascinating.  The character Uncle Jim, a Hatfield, has a dog he loves, and he fits the dog with a colorful, decorative collar to show that his dog is beloved, not some uncared for stray.  This is significant.  He's a hunter, and dogs are often beloved by their owners who rely on them when they hunt.  The McCoys to this day have the reputation of being dog killers.  Sometimes the dog is brutally killed, and other times the dog is poisoned to death, either in stages or all at once.  So early in the movie when a McCoy insults a Hatfield in a bar by saying that the Hatfield fornicates with a dog, that part rings true based on what I have heard from those related to the Hatfields.  Also, I have known people related to the McCoys who kill the dogs of those they dislike or disapprove of.  The unspoken threat is ""First, I kill your dog, and then I kill you.""  There is even a scene in the movie in which Johnse kicks his uncle's dog because he's angry about the treatment of his wife's family.  It's like he's becoming a McCoy.  It's all very subtle in the movie, but it's there.  Later, the Hatfield patriarch contemplates killing his own son Johnse when they're out fishing.  He doesn't go through with it, but his extreme anger is over his son becoming too much like a McCoy.  Of course, his son has married Nancy McCoy, who is influencing him.

Also, as a child, I heard about the whipping of a McCoy girl by a Hatfield man.  A lot was made of that by the female descendents of the McCoys, and a lot was made of the kind of whip that was used--a ""cat.""  I think that they were afraid that a Hatfield man would come after them and whip them.  I'm still not completely sure about what that all means or why the whipping scene is an important part of the story, but I am glad to see that it made it into the movie.

In the movie, I found the love story between Roseanna and Johnse to be particularly heart-breaking, and even if it's not completely historically accurate, the whole idea of their story fits with the reasons for the feud.  From what I could gather from the people I knew who were related to the McCoys, it was not unheard of for a McCoy to steal a boyfriend or a husband.  She would approach her victim as a ""friend,"" often with accomplices.  Then she or one of her accomplices would whack him in the head with a hard object, and then the McCoy woman would pretend to be right there to help him and offer him a pillow or some sort of comfort.  In his vulnerable state, he would take her up on her offer of help, and she would continue to play him to get him where she wanted.  This is the sort of thing that Nancy McCoy did to Johnse and her cousin Roseanna.  It's the icy coldness of it that is so disturbing.  In the movie, Nancy finally admits that she never loved Johnse and that she took him from Roseanna purely out of revenge.  It was all part of her plot and her hatred for Hatfields.  She didn't care that Johnse and Roseanna loved each other.  Love meant nothing to her.

Another thing that I noted was that even though Mare Winningham did a great acting job as Mrs. McCoy, what I had heard about Mrs. McCoy as a child didn't quite go with how she was characterized in the movie.  In the movie, she's sympathetic.  But I heard that she was not so nice.  Her husband, the McCoy patriarch was nice, but she ""changed"" him and then told everyone that the war was to blame for his declining mental state.  Also, in the movie, when he comes back from prison and she hardly recognizes him, her statement that she almost forgot she was married has a double meaning.  That statement to the McCoy descendents I knew was almost a joke.  It meant that she wasn't faithful.  But in the movie, her statement isn't spoken in that way, almost as if it was lifted from some historical document and stuck in the movie despite a lack of understanding of the implication.  Toward the end of the movie, when she leaves to go stay in a mental hospital, she still seems sympathetic and docile, but the female McCoy descendents I heard talking stated that her husband had her committed to keep her out of prison and away from him and other potential victims.

Whether you're descended from Hatfields or McCoys or not, this movie is a reminder that tricksters, swindlers, murderers, and drunks are all threats.  They seldom act alone. Like almost everybody else, they reproduce and grow in numbers.  There are Hatfields and McCoys among us now and not just in Kentucky and West Virginia either.

I would give this movie only four stars, not five, simply because it did not address some of the accusations against the McCoys, particularly the McCoy women, that I had heard.  It's all hearsay, of course, not anything I've read.  The movie portrayed the McCoy women as victims more than anything else.  But from what I have heard, they were dog killers, husband and boyfriend stealers, head bashers, and poisoners.  The Hatfields, on the other hand, were absolutely not going to stand for any double dealing nor any trickery.  The Hatfields were armed and dangerous, and they forbade their men from associating with McCoy women for good reason.  Both families were violent, but there were big differences between them.  The Hatfields may have been ruthless killers, but they didn't pray to God one minute and then commit murder the next as the McCoys did.",1344729600,2,9084,4.4410876132930515

5117888,2,B0081FSMMO,"When I heard about this series coming to television I thought it could be interesting. When I heard that Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton were starring I definitely wanted to see how they did. My DVR wasn't working at the time so I was glad to hear it was coming to DVD. Unfortunately the series didn't live up to my expectations.

We all know the basics of the story, two warring families in the West Virginia/Kentucky area in the late 1800s. This show goes a little more in depth than any we've heard before starting with the original men who were friends only to become deadly enemies later in life.

Anse Hatfield (Costner) and Randall McCoy (Paxton) are seen fighting for the Confederacy as the show opens. Tired of the killing and battle, certain that they're working for a losing cause, Anse decides to quit and head home. Randall disagrees and stays only to be captured while the rest of their unit is all killed.

Anse returns home to start a lumber business and work the land with his family. Randall comes home after years in a battlefield prison, a beaten man and one who won't forgive Anse for leaving him behind. Added to this is the fact that Anse' Uncle Jim has killed a relative of Randall (without witnesses) and the feud between the two families is started.

Along the way various arguments and battles between the two families continue. With as many members of both as are seen here it makes you wonder if there were any other families living in the same area at the time! Bloodshed sways back and forth, hate festers between not just the two men but their families as well and no happy ending is in sight.

So why was it a disappointment? It was boring! The movie moves along at a snails pace giving us details of each and every incident that happens between the two families. The smallest slight is given screen time and the eventual outcome is evident from the start. Perhaps the makers of this series were hoping to give some depth to the story we've all been told, but do we really need the amount of depth they offer here? I found myself on more than one occasion checking the time display on the DVD player to find out just how much was left to watch and that was just on the first disc!

The acting is all over the place. Tom Berenger as Uncle Jim does a good job of being dislikeable. Costner does a great job at trying to bring harmony to the situation, trying to resolve problems only to be stopped dead in his tracks and forced to change into the mean old SOB he becomes. Paxton, an actor I've always thought highly of, just seems to be a one note ball of anger throughout.

The locations used here look drab and unattractive. Having family in West Virginia (thought I haven't been there in some time) I know that the area looks much better than presented here. Perhaps the idea was to show it in the worst light possible to go along with the way things were in those days.

The biggest problem with this show remains the length and the fact that it is boring, taking far too much time to tell the story. Great mini-series have always taken time to unfold a story but those have always held our attention from start to finish. While this isn't the worst mini-series ever it does offer little entertainment value except for pure history buffs.",1344470400,6,3271,4.449081803005009

5117890,5,B0081FSMMO,"Hatfields & McCoys is the recent miniseries, headlined by Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton as the patriarchs of the two clans, telling the story of the vendetta from the end of the Civil War to its conclusion in 1891. The two start out as young men, and we follow them through to old age in the series, along with their families and the various people who played a part in the events of the vendetta.

Devil Anse Hatfield (Costner) and Randolph McCoy (Paxton) are both soldiers in the Confederate army until Hatfield abandons the field to go home to the borderlands of Kentucky and West Virginia, to his wife Levicy (Sarah Parish). McCoy comes home to his wife Sarah ""Sally"" McCoy (Mare Winningham) at war's end to a world changed, where his brother Harmon has been killed by Jim Vance (Tom Berenger), an uncle to Devil Anse. This is what most consider to be the beginning of the feud, an act of anger over Harmon McCoy having had served as a Union Soldier.

The years go on. While the Hatfields seem to prosper with timbering in the area, Randall McCoy and his relations fall behind, and the unresolved death of one of their own festers in the McCoys. The theft of a pig and subsequent trial of a Hatfield more than a decade later creates more tensions between the families. The relationship of two of the children, Johnse Hatfield (Matt Barr) and Roseanna McCoy (Lindsay Pulsipher) makes things worse. Where Randall tries to use the law to air his grievances, Devil Anse is more likely to take the law into his own hands. On both sides, the tensions deepen, fighting breaks out, lives are broken, and people are killed as revenge becomes absolute. By the end of the feud, two families have been hit hard, the story has made national headlines, and two hardened enemies find themselves at a crossroads.

The miniseries does justice to the story, particularly with respect to what I've later read about the feud. It tries to be historically accurate, much more so than previous film or television versions of the story, which veered wildly off the rail. There are a few glitches- the historical record, for instance, is uncertain as to if Randall McCoy even fought in the Confederate Army, Costner and Paxton are roughly around the same age and in reality, Randall was older than Devil Anse, Roseanna McCoy was a blonde- but these are relatively minor. The filmmakers wanted to keep as close to the original narrative of history where possible, and the production values really pay attention to the finer details, in costuming, music, sets. While the filming itself was done in eastern Europe, the setting in the film ends up feeling very much like a place in the backwoods of America, like the Kentucky and West Virginia borderland must have been like.

The pacing of the story works well. It slowly builds up the tensions, conveying the events as they go along, bringing the feud to a boil, to the point where it finally explodes. We, the audience, can believe the animosity that we've seen growing in these characters. The casting, for the most part, works well. The exception would have to be Matt Barr and Lindsay Pulsipher, neither of whom have much in the way of gravitas for the parts. There are some who look at the story of these two as a Romeo and Juliet sort of story; I didn't sense that. To begin, there were already a number of Hatfields and McCoys marrying. And it felt more like Johnse Hatfield was an irresponsible, womanizing drunkard who threw away what might have been a good thing just by being himself. Barr doesn't bring much weight to the role, and seems more like he's channeling Ryan Gosling (a bad thing, since in my opinion, Gosling sleepwalks his way through every role he takes). Pulsipher as Roseanna is more or less the tragic character, doomed to a bad end, but she just doesn't feel like we should take her seriously.

Okay, that's the bad casting choices out of the way. Now the good, and there are a number of standout performances. Boyd Holbrook plays Cap Hatfield, another of Devil Anse's sons, and he gives the part a vindictive, ruthless streak, much like the original man might well have possessed. Jim Vance is the sort of sadistic, vicious pitbull that history seems to suggest he is, and Berenger perfectly plays those qualities. Powers Boothe, playing ""Wall"" Hatfield, an elder brother, gives the role a certain dignity and strength throughout. He's the voice of reason, reluctant to get involved in the feud, though the feud leads him to a bad end anyway. Andrew Howard plays a man named Bad Frank Phillips, a gun for hire brought in by the McCoys to go after the Hatfields, and though he's older than the actual man himself was, he plays the role with a vicious rattlesnake sort of quality, a thoroughly dangerous man.

There are several women in the cast who stand out. Jena Malone, who's been acting since childhood, plays a McCoy cousin, Nancy, who gets involved with Johnse after the breakdown of the relationship with her cousin. She brings a conniving, manipulative quality to the role, effectively playing both sides against each other, though her loyalties remain to her family. Sarah Parish as Devil Anse's wife Levicy is a voice of reason, drowned out by violence, watching her family tear itself apart for the sake of retribution. And Mare Winningham plays Sarah McCoy, one of the more tragic characters of the story, who loses most of her family, and ends up broken emotionally and physically. She too watches her family implode from within, her husband becoming increasingly bitter, and the performance is haunting.

It's the two leads in the cast that make it come together. They carry the weight of the series, and they do not disappoint. Bill Paxton is one of those actors who just gets better with age. He plays McCoy's gradual decline from a reasonable man into bitter anger, finally into a state where he's shattered by all that has happened to him. Randall McCoy spent the rest of his life in complaint, never really getting over the feud, the anger still festering in him, and Paxton perfectly conveys that. He's a man whose eyes are very expressive, and two emotions that come across that way throughout are pain and the notion of being haunted. He moves from being a man who believes in God and the law to becoming a man who has lost all that matters to him in the end, leaving him unhinged, deeply bitter, and cynical. Not unlike the real McCoy, who by all accounts came apart after the feud.

Costner too is an actor who, given the right role, really can shine. He plays mean and cruel very well, and Devil Anse certainly qualifies. There's a ruthless, calculating streak to the character, a stubborn quality that's not willing to let go of an argument. He also feels plausible as the leader of a large extended family, though the man himself was not the eldest in the clan; Costner carries enough dramatic weight that the audience can believe people around him would follow him. I was reminded of my favourite Costner film Wyatt Earp, where he plays the lawman as the driving force of a family, similarly moved to wage a personal war against people he deems the enemy. In Wyatt and in Devil Anse, there's something of the same mean streak. There's a darkness that particularly comes out at times in this series, to the point where he's willing to take extreme action against a member of his own family he thinks may have betrayed him.

There's a moment, late in the series, when the two come face to face again. It's a confrontation that's not quite what it seems. Costner and Paxton spar with each other in that scene, which really comes across as a crossroads. It also brings into question the issue of mental stability, but it perfectly conveys just how deeply the loathing had cut into both men. It might well be the pivotal moment of the entire series.

The series leaves us with questions. Are there any of these people we should feel sympathetic about? Yes. The women are, for the most part, more sympathetic than the men, which I think transfers as well over to the real story. They watched as their families destroyed themselves, as their men went to war with each other, as stubbornness and hatred dominated their actions. And they paid dearly for it. The series sheds light on this chapter in American history, reminding us of just how badly anger can dominate, can get out of control, and how hard the consequences of that can be. And in the end, it's compelling and entertaining... and dark.",1344384000,6,8475,4.685695097380792

5117898,5,B0081FSMMO,"""Hatfields & McCoys."", a mini-series that aired on the History Channel in 2012, tells the story of the ongoing, nearly epic struggle between two families living in West Virginia and Kentucky in post-Civil War days.  The show was a ratings winner, primarily because it has a script and production values more common in a feature-length, big-screen motion picture. Directed by Kevin Reynolds, it stars Kevin Costner as ""Devil"" Anse Hatfield and Bill Paxton as Randall McCoy, the patriarchs of the warring clans.

The escalating story of the feud is covered nicely, beginning with disputed logging rights and moving on to the theft of a pig, a series of minor slights and taunts by younger members of the clans, legal judgments deemed one-sided (the local judge was himself a Hatfield), and Hatfield's desertion from the Confederate army during the Civil War.

Spread over four and a half hours, the series explores the feud and its ramifications in detail and satisfyingly characterizes the many individuals who played a significant role.  Director Reynolds does a first-rate job of bringing the era to life and showing how a romantic involvement between members of the two clans gave the feud a Romeo-and-Juliet air.

Costner and Paxton are both strong as the leaders and show how the ongoing hostility takes a toll on their health and marriages.  After twenty years of hatred, distrust, and revenge, both men have become weary and long to end the feud with honor intact.

Standouts in the supporting cast are Powers Booth as Judge Valentine Hatfield, Boyd Holbrook as William ""Cap"" Hatfield, Mare Winningham as Sally McCoy, and Tom Berenger as Jim Vance, Devil Anse's uncle.

""Hatfields & McCoys"" shows that, with the right project, audiences will flock to a mini-series, a genre once extremely popular on network TV and now pretty much the province of cable stations. Bonus extras on the two-disc Blu-ray edition include ""The Making of Hatfields & McCoys"" and the music video ""I Know These Hills,"" featuring Kevin Costner.",1343520000,11,2023,5.072289156626506

5117901,5,B0081FSMMO,"Interesting somewhere between reruns of Ice Road Truckers, Ax Men, American Pickers, Pawn Stars, Mountain Men and Swamp People someone running the History Channel thought it would be an interesting idea if the network named after the study of the past actually had a program that dealt with an event of the past that wasn't Second World War.

This brings us to the Hatfields and Mccoys.  Simply put even though the love triangle dragged down certain portions of the action the series is strongest when it focuses on the true reasons for the feud which were economic in nature.  Costner can certainly be melodramatic and self-congratulatory but he has managed to capture an element of the Southern character without ever really meaning to.  In the old days when one was poor and hardly had enough to feed ones family we still had honor.  Now we look on that rather outmoded concept and say yeah h-o-n-o-r what is the market price on that exactly?  Either way the miniseries demonstrates how that one curse or virtue forced events along a path of increasing violence until the reasons for the feud who started it and who is ultimately in the right are irrelevant.  In the end which family was the most wronged is left open to the interpretation of the viewer both families used the law courts in the states of Kentucky and West Virginia toward their own ends, both fought through honest and crooked means to control their own economic destinies and both families had men of honor and men of blood.

Now most of the cast did a really good job Tom Berenger plays one of those men of blood Jack Vance shown to not like McCoys all that much but can be almost called kind where Hatfields are concerned.  He would be the worst person in the series if not for the inclusion of 'Bad' Frank Phillips who might win the award for maddest maddog in the history of the universe.  Not to be overlooked are the ""tools"" used by both factions the judge a Hatfield and Perry Cline who is in the running with Bad Frank.  I will say that because the main events of the story are so expansive some characters have a tendency to fade into the background like any of the McCoy children even though Randell and Nancy McCoy are played very well.  Contrast the treatment of the McCoy family with three of the Hatfield characters Cotton Top, Cap and Jonsey who all had parts to play in the overall.  Costner is the reason this thing got made but as much as I can respect him for that he just plays the same character he played in Open Range and Dances with Wolves I think I even saw a little bit of Field of Dreams in there.
Overall-Some flaws but with most of the cast giving a really great effort a few hiccups can be forgiven.  Considering the show was such a success in the ratings hopefully we will see more efforts like this in the future which I heartily look forward to.",1341187200,4,2849,4.4854932301740815

5117903,1,B0081FSMMO,"Preamble: Had this production appeared on HBO or ABC I would have considered it an entertainment, and given it 4 or 4.5 stars. But it was produced on the History channel, and claimed extraordinary adherence to historical accuracy. So, by the criteria of the production itself, this item is being reviewed as a dramatic historical documentary rather than an entertainment.
It is a ludicrous fictional account of the feud that follows none of the scholarly research (Waller, Rice, Pearce, Alther, T. McCoy, C. Hatfield). But it looks real good, so it will be believed, and will define the feud for all time to come. ps, I grew up in Pikeville, and know the history intimately.
Examples: The battle of Grapevine Creek was the result of a Phillips incursion into West Virginia, not a rescue attempt by the Hatfields. No rescue was ever attempted. Anse and Ranel NEVER confronted each other with firearms.
Asa Harmon was noted for his sobriety, and Ranel did NOT become a drunk after his cabin was attacked.
Nancy McCoy had 2 children by Johnse and did not leave him until he tried to kill her. Twice.

Ranel McCoy was in no muster list for any military unit during the Civil War, and did not serve with Anse. Local tradition has it that he formed a Home Guard (militia/vigilance) unit in 1863, was immediately captured by Union troops, and spent the war in an Ohio prison camp. But even this cannot be proven.

As noted by a correspondent,his grave marker and other documentation, they even get McCoy's name wrong. He was born Randolph. He was called Ranel or Ran'l. He was never called Randall.

I could go on for pages, but will summarize this way. This has all the historical accuracy of a Kevin Kostner movie. Oh, wait.",1340496000,55,1719,4.704318936877076

With a total running time of 6 hours, it will trim down to about 4  without commercials and the traditional opening recap.  Even with that option, the length is the biggest drawback to the movie.  As you could expect, the film repeats the theme over and over.

Drawn from a real feud dating to the Civil War, the Hatfields headed by `Devil' Anse (Kevin Costner) and the McCoys, headed by Randall (Bill Paxton) were friendly neighbors at one time.  A series of minor snubs and taunts by younger members of the clans erupts when one of the Hatfields (includes various cousins with different surnames) is accused of stealing a pig belonging to Randall.  One thing leads to another and a 2 generation war begins between the two families who live on opposite sides of the Kentucky-West Virginia border.

The conflict also involves Romeo and Juliet romantic entanglements between the two families, highlighted by the son of Anse (Matt Barr) impregnating the daughter of Randall (Lindsay Pulsipher).  The performances are strong with Kevin Costner in the lead as Anse, an unrecognizable Tom Berenger as his uncle Jim Vance, Powers Booth as older brother and judge ""Wall,""Andrew Howard as bounty hunter `Bad' Frank Phillips, Mare Winningham as Randall's wife and Jena Malone as troublemaking Nancy McCoy, niece of Randall.

5117909,5,B0081FSMMO,"Like most interested people I've heard accounts--legends, really--of the Hatfield-McCoy conflict many times over the years.  Yes, all the elements are here in this film--the Civil War, timber deal gone wrong, the pig, the Hatfield-McCoy romance and, of course, the feud and killings.  Probably the main difference between the legendary account that I heard and this film has to do with the initial events during the Civil War.  I'd heard that Devil Hatfield was a Confederate soldier who returned from war boasting that he'd killed one of the Yankee McCoys on the field of battle--and that this boasting was the initial spark that set off the feud.

The film, of course, shows Anse Hatfield and Randall McCoy in the same Confederate Army company with the first hint of trouble was Hatfield's desertion.  Apparently, however, the depiction of the murder of the returned Yankee soldier--and Randall McCoy uncle--by Confederate Home Guards is correct although other sources say that this event didn't lead to Hatfield-McCoy trouble simply because many Confederate-sympathizing McCoys reckoned that the Yankee Uncle was a turncoat that deserved to be executed.

I applaud the film in that it that it so closely approaches the actual Appalacian people and attitudes of the time.  The accents, clothing, weapons, and even the look of the women just feel right.  The woman who plays Randal McCoy's wife does an especially wonderful job.  Costner, who I never respected as an actor, does a masterful job in his depiction of the grim and relentless 'Devil' Anse hatfield.  Sometimes it is a little difficult to keep the characters separated precisely because the various antagonists were such similar people.  I also question whether the Hatfield boys spent quite so much time hanging around in the local house of ill repute although both families engaged in whiskey-making and drinking.  I also suspect that the number of actual killings was--as bad as it was during the actual feud--amplified for dramatic effect.  In the long run, Hollywood always interferes with history.

At the same time, I think the film does an especially good job of depicting a very basic aspect of the tale.  The Hatfields and McCoys, like most of the folks living in the central and southern Appalacian mountains, shared the same Scots-Irish ancestry.  The Hatfield and McCoy feud had all of the aspects of an ancient highland Scottish clan feud.  Despite Hollywood depictions of Highland fighters going into battle in plaid kilts with skirling bagpipes, these Highland feuds were between poor people in straightened circumstances.  Just like their successors, the Hatfields and McCoys, bootleg whiskey and drunkeness was part of Scottish culture.  The Hatfield and McCoy conflict was a Scottish blood feud brought to American shores.",1339459200,5,2804,5.21875
5117910,4,B0081FSMMO,"I have never been a fan of westerns, civil war stories, or really anything to do with the south to be honest, but this series was surprisingly entertaining!  Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton bring their A-game acting skills to this series and made it watchable to any fan of drama television.  My schooling experience failed to inform me about the Hatfield and McCoy feud, so I learned a lot (yes, I know they over embellish and make up some things for TV) and I had a great time watching what would happen next.  There was a few times where I was on the edge of my seat, wide-eyed, staring at the screen.  Overall, if you like great TV dramas, I would highly recommend this because it will not disappoint.

Also as a side note, I kept on thinking how there was so much action, but they still managed to squeeze in some great writing, I kept thinking that this is how the Walking Dead should be; predominantly action packed, with great writing and not so much pretentious, overly dramatic, acting.",1339113600,2,994,4.5
5117911,3,B0081FSMMO,"While I don't see the logic in writing a review for a bluray disc listing of a movie that isn't officially out in stores yet - this review is more so about the content.

The previews for this movie were what got me excited about the series. It looked to be a great, well told story with fantastic acting and music. But... like most previews - the energy from the preview wasn't found in the actual series. To be fair, I watched all 3 parts and tried not to prejudge when the first part of the series left me a little disappointed.

The acting is fair - certain parts that were supposed to be moving just couldn't actually move me as a viewer.

I was expecting better music in the series - the song played during the previews was pretty great.. but the ones played in the actual show were mostly just of a woman vocalizing a simple melody. Nothing that would make me want to run out and buy the the soundtrack to listen to over and over.

The location, while pretty, isn't in the US - it's Romania. To me that seemed a little silly, especially since the History channel was proclaiming this series... you'd think somewhere in the southeastern US they'd be able to find some areas to film. I understand costs and also the untamed wilderness of Romania might have seemed more viable as a locale, but being a gal living in the south.. the trees and overall landscaping just didn't look right.

I think it's an adequate film - just not something I feel I would want to watch repeatedly. It's one of those movies where one viewing is enough. I give them credit for their attempt at a story that a lot of people already have preconceptions about because their expectations of how its portrayed can be almost impossibly high to surpass. Perhaps my expectations were too high?

Overall - Give it a chance, you might like it - or you might be like me and not outright hate it.. but generally not care to watch it again.",1339113600,8,1909,4.378531073446328

Growing up in NJ I only heard of Hatfields and McCoys and never really knew what the fuss was all about.  But after seeing this, I can only wonder why this wasn't in the history books and taught in school. Great historical piece and brought me to tears at times. You will not be disappointed. Thank you history channel. And thank you to some great acting that left me in my chair for a short 6 hours. (Left me wanting more)It's been a long time since I was so mesmerized by a movie.

5117913,5,B0081FSMMO,"This production of the Hatfields and McCoys is excellent. It is based on the real feud between the two families. It has an ALL-STAR cast. Everyone truly did an excellent job. It was very thorough and explanatory. I caught myself sympathizing for both families in the beginning, but towards the end...well just watch and come to your own conclusion.

I started the series on the third night (I had previously DVR'd the other two), and I had to finish them all. They were that good. It kept you interested the ENTIRE movie, wanting more, and hoping...(If you weren't familiar with the ending) that your favorite characters would survive.

Take into consideration, the way we live today is very different from how things were back then. The Civil War had just ended, times were tough. You grew your own food, raised your own crops, etc. You couldn't go down to the local fast-food joint. Little things like 'stealing land' or 'pigs' was enough to 'light the fuse' that would eventually turn into an all-out feud. That was your livelihood.

Every actor/actress involved in this miniseries did an excellent job; however, hats off to Tom Berenger! I kept seeing his name at the beginning of the movie and kept wondering whom his character was. After completing the series, I finally 'googled' it and was surprised to learn he was Jim Vance. He did such an outstanding job with portraying Jim's character and accent,(The costume/makeup helped, of course), that I couldn't even tell it was Berenger. After knowing this and re-watching, I noticed little things that gave him away. But, superb job to ALL. Johnse's character (Matt Barr), Devil Anse (Kevin Costner), Mccoy (Bill Paxton), were ALL believable, as well as the rest of the cast. Everyone was important and ALL were believable.

This was a beautiful portrayal of the Hatfields, McCoys, the time period, etc. It flowed really well. It was easily understandable. I could find no flaws. The costumes were authentic, even the language/slang/incorrect grammar was authentic time period. A truly wonderful movie/portrayal of the real feud, and I highly recommend it to those who are interested in knowing more about it, or to those who simply like historical movies. A very good, high-quality, well-made movie!",1339027200,3,2255,5.005333333333334

I am not really a fan of blood shed in movies, and there was a lot in this one but that is what really happened all those years ago. I have not researched the families but from what I've heard it is all pretty true.

We were busy and out of town but thankfully I DVR'd all three parts. Last night about 11pm I was winding down, getting ready for bed, and decided to watch about an hour of this story before falling asleep. Fast forward 3 1/2 hours later. It's 2:30 am and now I'm wide awake - obviously hooked. Part I was definitely the best and pulls you quickly into each family's dynamic. Clearly, there's no ""good guy"" in this tale, but the writers tend to portray one family in a better light than the other. There is brutality and some parts are quite disturbing, but I think History Channel did a good job in it's accuracy depicting the behaviors of people and events of that time. If you're looking for a happily ever after...read or watch fiction/fantasy. If you desire to know more about how folks, specifically the famous Hatfield & McCoys, lived, loved, worked, and died during this time period, it's an accurate historical piece.",1338681600,2,1046,4.65945945945946

I didn't even know that they were starring in the leading roles, so that was a pleasant surprise. Moreover, the lesser known actors did quite well, also, in my opinion. I highly recommend this movie - not only for its great actors, but for the most part the storyline seemed to be true to form as to how things went down in history (from what I've read) - especially as it pertained to the 'pig' issue and the sad and misfortune of Roseanna. If you love history and true stories, you would love this movie.

Becoming close friends during the Civil War, Anse Hatfield (Costner) and Randall McCoy (Paxton) have a little falling out when Anse takes off one night and abandons the fighting. Little by little the families lives cross paths and tension continue to mount. When one of McCoys's sons is attacked by a member of the Hatfield family a war is begun. I have stated before that the last really good western to me was ""Open Range"" since then the genre has had a rough 10 years. Leave it to Costner to bring it back. Even though this is a made-for-TV series don't let that scare you off. The movie is a must see for western fans and history buffs. I really don't know anything about the actual history of the feud but this movie made me want to learn more. Costner is perfect in this role as the leader of the Hatfield clan. Paxton is good, but a strange choice in the role of the McCoy's head. I could really go on and on about this movie but I will just say that this could be the movie that returns the western genre to the way it should be. For a movie on the History channel this is not in anyway tame or holds back at all. Violent and brutal with great characters. I highly recommend this.

5117925,5,B0081FSMMO,"It is said that the feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys made it so that one name cannot be said without the other. Starting at the end of the Civil War, and bringing the states of Kentucky and West Virginia close to a war of its own, the events of that bloody conflict have left their mark on American history. Now, the History Channel ventures into scripted drama for the first time with the miniseries ""Hatfields & McCoys,"" an intense, character-driven film that looks at the price of feuding.

What really drives this four-hour plus film are the outstanding performances by the cast, which works from a powerfully-penned script. Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton do brilliant work. You do not really ""like"" either character in the traditional sense of the word, but you definitely find them fascinating, and cannot help but enjoy the powerful work these two do. The supporting cast is fantastic as well, really finding the human drive behind these real-life characters.

The filmmakers have also done a brilliant job of bringing 19th Century Appalachia to life, through the beautiful cinematography, set design, and even the music of the period. John Debney and Tony Morales' score is haunting and wonderful to listen to when set to the imagery. Even though the film was shot in Romania, you cannot help but feel as if you are in the Tug River Valley of West Virginia/Kentucky in the mid to late-1800s.

Overall, ""Hatfields & McCoys"" is a brilliant, powerful and dramatic look at this dark time in the Appalachians, when a quarrel between two families escalated into a blood feud, with innocent lives taken down along with the guilty. If you love historical drama, westerns, or great film, then you are sure to enjoy this series!

Kevin Costner stars as ""Devil Anse"" Hatfield as well as serving as one of the producers and he gives one of his best performances here.  To borrow a phrase from some of his many baseball movies, he hits this one ouy of the park. For the most part, they try to make everything as authentic as possible and this is a story filled with action and emotions.

5117933,4,B0081FSMMO,"The History Channel miniseries ""Hatfields and McCoys"", directed by Kevin Reynolds and written by Ted Mann and Bill Kerby enjoyed brisk ratings this week. Thus far, this rendering of the epic struggle between two families living in West Virginia and Kentucky is the best one to date. That is not to say that it did not have many flaws. In general, I admired Ted Mann's work on the HBO series ""Deadwood"", where he created great dialogue for both fictional and real denizens of the South Dakota boom town. The characters in this miniseries also generally speak with a high level of intelligence with only a few hillbilly archetypes thrown in. The acting for this program is outstanding with a few exceptions. Most notably, Jena Malone gets my vote for the worst overacting in the part of Nancy McCoy. However, Powers Boothe, Kevin Costner, Mare Winningham and Bill Paxton all turn in solid performances. For his portrayal of ""Uncle Jim"" Vance, Tom Berenger is the standout in this cast. As with most Hollywood versions of significant historical events, the writers and filmmakers feel a need to change the truth to suit their plot development. This includes the requisite romantic elements and composite characters. With that latitude in mind, I still found the historical inaccuracies of this television movie to be staggering. Having performed extensive research on the real feud, I would like to point out a number of these for the perspective DVD buyer:

1) The show made a big point about Devil Anse taking unofficial leave from his Rebel Company D during the Civil War. Randolph McCoy also went on unofficial leave soon afterward. So there was no moral high ground there; nor do I know of any historical record stating this caused any ill will between the two men.
2) The show depicted major religious differences between Randolph and Devil Anse. I have never read anything stating religion played a strong part in the feud. However, economic jealousy did.
3) The hog trial was conducted in Deacon Anse's cabin in Raccoon Hollow; and not a regular court house in Mate County convened by Wall Hatfield.
4) Perry Cline was not counsel for the plaintiff during the hog trial.
5) Asa Harmon McCoy was not shot while hiding at a still. Ironically, this Union man owned a slave named Pete. Unfortunately, for Asa, Pete was followed to a cave by Logan County Regulars.
6) Bill Staton was not ambushed by Paris and Sam McCoy. In fact, it was the opposite, as Staton layed in wait for the McCoys. Sam was never convicted and was acquitted for murder on the grounds of self defense.
7) Randolph McCoy did not send his sons to retrieve Roseanna McCoy from the Hatfield cabin. He sent his three daughters. Therefore, Johnse Hatfield was never shot by the McCoy brothers.
8) Frank Phillips did not kill Tom Wallace. Larkin and Jacob McCoy probably did.
9) Wall Hatfield did not surrender himself to Pikeville authorities and was captured by Frank Phillips. Additionally, he was not the sympathetic character portrayed by Powers Boothe. He was an overpowering manipulator who had a strong lead role in the murders of Tolbert, Pharmer and Randolph McCoy Junior.
10) Devil Anse and Wall Hatfield did not call for Sarah McCoy to come visit her sons before they were executed. She demanded to see her boys. Wall and Devil Anse blocked her entrance to the schoolhouse where her captive sons were being held. For nearly an hour, in the pouring rain, Sarah pressed the Hatfield brothers before they relented to a visit.
11) Perry Cline had a wife; and I have never read that he showed romantic interest in Roseanna McCoy.
12) Cap Hatfield wrote the famous letter to the newspapers asking for an abatement of hostilities, not Devil Anse. Though it looked very touching to show Devil Anse reading the letter to the clan.

My other criticism of this show, is though it has been described by critics as ""atmospheric"", I found it to be humorless and relentlessly grim. I know the producers had six hours to tell the story, but I believed there were many missed opportunities to show less violence and greater depth of character. Instead, most of the primary players were dislikable. The real Devil Anse was a remarkable man of extraordinary humor. There was great wrong done on both sides during this clan warfare; but these actions were carried out by complex people of both good and bad temperament. Finally, the fact that little was depicted about the tremendous court battles between Kentucky and West Virginia was I believe, another opportunity that was missed.",1338422400,444,4543,4.853092783505154
5117934,5,B0081FSMMO,"I have to laugh at the one negative review. Great acting, production, directing etc. but the story is ""not uplifting"". Well, go watch a show about rainbows and unicorns if that's your taste. This is drama and true to life. Life is dirty and gritty. Personally I think this is the best thing I've seen in a long time. The acting is superb. From what I've read the story has been ""Hollywoodized"" a bit. Some things have been changed. The romance between Johnse Hatfield and Roseanna McCoy is overblown. The families were already intermarried several times. Some of the McCoys took the Hatfield side and vice versa. The main story is true though. ""Devil Anse"" Hatfield and Randolph McCoy were friends who had a falling out and they reached such a level of hate and jealousy that many other people were drawn into their personal feud resulting in 30+ years of murder and mayhem. Rather than high ideals the main reasons for the feud were probably economic. Fights over timber rights. The stolen hog, etc. Perry Cline was a major player, too. He was in there stirring things up for his own good, although he was already married and had no love interest in Roseanna McCoy. Despite the liberties taken I believe it is basically pretty true.

Every scene meant to bring out an emotion in you actually does - sometimes very strongly. Kevin Costner is spectacular; but every actor - even in the smallest parts - has been cast amazingly well & does a wonderful job. No detail has been overlooked; it feels as if you have been taken back in time. It also doesn't back down on scenes that are hard to watch; this just addresses the brutal reality of it.

5117943,5,B0081FSMMO,"I had my doubts, when I first saw the advertisements on History Channel., Then I saw the Cast list and knew it would be far better than I originally thought.

With Kevin Costner as William Anderson ""Devil Anse"" Hatfield and also a Co-producer, Bill Paxton as  Randall McCoy, Tom Berenger as Jim Vance, Mare Winningham, Powers Booth and a host of others round out the cast.

The story line is as true to history as can be dug from archival records. At the end of the series they list the outcomes of the surviving members of both families. One of the very best mini-series I have seen in decades and I expect it to be touted as one of the best ever.

May not be as much action as Die Hard or the Terminator series of movies , but then again real history rarely is.
I highly recommend you see it !",1338336000,3,795,4.2105263157894735
5117944,5,B0081FSMMO,"This Mini-Series is still currently running, One episode to go. It has Three really stand out actors to me who do an outstanding job portraying the characters.

Kevin Costner plays ""Anse"" Hatfield and Paxton plays ""Ol' Ran'l"" McCoy. This follows pretty strong to the history of the feud while it's still argued what exactly caused the feud to boil to the point that it did, it was another civil war between Kentucky and W.Virginia.

My Soon to be Ex-Wife is a McCoy and boy let me tell you, they really do have some bad attitudes. It's really cool to kind of know some of the family. Proud as can be of that heritage.

I am sure the blu-ray will be great quality as well since the HD showing on History is spectacular.

If you love History grab this and you will not regret it.

Edit: Just finished the series, It was amazing. This has it all, parts that make you cry, parts that make you wanna throw something at the T.V., parts that have you on the edge of your seat. This series is great for anybody fans of history or not.

Edit: As someone mentioned to me, I left out some of the other Actors and Actresses that are deff worth mentioning, Tom Berenger play Jim Vance and at first it took me by surprise when I finally realized it was him, he player the role amazingly.

Mare Winningham played Sally McCoy and hit it spot on, it was almost to good, it was hard to watch this character at times.

Lindsay Pulsipher also stood out as Roseanna, the plot between her and Johnse was almost to heart breaking to watch and she played the heartbroken woman perfectly both mentally and physically.

Honestly there are no Actors in this film that did a bad job, Everything came together perfectly.",1338336000,132,1691,4.429032258064516

When it arrived last week I immediately put it in to watch and it's stayed there in my player off and on ever since. Very well done, and well acted. I found myself thoroughly caught up in the story. It is well worth the time to watch. I've actually done some reading about the real events, suffice it to say that this is a very dark and tragic story.",1525046400,,492,4.082474226804123
