7425470,5,B0151ZI8A2,Finally found a pregnancy workout that helps me match my pre-pregnancy intensity level but is perfectly geared toward pregnancy. Just wish I'd had this with my 1st two pregnancies!,1449446400,,180,5.241379310344827
7425471,5,B0151ZI8A2,"I am really enjoying my DVD! I really think it's helping me stay in shape as I get further along in my pregnancy. I really like how the workouts are under 20 minutes each, allowing me to mix and match. As a mom of three young kids, my workouts usually have to be spaced through the day in order for me to have time to get them done, so having a format where I can do them as I am able is very helpful.",1449446400,,401,3.7857142857142856
7425472,4,B0151ZI8A2,"I am currently 25 weeks pregnant and was really looking forward to this DVD and per-ordered it ASAP. I got this in the mail the other day and did the whole DVD; it was enjoyable. The lower body workout is mostly plie variations. The only thing that I wish was different would be the warm ups and the cool downs; it would have been nice to have a warm up and cool down section separately instead of including it within each workout, because they could have been a bit better and the actual focused workouts could then also be longer. But still an overall good workout! :)",1445731200,,570,4.336448598130841
8732330,4,B0151ZI8A2,Great pregnancy workout. Love the shorter length so you can mix and match or just do one on days when you aren't feeling as hot. I miss the yoga from the other pregnancy workout though but other than that this workout is awesome and will definitely make you sore if you use appropriate weights!,1487721600,,294,4.462962962962963

8732332,4,B0151ZI8A2,"I am really enjoying this DVD, it's more challenging than the other prenatal workout DVDs I have from Lindsay. I like that it's divided up more and you can just do a little bit if you don't have time or aren't feeling up to a full 45 min workout. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that there are a lot of moves on it that you can't do with abdominal separation (which she fully describes and warns about). I wish that there were more modifications instead of saying ""don't do this exercise"". My separation isn't bad, so I still do some of them with what I think is an okay modification, otherwise I feel like I would miss out on 1/3 of the exercises, even aside from omitting core-specific exercises.",1482278400,,712,4.32089552238806
8732333,5,B0151ZI8A2,"I love all of Lindsay's workout programs. I've been doing them for a couple years now! She seems to really know what she's talking about, and actually cares about the people who buy her programs! This one is great for a pregnant woman who wants to stay active, but doesn't have a ton of time to devote to working out every day. There are calendars available to make it even easier to stay on track, for both beginners and advanced women. Thanks Lindsay Brin for all you do!",1479081600,,473,4.386363636363637
8732334,4,B0151ZI8A2,"This has been a great DVD during my second trimester. Workouts are broken down in +\- 15 minute segments and can be mixed and matched together or complimented with your own cardio. I also signed up for the online exercise guide and healthy pregnancy guide. There is some helpful info on weight gain and an easy to follow wall chart to formulate an exercise plan. Overall I found for the price this program was a great value. I've also tried the ""What to Expext"" videos which I found too easy for someone who was already working out - at least in my second trimester, and ""Gillian Michaels Ripped in 30"" which got too difficult and needed too many modifications after week 14 when I needed to modify all of the ab work. I would definitely recommend this DVD to keep toned during pregnancy for someone already at a moderate fitness level. There are plenty of guilt free modifications for beginners as well.",1477267200,,904,4.58641975308642
8732335,4,B0151ZI8A2,"Seriously challenging pregnancy video! I think if you were doing one of Lindsay's Boot camp or Pretty Fierce videos before you got pregnant then this would be great for you. I however was pretty content post pregnancy to stick with her Postnatal Slim Down video for over a year. I'm not one of those ladies that's looking to get and keep a six pack so the Postnatal Slim Down was fine for me. I just like to be slim and toned and it achieved that just great. That being said, this pregnancy workout was too hard for me. I kept having to pause and walk around to get my heart beat back down for the cardio. For the weightlifting section I had to use lighter weights than usual so that I could keep up. Overall I'd say that super fit pregnant mamas this DVD is for you, but for me I like Lindsay's other pregnancy video, Complete Pregnancy Fitness program better.",1465344000,3,861,4.354037267080745
8732336,5,B0151ZI8A2,"I bought this DVD as a gift, so I have not done these particular work outs on Slim and Fit. However, I have 3 other dvd's by Lindsay and all are GREAT work outs. I have exercised for a long time and have learned a lot since doing her excercise videos especially on technique and core. I also realized that I can still get a work out in my day if I only have 20min to spare -- which happens a lot! I trust her and love her work outs as they have really helped me stay active and be the strongest I have ever been.",1458000000,,512,3.839622641509434
8732337,4,B0151ZI8A2,"I'm currently in my second trimester with my second child. I like that each segment of this workout is less than 20 minutes. If you have more time you can do two segments back-to-back; if limited on time or not feeling great, it's easy to still talk yourself into one segment.

In my first pregnancy I used Lindsay's prenatal workouts which are segmented by trimester. I like that this workout works for the whole pregnancy (with modifications suggested if needed) and I also like that there is less chit-chat from Lindsay on this series.

I agree with other reviewers that a separate yoga/flexibility option will still be needed in addition to her core/flexibility segment.",1457308800,,674,4.9035087719298245
8732338,4,B0151ZI8A2,"If you've ever done any of Lindsay's other DVDs, a lot of these moves will feel really familiar.  TONS of squats, plies, and lunges! She does a good job of offering modifications and demonstrating proper form.  I have a couple beefs: 1) I wish the core and flexibility segment was divided into two separate segments.  I don't feel like enough time is devoted to each.  Also, the core section is cut short by Lindsay taking the last few minutes to sit and talk about diastasis recti.  That probably should have been included in the ""Before You Begin"" section. 2) I really wish this wasn't called SLIM & Fit.  The emphasis during pregnancy should really be on health, not on staying or getting slim. I know that's kind of nitpicky, but it bugs me. Otherwise, this is a good DVD.",1453420800,5,776,4.546762589928058
8732339,5,B0151ZI8A2,"I really enjoy working out to this DVD. It is hard to find a pregnancy exercise program that is safe and challenging at the same time, but this DVD is. It has just enough intensity to keep you sweating, and Lindsey knows about fitness to keep you safe during pregnancy. But, I would recommend for the warm ups to be a seperate section and each work out segment a little longer. Otherwise, it is great! Buy this DVD you will not regret it!",1451174400,2,438,4.289156626506024
