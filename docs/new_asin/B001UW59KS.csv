3815017,1,B001UW59KS,"This PBS production is such a one sided view of what happened.  Not one interview with a Republican,  whereas Democrats Barney Frank and Chris Dodd, two of the people most responsible for the meltdown are depicted as heroes.  I find it amazing that two of the people (Bernacke and Guitner),  who this film says failed to fathom the depth of the meltdown, are now part of Obama's financial team. Hmmmmmm",1278201600,11,402,4.7
3815018,5,B001UW59KS,"I always liked the PBS Frontline series as they tend to be less biased than most documentaries, especially when it comes to politics. I remember seeing the announcement on TV by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson stating that if congress didn't immediately pass the bailout bill, the entire economy would crash by Monday.

This video gets into the gory details of the response to the meltdown and why certain things were done and others were not. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, the catalysts that set off the worst economic downturn since the great depression.

If you want a more extensive view of the meltdown, I would recommend watching this in conjunction with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FRONTLINE-Ten-Trillion-and-Counting/dp/B001UW59K8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FRONTLINE: Ten Trillion and Counting</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/i-o-u-s-a/dp/B001P9G3HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">i.o.u.s.a.</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frontline-The-Warning/dp/B002Q5O6ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frontline: The Warning</a>.

3815019,5,B001UW59KS,I found this DVD on the financial crisis quite interesting and informative.  I have been following the crisis the past two years after Bear Stearns had it's financial problems.  I agree with the other commentators that this video should be shown in High Schools and Colleges to educate the students on what really occured.  This is top rate reporting and I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who desires to know what really took place in 2008 to cause the problems we have today.,1253491200,,481,4.7023809523809526
3815020,5,B001UW59KS,"An eye-opening synopsis of our current economic meltdown. How easily we forget the chain of federal deregulation, lack of transparency, fraudulent financial reporting (and old fashioned greed) that actually lead to the failure of Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros, Fannie, Freddie and virtually the entire American financial sector.

Perhaps we really shouldn't offer interest-only fantasy mortgages on grossly overpriced homes to people who can't possibly afford them... and then internationally peddle the toxic debt as AAA securities. It seems our cheating culture has created an America in which we know the price of everything -- and the value of nothing. Not just shame on them, but shame on us all!

It took Bush/Cheney eight years to turn Clinton's thriving economy with a $5 trillion budget surplus into our current epic depression with a $10 trillion budget deficit. As most folks have come to realize, the Bush White House was the most incompetent and misguided administration in America's history and virtually crippled this nation. Given the complexities presented in this video, it just might take Obama more than a few months to lead this country out of our current economic, political and social disaster. I doubt he brought a magic wand to the office.",1250294400,6,1260,5.232673267326732

3815023,2,B001UW59KS,"Maybe it's because I'm a ""root cause"" person who asks why something happened to begin with, but watching this program was like watching a janitor cleaning up a mess in the cafeteria and blaming the janitor for the mess.  By 2007, the damage had already been done with subprime mortgages being created for the last 10 years.  Blame whoever you want, but rest assured that it was this feeding frenzy of low no documentation, interest only ""creative"" loans that broke the mold along with the credit default swaps that created this mess.  It was also the reason for the housing bubble, now that the people who became eligible for a mortgage increased.  It would have been more interesting to know more about the relationship between Freddie Mac and Barney Franks during the past 10 years.  This problem is not over yet and when I hear the government and media saying the people are ""entitled"" to fair and affordable mortgages, it concerns me.",1242777600,30,938,4.765432098765432
3815024,3,B001UW59KS,"It's been years since I took an American history class in high school.  One day I wanted to (re)learn why the stock market crashed at the moment it did back in the 1920s.  Doing a quick engine search did not give me the answer.  I am glad this program exist because it gives specific times, names, and sequences to explain the latest economic collapse.

It clearly spells out, first slid Bear Stearns, then Freddie Mac, then Lehman Brothers, then AIG, and then global markets.  You really get an idea of the key players in this matter: Paulson, Bernanke, et al.

The interviewees are diverse in terms of gender, but not in terms of race.  There's a lot of gray hair and bald heads here, so you get the sense that oligarchs are calling the shots.  The lack of diversity, to me, signaled why Barack Obama's ascension is so revolutionary.

I'm not a business person and I liked that this work did not alienate me.  However, I do think they could have summed up things much quicker than one hour.  The poli. sci-aholic was disturbed here.  When all these events were in the news, my first question was, ""And how will this affect the 2008 election?""  You see Bush quoted once here and later one hears of Obama.  However, the Obama-McCain rivalry does not come up at all.  There are federal officials interviewed here, but this work divorced much politics from its economic discussion.  The work shows how Paulson, Mr. Deregulation, had to eat crow, but it never mentions that he needed to put a drumstick of that cooked crow on McCain's plate.

The work uses sinister music and black-and-white photography to point to the sadness of the whole situation.  The creators used many devices to keep the tone somber throughout the hour.",1238284800,3,1725,4.655629139072848

3815182,5,B001UW59KS,"September 18, 2008 the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke arrived in the capital for an emergency meeting. They had already bailed out one bank, allowed another one to fail, and nationalized three of the nation's largest companies. Senior legislators were told that unless they were given 700 million dollars immediately there would be no economy the following Monday. That was Thursday. This is the start of Frontline's: Inside the Meltdown.

Frontline covers the gathering economic recession that became evident in the spring of 2008 and the actions and reactions of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. It was the fall of dominos starting with Bear Stearns which had billions of dollars in what came to be known as toxic assets of mortgage securities and credit default swaps. Paulson, a long-time believer in free market economics found himself challenged to let the market chips fall where they may, or stave of economic panic with federal subsidies. He goes with the latter.

But Paulson's nightmare is not over with. Next is the privately run and owned Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, two of the largest mortgage lenders. Paulson finds himself in the dubious position of once again staving off disaster by nationalizing both companies. Before he can fathom the intervention he has always shunned, he finds a new disaster cropping up in Lehman Brothers. This time he follows his principle of ""moral hazard."" That is to let the company fail from its own mismanagement. He does, and the reverberations are not only felt nationally but around the world.

As the bell sounds twice, thou shalt deny free market capitalism thrice to paraphrase the Bible, and Paulson is becoming big in denial of lifelong beliefs. A.I.G. the largest insurance company in the world never expected a company like Lehman to fail or be allowed to fail. They hold credit default swaps that guarantee the toxic assets of the Lehman, and now they are on the hook for its collapse--only they don't have the capital to honor their commitments.  Paulson now realizes that his decision to allow Lehman's demise is about to trigger global recession, and he will preside over the greatest depression in history, unless he does something--again.

Only Paulson's attempt to get help from the Congress backfires as his own Republican colleagues there kill the bill. The last ingredient for the disaster recipe is complete. Ireland has financial woes. Iceland goes bankrupt. Great Britain begins bailing out banks. His only remedy left is inserted in a bill that most conservative congressman miss, an injection of capital from the federal government. Paulson, a life-long capitalist comes full circle becoming one of the most interventionist Treasury Secretaries in history.

He summons the bankers and tells them the government will lend them money to loan out to cash-strapped insitutions. In effect, the government will become part owner in the nine biggest banks in the country. While the bankers balk, he tells them it is not negotiable. He is not asking; he is telling. They will sign a paper agreeing to the commissions before they leave New York that evening. A cool 150 billion in bailout money is on its through the economy. Paulson's last resort, capital injection, an act he personally abhors is initiated.

This program aired one month after Obama replaced Paulson with Tim Geitner at Treasury. It ends telling us that 350 billion was pumped into the economy and only time will tell how much more will be needed and if it will be enough.

It turns out, it wasn't.

3815183,4,B001UW59KS,"This Frontline DVD provides a dispassionate chronological retrospective of the financial meltdown. It gives an opportunity to consider the step by step crash and burn of the economy which we do not have as the events occur.

Its strength is 1) the interviews with some of the key players such as Barney Frank and economics specialists; 2) the discussion in the conference rooms with Geithner, Paulson and the heads of the Wall Street Banks; and 3) the discussion with Bernanke and Paulson in meetings with House and Senate leaders.  We learn their reactions at the moment events occur. There is a discussion of the Henry Paulson-Richard Fuld realtionship when Paulson was at Goldman Sachs and the pivotal role that played in the failure of Lehman Brothers.  Apparently, Paulson failed to anticipate the banking systems' reaction to the Lehman bankruptcy.

We also learn CNBC's role broadcasting rumors that ""greased the slope"" into the meltdown.

8345316,4,B001UW59KS,"I've read (and watched) quite a few accounts of what went wrong in the 2008 financial-economic crisis and what has (and has not) been done to prevent a recurrence.  Yesterday I watched this documentary produced via PBS.  It is a bit dated; (copyright 2009) and primarily a focus on what was done in the first weeks after the real crisis began, and why.  There are much more comprehensive accounts if you're interested; for example focused on this short time-frame ""Too Big to Fail"" either the book or the movie is excellent.  This did contain a few statements affecting my view [possible spoiler alert now].  That when ""Hank"" Paulson said Lehmann went bankrupt because the government did not have the ""authority"" to rescue it, this is essentially a lie.  This explains how Bear-Sterns was ""bailed out"" before, which was no more illegal than a bailout of Lehmann Bros would have been.  The real reason why Lehmann was allowed to fail was to reinforce the idea of ""moral hazard"" ie, the government would not rescue every large financial institution that risked billions (or trillions?) of dollars in bad gambles.  Paulson was taking a lot of heat for rescuing Bear Sterns and decided he had to ""draw a line in the sand"" somewhere.  Perhaps it was the wrong decision (because that act is what really led to a total freezing of credit market operations and possible worldwide financial collapse) but perhaps it was also necessary as Congress probably would have done nothing had there not been an obvious emergency.  In any case the argument that the government ""couldn't"" was purely an excuse.  [Let me say I'm not one subscribing to the idea that Mr. Paulson had malicious intent or was acting in any other way than what he believed at the time was the best interest of the economy--it was simply a wrong decision.  The real troublesome problem was that even after the crisis was at its peak, many members of both the administration and Congress continued to subscribe to the bankrupt ideas that, in general, ""deregulation"" and ""free markets"" are the best situation, and that so little has been done to prevent another, even worse crisis (it never unfolds in exactly the same way, just like the next war never goes like the previous one did).  Further there has been no real reform of the problem that REGULATORS CANNOT PROPERLY REGULATE AN INDUSTRY THEY HOPE TO GO TO WORK FOR AFTER THEY LEAVE GOVERNMENT, EARNING A LOT MORE MONEY.  This is a severe and inherent conflict of interest that pevents adequate regulation to stop risky behavior (including criminal prosecutions which--hey--HAVE NOT HAPPPENED).  Also nothing has been done to prevent the ""buying of Congress"" by millions of dollars in campaign contributions by (just for example) large financial institutions, particularly directed toward committee members (of both parties) that sit on the committees that must draft improved regulations.  This is how bills like ""new regulations"" end up getting WRITTEN by lawyers working for the corporations being ""regulated"".  This DVD is short (about 60 minutes) and informative.  Although inadequate by itself, it is a nice review if someone is just starting to try to understand just what happened in 2008.
