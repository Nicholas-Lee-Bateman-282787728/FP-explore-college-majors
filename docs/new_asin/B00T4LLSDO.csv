7000130,2,B00T4LLSDO,"I'm writing this from a high school teacher's perspective.  Yes the video is wonderful for what it is but not for great for High School science.  Very little scientific information given and frankly the kids were a bit bored watching it.  What it did highlight was stunning visually for sure, but again, for a teaching tool, not so much.  It could work well at the upper primary or junior high levels.  I bought it because of all the super high reviews and I'm just hoping to save that next high school teacher from spending his/her own on it.",1497312000,,543,4.5

So much in the world to see, yet this video reveals just the tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg of things about us that without specialized equipment, we'd never be aware of.

[A city is shown.]  Looks like an average city.  We know what we will see on these streets, inside these walls, or so we think.

[Zooms into people in the building.]  The people living in this apartment building are surrounded by things they cant see.  All of us are.  Everywhere.  Things too slow for our eyes to detect or too fast to follow.  But things that can be seen only through light waves invisible to us.

A day in their lives [that is, the lives of the people in the building] will look a lot different if they could see all the light waves around them.  Or see other worlds around us that are too smallmicroscopic-- or smaller yet, down to the heart of matter itself.

Imagine if for one day we could see what they [the people in the building] cant.  All thats too slow, too fast, too small, or simply invisible.  It would forever change our understanding of the planet we live on.

The above is spoken by the narrator (actor Forest Whitaker) at the very beginning of this fascinating documentary.

This film reveals phenomena that cant be seen with the naked eye.

First, we are transported to the INVISIBLE world of light (ultraviolet, X-rays, etc.).  The more invisible light we can see, the more secrets we can uncover about the world around us.

Next, thanks to time-lapse photography, we experience events that occur TOO SLOWLY for human perception.  We are shown the ultimate time-lapse image: the anatomy of the Earth brought to life.

Thirdly, we get to see, due to high-speed cameras, the beauty and drama of events that occur in the flash of a microsecond.  That is, we experience phenomena that is TOO FAST for our vision.  Here, we are shown the greatest flyer in nature.

Finally, we enter the TOO SMALL or microscopic world.  The microscope allows us to see creatures in common pond water that we never knew existed.

The electron microscope allows us to magnify things even more, up to a million times to reveal things both bizarre and beautiful.

Then we get to experience the nanoworld, an incomprehensibly small world where we are allowed to actually see individual atoms.  Incredible!!

If youve read this far, you can probably guess that everything in this documentary is visually stunning and, for me, unforgettable.  As well, the narration is just excellent.

The disc itself (released in 2015) has two interesting extras: a making of (15 min) and a photo gallery.

Finally, there is a second disc that is a 3D version of this film.  To watch this, you need (1) full HD 3D TV (2) compatible 3D glasses (3) Blu-ray 3D video player and (4) high speed HDMI cable.

In conclusion, this is an unforgettable documentary that shows you things that you have probably never seen before.  I leave you with what the narrator says near the end:

Were on the threshold of extraordinary [scientific] advances born of our drive to see whats hidden in the world around us.

7000150,4,B00T4LLSDO,"Mr Whitaker narrates and does a superlative job.  The film is about light,  objects, size,  waves and motion that we cannot ordinarily see. The film explains it in a way we can understand, shows it and its all stunning. The photography is beautiful and the 3D has lots of depth (although nothing will pop out of the screen) and the 5D surround sound is put to great use.  There isn't a story of course as Its a documentary but I was in awe for the entire 40 minutes.  Hense the only issue.  This DVD is a a bit too short at 40 minutes.  Otherwise this is an excellent choice to show off you 3D video and 5.1 sound system and get a little education to boot.  Highly recommended.",1465689600,6,677,4.234375

First, the 3D effect is awesome!  It looks beautiful!
The information, and the delivery of the information in the documentary are both superb.
I had never thought about what the world would look like if I could see all the invisible bands of light.  Or, what if you could see ""slow enough"" to notice a flower bloom, or ""fast"" enough to watch a bullet shatter a light bulb and how the glass breaks up.
What if you could see small enough to see that even ants have smaller bugs on them, just as we have microscopic organisms on us.
It's really a great documentary.  They don't even waste time preaching on how humans are going to destroy the earth blah blah blah.",1443916800,2,756,4.347517730496454

The picture quality is very clear with really good 3D. There are some scenes that really come at you. Actually, I wouldn't recommend this show to some younger viewers since there are a couple of really graphic scenes showing [high speed] decompositions of a rodent, strawberries (gross) and mold and mushroom growths.

I'm happy to have this National Geographic show in my 3D DVD collection. I'm sure I will watch it again and again and probably learn something new every time.",1436313600,13,708,4.795081967213115
7000192,5,B00T4LLSDO,"I watched this with my 6 year daughter. We both loved it immensely. The owl scene was one of the best 3d effect I've seen, including avatar, so clear. The information was ok for me, maybe what you would get in high school, but for my daughter, it open up a new world. It definitely provoked thought, and gave her a sense of how fascinating science can be. Made me decide to go buy some more 3D nature documentaries for her to explore. The 3D did give the movie that extra something that held my child's attention, I don't think she would have been as impressed had we watched it in 2d. As for the appropriateness  of the film for a 6yr; there was only one 5 second scene of a dead rat decaying; that I covered her eyes for. But she is very sinsitive towards that. The last scenes that talk about what's living on you right now, could be scary to a child, but mine thought it was cool and gross, lol. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie as a family movie, that would be best loved in 3D.",1435968000,5,988,4.2

I received it today and just finished watching in 3D on a 49"" LG UHD TV with 5.1 surround sound.  I will leave the review of the program to the other reviewer.  They have done a great job with it.  This is for the ""3D and High Def Presentation"".  The 3D is very lifelike and has great depth and several OOS effects (watch out for the owl).  Some of the scenes might even get you to move away from the screen...  But that won't help much.  ;-}  The picture is clear and colors are natural thru out.  Don't forget, Mr. Whitaker did a great job as narrator.

All in all, this is one of my favorite 3D discs.  I do recommend very highly to anyone interested in the UNSEEN WORLD or the world of 3D.

This may be my best 3D video I own, although I have quite a few nice ones, I think this one may show off 3D the best.",1523404800,,295,3.578125
8700263,5,B00T4LLSDO,"Stunning. I'll be watching this again, and looking for others by the same producers.

Exquisite production. And I think this would do more to interest a kid in science than 99 out of 100 science classes. As an adult, it readily made even the science I missed make sense.

This DVD is one of those things that can make you grateful to live in the modern world.",1523318400,,359,4.343283582089552
