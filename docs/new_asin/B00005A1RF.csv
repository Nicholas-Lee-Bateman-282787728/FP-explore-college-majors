1411828,5,B00005A1RF,"I just purchased THE BOOK OF POOH for my 6-year old son and he loves it. The puppet renditions are a really refreshing look on the old characters. These stories play like a series of shows onto themselves, but the wonderful moral - if you want to call it that - of this movie is READING. Winnie The Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Rabbit, Kessie, Owl, and even Eeyore are gathered together in Christopher Robin's room for an afternoon of ... READING. My son watches this movie from start to finish and then brings me a stack of his books for me to read to him. How wonderful. This movie is not just good because of what is seen on the TV screen, but is also good for the reading it promotes afterwards. Obviously, a two year old may be a bit young to benefit from the theme, but school age children and kindergartener's will be delighted. My 1-year old daughter also likes the movie, most likely because of the puppet renditions themselves.
Pooh's story takes him on an adventure to the top of a hill, chasing a butterfly around and around, down the hill the way he came and back into his friends, whom he believes to be strangers who look like his friends on the other side of the hill. Piglets story has Piglet learning how to be a Tigger. Kessie's story has her wanting Owl to teach her everything he knows, while Owl actually teaches her that a little knowledge goes a long way. Owl also teaches Kessie that a lot of knowledge can be obtained from reading books. Rabbit's story has Rabbit teaching Tigger how to garden and Tigger teaching Rabbit something about being friends. Tigger's story has Tigger staying up all night, not wanting to miss anything, while his friends show him that there is nothing to miss at night except sleep. Eeyore's story tells of the elements of friendship and surprizes when it comes to Eeyore's Tail-aversary.

Well, the Book of Pooh does it for my daughter.  We faithfully watch The Book of Pooh every day on Playhouse Disney (their morning lineup on the Disney channel), and she absolutely loves it.  She loves the songs, and the characters, even though they are puppets they look so life like,(Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, Pigglet, Owl, & Kessie the blue bird)  and it's wonderful how they put those characters in a computer generated background. The colors are bright and eye-catching, and best of all I even I like this show. (If I can't stand to watch it then why make my daughter watch it????)

1411847,1,B00005A1RF,"Someone thought using animation *and* puppetry would be better than just one. They were wrong. It's unappealing and not a little disquieting, and--if you've enjoyed other versions of Pooh before--so much less satisfying. The animations (projected on green screen?) look particularly bad: very poor resolution. All in all visually, it's almost nauseating.

The voices sound pretty good, but what's wrong with the classic Pooh stories? Why come up with new ones that aren't as good, and drop some of the characters? Plus these stories move s-l-o-w.

I rented this one and am glad because though the stories are interesting and well-told, there is something annoying and artificial about the animation [puppet like figures] that doesn't hold her interest as much as the cartoons do. We enjoyed Pooh's Great Adventure, Piglet's Big Movie, The Heffalump Movie etc, but this one is passable at most. And it is sad that they deemed the characters of Kanga & Roo minor to the point of excluding them from this production. The bird character Kessie was rather annoying too. That being said, it is an OK production, though I'd recommend some of the other Winnie the Pooh & Friends movies over this.",1190678400,3,731,4.674418604651163

1411850,1,B00005A1RF,"My 18 mo. daughter and I watch lots of Pooh movies (more than 12 now) and this one is the worst by far.  The animation is annoying and cheesy and did not hold her interest at all like the other Pooh films.  Piglet's Big Movie, The Tigger Movie, Adventures of Winnie the Pooh are her favorites.  Very Merry Pooh Year is a good one as well.",1169683200,,338,4.090909090909091
1411851,1,B00005A1RF,"Sorry, but this movie had me almost grinding my teeth the whole time I was watching it. I was tempted to turn it off a number of times, but thought, ""I'll at least give it a chance.""  Well, it had its chance, and it failed miserably.

Why did they get rid of Kanga and Roo and replace them with some annoying little bird named Kessie?  Was it so Owl could have a bird companion?  I have no idea what the logic behind that decision was, but I think it was a very poor one.  Kanga and Roo added a lot to the original ""Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" and I miss Kanga's mothering influence (the only female in the whole story) and Roo's childish innocence.  Kessie sticks out like a sore thumb, and though she's a female, she doesn't have the warmth and sweetness of Kanga.

I haven't even mentioned the puppets and backdrops.  Ug.  That's about all I can say.  The puppets don't move in even a remotely convincing way and the backdrops are way too bright and blurry.  It doesn't even look like the Hundred Acre Wood.

The dialogue is, in keeping with other recent Pooh failures, dull and lacking humor.  The stories themselves, if re-written with a more witty dialogue, would maybe be okay, but not done with puppets.  If they took those stories (except for the one about Tessie -- they would have to replace that one with a story about Kanga and Roo), and animated them in the same style as the original Pooh shorts, that may be something.

The American Christopher Robin is all wrong.  I always loved to hear that sweet, gentle voice with the delicate British accent he had in the original movie.  Making him an American makes him seem just like any other American boy, not Pooh's Christopher Robin.  His mother in ""The Book of Pooh"" is ridiculous.  One minute, the room is obviously a mess, and the next minute it's clean.  Any mother would have been like, ""How the heck did that happen?""  Instead, she says, ""Oh, I must have made a mistake.""  Yeah right!  She must have short-term memory loss!  And what's with cutting their heads off?  Why is it so terrible to see their faces?

I did like how reading was emphasized in this movie, but the  cons far out-weighed the pros, and I'm sure I can find another much better movie that illustrates how important reading is.  Or, I could just do what I've always done and read actual paper books to my kids.  Doesn't that illustrate the same point much better?  There are lots of very cute Pooh books out there, and my son has quite a few and loves them.  My advice to you is to skip this ""Book of Poo"" (purposely miss-spelled) and instead spend your money on a real paper book, or a few, about Pooh.",1142467200,2,2647,4.4070247933884295

1411853,4,B00005A1RF,"With Playhouse Disney turning ever more away from traditional Disney (such as cancelling this charming show), I highly recommend this DVD. Your child can play at least a few episodes again and again. Not as rambunctious and hyper as some of the newer shows on the channel.

The traditional Winnie-the-Pooh is a little too advanced for him (too much dialogue), but the Book of Pooh is perfect.  And Tigger is hilarious to listen to.  There are several cute stories and the songs are fun.  My 23 month old sings the ""Happy 'Tail'iversary"" song all day long.  The true test of a good video, though, is how well I like hearing it after weeks of playing.  This is the only one I haven't gotten sick of, yet.",1025049600,5,569,4.212962962962963
1411856,3,B00005A1RF,"Although I haven't had cable TV for some time now, it seems that Disney has decided to bring Pooh & Co. back in yet another incarnation, this time as a series on the Disney Channel and as puppets with computer-generated backgrounds.  Kanga and Roo are MIA, but the rest of the gang (Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, Tigger, Owl and Eeyore) are still around, and are joined by a newly generated (and blandly generic) bluebird character named Kessie.  Each ""episode"" (of which there are four on this release) claims to have a lesson to impart, but these are pitifully simple lessons, such as the definition of a map, or that communication can be accomplished without words.  Perhaps the developmental psychologists can do better than I can in determining how all of this educates our youngsters--for my part, I think it's probably as worthless as all television, if (in this case) relatively harmless.
Regardless, my daughter loves all the ""Book of Pooh"" tapes (there are, as of this writing, three of them, including this one, ""Fun with Words,"" and the ""Book of Pooh"" general release).  Viewers should be warned of the high variability in quality among these tapes--and also that this tape in particular is by far the best of them.  ""Fun with Friends"" is from a different world than the execrable ""Fun with Words""--the stories are fun, the songs almost memorable, and the characters about as close to their original incarnations as one can ever expect from Disney.  That this makes ""Fun with Friends"" only an average kiddie video should dissuade no one from allowing their child to become addicted to its pleasures.",1015632000,2,1603,4.8966789667896675

1411858,4,B00005A1RF,"I read the other reviews of this video before purchasing, and was a little worried by the negative ones.  However, I think most young children will have no objections.  My five-year-old son enjoys the original Pooh movies (like The Blustery Day), the lower-quality TV series videos, and the newer ones.  He thinks this one is great.  (I wonder if this is analogous to Star Trek:  We older Original Series fans just can't get into the newer incarnations, whereas others enjoy them all.)
The animation was a little funny-looking:  Pooh has too much of a neck, for one thing.  The music and the stories were pretty good.  Young Pooh fans will love it.
I think, for overall quality, the original Pooh movies and ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"" are superior.  (I'd actually recommend  ""Pooh's Grand Adventure,"" over ""The Book of Pooh.""  Even though it's not A. A. Milne either, the music, artwork, and writing are truly first-rate.)",1012089600,3,920,4.909090909090909

My daughter was instantly able to relate to them and eagerly watched the rest of the movie. The movie is made up of a few short stories dealing which each character. Afterwards I asked her why she liked the movie and she said that the characters in this movie look real compared to the animated ones.

Mitchell also is the creator of Bear in The Big Blue House, a favorite around our house. Hannah enjoyed The Book of Pooh, which in the end is vastly more important than my enjoyment of it. The DVD runs 70 mins, and Hannah sat and watched it from beginning to end (a mark of a good kid's DVD). The effect that they use on The Book of Pooh, where they marry puppets and computer animated backgrounds, is really cool; I found it much more aesthetic and approachable than the computer-only animation shows out there (like Rollie Pollie Olie). Honestly, I enjoy watching Bear in The Big Blue House more with Hannah, but The Book of Pooh was lightyears beyond the annoying Dragon Tales or insufferable Rugrats and I really like how at its heart The Book of Pooh is about teaching kids to love reading and storytelling.

But this is a new movie, not like The Tigger Movie or Pooh's Grand Adenture: The Search for Chirstopher Robin, that has been out for a year or more.
The only chacter in this movie that hasn't appeared in any A.A Milne's stories is Kessie. (A Blue Bird). But who cares about that anyway? In fact I think Kessie might have been on the Winnie The Pooh show twice before the THe Book of Pooh made its debut this year. Come on, give this movie a try.
