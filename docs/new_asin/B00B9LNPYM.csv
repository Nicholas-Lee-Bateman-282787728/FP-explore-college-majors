8564767,5,B00B9LNPYM,"Absolutely wonderful series.  Lead dancer, Tara, is exquisite, and other dancers are outstanding.  Hard to believe there is this much talent in Australia and grateful I was flipping through channels on TV and saw this show accidentally one Saturday so bought the collection.  Only thing NOT believable is the lack of adults in the dorms at nighttime and the fact that most of the kids actually get along with each other.",1408665600,,420,4.887323943661972
