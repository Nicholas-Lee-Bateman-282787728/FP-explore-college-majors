8347808,5,B001XW7IHM,"Just finished two days of Nonstop and two days of Dynamic Tension. Nonstop is fast and quick 20 minute both days workout, fun and all body parts covered.  Then Nonstop is three paired sets all using a medium weight quite slowly with ten reps in each set.  Really fun to slow way down and use good form in focused attention.  Been working with Joyce's videos in six day rotations for 6 months and really firming and slimming up.  Joyce videos are uncomplicated and just basic lifting, no fancy steps and gyrations, just solid strength training.",1437609600,,543,4.684210526315789
