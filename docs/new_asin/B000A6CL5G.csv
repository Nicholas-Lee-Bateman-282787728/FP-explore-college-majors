2363866,5,B000A6CL5G,I love this workout.  So must fun. It goes by so fast and you really work up a good cardio sweat yet it isn't hard. I love love love this one. It's such a great workout. My new favorite.,1129161600,14,186,3.769230769230769
2363867,4,B000A6CL5G,"i've had this set for several months and i still use it 2-3x's a week.  the ""cardio"" portion involves arm swings (fun & provide some toning), lunges (get the heart rate up) & little hops. this would be do-able for a beginner to advanced.  mariel proves to be a great teacher and she has great chemistry with rodney yee.  my only kaveat is that i wish there were more core work and some hip openers.  this would be a good addition to a current practice but i don't think i would rely soley on this.  overall a good solid package.",1125360000,40,528,4.24
2363907,3,B000A6CL5G,"I started with Rodney Yee years ago when he first was on Oprah & yoga was really first mainstream. I still love his style along with Rainbeau Mars, Wai Lana, Seane Corn, Shiva Rea & only a few others.
I only rented from the library the 30 min core & 50 min. accelerated style. There are so many mountain poses, swing the arms to relax the shoulders & little hops, that I started FFwing through those & saw there were only a few poses & some done several times (like chair/powerful pose which I DO love, great to help standing fwd bends) that I was a bit disappointed. Dr. Beth wrote a great review stating the poses done.
Many poses were held a good length of time while Rodney & Mariel talked about how great the pose feels, how to get into it deeper, what to watch out for & even little cute comments like Rodney saying, ""See how much my legs are tightly clenched? You can see I was really feeling it.""
I enjoyed Mariel's & Rodney's lighthearted talking either each taking turns pointing things out during the 30 min workout or as a  voice over on the 50 min. It would be great for those days I don't feel I can relax to a quiet/silent yoga workout, I just wish it didn't have so much arm swinging & little hops.

You can see a nice trailer for each of the 4 dvds at the distributor's site: gaiam",1166918400,17,1298,4.208835341365462
2363908,5,B000A6CL5G,"I have a lot of health problems, I have been using this program for 4 months.  It has helped in so many ways, weight loss, pain managent and over all feeling of wellness.",1160092800,9,170,4.151515151515151
2363909,5,B000A6CL5G,"I also reccommend this highly for beginners. (I'm one of those folks.) I haven't tried the 50 minute yet either, as I believe I will switch to an easy intermediate tape/DVD/class at that point. I've tried yoga tapes before that either left me behind or destroyed (""Power Yoga""). Rodney & Mariel's workouts are ideal for a person getting back in shape, & they are motivational without being cheesy. I didn't need the diet plan info., but looked through it and found it very unrealistic for anyone that works outside of the home. If you work in the home I think it would be great. 9-5'ers may do better going to a nutritionist (many health plans allow you a free or next to free 1st trip.) The DVD is geared towards those wanting to lose weight, I didn't need that, so I would've like to see a beginner meditation session guided by Rodney. Perhaps they'll come out with an intermediate set with this? Anyhow, those wanting to lose weight could stand to look through their healthy eating plan, as it does have good advice, but unrealistic daytime meal plans.

I highly recommend this to all beginners and those seeking stress relief. My body and mind feel clearer, calmer, and healthier since beginning this set. I think both are great instructors and motivators in this series.

For those wanting practices with higher difficulty & Rodney's great attitude and world-reknowned knowledge, checkout his website.",1155859200,14,1406,4.829875518672199
2363910,5,B000A6CL5G,"This is what got me hooked into doing yoga.  As you can guess, I am a beginner.  I have not completed the 50 min session as I haven't worked up to it yet ;).  But I absolutely love doing the 10 min AM and PM exercises.  In fact, sometimes I do the AM during a break at work and it totally energizes me. I have noticed I sleep a little better when I ""end the evening with Rodney"".

I too, love the chemistry between Rodney and Mariel. It looks like they are having fun and that makes the difference. Yoga should be fun as well as challenging.

The photo chart of the poses come in handy for the beginner who is trying to learn the names (it seems like each dvd gives a different name to the same pose)!

If you are just starting, then I would highly recommend this set.  It is affordable, fun and well packaged.

I have lost 5 lbs from doing yoga daily (I also do Rodney's Power Yoga for Flexibility) for about 2 months now and am pleased with the results.  I am enjoying this set so much, that I am sure I am wearing out my dvds.",1148256000,8,1029,4.024630541871921
2363911,4,B000A6CL5G,"Yoga Now is billed as a comprehensive exercise program which combines the benefits of yoga with cardio for weight loss. Included in this 3-DVD set are a 30 minute core workourt, a 50 minute accelerated workout, and 2 10 minute workouts, the a.m. energizer and the p.m. destresser. The practices are led by internationally-known yogi Rodney Yee and actress Mariel Hemingway, a long-time yoga practitioner.

I began with the 30 minute workout. Here Rodney and Mariel teach via live instruction a class of three students (one of whom is Rodney's girlfriend, yoga instructor Colleen Staidman). The practice starts in a reclined position and focuses on breathing, then moves into stretches/core work including a reclined leg stretch, nose to knee, abdominals, and twists; a kneeling cat/cow sequence follows. Next, you transition to standing, where you perform the three ""cardio"" moves. The first is a full body arm swing performed with bent legs (fans of Callanetics will recognize this as one of her warm-up stretches). Next comes a small hop move, with your arms swinging in front of you and your feet barely leaving the floor. Finally, you will get down into a lunge position and quickly move from one leg to the other; this was the most strenuous of the three. The standing postures included down dog, modified side angle, and a vinyasa series (down dog to plank to cobra/up dog), and the practice finishes with a quick cobbler's and relaxation poses.

I found the 50 minute accelerated practice to be almost identical to the 30 minute, with only a few key differences: 1) Rodney and Mariel instruct via voiceover here, and 2) the cardio moves are repeated more frequently, and similarly, there are more frequent vinyasa series between each of the poses. The opening floor sequence is virtually the same as the 30 minute practice. Once you reach a standing position, you will do the arm swings and hops followed by a vinyasa, then triangle, chair pose, and another sequence of arm swings and hops. After another vinyasa, you will do modified side angle, the arm swings, warrior 1, and then the lunges. After returning to the arm swings and the hops followed by a vinyasa, you add warrior 2. In a seated position, you perform a twist and a 1-legged forward bend; the practice ends with relaxation and a final seated meditation.

The a.m. practice is led by Mariel alone instructing via voiceover. She begins in staff pose, and she repeatedly emphasizes lengthening the waist. She performs simple twists and a cat/cow series, and then she goes into all three cardio moves. Standing poses include only down dog and warrior 2, and the practice ends in mountain pose. Rodney leads the p.m. practice, also via voiceover. This practice concentrates on a series of seated forward bends performed using a chair (you rest your arms and head on the chair). There is also a reclined leg stretch using a strap and a nice relaxation pose with your legs on the chair to finish. This set includes bonus materials as well, the best of which is a pose chart featuring clear, colorful illustrations of Mariel performing all of the featured postures (broken down into sun saluations, seated poses, standing poses, supine poses, and poses with the chair). There is also a daily journal allowing you to record your progress, a nutrition plan (includes a ""core food"" guide, serving information, meal plans, and a grocery list), and a 2-week quick start meal plan.

To my surprise, I found these workouts to be fairly enjoyable; Rodney and Mariel have a nice chemistry, and they worked well together, particularly when teaching live. However, I definitely did NOT feel that the ""cardio"" moves included in these workouts were enough to provide any real aerobic benefit, and thus I don't see how anyone could lose weight with these videos (other than perhaps those who were completely sedentary to begin with). I enjoyed the 10 minute practices the best; in the a.m. practice, the cardio moves do work well both to get the blood flowing and to wake up the body, and the p.m. practice was genuinely relaxing. I also thought that the 30-minute core workout was a nice, basic level level yoga practice; again, the cardio moves helped to energize the body here. The 50 minute workout was my least favorite, as I found it to be too repetitive.

On the whole, this set was too easy for me, as I have been practicing yoga for several years now and consider myself to be at about an intermediate level. I think that these workouts would be best suited to someone who has tried yoga before and has found it to be too slow or ""boring"" but who would also find ""power"" yoga to be too strenuous--Yoga Now bridges that gap, providing a different kind of energizing practice for yoga beginners.",1142812800,10,4753,4.834152334152334
2363912,5,B000A6CL5G,I love this DVD set.  I can do a fast 30 minute workout or other workouts.  It is fun.,1142380800,,86,3.473684210526316
2363913,5,B000A6CL5G,"I was really pleased with yoga now and the information it contained.  I also enjoy the workouts a lot.  I have been doing a mix of the 30 min. and 50 min. for about a month now and i feel more toned, stronger, and have more energy.  also, i looked forward to doing these exercises, which is unusual for me.  I was a runner for many years and stopped because it got old and was a chore.  Yoga Now was never a chore for me.  I enjoy every minute I do them.  ALso, Rodney Yee is a great instructor...

2363914,5,B000A6CL5G,"I got this set because I saw the infomercial which quickly aroused my curiosity. I'm glad I did because I had such fun with them! I started out with the 30-minute workout. That was such fun, really enjoyable. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer. The chemistry between Rodney Yee and Mariel Hemingway was pleasant. I am now officially a fan of Rodney Yee.",1136937600,8,361,4.569230769230769

2363916,5,B000A6CL5G,"I had been looking for a while for a yoga DVD that offered Rodney Yee's expertise with a class setting.  I have all of Yee's DVDs and most of them are filmed outdoors (which is lovely and soothing) but this one is filmed indoors with a class setting.  Mariel is a great yoga instructor too and her 20 plus years of yoga experience really shows.

I like this because it is a good workout but it really makes you feel like you are part of the class too.

A nice plus...if you enjoy the music in the other Gaiam yoga DVDs you will be happy to know that the music in Yoga Now is very similar.

This is a very good DVD and one I believe I will enjoy for a long time.",1129852800,26,661,3.9398496240601504

8074839,5,B000A6CL5G,Ths is an excellent DVD for anyone new to yoga or who wants to get back to paying attention to all of the breathing and poses. I like that it has different time periods for practice and special A.M/P.M. yoga practices that allow you to unwind and yet not take a lot of time. I am very happy to have found this available and feel it is worth the price.,1447027200,,351,4.0285714285714285

8074842,5,B000A6CL5G,Excellent careful instruction.  Great modified poses for those of us with issues/injuries. Wonderful flow and rythm to the workouts. Lovely music and vibe from both Rodney and Mariel. It makes the workout fun!,1375315200,,209,5.333333333333333
8074843,3,B000A6CL5G,"I like the 50 minute dvd, it's a nice change if you just want to do some form of yoga but 30 minutes feels too short. Mariel's voice over is annoying. Also, at the end of the program they both talk about taking a moment of ""quiet"" to go inside yourself but they talk through this moment the entire time. I just work out with the dvd and turn off the sound.",1292976000,,356,3.9583333333333335
8074844,3,B000A6CL5G,I like Rodney on his own - best yet is his 5 day am yoga.  my husband said this sounded like a reality series fro afar.  The poses are standard with some cardio mixed in.,1292544000,,170,3.8285714285714287
8074845,5,B000A6CL5G,"...I am in love. I used to use my roommate's Yoga Zone set every once in a while-the p.m. DVD and the fat-burning DVD most often, but I didn't like the instructor, so I didn't want to buy the set. (Sorry, the guy just seemed like a creep to me.) When I saw this set, Rodney and Mariel lacked the ""creep"" factor, and the set offered the same workouts I wanted.

I must not have been reading the set very well because I wasn't prepared for as much cardio as I got (I'm still a beginner and I'm used to more poses held for long amounts of time, rather than the quick movements offered in Yoga Now). During the 30 minute workout, I was exhausted, like I had just worked out on the treadmill for an hour.

I do have to agree with the reviewer who said the giggling between Rodney and Mariel was a little distracting. I wasn't expecting it either while I was posing with my eyes closed--maybe that's why the initial instructions say to watch the DVDs first before performing them, but I skipped that part.

I just finished the p.m. de-stressing yoga and, wow, I couldn't believe how fast 10 minutes went by, and how relaxed I was at the end of it.

Great for beginners, although for those who pretty much don't exercise much (don't worry, I'm one of you), starting off with this set, even the 10 minute versions at first before moving on, is excellent. The fact that I did two workouts in one day surprised me, it really did. I can't wait to do the a.m. workout in the morning. For only 10 minutes, it shouldn't make much of a difference at all in my schedule.",1230595200,2,1554,4.275510204081633
8074846,2,B000A6CL5G,"I have a different point of view from the other reviewers I read.  I found the set disappointing because I have an old yoga DVD by Rodney Yee that I love and expected this one to be calm and relaxing like that one.  I hated all the chattiness and giggling that was going on in this one, it distracted me from the way I like to do yoga.

If you're looking for a yoga DVD that is soothing and quiet, DON'T buy this one!  If you want something more like a regular workout tape that does use yoga postures but with people talking a lot and trying to keep your attention, this might be OK for you.  I just kept wanting to tell them to quiet down and stop being so silly.",1179878400,9,665,4.007575757575758
8074847,5,B000A6CL5G,I am a big fan of Mariel and have read her book about healthy living.  She got me started in Yoga and this DVD set is the best I have done and most fun.  The 30 minute one really got me going.  I love Rodney Yee also.  The 2 10 minutes ones are wonderful too.  I really like doing the 10 minutes in the morning before I go to work.  It makes me feel like I actually worked out.,1172275200,3,377,3.7088607594936707
