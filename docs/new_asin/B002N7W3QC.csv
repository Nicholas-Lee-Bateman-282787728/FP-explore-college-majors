3958407,5,B002N7W3QC,"As one of the early proponents of hard rock in the 70's, Thin Lizzy helped blaze the trail for the explosion of heavy metal in the 80's.  Are You Ready? is a 19 song, 110 minute long performance, shot in Lorelei, Germany, for the German music program Rockpalast, in 1981.  The band lineup is the same one that recorded Chinatown (1980).  Phil Lynott on bass and vocals, Scott Gorham on guitar, Brian Downey on drums, and the band's newest members guitarist Snowy White, and Darren Wharton on keyboards.

The concert looks quite good for a performance this age, although the resolution is not the best.  The editing is nicely done, and features a variety of camera angles with unobstructed views.  When the stage is lighted red almost all detail is lost, and the image occasionally has some distorting horizontal lines, but otherwise the video is pretty watchable.  Dolby digital stereo, Dolby digital 5.1 and DTS surround sound, are the available options.  The sound quality is mostly good, except for some issues with the guitars.  Lynott's vocals and bass, and Downey's drums, both sound great.  However at various times the guitar of either Gorham or White, seems muffled or muted.  This distraction is mostly tolerable, as Lizzy's twin guitar attack kind of conceals the issue, until someone is playing a solo.

The DVD apparently contains the complete performance, which features a nice mix of the band's catalog.  Included is the brand new song Hollywood (Down On Your Luck), plus Chinatown, Sugar Blues, and Genocide from the Chinatown album.  Songs from Fighting (1975) include Suicide, and Rosalie, and with Memory Pain, the band even delves into the blues.  Lizzy draws most heavily from their classic albums Jailbreak, and Black Rose.  The classic anthem, The Boys Are Back In Town, is what most people know the band for.  A speeded up version of Cowboy Song, packs a  bit more punch than the album version.  Jailbreak is always a favorite number live.  All about excess, Got To Give It Up, is perhaps the most prophetic song Phil Lynott ever penned.  Emerald, and Black Rose, are a Lizzy specialty, an Irish folk legend given life in a rock song.  Black Rose is a showcase for the harmony lead guitar playing of White and Gorham, and also features a drum solo by Downey.  A mostly laid back Snowy White, who does a pretty good job of duplicating the licks of previous Thin Lizzy guitarists, seems so much more comfortable playing his own music, particularly on a smoking hot version of Sugar Blues, another song about drug abuse.  What is pretty cool is that after performing a long set, Lizzy returned to a chilly stage for a final encore, to perform Emerald, and Angel of Death (called Desaster here), which like Hollywood, would later appear on the Renegade (1981) album.

While not with some visual and audio glitches, this is still a very well preserved performance from this period in the band's history.  There some 80's metal bands that do not have concert footage of comparable quality.  Phil and the band are in good form, and Wharton's keyboards add some texture, and helps to minimize the sound issues with the guitars.  Reasonably priced, it would be a nice addition to the hard rock concert collection.",1261267200,24,3228,4.841240875912408
3958408,3,B002N7W3QC,"The sound quality is spotty on this DVD. The guitars are barely audible for the first few songs, but for some reason get louder later in the show.
I must say this is one of the better Phil Lynott performances I've seen on video. He has a good time. Brian Downey is simply awesome on drums.
Snowy White is not one of the better guitarists that Lizzy had, and it's pretty evident on this DVD. The guy looked bored a lot of the time.

All in all, this is not half bad for the year it was recorded (1981). Don't expect superior sound or video. Just dig on the rare lineup for Lizzy and the rarely performed songs.",1259452800,3,609,4.161016949152542
3958419,5,B002N7W3QC,Phil and the boys tear it up in Germany....the band sounds tight...lots of great tunes..must have for Thin Lizzy fans...,1358553600,,120,5.05
3958420,5,B002N7W3QC,"I think toward the end of this concert that both the band and the audience were getting a little Burned Out.
Instead of calling this 'Are You Ready?',i would have called it 'Are You Still Out There?'
But be that as it may,here is my review for this dvd.
One of the greatest if not thee best concert out there featuring Thin Lizzy.
These dudes are kicking like there's no tomorrow.
Mesmerizing to watch them doing what they do best,i could literally hear everything that Brian Downey was doing on his drum kit,so you know the sound was perfect.
Also this has a rather Loud Music Menu.
Picture crystal clear,but even this version of the concert has those vid lines in it,which were from those cameras they used when filming this,there's no getting around it.
It is what it is and that's that.
I was a little worried and concerned that this was not going to play on my Sony DVR,which is my main DVR.
Because when i got it,it was riding lose in the case off the spindle and i thought,oh s***.
Many many scratches on bottom of disc,but miracles do happen.
This played through with just 1 stop point but freed itself.
I am so happy as this is 1 of my favorite rock concerts.
Both Scott Gorham and Snowy White are fun to watch.
This dvd came from Martinsburg,WV.i would recommend Thin Lizzy/Rockpalast,just not from WV if possible.",1352419200,,1324,4.4979253112033195
3958421,5,B002N7W3QC,"I've always avoided this Rockpalast gig because of the criticisms but having now watched it - it's brilliant. If you're into Lizzy buy it.  And for those knocking the performances on Emerald (which I don't agree with anyway), give them a break! They're on their 5th encore number and have been playing for just short of two hours! Highly recommended.",1340755200,,350,4.833333333333333
3958422,5,B002N7W3QC,"How can this be less than 5 stars?  Sure Snowy White is taking the place of iconic Brian Robertson (although Snowy is better its still not the original magical lineup) but goodness...this is clearly the closest to a full set we have available. The other great Thin Lizzy DVD set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Dangerous/dp/B000VFGQUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live & Dangerous</a>&nbsp;is a great purchase.... but what we have on that is two rather truncated sets ...one of about an hour with the original lineup and another short set with John Sykes in the guitar spotlight ...so this is the only true representation of a full Lizzy show...and its a very very good one!

I just can't see rating this any less than five stars particularly given the cheap price. Sure a perfectionist could find flaws at time with production or playing but its really pretty darned good. I've watched this DVD at least 20 times...so that says something ...I've got a huge collection but this one just calls to me...",1317513600,2,1047,5.378048780487805
3958423,5,B002N7W3QC,I love Thin Lizzy and I think that for what is out there to be had this is the best. Great line up of songs and Phil is at his best and the rest of the band is great. Sometimes the picture and sound could be better but its still great. This show is of the band not so much of the fans. Thats great to me because I just watched Stones at the park and I wanted to puke. Too many skinny hippies and not the Stones. I have seen many dvds just trashed because of that reason. We want to see the band not the fans! GET IT!,1310169600,,516,3.7
3958424,5,B002N7W3QC,"A definite must own for any real Thin Lizzy fan. I love it, and Phil Lynott is a beast! One of the greatest if not the greatest live band of all time.",1301788800,,150,3.71875
3958425,3,B002N7W3QC,"C'mon people stop being nostalgic for Phil. Snowy White & Scott Gorham are playing really badly on this DVD. Lizzy could always be hit or miss live, this is miss. GREAT song selections that are fun to watch, but I wince way too many times watching Snowy and Scott hitting bad notes.",1284163200,3,282,4.4423076923076925
3958426,4,B002N7W3QC,"Being one of the greatest live acts of the 70s/80s (and many, including myself, would argue all time), you can't go wrong with live Thin Lizzy.  Okay, there are a few exceptions but overall you can count on a product of high quality and showmanship.  I didn't really care for this concert upon initial viewing - Phil seemed too lethargic (although he does liven up about halfway in the set but we don't need to get into why...) and some of the songs didn't have the punch that they did in earlier recordings (""Emerald"" on this recording is very underwhelming).  But I gave it another chance and was very glad I did.  The material from the latter part of their career always did sound better live then in studio - ""Genocide"" and ""Hollywood"" are evidence of this.  And the keyboards would also become much more cloying and louder with the Thunder & Lightning tour.  This isn't Phil & Co. at their finest hour but they are still very good here.  ""Black Rose"" is always a pleasure, even if they didn't play the whole song - I don't think anyone but Gary Moore is capable of doing that though.  It's also fun watching Phil's interaction with the crowd during ""Baby Drives Me Crazy"" - in which the crowd surprisingly hangs with his vocal intonations.",1273449600,2,1244,4.547085201793722

3958428,4,B002N7W3QC,"Thin Lizzy live at Rockpalast was
recorded on the Chinatown Tour &
other than the sound quality this
shows what a great band they were
& what great songs they had. This
version gets slagged because of
Snowy White but I saw then in
New Orleans @ now long gone
famous Warehouse & they blew
the roof off! I think Chinatown
and Renegade were awesome albums
& got put down. I thought much
better than Thunder & Lightning.
The picture has a few flubs but
it's worth buying. I had many
versions before this came out
& it's good for the time shot.
If you like it look for bootleg
of Old Diminion Show Or Killers
on Loose DVD from collectors. I
think those are much better in
sound quality & have different
version songs. This is a must!",1268352000,2,728,4.244604316546763

8374807,2,B002N7W3QC,I am a huge Lizzy fan so when I saw this concert with Snowy on guitar I had to have it. This is not for a casual fan. The picture quality is pretty bad with horizontal lines running through it at times and the sound quality isn't any better. This concert is more suited for the die hard fans. Its a nice companion to The Live and Dangerous DVD which has far better picture and sound quality.,1461024000,3,391,4.090909090909091
8374808,3,B002N7W3QC,Probably would give it a 3 1/2 star if I could. Only allowed to give 3 or 4 star rating. Although at times it seemed they were going through the motions all and all a good performance.,1458432000,,184,4.0

8374815,5,B002N7W3QC,"when i first read of this dvd i was a little skeptic about it but boy i was wrong, this is just another live masterpiece by Phil and the boys covering their older classics from jailbreak to chinatown, renegade and black rose and night life. The band does a great live performance of genocide from the chinatown album. The sound quality on this is top notch and highly recommend this to any serious thin lizzy fan!!! and i must say that snowy white did a great job on this effort!!!",1376006400,2,481,4.355555555555555
