8550953,5,B00AFJW996,I bought this to get a copy of Commando. Which is one of Arnold's best films. And its on Blu-Ray so everything looks good.  Having Blu-Rays of Terminator and Predator to upgrade from my DVDs is a nice bonus.,1526601600,,207,4.3076923076923075
8550954,5,B00AFJW996,Some of Arnolds best films. Classic!,1443312000,,36,5.166666666666667
8550955,3,B00AFJW996,"This is a fun collection from 20th Century Fox with three Arnie films: Commando, Predator and The Terminator. Each film gets its own disc and some extras are provided. Admittedly most Terminator fans will want to own the deluxe version or box set of Terminator on Blu-ray. However, Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition BD ($15) was overrated. Commando got a bare-bones Blu-ray. You are still getting good value for your money if you like at least two of these films. If you don't own them on any format then this is an easy purchase. Budget-conscious fans will also appreciate this Arnie triple-feature Blu-ray set. These are 4 star films in a 3 star package.",1378598400,,656,4.814159292035399
8550956,5,B00AFJW996,"This set has some of Arnold's best movies. The films look top notch. Each movie comes in an individual Bluray.  The inscription of ultimate hunter edition verifies that each movie here is sold elsewhere at a higher price. If you want these on your collection, get this set.",1354752000,,273,4.6875
