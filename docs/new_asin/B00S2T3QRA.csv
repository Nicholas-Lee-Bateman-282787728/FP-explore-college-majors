I have purchased the entire 6seasons and love the stroll back to the days when tv westerns like W.E.,Gunsmoke and Bonanza tried to convey a sense of morals in their story lines. The transfer to DVD is very good both in sound and picture quality.",1438041600,,284,4.377358490566038
8697123,4,B00S2T3QRA,"I have all six seasons in my library and have now watched all of Season 4.  I have yet to catch up on the remaining two seasons.

Being an Australian I am not on top of American political history, but I note some underpinning political messages coming through.  Hugh's Earp character comes across as an ultra conservative who can readily compromise his Christian faith with the violence required to assert his authority.  The Doc Holiday character is far more creative when it comes to the interpretation of the law.

Overall, the plot lines for seasons 1 - 4  loosely follow the biography of Earp, whom by all accounts was more of an entrepreneur than lawman strictly abiding by the law and codes of justice. Overall, the show is enjoyable with Myron Healy's Doc Holiday shining through the episodes he appears it.",1434240000,,815,4.74468085106383

8697127,5,B00S2T3QRA,"These DVD+R discs are very high quality in picture and audio. I remember watching this series as a kid and, of course, taking it as gospel about the life of Wyatt Earp, completely disregarding the word ""legend"" in the title. Since then, I've learned quite a bit about the real man, and now know they stretched the truth about as far as it could go. That being said, this is still a highly enjoyable show. Hugh O'Brian is excellent and a wealth of character actors wander in and out of the episodes, sometimes playing one role and later playing something different. This was probably not so jarring back in the day when you could only see the shows once a week, but watching in chunks, it can be a bit disconcerting. For instance, in the first episode of season three, Doc Fabrique, Wyatt's friend from Witchita, comes to Dodge City for a vacation. He's played by the great character Douglas Fowley. In the very next episode, Fowley plays Doc Holliday, and in several episodes thereafter. At the end of one, he leaves Dodge for Denver. Some episodes later, he returns from Denver, but this time Doc is played by actor Myron Healy, billed as Michael Healy. Healy continues playing Doc in season four, but under the name Myron. Confused, yet? No matter. It's a classic of the Fifties, and they did manage to fit an amazing amount of the real life on Wyatt into it. It goes on my keep shelf.",1424736000,4,1387,4.52988047808765
