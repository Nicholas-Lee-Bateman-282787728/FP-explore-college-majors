8021374,5,B00023JLJQ,"The best 8 minute workout on the market.  The worst thing you can do is roll out of bed, get yourself together and go to work.  If you can't get in your regular workout, this one will get you right, your blood flowing, stretch your limbs, and all within [true time] about 13 minutes.

I've been using it for more than 10 years, and since my first one stopped working a few years ago, I keep an extra one around.  It's truly that impactful to a rushed day.  You can usually find it online for $5 or less.
