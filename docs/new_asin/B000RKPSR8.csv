8201144,3,B000RKPSR8,"If all you are interested in is collecting the films with no extras then this pack may be for you. It has value as long as the fifty-percent discount holds. However, realize that most of these films are not only single disc editions of films that are available in double-disc editions, they are also very old editions of these films. It seems to be an attempt to eliminate the overstock of the older editions that MGM/UA may be stuck with. The following is a film-by-film run-down on what you are getting and what you are missing:

West Side Story (1961)
What you get - This is the single-disc fullscreen edition. Why anyone would want to watch this film in fullscreen is beyond me.
What's available - There is a double-disc widescreen edition available as of 2003. The second disc has a 1-hour retrospective documentary containing Natalie Wood's original vocal recordings and interviews with the cast and crew, including Robert Wise and Stephen Sondheim, original film intermission music, restored and remixed in 5.1 surround, storyboard-to-film comparison, original release trailers and behind-the-scenes photos, plus production design and storyboard galleries. There is a collectible scrapbook that comes with the newer edition.

Midnight Cowboy (1969)
What you get - You get the single-disc widescreen version released in 2000.
What's available - There is a double-disc version that was released in 2006. The newer edition includes audio commentary by producer Jerome Hellman, three featurettes, and a photo gallery.

Rocky (1976)
What you get - You get the single-disc widescreen version released in 2005. This edition had some extras, but they are carried over into the current 2006 edition.
What's available - In 2006 a 2-disc edition was released along with multiple commentary tracks, a three-part documentary, and five featurettes that can only be found in the 2006 version.

Annie Hall (1977)
What you get - This is a single-disc widescreen 2000 version of the film, and there have been no updates that I am aware of. Woody Allen's films usually come without extra features, and this one is no exception.

Platoon (1986)
What you get - You are getting the single-disc widescreen special edition released in 2001. The extras on this special edition include commentary by director Oliver Stone and a documentary entitled. ""Tour of the Inferno"".
What's available - There is a double-disc widescreen edition available that was released in 2006 that is a 20th anniversary edition. The features from the 2001 release are carried over into this one plus there are new interviews with Stone, plus there are four new documentaries and a new featurette and an eight-page journal pamphlet included.

Silence of the Lambs (1991)
What you get - Here you get the 2007 double-disc edition, which is the latest and greatest made.

The films themselves are all excellent - I really like all of them. I just think if a studio is going to put together a best picture pack they should include the latest and best releases they have available, and this bundle doesn't do that. Thus my three-star rating.",1188518400,6,3093,5.052941176470588
