2025094,5,B0001US47U,"Fatih Akin is a marvel.
Since other reviewers have already provided you with a synopsis of the film, I prefer to compare ""Im Juli (In July)"" to other films by Akin that I have seen: ""Kurz und Schmerzlos (Short and Painless)"" and ""Gegen die Wand (Against the Wall)"".
Short and Painless was his first film, and it was him at his rawest.  It seemed to be a young director's dream film which included a little bit of everything that he's interested in.  I believe a lot in the film was autobiographical.
Against the Wall is a grown up Akin with a lot of pain and suffering.  I remember twitching in my seat in a few scenes and as usual, I was baffled by the excellent character build up.
In July is funnier and more relaxed than the other two.  I think it's a good intro to Akin's filmmaking, his extraordinary yet out-of-life characters and his great sense of humour and eye for detail & observation.
This film is highly recommended I can't wait till the DVD comes out!",1086566400,5,966,4.410112359550562
2025095,5,B0001US47U,This movie is amazing! It's my absolute favorite foreign film. It is a great movie about following your dreams and being spontaneous. I was very happy to receive it in pristine condition. There was absolutely nothing to complain about it was perfect and new just as it was labeled when I ordered it.,1388448000,,299,4.660377358490566
2025096,5,B0001US47U,"Great light hearted German film with unique twists, albeit predictable outcomes.  Good, positive film.  I've watched it several times, and I would recommend it for a date night if you both have an interest in German.",1386374400,,216,4.972222222222222

2025098,5,B0001US47U,I purchased this movie to improve my German.  Love the story.  It is about a guy who is very uptight but changes over the course of the movie.  It takes thousands of kilometers and three women to accomplish the task but it it pure entertainment.,1369440000,,245,4.4
2025099,5,B0001US47U,I initially found this movie at our library. We enjoyed it a lot and decided to own a copy. It is a great Fatih Akin movie. We often lend it to our friends. It is a happy movie with funny twists.,1359331200,,195,3.7804878048780486

2025101,5,B0001US47U,"In July

I remember a high school English teacher so enthralled with Julie Christie when Darling was first released, that she turned the film into a homework assignment: is Julie Christie the most beautiful actress you've ever seen?  I suppose things like that  happen quite often in cinema, although not to me.  But the con artistry Christiane Paul manages to exude in the beginning of In July is unforgettable and the question becomes - does her  encounter with math teacher Daniel Bannier (Moritz Bleibtreu) beckon substantially enough to maintain our interest during the rigors of a six country, two continent tour in and around unfamiliar locales not often placed on your day tripping tour guide? Short answer: You bet.

Director Fatih Akin has a plot that becomes a pilgrimage, with street vendors selling sun goddess rings, surrealistic pillows in moonlight, Yugoslav car chases and a Romanian cross border marriage without a passport.  Daniel is a willing accomplice throughout because, riding with Christiane and accompanied by a musical score by turns Andalucian, then Euro techno punk tinged with Asian hip hop, he will meet a woman, Melek (Idil Uner) in Istanbul under a bridge that separates Europe from Asia.  When Leo, a truck driver bound for Budapest, fondles Christiane too intently, it's a matter to marvel over how Director Akin stops the fantasy on a dime in order to signal real danger.  At the all clear, actress Branka Katic entices Daniel further with shakes and shovels in a manner that would give most people a bill for chiropractic services.  Akin himself plays a Romanian border guard not only surly but armed with the tiebreaker: a Russian AK.  Daniel and Christiane not only survive but thrive in a pastiche of color film shot under florescent light, and you know what that does to people with less than perfect skin tone. This film was a huge undertaking with multiple trans national film crews and I, for one, am ready for the sequel",1310947200,2,1966,4.945288753799392
2025102,5,B0001US47U,"Romantic, funny. I've been watching Fatih Akin's films lately and they're all great. He's a real story-teller, unlike many ""serious"" directors, who leave you with nothing. He reminds me of Luc Besson, in that respect (that's high praise).",1304294400,,238,5.2894736842105265
2025103,5,B0001US47U,"I saw this movie in my German class three years ago, and I absolutely loved it. I'm not going to summarize the plot since many before me has already done it. What I'm going to say, however, is that the movie is funny, touching, interesting, innovative, and instructive. The latter is due to the fact that the protagonists travel across Europe. A story of a guy who falls in love without even knowing/noticing it, and a girl who learns that, at the end, one cannot force love, as the time comes when one has to let the chips fall where they may.",1295913600,,544,4.3431372549019605
2025104,4,B0001US47U,"Fatih Akin is one of the best and brightest directorial voices working in Europe today, and while this early film isn't quite as strong as his more recent masterpieces, it's still a sweet, funny and worthwhile love story.  On the surface it's a very familiar romantic comedy plot - the misadventures of guy searching for girl he thinks he loves, while missing the fact that the perfect girl is right beside him.  But it's so charming, with a fun, playful, inventive cinematic style, a great soundtrack, and terrific supporting characters that it's easy to forgive any clichs and a few moments of overacting.  A film that will make you smile.",1275868800,3,641,4.8090909090909095
2025105,5,B0001US47U,"German language (English Subtitles)
I have only seen one horrible Moritz Bleibtreu movie and I won't mention it here. Suffice it to say he is a fantastic actor and deserves more acclaim over here on this side of the pond. This is a very good heartfelt story of a man and a woman getting all mixed up in something they should not be and together working their way out of it. It is not a high action movie, instead it is a nicely paced story that will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. That is European cinema for you. They dabble in subtly and not explosions and lasers.

The road trip spans much of Europe and into the eastern block countries. There are some great scenes, but my favorite has to be the river jump.

All in all if you are a fan of German cinema you owe it to yourself to get this movie for your collection.

Thanks for reading my review.",1272326400,,866,4.204819277108434
2025106,5,B0001US47U,The dvd arrived right on time. Quality is great! If I had to choose I would do business with this merchant again.,1253923200,,113,4.181818181818182
2025107,4,B0001US47U,"Turkish-German director Fatih Akin says he was inspired by Shakespeare's ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" when he made this film, which is fair enough, but Hollywood road movies like ""It Happened One Night"" more easily come to mind as you watch this unlikely story of quarreling travel companions destined to fall in love. And this is the flip side of two pretty heavy coins - Akin, who is better known for his ""Head-On"" about the desperate lives of Turks in Germany, and German cinema itself, not often known for light-hearted romantic comedy. Yet, most of the time it works. It's sexy, funny, and fairly full of surprises, as our callow young hero, who after a one-night unconsummated tryst with a stranger, follows her from Hamburg to Istanbul. And tagging along is the more adventurous girl truly smitten with him (opposites in this case attracting true to formula).

Suspension of disbelief is in order from beginning to end, but most of the time you say ""what the heck"" and go along with it. It's classic, as Akin says in an interview. The hero must go on a quest to kill a monster, which in this case is within himself - his own timidity and suppressed emotions. A movie that's really more for the young at heart, it's probably a little too tame for real 20-somethings.",1227830400,2,1269,4.716216216216216
2025108,5,B0001US47U,"I like it very much, and it has it good parts. I like the part that when Daniel tries to jump Danube river with the car when you know he is not going to make it. This a good romance comedy. A german language must have movie",1227312000,,223,3.765957446808511
2025109,4,B0001US47U,"I'm giving this movie 4 stars for two basic reasons. First, the adventures of the characters trying to get to Turkey seem a little too drastic. It's hard to imagine someone being robbed of everything and still being able to complete the journey. Second, some of the plot points seem a bit abrupt, especially the resolution of all the storylines at the end. It has a happy ending, but it seems like it all falls in place within 2 minutes. Those two things being said, I did like the movie. There is a little rough language and a few light drug scenes, but nothing raunchy. The storyline is interesting, has a somewhat surprise ending, and is somewhat edgy. While I wouldn't say it's the best movie I've ever seen, it did leave me with a good feeling all in all.",1218758400,3,760,4.435714285714286

2025111,5,B0001US47U,"Of the ""road trip"" style of movies this is probably the best I've seen.  It is the story of a hapless science professor, Daniel (Moritz Bleibtreu), receives mystical advice from a street vendor that he will find his true love wearing a star.  In a mix-up he has a fantastic one night stand with someone wearing a star, and decides to find her in Turkey.

Thus begin his travels and the discovery of his true love (his travel companion for a while).  While the outcome for Daniel is know from the beginning of the film, the fun is in the journey.

Here the movie really shines.  It never takes itself seriously, nor does it become a a movie of ""one liners"".

For me, the movie works on multiple levels.  One can enjoy the (mis)adventures of Daniel's journey to Turkey, or follow the coutry side, or follow the director's images capturing Daniel's experiences, or follow the ""Road less traveled"" hiding beneath the surface, or enjoy the amazing acting of Bleitreu, Christiane Paul and especially Mehment Kurtulus.

I can watch this movie over and over and never tire of it.",1184544000,11,1071,4.654255319148936
2025112,2,B0001US47U,"I was disappointed with the movie. I foremost ordered it because I wanted a movie in German, not because of the actors in it. It was German alright, but that was about all I liked. So this schoolteacher goes to Turkey to follow the girl of his dreams and all sorts of bizare things happen to him on the way. This spontaneous girl Juli accompanies him on the way and wants him to fall in love with her instead, which of course, he eventually does. Storyline is okay, but the whole movie is just a mess. The director tried too hard to make it hip, modern and fun, that somehow it simply is not. Christine Paul just doesn't fit the part she's playing, maybe it's her age, maybe because she never seems to get comfortable with her part, and Moritz Bleibtreu really isn't that cute and one never gets the chance to really like any of the characters. It ends up being a mess one watches from the distance. I was glad when the movie was over an I am not planning on watching it again, so if anyone wants my copy, let me know.",1175040000,2,1018,4.225641025641026
2025113,5,B0001US47U,"I was skeptical of watching a film with only German subtitles but talking to a cousin who lives in Germany I was convinced to purchase this movie.

I was amazed at the quality of the acting, this movie has a great storyline always going different directions with things not always being as they appear. Christiane Paul is so cute and fits the part so well you are always rooting for her. I'd recomend this movie to everyone!",1159315200,4,424,4.5064935064935066
2025114,4,B0001US47U,"Endearing German comedy `In July' follows the fate of one bespectacled timid math teacher Daniel (Moritz Bleibtreu), who finds a true love on the road to Turkey. Actually, he has already found it in Hamburg where he lives and teaches - her name is Juli with whom he travels (played by charming Christiane Paul) -- but too innocent Daniel just cannot realize that.

Part road movie, part romantic comedy, part slapstick action, `In July' is free from formulaic structures of Hollywood-made romantic comedies. Like `another European comedy `Black Cat, White Cat' the film is about the unstoppable energy of Daniel and Juli and those whom they encounter while traveling in Eastern Europe. The film may look inconsequential to some, and perhaps it is so, but `In July' is still a feel-good comedy with a healthy doze of romance against the background of cross-cultural experiences.

Moritz Bleibtreu is very good (as always) at playing a character who finds himself in the wrong place as in `Run Lola Run', but the true star of the film is Christiane Paul as free-spirited and independent Juli who leads the shy Daniel into the place where he as ordinary teacher would never dreamed of entering. Equally impressive is the `crazy' girl Luna played by beautiful and sexy Branka Katic, a van driver who guides Daniel into a seedy caf in Budapest.

Not everything succeeds, it is true, and Daniel's innocence often looks too implausible, but `In July' is more charming than irritating. Director Fatih Akin's story is patchy and sometimes impossible, but the film is refreshing and appealing nonetheless.",1158796800,7,1595,5.034090909090909
2025115,5,B0001US47U,"In July is one of the movies that I can watch over and over. I will not cover the plot, since reviewers before me did a good job at it.

I would not consider this film a sappy melodrama, and I did not find it annoying like some love movies are. It is very lighthearted and kind. It tells a story of following your fate, finding your love, and of traveling across Europe without a penny in the pocket. In fact, it does not concentrate on love, although it is the premise of the film. You can just watch it as an adventure movie with many funny stories and situations. The actors do a good job playing their parts, scenery is cool, there are a few fancy and scenes with a trendy camera work, and the soundtrack is wonderful.

It is a typical quality European film. I hope you enjoy watching it.",1138233600,17,792,4.203947368421052
2025116,5,B0001US47U,"There are very nice allegories in this movie. Daniel, as the physicist that he is, lacking essential social abilities. needs to be enlightened. More like our average ""I do my job, don't care about the rest"" modern day type. Everbody has his/her own inner journey, Isa (Jesus), Daniel the (old tastement) scientist, Melek (Angel) and Juli (July) throughout the trip to Istanbul from Hamburg. And yes,follow the sun, as it has been proven to work already...A very good humane point of view that we have  forgotten for some decades due to unjustified arrogance.. As he himself, Fatih Akin, the director of the movie and writer of the scenario emphasizes in a somewhat joking way, and it is most probably true that, ""if Sheakespeare were to live today, he probably would do such work"". If you think you are up for some good romance and commedy, go for it. I would recommend this as a DVD for a romantic date too:-).",1133568000,9,911,4.69375

July (Christiane Paul) the pretty girl selling the item tells him he will soon meet a woman wearing the same symbol. She will be his one true love.

July plans to be that true love, but Daniel bumps into someone else first wearing the sunburst symbol on her tanktop. She spends one night with him before leaving for Istanbul. He decides to pursue her and as fate would have it, July inadvertantly joins in the journey. And so the romantic adventure begins.

This is an absolutely fantastic film. Beautiful cinematography, wonderfully infectious music, great storyline and three beautiful girls. Besides the two actors already mentioned I want to also credit Mehmet Kurtulus and Idil Uner for their first rate supporting roles.

A necklace suddenly changes all of that, and he goes on a wild ride to Turkey. This is definately good stuff from Bleibtreu. He does a lot more acting in this than Run Lola Run.

Take a chance and have a fun night watching this movie.  Much better than some of the garbage that passes itself off as ""hip and edgy"".

2025121,4,B0001US47U,"I first saw Im Juli (In July) my first month living in Germany, and it has been one of my favorites ever since.  It is a light-hearted lark of a film, meant to replicate and expand on the contrivances of the Hollywood romantic road film.  And director Faith Akin brings to the genre his own (distinctly European) sense of humor and whimsy.

Moritiz Bleibtreu and Christiane Paul as the film's leads are delightful - they play off each other with an easy chemistry and create winning characters for whom you cheer.  The supporting characters are equally as likeable and altogether unusual for a romantic comedy, the difference that sets Im Juli (In July) apart from it's Hollywood counterparts.

If you're looking for a fun film and don't expect cinematic genious, Im Juli (In July) will satisfy your inner ham quite nicely.  Considering the decidedly heavier offerings from Germany (Europe Europe, Wings of Desire, Big Girls Don't Cry, anything by Fassbinder), Im Juli (In July) is a treat.  Along with Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, The Princess and the Warrior), Faith Akin is one of Germany's most delightful and innovative directors.",1099699200,5,1132,4.926315789473684
2025122,3,B0001US47U,"Let's see...

Characters: wow... next to no development here at all, and VERY hard to believe.  Daniel, a straight-laced, risk-aversive teacher who in only a few days is transformed into a car-stealing, dope-smoking, free-wheeling and carefree dude, who'll do it all for... love!  Yeah... right.  Juli (named after the German name for the month of July), a supposed free-spirited, worldly gal with hippy braids, and anything-goes mentality who just HAPPENS to fall in love with this guy named Daniel, and comes across as almost virginal, being inexperienced at spooning, despite having hitch-hiked across LARGE parts of Europe with strangers.  Geez...

Plot: I really wanted to like this movie, and it was better than ""Sleepless in Seattle"" but only marginally.  Plot was WAY predictable (it was like a PG-13 version of ""Something Wild"" with Melanie Griffith).  I tend to like European movies a bit more than the normal ""Hollyweed"" products in the states, but this one seemed to aspire to and happily achieve all the cliches that ""Hollyweed"" seems to revel in.

Acting: VERY cardboard-like defined characters, and acting to aptly suit those characters.  Bleibtrau is capable of much more, so it was kind of disappointing to see him so underutilized here.

All in all, not a terrible movie, but it just seemed WAY too predictable and uninspired.  No boundaries pushed here, and if you like your movies that way, then you'll probably like this as well.",1099353600,,1450,5.0974576271186445

Daniel has planned to stay in Hamburg over the summer sitting in solitude on his balcony reading books about physics and listening to jazz while everyone else is leaving for an exotic vacation.  A boring stiff could sum up Daniel's persona before he met the street vendor Juli (Christiane Paul) who has fallen in love with Daniel.  Juli urges Daniel to buy a Mayan ring with the mark of a sun from her as she reveals for him that the love of his life will be wearing a sun.  Juli is scheming a love trap for Daniel as she invites him to a street party, however, Daniel is unaware Juli's affections for him and instead meets meets Melek (Idil ner), a beautiful Turkish girl, as Juli is late to the party.

Melek needs to find a place for the night and she is flying to Turkey the next morning.  However, she unveils that she is to meet her beloved under the bridge at Bosphorus strait that divides two continents.  After Daniel has dropped off Melek at the airport he realizes that he must go to Istanbul in order to meet her under the bridge.  When Daniel begins his journey he sees a hitchhiker whom he picks up, and it is no other than Juli who has decided to escape her sad loss of Daniel by travel.  This is the beginning of a long journey for Daniel as he is forced to leave his secure little world and do a lot of things that he would never otherwise have done.
In July is a wonderful love story that offers much laughter and entertainment as the audience probably can relate to the feelings of both Daniel and Juli.  Most of the story is told in a flashback as Daniel tells his tale for a mysterious man with a corpse in the trunk, which adds a level of suspense to the film.

2025124,5,B0001US47U,"I'm writing this review because I would like ""In Juli"" to get the attention it deserves. I saw it in New York about 2 years ago. It literally was shown for 3 days and then completely disappeared. I know no one who saw it, or even heard of it,and that is a shame.
  ""In Juli"" is a comedy, a mystery, a road story and it has fabulous scenery of eastern and southern Europe. But, best of all, it has the most romantic line, I've ever heard in a movie - we'll it's at the top of the list, along with all the best ones you've heard. I won't say what it is, you'll just have to buy the video.
  The acting is splendid, my favorite one being Christianne Paul playing Juli, the lead female character. She is beautiful, smart and knowing and has a terrific smile.  Moritz Bleibtreu plays Daniel, the male lead and it is wonderful watching him transform to someone who is basically not present in his life, to someone who can have adventures, fall down, get up and fall in love. The acting, overall, is excellent and as the story builds, you end of liking and routing for all the characters.
  One of the many levels the movie is about is having to travel and have experiences that ultimately help you grow and change, and finally be able to see that the real love that you are looking for is right in front of you - you just need to be open to see it.",1087862400,23,1342,4.178294573643411

8016530,4,B0001US47U,"Romance, adventure, and exposure and symbolism; these are the elements that are embodied in Fatih Akins  Im July. As in any other Romantic Comedy, or Rom-Com for short, the protagonist Daniel Bannier finds himself smitten by the gorgeous Malek and goes to great -and at times humors- lengths to achieve his goal and proclaim his love to her. With his secret admirer Juli by his side, Daniel ventures out to Istanbul Turkey to the Bosphorus bridge where he will eventually find- or rather recognize- his true love. Daniel is able to experience another world outside of his heimat and is thus forced to leave his comfort zone of the familiar and boring life that he has so far faired as a naive and unconfident teaching apprentice. Daniel is forced to become a real man via his newly found exposure to a cosmopolitan way of life.
Daniel found Malek by following the sun sign on the ring that Juli gave him; although ironically Juli gave it to him so that he would find her at the party, not Malek. This moment of dramatic foreshadowing allows the audience to start focusing the rings symbolism as its meaning, purpose, and effects on the characters serve to catalyze Daniels cosmopolitan exposure and resulting character development. It starts with Julli selling the ring to Daniel as a flirting point . She wants him to follow the sun symbol to find her and even though that doesnt work out as directly as she would have prefered it to, following the sun did bring Daniel to start is international chase for finding his love. Following the sun allows one to see their path clearly and that is exactly what the ring does for Daniel...eventually.
Sometimes the path that a person must go on is not the ideal one. Daniels encounter with Luna was far from pleasant, for she pretends not to speak German and leads him into the suspicious underground life where he is drugged and robbed. While drugged Daniel becomes semi aware of his feelings for Juli. Luna the lunatic tries to steal Daniels light. In stealing his ring she is fulfilling her role as the chaotic darkness (as represented by the moon) and is destabilizing Daniels life. This upset by this insane foreign girl  forces Daniel to fend for himself and fight for what he truly wants which is to find Juli, from whom he is separated from, and also  pushes him to steal his property back -something that he would not have done if he were still back home .
The concept of home and heimat is inexplicitly explored through Daniels cosmopolitan trip. The sun eventually led Daniel to see that his love was with him the entire time but it took him through foreign lands of Hungary, Romania, Turkey and then back to Germany. It introduced him to its opposite the moon and experiences of uncertainty, loss, and betrayal only to at the very end bring him to find his true love Juli was there from the beginning -but why would Fatih Akin create such an experience for this good German man? It can be argued that Daniel is representative of Akins impression of German culture. Germany, as personified by Daniel, is inexperienced, intelligent, stale, and in need to find a clearer path so that they may find the unfamiliar parts of themselves to love.
Germany is used to ethnically homogenous people living as one in their own heimat. Juli leads Daniel to leave his heimat and he is exposed to his Turkish love interest and explore the outside cultures. After his journey he is no longer weak and he [German culture] benefits from the exposure and in turn develops as a more complete person [culture]. At the end of the journey, it would have been hard to believe that it had been a wimpy and socially awkward Daniel that encountered one of the craziest women in film history, stole a bus and a car, attempted and failed to car-jump a river using physics, and escaped from jail. His journey to follow the sun pretty much had him travel hundreds of miles, cross rivers, and move mountains. Daniel would not have become the complete man that he his without having transcended borders (Eren, 175) and experienced life outside of himself. Im July is a film that argues in favor of the positive influence of cosmopolitanism can have on German society  through the journey and positive character developement of Daniel Bannier.",1447286400,,4263,4.7028112449799195
8016531,4,B0001US47U,"Fatih Akin, a auteur in German Turkish filmmaking, delivers with Im Juli (2000), a film that's impact is felt across Europe. This love story is more than just a romantic comedy; it is a quest for identity in a fluid cosmopolitan world.
 All in all, the film is lighthearted and pleasurable. The film, stars Mortiz Bleibtreu and Christiane Paul. Daniel (Bleibtreu) is a German school teacher, and Juli (Paul) is a German shopkeeper.  Juli attempts to make Daniel fall in love with her, but her plot is foiled when her efforts instead make Daniel fall for a Turkish woman named Melek. This leads Daniel to travel across Europe to Istanbul in search of Melek, with Juli accompanying him for much of the journey.
 As the film progresses, it takes many twists and turns that invite viewers question their preconceptions about the characters. Each time the viewer is surprised by a character's actions, a new facet of their true identity is revealed. In this way, character development in Im Juli is thorough and dynamic throughout the entire film.
 Im Juli is a Romcom/Road Movie that invites viewers to enjoy themselves, though not before fundamentally separating its events from reality.  A considerable amount of suspension of disbelief is an absolute requisite for proper enjoyment of the film. There are many coincidences that are nothing short of ridiculous. There are many non-realistic events that are pivotal to the plot. The volume of ridiculous events and Hollywoodian clichs might be overwhelming to some, but to the viewer who is willing to set aside all notions of probability for the sake of a good Romcom, this film will certainly do the job.

 The film does have real-world cultural implications, but no obvious agenda. It portrays a Europe as an environment of cosmopolitanism hybrid culture. For instance, while traveling to Istanbul to meet Melek, Daniel makes his way across Europe. The relatively fluid border-crossing that occurs in the film presents Europe as a connected, borderless world. Outside of the positive illustration of this type of environment, the film feels not so much like a social or political comment, but more like a silly romantic adventure for enjoyment rather than analysis. However, Fatih Akin brings the film to the table with far-reaching cultural impact wrapped up in a charming romantic comedy. Im Juli is not just a quest for love and identity; it is an adventure through a cosmopolitan Europe that embraces the pleasures of hybrid culture.",1446595200,,2487,5.0512195121951216
8016532,4,B0001US47U,"Fatih Akin leaves the audience with a cosmopolitan view of the world, in his intriguing romantic comedy: Im Juli. The film follows a young teacher as he journeys across Europe in search of his dream girl. Little does Daniel understand, the girl of his dreams was closer to home than he ever imagined. Through an extensive and draining journey, Daniel learns what it is he truly desires.

One has to keep in mind that this movie was not made in Hollywood. Any scene that depicts Hollywood is thrown in on purpose by Akin. It is not a corny recreation, rather an ironic smirk at the industry itself.

Fatih creates with objective. He imagines a world, where a single person can travel from country to country with little to no restrictions. In the movie, Daniel loses his passport, and is still somehow able to journey from Germany to Istanbul. The film establishes that the world is one large community tied tightly with a shared morality, where people support others regardless of their heimat.

The strongest feature of the film would be the comedy. Time and time again, the film will infuse jokes and trouble to create a more likable and entertaining movie. Relationships are also built through comedic scenes. For example, Daniel and Juli share a joint while stowed away on a boat, and the result is a fantasized perfect date.

All of Akins objectives are clearly portrayed in the film, making it a strong and heartwarming movie. Whether you are spectating for studies on cosmopolitanism, research on Turkish-German cinema, or for pure entertainment, it is sure to be fulfilling.",1444608000,,1582,4.869888475836431

Title of Film: Im Juli  Director: Fatih Akin  Year: August 24, 2000
Disclaimer: To avoid spoiling the plot, read only the first paragraph
In Im Juli, Fatih Akin takes the trope of a road trip movie and truly turns it on its head with the wild hijinks that both the somewhat-titular character Juli (Christiane Paul) and the male lead, Daniel (Moritz Bleibtreu), experience. When the adorable Juli finally works up the courage to talk to her crush, both her own and Daniels lives are irrevocably changed. But, as always, its the journey that matters. And what a ride it is: crossing five nations, robbing a drag racer, fighting a trucker, even indirectly helping to smuggle a body across a border. Im Juli kept our rapt attention the whole way through due in no small part to the witty dialogue, competent acting, and cute storyline.
What kicks it all off are the women that Daniel meets. Both Juli and Luna are symbols of the sun and moon respectively. Juli represents both a new day dawning for Daniel and her name implies the warm, sunny month of July. Luna on the other hand implies the madness of the moon and Daniels experiences with her take him to a dark place of inebriation and loss, both of his memory as well as of his passport and wallet. Additionally, the film opens with a solar eclipse in which both the sun and moon are involved, thereby establishing the celestial imagery in the film.
What most intrigued us about the film was attempting to understand the tremendous forces of will required by both the main characters to continue on with their journeys despite one another. Because both Daniel and Juli care so muchalbeit for wildly different reasons: Daniel, to do something stupid and spontaneous for love; Juli, to make the man of her dreams love her backthey clash to often either hilarious or touching conclusions. We deeply appreciated, incorrigible sap that we are, the motivations behind both of the characters actions with their lofty goal simply being the transient and nebulous notion of love. We found it at first difficult to rationalize either Daniels or Julis actions but in retrospect and after deliberate introspection, weve concluded that given the opportunity in the right circumstances, we might do just the same thing. That is why we found the minds of the two main characters so interesting: while fictitious, they are so very real.
Im Juli most closely resembles a prototypical romantic comedy. As we all know, romantic comedy films are films with light-hearted, humorous plotlines, centered on romantic ideals such as that true love is able to surmount most obstacles. While containing elements of both the road movie and adventure film genres, Im Juli is about the romance between Daniel and Juli and how it is both achieved and expressed throughout the film. It is not about the thrilling chase sequences, breathtaking vistas, or even the obstacles, though all of these things serve to accentuate and heighten the overarching romance through which Fatih Akin proposes his cosmopolitan ideal for the world",1444608000,,3090,4.928982725527831

It's about a road trip that in the end brings together boy and girl.  As such, it could have been an interesting movie, but the script is vacuous and the directing unfocused.  I'm putting this one into the give-away box.",1398297600,,345,4.516129032258065
8016537,5,B0001US47U,"We enjoyed this movie!  Having see the director's work before (Head on! or Gegen die Wand) we weren't sure what to expect except that it would probably be unexpected and it was!

The characters are all having their own little trials and tribulations, some in their minds and some in interactions with the world around them. The few main characters and many minor characters become intertwined in hilarious and strange ways.

Per normal, many of the characters are Turkish-Germans and at least part of the movie takes place in Turkey. I believe the director wants to film some part of Istanbul in every film, perhaps.

This film is well worth watching. We enjoyed it immensely. We watched it in German with English subtitles. We speak a little German but not enough to watch without subtitles. As usual, the subtitles don't always give an exact translation but they were pretty well done and easy to read (sometimes subtitles are NOT easy to read).

I'm sure we'll keep looking for more movies by director Fatih Akin, who often surprises, but never disappoints.",1397260800,,1060,4.866666666666666

It is definitely a chick flick, but one that even my classmates and I could enjoy. I recently showed this movie to my girlfriend, and it instantly became one of her favorite movies. I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone who wants a fun German film. Also it's another film that Moritz Bleibtreau really shines in.",1395705600,,479,4.853658536585366
