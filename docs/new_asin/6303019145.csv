7834459,3,6303019145,"Frank Capra was a visionary or else just used by the government to produce this series of seven tapes to motivate Americans we had to fight in the major war in 1943.  Now, sixty-five years later, it was used as the basis of an award-winning documentary to justify the following yearly battles throughout the world.

The introduction was by then President Eisenhower in his January, 1961, farewell address to the nation. He was my president -- the first I remember in my youth. He was a great strategist. Other former presidents whose image and words the producers used include Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Reagan, Clinton, and both Bushes. Truman was shown explaing the two bombs, which were dropped on 8-6-45 and 8-9-45; he was trying to take credit for USA developing these weapons of mass destruction. He inherited the already finished product, as they were developed and perfected during FDR's administration. As a general, Ike was against the use of American bombs. He wished the bomb had never been developed. He may have been just a military man, but he did possess some wisdom, which was lacking in Truman.

Eugene Jurecki wrote the commentary of this production when it was not using direct quotes from others. In 1991 the collapse of the #1 superpower, Soviet Union, gave America the power we wanted and needed to police the world. War was promoted to young aspiring (and poor) men as using common sense (or is it self defence) in shooting first. Many, many did not live to enjoy the benefits they were promised for ""protecting"" our country.

In wars, you kill ""object,"" not human beings. From a helicopter, they are just spots on the ground to shoot from above. Like the little black bear, Cubby, it was inhumane to shoot and kill when the other person has no place to run. They are portrayed as evildoers who have no right to live. We had the 'intelligence services' explained as flowback, information kept from the American public throughout all the wars and the years. It makes the president of this great country feel like a God, as the commoners pay with their lives. We lived wondering if ""they"" are right and not lying to us. American kept on an agenda of economic colonialism.",1158105600,,2191,4.773087071240106
7834460,4,6303019145,"This video brings to mind my first days in training during
WWII. In basic training in 1944,we were marched weekly to a base theater where these films were shown to us to explain why we were there.  I never got to see all of them, because I was shipped from one branch of the Army to another and each time I got just so far into the series and was transferred to another base. I remember there was some opposition from mothers that we were too young to see such violence and blood-shed and I recall that I thought,""How stupid. If we get sent to the front, we'll see a lot more than these black & white films."". I was very glad
to pick up a set last year. I am trying to find another.",1008979200,8,682,4.051851851851852
7834461,5,6303019145,"This series of films was created by the US War Department to appeal to Americans' commitment to the War.  These are not documentaries, and it's not fair to rate them as such.  Successful War propaganda has to vilify the Enemy, ennoble the Allies, evoke compassion for the victims, arouse patriotic zeal, and exhort to battle and sacrifice.  This series accomplished all of that, thus it earns my five star rating for achieving its primary purpose.  ""Why We Fight"" has modern historical value in its archival black-and-white film footage.  Some of this is rarely seen elsewhere!  Particularly fascinating are the segments on the rise of the Reich in Germany, the invasion and defence of Russia, and the bombing of London.  Also enjoyable is the quaint, fervid narrative style, so remniscent of 1940's newsreels.  Films such as these helped convince the American public we had to get involved in another terrible war.  The freedom of the world depended on it!",992476800,15,957,5.006329113924051
