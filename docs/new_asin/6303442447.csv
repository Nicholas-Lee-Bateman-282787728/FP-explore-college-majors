644380,5,6303442447,"I love this movie.  I have watched it many times.

I just wonder why Tim Allen lives alone in a big house - - I would expect him to live in a nice apartment or condo.
I guess it wouldn't make sense for Santa to fall off of his roof if he lived in an apartment building.

I also wonder - - the adults don't believe in Santa - -
So, how is it explained when toys are found under the tree and no one knows who they are from?

Also, when Tim Allen shows up at the North Pole as the new Santa,
everyone accepts him, and no one misses the old Santa or cares at all what happened to him.
We can assume that the other Santa worked there and lived there for a very long time,
but no one cared at all that he was gone.",1513296000,,708,3.7315436241610738

645990,2,6303442447,"This movie had a strong ""written by a bitter single divorced dad"" vibe.  Tim Allen plays a high ranking exec who is childish and petty towards his wife's new husband, a psychiatrist (""not a real doctor!"" - Tim Allen).  Tim makes funny faces and noises while the psychiatrist is generally a fairly reasonable person in the few appearances we see.

Then Mr. Allen accidentally startles Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, leading to the death of the jolly old elf.  He assumes the duties of Mr. Kringle and even goes back to the North Pole at the end of the evening, presumably after delivering untold numbers of presents.  The next day he attempts to gaslight his son into thinking it never happened.

Meanwhile, Tim Allen begins to gain weight and act erratically at work whilst Mom and Dr. Stepdad Psychiatrist are concerned that their son is claiming his father is Santa Claus (which really wouldn't be that shocking if someone were to say that in an elementary school classroom, I might note).

Finally they get a judge to say that Tim Allen can't have any more visitation but Tim Allen is a dick and kidnaps their son to go deliver presents.  They, justifiably, panic.  Tim Allen is arrested and goes to jail, which makes no sense because he has previously demonstrated a plethora of magical powers but now he cannot escape from jail.

A team of SWAT elves rescue Santa Tim Allen after assaulting a police officer and causing havoc in the neighborhood.  Tim makes peace with Mom and Dr. Stepdad by giving them gifts that Santa was supposed to give them back when they were younger.  They accept these gifts in lieu of their son's safety and the son goes off to deliver presents with his Santa Father.

A persistent theme of the film is nepotism as the son openly says that he will become Santa Claus some day.  This is not possible according to all the laws of the movie unless the boy is plotting to slay his own father.  Either way, not a good message.",1483142400,,1952,4.585014409221902

646431,4,6303442447,"Some people may not call it this, but for me, ""The Santa Clause"" is a Christmas favorite. I have seen it at least ten times and it is one of my traditions to watch it at least once during every Christmas season. It's a very funny film, and Tim Allen manages to deliver some of his very best and funniest lines ever, which do not deserve to be spoiled in this comment. It's also a very original and engaging story; a divorced dad must take over the job of Santa after the real Santa falls off his roof, but first his son has to help him warm up to the idea. That being said, I admit that it's not a perfect film (ex: Tim Allen's son is kind of bratty), but for a movie like this I'm willing to settle for less than perfect. Few family films are this funny for kids and adults alike. Tim Allen makes more hilarious wisecracks here than in any other film I have seen him in. Seeing him go from a sarcastic divorced father to a loving Santa Claus is a very touching story, and the concept of a ""Santa Clause"" (a contract to become Santa) is completely original. If you haven't seen this film, watch it this Christmas. This is a real treat. I have seen it enough times to know, and I still enjoy it every year.",1482624000,2,1205,4.131914893617021

It is a harmless romp, unless you are triggered or upset by the divorce and custody subplot. That could upset some, not me.

There is also the death of a Santa clause early on, but handled in a comedic and cartoon way.

So, yeah, maybe not fit for everyone but I find it funny, charming, silly, cute, and maybe more than a little heartwarming.",1481846400,,420,4.358974358974359

My favorite thing about this movie though is that it is appealing for audiences of all ages, not just kids. It isn't overly dumbed down and ""kiddie"" as so many family movies can be (and unfortunately the sequels of this movie, in my opinion). It is funny, smart, and charming. We watch this movie every Christmas, and I highly recommend others to also! :)",1457481600,,521,4.381443298969073

There are just so many great movies but the classic family ones are my all time favorites with out a doubt. I have shared them with my own kids growing up and now I am sharing them with my grand kids. I remember watching them when I was younger and I am so happy to have them on Amazon so I will not lose them, no figure prints and cleaning them and they can never break. I can watch them anywhere with the kids on my laptop with my Amazon. This is great for the vacation nights when it is time to settle down. I buy all my movies this way now, they take up no room in the house, no finding the wrong movie in the case, there are so may benefits this way.

This year, I got to share the Santa Clause with one of my daughters, who just crossed over the magic threshold in life of understanding sarcasm.  Other than Home Improvement, this movie is by far the best work Tim Allen has ever done, in my opinion.  The dialogue is a little ""off"" but the story itself and the funny takes on the character are sweet and timeless.  If I had to pick a favorite scene, it would have to the introduction to the North Pole...the innocence and soft colors make you think of warmth and comfort.  So does that amazing sleigh bed!  I have two more daughters to watch this movie for the ""first time"" with and I can't wait to hear what they say.  When I first watched the movie I bought a sleigh bed.  My daughter asked me, after the movie, if Santa was hurt during the fall off the roof or if it was just make believe.

We are not frequent purchasers of DVDs, preferring to rent so they don't ""clutter"" our home, but the entire family decided they wanted to have this on hand.  It's enjoyed by adults and children equally.  Tim Allen plays an excellent Santa (if you like Tim Allen--you most definitely see his personality infused into the character), and the supporting cast is just as strong. If your kiddies don't believe in Santa Claus anymore this just may make them rethink their judgment!

652833,5,6303442447,Love The Santa Clause...,1450137600,,24,5.25
652834,5,6303442447,"Yes, I'm fully aware that this is a cheesy film, packed to the gills with sentimentality and glitter.  Do I especially care?  Well... yes and no.  If anything, Christmastime is the one time of year when I actively seek out a cheesy, sentimental movie.  Who wants a gritty and depressing Christmas movie anyhow?  I want something full of the holiday spirit, just real enough to be ""believable"" but still with that Christmas magic to it, something to entertain both the child and the adult in me.  ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Elf,"" ""Miracle on 34th Street""... all these fit the bill in my opinion.

And of course, ""The Santa Clause"" fulfills that requirement as well.  It's a funny and heartwarming movie that has just enough wit and humor to poke some fun at its own cheesiness, but is also a warm and heartfelt story.

""The Santa Clause"" tells the story of Scott Calvin (played by Tim Allen), a businessman who neglects his relationship with his young son Charlie and halfheartedly attempts to give him a memorable Christmas when his ex-wife drops him off for the holiday.  When Scott accidentally spooks a mysterious visitor -- Santa Claus himself -- into falling off his roof, he discovers a mysterious card hidden among his clothes instructing him to put on the suit.  At his son's urging, Scott reluctantly complies... only to be whisked off to the North Pole, where the elves inform him that by putting on the suit, he's committed to a contract that requires him to take Santa's place.  At first Scott dismisses the whole thing as a hallucination -- until he finds himself gaining weight, growing a beard, and having a massive ""naughty and nice"" list delivered to his house.  And as his ex-wife, co-workers, and even the legal system grow convinced that Scott has lost his marbles, it's up to Charlie and the elves to convince Scott that he's Santa Claus, and perfect for the job.

This film was one of Tim Allen's first film roles, and he proves he's capable of a film role as well as a regular sitcom role -- he's not just funny, but brings genuine emotion and heart to his role as Scott Calvin, a character who gradually warms up and sees change for the better over the course of the film.  Charlie's actor is phenomenal as well -- too often child actors are either wooden or overact to an absurd degree, but he's neither, bringing genuine emotion and dialogue to his character.  Minor characters in the film are just as well-rounded and ""real"" -- it would have been all too easy to vilify both Scott's ex-wife and her new husband, but they're realistic characters who have Charlie's best interests in mind, even if they think Scott's mentally unbalanced.  And Bernard, the head elf at Santa's workshop, brings delightful snark and banter to a North Pole that could easily have been turned into a saccharine candyland.

The story has some fun with the typical conventions of Christmas movies, mythology, and traditions, and for that reason it can be enjoyed by all ages.  Efforts are made to modernize some of Santa's trappings (such as his sleigh, suit, etc.), but not in a manner that feels out of place or forced.  And the film doesn't shy away from how becoming Santa Claus affects Scott's life -- it plays some of it for humor, but it does show the negative affects as well, and how Scott adjusts (or fails to) over the course of the story.

But this is still a Christmas movie, and despite some moments of sadness and drama, it's playful and warm at its heart.  While there are some jokes that are obviously aimed at adults (though the worst one was cut from the DVD release), it's still a good family Christmas movie, one that's both heartwarming and isn't afraid to poke a little fun at itself.  I'd consider it a Christmas classic... so long as you ignore the sequels, which are both lackluster and unnecessary in my opinion.  Recommended for ages 8 and up due to some crude humor.",1450051200,,3892,4.656432748538012

653967,5,6303442447,"This is the best one out of the trilogy, no doubt. I have nothing against the other two, they actually kind of grow on you after awhile. My honest opinion though is that the sequels were not needed. As a kid, I was okay with the story ending with this as a stand alone film. I understand why the makers wanted to develop a deeper story and add some of the Santa Claus myth, but it wasn't needed. I don't ignore the sequels but I also don't feel I need to put them on my shelf to complete a the story. If I wanted to watch the sequels, then I would just watch them on ABC Family.",1446768000,,578,3.948717948717949
653968,5,6303442447,"First off, I've always liked Tim Allen. I remember watching Home Improvement growing up (you know, when they actually had good family shows. Example, TGIF. If you're in your mid-20's and older, then you'll know what I'm talking about.) and when I first saw Sant Clause, I loved it! It's in my top ten Christmas movies. A wonderful and funny, family oriented movie. My family and I watch this not just during Jolly season, but also after (and after the football games) we stuff our mouth with turkey, mashed potatoes, corn bread, stuffing, and pumpkin pie. Anyway, BUY THIS MOVIE! Oh, and I didn't run into any problems with the blu-Ray version.",1446768000,2,644,4.758928571428571

657626,5,6303442447,"Arguably the best of the Santa Claus movies, this one was a classic from the time it first came out.  The music is superb (I love the a cappella -- voices only -- version of ""Carol of the Bells"" that accompanies Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) from work to his home on Christmas Eve at the beginning of the movie.  And that's not the end for this good soundtrack, far from it, in fact.
  With comedian Tim Allen as the main character it is not only funny, it's also touching in many places.  The story is wonderful and, coupling that with the good acting, the beautiful FX and scenery (nice job with Santa's workshop), and the new twist on how Santa manages to find a replacement -- and you have a gem, a movie that has everything going for it.
  The sequels are good too.  All in all, it's the total package; I only wish there were more of them.",1419724800,,839,4.232704402515723

This first 'The Santa Clause' film (and in my opinion, the best film from this franchise) is quite magical, a cute story for children and adults alike, fun, and the CGI is Fantastic!  We watched this film on Christmas Eve when it first came out and from there on out, it became a staple in our home on Christmas Eve evening when our children were younger.  Now they are grown and some of them have children of their own, yet this film, through a few changes from video/dvd/blu-ray, still remains a staple after all these years as our grandchildren (our children, and ourselves), sit snuggled beneath warm fluffy throws on Christmas, watching the magic of Santa Claus enter all of our imaginations once again!

Item exactly as discribed
Arrived in excellant condition",1389744000,,131,4.5
660089,5,6303442447,No one in town sold this on blue ray.  This is my sons' favorite movie and a must to give with their new Blu-ray,1389571200,,112,3.6666666666666665
660090,1,6303442447,I guess I ordered two copies and was surprised to open the package to find two. I only needed 1.,1389571200,,96,3.85
660091,5,6303442447,"So, there are three movies in this trilogy and this is by far the best and as an adult, the easiest to sit through multiple viewings of if you have small children that tend to find a few favorites and want to watch them constantly.  The quick and dirty synopsis of the plot is that Scot Calvin (Tim Allen) is an executive at a toy company, divorced with a young son who is doing well, but has kind of lost his way when it comes to the spirit of Christmas.  On Christmas Eve his son wakes him because of a racket outside and they discover Santa on the roof.  Startled, Santa takes a tumble off and after Scot puts on the coat & hat the adventure begins as he takes the reigns as the new Santa.

The movie itself is fun, cute, and of course... safe for kids.  It's got a little going on for adults as well, but the target audience is absolutely kids.  My 10 year old will sit through it without protest and the 3 year old really likes Santa, the elves, and of course the reindeer.  It's no Home Alone, but if you are looking to round out your more recent Christmas classics, this is a title worth owning.

If you're looking for one of the best, not really kid safe Christmas movies... pick up a copy of ""The Ref"" as well and watch it after the kids go to bed.  You can check out a quick review on that title as well in my profile.

Hope you had a wonderful holiday and that this review helps you decide if this is a title worth owning.",1389571200,,1433,4.085714285714285
660092,5,6303442447,"Such a sweet sweet movie.  Tim Allen was perfect.  The relationship, interaction and facial expressions between he and Judge Reinhold are enough to completely satisfy in a comedic level.  This is a timeless Christmas Classic.  Even though I own the movie, every time it's on tv, I still watch it and I am entertained every time.  Well worth the $10 for a family to invest in to provide their children with happiness and laughter.",1389398400,,429,4.743243243243243

660216,5,6303442447,"Santa Clause has always been easy to overlook: especially given the awful, awful sequels and the campy mid-90's feel that permeates the entire film. However, Tim Allen gives a great and believable performance in his Home Improvement prime days, and the Christmas 'feel' and general Santa universe set up in the film stand up. Not many films allow for a perception of Santa as mortal but magical.

This film is great for kids, but has enough subtle humor to keep everyone interesting. Note though, that the original '1-800-SPANKME' joke is edited and gone from this version, though present in the original film cut and the VHS release.",1388880000,,634,4.925233644859813
660217,5,6303442447,"A great holiday movie.  One of Tim Allen's best roles. It is good for children who still believe in Santa and for parents that try to keep the joy of Christmas alive.

Yes, I know every line in the movie but it's just not the same when all you're hearing is ""garble"" because you are not able to process (due to severe hearing loss which even hearing aides will not help with if you're watching TV or the Kindle) what's being said.

Of the 3 ""Santa Clause"" movies this one's the best and most touching.  Tim Allen became famous for Home Improvement on TV but this movie made him a superstar.  Worth seeing no matter what your age.  It's also worth noting that this was one of the first comedy films to try to deal with the realities of family relationships after divorce.  The handling of the topic is thoughtful and tasteful without being maudlin.  Not just a holiday movie, it was also a marker designating changing sensibilities.",1388448000,,618,4.783018867924528

Well, the VHS player is gone so it was time to move on and the DVD, of course, is a much better quality where the picture and sound is concerned. I know there are some critics out there who find the movie silly and stupid, but it all depends if you enjoy a little fantasy or not. I do and this one certainly fills the bill. Tim Allen, by the way, is great as the Santa and I was happy to see that the story continued with 2 more sequels. I love them all!",1356739200,,630,3.968503937007874

There was nothing objectionable in the movie, which is so refreshing these days.  Both kids ""still believe"" and this movie served as an argument in favor of the presence of Santa Clause that was neither saccharine nor cutesy.  The awe on their faces and the gasps when Santa fell off the roof...as well as their appreciation of such plays on words as the ""Rose Suchuk Ladder Company""...made us smile!

It's a funny and family-friendly story with a different take on the traditional Christmas fare. There's enough adult-focused humor and kid cuteness to make it tolerable for parents, and enough magic to charm the younger viewers.  Tim Allen was a surprise (back in the day) in this role -- funny throughout, he is completely believable as the absent father, and yet somehow turns it around to portray a very believable and caring Dad.  Certainly helped by the great supporting cast, most notably the adorable Eric Lloyd!  The subsequent movies were not so great -- most notably (infamously?) the third one.  If you like the first one, and haven't seen the others, save yourself the time.",1355616000,,809,4.798561151079137

663403,2,6303442447,"""The Santa Clause"".  I remember this movie coming out in 1994 and really wanting too see it in theaters, but I couldn't, so I had too wait till the VHS came out in 1995 to see it, and it has been an annual viewing since.  And for my review I'm just going too say that the movie itself deserves a 5 out of 5 rating - the reason for the 2 out of 5 above is mostly for the Blu-Ray itself.

I've had the third Santa Clause movie on Blu-Ray for about 2 years now and it really looks good, so I was excited when I heard that the first two were making their Blu-Ray debut.  Unfortunately, these are discs that were produced fast and without the care required.

On the Santa Clause 3 English audio was provided in both LPCM and Dolby Digital 5.1, for the first Santa Claus Disney went with what sounds like the same mix that was used for the 2002 DVD, but encoded it in DTS-HD 5.1 instead of Dolby Digital.  The picture quality of the few scenes I looked at appeared too be about as good as the 2002 DVD when my PS3 up's it too 1080p. (The picture on the 3rd movies DVD and Blu-Ray is a lot sharper and clearer on the Blu-Ray.)

Bonus items: nothing new here and, in fact, Disney dropped one bonuses.  The bonuses consist of ""So you want To Be An Elf?"" (a fun little behind the scenes look at the making of the film that doesn't go into great depth, and is from the 2002 DVD, and it's presented here in 480p, but at a bit rate topping out at 11 Mbps), the 1933 Silly Symphony cartoon ""The Night Before Christmas"", which, on the 2002 DVD was a hidden bonus that was unlocked by beating ""Santa's Helper"" Trivia Game (which is not present). ""The Night Before Christmas"" also knocks the bonuses down quite a bit because instead of using the High-Definition transfer that was made for the ""More Silly Symphonies"" DVD set from the Walt Disney Treasures line, the Disney people decided to use an old tape master as the source, since you can see the edges of the Silly Symphony logo having that tape crawl that came from early NTSC tape transfers.  The last bonus is the Wolfgang Puck collection of Christmas baking videos that were also on the 2002 DVD.

That just leaves the menu of he disc.  The 2002 DVD had a full motion menu that was of Charlie' house with the car in front in a snow globe in front of a Christmas Tree, and there was even a button on the menu too ""shake"" the globe and get snow falling.  On the Blu-Ray you get nothing like that.  The menu just has a static picture  of the cover picture.

All in all I would recommend the 2002 DVD over the Blu-Ray.",1350777600,5,2556,4.198364008179959

Nowadays we have a new series of films vying for that position; some are animated and some are goofy. However ""The Santa Clause"" brings the Christmas wonder and an overt perennial message.

Scott Calvin is divorced. He will have custody of his son for the Christmas holiday. They are both a little awkward with each other as they now live in two different worlds. Something tells me soon this will change. As Scott puts his son to sleep reading Clement Clarke Moore, they hear such a clatter. This is where you can hear us gasping whatever you do don't go out and look. But he goes out anyway and there he surprises a jolly old man which causes the man to slide off the roof. Scott rushes over to help the man sees a card and reads it but forgets to read the ""Santa"" clause.

663811,5,6303442447,"Christmas movies about Santa Claus are a special breed. They all take a few (or all) of the following ingredients, and mix them up into a fun little Christmas flick:

* Helping Santa deliver gifts
* Santa being a real person or made up, and the need to prove he's real
* Santa representing the Christmas spirit
* Chillin' out with Santa up in the North Pole (with wacky hijinx)

The Santa Clause is one of these family films that do a little bit of everything, in a very endearing way. Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) is a busy executive at a toy company, who doesn't really have time for anything other than work. On his way home from a Christmas party, he makes up stories as to why he's late to meet his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd), ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson), and her new husband Neil (Judge Reinhold) on Christmas Eve. After complaints of being stuck with dad, Charlie finally lets his mom leave, and Scott and Charlie proceed to fail to make Christmas dinner. Bedtime arrives with a reading of ""The Night Before Christmas"", and Scott shows a small bit of love towards his son and tucks him into bed. In the middle of the night, a huge commotion occurs in the house, and the two run outside to see Santa falling off of the roof and landing in the snow. Due to The Santa Clause (with an 'e' for you legal types), since Scott was the one who tried to help dead Santa, Scott is now Santa Claus (Scott Calvin/Santa Claus - SC, get it!). The rest of the movie deals with Scott trying to take over as Santa, both in role and physical shape, and the effects it has on both his family and professional life.

I really enjoy this movie as a holiday classic. Tim Allen's role as Santa is fantastic, with both his quips to his family as well as the children he meets his first Christmas as Santa. This movie came out around the time when Home Improvement was on TV, and even though you can see bits and pieces of ""Tim Taylor"" throughout the movie, Tim Allen did a great job in making a separation between his famous role, and his role as Santa here. While Wendy Crewson's mother role was weak, both Eric Lloyd and Judge Reinhold worked wonders with their role. You can truly feel Charlie's love of his father, and how much he dearly wants to hold on to the Santa belief. Judge Reinhold's acting style comes off extremely fitting in his role as a father/psychiatrist, in both trying to deal with a family, and a step-son who he feels has Santa issues.

There are two major life issues this movie handles EXTREMELY well. The first issue is divorce/separated families. All of the actions in this film in that regard, are shown in a civil manner, with the parents never fighting over Charlie, or making him feel out of place or unloved. This is always nice to see in films, especially as someone who came out of a divorced family with two parents who always treated me properly.

The other issue is Santa Belief. Obviously as we've all gotten older, we've stopped believing in Santa Claus. Christmas turns into a time of family and love for most of us, and we realize that the gifts we've always gotten were from the ones who truly care about us. When movies come out, they usually tread (or cross) the fine line of making Santa still seem real, or flat out saying that he's fake. This movie, even with Tim Allen taking over Santa's role, would still let a child seeing this movie believe that Santa is the dude that flies over the world in one night, dropping off presents for the good kids and coal for the bad ones. I HIGHLY applaud this in this film, because a child's beliefs are for them to keep or lose, and not to be taken by a movie trying to make a point.

Overall, this is one of those ""Watch ever year"" Christmas films that will leave you smiling at the end of the night, remembering back to your childhood fun of leaving milk and cookies for Santa, and not being able to sleep because of all the sweet presents that were coming your way.",1279670400,,3933,4.380821917808219

Starring Tim Allen, THE SANTA CLAUSE will make you laugh, make you cry, and help you remember the true meaning of Christmas.  You WILL believe in Christmas magic.

Tim Allen plays Scott Calvin (S. C., hint, hint), a divorced father doing his best to celebrate Christmas with his son.  In typical fashion, Scott is late picking up his son,  the turkey catches fire in the oven, they end up at Denny's for Christmas Eve dinner...overall, a complete disaster.  Later, as they read The Night Before Christmas, they hear a sound out on the roof. They run outside to investigate, startling Santa, who falls off the roof.  Scott tries to help Santa and ends up putting on the Santa suit to keep warm.  However, there is a Santa Clause on a card in the pocket of the coat...he who wears the suit becomes the next Santa.  Scott and his son end up in the sleigh delivering presents, and then at the North Pole meeting the elves.  Of course, no one believes them the next morning, and even Scott thinks it was all a dream.  But the Santification process has already begun, and eventually even Scott has to believe...

Tim Allen is just excellent as both Scott Calvin, a toy company executive who has lost his way and as Santa Claus.  His transformation from one to the other is perfect:  his sense of shock and disbelief vanishes as learns the joy and magic of actually being Santa.  Tim's performance is warm, genuine, real, and very believable.  You want this to be real, and you want Scott Calvin to be Santa.  You feel happy, joyful, and uplifted.  The supporting cast is all wonderful, and the elves are just terrific.  The sets and effects comprising the North Pole and Santa's Workshop are just right.  They make you believe, which is the whole point.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SANTA CLAUSE for the entire family.  We watch it several times each Christmas, and love it every single time.",1230163200,,2060,4.6115702479338845

663997,4,6303442447,"'The Santa Clause' is a Disney movie centered around the Christmas season. Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) is a single parent with a son Charlie (Eric Lloyd).  Scott is a toy salesman for a large toy manufacturer. When Charlie's mom Laura Miller (Wendy Crewson) and step dad Dr. Neal Miller (Judge Reinhold) drop Charlie off at Scott's home for Christmas Eve dinner, they tell Scott that Charlie does not believe in Santa Claus. All of Scott's attempts to provide a good dinner fail, and Scott and Charlie end up at Denny's for a Christmas Eve Dinner. Charlie is awakened by a noise on the roof, and when Scott and Charlie go outside to investigate, they find Santa on the roof. Santa slips off the roof and is killed from the fall. While looking for identification, Scott finds a business card on Santa. The card states that Scott must take over for Santa. The reindeer take Scott and Charlie on the appointed rounds, delivering toys to the girls and boys, before ending up at the North Pole. Bernard (David Kurmholtz), the head elf, explains to Scott that when he put on the Santa suit he became the new Santa Claus, because of the 'Santa Clause'. Over the next year, Scott loses his job as a toy salesman, gains weight, and grows facial hair that turns white.  Director John Pasquin attempted to inject comedy into the sensitive subject of believing in Santa Claus. Trying to make a movie for all ages is especially hard when the subject is Santa Claus. I believe the use of the police in this movie was not the right approach for a children's movie, because children are instructed from early on in life that police officers are their friend and present to help them in a time of need, only to be further confused by the sight of their friend taking Santa Claus to jail on Christmas Eve.  The animation of the reindeer was superb. The fact that Charlie's step dad, psychiatrist Dr. Miller, wanted a weenie whistle for Christmas was one of the funnier parts of the movie. My opinion is that this movie rates on the low end of the Disney collection. I do believe, do you?",1222560000,,2066,4.563342318059299
664118,4,6303442447,This was the best Christmas movie i have ever seen. It is great for kids of all ages. I saw it when i was little and I loved it and 10 years later I still love it. The special effects and great you can not tell that he did not gain 45 pounds. The acting was great from Allen and Reinhold. It was a little stale from Crewson and Loyd. The movie is a short 90 minutes and it is about a divorced dad who accidentally kills santa and puts on the suit and delivers the rest of the gifts. Little does he know now he is santa. Withen the next year he grows a large santa sized pot-belly and a white beard. Which is great to watch. He then has his son taken away from him because his son thinks he Santa. It has a predictable ending but all around a great movie.,1221782400,,754,3.9025974025974026

As a skinny middle aged man, and allergic to milk isn't the best Saint Nick, though his sleigh riding  son, Charlie encourages him to do Santa's work.
While Charlie's dad choses to ignore the Santa experience, calling it a dream, Charlie knows otherwise. His obsession leads to troubles for dear dad. A judge prohibits him from seeing Charlie, causing some tears, and awes!
 Disney films and tears are almost always one in the same.

He has the twinkle in his eye that I ""know Santa has"",:) I think he's amazing and the point of all the movies, especially the first two is to get in touch with the ""adult"" who no longer ""Believes"".  Christmas is one of my favorite holidays, because it's a time to reflect, a time to give, a time to remember why we do whatever it is we do.  Tim Allen's Santa Clause movies are holiday ""classics"" in my home, because they help to remind us that we should never stop believing in the miracle of giving.  God gave us the most beautiful, awe inspiring gift that I can imagine when he sent His Son to us and I think it's awesome if a movie can help us to remember the importance of what Christmas is really about!!!  Yes, I know there may not be any specific dialogue related to the Christ child, however, when people get in touch with their hearts and remember that Christmas is about family, about love and the miracles we see everyday...then that's a movie that moves me and keeps me ""Believing!"" in the goodness of humanity. I had to buy another copy, because I let someone borrow mine and I guess they liked it as much as I do.  It's a wonderful movie.

I noticed that in the picture of the box the cover of the movie sparkled. I thought it was so pretty and I like the movie so I decided to buy it. Well about 5 days later I get it in the mail and I open my package and notice that the cover of the movie doesn't sparkle. I am so disappointed because I feel like the pictures up on Amazon are very misleading I thought I was getting one thing and I got something else.

The special effects aren't great but acceptable for this type fare. Overall a fun movie for the whole family. If you enjoy comedies you will probably enjoy it. The DVD is good quality and includes a few extras. I also like the fact Disney didn't force me to watch the previews or ads telling me it's wrong to buy illegal DVDs.

664305,4,6303442447,"Disney struck gold with this story about a man who becomes Santa Claus when the previous Santa Claus has an unfortunate accident.  Tim Allen is in one of his best roles, the script is generally fun and heart-warming, and kids seem to love this one.

Scott Calvin is a toy company executive.  As seems to be a standard in many movies, Scott is divorced and only gets to see his son periodically; Christmas Eve is one of those visits.  After burning a turkey and heading for a thrilling meal at Denny's with all the other divorced fathers (note the stereotype that only fathers do not know how to cook), Scott reads ""The Night Before Christmas"" to Charlie before bed.

Scott awakes when he hears a noise on the roof.  Thinking burglars, Scott runs outside, only to see a fat guy in a red suit on top of his roof.  Scott yells at the guy, startles him and the guy slides down and falls off the roof.  Unfortunately, the guy apparently seems down for the count.  Scott searches his pocket for identification and finds a card indicating the bearer is Santa Claus.

The next thing Scott knows, the man in the red suit is gone, leaving the suit behind.  Scott can only do one thing; he puts the red suit on.  Scott spends a whirlwind night globe-trotting, and ends the night at the North Pole speaking with Bernard the Elf (David Krumholtz, who was perfect for the role, just as he is perfect as Charlie Eppes in ""Numbers"").  Bernard explains to Scott that by putting on the Santa suit Scott has invoked the Santa Clause, meaning the Scott will henceforth be the new Santa.

When Scott wakes up the next day he wonders whether he had a dream.  Of course, we know better and soon Scott will as well.  Indeed, Scott suddenly puts on a lot of weight and seems to be capable of growing beards almost instantly (and capable of generating more than a few laughs).  Scott also has a very difficult time explaining his behavior and appearance to anyone, most especially his ex-wife Laura Miller (Wendy Crewson, ""Corrina, Corrina,"" ""Air Force One,"" and ""Eight Below"") and her new husband Dr. Neil Miller (Judge Reinhold, ""Stripes"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"").  While the movie becomes somewhat predictable at this point, it is funny and enjoyable to watch.  I most particularly enjoyed the end of the movie, which Disney managed to pull off in a very serious and sincere way.

This movie does contain a few scenes that could be difficult to explain to very young children, perhaps ages 5 or 6 and younger.  This film should be suitable for most other family members.

Disney has only a few Christmas movies that are fun, funny and heartwarming.  ""The Santa Clause"" is a worthy addition to Disney's family film library and the Christmas movie genre.  I recommend this movie to fans of Christmas movies and to fans of Tim Allen.

and Allen's performance is so poor, that there is no magic, only astonishment over the lacksidasical way the characters confront things
that normally would be awe inspiring.  The sets are also quite cheesy and uninspired.  The ex-wife and boyfriend also come off as ridiculous and artificial.

664407,3,6303442447,"At Christmas, everyone needs the love and support from their families, as this movie showed so well. It was more about Jack Frost, the King of the Chill, than Santa outside the domestic situation. Jack, played skillfully by Martin Short, was a gay big phony with freeze-dried hair -- atyled like some young people wear theirs today. He was a manipulator, a jack of all trades, but mean and nasty as a conspirator to take North Pole away from Santa and his elves. Jack appeared to be happy as a lark, but he changed and turned into an ogre out to sabotage Christmas. When he was mad, his face turned blue.

Parts of the movie were like a dream but the Workshop was a place full of secrets. Santa worked miracles to clean up Jack's antics. Don't sweat the small stuff. Don't even think about it, Jack. Don't know who he is anymore. It's too late to make amends now. Jack was just a big imposter, but Santa got retribution. The problem seemed to be ""Was it worth it?"" No more secrets, Jack -- this isn't funny. A magical hug warms his heart and the spell is broken.

Ann Margaret looked just as she did twenty-five years ago. Spenser Breslin who played Curtis is turning into a star of major proportions. The big star, of course, was Tim Allen who was marvelous in this film as he was in the other two. The baby made a debut as the movie ended as it began.",1162684800,,1353,4.322834645669292

He resists for a while, but as his physical body begins to change into the likeness of the Big Guy, he is forced to deal with the truth.

When Santa dies after falling off Scott Calvin's (Tim Allen) roof Scott follows the directions in Santa's coat pocket and inadverently becomes subject to ""the Santa clause."" Now only Scott and his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) know who the new Santa is. Troubles soon follow as those around Scott think he's ""lost it,"" especially his ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson) and her new husband Neal (Judge Reinhold).

Can Scott, I mean Santa, convince an unbelieving world that he's the new bearded fat guy in the red suit, or will he be deemed a crackpot and lose parental visitation rights to his son?

This is a great movie that should become a Christmas viewing tradition in every family. I consider this to be Tim Allen's signature role and little Eric Lloyd is adorable as Chalie Calvin. The chemistry between Father and son is sure to bring tears to your eyes.

There are also excellent performances provided by David Krumholtz as Bernard the head elf and the enchanting Paige Tamada as elf Judy.",1135468800,4,1262,4.775229357798165

664443,4,6303442447,"Although there is a few crude moments in the movie, which may be questionable for chidren, overall it is a fairly fun and enjoyable Christmas movie for the family. Scott Calvin accidentally causes Santa Claus to fall off the roof on Christmas Eve, and, when he decides to put on his suit, he becomes Santa. He has one year to get thing settled, and then must return to deliver gifts to all the children.

Scott is trying to bring some Christmas cheer for his son Charlie, but he has no idea that all this is in store for him.

 There are plenty of quick one-liners for Tim Allen, as he tries to explain away why his son is suddenly calling him ""Santa Claus"" ( a funny scene is when the kids introduce their parents and what they do for a living at school). Another great scene, as mentioned by other reviewers, is the one where Scott burns the turkey and winds up in Denny's (""the American Institution"" as he calls it) with all the other fathers who have also burned their dinner.

Scott at first does not believe or accept his role as Santa, but as he learns more from his visit to the North Pole, and as he starts to put on the pounds and pyscially become Santa, then he feels obligated to take on the role. He also tries to patch things up with his ex-wife and her boyfriend.

Sure, you probably can predict the ending from a mile away, but that really isn't what this film is about. It is just about being a fun film and delivering a good message about Christmas. I suggest if you haven't seen it to check it out.",1134691200,3,1517,4.2717770034843205

Basically, this is a wholesome, kid-centric family film about a harried, divorced ad executive (ably and wittily played by Tim Allen)who wants to win the affections of his estranged son, Charie (Eric Lloyd).  On one disastrous Christmas eve, Allen gets snookered into standing in for Santa Claus.

Kids will just eat up this film, as Charlie gets all his wishes fulfilled, the family patches things up, and he gets Santa as his very own dad.

Adults will find Charlie just awful, alternately bratty, petulant, pathetic, whiny, and smug.  Despite that, they will still enjoy the film.  The Christmas Eve in Denny's alone is worth the price of the video, and there are cute little homages to everything from James Bond to John Knox!  Peter Boyle also has a great supporting role.

For no conceivable reason, Allen snipes with his ex-wife's new beau, Judge Reinhold.  It is unclear why either man would want the anorectic and rather dull Wendy Crewson, but, heck, you have to take some things on faith at Christmastime, right?  Besides, Allen's running commentary on Reinhold's egregiously ugly sweaters is worth attending to.

So, yes, don't expect THE BISHOP'S WIFE, or MIRACLE on 34th STREET, but order CLAUSE, pop it in the DVD player and settle back for some fun and laughs and a good family film!",1133222400,3,1551,4.877862595419847

Santa falls off Scott Calvin's (Tim Allen) roof, so he has to take over the position (albeit reluctantly) when he puts on the suit (having not read the fine print).  Along the way you run into Scott's ex-wife (Wendy Crewson), his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd), Charlie's stepfather Neil the psychiatrist (Judge Reinhold) (he stopped believing in Santa Claus at age three when he didn't get his Oscar Mayer Weenie Whistle--yeah, that explains a lot!), and many fun elves, including Bernard (David Krumholtz--currently starring in CBS's Numb3rs).  It is a great cast, especially the child-like elves, many of whom are actually at least 1,200 years of age.

The plot is engaging, and very family friendly.  Don't analyze it too much, as you may wonder at some points why things don't get explained further--but hey, it isn't supposed to be an air tight court case here, just a fun movie!

The extras are fun, though not long, they definately make a great addition.  You get to see the documentary ""So You Wanna Be An Elf?"" in which Bernard the head Elf, trains a new crop of workers, including telling them about the filming of the movie where ""Santa had to lose a few pounds to play his alter-ego Scott Calvin.""  This mood carries over into the Wolfgang Puck mini-cooking shows (three of them) in which we see Wolfgang and a group of helpful Elves make Pizza (Santa's favourite after too much milk and cookies), Christmas cookies, and hot cocoa.  Recipes are also included as typically the shows don't list ingredient measurings.

664506,4,6303442447,"Here we are once again! It's the usual time of the year when the holiday themed feature films are out in full force, flooding multiplexes across the country for the Thanksgiving holiday and going into December. And it seems work as usual for the Walt Disney Company with their release of The Santa Clause, but what makes this project unique is the concept it uses, one that has never fully been developed on the big screen before. The feature is also unique in that it stars Tim Allen, who is best known for his hit television show, Home Improvement, on ABC. Does that mean an automatic is lying in the waiting to flock to theaters for Allen's flick? Not necessarily. Granted there are people who are die hard fans who will love the actor/actress for whatever work they do but for others, they are pretty critical of television stars who believe they can easily make the jump to the big screen. Can Allen pull it off? Only the holiday box office will tell.
The story centers around a man who goes from being divorced, self-centered business man to possibly the most care-free, charitable man on the planet, Santa Claus. Scott Calvin works for a toy company, has recently divorced from his wife, and is stuck on Christmas Eve with his son, who is just as excited as his father is being together for the holidays. Once he tucks his kid into bed for the night, Scott hears a noise on the roof and goes to investigate. When he tries to confront the man on the roof, he falls off and when Scott encounters him, the mystery man is dressed like Santa Claus. He and his son enter the sleigh and the puts on the Santa suit, all thanks to the urging of his son. When the sleigh returns to the North Pole after a long Christmas Eve, Scott discovers that he is the new Santa, thanks to the Santa Clause, which is a contract stating who ever puts on the suit becomes the new Santa Claus. He notices physical changes like the color of his hair and his weight but soon he notices that he feels more and more like Santa on the inside. The story for The Santa Clause is quite possibly one of the most original holiday films in years, which is surprising considering the concept is such a simple one that it is hard to believe that it has never fully been attempted before. The feature does a wonderful job at mixing comedic elements with emotional values, which is hard to do at times. The Santa Clause defies that and presents how it can be done right.
The film revolves mostly around Tim Allen's character and generally that is all that really matters for the film but at the same time the character can be ruined if he doesn't interact with supporting cast members. Fortunately this doesn't happen here or at least not very often. Allen is marvelous in his role as Scott Calvin aka Santa Claus. He successfully translates the comedic magic he had on his television show and amplified it ten times. There is also a lot of emotion behind scenes that he has with his son, Charlie. David Krumholtz, who plays Bernard the head elf at Santa's workshop, is quite possibly the most enjoyable highlight of the film. He work extremely well with Allen as the two are able to play off each other in several moments within the film, that if they had been performed by anybody else would have been flat. The character of Charlie, Scott's son, is moderately played out by Eric Lloyd. Lloyd begins to get pretty annoying and whiny as the film progresses but then again what can you expect from a cute little kid?
Overall, The Santa Clause, just like the big man himself, spreads holiday magic to every boy and girl, nobody how young or old they are. It is such an original concept, one that hasn't been seen and may never be seen again for many years. Though there is much to praise the film on, there are also slight things to pick at. The messages that the film tries to convey, though meaningful and expressive, came off as being too forced. It would have been better if the filmmakers had slowly sunk the ideas in the heads of movie-goers rather then what they ended up doing. And, as was stated earlier, Eric Lloyd came as being too cute and annoying at times in the film but this is something that doesn't necessarily mean anything major, just a small squabble. Make sure to avoid the tacky holiday films like the remake of Miracle on 34th Street and make it your duty to catch The Santa Clause instead, which is sure to become a new holiday classic for the entire family.",1079395200,2,4448,4.465601965601966
664507,4,6303442447,"I heard about The Santa Claus movie a long time ago, but was never motivated to see it until after purchasing the sequel, which appeared even more family friendly than the first. You will definitely want to see them in order, but there are a few slight moments of objectionable content in this first movie, while I'll mention in a second.
PLOT: Scott Calvin is a divorced father, an executive of an advertising company, and getting set for a Christmas time visit from his son. Little Charlie isn't thrilled to be with his *other* dad for Christmas, especially when Christmas dinner equals Denny's. Charlie awakens Scott in the middle of the night when hearing thumping noises on the roof. Scott steps outside and hollers at the perpetrator on his roof - and looks on in stunned disbelief as a red-suited figure comes tumbling down. Scott finds a card in the fellow's pocket saying ""If something should happen to me, put on my suit, the reindeer will know what to do."" Climbing up on a magic ladder, Scott finds himself face-to-face with eight not-so-tiny reindeer...and one long night's work. He finds himself at the North Pole at the end of his journey, where head-elf Bernard irritably informs Scott that, according to the Santa Clause (the clause in the contract, as stated in microscopic text on the card he removed from Santa's pocket) he's the new Big Guy himself. Scott is returned home in disbelief, and must decide whether or not to accept the job ... all the while in trouble with Charlie's parents when Charlie tells them the tall tale of the North Pole visit.
GOOD POINTS: With a few exceptions, most of the humor in the movie is clean and humorous. And, again with a few exceptions, the whole movie is family-friendly, and a great holiday classic for everyone to sit down and watch.
BAD POINTS: There's a lot of discussion about whether or not Santa Claus is real. Charlie doesn't believe at first, and when he does after visiting the North Pole, his other father Neil attempts to dissuade him by raising numerous objections as to how Santa could do that. Neil and Charlie's mother Laura discuss the times they stopped believing in Santa. There's also some potty humor found in such things as Scott passing gas early one morning. Scott also hollers at a neighbor that he usually sleeps ""butt-naked"". During his first night taking over for Santa, he isn't very nice to one young girl who wakes up to see him, and grumbles about passing out the other gifts. There's also several ""Oh my god"" exclamations. Most of these ""bad points"" are minor, but might raise objections for those searching for a thoroughly clean family film.
THOUGHTS: The question of Big Red's validity will probably be raised again by this movie, even though he is proven by Scott's North Pole visit. But if you don't mind that, and a few other parts like those listed above, then you'll want to buy this movie. Six and a half out of ten stars.
DVD BONUSES: Minimal. I'm guessing this was among the first few to enter DVD-dom because of the small extras. There's an interactive game you can play (keep Santa airborne by ducking flocks of geese, and chimneys) a Make Santa Snacks with some Chef you've never heard of but are supposed to have, and a ""So You Wanna Be An Elf?"" feature, which is an early attempt at a behind-the-scenes feature, but didn't quite make it.",1073692800,,3346,4.6825127334465195
664508,4,6303442447,"n European countries the annual gift-giving 'character' of Saint Nicholas is more commonly known as Sinter Klaus, a sort of colloquial term. This Sinter Klaus was changed to Santa Claus for English-speaking countries where he adopted the role of the more generic character of 'Father Christmas'. Since the dawn of Xmas Commercialism the Santa image has been used by pretty much everyone to sell their crappy products. THIS is how kids in modern society are introduced to a such a ridiculous fantasy figure. Why do any parents feed their kids this nonsensical crap? Imagination is fine. But lying to them about something that a 5-year-old should be able to see through is stupid.

That said, as purely a fantasy movie, The Santa Clause is quite amusing. But maybe a bit too obnoxious to be a Xmas Classic. It was only made to cash-in on Tim Allen's Home Improvement success (and directed by a Home Improvement director) on the Disney Channel (which is even referenced rather unsubtly). I suppose it was a lucrative idea, but since I believe Tim Allen is completely talentless it's not really his own success. Santa Claus sells. Not Tim Allen. That's why all his other movies have been complete failures.

Allen plays the curiously initialled Scott Calvin, a man who accidentally kills Santa on Xmas Eve. Once he puts on the dead man's jacket he becomes the new Santa and is whisked away to the North Pole. Over the next year he undergoes a transformation from ordinary guy to fat, jolly fellow with a big, white beard. Much to the shock of his ex-wife and baffled boss Peter Boyle (who would later star in the sequels as Father Time).

I know that this is strictly a movie for kids but even before I reached double digits I questioned the logic behind 'Santa'. Even the movie lacks basic sense-making. Why would anyone doubt the existence of the movie character Santa Claus? Who do they think delivers free gifts to their children every year? It doesn't add up! If you show this to your kids and back up the lunatic conspiracy that this junk is real then shame on you. If you tell them that it is a load of crap and that the film is strictly make-belief then bravo!

This new DVD is an improvement on the last one (while not drastically) with an anamorphic 1.85:1 picture and Dolby 5.1 sound. There are a few mediocre extras.",1072310400,2,2324,4.660975609756098

I believe this is rather unusual but what's more unusual is every elf in the movie are little kids working at Santa's workshop.

  We begin with Scott Calvin, a divorced businessman with a child.  His wife has got another man in her life that Charlie, their son, looks up to, while Scott is still alone.  It is Scott's turn to take Charlie for Christmas that year, but Charlie is less than enthusiastic about staying with his work-involved, unattentive father.  Nothing goes well for them that night with dinner (it is actually quite a humorous affair), and you can sense the distance between the father and son.
  Later on that night is when things change.  Scott scares Santa Claus into falling off of the roof.  Charlie nags Scott into putting on the Santa suit and getting into the sleigh.  From that point, there is non-stop action until morning as Scott finishes up Santa's job.  At the North Pole later that night, Scott finds out that he is now subject to the Santa Clause and that he has become the new Santa whether he wants to be or not.
  The next morning, Scott wakes up and assumes that it was all a great big dream.  He is in for a rude awakening, though, when Charlie remembers the whole thing and insists that it happened.  Scott spends the year denying that tey took a trip to the North Pole.  All the while, his body undergoes some pretty hilarious changes in preparation for the upcoming Christmas.
  Along with Tim Allen as Scott Calvin/Santa Claus and Eric Lloyd as a very cute little Charlie, there is a great supporting cast to add to the movie.  Judge Reinhold plays as Charlie's role model and his mother's (played by Wendy Crewson) new boyfriend.  He is a dull psychiatrist that manages to add his own humor to the story with his disbelief of Christmas and his loud sweaters.  There is also the unforgettable David Krumholtz as the elf Bernard.  Bernard has been around for quite a long time (just ask him) and has dealt with more than one Santa.  Charlie takes a liking to him and he becomes a very integral part of the movie.
  This is a great holiday movie for anyone and everyone.  The blend of comedy, fantasy, and touching real-life issues (like family and divorce) will make it an instant classic.",1068595200,42,2357,4.5608591885441525

The Santa Clause is one of those new breed of movies.  While not a modern day Classic Like Christmas story, this movie turns in an admirable job with some humor and warmth.

Tim Allen did an excellent job playing old St. Nick in this holiday classic. The movie is an all-time classic family movie. It's funny, loving and very joyful. It really gets you into the Christmas season.
The movie starts out at a company Christmas party where we meet Scott Calvin (Allen), a divorced father who is a toy company associate. It's Christmas Eve and it's his time to be with his son. His son Charlie (Lloyd) is a typical 8 year old who gets picked on for believing in Santa Claus. His ex-wife Laura (Crewson) and her second husband Neil (Reinhold) are trying somewhat to get Charlie out of believing in St. Nick, which of course Scott is totally against.
On Christmas Eve just after midnight Charlie wakes up after hearing Santa Claus on the roof. Scott goes outside to see who's up there and Santa FALLS OFF THE ROOF! Now there is no Santa! So Charlie convinces his dad to play Santa for the night. Scott plays along with it and is no match for the real Santa. He has a problem staying quiet. Dogs bark at him, guns and alarms go off, he breaks things, knocks down Christmas trees, etc.
Now after he completes Santa's job, he starts to turn into Santa. He gains weight, his hair turns white, and he grows a beard. The funny thing is, whenever he shaves, the hair instantly grows backs. Now, Laura and Neil notice this and they think Scott is doing this purposely to make Charlie like him. So they go to court to end his visitation rights. Now that Christmas is only a month away, he has to face reality and realize HE IS SANTA and that he has a job to do. To help him face his responsibility, Charlie along with the elves are there to help him get ready for the big night.

664589,5,6303442447,"""The Santa Clause"", directed by John Pasquin, is an upbeat, Christmas tale classic that the whole family will love.
PLOT SUMMARY: Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) is a divorced dad who co-owns a toy company. During this particular Christmas, Scott's son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), comes for a visit while his mother, Laura (Wendy Crewson) and her new husband, Dr. Neil Miller (Judge Reinhold) go away. Charlie is reluclent at first staying with his father...especially after Scott accidentally burns the turkey dinner and they have to eat at Denny's restuarant. After Scott tells Charlie the 'Night Before Christmas' story and he goes to sleep, Charlie hears a ""clatter"" on the roof ""just like in the poem,"" as he says to Scott. So Scott goes outside to see what is wrong, when he is shocked to find Santa Clause on the roof! Appearently, Santa is also shocked to see him, so Santa falls off the roof and dies. Now, Scott (after putting on the Santa suit, getting in the sleigh, and bringing the preasents to the rest of the houses), is the new Santa Clause...only he doesn't realize this until after he and Charlie are brought to the North Pole and are introduced to the Arch Elf, Bernard (David Krumholtz), who tells him that he is indeed, Santa, by showing him the ""binding contract"" on the little card Scott found in the red suit. Now Scott is stuck doing something he really doesn't want to do or believes in, and he has one year to start looking like the real Santa. And if Charlie doesn't stop telling everyone that he's Santa Clause, Scott will be in a heap of trouble--especially with Laura and Neil, who feel that Charlie's strong belief in Santa Clause isn't good for him, and even try to prevent Charlie from seeing Scott when they think Scott is encouraging him.
OVERALL THOUGHTS: First of all, the acting...is absolutely superb! Tim Allen is perfect as the new-but-obligated Santa Clause. Eric Lloyd is cute and charming as Charlie, and the rest of the cast is brilliant. The storyline is humorous and fun--who wouldn't laugh when Scott keeps forgetting Bernard's name, or is making fun of Neil, or when they first arrive at the North Pole? The directing is wonderful, and the script is well-written. The special effects are darn good, too.
This special edition DVD is wonderfully packaged with a limited time movie pass to ""The Santa Clause 2: Mrs. Clause"" (the brand new sequel), exclusive sneak peak at the sequel, an original featurette, trivia game, holiday recipes, and DVD-ROM extras. The DVD is available in both wide screen and full frame formats.
I highly recommend ""The Santa Clause"".

664590,4,6303442447,"Of course, with the new Sants Clause TWO craze, you're probably wondering: ""Should I go to the theater, pay a ton for liquid buttery (yum, yum) popcorn, or go to the dollar rental & get the older one?"" Here's what I say: they're both four-star movies. Which one you get should be based on the number of adults & kids in your viewing party. If there are more adults, rent it or get it, if you have more kids, go to the theater. Its not really that bad.
But why? Simply because this, the original, has more profound humor that kids won't get. The sequel is more..""silly,"" yet still decently funny to the experienced laugher.
Bottom line: Tim Allen is  SPECTACULAR, try to watch both this holiday season.",1039219200,,701,4.4765625

On Christmas Eve Charlie hears a clatter on the roof and as Scott goes out to check, with club in hand, Santa slips and falls off the roof.

By taking Santa's suit Scott has agreed to become the next Santa Clause and the fun begins. Before the night is over Scott and Charlie have completed delivering the Christmas gifts and visit the North Pole.

But I'm not sure who eats the cookies and milk if cookies and milk was left out for Santa Clause.

Every Easter and Christmas, parents lie to thier kids on who thier presents are from. The Easter Bunny for Easter and Santa Clause from Christmas.

As the movie opens, little Charlie (Eric Lloyd) is spending Christmas Eve and the night with his father Scott (Tim Allen) becuase his mom Laura (Wendy Crewson) is spending Christmas Eve with her boyfriend/husband Neil (Judge Reinhold). Scott burns the turkey, and he and Charlie go to dinner at Denny's. (Even though we don't know what they ordered for dinner). During the night Santa Clause makes a loud noise on the roof of Scott's house. Charlie wakes up his father and Scott goes outside yells up to Santa causing him to fall. Charlie goes outside and both go on the roof find the Santa's deer and sleigh, and finishes Santa's duties with Scoot dressed as Santa Clause). And head home (to the North Pole) where an elf named Bernard (David Krunholtz) tells Scott in putting on the Santa suit he is the accpeted the duies of Santa Clause.",1038182400,,1599,4.47945205479452

Instead, he finds himself in Santa's sleigh finishing up the deliveries after Santa slips off his roof.  That's when he learns the truth, he now is Santa.  With only his son to guide him, he must accept his new life in time for the holiday next year.
This is a wonderfully fun movie.  Tim Allen gives a great performance, as does the entire cast.  The jokes are frequent and right on target for a story of a normal man becoming a legend most people don't believe in.  I've added this movie to my list of required holiday viewing and look forward to it each year.
The 5 star rating is in spite of this DVD, however.  Don't get me wrong, the picture and sound are great.  It's the features that I find disappointing.  Billed as a special edition, it has a few features that kids might enjoy once, and that's it.  There are no behind the scenes/making of features, no commentary, and they don't even have the theatrical trailer.  There is a fun feature hidden at the end of the trivia game, but getting there is so annoying that it's almost not worth it.

664684,5,6303442447,"With the possible exception of White Christmas, The Santa Clause is the best Christmas movie since films went to color.  As you can see from other's reviews, this is an absolutely terrific film.  If you are wondering whether or not to get it, get it and, if you have even the tiniest good feelings about Christmas, you won't be disappointed.
That said, someone at Disney aught to be taken out and slapped for the dismal way this movie's ""Special Edition"" was treated.  Admittedly, if you want to finally upgrade to the Widescreen version of this film (as everyone should), this is your chance.  Beyond that, however, this DVD is an unworthy homage to a terrific film.  There are no commentaries, no production notes, not even the usual fare of trailers from the film.  What is there is an absurd featurette where the actor playing Bernard comes out and gives a pep talk to a group of elves plus some holiday recipes.
Maybe I'm over-reacting, but I figure that, with this release in advance of The Santa Clause 2, they would have really loaded this up.  Director commentaries are a must and, with Disney practically owning Tim Allen, a commentary with him and some of the other stars would have been great added value.  The movie is great, as my rating references, but this is NOT a Special Edition, no matter what it says on the case.
Anyone buying this should enjoy the movie and write Disney and complain about its treatment.",1036454400,18,1427,4.657370517928287

664686,4,6303442447,"There is a certain time every year where certain kinds of films get their yearly taken out and watched. When Christmas rolls around, there are several of these films that get to see the light of day again for a while. While ""The Santa Clause"" may not be ""A Christmas Story"" or ""It's A Wonderful Life"" to some people, it is still an incredibly fun and entertaining family classic for everyone. Tim Allen, who at this time was the king of the tube with ""Home Improvement"", stars as Scott Calvin. He is a divorcee with a son named Charlie(Eric Lloyd), and is an executive at a toy company. The holidays come around and Tim and Charlie have their yearly visit. It's no surprise that Scott doesn't especially care for Charlie's stepdad Neil(Judge Reinhold). That's another story. One night, Scott hears something on the roof and goes to investigate. He yells at the strange man who is on his roof. The man slips and falls and dies. He is Santa Claus. Scott refuses to believe it at first, but Charlie is excited as all get out. Scott takes over the reins for the night until a suitable replacement comes. Scott learns that he is the permanent replacement. He is swooped away to the north pole and meets all of the elves who fill him in on what is going on....and who he will be. Then, over the course of the year and into the next holiday season, Scott gradually changes. White hair and a belly that shakes like a bowl full of jelly take over Scott. He is now, truly, Santa Claus. This all causes Scott's ex wife(Wendy Crewson) and Neil, who is a psychiatrist by the way, to think Scott has lost his mind and is messing with Charlie's in the process. The reason this movie works is because of Tim Allen. Sure, you can have a number of people in the role, but Tim has such an endearing charm and likeability to him, that he makes the moment his. It's his movie and one can't think, or want, anyone else in the role. That has been his key to such popularity for all these years. He's like a best bud. Everybody else in the film do fine jobs, but it is Tim's movie, and they all blend into the background. The movie has a nice, warm, magical feel to it. Makes you want it to be Christmas. It's a by the numbers script, but I don't think anyone will care or mind that they can pretty much figure out what is going to happen. It's not about that. It's about make believe. It's about fantasy. It's about being a kid and finding that kid in all of us. It does the heart good.",1035676800,5,2463,4.310344827586207

It's so wonderful, magical, cute, and very warm in some parts. Tim Allen is hysterically funny, and  with some of his lines. ""Freezing my nubs off out here, and you want me to get into a Santa costume."", he says after furiously and reluctantly takes off his jacket and is in his underwear putting on Santa's suit, when the other Santa falls off of Scott Calvin's (Allen) roof. When he's inside the first house he takes out a plastic dump truck and it lightly thuds on the floor as he puts under the tree. In comes this Rottweiler growling at him. Scott puts on his most winning smile and says ""Nice teeth."" The dog barks at him. He tries to escape out of the window, but an alarm goes off. Someone upstairs yells ""Who's down there?!"" He inches his way towards the fireplace, with the dog growling at him, saying ""It's the holidays. Come on. Whoo-hoo-hoo."" All of a sudden there's a gunshot. Scott eventually gets back up the chimney and on his way to the next house. This is funny and will become a favorite in your holiday movie collection. (...).",1007251200,2,1197,4.416289592760181
664803,4,6303442447,"Ever wonder, who is Santa Claus, really?  Where does he come from, how old is he?  How in the world does he squeeze down a chimney, and how does he get in if there isn't a chimney?  What's the deal here?  Well, happily, the answers to these questions and more are finally answered, as the legend of Santa Claus comes to life as never before in ""The Santa Clause,"" directed by John Pasquin and starring Tim Allen.  Scott Calvin (Allen) is an executive with a toy manufacturing company, he's divorced and has a young son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), who still believes in Santa, but is at an age at which doubt is beginning to creep into the picture.  And the fact that Charlie's mom, Laura (Wendy Crewson) has a boyfriend, Dr. Neal Miller (Judge Reinhold), who is a psychiatrist, isn't helping the situation any.  Neal, it seems, is adamant about counseling Charlie in the realities of life, which of course includes the real scoop on Santa, which doesn't go over too well with Scott.
 Then on Christmas Eve, which Charlie is spending with Scott, a strange thing happens.  There's a clatter on the roof, and Scott rushes outside to investigate, where he discovers a man in a red suit clamoring about on the roof of his two-story house.  As Scott watches, the man loses his footing and falls into the snow on the front lawn.  And to Scott's amazement, it's Santa Claus!  Or at least a guy dressed up like Santa, and he's not in very good shape at the moment.  Lying there on his back, the man hands Scott a card with instructions written on it about what to do in this particular situation.  ""Put on the suit,"" it says, ""The reindeer will know what to do.""  And when Scott looks back up at the roof, what he sees concludes what Neal would probably call an SEE (Significant Emotional Experience), and though he doesn't realize it at the moment, his life is about to change forever...
 And with that, Pasquin goes on to tell the story of Scott Calvin's amazing odyssey, which puts a humorous, and at times poignant, spin on this contemporary and highly imaginative rendition of the Santa Claus story, which offers much more than merely a fresh face on an old tale.  The Santa angle has that universal appeal that will attract viewers initially, but what makes this story really accessible is the reality which lies beneath the fantasy.  The relationships examined in this film-- the whole situation with Scott, Charlie, Laura and Neal-- are quite common in our modern world, and that obstacle in the lives of these characters puts a necessary balance in the story that makes it more than just another Christmas fantasy.  It puts an edge on the sentimentality that would've been over-the-top had Scott, for example, been a happily married man with a text book family life.  That would've been good for maybe a one hour T.V. special on a Tuesday night, whereas this story and the way it's presented is unique and lends itself well to full length motion picture status.
 When you think of Tim Allen, you don't necessarily think in terms of Santa Claus-- his Tim Taylor, ""Home Improvement"" persona is simply too far-reaching (there are, in fact, some ""in"" jokes sprinkled subtly throughout this film, like when Scott, in Santa's workshop, picks up a toy tool belt and holds it up to himself)-- but it actually becomes a positive here, and another part of the appeal of this film.  it establishes Scott as a real person, an average guy attempting to cope with the everyday problems of everyday life.  And it keeps the core of the story grounded, which ultimately makes the fantasy work while giving it heart.  So, in retrospect, Allen was a perfect choice for the role of Scott Calvin, and in the long run this just may turn out to be one of his most memorable roles (which is somewhat ironic, as this was Allen's big screen debut), because this is certainly the kind of film that is bound to make a lot of people's annual ""holiday movies to watch"" list, falling into that category of films you can watch over and over again every Christmas season, like ""A Christmas Story."" ""Christmas Vacation,"" ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life.""  All films which, though certainly diverse, have at their center the spirit of Christmas along with family values and traditions, and all told in a way that enables the viewer to readily identify with the characters and the story, which is exactly what this film does.
 Eric Lloyd turns in a good performance as Charlie, making his character believable while keeping him positive despite the conflicts which surround him, and Crewson and Reinhold are solid in their respective roles, as well.  But in supporting roles, the standout performances come from David Krumholtz, as Bernard, Santa's Head Elf, and Paige Tamada, who is endearing as Judy, the Little Elf.
 Rounding out the supporting cast are Peter Boyle (Mr. Whittle), Mary Gross (Miss Daniels), Larry Brandenburg (Detective Nunzio), Judith Scott (Susan), Jayne Eastwood (Judy, the Waitress) and Joyce Guy (Principal Compton).  An entertaining and ultimately uplifting movie, ""The Santa Clause"" is funny and enjoyable and has a lot to offer in the way of family entertainment, the kind of film adults and kids alike are going to appreciate.  And it may even make you believe in some things you hadn't even considered before-- but that's for you to figure out as you watch the movie.

664806,5,6303442447,"If the summer weather is getting to you and you start to long for snow and Christmas cookies with hot apple cider, this is just the movie to awaken that inner child who is still fascinated with life and believes in magic.

The scene is set for a rather bleak Christmas. Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) plays the part of a divorced toy company executive who wants to spend Christmas with his son. Charlie is not exactly thrilled with the prospects of his father's culinary talents and they opt out for dinner at Denny's. Later that evening after Scott has read The Night Before Christmas to Charlie, Charlie awakens to the ""clattering"" on the roof. Scott runs outside to find reindeer on his roof and Santa who then suddenly falls off the roof. Ooopps.

So, what will happen to all the presents and who will deliver them? Scott puts on the red suit and by doing so enters into the"" Santa Clause"" and must be the next Santa. In order to prepare for his duties, he physically changes into the jolly Santa everyone loves. Scott mentions a few ""versions"" of Santa Claus who are loved by millions of children all over the world. This legendary figure is portrayed in this movie as a jolly, stout man with a twinkle in his eye, rosy-red cheeks and a cheerful laugh. This is the American adaptation of the European legend of Saint Nicholas.

Though he may look a bit different in each country and be called many names, to children of all countries his message is the same. They peek out the windows and hope to catch a glimpse of this special man as he flies through the sky, delivering gifts for boys and girls they will get to open on Christmas Day.

There are many enjoyable witty lines executed so well by Tim Allen. The script is superb and memorable. The classic ""Tim"" with fire extinguisher in hand to save the flaming family turkey is a must see. Charlie himself says some pretty funny one liners and is quite the actor in this movie. The elves are also adorable and they come to the rescue at a moments notice.

A very enjoyable family comedy you can laugh along with, year after year. While this movie doesn't really explain the true meaning of Christmas, it does give some insight into the true spirit of the Holiday Season.

The standout scene for me is a small dance sequence set to (of all things) ZZ Top's ""Gimme All Your Lovin'"" featuring Allen and the elves--they even do moves that were in the video!  Overall, not a bad one to haul out at the holidays, but there's really nothing here that hasn't been done before.",970099200,,712,4.412213740458015
