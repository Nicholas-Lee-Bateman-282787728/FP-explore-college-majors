8468716,5,B00170B27W,Just purchased my copy on Amazon. Love this short documentary. Beautifully made and wish it was longer. Wondering if there is an unedited or raw version and if there is I would love to see all the footages taken by these people who produced this beautiful documentary. Rest In Peace to Manoa Manoa and all the others who have passed on.,1523318400,,336,4.524590163934426
8468717,4,B00170B27W,"If you are interested in Tuvalu, this film shows a lot about it's culture, people, and current predicament.  It's not too long and has some very interesting/beautiful moments.
If you like independent films, made by real people exploring our world, this should be right up your alley.
