1427989,1,B00005J6V2,"This boring IMAX movie scared our 3-year-old so much that we had to leave before it ended.  Less plot than a 1950s drive-in monster movie, but the same concept:  human vs. monster, accented by dark creepy scenes giving you the feeling that a deadly beast is hiding behind the next tree.  We expected interesting visual science, not this movie that may forever distort our son's feelings about nature and the unknown.  Bah!",1012089600,10,422,4.819444444444445
1427990,1,B00005J6V2,"Picture if you will excited little me hunched in front of the TV set playing ""T-Rex:  Back to the Cretaceous"" on my DVD player.  The film starts with a boring story of a neglected daughter whose dad is a paleontologist...oops, I nod off here for a while, then the story continues as I watch the time counter on the DVD ticking past 20 minutes, then 25 minutes and I'm thinking, ""HEY!  WHERE ARE THE FREAKING DINOSAURS, MAN?""  Next I pick up a magazine...still waiting for DINOSAURS then HOLD ON!  There's a couple of seconds of dino action then...THE CREDITS?  This movie is a complete waste of time!  There are probably about two minutes of dinosaur action tops among the boring, modern-day boring (did I say that already) incredibly boring story!  ....  This is really a total [disappointment].",1010016000,24,796,4.751824817518248
1427991,2,B00005J6V2,"I have been collecting IMAX films, with about 35 in my collection. This DVD version of T REX is one of the worst. The emphasis is not so much on the T REX and what we think we know about it, but on the special effects of going back in time to see the T REX. Unique to this IMAX film is that the film is acted out instead of narrated. The problem we have is poor continuity shots. Instead of seeing someone simply walk through a door, we see someone walk through time, but with no continuity as to how the person went back in time, and then back to the present. We have to figure out what the film maker intended, and this distracts us from catching the story line. The film is supposed to have the best special effects. I thought Jurassic Park had better, but then we learn little about the T-REX anyway, so what is the point of the movie? It is never explained to us, for instance, what the small hands on the R REX were used for. Finally, we are told this film is based on the latest scientific evidence. Right. The evolutionary concept is tossed out as if its the answer to everything, as is the span of millions of years, and everything has just worked out, and we have a clear picture of the past. The reality is that basic questions are not covered. For instance, if the earth is as old as this film says it is--millions and millions of years--and we evolved from one species to the next, then where are all the transitionary forms of animals--things that are part fish and part lizard, for instance? They should be as common as houseflys, but there are none to be found,and this should raise some serious questions for those who so easily promote evolution as a catch all theory of life. But this is not even addressed in this movie. In the end, we don't learn anything new about the T REX. The emphasis is on the trip and not the T REX itself. A major dissapointment. On the plus side, the acting seems natural, and the opening scene has some nice IMAX visuals, but other than this, with most IMAX DVDs selling for well over ..., and this one for well under ..., you get what you pay for, except in this case, its border line. A disappointing film.",995414400,15,2156,4.260975609756097
1427992,1,B00005J6V2,"I saw this when it was at the local IMAX. Don't even bother. Poor story line. Too much time on the young girl. Just wasn't worth it.
  Better would be to see the Discovery Video series: Walking with Dinosaurs (1,2,3) or When Dinosaurs Walked America.",995328000,9,250,4.533333333333333
1427993,1,B00005J6V2,"I suppose that a young girl's hallucinatory wanderings (after she gets a whiff of petrified dinosaur egg dust) was meant to be entertaining and informative.  Her after hours &#8216;trip' through a  natural history museum trying to justify her T-REX laid eggs theory  turns out to be just boring.  Wow, look at all these plants. Whoa! Hey! We do actually get to see a couple (five or so) of the critters for a few minutes, and in their original 3D IMAX presentation they might have been quite startling leaping out at you from the screen.  I wanted to know more about dinosaurs, not get 3D thrills which were confined to the original IMAX presentation.  These dinosaurs don't have much impact on the home video screen.  The lone T-REX even turns out to be friendly enough to get a pat on the nose from our tripped out heroine.  And wait! The petrified rock hatches!  Now that's really informative science for the kids, I've been around for 6 decades and even I had not known that petrified eggs could actually hatch (and of course the hatchling leaps out at you from the screen).  Maybe I should get to the museum more often.  I guess that might make 6 dinosaurs in the movie with two T-REXs.....",994377600,16,1195,4.589622641509434
1427994,1,B00005J6V2,"I saw this title when it was at the IMAX theater.  Not as much meat to it as Allosaurus and this feature was made for the big screen.  The childish plot centers more on the child's relationship with her father than focusing on the dinosaur.  If you want a feature that is much more dinosaur oriented but ""Allosaurus"" or ""Walking with Dinosaurs.""",992995200,11,345,4.532258064516129
1427995,1,B00005J6V2,"The best word for this 3D dinosaur romp is: b-o-r-i-n-g.  I actually fell asleep part way through.  The 3D effects are very good, but you get over that quickly.  The story isn't just weak -it's non existent.  The science is laughable. I found myself fascinated by how many times the pimples on the teen-age heroine's face moved around. The are VERY prominent in 3D, and provided evidence that the live filming took place over a number of weeks. Your money and time would both be better spent on that root-canal you've been putting off.",990144000,13,535,4.659574468085107
1428006,3,B00005J6V2,"This movie has two things going for it; the last 10 minutes and a wonderful William Ross score. Seeing it on the actual 3-D Imax for the first time was great. However, on the dvd, with the special effects of the big screen omitted, leaves much to be desired.",1161388800,,258,4.285714285714286
1428007,3,B00005J6V2,"I am NOT recommending buying the 2D DVD of this film.  YOU HONESTLY MUST SEE IT IN 3D on a Very BIG Screen to appreciate it.  I admit that I am a fan of Time Travel films, but I Loved this movie so much in IMAX 3D that I saw it 4 times, and brought friends with me, and they enjoyed it in IMAX 3D too.  Yes, the script and directing could have been better, but the producers did a wonderful job giving you the FEELING of actually being a Time Traveller... when seen in IMAX 3D.

Hopefully a 3D Blu-Ray will be released some day, so that it can at least be enjoyed on HDTVs.  And hopefully you will get a chance to try it in an IMAX Theatre.

Again, just seeing it on a regular DVD is NOT going to be enjoyable. So, the IMAX 3D version gets 3 stars, almost like a 3D Blu-Ray would, but in all honesty, a regular DVD of it probably only deserves 1 star.

December 2012 Update:
I have finally seen this movie again in 3D.  It was on the 3D channel that shows 3D documentaries on DirecTV.  And while it was nice seeing it again, my friend was underwhelmed (after all I have said about it), and so was I.  So again, it's only really good in IMAX 3D.",1144540800,,1144,3.9780701754385963
1428008,3,B00005J6V2,"The plot is hokey, but my son loves the movie.  It was made for kids like him, not me, so if you've got a dinosaur-obsessed child, he or she will probably love it, too.",1127779200,,168,3.9411764705882355
1428009,1,B00005J6V2,"What a total piece of crap!  It's hard to imagine that even the special effects in an IMAX theatre could have redeemed this disaster.  For one thing, how would there have been time to have all that many special dinosaur effects when most of the movie revolves around one very uninteresting little girl?

Apparently, someone thought that it would be a great idea to pass off a juvenile feminist tract as a dinosaur adventure.  It was not a great idea.  Anyone expecting to learn anything about dinosaurs or even see all that many dinosaurs in this production is going to be very disappointed and is going to feel very deceived indeed.

To give this DVD even one star is an insult to movies which do deserve at least one star.  This rotten piece of work doesn't even deserve one star.

Save your money and buy one of the truly well-done DVD's out there about dinosaurs and the prehistoric world.  ""Walking With Dinosaurs,"" ""Walking With Prehistoric Beasts,"" ""When Dinosaurs Roamed America"" and ""Prehistoric America"" are all very good.  Don't waste even a penny on ""T-Rex - Back to the Cretaceous!""

1428010,4,B00005J6V2,"From the bulk of reviews on this site I gather most people don't realize that IMAX is about presentation and style rather than story and content. Shot on vertical 70mm film the reels in the projection booth take up a huge amount of space, thus the running time of IMAX movies tends to be kept to around 45-50 minutes. Thus the format lends itself more towards the documentary/short movie genre. Most of the movies are factual but sometimes original stories come along. T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous is one of them.
It came out in 1998 and when I was at the Trocadero IMAX-3D cinema in London I had to choose between this movie and another called Across the Sea of Time. I chose the latter. Which is a shame coz the dinosaurs and huge shots of this movie would have looked better in 3D.
T-Rex begins with an impressive opening shot of the camera swooping over the Arizona desert, which still looks great even on a widescreen TV instead of the huge IMAX screen. There's a hefty narration from the lead actress conveying relevant information about dinosaurs. In this respect the film feels a bit like a 10-year-old's educational program. But being familiar with IMAX movies I was expecting this. I think too many people were expecting a Jurassic Park variant.
Tho I would have expected a few more dinosaurs. In the 45 minute running time there wasn't much dinosaur action. Though there was a good amount of story that I did get into. Plus the movie has a great score by William Ross. He released a promo CD of this score but it's impossible to find.
Hey, I was entertained and I thot the brief story was quite okay. The horribly slanderous reviews on this site really baffle me. The IMAX format does not work well on DVD, you have to see these movies in the cinema. But if you have a good sound system then the DVD is still worth it.
The DVD is in 1.33:1 full frame (they are shown theatrically at 1.44:1 so there isn't much modification to the framing) with a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack that is quite impressive. A slight featurette and an IMAX movies trailer are also included.",1083456000,5,2070,4.522666666666667
1428011,1,B00005J6V2,"I saw this at an Imax theatre, I was thinking what awesome potential seeing dinosaurs in 3D would provide. Boy was I wrong, there was around 10 seconds of CG dinosaurs in this, and they were badly animated. The rest is the most banal story imagineable about a girl and her quest to find an egg or something (I forget, it was _that_ dull).
Check out Walking with Dinosaurs instead.",1073606400,7,380,4.442857142857143
1428012,1,B00005J6V2,"I saw this in the Smithsonian with my kids, and even with the novelty of seeing a movie in 3D it was *boring*.  It was a complete waste of time and money.
If you are looking for eye candy, there are very few scenes that actually have ""live"" dinosaurs.  If you are looking for science, and you're over 5, I doubt you'll learn anything new.",1072828800,7,338,4.184615384615385
1428013,3,B00005J6V2,"Clean and decent entertainment.  Saw it on the IMAX screen with a 10 year old boy who loves the dino's.  He wasn't thrilled but I (33 yrs old and sick of shoot 'em ups) thought it was clean decent and even slightly educational.  My dvd collection is 200 movies strong and I will add this for entertainment value for adults and children alike.  (Although I know it won't be as grand as on the IMAX screen.)

1428014,1,B00005J6V2,Stick to the Discovery Channel series on Dinosaurs and Prehistoric beasts.  They are much more informational and done much better.  This is a story about a girl's desire to please and impress her father rather than about dinosaurs.  The actual segments with dinosaurs in them are fleeting.  It attempts to make a point about proving  and disproving theories but that gets a little lost in the story line and is never really clarified.,1017964800,15,434,4.890410958904109

7938477,5,B00005J6V2,"This 45-minute film is great fun.  It's also seriously misunderstood and underrated by many in its audience, I feel.  I did originally see it in IMAX 3D, and merely watching a 2D DVD presentation is certainly a pale imitation of that; but I happen to think the script is fairly clever, following young paleontologist Ally as she tries to sell her dino-expert dad on her latest hypothesis that the T-Rex laid eggs in nests and defended their unhatched young.  It seems her father (Peter Horton) feels Ally is safer working in the museum; he's concerned about her desire to participate in the sometimes-dangerous fossil digs.  In the midst of his own focus of parental protectiveness, he has trouble believing that dinosaurs could have manifested the same instincts.  After Ally inhales a strange mist emerging from a cracked T-Rex egg, she is pulled into a multilayered dream sequence in which various exhibit scenes in the museum come to life.  There are a number of nice (albeit brief) special effects sequences with animated dinosaurs.  If you really enjoy the atmosphere of museums, and if you have ever had the strange feeling that the exhibits you are looking at are somehow...er...ALIVE, then you are the perfect audience for this film.  I think I must have watched this fifty times or more.",1460419200,,1297,4.91743119266055

I can qoute the whole movie and spite all of that I still just bought the movie to watch with old friends who worked there with me.

7938483,1,B00005J6V2,"This weekend my family and I were duped into seeing this in 3D at IMAX. My children, 3 year old twin boys fascinated with Dinosaurs, caught a glimpse of the advertising and begged to see it. Thinking ""Watching T-Rex walk around in 3D should be quite fun for them"". Think again.

At some point around 20-25 minutes into the movie, I started thinking about the scene in Jurassic Park where Ian Malcom says something to the effect of, ""You are going to have Dinosaurs on your Dinosaur tour?""

This is actually a story about an annoying girl, in conflict with her unloving father, who won't make time for her, who won't allow her to dig for bones in the dirt, and ridicules her theories about Dinosaurs. At some point along the way, the girl travels back in time. Of course she is only there to see glimpses of more boring Dinosaurs and lots of trees and vegetation.

When she time travels, she can only manage to stay in a place of interest for no more than say 30-60 seconds tops. Then back to boringville to ponder why these things are happening to her.

Most of her time traveling is back to talk to some old painters and paleontologists (very boring people) and not even Dinosaurs at all. Finally at the end she has a brief time travel to see the very passive T-Rex, which even that manages to be boring.

The acting was terrible also. None of the people felt real or genuine.

In the end my kids hated it, and at their age, there isn't much they don't like. Even the use of 3D couldn't save this disaster. I feel robbed of my money. The people at IMAX should feel ashamed and embarrassed of themselves.",1245628800,2,1604,4.402027027027027

I thought it was was one of the best IMAX movies I've seen, but it should be watched as it was intended by the creators. DLJ.",1201910400,2,402,3.761904761904762
