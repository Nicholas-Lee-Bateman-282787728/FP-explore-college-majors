7841356,4,6303239188,"The version of astroboy vol. 2 that I have does not have a title, but does feature 3 episodes on the video. The are titled first love, save the  carolina 3, and fighting aliens. Astroboy is a very unique  character/cartoon in a sense that in almost every episode there is a war  going on, or fighting, or spaceships shooting eachother, etc. yet, it aims  to promote peace and harmony.  althought i am in my early twenties, i had  some trouble following the storyline of many an episode, and it beats my  how little kids were meant to make sense of this.  The storyboard is  usually all over the place, and the language they use is definitely not for  anyone below the age of ten.
Astroboy has become quite a cult-icon in  recent years.  He abounds on everything from keyrings to glasses to t  shirts to everything else u can think of.  If you find yourself getting  into the astroboy scene, then this video is definitely for you. You'll love  all the trademarks of astroboy and the cartoons.  He's the only cartoon  hero i know who actually HAS his girlfriend's legs! He's the only cartoon  hero that can shoot bullets out of his underpants/hip! There are so many  more little weird additions.. and i won't spoil them for you.  Just get this  video, it is very entertaining and well worth it... definitely something to  cherish.
