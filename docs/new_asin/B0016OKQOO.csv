3161968,4,B0016OKQOO,"If you liked the first season, you will enjoy this one also. It breaks the various chapters down quite well without too much repetition which you would expect  in a lecture mode. This documentary draws enough analogies to relate to the layman. sometimes the Jazzed up music detracts somewhat from the seriousness of the material. For that any BBC production wins hands down. I would also like the History Channel production to be more broadminded and global in their coverage. Too much coverage on discoveries and talks from inside the USA. Is there no groundbreaking astronomy conducted anywhere else on the globe?",1227398400,6,615,5.029411764705882
3161969,5,B0016OKQOO,"The season two of the History Channel serie completes perfectly the season one. The only regret, for me as a non English speaking viewer, is that there is no subtitles, even closed captioned as written by mistake on the Amazon.com website. But the whole pictures and special effects are wonderful, and the scientists speeches are perfectly understandable by foreigners. For all those interested by astronomy, it's a must to buy, like the season one.",1227398400,3,449,5.081081081081081
3161970,5,B0016OKQOO,Just when you think they can't top season one... My partner and I can't stop watching this show.  Once it's done we just put disc one back in and re-watch it!,1227225600,2,158,4.096774193548387
3161971,5,B0016OKQOO,"Season two offers more innovative topics than season one. The chapter devoted to nebulae integrates with the amateur astronomy community, showing comprehensively how astrophotography works. I would love to see more and more astronomy documentaries recognizing the efforts of amateurs and their activities.
The metal case is great. The 5 disks were included in a very narrow space.",1226880000,2,380,5.568965517241379
3161972,5,B0016OKQOO,"I ordered this series with the thought 'what more can they do?' I seen it all in season one, it cannot top that. Was I wrong!
It was even better.

To realize that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old, and so vast, that it's totally beyond our comprehension and still expanding. A truly unimaginable thought, that.
There are so many amazing episodes, one of which shows the largest objects in space. They are seriously big, like the so-called ""cosmic web"" of galaxies, which is a hundred million billion times bigger than Earth. Then there's the fascinating Lunar transient phenomena, the pulsar planets, the hot Jupiters, the weather in space, dark matter, dark energy, and much more. Really mind-boggling stuff, this!
For instance it's estimated that the impact of the asteroid that landed on the Yucatan Peninsula about 65 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs, this was equal to that of dropping a Hiroshima-sized atomic bomb every second for 140 years!

And another mind-boggling thought, where did we really come from...hmmn. Still, I'd like to go to heaven eventually:)

This series had me riveted to my screen. The computer-generated imagery and other effects is so realistic. It makes one feel as if one is truly there experiencing this phenomenal aspects. And it's explained so simply that anyone can understand it.
My favourite episodes are:
Alien Planets, Dark Matter, Astrobiology
Space Travel,Unexplained Mysteries &
Colonizing Space.

A truly awesome series! Enjoyed every bit of it.",1225756800,31,1511,5.130081300813008

3161974,5,B0016OKQOO,"Ever since I saw this series, I was hooked. Beautiful CGI and down to earth explanations. I have always been interested in Astronomy and this was a winner. There aren't too many series like these anymore so to see this one was amazing.",1224115200,6,235,4.488372093023256
3161975,4,B0016OKQOO,"First of all, let me start out by saying that this is an excellent collection of documentaries about the universe. However, for those of us with widescreen televisions, we should be aware that this collection, much like season one, is NOT optimized for our widescreen televisions.  It is presented in 'Letterbox' format, meaning that on widescreen televisions it will be presented with large black bars on all sides, with the feature occupying a window in the middle of the screen.  For those with 4:3 televisions, it will appear as all widescreen features do, but for 16:9 screens it is a major disappointment.",1223856000,21,611,4.980392156862745
3161976,5,B0016OKQOO,"This is a great series for a classroom. As a high school earth science teacher, I've seen A LOT of really bad documentaries, and this is one my students really enjoy. Great graphics, easy to follow, and a really diverse range of scientists. Matches my astronomy units well and fits perfectly into a single class period. And as one of my female students said to me ""I love those videos, there are so many GIRL scientists in them!""",1218931200,10,429,4.512820512820513
3161977,5,B0016OKQOO,"I have my DVR set to record whenever this show is on, so I have seen all of Season 1 and 2 to date.  They are wonderful! There is so much fascinating information packed into these shows that you want to watch them over and over again!",1212796800,29,234,3.978723404255319

3161999,5,B0016OKQOO,"Unlike another reviewer the set I received play perfectly on my wide screen television. Suggest that person check their tv's settings.
  Like all the other episodes on all the seasons I own the Bluray versions really enhance the experience!
  Accuracy of the information will change as more updated data is found.
  After all these shows are intended for amusement-most of us are not using these shows for research.
  I only mention that because I have seen some criticism of the scientific accuracy of these shows.

3162002,5,B0016OKQOO,"This is an excellent season and is much longer and more comprehensive than season 1 (5 discs as opposed to 2).  Each episode is about 45 minutes long and there are 3-5 episodes per disc.  I found the Unexplained Mysteries, Colonizing Space, and Space Travel to be most interesting but they are all good.  The scientists on the episodes are able to explain very complex topics in a relatively easy to understand way.  Overall you definitely get your money's worth, $15 is a good buy for how much content this season contains.  I would highly recommend it for anyone even remotely interested in astronomy and wanting to learn more.",1437955200,,629,4.73394495412844

3162156,4,B0016OKQOO,"I have watched the entire series twice. It would rate 5 Stars but for the music score. It is so loud and intrusive that in many places the narrator is overwhelmed. Fortunately, it does not generally interfere with the guest scientists. It's amazing that they can explain such complex topics so that the average non-scientist can gain some understanding of those forces. Granted, without a degree in Physics it is impossible to understand it all. The simple experiments and demonstrations presented by the guest astronomers help to give some idea as to the great forces at work in the Universe. My thanks to Drs. Filippenko, Mainzer, Thaller and all the other Astronomers in the series.",1410480000,,685,4.965217391304348

You don't need to be a Quantum geek to enjoy the series.  It's full of interesting investigations and videos that can catch your imagination and push your limits of understanding.  I'd not be surprised to find that there are a few more folds in my brain that aren't wrinkles from age.  I'm 70 now (gulp!) and still finding reasons for staying on top, more or less, with the advances that face us with science and cosmology.  WMAP??  Dark Energy and Dark Matter?

So many interesting and amazing facts about the universe. Dramatize in the grandeur, the beauty and awesome scale of the universe. Another thing is the speakers. They present Dark Matter as if it's a fact when there is much controversy over the Dark Matter theory.

The newer seasons include information that has been updated with the advances in science that was not available or known in the earlier or older seasons. There are a lot of different series out that include much of the same information and also have great graphics but I find that The Universe spends more time/episodes going more thoroughly through a subject and that gives a better all around understanding on the subject,1387670400,,587,4.821782178217822

3162285,5,B0016OKQOO,"The History Channel delivers with the series The Universe.  So far, through 2010, there have been five seasons.  Probably my favorite is Season Two, which aired from November 2007 to April 2008.

Here are the individual episodes in Season Two:

Alien Planets
Cosmic Holes
Mysteries Of The Moon
The Milky Way
Alien Moons
Dark Matter/Dark Energy
Astrobiology
Space Travel
Supernovas
Constellations
Unexplained Mysteries
Cosmic Collisions
Colonizing Space
Nebulas
Wildest Weather In The Cosmos
Biggest Things In Space
Gravity
Cosmic Apocalypse

Each episode is well done and easy to understand.  I had two astronomy courses in college, so I had pretty good knowledge of astronomy before ever viewing this series.  However, I don't feel that the narrator and scientists/scholars dumb everything down for the viewing audience.  Astronomy is a complex subject that can be quite technical and hard to understand at times, so I think the comments by scientists throughout the series strike a good balance - not too technical, not too simple.  Just right.

Throughout the series you'll hear fascinating facts, theories, and explanations.  You'll see well done computer generated images of everything in the cosmos - moons, stars, galaxies, nebulas, planets, etc.  My favorite episodes in this second season are Wildest Weather In The Cosmos, The Milky Way, Mysteries Of The Moon, Nebulas, Supernovas, and Cosmic Holes.

I highly recommend this second season as well as the entire series.",1296864000,3,1478,5.373913043478261

The narration will take you from elementary concepts to abstract aspects of our universe and offers insight from the greatest minds of our time.

3162294,1,B0016OKQOO,"The second season CVD set is even worse than the first: made for selling American commercial advertising, each break is punctuated with a cliff-hanging ""guess what's next"" followed by a mini-rehash of what has been said so as to remind the viewer of where the last scene left off a few seconds earlier. Terrible editing, at best. The science is superficial, the photography occasionally breathtaking, but repeated over and over to loud crashing sounds - they even point out that there is no sound in space, but pay no attention to their own series!

Do consider waiting for the BBC to produce a stronger offering. If view it you must, rent a copy, don't buy - you're unlikely to want to view it again. Can you believe an astronomy scientist whose hair is tinted red and whose hobby is belly dancing can really be given credence when she tries to demonstrate a principle of gravity and motion whilst in costume? Attenborough has a sense of decorum . . . and doesn't talk down to his audience.",1266364800,3,991,4.630681818181818

3162297,1,B0016OKQOO,"I have to agree with the other reviewers on these Universe sets, however Season 1 was enjoyable to watch and we all learned a lot.  In these series, yes, they have interesting parts embedded in the LOUD music and flashy graphics and they need appropriate BACKGROUND music and SUBTITLES -- graphics need to be less fast paced so that they viewer can enjoy parts of the galaxy.  Perhaps produce a 5-10 minute fast and loud version as an extra for each disk.  Some of the analogies (fast cars, jumps off cliffs or into caves, etc.) are difficult for foreign people to understand, but I realize that the History channel is for the general public and probably they are trying to keep everyone awake.  Still, one hopes for something of BBC quality for this type of series.  Perhaps with DVD technology these days they could have a selection for background music-- classical, heavy metal, country, jazz.",1255564800,,896,4.754838709677419
3162298,4,B0016OKQOO,"The History Channel knows science, and they're good at making complex systems and ideas easy to understand - and approachable - for the everyday observer. The Universe, Complete Season Two on Blu-ray is no exception. This four-disc set features all 18 episodes, nearly 15 hours of content, including covering topics like Dark Matter, Exoplanets, Cosmic Collisions, Supernovas, and more. And while episodes are only loosely tied together by the fact that the subjects covered are part of - or take place in - our universe, it doesn't seem overly odd or disjointed- especially for the younger viewers.

Fantastic phenomena and alien worlds are re-created through extremely realistic computer animation, which is shockingly detailed and stunningly beautiful. The visuals take viewers inside wonders that man has only viewed from afar, giving a close-up look at the fascinating inner workings of the cosmos around us.

The series also includes documentary style interviews with experts in the field, as well as footage from both past and current scientific exploration programs and an introduction to some of the tools and devices these scientists use to explore the universe. A nice contrast to the computer re-creations, this live-action documentary aspect of the series does a good job of providing balance, grounding the concepts and reminding viewers that there are actual people working to find answers and discover new information about the space around us- it's not simply Star Trek.

Whether used as an educational tool or simply for entertainment value, The Universe - Season Two on Blu-ray is interesting and enthralling.

Special Features

There aren't a lot of ""extras"" on The Universe, but given the nature of the series - and the fact that it is a television series - that's not surprising. There is one Bonus Feature, a featurette called Backyard Astronomers, which explores the world of amateur star-gazers- men and women who spend their spare time learning about - and exploring - the universe... from their backyards.

The biggest benefit to the Blu-ray release lies in the presentation - true widescreen and HD.

And of course the subject matter itself.",1253232000,12,2169,5.23342939481268

3162307,3,B0016OKQOO,"I thoroughly enjoyed the season 1 DVDs, but after viewing the first DVD of The Universe - The Complete Season Two, I was exhausted -- to the point of wishing it would end so I could be in peace again.  The music was so overpowering that, in my experience, it distracted from the science. Perhaps this is a result of the fact that I have not watched TV for the last 25 years and have not become desensitized to the intense soundtrack of such programs.  I have decided to take a bit of time to recover from that auditory assault before I continue with disks 2,3,4 and 5.",1236556800,8,568,4.25
3162308,2,B0016OKQOO,"I bought this DVD set  for a U3A (University of the 3rd Age) discussion group on Astronomy, but it has been a major failure. The group only tolerated half of one DVD (The Milky Way). The audience, all over 70, could hardly hear the commentary because it was overwhelmed by very loud background sounds of booms and weird electronic noises - more like modern so-called music than the silence of a space vacuum. The graphics were terrible - fast zooms, rotations explosions and rapid strangeness which presumably come from video games. Astronomical images have a grandeur and beauty which has nothing to do with this teen-age idea of changes too fast for the brain to take in. It would be much better to use real Hubble images and professional pictures created from radio telescopes, gamma ray receptors and infra-red, which have to be derivatives since we cannot see in those wave-lengths. Such images were there, but only briefly flashed and usually over-layed with some nerd's idea of what space might be like, but is not.  Numerous outstanding images from professional astronomers are available on the internet without need to artificially derive anything jazzy and noisy. The information from the commentators is excellent and right up to date - for those of us who could actually hear it. The BBC do these sorts of programs superbly and we will be looking to change over to their versions since 15 people were unanimous they did want to see or hear any more like this.",1235347200,12,1471,4.833333333333333
3162309,4,B0016OKQOO,The substance in this package is very interesting and up to date and the pictures were reasonably clear. What irritates me is the program stops followed by some repetition before continuation. It is clear that this is where the TV commercials where broadcasted. I wish that those repetitions were cut with the commercials because they disturb the concentration and reminds you of the hated commercials.,1233446400,4,402,5.2
3162310,5,B0016OKQOO,"Wonderfully presented series. The computer simulations, actual footage and data, and accompanying explanations are easy to understand and absorb. As well as Awe-inspiring, the series captivates you with the most recent discoveries and information. After watching many other similar documenteries I thought I had seen it all, until watching this series. This series had so much more than I had thought. Great as a gift to a young budding enthusiast, an old one, or even for the Astronomy Collection at home. I've already recommended it to my friends, and see myself watching this series many more times.",1233014400,,602,5.216494845360825
3162311,5,B0016OKQOO,"First off, please note, I don't have cable and have never seen this program on television before but when Amazon suggested it in my Recommendations I went ahead and ordered it, series unseen.  Whereas there can sometimes be contradictions in the facts (one person says there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy...another says there are 400 billion) overall the amount and variety of information and topics covered is extremely well done. I have bought seasons 1 and 2 now and am looking forward to the release of season 3. Shoot, I've been thinking of getting a blu-ray player just so I can start ordering series like this in blu-ray.  If nothing else, I like to just put a disc on...mute the tv...put on some great music...and use the program as an excellent source for beautifully stunning visuals.  At this point, I love this series.
P.s. I also like the steelbook casing since it seems much sturdier than the usual cardboard/plastic ones.",1231372800,2,942,4.802469135802469
3162312,5,B0016OKQOO,"This is the second season of one of the best science programs from the History channel.

It presents the science accurately and in detail and gives you an excellent overview of astronomy and cosmology.

More importantly, it captures the excitement of scientific discovery better than most science video. You get an inside look at the process of discovery.

Get a copy of this series. You will want to watch it again and again.",1229731200,,426,4.808219178082192

3396465,4,B0016OKQOO,"If you liked the first season, you will enjoy this one also. It breaks the various chapters down quite well without too much repetition which you would expect  in a lecture mode. This documentary draws enough analogies to relate to the layman. sometimes the Jazzed up music detracts somewhat from the seriousness of the material. For that any BBC production wins hands down. I would also like the History Channel production to be more broadminded and global in their coverage. Too much coverage on discoveries and talks from inside the USA. Is there no groundbreaking astronomy conducted anywhere else on the globe?",1227398400,6,615,5.029411764705882
3396466,5,B0016OKQOO,"The season two of the History Channel serie completes perfectly the season one. The only regret, for me as a non English speaking viewer, is that there is no subtitles, even closed captioned as written by mistake on the Amazon.com website. But the whole pictures and special effects are wonderful, and the scientists speeches are perfectly understandable by foreigners. For all those interested by astronomy, it's a must to buy, like the season one.",1227398400,3,449,5.081081081081081

The chapter devoted to nebulae integrates with the amateur astronomy community, showing comprehensively how astrophotography works. I would love to see more and more astronomy documentaries recognizing the efforts of amateurs and their activities.
The metal case is great. The 5 disks were included in a very narrow space.",1226880000,2,380,5.568965517241379
3396469,5,B0016OKQOO,"I ordered this series with the thought 'what more can they do?' I seen it all in season one, it cannot top that. Was I wrong!
It was even better.

To realize that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old, and so vast, that it's totally beyond our comprehension and still expanding. A truly unimaginable thought, that.
There are so many amazing episodes, one of which shows the largest objects in space. They are seriously big, like the so-called ""cosmic web"" of galaxies, which is a hundred million billion times bigger than Earth. Then there's the fascinating Lunar transient phenomena, the pulsar planets, the hot Jupiters, the weather in space, dark matter, dark energy, and much more. Really mind-boggling stuff, this!
For instance it's estimated that the impact of the asteroid that landed on the Yucatan Peninsula about 65 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs, this was equal to that of dropping a Hiroshima-sized atomic bomb every second for 140 years!

And another mind-boggling thought, where did we really come from...hmmn. Still, I'd like to go to heaven eventually:)

This series had me riveted to my screen. The computer-generated imagery and other effects is so realistic. It makes one feel as if one is truly there experiencing this phenomenal aspects. And it's explained so simply that anyone can understand it.
My favourite episodes are:
Alien Planets, Dark Matter, Astrobiology
Space Travel,Unexplained Mysteries &
Colonizing Space.

3396472,4,B0016OKQOO,"First of all, let me start out by saying that this is an excellent collection of documentaries about the universe. However, for those of us with widescreen televisions, we should be aware that this collection, much like season one, is NOT optimized for our widescreen televisions.  It is presented in 'Letterbox' format, meaning that on widescreen televisions it will be presented with large black bars on all sides, with the feature occupying a window in the middle of the screen.  For those with 4:3 televisions, it will appear as all widescreen features do, but for 16:9 screens it is a major disappointment.",1223856000,21,611,4.980392156862745

The scientists on the episodes are able to explain very complex topics in a relatively easy to understand way.

It's amazing that they can explain such complex topics so that the average non-scientist can gain some understanding of those forces. Granted, without a degree in Physics it is impossible to understand it all.

3396730,4,B0016OKQOO,My reason is that it's interesting. I feel it could have been a little more with some better data on the subjects which it talks about. Don't get me wrong as just the way it is good also.,1396396800,,187,3.9473684210526314

3396735,4,B0016OKQOO,"Very interesting. I like to watch these type of shows, but I look on with the thought that practically all of the presentation is based on theory, and theories are subject to changed with added knowledge.

Sometimes a little to discounting of intelligence and not wanting to be critical of ""how"" the the universe could start from a singularity, this series is still an excellent visual depiction of our place in the cosmos.",1394755200,,345,5.0701754385964914

3396739,5,B0016OKQOO,"Really enjoy this series but not so happy with the way the dramatize things. I know they like to scare people to get ratings but it's not necessary in a series like this. So many interesting and amazing facts about the universe. Dramatize in the grandeur, the beauty and awesome scale of the universe. Another thing is the speakers. They present Dark Matter as if it's a fact when there is much controversy over the Dark Matter theory.
I know.. nitpicking but.. that's my opinion. Still enjoy the series very much.",1393200000,,514,4.65934065934066

3396742,5,B0016OKQOO,These programs are well thought out. Each episode covers a topic in enough detail to teach you facts you more than likely never learning in school.

3396750,5,B0016OKQOO,This is one of my favorite series that explains the universe. The graphics and examples present the information in a form that makes it easy to remember fun facts. The newer seasons include information that has been updated with the advances in science that was not available or known in the earlier or older seasons. There are a lot of different series out that include much of the same information and also have great graphics but I find that The Universe spends more time/episodes going more thoroughly through a subject and that gives a better all around understanding on the subject,1387670400,,587,4.821782178217822

While some of it isn't completely accurate and sometimes they dumb down things a bit too much, it's still one of the better space documentaries available simply because it covers so many different subjects.

3396782,5,B0016OKQOO,"The History Channel delivers with the series The Universe.  So far, through 2010, there have been five seasons.  Probably my favorite is Season Two, which aired from November 2007 to April 2008.

Here are the individual episodes in Season Two:

Alien Planets
Cosmic Holes
Mysteries Of The Moon
The Milky Way
Alien Moons
Dark Matter/Dark Energy
Astrobiology
Space Travel
Supernovas
Constellations
Unexplained Mysteries
Cosmic Collisions
Colonizing Space
Nebulas
Wildest Weather In The Cosmos
Biggest Things In Space
Gravity
Cosmic Apocalypse

Each episode is well done and easy to understand.  I had two astronomy courses in college, so I had pretty good knowledge of astronomy before ever viewing this series.  However, I don't feel that the narrator and scientists/scholars dumb everything down for the viewing audience.  Astronomy is a complex subject that can be quite technical and hard to understand at times, so I think the comments by scientists throughout the series strike a good balance - not too technical, not too simple.  Just right.

Throughout the series you'll hear fascinating facts, theories, and explanations.  You'll see well done computer generated images of everything in the cosmos - moons, stars, galaxies, nebulas, planets, etc.  My favorite episodes in this second season are Wildest Weather In The Cosmos, The Milky Way, Mysteries Of The Moon, Nebulas, Supernovas, and Cosmic Holes.

I highly recommend this second season as well as the entire series.",1296864000,3,1478,5.373913043478261

3396784,5,B0016OKQOO,"All of the Universe series is awesome.  This season is spectacular as well.  The narration will take you from elementary concepts to abstract aspects of our universe and offers insight from the greatest minds of our time.  I watch plenty of documentaries and this series ranks as my favorite along with ""Cosmos.""  If you are looking for an updated and expanded version of Carl Sagan's series or are just an astronomy enthusiast, this series will not let you down.",1294617600,,463,4.822784810126582

3396791,1,B0016OKQOO,"The second season CVD set is even worse than the first: made for selling American commercial advertising, each break is punctuated with a cliff-hanging ""guess what's next"" followed by a mini-rehash of what has been said so as to remind the viewer of where the last scene left off a few seconds earlier. Terrible editing, at best. The science is superficial, the photography occasionally breathtaking, but repeated over and over to loud crashing sounds - they even point out that there is no sound in space, but pay no attention to their own series!

Do consider waiting for the BBC to produce a stronger offering. If view it you must, rent a copy, don't buy - you're unlikely to want to view it again. Can you believe an astronomy scientist whose hair is tinted red and whose hobby is belly dancing can really be given credence when she tries to demonstrate a principle of gravity and motion whilst in costume? Attenborough has a sense of decorum . . . and doesn't talk down to his audience.",1266364800,3,991,4.630681818181818

3396793,5,B0016OKQOO,Everyone that has an interest in astronomy or even science should own this. The material is very educational and presented in a visually (Blu-Ray) stunning manner. Great for the Kids to watch.,1261612800,2,192,5.03125
3396794,1,B0016OKQOO,"I have to agree with the other reviewers on these Universe sets, however Season 1 was enjoyable to watch and we all learned a lot.  In these series, yes, they have interesting parts embedded in the LOUD music and flashy graphics and they need appropriate BACKGROUND music and SUBTITLES -- graphics need to be less fast paced so that they viewer can enjoy parts of the galaxy.  Perhaps produce a 5-10 minute fast and loud version as an extra for each disk.  Some of the analogies (fast cars, jumps off cliffs or into caves, etc.) are difficult for foreign people to understand, but I realize that the History channel is for the general public and probably they are trying to keep everyone awake.  Still, one hopes for something of BBC quality for this type of series.  Perhaps with DVD technology these days they could have a selection for background music-- classical, heavy metal, country, jazz.",1255564800,,896,4.754838709677419
3396795,4,B0016OKQOO,"The History Channel knows science, and they're good at making complex systems and ideas easy to understand - and approachable - for the everyday observer. The Universe, Complete Season Two on Blu-ray is no exception. This four-disc set features all 18 episodes, nearly 15 hours of content, including covering topics like Dark Matter, Exoplanets, Cosmic Collisions, Supernovas, and more. And while episodes are only loosely tied together by the fact that the subjects covered are part of - or take place in - our universe, it doesn't seem overly odd or disjointed- especially for the younger viewers.

Fantastic phenomena and alien worlds are re-created through extremely realistic computer animation, which is shockingly detailed and stunningly beautiful. The visuals take viewers inside wonders that man has only viewed from afar, giving a close-up look at the fascinating inner workings of the cosmos around us.

The series also includes documentary style interviews with experts in the field, as well as footage from both past and current scientific exploration programs and an introduction to some of the tools and devices these scientists use to explore the universe. A nice contrast to the computer re-creations, this live-action documentary aspect of the series does a good job of providing balance, grounding the concepts and reminding viewers that there are actual people working to find answers and discover new information about the space around us- it's not simply Star Trek.

Whether used as an educational tool or simply for entertainment value, The Universe - Season Two on Blu-ray is interesting and enthralling.

Special Features

There aren't a lot of ""extras"" on The Universe, but given the nature of the series - and the fact that it is a television series - that's not surprising. There is one Bonus Feature, a featurette called Backyard Astronomers, which explores the world of amateur star-gazers- men and women who spend their spare time learning about - and exploring - the universe... from their backyards.

The biggest benefit to the Blu-ray release lies in the presentation - true widescreen and HD.

And of course the subject matter itself.",1253232000,12,2169,5.23342939481268

3396798,2,B0016OKQOO,"Consisted largely of several re-hashed scenes from other shows and Season 1.  If Season 1 were 4.5/5.0, Season 2 is 2.5/5.0.  I have higher hopes for Season 3.",1248825600,8,159,4.642857142857143
3396799,5,B0016OKQOO,"Very informative, educational, interesting, and fun!  The special effects and great narrative performance makes this show my favorite.  This is by far the best TV series I have ever seen.  I have watch every episode multiple times.  Another great thing about this show is that it includes some of the greatest physicist of today, such as Michio Kaku.  I highly recommended anybody who is even slightest interested in the final frontier to add this DVD set to their collection.",1248739200,,476,4.974683544303797
3396800,5,B0016OKQOO,I've bought all 3 seasons and totally enjoy everyone of them.  You can see the graphics and visuals improve with each season.  The information contained is presented in an entertaining and informative way.,1244505600,,205,5.181818181818182
3396801,4,B0016OKQOO,"This documentary is phenomenal!
The visuals look very realistic!
I wish they used more actual footage.",1241654400,,102,5.4375
3396802,5,B0016OKQOO,"An informative series on the universe. The episodes are presented in very captivating ways to keep viewer interest on the screen. This includes the way the narration is presented, soundtrack, and the many computer graphic animations to illustrate the concepts presented.",1241222400,,270,5.609756097560975
3396803,5,B0016OKQOO,This is a great series if you are interested in space and physics.  I can watch them over and over and never tire of the information and manner of presentation.,1240099200,,160,4.333333333333333
3396804,3,B0016OKQOO,"I thoroughly enjoyed the season 1 DVDs, but after viewing the first DVD of The Universe - The Complete Season Two, I was exhausted -- to the point of wishing it would end so I could be in peace again.  The music was so overpowering that, in my experience, it distracted from the science. Perhaps this is a result of the fact that I have not watched TV for the last 25 years and have not become desensitized to the intense soundtrack of such programs.  I have decided to take a bit of time to recover from that auditory assault before I continue with disks 2,3,4 and 5.",1236556800,8,568,4.25
3396805,2,B0016OKQOO,"I bought this DVD set  for a U3A (University of the 3rd Age) discussion group on Astronomy, but it has been a major failure. The group only tolerated half of one DVD (The Milky Way). The audience, all over 70, could hardly hear the commentary because it was overwhelmed by very loud background sounds of booms and weird electronic noises - more like modern so-called music than the silence of a space vacuum. The graphics were terrible - fast zooms, rotations explosions and rapid strangeness which presumably come from video games. Astronomical images have a grandeur and beauty which has nothing to do with this teen-age idea of changes too fast for the brain to take in. It would be much better to use real Hubble images and professional pictures created from radio telescopes, gamma ray receptors and infra-red, which have to be derivatives since we cannot see in those wave-lengths. Such images were there, but only briefly flashed and usually over-layed with some nerd's idea of what space might be like, but is not.  Numerous outstanding images from professional astronomers are available on the internet without need to artificially derive anything jazzy and noisy. The information from the commentators is excellent and right up to date - for those of us who could actually hear it. The BBC do these sorts of programs superbly and we will be looking to change over to their versions since 15 people were unanimous they did want to see or hear any more like this.",1235347200,12,1471,4.833333333333333
3396806,4,B0016OKQOO,The substance in this package is very interesting and up to date and the pictures were reasonably clear. What irritates me is the program stops followed by some repetition before continuation. It is clear that this is where the TV commercials where broadcasted. I wish that those repetitions were cut with the commercials because they disturb the concentration and reminds you of the hated commercials.,1233446400,4,402,5.2
3396807,5,B0016OKQOO,"Wonderfully presented series. The computer simulations, actual footage and data, and accompanying explanations are easy to understand and absorb. As well as Awe-inspiring, the series captivates you with the most recent discoveries and information. After watching many other similar documenteries I thought I had seen it all, until watching this series. This series had so much more than I had thought. Great as a gift to a young budding enthusiast, an old one, or even for the Astronomy Collection at home. I've already recommended it to my friends, and see myself watching this series many more times.",1233014400,,602,5.216494845360825
3396808,5,B0016OKQOO,"First off, please note, I don't have cable and have never seen this program on television before but when Amazon suggested it in my Recommendations I went ahead and ordered it, series unseen.  Whereas there can sometimes be contradictions in the facts (one person says there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy...another says there are 400 billion) overall the amount and variety of information and topics covered is extremely well done. I have bought seasons 1 and 2 now and am looking forward to the release of season 3. Shoot, I've been thinking of getting a blu-ray player just so I can start ordering series like this in blu-ray.  If nothing else, I like to just put a disc on...mute the tv...put on some great music...and use the program as an excellent source for beautifully stunning visuals.  At this point, I love this series.
P.s. I also like the steelbook casing since it seems much sturdier than the usual cardboard/plastic ones.",1231372800,2,942,4.802469135802469
3396809,5,B0016OKQOO,"This is the second season of one of the best science programs from the History channel.

It presents the science accurately and in detail and gives you an excellent overview of astronomy and cosmology.

More importantly, it captures the excitement of scientific discovery better than most science video. You get an inside look at the process of discovery.

Get a copy of this series. You will want to watch it again and again.",1229731200,,426,4.808219178082192

8263664,5,B0016OKQOO,This episode (along with the rest of the series) used to be included with my prime membership but is no longer available. But I find this episode to be the best one! It is fascinating but also puts me to sleep! Love this show! Wish they would bring it back for the prime membership! hint hint!,1500854400,,293,4.25
8263665,5,B0016OKQOO,This is an old season of the Universe and even though some area are dated it is still interesting and informative. I have watched it several time since I received it. I still recommend it to other like minded people.,1487980800,,216,4.425
