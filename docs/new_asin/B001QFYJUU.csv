Strange review too saying she somewhat resembles a male figure, guess the reviewer never saw all the women in kickboxing class. Women have strong bodies and they named a city after her that's how important she was to the ancient world. She counsels people to gentleness, but teaches defensive warfare to protect the virginity of cities and your own body and being. Please help us make and protect GENUINE information about alternative religions. The won't let us talk it appears. Please help us in the red states, we have no alternative information, it is all reprinted and altered with christian propaganda from goddesses made to look evil, to saying that the women are like males so that we (OH MY GOD!) don't break their gender rules and become fire breathing dragons that look like beasts. Get it? They wear drag. Put your drag on. You are not a beast when you break their slave gender clothes and attitude rules. They do this as deliberate psyche warfare against little girls to make the soft rape toys for their male supremacist christian predators. Please allow our opinions out there. Why is it that any christian can talk online but we can't give our opinions?",1353542400,,1281,4.907834101382488
