5819915,4,B00DJYJOPG,"""Fill the Void"" (2012 release from Israel; 90 min.) brings a very intimate look into the world of Israel's ultra-Orthodox Hasidic community. As the movie opens, we get to know Shira, an 18 year old woman who is keeping her eyes open about her marriage options (she secretly has her eyes on a young man whom she meets from afar in the dairy section of the grocery store). We also get to know Shira's older sister Esther, who is nine months pregnant with her first-born and due any minute. Then disaster strikes and Esther dies in labor, leaving a big void to fill in the lives of her loved ones: her sister Shira, her mother, and of course her husband Yochay, not to mention the new-born baby. It's not long thereafter that Yochay is contemplating offers for a new marriage, including one from Belgium, as well as one from Frieda, a friend of Shira's and Esther's, and also Shira herself at the insistence of Shira's and Esther's mother. At this point we are only about 30 minutes into the movie. What will Yochay decide to do? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is a labor of love from writer-director Rama Burshtein, who seemingly has poured her heart and soul into bringing this movie to life, and with great results. Second, we get a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community as never before. At no time do the characters feel forced or over the top, but instead they feel so authentic that at several times during the movie I was wondering if these were actors, or real-life ultra-Orthodox people. Third, kudos to Hadas Yaron in the role of Shira and also Yiftach Klein in the role of Yochay, as they bring fantastic performances, in particular Yaron as the young/vulnerable/confused Shira is just superb. This movie was Israel's entry for Best Foreign Movie in this year's Oscar nominations, and it's easy to see why.

Bottom line: ""Fill the Void"" is a very moving family drama that just happens to be set in the ultra-Orthodox community of Tel Aviv. I will admit I was moved to tears on several occasions while watching this movie. This movie opened recently at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati and I am glad to tell you that the screening I saw this at was quite well attended, indicating there may be a strong demand for this movie. Meanwhile, ""Fill the Void"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1374105600,55,2464,4.662068965517242

5819962,1,B00DJYJOPG,"This movie has a very creepy plot. It stops short of becoming a horror film, but I would have appreciated some logic in the storyline, which never seemed to materialize. The director is also a little too attached to cinematography tricks from film school 101. I hope she gets more opportunities to film happier stories to mature her style.",1492819200,,339,4.762711864406779

I felt peace and love at the end.",1489536000,,294,5.125
5819995,5,B00DJYJOPG,"One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.  Subtle.  Poignant.  Human.  Living in NYC, and often seeing Hassidim in the city, I've often been 'intrigued' by them and find them so 'mysterious'.  So this film really helped to humanize the Hassidim for me.  However, I must say I'm also very curious now, as to 'how' this film was made.  Were all the actors Hassidim, and if so, how did their religion or rabbis allow for them to participate in this film?  I do know that they tend to be very insular, so this is why I am a bit stymied that this film was actually made.

Either way, I highly recommend this film for those who love non-Hollywood type film, or art-house type movies.",1487635200,,683,4.4

5819997,5,B00DJYJOPG,"What a fabulous, socially insightful movie. I watched it and then restarted it immediately and watched it again. There is a powerful simplicity and purity in the lives of the family that is irresistible. And behind all the hats and coats, are wonderful complex and genuine human beings that you will identify with and love. Indeed the community's faith is tested to the limit, as they all try to deal with what life has thrown at them. However, the strength of community and the importance of family is what I really got out of it all. The wonderful actors bring the required authenticity that this movie demands, and the Director requires all of our praise...more of the same please. If I could give it ten stars I would.",1486684800,,722,4.6484375

5820001,5,B00DJYJOPG,"Wow. This is a beautifully written and beautifully performed story about the complexity of real moral questions. In this film - as in the best stories - nothing is neatly resolved and tied up with a little bow. It's very messy, and that's what makes it fascinating, poignant and very moving. Here, what initially seems to be a simple issue is not so simple, as layers of questions and meanings are peeled away.  A few reviewers here were perplexed by the ending scene. I thought the ending is perfect: it invites the viewer to wonder what lies ahead, as does Life.",1483660800,,564,4.584158415841584

5820183,5,B00DJYJOPG,"A really unique film. I do not think the director would like me saying this but, Yiftakh Klein, Yochay, would do a very good job if another authentic Jesus of Nazareth film were to be produced. The next time they do The IV Evangelists with serious production quality I think this Yiftakh Klein has the poential to do a Jesus that is worthy of Orthodoxy weather it is Roman Orthodoxy or Greek Orthodoxy. If they could put a Rembrandt on film Yochay would do a good job. I enjoyed the film because I like Religous Jews that are actually Jewish. When Christians need epic and quality Chirst films ironically Religous Jews even indirectly portray the most reverent Jesus movies. Cheers to the director, Hadas Yaron and Yiftakh Klein. I hope he does a worthy Jesus movie. Well done.",1447286400,,777,4.63768115942029

5820190,4,B00DJYJOPG,"The excellent, heartrending movie springs from the singular vision of writer/director, Rama Burshtein.  One of the few devoutly Orthodox women making films today, Ms. Burshtein brings a unique perspective to this project.  Her deep, rich understanding of this community shows in every frame.  Her camera shows us all the small rituals, all the social interactions and all the layers of complexity and meaning that make up this devout corner of Judaism.

Hadas Yaron - a secular Jew in real life - does a wonderful job here portraying the frum, flowering sister.  There's an important age gap here between Ms. Yaron's Shira and older sister Esther (the choreographer Renana Raz doing one of her occasional screen turns).  Esther is the beautiful older sister (""The most beautiful person in the world"" as an adoring Shira refers to her at one point), Shira always the notably younger ""little sister.""  These dynamics are important because when tragedy befalls Esther, our little duckling Shira is slowly thrust into a role that at first seems very unsuited for her.  Neither she nor the audience can at first accept her as Esther's replacement.

I loved the casting here. Irit Sheleg and Chayim Sharir are superb as parents Rivka and Aharon.  They are bulwarks of the community and love both of their daughters equally.  [Wow, I just learned that Ms. Sheleg is Dana Ivgy's mom, WHAAAAT??]  The amazing Purim scene -- with Sharir literally heading the table and Sheleg looking on in the background and basically running the books...that scene alone -- an incredibly deep, rich dive into tradition -- is worth the price of admission in this movie.  It's a superb piece of filmmaking from Rama Burshtein.",1442620800,7,1699,5.025

It is an eloquent, beautiful film, with a hauntingly magnificent choral theme song: ""Im Eshkachacheich Yerushalayim.""  The film portrays exquisite intimacy in an ultra-orthodox community; passion, sensitivity, empathy, internal and external pressures, with a lovely satisfying redemptive finale.  Like a classical symphony, it builds slowly with a quiet palpable crescendo towards its resolution. The extraordinary subtext of this film is the portrayal of the role (and influence,  and shall I say ""power""?) of the women, in what is, after all, a highly patriarchal religious community.  Gorgeous film!",1433030400,,711,5.742857142857143

Let me start by saying that I have always been interested in other cultures and customs from an early age, so a movie about a Jewish Orthodox family caught my eye. What I loved most about this picture aside from the breathtaking cinematography and story line, was the almost documentary landscape of the film. I felt like a guest in their home the whole time the story was unfolding. I cried buckets during this film like I was on ""Oprah"". I loved every minute of this picture and didn't want it to end.

It was in Hebrew with subtitles, and about a very different culture than my own. All that said, it was a compelling movie that held me riveted from the start, mostly because of the ethical quandary facing young Shira, and the thoughtful and nuanced performances by the cast.. Bravo! The only question I have from the movie was about the character Frieda. She was shown as one who would probably never marry because no male wanted to marry her. My question: What the heck was wrong with Frieda? I thought she was beautiful. Other than being flummoxed by that, I thought it was a truly wonderful film.",1422057600,,720,4.462121212121212

5820272,5,B00DJYJOPG,"Not what you'd expect. This is a terrific film, and the young woman who plays the lead is wonderful. It's a strange story about a girl who's sister dies in childbirth. She cares for her nephew, of course, and her mother wants her to marry her brother-in-law.

5820292,4,B00DJYJOPG,"Marriage has fallen a long way down in Western culture. However,its a surprise when we find it treated with the reverence of an orthodox Jewish community in Tel Aviv,written and directed by a member of that community,Rama Burstein,who wrote and directed it. This is about an arranged marriage in the Haredi tradition,a way of cementing social order. The film opens with Shira(Hadras Yaron),daughter of Rabbi Aharon,accompanied by her mother Rivka(Irit Sheleg) to glimpse a prospective young husband in a supermarket. The fact of marriage is presented as a source of joy,not romantic love or sexual attraction. Shira glows with the prospect of union with the solemn stranger chosen for her. Shira shares her joy with her pregnant older sister Esther and Esthers husband,Yochay(Yiftak Klein).

The director has left open through a form of comic suggestion that the female is not obliged to accept the suggestions of parents and Rabbis:women are pressured to make the decision at the right time,but the decision of whom to marry is theirs. Esther dies giving birth to a son,Mordechai. It is announced that plans are afoot for Yochay to remarry,which will mean him moving to Belgium with Mordechai. Rivka suggests he might marry Shira instead. Yochay is far better-looking than the man she would have married, and hes a romantic and tender soul,however he has a child and has been married before. There is a kind of chemistry between him and the soft-spoken, accordion-playing Shira. There are scenes between the two where there is a conflict between erotic desire and truthfulness and duty,with the former winning out. The film is finely acted,Sudris cinematography creates a distinctive and seductive visual style,with shallow focus,low angles and highly composed groupings. Worth a look for fans of Jane Austen.",1407628800,6,1810,5.241379310344827

There is no real suggestion of the pain people suffer when closed communities use power and exile to ensure that everyone does what they are 'supposed to do'.  Great if you have won the prize of a loving caring relationship and support - pretty rough if you are not happy and want to change something.  I googled distress of leaving the hasidic community after watching this and was shocked to see how people have been treated - especially by the New York Hasidic Community - because it uses its power over others.  So much for love of God and leaving God to be the judge of each person's heart.  Yes bits of it were enjoyable but it is part a fairy tale and is not HONEST about difficulties - dangerous for young and vulnerable women.,1405814400,,947,4.514619883040936
5820305,4,B00DJYJOPG,"It would be a mistake to think that since this very interesting Israeli film depicts pious Orthodox Hasidic Jews involved in a domestic drama, and since the film offers viewers many scenes of Hasidic practices, the views of the people in the drama reflect the views of Orthodox Hasidic Jews. Let me make this clear.

The story is about a somewhat mature couple in an Israeli Hasidic community. The wife is very pregnant. The husband is very loving, and we see him expressing his love while somewhat drunk. His being somewhat drunk is significant because it plays a role in the final parts of the film  about which I will not comment so as not to be a spoiler. The wife dies during childbirth but he son survives and is raised by the dead wifes mother  although his father visits frequently. After some months pass, the childs father decides he wants to remarry and is offered a woman in Belgium, apparently from a rich family.

The deceased wife has two sisters. The older of the two is not very attractive and has difficulty finding a husband. The younger sister is attractive, but quite young. If I remember correctly, she is only sixteen, much younger than the husband of her dead sister.
Her mother who has been raising the child and who has become attached to it does not want to lose the child. She does not want her son-in-law to leave Israel and settle in Belgium. She wants his to remain in Israel so she can continue at least in some ways to raise her late daughters child.

Her desire is the motivating factor of the plot. It is a normal emotion  albeit somewhat exaggerated. Both her emotion and how she attempts to keep her son-in-law in Israel have nothing to do with Hasidic Jews.

She decides, against the advice of her husband and her rabbi to marry her youngest daughter to her son-in-law. But the young girl does not want to marry him. Her son-in-law also feels that the girl is too young for him. This does not stop the mother from perusing her plan. She then suggests her other daughter, the one who is not attractive, but her son-in-law rejects this proposal.
The film depicts how her behavior affects everyone, especially her daughter. A possible interpretation of the title Fill the Void is the need to fill the void in the lives of the mother, son-in-law, and young daughter.",1404345600,,2300,4.581508515815085

5820309,4,B00DJYJOPG,"Set in an orthodox Hasidic Jewish community in Tel Aviv, FILL THE VOID centers around eighteen-year-old Shira's (Haldas Yaron), decision about whether to marry widower Yochay (Yiftach Klein) or not.  Yochay was already married to her sister Esther (Renana Raz), but sadly Esther passed away during childbirth.  The title sums up the film's principal theme: by following her family's fishes, Shira will fill the void created by Esther's passing, and hence become a good mother to Esther and Yochay's newly-born son Mordecai.  Morally speaking, she believes she is doing the right thing by accepting Yochay's offer, but director Rama Burshtein asks us to reflect on whether the decision will fill the void in Shira's life, or simply deepen it.  Issues of love never seem to enter Shira's mind; she believes she is obliged to marry, and hence works hard to persuade the rabbi (Melech Thal) to sanction her decision.  The film is tightly constructed as a series of close-ups and two-shots: the camera gives us a unique insight into Shira's turbulent state of mind, as she sits opposite Yochay, her head bowed, her lip quivering as she tries her best to maintain a facade of calm.  Her family offer her a limited amount of support, but it's clear that they are forcing her into marriage.  The only way she can obtain succor is to pray to God: in one sequence she is photographed from above, her eyes staring into the camera, as she tries to listen to His word.  The ending is quite achingly poignant; in her wedding dress, Shira looks stunningly beautiful, but she cannot sit still.  Her body repeatedly rocks from left to right, almost as if she is trying to lull herself into a trance-like state to cope with her forthcoming ordeal.  Burshtein cuts to the wedding ceremony, where her head is covered with a white sheet; she is quite literally blinded to what follows, while the families celebrate.  The film ends with the now-married couple alone after the ceremony has concluded.  They stand at either end of the room and Shira stares blankly into space, underlining the irony inherent in the film's title.  A low-key film, but totally compelling nonetheless.",1398816000,,2157,4.892857142857143

5820353,5,B00DJYJOPG,"Rama Burshtein breaks new ground in her affecting and emotionally satisfying film, ""Fill the Void,"" about a family of Chasidim who live in Tel Aviv.  Yochay and his wife, Esther, are blissfully happy parents-to-be. When Esther tragically passes away during childbirth, her widower  depends on his late wife's family to help care for his new baby boy.  However, as the months pass, Yochay's mother encourages him to look for a new wife.  One candidate lives in Belgium, and if Yochay were to marry her, he would leave Israel with his son.

Rivka, Esther's mother, comes up with a better idea.  Why shouldn't Yochay marry Esther's eighteen-year-old sister, Shira (sensitively portrayed by the luminous Hadas Yaron), even though Shira had been looking forward to making a match with someone closer to her own age? At first, Shira rejects her mother's proposal.  In fact, Shira insists that marrying her brother-in-law would be morally wrong.  Shouldn't she care for her future husband, not just ""fill the void"" left by her deceased sibling?  Complicating matters further, Rivka's single sister and an unmarried friend named Frida offer unsolicited opinions about who Yochay's next wife should be.

How easy it would have been for Burshtein to create a melodramatic and predictable movie that reinforces the usual stereotypes about Chasidim: that they are all sexist, cloistered, and buttoned-down people who are unworldly and impractical,  However, instead of relying on clichs, Burshtein's script is surprisingly nuanced.  Furthermore, she elicits understated and realistic performances from her uniformly fine cast.  Not only does the director capture the warmth and caring of the Chasidic community, but she enhances our enjoyment of the film by inserting delightfully humorous scenes and constructing a poignant and engrossing plot that never becomes overly sentimental.  Burshtein makes good use of pauses and body language to express deep emotion. Not everything is spelled out, nor does it need to be.  ""Fill the Void"" demonstrates that Chasidim, like the rest of us, have conflicts, needs, dreams, and desires This a beautiful movie, with fine cinematography, authentic costumes, an evocative score, and an ambiguous ending that leaves us pondering the significance of what we have just seen.",1397692800,5,2297,5.377094972067039

Shira is torn about marrying her sister's husband because she feels guilty.

5820385,3,B00DJYJOPG,"Cultural films offer us a deeper insight into worlds we otherwise know little about, and so for that reason alone, I love to discover little films like Fill the Void.  Tense family dramas are also very much my cup of tea, and so I was all set to really enjoy (even love) this little talked about film from director Rama Burshtein.

I expected a little more than this.

Im not saying that Fill the Void doesnt offer us a languid story and one that is actually quite interesting, but (and no pun intended here) there is a void that the film never really fills.  There are so many intriguing aspects of this story and so many wonderful plot points and yet they all feel somewhat barren in the end because the film lacks the needed shading and the needed fleshing out to make all of these facets come together strongly.  There is the base plot, that central theme that runs through and it is, in a way, developed well enough, but everything revolving around it needed more time to stew (or a sharper, tighter script that could have developed it quicker) and instead creates a film that feels underdeveloped and somewhat forgettable.

Fill the Void tells the story of a young Hasidic Jewish woman, Shira, who early in the film sets her sights on a young man (the opening scene has her spying on him from a distance with her mother) and while he seems slightly, off, she is in love with the idea of pursuing marriage and starting her life.  Hes young and has promise and would be her own.  Her family pushes forward with arranging the marriage, but then tragedy strikes.  Her aunt, who is heavy with child, dies leaving a newborn and a widower.  Shiras mother begins to panic when her sisters surviving husband, Yochay, begins to seek a wife that may take him away from their country and cause her to lose her nephew.  Latching on to that baby as the only remaining piece of her sister, Shiras mother just cannot allow this to happen.  So, she begins to meddle and in doing so she strips Shira of her prospects of marrying a man her own age and proposes to give her to Yochay.  Shira is not keen on this, and Yocahy is unsure of it himself, and then there are other voices in the mix, like a disabled Aunt and a lonely young woman waiting for her day.

From a purely cultural angle, Fill the Void covers a lot of bases, and one very significant one (arranged marriage) and from a purely emotional angle it covers just as many and one very significant one (true loss and dispair) but it is in all those details missing that the film falters a bit.  Shiras mother, while a force (and Irit Shelegs performance is very strong) needed more time to develop, and the fact that she becomes the most interesting aspect of the film (thanks to such a strong performance) takes away from the core story.  Coloring the story with all these other plot points (and they are GOOD plot points) only works if they feel developed enough to propel the story.

I just wanted something more.

Still, there are many reasons to enjoy this and from a technical angle it is rather impressive (so glossy, so pretty) and those costumes are just marvelous, but at the end of the day I feel like this had more story to tell and it didn't go there for me.",1389312000,,3218,4.425423728813559

The main characters are Shira and Yochay.  A match is proposed between Shira and Yochay when Shira's sister, Yochay's wife, passes away.  Shira's decision making process goes back and forth, back and forth.  I enjoyed the acting and truly was fascinated by the culture this film portrays.

But, the ending...  The ending just ENDS!  I found myself wanting to understand better whether the parties involved were happy in the end or not.  Shira's look in the last scene made my stomach cringe and cry.  I'm being careful not to give anything away.  At the end, I felt so confused and puzzled.

5820492,4,B00DJYJOPG,"One reason to view FILL THE VOID, written and directed by Rama Burshtein, is the opportunity to view the clothing, the mannerisms, the singing (endless), and the other unique characteristics of Israel's ultra-Orthodox Hasidic community. For those who have never witness this spectrum of Judaism it is an eye-opening experience: religious law, tradition and the rabbi's word are absolute. Marriages are arranged and a woman's outside options are limited, as marriage is a central and crucial moment in their lives. Matches are arranged, decisions about whom to marry are critically important, but apparently the woman always has the right to turn down a prospective suitor. Of importance to note, Rama Burshtein comes form this community and her understanding of all the permutations is obvious.

Shira (Hadas Yaron), a devout 18-year-old Israeli, has come of age and is considering marriage, having met her first serious suitor Yossi (Ido Samuel). Shira's eldest sister Esther (Renana Raz) suddenly dies in childbirth leaving her grieving husband Yochay (the very handsome and talented Yiftach Klein) with a son and no mother to care for the infant. Despite his grief (and the grief of Shira's parents - Irit Sheleg and Chayim Sharir) Yochay decides he must marry. Shira's other sister Frieda (Hila Feldman) declares that Esther had informed her that should anything happen to Esther, Frieda should marry Yochay. Shira's mother, afraid that Yochay will take the offer from a Belgium woman to marry and thus move away with her grandson from Tel Aviv, encourages Shira to marry Yochay. Shira is conflicted, gains support from her armless unmarried aunt Hanna (Razia Israeli) who knows that in this community a woman MUST be married, and after much discussion among the Rabbi (Melech Thal) and the family and Yochay and Shira, a conversation between the couple seals their fate.

The acting is excellent, the cinematography often times seems flooded with light and slightly out of focus as if taken through layers of wedding veils (!), the costumes are amazing even they are the usual dress mode of this Hassidic community, and the attention to detail of such moments as Purim and Shabbat are immaculate. The seemingly endless amount of singing by the men does grow a bit wearisome and covers dialogue at times, but this is a fresh and fascinating view of love, traditions, and laws and the still viable personal choices in this colorful community.

5820493,2,B00DJYJOPG,"This is an utterly distasteful Israeli soap opera.  A young girl sacrificing herself for her family, filmed like an amateur theatric...with long, long pauses, and lots and lots of tears.  For masochists only.",1380931200,6,208,5.2727272727272725
5820494,3,B00DJYJOPG,"Fill the Void swept the Israeli Academy Awards, including four of the top awards. This is not entirely significant for international audiences unfamiliar with the year in Israeli cinema, but it does give weight to the appealing aspects of the film for foreign distribution. This is the type of film which is a revealing look at marital cultural traditions in Israeli, not unlike Ang Lee's debut, The Wedding Song, did for Chinese culture.

  Though it is these unique traditions and specific methods of matchmaking which makes Fill the Void a marketable film, the human element at the center of the story carries the film further than simple cultural exploration. Carrying the emotional load of the film is Hadas Yaron, who stars as Shira, an eighteen-year-old put in an impossible situation. Yaron won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival, as well as the Israeli Academy Awards, and it is her ability to capture the audience's sympathy which has drawn comparisons to the work of Jane Austen.

  Shira is the youngest girl in her family and has just turned eighteen, which opens up a world of possibilities for marriage. There are young men that are prospects for her, but this becomes somewhat insignificant when Shira's older sister, Esther (Renana Raz), dies during childbirth. Esther leaves behind a child and husband, Yochay (Yiftach Klein), who must consider marrying a widow from Belgium in order to take care of his child.

The option to have Shira marry Yochay in order to keep Esther's child close to the family is one which plays out slowly through the course of the film. It is not a decision taken lightly, and we watch Shira come to full terms with the sacrifice she will be making by considering this option. American audiences may struggle somewhat with the politics and patriarchal control driving the marital plans within the culture, but it is helped a great deal by making Shira the ultimate deciding factor in the final outcome.

First, there is the general yuck factor about the situation, a widower marrying his deceased wife's younger sister. In the film, the protagonists have to get over that. I admit, I can't, but it didn't interfere with my enjoying this thoroughly entrancing film. The characters are so richly portrayed (and well dressed) and the window into this closed world is lifted. Shira's ( the younger sister ) innocence and doubts never quite leave her, even in the final shot, but that is what drew me in.

What would you do if you were placed in a situation where your potential future well being and happiness came because of another's death?  How much does family loyalty and cultural norms mean to you in the face of your personal truth and honor?

Shira, the would be new wife of her sister's dead husband is confronted with these ethical issues.  The writer and actors masterfully show us the journey to the final decision.  This movie is also a  touching and sensitive snapshot of an orthodox jew's outlook on problem solving; such as  the community involvement, family closeness (sometimes positive, sometimes negative) and going to G-D in prayer for help.

5820501,5,B00DJYJOPG,"Edit 3/16:

Watched last for the umpteenth time last night and I feel I must address some of the bad reviewer's and even the good reviewers who missed the whole point of the story:

She was NOT pressured, forced, or even, as some GOOD reviews here say: sacrificing anything:

Rewatch, this time paying attention, and you have help on the DVD with the commentary which explains the intentions of the story clearly.

Being: at first she was not sure then she decided to say yes then the family went to the rabbi for his blessing the rabbi denied the match at that point for he felt at that point that she did not show the proper feelings of love yet.

It was only after a couple of heated encounters between the two that she came to realize on her own that she did love him and only then did she go back to that Rabbi to reveal that she was ready for the right reasons; because she'd come to love him. Only then could the match be sanctioned.

Last scene, ending: simply a young girl nervous about the consummation, nothing to do at all with any sort of regret or subjugation. Ridiculous.

Stop misinterpreting this glorious movie!

Review of the film:  Breathtaking, Absolute Perfection.  No more words needed.

Review of the Abhorrent Studio releasing this to the US home market:  (that would be Sony):
Horrid imbeciles who Must Be On Drugs.

They have deemed this glorious work of art to be only worth a DVD and are not releasing this at all on Blu-Ray.  You read that correctly.  Not a typo.  They should fire themselves for being so ignorant of the market of people who will actually spend money to purchase this masterpiece.

The discerning folk who love this film are exactly the demographic who  long ago switched to Blu-Ray and have tossed our outdated 1990's DVD players into the trash bin or buried them underground to be discovered in the future as the time capsule relic that DVD has been for some time now.

Good luck selling this in DVD format, Sony.

You have forced me to purchase the JAPANESE BOOTLEG BLU-RAY, which has double the resolution of your DVD and looks GORGEOUS.  It is money well-spent.  You Sony people are smoking some heavy weed during work hours; you need to stop.",1376956800,6,2196,4.534351145038168
