8093858,4,B000BXHHOS,"Beginning this first installment of a two part program is an abbreviated history of torture through the ages and asks questions such as why it still occurs today, where it is happening around the globe, and the resulting consequences after its use in various cases.

In a series of encapsulated stories, several different people are interviewed who had been detained or arrested for questionable reasons and then they were subjected to torture and abuses soon afterward.  The offenses committed by these alleged suspects are based on little or no credible evidence, outright fabrications, and oftentimes some are unfairly singled out due to their race, religion, or political views.

Certain locations spotlighted here that have been identified as using abuse and torture methods include Abu Ghraib prison, Guantanamo Bay, Uzbekistan, and East Timor.  As far as developed nations are concerned that are complicit in these types of activities, some of those exposed in this segment are the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and Japan.  Upon further examination, this program defines violations of international and domestic laws in regards to sending suspects to countries that openly participate in violence and torture.  More disturbing than that are the unethical techniques used to create plausible deniability in the event of major exposure.

The second installment of this documentary begins with a look at the surprising and perilous lengths that people and families will go to when attempting to escape an environment that is mired in poverty, oppression, torture, and famine.  This environment is North Korea and it is the sole focus of this segment for good reason due to its infamous history.  Things are so bad there that many who illegally escape into China are willing to risk the grave consequences if they get caught.

Closing out this documentary is a sobering look at police brutality and excessive force issues.  Several controversial incidents are looked at here along with the distressing fact that oftentimes, law enforcement members involved in these events are not made to answer for their conduct or they are acquitted in a trial, if there is one.

At three hours long, this program covers a lot of ground but it remains interesting throughout its duration.  The first of only two complaints I have is that the volume of the narration is louder than the volume of the rest of the material and this fluctuation is a little distracting.  My other complaint is that the flow of topics is a little unorganized in my opinion but not nearly enough to ruin the viewing experience.",1185408000,2,2604,5.139810426540285
