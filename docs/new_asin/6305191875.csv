986226,3,6305191875,"Picking up shortly after the original left off, Henry (now played by Neil Giuntoli) takes up with a married couple and their disturbed niece, where he gets involved with the husband's arson for hire scheme.  But arson only brings Henry so much joy, so he turns his new partner onto murder.  This has been edited from the theatrical release (I don't know why) so the violence has been toned down.  Again, the performances are good, but this one doesn't really grab you.  Hopefully we'll see the uncut version soon, which might improve things.  Penelope Milford (Coming Home) makes an early appearance as a victim.  DVD extras include director commentary, trailers, and movie facts.",987465600,11,680,4.9734513274336285
986227,2,6305191875,"HENRY 2 played UNRATED and UNCUT when it was first theatrically released.  MPI decided to cut most of the violence and gore out to get an R-Rating for the video and DVD release and the results are less than thrilling.  Every murder scene has been edited to the point where you see practically nothing (cutaways to the murderers' strained faces instead).  The movie in it's original form was quite a strong and grim follow-up to the classic original, but this abbreviated edition is practically worthless.  Maybe someday MPI will release the original uncut version, but I doubt it since most fans have already made up their minds that the movie sucks based only on seeing the edited version.  The DVD does have a behind-the-scenes featurette that does show several clips from the film of the UNEDITED murder scenes with blood spurting everywhere....isn't it funny that they can get away with an R-rated video release as long as the gore scenes are an ""extra"" and not actually IN the film.  What a crock.  On top of it all, the DVD's audio is slightly out-of-sync throughout leaving this viewer in a daze.",978307200,23,1103,4.773684210526316
986228,1,6305191875,"Shouldn't even have ""Henry"" in the title. Whereas the first was original, shocking and brilliant, the sequel is merely a joke. I had a  feeling it would not be any good before I rented it, but just had to see it  being such a fan of the original. Don't waste your time because it is  simply a bore. Watch the original again! I'm serious.
In relation to this  film: ""It is not always differnt and not always the same.""",965088000,15,417,4.2405063291139244
986229,2,6305191875,"After viewing the shocking original, I had high expectations for this film. This film lacks the intensity of the original and it wasn't the same without Michael Rooker as Henry.  It copies a lot from the first film and  just seems bland in comparison.",955238400,2,251,4.681818181818182
7884947,5,6305191875,"Neil Giuntoli does a good job of taking over from Michael Rooker as the lead character in this sequel to ""Henry"".  Also, I think it was one of Kate Walsh's early performances on film before she became known.  Kind of a ""B"" horror movie, but the acting is surprisingly good, with a lot of unintentional comedic lines thrown in that are good for a few laughs.  What do you expect from a movie that is set in the porti-potty industry, where the characters haul and clean them out during the day, and moonlight as torches to burn down buildings for the insurance money????  Hahaha  If you liked the original ""Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer"" as much as I did"", there's a good chance that you will like this one as well.",1483660800,,719,4.409090909090909
7884948,5,6305191875,Henry is the misunderstood psycopath who kills with no remorse. He looks for love in all of the wrong places.,1371254400,,109,4.5
7884949,2,6305191875,I think this movie makes no sense. It's about 2 guys who go around killing somebody to make them feel better when they get angry. To me it was pure nonsense.,1364688000,,157,4.096774193548387
7884950,5,6305191875,I found this movie to be alright but not as good as Rooker's play of Henry.  I mean I did it for the collection part but I will always consider the first one to be my top choice.,1316390400,,178,3.6842105263157894

7884952,3,6305191875,"While not a bad movie as many seem to believe, ""Henry 2"" of course doesn't compare to the classic original. The innovative, stark horror was there in the first film; it isn't present in any great degree in the sequel. So this is basically a good, standard thriller, a nice follow-up but not really the same type of film.",1209340800,,320,4.440677966101695
7884953,4,6305191875,Well are favorite Serial killer is back. This time he gets a job cleaning Port a Potties. This leads him to staying with the Husband and Wife who run the place. Cricket is the female lead who you just might reconize from Grey's Anatomys.(Kate Walsh) Any ways he discovers his boss is a Arsonist for hire. Well this is right Herny's alley he gets to burn things for cash. Well they run into problems at one of the sites and have to kill a couple of teens. Henery tries to lead his boss down a path of murder for fun. He follows at first but even with booze and drugs he finds he does not have the guts for it. Well as you can tell it a wild romp for Henry and his new friends. It does not have that same creepy feel as the first one but it does offer a pretty good second film. It still has those uneasy moments that make Henry a creepy kind of film. Just go into film knowing it is not as good as the first but still offers some good bits for a second edition in the life and times of are favorite Serial Killer.,1175040000,3,1012,3.9901477832512313
7884954,2,6305191875,"Solid cast, with the exception of the lead. Rooker from the first one should have been back, as well as the original director and writer: John McNaughton and Richard Fire, respectively.

This director here doesn't seem to get suspense--and it hurt the film. There is just no beating the original. Too bad McNaughton and the rest from the first flick did not come back for an encore--because now, even if they did, it might be way too late.

It's kind of sad, because McNaughton might have had a far bigger/impressive film career if he had.

Skip this one. See the original (20 year anni issue, etc.). It will give you chills.",1155686400,5,625,4.612612612612613
7884955,1,6305191875,"I got this in a Region 2 two disc set with both Henry 1 + 2 released by Dutch-Filmworks.  The original is great,  but ""mask of sanity""  was the worst bottom of the barrel el-cheapo z-grade attempt at a horror film I have ever been witness to.  No script (to speak of)  no talent and nothing to keep you watching it through to the end.  It also looks like it was shot on video tape....  Fans of the original will be mortified.",1093392000,3,425,4.109756097560975
