2564495,4,B000FGFURW,"Our now 20 month old daugther watches a BE DVD while getted her neb. treatments.  She has Cystic Fibrosis and her lung treatments can last almost an hour long, twice a day.  We have like 10-12 BE Dvds.  She loves the puppers!  Even mimics their sounds over talking.  I have to question some of the loctions in the main street part but over all she loved watched the Dog puppet doing stuff.  Was sitting there laughing.  I do wish they had more simipler signs for a younger toddler to learn; like- ""more""; ""all done""; etc.  Overall we are very impress with the BE DVDs.  Our daugther keeps still throughout the show.

I strongly suggest getting into BE Dvds if your child has to go through any type of treatments that can take a long time and they have to sit still.

2564496,5,B000FGFURW,"As with the first signing DVD, (See my review of that one) this one continues on with introducing sign language to little ones. My son really enjoys it. Though, like I stated in the review of the other signing DVD, we do Signing Exact English (SEE), not the signs this DVD uses. So, sometimes, the signs are different for us. This can sometimes be confusing for my son, because he sees the people on TV doing one sign, and I'm trying to show him the ""right"" one as pertains to SEE.

And also, one of the reviewers is right, a lot of these signs are a little complicated and not age appropriate. Some of the simpler signs should be explored. Ones that you use every day like food, water, drink, family names, stuff like that. Thank you for pointing that out. ;) I have a SEE book as well as a SEE CD rom, and if you check out [...], you can find those resources. I especially love the CD rom, because you can transcribe sentences and learn them easily. The book is great too! Very good dictionary.

The one thing that still nags at me a little about these two Baby Einstein DVDs is that while they have a deaf person sign the words, I have yet to see a child with any kind of disability be featured on these DVDs, or any of them for that matter. It would be nice to see a child, like my son (who has hearing aids), demonstrate some of the signs. People with disabilities don't have to hide from society. They are a vital part of it, and are a great blessing to us all, no matter what handicap the world views them to have. We need to see these blessed people more often, so they can teach us all they have to offer! They are so pure of heart, and are the last people in the world that we should be ashamed of!

While these minor comments of mine are valid ones, it still won't change the fact that these are still good DVDs worth getting. I hope they continue making the signing ones, especially, and that they will consider taking steps up in them.

I'm glad they are doing these DVDs because signing is such a great way of communication. Children can learn to sign before they even speak, and it helps them to be less frustrated and better able to communicate what they want and need when they don't have verbal word power.

I just hope more people see the benefit of sign, and go beyond the ""trendiness"" of it. I hope those that take interest and learn it will find it inspiring and fun, and continue to use it and be inspired by those who live with it and use it every day!

Get these DVDs, as well as the entire Baby Einstein series. My son has benefitted so much from them!! Kids repeatedly watch things over and over, so why not have them watch something that will stimulate them and help them be smarter? That isn't an exaggeration either! My son never ceases to amaze me with his knowledge at the tender age of 3! He's known numbers and letters since 2-2 1/2 and it's in LARGE part to this video series, as well as their books and toys!",1155859200,2,2944,4.229537366548043
2564497,5,B000FGFURW,"As a new buyer of Baby Einstein, I was very impressed with it. The words and signs presented were easy enough for my 2 year old son to grasp, and for the two weeks we have had this title, he has started signing me some of the words (especially the easier ones, like store.) The only warning I have for this DVD is that your child will want to watch Baby Einstein over and over again; this, however, is very good becuase I would rather have my son learning sign language that watching other movies that have to eduational value.",1155427200,,527,4.28
2564498,2,B000FGFURW,"As a counselor for families with young babies, I have had the opportunity to review a number of language programs (both sign and verbal) for preverbal babies and babies who are just beginning to verbalize.

As with Baby Wordsworth the production quality of this DVD is excellent, however the words and signs presented are not appropriate for either preverbal babies who are trying to communicate basic wants and needs or toddlers who are beginning to speak. Instead of offering words and signs such as eat, drink, milk, more, mommy, daddy, baby etc. - this program presents bank, florist, bakery, etc.  Not only is the choice of words and signs questionable but the visual distinctions between scenes such as cafe, restaurant, and market is difficult for a baby to understand.

The format is also geared towards older children.  Five words and signs are presented in rapid succession and then extended scenes for each word are shown.  Then the same five words and signs are offered again by a child of four years or older.  In addition, the signs themselves are difficult for young babies as most of the signs are combinations of more than one sign such as ""ice cream"" plus ""store.""

There are no babies signing or speaking in this production and no tutorial for parents of hearing babies who are teaching their babies to use sign language.  I recommend the ""My Baby Can Talk"" series to teach either sign language or first spoken words to babies.",1155168000,48,1446,4.825910931174089
2564499,5,B000FGFURW,"I had to get the new Baby Einstein DVD for my 19 month old daughter.  She loves BE and I knew she would enjoy Baby's Favorite Places.

Her vocabulary has expanded because of how interactive these videos are for young toddlers and babies.  She didn't just stare at the screen blankly.  Instead, she was trying to imitate some of the signs for the words and laughed at the puppets.

If your child is familiar with BE, don't miss out on this DVD because it's one of their best.  It's very much like Baby Wordsworth and has the signs to go with the words.  I enjoyed seeing my daughter make connections with what she already knows such as looking outside for our fence as the word fence was introduced.

This video is interactive, fun, and is just right for the short attention span of a little one.  I have a feeling this will be one of her favorites.",1153785600,14,848,4.350318471337579

Anyway, I didn't buy this for him to learn sign language, I bought this for the puppet shows and it was worth it!

2564510,4,B000FGFURW,"While my 20 month old toddler really loves this DVD, I don't think it is quite as good as Baby Wordsworth.  The puppets, scenes, and music are very entertaining to her, however the actual words/signs that are being taught are less common in everyday use.  Don't expect to use this DVD as a tool to teach your child sign language that can be used all the time. (""Trail"", ""bakery"", ""playing field"", etc. don't come up that often in our household.)  My daugher does take great pleasure in trying to do the signs anyway and especially enjoys signing ""school"" when we take her sister to school.  It's a very well produced and thought out DVD and I'm glad I added it to our growing Baby Einstein collection.",1303689600,,701,4.5396825396825395
2564511,1,B000FGFURW,"This Einstein video was poorly thought-out. As like other reviewers, I agree that the signs are not simple enough for babies.  The signs are geared toward a child who already signs...toddlers? But the video production is geared toward babies.  Doesn't make sense.  Also, when buying a B.E. video keep the following in mind and ask yourself, ""Is it really worth it?"":
There's your occasional repeat clips that they use to fill the time, and of course those lovely 2-3 second black screens. Oh, not to mention my favorite...having to fast-forward through 2 previews, finally getting to the main menu, and then having to fast-forward through 3 more previews! I am so perplexed that Disney would feel the need to put SO MANY previews on EVERY SINGLE B.E. video (with the exception of 2 or 3, out of 15!). They're kids!! They're not interested in previews, and the parents don't need to see them every single day! We've got impatient kids, WORK WITH US DISNEY!! Okay, done venting. This is especially why I give a rating of 1 star. I'm fed up with having to sit through previews on every video. By the way, why are we paying around $15 for DVDs that aren't even full-length movies. They're 20 minutes long! (...and low-budge production to boot.) It's time to lower that outrageous price. Who's with me?!!",1284336000,,1299,4.764444444444444

2564518,4,B000FGFURW,"As the mom of a toddler, I have found this to be a very helpful learning tool for both of us. This is, as far as I can tell, the third in a series of sign language and verbal skills DVD's. As the title implies, this DVD covers words for places that parents often take their babies and toddlers every day...around town. It teaches words and signs such as bank, library, sidewalk, school, swing, slide, etc.

I wouldn't recommend it for a younger baby. We purchased it when our daughter was 20 months and she took right to it. She is now 25 months, and she enjoys the older kids performing the signs, and I as a parent appreciate Marlee Matlin's clear signing directions.

I read the critical reviews before purchasing this. If this is your first sign language DVD, I would recommend getting Baby Einstein's ""First Signs,"" which includes simple words like mommy, daddy, baby, cereal, ball, more, all done, etc. Then watch ""Baby Wordsworth"" which adds words like cat, dog, clock, computer, chair, lamp, etc. Then ""First Words Around Town,"" this DVD. Just like with a movie series, you want to watch the first one before watching the sequels.

If you are planning to just turn this on and leave the room, then it probably isn't for you. However, if your goal is to teach your child sign language and verbal skills, while you learn at the same time, this is a great tool. Learn with your child and then reinforce when you are visiting the places around your town.

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that I think the age recommendation should be 18 months and up instead of 12.",1247443200,,1586,4.515679442508711

2564520,5,B000FGFURW,I bought this to help my grandson who could not talk to communicate. It became very frustrating for both of us when he wanted a drink or something to eat. It made it difficult to potty train him. This helped our communication a lot and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has small children with or without speech problems.

2564521,1,B000FGFURW,"Sign language in english is different from sign language in spanish, yet they use the same signs. Personally, I think there should be a different dvd dedicated to sign language and not combined with this type of dvd. It takes up good quality puppet time that my kid loves.

2564522,4,B000FGFURW,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,2,1925,4.928792569659443
