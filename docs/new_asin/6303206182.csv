7840960,5,6303206182,"A typically subtle & emotional ""foreign flick"" on the classical concert circuit, during WWII, with a powerful story.

Much unseen & under-rated.... still waiting for a DVD release of this title (currently, only available as a French language DVD, here in Canada).

7840961,3,6303206182,"Excellent story.  Could have been told in one hour, or filmmaker could have added a huge plot improvement from infinite material available during WWII in France.  Acting is amateurish by today's standards.",1211932800,,205,5.375
7840962,5,6303206182,"A humble but musically gifted girl, bets and win when decides t meet a diva. She will give her shelter and affection. But behind this angelical talent in progress, a crude and sharp vision will be increasing around this couple. The Nazi occupation in France will cause their banishment to England. Brahms, Berlioz, Faure will appear from time to time in this mature drama, loaded with those fine details which conform a pleasant work enriched by a superb photography, fine illumination and superb artistic direction.

A must - buy, in few words.",1137974400,2,545,4.923913043478261
7840963,5,6303206182,"Sophie, a masterful pianist is hired by opera singer Irene to be her accompanist onstage during Nazi occupied Paris. Irene's husband, Charles, a businessman, is also introduced, and director Miller takes us through the kind of story an American studio would not even dream of making anymore.
Irene is having an affair with Jacques, and she and Sophie and Charles decide to leave France for London. They are attacked by a single German plane on their way, but make it. The climax, involving death and lost love, is chilling.
Why did I love this film so much? The pace is slow, but it gives you a chance to get to know the characters, all of whom are so well drawn and acted, I kept forgetting this was fiction. Irene is completely unhappy with her marriage, but keeps smiling onstage. Charles wrestles with his conscience, telling himself he is not taking financial gains with the Nazis. Sophie, the main character, just wants to belong in a normal life situation, witnessing it from anywhere else but the piano bench as some singer's gofer.
The direction and cinematography are excellent, and the music, featuring Beethoven, Mozart, et al., is incredible.
I am at a loss of words about what a good film this is, and this will give you another side of WWII. Vive le France!
This was French language with English subtitles and is rated (PG) for some gun violence, some profanity, and some sexual references.",1022630400,13,1405,4.762295081967213
7840964,5,6303206182,"I saw this movie when it came out many years ago. I now have it on tape, and it is one of the few movies I always enjoy watching over.  A truely heart-wrenching story of love and betrayal.",942883200,6,188,3.9473684210526314
