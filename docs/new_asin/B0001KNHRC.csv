2009400,4,B0001KNHRC,I found this movie to be sad but to have a suspense thrill to it. Rod Taylor's family are killed. He looks for the people responsible. Along the way the are twists and turns. I enjoyed it.,1309305600,2,188,4.108108108108108

2009447,5,B0001KNHRC,"One of my favorite movies from the 1980s, I'm delighted to find it on video.  As a personal anecdote, my former -and a few present--friends, were members of the unconventional warriors portrayed in the film and used to laugh ourselves silly watching Hollywood's version of us.  Love Rod Taylor's acting and the story is good so still a favorite movie.",1455580800,2,351,4.833333333333333
2009448,4,B0001KNHRC,"Good movie but it is not full screen.  Also the audio and video is awful.  When they are talking it is low, music is loud.  Hubby sleeps during the day and I have to sit there with control in hand to adjust volumn.",1453852800,2,214,3.9302325581395348
2009449,5,B0001KNHRC,"FABULOUS! Very entertaining! Great script! Great plot! Streaming movies today run pale in comparison to the ""great"" scripts and plots like this movie that IS NOT filled with ""dirty,"" empty words and lots of unnecessary nudes. Those who have grainy and substandard hearing should ceck their own equipment, first. My viewing and hearing was perfect. And, the Inspector said, ""I'd get rid of that thingif I were you. It's already out-of-date."" So, there you go...it's all in your own equipment. In my own viewing, I could see that right after the bombing, this 1980's Corporate business was the blueprint for our 21st century government. That is the way I watched this movie to its very end--every Corporate person was the government. The ending was a bit slow; I wanted the finish to have just a bit more action. Great movie. I hope Amazon can keep up as I compare every streaming movie available from Amazon to Netflix. This is one that Netfilx, as far as I know, did not offer. But, Amazon is still very limited in comparison.",1451779200,,1026,4.769662921348314

2009479,4,B0001KNHRC,"In CRY OF THE INNOCENT, a family's holiday is brought to a sudden, tragic end when an airplane crashes into their vacation home. Steve Donegin (Rod Taylor- THE TIME MACHINE) watches in horror as his wife (Joanna Pettet) and children are burned alive in the ensuing explosion / fire. It is clear from the beginning that the plane was actually blown up by an assassin's bomb. Donegin sets out to find those responsible for this disaster. Of course, he gets the runaround, and must do most of the sleuthing for himself. While investigating, Steve unwittingly comes to the attention of the killer, and is caught up in corporate espionage and murder. He also meets a reporter (Pettet again) who bears a striking resemblance to his wife. Together, they attempt to solve the mystery behind a shady business magnate. COTI is an above average Made-For-TV thriller, w/ a good role for Taylor...",1408838400,7,884,4.860927152317881
