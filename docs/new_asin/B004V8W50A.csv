8443042,3,B004V8W50A,"Disappointed in this.  At first I thought it was the championship game, but it is not.  It is just the story behind what lead to the game.",1392681600,,138,4.074074074074074
8443043,5,B004V8W50A,Incredible chronicle of an even more incredible basketball team! Even non-UCONN Huskies fans can appreciate how special this season was.,1388188800,,136,5.85
8443044,5,B004V8W50A,if you are a UConn fan this is a must to have and will be definetely enjoyed by the receiver,1356739200,,92,3.65
8443045,5,B004V8W50A,"This DVD of the best UConn basketball team EVER was so well done it brought back all the nail-biting, edge of your seat thrills of the season. Quality is excellent and is narrated by Joe D. Ambrosio - the voice of UConn sports! Even when the credits roll in the end the background video is of the Victory Parade in Hartford. A must-have for any UConn fan - or anyone who enjoys the thrills of college mens basketball!!",1310947200,,418,4.371794871794871
8443046,2,B004V8W50A,"In light of the high-quality 2004 DVD (""ConnQuest,"" which included a tournament recap AND both the semi-final and final game in their entirety), this championship video falls far short.  The production quality is poor in my opinion: too many player/coach interviews spliced amongst game highlights, inadequate narrative recaps of key games, and even a resolution so low that it didn't fit the full screen of my puny 32"" TV.  I'm guessing the quality is so low because the producers (IMG, not one of the networks) could not obtain all the necessary footage rights (the NCAA now sells full games from their website which explains why that is absent this time around).  Very disappointing.  In fact, there was a cheesy DVD produced in 2004 as well entitled ""Top Dogs"" and this vid is much closer to that than it is to ConnQuest.",1308182400,4,825,4.829787234042553
