2877807,5,B000S0GYP2,"Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea is a rarity -- a film about an (apparent) ecological disaster and the strange and remarkable and funny stories and lifestyles that built themselves around it.  The Salton Sea was created in about 1905 when the Colorado River was diverted to irrigate farms nearby and the runoff formed a lake in the Salton Sink, just 20 miles off the coast of Palm Springs.  In the '50s it was promoted aggressively as a tourist spot and real estate boomed -- but then due to a number of factors (including the fact that excessive heat in the summer kills off hundreds of thousands of fish every year, leaving a bad smell) the Sea was mostly abandoned -- leaving only the hardy and stubborn, and many of them are cool and odd ducks: a former Hungarian revolutionary named Hunky Dory; an old man who likes to let it all hang out; the game warden; the real estate mogul who expects the boom to come soon; families who have come to escape inner city L.A.

The film does an excellent job providing a portrait of the wildlife (both human and otherwise) that surrounds the sea, and catalogues the contradictory reasons why they stay -- it is funny, poignant, bizarre and engaging, and the narration by John Waters hits just the right tone.  It dispells some of the many myths that surround the Salton Sea (the fish are NOT poisonous, the lake is NOT toxic -- birds die from the bacteria that come to eat the fish that die because of a lack of oxygen in the salty water when it gets very hot) -- but perhaps more importantly exposes the existence of this strange and remarkable place, a testament simultaneously to our lack of foresight and to our ingenuity in making the best of unforeseen circumstances.  The style of the film is spot-on -- with music and titling and other effects that give the film a retro-California-in-the-'50s feel.

If you've caught this doc on cable and enjoyed it, you ought to check out the dvd -- which is expanded a bit over the tv version: it includes more on the local life, is a bit more ""salty,"" and definitely more memorable.",1208217600,29,2076,4.537433155080214
2877808,5,B000S0GYP2,"I rented this and then bought it--this is a really interesting DVD regarding the Salton Sea in southern California, how it was created 100 or so years ago BY MISTAKE, how they tried to promote and develop it, it's heyday in the '50's and '60's, and it's consistent decline into an ecological disaster since then. Couple that with all the really interesting, very individualistic folks who for some reason still live there, and add in John Waters narrating and presto--Hello Dali!
This is a very strange and wonderful documentary--it grows on you like a fungus",1199318400,5,559,4.894736842105263

2877811,5,B000S0GYP2,"I just saw this documentary on Independent Film Channel and it blew me away! I never knew about the Salton Sea until now. A place I'll have to see for myself. A failed utopia in the typical progress happy colors of the 50's and 60's turned into a stinking body of water with the hollow walls of those hotels and stores from those better days as hurting reminders how perfect it once was. This film expplains how it came into existence and why it went downhill. The focus is also on the people who live there today and how they deal with the masses of rotting fish and dying birds which die in the sea every summer...and about the hope the people still have for the old times to return one day...
Great music by Friends Of Dean Martinez and narrated by John Waters.",1183852800,15,764,4.3125

2877837,5,B000S0GYP2,"Really fun movie, and such great videography.  The creators do a wonderful job with the juxtaposition of interviews with strange and forboding views of the decaying structures of the Salton Sea, some of them half immersed in the brine.  I felt a little sad for the residents,as I wondered if some of them knew how much pathos filled the scene in which they were interviewed.

The movie in my opinion is a study in the mechanisms of hope, hubris,  folly, and illusion.  The viewer learns that the Salton Sea is not a natural body of water, but was created by out of an accident with river diversion channels.  Once it had formed, people adapted to the accident, and tried to create a seaside vacation resort in the desert.  The effort made good for a few capital years, (and the interviews suggest that many of those interviewed are still in a sense living in hopes of a return to those golden times) but then came the flood, and the ruin, and things fell apart.  Amidst talk of returning the SEa to its former glory, the reality of the receding shoreline lurks in the background, while the Sea spills forth its disgusting effluvia -- the thousands of dead tilapia, the corpses of pelicans who die of botulism after eating the sickened fish - the result of excessive salinity combined with excessive heat.  Now, as San Diego takes the agricultural runoff water which was the only thing helping keep the Sea in existence, it seems doomed, and a new threat lurks in the air -- problems with dust storms kicked up by in the exposed, dry lakebed.  THis dust could cause serious problems not only for all residents, but for the Central Valley to the north, while the loss of wetlands habitat could seriously harm the birds who depend upon it, having had all their other former wetland territory already destroyed by humans.

The viewer hopefully will get the sense of the lesson which should be learned from this -- which is, that if you mess with Mother Nature, you can create a disaster.  WIth the loss of water to San Diego, and the drought that California has seen for the last several years,  plans to restore the Sea to its former glory, or even to simply keep it at the status quo, seem overly optimistic, and the future of the Sea and its residents looks bleak.",1438992000,3,2263,4.571782178217822

It is a classic tale of over development and total disregard for it's consequences. Well done, well written and narrated perfectly so you don't lose the thread of what they are trying to show you.

I have watched it many times since purchasing about a year ago. It is a must for young film makers to use as a resource. A very funny and entertaining look at a beutiful area that encapsulizes the human condition: how man chooses to overcome nature or let her take back that we abandon. The photography and pacing of the film is excellent. I will enjoy this purchase for many years. A big thank you as I am better for having studied the film!",1389830400,,579,4.37037037037037
2877858,5,B000S0GYP2,"And I've never once visited the Salton Sea. Just studying a map one day piqued my interest in this man-made lake as in ""Why haven't I heard about it before"" ... and I suddenly wanted to learn all I could about it - for reasons still unknown to me. This documentary was a wonderful, sad yet hilarious eye opener to not only the history and gorgeousness of the sea itself, but a look at it's inhabitants who may seem to be a little odd at first, but prove themselves to be some of the biggest optimists I've ever seen; and I mean that in the best of ways.

This film is enlightening, enchanting, and thought provoking, one I will watch over and over. I plan on seeing for myself the wonders and horros that comprise this area and hope beyond hope that the Salton Sea can be saved and perhaps become once again The Riviera of Southern California... nothing would please me more.",1389398400,,875,4.368098159509202

2877861,3,B000S0GYP2,"Years ago I'd been to the Salton Sea (35 miles long, 15 miles wide and below sea level), but somewhat repulsed by the very high heat, smell of dead fish, flies, shoreline trash, and general nothingness of the area. This DVD brought the opportunity to learn more about the area and its residents.

I did not realize it had been an attractive place once before, and had assumed it was drying up. Turns out it is regularly renewed mostly by inflow from agricultural runoff (1.36 million acre-feet/year), as well as the New, Whitewater, and Alamo rivers (the latter were not mentioned in the DVD). Its salinity is greater than that of the Pacific Ocean, but less than that of the Great Salt Lake.

Other sources report that the area was once part of the Colorado River Delta and holds the dirt left from carving out the Grand Canyon - sediment a mile deep in some places. The Salton has shrunk over 14 square miles in the last decade, thanks to an evaporation rate of 6'/year.

As for the inhabitants - my impression from the DVD is that they're almost entirely on welfare or retired, have little political clout, and will be unable to bring about the massive spending required to save the area from eventually totally drying out.",1376611200,,1226,4.614678899082569

2877864,5,B000S0GYP2,"This isn't just entertaining, it's depressing - but in an uplifting way. That's how mixed my feelings were while watching it. I felt so sorry for the people stuck out there, especially the kids, living in a hot, boring, polluted place with little hope for a future. But their attitudes seemed quite a bit more positive than that of many of my neighbors in the city.

I didn't quite finish the DVD last night because I kept rerunning scenes to review what I'd just experienced. The history of the Salton Sea was covered in nice detail, as well. I remember it from the early 60s, which made it's present condition all the more surprising to me. The video was made in 2004, so I can't imagine how it might be today.

2877868,4,B000S0GYP2,"Plagues and Pleasures captured beautifully the times when California was a happier, free-for-all state. I really enjoyed watching the families having fun on the water, before the Saton Sea turned to the toxic pool it appears to be today. I was reminded of my childhood, when grandpa had the ""Chris Craft,"" and all the toys that went with it. I couldn't picture for a moment (even with a caseload of beer in my body...the current past-time of the Saton Sea residents...) water skiing or even getting my toes wet there today. It was fascinating to see how the little town functions today however; the kind of fascination that you have when you see a 4-car pile-up and cannot look away!!",1353456000,2,684,4.708333333333333
2877869,5,B000S0GYP2,"I grew up in Southern California in the 60s. I remember going to the Salton Sea with my family, aunts, uncles and cousins to play in the water. My uncle had a ski boat which we would ride while the adults waterskiid. The sea did have a saltier smell than the ocean, but we didn't mind that too much. We had lots of fun on this vast expance of water.

At the end of the 70s and having learned to drive I took some friends to the Salton Sea. When we got there the salt smell was so pungent it was difficult to breath, and something was wrong with the water--tangled branches and sticks were poking high out of the water looking ominous. We left quickly, sad that the area had deteriorated so badly.

Plaques & Pleasures on the Salton Sea narrated by John Waters was a nostalgic look back for me. I loved the quirkly narration Waters provided as this documentary revealed the creation, the marketing hype of the Salton Sea and its sad surrealistic present day condition.

The documentary provided me the answers as to why such a promising area for recreation and retirement living had succumbed to ecological ruin. The remaining residents had interesting stories to tell and inexplicable reasons as to why they choose to remain there. Their stories are thought provoking. I'm trying to rationalize if they see what outsiders see when we look at the Salton Sea today, or do they only choose to see it as it was in its heyday.",1352937600,2,1421,4.5

It gives a brief history of the Salton Sea & it shows how (like many places) people can love or despise an area, depending on their perspective.

We learned from the bartender himself and from a lovely couple sipping Natural Light beer over ice in a mason jar that The Salton Sea is just given a ""bad rap"". They are proud of their home and will defend it to any who question. What I believe is that anyone who chooses to live in the desert year round is...special. They may be a bit odd. They may be a bit eccentric. These desert rats, however, are friendly and are the salt of the earth.

After viewing this film, beautifully narrated by John Waters, I had an even better appreciation of this area and it's inhabitants.

2877876,4,B000S0GYP2,"Palm Springs, California, is famous as a desert town that offers the good life - lush green golf courses, sunny skies, and wealthy inhabitants. Just down the road is the Salton Sea, an inland lake that briefly prospered before going bust. In ""Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea,"" maverick filmmaker John Waters examines those who choose to live among the ruins surrounding the Sea.

Not surprisingly, the area's residents are often outside the mainstream. One character is a Hungarian immigrant who calls himself Hunky Daddy; he drinks beer, curses, and pulls down his pants while on camera. Another man likes to stand nude by the side of the road while promoting various causes.

Waters explores the tensions between old and new residents. The long-time residents are often elderly white people who cannot afford to live anywhere else. (It's fairly cheap to live in a near-ghost town). The newcomers are often minorities who are trying to escape California's cities.

A third theme is the tension those who want to re-develop the area and the environmental problems that increasingly plague the Sea as California's population grows. There seem to be few easy solutions to the problems plaguing the Salton Sea.

Though I enjoyed the film, there are a few drawbacks. Sometimes the film is a bit unfocused. In one scene, for instance, several new residents comment on the area. Unfortunately, people speak over each other, so the scene is very difficult for the viewer to follow. Other scenes simply don't go anywhere.

In spite of my quibbles, I recommend ""Plagues and Pleasures..."" for those who are searching for something different.",1262304000,,1639,5.078066914498141

The first half is funny and got a lot of laughs because of the strange people and interesting history.  However as the movie went on the content became more serious and less interesting.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good documentary film, but the expectations of the film as a funny and interesting documentary are not met in the second half, and the film eventually ends on a low note.  It's still a great documentary for those seeking to learn more about the Salton Sea, just not solidly entertaining all the way through to the end.",1227571200,5,701,4.410852713178294

2877879,3,B000S0GYP2,"Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea is sort of an anti tourist video. The film chronicles the story of California's Salton Sea from tourist destination in the 1950's and 60's to its present state of ecological decay.

Narrated by John Waters, the film interviews people who live in the various towns surrounding the Sea and they discuss what the area once was compared to what it is now and on to what it may yet become in the future.

I did not find this to be the powerful documentary that many claimed it was. In fact I was a little disappointed. Yes there is an ecological disaster happening at the Salton Sea and I know I should be concerned. I just wasn't really interested in the area or the folks who live there and the film did not make me care more about them.

It has a really good feel and is thought provoking. I wonder what ever happpened to the mostly aging characters.
I wonder why the DVD cost $2 more here than on their web site",1210377600,2,460,4.238636363636363

8203512,5,B000S0GYP2,"This doc is one of the best ever. The history and retro culture of the Salton sea is fascinating. Eloquently narrated by John Waters, the cast of real life characters that tie their lives to this geologic anomaly are worthy of a documentary unto themselves. I've watched this film countless times and will likely continue to do so.",1462320000,2,331,4.724137931034483
8203513,5,B000S0GYP2,"This is a great documentary. Love John Waters, having lived in Palm Springs and watched the politics the film is an authentic piece of history.
I saw a lot of familiar faces.",1461888000,,174,4.46875
8203514,5,B000S0GYP2,"One of the oddest and most oddly satisfying documentaries I've ever seen. The Salton Sea in it's present form occurred by accident, an interesting story in itself which is covered in the documentary. Developers turned the area into the Hot New Resort in the 1950s but pollution from farm runoff and increasing salt content have turned the area into a giant, stinking cesspool surrounded by poor and decaying communities. The Salton Sea and the areas around it are completely unique and has led to a community of equally unique residents. John Waters is the perfect voice for this project as the area and it's residents could star in a Waters film with very little change to either the backgrounds or characters. The production and cinematography are fantastic.

The Salton Sea is a blighted and poor area within a short driving distance of some of the most wealthy and desirable areas in the world. ""Plagues & Pleasures"" tells its story with compassion and respect. Definitely worth a view!",1460764800,,990,4.92814371257485
