6389966,4,B00JU3S6IQ,"I pre-ordered the Complete Series from StarVista/TimeLife over a year ago since ""Mama's Family"" is my second-favorite sitcom ever just behind ""Maude"" and the only complaint I have about this wonderful set is found here on the upcoming Season 5 release.

The episode ""Mama in One"" which finds Mama looking forward to having the house to herself when everyone goes away for the weekend suffers from cuts. StarVista wasn't able to clear ""Singin' in the Rain"" so the scene with Mama splashing in the puddles outside with her umbrella is missing. It's kind of jarring and I now wish I hadn't tossed my old VHS tapes so soon after pre-ordering this. I just assumed when they advertised they were using ""original broadcast masters"" everything would be complete. NOT! This is just to give everyone a heads-up that the puddle scene won't be there if you're looking forward to it.

That being said, this season continues in the same vein as the last two except there's a new plot thread that will continue through the remainder of the series as Naomi and Vint now plan on having a baby. The writing is still sharp and funny as ever and the cast delivers on all counts.

Some of the highlights are fan-favorite ""The Really Loud Family"" where Bubba makes a home video of the Harpers; Mama gets tired of everyone's April Fool's pranks so plans an elaborate one of her own; Iola moves in when her declaration of independence to her mother backfires; Mama appears on ""The Big Wheel"" lottery show; Mama's new answering machine causes a misunderstanding where she thinks the family is trying to have her put away.

Some episodes are less funny than others, but the characters are still making them entertaining and every one of them has their moments.

Four Stars due to the cut episode here.",1408838400,28,1775,4.731391585760518

6389972,5,B00JU3S6IQ,"To paraphrase What About Bob? There are those people who love the syndicated episodes of Mamas Family and those who dont. Its more of a style of humor that can related to broadly rather than the smart, witty, intellectual humor. The laughs are easy, driven by the actions of characters and the situations are sometimes, okay often, off the wall. Its a style of comedy that I actually wish existed more today as opposed to cheap jokes about certain human activities.

This is probably my favorite season featuring such laugh out loud (I mean literally) moments as Bubbas video project with the allegedly shorted out camera, Mama riding a wrecking ball, and the Mama-Iola CLL debacle. Also of note is the episode where the Harper's team up to take down Naomis boss who ties her job to performing certain favors. Theres also a really neat interview with the cast around a table, although it does kind of toss back and forth from Mamas Family to the Family sketches that aired on Carol Burnett, but thats really a minor pick point.",1500681600,,1027,4.705555555555556

6389996,4,B00JU3S6IQ,"Vicki Lawrence (star of Mama's Family) hand picked the six episodes chosen here from season five. While I always enjoy Mama's Family, I do enjoy the six of them here. They included ""The Really Loud Family;"" ""Naomi's New Position;"" ""Found Money;"" ""Mama's Layaway Plan;"" ""Mama in One;"" and ""Dependence Day.""

The first episode features Bubba taping his family for a special and it's my favorite here. ""The Really Loud Family"" has Bubba asking his family and Iola (longtime neighbor and honorary Harper) recalling life in the Harper home among broken toys donated for orphans. The camera has a short and the end result is funny as hell.

The second episode entitled ""Naomi's New Position"" is about her trying to get a promotion at Food Circus supermarket. She has to deal with sexual harassment. With help from Mama, she turns the tables on him.

The third episode, ""Found Money,"" is about how Mama gets $800 from an ATM machine when it goes berserk.

The fourth episode is ""Mama's Layaway Plan,"" is another classic especially with Dorothy Van (Aunt Effie) after returning from a family member's funeral. Mama plans an extravagant finale to her life even if it means scrimping away.

The fifth episode is ""Mama in One,"" where she gets the house to herself for a weekend. It is probably a weaker episode than the others but Mama entertains herself with nobody around except Iola's goldfish.

The sixth episode is ""Dependence Day,"" where Iola moves in with the Harpers and decorates their home.

The six episodes would have been perfect if Vicki Lawrence had explained her reasons for choosing them. I would have liked to have seen some extras from these episodes but I still love ""Mama's Family"" and always will.",1463875200,2,1708,4.86896551724138

6390013,5,B00JU3S6IQ,"""Mama's Family"": Season 5 continues to deliver the laughs. As I've stated in my other reviews, I think Vicki Lawrence is a genius. She is absolute perfection as Thelma Harper (aka ""Mama"") from her timeless facial expressions, to her physical comedy, and her cranky but lovable disposition. Season 5 had some really hilarious and memorable episodes like: ""Baby Talk"", ""The Really Loud Family"", ""Found Money"", ""Mama Bell"", ""Very Dirty Dancing"", ""Reading the Riot Act"", and ""Mama Makes Three"". ""Mama's Family"" was a childhood favorite of mine. Now that I'm an adult, it's absolute joy to have ALL 6 seasons on DVD. Finally. Enjoy!",1451520000,3,627,5.097087378640777

6390038,4,B00JU3S6IQ,"This season focuses larges upon Vint (Ken Berry) and Naomi's (Dorothy Lyman) attempts to have a baby of their own, as well as Bubba's (Allan Kayser) college exploits.

There are, however, lots of classic Mama-type laughs, over the usual Harper family mixups -- for instance, in ""Many Unhappy Returns,"" Vint hides a diamond bracelet for his boss's wife's anniversary surprise, only to have Mama stumble upon it and believe it's her birthday gift. Another great one is ""Mama Bell,"" when the family gets a new answering machine and Mama mistakes some messages as meaning the Harpers want to send her to a nursing home.

That isn't to say that the Harpers don't have their serious moments as well. In ""There's No Place Like...No Place,"" Mama's eyes are opened to the plights of the homeless in her community, many of whom are just regular people like herself. And in ""Reading the Riot Act,"" Mama and her church ladies are all set to impeach their committee president when Mama learns the woman is hiding a huge secret.

As usual, the show provides great entertainment to viewers of all ages!",1435708800,,1087,4.802139037433155
