8008582,5,B00019G3BA,"I FINALLY FOUND IT, thanks to Amazon.com.  I, like everyone else, wish this movie was available on DVD for a reasonable price.  I have never forgotten the very poignant performance of Tim Hutton which was incredible and I have never forgotten it.  Yes, it should be a classic, and available to everyone.",1358208000,,303,4.788461538461538
8008583,4,B00019G3BA,I remember watching this movie on TV as a kid and I have always wanted to see it again.  I didn't know the title but I remember Timothy Hutton being in it. Keep in mind I was 8 years old when the movie came out so this made quite an impression on me.  Can't wait to see it again.,1252022400,,279,3.711864406779661

8008585,5,B00019G3BA,"This is a really good movie, a mixture of compassion and of hope for the children in the story. It stars Timothy Hutton as Donald, who is around 10 years old,and his sister and brother who he looks after when their self-absorbed mother abandons them. Donald has to steal milk and food for his siblings but eventually draws attention to himself and the children eventually end up at Childrens Aid Services. The children are eventually separated and put in separate foster homes. This is the story of Donald's search for his brother and sister and how he never gives up trying to find them and while looking years later, connects with a sympathetic Social Case Worker(Brenda Vaccaro)who he tries to get to help him. I saw this movie on TV years ago, and it has been on VHS a long time ago, but its never been on DVD. I can never figure out why there are so many junky movies released involving guns, sex and bad acting on DVD when so many really good movies like this one are not released. There are used copies of this movie on Amazon at prices which many people can't afford. It needs to be released on DVD where we can all buy it for a reasonable price. If a film studio wants a good sale they should pick up this movie and put it on DVD. Lots of people will buy it. It has good acting by all the cast. Its very touching. A real tear jerker with sadness but hope as well. It has everything a good movie has. Four hankies needed for this one. Please some studio, get this movie and put it on DVD so we can all enjoy it. I would buy it on the day of its release if it was released on DVD.",1155254400,8,1587,4.189542483660131
8008586,3,B00019G3BA,"I used to watch this movie years ago as a child because my neighbor friend had it on VHS. I'm almost 26 now and want to see it again very badly. Prices too high right now though. I don't remember all that much of it except for that the beginning when the characters were still children was my favorite part. Wish I had a better review, but like I said, I was just a kid. morganp3",1120694400,3,379,4.0
