Khurram and Arjumand never met in a market place, they knew each other since their childhood and that was not Khurram first marriage. The fantasy makes the film charming tough... I depicts the story of a very special love.",1406592000,2,315,4.543859649122807
8007459,5,B000171QVO,I loved this movie and the costumes and especially the music!  Sometimes I don't quite like the Bollywood effect with the Western flair.  This movie to me did not transpire this at all.  It had a very well directed love story with respect.  I liked this attitude in the movie.  The acting was very well done by all.  Very well done.  I would highly recommend this movie for young and old.,1361836800,2,388,4.380281690140845
