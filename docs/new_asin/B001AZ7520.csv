8532499,2,B001AZ7520,"I didn't know what to expect, but surely something a lot more professional. The songs were the same as both cd volumes, nothing original. The kids that are ""acting"" look lost and confused, especially while trying to sing along with the music. If it didn't keep my interest it's definitely not going to keep my child's.",1369008000,,318,4.696428571428571
