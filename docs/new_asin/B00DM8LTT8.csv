I actually had a PAL - professional VHS tape of it, but my 30 year old multistandard machine gave up the ghost and so I had to upgrade to DVD.  The problem is that I don't believe that this is a professional DVD made from a master by the company. If it is, it's made from a poor master.  I think it's a first generation copy because it has a slight white halo around them and a fine layer of snow in the background.

Before you think it's my equipment, I have two region free DVRs from two different companies and many PAL DVDs -- and I know what copies look like from back in the days when it wasn't so easy to get professional stuff from other countries.  None of my PAL DVDs look like the quality of this one.  The one hesitation is that most of my PAL DVDs are region 2, not 4 but it's hard to believe region 4 might be of lower quality than region 2.  I certainly never noticed it before and I had many pro PAL videotapes from Australia, including Harbour Beat.

Harbour Beat is wonderful if you like buddy banter action comedies. Think of it as Australia's version of Starsky and Hutch much as The Professionals was UK's version.  Not saying they are copies, but in the same vein.  I love it.  Have always loved John Hannah.  Still watch anything he is in.  And for a long time I had hoped it would go to series, but alas, it didn't.",1440028800,,1455,4.146428571428571
