8681828,2,B00O3GUZ52,"If you are a fan of Constance Talmadge--as I am--beware this poor, public-domain copy of one of her lesser-known comedies.  Sadly, companies like Alpha Video, Grapevine Video, Classic Video Streams and others seem to specialize in releasing such barely-watchable copies.  It is hard to know how good or funny or cute this 1918 movie really is.  The picture quality is lamentable. The generic and uncredited musical score is lame.  TCM lists this film as 60 minutes long.  Given that A PAIR OF SILK STOCKINGS runs only about 45 minutes on this Alpha dvd, it is impossible to know what might be missing.  The two ""bonuses"" that supplement the main film are completely lamentable.  If you desire to own a film with Constance Talmadge, I recommend Kino's fine double feature HER NIGHT OF ROMANCE (1924) and HER SISTER FROM PARIS (1925), Flicker Alley's wonderful Douglas Fairbanks set, A MODERN MUSKETEER, which includes the very funny 1916 Talmadge/Fairbanks comedy THE MATRIMANIAC, and--of course--Cohen Media's beautiful new Blu Ray of INTOLERANCE (1916) in which you are able to enjoy the lovely performance of Constance as the Mountain Girl.",1450915200,4,1142,5.140540540540541
