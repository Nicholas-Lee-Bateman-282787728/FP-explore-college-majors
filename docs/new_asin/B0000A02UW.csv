7994757,3,B0000A02UW,"This triple feature is alright for a cheap martial arts collection. The title of the collection, Which i feel is inappropriate and even misleading [Should've been titled The Bruce Lee/Bruce Li collection] should be ignored when you come to the realization that only 1 of these movies actually feature Bruce Lee. That 1 movie is Chinese Connection, Which appears in its usual dubbed print that's been circulating all over VHS and DVD for years. This movie as it is is not one of Bruce's best films, But it is fun in spite of its horribly dubbed dialogue [The original mandarin version is available in America on DVD only through the expensive 2005 Bruce Lee box set that was released by 20th Century Fox, Which i had the pleasure of buying used at a game store for only $17.99!]. The story, Revolving around a distraught Chinese martial arts student [Played by Bruce Lee] extracting revenge on rival Japanese martial arts students who're responsible for the murder of his teacher, Was nothing new to the martial arts genre. It's fight scenes are pretty good, Being that you do get to see Bruce Lee in all his ferocious, violent glory. This was a pretty decent movie [But try getting the original mandarin version of this film, It's far superior to the english version]. The highlight of the film is the explosive finale when Bruce has his final showdown with the Japanese students. Blind Fists was an ok Bruce Li movie. An average martial artist [Bruce Li] is taught martial arts by an old man who happens to be blind. The fights are ok, The plot is thin, But, It does make for good saturday afternoon viewing. Now, Onto the highlight of this DVD: Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth. This biopic of Bruce Lee [Played rather well by Bruce Li, Especially taking into consideration Li's almost uncanny resemblance to Bruce Lee] is actually the best of the many Bruceploitation flicks of the 70's that followed in the wake of Bruce Lee's death. Despite inaccuracies in its history, This movie has well-filmed fight scenes and even features some memorable scenes. It's easily Bruce Li's best movie by far and it's actually a respectable tribute to the late great Bruce Lee. While you won't get much of Bruce Lee in this set, This is a rather satisfactory buy due mainly to its very affordable price and the amount of content you're getting.",1193184000,6,2328,4.722358722358722
