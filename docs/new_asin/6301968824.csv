400150,5,6301968824,"In our PC society, I can still look back and grin affecionately, considering that this film was made at a time when ""battle-of-the-sexes"" humor was at a peak (Doris Day, anyone?) Lemmon's a natural, and Terry-Thomas actually steals the film for that reason. Fairly formulaic, the men are made to look more idiotic than the women, though if anyone wants to take issue, check out Claire Trevor's manipulative harpee witch. Virna Lisi is, indeed, stunningly gorgeous, and very endearing. This is a ""nice"" movie; not a great one, nor one that lives on in history. It has Lemmon, Terry-Thomas, Lisi, Trevor, Eddie Mayehoff (a riot), and should be taken for exactly what it is: a fun, mindless romp that entertains. Lighten up. I still think this should've been nominated for Sound Effects...I never forgot the ""Gloppita-gloppita"" machine. Don't judge; enjoy!",1085875200,7,853,5.1
400151,5,6301968824,"There is absolutely nothing like good-natured satire for escape from the pressures of the workaday world, which insists on everyone being reasonable and restrained in their ire toward others. In the genre of high satire, ""How to Murder Your Wife"" takes one poke after another at the guys AND their ladies, both of whose unrealistic expectations toward one another periodically drive each other to the brink of ... could it be MURDER? This is STRICTLY for laughs -- and of course, paradoxically the best laughs come when a good moral results from the logical playing out of the perfectly orchestrated tomfoolery in this classic film.
We need satire -- much more than we think -- to remain good-natured, even sane. It alone gives us the perspective to let down our self-righteous hair and laugh at ourselves. One is only certain that he has a friend when his friend isn't afraid to insult him once in awhile! Remember the profound psychological function of the Medieval court jester, alone of the King's subjects who could ridicule the King mercilessly ... and so keep him human in aspect. The Marx Brothers knew themselves to be Society's collective court jesters with a holy mission to insult the upper classes, who were taking themselves so perilously seriously in the '20s and '30s.
So, may our insecurities of male and female social prerogatives vanish in a cloud of wholesome laughter in this ingenious stroke of good will -- and may we benefit from more and more good satire in future productions. For it is the perfect irony of this film that its theme is actually the passionate pursuit of harmony between the sexes, and not their mutual demise. Ah, give us a second helping of wit, Sir Terry Thomas!",1078358400,5,1707,4.829351535836177
400152,4,6301968824,"This is one of those films that start out seeming to be about one thing, but turn out at the end to be about something else entirely.  Jack Lemmon is a confirmed (?) bachelor, living in a town house with his valet, Terry-Thomas, when one morning, after a liquor-soaked bachelor party for a friend the night before, he wakes to find himself married (gulp) to the dazzlingly beautiful Virna Lisi.  Trapped in a no-win situation, he cooks up a plot for her murder (only on paper, of course); but, when she disappears, he finds himself on trial for her actual murder.  One of the great comedic courtroom scenes follows.  When the [spoiler] at the end of the film, you realized that you've been duped -- the film, which seemed to be about the joys of woman-hating, turns out to be about one of the great themes of cinema - ""love conquers all"".  Eddie Mayehoff and Claire Trevor are marvelous in supporing roles.",1026950400,17,906,4.567901234567901
400153,4,6301968824,"If you like Jack Lemmon, this is a fun movie. If you do not, then it's an average film.

The sexy italian blonde looks much better on the screen than on this cover. In fact, there are a lot of good looking women in this movie so that's a plus for men so inclined.

Story follows a cartoonist who ends up marrying an Italian immigrant girl who seduced him during a bachelor party after she jumped out of a cake. Her eyes are played out as being magical.

Sort of funny . . . cute plot . . . a few good twists. Interesting court scene.

I won't spoil the ending.

400154,3,6301968824,"Jack Lemmon is Mr. Stanley Ford, a cartoonist  who lives vicariously through his creation, secret  agent Bash Brannigan. He shares a large bachelor  pad with butler and confidant Charles, and has no  intention of ever tying the knot. After a few too  many drinks at a friend's bachelor party, Ford  forgets that lack of intention and wakes up a  married man. His new wife is an exotic Italian who  doesn't speak a lick of English. Yikes! Fearing for  his life and Charles's disapproval, he rushes to his  lawyer's office set on getting a divorce. That's until  his Italian beauty gives him that wanting gaze and  insists that in Italy there is no such thing as divorce.  So what happens next? Bash Brannigan weds,  unhappily. Ford's secret agent is no longer fighting  terrorists, but is instead trying to come up with the  perfect scheme to murder his wife. Unbeknownst to  Mrs. Ford, her husband is sharing his frustrations  and annoyances through his cartoon. But as all you  men know, it's hard to keep something hidden from  a woman, and his wife eventually happens upon a  comic and finds out what he's been writing about.  Will she put the word divorce into the Italian  dictionary, or will Ford find that a loving wife and a  happy marriage isn't so bad after all?",969926400,5,1272,4.677272727272728

Accused of the murder of his wife, Lemmon fires his lawyer to defend himself - his  star witness: the fired lawyer (Eddie Meierhoff). Witness a cross  examination to end all cross examinations. The jury had no choice but to  acquit!  This is the movie that gave us the ""gloppita gloppita""  machine.  Don't miss it - see it as a couple.",948326400,26,475,4.529411764705882

400272,5,6301968824,"Dash Branigan, secret agent, must stay in shape for the next caper; His only hope is to keep his creator, Stanley Ford (Jack Lemmon), in shape. As with all ideal situations Stanley is single and has everything he wants. The efficient English man servant Charles (Terry Thomas) keeps his apartment tidy. Yes life is wonderful. Periodical he must return items to the women whom visits (and leaves.)

What ever you do, do not get too close to those pop-up cakes (the kind that have more than cake inside). Oops, too late for Stanley. Yep he did it. And marries the girl before he can stop himself. The real problem with domestic life is your belly goes to pot. Don't believe me? Look down.

From the title you have guest the perfect solution. As Stanley puts his thoughts to pen and paper in his comic strip, a plan forms and this same paper will be use as evidence when his wife (Virna Lisi) disappears. And everyone is looking at the ""Gloppita-gloppita"" machine

Of course, the clothes are great, too, but it's the stylish apartment that co-stars with Jack Lemmon.

You expect a certain amount of that sort of thing from 1960's movies, but I lost patience with the film when Jack Lemmon drugged Virna Lisi and she humiliated herself in public before collapsing.

400829,4,6301968824,"HOW TO MURDER YOUR WIFE is a comedy featuring Jack Lemmon, Virna Lisi, and Terry-Thomas.  The storyline concerns a successful cartoonist, who bases his cartoon stories on events from the previous few days.  To get an accurate perspective for doing the drawings, Mr. Lemmon hires actors to engage in crimes, gun fights, and chase scenes up and down a fire escape, and dangerous antics about cargo ships or on industrial-sized concrete chutes.  Terry-Thomas is Mr. Lemmon's faithful butler.  Terry-Thomas uses a camera with a telephoto lens to capture the acted crimes, in order to ensure interesting and accurate drawings for the cartoons.  Mr. Lemmon uses an ink pen to copy the photos, when he draws the comic strip.  The actual comic strip was drawn by Mel Keefer.  Crime scenes are not the only subject matter in the comic strip.  Simple events taking place at home also find their way into the strip, such as a real-life episode where Virna Lisi encourages Mr. Lemmon to change a lightbulb.  There are disasterous consequences, and Virna Lisi delivers the comedic retort, ""I only asked you to change the lightbulb, not to invent it.""  There is another scene, where a cistern of gourmet soup is splashed into the fact of a dinner guest, because of the fact that Mr. Lemmon trips over a tiny dog in the dining room.  These are clever scenes, and finely acted.  The movie shows the lightbulb scene and the gourmet soup scene make their way into the published comic strip.

One reason I liked this movie, is that I drew a weekly comic strip for the San Leandro Morning News, and for my high school paper, at the time I was in high school.  My strip was called, ""Smith Umbrella Presents.""  It was like the Far Side cartoons.

PARTIES.  Much of the time in this picture takes the form of lively party scenes, and even though all of the guests are middle aged or elderly, they are indeed lively parties.  Enter Virna Lisi, a beautiful woman who speaks only Italian.  She is lively and vivacious.  (From my own person point of view, I don't really consider a woman to be really beautiful, unless she has at least several publications in biochemistry.)  At any rate, the guests at one of these parties tricks Mr. Lemon into marrying Virna Lisi.  One of the running jokes is that she does not speak a word of English.  Eventually, she is shown speaking broken English.  There is a fair amount of dialogue where Virna Lisi speaks only in Italian, which makes for an entertaining movie or, at least, a movie that is unique for films that are American-made.  At an early party, there is some tongue in cheek ominous talk about the fact that once a man gets married, the wife's mother moves in with the married couple.

THE TRIAL.  Eventually, Mr. Lemmon talks about murdering his wife, and he goes through the motions of dressing a blonde mannequin in a black raincoat (just as Virna Lisi) dresses up in a black raincoat.  Then, he uses a remote control device for operating a steam shovel, and he jumps into the bucket of the steam shovel at night, and maneuvers himself to the top of a chute for concrete, and he dumps the mannequin down the chute.  This is all caught on film by Terry-Thomas, because Terry-Thomas always uses the camera with telephoto lens to capture the play acting, in order to guide Mr. Lemmon for drawing the next day's comic strip.  At any rate, the next day Virna Lisi sees the comic strip draft on the drawing board, and she is upset, so she takes off his ring and abandons Mr. Lemmon.  In short time, the police decide that Mr. Lemmon is the suspect, and he is put into jail, and then there is a murder trial.  The murder trial is sensible, in part, and is also stupid and tedious, in part.

THE SURPRISE ENDING.  The ending has a couple of surprises.  It is a double-surprise ending.  At first I was going to give this movie only THREE STARS, because of the fact that the comedy often takes the form of mere silliness.  A continuing theme in this movie is that American men are henpecked by their wives.  There is a brilliant scene in this movie, where a wife demonstrates one of her techniques in henpecking her husband, that is, by making him feel guilty when in fact he did nothing wrong.  But the premise that American husbands are henpecked is reiterated too many times in this film, resulting in pre-tedium syndrome in the viewer.  In this film, it is sometimes the case that over-the-top episodes are done merely for the sake of being over-the-top.  But the surprise ending turned me around a bit, and so I gave it FOUR STARS.  For really great comedies, I prefer FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF and MONTY PYTHON'S HOLY GRAIL.  I think that HOW TO MURDER YOUR WIFE might make for a fine rental (not a purchase).  For the best of Jack Lemmon, I very highly recommend THE APARTMENT.  In my opinion, THE APARTMENT defines ""perfection"" in the cinematographic arts.",1397174400,,4880,4.610208816705336

400890,4,6301968824,"The climax of this very witty film is reached during his trial for ""murdering"" his wife. (Of course, she is not dead, merely run off to mama after an argument with Lemmon)  All the circumstantial evidence points to his guilt and no matter how persuasive his defense attorney attempts to be, the most likely outcome will be a ""guilty"" verdict.

Determining that his defense attorney will haplessly tie the knot in the noose around his neck, the Jack Lemmon character decides to defend himself.

He calls as his only witness, his defense attorney (Eddie Mayhoff) to the stand.  The Mayhoff character - like members of the all-male jury - is henpecked and hamstrung by an overbearing wife.

Lemmon first qualifies Mayhoffs marriage seeking to bring to the surface the true nature of Mayhoff's relationship with his wife.

Lemmon then approaches the jury and draws a chalk dot on the bar and explains that it is a ""magic button"" that, once pressed, will cause his wife to disappear and - best of all - NOBODY WILL NOTICE.  Just press the button and - whammo! - his wife will no longer exist.

Mayhoff stares into space dreaming of such a scenario - as do the members of the jury, the district attorney and the judge.

Lemmon urges Mayhoff ""press the button, go ahead, nobody will know""  Mayhoff whispers in Lemmon's ear ""Nobody will know?"" . Lemmon replies ""Nobody will know.  Press the button, go ahead"".  Mayhoff reiterates ""NODODY will know?"".  Again, Lemmon answers in the affirmative.

Now the members of the jury are staring off into space.  ""I can ride a tramp steamer!"" muses one juror. ""I can grow a beard"" muses the DA.  Every male in the courtroom is wistfully dreaming now, some getting glaring looks and elbow poked from their wives.

Suddenly, Lemmon announces ""I did it! I murdered my wife! But I ask you to acquit me on the grounds of justifiable homicide.  I ask this not for me, but for you"".

The judge interrupts his closing arguments (dispensing with deliberations) and asks the jury if they have reached a verdict.

""NOT GUILTY!"" answers the jury in unison.

The jury then picks up Lemmon and carries him off on their shoulders.

400896,5,6301968824,"An unintentional antidote to the clumsy, dreary TV series ""Mad Men"" produced fifty-plus years later purportedly about the fifties/sixties, HTMYW is a Hefneresque farce chock-full of rich, bellowing laughs. Lemmon and Terry-Thomas have a comic chemistry second to none.

HTMYW reflects the zeitgeist of the fifties without apology or embarrassment.  What is missing from all of the hyperventilating reviews huffing about misogyny is the fact that marriage in the 1950s and 60s was a prison both for men as well as women. The so-called no-fault, vending machine-style divorce decrees of the Twenty-First Century did not exist back then. ""How"" is the first question your lawyer would ask if you wanted a divorce and did not have ""sufficient legal grounds"" (which indeed would, like Lemmon's stammering divorce attorney in the film, make him sound like a ""demented Indian"").

This plot point is easily overlooked by post-Boomer nabobs, eager to exercise their unfathomable ignorance of the times and apply some sort of PC revisionism to this harmless, rollicking send-up of the ""Playboy After Dark"" set (an actual TV show in the fifties and sixties, starring Hef himself).

BTW, a ""Murder Your Wife"" brick is an actual film industry term describing a harmless foam replica brick prop that could safely be used as a weapon in a fight or murder scene, a show-biz insider homage to this wonderfully entertaining film.

Lastly, Terry-Thomas's supercilious, pontificating yet playfully delinquent English butler is worth the price of admission alone, and his character is the perfect foil to Lemmon's over-the-top playboy rascal and everyone else in this sublimely cast, perfectly paced slice of period ribald romp.",1367971200,,1706,5.327137546468402

Okay, first of all let me say SPOILER ALERT, because I'm more or less going to give away the ending to the movie.

Now that you've been warned, I am going to tell you some of my chief complaints about the movie:

First of all, when Stanley Ford (the main character in this movie) is on trial for murdering his wife, his defense attorney does absolutely NOTHING in the way of mounting a defense for his client! Didn't this guy even go to law school? Why did he even bother showing up for the trial if he wasn't going to defend his client?

Second of all, when Stanley fires his lawyer and takes over the responsibility of defending himself, he CONFESSES to murdering his wife and then proceeds to complain about the huge financial and psychological burden men have to deal with when they're married. He basically argues that he should be ALLOWED TO KILL HIS WIFE because being married is such and arduous and painful cross to bear.

As stupid as this legal defense is, the Judge and the Jury LOVE IT and he is declared not guilty by a judge and jury (all men by the way) who are only too happy to set this man back out on the street.

And this isn't the end of it either! You see Stanley's wife isn't dead! He never even ATTEMPTED to kill her! However by confessing to killing her UNDER OATH, he is now guilty of perjury and might end up in trouble with the law again when it's learned that his wife is still alive!

By the way, I probably shouldn't have to tell you this, but DO NOT see this movie with your wife, your girlfriend, your fianc, or any other woman besides Ann Coulter. Almost all of the male characters in this movie are misogynistic and their words will almost certainly be offensive to your wife, your girlfriend and just about any other woman you know.

I left Ann Coulter in there as an exception. If you haven't read her books you probably don't know this, but she's an even bigger misogynist than most of the men in this movie!",1325462400,,2156,4.319306930693069

Until one night, at a marriage ceremony (his friends) gone wrong, he and his buddies gets drunk and Mr. Lemmon ends up married to the beutiful woman who came out of a cake and she doesn't speak a word of English.  The story then unfolds as he plays out his misery and fantasies of ridding his lovely wife through the cartoon charactors, fantasies, and stories he draws and retaining the bachelorhood he once had.  As this story plays out, he realizes, of coarse, he can't live without her.  It's not my favorite of his old movies, but no one can play this part better than Jack.

The problem is Mr. Ford's new wife is the exquisitely proportioned and delectable Virna Lisi. Mr. Ford meets Charles in a bar where the seed is sown for Bash Brannigan to murder his wife. What follows must be seen to be believed. This is 1960's comedy at its best, with a musical score to match. Jack Lemmon is terrific.

It so impressed me that when the video tape made the scene (mid-1990's)  I snatched up a copy!

Though some may dismiss the film as a tad misogynistic ultimately the film comes down firmly on the side of monogamy and commitment in relationships.  Having been married a little less than two years after 43 years of unwedded bliss I can relate to the trials that Jack Lemmon's everyman cartoonist experiences during the initial stages of matrimony.  The shocks are still a little raw.  I can still remember my wife's insistence that I take my shoes off in the house or her horror over the shaving cream residue in the sink.  I used to go to the movies at least once a week now I watch videos like ""How To Murder Your Wife"" at home.  Regardless, it's a funny movie that singles can enjoy but married people will have a distinct recognition factor.  The voluptuous Virna Lisi is a winsome object for Lemmon's anxieties.  The irrepressible Terry-Thomas is great as Lemmon's man servant.  I particularly liked Claire Trevor, one of filmdoms unsung legends despite her Oscar for ""Key Largo"", as Lemmon's lawyer's straight talking wife.

When one looks around, one sees similar faces, with similar desires, problems and lives.  Jack Lemmon portrays a character that many men relate to, admire, and perhaps long to be.  His lifestyle is the perfect bachelor's lifestyle.  Virna Lisi fits her role perfectly, her being pretty, sexy, innocent and on the road to the ""promised land"".  Lemmon's manservant, Terry-Thomas, is right on the spot, and delightfully displays the bond between the knight and his right-hand man.  But my favorite character is Edna.  She is real, and she does what the Edna's in this world do.  A bold new way to look at ""the marital relationship"".  The ""happy ending"" appears to be politically correct, decades before that term has been forced down our throats.  However, it cleverly ""appears to be so"", and the director succeeds in giving the message that the movie is meant to actually end at the conclusion of Jack Lemmon's trial.  Viewers should pay particular attention to the ""gym"" and the ""gentlemen's club"".  Many will draw parallel lines to their own environments.

What sets ""How to Murder Your Wife"" apart is how it perfectly captures the fantasy of the idealized bachelor lifestyle (Playboy magazine, James Bond, etc.) of the early 1960s.  Jack Lemmon plays a syndicated newspaper cartoonist who lives in a swanky Manhattan townhouse, and is aided and abetted in his adventures by his ""gentleman's gentlemen,"" the hilarious Terry-Thomas.  The film is graced by a Mancini-esque, hepcat-cool music score composed by Neil Hefti; again, a perfect product of its time.

1) While it makes a lot of sense for one of the most beautiful and seductive actresses ever, Virna Lisi, to be cast so that she can be leered at, would any man want to rid himself of her?

2) Even at his most dapper, is Jack Lemmon really the type of man who, as a bachelor, can attract a field full of Virna Lisi's? Shouldn't he be grateful for just one?

Otherwise, it is an honest look at men's inner cynic -- set to comedy so that women will think it's just a lark. Conversely, it's a blood stirring introduction to Virna Lisi (a man-trap if there ever was one) whose real acting talent wasn't fully appreciated by most American males ... for some reason. ;)",1171670400,6,818,4.264516129032258

401164,5,6301968824,"""How to Murder Your Wife"" is by far the funniest 60's comedy I have seen. I thought the supporting cast was outstanding which included Claire Trevor, Terry Thomas (as Jack Lemmon's servent), and Jack Albertson (who had co-starred with Lemmon in ""Days of Wine and Roses""). The two funniest scenes had to be when Lemmon has a bowl of tomato soup and he trips over the rug and it flies over Eddie Mayderoff and the other is when Lemmon talks to his servent at the bar and the way he says 'Murder!' to him about how to get rid of his wife (Virna Lisi does a good job) deserves a laugh and so does how the camera zooms in on his face (great cinematography by the way). The line in the title is what Mayderoff says to Lemmon and it has to be funnier than Dwayne Hickman saying to Jane Fonda in ""Cat Ballou"" which was 'I'm drunk as a skunk!'

401167,4,6301968824,"This wicked little comedy could never be filmed today, and not merely because the dilemma that Stanley Ford (Jack Lemmon) finds himself in has been all but eliminated by ""no fault"" divorce laws.  As Stanley's butler, Charles Burbank (Terry-Thomas), gleefully announces at the beginning, this is a movie for men only.  Women will not appreciate it at all unless they have a good sense of humor; stereotypical feminists would be well advised not to bother.

Stanley Ford, a successful syndicated newspaper cartoonist, is living the perfect Playboy lifestyle: luxurious townhouse, proper manservant, exclusive male only club membership, and, of course, plenty of no-strings-attached sex with beautiful women.  The gimmick that makes his comic strip stand out is that Stanley never asks its hero, Bash Brannigan, to do anything he hasn't already done.  In practice this means that he personally acts out his various capers with the assistance of hired actors while being photographed by his butler and uses said photographs as guides when drawing his strip.

However, at a funereal bachelor party for a friend that turns into a wild celebration after the bride calls the wedding off, an intoxicated Ford proposes to the lady hired to jump out of the cake, the always stunning Virna Lisi.  He wakes up married to her.  Divorce is out of the question because she is Italian (Roman Catholic) and hopelessly in love with him.  Charles storms out, and Stanley's playboy lifestyle is swept away as Mrs. Ford plies him with delicious cooking and sex.  Various misadventures follow to both Stanley and the now also married Bash Brannigan as Edna Lampson (Claire Trevor), battleaxe wife of Stanley's lawyer and friend, Harold Lampson (a hysterically henpecked Eddie Mayehoff), takes Mrs. Ford under her wing and teaches her how to be a full fledged harpy.

After an Edna-inspired Mrs. Ford costs Stanley his club membership he announces that Bash Brannigan at least isn't going to take it anymore.  What follows is Stanley acting out the various parts of his alter ego's murder plans, but when Mrs. Ford reads the final comic strips and guesses that they reflect Stanley's true feelings, she takes off her wedding ring and disappears.  Stanley gets arrested for his missing wife's murder, and a hapless Lampson gets nowhere in defending him.  What follows is one of the funniest courtroom scenes in movie history as Stanley takes over his own defense and launches a last desperate ploy to stave off certain conviction.  A few final twists round out this dated but delicious little comedy that turns out to be a lot less subversive than you might have thought.",1146268800,6,2646,5.050574712643678

401171,3,6301968824,"Yes, I like How to Murder Your Wife, but found the beginning to be as dull as a twice burnt candle.  Only when cartooonist/playboy Stanley Ford (Jack Lemmon) meets the beautiful Italian girl (Virna Lisi) who pops out of the cake at a friend's bachelor party do things begin to pick up.  You will have to wait a half-hour while his lawyer friend tells him how immature he is to be writing a comic strip at 37 years old just because he's been listening to his wife too much.  After seeing his lawyer's wife for a mere 3 minutes, you can understand why Stanley is a bachelor and his butler (Terry Thomas) approves.  I'm a woman and I approve!

Somehow Stanley has not only woken up with the girl in the cake, but he also discovers that they have gotten married!  Worst of all?  She only speaks Italian which Stanley's lawyer's obnoxious wife knows almost fluently, and begins to teach her how to be a harpie as well.  Just like Stanley, I liked her better before  wifey-poo got a hold of her and started her sleeping with rollers in her hair and bossing him around.  If anything, this movie helps you to understand why men like being single and, yes, for a change I'm on their side!

Stanley doesn't want to be married, and he makes his caricature Bash Brannigan suffer his unfortunate homelife situations.  Ironically, his male dominated comic strip becomes a successful family affair and readership picks up.  He's not happy, however, and unleashes the ultimate plan he cannot carry out in real life:  Bash will murder his freedom stifling wife and dump her body into the ""gloppita-gloppita"" machine.  Funny thing though; Mrs. Ford really does disappear, and Stanley is brought up on trial for murder though they can't find her body!  The results of the case are sympathetically histerical, but I won't give the ending away.

I need to point out that, unlike the lawyer's hack wife, Virna Lisi's character as Mrs. Ford is sweet, endearing, and gorgeous, yet she's funny without even trying.  You just root for her because she means well in spite of the ""evil"" lawyer wife influence.  Why do I hate that woman so much?  She tells Stanley's new bride to play head games and this, more than anything, angers me:  She informs her that neither party can hear the other in seperate rooms, yet plays a game with him in which she says she heard him say something derogatory.  ""See that?"" she says triumphantly to Stanley's new wife.  ""They're always feeling guilty about something!""  This old biddie gives women a bad rap way back to the cave days!  Fortunately, Stanley is a very lucky man that his foreign wife can think for herself once the smoke clears.  I also adore her little yorkshire terrier puppy who looks like one I used to have!

Yes, this movie is entertaining and cute after the first half-hour, and it has its charms but, while I would watch it again, I wouldn't buy it.  Of all Lemmon's films, I much prefer  The Apartment or The Days of Wine and Roses.",1121212800,3,2961,4.597328244274809
401172,4,6301968824,"""How To Murder Your Wife"" is a very entertaining comedy, directed with his usual aplomb by Richard Quine, that provides another excellent vehicle for multi-talented Jack Lemmon. It certainly gives us a snapshot of the mid-sixties--cars, clothes, furniture and, of course, attitudes. Perhaps I should add that the ""snapshot"" also reflects the affluent lifestyle of someone who can afford a luxurious townhouse in New York City !

Mr. Lemmon plays Stanley Ford, a successful cartoonist and ""confirmed bachelor"". He wakes up one morning after a crazy bachelor party to find a blonde in his bed ( drop-dead gorgeous Virna Lisi ) , and a wedding ring on her finger--it seems that, while intoxicated, he managed to marry this young woman. To add to his befuddlement, she is Italian and speaks no English. His ""very British"" butler ( scene-stealing Terry-Thomas ) is ""shocked and appalled"" and threatens to leave this severely-compromised masculine environment. The rest of the film is dedicated to our hero's attempts to unload the new wife--by legal means or otherwise--and return to the playboy lifestyle that he champions. There is much more to the plot but, unlike at least one other reviewer, I subscribe to the theory that potential viewers do not wish to be told every scene, plot development and situation in advance.

The witty script is accompanied by an excellent cast. I have already mentioned the priceless Terry-Thomas, who also serves as the film's ""narrator"". Virna Lisi is extremely beautiful and seductive--the scene where she ""pops out of the cake"" at the bachelor party will still quicken the pulse of any red-blooded male  ( and gives rise to the one central flaw in the film--why would any sane guy want to ""dump"" Ms. Lisi ! ? )! Eddie Mayehoff is hilarious as Mr. Lemmon's not-overly-clever lawyer, sympathetic to his client's plight, but also under the thumb of his domineering wife ( Claire Trevor, adding a fine comic performance to her distinguished film career ). Sidney Blackmer also shines in a small role as a judge who is anything but sober ! Finally--there is Mr. Jack Lemmon ( I still miss him )--having a ball as Stanley Ford, a paranoid, insecure, adolescent guy who only thinks he knows the key to true happiness.

I found the picture quality to be excellent--the sound pretty much what you would expect for a forty-plus year old film. There are no extras, except the trailer. Neal Hefti contributes a nice, jazzy score, reminiscent of his ""Odd Couple"" music--or perhaps vice versa !

Hopefully, people will not be discouraged by the ""politically incorrect"" title. This satirical comedy still has more than enough amusing scenes to entertain a modern audience, and the cast is perfect. Try it--you'll like it !",1110153600,72,2741,4.989059080962801
