8289143,3,B001CT6N0Y,"I've seen my fair share of actively bad movies; The Room, Troll 2, Garbage Pail Kids, etc. While this film is not as generally weird as what has been put to film on the worst movies of our time, it is however the most perplexing movie I've seen in regards to intent.

Bad movies are made all the time as a result of greed or over-ambition, but this film, I cannot ascertain in the slightest as to why it was made. It's far too stupid to be educational yet simultaneously too serious to be for kids.

The movie begins like any tween's view of high school; Ezra Chase is your average do-good high schooler dissatisfied with the fact that the proverbial jock douche is once again going to sweep the election for class president. Ezra and his friends come up with the ""cuh-rayze"" idea of Ezra becoming a contender in the election.

This is the whole movie for the first 30 minutes, lighthearted school drama. Ezra has the occasional tiff with his teacher or a one-on-one conversation with his sole female friend to set us up for the inevitable relationship sub-plot. There is a light emphasis on food during these beginning minutes to remind you of what you're watching. In an effort to garner voter support, Ezra stages eating challenges during lunch, such as the gallon challenge or having students contribute food to be blended into a rancid smoothie amalgamation. If you think these food-related exploits are giving context into how Ezra will receive his powers-to-be, oh how wrong you are.

Everything changes for Ezra while giving his campaign speech. Cuts of pastrami begin spewing forth out of Ezra, seemingly from his hands. While the crowd is entertained by Ezra's antics, Ezra runs to the bathroom in bewilderment. In his solitude, Ezra uncontrollably conjures a bakery's worth of bread before copious amounts of mustard begin jet streaming from his...wrists? Instead of being amazed at how someone could transport so much food, the staff react in anger when they gain access to Ezra in a bathroom coated with mustard.

This is where the movie begins to fall apart. Ezra storms to his room upon getting home much to the dismay of his grandmother (who lives with Ezra and his father). Grandma claims to know what Ezra is going through and perfectly details what likely has him so ailed. So here's the deal, Ezra comes from a lineage of people who have the gift of conjuring food (no collective term is given to these food-conjurers, call 'em whatever you want). His grandma, being one of these special people, gives him the 101 on materializing food from all the supposed 59 (?!) food groups. She also whips out a huge book chronicling the lives of past food-conjurers. This results in periodic doses of lore, consisting of an ancestor and their food-related exploits.

For some reason, grandma and the entire food-people lineage see cooking as the perfect profession to complement their gift. That's some pretty basic association there. Apart from saving time on gathering the ingredients, the ability to materialize food doesn't facilitate the art of cooking at all. I instantly conceived two better paths one with such an ability could take:

1. Infinitely conjure food that can be readily sold

2. Go to an impoverished African country and be heralded as a divine figure.

But no, clearly cooking is the way to go. Ezra himself does not take kindly to the idea either, being on track to go to an Ivy League college. Perhaps Ezra can be the one to break the chain of poor life decisions that plagues his family.

And so the movie flounders on, with Ezra facing conflict from two fronts; his personal high school life and his culinary wizardry. This never amounts to much more than Ezra using his power as a magic trick to wow students, much like it did the first time. While Ezra's high school may never tire of his tricks, you certainly will. You'd think once Ezra's power is introduced the film would move beyond the scope of school days and start playing out like a superhero movie, but it is permanently fixated on Ezra's daily academic life.

The movie climaxes in a food fight, where Ezra decides to give up on his college prospects and craft some sort of livelihood with his powers, much to his grandma's satisfaction.  This is where the movie ended, leaving me perplexed. The film was more interested in the ""lore"" of food-mancy than actually doing anything with it. For a movie with the word ""adventures"" in it, I expected more ""adventure"" than ""Degrassi"". It was confusion from decisions like these that made the film's hour and a half length feel dragged out to one easily over two hours.

I have accepted that I will never know several things. I will never know how the foreign kid in my sophomore English class managed to write a B-worthy paper. i will never know why kids walked towards the opposite direction of the school on Thursday mornings. And I will certainly never know just why this movie was made, but I'll be damned if I say I don't think about it.",1391385600,4,4982,4.71921749136939
