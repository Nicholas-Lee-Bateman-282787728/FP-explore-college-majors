8550080,4,B00ADNL7II,A Father's Choice and Wrangler are very good movies and the quality is good.  The Over the Hill Gang was very poor quality and unbearable to watch due to the bad filming/picture quality.  But the other two movies make it well worth the cost!,1409011200,,241,4.454545454545454
8550081,5,B00ADNL7II,"The triple family package is great as they have a variety of 3 types of movies. Justice, truth and humor with a great story in each. We thoroughly enjoyed each one. It is hard to pick a favorite out of the group and we are loaning to other family members to view.",1380758400,,263,4.076923076923077
