766938,5,6304059671,"The only question I had concerning the 4 films following the ""Return To Dodge,"" was - why would Matt choose to live in the Tombstone - Tuscon area of Arizona? The only answer I could come up with is because the silly scriptwriters decided to put him there for their own purposes. I could not otherwise imagine why Matt would of himself make such a decision - after having spent 20 years as Marshall of Dodge City, decide to ""retire"" in what was possibly the most lawless area of the US? Well. that was not the only question that burned in my mind - I was also asking myself. ""Why aren't Chester & Festus apppearing somewhere in these 5 films?"" Oh well, I am grateful for these films, each of which is excellent & worth 5 stars & have greatly appreciated & enjoyed the journey I took after acquiring DVDs of the 20 years in Dodge City when Matt looked oh so young to the final film made, ""One Man's Justice,"" when Matt looked oh so old. In a Q&A page about this movie online, this comment is made about it: "".... a scarf hid Arness' neck, probably to hide his age. Makeup has difficulty covering an aged neck."" Well makeup sure couldn't do much to hide Matt's age reflected in his face.

As long as there are DVDs available of Gunsmoke & these 5 films, Matt Dillon & his friends will ride on. There has been no finer example I think of virtuous living & courage than Matt Dillon.",1354924800,10,1378,4.3
766939,5,6304059671,"James Arness stars as Matt Dillon in the final feature  full movie  of Gunsmoke . Jim is looking older  and it  makes no difference for us fans, as he is yet strong and wise and  holds his own in every scene.  From 2-10-94.",1354320000,4,223,4.069767441860465
766940,5,6304059671,"The Gunsmoke films of Matt Dillon as a retired aged Marshal, produced by James Arness, have good, mature stories, and are by no means grade B westerns. A stage coach carrying Dillon's daughter and her husband, an affable salesman, and a mother with a 15 and a 9 year old son, is chased and robbed by a band of five outlaws, who wound Dillon's son-in-law and shoot the mother. We learn later that these bandits had robbed a train and taken $60,000, which raises the question, why bother with the small pickings of a stage coach robbery. Dillon owns a ranch nearby and the survivors are taken there, where the mother dies from her wounds. Her eldest son, although only 15, leaves at night to find the five killers and avenge his mother, leaving his 9 year old brother to grieve both the loss of his mother and his abandonment. Dillon and the salesman feel they must help the 15 year old who will certainly be killed without their help, and they pursue him. Predictably, the boy is almost killed, but saved by a strange Indian wearing glasses and later by Dillon and the salesman. During various adventures, the salesman shows himself to be quite good at handling a gun and fighting with his hands, but he refuses to tell Dillon about his background.",1294012800,16,1247,4.571428571428571
766941,5,6304059671,I'VE LOOKED FOR THIS MOVIE FOR A LONG TIME AND I AM SO PLEASED I HAVE ALL FIVE GUNSMOKE MOVIES NOW. I RECEIVED THIS MOVIE VERY FAST FROM THE TIME I ORDERED IT TO WHEN IT WAS DELIVERED TO MY DOOR AND THE QUALITY WAS EXCELLENT AND IN THE USUAL GUNSMOKE TRADITION OF GOOD QUALITY WESTERN ACTION. I WOULD ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.,1259625600,3,330,4.171875
766942,5,6304059671,"In the hundreds of episodes of Gunsmoke, Dodge City seemed to be in a
time capsule - unchanging. This contributed to its classic and classy
quality. The final made-for-TV Gunsmoke movie changed this with the
recurring theme that retiree Matt Dillon was approaching the threshold
of the 20th century. This is acceptable because, after all, Wyatt Earp
lived well into the 1920s. Signs of modernity included eyeglasses
on an reservation Indian, a victrola in a baudyhouse,
turmoil in Revolutionary Mexico, a bandit leader who perhaps escaped
famine in Europe and not an American civil war survivor. But most of all,
a lever-action shotgun that changed the odds in the final gunfight.
The signs of change added to this movie, like the
Bicycle Scene in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""

Matt Dillon is depicted as becoming a successful cattle rancher after starting
his retirement as a humble trapper in the first Gunsmoke movie
""Return To Dodge.""
Nostalgic baby boomers who enjoy the legendary Gunsmoke series might
be inspired by how the legendary US marshal made a second career
in an age before pensions and social security.

It is extraordinary when fictional characters take on a life in our
collective imaginations. One can think of Don Quixote in Spain,
Sherlock Holmes in London, Evangeline in Louisiana, Huckleberry Finn
on the Mississippi River, Captain Nemo on the ocean floor.
Matt Dillon and his friends in Dodge City, Kansas, have achieved
the same iconic stature",1190073600,19,1478,5.103305785123967

767253,5,6304059671,"I have already reviewed the James Arness Movie transformation from the series in my review of the fourth Gunsmoke movie ""The Long Ride"" so I will not do that again. This was far better than the fourth movie in my humble opinion. Then again, the whole person being guilty having to prove their innocence is really played out in the western genre and that was the basis of the fourth movie. The basis of this movie is quite different. Again, let me just say that James Arness is just too old to play Matt Dillon anymore. Here he is 71 years old. Yes, he pulls it off, but not as well as he did a year before. Now, the basis of this movie, a stagecoach is robbed, a boys mother is killed and that boy wants revenge. The boy is 15 years old, and goes after the killers. Matt of course goes after the boy and the killers and the story ensues. There are a couple of interesting plot twists and turns as well as a surprise or two. Watch out for Six Eyes, he's an integral part of the show  in my opinion. It's a standard Gunsmoke story, with Matt seeming desperately wanting out at every turn. Who can blame him, he is after all 71 years old and it shows. He just wants to run his cattle ranch and get back to his daughter and son in law. The story is a solid entry into the set of movies. This was the fifth and last movie James Arness did reprising the iconic role of Matt Dillon.

If you are a Gunsmoke fan, you will like this one.  Even if there is no Dodge City and one of the Dodge  City characters.",1497916800,3,1498,4.102389078498294

767360,5,6304059671,Not much more can be said regarding James Arness. No matter what movie he is in it is still James Arness. I did not jnow hw had done more things after Gunsmoke was over. This movie is very good and worthy of watching over & over. It seems he has always lived this type of life but I found out differently when I read his autobiography which was very good and one has a different feeling for him. I intend to read it again as I do this with books I like. Buy this from Amazon and you will not be sorry.,1484265600,,501,3.9215686274509802

767479,5,6304059671,"I'm a die hard Gunsmoke fan. Grew up watching every episode as it first aired  as well as the tv movies. James Arness was 70 when he made his last film as Matt Dillon and still had more vigor in the role than men half his age. The story itself is rather average for Gunsmoke. Kid sees his mother murdered and seeks revenge on his own, Dillon goes after him to prevent said kid from getting himself killed. Outlaws die .  There are a couple twists this time around, but  that is the essential tale. ""One Man's Justice"" is typical Gunsmoke and I love it.",1481241600,7,552,4.238095238095238
