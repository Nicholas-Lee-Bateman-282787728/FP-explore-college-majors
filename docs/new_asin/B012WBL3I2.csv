7358584,5,B012WBL3I2,"From Il Volo Takes Flight, to We Are Love, to Buon Natale, to LIve from Pompeii, they went through a lot of changes.  Hard to believe it's been only 4 years.  They are growing up and so is their music  They are still so young and still as wonderful as always.
Wish them the best and a very very long and successful career.",1443312000,8,322,4.079365079365079
7358585,4,B012WBL3I2,"Il Volo, what a wonderful pairing of these three fine young men. Have thoroughly enjoyed them since they first premiered their first CD and DVD.  The boys can really sing, and each can hold their own, individually.  As for this latest DVD release...I immediately felt I would not be too happy about it as soon as the DVD started playing, and the sound came through, or should I say, lack of it...  Had to put the volume very loud to be able to hear their beautiful voices and the great orchestra that accompanied them.
 No, the problem is not with my Audio/Video system, I have top notch equipment as I am a true adiophile, quality of sound is so very important to me
The boys, as usual, were very enteratining as were the song selection.  But, I just could not get past that inferior sound..and then, there is no Blu-Ray release, was hoping it would be, as I would imagine we would get an option for 5.1 or DTS, but no.  Was very disappointed, but, only with the sound quality.
Wish I could rate it 10 stars, but due to the sound issue, I can only give it four stars.  Shame...",1443225600,24,1078,4.333333333333333
7358586,1,B012WBL3I2,I have a 1000 watt Home Theater just so I can watch a Concert and feel like I was there in audience. The Sound Quality was recorded in a very low  volume and in fact it was louder when I watch this in a PBS Special. I waited for over a Month for this to come in only to be disappointed in the Quality Sound which robs the Beautiful Passion and Energy of this Fine Performance. Save your Money.,1443225600,17,393,3.9746835443037973

7358636,5,B012WBL3I2,"As an Italian-American, it is so delightful to hear old tunes reminiscent of my childhood, and share them with my son.  Il Volo is a beautiful fusion of new and old, paying homage to some of the most accomplished singers and songwriters of the Italian and Italian-American tradition with their grace and talent.  My very favorite feature on this dvd is Piero Barone's chilling rendition of E lucevan le stelle.  Seeing him perform it live was one of the best moments of my life.  I love having this special on in the background during family gatherings and Sunday dinner.  A lovely gift to any Italian-American who loves to feel close to their heritage.",1485993600,2,653,4.743362831858407

7358700,5,B012WBL3I2,"So I just finished watching this incredible DVD, which was able to work on my DVD player. Oh my god!!! I'm so glad I went online shopping on a snow day and bought it. Those three young Italian guys sounded so unbelievable and beautiful! All of the songs on there are from their recent album ""Grande Amore"", and a couple of them are sung the second time in Spanish. And then each of the guys has their own solo...Ignazio's ""Unchained Melody"" is so tender with a lot of passion, Gianluca's ""Anema e Core"" is absolutely beautiful, and Piero's ""E Lucevan Le Stelle"" is so stunning and powerful that it almost feels like a religious experience. Watching this concert just makes you appreciate how much emotion and passion they put into each song. You can even see the playful interaction between the three of them. If you haven't owned an Il Volo live DVD yet, then go check out this one. In my case, it's best to watch it while you're having a glass or two of your favorite wine...like I did because today was National Drink Wine Day...LOL! Anyway, I'm so happy to be a fan of this amazing classical pop trio.",1455753600,3,1105,4.475247524752476

Way too much time spent looking at the audience!!!  I want to be watching Il Volo!!!!  All around not their best DVD, but not their fault.  They were fantastic (as usual).  I'd say if you're getting your first Il  Volo DVD, select the Michigan (Takes Flight) one or some other, but not this.  Once you're a die hard fan and just have to have everything they've ever done  :)  then get this one to complete your collection.  They are amazing.

7358722,5,B012WBL3I2,"I have a problem with the DVD, but it has nothing to do with low volume in the sound, it is recorded at standard DVD levels, at least with the copy I have, no my problem is that it played on PBS in 5.1 channel surround, the disc is only 2 channel stereo, which to be fair is beautifully recorded, just not what I expected and wanted, and why no BLU-RAY?, OK, enough carping, their voices remind me very much of a young Carreras, Domingo, Pavarotti, and with a little more maturity I am sure they will equal the masters, now about this DVD musically it is astonishing, they open with a very well done IO CHE NON VIVO ISENZA TEJ, that sets the mood for the rest of the album (yes album) but Delilah is a show stopper, spectacular, the orchestra, the boys and especially the drummer (who is the bomb, and sounds like one) do a rousing version that just get my pulse racing and the hair on the back of my hands stand on edge, lets skip to eternally, the boys sing this with such emotion and conviction that I believe they are each singing it to someone special, beautiful, never heard it sung better by anyone, much of the same can be said of ""you don't have to say you love me"" wow, such beautiful harmony, believe me, you will not be disappointed in the music, and if you get a good copy, as I did, and don't care about the lack of 5.1 surround, you should be very pleased, by the way, the video is one of the best DVD'S I have ever seen, although I still want BLU-RAY and 5.1, this is still well worth getting",1450656000,7,1508,4.167808219178082

I was able to listen to some of the concert while watching it on a laptop, but when it runs through a regular audio / video system, it's a disaster. It's a pity because the recordings of the songs on CD or MP3 are outstanding, and their vocals have never been better. Whoever did this should be fired immediately, and all of the customers should get a free remastered and remixed replacement because this is the biggest injustice ever done to some of the best singing out there. These young men are really performing live, yet get their work mauled by bad professionals.

7358805,3,B012WBL3I2,"Have always enjoyed Il Volo..but why have it in Pompeii and not show something of the city...ugly colored lights on the adjoining ruins just doesn't do it for me.  It's a wonder of the world and they didn't even show it...although it got fourth billing as their co-star...who never really made an appearance.  Also...on this particular DVD they sing loud, louder, and loudest...nothing subtle like some of their other recordings like SMILE which I think is one of the most beautiful renditions of that song ever done...I watched it and gave it away...",1444176000,3,551,4.913978494623656

7358807,2,B012WBL3I2,The sound on this DVD is really bad. The voices are drowned out by the background music. They needed a different sound engineer.  The performance was very good otherwise.,1444089600,3,170,4.862068965517241
7358808,5,B012WBL3I2,"Il Volo is a vocal act that came to us in the nick of time, to ""save"" classical music for our children and grandchildren. These young men have voices to delight the soul hungry for melody, majestic voices and professional musicianship. The sound is Bocelli infused with youthful vitality, drama, and charismatic, compelling charm. The DVD was filmed during a concert presented in the amphitheater of the ruins of Pompeii, giving a definite ""old world"" flavor to the event. There are several songs sung in English, but the majority of them are in Italian, and there is even a bit of fun dancing to ""Volare"", a sequence that is one of my two favorite parts of the concert. Nearly all of the selections show off the wonderful vocal range of each young man. My least favorite song in this presentation is ""Delilah"" - because of it's theme of violence to a woman, which seems to run counter to all of the respect and love Il Volo shows to their female fans and to their own mothers, sisters, aunts and grandmother(s). That said, the song is very well done, and the ""jealous fighting"" they do to illustrate the lyrics is very well done..",1444003200,6,1131,4.603960396039604

Love Il Volo! Own all their DVD Concerts
Ordered Il Volo Pompeii in advance of release.
Received DVD 10/4/15.
This Sony release is terrible in quality.
Whoever mixed this Concert forgot to monitor VOLUME
Every DVD concert I own would blow the roof off with 7 Ch. volume set at 16, this DVD is barely audible.
Returned it and Amazon sent me a second DVD. Same Issue, disappointed again!
Returned second DVD as well.
As of 10/4 reviews showed a cumulative 1 & 2 rating of 25% dislike because of Volume Issues,
now its somehow down to 22%. Hard to believe given the second DVD I just Received on 10/5/15 one day later
has same issue! VERY LOW VOLUME!
Advice, wait 6 months for this to be corrected. Hope Amazon advises Sony of the issue.
Thank you Amazon for Excellent Customer Service!",1444003200,28,935,5.3175675675675675

7358811,5,B012WBL3I2,Excellent representation of what these guys are all about.  My one disappointment is that my current fave Per Te Ci Saro was not included.  Il Volo's voices just keep getting better and better.  Kudos to the musicians too - they are awesome in their own right.  So happy with this.,1443916800,,281,4.56
7358812,5,B012WBL3I2,Pre ordered my copy and couldn't wait for it to arrive. Another great concert by Il volo. Although nothing beats seeing them in person. They just get better and better. Got to love Piero singing E Lucevan Le Stelle. He nails it as my husband says. Can't wait to see them live again.,1443744000,,282,4.339622641509434
7358813,5,B012WBL3I2,"Absolutely delightful!  Their voices are heavenly.. mesmerizing.. And seeing them ""in action"" is purely enchanting. Their individual personalities shine -- with humor and wit. They are natural born entertainers!",1443657600,7,211,6.275862068965517
7358814,2,B012WBL3I2,"With speakers turned to 100%, you still can barely hear it.  What a disappointment.  Love their music, but can't appreciate with this bad audio.
Never had to return any CD before.",1443484800,23,179,4.741935483870968

7358816,5,B012WBL3I2,"If you love Il Volo as we do, you will love this one also.  Having watched the concert the several times it appeared on PBS, we knew what to expect with the sound.  We do not know much about sound engineering, but it seems that that unseen person in the sound booth has turned up the volume on the orchestra and way down on the singers.  All we hear is the drummer!  Even so, we shall enjoy it often, just as we do the other Il Volo dvds.",1443484800,26,438,3.9431818181818183
7358817,5,B012WBL3I2,"I have been following these boys since 2011, they were just school boys with a great big talent, in these short years they are now young men and they have become consummate , world class singers and world famous.  They deserve every accolade they get, they are fantastic and this DVD is terrific as I had expected. Some people commented on the sound, it was a little weak and that is true , but just crank it up, I have my TV hooked up to a Stereo system so it was fine to me. Anyway this is  first class entertainment, thanks BOYS another great DVD, I will see you in march in Ft. Myers florida for your concert, Looking forward to it, you finally made it to my home town!  I had to go to Tampa and Miami for your other concerts, this time you came to me:)  thank you.",1443398400,14,769,4.1066666666666665

7358819,2,B012WBL3I2,"What's up Sony U.S./Latin????
I am sooooooooooo disappointed and upset, YOU HAVE  NO IDEA!!!!!

I CAN BARELY HEAR IL VOLO  SING ON THIS DVD CONCERT!!!!!

It's not my audio equipment either!

I, too, am an Extreme Audiophile, who takes pride in my superb equipment!

I've been waiting for this DVD, for what feels like FOREVER!

I had to turn off the concert,  when they just began singing the FIRST SONG , ""Grande Amore!""

I'm going to order another DVD.... reluctantly, and PRAY THAT THIS **NEW** DVD CONCERT WORKS, BUT....PROPERLY!!!!!

I should have checked this on September 25, 2015, when I received it and read the first review here on Amazon.com!
This poor woman wrote the samesame review as me!!!!!! I know how she feelsfeels,  and now I know we are not alone, because of a reading  at least ONE other reviewer with this VERY SAME PROBLEM!!!!!!",1443398400,31,852,4.760273972602739
