8604642,5,B006GT569E,"A great teaching DVD like all of Shawn's '101' Dance DVDs. This one teaches 5 different couples line dances.  Our teens learned the ""Cactus Cha Cha"" in a couple hours an afternoon before a dance, and put on a great show. It is a graceful, easy, yet showy dance. When they did the dance to a faster song, I actually thought it was a different dance.  Line dances take the pressure off of the guys - no leading here - both partners need to know what they are doing. :)Very fun!  A favorite!",1367452800,3,488,4.225806451612903
