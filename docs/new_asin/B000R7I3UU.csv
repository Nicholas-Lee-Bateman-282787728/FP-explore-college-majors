8199369,2,B000R7I3UU,this is just an exercising video. It really does not touch too much on self defense. What little it does touch on in that area is not easy to follow.,1377129600,,149,4.0
8199370,4,B000R7I3UU,I bought this tape so that I could work out and learn self defense techniques at the same time. The tape was easy enough to follow. The novice can learn how to protect oneself. I felt it was a great workout tape. I am a 54 year old female that works out moderately. I think with practice I will master the moves. I certainly recommend this tape to anyone that exercises and or wants instructions on self defense tips.,1352764800,2,417,4.291139240506329
8199371,3,B000R7I3UU,Although I found his moves great I couldn't help but be distracted by the people surrounding him. For this dvd to work best you need a partner and as far as cardio with the defense moves it didn't really work for me.,1279497600,2,216,4.166666666666667
8199372,5,B000R7I3UU,"The moves in this workout are very similar to the kick boxing moves you may have already done in TaeBo or a number of other kick boxing videos or classes.

What makes this video stand out from the purely fitness DVDs is there is a ""techniques"" section that clearly demonstrates the proper form of all the punches and kicks. Then the instructor goes on to explain how you would use the moves in a personally threatening situation. So instead of just throwing your arms in blocks and punches day after day, you begin to learn how to put a few moves together to break out of a grapple
The instructor is encouraging as you go through the workout, and often says ""good job"". It helps to make you feel like you can get through the workout & maintain a positive attitude. :)

I am very impressed with this first DVD in the SAVE series of workouts, and I will be buying the rest of this series of workouts.",1203379200,11,898,4.339285714285714
