7479741,5,B016S5ZFAK,"""Marco Polo"" is sweeping, engaging, and thought provoking. There is love, manipulation, cruelty, scandal, and lies around every corner, and all is fair when done in the name of maintaining and expanding the empire. I get that this version is an adaptation painted with a broad brush, but if you give it a chance, you will be hooked! Benedict Wong absolutely disappears into his characterization of ""The Khan of Khans"" and astounds with a multi-faceted portrayal. Particularly if you are waiting for GoT to start up again, this will fill that void!",1450742400,19,547,4.956521739130435
7479742,5,B016S5ZFAK,this I watched on Netflix better than any story line of its type superb acting. watched it 3 times.,1450569600,4,99,4.2631578947368425
7479743,5,B016S5ZFAK,"Marco Polo is slow out the gate. The first episode is pretty boring but it's important to watch to know the story. After that, Marco Polo turns into a truly amazing show that deserves your attention. Benedict Wong IS Kublai Khan. He is perfect at his role and truly becomes the ruler of the Mongol Empire. Lorenzo Richelmy as Marco Polo takes some time to get used to, but his acting gets better and better from each passing episode. And don't let me forget about the music! I love it (especially the main title). Overall, MP is an underrated series that is thrilling, well acted and a true hit for Netflix.",1445385600,52,607,4.4774774774774775

7479757,4,B016S5ZFAK,"I would like to start this out by saying I chose to watch this series at random one night at Netflix and completely got sucked in by Benedict Wong and Tom Wu. I tend to buy series I feel pretty strongly about, and this one made the cut.

My main gripe is with my blu-ray package. I cannot speak on behalf of many, but my season 1, disc 2 blu-ray does not read on my player. 1 and 3 are fine, but my PS4 gives off the old ""unrecognizable disc"" message. Not really a reason to flame up an entire thread, but a minor inconvenience for someone looking to own the series. Most likely just a defective product on my end.",1492300800,2,614,4.074380165289257

7479774,3,B016S5ZFAK,"Historically far from being accurate! Serial created for ""Game of Thrones"" funs, promoting violence, blood, nudity, sex and Kung-fu. That's what the package you'll get.

7479777,2,B016S5ZFAK,"Content wise would be great - but who needs the sexual explicit scenes? Would be more tasteful without it and Certain scenes could been suggested or in shadows. Some episodes were soft porn. And some violence too graphic. We all know what happened but a more tasteful portrayal would have made this more valuable and classic. As it was it, it got drug it into the gutter and lost the epic value. Too bad.",1484524800,3,404,4.472972972972973
7479778,4,B016S5ZFAK,Great script and production! The only thing missing is some attention to the regular life of regular Mongols and Chinese.  It would create a larger and more natural context to a story instead of limiting it to a court drama.,1484438400,,224,4.6

7479798,3,B016S5ZFAK,"On the basis of four episodes, I find this series visually arresting, but the plot is slow moving.  Marco Polo's relationship with his own father is poorly-defined, and his role at the court of Kubla Khan is more that of an observer than an active participant. This may have been true historically, but it does little to arouse audience interest.  By contrast, in ""Versailles,"" the young Louis XIV, his androgynous brother, Phillip, and their various lovers, male & female, pull the viewer in immediately.  ""Marco Polo"" may improve as the series develops, but the first four episodes leave me wanting to care more about the central character, and to feel greater involvement in the events depicted.",1476489600,5,698,5.0

7479823,4,B016S5ZFAK,The story of young Marco Polo is very interesting. The acting is good. It is important to remember this is a very adult program. The ways of the Mongols under Kubla Khan is not easy. The only problem I had was putting together when the location switched between the Chinese and Mongols. All in all it was good and I am looking forward to the second season.,1475280000,,356,4.3283582089552235
7479824,3,B016S5ZFAK,"Not sure why it's called Marco Polo instead of Kublai Khan, since he's a) the central character and b) the better actor.  Otherwise, it's a great way to pass a quiet Sunday afternoon on the couch.  (But it's no Vikings!)",1474502400,2,220,4.475

7479830,4,B016S5ZFAK,"although not familiar with any of the actors they actually do a good job. It is about how Marco Polo came to be in China. A lot about the character of Chinese court, wars, and Kublai Khan's personality. For mature audiences, some nudity and violence. But interesting look at 2 cultures trying to merge - Chinese and Mongolian and very different ways of doing things.",1472860800,,366,4.6461538461538465

7479833,3,B016S5ZFAK,"I know that some extreme liberties with historical truth are taken in TV series like this. Yes, there is some doubt that Polo even went to China and he may well have fabricated his travel tale. What I found to be an absolutely egregious concoction, in Episode 10 (the last) in the first Season, was the writers description of the trebuchets Polo allegedly built. I don't know what drugs he was on, or what meds he skipped, but the writer had Alexander the Great using trebuchets at the siege of Tyre. The trebuchet was invented in the 1100s AD, over 1400 years AFTER the siege of Tyre. If this absurdity was not bad enough, it was further alleged that the siege of Tyre took 13 years! Alexander became king of Macedon at age 20 in 336BC on the death of his father, Philip. Alexander died in 323BC at age 32. If this hack's timeline is accurate, Alexander did nothing else in his kingly life than besiege Tyre. The actual siege of Tyre lasted from January to July 332BC, a whopping 6 months!",1472169600,,990,4.445054945054945
7479834,5,B016S5ZFAK,"This is a fantastic series. I am always a fan of historical based films and shows and this one does not disappoint. Even if you know nothing about this period in history of of the Khan dynasty you will come up to speed quickly. I don't know how accurate all of the details are but it very exciting entertaining and filled with beautiful costuming, complex characters and plot twists. I would highly recommend this series for anyone who likes history.",1471392000,7,450,4.6375
7479835,4,B016S5ZFAK,Great sets and costumes help to overcome the occasional silly martial arts scenes.  Story is more about Genghis Khan than Marco Polo but that's okay.  Khan is a great character.,1470873600,,177,4.866666666666666

7479847,2,B016S5ZFAK,"It's a good show if you don't really care for Mongol or Chinese culture.  It's good even if you don't care about Marco Polo.  It has plenty of women in fine silk with plenty of gongs to go with it.  With a reported budget of $90 million to make 10 episodes, more than that of the first season of Game of Thrones, it's obvious that a significant portion of the budget was spent on female characters undressing or moaning their way onto the screen asap.  If you're expecting epic Lord of the Rings style combat between armies, you're not going to find any of that here.  You won't even find Game of Thrones style combat here.  The clash of armies in Marco Polo is a basically a short staring contest which either ends up being a one-on-one combat to the death or replaced by a painting of the battle on a wall with narration.  You actually get to see a mediocre clash in the final episode.

It's unfortunate that Marco Polo stuck to the typical formula of a Western made movie of Asia.  A White adventurer shows up initially against his will and even before he is to fulfill the mandatory requirement of becoming a kung fu master as all White males in Asia should, young and eligible princesses quickly lose their virginity to him before the audience has a chance to learn anything about the characters.  But there is always that one princess that is quite out of reach who is burdened by that one very needy Asian male character and then by another who just can't seem to get it up.  Marco just can't make himself leave Asia when pressured to because there's always that burdened princess that needs rescuing from scheming whisker twirlers that keeps him staying so the audience gets to watch the adventurer brown nose his way through ten undramatic episodes to plough her.",1469664000,2,1772,4.523510971786834
7479848,2,B016S5ZFAK,"I am really disappointed that they threw in porn. The rest was really interesting, but then they kept on throwing in full nudity and sex in a very graphic way, which to me is very degrading. Another series bites the dust. It had potential.

7479858,5,B016S5ZFAK,I read the earlier reviews of a slow start but I was caught immediately. It is a rarity to have a show you can dis rive as exotic and the intrigue is first rate and nuanced. It does not have any dragons or fantasy but some kicking martial arts. I hope it lasts many seasons.,1467244800,,274,4.0

7479874,4,B016S5ZFAK,"Very enjoyable series overall.  For my taste, there was too much talking and not enough action.  We're talking about the Mongol empire for crying out loud, one of the most violent empires in history and there's maybe twenty minutes of fighting in a ten hour season that is set during a time when the Mongol empire is at war or close enough to make no difference.  There could have been more martial arts training sequences, or battles, or assassins; dueling could have been a thing.  Just something to break up the lip-flapping, whining and machinations.

7479880,5,B016S5ZFAK,"Excellent series, even though the Chinese and Mongolians speaking colloquial English might take one aback. The sets and attention to detail are amazing. I taught English in China and saw such interior architecture in person. There is a look and feel to the massive wooden furniture that cannot easily be copied today.

The actor portraying Marci Polo is fair -- if a bit too contemporary -- but the actor portraying Kublai Khan makes a compelling centerpiece, even with his remarkable English skills. Joan Chen, whom I used to have a crush on, portrays his wife with rather ""mixed"" tastes. The young lady passing herself off as royalty while harboring a secret lust for Polo, later to jump his bones after she reveals that she is actually a peasant, is lovely to look at, as are the other Asian lasses (dressed or undressed). As in this country, wealth and power bring privileges, and this includes one's tastes in concubines.

This, of course, is fiction based on a real-life explorer, but the adventure and intrigues do make for enjoyable viewing.",1462147200,2,1049,4.887640449438202

Each episode offers drama without melodrama, and history without obvious rewriting or fictitious additions.  I was carried along by each person's story, with characters that I could believe in and bond with.  Yes, the physical human beauty on display and the lavish clothing, scenery and architecture made the series watchable all by itself!

7479906,4,B016S5ZFAK,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Netflix has made the movie to producing their own series to fill out any void left in programming that theyve lost. For the most part the items theyve offered so far have been amazingly well done. With their first foray into historical drama they hit the mark with this series. Any alteration of history isn't apparent but one thing the series may do is inspire people to delve deeper into the world of Marco Polo and Kublai Khan.

The series opens with Marco (Lorenzo Richelmy) dreaming of the day when he can meet with his father and learn to be a trader just as he is. His father left before even learning he had a son so their reunion isn't the joyous moment one would hope for. His father plans on leaving him behind once more as he heads for China but young Marco hides aboard the boat his father has hired and becomes a part of this expedition.

Traveling the Silken Road to reach in search of spices and goods, the expedition dwindles down to just a few members before reaching the court of Kublai Kahn (Benedict Wong), the grandson of Genghis Kahn and current ruler of his portion of China. In an effort to establish trust and a trade agreement, Marcos father agrees to leave his son as hostage/slave to Kahn which he accepts, all without discussing it with Marco prior. Left behind he must learn the ways of the new world he finds himself in and the people who live there.

But the series isn't just about discovering a new way of life. Instead it offers the many court intrigues of the time, presenting them as equal to the trials and tribulations of the more often filmed stories of the rise of England between its kings and queens. What we witness here is just as interesting if not more so with more deadly consequences dealt to those who are found out.

Kahn becomes enamored of the young foreigner and keeps him nearby in his court. They discuss the world and the Kahns place in it as well as the differences found from one culture to the next. And when plots arise that might affect the ruler ship of Khan, he seeks minor advice from Marco to mull over, not always accepting what he hears. This develops an enemy for Marco as the Khans son Prince Jingim (Remy Hii) becomes jealous. While he need not worry, he does so, always fearful of disappointing his father.

The court surrounding the Khan holds many who could be considered as caring only for their self-interest. In addition to that the Chinese emperor dies early on in the series leaving behind his child age son in his place. A member of the court there, Jia Sidao (Chin Han), seeks to take control of the government and in a quest for power and a dislike for the Mongols does everything he can to force war between the two, going so far as to force his sister to become a concubine of Khan to spy on him.

The series is quite interesting and filled with sumptuous visuals in everything for the costumes to the sets to the countryside as seen through the eyes of young Marco. The cinematography is astounding and many scenes that are shot have such beauty that they could be stills featured in a gallery. It turns what could have been a second rate series into a feast for the eyes.

The performances here are wonderful as well. For me the true test of an actor is to be so immersed in their performance as to think they ARE who they are portraying, to never notice or consider that they are an actor performing a role. Every actor in this film carries that off with ease, making you love the heroes and hate the villains.

Perhaps the only drawback to this series is the amount of nudity and sexual content on view. This series is definitely not something to pass along to a young student looking for information on Polo or China, not that it would offer tons of definitive historical content. The world of the concubine, the orgiastic background scenes of the Khan, the use of prostitutes and the like fill the screen in full frontal visuals in almost every episode. Ive always said that cable programs have consistently inserted this sort of material in an attempt to differentiate themselves from standard television, considering it a way to entice viewers away from the major networks. It adds little to the story and can become tedious at times. But if that doesnt bother you or if thats what you're looking for youll find it here.

In the end I found this series to be thoroughly enjoyable and look forward to watching the next season when it appears. Who knows what the world will hold in store for Marco Polo in the future? At least as how he is portrayed by Netflix.",1453334400,12,4608,4.475
7479907,4,B016S5ZFAK,"The main element to this 10part Netflix Original Series is Kublai Khans desire to unite the kingdoms under his rule and how young Marco Polo becomes involved. Beneath these grand events the series is rich with adventure, drama, desire, loyalty, treachery, some humor, more nudity, and plenty of action. The production quality is excellent and there are many well developed characters brought to life by a very solid cast of actors. Any fan of the History Channels Vikings or BBC Americas The Last Kingdom might want to give this a try.

(On January 7, 2015 the series was renewed for a second 10episode season.)

As to the actual DVD release, the 4discs come undesirably packed on a single spindle. The bonus features are actually special, in particular, the 38minute Marco Polo documentary. Not knowing much about the Italian explorer it was good to see the attempts at historical accuracy.

7479909,4,B016S5ZFAK,"Following the success of the contemporary productions House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black, Netflix delved into history to create their third original series:  a circa 1271 period drama based on the exploits of Marco Polo, whose fame, prior to the watery version of Blind Mans Bluff many children play, came from his book The Travels of Marco Polo. More than 150 versions of that travel memoir exist, which pretty much gave the writers carte blanch to freely imagine Polos experiences in China at a time when the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan had established a foothold and wanted to extend his rule even more.

Marco Polo is an entertaining enough TV series, yet not one thats so compelling that you cant wait to put on another episode. If your only knowledge of Kublai Khan comes from the romanticized Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem, you're in for a surprise. This series is grittier, perhaps because we see Khan before he established the Yuan dynasty and presided as Emperor of China and Mongolia. There are beheadings and skewerings, one-on-one fights and grand battles, and, since royal concubine was about the best a woman in 13th-century China could aspire to, theres nudity as well as backstabbing court intrigue.

History doesnt seem to substantiate that Marcos father (Pierfrancesco Favino) and uncle stranded him in the Khans court after they failed to give Kublai, the grandson of Genghis Khan, what he had requested. But it does make for interesting drama. Historians speculate that since young Marco (21 at the time he first came to the great Khans court) knew four languages that he quickly became a government official.

Its more dramatic, though, to toss Marco into prison and then make him a kind of on-his-own-recognizance participant-observer of Mongolian-Chinese culture. We see him learn martial arts (of course), and become acculturated into other Asian ways. But his training is only a part of what drives these ten episodes. Marco Polo is a series about ambition, as much as anything:  Marcos father and uncle wanting to expand their trade routes at all costs, Khan seeking to defeat the last formidable Chinese resistance before he can lay claim to all of Yuan, brother and sister scheming to increase their standing, and Marco seeking to navigate the often-treacherous forces that surround him . . . while also taking interest in a Chinese princess (Zhu Zhu).

Lorenzo Richelmy doesnt disappoint as Marco Polo, though shaven he looks less 13th century than when he has a beard. And theres something engagingly Jabba the Hutt about Benedict Wongs portrayal of Kublai Khan. Among the other principal characters are Khans Number 1 wife and empress, the Khans chancellor, heir-to-the-throne Prince Jingim, a bastard son who serves as a general, and a rebellious brother who takes up arms against Khan.

Id give Marco Polo a B-. Though some scenes drag and the intrigue sometimes gets a bit too tangled, the basic conflicts and sub-conflicts hold your attention, the performances are convincing, and the production values are impressivewhich is no doubt why the series was renewed for a second season.",1451520000,16,3122,5.038759689922481
