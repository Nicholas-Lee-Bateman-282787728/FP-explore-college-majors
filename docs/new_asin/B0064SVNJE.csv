When a nun gets out of line, she is sent off and forced to work as a prostitute. One nun manages to escape and vows to take revenge becoming a one woman wreaking crew. Plenty of nudity, full frontal, sex, rape, violence. 4 stars for fans of Grindhouse style movies, all others should avoid this film.",1305331200,3,463,4.590361445783133

4953215,2,B0064SVNJE,"Nude Nuns with Big Guns (Joseph Guzman, 2010)

Now don't get me wrong. It's not like I didn't know what I was getting into when I started watching a movie called Nude Nuns with Big Guns. It would be kind of hard not to; the title is about as descriptive as they come. And if you go into it expecting nothing but nude nuns with big guns, you're in for a good time. That said, when I see a title like that, I see the weight of history behind it. Nunsploitation is a time-honored genre in a number of cultures ranging from Japan to Mexico (Italy, of course, is the godafather, if you'll pardon the pun, of the genreVisconti's 1969 The Nun of Monza seems to have been the first true nunsploitation movie as we know the genre today), and I would have felt a lot better about it had I gotten the idea that co-writers Guzman and Robert James Hayes felt any sort of affection for, let alone connection with, such nunsploitation treasures as Alucarda. Instead, this feels like they found out the genre was A Thing by reading an article about it and said hey, we can make a movie about this! without bothering to find out, say, what's clich&eacute;, what works and what doesn't, whether nuns serve in monasteries (they don't), you know, the small things. As a result, the picture is mildly amusing for a bit, but gets old quick. **",1409788800,2,1321,4.391836734693878

4953219,4,B0064SVNJE,"I have to say, of the many sub-genres in the realm of exploitation film, ""Nunspoitation"" is probably one of the ones I'm least familiar with. That said, however, I can always tell when a film is out to simply just have a good time. This one certainly qualifies for that!

The story is about the revenge of Sister Sarah who, after becoming a nun, is forced into a life of degradation and depravity. Used as a drug mule and later as sex slave, she is left for dead by her tormentors. But this is one nun that will see penance done, as she exacts her violent and bloody revenge!

Right off, the film is not for those who are deeply religious (especially Catholic). It's view of the church as a source of evil and corruption, will certainly offend any devotedly religious people, which I'm sure is part of the point. That aside, all the main tenants of great exploitation films are on display: sex, revenge, violence, drugs, and depravity. It hits all the notes any classic Grindhouse film of yore would do and then some.

Director/Producer Joseph Guzman knows what people expect in an exploitation film and makes sure to deliver it in great quantity. There isn't a single character that is not completely irredeemable here. Sister Sarah (played quite effectively by Asun Ortega) is a stone cold and heartless killer. She wastes no time in dispatching her prey in the most violent manner she can. The sequence in the whore house, when she ruthlessly guns down the people in each room with a tommy-gun, pretty much sums up her character. There is one scene near the end, which I won't give away here, that will make every guy watching wince. You'll know it when you see it! The film also has quite a bit of nudity and lesbian action, so flesh fiends are well-represented here, as well. I mean, these nuns spend more time out of their habits than in them (a sure sign of quality exploitation filmmaking)! The dialogue is corny as hell, no pun intended! One scene even has our main villain (played by David Castro) state to his men that they are ""the bad guys."" Much of it is mockable fun, but some of it is very cringe-worthy in the delivery. If I had any real problem with the story at all, it's that we don't get a good enough back-story. Most of what you need to know is played during the credits, so you definitely have to be watching right from the start, and it's very brief. Perhaps a bit too brief. A little more build-up and understanding of why Sister Sarah becomes so bent on revenge, would seem to be a very needed component. The speed they gloss over that at does the film no favors.

""Nude Nuns with Big Guns"" amply lives up to its title. It very straight-forwardly gives you the blasphemous sleaze-ride you would expect of a film with such a name. It does a fair job of emulating classic 70's style Grindhouse films, without being too polished or overly self-aware about it. It's just good old dirty fun! And it certainly has me wanting to make a ""habit"" of watching more ""Nunspolitation"" films in the future, too. Hallelujah!",1395100800,,3035,4.532846715328467

An iteresting aspect of this attack is the Mexican Government actually encouraged to production of pornigraphic movies so long as they attacked the Catholic Church by featuring lustful priests and nuns.

4953226,5,B0064SVNJE,"Not for the Holy-at-Heart, Nude Nuns With Big Guns will quickly rise to the pinnacle of the nunsploitation genre. Nude Nuns is the melding of the violence of a classic Sam Peckenpaw movie and the nudity of a good B-movie. Nude Nuns With Big Guns is a movie about a strong woman who fights back against men and corrects past wrongs. The movie is a continuous flow of action and never drags. It is also a movie about a very close friendship. It is truly a shame that the release of Nude Nuns With Big Guns was delayed for a few years in the USA due to intellectual property lawsuits, but now that Nude Nuns is available, I heartily recommend it. There is a definite story line and definite moral points in this movie; it is not just a poorly executed excuse for the sake showing violence and nudity. The closing credits were in the tradition of the 1950's movies:  stills from the movie were shown with the names of the actors. The only ""mules"" in this movie about Sister Sarah (my apologies to Clint Eastwood) were the human kind carrying drugs.

Of course I went into this movie thinking it'd be a campy nod to 70's grindhouse exploitation films, but it's not.  I guess the ones who rated positively enjoy watching ALL (and I mean ALL) the women in the movie being violently raped.  This movie is really nothing but rape and lesbian porn with some gratuitous gun violence thrown in for good measure.  I like a good old-fashioned horrible-acting blood-and-guts ""B"" movie as much as the next fan, but this movie is not one of those.  If you're a violent misogynist who enjoys the subjugation and rape of women then you will enjoy this film.

It reminds me a lot Machete, except for a lot more nudity. And when I say nudity, its pretty much every scene. Don't get me wrong, this sorta stuff doesn't offend me in any way, but even I was getting a bit tired of seeing it in every scene just because I felt it was forced at times. Speaking of offended, it's safe to say to if you're not one for sex, violence, and in this case, if you're overly religious, then definitely stay away from this one. Though I can't imagine you'd be looking up this film and reading this review if you aren't into these types of films. All in all, this is a fun little movie to watch. Not spectacular, but decent. The way the film is shot, the violence, the acting, and even the plot for a film like it is, isn't bad.

4953247,2,B0064SVNJE,"When I picked this out of the rental bin, I thought 'Hey, this ought to be fun.'  With that ridiculous title, I figured that the movie would be an over-the-top exploitation/comedy, which is an acquired taste, sure, but it takes all kinds, right?

Asun Ortega stars as Sister Sarah, the nun on the cover, who, after taking her vows finds that the Lord's work isn't exactly how she pictured it would be.  Forced by the church elders to pack cocaine (and do so in the nude, of course), she then acts as a mule to transport the drugs to the local distributors, a motorcycle gang known as Los Muertos.  The deal goes bad, and Sister Sarah is sold into prostitution and hooked on heroin.  During one of her trips, she evidently (it's never shown) hears a message from God, one inspiring her to seek vengeance for herself and for her sisters.

Like I said, I expected a comedy, even if it was going to be a sleazy one, but everyone plays it straight here.  You get a lot of nudity, rapes, murders, lesbianism; as much as possible for the director (Joseph Guzman) to throw on the screen it seems, so if that's your thing, then you are going to love this movie.  That probably won't come as a surprise if you've already watched his first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Run-Bitch-Run/dp/B003YP79VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Run Bitch Run</a>.  He also gives extra attention to disrespecting the church's conventions (again, not surprising given his previous movie), even over and above the little synopsis I gave, so if you think that would make you uncomfortable, then you should avoid this film at all costs.  With the title, you might think that was obvious, but the amount of anger leveled at the clergy's corruption is beyond even what's suggested there.

Here's the deal: If you're into exploitation movies, you're probably going to watch this.  I am, and did, and I wouldn't discourage anyone else from it, if they are also into this sort of thing.  But it all feels pretty flat to me.  For some reason I never could really get on Asun Ortega's side, which is a must if you're going to root for her when she starts wreaking holy vengeance.  And in the final act, as the members of Los Muertos meet their judgment day, it was just bang-bang-bang, and then it was pretty much over, except their leader's shrinkage moment.  I was at least expecting some inventive death scenes, but it's all pretty conventional

Most of the women in this film are rarely dressed, so there's that, except they aren't really all that attractive.  Actually, they look like they fit the part, either as skanky strippers from biker bars or as plain jane nuns.  David Castro, as the leader of Los Muertos, has a fairly commanding presence in the movie, kind of like a more grizzled Antonio Banderas.  At least he (Castro) looks like he was having fun in the process of filming.  And I have to admit that Ortega looks pretty sweet in her avenging angel garb.

Obviously the movie sets up for a part II, so we'll see what new nunnery depths Guzman has in store for us.  Or not, depending on how sleazy you find this first installment.  And it is, without a doubt, one of the more sleazy movies I've ever seen, barring some rough blue movies from the seventies.  That's probably what this film comes closest to, with a dose of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Spit-On-Your-Grave-1978/dp/B004MPJZ1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Spit On Your Grave (1978)</a>.  The difference is that the director of the original I Spit On Your Grave, Meir Zarchi, had some sympathy for his main character.  Guzman, not so much.",1339545600,20,3672,4.938110749185668
4953248,5,B0064SVNJE,"There are some really wonderful reviews here. I don't know if mine will measure up, but here goes...

I tripped across this diamond in the rough on cable channel 69666. Since I am bizarre by everyone's standards except my own I will take a moment to explain that when I am not out pretending to be like everyone else, I subsist on a diet of junk food and sexploitation movies...Oh wait, that IS when I'm pretending to be like everyone else...Never mind.

NUDE NUNS WITH BIG GUNS---the title says it all.  If you're a devout Catholic you may want to move to Vatican City in order to avoid this film, or otherwise accept the fact that you're going to hell just for being on this webpage.

A Mexican drug gang (Los Muertos = The Dead), led by a nun-raping murderous slugcharmer named Chavo, is being funded and supplied with cocaine by a corrupt Monsignor and his Churchly underlings who are using well-morphinated nude nuns to cut the stuff and mule it around in their habits (when they are wearing any between bouts of gratuitous lesbianism). The nunnery is being run by a fleshily repulsive penguin named Mother Magda, who also keeps the local brothel and strip club staffed with her little sisters of mercy.

After being shot full of smack and encountering the Angel of The Lord in her delirium, Sister Sarah finally has enough. Sarah listens to the Lord's command. She becomes a one-nun vigilante. Armed with pistols, shotguns, and a Thompson Submachine Gun she takes vengeance on all evildoers within her firing radius. It's Ash Wednesday Gone Wild as Sarah leaves powder burns on forehead after forehead. Saying that NUDE NUNS WITH BIG GUNS is violent is like saying that Heinz makes 57 Varieties.

Given its low budget, NUDE NUNS WITH BIG GUNS isn't as grotesquely graphic as most of the films in its grubby genre. The woman-on-woman sex, while titillating (pun?) isn't overly explicit. And the violence itself isn't as horrifying as it is absurd. The Director introduces each character with a gang graphic (for the Bad Guys) or a Cross (for those doing the Lord's Work), and provides subtitles for all the colorful Spanish obscenities that adorn this film like rosary beads. In other words, its a perfect One-and-a-Half-Star Five Star Grindhouse Epic.",1338768000,19,2257,4.819121447028424
4953249,4,B0064SVNJE,"[Nude Nuns With Big Guns - (2010) - Widescreen 1.85:1 - directed by Joseph Guzman] For starters, this flick is far (Mother) Superior to Guzman's last film, ""Run, Bitch, Run"", which I found to be the most misogynistic flick I've ever seen, and I'm not easily offended and have screened hundreds of exploitation flicks, having been one of the only reviewers here who's old enough to have grown up in New York during the Grindhouse era, and haunted these transgressive toilets masquerading as moviehouses with unholy ferocity. (That and two bucks will get me on a subway today, I know, I'm just stating my familiarity and qualifications to comment on the new era of retro-psychotronic cinema). ""Run, Bitch, Run"" was a heinous homage to these flicks without the benefit of having any merit or redeemable qualities whatsoever - it was like Guzman was deliberately trying to offend everyone, and he tried too hard doing so, the resulting mess appealing only to men who psychologically really hate women to the extreme. (And I'm aware that all exploitation is misogynistic to one degree or other, but this turned me off entirely, and that's not easily done). But enough of that, let's discuss this film for a few seconds.

Finally, someone made a nunsploitation flick that wasn't a rip-off of Ken Russell's ""The Devils"" (which itself was a rip-off of Aldous Huxley's excellent book, ""The Devils of Loudan""), where we have an isolated group of Penitant Penguins who commit sacriligious crimes and are then declared 'consorting with Satan' by the church clergy, resulting in redemption in the form of inquisition, torture and execution, and not always in that order. So, kudos to Guzman for refreshingly thematic originality (not that one need be a genius to conjure outside this incredibly small box, but no one ever has till now). The concept of a corrupt clergy using nuns as drug mules and addicts is delightfully devious and hand-wringingly wicked. As a former altar boy, I conceptually loved it - damn the pious.

The lone-wolf junkie nun on a 'Kill the Wicked' mission from God when not engaging in Sapphic sessions with other sinful sisters is playfully psychotic and well-executed (pun intended), and the ramped-up sleaze quotient of the titty-bars, bikers, once-holy whores and forced sex festivities will offend all those who haven't had a steady diet of this demented decadence, as it rightfully should, but the rest of us have already headed to hog-heaven. As the vigilante nun states before she blows the top of someone's skull off, ""There's no penance for the Hellbound"", and I assume she's referring to the rest of us.

The way Guzman utilizes the biker's colors, fonts and graphics to ID the infamous characters and similarly subtitles the Spanish cusswords is both helpful and visually interesting, making sure we don't lose the significance of the few subtleties there are, as most of the film is as delicate as a wrecking ball. The violence prolific, the nudity abundant, the atrocities abound, the characters truly despicable - yes, kids, there's much to love here. Now, if some of these women were more attractive we'd have a grindhouse grotto to worship at, instead of a good slice of sleaze that's still a second-tier curio. Not that there aren't a few lookers present, but with the amount of women who will get naked for chump-change or a Happy Meal in today's world, I don't understand why there aren't more desirable babes before the camera; it's not like the acting demands are great...

Sure, most will condemn it for being too similar to Rodriguez or Tarantino, but let's remember that everything they do is a stolen joy-ride in someone else's film catalog cranked up to 11, and Guzman's working on a micro-budget, so cut him a bit of slack. Nothing's original anymore, and everyone's been riding this retro-grindhouse bus off a cliff for years. The keywords here are 'lowered expectations' - don't come to the table expecting to be blown away and you'll enjoy this for what it is - pure, adulterated trash that kills 90 minutes like the many victims in this movie.

4953253,1,B0064SVNJE,"A few years back directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez wanted to pay tribute to those movies that played the drive in or grindhouse circuit with their double feature extravaganza GRINDHOUSE. The pair of films was amazing to watch and made viewers realize how much they enjoyed the old grindhouse low budget films seen in their youth. Unfortunately that movie also had some fallout. Suddenly there was a rush of films being made by other less talented directors that tried to pay tribute as well, failing miserably. NUDE NUNS WITH BIG GUNS is a perfect example.

In the world of NNWBG, the Catholic Church is involved with the cartels in the transportation, packaging and sale of illegal narcotics. When part of a shipment turns up missing, biker leader/distributor Chavo kills all involved with the delivery...almost. One of the nuns survives and takes it as a sign. She is now to take down the cartel single handed. Suddenly we have a change from Lamb of God to executioner for God, able to shoot better than most marksmen with little or no practice.

Instead of saving souls this nun tracks down the various members of the gang and cartel in an attempt to slaughter them all. During one trip when she enters a packaging house where all the nuns stand around naked (with the exception of the white coif or headpiece that nuns wear) packing cocaine for the priests who run the drugs. Everyone is killed in the ensuing melee with the exception of one nun, a friend of our hero. They are such close friends that they end up in bed together. Yes we've entered the exploitation world where religious vows are tossed aside and killing and sex between nuns is accepted.

The killings and attacks go on and on with the nun taking down various members of the priesthood and then the gang that tried to kill her. Each of them is a step towards finding the main group in charge. Unfortunately she never accomplishes her goal and by the end of the film you find out that this is just the first part of the story, a sequel to follow. For once I continue to hope that a sequel never appears.

The most basic problem with this film is the attack on anything anyone would hold sacred. If you believe in God or the church then avoid this movie at all costs. You will most definitely be offended in all possible ways. For some reason the independent film industry thinks its hip and cool to defile all things religious (with the exception of the Muslim religion which would put out a death decree on you if you did so). Choose whatever you want to believe freely, but why this need to desecrate Christianity or any religion? It's a cheap shot used for shock effect and stupid.

 The second problem is the blatant attempt to ride on the coat tails of the Tarantino/Rodriguez film, so much so that I would swear the theme song is the same one used in that original film. If not, Rodriguez should sue because of the striking similarity. The film pulls out all the tricks from grainy stock film to the style of shots, cuts, pullbacks and more. But it completely misses the mark and rather than seem like a true grindhouse film it feels more like a tribute to the tribute instead.

Director Joseph Guzman seems to have a problem with religion. I say that because the only other feature he's directed is named RUN BITCH RUN and is described on imdb as ""Things go horribly wrong when Catherine and Rebecca, two Catholic School girls, knock on the wrong door while selling Religious paraphernalia."" My suggestion would be that Guzman either attempt therapy to handle his problems or just ignore the church in general rather than make anyone who watches one of his films deal with his problem.",1332806400,6,3678,4.614678899082569

4953257,4,B0064SVNJE,"So...I'll give you all a proper review.

This is a little indie film that can.  It is in the vain of the 1970's exploitation films that have recently made a resurgence under the category ""Grind-House"".  For those of you who don't know...they are called 'Grind-House' because back in the day...the only place the producers of these films could get them shown where in porn theaters and strip clubs (or grind houses).
There have been a lot of these films coming out lately...and I'm pretty pleased with that fact.  I love the Blaxsploitation, Pinky Violence, and Roger Corman stuff, among others, so much that having modern fresh takes and ideas is just plain fun for me. (believe it or not...there is even a category called Nunsploitation...and this can easily fit into that category) Now surely...just as in the past, a lot of these films are turkeys and barely worth viewing once...at least barely worth viewing while not intoxicated.  Lucky for me...and you...as you seem you may have an interest in this film, ""Nude Nuns with Big Guns"" is not one of those.  This is the little indie that could.  It is loaded with everything that makes a grind house film fun...hot babes, crazy action, and a bit of over the top exploitative film making.  ""Nuns"" sets itself apart with it's clever direction, great looking cinematography, and pretty solid acting, the colors pop on the blu ray.  This film is just a hoot.  It is not for faint of heart...or the too conservative...but if you like you're guns blazing, and your corruption raunchy..this is the film for you.  I walked into this film thinking it would be a one off..and a wasted night...I've seen it several times sense...it is just outrageous.  If you want a quick splash of crazy in your life..in the vein of ""Nun of That"", ""Machete"", ""Mrs. 45""...and other timeless pieces of celluloid wackiness then ""Nude Nuns with big guns is not to be missed.  Get it for the bottom shelf of your collection..you will not be sorry.",1329350400,55,1969,4.772861356932153

This movie is about a world where priest rape nuns and sell drugs.  Nothing touching - This isn't a religious movie - but rather an anti-religious film.  The story is simple - a nun is raped by a priest and then God talks to her and says - kill everyone. So she does - that's it.  Nothing else to the film.  All the nuns get raped, the priest and bikers kill people over the power and wealth of drugs.  What does that have to do with touching film????  If you are religious - this isn't a film for you.  If you hate religion - especially the Catholic religion - you might find this film funny in a dark way - which is what I think the intent of the film was meant to be.
