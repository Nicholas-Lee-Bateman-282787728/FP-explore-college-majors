8596930,4,B000BWD45K,"A good half of a great concert but not the

better half! Interesting to note that the Import
CDs of this fine concert have two extra songs,
but the videos do not! Wwhopps! I would suggest
to all Cheap Trick fans that they be careful re:
all the bootleg CT concerts out here, even on
amazon.com. As the Latin-speakers say, 'Caveat
Emptor!'

I personally have had very good results in buting
from amazon.com and hope nobody here gets ripped off!

Most of us Cheap Trick fans of one sort or another are
of honest enough character to be helpful when buying,
selling, trading with one another. Same can be said with
Jimmy Buffett, Dread Zeppelin, Webb Wilder and Jason &
the Scorchers fans. Happy collecting!",1164153600,7,703,4.608
