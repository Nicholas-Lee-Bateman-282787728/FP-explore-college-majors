It prompted me to read Paul Scott's ""The Raj Quartet"" upon which it was based (in paperback, almost 2000 pages), to see how faithful the filmed version was to the original.  Other than the omission of some detail into the background of one of the characters, Miss Crane, the TV version was identical. I don't recommend the sequel, which was disappointing, but ""Jewel"" is one of the best productions ever made.",1421452800,54,538,4.652631578947369
6669476,5,B00NMJQKEG,"4 1/2 STARS --- LONG AWAITED U.S. RELEASE OF THE U.K. ANNIVERSARY REMASTERED EDITION FROM 2005 (WITH IMPROVED PICTURE AND ENGLISH SDH SUBTITLES)

NOTE:  THIS SERIES IS NOT FOR EVERYONE DESPITE ITS EXCELLENCE (see my notes further down)

INTRO: This landmark Granada TV production was spurred by the early 1980's resurgence of interest in Britain for the Raj(rule) in India and former days of Empire.  It is based on the four volume Raj Quarted by Paul Scott.  Rather than focusing on the romantic notions of glory past, this show delves into the turmoil of the independence movement and the ultimate division of the country (India/Pakistan).  It takes a somewhat more critical eye of the Raj.  We see mainly through the lens of individual lives of the protagonists, both metaphorically and literally, as they tread water in the rising tide of violent change.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Unlike the books, the TV series pretty much follows chronological order.  It begins in 1942 with Daphne Manners, who has lost her family in Britain.  She arrives in India to be with her relative Lady Manners, but actually lives with Lady Chatterjee (a Rajput Princess).  Daphne befriends another displaced person Hari Kumar, who is ethnically Indian, but raised in Britain and educated at prestigious Chillingborough (called a public school, but in American terms it's actually a private school, and one of the very best).  Hari considers himself English and feels lost in his new life in India.  A crime shatters their life and Hari is falsely accused along with some of his friends, despite testimony from Daphne proclaiming his innocence.  The charges are brought by the local Police Superintendent Ronald Merrick, who knows Hari is innocent, yet harbors ill will as a rival for Daphne's affections.  The middleclass Merrick is also resentful of Hari's privileged education and has a sadistic inner nature.  This false accusation becomes one element adding fuel to the independence movement and a rallying cry for radicals.  However, this issue also moves somewhat to the back of the viewers consciousness as the series focuses on new characters  and events that still have some relationship to the originals.  Merrick is the closest thing to a central character as he interacts with the Layton family.  The story focuses more on Sarah Layton the rest of the way.  Again, rivalries come into play among many suitors and the march continues to the ever unraveling of Merrick's treachery and the ultimate departure of the Raj.  All this is done against the backdrop of Ghandi's Quit India movement (anti Raj), the Japanese threat during WWII, and the Muslim-Hindu violence tearing India into separate nations.

SYMBOLISMS AND THEMES:  This TV series is highly symbolic and metaphorical.  We don't see the macro events of the country in progress so much as the effect it has on the numerous protagonists.  Individual lives are used as a microcosm to illustrate what is happening in the country as a whole.  The older upper class generation are staunched in their ways, and in many respects their bigotry.  The younger generation are adapting and breaking the code, but become isolated as they cross boundaries.  Some older middleclass seem to question their faith and if they have done right.  There is plenty of self loathing and identity crisis, much as the country itself seeks to understand it's new identity.  There are visual metaphors also, like the elderly missionary school teacher Miss Batchelor watches vultures circling the ""Parsi Towers"" where dead are temporarily taken to be devoured by the vultures before burial (Zoroastrian thing).  Or the empty Governor's summer home, perched high in the hills and hinting of former glory.

WHY SOME MAY NOT ENJOY THIS SHOW:  Though this is a widely acclaimed series with a strong fan base, I want to be fair to some audiences as they read the expected overwhelmingly positive reviews.  The show is outstanding for it's meticulous construction, complicated sub plots and masterful character development.  However, many of those central characters are not that sympathetic (while others you will fall in love with).  The meticulous construction means that the story will plod very slowly to some viewers, particularly younger crowds not used to this kind of story.  Even some strong fans of the show will admit it slows heavily in the middle to late episodes before the rousing end.

AUDIENCE APPROPRIATENESS AND CONTENT:  I make no judgments and leave it to each family to decide.  The length and detail of the show make it more of an adult program and difficult for young attention spans anyway.  There is some brief male nudity (mainly from behind) during interrogation scenes.  The violence is mainly in the periphery of the audiences' view as we see the aftermath of various events (including blood and death).  Scenes of intimacy don't really show anything.  Questions of sexuality are part of the story at some junctures.  Breaking taboos, departing from social mores, or crossing lines is part of the story, but treaded very lightly by today's standards.  Not really shocking.

ACCOLADES: The story is so diverse that there are many leading actors.  In fact, this program took up all of the Bafta nominations for leading actress with Peggy Ashcroft taking honors.  Tim Pigott-Smith won leading actor as well.  In 2000, the British Film Institute named Jewel in the Crown number 22 of the 100 greatest British TV programs of all time.

ANNIVERSARY REMASTER DVD:  This re-mastered version has been available for quite a long time in the UK (2005).  I have no idea why it took so long for the U.S. release, but it's usually a licensing thing.  The picture quality and colors are much improved and includes the addition of English SDH subtitles that have long been a complaint of the previous US release.  This is still a DVD release of a fairly old program.  The improvements are notable, but obviously not Blu Ray reference quality.  It is worth the upgrade if you don't already have the UK release.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  I mentioned the excellent performances.  It represents a move away from the more melodramatic style of stage acting in the 70's to a more natural style seen now.  This helps the program age quite well.  Whether you can tolerate the meticulous pace or not, it's hard to deny the masterful production of a great work.  The historical context and ability to express the personality of the Raj demise through personalities of the characters was quite exceptional.  I don't think I could watch it over and over, though I am sure others can.  I still give it my highest recommendation within the context of what I described.",1420070400,292,6679,5.0063578564940965

6669520,5,B00NMJQKEG,"Watched this when it was first presented as a TV series many years ago. So fascinating I could not wait for the next episode of The Jewel in the Crown. Such a long time ago and at that time I recorded it on the old VHS type tapes. Of course they disintegrated by the time I wanted to see the entire series again many years later. I was delighted when I found this series on DVD on Amazon. I read all the ""cons"" concerning the picture quality, sound quality, etc. but remembering just how fascinating this story set in the last days of the Jewel's (India) rule by the British, I felt it was worth the risk even if non-returnable. So happy I made this purchase. I too wish, like many who have reviewed this, that they would have used modern technology to remake this in ""Blu-Ray"" quality, but the sound clarity and volume are fine, and the picture quality just reminded me that I watch TV for years without 4K transmission. So into the story (which would probably NEVER be remade today given the politically correct atmosphere we live in), but for an intriguing story with depth, and the extra bonus of a background historical story of a major event, the end of the British rule in India and the ""dividing"" of  the ""jewel"", it was an excellent purchase. As the old saying goes "" they don't make 'um like this anymore"".",1469232000,,1316,4.415637860082304

6669523,5,B00NMJQKEG,Huge fan of this beloved series. Was wondering if anyone could explain the difference in the minute count between this set at 740 minutes and the old A & E set at 778?  Hope that with the PBS logo on this set which reviewers state is the remastered version from the UK of 2005 has not fallen victim to PBS's contemptible editing and cutting up (for some stupid unknown and regardless unjustified reasons (it's why I don't donate to PBS any longer)) and that they have done for years and continue to do.,1466208000,,502,4.397849462365591

6669539,5,B00NMJQKEG,"In 2016, PBS began another wonderful saga about the end of the British Raj:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indian-Summers/dp/B00YXRPS0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indian Summers</a>. I highly recommend that new series, which captures this turbulent era of high aspirations, heartbreaking bigotry and the grandeur of India itself. That made my wife and I want to go back and watch the Grandpa of such series: The Jewel in the Crown.

First, I want to point out that this 25th anniversary set of disks is much higher quality than another set of DVDs we watched some time ago. The clarity and colors of this edition make it well worth purchasing if you're going to wade into these many hours of drama.

We had forgotten what a tragic series this is. Of course, it's based on the underlying novels, but consider that you'll be signing up for lots of characters going through agonizing consequences of this era of World War II in India and the end of the Raj. My wife and I love cross-cultural movies and we're perhaps jaded by the more contemporary films about East-meets-West involving India. Like so many other fans, we love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hundred-Foot-Journey/dp/B00MI56UI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hundred-Foot Journey</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-Exotic-Marigold-Hotel/dp/B005S9EJ14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</a>

Forster-inspired&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Passage-To-India-2-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0013D8LN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Passage To India (2-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;Basically, in this earlier era, class distinctions really were razor sharp and Western, especially British, attitudes were what today seem toxic even if the colonial ruling class couldn't understand that in this earlier era.

Most viewers, I think, want to enjoy a drama like this for the broad-brush sweep of foreign lands, epic moments in world history and people we really care about as the fictional characters moving through this saga. Jewel really does wreak havoc on many of the characters we care about, treating them probably as brutally as they really would have been treated in that era. The point I'm making is: If you invest in these disks, you will find one of public television's grandest series presented in a great new DVD set. But your heart will be broken again and again.

I highly recommend the series with those cautionary notes.",1460073600,7,2674,6.335164835164835

6669577,4,B00NMJQKEG,Far far better than the books that really were a tad boring . Beautifully acted ..oh how some of these actresses must hate the parts they are given!! and the scenery is fantastic .  Very thin main story but the overall story is on a grand scale ..the gripof Britain being released on the sub continent and the dreadful years after the British left .,1442016000,,349,4.369230769230769
6669578,3,B00NMJQKEG,"This is a very interesting . . . and depressing story.  It is a good tool to learn about England's history with India though it's painful to watch the relation that most of the British characters have with their enslaved Indian servants and underlings.  Honestly, the movie is very well crafted and the characters mostly well developed, but one crisis after another leads to the next.  I've been watching a library copy for hours and am about to quit because yet another person in the story is suffering immeasurably.  Maybe I just need a break, but I'm going to stop for now.

6669588,5,B00NMJQKEG,"Regarding the content itself I will not add to the several cogent five-star reviews already posted except to say that this was one of the finest adaptations of a novel (four novels, actually) in the history of long-form television. I purchased an earlier version of the DVD some years ago, and while it was certainly superior to my original VHS edition, the picture quality was underwhelmingalthough I've seen transfers that were far worse. I've just done an A/B comparison of the old DVD with this ""Remastered Anniversary Edition,"" and the improvement is striking. I will attempt to append a photo showing the difference (L: old; R: new). If the photo takes, you can judge for yourselves.

The series is spell binding, and it is such a pleasure to be able to watch it without the interruption of commercials.  Every character is portrayed so well that it the viewer becomes part of the story.  I find myself watching it over and over, it fascinates and intrigues simultaneously.

I've heard such great things about it I was happy to find it here on Amazon.  This is one you'll rewatch many times to catch all the nuances of the characters.

It was apparently intended to provide some type of story woven within a documentary of footage from the WWII era and issues surrounding India andf its relationship to England.  It is without a doubt a most boring, disgusting and in so many ways unconnected story with strange old characters that are not tied to a continuing plot except in the most obtuse manner!  We actually trashed this after 4 episodes.  A good idea in a great historical era but so poorly written and produced!  What a waste!!!  :/",1431475200,3,567,4.509803921568627

I really liked the character development, the view of the history, the customs, the politics and prejudices of the time under Britain's rule, and the glimpse of what life was like in an exotic location like India. The story line went steadily downhill after the first 5 or so episodes though and the ending was quite disappointing. It left too many things up to the viewers imagination as to how things may have turned out for the characters. I was especially disappointed that I never knew what happened to Hari Kumar and Daphne Manners' daughter Pavarti. I was also disappointed that I never knew the outcome of the relationship between Sarah Layton and Guy Perron. The series started out so promising but it seemed as though the producers had run out of time, money, and the energy to keep up the quality of the story telling that was present in the beginning of the series.",1431129600,4,924,4.606060606060606

It is very rich in content, thought-provoking, and haunting.  The characters are all very interesting and well portrayed.  It is an era in history that I believe will always be relevant.  Certainly it is today with all the turmoil that is occurring in the Middle East.  I now look forward to reading The Raj Quartet.  By all means, when you watch it be sure to include the introductions to each episode by Alistair Cooke.  He provides relevant background to the action as well as information about Paul Scott's familiarity with his subject matter.  Yes, it is a story set at the end of British rule in India; however, it illuminates the incredible problems inherent when one group of people is dominated by another.  For those who have not yet seen this series, you are in for a great treat that will have you pondering the situations depicted even after you have finished watching the entire 14 episodes.",1427932800,3,1076,4.5811518324607325

6669721,5,B00NMJQKEG,Complicated story which must be seen from the beginning to make any sense.  Very well acted.  It takes a committment to see it through to the end because it takes 14.5 hours of viewing time spread over 5 DVD discs.  Gives a lot of history of the British rule of India during the period 1942 to 1949 when Britain finally gave their control of the country back to the Indians. Interesting human relationships.  Warning:  Once you begin the series you will want to stay with it to see how it ends.  You will not regret the time spent watching it but you will want to spread viewing time out since the story can be intense in places.,1425945600,7,629,4.333333333333333

I felt it took away from the story ,commentary on the episode and the introduction were not presented but listed.
Really a poor purchase against the the advertised cover.",1425168000,6,269,4.702127659574468

6669740,5,B00NMJQKEG,This will be the second time around for me.  I caught one episode that was being rerun on a PBS station and just knew I had to see the whole series again.,1424908800,2,154,3.8125

6669742,5,B00NMJQKEG,THIS WAS A GIFT.  I WATCHED IT AS WELL.  GOOD RESTORATION AND PRETTY WELL IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS FILMS OF THE SAME PERIOD AND BOOKS.  DECENT RENDITION OF THE STORY.,1424390400,3,163,4.366666666666666

6669744,5,B00NMJQKEG,"One of the great television events.  The script and acting are first-rate, and the series gathers power with each episode.  The performances of Art Malik and Charles Dance stand out particularly in my mind.  This story will stay with you for a very long time.",1424304000,11,259,4.711111111111111

6669746,4,B00NMJQKEG,"This series based on historical fact was well acted and beautifully filmed.  It was a bit difficult to watch the cruelty, but if you have a nostalgia for those times, you can tolerate it.",1424217600,10,187,4.5
8679161,5,B00NMJQKEG,"Great remastering of a great saga. The Jewell In The Crown has created an enticingly engaging viewing experience. Every element of this series works in precise harmony to form a completely rich whole; the historical setting of India with its transition of colonial power to independence, the music, sets precisely executed to enrich the story, and most compellingly, the script and superb acting. All combine beautifully to draw the viewer in and engage him to make ""Jewell In The Crown"" worthy of watching and watching again. We watched most of the series on a much older, inferior copy and were disappointed we didn't buy this new vastly superior version sooner. Oh well, there will definitely be a next time for us to engage in this rare masterpiece and look forward to being drawn in again to its fascinating story.",1528329600,,819,4.899280575539568
8679162,2,B00NMJQKEG,"Looked forward to seeing this again, since when it first aired I was only able to catch maybe half of it.  But seeing it whole after all these years I must say that this is a massive disappointment, mainly because the Layton family at the center of the story is the most boresome group of individuals ever put together in fiction!  I had thought that this story provides a pretty good overview of the British experience in India, but the story is mostly confined to the precincts of Pancot (or Simla in reality), and features a bunch of British louts lounging around with nothing to do but be snotty ""whilst"" sipping their G&Ts.  Crushingly boring when not obnoxiously puerile.  With nothing at all interesting to say about India, either positively or negatively.  Suffice it to say there is no romance whatsoever in this story, and very little romance to be had out of India in any case.  And if you don't believe me, just try traveling around the country for a while.  To call it the dustheap of humanity would be too kind.",1523232000,,1025,4.5683060109289615
8679163,5,B00NMJQKEG,I love this series.  Saw it when it first aired.  It was on netflix for a while but now gone.  If you want the DVD get this version not an earlier version.  The video quality on this version is superior.,1521504000,,203,4.0

8679167,5,B00NMJQKEG,The quality of this DVD set is good.  I remember the original from PBS was very dark. I am glad that I have this DVD in my possession so I can watch this excellent Masterpiece anytime I want to.,1518393600,,194,3.9743589743589745
8679168,5,B00NMJQKEG,"A great series. It was a wonderful gift for world travelers who had seen it years before, but were ready to enjoy it again during a quiet spell in their lives. One of the original Masterpiece Theater classics. Never gets old!",1514851200,,225,4.512195121951219
