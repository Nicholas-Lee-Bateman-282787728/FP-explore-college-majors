990405,5,6305222711,"I saw this movie three times: once as a child, the other in High School, and finally while I was on active duty at Wurtsmith AFB, MI., in 1981.  Throw out the romance portion of the film, and one sees the Strategic Air Command (SAC) as it was during the Cold War era.  I had arrived to Wurtsmith as the Wing/Base Level Data Automation Officer after serving three years in SAC Headquarters.  Going through two Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI) in a ten month period -- the 379th BMW and my orginazation did well in both -- I saw what the real Air Force was like.  The IG came unexpectedly and without notice.  This film is pretty much acurate on how a base prepares for a contingency.  When a Wing fails an inspection, the Wing Commander and pretty much all, or most his directors (thus the title ""A Gathering of Eagles"") are fired on the spot.  Colonels with aspirations of making General are now forced to end there careers early.  This is a must see film for military history buffs and those novices who are curious about the United States Air Force.",1064534400,21,1058,4.50261780104712
990406,5,6305222711,"Being retired Air Force, I was assigned to then 22nd Air Force or the 60MAW at Travis AFB, Ca from 1973-1990. I was a Flight Engineer on the C-5A and the C-141A/B and of course, we in MAC also had to deal with the ORI's that were ""thrown"" at us sometimnes without notice.  The way the movie presented the facts are very accurate and it serves as a good example of how the aircrews and ground maintenance personnel dealt with the dailt attempts to launch their respective ""birds.  This movie is one of the best to show the workings of our Air Force and what is involved in assuring that we are always ready to support freedom anytime, anyplace in the world.",1045440000,8,656,4.368852459016393

990408,5,6305222711,"Good movie about the Strategic Air Command.
Centered around a B-52 Bombardment Wing

early 1960's (Cold War era).",1028592000,2,192,5.225806451612903
990409,4,6305222711,"While the story get somewhat adrift with regards to the love-life of the ""Wing King,"" the movie portrays SAC at the time of filming quite accurately.  I was at Beale, but not until 1972, when we had both a mixed-bag of B-52Gs and Hs, plus the 9th Strategic Recon Wing with it's SR-71s.  What is ironic in the extreme, is that the story came true!  In 1972, the 456th BW flunked an ORI for a BUFF launching WITHOUT water injection. Just a few months later, we sere subjected to a repeat, which we passed.  The crew that launched without water injection had just returned from a TDY to Anderson AFB, Guam, with it's missions to Hanoi.  As a result, the crew was immediately sent BACK to Anderson, and on 22 Dec 1972 was the only Beale-based B-52 lost during ""Linebacker II.""  The only survivor, if memory serves, was the tail-gunner.  The fly-by after the memorial service (the Wing King referred to the crew not by name, but only by crew number, which I thought was tacky as hell) almost resulted in the loss of a B-52, as they were at the end of a scheduled 14 hour mission, and forgot about the rising terrain to the northeast, passing over Chapel 2, and got the power on rather late...

990576,3,6305222711,This is good movie for SAC veterans who have experienced an Operational Readiness Inspection. Not enough aerial shots for me. Kind of a remake of WWII movie 12 o'clock high with Gregory Peck. Both Peck and Hudson come off as hard nosed Wing Commanders. A lot of B-52 takeoffs.,1512172800,,276,4.653061224489796

990579,5,6305222711,"Giving this flick five stars simply because I was a SAC ground-pounder during the Cold War who worked directly for a handful of wing commanders and sweated in the command post during several ORIs.  The daily pressure on the CC, DO and LGM back then was enormous, and the movie depicts it in a straightforward manner.  Rock Hudson plays a newly-assigned wing commander who understands that being a heartless prick on occasion is part of the job description.  ORIs were SACs final exams.  A bad ORI report card meant the end of careers for officers in key positions.  Hudson stumbles a few times while trying to prepare his wing for the next ORI.  The drama builds toward the arrival of Happy Jack and his ORI team, and the wings performance.  Trying to save his wing and his faltering marriage, Hudson can only watch, wait and sweat to see if his people can get the job done.  Not a lot of action or humor, just the tension of life in SAC, making for excellent drama.",1507852800,4,966,4.511494252873563
990580,5,6305222711,"The story is of the everyday life of a wing commander and the decisions he must make regardless of wife, friends or extenuating circumstances. Col. Jim Caldwell (Rock Hudson) has a new task of shaping up a strategic air force wing during the 60's that is not up to snuff. On top of this, he is newly married and his wife (Mary Peach) does not know what she is in for. Can he maintain friendships or at least discipline when he as you would expect must turn ruthless in his endeavor?

This movie is more than surface entertainment. As Col. Caldwell learns how to handle his job, we also learn something of the human condition, and soon are part of the story.",1507334400,3,657,4.385245901639344

990733,5,6305222711,"I've been looking for this movie for years and it's as good as I remember.  As a former Air Force pilot (F-16, A-10) I can attest to the accuracy of most of the film with a couple of notable exceptions.  While I've never flown a B-52 or KC-135 I know enough about them and general command and control procedures to agree with other writers that those scenes are pretty accurate.  I've also had the misfortunate to be in a combat wing that failed an ORI, and yes, the Wing Commander was canned.  The 90 days that followed the bust waiting for the re-check were not pleasant for anyone.  The air refueling scenes are realistic as well...radio calls, working throttles/controls, etc.  Fighters, like the F-16 are pretty nimble so it's relatively easy to stay ""in the apple"" (that's the ideal spot on the boom as it moves in and out...going from red stripes, to yellow, to ideally green), so I can image the challenge of refueling a beast like the BUFF and worse in rough air.  The refueling  ""Breakaway""  scene is also accurate as the goal is to get as much space between the two aircraft as possible until you can sort out the problem.  Now for a couple of ""Hollywoodisms"":  The arrival of Hudson in the T-33 would raise a few eyebrows in the real world since he landed on a taxiway vs the runway.  I suspect this was to get the parked B-52/KC-135 tails in the shot .  Likewise, I think the MITO scene would have been a bit quieter if they had watched from their staff car, or better yet the control tower.  Finally, I've never seen a commander dash out of the command post to view first hand a maintenance issue on the ramp...even Hudson said, ""Your place is in the Command Post"".  Again, have to cut Hollywood some slack as a CP is a visually boring place even in a make-or-break ORI.  Still, this is a great movie that tells a good story of what things were like in the Cold War.  I'm glad the DVD is out and in good quality...although I would have liked to seen some bonus material...trailers, maybe a director's cut, etc.  If you like jets and action, this is the move you need to get.",1489622400,7,2088,4.393229166666667

I eventually discovered that it was part of the Turner Classic Movie library so I was constantly checking TCM to see if I could catch an airing but without success.  And like many others, I looked in vain for years to find it on DVD.  Low and behold a few days ago I decided to try and contract TCM to see if I could get an answer on when it might be aired and when I logged on to their web site and searched the movie title, I discovered that they had it for sale in their on-line store.  I was so excited I hit the buy button on the spot.  Sadly I didn't have the foresight to check Amazon first because I'm about 10-days post purchase and still waiting for my copy to arrive via USPS.

The aerial refueling scene where the receiver aircraft fills up with fuel is a stark reminder of an identical incident I experienced as a crew member on a SAC RC-135 during an aerial refueling incident.  I was riding a rotation bird back from Athens Greece to Offutt AFB, Nebraska and we had to hit a tanker from Mildenhall AFB, England just off the English west coast.  At some point during the off load a flange in the refueling manifold sprung a serious leak, spewing jet fuel all over the navigator's console in the cockpit and sending a river of fuel down the aisle of the crew compartment.

Of course we did an emergency break away (what a ride!) and declared an in-flight emergency with request to land immediately back at Mildenhall.  Amazingly, Mildenhall turned us away with some excuse about their ramp being too full and no room to take us and we'd have to find another landing spot.  After some consultation, the aircraft commander decided that we would mop up the fuel as best we could with rags and paper towels, stow all that in a plastic trash bag, don our oxygen masks, and keep pressing on across the Atlantic.  Needless to say it was an excruciating several more hours of flight from that point forward. We had taken on enough fuel to make it safely to Loring AFB, Maine where we touched down, got a more thorough clean up of the residual fuel spill, topped off the tanks, and pressed on home to Offutt.

Anyway, enough war stories.  I have an annual ritual of watching 12 O'clock High.  And as it happens, A Gathering of Eagles was intended by one its writers, Sy Bartlett, to be a sequel, as he was also one of the key writers on 12 O'clock High.  So I'll no doubt watch A Gather of Eagles as soon as it arrives and from then on make my annual ""AF Heritage Day"" a back to back double feature.",1464134400,,2718,4.256809338521401

The movie was very accurate in the mood of Air Force people when an ORI (Operational Readiness Inspection) came to town.  This inspection was a 'make-or-break' situation for leadership and was a great depiction of what happened in real life.  Can't say enough about Rock Hudson's portrayal as the wing commander.  One of the neat little side points for me is that one of the extras in the movie who portrayed an aircraft mechanic was an authentic Air Force CMSgt - I worked for him in a later assignment and he often was referred to as 'the movie star'.

I was to learn to operate the new computerized combat reporting system. This I learned and, due to so many of our NCO controllers being reassigned to Southeast Asia, soon I was tested and became a certified Command Control Specialist. Notice I said command control, not command and control which is nothing but a redundant phrase. Command control is a SAC term meaning the control which emanates from the command level, and it involves terms such as positive control and fail safe among others. This movie is in regards to a newly assigned colonel taking command of an aerospace wing which has recently failed an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI), which simulates Emergency War Operations (EWO). The new wing commander must study the ORI failure report, look at his key personnel for any personal weaknesses, and prepare for the follow-up inspection. In the movie, a master sergeant was the Emergency Actions NCO, my position after I was certified. And as a young three-stripe airman, I was in that seat for my wing's next ORI when the SAC Inspector General said, ""This is a SAC ORI. You will make no notifications until your checklist directs you to do so."" I retired as an E-8 with twenty years active duty service in 1980.

A note that might help some of you regarding the audio.  The default language is German.  My dad couldn't figure out how to get it to play in English, so here's how (I talked to him over the phone, so I'm going off of what he told me was on the screen).  Apparently, the DVD starts up with a very simple menu screen that just allows you to start playing the movie.  It seems that you can't adjust the audio on that screen.  Once the movie begins, press the ""Audio"" (or equivalent) button on your player's remote, and then you should be able to switch from German to English.

The instructions aren't in the manual, but if you search online, you might find that your player can be made that way (it's usually a code that you punch in on the remote control).

My father was a B-52 pilot for the re-fueling scenes and also flew in the interval take-off, landing scene (I have a photo of the camera crew filming this scene. Awesome! They were right next to the runway.) The scene of the afternoon get-together in the backyard was the actual backyard of Gen. Byerly's house. The briefing room was actually the briefing room used at Beale and those are real Beale airmen Rock is talking to. A party was held for the cast and crew on the base. Byerly's wife had herself and my mom on either side of Rock. However, my mom could not attend - she couldn't find a babysitter for me! :)

991542,3,6305222711,"A Gathering of Eagles is an apparent Cold War adaptation of 1949's World War II-theme movie Twelve O'Clock High.  In this feature Strategic Air Command assigns Colonel Jim Caldwell (Rock Hudson) to take over command of a B-52 bomber wing that recently failed an emergency readiness exercise.  Similar to General Savage of Twelve O'Clock High, Colonel Caldwell comes in as the new, hard commander intent on improving the wing's readiness, taking on a tough persona to get his officers and airmen to perform their duties in accordance with SAC's demanding mission of nuclear deterrence.  The job turns out to be tougher than expected as Caldwell's newlywed wife Victoria (Mary Peach) has trouble adjusting to life in SAC, and when his best friend Colonel Hollis Farr (Rod Taylor) begins to reveal liabilities as the vice commander.  Matters become more complicated when Victoria and Hollis appear to be spending too much time together.  While A Gathering of Eagles does not feature an air-combat theme as Twelve O'Clock High, it remains a serious Cold War piece on SAC's responsibility for maintaining nuclear forces ready to deploy at a moments notice.  The marriage sub-plot with Caldwell and his wife, unfortunately, is boring and steals too much screen-time for the drama of Caldwell's command to match its World War II predecessor.  Despite this criticism, Colonel Caldwell's challenges with Hollis and the wing remain interesting and it is a credible portrayal.  The movie features some nice B-52 bomber scenes, and it's a good nostalgic feature of SAC in 1963.",1139961600,11,1565,5.158102766798419
991543,5,6305222711,"One of Rock Hudson's greatest performances. The movie still resonates today. Wonderful photography, a great score and a fine cast compliment a true Cold War classic. The only crime here is that no DVD version exists for this feature. Those who love this film need to solicit MCA/Universal to get a DVD version released!!!!",1133654400,6,322,4.981481481481482
991614,5,6305222711,"This is the way it was done along with the Navy's ballistic missile submarines. Triad!

Though the setting of this film is in the 60's the script could apply to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) up through the 80's. Except for ending airborne B-52 alert flights, nothing really changed with the operation of SAC until the end of the Soviet Union.

I was a defensive fire control tech on the B-52H from '79 thru '82, 28th Avionics Maintenance Squadron, Ellsworth AFB SD.

Watching this movie, for me, is like watching a personal documentary of life at EAFB. Very accurate!",1132444800,4,569,4.7272727272727275
991615,5,6305222711,"I saw this film as a kid, growing up in Cleveland, Ohio, and it was the reason I decided then that I wanted to join the Air Force when I grew up.  I served some time with a Titan II wing at Little Rock AFB, AR, as an enlisted man, and after getting commissioned, attending navigator and electronic warfare officer school, became a crew member on B-52Gs -- the same type as those in the film -- at Barksdale AFB, LA.  The romance between Mary Peach and Rock Hudson is a bit hokey, but the aerial work by Paul Mantz and the minimum interval takeoff launch of B-52s during the ORI is GREAT.  This film is extremely accurate, both for the missileers and the fly guys. It captures very well the look, the spirit, and the procedures of the real SAC. Kinda makes you nostalgic for those old 1505s (khaki uniforms), too!

I watched nine 52's and nine 135's take off within fifteen seconds of each other, just like it is shown in the movie. The noise and power those bad boys deliver is hard to imagine, but this movie does it very good justice. This movie, that has an average rating of 4 1/2 stars needs to be on DVD, with added features about the real SAC, from the archive of the USAF. Being on alert seven days on and seven off, was hard on the men and women who served in the military, along with their familys.

This goes down as one of the all time great Air Force flicks.  It's a little over dramatic but highlights problems in personnel and readiness which were accurately displayed, as well as the importance of to-the-moment readiness our military has maintained - and continues to maintain.

This is one of the golden classics and is a must see for anyone curious about Strategic Air Command then, and how we got to be where we are now.

Now when does it come out on DVD?  I think extras about SAC and 8th Air Force would be wonderful.",1098489600,28,656,4.380165289256198
991618,4,6305222711,"I enjoyed this movie partly for conventional reasons -- interesting characters, exciting situations, enough factual material to be partly educational.
My other enjoyment of this film is its forthright treatment of the perennial issues facing military wives (nowadays, spouses both male and female, of course), at least as I understand it from research (not a military wife or member myself).  Spouse travels in support of member's career, spouse struggles to understand the importance the member puts on unit cohesion equal to or above family relationships, spouse confused by conventions within unit that appear to support heavy drinking/camaraderie on one hand, and its readiness to sack those deemed ""unfit for service"" on the other.  The issues the commander deals with in the movie include how he treats his men, what role he expects his wife to play, how she handles those expectations, the tension this brings to their relationship, and the revelation that comes about for the wife when she views her husband's decisions, not from her own perspective, but from the perspective of the men under his command.
An excellent examination of the push and pull of life ""inside the fortress.""",1082764800,3,1190,5.225130890052356

and once every blue moon we might get treated to have a B-52 land

SAC Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI) and everything had to
be in tip-top shape and on the money. And as our other reviewers
and the movie indicated, the wing commander's job was on the line, so was the group or base commander. and the inspections
came with little or no warning. I enjoy watching A gathering of
Eagles due to the accuracy of the movie in depicting Air Force
life and the SAC mission. It also helps me to relive the exciting
days of my life as an airman with the 341st Strategic Missle Wing. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.",1082160000,10,820,4.366013071895424

JUST LIKE IN ""A GATHERING OF EAGLES"", THAT REGULARILY HAD ""ORI'S"" (OPERATIONAL READINESS INSPECTIONS), WHERE BOMBERS AND EVEN KC-135 JET TANKERS WERE SENT OUT ON AERIAL DRILLS AS PART AS MILITARY READINESS IN THE EVENT OF WAR! I STILL REMEMBER THOSE DAYS BACK IN THE 1960'S!!!! THEN THE B-52S WERE SILVER, NOT CAMAFLAUGE LIKE TODAY! I WENT TO SEVERAL AIR SHOWS THERE AND ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING MOMENTS EVER, WAS IN 1964 WHEN MY DAD AND I OBSERVED A LOW FLYBY OF A B-52 AND KC-135 REFUELING SIMULATION DURING THAT GREAT AUTUMN AIR SHOW!!!! IT ROOK MY BREATH AWAY!!!! IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES!!!! AND I NEVER FORGOT IT!!!! I STILL SEE AND REMEMBER IT AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY!!!! WOW!!!!
IN ""STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND"" (PARAMOUNT PICTURES 1955), WE SAW THE GREAT MASSIVE CONVAIR B-36 PEACEMAKERS, AND WERE INTRODUCED TO THE BOEING B-47 STRATOJETS! THEN IN ""BOMBERS B-52"" (WARNER BROTHERS 1957), WE WENT FROM BOEING B-47 STRATOJETS TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE NEW BOEING B-52 STRATOFORTRESSES. BOTH FILMS FEATURED SPECTACULAR AERIAL SCENERY!!!!
NOW IN ""A GATHERING OF EAGLES"" (UNIVERSAL/INTERNATIONAL PICTURES 1963) WE NOW SEE THE BOEING B-52 STRATOFORTRESSES, AND ARE INTRODUCED TO THE BOEING KC-135 JET TANKERS (BOEING 707 TYPES), AND EVEN MINUTEMEN MISSILES IN THEIR UNDERGROUND SILOS!!!!
IN ACTUALITY, WE'VE SEEN THE STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND FROM THE POST WAR ERA, WITH ""STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND"" (MY ALLTIME FAVORITE!) STARRING JAMES STEWART AND JUNE ALLYSON, TO ""BOMBERS B-52"" STARRING KARL MALDEN AND NATALIE WOOD, AND NOW TO MODERN UP-TO-DATE READINESS VERSION STARRING ROCK HUDSON, MARY PEACH AND ROD TAYLOR. ITS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT BARRY SULLIVAN HAD STARRING ROLES IN BOTH ""STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND"" AS ROCKY STANFORD, AND IN ""A GATHERING OF EAGLES"" AS A DRINKING MILITARY OFFICIAL, WHOSE DRINKING PROBLEM EVENTUALLY LEADS TO HIS SUDDEN AND NEAR TRAGIC DOWNFALL!!!!
ROCK HUDSON IS SUPERB AS THE COMMANDER (CALDWELL) WHO GETS A NEW WING AT A CALIFORNIA SAC BASE NEAR SAN FRANCISCO. CALDWELL HAS THE ALMOST DIFFICULT RESPONSIBILITY OF GETTING HIS ENTIRE UNIT IS TOP SHAPE AND READINESS TO PASS ANY FUTURE ""ORI'S""! (OPERATIONAL READINESS INSPECTIONS) WHERE THE FORMER COMMANDER OF THE BASE FAILED AND WAS FIRED! CALDWELL DETERMINED AND ROUGHLY DISCIPLINES HIS UNIT EVEN TO THE POINT OF ""CHOPPING HEADS"" SO TO SPEAK TO KEEP EVERYONE IN LINE. EVEN AS FAR AS FIRING HIS BEST FRIEND COL. FARR (ROD TAYLOR), ESPECIALLY AFTER RUMORS ARISE THAT HE MIGHT BE HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH CALDWELL'S WIFE (MARY PEACH). SHE IN TURN THREATENS TO LEAVE HIM, UNTIL AN EXPECTED ORI OCCURS. GENERAL KIRBY (PLAYED BRILLIANTLY BY KEVIN MCCARTHY OF ""INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS"") ARRIVES, AS HES DONE MANY TIMES IN THE PAST (HE WAS ALSO INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DISMISSAL OF THE FORMER COMMANDER, OF WHICH CALDWELL HAD TO REPLACE) PUTTING CALDWELL AND THE ENITRE UNIT TO THE TEST!!!! THROUGH GRUELING HOURS OF TAKEOFFS OF B-52S, AND KC-135S, PREPARATION OF MINUTEMEN MISSILES, EMERGENCIES, DELAYS, AND POSSIBLE ABORTS, AS WELL AS EXECUTED MID-AIR REFUELINGS, THE ENTIRE MANPOWER WAS PUT UNDER HOURS OF GRUELING STRESS, FATIGUE, UNCERTAINTY, AND THE JITTERS!!!! JUST LIKE THE REAL OPERATIONS OF SAC BASES ALL OVER THE WORLD!!!!
THIS IS TRUELY A HUMAN DRAMA OF HIGH FLYING ADVENTURE AND CONFLICT!!!! ONE OF THE BEST MILITARY MOVIES OF TODAYS USAF THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!
MOST NOTABLE WERE THE SPECTACULAR SCENES OF THE FOUR B-52'S TAKING OFF AS PART OF AN EXERCISE! ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING!!!!
THAT CLOSE!!! INCREDIBLE!!!! ALSO THE B-52 TAKEOFF AND FLIGHT THAT LEAD MID-AIR REFUELING MISHAP AND THE EMERGENCY LANDING OF THE B-52!!!! JUST LIKE ""STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND"" WITH THE B-36 FLYOVER OF AL LANG FIELD, TAMPA FLORIDA AT THE START OF THE START OF THE FILM, AND THE IMPRESSIVE STARTUP, TAXI AND FLIGHT OF THE B-36 FROM CARSWELL AFB, FORT WORTH, TEXAS TO ALASKA AND BACK WITHOUT EVER REFUELING!!!!

I was fortunate enough to have the honor of serving in SAC for 18 years in ICBMs and being at a base with B-52s (now B-1s). When I watch this movie today, the young airmen of today will never know what's it like to see a REAL no-notice ORI and see senior officers get ""Fired"".  That's the real Air Force and this movie captured the essence of it. It still sends chills and a smile to this day to watch it.",1078704000,5,473,3.9789473684210526

I spent much of my child hood around air force bases, one of which had it`s own tanker squadron attached to it. My father and I have spent many hours dicussing what the ORI`s were really like. In truth, he has said that they were pretty much how the movie depicted them. He first entered the air force in `61 as a boom operator on KC-97`s at Selfride AFB, MI and remembers them all to well with alot of really unique comments that are best left unsaid. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who has a fond memory of the B-52`s and for what the air force used to be like along time ago.

This movie shows what SAC was really all about, the strict discipline, the ability to stay combat ready and not substituting quality because of quantity.
