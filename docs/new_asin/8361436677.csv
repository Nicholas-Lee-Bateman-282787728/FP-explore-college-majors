7900949,3,8361436677,"This is just another dance-theme movie. It's built on the story of a young woman reuniting with her father who abandoned the family during her childhood. She fell in love with a dancer-to-be. The rest is just average-quality dance routines with the usual dramatic scenes and acrobatics. Among movies of this genre, it pales by comparision with Saura's ""Tango"" which has truly top-notch music and dance performances interweaved with a very captivating plot.",1351382400,,456,5.260273972602739
