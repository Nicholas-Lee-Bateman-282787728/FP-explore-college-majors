8764760,1,B01H517YI2,"""Mightier Than Ultraman""?
I call BS!!
I have watched ULTRAMAN since I lived on Okinawa in the 60's-70's and let me tell you that Ultraman is greater than any other hero!!",1537747200,,170,4.516129032258065
8764761,5,B01H517YI2,"I'm still awe struck by the amount of greatness digitally packed onto this DVD.  And, AND(!), it keeps getting better every time i watch it.  Especially the bat monster (?)!  I can't even begin to describe that whole thing.  Just buy it.",1518307200,2,237,4.571428571428571

8764763,5,B01H517YI2,"I'm a big fan of Godzilla and the like, especially if it's from the 60s. This is an odd find,2 Japanese heroes similar to Ultraman, but even cheesier. Rubber suited monsters? You betcha. You'll howl watching Greenman, Godman, and even Jaguarman, battle thses strange creature, creature that seem to be bend on eating school children!",1468886400,2,333,5.072727272727272
8764764,3,B01H517YI2,"I could not give it 5 stars do to the price and the movie is not clear to watch. For What I ordered I should have not paid $14.00 for it .I felt that the movie should have costed $5.00 for this video and nothing more. You only get one dic and when you play it, it has lines in the picture .This movie really does need to be remastered .",1468800000,,336,3.7464788732394365
