4668328,4,B005EWRJGM,"Filmmaker Werner Herzog (GRIZZLY MAN, ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD, CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS), is drawn to extremes and the challenging edge on which some people live their lives.  With co-director Dmitry Vasyukov, Herzog takes us the remote heart of the Siberian Taiga and the village of Bakhtia, where about 300 people live on the bank of the Yenisei River virtually untouched by the modern world.  This isolated wilderness has no phone connection, running water or medical assistance and can only be reached by river or chopper.  With the exception of power saws and snowmobiles, the people maintain their culture and live as they have for hundreds of years, maybe much longer.  Herzogs distinctive narration covers and colors the life of one trapper through four seasons as he hunts, makes his skis, boat and hunters cabin.  So much was unsaid, but what was on the screen was mesmerizing.  Its good to be reminded that in our day, part of our human family lives in a world nearly unfathomable to the one we enjoy.  Big recommendation.",1362873600,48,1044,4.864406779661017
4668329,4,B005EWRJGM,"Reviews elsewhere give this film a resounding thumbs up but it should be noted that it is NOT by Herzog. It was actually filmed by Dmitry Vasyukov. The latter made a four hour documentary that was distilled by Herzog into a one hour film. As for the problems with the zone, I agree that Amazon should have noted that but that is no reason to give the DVD content a lower rating. Amazon should consider splitting the review grading into two elements: content and technical aspects, such as quality of recording or price.",1358208000,6,519,4.591397849462366
4668330,4,B005EWRJGM,"Please note that the disc is ""Region 2"" (e.g. South Africa) as stated on the actual Amazon purchase page.  The disc I purchased is also PAL, not NTSC.  My oversight on the Region 2 issue -- I don't think the seller states PAL specifically.  In any case, to play on a PC (in the States, anyway), one has to change the DVD drive settings from Region 1 to Region 2, and there is a very limited number of times one can change the drive's region setting without having to buy a new drive.",1338422400,5,483,4.172043010752688

4668332,5,B005EWRJGM,"Ive been a fan of the movies of Werner Herzog ever since the 70s, when Atlantas only art theater would feature them. In particular, I was moved by his 1977 movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heart-Of-Glass/dp/B00M7UU6GE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heart Of Glass</a>, about the impact on a medieval German village when it lost the knowledge on how to make red glass. (Ive frequently thought of the parallels with present-day America losing the knowledge and trained workforce that can make so many products). In the 70s, Herzog was most famous for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aguirre-the-Wrath-of-God/dp/B00M7UQCGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aguirre, the Wrath of God</a>. More recently, Herzog produced a documentary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grizzly-Man/dp/B007K8BDMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grizzly Man</a>&nbsp;on TimothyTreadwell, who was killed by the grizzly bears that he loved in Alaska. For Happy People, Herzog teamed up with Russian director, Nikolay Nikiforovitch Siniaev. It was released in 2013.

Bahkta is a village of 300 people, located on the Yenisei River in Siberia. The Yenisei is one of the three great rivers of Siberia; all flow to the Arctic Ocean. It is the middle one of the three; recently I read Jeffrey Taylers excellent account of his trip down the eastern-most of the three, the Lena, in his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/River-of-No-Reprieve-Descending-Siberia-s-Waterway-of-Exile-Death-and-Destiny/dp/B00EN8OA9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">River of No Reprieve: Descending Siberia's Waterway of Exile, Death, and Destiny</a>. There are no roads to Bahkta. Transportation to the village is solely by the Yenisei and by helicopter. (Google maps provides excellent detailed aerial views of the village!) The taiga, a Russian word now generally accepted in English, is the Siberian forest, which is one and a half times the size of the United States.

Happy People is a year in the life of Gennady Soloviev, who earns his livelihood in the traditional manner of a trapper, mainly of sable. He is somewhere between 50 and 60 years old, with an adult son to whom he is teaching traditional methods, including how to make a boat as well as skis from a tree that they cut down. Soloviev claims that he can outski others with store-bought synthetic-material skis. There concessions to the modern world are snowmobiles, chain saws and motors for their boats. Hand tools are used for most other work.

Soloviev looks like a dour Slav. Werner Herzog narrates the film, in English, and his intonations seem to capture Solovievs spirit. Soloviev says that he was dumped off in the taiga in the 1970s, with no radio, no winter clothes, a partner who proved to be useless, and with a promise of a stove that was never delivered. He says simply: I survived. Herzog commences his year in the spring. May 01, besides its traditional holiday associations in Russia, marks the end of winter, as the ice on the Yenisei begins to break up. May 09 is also still celebrated, and Herzog, the German, poignantly films an old veteran, bedecked with medals, from the Great Patriot War. (a/k/a World War II), in which 20 million Russians died. Then there are the maddening clouds of mosquitoes during the summer, as work moves forward to prepare for the autumn trapping season. Birch bark tar is used as a mosquito repellant.

Soloviev traps alone. He has a base cabin, and outlying cabins that have to be stocked for the season. All must be in place before the freeze. His territory is 1500 square kilometers. His son also traps, but in his own territory. He drives his snowmobile down the frozen Yenisei, a 150 km, to be at home for Christmas. His dog must run beside him. He loves his dogs (a trapper has to have them!) but will not spoil them. The last day of December was mild, at a minus 33.

Happy people? Throughout the movie, rare is even a smile. Women are in the deep background, their lives unexamined. As Herzog explains though, late in the movie, Soloviev pays no taxes, has no bosses to please, and is free of committee meetings. He is self-reliant, in an extreme world, where there is no margin for error. He is his own man. How many of us can say the same? Unmentioned in the film are the very upscale stores that sell sable coats with $90,000 price tags; so too, unmentioned are the models who go bare rather than wear fur. Yet another world.

Herzog was 70 years old when he produced this movie in 2013. His creative powers are certainly undiminished over the past almost half century. The cinematography is brilliant, and includes numerous underwater and aerial shots. And the storyline is just about perfect, with the enormity of the solitude of the taiga playing a key supportive role. 6-stars.",1490140800,5,4916,5.428010471204188

4668336,5,B005EWRJGM,"I've seen this Doc twice and have bought the DVD for my Father as a gift. Since seeing this for the first time, i've watched 2 other Werner Herzog documentaries, Encounters at the End of the Earth, and Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Happy People takes the cake by a long shot, for me. It had my full attention throughout the film. It's captivating, interesting, and makes you feel small because you forget about people living in a place like this. I'd go so far as to say it humbling to watch. These people are probably more content than happy. They know their life and their ways, and don't complain about much. They are what i'd call, a present-time tribe. They do some living off the land, jobs and currency depending upon weather and a good hunting season, and they make most of the supplies that they need.
This film is one worth owning. Herzog picked his best topic to date with this. Excellent Doc. 5 Stars.",1485302400,2,909,4.481927710843373

I'm outdoorsy, enjoy learning about subsistence living and woodworking, and love dogs.

4668340,5,B005EWRJGM,"This is a very engaging documentary, not an empty moment.  I bought B00AXYZZ6C as well as the blu ray and the region 2 DVD with English voice over.  Buy B00AXYZZ6C, the region 1 DVD; it has the Russian soundtrack with subtitles.  The English voice-over version (Art-Haus blu-ray and region 2 DVD) has the wrong emphasis and affect; it's off-putting.  Also, it has extras; an interview with Werner Herzog and a separate feature on the Siberian taiga.  This is also available on YouTube as a 4 part version without the Herzog narrative.  It's also very compelling.  Blu ray picture quality is the same as in the DVD.",1482624000,,614,4.735849056603773

4668343,5,B005EWRJGM,"Werner Herzog in his documentary films is a kind of gentle genius.  He has made such outstanding films as Fitzcarraldo, Grizzly Man among his documentaries or semi-documentaries and feature films like Aguirre, The Wrath of God.  In Happy People he presents one life, or at least a year in the life of a 60 year old Russian trapper, a man who lives in a tiny village in Siberia.  He allows the man to tell his story in his own words without the commentary that I for instance would find it impossible to omit.  And this guy is quite a guy.
  I lived in Alaska for 30 years (city, not isolated wilderness like this trapper) and so perhaps I have a particular perspective that people who have not lived in the high latitudes lack.  I have known fellows similar in out look to the trapper, quiet, immensely strong and independent men.  If Herzog's trapper has character flaws-in high latitudes the over use of booze is nearly universal-he leaves them out of the story.  The trapper is so skilled and so well adapted to his environment that he even makes his own skis.  Not many men can do that.  He is so courageous that he goes into the winter alone, with only his dog for company, for months at a time.  And he trusts his life to a Russian snow machine, which might not be courageous but rather might be crazy.  I would not do that but he can probably fix it with a bent nail.  He does not lack confidence.
  The trapper tells a great bear story, something we all enjoy--from a distance.  There are times in the spring and fall that the trapper does his various tasks--he works constantly as he must but the work changes with the seasons--when he works without gloves and I know how cold it must be for him. This guy is outstandingly tough.
  We never see the trapper put out by even dramatic events.  He has a calm, contemplative manner about him.  He has no apparent education but he could teach any of us a thing or two about how to live our lives as one of the world's Happy People.  He views himself as a free man which might contribute a lot to his happiness.
  Herzog gives us a look into an unusual life without the clutter of Herzog's opinion.  Beautifully filmed as well.",1479340800,,2179,4.3875

4668349,4,B005EWRJGM,"Another wonderful excursion by Herzog. Herzog shapes Vasyukov's stunning footage into a compelling journey through the lives of the trappers, their families and the villages of the Taiga. The footage of the trappers remote outposts and seclusion is fascinating. Another highlight is the explanation of the centuries old deadfall trap used by the trapper Gannady. I noticed only one glaringly bad lowlight: When Gannady shoots a bird, obviously a spruce grouse, Werner refers to it as a woodcock. There is absolutely no resemblance between the two birds. Shame on Herzog. His attention to detail and perfection is legendary. I was dumbfounded that he would make such an error in his narration. Overlooking that small but conspicuous mistake, the rest of the film is mesmerizing. Highly recommended.",1475452800,,797,5.333333333333333

4668361,4,B005EWRJGM,"Presumably the title is meant to be somewhat ironic; the people depicted certainly aren't happy all the time, but have a rugged life.

The box is not entirely accurate; it says that it describes a way of life little changed for centuries. However, while the movie does describe a group of natives whose way of life is dying out, the film concentrates mainly on people sent in by the Soviet government decades ago to do hunting and trapping.

Unlike other Herzog movies I've seen, the people depicted are far from quirky or weird. They are normal and rational people living the only way to live in their locale, trapping furs to sell, buying few outside supplies (such as tools and snowmobiles) as needed, but otherwise building their own cabins, trapping and hunting their own food, depending on their dogs but treating them without sentiment. The film concentrates mostly on the trappers and their routines; you see little of their wives and families.

The people are happy in the sense that they have the freedom to act on their own instead of having to follow orders, I assume.",1466294400,,1080,4.764705882352941

The fact that I was blindsided by it was part of what made it so enjoyable so I'll spare the spoilers.
 I loved this film, gave it to a couple other folks as a gift and they were all positively impressed too. Mr. Herzog seldom if ever, strikes out.",1452556800,,461,4.122222222222222
4668468,4,B005EWRJGM,"Really enjoyed watching the real-time trapping and fishing scenes. As one that follows several of the Alaska-featured series of programs this film in Siberia is very intriguing in a similar way. The odd thing for me was the extreme disconnect between the title, ""HAPPY PEOPLE"" and the rather morose music track! Wow, what gloomy tunes.

True there are definite hardships for people groups and persons who struggle in the wild and in cultural disconnects but the highlight of the film and the title are perfectly in-sync and that is.... FREEDOM is HAPPINESS. One of the lead character's states so clearly and beautifully that true happiness is when you are your own man, free of government, taxation, and particularly communism!

BRAVO to this individual who proclaims the Truth!

Too bad the director couldn't weave a truly 'happy' emotive experience for the viewer.",1452470400,,866,5.127659574468085

I would have enjoyed seeing the inside of a home and some of the hardships faced by women.  What techniques do they use to wash clothing and prepare food?  The trappers belonged to a close-knit community, but we only saw brief glimpses of this.

4668519,4,B005EWRJGM,"Werner Herzog is known mostly for his feature films but has made documentaries throughout his career. One might think that a director whose films are known for their intensity would be ill suited to the documentary form, but this is not the case with Herzog. This is a very straightforward documentary about life in the great Siberian forest known as the Taiga. There is no strong political or even ecological theme, and so sense of romanticizing things to the point where the hunters become noble and pure or anything like that.

The location the the isolated village of Bakhta on the Yenisei River, in the middle of the vast region known as Siberia, which is everything you'd expect it to be: far from ordinary civilization, cold and snowy during a long winter when even the river is frozen, and with only a brief summer. The story, such as there is one focuses on three hunters, Nicolai and his friends Gennady and Anatoly.

It opens with a still snow-covered spring when eventually the river ice breaks up and melts and boats and supplies can come in again. Then summer, which is spent preparing for the next winter and the return of the hunting season. These hunters hunt sable for their fur using many techniques that must date back centuries. Carving canoes and skis out of trees,building and maintaining survival cabins in the wilderness in an area where each hunter has a thousand square miles to roam. Some modern things are used, like outboard motors, chainsaws ans snowmobiles. Along the way you touch on the hunter's dogs, the building of traps, dealing with bears, the remaining indigenous people, and Christmas in the village. Life here is hard but these men value their freedom from being constantly told what to do and have a certain matter of fact attitude about them when dealing with nature, something refreshingly in contrast to the often overly romanticized Western vision that Herzog dealt with to an extent in Grizzly Man.

Although it's absolutely alien to anyone experience of modern civilization, in time you get to feel real empathy for these people and their hard lifestyle in which everything they do counts. Even the brief summer here is plagued with that bane of the North, mosquitoes, which must be dealt with by making a repellent out of birch bark. Herzog narrates the documentary himself. mostly describing  what's going on without inserting a lot of opinion.

Overall, if you're inclined to like this kind of documentary, this is a good one. I would have liked to see and learn more about the rest of the village, what everyone else does, how families are raised, etc. Though they make brief appearances, one really gets no idea what day to day life is like in the village for women and children. The title, ""Happy People"" seems to refer to these three hunters, and not necessarily to the whole village as the title led me to think. So in this way I found the focus a bit narrow. Also, there is no mention that in the end all of this work ends up in the almost opposite world of women's fashion, a trivial world compared to the almost elemental struggles of these men. I think this was intentional, as it would undercut the feeling of man coexisting in nature that is at the heart of this film, but it is part of what it is about. Worth seeing for a different take on life.",1448150400,,3310,4.680412371134021

My own feeling is that people can be ""happy,"" in all of the millions of lifestyles around the world, even in the most dreary and depressing, because the alternative is failure to survive.  We are adaptable and finding solace and a measure of happiness is one of our tools of survival.

4668629,5,B005EWRJGM,"I was almost immediately enthralled with this documentary about the life of a trapper in the boreal forest of Siberia in the town of Bakhta (population around 300). I did not expect it to be so interesting, but looking at the credits of director Werner Herzog, 68 in all, I am not so surprised. Apparently I have stumbled upon a great director of documentary films that previously I knew nothing about. Also directing was Dmitry Vasyukov.

What makes this work so well is the clear, concrete detail shown as the trapper (Nikolay Nikiforovitch Siniaev, I believe) goes about what he has to do throughout the entire year in order to survive in the harsh climate. What must be done in spring as he prepares for the melting of the snow (and the mosquitos!) is very different from what must be done in the dead of winter when there is ice on the mans beard. Interesting enough during both winter and summer they fish the river for pike, breaking ice in winter and throwing nets in the summer, which they either smoke or feed to the dogs.

The dogs! In this film we can see clearly the essential symbiotic relationship between humans and dogs. It is not clear that the trapper would be able to do his work without the help of his dogs. The dogs ears and its sense of smell augment the mans knowledge and experience so that together we see them work as a team. When the man makes a mosquito repellent from the bark of a birch tree (I think it was birch) he rubs it on his dogs as well.

The amount of carpentry and other wood working that the trapper has to do, including making craft to navigate the rivers and streams, is surprising. Of course the traps he makes are made mostly of wood. He traps sable for its valuable fur. To do so he has to place traps over a wide area which means he has to maintain various cabins in the woods that he and whoever is working with him can stay overnight since the treks cover many miles of frozen ground. We see him knocking down the snow piled high on the cabins, repairing damage made by bears, etc.

The idea that the people are happy and especially the trapper cannot be argued with even though their lives are hard. The lifes lesson here is that when a man is consumed with work that he has to do, that is necessary for his survival, and it is work that he can do, that he has developed the skills to do, that man is happy. He is happy partly because he is close to nature; in fact he is immersed in nature in a way similar to way hunters and gathers were in Paleolithic times. It can be argued that that world, however challenging, is one that is natural for humans. (Of course there are other natural environments, some very different such as an equatorial jungle demanding a different set of skills.)

After watching this I intend to watch some of Herzogs other films.

By the way, Klaus Badelts score is beautiful and haunting.

A favorite featured Taiga native is a wize, really likable, industrious, humble trapper. It seems that there is centuries old traditions of trapping, hunting, and fishing. Furs from sables is a popular trade. As a former licensed wild life rescuer and rehabber; the more brass tacks trapping footage was uncomfortable for me. Though, this featured trapper was an excellent human being.

Fascinating, too, was footage on the dying Ket indigenous natives. Sort of self exterminating themselves with rampant alcoholism and dangerous, low paying jobs. Very, very sad.

Being afforded a lifestyle where there is ample contemplative time such as many of us in America and in other so-called modern countries enjoy is a source of immense gratitude for me.

4668756,4,B005EWRJGM,"I really liked this movie.  It is an ethnographic study of the yearly cycle of work for fur trappers.  Deals in detail the various chores that have to be accomplished during each season to maximize their chances of a successful trapping year.  The trappers live a solitary life during the winter, depend on their dogs for companionship and help.  They are skilled woodsmen and make everything they need to survive in 40-50 below zero temperatures.
They have no roads, no cars no electricity, but the skidoo gets them around.  During the summer the rivers are open so heavy building materials and provisions can be moved by water.

4668785,5,B005EWRJGM,"A fascinating look at a frontier-style Siberian settlement and how those in it live off of the land. The story follows several Russian men who have very different philosophies and how it affects their work as trappers. In addition to their trapping (which is mercifully non-graphic) the story follows how they make their homes, interact with each other and the local native tribe. You'll also learn interesting facts, such as how to insulate a cabin with moss and mud and that Siberia swarms with mosquitoes in the summer months.

For those who know little about Siberia, and those who are more familiar, this is an excellent show.",1442102400,,631,4.897196261682243
4668786,5,B005EWRJGM,"Herzog might follow most the trapper that epitomizes his thesis of rugged, atavistic self-reliance, but this is a great piece that no one else in the world would be able to produce with such pizzazz or narrative control.",1442016000,,220,4.815789473684211

4668791,4,B005EWRJGM,"Nice documentary about a people who's lives aren't bothered by modern amenities (or needed). Unbelievably hardy folk who's knowledge and skill in surviving in a world of brutal harshness is captivating. If you're an anti-fur person or anti-hunting then this film is not for you. The trapping methods they use are far different from the fur ""farms"" that most people are accustomed to. These people run trap-lines that require unbelievably hard work and a thorough knowledge of the animals they hunt. Most of the trappers use a ""dead-fall' method that kills the animal immediately and they don't suffer. Even though I am anti-fur I can understand why they trap as it's one of the few ways they can make a living and feed their families. The one cool thing is that these people have no boss and spend their lives making a living by using the natural resources provided them and they are totally in tune to nature and it's fickleness, harshness and beauty. Their dogs are their pride and joy and are unbelievably tough, smart and hardy animals who are part of their families. This is a film that should be experienced just to see how a people have survived in a world without technology, it's like stepping back a hundred years into the past.",1442016000,3,1238,4.736111111111111
4668792,5,B005EWRJGM,"This film depicts the spectacularly beautiful landscape of the forests and rivers of the far north and the wiry folks who live there, without romanticizing their lifestyles.  These folks are humble, not because it's fashionable to be humble, but because this climate allows little to be taken for granted.  It was enlightening to hear the trapper discuss his philosophy about honesty as it relates to killing wild animals for a living, as opposed to killing domesticated animals to have something to eat.  The game warden's comment that the extreme cold keeps parasitic people away (who need larger cities to ply their ways) is also thought-provoking.  If you want to glimpse a life without self-deception, or clarify your inner self, this is a wonderful film to watch.  These Happy People accept life without fear, guarantees, or guile.",1442016000,2,837,5.125

I had hoped to learn how the people living  on the Taiga were happy and content with their very simple, unplugged lifestyle, so different from our Americanized culture of constant connection.

They can't make a living in the fur trade without their dog's help, yet the dog only gets fed a few tiny scraps of fish in the morning and one meal of left over fish at night.

4668856,5,B005EWRJGM,"I was completely captivated by this film. It's well narrated and beautifully shot. The Siberian Taiga resembles my own region so much that it looked almost like home. The biggest difference being we may get temperatures of -30 or -40 but they are nighttime temps and rarely do we get more than 15-20 of them in a winter.
The lifestyle portrayed seems ideal and but for my own limited experience hunting, camping and playing in this environment I could be tempted to think of it as a northern Eden. One could not be blamed for the temptation to seek such a lifestyle especially for the portrayal of the simplicity and quietude shown by Herzog and company.
Before you go though, realize that the means to survival is brutally hard work and the requisite skills involved are not acquired in a year or even three. For the young man or woman looking for a more basic and natural lifestyle I would say go North while you are young and test your mettle in the flower of your youth. I wish that I were 18 again, who knows? I may have ended up in the wilds of North America living what at present can only be a dream.

It features one Russian man in particular and I like how the filmmaker, Werner Herzog, gives him plenty of space to talk about his life.  For several months a year (in winter!) he lives alone in a cabin he built himself, trapping mink for a living.  His only companion is his dog.  There's a lot of space in this movie overall actually.  There's some narration and some places where the people speak for themselves and also a fair amount of ""open space"" shall I say with no words at all, just film.

4668998,4,B005EWRJGM,"I always enjoy seeing documentaries about people in other walks of life, so I gave this movie a go one night. What an interesting way to see the four seasons through the eyes of a Siberian trapper. You'll get to see the usual with this type of film: challenging terrain, tough weather, unpredictable wildlife, remote locale, hard labor, simple life. With all that, the featured trappers and their families seem very content and yes, very happy.

As a dog lover, I was also completely fascinated by the animals who are not only companions, but hunting partners. Dogs running free in the snow and the woods, surefooted on a rough boat ride, chomping fish and raw meat, and hunting. These beasts seem as much at home in the wild as a wolf, and it's amazing to see them at work doing what they were designed for. The trappers treat their dogs as working animals, not pets, and yet it's clear that they also appreciate and care for them deeply. One trapper tells the tale of losing two dogs to a bear attack, and finishes by admitting he was overcome by sadness when one died in his arms.

The daily life of the trappers is a wonder. Working with apparently the sharpest tools on earth (!!) they skin the bark off trees in one swoop, carve a boat from a giant log, fashion thin bentwood skis from wood planks they manually split, and routinely hack their way through the woods. Heads up: trapping sable for the fur trade is their vocation, so you will see a variety of dead animals in traps. The work is hard, yet these trappers seem not only to endure it but also enjoy it.

This movie is well worth the time, and great to watch with children.",1438387200,6,1639,4.456666666666667

Also, there is no proof that these men are happy. The voice overs of the movie makers claim all sorts of highfaluting idealism about the lives of these men, but they never actually ask the men how they feel about the lives they live. The men are only allowed to speak for themselves when it comes to the details of trapping, training their dogs, etc. Also, though the voice overs wax lyrical about how these men lead lives untouched by modernity, the men use motorboats, ATVs, chain saws and electricity whenever they can.

4669053,4,B005EWRJGM,"Long ago, I lived for several years in the Maine wilderness, in a very small and primitive log cabin I built myself, far from electricity and telephones and neighbors.  Our winters were sometimes severe, -30 F and with deep snow, but not so bad as those in this film, which I watched with interest.

This film should be viewed, especially by younger Americans, to see how life is not the same as their experience and to learn something of other people and other ways.  Some reviewers expected to see a plot [in a documentary!], and they found instead a slice of life in a world different from their own.

You should avoid this film only if you have no curiosity about the world and other people and other ways.",1437523200,3,710,4.48062015503876

I learned how to survive in unwelcome environments and though the people looked fairly happy, I have a feeling that is because they are not familiar with other environments They must work so terribly hard just to live, not to proper, but even though they had to kill for a living they seemed to care very much for humane treatment of their prey..

It's quite an androgenic misogynistic perspective. The simple life sis not so simple...subsistence, and trapping so that people can wear sable coats.

Something about the beginning of the film put me off...possibly I was being squeamish about the brutality of animal trapping...but I came back to it.  The remainder of the film really illuminates the lives of the men who live in the Taiga during the winter.  It's really an amazing movie. Their dogs work hard, too.

This film features men of the Siberian wilderness who are made ""Happy"" by contentedly eeking out their hard living in hunter/gatherer fashion. Certainly not a way-of-life for the majority of us who favor modernism: the ease of pushing buttons, home delivery, and cell phones as an integral extension of our physical beings.

The main hunter, named Gennady, has a very good philosophical approach to how he treats his dogs, how he hunts, and life in general.  The level of physical exertion required over time is pretty impressive, particularly where a canoe is hewn out of a tree.

What it lacks in polish and wiz bang, it covers in gritty mind melding artic cold and the beauty of starkness one part and winter wonderland (sorta) the next.

It was all about these men, everyone else was secondary.  I wanted to see village life and hear discussions and the views of the women and families and how everyone worked together, but in this male dominated medium, you only hear the hunter's view, as if no one else was important enough, except for one male veteran.

They aren't particularly happy, this movie should have been called, ""We treat animals like crud: A year in the Taiga"" This is about men who hunt sable to sell for fur, men who depend on their working dogs to hunt but are very nonchalant about the quality of life of these animals.

We were limited on supplies that we could take in so we hunted and trapped to make a living. I didn't find much happiness in the people in the movie.

4669313,3,B005EWRJGM,I enjoyed this movie.  Can't imagine who anyone can live in Siberia.  I am hoping that the director would have filmed or a follow-up film about the women and children and how they survive like that in the wilderness.

4669363,5,B005EWRJGM,"I found the film though-provoking.  While it can certainly be argued that the featured trappers are ""happy people,"" one wonders at the rest of village life (including the quality of life of the trappers' wives and children, and whether they would also consider themselves happy) as these scenes were largely tangential.  Is the happiness of some destined to be always at the expenses of others?  Certainly the film did somewhat briefly touch on the fact that the majority of the native Ket people (who would have traditionally filled the roles of trappers and hunters in the villages along that river) did not appear to be happy at all, in fact their lives were largely destroyed by alcoholism and presumably the least lucrative jobs in the village, collecting and chopping up driftwood. So in a very clear way, the happiness of the featured trappers was a direct result of the previous Russian state policies which broke up traditional Ket societies.  I knew nothing of the Siberian Taiga before watching this film so it was worth it for the educational aspect alone.  I definitely enjoyed watching the trappers building their traditional (and humane!) traps and skis by hand as well as the one Ket man crafting his dugout canoe.",1433635200,,1230,4.9227053140096615
4669364,4,B005EWRJGM,"One of the things I look for in a film in this genre is whether I could identify with the environment or people.  Herzog has clearly met the goal with this movie.  My first thought upon finishing the film was that these people would certainly survive the apocalypse.  My second thought was I would not want to be reincarnated as one of their hunting dogs!  150 km run when he could have put me on the snowmobile?  C'mon!

Anyway, a good film and well worth renting.",1433635200,,465,4.348837209302325
4669365,4,B005EWRJGM,"Covers much of the same ground as that slew of Alaska wilderness TV shows. The difference is that this film has far more patience to demonstrate the craftsmanship and lifestyle of the characters. No constant flipping back and forth for an short attention span audience. When viewed without interruption, a trapper making traps and a native man making a dug-out canoe are really impressive. They are allowed to tell their own stories, and the result is to put a human face on the enterprise.",1433548800,,490,4.845238095238095

The only thing this documentary is good for is to lull you to sleep and Herzog's flat monotone narration will KEEP you asleep, so you better make sure you empty your bladder before starting the movie.

The perspective of the Siberians profiled here is unique & appeals to my own increasing sense of discontent w/ the noisy busy-ness of my own city-bound existence.  The only reason I wouldn't give it a five-star rating is that it focuses so much on the trappers; members of the village that live away from their families for months at a time.  I think it would've been a balanced presentation if the film makers had spent a near equal amount of time talking about the villagers that remain & how they cope w/ the winter months including how they raise their children & even how many kids grow up to remain or return to their home town.

4669490,5,B005EWRJGM,I loved every moment of this movie. It would be a town and a people I could feel at home in. A lifestyle I myself could have lived if I had not chosen another path. Movies like this remind us that people are people all over the world if they would just keep religion and politics out of the picture and just let people live their lives in peace there would be harmony.,1432598400,,368,4.054794520547945

If you think ""Happy"" means trapping animals, killing fish, and being separated from your family for long periods, then you will be delighted. If however, you have any interest in the lives of other villagers, their customs, and their daily routines then skip this film. If you have any interest in why the native people are struggling to survive surrounded by a village of Russian trappers, then look elsewhere.

4669499,5,B005EWRJGM,"A look at what it takes to be a man and to be a predator in a wilderness, to provide for your family. Very primitive, very primeval. If you don't connect with this film as a man, you are still nursing. If you don't connect with this film as a woman, then you don't deserve the gifts men have provided for you. The funny part of it all is that so many people have no clue as to where their provisions are coming from, nor do they care, as long as they keep coming......ps, my dog LOVED this movie!!!! she watched the whole thing.

Even there, there are modern conveniences and outside influences such as snowmobiles, chainsaws, axes, and helicopters.  Some of the old skills are dying off (canoe building and spirit doll making) and trapping is mostly for extra cash and their own sustenance.  It's a hard life but not without it's rewards: going out and finding your own food, knowing you can build your own shelters, and storing enough food at least to avoid starvation.  Are they really happy, though?  More like they are satisfied not having to move to a city to make a living.",1432080000,,654,4.752212389380531

Good information on the men and their dogs that are hunters. That is about it however.

Good filming and sound, worth s look but you will not get much more than wilderness hunting adventure from this.",1431993600,,407,4.45945945945946

4669574,4,B005EWRJGM,From the title we had no idea what this movie was about but decided to give it a try.  We were pleasently pleased.  It is somewhat of a documentary but still a very interesting film about Siberia and the hardships the people that live there endure.  Because of the language barrier on most of the interviews there are subtitles but they are only a minor detraction.  The narrator does an excellent job which adds to the enjoyment of the film.

For example, the movie briefly touches on the phenomenally high rates of alcoholism in communities like this, but does not explore this aspect of rural sub-arctic Russian settlements.

4669721,4,B005EWRJGM,"""Happy People: A Year in the Taiga"" is an intriguing documentary about a year in the life of a trapper from the tiny remote Siberian village of Bakhtia on the river Yenisei.  About 300 people inhabit the village that is bereft of modern conveniences.  Its hard to believe that such a small band of hardy souls could eke out an existence in such extreme conditions.  How could such a place still exist in the 21st century?  It is amazing how the main character, the trapper, ventured off alone in the winter with only his dog, hunted the entire season, and returned alive.  He built his own traps, built and repaired his huts, built his own canoes, and more.  He was so tough he considered -33 degrees C too warm!

The movie isn't for everyone.  It is slow moving, has subtitles because it was filmed in Russian, and doesn't have much of a plot.  However, for me those shortcomings were overshadowed by the amazing grit and ingenuity of the trapper.",1430956800,,948,4.562130177514793

4669725,2,B005EWRJGM,"This documentary follows a few individuals through a year of life in the hostile Siberian countryside, where they choose to live and work.  They are trappers and much of the movie shows them making their traps, preparing for trapping season, and actually trapping.  There's a little bit of village life shown.  Not much.  I found it a little interesting but a bit more depressing.  There wasn't much smiling, let alone happiness very evident.  The sound quality wasn't good either, as it was very difficult to hear the narration over the background music.",1430956800,,555,4.978260869565218

I had no idea that that part of Siberia was even inhabited nor did I know that there was a native culture ""middle of nowhere"" that has suffered just as much at the hands of the predominant Russian culture as Native Americans at the hands of Europeans who were newish to the Americas.

4669742,5,B005EWRJGM,"I thought this was an interesting film because - in my view - it simply documents the challenging, awe-inspiring lives of people who primarily live off the land in a very remote village deep in the Russian Taiga forest.  In particular, it focuses on the men in the village that spend long months alone in the winter as trappers in even more remote and spartan conditions deeper in the forest.  There's no big point made, no preaching about climate change, etc.  It's just a portrait of their lives, which are extraordinary compared to our normal urban/sub-urban lives in the developed world.  Oh, and I could listen to Werner Herzog's voice as the narrator for hours and hours.",1430956800,,677,4.760683760683761

This is in spite of the fact that we realize they are far from primitive (there do ride snow mobiles). In spite of all the anachronisms, Herzog's cinematography shows us a glimpse of the primeval.

4669899,5,B005EWRJGM,"Before you watch this, click on the Special Features and listen to Werner Herzog's introduction of the movie at a New York event  -- He makes it clear that none of the actual filming was done by him.  Rather it was the work of Dmitry Vasyukov, who produced four 1-hour films about life in the Siberian taiga, on the Yenisei River.  With Vasyukov's permission and encouragement -- and the remarkably free hand that Vasyukov gave him -- Herzog edited the material down to approximately 90 minutes that is what you have on this DVD.  Herzog also created the commentary and had the music re-done.  He is quite open about the fact that he has never been to Bakhta, the village in the taiga, and that he has never met Vasyukov, although he has skyped with him.  Obviously too, Herzog fell in love with the dogs . . . and so will you if you see this movie.

Happy people, because they are free, living by the ""rules"" that nature dictates in these very unforgiving conditions.  Herzog clearly sees them -- and it seems Vasyukov did too -- as moral examples.  All their lives are lived forward, as it were, preparing in one season for what will be required of them in the next.  This is a life they cheerfully accept and understand that to many people it will seem deprived and harsh beyond endurance.  But they have a sense of nature as an environment in which they can thrive and which has called forth skills and qualities that have been lost perhaps in a ""consumer"" society.  The structure, as Herzog has shaped it, is around the seasons and their particular tasks.  The story, such as it is, focuses on the ten or so trappers in the village -- they are the ones who spend the winter out in the woods trapping sable and catching fish.  To say that they are resourceful is to understate the point, and while their work involves killing, it's hardly on a huge scale, and one of the trappers talks about how much better it is than farming -- he could hardly bring himself to shoot his livestock when he was a farmer.  Out in the taiga, the animals have a chance, and if they die, he says, they die quickly and humanely.  And then there are the dogs.  There's discussion of what makes a good dog, but it seems that even less good dogs, as well as old dogs, stay in the village and are well treated.  The ones that go into the taiga are something special . . . And, as you might expect, the footage of the natural environment, in all seasons, is often spectacular, and these are the images we and Herzog owe to Vasyukov and his crew.  Herzog is obviously drawn to extreme conditions and situations that test people.  Here, there's no extreme of weirdness, as in ""Grizzly Man,"" but the situation is extreme by our standards, and yet these people have lives that can make sense to us.  Highly recommended.",1424563200,,2793,4.4372549019607845

4669905,4,B005EWRJGM,"Interesting documentary on the lives of trappers and hunters in deep Siberia, along the banks of the river Yenisei, during the four seasons of the year. For instance, in summer, we see them fishing and collecting nuts and berries. In autumn, we see them preparing traps, collecting and splitting wood and hoarding food as they prepare for the winter, where the weather can be as low as -50 degrees centigrade. They have a hermit, mostly self reliant life style, living in log cabins deep in the forest accompanied only by their dogs, with minimal contact with other people. They also seem to be exclusively male. They have some modern technology at their disposal, though they also live and hunt with traditional instruments. Despite the title, they do not seem particularly happy, they look more like taciturn, silent and reserved, able to make a living with very little. The documentary also had a detour seeing the native, shamanistic, Vodka-ravaged Ket people fishing and building their boats (an interesting fact, not mentioned in the movie, is that the Ket people are believed by anthropologists and geneticists to be the closest ancestors of native Americans).

Note: This has been widely credited as a Werner Herzog film, but all the German director did was edit an original Russian TV miniseries directed by Dmitri Vasyukov (he filmed them year round) that lasted four hours into 90 minutes for international release. Herzog also provides narration in his trademark German accented English, accompanied sometimes by his ponderous philosophizing.",1420934400,,1554,5.191235059760956

Actually, the main character in this film is a thoughtful and intelligent man making his living trapping sables in a Siberia virtually devoid of natives.
There were many tribes or types, as in the Americas. Now there are fewer than live in Arizona. Guns, germs, and alcohol.
And that led me to look up Alexander Solzhenitsyn, of Gulag Archipelago fame, who came to believe in God later in life. I perhaps can understand this as a result of contemplating the line by John Lennon: ""God is a concept by which we measure our pain"". Yup.

4669918,3,B005EWRJGM,"This documentary follows the life, in a year, of a small and remote village of people in Siberia. The village is so remote that it can only be reached via helicopter or boat (with the latter only during the summer). The people make their living primarily through the trapping of animals. The documentary, specifically, concentrates on the lives of the fur trappers. One really learns a lot about the trappers. Not only their routines and techniques, in terms of trapping of animals and survival, but also their feelings. While they are away from their families and village they basically live alone and depend entirely on themselves for survival. True mountain men.  The DVD captures this very well.

However, and I have to admit I cannot quite pin down the exact reasons, the movie is not quite up to Herzogs other movies. Some reviews criticize the movie for its not up to par video and sound but considering the conditions it was shot under (i.e., hideous weather conditions, etc.) this reviewer really does not believe these criticisms are valid. Plus they really do not detract from the movie much. The subtitle fonts are difficult to read, however, and this definitely distracts from the movie. But as I have written before, there is something about the movie that this reviewer just cannot pin down that prevents it from reaching Herzogs other documentaries in terms of quality.

4669942,4,B005EWRJGM,"Once again, Werner Herzog is off the beaten track with this excellent 90-minute 2010 documentary.  In the heart of the Siberian Taiga (where temperatures plummet to minus 50C in winter), is the tightly-knit collective settlement of Bakhta, home to 300 souls. Accessible only by helicopter, or by boat in the brief mosquito infested summers, these hardy folk contentedly eke out a living in much the same way as their forebears have for hundreds of years, except for a few motorized devices, such as chain saws, outboard motors and snowmobiles.

While the movie is credited to Herzog, who narrates in his sparse understated manner (in English), Russian co-producer Dimitry Vasyukov had shot most of the footage before Herzog became involved.

The movie centers around a year in the life of a couple of trappers, who, despite their trade, mostly have a rigid and ethical moral code. They are disciplined, independent and resourceful - each season demanding special tasks and talents to ensure that the cycle continues - to support their families, dogs and the mutually dependent hamlet. As one trapper says : ""You can take away a man's health and wealth, but not his skill.""

Despite finding any hint of animal cruelty abhorrent, the trappers trade did not offend me. They are not killing sable for sport. It is done as humanely as possible, in order to earn a living and provide sustenance. The same applies to fishing.

The pivotal role that their dogs play, and the trappers' intuitive understanding of what constitutes a solid working dog, is fascinating. They have a strong bond with their well-trained dogs, who are their only companions during the bleak trapping season.

Initially I found it disturbing that experienced trappers leave their dogs outside in rudimentary shelters and make them run alongside the sled without food or rest for 150 kilometers or more on the journeys home from their remote trapping huts. But on reflection, I realized that these are working dogs, not pampered house pets. Should a trapper be injured or fall ill, the dogs have to be fit enough and familiar with the terrain to return to the village alone to summon help.

My only criticism comes from the one-dimensional aspect of this documentary. Apart from briefly showing how the indigenous people have had to resort to menial labour due to alcoholism, and an arbitrary visit from a politician soliciting votes for the upcoming election (about which there is a dry comment from Herzog that the voters couldn't care less) we gain little information on the lives of the rest of the community.

How do the women and non-trappers occupy their time? What provisions are flown in and how often? Are the children educated and to what level?  Do they remain there, or move on? There is a long list of unanswered questions.

This is not Herzog's finest work to date, after Grizzly Man, Encounters at the End of the World and Into the Abyss, and may distress some viewers, but is nevertheless highly recommended. The art of accomplished documentary making is objectivity and Herzog has largely succeeded here.",1393113600,,3088,4.967054263565892
4669943,4,B005EWRJGM,"This is a very good video that I highly recommend to anyone.  Everything that Herzog does is interesting, but I gave it a 4 because it dragged in a few places.  The delivery was fine.",1392163200,,183,4.2
4669944,3,B005EWRJGM,"We paid for the HD version but I don't think it was delivered as such--I saw no distinction in the resolution, saturation, and so on, that would make me think it was HD.

The narration is in English but all the dialog is subtitled Russian. It's a pet peeve, but, having to read subtitles means you miss much of the style and imagery of the film. And, because it seems to require much less Russian to express thoughts than English, you've got to read (in some cases) quite fast.

The film is interesting in its simplicity. Lots of questions came to mind about how these folks interact with the outside world, but little is mentioned. We see more of the romantic aspects of the life than what must be its reality. Happy People? I don't know. Perhaps more content.",1391299200,,761,4.467625899280575
4669945,5,B005EWRJGM,"This film will mesmerize those folks who dream of escape from the modern world and its ratrace.  Plenty of Russians feel the same as Americans and Europeans, especially men, and so off they go to the great escape from government, bureaucracy, taxes and lack of space:  Siberia!  So it's minus 50 or 60 in winter - at least there's no one on your back!  At least, if you are a good, strong and healthy he-man with an ax, hand-made skis, a modern jetski, guns, weather gear, gasoline and a family (i.e. women and kids and cheap native Ket labor) back in the village of Bahkta to handle the rest of life.

This was originally a film shot by a Russian filmmaker, Vasyukov, a wonderful four hours showing the seasons of life in the Yenesei river in Eastern Siberia.  Werner Herzog, a renowned GErman filmmaker, saw all four of the hours while visiting a friend in Los Angeles.  He decided to use 1.5 hours of the footage with his own classic, simple voiceover showing the life of the hard-working and self-reliant Russian hunters who spend all the ""warm"" months getting ready for their harsh and long rivers.  The men are each in charge of their own traps and territories, they go independently, each alone with his own indispensible dog, to hunt sable, mink, and any other furs to pay their bills.

I myself loved the life of Finnish Lapland when I was there in the 1980's, so naturally I loved this film.  But would the average viewer looking for action and a plot?  No, this film is a meditative dream, so commonly found in German and Scandanavian men, that they can escape their crowded societies and be free, natural and completely independent men.  That they are not, well, never mind, let's not quibble about the details on how the men depend on the women, the government for their trapping and hunting rights, the boats and helicopters that bring tourists and supplies in summer, and the right to the land itself.

Our main character, Anatoli Blume, was a 20-year-old in 1970, who applied to be a Siberian hunter and was dropped to survive on his own devices by plane.  The first year he almost died, but he learned and became by age 60, as we see him in his bearded and rather gnarly Tolystoyan quiet self, an accomplished and successful and HAPPY man.  So we are told.

Each viewer can decide for himself if Anatoli, the Ket (natives), and his wife and children are happy.  There are some intimations that the failing, government-dependent Asiatic natives, sometimes called Ostyak, who do the cheap-income hard labor such as stacking wood for wages, are an alcoholic and miserable bunch.  Their lot under the Tsars and the Soviet anti-kulak movement is something anyone can read here online.  That they themselves admit that they could stop drinking, work hard and be happy, is an interesting admission as they grunt through the wood-loading.  In other words, it's up to each person, even in that godforsaken village of 300, to find happiness, just as it is in New York or Moscow or a small Kansas town.  What is also worth noting if you'd like to stop the film and see the Ket more closely:  these are the people most closely connected to the natives of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Californian natives, called Miwok.  The language analysts say that their language is a different one from the majority of the Siberian languages, closer in structure to Vietnamese, inflected to a high degree.

There are only about 1600 of these people left and not all know their native tongue.

Meanwhile, in this film, Anatoli was a young married man in 1970, but the first wife left after a year.  He stayed and remarried, to a woman who appears Eurasian, who is nameless, stoical and very quiet.  She accepts his long absences; we mainly see her as someone who waits for his arrivals, spends Christmas with him, or the celebration of the end of WWII (Stalin's victory over the Nazis), and of Anatoli's children we see only a blur.  I found this a little disconcerting; was it all chopped from the original four hours?

Anatoli represents the man who can live on his own without help; without answering to higher authority.  But in the face of Siberian winter, alone in his handmade log huts in 20 hours of darkness and minus 60 temperatures, can he not occasionally feel fear?  I think what would be better in describing these hunters' lives:  quiet contentment and SISU, the Finnish quality of endurance and submission to harsh and difficult problems.  What may appear as SISU, however, can mask a deep unhappiness.

That is where the heavy drinking of Russia, especially Siberia, comes in.  Anatoli and the others do not seem to be addicted, but they do have a glass of vodka to send them off for their long hunting alone in the winter months.

You will see the fat pike of the Russian rivers, the making of a tar out of birch linings and fish oil to fight the ferocious mosquitoes, the making of a canoe by hand, the building of log hunter's huts, the stacking of food high above a bear's reach, the building of wooden traps and the laying of steel traps (individual hunters have their own methods and don't all agree), the hacking of trees which block a jetski's path, and the endless work of survival against snow, snow, snow.  The burden of snow on the roof of the houses - it is constantly building up and crash the roof down.

The breakup of the ice on the river in spring is amazing to see.

The dog's desperate hunting of a mink inside a fallen log, and his killing of it finally, is a great dramatic scene - if alarming, for those who don't like to thinking about the dog-eat-mink world out there, and the bear-eat-dog lifestyle as well.

Dogs are held in great affection but are definitely the workhorses, kept on a strict discipline and diet.

I can highly recommend this as a nature film, and I did like Werner Herzog's voice in GErman.  On the DVD you can hear the GErman and read the English translation underneath.  It is so typical GErman to dream of escape into the wilderness. I remember that int he Yukon, a month's trip in 1993, the place was full of Germans, Austrians, Swiss and Scandanavians, hunting, fishing, canoing, camping, cooking and eating and drinking by campfires.  It was the Marlboro Man's dream come true.

Do women have a place in this?  Well, somewhere, yes, but not in the film - not much.  No romance for primitive hunting man!

Herzog's exposition is a continuation of that theme.

Our oblation for living the wealthiest, healthiest and best lifestyle in the history of the world, is to genuflect to those people who live simply and quietly. It's actually a strange form of moral conceit, our acknowledgement of moral inferiority for not living close to the land, as we happily shop on e-bay and buy our conveniently packaged and tasty fast food.

I awoke this morning in my warm, cozy bed, thankful for indoor plumbing and hot coffee, and reflected on the lives of the people I had seen in the film.  Theirs is a very traditional life, devoid of most modern conveniences, save for chainsaws and snowmobiles.  Accessible only by helicopter or boat, their community remains isolated and relatively untouched by the world.  Despite the hard work the life requires, I wonder if they know what a blessing this is?  The film follows several trappers over the span of a year, but focuses mainly on Genady (sp?).  A present-day Henry Thoreau, I enjoyed his philosophizing on his life, his work, and his world.  I also appreciated his gentle reproaches of those whose actions of which he does not approve.  He possesses a tremendous respect for the natural world and all its creatures without the sanctimoniousness of the ""defenders of the environment"" in the Western world.  If you are a lover of dogs, you will appreciate the relationship between the men and their animals.  However, be cautioned that some of the attitudes about where a dog's place is may be different than ours in the West, and Anatoly's views were particularly difficult to synthesize.  Genday assesses this, too, as he treats his dogs as an extension of his family.  To his mind, a man is not a hunter without his dogs.  He needs them as much as they need him.  The film only scratches the surface of family and village life, and I would like to have seen more.  It was difficult to get an appreciable idea of what their daily lives are like, both when the men are in the village during the summer, and away working their hundreds of miles of traplines during the long winters.  The film also lightly touches on the the plight of the indigenous people of that area; not surprisingly, they face the same serious problems and barriers of Western indigenous people.  The taiga is harsh, vast, cold, and incredibly beautiful.  The challenges and rewards are abundant for these Happy People.

If you are not familiar with Werner Herzog, an influential documentary filmmaker, think of the bizarre film with the dwarves.  I call it Little People Gone Wild.  But, the movie is titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Even-Dwarfs-Started-Small/dp/B00003CWHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Even Dwarfs Started Small</a>.

But, this is different, as it is a look into the lives Russian trappers in Siberia, along the Tiaga River, living isolated lives trapping for their livelihood.  One cannot imagine the existence these trappers endure, the hard laborious work, the minus 50 below temperatures.  And, you hear a lot about their companions, the dogs.

This film puts real meaning to ""living off the land"".  It is a community of about 300 villagers, who have no taxes, no government, their own values and traditions.  It is a remarkable look into the four seasons of this village and the hunters.

The narration, done by Herzog, is in English, while subtitles are in white, often making it difficult to read against background of snow.  At times, the dialogue may go fast.

""Happy People: A Year in the Taiga"" is the latest in a series of nature documentaries by Werner Herzog (here with co-direction by Dimitry Vasyokov), this one chronicling life in a Siberian village over a twelve-month period. Bakhta is located alongside the Yenisei River in the Taiga Forest, and the inhabitants there have been eking out an existence under some pretty challenging conditions for centuries now (this is Siberia, after all). We watch as they make preparations for trapping, build cabins in the wilderness, fashion out canoes from old tree trunks, fish in the river, fend off bears and mosquitoes, and store up supplies for the brutal winter to come. For this is life as it is lived in one of the most misbegotten outposts of civilization. As Herzog himself says, these people resemble early Man from a distant ice age. And, yet, as the title implies, the inhabitants of Bakhta are far from unhappy with their lot.

This is reflected most in the many wise and canny observations about the value of hard work and the cyclical nature of life emanating from one of the town's most seasoned  citizens, a sort of rural philosopher who`s been trapping in that area ever since the Communist government dropped him off and left him to fend for himself more than forty years ago. It is his commentary, more than even Herzog's own voiceover narration, that draws the viewer into this strange and unfamiliar world, one that is striking in both its harshness and its stark beauty (the image of a massive river of thawing ice heading swiftly northward during the spring is not one that will be easily forgotten).

This isn't Herzog's most innovative work by a long shot, but if anthropological studies are your preferred fare, this movie will surely fit the bill.

However, a warning may be in order for the hypersensitive viewer: this is NOT a movie that comes with the proviso, ""No animals were harmed in the making of this film.""",1373155200,27,1941,4.799401197604791

We meet our central characters with a much more serious tone than we met Nanook and his family almost one hundred years ago.  Instead of Canada, however, they subside in Siberia with semioccasional modern conveniences (chainsaws and snowmobiles are all that come to mind).  The landscapes sometimes remind me of the bleak Wisconsin winters of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stroszek/dp/B000059PPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stroszek</a>&nbsp;and other times mosquito-infested shots from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grizzly-Man/dp/B007FNZW6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grizzly Man</a>.

No, these are a dying thread of man's survival through the last Ice Age.  You see it in their eyes.  You catch glimpses of what Elizabeth Gilbert saw in Eustace Conway when she wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-American-Man/dp/0142002836/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last American Man</a>.  This is the core of what it means for a man to a man and his dog to do what it takes to not die in conditions that would undoubtedly kill most everyone very quickly.  And their faces!  Their faces show a happy people.  They walk a tightrope between life and death and they do not show fear or disappointment in the world.

This point comes to a climax as Dmitry, our protagonist-trapper, comes to check on one of his trapping sheds late in the winter day, as daylight is slipping away, only to find that a tree has fallen on it and he much now expend thousands of calories-worth of effort to quickly mend the cabin enough to sleep in it that evening.  In just about any other film ever made, had this situation arisen, the character would throw a conniption-fit, try to deal with the situation by raising the drama level of the moment (see the truly terrible&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grey/dp/B005LAIIS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grey)</a>for a fictional example), and that very conflict would draw the viewers in closer (making producers smile with dollar signs).  But in this film, Dmitry sucks it up, does the backbreaking work necessary to survive, and shows us a true (Happy People?) nature to himself.

Other films show similar themes and are worth checking out.  From the aforementioned Nanook of the North (a film where the climax is building an igloo!) to Dick Proenneke&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alone-in-the-Wilderness/dp/B0009PUAFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alone in the Wilderness</a>'s 1968 home films of his survival in Alaska with its patient shots of how he built his tools and home.  Yet there's something more straightforward and honest about Herzog's depiction of how the sable traps are made and checked all winter long.  He shows us how to make skis and make canoes.  The ice is treated as a flexible tool depending on what Dmitry wants to do with it.  At times he's Van Gogh working that river as his palette.  The water, slush, ice, rocks, and other pieces come together to help him paint his way of living.  He does things his own way (shoots pike on the line) and has trained his dog to follow him over 100 miles to the Christmas celebration by running on the ice.

This may be Herzog's most honest and straightforward documentary to date.  Does that mean you'll like it the most?  Probably not.  This is a simple film about simple people.  They are free and Herzog does them justice by letting them be as free as possible as he shows a year of their lives.",1372550400,23,4902,6.405775075987842

4670000,5,B005EWRJGM,"Okay, this is now my favorite Herzog documentary!

Herzog is known for his somewhat droll narrating and uncomplicated, naturalistic cinematography, and he always really seems to get into his unusual subjects. This latest effort of his, following the life of these Siberian hunters and trappers for a year, is great (although the filming was by Russian Dmitry Vasyukov and not Herzog). And these people are incredibly resourceful, tough, and skilled (and hard working!). It's nice to just know people still have such knowledge and have to use it to survive! On the other hand much of the traditional (native) knowledge is disappearing - thanks to the ubiquitous vodka. Its possible to learn a lot from them too, even though mostly its just a glimpse into what life was like for most of us in a pre-industrial world.

It's obvious Herzog really appreciates these independent and resourceful, mostly solitary men in camo and their loyal canine companions - no rules, no bureaucracy, no masters - in the wilds of a natural world.

Such is a life of simple and well earned pleasures.",1367539200,,1078,4.94475138121547

4670002,5,B005EWRJGM,"This documentary takes place in The Taiga Forest eco-region of Eastern Siberia, and as the story opens and various people are interviewed,they all seem to be truly happy although they are all living a hardscrabble existence, and would surely all qualify for government assistance in our country. Yet the men in this community who make their living by trapping [sables primarily] seem to think they have the best of all worlds, in that they are free to choose, work enough to survive and provide for their families, and then enjoy what appears as a cohesive community life with all the others in their small village of approximately 300 people total. The main character Gnady [spelling], a trapper exclaims at the beginning of his interview that no man can ever be considered a true trapper without his dog[s]. He has two hunting dogs at the time of filming, of some mixed lineage, but I would say looked mostly like what you would expect in this hard land - Siberian Huskies.  He praised all of them, including the ones who were now too old to hunt with him and whom he says will eat as well as the working dogs.  He also calls them his pensioners. Like all true dog lovers he brags about their various exploits and expresses how saddened he is by the fact that his best dogs died too young as both his favorite female and male companion were killed by the same bear, which he quickly dispatched but not before it had killed his two companions.

Gnady is also very proud of his own self sufficiency in the forest, showing how he actually built a hut and and a pair of skis. They fell the trees for the hut and skis, with their most modern piece of equipment being a chain saw. But they make their own wooden wedges to split the giant trees into boards, which they cut shape and plane by hand into the final finished skis.

As with all Werner Herzog films the photography is superb, with its desolate yet breathtaking beauty and the terrific underwater scenes showing the Russian Pike in their natural habitat. And credit should be given to Dmitry Vasyukov as co-producer and who was responsible for most of the scenes, but Herzog, as is typical, does all the narration in his distinctive gravelly voice, although you can distinctly hear Gnady telling him the story in Russian.

A wonderful story of a tough existence, and yet as the title says a Happy Group of People.  Highly recommended!",1366848000,37,2389,4.609411764705882
4670003,4,B005EWRJGM,"Werner Herzog has built up a solid reputation as a documetary film maker (in addition to all of the other things he does), including in recent years such great documentaries like Grizzly Man, Encounters at the End of the World, Cave of Forgotten Dreams, and Into the Abyss. A few years ago Herzog also was involved with this documentary as a co-director (and co-writer and co-producer).

""Happy People: A Year in the Taiga"" (2010 release from Germany; 90 min.) brings us a close look at the lives of people in Bakhta, a small village in the Siberian Taiga. We learn there are about 300 people living there, and the documentary focuses on a couple of them, in particular several trappers. As the movie opens, we are in late April and Spring is arriving, a busy time for the locals. The Yenisei River is still completely frozen over at that point. We follow one of the trappers on his rounds in the woods, checking on various traps, and also on his huts. There is no particularly dramatic twist or discovery as you watch the movie unfold, simply the realization that this small community manages to be almost entirely self-sufficient (the only way to reach it is by helicpoter or by boat, when the river isn't frozen). There is one moment of complete absurdity in the movie, when out of nowehere a boat arrives in late summer, carrying a politician and his cheerleaders, vying for votes in an upcoming election. Notes Herzog dryly (as only he can): ""The locals couldn't care less!"".

While the credits state that the movie is co-directed by Dmitry Vasyukov and Werner Herzog, the movie was actually shot by Vasyukov, and Herzog became involved after that. As a further comment, even though this movie is 2 1/2 years old, imagine my surprise when it showed up this past week, unannounced and without any pre-release buzz, at the art-house theatre here in Cincinnati.

8469137,5,B005EWRJGM,"This film documents the life of a small village of 300 people in the Taiga, an extraordinarily isolated region in the heart of Siberia, an area accessible by helicopter and boat only.  The life of the residents is severely restricted by the extreme cold and darkness that are so prevalent much of the year.  But they seem to find happiness in their work, mainly as trappers, and the film follows them for a year as they plunge into deep pine forests and iced over rivers and lakes. And, through extensive interviews, you come to realize that these men are not crazy, that they are actually content without the gaudy trappings of modern life - computers, cell phones, etc.  The scenery is beautiful and the people kind.  My only caveat is the scant attention given to the original inhabitants of this area who have become marginalized by the Russians.  They are decided not happy people and for good reason and it would have lent an air of objectivity to this documentary if their lives were followed more closely given how their culture is on the brink of extinction.",1494028800,2,1067,4.684491978609626
