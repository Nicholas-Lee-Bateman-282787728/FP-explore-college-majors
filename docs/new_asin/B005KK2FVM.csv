8476874,3,B005KK2FVM,"Ok, lets start with the worst one, Broken. Bad acting, bad story, no plot. I've read reviews where ppl said the ending ""shocked"" them. The only shocking element to me was how bad it was. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Welcome to the Jungle seems like it was made by someone who just watched Cannibal Holocaust. Its a complete rip off of a decent classic. These ppl should be ashamed to call themselves filmmakers. One star, & I'm being very generous at that. Rogue isn't a bad movie. I feel as if I've seen it b4. Beefcake is never a bad thing, (michael variant, chris Wentworth) but realistically, no crocodile in the history of the world has ever caught someone, took them into a tomb and saved them for later. If not for the stupidity & unbelievability, this movie would be worth owning. 3 stars. Buy at ur own risk but I'm really sorry I wasted my time.",1361923200,,862,4.327160493827161
