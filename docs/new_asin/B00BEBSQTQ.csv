8566934,5,B00BEBSQTQ,"This is an incredible deal for meat lovers and cooks.... Over four hours of step-by-step teaching from master culinary butcher Cole Ward, plus recipes from Chef Courtney Contos, who shows you what to do with the cuts you'll create.

The DVD is extremely well and professionally shot (it's not one of those ""do-it-yourself"" DVDs), and every element is well-explained and clearly demonstrated.  Anyone who wants to learn how to butcher, or save money on meat, should buy this set.

Interesting and easy to understand... Cole Ward is the real deal.",1399852800,,545,5.033333333333333
8566935,5,B00BEBSQTQ,This is an excellent video course on meat cutting by experienced master butcher Cole Ward. Our family apprenticed with Mr. Ward for 18 months during 2008 to 2010 in preparation for opening our own butcher shop. This DVD set covers pigs (what we're doing) as well as lamb and beef. Highly recommended along with his book which was released in early 2014.,1392422400,,353,4.709677419354839
