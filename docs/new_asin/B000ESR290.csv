8113964,2,B000ESR290,Not very informative. filmed at a convention on the fly. Not a professional looking effort. His books are great. I was expecting a serious discussion but got humorous entertainment.,1396310400,,181,5.275862068965517
8113965,5,B000ESR290,Lon Milo DuQuette has long been recognized as an excellent teacher on the occult topics in this DVD. He uses humor to teach and it works so very well. His song-writing proves he is a modern bard like Tom Leher or the Smothers Brothers. This is a DVD of his class and you can watch it at home if you cannot get to see him on  his lecture circuit. I totally recommend it. Lady Janestra,1190073600,,383,4.1066666666666665
8113966,4,B000ESR290,"Lon Milo DuQuette is indeed a shameless self promoter. This ""film"" was of a very amateur caliber. Now that's been said, I wish to let any student of the arcane arts know, this man knows his stuff. His enthusiasm for the Kabbalah and Tarot is contagious. I never had much need for mathematics in my life and have been awakened by Mr. DuQuette to it's ""numerous"" possibilities. I would consider this film to be an appetizer,leading perhaps to reading and truly savouring one or more of his literary works he can be seen touting in his DVD.",1180310400,,537,4.546391752577319
8113967,5,B000ESR290,"I took a break from some turgid studies of deep daath depths of dripping slime to watch this wonderful dvd-""Tarot, Kabbalah and Oracles: Lon Milo DuQuette Live and Uncensored"" & Lon's wit & humor blew the creepy cobwebs from my head & settled me down in the balance of Higher Consciousness . From the rousing ukulele invocation of Hecate which warmed my heart to the sales pitch-which durn it if it didn't work-[it did-I am working on getting everything in the Lon Corpus]. The rest was Tarot & Qabalah-bypassing many of the conventional areas-while bringing up new or hidden knowledge such as The Justice trump's relationship to the fool & the creation of Universe seen with the 22 trumps & Tarot reading via dice. Fascinating & fun-this romp somehow managed step over the Cosmic Foo-Foo of New Age proportions & avoid the Occultus Hubris that manages to give Occultism a bad name. I liked the fact that Lon raises the Tarot out of the strictly fortune telling game & really does remind all who use the Tarot that it is about Higher Consciousness. Also this is a fine companion to THE CHICKEN QABALAH. In closing I just want to say-thanks Lon for jump starting my neglected Tarot studies!!!",1172534400,,1191,4.730769230769231
8113968,5,B000ESR290,"This is basically a DVD version of Lon's book ""Chicken Qabalah"". He is hilarious and that alone makes it worth it. If you want to know more about the Qabalistic origins of the Tarot this is a good place to start. I call it an infomercial because it is taped at a New Age convention and Lon makes sure you know all his books are for sale.",1170720000,,337,4.044776119402985
