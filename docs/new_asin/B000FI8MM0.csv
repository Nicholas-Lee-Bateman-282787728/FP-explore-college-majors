2566682,5,B000FI8MM0,"Wow!!  Viewing this film was a real kick.  Like another reviewer here I have seen and loved many of the old school gothic style horror films from Universal, Hammer, AIP, AMICUS and many of the early Italian horror films from Mario Bava and others.  Well, I thought that I had seen just about all the genre had to offer and would probably never see anything new from this area of horror film again; for as the saying goes...""they just don't make films like that anymore"".  Fortunately I've been ignorant of Mexican horror cinema all these years.  Oh sure I had heard about films from Mexico that featured masked wrestler heroes fighting vampire devil robots from Mars but I, quite ignorantly, thought that was about it for Mexican horror flicks.  All I can say is I was wrong and am more than glad to admit it.

""The Witch's Mirror"" is a worthy gothic horror film effort that fits quite snugly in among the old Hammer and Universal films.  In fact it borrows quite liberally and shamelessly from many of those old classics.  While watching it I kept seeing elements from all kinds of sources including: ""Rebecca"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Mad Love"", traditional ghost stories, revenge plots, etc.  Now you might think that such a hodge podge could never work well together but director Chano Urueta pulls it together seamlessly, giving those of us who love this kind of thing an hour and a half of thrills and chills.

I'm not good at summarizing plots but here is a quote from the product description: ""A poetic tale of madness and horror from director Chano Urueta. The Witch's Mirror is one of the landmark films of the Mexi-horror genre. A benevolent witch (Isabela Corona) enchants a magic mirror to protect her adopted daughter Elena (Dina de Marco) from her cruel husband (Armando Calvo). When the incantation fails and the girl is murdered, the witch vows revenge using every unholy principle of the supernatural that she can conjure""  This barely does the story justice but to reveal more would, in my opinion, rob you of many of the joys I had of watching this film.  I would just like to comment on how the film positively drips atmosphere.  Director Chano Urueta had an excellent directorial style and he employs the black and white cinematography to good effect.  And while the special effects don't always work when they do they are spot on and will raise a goose pimple or two even among many jaded horror fans.  Also the film has a great music score as well and it reminded me of Bernard Herrmann at times.

In summary this is an excellent gothic period piece thriller and if you are looking for good old fashioned horror thrills you could do a lot worse than ""The Witch's Mirror"".  This would be an excellent film to curl up with by your self or with someone you love on a chill October evening.  So, I say go ahead and purchase it or rent it if you can and settle in for some good creepy fun.",1160611200,20,2901,4.598058252427184
2566683,5,B000FI8MM0,"I vaguely remembered watching this movie as a child, so when I saw it on DVD I had to pick it up.  There is something about black and white movies that never gets old.  The movie is about a surgeon that murders his wife to marry another woman. The womans Godmother is a witch and foresees this, but she is told by the spirits that she can not stop what is already bound to happen.  So she bows to help Elena seek revenge from beyond the grave.  I watched the movie in spanish, but it also comes dubbed in english, and the dubbing is pretty good.  If you are a fan of classic horror cinema, or horror in general, this is one you have got to pick up.  It will be a worthy addition to any horror collection.",1157414400,8,704,4.065217391304348
2566684,5,B000FI8MM0,"This old Mexican horror film has finally been officialy released by CasaNegra. This movie has been restored and the DVD is full of extras including the english dubbed version full commentary and much more.  Great spooky movie full of atomosphere, totally recommended!!!",1157328000,7,269,5.404761904761905
2566685,5,B000FI8MM0,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!

This is Mexican Horror. It's funny, but I've been a wandering fan of horror films all my life, and I'd thought I'd seen just about all the classic horror cinema that was worth watching since I was a kid, Italion Giallo and Zombie films, The Universal Horror cycle, the British Hammer Horror, the AIP cheepies, some of which are absolute gems.  Then suddenly comes along ""The Witch's Mirror"", which I read about on a website that said this was an absolutely wonderful horror film, with a great story, and dripping with atmosphere.  I'd always thought Mexican Horror was supposed to be cheesy and hokey.  But I've got to tell you, except for a few things limited by the budget that this little gem had, there isn't much cheese here, folks.  This is a very well made horror film, and yes it is dark and atmospheric.  It is old world horror, dredged up from folklore and given a classy coming out party.

The story is a simple, yet layered story of revenge.  Take the basic premise of a husband whose tired of his first wife and having an affair with another woman, who by the way doesn't know he's still married, and he decides to kill his wife so he can marry the woman he loves.

Now add in some satanic black magic.  A godmother who is a full-blown powerful witch, who prays to Satan to let her protect her goddaughter (the wife) from the impending murder, only to have the big red cheese say ""No!""  And he absolutely means NO!  So the murder takes place, the witch decides on revenge, which of course satan agrees whole-heartedly with.  In todays shallow scripted horror vehicles, that would be enough. Witch gets horrific revenge-Beautiful, innocent ""other woman"" becomes horribly scared by fire.  The end.

Wait a minute though! The husband is a brilliant surgeon and scientist who views everything scientifically (except himself, apparently) and he comes up with a surgical procedure to graft the skin of dead people onto his wife's face and arms to restore her to her former beauty.  Boom!  Now the witch is really ticked.

The film takes elements from gothic horror and mixes them with the meat-grind medical horror that would not become popular for another whole decade,the 70's, and creates a creepy double-whammy of science and sorcery horror.  From the gothic country mansion, to the basement laboratory of the doctor, to grave robbing and resurrected ghosts, this is a movie that loves its audience, and we love it.  You need to watch the film in its original Spanish with English subtitles, it's much more satisfying than the English Dub soundtrack.  The sound is sharp and clear.  And the picture quality is absolutely AMAZING.  This is a black-and-white horror film that revels in it's medium.  The folks at Casanegra apparently have put a great deal of time restoring this film, as well as the sister release, ""The Curse of the Crying Woman"", which I also purchased, and frankly, from what I've heard, I can't wait to watch it as well.

There are quite a few nice extras here, from an audio commentary by IVTV founder, Frank Coleman, to some nice essay's on the Mexican cult films of director Chano Urueta.

I've found a whole new medium of horror films to explore now, and I can't be happier about it.",1154044800,17,3236,4.713523131672598
2566686,5,B000FI8MM0,"""The Witch's Mirror""  is one of the few horror films I've seen that relies solely on horror to tell it's story. A surgeon murders his wife and his mother-in-law, a practicing witch, plots her revenge. When he remarries, the mother-in-law, now his housekeeper, sets her revenge into action with a host of occult devices at her fingertips. One of these being a huge mirror through which she summons the ghost of her daughter back to haunt the newlywed couple. But this is only part of the story. The new wife's face and hands end up being being accidentally burned and the doctor attempts to restore them through bloody surgeries and skin grafts. But the avenging witch and her ghost daughter aren't through yet. The acting in ""Witch's Mirror"" ranges from wildly overwrought to solemnly sincere and is never boring. The photography is excellent and glorious in b&w and the whole film drips with Gothic atmosphere. There are some wonderfully creepy scenes throughout including a piano playing by itself and scenes of the witch/mother-in-law summoning the powers of darkness to her aid. I loved this film. The DVD print from CasaNegra is immaculate. It's subtitled and there are lots of interesting extras. Not all Mexican horror films were campy and silly. ""The Witch's Mirror"" is a good example of a fine director in control of his subject matter and who intended to tell a horror story as a horror story. Recommended and enjoy.",1153008000,27,1426,4.892561983471074
2566687,5,B000FI8MM0,"Thank you, Casa Negra, for finally releasing great Mexican horror films with the attention they deserve. Gone are the days of these under-appreciated movies being rendered practically unavailable.  I just watched this DVD and was amazed by the sound and video quality (especially considering it's age).  It's great to know these movies can be resurrected, and that such effort is put into the details.

I'm definitely looking forward to future releases.",1149638400,20,453,5.352112676056338

8122829,2,B000FI8MM0,If I had read the reviews first I wouldn't have purchased the movie.  I chose the English audio on the special features but soon into the movie it swtched to Spanish.

8122830,5,B000FI8MM0,"Eduardo is a wealthy doctor. He is bored with his wife Elena  and wants to marry Deborah. Fortunately he lives in a country where poisoning your wife is legal. Fate has decided Elena must die, unable to be saved by her satanic witch godmother and her ancient magic Persian mirror. However, once dead, her spirit can raise havoc in the newlyweds life.

The restoration quality was phenomenally good. Indeed it must have looked better than originally shown. I liked the plot as the film swung to a grave robbing mad scientist genre. The motions of the actors were from the silent era and the soundtrack sounded like it was from the forties. The Satanic witchcraft in the film was similar to what my Santanya worshiping Hispanic grandmother would use. Note the correct use of the six sided star as opposed to the typical five pointed star.

Okay, who keeps an owl in their operating room/lab?

8122832,4,B000FI8MM0,"This Mexican chiller-thriller, with its fantastic full-length, fog-flying, occult-television mirror, was delightful viewing until about half-way, when it veered unexpectedly into a gruesome re-imagining of Georges Franju's French classic ""Eyes Without a Face"" (1959).  Then it gets a bit stomach-churning, with severed hands and the burned face of a formerly beautiful lady.  Dr. Eduardo also seems a bit slipshod, performing surgeries without a mask or gloves.  The admirably good-looking witch godmother is justified in punishing Dr. Eduardo, but is very cruel to his unfortunately scarred second wife.  I got a kick out of the black-magic altar of demonic statues which imperiously talk back to the witch.  It is located in Dr. Eduardo's house in a room he apparently never visits.  Throw in a haunted piano which tortures the guilty, and a meat locker of unwilling female parts donors, and you've got a pretty ripe, well-photographed, b&w Mexi-horror that must have given a lot of rug-rats bad dreams back in the 1960s.",1412035200,4,1023,5.3229813664596275

8122834,4,B000FI8MM0,"I vaguely remember seeing a few Mexican horror films on my local TV channel when I was growing up. The quality of the prints weren't great and, even to an 8 year old, the dubbing was atrocious. This one and a Russian (Soviet) film called THE DAY THE EARTH FROZE stuck with me because they both featured witches. I've always been fascinated by witches in films and books because of the magic powers they posessed. However it had been years since I had seen WITCH'S MIRROR when this Casanegra release came out in 2006. I bought it (along with BLACK PIT OF DR M and CURSE OF THE CRYING WOMAN), watched it, liked it, but didn't watch it again until just recently when I was astonished by everything I found in it. This movie is an old school horror buff's dream come true.

The look of MIRROR is a cross between the shadowy low budget world of the Val Lewton RKO films and the atmospheric Euro Gothic films of Mario Bava and early Jess Franco. Then there's the plot which borrows heavily from the classic French horror film EYES WITHOUT A FACE (LES YEUX SANS VISAGE) where a doctor tries to restore his daughter's disfigured face. In this movie it's the doctor's second wife who is disfigured by the avenging spirit of his first wife (whom he murdered) abetted by her Godmother who is the witch of the title. Throw in a little of FRANKENSTEIN and a lead performance that rivals anything Bela Lugosi did at Monogram and you have the makings of a B movie classic. In fact, MIRROR has everything in it but the kitchen sink

One of the many delights to be had in watching this film is seeing how it just plows right ahead moving from one bizarre plot point to another completely oblivious to its own absurdity. The whole thing only takes 75 minutes and boy does plenty happen in that short length of time. The first wife is statuesque, the second is more conventional, the doctor is insane, and the witch is calm and collected. There's never a dull moment although I found the ending to be disappointing (NO SPOILERS HERE) but you can see for yourself. Unfortunately the Casanegra label disappeared a few years back and now copies of them are increasingly rare and cost a pretty penny although this one isn't too bad. Definitely worth seeking out.",1402531200,2,2239,4.525925925925926

These should appeal to fans of the Universal horror flicks from the 1930's and the Hammer Dracula films from the 1960's with their period atmosphere and gothic lighting.
