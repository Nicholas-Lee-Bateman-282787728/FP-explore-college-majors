2764275,4,B000NC0K9G,"This movie is really a stage play with almost all the action taking place in the confined space of a smalltown store.

2764286,5,B000NC0K9G,"Have looked for this Robert Altman masteerpiece for years!  So glad to have it in the library again.  Watch it for the amazing performances Altman draws out of the cast, especially Cher.  A classic.",1465171200,,198,4.764705882352941

2764288,4,B000NC0K9G,"Although he has written several plays and is well known as a director and manager in regional theatre, Ed Graczyk is best recalled for the play COME BACK TO THE 5 & DIME, JIMMY DEAN, JIMMY DEAN, which he wrote in the mid-1970s and which debuted in 1976 at The Players Theatre in Columbus, Ohio.  Various producers and directors made efforts to take the play to New York, and it did have a brief run there in 1980, but it wasn't until film director Robert Altman became interested in the play that the actors and backers fell into place.

Altman was famous as the director of such landmark films as M*A*S*H* and NASHVILLE; he was also infamous as the director of such horrific flops as POPEYE, and after that fiasco he decided to focus on small budget, art-house projects.  He cast the play with Sandy Dennis (Graczyk has said he wrote the role of Mona with Dennis in mind), Cher (in her first significant film role), Karen Black (who had appeared in Altmans NASHVILLE), Kathy Bates, Marta Heflin, and Sudie Bond, and the play opened on Broadway on 18 February 1982.

According to Graczyk, Altman fiddled with the plays structure and style, and presented the play on an enormous and complicated set in an extremely large housewhich had the effect of killing the plays intimacy.  Reviews were incredibly savage, and only the casts collective starpower kept the play running for its grand total of 52 performances.  Altman had also acquired the film rights, and when the play closed he filmed it with the same cast on a set that duplicated the Broadway stage set.  The resulting film wasvery strange.

5 & DIME is a play and movie that shifts backward and forward in time, moving from the present (a decayed five and dime store with little business in drought-ridden rural Texas in 1975) to the past (the same store in 1955 when rainfall is plentiful and business is good.)  Altman creates the effect with a double set.  The set for the 1955 memory action is built in a mirror image of the set for the 1975 action, and it is actually seen through a large central mirror that goes transparent to show past events.  Its a clever idea, but It has a slightly over-worked quality that becomes a bit wearing as the movie progresses.  And then there is the cast.

On the stage, 5 & DIME had a double cast, with each major character played by two actressesteenagers for 1955 and actresses twenty years older for 1975.  For the film, Altman has the same actresses play both periods, and the result is rather unfortunate.  They simply don't look or sound like sixteen, and whats more they don't try to look or sound sixteen.  It doesnt play well, especially in close up.  The film also has a deliberately grainy look and a distinctly stagey quality.

What ultimately saves 5 & DIME as a movie are the characters.  They appeal to us and we want to know their details and we want to know what happens to them.  Sandy Dennis is memorable, even though she overplays the neurotic edges of her role.  Cher is spotty but strong, and she has several knock-out scenes that show what shell be able to do in future roles (SILKWOOD was just around the corner.)  Karen Black often overplaysher drunk scenes are borderline grotesquebut she is nonetheless remarkably effective as the mysterious Joanne.  Although they are secondary, Kathy Bates, Marta Heflin, and Sudie Bond nail it.

Ultimately, 5 & DIME is an extremely, extremely uneven movie with a Tennessee Williams-like preoccupation with the damaging past that appeals to us in part because it is so uneven.  It leaves us wanting more and wishing we had moreand that desire teeters between good and bad just as the movie does itself.  The DVD comes with an extremely interesting interview with Ed Graczyk, who states plainly what he thought went wrong with the Broadway production and the film.  The whole thing is worth seeing, but you may not want to see it more than once.

2764294,1,B000NC0K9G,"this was the most depressing movie.  I'm a huge Cher fan and enjoyed the lead character in ""Virginia Wolf"" so I thought I'd love this.  I thought it would be interesting to see how they matured since high school and find out about each others' lives, etc but wow, it's just 'mean girls' who grew older into mean women.  Mean, immature, small-minded women.  Kathy Bates is downright vicious and this bunch is supposed to be friends??  Another reviewer said the last scene (credits rolling) of the empty store was to depict the next reunion, which none of them showed up for.  GOOD!",1453680000,,580,4.637254901960785

I waited a long time for this film to be released on dvd, and it didn't disappoint.  In fact, if anything it gets better with every viewing.  The acting is amazing; with special shout-out to Cher and Karen Black.  Both just remarkable.  And that's not to take anything away from any of the other ladies - and Joe - who temporarily inhabit the 5 and dime.  as well as the ghost of James Dean hovering in the background.

In fact, watch Giant after this film.  Great companion watch.",1440892800,,523,4.375

2764304,5,B000NC0K9G,"This is on my of list top ten films of all time.  Not a big fan of Cher but she gives a fantastic, if understated performance in one of Robert Altman's earliest.  And great cast includes Kathy Bates.",1436313600,3,199,4.2105263157894735

2764306,4,B000NC0K9G,"This movie was made in 1982, why did it take me so  long to watch it? To be honest, it's a Sandy Dennis thing. She aslways seems to be the same no matter what (although I did love her in the Out Of Towners) and she is that flaky, whiny type here too. But aside from her....everyone else is spectacular. for having such a small cast (taken from the play) I give total thumbs up. I did figure what happened and still was enthralled by each actress' devotion to their parts. The only male performer is Mark Patton and he is superb even in this high powered company. Always good is Cher and my favorite female? Karen Black....to me hands down, she stole the show. They play a group of James Dean fans who, 20 years after his death, get together to renew the friendships and to remember.",1434672000,4,782,4.283783783783784
2764307,2,B000NC0K9G,"As the song says, ""different strokes for different folks"". I was underwhelmed to say the least. The storyline was not what I was expecting, and although it has a cast full of stars, I found the movie quite boring. The movie is an adaptation of a Broadway play. For me it never left the stage. The acting seems stilted and forced. I gave it 2 stars simply because I didn't finish the entire movie. After waiting an hour to see ""Jimmy Dean"", I gave up and went to bed. Perhaps it gets better, but my instincts say otherwise.",1433980800,,522,4.336734693877551
2764308,5,B000NC0K9G,Such a beautiful movie. Definitely a product of the 80's before HD and Surround Sound. What has upheld the test of time is not those special effects but a more organic and natural talent that movies seem to miss nowadays.,1433548800,,221,4.55

Despite ""Nashville""...an all comprehensive best-of-any-movie-ever-made...this is a most personal film & hits me in my heart more than anything he has ever done.

2764313,5,B000NC0K9G,"I remember first hearing about this movie because it was Cher's first ""serious acting"" gig. I think she hit it out of the park!
All the cast turned in bravura performances in my opinion. I hadn't seen this since I first saw it on whichever cable channel it was released on back then...and I'd forgotten Kathy Bates was in this! I'd come to love her in Misery and other movies so it was a real pleasure to take a trip back in time and see an actress in one of her first major roles.
I'd previously seen Sandy Dennis in Up The Down Staircase and this role was so different from that. She truly showed what an accomplished actress she was. I think at the time it may have been one of the first times Karen Black imprinted herself on my consciousness; I can't recall now whether I saw her in this or Nashville first but again I think it's an amazing performance.
The subject matter may have been a bit ""before its time"" back then; at least for some folks but now I think it's super timely!
It's always good to think about how we should accept others for what they truly are; even if at times it's not what is expected.
Oh yeah I think the set decorator deserves applause for a great job getting the feel of the period spot on!",1431216000,8,1222,4.226495726495727

2764317,2,B000NC0K9G,"Technically inferior transfer and should be redone.  Unstable color definition.  Perhaps 16 mm format is the problem???  Broadway play was much better even with occasional misreadings of script that occur in live performances.  Each media has it's unique characteristics,i.e advantages inherent of that medium.  This is an illustration of why simply filming a stage play doesn't really work as a movie.  Altman should have just done a different production for film.  Sorry folks.",1428537600,,479,5.47945205479452
2764318,5,B000NC0K9G,"I remember seeing this movie many moons ago and remembered that it was a very bizarre experience.  When I saw it was on DVD, I picked up a copy and wow, the performances are a knock out.  I consider this more of a theatre-piece film than a movie only because of the dialogue that is really finely crafted.  I never saw a stage production of it.  But if ever I do, I  hope it measures up to this fine work.  Robert Altman is brilliant as director.",1426464000,4,446,4.127906976744186

2764322,5,B000NC0K9G,"Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean is an incredible film. It is based on the Broadway play of the same title, and includes the original stellar cast from the stage production. Sand Dennis is great in her portrayal of the mysterious Mona, as well as the great late Karen Black as Joanne, a woman with an unbelievable secret. As a Cher fan, I had to own this film. Cher shines in her role as Sissy. She is raw, real, and emotional in Jimmy Dean, and it comes as no surprise that she was nominated for a Golden Globe for the part. An excellent cast with stellar performances (including a very young Kathy Bates), this film is definitely a cinematic classic. The DVD includes a bonus interview with the playwright, which is interesting as you learn the back-story of the play and how it progressed into Broadway and then film.",1421971200,8,841,4.467532467532467

I didn't recall whether I saw this film version when it was released, so I was looking forward to kicking back for the evening to watch this DVD. My entertainment components I would consider to be on the high end with an Oppo Blu-ray, 1080p res. HD screen and a brand new 7.1 sound system. I put the disc in and within a few minutes my smile disappeared and I was NOT happy.

The video transfer was Absolutely AWFUL. Probably one of the worst I've seen in recent years. The film was grainy and had frequent color shifting throughout (well, 2/3 of it, because I just had to turn it off at that point). To me it looked like it was copied from a copy of a bootleg VHS tape and then digitized to DVD. With so much technology now available to clean up films to produce pristine digital copies, the version that's being sold is unacceptable, especially at the higher price level it's listed as.

My recommendation is to pass on buying this version and wait until it hits the bargain bin for $9.95 or preferably less or until a better transfer becomes available.",1416355200,35,1209,4.345132743362832

This is like a filmed play in many ways, with the same actors mostly playing themselves both as teenagers and as adults.  The use of mirrors, of music, and the setting are really beautiful.  I adore this film!",1499126400,,294,4.596153846153846
