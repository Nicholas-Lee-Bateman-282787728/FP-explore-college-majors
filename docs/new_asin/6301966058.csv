8246870,5,6301966058,"I purchased this video for my kids when they were 5 or so; they are now 10 and still love to watch it! Energetic, colorful, educational; there aren't enough superlatives to describe this compassionate video. Performances by ""differently -abled"" people are included, and they are wonderful, inspired performances. Great new songs helped my kids to brush their teeth, appreciate different skin colors, learn to recycle... the list goes on and on. Its a full 50 minutes long, and believe me, the time flies by. I would definately recommend this video for any parent and child!",1014940800,2,573,5.042105263157895
