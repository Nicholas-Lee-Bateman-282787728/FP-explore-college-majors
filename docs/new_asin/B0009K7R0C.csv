The narrator has a delightfully witchy voice and makes this educational video very entertaining as well as informative. ""Visit vampires in a bat cave, watch a black widow poison her prey, and dodge the deadly drool of the largest lizard in the world, the Komodo dragon. There are lots of horribly good songs and fun along the way...""",1143331200,,454,4.675

8062230,5,B0009K7R0C,"I actually bought this for my son who LOVED watching this on Netflix but since they no longer have it available for streaming I bought it for him to watch whenever he wants. It is a really good show for anyone who likes all things creepy and crawly which my son does for sure!!  I just wish it were longer than 30 minutes, or the price was lower because the price is a bit high for me normally but since he loved to watch it so much, I bought it anyway.",1391472000,,453,3.978021978021978

8062235,1,B0009K7R0C,"It is quite obviously a documentary about creepy animals. It is geared for kids, but some of the footage is a little... extreme. It has real footage of vampire bats drinking blood, baby spiders hatching, and a snake eating a rat. To make the already horrible documentary even worse, it is supposed to be narrarated by a cat. Even little kids should be able to figure out that the cat is not doing the talking. It simply walks around and does it's own stuff. Could the show get any worse? Yes. The cat ""sings"" in it. The show includes 3 poorly composed tunes with horrible lyrics that make me want to scream (I guess that is their intention, either by making people scream by showing some animals or by playing such awful songs that kids have no choice). Do not waste 5 dollars on this junk.",1343433600,,790,4.417808219178082
