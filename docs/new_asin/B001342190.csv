It truly showed the world the heart of a passionate, moral, and strong man in Pres. Bush. Bret Baier was an excellent match for the interview, he is direct yet professional, friendly yet sincere in his effort to ask the hard questions. Many Americans say that Pres Bush does not express himself well, I disagree and say that this special shows exactly how much Pres Bush loves his job, loves America, will fight for it , preserve us and represent us with all of his heart, mind, body, and soul. This DVD is so worth it, and I will miss the President and pray the history books portray him for the true President he tried to be.",1201392000,49,735,4.451851851851852
3101903,5,B001342190,"This was a fair and balanced interview...although you haters will not agree. The man is solid in his theology and his ideaology...if you will listen to him, you will be amazed that the man the pop media has painted as a criminal imbecile is, rather, a principled man who actually applies those principles to what he does for a living.

Agree or disagree with his policies, you must agree he is honorable. Hey! Wait! The haters are mumbling something about oil...and being so easily misled ...how 'bout telling us, haters, about how much oil we've harvested in the last few years off our boys' sacrifices? (For the record, my boy's on his second tour...I solicit your prayers)

Do you know what your principles are? And do you actually apply them in your daily life?

This was an excellent interview. Honest men and women will buy it, keep it, and go over it with their kids.

3101917,5,B001342190,"I just watched this show on Fox and enjoyed it so much, I went right to the computer to order the DVD. When President Bush was asked direct questions he answered them directly. How refreshing in our politically correct, politically polarized country where so many politicians give vague non-answers. The film showed him to be a true leader with a core set of principals that have guided him through the terrible trials he's faced during his years in office. And though the world has often laughed at, made fun of, and impugned this man, he's held to his values. The film showed us again the deeply thoughtful and intelligent man that the media has worked hard to marginalize. Loved the footage at the ranch. I pray that the next President will bring the same level of decency and honor to the office.",1201910400,14,800,4.640845070422535

Fox News has long been a leader in news and information programming and wonderful special's such as this masterwork. This news special DVD by great measure frees the timid who may pause before considering US preemptive invasion of foreign nations to liberate the ten's of thousands of their lives and natural resources. Fox News shows the viewers that their decorated Silver Star, Purple Heart, Vietnam War Veteran George W.

3101919,5,B001342190,"Over the last 7 years my own family members, each and every family in my social sphere, and including the clerks and working class public service representatives, experienced increasing financial strain and losses. The actual quality of our lives has substantially diminished. Americans have developed an overwhelming mistrust of our government officials. Mr. Bush has managed to tarnish our countries image, and credibility throughout the World since taking office. Bret Baier did a fine job of putting the President at ease. He did not stammer and stare dumbfounded at the camera, or make pathetic attempts to remember what he was saying.
I did how ever, find it rather sadly amusing when he likened his self to ""Honest"" Abe Lincoln. Aspiring to be the kind of man and President that President Lincoln was, certainly would have been a good thing.
Comparing the Civil War to what he has affected throughout the Middle East during his War on Terror- that was ridicules. His ""Team"" of speech writers must be delirious. The only obvious input Mr. Bush likely contributed to his speeches would be the omission of the actual findings and true facts presented to him when he elected to invent and manipulate the truth. The Presidents commitments of integrity sincerity and devotion to the American people seem at best, distorted. The ""visit"" to the ranch interview could have easily have been titled ""Lie till you Die""",1201478400,16,1413,5.042735042735043
3101920,5,B001342190,"I loved this special with Bret Baier from Fox.  The sticking point was how President Bush related to Abraham Lincoln and the Gettysburg Address.  As with Lincoln, George W. Bush's ackomplishments won't be realized for some time.  This special illustrates the Presidents passion for what he truly believes in and most of all his forward thinking for the security of this country and for freedom and democracy for all nations, globally.  I recommend it to all and mostly to those that have doubted him.  One must respect, even if you disagree with him, the fact that he has never swayed from what he truly believes is best for the people he is leading.  He is a true leader and will, in the days ahead, be remembered that way.  I feel this very candid special gives a personal insight into who he is.  Check it out and God bless!",1201478400,16,827,4.54054054054054
3101921,5,B001342190,"I enjoyed Fighting to the Finish a lot. It was interesting to see Bush behind the scenes at the oval office and his ranch. I've read the other reviews and many say that Fox News is biased. Well, if Fox News is biased than what does that make all the other tv networks? The answer is that the other Networks are much more biased than Fox. While Fox is far from pefect, it remains the best of the biased bunch. Some reviewers have said he is stupid (which is a red flag that they cannot be taken seriously, since we all know you don't become President of the United States being stupid; not to mention he graduated from Yale and Harvard, has been around politics his whole life, and works with a full team of extremely intelligent advisors) Some reviewers say he is Evil (which is a red flag that they cannot be taken seriously since anyone with common sense knows that Bush is not even remotely close to the true meaning of Evil, unless of course you think America is inheritly Evil with it's imperialistic ways of War and Commerce, which in turn is another red flag you cannot be taken seriously since we all know America is not imperialistic and if we were imperialistic we would have taken over the world by now; unless of course you define imperialism as the spread of social and economic freedom- then you may have a point). I have to admit myself, although I have always liked Bush, that even I started to think somewhat negatively of him with the constant talk of our Stupid, Evil, Oil-loving, War-driven, racist, arrogant, big-business, monster of a President. This program reminded me again why Bush draws the criticism he gets. In the program Bush tells how he thinks Washington is a nasty town and how America needs to lead the world in peace. He tells how the President should stick to his fundamental beliefs and lead the world with that vision. He tells us that we shouldn't always do what is popular around the world. Bush has never tried to do the popular choice in his foriegn policy and this is why he is hated so much. I thought Fighting For the Finish was a great program, not only because I fail to believe Bush loves War, controls the weather, and is stupid, but because it's always interesting to go behind the scenes of the most powerful man in the world. So Bush is not very articulate. Well, he is not an author of singer or teacher, he is a leader. And I was always under the impression that a leader was someone who leads, not someone who articulates. Good program (even if you do think Bush mastermined 9-11, unleashed Katrina from the Sea Gods, is profitting from Oil from his war, Went to war to finish his Daddy's war, loves only the wealthy white man, only got through school because of his family name, has made the whole world hate America, and is continuing to let American boys die in Iraq because he is stupid and arrogant).",1201478400,20,2861,4.472275334608031

I have stood with him from day one in office, and truely believe he will be regarded as a tireless fighter who fought to protect this nation from aggressive evil terrorist. They wouldn't think twice about cutting the heart of this nation out and they surly won't back down.

President Bush holds the most difficult position in the world and he has done it for seven years with honor and integrity!  So much more honor and integrity than we saw in the eight years prior to his presidency!  He has been faced with the most difficult decisions that no one else in office in recent times has even come close to experiencing and he has done an excellent job in doing so.

Clearly Bush is going down. And granted, he is an inarticulate guy, and he's inarticulate in this show. This piece was aired on Fox News which just goes to prove it's a fluff piece to try to make Bush look good. If you're of the 10% of the US population who somehow believes Bush has done a fine job, mainly because you watch Fox News Channel, then you'll probably LOVE this DVD because it investigates nothing. Instead it attempts to inflate a deflated man in the eve of his final term. And it fails.",1201392000,24,675,4.408

He is a warm, considerate person and it showed through in the package. I wish every American would watch this... some might even change their minds about him.

We loved seeing the ranch and the gorgeous canyons on the property. There was a time that we would hike, picnic and my son would hunt in some of the same areas of the property when the Engelbrecht family lived there. It was nice to see how much the President loves the ranch and is so concerned with its conservation. We had to order a few copies... it will make a lovely keepsake!

And though the world has often laughed at, made fun of, and impugned this man, he's held to his values.

Mr. Bush has managed to tarnish our countries image, and credibility throughout the World since taking office. Bret Baier did a fine job of putting the President at ease. He did not stammer and stare dumbfounded at the camera, or make pathetic attempts to remember what he was saying.
I did how ever, find it rather sadly amusing when he likened his self to ""Honest"" Abe Lincoln. Aspiring to be the kind of man and President that President Lincoln was, certainly would have been a good thing.
Comparing the Civil War to what he has affected throughout the Middle East during his War on Terror- that was ridicules. His ""Team"" of speech writers must be delirious. The only obvious input Mr. Bush likely contributed to his speeches would be the omission of the actual findings and true facts presented to him when he elected to invent and manipulate the truth.

3336418,5,B001342190,"I enjoyed Fighting to the Finish a lot. It was interesting to see Bush behind the scenes at the oval office and his ranch. I've read the other reviews and many say that Fox News is biased. Well, if Fox News is biased than what does that make all the other tv networks? The answer is that the other Networks are much more biased than Fox. While Fox is far from pefect, it remains the best of the biased bunch. Some reviewers have said he is stupid (which is a red flag that they cannot be taken seriously, since we all know you don't become President of the United States being stupid; not to mention he graduated from Yale and Harvard, has been around politics his whole life, and works with a full team of extremely intelligent advisors) Some reviewers say he is Evil (which is a red flag that they cannot be taken seriously since anyone with common sense knows that Bush is not even remotely close to the true meaning of Evil, unless of course you think America is inheritly Evil with it's imperialistic ways of War and Commerce, which in turn is another red flag you cannot be taken seriously since we all know America is not imperialistic and if we were imperialistic we would have taken over the world by now; unless of course you define imperialism as the spread of social and economic freedom- then you may have a point). I have to admit myself, although I have always liked Bush, that even I started to think somewhat negatively of him with the constant talk of our Stupid, Evil, Oil-loving, War-driven, racist, arrogant, big-business, monster of a President. This program reminded me again why Bush draws the criticism he gets. In the program Bush tells how he thinks Washington is a nasty town and how America needs to lead the world in peace. He tells how the President should stick to his fundamental beliefs and lead the world with that vision. He tells us that we shouldn't always do what is popular around the world. Bush has never tried to do the popular choice in his foriegn policy and this is why he is hated so much. I thought Fighting For the Finish was a great program, not only because I fail to believe Bush loves War, controls the weather, and is stupid, but because it's always interesting to go behind the scenes of the most powerful man in the world. So Bush is not very articulate. Well, he is not an author of singer or teacher, he is a leader. And I was always under the impression that a leader was someone who leads, not someone who articulates. Good program (even if you do think Bush mastermined 9-11, unleashed Katrina from the Sea Gods, is profitting from Oil from his war, Went to war to finish his Daddy's war, loves only the wealthy white man, only got through school because of his family name, has made the whole world hate America, and is continuing to let American boys die in Iraq because he is stupid and arrogant).",1201478400,20,2861,4.472275334608031

There was a time that we would hike, picnic and my son would hunt in some of the same areas of the property when the Engelbrecht family lived there.

You criticize him and call him stupid...but how stupid can he be when, after 9/11, the Greatest Threat To America Ever, he has not only essentially Won the Fight, but done it while taking MORE VACATION DAYS THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. Amen.

That to me is a sign of Genius. Other presidents might have spent long days and nights studying the Enemy and figuring out how to efficiently dispatch the invisible and perhaps undefeatable Terrorists we have created, sorry, engaged in Iraq and elsewhere. But not Bush! He has enjoyed many many Months, in fact about a YEAR AND A HALF, of vacation time at this ranch in Crawford, his Daddy's place in Maine, and many other fine vacation retreats around the world.

But he is NOT A RETREATER.

He is a Decider.

And Decisions take Time.

Just compare:

Carter, 79 days in 4 years (what a slacker, worst president ever)

Reagan, 436 days in 8 years. Not bad. Doesn't include naps on the job.

G.H. ""Daddy"" Bush, 543 days in 4 years! A tough record to top. But he had a War too. Very tiring , these Wars.

Clinton, 152 days in 8 years. Another slacker. But very little war and a good economy, so who needs rest?

G W Bush, carrying on the Proud Family Tradition, has spent over 450 days at his ranch alone, and almost 100 elsewhere while Not Working (though clearly his mind is always figuring out how to make this a better world).

Winner! WINNER!!

Yes he's beaten Daddy's record, but not per day in office.

Some Fatherly achievements are hard to match.

All this from W while Fighting the Good Fight and Winning the War on Terror. Not to mention that our economy is strongly rebounding these days, as is our noble stock market, despite or even because of our trillions of tax dollars that got sent to Halliburton, Iraq and Afghanistan, in that order. And our environment has never looked better. And did he step up to the Katrina plate or what? Along with his buddies who got all the contracts to ""clean it up"" (speaking of Cheneyburton). Boy, they're doing a great job. The levees will be fixed in less than 10 years! And by fixed I mean back to where they were before Katrina. Very effective, yes sir, like all W efforts.

George W Bush loves America and Americans and our soldiers SO much that he can save us all even while taking MORE VACATION DAYS THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY while we fight ""the toughest war America has ever been in"" (his words). If that is not THE GREATEST PRESIDENT OF THEM ALL, then what/who is?

So stop picking on W. You might wake him from his restful Vacation Time. What American leader has ever needed, or deserved it more?
Fighting To The Finish indeed!

And expect even more when he wakes up from his Nap and shoots some deer at the Ranch. Then those Terrorists will SUFFER!!

We need more dvds like this that show all the Miracles Bush has performed while on Vacation. And how about Fox News, those Defenders of the American Way! Not bad for an Australian-owned corporation. They sure have done a job on America. How much stronger and happier and healthier and more loving a nation we are since Fox and Bush have been doing their thang.

Fight To The Finish. Nap Until 2009. Whatever. The point is, he's doing all this Good Work while taking More Time Off than any president ever.

He's a Fighter!

He's a Decider!

In fact, he's Decided to Fight the Urge to not take another Holiday this month.

But don't wake him until it's all over.
