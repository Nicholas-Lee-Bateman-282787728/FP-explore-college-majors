3895951,5,B002BW7A2Q,"David Garrett is the most exciting artist I've heard since the Beatles.  I caught his ""Live in Berlin"" concert on PBS and was also riveted.  I ordered the DVD and the CD and ordered more to give as gifts (very well received).  I was able to catch his concert in Portland Oregon last February.  Very exciting.  I felt like a teeny bopper at a rock concert.  His compositions are exciting and beautiful and well done.  Watching him perform and hearing it together is amazing.  He clearly loves what he is doing, it is a pleasure to watch him. Extremely talented, handsome and a very nice young man. Go to his website for updates on new CD's & DVD's and check out his 2011 tour schedule.  You don't want to miss a chance to see him perform. [...]",1280448000,5,743,4.364963503649635
3895952,5,B002BW7A2Q,"I saw his show in Atlanta 10/14/09 I enjoyed so much that I followed him to Anaheim,CA 2/26/2010, and rounded up my in-laws all nine of us to his show. Everyone just wow by his performance. I'm so hooked!! I followed him to Charlotte, NC 4/1 for my 64 birthday treat, you can say I'm his granny groupie:)Again, I rounded up my sister in-law and nephews all five of us go see the show - what can I say? he is just wonderful performer. This Live in Berlin even better to watch and listen to..better yet, I bought it in the show for $25! best ""investment"" for the enjoyment.",1270684800,7,571,4.247706422018348
3895953,5,B002BW7A2Q,"I did not know David Garrett existed until I saw him on PBS in December 2009. I was immediately enthralled by the music but also by his charisma. If you check out the interviews on YouTube you will quickly understand that he doesn't like the ""charisma"" part -- he wants it to be about the music -- and it is, but a lot of the beauty of the presentation is David himself. He is juxtaposition in the flesh -- steel wool beard, long eye lashes, dimples and a smile that would cut through steel. The music is great, too! Innovative, toe-tapping and somehow very philosophical and deep while at the same time beautiful and exciting. It is an interesting mix of historical, sexy, classical and rock all at once -- simultaneously.
For those of you who want the DVD of ""Live in Berlin"" and are frustrated that it is no longer available through the usual markets, try PBS. I believe they have exclusive rights to this now (though I am not 100% sure). PBS is using this as a fund-raiser, so to buy it through them you have to make a ""donation"" which is what I did, but worth every penny. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did and am still. He is very special -- one of the world's bright lights. I hope he stays that way.",1264032000,14,1212,4.251082251082251
3895954,3,B002BW7A2Q,"I have checked for this DVD since viewing it in Nov. on PBS.
Amazon said at the time it was no longer available, mfgr not producing, whatever. I was really disappointed. I even chewed out my PBS station during its pledge drive for offering a DVD that was not being mfgd anymore! Then I bought the CD David Garrett and found almost all the cuts were taken from the PBS DVD. Now I see there is what, one copy of the DVD for $129 dollars?????? What's up with this? The CD and DVD have some different tracks, but for the most part, the CD plays like the DVD.
The TV programme was wonderful; Garrett is like no one you will ever see/hear on the violin except perhaps his teacher, Isak Perlman. Garrett will certainly pick up some younger fans here. He is energetic, dressed down (depite the cover), and plays the violin like some rock and roll bass guitarists.
My advice: skip this DVD, at least until the price comes down, and pick up three or four of his other CDs. I don't particularly like Free, it wasn't produced very well, but the earlier ones on DeutcheGrammaphone are wonderful. I also just purchased the Romance CD.
I gave this item three stars, not because of what's in the package, but because it is too expensive, especially since, at this writing, you can't get it anyway.",1261699200,21,1281,4.45531914893617
3895955,5,B002BW7A2Q,"I would rate David Garrett's performance in the Live in Berlin Concert as a combination of virtuosity and simplicity.  I am glad to have found out about this artist and look forward to getting a copy of the DVD.  I rate it a five stars out of five.

Much success and God's blessings to you, Mr. Garrett.

3895956,5,B002BW7A2Q,"I have seen this twice on PBS.  They use it in their pledge drive, which is annoying because you do not want this music to stop while public television tries to get into your wallet. Here we have an all new approach to music.  When Josh Groban hit the airwaves, I think someone decided to call him symphonic pop.  I don't think anyone will be able to pin down what David Garrett performs.  In the US, we are late comers to his talent. You can surf the net and read the news from across the world and David Garrett makes headlines. I don't know that anyone else could have me put on the ""Summer"" (Vivaldi) track and turn the volume way up. Just about everyone has heard ""Dueling Banjos"" (the Deliverance soundtrack), but they have never heard it like this.  Everyone I've played it for, breaks into a big grin because it is such a fun sound. He also did justice to Michael Jackson in his rendition of ""Smooth Criminal"".

In Europe and Asia, this guy fills stadiums because his sound is powerful, beautiful, and enchanting.  Who else has ever considered composing an album with everything from Vivaldi to Metallica?  He has a website and I encourage folks to look it up.  On the website you have the option for International or US and a media player will let you listen to this astounding young man.

It would be so very helpful if Amazon might tell us WHEN will this DVD be available?",1249603200,44,1383,4.430830039525691
3895957,5,B002BW7A2Q,"David Garrett is a charismatic, handsome young man (he paid his bills while studying at the prestigious Julliard school with modeling jobs), and who has a tremendous violin technique and his own unique blend of classics and rock/pop music. Dressed in casual chic baggy jeans and a tailored black jacket, blond hair back in a pony tail, his main attraction is the joy he so obviously has while playing for his rapt audience. Raised in Germany but now based in New York City, David has played the violin since he was 4 years old, and displays amazing assurance in his performance style.

Among the numbers performed on this ""Live in Berlin"" PBS DVD, are the following:

1: ""He's a Pirate""
2: ""Winter"" and ""Summer"" from Vivaldi's 4 ""Four Seasons""
3: ""Smooth Criminal""
4: ""Who Wants to Live Forever""
5: ""Rock Prelude"" (David's tribute to the 70's and 80's)
6: ""Hungarian Dance""
7: ""Ain't No Sunshine""
8: ""Flight of the Bumblebee""
9: ""Somewhere""
10: ""Csardas""
11: ""Dueling Strings""
12: ""Nothing Else Matters""
13: ""Zorba's Dance""
14: Chelsea Girl"" (composed by David)
15: ""Volare""
16: ""Thunderstruck""",1244332800,8,1094,4.940217391304348

8362051,5,B002BW7A2Q,"I wish David Garrett would become as popular in the states as he is in the rest of the world!!  He's really an excellent violinist and could give young people  (or young at heart) a new appreciation for the violin and orchestral music. He actually doesn't play all classical music...he plays modern songs, too...but whatever he plays...it's amazing!!  I recommend a DVD over a CD, though, because he's also nice to look at!",1447891200,4,423,4.767123287671233

I love how David Garrett plays and the way he can captivate his audience just by his expressions while he plays his violin.  The orchestra is awesome along with David's band.  You can always count on a wonderful performance by David Garrett in all of his DVDs and watching him live in concert.
Thanks for bringing yourself and the violin into my life.",1394236800,,423,4.397435897435898
8362055,3,B002BW7A2Q,"This looks like it was a great performance with a variety of songs  that David Garrett plays skillfully, passionately and joyfully. His masterful performances are marred by the choppy nature of this DVD. It would be more enjoyable to have each of the songs blend smoothly into the next rather than having it abruptly end before going on to the next song. he does a great job with ""Smooth Criminal,"" ""Flight of the Bumblebee/Nirvana"" mashup, and Queen's ""Who Wants to Live Forever."" The 3-star rating is for the disappointing production value of the DVD; David Garrett is a 5-Star performer in my book.",1368835200,3,601,4.834951456310679
