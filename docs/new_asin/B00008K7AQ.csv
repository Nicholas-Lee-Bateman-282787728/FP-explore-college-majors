1848985,3,B00008K7AQ,"First of all, I saw this movie when it aired on television and it was a two part mini-series. The cast is first rate with Ronny Cox and Marg Helgenberger as the Ramseys. Jane Powell as the dance teacher. Ann-Margret as Nedra Volz, Patsy's mom and JonBenet's grandmother. Kris Kristofferson is perfect playing Lou Smit, the detective who believes that a stranger did it and not the Ramseys. There were lots of interesting performances like Sean Whalin playing the tabloid reporter, Jeff Shapiro, who would have converted to Episcopalian in order to get his story. There are others like Anne Sward who played the neighbor. The two part mini-series was disturbing at times and realistically tried to bring the true events of the situation to life. Sadly, the crime has never been solved and never will be. Patsy is gone. She died of cancer. The Grand Jury has pretty much cleared the Ramseys because there wasn't enough evidence to go to trial in the first place.",1179532800,,960,4.789156626506024
1848986,4,B00008K7AQ,"Who killed JonBenet Ramsey? A lot of folks would say, ""Who cares?"" I understand that point of view since I'm the sort of person who spends a lot of time complaining about the media covering this stuff in lieu of important issues. But I'm also the sort of individual who likes to read about true crime. The JonBenet Ramsey case, still unsolved over ten years later, ranks as one of the most gripping murder mysteries in recent memory. Yes, the media went nuts over the murder of this little girl in Boulder, Colorado all those years ago. Yes, the media spent an inordinate amount of time covering the most lurid details of both the murder and the Ramsey family. Yes, the media invented ""facts"" out of thin air in their rush to pass judgment and their clamor for ratings. None of that takes away from the sheer strangeness, the utter creepiness, of the crime in question. The murder of JonBenet Ramsey is one of the weirdest, scariest crimes I've ever read about. Even when you jettison the media hysteria, what's left chills the blood. Did the parents commit the crime, or did an intruder perpetrate the dastardly deed? We may never know.

I decided to watch the made for television movie ""Perfect Murder, Perfect Town"" after reading Lawrence Schiller's book of the same name. In fact, Schiller directed this film version of his comprehensive examination of all aspects of the Ramsey crime. The movie starts before the murder, around Christmas 1996, as we see the Ramsey clan--mother Patsy (Marg Helgenberger), father John (Ronny Cox), son Burke (Tyler Sharp), and JonBenet (Dyanne Iandoli)--out celebrating in true holiday spirit. You know the routine: picking up presents, window shopping, etc. We even see John running across the street after the kids hit the sack in order to pick up a bicycle he bought as a present. Then the nightmare begins when Patsy wakes up the day after Christmas and finds the infamous ransom note spread across the bottom steps of the staircase. The movie moves into an almost documentary style production as the police, friends of the family, and assorted other people arrive at the Ramsey house to await the phone call from the kidnappers. The film makes it abundantly clear that the Boulder police department failed to secure the crime scene, a fatal mistake helped fuel the media circus that was soon to follow.

It's tough to watch the recreation of the discovery of the little girl's body and the hysterics that followed. Very tough. Just as agonizing to watch is the rest of the movie, which focuses on the increasing tensions between the Ramsey family, the Boulder cops, and the District Attorney's office. As the investigation ramps up, as the cops start conducting interviews with family friends, troubling questions arise. Even more troubling is the discovery that John and Patsy Ramsey have ""lawyered up,"" and now refuse to answer the investigator's questions. Not good. Then we've got the tension between the cops and district attorney Alex Hunter (Ken Howard) and his underling Peter Hofstrom (Peter Friedman). They refuse to go forward with the case until the cops collect enough evidence to guarantee a conviction. Detective Steve Thomas (Scott Cohen) thinks he can prove the Ramseys' guilt. The city prosecutors disagree. Gridlock ensues as the media swarm hits a fever pitch. Reporters don't help the situation any, as witnessed by the activities of tabloid journalist Jeff Shapiro (Sean Whalen). Yet ANOTHER factor complicating the case involves the Ramsey family hiring their own investigator, former police detective Lou Smit (Kris Kristofferson), to come up with a theory that is at odds with the Boulder Police Department.

""Perfect Murder, Perfect Town"" does not offer us a definitive answer as to who killed JonBenet. We get two scenarios, the intruder theory and the RDI (Ramseys did it) theory, and we have to choose which one we think is the most viable. Good luck. As the film shows, convincing evidence exists to bolster both theories. I didn't really expect the movie to add something more to the JonBenet story, though. It's essentially a faithful adaptation of the book, which means the focus of the story quickly shifts from ""whodunit"" to the complex dynamics between the interested parties. The murder soon drops into the background as politics and media madness take center stage. When I reviewed Schiller's book, I think I wrote something about how the author used the story of a gruesome murder in a well-to-do family as a means of telling a larger truth about society. If I didn't, I will now. ""Perfect Murder, Perfect Town"" the book and the movie show us how an out of control media can seriously undermine not only a murder investigation but our institutions as well. It becomes quickly apparent that the media, as much if not more so than the inept investigation at the crime scene, helped undermine the search to find JonBenet's killer.

I liked the film version of ""Perfect Murder, Perfect Town"". Schiller shot on Boulder locations as much as possible, and the number of recognizable faces here boggles the mind. Aside from those actors and actresses mentioned above, we also see Ann-Margret in the role of Patsy's mother Nedra, Jane Powell as JonBenet's dance instructor, and John Heard as Detective Larry Mason. Everyone associated with the production does a bang up job with his or her parts, although I think Marg Helgenberger often descended into pure camp as the histrionic Patsy Ramsey. Then again, anyone who's read about or seen the late Patsy Ramsey in action has to conclude that the woman came across as an over the top personality, so maybe Helgenberger's performance was spot on. I suggest that everyone interested in the case run out and give ""Perfect Murder, Perfect Town"" a watch.",1179446400,5,5770,4.945360824742268
1848987,4,B00008K7AQ,"I always believed the Ramseys killed their daughter so I wanted to watch the movie to see how it was portrayed.  The movie convinced me even more.  It was very good, but there is one part that really bothered me....where they brought the little girl out of the basement after she had been murdered and she was stiff as a board.  I know that is how it was in real life, but that scene bothered me for days.  My daughter was about her age when I watched the movie so I  know that is why it tore me up so bad.  The actors in the movie did very well and the movie was well written.",1143417600,4,577,3.973913043478261
1848988,4,B00008K7AQ,"The acting was great, ( I LOVE Kris Kristofferson) the story was broken down and told very well.

1848989,4,B00008K7AQ,"Very well made and informative film, but it still contained stuff that the tabloids made up. For example, the rubbish talk made, of the room where she was found. When will people stop saying that it was at the end of some kind of maze and that it could only have been found by someone who knew the layout of the house? The fact is, once you get to the bottom of the stairs to the basement, the door to the room in question, is virtually 20 feet in front of you!",1128556800,6,461,4.021739130434782
1848990,5,B00008K7AQ,"I currently own the movie ""Perfect murder,Perfect town"" and I have to say one thing,I only seen it once or twice before buying the movie and it thaught the graphics and the 'emotion' behind the filming was absolutely extrordinarily perfect! Marg Helenberger (CSI:Crime scene Investigation) who plays Patsy Ramsey,Showed a lot of emotional and strong feelings that Patsy Ramsey herself had shown in real life. If you rent/buy this on DVD I reccomend after watching it,when planning watching it a second time,you should listen to the directors commentary. It explains how Helenberger had to understand her role as Patsy and had put herself in the position of a mother in real life who actually had to experience the lost a child. The director had interviewed the Boulder County police Department and the cops origionally at the scene of Jonbenet Ramsey's kidnapping and murder had shared the files taken,evidence at the Ramsey's home,Photographs taken of the home,and basically shared the actual experience of investagating the 6 year olds murder. They also had the experience of the media and paparazzi hounding the Ramsey's. The director also explains the movement of the case from Steve Thomas to Alex Hunter,Alex Hunter Sharing substantual evidence of the murder to the Jeff shapiro who was a reporter for the globe. It has Jonbenet played by Dianne Iandoli doing some Pageant scenes (but not many)Just news and one of her being coached. And the beginning of the fil which gives her some lines but leads straight into the kidnapping and murder of Jonbenet. And by the way,Dyanne's parents had spoken to a child phsycoligest before playing the role and made it clear to the director,who also agreed to this, that one,she would be called Dyanne off the set at all times and never Jonbenet,And two,she would not be allowed near the setting of the murder or take place in the murder or autopsy scenes for emotional perposes and so that she would not be emotionally affected by the part of Jonbenet Ramsey. The scenes that showed the autopsy and the body WAS a dummy and the Boulder PD actually at the crime scene said that the crime scene photos where much more gruesom than the ones shown in the movie. And please note that everything shown DID actually happen. Nothing was made up,or added for special affects. It showed the actual detctives on the scene (played by actors of course) Listed as followed: Detective Linda Ardnt,Tom Trujillo, Alex Hunter,Steve Thomas,Lou Smit,Sgt. Larry Mason,John Eller,Det. Byfeild,Office Bob Whiteson,Det. Everett,Det. Jane Fleming,Alan Peterson,Chris Wolfe,And all the other detectives,and officers on the case.

1848991,5,B00008K7AQ,"This Is One Of The Best True crime videos ever it basically gives you the insight into the murder of JonBenet ramsey the most netorius Murder in history it stars Ronny Cox as John Ramsey Marg Helgenberger as Patsy Ramsey Kris Kristopherson as Lou Smit, The Video Shows How The Ramsey's were hounded by the press and how the were basically guilty according to the police, not only that it's shows how sloppy the ploice did on the case and the murder still remains unsolved, Diane Iandoli protrays JonBenet Ramsey It puts you in the drivers seat it acts like the real thing the action of Ronny cox and Marg Helgenberger are amazing they basically show you the real thing the movie is amazing.

1848993,5,B00008K7AQ,"This made-for-TV film was a strong presentation of the book, adhering closely to details presented therein.  Its only let-down is driven by the real-life fact that the case was not solved, and such indefinite endings always leave the viewer feeling somewhat flat.
The undisputed stars of the show were Marg Helgenberger and Ronny Cox as Patsy and John Ramsey.  Marg enjoyed what appeared to be a fabulous time chewing the scenery, dancing and playing with her daughter, and exhibiting a full range of theatrical emotion -- while simultaneously, Ronny did an absolutely stupendous job of being dazed and confused, an indecisive executive and wounded father.  They were perfect, and I hope they had a great deal of fun making that film.  The movie is worth watching just to watch them.
I first saw this film before reading the book, then again after doing so.  The film is a very capable adaptation, much more than many others you'll see.  Read the book, then watch it again.
And yes, I have an opinion as to who killed JonBenet.  If the character's portral in the film was consonant with that person's actual behavior during these events, then I am pretty darned certain who it was.",1057017600,23,1181,4.816831683168317

1849028,4,B00008K7AQ,"Directed by Schiller as a tele-movie, originally a series, from his own book about the murder of 6 year old glamour-puss Jon Bent Ramsey on Christmas Day (or Boxing Day) 1996 in Boulder, Colorado, it violently divided critics and viewers alike as either partisan, too procedural or just plain icky.  Young Jon Bent was found strangled in the family's cellar after what was called ""the 'War and Peace' of ransom notes"" turned up.  The parents became prime suspects; police and prosecutors clashed over the making of a prima facie case, and no one was ever charged.  The case fascinated the globe; the Ramseys were criticized for allowing their very young daughter to participate in beauty pageants for tots that had sexual overtones; they were accused of 'hiding behind lawyers' and drawing out police attempts to interview them; then they released a book ('The Death of Innocence') - plugging the book on TV they told Barbara Walters they would sit for a polygraph test (always an offer likely to increase suspicion).  Everyone seemed to be writing books - a detective on the case who noisily resigned, Steve Thomas, wrote his own book - so it is to the credit of this production that it manages a kind of believability and balance.

There is some good, some odd, casting (Kris Kristofferson as cold case specialist Lou Smit is a little off the wall), with performances ranging from good to Daffy Duck.  Actors from Club Sensible include Ronny Cox as John Ramsey, Ken Howard as D.A. Alex Hunter, Dennis Boutsikaris, Deirdre Lovejoy and John Heard as high-level cops, and Peter Friedman as a prosecutor who annoyingly keeps insisting on adhering to the Bill of Rights.  TVC does not quite know what Marg Helgenberger (Patsy Ramsey) and Ann-Margret, as her Mum, were up to, but overall, this film is worth a go, especially for anyone with an interest in the Ramsey case (its myriad clues leading up into cold thin air) or in the pressure on investigators arising from hysteria and what C. P. Snow called ""the brilliance of suspicion.""

Ten years after the murder, a disturbed young man with a Jon Bent obsession, confessed to the crime, but it seems clear enough he made it up, possibly to escape a pornography rap in Thailand.  Only the shadow knows what darkness lurks...",1427241600,,2271,4.832474226804123
