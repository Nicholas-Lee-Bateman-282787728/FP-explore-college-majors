7905634,5,B000009OS7,"My little girl, age four, likes this video and asks to watch it again, from time to time (sadly, I can't find any more episodes. The ""Bingo and Molly"" series ran on TV for several years when her older brother, now 11, was little, and he watched it faithfully). It compares favorably with ""Little Bear,"" ""Caillou,"" and other better-known productions. A lot of good writing and production work went into the creation of Bingo and Molly. I do hope it is not lost forever; and that somewhere, either more tapes or DVD's, or reruns of the shows, will surface.",1252195200,,554,4.606060606060606
