8126504,1,B000FTJ60G,"This DVD provides far short of any reasonable expectations.  You get very little countryside sights, very little city sights, and very little of the trains (exterior or interior). Just very little.  If this is part of a 13-part series, then perhaps the entire series would fit on a single DVD.  But then, the content was uninspired, unartful, and generally boring.",1169942400,3,364,5.033333333333333
