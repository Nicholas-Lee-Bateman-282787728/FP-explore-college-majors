I guess that is why there wasn't so many great ""highlights"" this past season.  But I bought this DVD anyway.  There is a lot of focus on Wayne Rooney, but I didn't find his press conference to be that interesting as a special feature.  Let's hope United do well next year so that there will be alot more highlights to the season.",1126396800,2,450,4.321428571428571
