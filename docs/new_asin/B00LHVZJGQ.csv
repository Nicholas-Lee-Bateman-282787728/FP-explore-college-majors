He is paying a price for this role and I have recommended it to several who don't believe this happens--Brits and Americans. Thank you,Nikesh,for your bravery and caring heart! And for Indian Summers!",1472774400,,284,4.9375

8666011,3,B00LHVZJGQ,"HONOUR is a difficult movie to watch.  Centering on the idea of honor killings, a practice that not only prevails in Muslim communities but in other cultures as well, it focuses on the way in which Mona (Aiysha Hart), 'transgresses' her family's sense of ethics by falling in love with a Punjabi man Tanvir (Nikesh Patel).  Spurred on by her elder brother Kasim (Faraz Ayub), who works for London's Metropolitan Police by day, the family engage a bounty-hunter (Paddy Considine) to pursue Mona and discover her whereabouts.  This he agrees to do, while at the same time despising the family, especially Mother (Harvey Virdi), who spends most of her time at home working as a seamstress.

The movie opens explosively with the dnouement, and then goes back to tell the story of why Mona was considered to 'transgress'.  The ideas might seem shocking to non-Muslims, but Shan Khan's film shows how important it is for young women - especially - to forge the right marriages, even if it means them being transported back to Pakistan to marry a spouse chosen for them by their family, and agreed upon (normally on financial terms) by the groom's family.

Shot in neo-documentary style around the streets of the London suburb of Southall, a major center for the Asian community, HONOUR makes much of the private/public distinction: by day Kasim spends his time working for an organization that explicitly pursues anti-racist policies (in the wake of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, which exposed large-scale racism in the Metropolitan Police).  By night he appears to embrace just the kind of racism that the police try to eradicate, as he abuses Tanvir - and at one point holds him captive.  Yet director Khan does not criticize Kasim for this; on the contrary he suggests that this is a way of life for many of London's Asian communities.

The real villain of the piece is Considine's bounty-hunter, who has no sense of belief other than to obtain as much money as possible.  He is the true racist in the sense that he makes no effort to understand anybody's motives; all that matters for him is that the job should be done and he should receive due financial reward.  It is people like him who help to perpetuate the racist stereotypes that prevent members of different communities from integrating with one another in inner cities - not just in London, but everywhere.

HONOUR offers no comfort of an easy resolution.  On the contrary, it suggests that second or third generation Asians living in western capitals have to acknowledge the presence of cultural difference, and observe the conventions laid down by their families, even it that means sacrificing the so-called 'freedom' of the west for a more confined existence.  This might seem 'unfair' in Mona's cause, but only because she has been brought up in a culture that supposedly values free will.",1411516800,,2852,4.890041493775934
8666012,4,B00LHVZJGQ,"Mona (Aiysha Hart) is a westernized Pakistani living in England. Her relationship with her boyfriend, as well as her westernized ways have dishonored the family. In the first few minutes of the film, she is killed and placed in a trunk. We then flash back to the events leading up to her demise.

An Aryan Brotherhood hitman (Paddy Considine) is hired to find and return her in the flashback. His normal job is to kill dishonored Muslim women, working for the community of Muslims while all the while hating them. About 50 minutes into the film we are back to where we started. There was no good reason for the flashback other than to confuse us and to tease us with some action in this slow action drama.

The film is a bit dry and formulaic. 3 1/2 stars

F-bomb. Brief implied sex. No nudity.",1404864000,2,794,4.462068965517242
