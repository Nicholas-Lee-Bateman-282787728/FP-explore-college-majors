4438747,4,B004ODLUGM,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- The Gruffalo isn't a particularly ambitious animated short nor a remarkably inventive one, but it's a perfectly charming little tale that should keep the youngsters spellbound. Older viewers will be two steps ahead of the game from the beginning (and I imagine that even the young kids will have figured out the final twist by the time it arrives), but this is a sturdy example of how to bring a children's storybook to life. The story is classical in style and stays free from the pop-culture snark that runs through so much children's entertainment these days (if this were a Dreamworks flick, you know the word ""Gruffalo"" would be rhymed with ""Mark Ruffalo"" at some point). The animation is low-budget but distinctively designed, which is more or less essential if you don't have the funds to dazzle with technical polish. The voice work from the very overqualified cast (most characters only have a small handful of lines) is exceptional, and the music by Rene Aubry has an appealingly breezy quality.

There's not much else to say about this 27-minute short (which moves at such a laid-back pace that it somehow feels even shorter), save for the fact that it probably deserved its Oscar nomination but also deserved to lose the win to The Lost Thing.

I do wish that The Gruffalo could have been paired with something else to pad the running time of the disc, but the transfer is very handsome, boasting vibrant colors and excellent detail. Audio is top-notch too, with the pleasant score and sonorous vocal work coming through with clarity. Extras include a 13-minute making-of featurette and some storyboards.

4438748,5,B004ODLUGM,"A truely beautiful short film based on the childrens book, ""The Gruffalo"". It played on cable during the Christmas holiday 2010 and we were able to DVR it. My children (boy aged 5 and girl aged 3) ask to watch it about once a week, especially if we read the story at bedtime. I personally like to watch it, and most of their shows I cant stand. The movie uses only the words from the book, and does an excellent job retelling it. It shows the circle of life, where every creature in the ""deep dark wood"" is being eaten by something else; mouse sees all this and comes up with a plan to escape the same fate. An excellent story, we just  love it. I cant wait for the DVD to come out - Im sick of fast forwarding past all the commercials.",1309478400,40,736,4.111111111111111

4438883,4,B004ODLUGM,"Thank you JG PR for sending us this DVD to review!

The childrens book The Gruffalo written by Julia Donaldson came out in 1999.  Since its release, it has received numerous awards including Smarties Prize and the Blue Peter Award for the Best Book to Read Aloud.  Given the awards and the 5-star rating on Amazon, its safe to say that its a good book and deserves the DVD treatment.

The 30-minute DVD has a suggested retail price of $9.99, but is available to stream for free for Prime members.  Digitally renting this movie is possible for $3.99, but you may as well buy a physical copy for an extra dollar.

The story begins with a squirrel mother gathering nuts for her young children.  Instead of food, theyd rather hear a story about a mouse or a monster.  The mother squirrel compromises and tells them a story about both.

A hungry brown mouse is trying to make his way to a nut tree for dinner.  Its quite a ways away and throughout his journey he gets stopped by a fox, an owl, and a snake.  They each invite the mouse over for a meal, with him being the main course!  The wily mouse outsmarts all of them by telling them that hes on his way to a meal with a gruffalo and describes its fearsome traits to them.  When each of the animals hears about the gruffalos hideous features and discovers that they are its favorite meal, they promptly release the mouse.

The mouses tall tale gets more complex with each retelling of it.  Imagine his surprise when he comes face to face with an actual gruffalo who matches his description to a tee!  The mouses next feat is to convince the gruffalo to not eat him!  Will he succeed?  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that my daughter and I both enjoyed this movie and its sequel, The Gruffalos Child.",1485388800,,1758,4.3734567901234565

We use it to entertain them yet I find it hard to pull myself away once it begins, and at only 20 minutes it is a prefect break/interlude. Also consider Griffalo's Child.

4439248,5,B004ODLUGM,"I got this short movie for my son who is 5, and we both fell in love with it. The story is extremely charming, and is about a mouse who wanders the woods and runs into a fair few animals who wish to eat him. The mouse creates a story to scare them off, but what will happen when he stumbles upon his imaginary creature? The voice acting is done so well, and it is really nice to hear the familiar voices of Robbie Coltrane and Helena Bonham Carter. It is one of my favorite movies to watch with my son, and only runs about a half an hour, so it doesn't take too long. The animation is also done very well, with some very beautiful scenery of the ""deep dark wood."" One of my favorite things about the movie is the music. It is simple and the tune is one I don't mind getting stuck in my head. I highly recommend this to anyone with children, or anyone that is a fan of animation. This is also a movie that is good for kids of any age.",1472601600,7,933,3.9680851063829787

During the first viewing she was hesitant in a few areas in which the mouse was trying to scare the other animals. However, she seemed to understand the story and has come to really like this movie. She also enjoys the sequel as well. Personally, I enjoy the slower pace and calm narration.

The imagery is beautiful and the story engaging. He found the movie a little scary, ""but not too scary, Mama."" He doesn't watch a whole lot of television or movies -- he gets a similar look of concern while watching some of the Thomas episodes, for example.  So his level of fear may be a little more than kids who have more exposure. I also love that it's only about 30 minutes long.

We haven't read this story yet, so it will be interesting to see how the two compare.",1448236800,,602,4.226086956521739

However, I was delightfully surprised at hour the story was handled, framing it in the story being told to a family of squirrels.  The animation is beautiful and it is well acted by some pretty famous actors like Helena Bonham Carter and John Hurt.  There are some times of the story where no words are spoken and the focus is on the surroundings of the little mouse and the squirrels, but the timing is such that it is not enough to be boring and if you look closely at the animals and things in the wood there are actually some pretty funny moments.  It was oddly mesmerizing, I would recommend it to any family.",1445904000,3,724,4.340740740740741

The music is awesome.  Very relaxing, great paced, and calming.  The story is great alliteration, simple, and fun.

I try to avoid violence or scary things for my boys and this seems to fit that, although I wasn't too sure it would at first because there is a lot of implied natural dinners going on in this movie.  Kids need to learn that sometime, but I was worried it would be scary.  Doesn't appear to be so far.  Do watch it before you let your kids watch it and see what you think in that regard.

Anyway, a very cute, relaxing, fun movie for my toddler boys.  Anytime they point to the TV/iPad and say ""mouse"" they are in the mood to watch this.",1440374400,3,747,4.0272108843537415

The animation (CGI) is a bit rough or simplified, yet it captures the character's emotions fairly well. The film is based on a children's book of the same name (written by Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler). The film was nominated for an Oscar (best animated short) in 2011.
Some scenes may be a bit too scary for the very young. Otherwise, ""Gruffalo"" is a pleasant and amusing film for the entire family.",1427673600,2,696,5.008620689655173

4440455,3,B004ODLUGM,"I would normally have given a movie like this 5 stars and fully expected to except that some of the most unexpected things happened.  First of all, I didn't look at how long it was and I think the price of $6 for 40 minutes of entertainment is way too much money.  That's my own fault for not checking but the kids saw the commercial for this movie on a different show and I said I would get it for a birthday coming up.  Well, I got it and of course they insisted on watching it.  So, I put it in and after a few minutes they were off doing other things.  I asked if they were liking the movie and they said it was boring.  I tried it three more times throughout the week and they kept wanting me to change it to a different movie.

I only watched about 10 minutes of it, which is a good chunk considering how short it is.  There really isn't that much to it and it seemed like a cute story. (We read a lot of books but have just never had this one around.) However, it's pretty slow which is probably why the kids got bored of it.  My kids are not yet in school so they have never read the story and I'm sure if they had they might have been more interested in it.  Perhaps we will try it again when they are older but for now, it's just in with the movies and is not one they are interested in at all.",1425600000,,1304,3.9053030303030303

The best part about this movie besides the wonderful voice actors or the animation or the wonderful fact that it is less than a half hour??  It's not Frozen!!!!

We found this movie by accident on a crummy, cold winter day when we needed something to keep dear daughter distracted long enough to get a meal going and switch some laundry.  It was a ""well, there's nothing else on Netflix; and we're not watching Frozen again;  I like Helena Bonham Carter; oooh Robbie Coltrain isn't he Hagrid?; let's give it a shot out of desperation"" choice and we really ended up love it.

4440480,5,B004ODLUGM,"A mouse desperate not to be eaten describes a mythical creature to scare off his would-be lunch partners. Lo and behold, he discovers this fictitious beast exists in his world.  Now, faced with once again being eaten, he needs to concoct a plan to escape. How?

Told in a rhyming fashion, it cleverly avoids being sing-song as in some of Julia Donaldson's other books. Similar to the tradition of a classic fairy or folk tale, ""The Gruffalo,"" is a strong addition to children's animation. It lands somewhere between Grimm, Andersen and American folk tales, with a slight nod the the German and Slavic storytellers with their frequent forest setting.

Helena Bonham Carter warmly tells the story, James Corden is the mouse, and Robbie Coltrane is the Gruffalo himself. Each is excellently cast, as are the other actors (John Hurt, Tom Wilkinson, Rob Brydon). The pacing is superb, allowing the viewer to catch all the humor and see the details.

It is realistic in that it acknowledges the cycle of life. Bugs are eaten. Frogs are eaten. And, naturally, mice want to avoid being eaten.

There's a happy, satisfying ending, and never too scary. I fully recommend, ""The Gruffalo.""

4440539,5,B004ODLUGM,This animated movie is a lovingly made version of the Gruffalo Book. It is very faithful to the story and the animation takes it's cue directly from the illustrations in the book.

The thing I love about it as the parent is that for reading (the video is the same as the book) the rhyme and rhythm doesn't give you a headache.  The type of rhyme I see in a lot of other books is irksome.  This author ... She mixes it up, but it's still very musical and catchy.",1399334400,,454,3.902173913043478

The narration is also very conducive to nap time, so that's a plus. We've already used this movie as a reward to defuse a tantrum. If you ask me what this movie is about, I've no idea though. I've sat through it and found nothing objectionable to toddlers, and mine are crazy about forest creatures, so even better.

4440566,5,B004ODLUGM,A fun tale showing how a small vulnerable mouse uses his wits to handle threatening situations.  The unusual twist--one that children will love--is that the mouse's ruse backfires.  Yet he still manages to make the best of the situation.  The illustrations make you love all the characters--even the giant Gruffalo.,1388188800,,315,5.26

4440589,2,B004ODLUGM,"My 19 month old **LOVES** the book (and so do Daddy-Man and I).  When we heard there was a movie, we found a copy to check it out before buying it.  Thank goodness we did, because this is NOT a movie I recommend for younger kids.

Somewhere in our childhood, we all learn that every creature is food for something else.  It's a sobering reality, but it is a truth that little kids (the target audience of the story) do NOT need to have driven home with an animated freakin' hammer!  Throughout the whole movie, animals are killing and eating other animals. It was completely unnerving and totally unnecessary to the story which already has Mouse in peril with the 3 predators he encounters.  Even though we don't actually see the animals being eaten, it is made very obvious that this is what is going on and it happens repeatedly throughout the movie.  This level of ""violence"" in a children's animation was very unexpected.  The movie should have a rating of PG 13.  I'm guessing the ""G"" rating is for ""Gruffalo"" and not ""General Audiences""  :-/

As an added insult to fans of the book, the movie turns Mouse into a fictional character in his own story!!  The book is a story about Mouse.  The movie is a story about a mother squirrel (Helena Bonham Carter) who nearly got eaten in front of her kids and to help calm them, she tells a story about a pretend mouse.  Not cool.

The 2 good things about this movie is 1) the original art style of the book is used and 2)  when they finally got to Mouse's story, the movie stuck to it, word-for-word ... with some interruptions throughout the story to return to Helena-Squirrel and her kids ... and then when Mouse's story was done, went back to Helena-Squirrel and her kids.  Unfortunately, having the whole squirrel-thing breaks up the brilliant cadence of the original written work which flows so beautifully from the book.

If your children (or you) love this story and really want to see it acted out, make paper puppets on popsicle sticks or something.  Just ... don't let them watch this movie or they'll have nightmares about things under the water getting them (GULP-GULP-GULP!)  **Shudder**",1376524800,6,2147,4.614775725593668
4440590,5,B004ODLUGM,"My sons William and Mason, aged 4 and 3, loved this movie!! They watched it over and over again. William says his favorite part was ""all of it"" and Mason was entranced by the Gruffalo. William said he would also recommend it to his friends.",1376179200,,240,4.355555555555555
4440591,5,B004ODLUGM,The grandchildren loved it.  Story narration was done in quiet and gentle tones.  Children were shown how you can overcome difficulties by using your thinking skills rather than violence.,1375660800,,187,5.413793103448276
4440592,4,B004ODLUGM,"My wife told me this was originally a book, which I've never read, but I liked the story.  Good background music as well.  My daughters like it and ask to watch it again randomly.  Has some minor scary moments for younger kids but it isn't anything really dramatic, just more of the ""what-if"" fear than actual scariness.  I would recommend this as short movie for kids to enjoy.",1375488000,,378,4.514705882352941
4440593,5,B004ODLUGM,"I bought this for my grandson partly based on the many reviews. My grandson loves it.  I love it. It is ideal for very young children because it is a book narrated in the really gentle, beautiful voice of Helena Bonham-Carter. it mirrors the illustratations of the book which are wonderful. It is a non scary, scary story in which even the Gruffalo has a rather appealing ugliness. The length is perfect for my 2.5 year old grandchild whose attention wanes after about 40 minutes. I guess what I appreciated most is the simplicity of the tale and the illustrations, no violence of any sort (not even playful), not too many words, nothing to scare a toddler, and the perfect length. I've bought and shelved a lot of movies meant for toddlers (I always watch them first) because they contain scenes that are not appropriate for children who are at an age where they imitate things they see without being able to discriminate between appropriate and non appropriate behaviours. This is just plain lovely and I won't get bored watching it many times. With a grandson who is extremely active, it is just great to have a story which calms him down before bedtime. As an aside, I would really appreciate people reviewing the actual product and not the shipping and packaging problems they experienced. It's not helpful to those of us who want to read about the product itself. I'm speaking to the person who gave this film one star and others who do the same. The Gruffalo is fantastic.",1374451200,,1479,4.666666666666667

I have no reservations about this one, though.  This and ""The Gruffalo's Child"" are two of my favorites.  If you like these, you should also check out some Scholastic DVDs that similarly translate popular children's books into great, truly kid-friendly movies.  As a bonus, they are also fairly short which is perfect if you don't want your kids watching a screen for many long hours per day.",1374451200,,564,4.724489795918367

I found both ""The Gruffalo"" and ""The Gruffalo's Child"" in book form and Video.  I purchased them in both formats.  He loves the books and the short little videos.  It is amazing to me how well this 4-year old child understood the twist in the story.  As he watches the video, He gives out a big belly laugh every time the mouse outsmarts the other creatures of the forest.  I highly recommend this series.  The books allow him to page through at his own pace and go back and forth and search out the details in the illustrations.",1365724800,,679,4.349206349206349

I am making movies this year with my elementary school class and have been using this DVD to teach them about non-verbal interactions and the fact that, just because you are not saying a line doesn't mean you can't interact and tell a story.  The movie is 30 min. long and most of that time is non-verbal interactions as the mouse goes along on his adventure.  Very well done.",1362096000,,497,4.311827956989247

I went online, searched Amazon, found it and ordered the DVD version. One week later I get the product in the mail. I opened the package only to find a crumpled DVD case (the case is made of paper). Fearing the worst I gently opened the case and removed the bent out of shape DVD disk. It's not broken. I tried it in vain in my DVD player but it didn't work. Trying to satisfy my already disappointed son I then ordered the Gruffalo in paperback. He read it and loved it. It's the shipping standard that crushed this review.",1351900800,4,646,4.176

We just rented the sequel, The Gruffalo's Child, and they love that one, too.  One reason I enjoy it so much is that we've played it probably 60-100 times now here and there and it's still not annoying to me.  Most of the kids movies eventually drive me crazy after a few times of seeing / hearing it in the background, but this one is by far, one of my favorites.",1344470400,,506,4.08080808080808

4440664,5,B004ODLUGM,"Firstly, I haven't purchased this DVD yet, but I will as soon as I can.  I borrowed it from our local library because my two older kids love the book.
I am pushing 40, and was drawn into the absolutely fantastic production values put into this short children's film.  Already knowing the story inside out (hey, reading it every night for weeks on end, it's almost memorized now), I was pleasantly surprised how many added details these filmakers were able to put into this DVD.
On top of this, there is a wonderful behind-the-scenes featurette on the DVD showing all the work that went into making this film.  And not only did the filmmakers put their all into this show, they managed to bring in top notch actors to voice the main characters.  I mean, having Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid from Harry Potter movies) and John Hurt (the poor man who found out how Aliens are born) working on this shows just how seriously everyone took the project.
Beautifully rendered in CGI computer graphics, the main characters actually inhabit a real-life created world; that's right, the background soil, trees, rocks etc. were all made in miniature, including meticulously made leaves and twigs.  Amazing.
This goes to show how a labour of love can be realized with the right people helping you out.
And the music!  Full orchestra soundtrack - not just a synthesizer.
And all wrapped up in a 34 minute show.
Incredible.  Well worth the price, despite being a short film.  If you've read the book, prepare to be amazed at seeing the book truly and believably come to life!

My preferences being ""what the kids like that I actually enjoy too"".  Well, most of what my kids like I merely tolerate.  Not ""The Gruffalo"".  If they are watching, I feel compelled to watch too.  It's such a clever little story, with its rhymes, thought balloons (how do you imagine Owl ice cream?), and imagination interludes (how would a mouse imagine an invitation to lunch by a fox?)  Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful as the mother, conveying a warmth that is rare in a cartoon.  It still makes me laugh or smile, even though I've seen it many times now.  I love that it is short (about half an hour) because sometimes we just want a little something before bed or while waiting for dinner to cool.

Perhaps it would be nice for older children. I only gave it 3 stars because it had a great billed up and a short ending. Judge for yourself but don't expect a lot.,1323388800,2,324,4.0
4440679,5,B004ODLUGM,This was such an excellent movie for those who love the book! It was put together so nicely! Anyone who loves te book will love the movie!,1322265600,,138,4.148148148148148

4440681,5,B004ODLUGM,"We bought this DVD for our 2-year-old daughter after we had rented it from the Redbox and she didn't want to bring it back.  I enjoy watching this DVD just as much as my daughter, and now when we read the book at bedtime, I even find myself acting out the characters.  Great, great fun!",1321488000,,286,4.181818181818182
4440682,5,B004ODLUGM,My 2 year old son has loved this book since he got it over a year ago so we were really excited to get him the movie version. It is a little more scary than the book only because the animation and music highlights some of the characteristics of the Gruffalo but my son didn't seem to get freaked out; he asked to watch it again as soon as the credits started to roll. It is extremely well done and the animation is very beautiful. I highly recommend this movie for kids already familiar with or new to the Gruffalo tale.,1320192000,,520,4.158415841584159
4440683,5,B004ODLUGM,"I purchased this DVD for my 5 year and 3 year daughters.  They both loved it and I loved that they begged to watch this instead of a Disney Princess or Barbie DVD.  The story is sweet, the animation even sweeter.  Boys would love as well.",1318809600,,238,4.130434782608695
4440684,5,B004ODLUGM,"Oh NO...It's a GRUFFALO!

The Gruffalo has got to be the most beaten up book on my kids bookshelf.
Translated: The most read book on my kids bookshelf.
And not only because my kids love it, but because every time they ask me to pick a book to read to them, it's the book I go for too. (Yes, it's that hypnotic!)
This best-selling children's book was introduced August 16th on DVD
and really had a lot to live up to.
If you've read the charming rhymes in The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson, and seen the amazing artwork byAxel Scheffler, you'll understand what I mean.
The story of an adorable little mouse out-witting three predators who want to eat him, coupled with a monster from his imagination that comes to life, definitely calls for some fun.
And, I will say, the motion picture delivered, and then some!
The Academy Award nominated film was narrated by Helena Bonham Carter (from Harry Potter), and features voices of an all-star cast.
You really get to watch the characters develop, and see more of their personalities. The visuals are stunning, and you can tell they worked really, really hard to make sure that the animated version lived up to the magic of the original book.
Two thumbs way up!
The Gruffalo is going to be cast as a truly timeless children's classic.
My kids are going to watch this DVD over and over, until it's no longer playable.
That's just a fact.",1318636800,,1377,4.55241935483871
4440685,5,B004ODLUGM,"My 2 kids LOVE this movie and the book.
The movie is the perfect length for a little evening tv (about a 1/2 hour). You can tell the producers really sat down with the book on this one. They added a lot of visuals and padded the story, but mostly with images that they pulled from the book, but a few bonus sequences thrown in. They were very careful to keep the original rhyme of the book in place which is clever and touching.
Magical. We love all it. + for the price! totally worth it!",1317686400,,488,4.09375
4440686,5,B004ODLUGM,"We watched this movie with our children and grandchildren last Christmas on TV as a holiday special and everyone loved it. We failed to record it and it was not available in the USA. I saw a recommendation for it in the August Family Fun magazine,now available in a USA compatible DVD. I ordered one for myself,one for my grandchildren,and one for my niece's children. My niece said her girls, ages 2 & 4, watched it 3 times in a row the day they received it. Wonderful family movie, very clever and imaginative.",1316908800,,512,4.516129032258065
4440687,5,B004ODLUGM,"Today, I finally convinced my sons to watch The Gruffalo with me. They are little creatures of habit and love to watch the same things over and over again. I can gladly say that I now The Gruffalo will be added to their ""List of Most Watched"" shows.
I had never heard of the book ""The Gruffalo"" except through a blog post by my friend, Erin. So I was unsure of how I'd like this movie, having never read the book (and books are generally better than any movie!). But oh, this was precious. I really loved the animation - I don't know what kind it was but almost a claymation type.
What a fun little tale! I couldn't tell if the narrator(s) were rabbits or squirrels. My favorite part of the movie was when the owl flew in to three trees. It just made me laugh out loud; and Moose too! Honestly this was just a wonderful show; not very long! And just so simply beautiful. Truly, this is a must-have DVD - and book. I hope to buy the book soon for my sons!",1315353600,,954,4.134408602150538
4440688,4,B004ODLUGM,A really cute story that kids and adults will enjoy!  The artwork is very similar to the book and it makes a great gift also.,1314921600,,125,4.0
4440689,5,B004ODLUGM,This film was really cute and my boys were totally captivated as we all sat down and enjoyed the film together on a relaxing Sunday afternoon. The cartoon work is really beautiful throughout the film and it was just really such an enjoyable story to watch it even held on to my attention really well!,1314921600,6,300,4.472727272727273
4440690,5,B004ODLUGM,"The Gruffalo tells the whimsical story of a little mouse who goes on a stroll in the woods.  He comes across several other creatures - predators who all think the little mouse looks quite tasty!  The witty mouse must do his best to keep from being eaten!  He invents a story about a terrible monster, The Gruffalo, who will of course devour all the predators.  Our little hero is pretty pleased with himself when his enemies run away - but what will become of him when the creature of his imagination turns out to be not quite so imaginary after all?

I highly recommend it!  Featuring voice talents such as Helena Bonham Carter and Robbie Coltrane, the tale has a lyrical feel that takes you along on the little mouse's journey.  The animation is beautiful, the story is sweet and overall it may become a family favorite.  Hubby and I enjoyed watching the behind-the-scenes feature - it was fascinating to see how the animation team brought everything together.",1314921600,19,962,4.684523809523809
4440691,5,B004ODLUGM,"The Gruffalo has seen a lot of use in our house. A cute and clever kid's book. This movie competently captures the mood of the book. The animation matches the original art very closely, and it's got the lines from the original book (plus a few more).

This is not a long feature at all, but it really shouldn't be (don't get me started on Where The Wild Things Are movie).",1314835200,5,372,4.23943661971831

It is certainly one of my favorite children's movies.  Not only do kids enjoy it - but adults do too.  In fact, a great gift for a kid would be the movie and the book together - with some popcorn!",1314489600,,322,4.316666666666666
4440693,5,B004ODLUGM,"A fabulous looking cartoon with an uncomplicated story.  There's enough fringe elements though to hold an adult's interest (loved the bit with the follow-the-leader ants).  Based on a traditional Chinese folk tale, it's one of the more classic themes used in Children's Literature.  I really enjoyed the bonus feature: The making of The Gruffalo.  It was fascinating to see how they came up with the look of this cartoon.",1313712000,,421,5.057971014492754
4440694,5,B004ODLUGM,"I echo the previous reviewer.  We DVR'd The Gruffalo and I am very excited to not have to fast forward holiday commercials.  That said, my kids (ages 2 and 6) love to watch this and have watched it on average of once a week for 7 months now.  Unlike other kids' programming, I don't mind having it on in the background and enjoy watching it from time to time.  It is a very sweet little tale with nicely done animation, music, and calming voices.  There is also much you can talk about with both very young and older children. I highly recommend this one - appropriate for all ages and will not annoy the adults in the room.",1313107200,15,624,4.254237288135593

And my kids just LOVE it!  Any time a visitor comes over my daughter wants to show them the movie..lol  It's 40 minutes long and also has bonus content.
Besides the story I love the music.  It is really beautiful!  A rare thing in children's dvd's.",1312934400,5,413,4.298701298701299
