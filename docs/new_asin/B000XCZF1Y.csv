3001148,5,B000XCZF1Y,R. Kelly's Trapped in the Closet is the work of a genius.  I have Chapters 1-22 and the twists and turns are so unexpected!  Awesome mind to put it to words like he does.  I cannot wait for the next chapters!!!  I hope it's soon!,1238716800,3,229,4.022222222222222
3001149,5,B000XCZF1Y,"Despite what people may think of R. Kelly, I dig and I love his music.  I love the stories he tells with his music.  Also from the U Saved Me album it is a whole story on how if you beleive... God can work miracles.  This Trapped in the closet was another show of his talent in writing and directing short stories.  It was very amusing.  A nice peice of entertainment.  Good singing and nice wardrobe.  I loved that white suit!",1229904000,2,427,4.197530864197531

3001151,4,B000XCZF1Y,R Kelly is not just an artist but he is also a genius. It was like reading a book in video form. I laughed throughout the entire video.,1201478400,7,135,3.857142857142857
3001152,5,B000XCZF1Y,"R. Kelly is such an intelligent young man and he has given us some fantastic music.  I really enjoyed Trapped in the closet, esp. Ch. 1 -12 The Pimp and the older couple could have been left out completely.  The bro in law and Cathy Rufus and chuck played and lip synced perfectly and so did ""Omar"" from The Wire, ohhhh James was his name, he is such a Great actor.  The wife Gwen could NOT lip sync well at all.

Great Work !!! Kell keep it up !!  STOP GETTING INTO TROUBLE, IT IS NOT WORTH.... STAY HOME Kells !!!! love ya",1201305600,4,524,4.048543689320389
3001153,5,B000XCZF1Y,"the Genius Mind of R.Kelly recalls Charlie Chaplin, Orson Wells, Benny Hill, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx, and other Slap Stick Humor along with a compelling Piece of Music that speaks on a night gone crazy that might be seen daily on the Jerry Springer show or Maury Povich Show. R.Kelly went back in time with his own Luke and laura or Young and the Restless style Soap Opera. this Film contains all of the chapters and other footage plus a ROd Stieger style  Commentary that is cool. his Depth and overall drive never ceases to amaze me. He is Beyond driven and He has changed the way we see video. He brought Black theater to video much along the way that Tyler Perry has done with film. R.Kelly has made a lasting impact and this film adds to his Legacy and Genius.  Get your Popcorn and see if you can remember all the characters and stay tunned for More from  Da Kang of R&B. dig the vocal harmonys, Humor and the way he breaks it all down. this film would have been winning Oscars in the silent film era. this Film is ROck and Roll.",1197763200,14,1050,4.319796954314721

Also not to mention all of it is voiced by the beautiful voice of R.Kelly, over forty mintues of R.kelly signing as a guy or a girl. But the best thing about ""Trapped in the Closet"" is that you can listen to it at any occasion. At a funeral? Put on ""Trapped in the Closet"" Is your girl giving you head and your mom walks up the stairs and sees but doesnt say anything so you tell your girl and she starts crying? Put on ""Trapped in the Closet""! Works 10/10 times",1447459200,,722,4.091549295774648

3001183,4,B000XCZF1Y,"Bought this as a gag gift for a friend.  I have watched the series before and it a bizarre tale of how everyone in a town 'gets around' with everyone else and the consequences of their actions.  Extremely over dramatic, at times hilarious with the twists it takes.  On some levels, this is ingenious and others purely stupid.  Over all it is quite the fun tale.  I do love that R. Kelly keeps referring to his 1911 as a Beretta though....",1433721600,,438,4.3580246913580245

3001187,5,B000XCZF1Y,"What is there to say? It's R. Kelly singing to himself for an hour and thirty minutes. The commentary is a special treat -- Kels sits in an armchair, watches the movie on a screen, and occasionally turns to the camera to directly narrate what you're already seeing. For example, ""See, I woke up in this girl's bed, but I didn't mean to stay there. So now I'm trying to get out quick."" (that's a rough paraphrasing, but you get the idea.)

3001204,5,B000XCZF1Y,I never laughed so much or so long. This story was so intertwined in that each chapter was built from the chapter before. Every time you think it can't get any worse here comes a new twist. I am eagerly awaiting future chapters.,1401235200,3,228,4.325581395348837

3001207,5,B000XCZF1Y,"There's hardly anything like this bit of musico-soap-opera-hip'hop'drama history. It just keeps getting weirder and weirder. In a woman that's not so good, but in a traditional format, it's refreshing. But sometimes too much is just too much.

I figured my fiancee just had BET on again--he loves hip hop.  I walked over to the TV and saw the retro lettering appear on the screen: Trapped in the Closet.  ""This is a real thing? Like it's not just a song?"" I exclaimed.  I considered changing the channel, but for some reason, I could not turn away (probably because it was IFC, not BET, and almost everything on that channel is amazing).

It starts out with a very simple storyline, but after the first 30 minutes or so, you find yourself having to pay attention. Thankfully, R. Kelly inserts little summaries into the saga to catch you up. Things just get more and more complex as the story unfolds, and I'm astounded by the sheer creativity that lies behind this Hip Hopera.

My favorite line in the first 20 minutes or so is,""Oh! Here we go again!"" Exactly the kind of self-refection I would expect from a creative genius.  I know that R. Kelly peed on someone, but after seeing this, I really don't care.

Anyway, back to Thanksgiving: Within about 3 minutes of staring at the ridiculous hijinks occuring on screen, we were hooked. We could not leave the TV until the entire series was over. Now, I'm getting these episodes for my father-in-law (and one extra set for us). I think of it as an ""I'm sorry for missing the first 3 hours of Thanksgiving, and Happy Christmas, too!"" present",1355097600,17,1476,4.481343283582089

It does not matter what color you are (I am black, my BF and family are white) funny has no racial barrier. We were all ""oh no!!"" and OMG!!! and WHAT!! at every turn. We laughed and laughed and it was a fun way to spend time after eating and exchanging gifts.

Brigitte is having an affair with a midget (they like to be called ""little people"", but I guess he couldn't find a rhyme for that).  She attempts to distract her husband UPSTAIRS with PEARS. REALLY? LOL!  He can't keep his tenses right, he breaks his own storytelling rules, he uses horribly bigoted, sexiest language without seeming to even know it, AND best of all, HE does all the voices for everyone (Bridgette is a white woman in LA who sounds like she's just been plucked off the farm in Alabama).My boyfriend and I put this movie on when we want to freak people out and make them laugh and squirm uncomfortably.  NOT ONE person has watched it without BEGGING for it to be turned off because they're laughing too hard and can't take the horror anymore.  It's that funny-bad. Tommy Wissau's ""the ROOM"" is even worse, so we usually follow ""Trapped in the Closet"" with it.

When taken at face value one might mistake this movie for a cheap poorly written narrative about the life of mindless thug.  In reality Kelly has created one of the world's greatest satires.  The character Bridget and her affair with a little person named ""Big Man"" is clearly a metaphor for the Bush Administration's mishandling of the Iraq war, and mismanagement of government funding.  There are so many hidden icons, and underlying themes that one must watch this movie several times before appreciating its cinematic value.

R.Kelly went back in time with his own Luke and laura or Young and the Restless style Soap Opera. this Film contains all of the chapters and other footage plus a ROd Stieger style  Commentary that is cool. his Depth and overall drive never ceases to amaze me. He is Beyond driven and He has changed the way we see video. He brought Black theater to video much along the way that Tyler Perry has done with film.

You seriously don't know, though you sometimes guess, if he was joking when he wrote this or if he was seriously trying to make a hip-hop-era...  My girlfriend introduced me to this and I ordered it the next day. DVD has a bonus commentary which is nothing special but overall it is still worth the purchase.  If you find it on YouTube (as I have tried) you'll notice many parts are cut out etc.  Something this good deserves a few dollars.",1358553600,,534,4.463917525773196

3235757,5,B000XCZF1Y,"I was making some salad in the kitchen on Thanksgiving and I heard what sounded like R. Kelly singing. It was coming from the TV.  I figured my fiancee just had BET on again--he loves hip hop.  I walked over to the TV and saw the retro lettering appear on the screen: Trapped in the Closet.  ""This is a real thing? Like it's not just a song?"" I exclaimed.  I considered changing the channel, but for some reason, I could not turn away (probably because it was IFC, not BET, and almost everything on that channel is amazing).

It starts out with a very simple storyline, but after the first 30 minutes or so, you find yourself having to pay attention. Thankfully, R. Kelly inserts little summaries into the saga to catch you up. Things just get more and more complex as the story unfolds, and I'm astounded by the sheer creativity that lies behind this Hip Hopera.

My favorite line in the first 20 minutes or so is,""Oh! Here we go again!"" Exactly the kind of self-refection I would expect from a creative genius.  I know that R. Kelly peed on someone, but after seeing this, I really don't care.

Anyway, back to Thanksgiving: Within about 3 minutes of staring at the ridiculous hijinks occuring on screen, we were hooked. We could not leave the TV until the entire series was over. Now, I'm getting these episodes for my father-in-law (and one extra set for us). I think of it as an ""I'm sorry for missing the first 3 hours of Thanksgiving, and Happy Christmas, too!"" present",1355097600,17,1476,4.481343283582089
3235758,1,B000XCZF1Y,"I do not understand how anyone who listens to this can say anything along the lines of ""This is good!"". I did get a good laugh at how ridiculous/idiotic/dim-witted it is. As an R Kelly fan, I'm terribly embarrassed for him.",1354752000,,223,4.463414634146342
3235759,4,B000XCZF1Y,"Everyone is right. The first couple chapters are pretty damn good. Then he just gets silly with it. But hey, its R. Kelly, singin like he do he makes this hip hopera sound amazing. Plus he's telling story, watch and enjoy it. I cant stop watching the first 5 chapters but then it gets pretty forgetable.

It does not matter what color you are (I am black, my BF and family are white) funny has no racial barrier. We were all ""oh no!!"" and OMG!!! and WHAT!! at every turn. We laughed and laughed and it was a fun way to spend time after eating and exchanging gifts.

R. Kelly is a genius and we can't wait until the next 32 chapters hit!!

I have to say that it turned out to be a very interesting Soap Opera type Musical. Towards the middle episodes I started to get a little bored but the ending brought back the suspense.

Brigitte is having an affair with a midget (they like to be called ""little people"", but I guess he couldn't find a rhyme for that).  She attempts to distract her husband UPSTAIRS with PEARS. REALLY? LOL!  He can't keep his tenses right, he breaks his own storytelling rules, he uses horribly bigoted, sexiest language without seeming to even know it, AND best of all, HE does all the voices for everyone (Bridgette is a white woman in LA who sounds like she's just been plucked off the farm in Alabama).My boyfriend and I put this movie on when we want to freak people out and make them laugh and squirm uncomfortably.  NOT ONE person has watched it without BEGGING for it to be turned off because they're laughing too hard and can't take the horror anymore.  It's that funny-bad. Tommy Wissau's ""the ROOM"" is even worse, so we usually follow ""Trapped in the Closet"" with it.  SO if you're a fan of movies SO HORRIBLY BAD THEY MAKES YOU LAUGH YOURSELF SILLY, THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE! Ed Wood has NOTHING on R. Kelly.",1280880000,4,1068,4.479381443298969

When taken at face value one might mistake this movie for a cheap poorly written narrative about the life of mindless thug.  In reality Kelly has created one of the world's greatest satires.  The character Bridget and her affair with a little person named ""Big Man"" is clearly a metaphor for the Bush Administration's mishandling of the Iraq war, and mismanagement of government funding.  There are so many hidden icons, and underlying themes that one must watch this movie several times before appreciating its cinematic value.  I am very satisfied with Kelly's work and look forward to the sequel which is rumored to be directed by James Cameron.",1261958400,60,758,4.984126984126984
