2671924,5,B000JJ6K1K,All seasons were brand new and wrapped in plastic. Can't wait to order seasons 7- 13!,1461628800,,85,4.375
2671925,5,B000JJ6K1K,"They took this off Netflix, so I had to purchase it. It's a great animated series without being over the top, raunchy, or too inappropriate to enjoy with family. It's an orange, when family guy is an apple. Both are great but are different creatures. If you enjoy the mocking of traditional family stereotype gender roles and traditional family values without going as far as family guy, and still have a need for positive moral lessons where the cast grows throughout the series by those lessons, this is for you and/or your family. You will definitely laugh, at least chuckle, and, if you're anything like me, will hate, even despise, many characters that are introduced or written off. It's somewhat rare to catch King of the Hill on television consistently enough, and now a days, it's most likely something your children haven't seen. Great introduction into the animated genre of sarcastic, funny, and sometimes borderline inappropriate situations/jokes without plunging headlong into the deep end.",1461369600,,1004,5.128048780487805

2671991,5,B000JJ6K1K,"This show is AWESOME!!  I really, really wish that FOX would release seasons 7-13 on DVD as well.  I know they offer it through Instant view methods...but I would rather have the seasons on DVD.

Totally hilarious and well worth the time to watch!",1390348800,,247,4.568181818181818
2671992,2,B000JJ6K1K,"After tearing the plastic away and  opening for the first time we discovered that the discs were scratched and two of them were warped. There is intermittent skipping on multiple discs. This was meant to be an exciting Christmas gift, but turned into a frusterating and dissapointing experience. On top of that, 3 days later I found season 1-6 at a local video store for $30 bucks cheaper. Argh.",1389916800,2,395,4.72463768115942

2671995,5,B000JJ6K1K,"This animated series was great during the first six seasons.  It's funny, well written, and has always got a feel good payoff.  With extremely few exceptions, all episodes in this collection can be watched with the kids.  Even though it may be considered adult humor, it is harmless and fun.  Animation these days uses the art to go to the extremes.  Mike Judge and gang created an animation series that's genius lies in its simplicity and fun!",1373587200,6,444,4.714285714285714

2671998,1,B000JJ6K1K,"I do not understand why is that I  should pay $220+  for something that bought individually , one season at a time , adds to less than $ 120.
I  rate each season as tops, much better than the Simpson, and light years better than family guy( I have the three of them)",1278115200,12,266,3.981132075471698

2672006,5,B000JJ6K1K,"I love the show itself. My only complaint is that most of the discs in every season have only four episodes on each side (disc three of season six has only three episodes on each side), so you have to keep turning the discs over or switching them after only a few episodes. I've bought DVDs of other half-hour shows that had six or more episodes on each disc.",1225497600,3,359,4.217391304347826
2672007,5,B000JJ6K1K,"Mike Judge is a genius.  Beavis and Butthead were the best, BEST cartoon of the 90's.  King of the Hill ended the decade and began the new one with its over the top comedy that somehow was realistic.  This show will live in cartoon history as one of the greats up there with South Park and The Simpsons.",1218326400,4,303,4.189655172413793

8150658,1,B000JJ6K1K,"I didn't purchase this but do the math- if every season is for sale on Prime at $9.86 or whatever... for 13 seasons you're spending roundabout $130. For this, you're getting each season at ~$16 a pop. Not a great deal. Just sayin'. The seasons themselves are obviously amazing. I love King of the Hill.",1520121600,,302,4.509090909090909
