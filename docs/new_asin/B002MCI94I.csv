3952179,5,B002MCI94I,"I have admired this man and his orginization for so many years. They showed an excerpt of the dvd on tv but I still wanted to buy it to watch again. There was so much more in the version you buy. I laughed, I cried and I didn't think I could admire someone more for their message. In such amazing talent and triumph they have also suffered beyond belief.

How this man continues to act with such grace and to see him with is mother and her wishes for him and how proud she is of him was beyond belief. People are such nay sayers in these times but this man, his family and his orginization have been through it all and could teach us all a lesson on how to keep your dignity and professionalism and not become full of hate and why me.

Do yourself a favor and just watch for the uplifting story. Yes, it is very sad at times but life is never perfect and I have never heard someone speak so elequently about their lifes ups and downs. Through cancer, the loss of loved ones, to pleasant suprises and the winners on his NASCAR team breaking all the records. He still can see the beauty beyond his families own suffering. Simply the best ""TOGETHER"".",1261440000,3,1147,4.232876712328767

A deeply touching true story of Rick Hendrick, a good man who suffered through a prison term then the loss of several team and family members who died in an air plane crash.

8373821,5,B002MCI94I,"Whether you root for the drivers of Hendrick Motorsports, or not, you should have this DVD in your Nascar collection. If you're not a Nascar fan, you'd still be moved and inspired by this presentation. The 30 years of Rick Hendrick's racing career has seen it's share of glory and tragedies. This video doesn't hide any of the ""warts"", but focuses on Rick's beliefs that people win Chanpionships and races. Extremely well produced and filmed, every auto racing fan will be chrged up by this DVD. Many have found out facts that have helped to de-polarize their feelings about the HMS organization, like Rick's first win as an owner was driven by the late Dale Earnhardt. Grab this for your video library. You'll be glad you did!",1344384000,,727,4.732283464566929

8373823,3,B002MCI94I,I purchased this DVD as a gift for a Jimmie Johnson fan(my sister) and she certainly likes it. I enjoyed it also. Informative of The Hendrick roots and of Nascar's rise in corporate America's view of bankable enterprises. Jeff Gordon seems to be responsible for a great deal of it's success.,1316131200,,291,4.7254901960784315
