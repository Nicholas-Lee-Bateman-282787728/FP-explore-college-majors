8246365,5,B0012K53MM,"Out of the four episodes featured I wasn't able to find the first two anywhere online for free the first one is dubbed House of the Dead which explains about a soldier looking for his fiance in Hong Kong and as a result the man had a encounter with the supernatural.

The second episode I was not able to find anywhere  else is called Forests of the Night in which three men are stuck in a remote cabin during a thunderstorm and they play a game that unleashes a curse.

Reminds me of the Evil Dead franchise could be it was based on this episode",1359072000,,546,4.180952380952381
